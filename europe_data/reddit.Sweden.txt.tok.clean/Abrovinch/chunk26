  if it contains ammonium chloride it 's some sort of salmiak . 
  edit : also , panda is a finnish brand , so i would n't really count that as `` american sweets '', 
  yes , `` hemv\u00e4rnet '' ( home guard ) , which consist of about 22 000 personnel . 
  in order to enlist you need to have at least 3 months basic military training , and be a swedish citizen . 
  you will need to do at least ( in reality it 's often more ) 4 or 8 days of military training per year . 
  more info : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/home_guard_ ( sweden ) you can also be a part-time soldier in the regular forces . 
  in this case you also have a regular civilian job , or study . 
  americans ca n't handle it as it seems . . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azv9c_wtr1y, 
  all of the nordics would probably be a safe bet . 
  we do n't talk to strangers . 
  i think that they are very sweet and ( generally ) has an odd artificial taste to it . 
  pretty much , yes . . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ex_on_the_beach seems like the show originated in the u.k , have n't watched it myself but i saw an ad for it and felt a bit sick . . 
  your system is much more in line with the bologna system i would say , and is probably the way we may be heading in the coming decade or so . 
  many civilingenj\u00f6r-programmes actually allow you to do internships here . 
  it 's not compulsory , and you must get it yourself , but it 's not uncommon at some universities . 
  `` paradise hotel '' , `` ex on the beach '' and so on . . 
  yes and no . 
  afaik a masters degree is obtained after a bachelors degree . 
  most swedish programmes ( such as civilingenj\u00f6r ) leads on to a professional degree ( yrkesexamina ) . 
  in order to align better the * bologna * - system all civilingenj\u00f6r-programmes were lengthened from 4,5 to 5 years = a master . 
  but still to this day it 's a master that 's obtained without the chance to take a bachelor degree first . 
  [ this blog post ] ( http://ingenjorsbloggen.se/2012/12/dags-att-fundera-pa-bologna-igen/ ) ( swedish ) is a few years old , but still relevant . 
  as stated in the blog , just because you have a `` h\u00f6gskoleingenj\u00f6rsexamen '' ( an engineering programme that 's 3 years long ) does n't mean you can apply for a masters program in engineering . 
  this all boils down to the fact that `` h\u00f6gskoleingenj\u00f6rsexamen '' is a professional degree , and not a bachelors degree , even though both are 3 years . 
  yet , my english title is indeed `` master of engineering '' , and so it says on my diploma . 
   not true , only in the case where it fences off an important recreation area may the authorities order you to put in a gate . 
  not very common . 
  i stand corrected , misread that bit of the phrase when i read it myself . 
  as for horse riding , one could say it all comes down to the `` do n't disturb - do n't destroy '' part . 
  i have done civil engineering here in sweden ( note that civil engineer here means a five year engineering education , and can be obtained in all sorts of fields , electrical , economics , physics , civil engineering etc. ), 
  civil engineer is 5 years/300 points . 
  courses were ( at my university ) either 7,5 or 15 points . 
  52,5 point consisted of `` base courses '' , that all engineering programs had . 
  mostly maths , physics , a bit of statistics , chemistry and economics . 
  127,5 points were called `` core courses '' , that were specific for my program , with some shared with other engineering programs . 
  my program also had more maths and physics included here . 
  most programs have different alignments for the final 2-3 years . 
  each alignment is 90 points , including the 30 point master thesis ( examensarbete in swedish ) . 
  some alignments can be done separately as a master programme as well , my guesstimate is that 90 % of the students at the master programmes are foreign . 
  that leaves 30 points , which we were completely free to use the way we wanted . 
  do n't know ( i do n't use snus myself ) , but according to the public health agency of sweden there are scientific risks . 
  i agree . 
  just to add , the landowner is actually required to provide a gate or another form of passage if he has fenced his land . 
  if not , you have the right , provided you do n't break it , to climb the fence . 
  you should also contact the local authorities who in turn make sure that the landowner provides a passage . 
  you are also allowed to bike or ride a horse in the same areas as you can walk . 
  no , it 's clearly stated both on my card and on all receipts that it is indeed a credit card . 
  at any given moment i can talk to my bank and get a credit on it . 
  even more so here , thanks to snus . 
  til sweden defines europe . . 
  prices : 45 : - , if there are decimals they are raised a bit , like 11 ^ 90 typical [ pricetag ] ( http://www.krav.se/sites/default/files/null/9.jpg ) note the comparison price in yellow . 
  large numbers : 10\u00a0000\u00a0000 decimal places : 1,35 qutation marks : '' like this '' ( note that they are at an angle ), 
  so , my card works pretty much like a debit card . 
  if there is n't enough money on my card account when i try to buy something , it will be rejected . 
  however , the transaction does n't always go through immediately , so sometimes i 'm able to make two purchases when i was only able to afford one , thus giving me a negative on my card account . 
  in that case i just transfer some money to ensure that it 's over 0 again . 
  this is rarely an issue though . 
  as to why i use this card instead of a normal debit card ? 
  it comes with better insurances , some other extras and i collect bonus points on it as well . 
  and it does n't cost me anything extra , win-win . 
  yes , thought about mentioning that , but since it 's comparatively small and pretty narrow i did n't . 
  but you are 100 % correct . 
  i use a credit card , without any credit on it . 
  i know many that does the same , as it gives you more benefits than a regular debit card would . 
  others may just use a debit card . 
  when transferring cash between friends , or sometimes also paying for stuff at a market/yard sale we use [ swish ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swish_ ( payment ) ), 
  of the bigger universities i would say [ uppsala universitet ] ( http://uu.se/en/ ) and [ lunds universitet ] ( http://www.lunduniversity.lu.se ) for engineering [ kungliga tekniska h\u00f6gskolan ] ( https://www.kth.se/en ) and [ chalmers ] ( http://www.chalmers.se/en/pages/default.aspx ) but i would say there are good and bad programs at all universities here . 
  some specific programmes/masters may only exist at a single university . 
  once ordered fries in brazil , they were covered in easy cheese . 
  it was , as you can imagine , disgusting . 
  same in swedish , * slida * . 
  both of you examples are pretty much okay here too , you just ca n't lock the door ( or close it if the child is so small that it ca n't open the door by itself ) . 
  the only thing i can come to think of right now is this phrase lots of girls ( and guys ? ), 
  have on their tinder profile . 
  `` det enda ord som \u00e4r okej att s\u00e4rskriva \u00e4r vin\u00e4ger '' which translates into `` the only compound word that is ok to not write as a compound is vinegar '' now , vin\u00e4ger / vinegar is n't really a compound to start with , but if you were to write it as `` vin \u00e4ger '' instead the meaning changes to `` wine owns '' , with '' \u00e4ger '' / `` owns '' being used as describing that something is the best thing ever . 
  why does it bother me ? 
  it show up every 15-20 profile and is more often than not the only profile text they have . 
  and it just looks absolutely retarded and cringy . 
  i 'm not a parent myself , but one psychologist specialising in children said that you as an adult could take a `` time-out '' instead . 
  you have to use other means . 
  in the same way it is illegal to lock up an adult against their will it 's illegal to do the same to a child . 
  the swedish law basically gives the child the same rights as an adult in these cases . 
  studies has shown that since sweden enacted the current law ( in 1979 ) the amount of youth 's committing crimes , suicide , take drugs etc. 
  has gone down . 
  of course this is n't all due to the law , but it probably have helped and at least has n't made it worse . 
  the idea is that you should n't punish children . 
  you can say to your child that they should go to their room , but you are not allowed to lock them in . 
  you are not allowed to lock up adults either , so the law basically says that what you ca n't do to an adult you ca n't do to a child either . 
  http://www.endcorporalpunishment.org/progress/prohibiting-states/ireland.html it seems you just banned it . 
  not sure how i would describe the general parenting style . 
  but the parents can ( usually ) spend quite a lot of quality time with their children thanks to 480 days of parental leave and at least 5 weeks of vacation time per year . 
  as for freedom and discipline it is pretty well regulated in the law actually . 
  the law states that : `` children are entitled to care , security and a good upbringing . 
  children are to be treated with respect for their person and individuality and may not be subjected to corporal punishment or any other humiliating treatment . '', 
  this means that all forms of physical and psychological `` punishment '' is outlawed . 
  for example you are not allowed to open mail addressed to your child , or ground them to their room/hinder their right to freedom . 
  a father was sentenced with fines after he locked in his five-year old who did n't want to stay in her room when it was time for bed . 
  two malaysian parents were sentenced to 10 and 14 months , as well as fines , in prison after having spanked their children . 
  the family was at the time living and working in sweden . 
  when i was young i was often out playing with other kids in the area , riding our bikes etc.
