  `` taking the piss '', 
  my comment was mostly meant to be humorous , but i 'll bite . 
  just some facts from sweden . 
  during the summer the number of hotel nights spent in sweden by chinese tourists went up by 25 % ( total number of hotel nights by foreign tourists went up 1,1 % during the summer months ) . 
  the number of asylum seekers went down over 80 % compared to 2016 . 
  the number of people who died in terrorist attacks in the eu in 2016 was 142 . 
  in the same time 604 persons were killed in mass shootings in the u.s. ( 4 persons of more shot ) now , if people refrain from visiting europe , that 's fine , it 's their choice . 
  but do n't come and make statements that it 's more unsafe than elsewhere in the world, 
  fox news, 
  still 235 euros/month more than we have , 
  some of the fakes were really well done . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.svtstatic.se/image-cms/svtse/1453716991/svts/article6072399.svt/alternates/extralarge/polisbil-jpg ) is a fake police car . 
  lol , you could always try . 
  in 2016 25 americans applied for asylum in sweden . . 
  it was a bit of a grey area before . 
  it was always illegal to pretend to be a policeman or any other official . 
  but according to a court ruling having your car painted as a police car was n't enough for that law to come into effect . 
  there are also exceptions in the new law as well , such as if it is obvious that the car is n't a police car . 
  like if it 's painted in the old black colour scheme . 
  [ black/white police car ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/1974plymouthvaliantpolicecar.jpg ) [ modern day police car ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/volvo_xc70_p24_swedish_police_car_35-9110.jpg ), 
  it is now illegal to have your personal car painted to look like a police car . 
  and dental care is now free for everyone up to 21 years of age . 
  since sweden is very elongated flying is really the only way to travel between the south and the north . 
  the only direct train service between stockholm and lule\u00e5 , which is the main focus city up north and has about 75000 inhabitants , is a 13 hour overnight service . 
  on the other hand there are 10-12 daily boeing 737 operated by sas and norwegian flying the route . 
  flying domestic is really convenient here , you are air-side within 3 minuits after arriving at the airport . 
  almost every city/town has an airport with flights to stockholm . 
  longest domestic flights are stockholm-kiruna and gothenburg-lule\u00e5 , both taking 1 hour and 40 minuits . 
  prices start at about 250 sek one way with norwegian and about 600 sek with sas . 
  lol , fria tider ... you do realise that those who had to move had a temporary contract that had come to an end ? 
  the owner probably got paid more by having refugees living there instead . 
  he has no obligation to sign a new contract with those who lived there before . 
  my guess is that you are a pretty young guy that want to blame your failures on someone else . . 
  [ h\u00e5kan hellstr\u00f6m ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkft1tabqoq ) this summer in gothenburg . 
  70 000 attended on both june 4 and 5 . 
  besides hellstr\u00f6m , springsteen also draws large crowds up to 65 000 . 
  that was a lot of bullshit in one post . . 
  much better with a [ link ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfo-8z86x80 ) to the performance . 
  as a swede , our national sport is to complain that we sent the wrong song to eurovision , but in 2012 i think that everyone agreed we did it right . 
  the swedish parliament consist of 8 parties . 
  in order for a party to get a seat in the parliament they need at least 4 % of the votes . 
  the current government consist of two parties , the social democrats ( 31 % ) and the green party ( 6,9 % ) . 
  both are considered left parties , although they have their differences . 
  the greens are pretty liberal in some cases , while the social democrats have moved towards the centre in others . 
  the main opposition is what we call `` borgerligheten '' , also known as `` the alliance '' , which are the centre-right parties . 
  the centre party ( 6,1 % ) is a green party that focus mainly on people living on the country side . 
  the liberal party ( 5,4 % ) is a social liberal party . 
  the moderates ( 23,3 % ) is the main right party who is focusing on lowering the taxes . 
  the last party in the alliance is the christ democrats ( 4,6 % ) which is the most conservative party in the parliament , still not as conservative as the conservatives in the u.s though . 
  other parties in the parliament are the `` lefts '' ( 5,7 % ) who collaborates partly with the government but are in some cases seen as a pretty extreme party by some . 
  the last part is the `` sweden democrats '' ( 12,9 % ) who are the right populist party of sweden . 
  personally i like the moderates the most since they want to allow more choices within the social welfare and keep the income taxes down for low income workers . 
  the current government has kept the lowered income taxes for low income workers . 
  least favourite is a three-way tie between the greens , the left and the sweden democrats . 
  the greens since they are way to utopian in some cases and their mps have done some pretty stupid things . . 
  the lefts and the seden democrats since both of them honestly lost track of reality . . 
  `` kvarting '' is actually referring to a quarter of a `` stop '' , which is 1,308 litres . 
  s\u00e5 a `` kvarting '' is actually 0,327 litres , close enough to 37,5 cl i guess . 
  yes , but sweden has a tradition of using professional degrees , we have over 40 of them . 
  while these programmes were altered in 2007 ( mostly in length ) according to the bologna process there are some differences . 
  i personally do n't lit fireworks ( it 's expensive . . ) , but it is legal to do so . 
  however you can only buy fireworks between 27/12 and 31/12 . 
  unless you have a permit from the police , and you may only lit the fireworks on the 31/12 without a permit from the police and the fire department . 
  in cooking we use `` matsked '' ( tablespoon = 15ml ) , `` tesked '' ( teaspoon = 5ml ) and `` kryddm\u00e5tt '' ( spice measurement = 1ml ) , all of these are used together with deciliter , just for added confusion . 
  screen sizes are all in `` tum '' ( inch ) . 
  other than that i ca n't really think of any `` special '' units . 
  maybe the `` mil '' ( mile ) , but that 's just 10km . 
  do n't know about the others , but in sweden becoming a teacher means 4 ( preschool ) to 5,5 ( secondary school ) years at university . 
  unfortunately it 's not very popular to become a teacher meaning the grade requirements are very low , thus leading on to many unmotivated teachers . 
  well this is a bit awkward , two norwegians have said sweden and i 'm about to say our best friend is finland . . 
  still love you though , norway !, 
  ( except when it 's skiing in the winter olympics ... ), 
  about 50 % of the population lives in their own house , not very unlike an american suburb tbh . 
  houses are mostly bade out of wood , but stone houses are not unheard of . 
  most houses are from 120 m ^ 2 and up to a lot . 
  generally houses in the nordics are bigger than in the rest of europe , which makes sense as land is n't an issue here . 
  the other half lives in apartments . 
  mostly by themselves or just two . 
  sweden has the largest amount of single person households in europe . 
  when you start a family you generally move to your own house . 
  average wage is 32.000 sek / month ( $ 3470 ) , on which you pay ( on average ) about 24,3 % income tax before deductions . 
  income tax levels are highly progressive so a wage of 30.000 sek equals 23,8 % tax and 34.000 equals 24,8 % . 
  one interesting thing is that sweden ( together with the other nordic countries ) lacks a minimum wage . 
  wages are individual but the base levels are set by collective bargaining . 
  but in theory you can pay as little as you want , in practise this is of course totally impossible . 
  unions are super strong here ( but they generally work with , not against , the employer ) public services available include ( but are not limited to ) practically `` free '' healthcare , subsidized dental care , 100 % tuition free education including university , 480 days parental leave ( to split between both parents ) , sick leave , allowances for children and if you are studying etc. 
  annual leave is at least 25 days , and popular vacation destinations include the mediterranean and thailand . 
  most families own a car , some two . 
  hunting , fishing , camping , skiing etc. 
  are all very popular activities to take part in during free time . 
  every time there 's even a discussion about changing something in donald duck on christmas . 
  also about who will be the christmas host on svt 1 ( public broadcaster ), 
  you did n't touch upon the biggest benefit of the metric system , the easy conversion between units . 
  also , dividing by 10 is n't more difficult than 12 , you just move the decimal or change the prefix . 
  now , many americans say that in science , and in some school subjects they use metric , so it 's not a big deal . 
  but why go through the trouble of having two systems ? 
  look at this [ map ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/metric_system#/media/file:metric_system_adoption_map.svg ) , it really is time that the u.s joins the rest of the world . 
  or as we say in sweden `` sl\u00e4pp sargen och kom in i matchen ! '', 
  hey , we 've got saunas too !, 
  stockholm-area : +6 and sunny , it 's almost like early spring right now . . with that said , i could n't imagine living in a place without four distinct seasons .
