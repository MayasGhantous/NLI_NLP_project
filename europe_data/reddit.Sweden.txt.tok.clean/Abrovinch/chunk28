  according to official statistic 9 % of people between the age of 16 and 84 smokes daily , the total amount of smokers is 14 % in 2016 , down from 25 % in 2006 . 
  it should be noted that 11 % use [ snus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/snus ) daily instead . 
  the amount of people that use snus has stayed on the same level for the last decade . 
  one interesting thing that can be noted from the statistics ( provided by the public health agency ) is that there is a higher percentage of smokers in the groups of lower income , lower degree of education etc. 
  while the amount of `` snusers '' are pretty evenly spread out throughout society . 
  [ nu t\u00e4ndas tusen juleljus ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndwia4e4jje ) also , no christmas without [ triad ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q7ciywadug ) bonus , [ o helga natt ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4wlqmioruo ) which is `` cantique de no\u00ebl '' in swedish . 
  the usual burgers , big mac , quarter pounder etc. 
  specials vary , but here in sweden we now have burgers composed by the chef johan jureskog . 
  [ said burgers ] ( http://cdn.senses.se/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/jureskog-mcdonalds.jpg ) they have been on before , hence the earlier dates . 
  yes , there 's [ this ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/9/91/estimated_mean_age_of_leaving_the_parental_household%2c_by_sex%2c_2013.png ) statistic from the eu about it as well, 
  we celebrate on christmas eve . 
  christmas day is a popular day for going to the cinema ( lot 's of new movies premieres on christmas day ) . 
  in ( especially ) smaller cities christmas day is also a popular day to go out and drink and meet old friends that moved away to other parts of the country for work or studies . 
  there 's also loads of ferries , some overnight . 
  i feel like something got lost in translation regarding these areas . 
  you need to put things into a swedish perspective . 
  it 's pretty much local young guys fed up with the system that 's very angry . 
  they will set a car on fire to get the police called to `` their area '' and then throw rocks at them . 
  it 's not really aimed directly towards civilians ( even though civilians are affected by it ) . 
  this goes in waves , have n't read anything about it in the papers for a while , maybe it 's to cold outside . . 
  i 'm not trying to downplay it , it is a problem . 
  but they way it 's been reported in , especially international , media is insane . 
  i still feel safer in those areas than in many other areas around the world , including europe . 
  `` lilla landet lagom '' - `` small country * lagom * '' a country on the edge of europe without any real extremes . 
  `` i detta avl\u00e5nga land '' - `` in this elongated country '' the differences in nature , culture and weather between the south and the north are pretty substantial . 
  is your dads name `` gustav svensson '' ? 
  ansaldobreda also deluvered trams to gothenburg . 
  deliveries were late and after just a few years ( with technical problems ) they now have problems with corrosion . 
  the next order for trams went to bombardier . . 
  funny thing about tungsten is that the element is called `` volfram '' in swedish . 
  that would be a gym , and the school is a gymnasium . 
  here it 's two completely different words . 
  `` movits ! '', 
  is from lule\u00e5 .

  do n't know about norway , but for sweden it works like this : cars that emits low amounts of co2 ( the value is dependent against the cars weight ) will be exempt from road tax the first 5 years . 
  in addition persons who buy an all electric car will get the price of the car subsidized with 40 000 sek ( about $ 4000 ) . 
  buyers of hybrid cars with a combined co2 emission of 50g/km will get subsidized with 20 000 sek . 
  many new cars are so called `` tj\u00e4nstebil '' , which means that the company you work for buys the car and service etc. 
  but for you it 's practically the same as owning a car . 
  in return you will get a net pay reduction and pay tax on the `` f\u00f6rm\u00e5nsv\u00e4rde '' , directly translated `` benefit value '' . 
  for electric cars and plug in hybrid this value is reduced by 40 % , making it a much cheaper option . 
  due to norway 's geography the car is very much needed in some parts of the country i would guess . 
  it 's the same here in sweden , where cars are dirt cheap in comparison . 
  `` j\u00e4nkare '' is very often used for american cars from the 50s and 60s , which are a huge thing over here . 
  although in a clear minority , there are many swedish speaking finns . 
   our many wars with sweden ? 
  because it was with sweden . 
  is it at this time i should point out that you lost most of the wars as well ? 
  ah yes , the accent that make you sound a bit retarded . 
  there 's no party for you , but you probably would n't get into trouble . 
  people would just see you as either a joker or as someone who 's a bit ... special . 
  all in all , very harmless . 
  it 's a big industry with a lot of start ups . 
  famous ones include spotify , majong ( minecraft ) , dice ( battlefield-series ) , skype ( collaboration with estonia and denmark , i think ) , piratebay etc. . 
  the big international companies are here as well . 
  in lule\u00e5 , which is in northern sweden , facebook built it 's first data-center outside the u.s. youtube clip about `` sweden 's silicone valley '' : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d915p1axlke, 
  oh , i forgot about that . 
  `` fr\u00f6ken '' is quite funny when you think about it , used to mean `` miss '' , but now used by small children as a substitute of `` teacher '' , even for male teachers . . 
  just first name or nickname , all the way from 1st grade to a university degree . 
  [ sm\u00e5 grodorna ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=on9plzly0ww ) during midsummer . . 
  lol , that 's the most ridiculous thing i 've heard today . 
  urinals are in no way being outlawed . 
  the only thing is that since most new bathrooms are unisex there are no urinals there for other reasons . 
  u.s media ... 
  unisex bathrooms are common here in sweden . 
  there 's really nothing special about them , except they lack urinals . 
  however bathrooms here are most of the time not really cubicles , but real toilet rooms with normal indoor walls and standard doors . 
  sometimes they even have a basin and soap for washing your hands , and a washing area outside as well . 
  problem with that statistic is that it 's for a single year only . 
  that definition makes no sense at all . 
  a black person borne and raised in england is way mor european than a white american that just moved here . 
  also , i do n't even think we carry statistics over skin colour here . 
  we do however carry statistics over foreign born , as well as persons whose parents are born abroad . 
   they invaded finland no , we did n't . 
  finland sort of just became a part of sweden somewhere in 1100-1200s , when the concept of countries still was pretty vague . 
  caravans are , unfortunately , not uncommon to see on the roads during the summer . 
  people use the form camping , no one lives permanently in them . 
  personally , i hate seeing them on the roads , especially on the 2 +1 roads . 
  pretty much this . 
  no fuzz , no games , just efficient and still nice . 
  the law only regulates how the flag looks , that is colour , aspect ratio etc. 
  the only thing that is strictly forbidden is to put markings , letters etc. 
  on the flag . 
  in the olden days you were supposed to burn the flag when it was decommissioned . 
  nowadays there are no laws stating what to do with an old flag . 
  however it is seen as a nice gesture to cut it into pieces before throwing it away , burning is not recommended any more due to environmental reasons . 
  it does indeed , norway is super expensive !, 
  in the mean time , we go to germany for cheap booze !, 
   sweden  cheap liquor pick one, 
  traitor !, 
  well , they do n't eat surstr\u00f6mming for a start . . 
  we celebrate on the 24th . 
  the day usually begins with a breakfast of rise porridge , also known as `` christmas porridge '' . 
  after that it varies from family to family but for us it 's a lot of preparations for the dinner . 
  at 15.00 sweden stops to watch donald duck https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/from_all_of_us_to_all_of_you#sweden after donald duck we eat a traditional christmas dinner , containing a big ham , herring , meatballs , smoked salmon , sausages etc. 
  [ julmust ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/julmust ) is the drink of choice . 
  after the dinner it 's time for the presents , which have been under the christmas tree all day . 
  after the presents we usually watch the `` compulsory '' programme 's on tv the rest of the evening . 
  the further north you go , the more common it is .
