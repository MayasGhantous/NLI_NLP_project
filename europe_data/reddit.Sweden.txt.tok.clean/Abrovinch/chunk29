  but it 's really not uncommon in the south either . 
  sweden has , after switzerland , the most guns per capita in europe . 
  meh , we had the same prime minister for 23 years after ww2 , without being a dictatorship . 
  if the germans are fed up with merkel , they will vote for someone els , i frankly do n't see the problem . 
  also regarding free press , germany ranks 19 , which is not bad . 
  the u.s for instance ranks 41 . 
  thus , the german press is supposedly more free than the u.s press . 
  only `` real '' poll i 've found was from 2006 . 
  but i remember seeing it in the news time to time . 
  or it 's from facebook ... point is , i only remember seeing such a poll when he said that we apparently voted usa as the # 1 threat . 
  if i remember correctly it was # 1 threat against world peace , not against sweden . 
  those are vastly different things . 
  joke you, 
  i see eesti is trying to get into nordics again . . 
  yes , here 's the one for uppsala : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyfznvikqog, 
  there are cooperation between the different counties ( which are the ones responsible for public transport here ) . 
  but getting 21 counties , plus some oddball municipalities that run their own public transport , together and design and implement a standardized ticket system is just not feasible . 
  there is n't any need for it either really , the distance between lule\u00e5 in norrbotten county and malm\u00f6 in region sk\u00e5ne is about 1500 km , the same as between amsterdam and barcelona . 
  it is however possible to buy a ticket valid for the whole trip on the internet : https://kopbiljett.resrobot.se, 
  no , they 're courting to the socio-economic vulnerable groups in society . 
  you muppet . 
  handelsbanken accept cash for deposit at all of their branches . 
  still agree with you though , the other `` banks '' are useless in this regard . 
  i do n't know since i 'm not into that , but i presume they use cash . 
   the united states generally divides along these lines well , there 's your problem . 
  europe is n't the united states . 
  about 35 sek ( 3.50 $ ) . 
  i very rarely use an atm , instead i pay for everything by card , even small things such a can of soda . 
  when sharing a bill among friends we settle the debts with [ swish ] ( http://www.ccsinsight.com/blog/swedish-swish ) . 
  sweden is very quickly becoming a `` sorry , no cash '' country . 
  3/4 major banks do n't handle any cash at most of their branches , you ca n't pay with cash on the bus etc. 
  danish , no question about it . 
  walking , riding a hores , putting up a tent , pick mushrooms etc. 
  anywhere * at any time . 
  if there is a fence the landowner must make a passage through , or he will get fined ( and you have the right to climb over the fence ) . 
  * anywhere but private gardens and cultivated land , like farms . 
  edit : this of course also applies to lakes , where it 's free to take a swim or row a boat . 
  not really , good enough implies that more would be better , which is n't the case with * lagom * . 
  it 's more that sweetspot where it 's not to little and not to much . 
  it can be used in so many different settings as well . 
  the `` easiest '' is of course how much food you want on your plate , * lagom * of course . 
  but you could also argue about what is a * lagom * salary for a specific job , what is a * lagom * time for a child to go to bed ? 
  it 's a very versatile word that is also very individual , thus it 's also a very bad answer to a question . 
  `` how many pancakes do you want ? '', 
  ffs ... 
  well , there 's the classic * lagom * , which is pretty undefined even in swedish . 
  yeah , sorry we let the u.s ( among others ) build the bofors 40 mm aa gun . 
  i have a mastercard credit card , but choose not to have a credit , so it works just like a mastercard debit card . 
  the reason for that is that the card has basically the same fee as the debit card , but for every 20k sek i pay with the card i get 60 sek in an investment fund . 
  not much but it basically pays the card . 
  and whenever i feel for it i can just apply to have a credit ( which is interest free 45 days ) . 
  it 's a pretty good deal i think . 
  there is no such thing as a `` credit rating '' . 
  loans for buying a house/car whatever are decided upon case by case . 
  as long as you have a steady income and have n't failed any payments within the last few years you can get a credit card . 
  by steady income i mean any job really . 
  buying things and pay later by invoice is pretty popular when shopping online . 
  usually there 's no questions asked as long as you have n't a failed payment within the last few years . 
  it was a collaborative effort , the u.s did a lot , so did soviet and the british . 
  i feel that many americans have this feeling that it was all up to them , and thus downplaying all the other nations contributing to the win . 
  keep in mind that the u.s joined the war at a very late stage , the battle of britain was already over and germany had already declared war on soviet . 
  the war in the pacific is a totally different story . 
  japan did n't fight in europe and thus the pacific theatre is nowhere near as `` important '' to europeans . 
  history is taught all the way from year 1 to 9 in elementary school . 
  there 's also one class of history that 's compulsory for all in secondary school . 
  in elementary school it consists of the following topics ( from the swedish national agency of education ) years 1-3 : * to live together * to live in the local area * to live in the world * to explore reality years 4-6 are mostly about sweden and the nordics . 
  * from antiquity to the middle ages * the nordics and the swedish empire 1500-1700 * higher yields and the agriculture transformation 1700-1850 * how history is used and historical concepts years 7-9 includes more world history . 
  * former civilizations , from prehistoric to 1700s * industrialisation , social transformation 1700-1900s * imperialism and world wars 1800-1950 * democratisation , post war and globalisation 1900-now * how history is used and historical concepts history in secondary school builds on what 's learned in elementary school . 
  if you choose to do more classes they 're much more about context and being critical . 
  is n't the odd thing about french that they use multiples of 20 , and add tens/whatever instead ? 
  `` quattre-vingt-dix-huit '' = 4x20 +10 +8 = 98 same in swedish would be `` nittio\u00e5tta '' = nio x tio + \u00e5tta = 9x10 +8 = 98, 
  recreational use of firearms is completely normal here in sweden , after switzerland we have the most guns per capita . 
  you need to get a license for everything except low energy air guns . 
  in order to get a license you must either be a hunter or a member of a shooting club . 
  you need a license for every gun/rifle you own . 
  shooting clubs also have their own weapons you can borrow while your ' e there . 
  you do n't need a specific license for the weapons you borrow , but you need to pass a course , different for pistols and rifles , i 'm 95 % sure you can also shoot semi-automatic at a shooting club . 
  if you have a license you can keep your guns and ammunition at home . 
  guns need to be placed in a special locker like [ this ] ( http://www.pretect.se/res/atn1024_vapenskap_ts_9g_o.jpg ) . 
  the ammunition also needs to be locked up . 
  you can have 20 kg of gunpowder in ammunition , which is about 13000 shotgun cartridges at home any single time . 
  all in all , guns are a big part of our culture and many have rifles at home . 
  but they are never used as `` protection '' , and you ca n't walk around with a loaded gun outside , it must be dismantled in a way that you ca n't shoot with it during transport . 
  while we 're home we rely on safety doors , alarms and strong windows . 
  and the fact that burglars do n't have guns at all anyway . 
  considering that i have bought extremely `` girly '' ciders and pinky bubbly ros\u00e9 wines without a problem ( i have a beard ) it must be your store . 
  i honestly think that systembolaget are among the best stores out there . 
  the staff is really helpful , and knowledgable , and the stores themselves are very neatly and logically laid out . 
  it should be added that 900kkr/year is a lot of money , and not really representative in the grand scheme of things . 
  a more normal pay of 420kkr/year ( which is still far from bad ) gives an income tax rate of 25 % . 
  also , i would n't include the payroll tax , since that really is n't part of your salary . 
  the most popular soft drink around christmas , [ julmust ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/julmust ) is practically impossible to get outside of sweden . 
  i know ikea stocks it , but that 's about it . 
  the name lists are from scb , so it 's legit . 
  the vast majority call it moose when speaking english . 
  even though our own word , * \u00c4lg * , is more connected to elk . 
  off to denmark with you !, 
  moose is pretty common , but there 's also lynx , brown bear , wild boars , wolves , wolverines , deer etc. 
  the sami people also has a lot of reindeer , but those are n't really wild animals . 
  top ten for those born in 2015 : ** boys ** : william , lucas , liam , oskar , elias , hugo , oliver , charlie , axel , vincent .
