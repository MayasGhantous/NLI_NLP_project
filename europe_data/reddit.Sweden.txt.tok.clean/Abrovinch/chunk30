  we had a competition against another school in the same city during secondary school . 
  it was mostly for fun though , and the initiative came from the student 's council at both schools , but it was backed up . 
  school teams as such does n't exist here though , but most of the students are still active one way or another , there are many teams and associations in various sports across every city/town . 
  there 's no need for the schools to have their own . 
  school spirit seems , from what you described , pretty awkward tbh . 
  but then again we are pretty reserved anyway , except when it comes to football ( the one with an actual ball ) . 
  there are many student 's associations at every university that come together and arranges many events , most of the events revolve around getting drunk as fuck while playing stupid games in funny clothes . 
  edit : the norwegians do however come together and dress according to the tradition in time for graduation , and if i 'm not wrong the `` russ '' goes on for quite a bit .

  actually , that 's not the ak 4 ( g3 ) but it 's one of the first models of the ak 5 ( fn fnc ) . 
  nowadays we use an updated version of the ak 5 and have a much more modern uniform . 
  but the snus will never go !, 
  [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6xyff9c.jpg ) one is from the end of the cold war . 
  note the tactical * snusdosa * in his pocket . 
  do n't know if you 've read this article : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/11689464/how-sweden-became-the-startup-capital-of-europe.html but it does have som points as to why . 
  but generally , alla i could think of is that sweden for a very long time has had a history of entrepreneurship , invested heavily and early in it , and that swedes generally has a mindset that makes it `` ok to fail '' and wants to solve a practical problem . 
  it 's actually more the startups that have problems due to the housing problem . 
  no , americano is a watered down espresso . 
  regular black coffee here is a completely different animal . 
  as a replied elsewhere . 
  the reason that most change into the full-blown mastercard is that the maestro option starts to cost money , the same amount as the mastercard , but since a mastercard comes with benefits such as travel insurance there is no imitative to stay with maestro . 
  credit cards are pretty common in sweden , but you can chose to have a debit mastercard as well . 
  personally i have a mastercard debit card with some extras . 
  just because the danes are good at speaking english does n't mean you should n't learn danish when moving there , and planning to stay . 
  how else would you integrate with the society and make friends ? 
  if you were to go to a dinner party i can assure you that while any conversation aimed directly at you will be in english , you still would n't have a clue on what 's going on around you . 
  now , i would n't have fulfilled my duties as a swede without making fun of danish , so here it goes : [ kamel\u00e5s\u00e5 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-moy8vuebk ), 
  visa/mastercard does n't have to be credit cards , they can also be debit cards . 
  they do have some other perks though , such as travel insurance etc. 
  that you do n't get with maestro . 
  just checked and my bank has the same fee ( except if you 're under 21 years of age ) for maestro and debit mastercard . 
  you can pay with them almost anywhere . 
  the thing with maestro ( and visa electron ) is that the terminal must be online and the transaction verified by the bank as it happen . 
  this mostly works just fine , but sometimes it does n't and you have a problem . 
  the card is usually cheaper though . 
  in sweden it 's mostly kids and youths that use maestro/visa electron . 
  kids usually get their first card between the ages 10 and 14 . 
  depending on when the card expires , most change into a mastercard/visa at the age 18-21 . 
  it 's funny how close german and swedish is sometimes , it 's called ** filterkaffe ** here , when it 's not just called ** kaffe ** , obviously . 
  yeah , you should . 
  be aware that many of the big coffee chains coffee sucks balls though . 
  might as well add that i do love me a good double espresso , but they are still too small . 
  `` sorry , no cash '' - 3/4 major banks in sweden . 
  there was a few cases with youngsters robbing buses and the unions immediately took action . 
  i do believe that they wanted to get rid of the cash way before that anyway , one less thing to carry around and no more counting . 
  good to know , most of the above would be available in a swedish caf\u00e9 . 
  but we also have the `` classic nordic coffee '' , which probably is what op wanted . 
  problem is it really is n't available outside of the nordics , at least not in the way we tend to like it . 
  coffee is important here too ( we are among the top consumers in the world ) . 
  but it 's done in a completely different way . 
  we mostly make our coffee in a drip filter brewer with different roastings . 
  if done properly you get a strong , yet quite round coffee . 
  now of course drip filter coffee is available almost anywhere in the world . 
  but the roasts , the high quality water and probably the measuring is unique . 
  personally i 've never hade a good cup of plain black coffee outside the nordics . 
  perhaps it 's not seen as fine coffee elswhere ? 
  but if done properly , few things can compete imho . 
  americano tastes like shit though . 
  arabia is in asia ... are you thinking of muslims ? 
  we take coffee very seriously here as well , but the culture is completely different , * fika * . 
  also , i 've never had a good cup of black coffee outside of the nordics . 
  as someone that had 14 sek , or about $ 1,50 , in my wallet for the last two weeks coming to germany was obviously a big shock . 
  lovely country otherwise though !, 
  `` sorry , no cards , only cash ! '', 
  - big caf\u00e9 in munich . 
  wtf germany ? 
  there are three universities/schools that are not government owned , but operate on the basis of an agreement with the government of sweden and conforms to national degree regulations and quality requirements . 
  these are chalmers , j\u00f6nk\u00f6ping university and stockholm school of economics . 
  all three are operated by non-profit institutes . 
  according to wikipedia about 75 % of the money used to operate the stockholm school of economics comes from private investors . 
  i suspect a lot of the private money goes into research . 
  for a student there 's no real difference . 
  you still apply through the same web page and your grades are still rated the same way etc. 
  yes , generally all forms of education is free in sweden . 
  the few exceptions are some tertiary art educations and tertiary vocational educations , such as bartender schools . 
  even private universities/colleges etc. 
  are free . 
  you still need to pay for the books though , to counter this most educations grants you student allowance from the state . 
  this allowance is $ 290/month , and on top of that you may take a loan ( with very low interest and good terms i might add ) of up to $ 730/month . 
   they 're both in uppsala why am i not surprised ? 
  still better than what they did in uppsala . 
  when revamping a street into a `` parade street '' they added a replica of an art installation promoting the ddr-regime , from ddr ... http://mobil.unt.se/kultur-noje/nytt-ddr-konstverk-vid-carolinabacken-3894688.aspx, 
  palme was really controversial , especially with regards to foreign politics where he rooted for the dictators in cuba and chile , as well as made a direct comparison between the us and the nazis during vietnam . 
  i would rather name per-albin hansson and tage erlander , and maybe even fredrik reinfeldt as the best . 
  each had different struggles that they had to guide sweden through . 
  '' `` no-go area '' ( or `` no-go zone '' ) is an area in a town barricaded off to civil authorities by a force such as a paramilitary , or barred to certain individuals or groups . 
  [ 1 ] it has also been used to refer to areas undergoing insurgency where ruling authorities have lost control and are unable to enforce sovereignty . 
  [ 2 ] '' that 's not what 's happening here . 
  true , there are problems in areas with low socio-economic status , and sometimes ambulance and fire brigade have asked for police support . 
  the police still goes in all the time , there are still services such as school 's , clinics , public transport etc etc. 
  operating as usual in these areas . 
  maybe you should leave your cellar and go out and see the world sometimes ? 
  i have myself visited these areas , which according to you is `` no-go zones '' . 
  i have survived , and never got into any trouble . 
  as would anyone do , unless you are being a total dick about it , but that applies to most places . 
  yes !, 
  in stockholm you can find the following museums : * [ arm\u00e9museum ] ( http://www.armemuseum.se/languages/english/ ) - the army musum * [ livrustkammaren ] ( http://livrustkammaren.se/en/visit/facilities ) - the royal armory . 
  * [ vasamuseet ] ( https://www.vasamuseet.se/en ) - the vasa museum .
