  outside stockholm , but still doable , you will find the following : * [ flygvapenmuseum ] ( http://www.flygvapenmuseum.se//en ) - the air force museum , located in link\u00f6ping . 
  * [ marinmuseum ] ( https://www.marinmuseum.se/en ) - the naval museum , located in karlskrona . 
  * [ arsenalen ] ( http://arsenalen.se/en/ ) - a museum with loads of military vehicles . 
  one nice thing is that all , except arsenalen and the vasa museum , are free of charge . 
  shakira laws , no-go zones , swedistan etc etc, 
  my biggest problem with the american tipping culture is it really being a hidden charge you more or less have to pay . 
  it also makes the servers overly friendly . 
  i 'm at the restaurant to enjoy the food and the company of my family/friends , not to become friends with the server . 
  and lastly , because the servers get more tips the more guests they serve you could feel rushed . 
  a dinner at a restaurant should be allowed to take it 's time , the food does n't need to arrive within 10 minuets etc. 
  in addition dental care is free until the year you turn 19 . 
  after that you get a `` dental care allowance '' every year that is either 150 or 300 sek , you can save the money one year . 
  there is also a `` high cost protection '' . 
  you pay everything up to 3000 sek by yourself , for sums between 3000 and 15 000 you pay 50 % and above 15 000 you only pay 15 % . 
  most watched tv-program last year was the finale of * melodifestivalen * , the swedish competition before eurovision . 
  second was * donald duck and his friends celebrate christmas * then it was [ * p\u00e5 sp\u00e5ret * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/p\u00e5_sp\u00e5ret ), 
  fun fact , `` fitta '' originally meant `` v\u00e5tmark '' ( wetland ) other fun names : fjuckby sn\u00e5lkuk ( cheap dick ), 
  not like those cereals . 
  most cereals we have for breakfast are whole grain with very little added sugar , berries are a common add-on . 
  though i would wager that most people here in sweden have m\u00fcsli with yoghurt or [ filmj\u00f6lk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/filmj\u00f6lk ) instead . 
  or porridge . 
  yes , we also have those small stores together with the petrol station . 
  the thing that stood out was when you could buy 3l bag in box vodka at an autobahn service center . 
  if alcohol was as cheap and easy to get hold of in sweden as it is in most other parts of europe i 'm sure that sweden would look a lot more like russia ... 
  being able to buy booze at a petrol station was one of the biggest culture shocks for me when road tripping in europe . 
  the act of succession is probably the most weird , since many parts stay unchanged from 1810 , when it was written . 
   everything as herein provided we not only accept for ourselves as the unalterable fundamental law , but also direct and graciously command all who are united in loyalty , fealty and obedience to us , our successors and the realm , to acknowledge , observe , abide by and obey this act of succession . 
  in witness whereof we have this day with our own hand signed and confirmed it , and duly affixed our royal seal thereto , in \u00d6rebro , on the twenty-sixth day of september , in the year of our lord and saviour jesus christ one thousand eight hundred and ten . 
  signed by representatives of the nobility , clergy , burghers and peasantry . 
  and then you would get off the bus at the next stop , even if it is n't yours . 
  changing seat is n't an option as that just escalate the weirdness . 
  that made me feel very uncomfortable . . 
  except all those values in the graph for eu is totally wrong . 
  it should go like this : * nox : 0.080 for diesel and 0.060 for petrol . 
  in the graph it 's listed as 0.4 * pm : 0.005 for both diesel and petrol . 
  in the grap it 's listed as 0.04 , notice the extra zero in the real standards . 
  * co : 0.5 for diesel and 1.0 for petrol . 
  co2 is n't even part of the emission standards , but the more co2 a car let out , the more it 's taxed . 
  since the swedish constitution really is four fundamental laws a `` last article '' as such does n't really makes any sense . 
  but the last paragraph of the fourth fundamental law , `` the fundamental law on freedom of expression '' states the following : `` chapter 11 . 
  general provisions art . 
  the provisions laid down in chapter 14 , articles 1 to 3 of the freedom of the press act concerning the re-opening of closed cases , examination of freedom of the press cases before a higher instance and prompt handling of such cases shall apply also in respect of corresponding cases under this fundamental law . 
  provisions laid down in an act of law or other statute apply in all respects not specially regulated in this fundamental law or in an act of law adopted by virtue of this fundamental law . 
  foreign nationals are equated with swedish citizens in respect of freedom of expression under this fundamental law unless otherwise provided in law . '', 
  makes absolutely no sense whatsoever on it 's own . . 
  checked for myself , 70cl absolut vodka is 315 nok = 337 sek ... that 's 35 euros . . edit : and a 33cl can of carlsberg ( 5 % abv ) is 30 nok ( 3,30 euros ) that 's about 2,7 times more expensive than sweden , which is expensive to start with ... 
  this question is very very complex . 
  but the main reason why diesels are n't common in passenger cars in the u.s is simply because the demand is low . 
  there is however possible to buy diesels from some manufacturers , like for instance bmw . 
  now , the actual emission standards are not necessarily better or worse . 
  they are * different * , as in some values might be higher , while others are lower . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but the big pick-up trucks have a different legislation than normal passenger cars , right ? 
  we have all seen the clips of americans `` rolling coal '' ... 
  there are many reasons to why you can not import a car to the u.s. 
  the actual emission values play a very small part in that . 
  taxes . 
  yes , even more so . 
  a domestic ( piss ) beer on the tap will set you back about 6 euros for 40-45cl . 
  a 33cl bottle of heiniken could also cost 6 euros . 
  a drink ( with 5-6cl of alcohol ) is anything between 12,50 euros and 18,50 euros depending on where you are . 
  student pubs are cheaper , but then you need to be a student of course . . 
  700ml of absolut vodka 40 % abv is 239kr ( $ 24,80 $ 27,80 ) the cheap stuff is generally more expensive ( relatively ) than the better stuff . 
  reason for this is that systembolaget ( the state owned store that sells alcohol above 3,5 % abv ) only adds 6 % on the price they pay the maker . 
  the rest is taxes , which depend on the amount of alcohol . 
  edit : the alcohol tax on distilled alcohol ( different taxation on beer , wines and ciders ) is 511,48 kr per liter 100 % abv ( $ 59,40 ) . 
  so on the bottle of absolut the alcohol tax is 0,4 x 0,7 x 511,48 = 143,2 kr , or $ 16,6 . 
  then there 's vat added to that , which is 25 % . 
  which means that the alcohol tax stands for 179kr ( $ 20,8 ) of the 239kr . 
  * br\u00e4nnvin special * 350ml 30 % abv , 98kr ( $ 10,20 $ 11,40 ) * dworek vodka * 700ml 37,5 % abv , 193kr ( $ 20 $ 22,40 ) alcohol is expensive here . . 
  waste of money . 
  sk\u00e5ne is always a popular bet to this question . 
  although i would wager that the dialect spoken on gotland and the one spoken close to the norwegian border in j\u00e4mtland is even harder to understand . 
  hawaii is a bit special though , it 's an island that 's really really far away . 
  but if we 're talking about mainland us it 's mostly same same . 
  most of the differences are the ones that exist everywhere between rural and urban settings . 
  i would argue that there are a lot more differences between sweden and denmark than there is between the vast majority of us states . 
  and even then sweden and denmark are n't that different . 
  * \u00a7 1 all public power in sweden proceeds from the people . 
  * * the swedish democracy is founded on freedom of opinion and universal and equal suffrage . 
  it is realized through a representative and parliamentary polity and through local self-government . 
  * * the public power is exercised through the law . 
  * this is the first paragraph in the first chapter of * regeringsformen * one of four fundamental laws of sweden . 
  * regeringsformen * alone consists of 15 chapters with 8-25 paragraphs each , so it 's a pretty big document to say the least . 
  [ v\u00e4sterbottenost ] ( http://vasterbottensost.com/en/ ) a hard cheese with a quite strong flavour , can be enjoyed on a sandwich , in a pie or just as it is . 
  maybe among professionals , but the average swede still says l/mil . 
  or maybe it 's just me and the ones i know that are backwards . 
  mil is anyhow an official measurement , see `` milers\u00e4ttning '' . 
  i just realised that we are pretty weird regarding this here in sweden . 
  in recipes we use litres , decilitres , tablespoons ( = 15ml ) , teaspoons ( = 5ml ) and `` spice measure '' ( = 1ml ) . 
  for weights we mostly use grams , but kilograms can be used as well . 
  some things are bought per hectogram in the store . 
  another weird thing we do is using `` miles '' . 
  but not the imperial one , we use the `` scandinavian mile '' which equals to 10 km . 
  we measure fuel consumption in l/mile . 
  when casually talking about longer distances we speak about miles . 
  this can lead to confusion when speaking to foreigners . 
  it very much depends on where in europe you are going . 
  most countries have a national rail service that run on the major trunk lines . 
  some cross into other countries as well . 
  but as a general rule : if you want to go somewhere by train , there is only one operator .
