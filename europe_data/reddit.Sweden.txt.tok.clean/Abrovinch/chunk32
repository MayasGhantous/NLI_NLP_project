  and the operator depend on the country . 
  yes , i agree with you both . 
  i visited amsterdam for the first ( and so far the only ) time about a year ago . 
  it 's really an amazing city and doing a canal tour was well worth it . 
  i can also recommend the nautical museum if shipping is something of interest , it was really good !, 
   was there actually a `` religion b '' course ? 
  now you made me unsure , but a quick search proves that it did indeed exist : http://www.skolverket.se/laroplaner-amnen-och-kurser/gymnasieutbildning/gymnasieskola/kursplaner-fore-2011/subjectkursinfo.htm?lang=sv&amp;subjectcode=re, 
  seems more up to date than the courses i took . 
  which , if i remember correctly included maths d and e , physics b , religion a , and several courses included in my programme ( mechanical engineering ) . 
  no , the differences are only in the programmes all gymnasie-programmes end in a gymnasie-diploma . 
  many schools have both theoretical and vocational programmes . 
  it is also possible to change programmes ( although you might need an extra year in school for doing so ) . 
  if you changed your mind after completing a vocational program you can go to * komvux * `` municipal adult education '' , and take the missing courses to be able to apply for a university programme . 
  secondary school in sweden , * gymnasieskolan * , consists of 18 national programmes . 
  they are pretty well defined in what they should include , but there are some local variations . 
  6 of the programmes are suited for further education at university and include courses that will be beneficial for specific university educations . 
  for example the technical programme is tailored for those who want to study engineering at university , while the economical programme is for those who want to study economics later on . 
  the other 12 programmes are vocational and gives opportunity for work direct after the * gymnasium * . 
  examples are manufacturing , electrical work , restaurant work , front of house at hotels , agriculture etc. 
  all students who chooses one of these programmes have the right to chose the courses that are required for basic admittance to university . 
  however many university programmes require a very specific set of courses that really requires you to chose the tailored programme . 
  of course it 's always possible to take the missed courses afterwards . 
  all programmes include a basic set of courses in english , history , physical education and health , mathematics , science studies , social studies , swedish , and religion . 
  each programme also include a diploma project , and the vocational programmes have work-placed learning .

  yeah , i think most of us do . 
  partly because it 's just not worth the hassle to exchange them back , and partly because they can serve as a memory from the trip . 
  i. . . what ? 
  luckily , `` our '' mosquitoes does n't carry any diseases that they tend to do in those places . 
  they 're just a big pain in the ass really . 
  counting mosquito bites makes for a `` great '' competition in the summer . 
  i can easily get 20-30 in one evening when outside at a place where they exists in numbers . 
  could be different spieces , i 'm not sure . 
  but also , sweden is n't really that could in the summer either . 
  there are loads of mosquitoes here . 
  the governement even has to `` bomb '' a specific spot near * dal\u00e4lven * where people almost ca n't go outside during parts of the summer . 
  most mosquitoes are in the northern parts of the country , which pretty much is all wildlife , with loads of streams . 
  now that it 's starting to get colder again , none really . 
  but in the summer , fucking mosquitoes ... and the occasional wasp . 
  do n't know how it is in other countries , but if you start to look into how sverigedemokraterna here lays down their budget and what policies that are coming from them you quickly realise that if they were to run the country we would quite easily be in deep shit . 
  i obviously do n't have any in my wallet , but i found some coins lying around . 
  * spain : 5 ( have n't been to spain in like 13 years ) * germany : 4 * france : 2 * austria : 2 * netherlands : 2 * italy : 1 would have expected to at least have some from finland tbh . 
  in office jobs `` flex-time '' is very common in sweden . 
  that is you can come in to work any time between 0700 and 0900 . 
  depending on when you come in you leave at 1600-1800 , 8 hour work + 1 hour lunch is the norm . 
  there are workplaces experimenting with 6-hour work days and/or are even more flexible regarding to hours and where to work . 
  other jobs of course have very strict working schedules . 
  edit : according to statistics only 1 % of the swedish workforce work more than 50 hours in a week , oecd average is 13 % . 
  so we got that going for us . 
  yes , here 's an example [ texas longhorn ] ( http://www.texaslonghorn.se/restaurant/ostermalm/dinner/ ) which is a chain that exist all over sweden . 
  the prices are in sek ( $ 1 is about 8.5 sek ) . 
  [ lunch menu ] ( http://www.texaslonghorn.se/restaurant/ostermalm/lunch/ ) scroll with the arrows . 
  we can also play this game !, 
  the `` rule '' is , if you can hold the door without stopping you shall hold the door . 
  if you have to stop the person you are holding it to will probably start to run , which just is n't cool . 
  yes , on public transport one should keep quiet , and if you are going to have a conversation keep it down . 
  it 's available at larger ica stores ( kvantum ) in more southern areas as well . 
  but yeah , it 's much more common in the north . 
  we do that as well , but in certain settings . 
  such as at a party , or in the fika-room at the office etc. 
  then you have made yourself available for a conversation . 
  if i 'm on the bus i want to be left alone . 
  why start a conversation if there 's nothing to talk about ? 
  i have other things on my mind , having a conversation for no reason is just time consuming and none of us will gain anything from it . 
  as for holding doors , that is not uncommon if the person you holding it for may need help with the door . 
  for example if the person is carrying lots of grocery bags , pushing a stroller , is elderly etc. 
  if the person is able to open the door by him/herself it could almost be seen as rude to hold the door , why would n't they be able to do it themselves ? 
  another thing to think about is that we generally do n't depend on each other in the same way as in the u.s. everyone is insured by the government , everyone makes a fair wage etc. 
  eat surstr\u00f6mming , maybe ? 
  or dance [ sm\u00e5 grodorna ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=on9plzly0ww ) on midsummer 's eve . 
  it is a fine idea , but i think that we are to different for it to work . 
  we in the nordic countries for instance love our nordic model of economics , and want to decide what 's best for us in the future as well . 
  this is part of the reason that we choose to stay out of the euro here in sweden . 
  our economic status depends largely on exports , and thus we want to be in control of our currency . 
  also , the eu has tried to decide things for us that we believe those in brussels have no clue on whatsoever . 
  i remember when they tried to regulate the hunting of wolves here , we need to hunt wolves in order to protect other animals at our farms . 
  we already have our own regulations that sort of works . 
  another thing they are trying to do is to ban some of the typical flavouring we have in our [ snus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/snus ) . 
  snus is a very big cultural thing in sweden , hence we have an eu exemption and are allowed to sell it here . 
  but the eu still tries to regulate so that we simply can not manufacture it any more . 
  generally i 'm all for eu , but our cultural differences are just way to large for a united states of europe to work . 
  it is generally the large countries and those with former soviet influences who are in favour of a more federalized eu . 
  us smaller nations have come to the realisation that we mostly will have nothing to say about regulations and politics in a federalized europe . 
  we do also take pride in our uniqueness and think that being small is a very positive thing . 
   the only way to have a more federalized eu . 
  serious question , why is this something to strive for ? 
  my personal , and that of the vast majority of people in the nordic countries , is that the eu should be about free trade and movement , and passing laws that makes it easier for the average citizen . 
  example of the latter is the abolished roaming charges . 
  but other things should be decided by each sovereign state . 
  when people are starting to talk about a eu military command hq , direct taxes and more power to brussels i get scared . 
  it 's pretty sad , especially since we were fairly close together in the eu , sharing many opinions about what the eu should , and should not be . 
  that 's actually a myth that origins from a play in paris 1833 , so not true . 
  the majority is still in support of the monarchy . 
  there is a swedish republican association , but they only have about 11 000 members . 
  i do n't see our monarchy going anywhere soon . 
  already had a fika at around 10 , looking forward to some more at 14 !, 
  on the same note , when honda introduced the jazz ( fit in some countries ) they were first going to call it `` fitta '' , which is literally means pussy , with the slogan being `` small on the outside , big on the inside '' . 
  especially when also told you where to go . 
  `` group 6 at the tree '' . 
  some swedish words that have a different meaning in english : * `` slut '' - `` the end '' * `` fart '' - `` speed '' * `` bad '' - `` a bath '' * `` bra '' - `` good '' * `` sex '' - well , this actually means sex , but it 's also used for the number 6 .
