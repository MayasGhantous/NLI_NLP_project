  north-eastern u.s has a population density a little higher than poland . 
  while at the same time the part of sweden where i live ( norrbotten county far up north ) has a population density of 2.5 people / km ^ 2 . 
  if norrbotten county would be a state in the u.s only two other states would have a lower pop density , wyoming and alaska . 
  norrbotten county is the same size as the state of indiana . 
  most cities here are very young , you could probably find more old buildings in som cities in the u.s. . we do n't have good train services ( one night train service to stockholm ) , so we need to go by plane or car . 
  might have been a bit of a rant this , but my point is that sometimes i feel i 'm the one on the `` american side '' of that catch phrase , even though i very much live in europe :p, 
  norwegians are always happy , likes fish and have a lot of money . 
  finns have a knife and can be found in the sauna . 
  and sisu . 
  danes ca n't speak properly . 
  that 's the joke , we are homogeneous . 
  so how can we at the same time be swedistan ? 
  also , no not socialist according to the definition here , most are social democrats , one way or an other . 
  comes up quite often . 
  both parts of the statement is pretty stupid to me , everything is about context . 
  that 100 miles ( 160km ) is supposed to be really far . 
  it is n't . 
  do n't forget that we 're also homogeneous !, 
  so much to chose from , but i 'll go for `` swedistan '' . 
  honourable mentions : socialists always cold and dark for europe in general : the whole `` 100 miles '' - thingy . 
  that 's because sweden has temporary ( well , temporary for quite some time ) passport controls when entering from denmark or germany ( i think ) . 
  this is due to the immigration crisis . 
  there are no passport controls when entering from norway or finland , nor when exiting sweden . 
  this has been in effect since last november . 
  you should have gotten the information when booking the tickets . 
  yeah , there 's approximately 4000 speakers of yiddish in sweden today . 
  the reasoning behind making it a minority language was to make sure it would n't vanish as it was deemed culturally important . 
  yiddish has been spoken in sweden since the end of the 1700s . 
  do n't know if it 's the same in the countries you listed , but a room in sweden is at leas 7 sqm large with access to direkt sunlight and is n't a kitchen or hygiene room ( bathroom etc. ) . 
  half rooms are n't really defined ( as far as i know ) , but alcoves are usually counted as half rooms . 
  swedish is the official main language . 
  to that there are five recognized minority languages , these are finnish , sami , romani , yiddish and me\u00e4nkieli . 
  these languages are recognized as historically important and should be preserved . 
  people speaking any of these languages are however not entitled to use their language when in contact with authorities . 
  some municipalities do however grant people speaking finnish , sami or me\u00e4nkieli the right to use their language when in contact with local authorities . 
  svt ( the public broadcasting studio ) also covers news and some other programming in these three languages .

  no , american history is touched upon in elementary school ( ages 1-9 ) , but not really in high school ( gymnasium here ) .

  you can use the same car , but the lights needs to be reconfigured . 
  this is because the headlights on a car lights up the road asymmetrical , meaning you get more light on the right side if you drive on the right and vice versa . 
  for a short visit this can be done by adding som stickers to the side with the `` longer light '' . 
  this one is quite recent ( 1981 ) , but is interesting , and could have led to a war with the soviet union . 
  i 'm talking about [ whiskey on the rocks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_submarine_s-363 ) . 
  one late tuesday evening in october of 1981 a soviet submarine , armed with nuclear wapons , went aground in the archipelago near karlskrona naval base . 
  the submarine was discovered by two local fishermen in the morning after . 
  they contacted the swedish navy , which did n't believe the reports , but went to investigate anyway . 
  the patrol ship * hms smyge * was first to arrive and laid anchor next to the submarine . 
  the commander of hms smyge climbed aboard the submarine and managed to make contact with the commander ( they had to communicate in german ) . 
  according to the soviet commander the navigation equipment on board was `` kaputt '' and that soviet tugs would come and pull it afloat . 
  however , the swedes naturally said `` no way '' , the ball was rolling . 
  two recon fighters from sweden did indeed spot soviet ships on their way to the stricken sub . 
  among the ships were modern frigates . 
  later that evening the soviets asked for permission to send four ships to rescue the sub , again the swedes said `` nope '' . 
  the swedish prime minister told the swedish command to keep te soviets away with what they got . 
  the problem was that at the time they really did n't have that much in that specific area . 
  the coastal battery , which was the main defence weapon was missing its fire control system due to maintenance !, 
  luckily they did manage to get a new fire control system , one which was very modern and mobile , in place by the evening . 
  the personell at the battery followed the soviet ships advance towards the border . 
  '' * 1000 meters , three minutes !, 
  * '' was called out and the mood was tense in the control room . 
  the next call out was '' * 700 meters , two minutes !, 
  '' , and at about that time the major in charge thought '' * we are probably at war now * '' . 
  the decision was made to put the battery into war-mode , which included changing the radio operations into frequency-hopping , a feature that at the time was n't allowed to be used in peacetime in sweden . 
  within a minute after that the soviet ships had stopped , just outside the border . 
  apparently they sent out a transmission saying that something was n't right and that they were waiting for new orders . 
  the soviets did try to make a dash with a tug the day after , but it was stopped by the swedish sub * hms neptun * . 
  swedish * j\u00e4gare * , basically swedish commandos/rangers , were guarding the sub at all times as well . 
  they also had the commander , who liked to stand on the tower of the sub , in a sniper sight at all times . 
  if anything were to happen they would board the ship . 
  more soviet ships were arriving at the border , and they planned to take the sub by force at 03.00 the next night . 
  however the attack was called off at 02.30 the same night . 
  the reason is supposed to be that sweden has had the time to mobilize a much larger force at the site at that time . 
  in the end swedish tugs got the soviet sub afloat again and it was escorted to the border . 
  wiki article : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_submarine_s-363 a short film made by the swedish military shows how it looked at the site : https://vimeo.com/11072021, 
  that would actually be a pretty good salary here . 
  average salary would be around $ 38,000 , in which case you would have a total income tax rate of about 23 % . 
  there are however a lot of things to take into consideration when comparing taxes , and salaries . 
  are couples taxed different ? 
  ( here everyone is taxed as an individual ) . 
  is it common to be a `` stay at home mom '' . 
  what is the actual cost of living . 
  and most important , what do you get for your taxes ? 
  regarding the taxes . 
  yes it is true that the corporate tax is very low ( lower than the u.s if i 'm not misinformed ) , and that the vat mostly is 25 % . 
  the reply in income taxes is wrong though , the system is very progressive . 
  you are at an income tax rate of 30 % at $ 63450 per year , which is n't that bad to be honest . 
  the freedom of expression is defined in one of the fundamental laws . 
  it 's a rather long document but basically it says that every swede has the right to express their thoughts and views freely . 
  the government can not preview any material that is to be printed or transmitted over radio , tv , internet etc. 
  you also have the right to remain anonymous . 
  now , i guess you actually were more interested about `` hate-speech '' , right ? 
  * short translation : he who in a statement or in another statement that is spread , threatens or expresses contempt against ethnic group , or other constellation of people based on race , colour of skin , national or ethical origin , faith or sexual orientation , is to be sentenced for * hets mot folkgrupp * to prison up to two years , or if the crime is trifling , to fines . 
  what it means is that in order for you to get in trouble you must make statements that incite violence , and are made for a public audience . 
  i think it 's good , and very reasonable .
