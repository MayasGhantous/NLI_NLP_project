  there 's so much to see , great nature , cities full of life 24/7 etc. 
  there is no denying that a lot of great entertainment comes from the us , such as blockbuster movies , music ( bruce springsteen is one of my favourite artists ) . 
  americans are generally very friendly as well , when meeting them one on one . 
  so in short , i really like visiting america and americans . 
  but i do under no circumstances want to live there and some of their world views are ... interesting . . 
  pernilla karlsson is actually finnish , but her mother tongue is swedish . 
  she sings in [ `` finland swedish '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finland_swedish ) , a special dialect of swedish . 
  edit : but i agree , it 's a nice song !, 
  the idea is that wages , and other terms and conditions regarding the workplace is something that should be decided between the employer and employees . 
  it is not the governments job to get involved in these things , which funnily enough sounds very american in a way . . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saltsj\u00f6baden_agreement, 
  it should also be mentioned that wages are individual , the collective agreement only states the minimal wages and increase over time . 
  [ h\u00f6ga kusten ] ( http://www.hogakusten.com/en/hk.html ) , [ \u00d6land ] ( https://www.oland.se/en ) and [ lappland ] ( http://www.swedishlapland.com ) is a good start . 
  i would also recommend [ uppsala ] ( http://www.destinationuppsala.se/en/ ) if you are in the stockholm area , it 's just a 40 minuets train ride north and it 's the 4th largest city in sweden with some great culture and history . 
  i 'll give it a go .

  the answer is simple : no one gives a damn . 
  many people here are pretty negative towards israel , but that 's due to their policys , not the people or the jewish culture . 
  that 's very interesting to hear actually . 
  they always work here in sweden , i mean sure you wo n't get green right away but if you do n't press the button you will never get a green signal . 
  i 've just assumed it 's the same everywhere . 
  i think you underestimate how difficult it is to get a citizenship , as well as do n't understand the whole asylum process . 
  first of all , everyone has the right to apply for asylum in any country . 
  well , should have according to the refugee convention from 1951 , signed by 144 countries . 
  this convention also states that no one who is at risk of their health or freedom is to be sent back to their country . 
  some countries have been more popular than others for seeking asylum . 
  sweden , where i live , has been making headlines as a country which has been very popular . 
  reason for that being that unlike many other countries we gave permanent residency to those who were accepted . 
  but let 's not get ahead of ourselves . 
  so someone is at the border and says they 're seeking asylum , first thing that happens is the police hands them over to the swedish migration agency . 
  the migration agency will then start an investigation where they want to find out two things . 
  has this person been registered in another eu-country before ? 
  is this person in need of protection ? 
  due to the recent crisis in the middle east the migration board has been swamped with investigations to make , meaning waiting time have gone up . 
  during the investigation to asylum seeker is placed in an asylum camp . 
  if the decision is made that the person is in need of asylum ( 50 % of all decisions this far in 2016 have been granted asylum ) they will get a temporarily residency , valid for three years . 
  if they still need asylum after three years it can be extended . 
  it can also be made into a permanent residency if the person is able to support himself , as in get a job . 
  for citizenship you first need a permanent residency , and have lived at least 5 consecutive years in sweden . 
  if you have committed a crime you may still be able to get a citizenship , but you need to wait way longer . 
  for people not seeking asylum it is already very hard to get residency ( which is still needed to get citizenship ) . 
  most immigration is from family reunions , which also have a set of rules . 
  edit : also , why should we let people subjectively make decisions that will impact another human beings life ? 
  that 's not how a modern civilization works . 
  as a university student i receive money four weeks from csn , which is the government agency for handling student allowance and loans . 
  it is split up in $ 328 every four weeks in allowance and a further $ 825 in loan every four weeks . 
  the money is used for rent , food , leisure , beer etc. 
  tuition is free . 
  to that i also receive another $ 150 in housing contribution from f\u00f6rs\u00e4kringskassan , the state agency responsible for many of the different contributions in the swedish welfare . 
  this is because my rent is relatively high and i do n't work on the side since i 'd rather spend my time on the studies ( and beer when i 'm not ) . 
  when finished i will have about $ 37k i student debt to csn . 
  the payback time is depending on how much money i will make . 
  the interest of the loan is 0.6 % at the moment . 
  when i have graduated my pay check will be about $ 3600/month , of which i get to keep $ 2700 after taxes and fees to the church and unemployment fund . 
  when i was born i was automatically registered in the swedish church ( this has since changed ) and ca n't be bothered to leave since i think they do a good job at preserving the old church-buildings and a few other things , though i 'm not religious one bit . 
  my pay check will increase to between $ 4600 and $ 5800 eventually , of which ( if nothing else changes until then ) i get to keep $ 3300 to $ 3850 after income taxes . 
  will probably get a big loan when buying an apartment/house . 
  swedes are generally in a lot of debt . 
  in school it 's british english , but since so much of the media is american english most people end up with a mix of both . 
  same here . 
  well to be fair , it was the danes that started the war when we took what is now the southernmost parts of sweden . 
  we were already at war elsewhere when the danish king thought it would be a good idea to attack . 
  but thanks to the cold winter the belts in denmark were frozen , so the swedish army were able to march across it and thus took the `` back door '' into the heart of denmark . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dano-swedish_war_ ( 1657 -- 58 ) sweden and denmark has gone to war 11 times since 1521 , if you count the ones before that the number rises to about 30 . 
  yeah , it 's a fair point . 
  i 'm just a bit bit biased as i live far up north . 
  to be fair , last time denmark had anything even remotely close to 75 cm of snow has to be a very very long time ago . 
  sweden is n't some islamic rape-paradise with sharia laws . 
  ( probably not common , but common enough on reddit ) 2 . 
  far from everyone is blonde , but i guess blondes are more common in the nordics than in many other parts of the world . 
  the whole socialism thing , sure we have a lot of social policies and great wlefare , but we are not in any way limited by it . 
  we actually have a lot of economic freedom . 
  the ability to choose in almost every case , including private healthcare . 
  weather is extremely varied . 
  winters are cold and filled with snow in the north , but are actually very rainy and grey in the southern parts of the country . 
  summers can be very hot in the whole country . 
  not a misconception , but rather something many may not realise . 
  sweden is very elongated . 
  if you start in malm\u00f6 , which is on the southern tip , stockholm is only about 1/4th of the way to the northernmost tip . 
  yet that is the part most think about when talking about sweden . 
  and some things that are very true indeed : yes , we love food packaged like toothpaste , as well as odd seafood . 
  fika is an institution not to be messed with . 
  we do n't like to talk to strangers and can be very cold to people we just met , personal space is to be respected att all times . 
  one guy on the internet = / = all the people on one continent . 
  yes , there is . 
  most american restaurants here are themed around bbq and big steaks . 
  and of course hamburgers , not just fast food ones . 
  short answer : it depends . 
  long answer : first of all you have the right to defend yourself , but you may only use the force necessary . 
  example : if someone breaks into you house , or was invited as a guest and does n't want to leave you have the right to use the force necessary to make them leave . 
  that does not include shooting them like in a western film though . 
  you as a citizen also have the right to arrest someone who commits a crime , or you saw commit a crime and is fleeing the site . 
  you are however not required to do so , and sometimes it may be better to not for personal safety etc. 
  if you catch a criminal police should be brought to the spot as quickly as possible . 
  *  he whom without permission takes what belongs to someone else with intention to keep it as his is sentenced , if the action means damage , for theft to prison at most two years . 
  *  is the crime in 1 \u00a7 with regards to the value and other circumstances regarding the crime to be seen as minor shall for pilferage be sentenced fines or prison at most 6 months * 4 \u00a7 \u00c4r brott som i 1 \u00a7 s\u00e4gs att anse som grovt , skall f\u00f6r grov st\u00f6ld d\u00f6mas till f\u00e4ngelse , l\u00e4gst sex m\u00e5nader och h\u00f6gst sex \u00e5r . 
  *  is the crime in 1 \u00a7 to be seen as grand , shall for grand larceny be sentenced to prison for at least 6 months and at most 6 years . 
   in judging if the crime is grand , it is of great interest if the crime has happened by breaking into someone 's home , if it is regarding something the victim was carrying on his person , if the offender was carrying a weapon , explosives , or other aid . 
  or if the act otherwise was of particularly dangerous or reckless character . 
  been of considerable value or caused noticeable damage . 
  hopefully my hobby translations worked out , law texts are written in a very strict swedish called * kanslisvenska * . .
