  so , anyway . 
  if someone would come an rob you of your wallet he/she would most probably be sentenced after 4 \u00a7 , to prison . 
  the offender would of course have the right to a defender . 
  the prison system is focused on rehabilitation and making sure the offender is a beter person when he/she gets out . 
  more information can be found [ here ] ( https://www.kriminalvarden.se/swedish-prison-and-probation-service/ ) on the swedish prison and probation service . 
  this is no joke , moose probably `` kills '' the most people per year here . 
  how ? 
  google.com redirects to google.se for me , suspects it 's the same for everyone else . 
  you mean like when americans say that they would be # 1 in football if they actually cared ? 
  it 's a football chant that does n't mean anything really besides being a rhyme . 
  * sassa * is n't a word , * brassa * is a nautical term , but is also used in the following context * brassa iv\u00e4g bollen * , basically kicking the ball very hard in a random direction . 
  * mandelmassa * is almond paste sassa , brassa , mandelmassa is used as an introduction to other chants . 
  when it 's used that is , it 's more of a children thin i believe . 
  ingen fara p\u00e5 taket - * no danger on the roof * = it 's going to be alright . 
  det ligger en hund begraven h\u00e4r - * there 's a dog buried around here * = something is not right . 
  bli eld och l\u00e5gor - * become fire and flames * = become super exited about something . 
  gammal som gatan - * old as the street * = something really old and antique ge igen f\u00f6r gammal ost - * retaliate for old cheese * = to retaliate for something that happened a very long time ago . 
  f\u00f6r fulla muggar - * for filled mugs * = to go at maximum speed . 
  this is an old seafarers term , mugg is used as slang for toilet in swedish and when the sailing ships went att full speed seawater rose in the toilets onboard . 
  yes , there are actually huge differences . 
  while the social democrats are big in the whole country they dominate the north . 
  the moderate party is larger in large metropolitan areas , as well as to the south . 
  the sweden democrats , who are against immigration has most of it 's voters in the southern most parts of sweden . 
  they also have larger support the inland middle part of sweden . 
  irn-bru , from scotland . 
  might as well add the extremes , which are +38.0 c ( 100f ) in the summer and -52.6 c ( -62.7 f ) in the winter . 
  i kinda like the variations between seasons here tbh . 
  riding around in open-top lorries while playing loud music and drinking beer on graduation day from secondary school ( age 15-16 to 18-19 ) . 
  this is what it looks like : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wp2l2uwwiro,

  currency can easily be converted through various websites , but one dollar is equal to 8,60 swedish krona at the moment .

  honestly , people here generally do n't give a shit about the colour of your skin . 
  seeing as you are an american you wo n't have a problem here in sweden . 
  just remember to try and integrate into the society and make an effort to learn the language . 
  sure , there 's racism in sweden , as is there anywhere else in the world . 
  but you wo n't be harassed for just being a bit brown and walking down the street . 
  as far as i 'm concerned most racism here is really just people sitting on the internet and scaremonger what they do n't understand ( islam mainly ) . 
  then there 's also a lot of discussions about the migration politics , but that only concerns refugee 's from the middle east . 
  seeing as you need to get a job or get into a school to be able to move here you are not in the group that people find problematic . 
  and most people are n't really scared of terrorist attacks ( in fact , terrorism in europe is actually very low at the moment compared to the 80 's ) . 
  all in all , do n't believe the fearmongering on the internet , europe is still a very open and friendly place to both live and visit . 
  as long as you do n't commit any serious crimes and such you will be just fine . 
  i think that 's a question which is impossible to answer since it pretty much comes down to personal taste . 
  thankfully beer from around the world is very easily available here . 
  i quite like a typical english bitter as well as a czech pilsner , or a belgian ale . 
  there are so many possibilities !, 
  but sometimes you just want to be part of this [ pripps commercial ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uu2om92dri ) , even though pripps is pretty bad . . 
  i have a passport , a drivers license and a student id . 
  i only use the passport when travelling abroad . 
  the student id is only used to claim discounts , mainly fast food chains are interested in seeing the card . 
  i was once carded on a train when travelling on a student discount ticket as well , but most of the time they just trust you . 
  for anything else i use the drivers license . 
  although i feel like i only need it when i need to prove my age in getting in at a bar or buying alcohol from [ systembolaget ] ( http://www.systembolaget.se/english/ ) i use my drivers license when voting as well . 
  it is possible to vote without an id here in sweden , but it requires someone else to certify that it 's actually you and they need to show an id . 
  of course i also have the drivers license on me whenever i 'm driving , but the last time i had to show it to an officer was probably 6-7 years ago . 
  well . . first and foremost you need to be a swedish citizen and at least 18 years old . 
  then you must pass some tests , physical and psychological . 
  no college/university benefits , that 's already included in the citizenship , i.e free ... 
  mostly card games with various rules , often made up by ourself . 
  but a basic game is that you put all cards face down on the table , and when it 's your turn you pick a card . 
  different cards have different meanings , 2-10 might mean the number of chugs where red is for you and black is for someone of your choice . 
  jack might be a rule , for instance no use of names , if you say someone 's name you drink . 
  queen might be ladies , and king guys . 
  ace is often a `` waterfall '' , meaning everyone drinks and they might not stop until the person on their right stops . 
  other games include `` matt damon '' , for this you need at least two big plastic cups and a number of bottle caps . 
  two persons get one cup each , it does n't matter who . 
  however the cups should be halfway around from each other . 
  the persons with the cups each place one cap in the palm of their hand , and by hitting the underside of the table with the top of their fingers they will try to get the cap to fly into the cup . 
  if you miss you keep trying until you hit . 
  if you hit you move the cup to the person on your left , unless if you hit on your first try , then you can choose to say `` matt damon '' and move it to the person on your right . 
  if you end up with both cups in front of you , you 've lost this round and will have to drink an arbitrary amount of beer/whatever that the group has decided on . 
  it may sound simple , but it 's really stressful when you have a cup in front of you and the second one is closing in . 
  for a greater challenge a third cup may be added if the group is big enough . 
  there 's no winners , only losers in this game . 
  then i agree with you . 
  i too prefer the italian style pizza , but the day after a rough night out few thing beat a swedish-style pizza . 
  toppings include , but are not limited to : bacon , pineapple , banana , curry , nacho-chips , fries , peanuts , eggs , as well as all sorts of ham , seafood steak etc. 
  basically it 's anything . 
  i 'm a bit curios to what you mean by the `` classic ones '' ? 
  considering most swedish pizzerias ( at least the ones i usually go to ) have somewhere between 60 and 90 different toppings on their pizzas . 
  if you mean like an italian pizza you need to go to a bit more upscale place , unfortunately . 
  most pizzerias here are run by non-natives , mainly turks and from the balkans . 
  one thing to keep in mind is that while we are n't religious , we do love our churches and ceremonies . 
  many are still getting married in a church , and many are baptised . 
  it should also be noted that we swedes are pretty tolerant towards religion ( for the most prat that is , and it 's less true towards islam ) . 
  so we are n't hardcore atheists either . 
  we take the nice stuff , like weddings , churches and so on , and do n't give a damn about the other stuff . 
  yeah , nothing worse than you germans placing your towels on the deck chairs by the pool at 05.35 in the morning . . 
  volvo 240 is actually longer than a bmw 7-series from the mid 80s, 
  still feel like i live in one of the safest places in the world . 
  there are some bad neighbourhoods , where they sometimes set fire to a car and throw rocks . 
  that 's bad for sure , but there 's no looting , no one is firing guns ( these kids do n't have any guns ) etc. 
  the main problem with these neighbourhoods is n't immigration per se . 
  but rather poor city planning and segregation . 
  it has absolutely nothing to do with islamisation . 
  then we have the rapes . 
  i do hate rapist , and every rape is one to many , let 's make that clear .
