  ah yes , [ br\u00e4nnboll ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/br\u00e4nnboll ) , for extra fun each team may be allowed a cheat !, 
  that 's why the u.s healthcare system is so efficient and cost saving , right ? 
  / s edit : really though , the u.s actually spend more dollars per capita on public funded healthcare than almost any european country , and you still do n't cover everyone ... 
  i 've had the same experience in more southern areas as well . 
  but to be fair , i have n't really had that much contact with the healthcare services , thankfully . 
  there are other problems up here though , norrbotten county being the largest in sweden by size ( about the size of kentucky for any americans reading this ) , but at the same time very sparsly populated with only 250k inhabitants . 
  no swedish summer is complete without [ kubb !, 
  ah yes , the classic `` but taxes ! '' - argument . 
  here 's a fact . 
  sweden has among the highest taxes in the world ( 45,8 % of gdp ) , but to give it a fair chanse we need to figure out how it works . 
  so , let 's say you make $ 3700/month , but your employer needs to pay payroll-taxes on that , which is 31,4 % . 
  this means you cost the employer $ 4860 , but your taxable income is still $ 3700 , and that 's all that really matters for you as an employee . 
  now , sweden has marginal taxes etc. 
  as amany other countries ( including the u.s ) . 
  but in this case the effective income tax-rate for you is about 24,2 % ( it depends on where you live in the country , but the difference is not that big ) . 
  24,2 % income tax is n't that bad to be honest . . 
  but of course there are other taxes , capital gains is 30 % of revenue , however there are no property taxes ( but there is a municipal fee ) , or inheritance . 
  corporate tax is 22 % . 
  you actually pay most of your taxes while shopping , vat is 25 % on most things not considered essential ( like food , that is 12 % , or travelling within sweden , and books , and newspapers , all of that is 6 % ) and tax on things considered harmful , like alcohol and tobacco . 
  but the most important thing is this : no one has ever gone bankrupt from paying their taxes , but people have gone bankrupt from healthcare costs in the u.s, 
  yeah , better to stop at a petrol station , or even along the road and pee into the ditch . . 
  about swedish healthcare . 
  sweden is divided into 20 countys , and it 's the county that 's responsible for healthcare and the insurance of its inhabitants . 
  this means that there are some variations throughout the country . 
  but generally speaking a visit to the er will cost you about 100 sek . 
  when you reach 1100 sek over a 12-month period you do n't have to pay the fees for the reminder . 
  the same is also true if you reach 2200 sek for prescription drugs . 
  there is also a lot of private health care in sweden . 
  however most of it is operated in the same way as the county hospitals/clinics . 
  meaning it 's funded through the countys and you do n't pay anything extra just because it 's private . 
  also , according to law you have the right to choose your `` home clinic '' , so in that regard there is healthy competition here . 
  there exists some private healthcare that is n't funded by the countys as well . 
  and because of that there also exists private health insurance . 
  these cost between 90 and 450 sek/month for someone who is about 35 years old , the price is dependant on what 's included . 
  now , because healthcare is run by the counties , there are differences in waiting times etc. 
  i for instance have never had any real problems booking a general appointment at a clinic , usually i can go there the next day . 
  at the er it depends on the severity of your condition ( of course ) , waiting times there varies from zero up to a few hours for non-important issues . 
  but yes , queues exists , but at least there is a political consensus to try and shorten the waiting times . 
  i have never had issues with healthcare personell not caring or being unfriendly . 
  also if a person working at a hospital/clinic/whatever sees something that could even potentially be dangerous or bad for the patient , they are obliged by law to report it to the national board of health and welfare . 
  and lastly , there is a phone number , run together by the counties , that you can call 24/7 and talk to a nurse at no extra cost than a normal phone call . 
  you can also access it on the web att [ 1177 . se ] ( http://www.1177.se ) , which is nice as you could do some self-assessment from home without doing some dodgy google-searches all saying you got cancer , ebola and probably aids , at the same time . . 
  it 's mostly toilettes in accessible places and without being under supervision from someone that cost money . 
  i think it 's to keep them more clean and not make them a place where shady people meet and/or sleep . 
  granted they are a big cost to the city being in charge of them , they are cleaned several times a day etc. 
  free toilettes are often available at departement stores , restaurants , petrol stations etc. 
  that 's not really how it works though . 
  if a person walks in to the police and say `` person x raped me !, 
  '' , there will be an investigation . 
  they will interrogate the notifier , and bring in the accused for interrogation ( as well as do other investigations ) . 
  they will probably come to the conclusion that person x can not be arrested , so he/she is set free after the interrogation . 
  and lastly the case will be dismissed . 
  in the statistics he 's just a number , not a name . 
  and proven innocent , nobody really has to know , you wo n't end up with a criminal record just for being a suspect . 
  i can do a write-up late when i have more time . 
  in the mean time however , swedish criminal statistics is open for everyone , and is continently available in english as well . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.bra.se/bra/bra-in-english/home.html ) however , it is very important to keep in mind that what is and what is n't a specific crime varies a lot between different countries . 
  and that a statistic change over one year is n't enough to make a safe conclusion . 
  sweden : [ blocket ] ( https://www.blocket.se/hela_sverige?q=&amp;cg=1020&amp;w=3&amp;st=s&amp;ps=&amp;pe=&amp;mys=&amp;mye=&amp;ms=&amp;me=&amp;cxpf=&amp;cxpt=&amp;fu=&amp;gb=&amp;ca=1_9&amp;is=1&amp;l=0&amp;md=th ) both dealers and private persons advertise through blocket . 
  keep in mind that the mileage shown is scandinavian miles , where 1 mile = 10 km . 
   ah , has to be kicking russian ass in the second war  should have recognized that given that it 's the favorite latvian period of being under swedish rule . 
  are you thinking of the battle of narva ? 
  that was in 1700 . 
  1658 was when we marched over the belts towards the danish capital . 
  result still visible today is that the provinces of scania , blekinge and halland are swedish and not danish . 
  [ link ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/march_across_the_belts )  1766 , relatable to today , after stormaktstiden ... tryckfriheten ? 
  yes , that is correct . 
  maybe not extremely well known , but something important and being brought to light now that it 's been 250 years today . 
   no , my idea is the 1974 regeringsformen , that 's one of the basic significant things i learn after coming to sweden . 
  perhaps it 's not something locals think about so much ? 
  ah , yes , you 're right . 
  however i think that abbas victory in eurovision is more well known , 
   1523 - gustav vasa becomes king correct  1658 - end of stormaktstiden perhaps ? 
  no , stormaktstiden ended in 1711 . 
  hint : it 's a very famous swedish victory . 
   1766 - ended wars with danskj\u00e4veln ? 
  no , this one is actually very relatable to the life of today . 
   1809 - lost finland this is correct . 
   1814 - union with norway ? 
  yes , and also the last time sweden went to war ( which was what i had in mind ) the union ended in 1905 . 
   1967 - dagen h also correct . 
   and where is 1974 ? 
  thinking about abba ? 
  sweden : 1523\u00a01658\u00a01766\u00a01809 1814 1967, 
  i live by myself in an apartment that is about 50 sqm , smallest i lived in was 28 sqm . 
  largest i 've lived in was a house which was about 230 sqm in a semi-urban location . 
  average in sweden is 42 sqm per person . 
  yes , i do live in lule\u00e5 , and i moved from the south for studies . 
   afaik there 's no actual midnight sun there but there 's no real `` night '' either from early may until late july , am i right ? 
  yes , that 's exactly how it is . 
  the sun is under the horizon for a few hours ( on the longest day about 50 minuets ) , but since it 's just under the horizon it never gets really dark . 
  now for instance , when looking north at midnight you still se the light from the sun against the sky . 
   i 'm very fascinated by the life up there . 
  how is it ? 
  what 's the stereotype associated with that area ? 
  life here is pretty much according to the typical swedish stereotype . 
  there is a stereotype for the typical northerner , which is someone who talks slowly , wears a flannel shirt , distills his own liqueur ( which is illegal in sweden ) and is generally a bit negative about modernities . 
  that 's the stereotype , and while there is som truth to it ( as there is with all stereotypes ) lule\u00e5 is pretty normal for a medium sized swedish city . 
  the differences comes from the climate and the fact that the distances are much larger for us living in the north . 
  the only really viable option to get to stockholm for instance is by plane .
