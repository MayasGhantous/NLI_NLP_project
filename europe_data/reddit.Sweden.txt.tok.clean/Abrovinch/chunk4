  next thing to look at , life expectancy : ukraine : 70.8 years , vietnam : 76.0 years , nigeria : 54.5 years . 
  nigerias birthrate will sink when quality of life improves , not the other way around . 
  that 's the way it has worked for every other country in the world . 
  seriously , [ do n't panic !, 
  ] ( http://www.gapminder.org/videos/dont-panic-the-facts-about-population/ ), 
  and now look at infant mortality rate , ukraine : 8/1000 , vietnam : 17.8 / 1000 and nigeria : 71.2 / 1000 . 
  whenever the quality of life has risen , the birthrate has gone down . 
  seriously , spend an hour and watch [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fack2knc08e ), 
  you are correct about the hydro power , however that will not be expanded . 
  biomass is n't really used in electricity production , but rather heating , in the industry and transport . 
  wind power is big in sweden , it 's the third largest production method at around 10 % of the total . 
  it is also being expanded heavily , [ graph ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/vindkraft_i_sverige#/media/file:vindprod_1990-2014.jpg ) . 
  installed capacity is 6518 mw , another 751 mw is under construction , another 12 262 mw have been approved for construction and another 8 810 mw is in legal process . 
  by 2020 the production is expected to have risen by 20-25 % . 
  tl ; dr sweden is very much into wind power . 
  sweden has a high percentage from nuclear , generally between 40 and 45 % of the total . 
  98 % is fossil free and sweden is a net exporter of electricity . 
  i guess that the bulk of all the plants are pretty small and that day to day operation is remote controlled , that 's how it work here . 
  i 'm referring to volvo 's market . 
  26 % of all volvos sold in western europe are sold in sweden . 
  volvo is probably way more interested in growing in china and the us compared to mainland europe . 
  you are vastly underestimating the importance of the swedish market for volvo . 
  volvo holds over 20 % of the swedish market , and it 's the big cars that sell . 
  both the s/v90 and xc60 outsells the vw golf , by 36 % and 29 % respectively for the first six months . 
  the swedish market is 26.5 % of the western european market . 
  volvo sales are up 5 % the first 6 months in sweden , and it 's by far the biggest brand . 
   volvo can afford it because their share there is basically zero i see you never have been to sweden ( second biggest market for volvo , after china ) . 
  even though i agree that the quote in the article is despicable you really should read up on eritrea and persecution . 
  it is not without reason it is often called `` the north korea of africa '' . 
  it 's easy to carbonate it yourself . 
  while the bothnia line is capable of 250 km/h no trains run faster than 200 km/h today in sweden . 
  several other stretches will be capable of 250 km/h when atc is replaced by ertms . 
  there are plans for real high speed lines with speeds of 320 km/h . 
  the first part of this network is the 150 km long `` ostl\u00e4nken '' between j\u00e4rna south of stockholm ( 250 stretch built in the 90s connect j\u00e4rna to stockholm ) and link\u00f6ping . 
  the cost for this part is calculated to 5.7 billion euros and preparatory construction work is expected to begin later this year , with the whole stretch under construction in 2021 . 
  the plan is to later on continue the line to gothenburg . 
  up until 1 1/2 years ago . 
  statistic sweden has analysed asylum seekers effect on gdp growth , and while it does affect it in a positive way it 's not by as much as some in this thread may think . 
  yes they did , up until 1 1/2 years ago when sweden pretty much pulled the plug and applications fell by more than 82 % in one year . 
  most of those who came have received their decision , and therefore most of those who will be counting towards the population already are . 
  the fact is that loads of sectors are booming in sweden right now , the national budget also showed a larger than expected surplus last year . 
  but this does n't fit the reddit agenda , and therefore i 'm downvoted . 
  i think you 're a bit dishonest here . 
  while i agree that the rate for immigrants is anything but good , it 's still higher than many other countries on that list . 
  the difference comes from natives being the second highest of all . 
  that list does n't measure employment btw . 
  if that was the main reason the other countries with high amounts of asylum seekers ( such as germany ) would be higher as well . 
  fact is that the swedish economy is actually doing very good at the moment . 
  sure , but it 's not the whole picture . 
  would n't germany be higher if that was the biggest reason ? 
  i see you did n't pay attention in school . . 
  i do n't want to derail the thread into immigration , but if you look at the actual laws regarding immigration they are not that different any more . 
  i 'd say there are other areas that we differ in more substantial ways . 
  [ ministerial rule ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ministerstyre ) for instance is a big structural difference in how our countries are ruled . 
  it 's illegal in sweden and finland , but allowed pretty much anywhere else . 
  the nordics and baltics are on the same electricity market . 
  the way the electricity flow ( and the price ) as well as each country 's production according to source , nuclear , hydro , wind , heating , and unspecified , can be seen on this [ link ] ( http://www.svk.se/drift-av-stamnatet/kontrollrummet/ ) ( in swedish , but you get the idea ) . 
  nah , the minimum wage , along with many other things are decided upon by unions and employers . 
  nearly all workplaces are unionised . 
  so a cashier for instance would follow the agreement that the union of commercial employees has . 
  as an adult without experience you then earn at least $ 14.3 / hr . 
  unions represent its members , it 's up to the employer to have an agreement . 
  and your trolling is haram , get lost . 
  if you actually listen to the politicians in charge , and `` br\u00c5 '' , who do the crime statistics , their reasoning is the one i gave you . 
  of course the opposition want a new report ( mind you , were talking about comprehensive reports here , not everyday statistics ) . 
  when it comes to legislation a lot has happened and more is happening , unfortunately the moron in charge of the police department is useless . 
  on the internet it 's very polarised in both ways , and very few actually back their claims up with facts . 
  i would n't call it `` fun '' since one of them actually killed someone ? , but yes they were . 
  if i remember correctly at least one of them had n't lived in sweden for five years at the time of the event . 
   when we began counting how many swedes there was ( 19th-century ) , we also made that mistake . 
  we thought it was almost a million swedes because there was so much land in sweden . 
  but alas it was only 200.000 and everyone was really surprised ehm , that 's not true either . . we began counting in 1749 , and then we were 1.76 million . 
  it 's us and the finns . 
  for anyone interested , it 's known as the [ sj-sound ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sj-sound ), 
  a big part of the decline is due to the eu deal with turkey . 
  also , our asylum laws got a lot stricter in the end of 2015 . 
  we now have this odd situation were the leftist dislike our policies and stand for being too strict and tearing apart families , while the far right still thinks were too liberal . 
  the reasoning behind not doing new research into natives is immigrant crime statistics is that the answer already is known . 
  immigrants are more likely to be suspects and convicted for crimes . 
  we collect other detailed facts about crimes , relations between victims , socio economic status of areas with a lot of crime , organised crime etc etc. 
  there 's so much more to look at other than the skin colour . 
  of course it could be interesting to do a follow up report to see how things have changed , but there 's little evidence that the results would differ much . 
  and if you already do know the answer , why waste resources on a new study ? 
  is n't it better to actually work on the problem ? 
   as god intended  bretty gud nice, 
  `` creepingsharia '' totally legit . 
  20550 sq km , however that 's the municipality . 
  we do n't have any smaller governing bodies here , the term `` city '' is pretty much up for your own interpretation . 
  [ obligatory ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flxxhmf8fvy ), 
  the whole idea is to make sure that the main roads and walkways and the ones that people use earliest in the morning get done first . 
  they did n't just stop preparing the roads , they made side walks a priority over smaller local streets with low traffic . 
  why ? 
  because studies has shown that there are far more injuries from people walking on unprepared side walks than people driving on snowy streets . 
  stockholm was hit pretty hard by a snow dump in november last year . 
  that 's unusually early and it is n't economically feasible to have the full snow clearing capabilities available at that time . 
  add to that all the idiots driving with summer tires and leaving their cars in the middle of the road and you get chaos . 
  the rest of the winter flowed without any major hiccups . 
  the only thing unfortunate in this story was how stockholm was trying to make a big number out of gender equality . 
  the methods have been in use for years in various swedish cities . 
   edit : ok , sometimes we just call it `` ha em '' , screw '' & ''  that 's the way we say it , `` h\u00e5 em '' , or if you want to get really formal ( and sound like an old lady ) `` hennes och mauritz '',
