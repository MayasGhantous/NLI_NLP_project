  here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/statens_institut_f\u00f6r_rasbiologi and here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/compulsory_sterilisation_in_sweden, 
  the translation ? 
  yes : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/-stan england , for example , is known as * inglistan * in urdu . 
  '' - stan '' is also pretty much interchangeable with '' - land '' used in many germanic languages , we call estonia * estland * for example . 
  as for it being ok with me , of course i do n't want to change the name of * sverige * , but i do n't find it to be the insult that the trolls want it to be . 
  especially since the '' - stan '' suffix translate into `` place of '' . 
  so , `` the place of swedes '' , sounds ok to me . . 
  snus is illegal to sell in the eu , sweden has a permanent exemption from that rule . 
  that part is from the series [ riget ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108906/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_2 ), 
  with biltemak\u00f6rv of course !, 
  i 'd recommend the `` pax '' - series , as it 's easily expanded and can be fitted in many different ways . 
  the [ original ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrunszzeg ) is made by a norwegian-irish duo , `` secret garden '' , 
   is your king cool af yes . 
  yep , it 's the difference between memorising and actually knowing what you 're doing . 
  i get that the branding as `` feminist '' triggers quite a few people . 
  but in reality it 's just a more sensible use of means for snow clearing . 
  as for the article , well of course the result was the same as always ( especially with a huge snow dump in november ) , nothing worked at all . 
  it is one of the `` weirder '' swedish dialects . . 
  it 's not like we did n't have an agreement before , we did . 
  but afghanistan decided it was no longer valid so we had to negotiate a new deal , apparently that deal has also run into some complications but at the moment we can use said eu deal as well . 
  it 's not difficult to find newspaper articles citing where deportations from norway have been turned back to norway as well , so it 's not like you hav had all smooth sailings either . 
  we 're also deporting afghans now , thanks to an agreement signed with the afghanistan government last year . 
  number of new asylum applications are down about 32 % for the first five months compared to last year . 
  2016 in turn was down 82 % compared to 2015 . 
  i see you have no clue about the swedish labour market then, 
   under the new rules , foreign drivers would be considered a `` posted worker '' - potentially meaning they would get at least the minimum wage of the country they were in - if they spent three days or more per month working away from home . 
  ok , but what if the country has no minimum wage , will they follow the collective agreement ( probably not ) ? 
  interesting , it 's known as * vitryssland * here , which directly translate into white russia . 
  ah yes , 410 newborn boys , out of 60199 , or 0.68 % , the end is truly near / s, 
  there 's something fishy with this ... 
  the average wage before taxes in sweden is sek 32 000/month ( according to statistics sweden ) , the average income tax on that is 24,3 % . 
  the tax will vary a bit since it 's paid on a municipal level , but that 's the average . 
  however , this does n't include the `` arbetsgivaravgift '' ( payroll tax ) , which is paid by the employer on top of your salary . 
  the arbetsgivaravgift is a flat rate of 31.42 % , so your cost for the employer is 32 000 + ( 0,3142 * 32000 ) = sek 42 054.4 however , you have nothing to do with the payroll tax , it 's not visible on any documents and not included when discussing wages . 
  also , keep in mind that swedish income tax is very progressive . 
  if you earn sek 24 000/month you pay 22.5 % tax if you earn sek 42 000 you pay 28.6 % at sek 55 000 you pay 34.5 % and the final example sek 100 000/month 45,2 %, 
  well , both finland and norway also have state-owned liquor stores . 
  beer is taxed lower in sweden than in finland though . 
  we do n't go to finland for booze , except for the tax-free ferries . 
  har liquor is about the same in sweden and finland , maybe about 1 euro cheaper for a 70cl bottle in finland . 
  beer on the other hand is a lot cheaper in sweden . 
  example : lagunitas ipa ( 355ml ) is 3,98 $ in finland and 2,48 $ in sweden . 
  lapin kulta ( 500 ml can ) is 2,91 $ in finland and 1,44 $ in sweden . 
  compared to what gripen ? 
  the new e/f version just premiered , and of course it 's possible to upgrade . 
  yes , loads of them . 
  i usually sauna at around 80-85 degrees , at some places the temperature has been lower though . . 
  i 've been to both mixed and single-sex saunas , nude and not nude . 
  water is always thrown at the rocks , sometimes beer though i would n't recommend that . . 
  i sauna about once a week . 
  ah , it seems i was a bit confused with the nationalrail page . 
  i was only looking at the very top where it said `` prices from 112 gbp '' , turns out that 's only the cheapest price for the actual time of the day you put into the search , very weird . 
  yes , mtr express is an alternative . 
  pro-tip for anyone looking for train tickets in sweden : [ resrobot ] ( https://kopbiljett.resrobot.se/#/ ) will let you browse and purchase tickets for all train operators , and even some coach operators and also let you order all available departures for that day by price . 
  let 's compare for thursday next week . 
  sj offers some trains that day for about 22 $ , but the vast majority for 45 $ . 
  the same day the cheapest fare on ice i could find between hamburg and frankfurt ( the distance between the cities are about the same as between stockholm and gothenburg , 384km vs 401km ) was 95 $ , and if you want a reserved seat it 's another 4.5 $ . 
  on top of that the sj service is actually quicker . 
  some other examples on thursday : london-manchester : 123 $ copenhagen - aarhus : 41 $ helsinki - turku : 23 $ paris - lyon : 45 $ madrid - barcelona : 75 $ saying that trains in sweden are ridiculously expensive seems a bit ridiculous tbh . 
  alcohol in general . 
  mass market beer is pretty expensive here , though a lot cheaper than in both norway and finland . 
  for more expensive beers the difference to say , denmark , is less pronounced . 
  train fares are relatively cheap in sweden as well , if you plan in advance you can travel between stockholm and gothenburg ( 3hr ride ) on the x2000 service for as little as 20 $ including seat reservation . 
  i mean , the handle is lockable in sweden , but with my car it 's for some reason impossible to lock it as it constantly unlocks . 
  i presume it has something to do with the pressure build up is to fast . 
  so i must hold the handle looking a bit like a fool every time i refuel . 
  was a bit off topic from your original question i think . 
  it 's different with each car . 
  i ca n't lock the handle when filling up my car ( which is very annoying during the winter . . ) , but with most other cars i have no problem here . 
  1568 km as the crow flies . 
  otherwise it 's like this north : midnight sun during the summer , very little to no sunlight in the winter . 
  actual real winters , with snow . . rich in natural resources . 
  very low population density , vast distances . 
  politically more old fashioned social democrats ( workers right , making sure the welfare works etc. 
  less interested in more `` modern '' typically left political questions . 
  also does n't exist on many maps of europe . 
  south : slushy grey winters . 
  quite populous ( more than 90 % of the population lives in the south ) , you can actually take the train when going somewhere . 
  politically diverse . 
  the west thinks norway/denmark is the closest to sweden culturally , while the east thinks finland is the closest culturally . 
  generally very good i would say . 
  speed limit low though , 110 for the most part with 120 on newly built stretches . 
  there are no tolls except for travelling through stockholm ( congestion charge ) and over some bridges . 
  the car is photographed when passing through and an invoice is sent to the owner . 
  gothenburg also have congestion charges , but you do n't enter the congestion zone when just passing through . 
  it is worth mentioning that swedish asphalt is much more coarse than in most other countries . 
  this is to negotiate the increased tear caused by studded tyres and the elements . 
  the drawback is increased road noise and increased roll resistance . 
  i 've been approached by girls at nightclubs , yes . 
  but the same is also true in reverse , even more so . 
  at caf\u00e9s you do n't approach anyone , period . 
  maybe we , and especially women , are more open about their sexuality here . 
  sexuality and gender roles are spoken about continuously from an early age . 
  in the new curriculum it 's included in pretty much every subject all the way from elementary school . 
  i 'm just speculation , but it seems like a reasonable part of the explanation . 
  though i must stress , it is far more common for men to approach women still . 
  the 10 most common surnames : * andersson * johansson * karlsson * nilsson * eriksson * larsson * olsson * persson * svensson * gustafsson first name that does n't end with - son is `` lindberg '' on spot 17 .

  the future is now . .
