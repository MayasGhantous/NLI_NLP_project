  well , the coverage only really needs to be good where people live , work and travel . 
  thus the best coverage are in cities/towns and along the transport corridors between them . 
  swedish operator claims that their network reaches 99.9 % of all swedes and 90 % of the area . 
  another thing to note regarding 4g is that we have been in the forefront adapting new network technologies, 
  slang/child language for dog ( hund ) . 
  the three v ; s of victory : volvo - villa - vovve meaning : volvo ( estate of course ) , detached house and a doggie . 
  there 's something very wrong with a government wilfully killing its own citizens . 
  i feel we have moved away from that . 
  apart from the obvious one that we 're under shakira law ( hips be upon her ! ), 
  the `` tall blue-eyed blondes '' is a bit over the top . . also , swedish cuisine is apparently shit because of surstr\u00f6mming ? 
  nothing , except when i have guests then i put on some socks . 
  malm\u00f6 has had problems for a long time , but with poverty and the unemployment has been higher than for the rest of the country for decades now . 
  add the fact that malm\u00f6 also is the gateway to europe with the \u00d6resund bridge , which means it 's the point of entry for many immigrants , but more importantly also for drugs and weapons and you have the recipe for gang related crimes . 
  yes , the roma beggars actually was a pretty big problem here one or two years ago , and has been way more intrusive into the average swedes life than immigrants from afar . 
  and swedish politicians have been , as always , been rather slow at starting to adress the situation . 
  but i feel the number of beggars is finally on the decline , personally i just ignore them . 
  not true though . 
  malm\u00f6 has a high number of murders per capita compared to other swedish , nordic , or even western european cities due to gang related activities in some parts of the city , that 's something that 's risen quite fast in the last few years actually and is of course alarming . 
  the total number of murders in sweden is pretty constant over time though . 
  now , malm\u00f6 still have less murders per capita compared with many other european cities , tallinn for example which no one really thinks of as being particularly dangerous , right ? 
  there was a link floating around stating that malm\u00f6 was the number two on a crime index list for european cities . 
  that list had nothing to do with real facts though as it only showed what 188 internet strangers thought of different european cities . 
  tl ; dr malm\u00f6 is rather high for murders for a western european city , but is far from the most dangerous city in europe . 
  no one sane is contesting the fact that immigrants are more likely to commit crimes , that is a fact politicians across the board accept ( at least here in sweden ) . 
  the disagreement lies in the reason to as why they are overrepresented . 
  violent crimes are more common among second and third generation immigrants . 
  but stating that violent crimes are more common among those low on the socio-economic ladder is equally true , or that it 's more common among men . 
  the colour of the skin is n't what makes you a criminal , but all factors combined and people from some countries are far more likely to be criminals . 
  when speaking about thefts of car parts , home break-ins etc. 
  the thieves are mostly non-swedes , but are eu-citizens . 
  lithuania in particular has been pointed out as a destination for stolen goods . 
  then we have the situation with the roma beggars , which finally is going down . 
  they are also eu citizens , and so are the irish pavers . 
  ah yes , the first step of the alcohol chain . . 
  at the moment there 's an increase in gang related violence in especially malm\u00f6 . 
  though it 's important to remember that the most likely place to be assaulted in sweden ( by far ) still is norrmalm , i.e , the center of stockholm . 
  but it 's important to remember that the rise of malm\u00f6s problem did n't happen overnight , malm\u00f6 has been in a downward spiral the last 30-40 years and is today one of the poorest municipalities in sweden . 
  i 've got a diesel with a 70 liter tank . 
  70 liters of diesel would cost me 931 sek ( 97 $ ), 
  i do n't know honestly , but maybe it 's because it 's something to gather around ( and something we are good at ) . 
  and if i may go a bit off topic :  mainland europe i know this discussion has been on here before , but i feel it needs to be said anyway . 
  sweden ( as well as norway and finland ) still is pretty much disconnected from the whole `` mainland europe '' - thing . 
  my favorite is the mountain called * sn\u00e5lkuk * , which could be translated into something like `` cheap dic/cock '' also place names in the very north are interesting , and sometimes very hard for swedes to pronounce due to sami origin . 
  they actually only have just over 16 % in sweden , though the market here is heavily influenced by volvo , which have over 20 % of the market alone . 
  both the xc60 and s/v 90 outsells the vw golf by about 30 % each . 
  at least in scandinavian languages the literal translation is `` half island '', 
  for cars , i do n't really know actually . 
  maybe porsche . 
  thing is , while bmw may `` sting '' in someones eye they are really common , if i remember correctly its the fourth most common brand overall . 
  for clothes , maybe hugo boss and ralph lauren . 
  it 's really only norway and denmark that taxes new cars crazy . 
  here in sweden you only pay normal vat , the road tax is between about 1200 to 6000 sek per year . 
  fuel prices are about the same as in the rest of europe . 
  it 's often old quarries and such that are sure into lakes . 
  i would n't bet on it since i know norwegians having trouble getting into nightclubs in sweden with that id . 
   e : also , how do you make an artificial lake ? 
  fill with water, 
  sweden has id cards ( no one use them though ) , i 'm sure norway has them as well . 
  [ swedish national id ] ( http://www.jordenrunt.nu/resa/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/nationellt-id.gif ), 
  norwegian bankcards have id on the back side , see [ pic ] ( https://ya.no/popup/_image/307.png?_encoded=2f66666666666678302f35382f&amp;_ts=14a503c16f8 ), 
  relevant [ satw ] ( https://satwcomic.com/language barrier ), 
  i feel like you 're forgetting [ something ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=v2kta9xuk3m ) . . 
  there 's one urban legend of university students at either kth in stockholm , or chalmers in gothenburg ( the legend exists in both cities ) welding a tram to its track . 
  what dialect is that ? 
  probably the [ ica ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cznplonyyhw ) series , first episode aired in 2001 and new episodes are still coming . 
  ica is the biggest chain of grocery stores in sweden . 
  a fun classic is [ ful\u00f6l ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnl5b9dzecy ) , obviously a beer commercial . 
  the synopsis is that real beer is brewed on only malt , hops and water . 
  the other guy calls bullshit and is of the opinion that you can filter out any unwanted ingredients . 
  finally [ volvos ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kquhpo2vwi ) commercials lately have been highly praised . 
  price : sek/liter fuel use in liter / ** mil ** ( 1 mil = 10 km ), 
  young people , and they work a year or a summer . 
  it does pay well , but the trick is to live cheap while you 're there and then have money left when you 're back in sweden . 
  it 's not a career route by any means . 
  respect for personal space , and quietness . 
  i do n't really see systembolaget being inconvenient tbh . 
  most stores are right next doors to the bigger grocery stores . 
  but there 's probably some cultural differences to account for here as well . 
  as other 's stated : no insurance = no refund . 
  however i do wonder about this :  we did not have any private insurance that would cover the theft of such electronic devices i do n't know where you live , but at least in sweden a regular household insurance ( which everyone is pretty much `` forced '' to have ) do cover theft of your stuff when travelling . 
  systembolaget is a non-profit company , the prices are high due to taxes . 
  they add 6 % , plus about 1-2 sek depending on product category , on the price in on every product to cover their costs . 
  prices would n't be lower with systembolaget gone . 
  they have a pretty wide range as you said , about 18 000 articles . 
  if your store does n't have what you want you can order anything from their range to your store , without any shipping costs . 
  it is also legal to order from abroad , you can even get systembolaget to import what you want ( and they do n't carry ) from abroad . 
  since they do n't hava goal of selling as much as possible , the shopping experience there is great , the stores are well organized and well staffed . 
  systembolaget has won the price for best service in retail the last five years , is the most trusted government enterprise ( actually the most trusted enterprise of all the bigger swedish companies ) . 
  76 % of all swedes support systembolaget and their exclusive right to sell alcohol . 
  tl ; dr prices ca n't really be lower in sweden with current taxes , and systembolagets main interest is to provide good service , not to sell as much as possible making for a good shopping experience . 
  seriously , no . 
  only people who have no idea what they are talking about think that it would be better without systembolaget . 
  seriously , no . 
  only people who have no idea what they are talking about think it would be better without systembolaget . 
  major breweries , foreign as well make beer with 3.5 % ( or 2.8 % , which have no alcohol tax ) specially for the swedish market . 
  some grocery stores have 200 different beers . 
  swedish microbreweries are making 3.5 % beer as well . 
  for ciders the ones you find in the grocery stores have an abv of 2.25 % , due to tax reasons . 
  it does exist , but it 's unusual . 
  [ zingo ] ( https://carlsbergsverige.se/produkter/zingo/zingo-orange/ ) on the other hand is very common .
