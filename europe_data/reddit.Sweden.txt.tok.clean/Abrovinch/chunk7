  it 's 3.5 % abv, 
  sweden as a whole : 22.4 / km ^ 2 uppsala county : 44.2 / km ^ 2 norrbotten county : 2.53 / km ^ 2 though i might add that norrbotten county is pretty large area wise . 
  at 98 000km ^ 2 it 's a bit larger than hungary . 
  you ca n't get beer from vending machines here . 
   is it true there are countries where you ca n't get alcohol 24/7 ? 
  yes . 
  like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29tzaqjktxs ), 
  i was once asked to be photographed together with someone 's child while wearing a [ student boilersuit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/student_boilersuit ) . . 
  yes , it is not that uncommon for engineering students to have a linear algebra or something along those lines `` saved '' until year 4 or 5 , when you originally had the course in year 1 or 2 . 
  you must pass 75 % of your courses over a year to keep the student aid , except the first year when it 's 62.5 %, 
  infinite tries here , except for some courses ( i had one course whuch was limited to five tries , after that you had to redo the course ) . 
  some fields of study , such as medicine and law have courses you must pass in order to continue with your degree . 
  central heating from waste and biomass ( peat ) . 
  paying with cash is becoming increasingly difficult . 
  where i live i ca n't even pay for parking with cash . 
  lule\u00e5 is very nice , good communications as well . 
  boden is pretty weird , loads of military people and is generally pretty rough . 
  kiruna is literally in the middle of nowhere , but i think i 'd like it better than boden . 
  i guess blondes are more common here compared to other parts of the world , average length for women is 167.7 cm . 
  but there are many brunettes as well . 
  as for beautiful , well it depends on what you 're into , does n't it ? 
  grundskola : ( ages 6-15 ) averages 203 students per school , though some schools have up towards 600 students ( maybe even more ? ) . 
  gymnasieskola : ( ages 15-18/19 ) averages 262 students per school . 
  though i think the biggest schools have upwards to 1500 students . 
  what we call blueberries here is not the same as the blueberries in the us . 
  the european variant is also known as `` billberry '' . 
  `` frigolit '' is a thing here as well . 
  other examples include `` gladpack '' for plastic wrap and `` wettex '' for dishcloth . 
  not really , in 1972 all kinds of pornography became legal in sweden , including animal pornography , violence and child porn . 
  this was the case until 1980 , when spreading child porn became illegal . 
  it was n't until 1999 that possession of child pornography became illegal . 
  the 70s were weird times over here . . 
  child porn was legal in sweden in the 70s , i 'm not joking . . 
  lol, 
  the norm is 40h/week , though some places have 38h , or even 36h/week . 
  of course workplaces where you work in shifts are different . 
  the key thing here are the five weeks of paid vacation granted by law . 
  luckily ( ? 
  ) , that was caught on tape as svt was there , [ link ] ( https://youtu.be/mqakzce3ghq?t=90 ) it was in rinkeby , in 1992 . 
  some things never change . . 
  ines uusman was the politician . 
  she did n't really say `` internet is just a fad '' , that was a newspaper headline , but in a recent interview she agrees that it is n't really a misquote either . 
  * '' which translated would be something along the lines of : `` i do n't want to have a determined perception but i do n't think people in time actually want to spend as much time , as it actually takes , surfing the internet . 
  [ . . ] surfing the internet takes a lot of time , what is it good for ? 
  [ . . ] maybe it 's something that has grown now . 
  everyone is talking about the internet , but maybe it 's transient , and then the focus will be more specified . '', 
  * meaning : `` if you can travel to the moon and back , it would be reasonable to think that you could build this tunnel and other big tunnels in an environmentally sound way '' . 
  -1997 the tunnel she was talking about is the hallands\u00e5s-tunnel . 
  one of the biggest scandals in modern swedish history . 
  construction started in 1992 , and the issues began only 13 meters in ( the tunnel is actually two tunnels 8.7 km long ) when te tunnelling bore machine got stuck . 
  they changed the method to blasting after that , but got massive groundwater problems , and the sealant they used did n't work due to the high inflow of water . 
  that 's when they also learnt that the sealant was poisonous . 
  construction was halted in 1997 , and not restarted until 2005 with a new tunnelling bore machine . 
  the tunnels was finally inaugurated in december 2015 . 
  the total cost for the project is estimated to 10.5 billion sek , far above the 1 billion sek budget . . 
  far fewer than you probably think though . 
  yes , we do have statistics on this . 
   lifestyle philosophy  kalsarik\u00e4nnit lol, 
  yes i do , but both sj\u00e6lland and fyn are still islands . 
  indeed , according to a study i just read the travel time by train between copenhagen and hamburg will be reduced to 2 1/2 hours . 
  the travel time between copenhagen and stockholm by train today is just over 5 hours , but with high speed rail ( 320 km/h ) it could be reduced to something like 3 hours and 15 minuets ( stockholm-malm\u00f6 would take 2 1/2 hours ) . 
  however , as of know it seems like the line between stockholm and gothenburg will be built first . 
  even with the \u00d6resund bridge in place i do n't feel that connected . 
  to get to `` mainland europe '' from copenhagen you still need to either take a ferry , or cross both belts . 
  i find it easier ( and cheaper ) to just take a ferry from gothenburg or varberg to jutland and then drive south . 
  edit : or just take a ferry directly to `` the continent '' from sweden . 
  sorry , i posted before , or at the same time you corrected . 
  for sweden ( page is in swedish , but the tables are in both swedish and english ) : https://www.migrationsverket.se/om-migrationsverket/statistik/oversikter-och-statistik-fran-tidigare-ar.html, 
  yes you do : https://www.nyidanmark.dk/da-dk/statistik/searchstatistics.htm?searchtype=statistics, 
  i share it with 54 579 others . 
  r\u00f6vhatt is one of my favourites , right up there with kioskmongo . 
  the bank check your income , if you have other loans , if you have defaulted etc. 
  and make a decision . 
  finland, 
  [ this ] ( http://damndelicious.net/2013/11/09/loaded-hasselback-potatoes/ ) is not hasselback potatoes ... 
  sweden is tuition free for all eu/ees citizens . 
  it depends since atvs can be registered as three different types of vehicle depending on how it 's equipped . 
  if it 's registered as a motorcycle it can be driven on public roads as long as it can keep up with traffic , requires drivers license , the use of helmet , must pay road taxes , can at most have 20hp and must be inspected . 
  if it 's registered as a tractor it can be driven on public roads , but can at most go 40 or 50 km/h ( there are two types of tractors ) , you need at least a tractor drivers license for the slower or a car drivers license , the slower needs a `` slow vehicle triangle '' and the faster requires a helmet to be worn by the driver . 
  if it 's registered as a terrain vehicle it can not be driven on public roads , no limitations on horsepowers or speed , requires a terrain vehicle drivers license , does n't need to be inspected or pay road tax . 
  driver must have a helmet . 
  does n't the english speaking world ( including the us ) celebrate , and thus hand out the presents , on the 25th ? 
  in most municipalities you still need a permit to fire fireworks ( not that anyone care ) , new years eve and other public holidays are often exempt though . 
  in built up areas you always need a permit , again not that anyone seem to care . . 
  asylum seekers come from practically every country in the world , that does n't mean that they have reason for their claims though . 
  https://studyinsweden.se/programmes/ filter for master programmes , for eu citizens it 's tuition free ( though be prepared for high living costs and you probably wo n't fulfil the requirements for swedish student aid/loan . ), 
  you ca n't insure a bike in sweden that 's not registered in sweden , and to do that you also need a swedish personal identity number , which you ca n't get without a residence permit . 
  it would n't surprise me if the rules in the other european countries were somewhat similar . 
  i think you must get that insurance in your home country . 
  uhm , not to be disrespectful or anything , but you 're from brazil , and worried about travelling to europe ? 
  compared to belgium you are 3.5 times as likely to be killed in a car crash in brazil , and the homicide rate is 13.7 times as high . 
  even with those numbers i 'm not afraid of travelling to brazil , and you should n't be worried about travelling to europe . 
  and finally , hope you have a wonderful trip !, 
  no , not at all , europe is safe , but as always when visiting big cities , be on guard as shit happens in big cities . 
  i 'm mostly talking about pick pockets , accidents , or even getting mugged . 
  decisions can be both positive and negative , in the case of georgia none of the decisions were positive ( what i meant with `` none got residency ) . 
  yes , however the swedish migration board states that they have yet to notice any real increase from georgia and ukraine ( ukraine is number 11 , down 15 % ) . 
  the big increase from turkey is probably due to a certain someone . 
  454 asylum decisions were given to georgians , none got residency . 
  being invaded or not has nothing to do with how you salute . .
