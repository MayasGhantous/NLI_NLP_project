  swedish figures for the first six months 2017 compared to 2016 ( when the numbers fell drastically compared to 2015 ) . 
  i included the top 10 countries , middle east or not . 
  number in parenthesis is the total number of applicants for the period . 
  * syria : down 41 % ( 1873 ) * iraq : down 40 % ( 952 ) * afghanistan : down 47 % ( 930 ) * stateless : down 26 % ( 540 ) * eritrea : down 20 % ( 531 ) * iran : down 27 % ( 502 ) * turkey : up 213 % ( 457 ) * georgia : up 5 % ( 399 ) * somalia : down 59 % ( 387 ) * albania : down 6 % ( 320 ), 
  [ hemnet ] ( https://www.hemnet.se ) has basically everything you can buy . 
  swedish only . 
  i 'd say it 's becoming more and more popular since it was declared a national holiday back in 2005 . 
  still no huge celebrations though . 
  most people i know have a picnic , a nice dinner or something along those lines . 
  there 's also official celebrations in every part of sweden . 
  citizenship ceremonies are usually on this day as well . 
  for a flat electricity is about 32-40 $ / month and water is included in the fee/rent of a flat . 
  i found an example calculation for a free-standing house with a yearly water consumption of 150 000 liters , and that would be 425 euros/year or just over 35 euros/month . 
  i 'm sorry , that 's simply not true no matter how much it 's being said on reddit . 
  when eating out most people do tip , either by rounding up or giving 5-10 % . 
  some people also round taxi fares . 
  it is n't a social requirement to tip , but most people do it anyway , especially if they had a pleasant evening . 
  i mean it 's common ( at least at better places ) , but of course it 's still optional . 
  the norm is to tip 5-10 % at dinner restaurants when you have a waiter . 
  otherwise tipping is weird . 
  service fees/tip are never included in the bill . 
  prints on the receipt stating that the tip is n't included are seen as unethical by both the restaurant employers organisation and the hotel - and restaurant workers union . 
  smoking is n't that common in sweden ( thanks to snus ) , 8 % of all men and 10 % of all women smokes daily . 
  down from 13 , and 15 % in 2006 . 
  i usually check multiple stores to see if i find something i like . 
  for everyday stuff i usually go to [ brothers ] ( https://www.brothers.se ) , and for jeans i almost always shop at [ jc ] ( https://www.jc.se ) . 
  35 year olds was born in 1982 , just saying, 
  [ it 's friday !, 
  the most unique is probably the [ tunnbr\u00f6dsrulle ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-h4bkukd-huw/uvmo6ye_nii/aaaaaaaabse/n8_naf9pdtk/s1600/dsc_0788.jpg ) basically it 's one or two hot dogs , mashed potatoes , salad , creamy shrimp salad and all in a soft flatbread . 
  22 right now though . 
  i like it when it 's between 10 and 15 degrees in the middle of the night , makes it far easier to sleep . 
  a reasonable 12 degrees outside right now . 
  [ kent ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nrcr1qihb4 ) , [ loads ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jocj9rld88 ) , of [ good ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwxur_vdwwe ) , [ songs ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykm558k_d0w ) , [ they had a long career ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7jgiz81vmy ) sadly they stopped [ last year ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buboci11sps ), 
  the electricity provider , and i was wrong , there 's actually over 100 different companies to chose from . 
  the companies does n't have to sell their `` own '' power , they buy from the nordpool spot market at fixed rates , and sell the electricity to costumers . 
  so it 's completely normal to live in [ lule\u00e5 ] ( https://www.google.se/maps/place/lule%c3%a5/@65.5870972,22.1463379,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x467f6314d2e8b867:0x4034506de8c8620!8m2!3d65.584819!4d22.1567026 ) and have `` varberg energi '' as your power company , of course based in [ varberg ] ( https://www.google.se/maps/place/varberg/@58.6561046,20.4827319,6.17z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x465029e864525f1d:0x4019078290e7b80!8m2!3d57.107118!4d12.2520907 ), 
  you are billed separately for the actual electricity and the grid . 
  i feel this is the phase we 're going through right now . 
  it 's a race to the bottom and it 's simply not possible to not be a part of it i 'm afraid . 
  i seriously do n't understand the question , anyone care to explain ? 
  yes , the * rental * market , 25 % of all swedes live in a rented apartment . 
  the rest either owns their own house , or live in a type of condominium known as a `` bostadsr\u00e4tt '' . 
  these markets work exactly as you 'd expect them . 
  the rental market is regulated , and the rent is set by a form of collective bargaining , pretty much the same way as wages are decided upon . 
  there is a waiting list in most cities . 
  as the price of each apartment is fixed the one with the longest time in the queue that has shown interest in it get it . 
  it 's generally a harmful system , and different political parties have different ideas regarding how it should be reformed as they want to avoid high rent increases that force people out of their homes . 
  sure , it 's what i do when changing power company . 
  i 'd say it 's mostly good , with a few exceptions . 
  i like the fact that i can choose between three train operators between stockholm and gothenburg , i also very much like the fact that i can now get painkillers at a grocery store , and also choose between 20 , maybe 30 different power companies . 
  however , i 'm not really a fan of the deregulation of vehicle inspections . 
  not because i do n't trust the private companies ( they still need to be accredited ) , but because it 's damn annoying looking through all the different companies homepages for a free time slot . 
  worth noticing is that in all deregulated sectors the old government enterprise till exist and compete on equal terms as the private alternatives . 
  if they work for a county the average is $ 47 000/year , in private sector it 's $ 52 000/year . 
  the salary itself is n't terrible , but it is a stressfull work . 
  deregulation has been massive over the last 25 years . 
  just concentrate on something else . 
   what country are you from ? 
  see flair  what do you like about your healthcare system ? 
  it 's open for everyone , it gives me the choice to choose my provider , statistics are easy to find , and results are pretty good . 
   how is it paid for ? 
  taxes , and a small out of pocket expense ( maximum $ 125 per year and maximum $ 250 per year for prescription drugs ) . 
   is it efficient ? 
  cost effective , mortality rates , etc are my parameters for this question we have the same public spending per capita as the us , our private spending is a lot lower though as you might have guessed . 
  5-year survivability for cancer is 71.4 % survivability after a heart attack ( both in and outside a hospital ) : 73 %  are you satisfied with your healthcare ? 
  generally , yes . 
   are there private providers ? 
  yes , but they are in the same system as the public providers . 
  thus you do n't pay anything extra . 
  it is also possible to have private insurance in order to get full private care . 
  only about 6 % of all swedes have private health insurance . 
   any personal anecdotes ? 
  do n't really go to the doctor that often , but last time i did i got to see my gp and get a recipe within 24h , which is decent i think . 
   what could be improved in the system ? 
  we need more nurses , like a lot more nurses . 
  problem is that it 's not a very attractive job at the moment , so they could use higher salaries for example . 
  since the healthcare is organised by the counties there are some differences in quality , some hospitals also have unreasonable waiting times at the emergency room . 
  i think this is partly due to the lack of staff , but also due to incompetence by the people in charge . 
  just want to add that mil is also used by government agencies , so it 's not just your everyday swede that use it . 
  the tax agency for example use the * mil * for everything that has to do with distances ( deductions , company car benefits etc. 
  pickled herring ( inlagd sill ) comes to mind ( not to be confused with fermented herring , aka surstr\u00f6mming ), 
  about 50 % of swedes live in a house that they own . 
  i 'd say many have their own house as a `` life goal '' . 
  here 's and [ example ] ( https://www.maklarhuset.se/bostad/sverige/uppsala/storvreta/olle-akares-vag/314081?referrer=hemnet#bilder ) of a typical ( well , this one is very nicely renovated ) house , built in 1946 . 
  [ another example ] ( https://widerlov.se/tillsalu/cmvilla4l8j69gd3e12l77s?showimages=true ), 
  it 's literally top of the page on svts news site . 
  technically they 're allowed to move , there was one ( sketchy ) football club here that did just that for this season . 
  opposing fans are shouting `` murderers '' and hoping they will be relegated at the end of the season , and since they 're dead last that will probably happen as well . . 
  clubs here have such rich history related to where they 're from . 
  [ hammarby ] ( http://www.stockholmdirekt.se/_internal/cimg!0/kebpsdxuiobg5hoboa47uk5vcb1hixf ) is a team from `` s\u00f6der '' , the southern parts of stockholm , there is no s\u00f6der without hammarby , and there is no hammarby without s\u00f6der . 
  they exist to play the sport , no ? 
  business in the sense that they need to make ends meet , otherwise no . 
  do n't know if it 's regional or not , but doing a u-turn in the middle of the road ( without there being an intersection or roundabout ) is often called * rallarsv\u00e4ng * '' [ navvy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/navvy ) turn '' , or * g\u00f6ra en pajas * `` do a clown '' . 
  norway 2 . 
  finland 3 . 
  germany 5 . 
  27 % of the population between the age of 25 and 64 have at least 3 years post high-school education . 
  this percentage increase by about .5 points every year . 
  how many of those that have masters degrees i do n't know . 
  another 15 % has a post high-school education that 's shorter than 3 years .
