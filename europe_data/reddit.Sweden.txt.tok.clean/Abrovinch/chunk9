  no , it 's cognac and has always been produced in the cognac region , but the blend was done in sweden until 2008 , nowadays the blend is done in the cognac region as well . 
  so up until 2008 i guess it was up to debate , but nowadays it 's no doubt a cognac , albeit difficult to get hold of outside of sweden/finland . 
  you were probably drunk when answering the questions , 
  music is part of the curriculum pretty much from first grade to 9th grade , and it is possible to choose chose musical studies instead of arts studies in secondary school . 
  the curriculum includes both music theory and history , as well as context of music and singing/playing instruments . 
  i remember we got to write and perform our own songs which was then recorded on a cd . 
  oh , and it sounds terrible when 20-something kids are trying to learn guitar accords . . 
  it 's also possible to get extra curricular education in music . 
  for learning an instrument it 's sek 1300 per semester in my municipality . 
  i 'm sure there are other activities that 's subsidised as well , i know for a fact that there 's a lot of activities during the summer . 
  i like it !, 
  cognac has a pretty rich history in sweden . 
  the most famous brand , * gr\u00f6nstedts * actually did the blending in sweden , of course using cognac . 
  nowadays everything is done in france in the cognac district . 
  pretty much , but on the [ smorgasbord ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord ) , it 's in the [ oxford dictionary ] ( https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/smorgasbord ) as well . 
   the circle jerk fake ones and that 's a steadily increasing number . . 
  g\u00f6ran persson ( pm 1996-2006 ) danced with a cow on [ tv ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wcfi0ctudi ) once . . 
  generally per month , but per hour is n't uncommon either . 
  corona is nice , if you have lime , and it 's ice cold , and it 's 30 degrees outside , and you 're at the beach , with friends . 
  nut sure if praise , but funny nonetheless : [ tingeling ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn9lowzjxdu ), 
  apart from the wealth part i 'd say lappland : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lapland_ ( sweden ) beautiful scenery , for the most part otherwise it 's just forest and more forest . 
  there is n't really anything to do there ( except outdoorsy stuff ) . 
  it 's also pretty much empty , it 's the same size as bulgaria and has a population of about 100k . 
   i 'm sorry but christmas is n't christmas without ~ ~ a coca-cola add ~ ~ julmust :p ftfy , 
  because of misinformation and propaganda . 
  yes , of course it does , and it is . 
  i 'm debating the question wether sweden is some fantastic country that hands out loads of free money compared to other european countries . 
  i 'm not comparing to afghanistan . 
  i 'm currently in uppsala ( just north of stockholm for anyone who did n't knew ) , the last few days have been way too hot , around 24-27 degrees . 
  so i 'm glad its finally starting to rain and cooling down a bit . 
  will probably be a bit rainy during midsummer though , as is tradition . . 
  sure , we have peace , a well functioning society etc. 
  asylum seekers in sweden get emergency care , and health care that can not wait . 
  you live at one of the migration boards accommodation centers , you have to share rooms . 
  these centers are often in the middle of nowhere . 
  if you have funds you are supposed to use these to support yourself , if you do n't you can get financial support , at most 74 $ per month food is included where you stay , or 218 $ if you pay for your meals . 
  if you share household expenses you get less , if you 're under 18 you get far less . 
  people under 18 can go to school , adults can not get educated while they wait for their decision . 
  if they get residency they can get financial aid that is tied to them sticking to an `` establishment plan '' that include language courses , society orientation and making yourself available to the labour market , this is 40h/week and time limited . 
  the amount you get is at most around 680 $ / month . 
  you can also get financial aid for things like rent ( but you still pay parts of it by yourself ) and of course if you have children . 
  it 's not a frugal life , it 's barely making ends meet . 
  and just for the sake of it . 
  no , i 'm not particularly in favour of increasing the financial aid , maybe restructuring parts of it though . 
  i wonder who downvoted you , winters without snow are miserable . . 
  ^ all of this i can understand , sweden and germany are the `` better choice '' for migrants . 
  i just wanted to make it clear that it 's far from a dance on roses for newly arrived people here either . 
  yet a scary amount of people think that we give them luxury lives over here . 
   immigrants will not move from sweden to czechia because of the amount of `` free money '' they get . 
  if you think immigrants get a lot of `` free money '' in sweden you are deeply misinformed , unfortunately you would not be alone . . 
   sweden allows huge numbers of immigrants to come in just want to make one thing clear , we do n't have a number or quota we allow . 
  we just follow international treaties stating that people have the right to apply for asylum and have the right to get their cause tried in a fair way . 
  after 2015 sweden has had a much lower number of asylum seekers . 
  only fire drill once or twice a year . 
  in reality there were more fire `` drills '' though as some teachers were pretty shit at doing chemistry demonstrations . . 
  screen sizes and rims are in inches ( tum ) . 
  people often use inches when talking about lumber , even though all lumber have been metric for quite some time . 
  mcdonald 's sell `` qp cheese '' here , which is 113g = 1/4lb , however it 's just `` qp '' , not `` quarter pounder '' . 
  in 1855 the swedish measurement system was changed . 
  the base was the `` fot '' ( foot ) , which was 0.2969 m , so smaller than the imperial foot . 
  1 `` tum '' ( inch ) was 1/10th foot , 1 `` linje '' was 1/10th tum , 1 `` gran '' was 1/10th linje and 1 `` skrupel '' was 1/10th gran . 
  1 `` st\u00e5ng '' was 10 fot , 1 `` rev '' was 10 st\u00e5ng , and 1 `` mil '' was 360 rev. 
  mil is still used today , but metrified to being 10km . 
  sometimes swedes use `` mile '' as 10km when speaking english , to the confusion of everyone else . . another relic of the old measuring system is the [ roslagsbanan ] ( http://www.sll.se/exigus/489748.jpg?preset=1050 ) commuter rail in stockholm that still uses the track gauge * 3 fot * , or as it 's known today 891mm . 
  italy can into nordics !, 
  sorry , it 's not our fault for being too close to denmark . 
  bad danskj\u00e4vlar coming across the bridge . 
  we may not have any oil , but at least cars are cheap here . 
  the infrastructure is publicly owned here , but any train operator can run trains pretty much as they want . 
  think of it like buying slot times at an airport . 
  our biggest train company , sj , is owned by the government but is run exactly like any private enterprise , meaning it 's profitable , does n't get any legal advantages etc. 
  the main competitor on the stockholm-gothenburg route is mtr express . 
  the competition is good for prices , the onboard product etc. 
  i still think sj has higher quality on their product though , due to more comfortable trains . 
  low demand routes are a different story though . 
  yeah , i 'd say 130 would be a good speed for most of our motorways . 
  as long as you follow the traffic rhythm the police generally do n't pull you over on motorways , but in theory you could get a fine at 111 . 
  that fine is sek 1500 ( $ 170 ) . 
  speed limits , we have 30 , 40 , 50 , 60 , 70 , 80 , 90 , 100 , 110 and 120 , way too many . 
  most motorways are 110 , which is to low considering the distances and the general quality of the roads . 
  yes , for travellers from outside the eu that 's the best option . 
  you ca n't get a plan from a country you do n't reside in . 
  asylum seeker is an asylum seeker no matter what you want it to be . 
  i could travel to slovakia and apply for asylum and i would be an asylum seeker . 
  last year we had one person with slovakian citizenship applying for asylum , one from denmark , three from germany , 25 from usa etc. 
  applying for asylum in any country is part of the un declaration of human rights . 
  being granted is not however . 
  there is also nothing in the un conventions about refugees that say anything about in which country they must stay in . 
  however we have other conventions to set the game plan for those sorts of things . 
  i think us swedes look at our country in a different way from foreigners . 
  if you were to say [ this is sweden ] ( http://blekinge.ip-only.se/app/uploads/sites/21/2016/06/hero_startsida.jpg ) to a swede , the response would be `` duh , water is also wet '' . 
  however , if you would say [ this is sweden ] ( http://www.root.guide/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/sarek.jpg ) the average swede would not recognise it . 
  of course most of us have heard of this magical place called `` norra norrland '' , but very few of us have actually been there . 
  it is however more heavily used in marketing , due to it 's wilderness . 
  swedish neo-nazi chopped his finger off with an axe because he could n't get clean from his addiction to porn . 
  the comment above mine wondered if it was true , but added that the addiction was interracial porn . 
  you do realise that the number quoted in that link , 20 000 , is exactly that . 
  yes , it totally dilutes the taste of the drink , a few ice cubes are enough . 
   look up some census data , its all recorded and public . 
  not in all countries , sweden for instance does n't record religious beliefs .
