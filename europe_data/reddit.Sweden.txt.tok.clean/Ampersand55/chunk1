  it is to a degree when it 's indiscriminate . 
  protocol additional to the geneva conventions , protocol i , article 51 :  indiscriminate  attacks  are  prohibited . 
    indiscriminate  attacks  are :   ( a )  those  which  are  not  directed  at  a specific  military  objective ;   ( b )  those  which  employ  a method  or  means  of  combat  which  can not  be  directed  at  a specific  military  objective ;  or   ( c )  those  which  employ  a method  or  means  of  combat  the  effects  of  which  can not  be  limited  as  required  by  this  protocol ;,

  if you want to be like that , frederick ii was prussian not german .

  olof palme allegedly went back on his decision to parton [ miro bare\u0161i\u0107 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/miro_bare%c5%a1i%c4%87 ) and the assassination was a revenge action from [ usta\u0161e ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/usta%c5%a1e ) . 
  this theory is n't getting much credit in sweden . 
  a theory that 's missing from the english wikipedia page is the [ pkk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kurdistan_workers%27_party ) connection , where palme classified them as terrorists and put some of their members living in sweden under surveillance . 
  this lead to the [ ebbe carlsson affair ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ebbe_carlsson_affair ) . 
  for non-violent cases , [ the pirate bay trial ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_pirate_bay_trial ) should also be mentioned . 
  it got some international coverage i believe . 
  most of the world major studios vs a file sharing website . 
  there is also statues of him in : * bremen , germany * l\u00fctzen , germany * st. peter , minnesota , united states * tartu , estonia, 
   is he mostly just a national figure that everyone knows of , but does n't know much about . 
  pretty much this . 
   and if so , how is he usually presented to children ? 
  iirc about one semester in school in dedicated to '' [ the era of great power ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_empire ) '' ( stormaktstiden ) which he initiated . 
  the [ currect curriculum ] ( https://www.skolverket.se/om-skolverket/publikationer/visa-enskild-publikation?_xurl_=http%3a%2f%2fwww5.skolverket.se%2fwtpub%2fws%2fskolbok%2fwpubext%2ftrycksak%2fblob%2fpdf2646.pdf%3fk%3d2646 ) does n't even mention him nor the military history of sweden . 
  [ the assassination of pm olof palme ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/assassination_of_olof_palme ) in 1986 . 
  tl ; dr :  #murder theories   palme 's assassination remains unsolved , with a number of alternative theories surrounding the murder . 
  at the time , a murder under swedish law was subject to prescription in 25 years . 
  the law was later changed to prevent the palme case from expiring , and thus the police investigation remains active . 
    ### yugoslavian connection   in january 2011 the german magazine focus cited official german interrogation records in connection with another investigation from 2008 as showing that the assassination had been carried out by an operative of the yugoslavian security service . 
    ### `` the 33-year-old ''   a swedish extremist , victor gunnarsson ( labeled in the media 33-\u00e5ringen , `` the 33-year-old '' ) , was soon arrested for the murder but quickly released , after a dispute between the police and prosecuting attorneys . 
  gunnarsson had connections to various extremist groups , among these the european workers party , the swedish branch of the larouche movement . 
  [ 12 ] pamphlets hostile to palme from the party were found in his home outside stockholm . 
    in december 1988 , almost three years after palme 's death , christer pettersson , a criminal , drug user and alcoholic , who had previously been imprisoned for manslaughter , was arrested for the murder of palme . 
  picked out by mrs palme at a lineup as the killer , pettersson was tried and convicted of the murder , but was later acquitted on appeal to the court of appeal . 
  pettersson 's appeal succeeded for three main reasons :   * failure of the prosecution to produce the murder weapon ;  * lack of a clear motive for the killing ;  * doubts about the reliability of mrs palme 's testimony and `` extremely gross errors '' by the police in arranging the lineup . 
    additional evidence against pettersson surfaced in the late 1990s , mostly coming from various petty criminals who altered their stories but also from a confession made by pettersson . 
  the chief prosecutor , agneta blidberg , considered re-opening the case . 
  but she acknowledged that a confession alone would not be sufficient , saying :    he must say something about the weapon because the appeals court set that condition in its ruling . 
  that is the only technical evidence that could be cited as a reason to re-open the case . 
  does anyone know any place that have those kind of drills ? 
  it 's a bit unusual , but the idiom `` spark i baken '' ( kick in the rear ) is sometimes used as a way of wishing good luck . 
  he 's from gothenburg .

  non-standard grammar is n't the same as incorrect grammar . 
  in some places in sweden ( e.g. 
  [ \u00c4lvdalen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elfdalian ) and [ gotland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gutnish ) ) there are people who still use the old grammar with male/female grammatical genders and a dative grammatical case .
