  people take turns handling the official @sweden account on twitter . 
  they can say what they want and they can block whoever they want . 
  last week ( 8 -- 14 may ) the user ( vian tahir , a net security expert ) added an extensive block-list with over 14000 accounts being blocked . 
  as the block list seemed effective for blocking the trolls ( the @sweden account is heavily harassed by the alt-right on twitter ) and had supposedly been developed by net security experts , the swedish institute ( who administers the @sweden twitter account ) decided to keep that block-list after her turn was up ( 15 may ) . 
  but the block-list has ( as of 16 may ) been revoked after numerous complaints from people being unfairly blocked . 
  they made an official statement ( in swedish ) where they apologized to anyone being wrongly blocked : https://si.se/si-avblockerar-konton-pa-sweden/,

  waste water is released back into m\u00e4laren after having been purified . 
  edit : fun fact : when stockholm was applying for olympics , a politician drank and offered the olympic delegates to drink directly from inner-city m\u00e4laren to demonstrate how good the water was . 
  however the water was later deemed not appropriate for drinking by the stockholm environment administration .

  after she 's cleaned the hen house she opens the box and it 's full of treasure . 
  the gleam from the treasure spreads around the hen house and it becomes more beautiful than a royal chamber . 
  the widow then pushes her own daughter down the well in hope of finding another treasure box .

   the martebo lights are `` ghost lights '' which have been seen since the early 1900s on a road in martebo on the swedish island of gotland .

  sweden and denmark have [ ragnar lodbrok ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ragnar_lodbrok ) and his relatives . 
  according to [ ynglinga saga ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ynglinga_saga ) odin was the first king of sweden . 
   the country east of the tanaquisl in asia was called asaland , or asaheim , and the chief city in that land was called asgaard . 
  in that city was a chief called odin , and it was a great place for sacrifice . 
  it was the custom there that twelve temple priests should both direct the sacrifices , and also judge the people . 
  they were called diar , or drotner , and all the people served and obeyed them . 
  odin was a great and very far-travelled warrior , who conquered many kingdoms , and so successful was he that in every battle the victory was on his side . 
  ( ... )  odin died in his bed in swithiod ; and when he was near his death he made himself be marked with the point of a spear , and said he was going to godheim , and would give a welcome there to all his friends , and all brave warriors should be dedicated to him ; and the swedes believed that he was gone to the ancient asgaard , and would live there eternally . 
  then began the belief in odin , and the calling upon him . 
  the swedes believed that he often showed to them before any great battle . 
  to some he gave victory ; others he invited to himself ; and they reckoned both of these to be fortunate . 
  odin was burnt , and at his pile there was great splendour . 
  it was their faith that the higher the smoke arose in the air , the higher he would be raised whose pile it was ; and the richer he would be , the more property that was consumed with him . 
  we have two official coat of arms .
