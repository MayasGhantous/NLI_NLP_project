  there are also the rules governing when you can remove the seal separating the top and bottom layer from an [ aladdin chocolate box ] ( http://www.totallyswedish.com/sites/www.totallyswedish.com/files/imagecache/medium/products/aladdin_-_118260674.jpg ) and start eating from the bottom layer . 
  a short summary of a lengthy topic : 1 . 
  finish the top layer . 
  this is mandatory . 
  declare to everyone around that you are breaking the holy seal which is the thin cover separating the two layers . 
  3 . a ) if you are the sole proprietor of the box , you may initiate eating from the bottom layer . 
  b ) if you get explicit permission from every proprietor of the box , you may eat from the bottom layer . 
  note that it is a great faux pas to ask directly , you may only hint that you want it with the greatest of subtlety . 
  c ) if the proprietor ( s ) of the box are not present and are not expected to return in the near future , you can pass the removal of the seal up for a vote . 
  if the vote passes with at least two thirds majority , you may eat from the bottom layer . 
  you may never take more than one piece at a time . 
  the first rule of finishing the top layer can lead to some interesting situations . 
  the last piece of chocolate is the least desirable , because the good pieces are eaten first . 
  as the pieces gets fewer and fewer the remaining pieces get less and less desirable . 
  soon everyone wants to eat from the bottom layer . 
  this often leads to a standstill where nobody wants to take the last piece from the upper layer , henceforth referred to as r&r ( rum & raisin ) . 
  this situation can be analysed using game theory with the following pay-of matrix . 
  it 's similar to the [ volunteer 's dilemma ] ( http://www.gametheory.net/dictionary/games/volunteersdilemma.html ) . 
  | you wait | you take the r&r -- | -- | -- ** everyone else waits ** | a standstill . 
  nobody gets any chocolate | you get the r&r and everyone else gets to start eating from the bottom layer . 
  ** someone else takes the r&r ** | you get to start eating from the bottom layer | logically impossible . 
  once in a while it 's suggested that we were nazi germany 's lapdog in ww2 ( which is of course not true ) . 
  this discussion prompted me to write this post in / r/nordiccountries : [ a comparison of the quality of university education between the nordic countries . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/nordiccountries/comments/6a9ar6/a_comparison_of_the_quality_of_university/ ), 
  fool , you better czech yourself before you wreck yourself . 
  it 's a capital offence in sweden to suggest that the danes in particular are better than us in any way . 
  hats of to / u/tonygaze , he got us good . 
  here is a fresh example from the wild about whether danish or swedish universities are better : https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/6a6mo6/studying_in_sweden_or_in_norway/dhc5ny7/?context=10000, 
  we simultaneously think patriotism is stupid and no countries or cultures are inherently better or worse than others , while secretly believing that we , in fact , are objectively the best country on the planet . 
  and we become aggressively defensive upon any outside suggestion that anything we do is not the best way of doing things imaginable , a geopolitical [ law of jante ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/law_of_jante ) . 
  i need not remind you that by the danish-swedish code of conduct you are expected to return the favour by bringing a falukorv to ram up his liseberg . 
  hmm ... 
  it certainly does . 
  thanks for the correction . 
  edit : nevermind . 
  see corrections below . 
  lol , guilty as charged . 
  i was just writing a long butt-hurt response with research and sources and everything . 
  my research found that the quality of education per capita is very similar for sweden and denmark . 
  sweden have more top universities in the [ top 200 qs world university rankings ] ( https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2016 ) and the [ times higher education world university rankings ] ( https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2017/world-ranking#!/page/0/length/25/locations/dk+se/sort_by/rank/sort_order/asc/cols/stats ) but that can largely be attributed to us having a larger population . 
   - i 'd like to learn norwegian , or swedish depending on where i go . 
  is one language really tough compared to the other one ? 
  are there huge differences between them ? 
  swedish and norwegian are very similar and mutually intelligible . 
   - i wo n't be rich , so i 'd like to know the difference about everyday 's life cost . 
  sweden is cheaper , but if you study in stockholm the cost of rent goes up a lot .

  exactly !, 
  we pride ourselves with being the most feminist country , but sometimes we can be a bit overzealous . 
  for instance `` feminist snow clearance '' . 
  because women use walkways , bicycle paths , bus ways and roads around preschools to a higher degree than men , those are being prioritized over roadways when clearing snow . 
  as someone using who likes to use public transport i do n't mind it actually , but the rationale for the policy is inherently unjust . 
  i mean , i 'm all for women 's rights , but they should be promoted with equality rather than with arbitrary advantages to women . 
  * hockey players moving to the us/canada to play in the nhl . 
  * immigrants returning home . 
  * the wealthy who does n't want to pay 55 % income tax . 
  * elderly moving to a warmer climate . 
  * exchange students finding a job in their new country . 
  i 've heard it being called `` luftlinje '' in sweden too , but `` f\u00e5gelv\u00e4g '' is the standard way . 
  i think `` luftlinje '' is the standard way in norway and denmark . 
  i 'll drink to that . 
  sk\u00e5l !, 
  i note that you did n't use the comparative inflection of `` handsome '' . 
  as you should n't . 
  for $ 15.50 you can go from anywhere in the greater stockholm area to arlanda airport , youths and pensioners can go to uppsala for about the same price . 
  it 's 74km from s\u00f6dert\u00e4lja to uppsala as the crow flies . 
  going by bus ( swebus ) you can travel from stockholm to malm\u00f6 ( 514 km ) for $ 14 on thursdays , fridays and sundays . 
  you can rent a bike for three days for $ 17 at city bikes . 
  if you can go 20km/h for 12 hours a day that 's 720km , about half the length of sweden . 
  edit : added bus . 
  it was deemed illegal to artificially fluorinate water in 1971 . 
  1.5 ml/l is the maximum allowed fluoride content in the eu . 
  i found some original recordings from that period .
