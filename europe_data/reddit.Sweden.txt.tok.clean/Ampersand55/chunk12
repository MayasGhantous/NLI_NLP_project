  that 's how sweden feels about norway , except they are n't the older brother . 
  i have n't heard anything about it , but it sounds very reasonable and your friend sounds very educated about the subject . 
  so it 's probably true . 
  yes , they are quite common . 
  omg that 's adorable . 
  i ca n't even imagine how that would sound . 
  i think tony irving 's swedish accent is hilariously adorable . 
  but that 's maybe because i associate it with robert gustafssons impersonations of him . 
  we 've been warring with denmark since before we were nations . 
  overview of nation wars between sweden and denmark : https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/2g2h99/danes_vs_swedes/ckf83ng/ we 're still rivals , but it 's more like sibling rivalry than anything serious . 
  the concept of a middle class is a bit fuzzy and not much talked about in sweden . 
  but in terms of socioeconomic status , it has less to do with income and more to do with what you do for work , where you live and how much you invest in capital goods such as in their car or in their house/apartment . 
  i remember feeling guilty about that , with you hosting the world championship and all . 
  i also remember peter forsbergs goal for equalizing to 5-5 where he skated all the way from behind his own goal cage to behind finlands goal cage for a wrap around goal . 
  the `` welfare '' in welfare state does n't refer to monetary benefits to non-working people . 
  it 's a principle that everyone has the right to a decent quality of life regardless of economic situation , i.e. 
  that they should `` fare well '' . 
  no one should not be able afford decent housing , having children , going to the doctor , going back to studying or being sick . 
  those are all covered by benefits . 
  but you do n't just get money if you are not working , it 's more akin to unemployment insurance where you get money as you search for a job . 
  good addition , 
  the loss to belarus in the quarter finals of the 2002 winter olympics in hockey comes to mind . 
  we were favourites to win the tournament after having won the group of death against canada and the czech republic , and we got an `` easy '' match up against the last place of the other group ( belarus ) in the quarter finals . 
  we dominated the game on the ice and we had 47 shots on goal against their 19 shorts , but we still lost 3-4 . 
  the goalie tommy salo was heavily criticized in news papers after having failed to catch an easy puck for the winning goal with 2:30 left in the last period . 
  here is a clip of the winning goal : https://youtu.be/srsubv1d_qu?t=60 gg wp belarus . 
  it 's a 250 kronor ( $ 26 ) fine nowadays . 
  for the sake of the americans , you guys should merge with australia and we 'll merge with the swiss .

  as a kid you put [ one on each finger ] ( https://cdn1.cdnme.se/cdn/8-2/422186/images/2008/releasfest-112_19913711.jpg ) and then you put your fingers in your mouth to eat them . 
  as an adult you put them on your finger and feed them to your girlfriend in hope that she will suck your finger in an erotic manner , but they always bite your finger and take the bag :(, 
  in syrian germany , crimes commit you . 
  crisps , cheese curls , peanut rings , chili nuts ( peanuts ) , with crisps being the most popular by far . 
  [ torne river valley ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/me%c3%a4nmaa ) between sweden and finland with unique culture and language ( me\u00e4nkieli ) . 
  [ \u00d6verkalix ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%96verkalix ) an isolated area whose dialect ( \u00d6verkalixm\u00e5l / bondska ) is completely unintelligible for most other swedes .

  we do n't really have big secretive things in sweden . 
  the alt-right sometimes accuses the government to cover up information or statistics , but that 's about it . 
  coop is generally the most expensive where i live and their store brand is imho better than ica : s . at least for frozen pizza . 
  i agree that they have a smaller choice of products though . 
  that 's not really different from being member of any other private club . 
  those grants are funded by own equity and membership fees ( kapitationsavgift ) , they do not receive any funding from the government . 
  my bad , they only mean a `` noble '' escutcheon , presumably they mean recognized by the house of nobility ( riddarhuset ) . 
  other people may use heraldry without an open helmet or `` noble '' escutcheon in their family coat of arms . 
  the house of nobility also has the custom that only high nobility ( count and freiherr ) can use an inescutcheon , more than one helmet and an inescutcheon above their quartered shield , but these customs are n't regulated by law . 
  yes . 
  the only privilege the swedish aristocracy enjoys is from an archaic law from 1767 where non-nobles are prohibited to use an escutcheon/heraldic shield and open helmet in a coats of arms . 
  the penalty for unauthorized use is 500 silver [ swedish riksdaler ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_riksdaler ) .

  but it did n't sound like british english i presume ? 
  it 's more american english than british english . 
  it 's somewhat common among young people to pre-drink ( f\u00f6rkr\u00f6ka ) before you go out . 
  you have to find a balance since bars wont let you in if you are drunk . 
  the us west coast accent is regarded the standard american accent as it 's the one used in most movies and tv-shows . 
  the british accent is taught in school but many swedes use an us accent when they speak english and consider the standard accent to be the us west coast accent . 
  we 've also been indoctrinated with the hollywood stereotypes about the other us accents . 
  deep south accents sounds uneducated , north mid-west accents are associated with the quaint characters of fargo , new york accent is associated with wannabe mobster tough guys or vain seinfeld-people etc. 
  not really . 
  we officially switched to metric between 1879-88 and most idioms and proverbs are from before that . 
  fun fact : we used a decimal old system in 1855 where a foot was 10 inches .

  most scandinavians can comprehend the other ( continental ) scandinavian languages somewhat . 
  most swedes can understand norwegian , and to a lesser extent danish . 
  we can also pick out some words from icelandic and faroese . 
  most is norse/scandinavian folklore shared between nordic/scandinavian countries .

  we do n't have a federal government . 
  since 2015 we have one national police authority , before that we had one police authority in each l\u00e4n ( county ) . 
  the police in sweden is divided into 7 police regions ( with overall responsibility ) , which in turn are divided into 3-5 police areas ( handling preliminary investigations , coordinating between local police areas ) which in turn are divided into local police areas ( handling arrests , simple investigations , traffic safety etc ) .

  i did n't even know that temperature went that high . 
  on one hand i think it 's un-swedish to inherit an official position , but i think we would lose some of our connection to our history if we became a republic . 
  a good compromise would be to go back to having an elective monarchy . 
  our first king as a nation state gustav i vasa was elected .
