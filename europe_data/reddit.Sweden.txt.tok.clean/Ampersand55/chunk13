  * swimming/diving : sunny , 22c in air and 20c in water , no wind . 
  * photographing : even thin overcast acting as a diffuser , 20c , some wind but not enough to make the tripod sway . 
  * cozying up indoors watching movies : dark clouds , -20 , snow storm . 
  there have also been democratically elected socialist/communist governments replaced by dictatorships in the name of capitalism . 
  for instance in chile when a cia sponsored coup d'\u00e9tat overthrew the democratically elected marxist salvador allende and replaced him with the dictator augusto pinochet . 
  true . 
  `` decimal notation '' means that it is in base 10 . 
   but it has never been implemented without it either . 
  sure it has , like almost every other communist country . 
  there have probably been more instances of bloodshed in the name of capitalism in attempts of overthrowing communist governments than in the establishments of communism governments . 
   communism is good in theory , but in practice it usually just ends up being destroyed in a military coup financed by the cia . 
  that 1 +1 = 2 . 
  for you `` umm ... technically '' - people : we are using the peano axioms , natural numbers , decimal notation and standard operators . 
  the [ varnhem abbey ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/varnhem_abbey ) stone chuch was completed at the latest in 1040 ce . 
  edit : [ the king 's grave in kivik ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_king%27s_grave ) is from 1400 bce . 
  if you count dolmen ( megalithic tombs ) there are a bunch of of them dating from between 3500 and 800 bce . 
  we also have about 2000 runestones dating from between 400 and 1130 ce . 
  the [ r\u00f6k runestone ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/r%c3%b6k_runestone ) . 
  mellan\u00f6stern , literally `` the middle east '' . 
  the far east is called fj\u00e4rran \u00d6stern ( curiously not a compound word ) , which also directly translates to `` the far east '' . 
  maja is both a form of the greek goddess maia and a short form of maria . 
  the use of maja grew steadily until 2004 and then started to decline .

  maja, 
  i just made one up : how many members did the german fellowship of the ring have ? 
  nineteen : four hobbits , two humans , one dwarf , one wizard and an elf . 
  quite often , at least once a week . 
  mostly local atlantic salmon from sweden and norway . 
  my staple salmon foods are cold smoked salmon on sandwiches and with pasta , raw salmon on sushi , grilled honey glazed salmon and smoked salmon and spinach lasagne . 
  you 're thinking of china and japan where the number four is pronounced the same way as the word death . 
  edit : there is a wikiperia article about this : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tetraphobia, 
  not my favourite either , but he should probably be mentioned . 
  to clarify : french law prohibits wearing religious symbols , such as a hijab , in french public schools . 
  there is also a law that prohibits wearing of full-face covering , such as niqab ( but not hijab ) in public .

  taste is of course individual . 
  but if we compare products that are primarily aimed at women ( e.g. 
  fashion magazines ) and products that are primarily aimed at men ( e.g. 
  porn ) one can conclude that men and women have different ideals . 
  are there different beauty standards for white and black women and men in africa ? 
  i think we have pretty standard western beauty standards . 
  women want to be tall and skinny . 
  men prefer women who are short and curvy . 
  quoting myself from an [ earlier thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/nordiccountries/comments/62uxl8/how_does_nordic_humor_differ_from_american_humor/ ) :  a scene from four shades of brown :   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf1chnshfkg   one guy tries to engage other the guys in the sauna in a children 's singing game ( a big faux pas in sauna etiquette ) . 
  instead of confronting him they ignore him , and the one closest to him make up an excuse to leave . 
  the guy then optimistically moves onto the next person in the sauna . 
    it 's funny because of the absurdity of the situation and simultaneously how realistic it is in depicting the archetypical nordic social awkwardness . 
  it 's not only his obliviousness of breaking sauna etiquette and his failing to take a hint , but also the other guys ' collective social ineptitude in that they choose to completely ignore the situation in hope that it resolves itself ( which it does n't ) rather than to confront him . 
  hey !, 
  not cool !, 
  you need to dream bigger . 
  we should form a nordic union and take control over continental europe . 
  trust me , i 've done it several times in eu4 . 
  we already completed the \u00d6resund bridge with denmark . 
  now it 's time for sweden and finland to cross the baltic sea and connect stockholm and \u00c5bo ( turku ) with a bridge via \u00c5land and the archipelagos . 
  perhaps we could even extend the connection to tallinn . 
  the scandinavian word for germany is `` tyskland '' . 
  - land means `` land '' and `` tysk '' comes from old norse thydisker ( \u00fe\u00fd\u0111verskr ) . 
  it 's related to the medieval latin [ theodiscus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/theodiscus ) , `` of the people '' . 
  ah ... good times . 
  those were the good days . 
  we still remember our third place in the 1994 fifa world cup . 
  * 2000 the \u00d6resund bridge was finished and sweden was connected to continental europe . 
  * 2002 honor killing of fadime \u015eahindal brought up a lot of discussion about immigration , integration and islam . 
  * 2003 foreign minister anna lindh was murdered . 
  * 2006 swedish general election . 
  the government shifted from a left wing coalition to a right wing coalition . 
  * 2008 the financial crisis . 
  * 2014 swedish general election . 
  the government shifted from a right wing coalition to a left wing coalition . 
  * 2015 the european migrant crisis . 
  many did n't like how many refugees we harboured and the populist right wing grew . 
  * 2017 terror attack in stockholm . 
  it shook us quite a bit . 
  we call it [ juggepizza ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=juggepizza ) . 
  the svd-article stated that they were aiming to grow with 10-15 % more stores per year . 
  seems like they are on target . 
  1569 x 1.10 ^ 8 = 3363 stores 1569 x 1.15 ^ 8 = 4799 stores . 
  i do n't really have a favourite clothing store , but the most popular is undoubtedly h&m . it 's the largest clothing store chain in the world counting the number of stores ( [ swedish source ] ( https://www.svd.se/hm-storst-i-varlden ) . 
  from 2008 , might be outdated ) .
