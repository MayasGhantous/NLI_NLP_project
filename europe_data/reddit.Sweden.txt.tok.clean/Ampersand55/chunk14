  one does n't exclude the other . 
  even though most are albanians are muslims i would n't call it a `` muslim country '' as it has a secular government with no state religion . 
  they make great pizza . 
  turks and kurds run kiosks , ex-yugoslavians run pizza places , poles are in construction or craftsmen . 
  the 1958 fifa world cup in sweden was staged . 
  it was officially denied by the swedish sports confederation ( [ swedish source ] ( https://web.archive.org/web/20081007033827/http://www.rf.se/templates/pages/newspage____1001.aspx ) ) . 
  swedish conspiracy site with lots of `` evidence '' : http://sanningenomvm58.blogspot.se/, 
  another word that 's missing : gantlet ( gauntlet ) , as in `` to run the gauntlet '' , a corporal punishment where one is forced to run between a double file of people striking them as they pass . 
  from swedish `` gatlopp '' .

  and if we count the element tungsten , we should also count nobelium ( from alfred nobel ) , gadolinium ( from johan gadolin ) , yttrium ( from ytterby ) , ytterbium ( from ytterby ) , erbium ( again , from ytterby ) , terbium ( take a guess ) , holmium ( from stockholm ) and skandium ( from skandinavien ) . 
  we do a lot but we could always do more .

  now it 's about damage control .

  after some research i 've determined that the map is a coloured version of a map originally from `` peter frost , 2006 .

  i do n't know how the data was gathered . 
  i have n't found a version of `` beals & hoijer '' that is n't behind a paywall .

  there definitely would be a referendum , but the decision would technically lie entirely with the government . 
  only referendums regarding changes to the constitution are binding . 
  it would be difficult politically to go against the referendum , but it has happened before when we voted against switching to right-hand traffic in ' 55 . 
  in my region ( scandinavia ) i 'd say denmark . 
  state : direct democracy society : secular progressive cosmopolitanism system : social liberalism my center is between left and modernism . 
  most of my budget got into welfare due to universal basic income and universal basic pension . 
  i do n't think we are able to support that until most jobs has been automated though . 
  sweden 2014 data , from the global health observatory data repository linked in my other post . 
  data | average | male | female -- | -- :| -- :| -- : mean body mass index ( bmi ) | 26.0 | 26.7 | 25.3 obesity ( body mass index \u2265 30 ) , age-standardized | 20.0 % | 21.4 % | 18.6 % overweight ( body mass index \u2265 25 ) , age-standardized | 55.75 % | 62.6 % | 48.9 % i have not personally seen any fat shaming in sweden . 
  it 's worth noting that it 's illegal to discriminate against overweight people in the eu : https://www.asil.org/insights/volume/19/issue/9/european-court-justice-rules-obesity-discrimination, 
  for reference : here is data with overweight population , obese population and mean body mass index ( bmi ) of population from the global health observatory ( gho ) by the who : http://www.who.int/gho/ncd/risk_factors/overweight/en/, 
  if it was n't for bamse and his pals , i would have been a lesser person today . 
  obviously le pen . 
  the recent rise of right wing populism is worrying . 
  moose , icehockey , snow , free healthcare and located just north of a loud-mouthed country . 
  you assume correctly . 
  no need to fight . 
  the correct pronunciation of * kex * is * tjex * . 
  of course . 
  cern pushes the boundary of human knowledge in a way no other institution can do . 
  apparently people from stockholm are the most tattooed people in the world ( excluding tribal people ) . 
  33 % of people between 18 -- 49 has a tattoo . 
  [ swedish source ] ( http://www.metro.se/artikel/stockholmarna-v%c3%a4rldens-mest-tatuerade-folk-xr ), 
  probably manual still , although most of the new cars being sold has automatic . 
  it seems to be growling in sweden . 
  a little less than 8 % growth per year . 
  not as popular as archery , boule or climbing , but more popular than minigolf , fencing and rugby . 
  i could see myself going to an nfl-game for curiosity 's sake , but i would n't pay full price . 
  nope , not going to go there . 
  come on . 
  the banter is * mandatory * , you know that . 
  possibly . 
  he might be deaf and was reading the subtitles . 
  in the outer western suburbs of stockholm there is rinkeby swedish , aka shobre swedish . 
  an eclectic mix of swedish , turkish , kurdish , ex-yugoslavian languages , romani , persian and arabic . 
  a common greeting is `` sho bre '' , `` sho '' from arabic and `` bre '' from yugoslavian .

  he ** looked at ** the show , he did n't listen to it . 
  when you read danish it does n't look to bad . 
  but when you hear it spoken it sounds like a stroke victim who 's about to throw up talking . 
  scandinavia is just the scandinavian peninsula ( norway , sweden ) and denmark . 
  we have mutually intelligible languages ( although the intelligibility of danish can be disputed ) . 
  the nordics also include finland and iceland . 
  the non-sovereign but autonomous territories \u00c5land islands , faroe islands and greenland are also part of the nordics . 
  [ mother svea ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mother_svea ) edit : we also use the gender neutral `` fosterland '' , i.e. 
  the land which has fostered us . 
  in this case fast food , i.e. 
  burgers . 
  this was the restaurant in my example categorized as `` american '' : https://benandsams.se/food-menu/, 
  i do n't mind . 
  i mean the armour , cape and especially the hammer look a bit silly , but at least they do n't have cow horns on their helmets . 
  the stockholm public transport system is excellent imho . 
  i think most new cars are sold with a automatic transmission nowadays . 
  one big reason that manual was more popular was that automatic was long thought of as a cop-out for less skilled drivers who could n't use a stick . 
  some advantages with manual : * more control * better fuel economy * less maintenance needed * earlier automatic transmissions had some performance loss from the torque converter . 
  * cheaper, 
  some info for those curious : * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_overseas_colonies * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_colonization_of_the_americas, 
  no real connection , but / r/sweden recently reconnected with r/maryland due to our cooperation on r/place / . 
  i do n't think most swedes even know we had colonies in the gold coast and the antilles . 
  not out in the open , except online . 
  it 's hard to tell who is a batshit crazy nazi , and who is simply anti-immigration as they both unite under the conservative populism of the sweden democrats . 
  swedish drug laws governing personal use are way to strict . 
  i think we could adopt a policy somewhere between that of the netherlands and ( i should not be saying this publicly ) denmark . 
  stromae 's music definitely has hip-hop influences , but i would categorize it as primarily house since it 's usually based on a four-to-the-floor base drum rather than percussive breaks which is typical of hip hop . 
  everyone has different ideas of what defines a music genre and it 's not wrong to call it hip hop . 
  some songs are more house like `` alors on danse '' and `` house ` llelujah '' and some are more hip-hop , like `` formidable '' and `` carmen '' . 
  i 've been to germany several times and every time i try to speak to them in german they reply in english . 
  granted that my german is n't very good , but it 's hard to develop conversational german when you ca n't practice . 
  depends on what you are into . 
  if you are into the history of the middle ages you could try visby in sweden during [ medieval week ] ( http://www.medeltidsveckan.se/en/ ) . 
  best in what way ? 
  for tourism ? 
  most foods , at least in stockholm . 
  some examples : thai , italian , indian , palestinian , persian , american , vietnamese , swedish husmanskost , sushi , steak , pizza , tapas etc. 
  examples taken from : https://hungrig.se/stockholm/restaurang-takeaway/11120,
