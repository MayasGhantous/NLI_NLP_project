  it 's a contraction of `` h\u00f6r du ? '', 
  - `` do you hear ? '' . 
  the punk genre is called oi !, 
  or oi-punk . 
   * first they ignore you . 
  then they ridicule you . 
  and then they attack you and want to burn you . 
  and then they build monuments to you . 
  i have a somewhat eclectic musical taste , and i do n't follow that many artists . 
  when i find a song i like from an artist/band i usually go through their discography and scavenge the songs i like and put them in my collection . 
  some examples of bands/artists with multiple songs i like : * manu chao ( alternative/ska ) - french/spanish * stromae ( house ) - french * korpiklaani ( folk metal ) - finnish i also listen to some german bands ( mostly synth/industrial ) , but i can understand most of it due to my school german . 
  we could teach them a thing or two about pizza , spaghetti with meatballs and coffee . 
  the poles . 
  we have surstr\u00f6mming , norway has rakfisk and iceland has h\u00e1karl . 
  you should get with the nordic tradition and get your own stinky fish dish . 
  well , your national dish is a sandwich . 
  you are n't in a position to criticise surstr\u00f6mming . 
  correction : the rest of the world is like 50 years behind ** the nordics ** in pizza innovation . 
  calm down . 
  it 's an emulsion of three ingredients : oil , egg yolk , and vinegar . 
  not a complex fine-dining endeavour in gastronomy like a banana-curry pizza . 
  our experiments with pizza toppings is for the gastronomical advancement of humanity and the betterment of mankind . 
  banana + curry pizza will be a standard pizza soon , mark my words . 
  the rest of the world is like 50 years behind us in pizza innovation . 
  at least we do n't put mayonnaise on our french fries . 
  i personally like pre-swedish history , i.e. 
  up to and including the viking age . 
  but the period were sweden dominated was stormaktstiden , lit . 
  `` the great power times '' or `` the era of great power '' . 
  we deemed them superfluous and sent them to denmark . 
   sk\u00e6rtorsdag ( cut-thursday ) [ ... ] possibly because thursday jesus and his disciples cut the meat and bread etc. 
  danish sk\u00e6r - has the same etymology as the swedish [ sk\u00e4r - ] ( http://www.saob.se/artikel/?unik=s_05853-0057.v8cw&amp;pz=5 ) . 
  it means to make clean , cleanse , purify , wash etc. 
  compare with `` sk\u00e6rsilden '' . 
  the name sk\u00e6rtorsdag comes from when jesus washed the feet of his disciples . 
  the week is called stilla veckan ( still week ) or more commonly p\u00e5skveckan ( easter week ) . 
  * sunday - palms\u00f6ndagen ( palm sunday ) * 1 . 
  * monday - bl\u00e5m\u00e5ndagen ( blue monday ) * 1 . 
  * tuesday - vita tisdagen ( white tuesday ) * 1 . 
  * wednesday - dymmelonsdagen ( `` wooden church bell stick '' day ) * 1 . 
  thursday - sk\u00e4rtorsdagen ( purifying thursday ) 1 . 
  friday - l\u00e5ngfredagen ( long friday ) 1 . 
  saturday - p\u00e5skafton ( easter eve ) 1 . 
  sunday - p\u00e5skdagen ( easter day ) 1 . 
  monday - annandag p\u00e5sk ( second day easter , boxing day easter ) only the names from thursday ( sk\u00e4rtorsdagen ) through monday ( annandag p\u00e5sk ) are in common use . 
  note that the main celebrations are on saturday ( p\u00e5skafton ) . 
  the first thing that comes to mind is [ peps persson - oh boy . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cimlsj0tuxq ) sung with a scanian ( south swedish ) dialect . 
  -- less famous , but '' [ dumt f\u00f4lk ] ( https://sv.wikisource.org/wiki/dumt_f%c3%b4lk ) '' by gustaf fr\u00f6ding is written with a thick v\u00e4rmland dialect . 
  it 's a short piece of prose highlighting that v\u00e4rmland dialect can be almost unintelligible for someone not familiar with the dialect . 
  it features the line : `` d\u2019 \u00e4 e \u00e5 , \u00e5 i \u00e5a \u00e4 e \u00f6 '' . 
  standard swedish translation : `` d\u00e4r \u00e4r en \u00e5 , och i \u00e5n \u00e4r en \u00f6 '' english translation : `` there is a creek , and in the creek there is an island '', 
  yes , but they are more limited . 
  afaik only sweden and norway allows overnight camping with a camp fire . 
  allemansr\u00e4tten is a constitutional right in sweden and it 's forbidden for land owners to put up fences and `` no trespassing '' signs . 
  allemansr\u00e4tten ( the everyman 's right ) . 
  the constitutional right to roam , make camp , build a fire , pick berries and mushrooms and fish ( in some lakes ) on privately owned undeveloped land . 
  many other nordic countries also have their version of `` the everyman 's right '' . 
  no , but the fact that they have been passed unanimously suggests that the un is united against nk . 
  the us do n't hate mexicans , they hate an influx of poor people that threatens their way of life . 
  i think most us americans would also agree with the claim `` i would like to have mexicans instead of middle easterners in the us '' . 
  i think most people from europe supporting that claim are not against arabs per se , but the fundamentalist islamic minority within the minority . 
  unlike mexicans who integrate easily given the chance , fundamentalists cling to sharia values rather than try to integrate . 
  quite common . 
  over half the population use swish . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swish_ ( payment ), 
  neither of those list the swedish pronunciation . 
  this might be of interest : education first english proficiency index : http://www.ef.se/epi/regions/europe/, 
  very , on both questions . 
  it seems they start teaching it in grade one now according to the [ curriculum ] ( https://www.skolverket.se/laroplaner-amnen-och-kurser/grundskoleutbildning/grundskola/engelska ) ( in swedish ) . 
  edit : wrong link . 
  `` mejmej '' swedish phonetic rendering of the english mispronunciation may-may . 
  the `` mejmej '' spelling/pronunciation is so ubiquitous that it has almost become the standard way of spelling ( it 's at least the standard spelling in / r/sweden ) . 
  the real pronunciation is `` mem '' [ me\u02d0m ] , but it 's a common meme to write/pronounce it `` mejmej '' . 
  it was a fair military target and no civilians were killed , but the bombing was more something to fulfil trumps promise of `` gon na bomb the shit out of 'em ! '', 
  rather than of significant military value . 
  yes , that 's the only risk . 
  china seems to be on board for now and they seem resolutely against all nk nuclear and missile tests . 
  i do n't see the strategic value for china in maintaining their alliance . 
  there is also the possibility that if china feels threatened by nk nukes , they will just waltz into north korea through their shared border and destroy everything even related to their nuclear program , and possibly even annex nk . 
  sweden would be a coconut that has locked itself into an underground bunker and welded the door shut . 
  i think north korea should be handled by the un . 
  the un might actually get of its ass and do something this time as the un security council seems to be unanimous against north korea . 
   people belonging to some cultures are generally more easy-going , smile at each other , politely talk to everyone and are helpful . 
  however , when you are trying to truly befriend them , it might take more effort -- their privacy is protected by a shell inside . 
  these are the '' ** peach ** '' cultures . 
  examples of countries with `` peach '' cultures are america and japan . 
    in some cultures , on the other hand , you need to do your homework to befriend somebody : they do n't engage in conversations easily , rarely smile at people they do n't know , keep to themselves and are n't perceived as being particularly friendly . 
  however , when you get to know them , they change completely : initial coldness changes into loyal friendship . 
  russians and germans are often described as members of this '' ** coconut ** '' culture . 
  ( emphasis mine ) http://creativecultureint.com/peach-or-coconut/, 
  i mostly play ranked cooperative games like dota , which strongly disincentives people to `` ruin things for everyone '' . 
  it could very well be because shitty russian kids are bad mannered in russian instead of english , one can identify them as bad mannered * russians * , as opposed to bad mannered anonymous people . 
  but out of the people speaking russian in team chat most of them have n't been very nice compared to those who speak other non-english languages between themselves . 
  pretty much all my interactions with russians have been through online games and they have generally not been very favourable ( cyka blyad ) . 
  is this a vocal minority or do russians in general have a `` different '' view on online etiquette ? 
  it 's a thing , but most people i know usually use it to get updates from celebrities , organizations or companies etc rather than to socialise . 
  i do n't mind weird pizza toppings . 
  in sweden it 's quite common to put kebab meat , pineapple , tenderloin with b\u00e9arnaise sauce or banana and curry on our pizzas ( obviously not on the same pizza ) . 
  in principle you can put anything on top of a pizza as you can put anything in a maki-roll , they are both foods suited for experimenting .
