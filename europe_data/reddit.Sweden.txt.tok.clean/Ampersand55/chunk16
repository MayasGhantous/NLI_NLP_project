  but the whole idea about sushi is that they are bite-sized `` mini meals '' where the ingredients are carefully proportioned to form a balanced unit . 
  in these monstrous blobs the first bite will just be a mouthful of dried seaweed and rice . 
  i can allow proper [ temaki cones ] ( http://www.sakura-hostel.co.jp/blog/menu_showimg.jpg ) if they are smaller than an ice cream cone . 
  i 'm not japanese , but as a sushi lover i feel that i still have to say something about [ sushi burritos ] ( https://i.redditmedia.com/oapcqj7wtfs4uulxf3snxuufd6qdn_fe0nbcujbmfou.jpg?w=539&amp;s=a3077932140b8f143ac6cc2dadcdd3ab ) . 
  i mean , what the hell is that ? 
  takes a lot of people to spin that cage of numbered balls , play that soft nondescript muzak , operate the tv-studio etc. 
  [ the rest are supported by keno-winnings ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu0tvsixm-w ) . 
  if you want to compare continents then africa and asia probably has equal or higher rates of war . 
  we just do n't learn about them in school as western education is focused on western history . 
  it 's not fair to compare a diverse continent with a single country . 
  why do you north americans have so much crime , drug trafficking and strife in guatemala ? 
  it was n't . 
  we were n't in the ww2 . 
  we 've been enjoying the longest continuous time of peace in modern history now for over 200 years and counting . 
  [ america has been at war 93 % of the time -- 222 out of 239 years -- since 1776 ] ( http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2015/02/america-war-93-time-222-239-years-since-1776.html ), 
  some accents may be perceived as more neutral , but there is no `` most correct '' version of any language . 
  everyone has a dialect/accent . 
  adding : gothenburg - everyone is called `` glenn '' , is jolly , works at the docks , uses snus and makes shitty puns which only themselves laugh at . 
  gotland - they are still in the dark ages . 
  most people are sheep herders or work at the keno-lottery . 
  favourite past time : jousting , incest and weird medieval games like throwing flat rocks on a stick . 
  yes definitely . 
  it 's unfortunate that the quran was written during a time of warring and persecution of muslims by meccans . 
  this gives the fundamentalists plenty of stuff to draw on to justify jihadism . 
  i believe that the rise of terrorism in the last 20 years is to a large degree the effect of us interventionism in the middle east . 
  from an outside perspective , the most famous brand is probably absolut vodka and most famous alcoholic beverage might be akvavit or gl\u00f6gg ( mulled wine ) . 
  edit : many will probably associate sweden with mead , but that 's hardly ever drunk here . 
  it was the favourite to win and it came second . 
  from a tactical perspective i do n't disagree with letting foreign jury 's vote on the winner , as it is those who will be deciding in the eurovision finals . 
  the song that won the popular vote ( [ nano - hold on ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb9eohxytfe ) ) was pretty good , but the one that got selected due to higher combined score ( [ robin bengtsson - i ca n't go on ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjd6ll3rp6s ) ) was pretty meh . 
  there were some controversy when the israel jury gave nano zero points ( nano being palestinian ) . 
  i agree . 
  the people of stockholm , the police , the authorities and ( most of ) the media were exemplary . 
  we were united and we did n't panic even with suspected armed terrorists on the loose . 
  people were opening their homes , offering food and giving rides to strangers who got stuck in stockholm due to the cancelled subways . 
  people were out offering fika to the police and they in turn found the time to help old ladies passing the street . 
  the national task force were mobilised and on site within minutes , and we quickly got a picture out of the driver and he was soon arrested with the help of the public . 
  there were no witch hunting , rumours were swiftly quenched , the press conferences were informative and inspiring . 
  i love sweden . 
  i think swedish women are beautiful , but i 'm genetically predisposed to do so . 
  it 's a common trope that swedish women are considered beautiful . 
  http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/sexyscandinavian but this ca n't be ( or at least has n't been ) objectively measured . 
  i 've read `` horla '' by maupassant and i really enjoyed it , has he written anything more like it ? 
  * candide * definitely is part of european literature canon , but victor hugo is mostly known for * les mis\u00e9rables * and * the hunchback of notre-dame * . 
  i do n't think most people have heard of maurice druon , maupassant or louis-ferdinand c\u00e9line . 
  i tried to limit myself to novels i 've read , but yes she 's pretty popular here as well . 
  other crime fiction writers include liza marklund , viveca sten , leif g.w. 
  persson and lars kepler . 
  many have probably heard of the millennium series ( e.g. 
  the girl with the dragon tattoo ) , but they might not know that we have a long tradition of crime fiction . 
  * h\u00e5kan nesser - the van veeteren novels ( e.g. 
  the mind 's eye ) * henning mankell - the kurt wallander novels ( e.g. 
  the fifth woman ) * sj\u00f6wall / wahl\u00f6\u00f6 - the martin beck novels ( e.g. 
  the laughing policeman ) some other modern suggestions : * john ajvide lindqvist - let the right one in * fredrik backman - a man called ove * jonas jonasson - the hundred-year-old man who climbed out the window and disappeared * mikael niemi - popular music from vittula * majgull axelsson - april witch some swedish classics : * harry martinson - the road ( v\u00e4gen till klockrike ) * august strindberg - the people of hems\u00f6 * selma lagerl\u00f6f - g\u00f6sta berling 's saga * hjalmar s\u00f6derberg - the serious game * p\u00e4r lagerkvist - the dwarf, 
  i 'm not suggesting we should try to rewrite history . 
  i 'm just saying that we can choose which parts to celebrate . 
  absolutely !, 
  i think they could have chosen another motif from greek mythology rather than when europe 's namesake was being abducted , raped and then discarded . 
  nicely aligned too . 
  it looks like a cartoon jesus who has swallowed his cross . 
  wtf cyprus : * https://www.ecb.europa.eu/euro/coins/common/shared/img/cy/2e.gif * https://www.ecb.europa.eu/euro/coins/common/shared/img/cy/1e.gif, 
  no country ( except of course sweden ) is mentioned by name in the swedish primary school history curriculum except for the fall of the soviet union . 
  the greco-roman world is indirectly referred to as the classical antiquity . 
  everything i 've learned about lithuanian history i 've learned through eu4 . 
  i 'll try very hard not to downvote you for expressing your opinions . 
  but can you explain why you feel that way ? 
  what makes those deserve to die ? 
  do you think terrorism is justified ? 
  is this a genuine question or are you just trolling or trying to be edgy ? 
  i ca n't see how you can justify thinking this way . 
  i hope you do n't mind , but i checked both options on some questions which i deemed unanswerable . 
  all countries that surround the mediterranean sea . 
  when i mean just south european i use the term south european . 
  stay in . 
  i think it 's a useful but somewhat vague geopolitical distinction with neither good nor bad connotations . 
  no , but i love sweden . 
  yep . 
  great movie . 
  i never heard about that game . 
  i first heard about wendigo from the movie * ravenous * . 
  i used to play , but i have n't done so recently . 
  why do you ask ? 
  what are your thoughts about uwe boll ? 
  that 's for practical reasons though , and it has nothing to do with attraction per se . 
  like , if you really were attracted to a girl and then suddenly became repulsed by her upon hearing that she was muslim , that would be weird . 
  the first thing that comes to mind is the \u00c5sa-nisse movies , which were a bunch of crude , burlesque comedy films . 
  they made like 20 of those featuring john elfstr\u00f6m in the 50s-60s , each one more horrible than the last , and then a modern god-awful remake with kjell bergqvist as \u00c5sa-nisse . 
  it confuses me to no end why they are so popular . 
  their ratings range from 3.1-4 .5 on imdb , and that 's imho generous ratings : http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0043401/filmorate, 
  hey , we do n't have to be rude . 
  just because most of our folklore has older roots does n't mean that us folklore ca n't be interesting or authentic . 
  i think the wendigo myth is pretty cool . 
  like pointy oblate spheroids with laces on one side , why ? 
  i think it 's being normalized within the eu where a minimum drinking age of 18 is the most common . 
  yes . 
  nhl is somewhat popular , but not as popular as our local shl . 
  most people have heard of the top swedish players playing in the nhl . 
  but basically no one follows nba/nfl/mbl . 
  basketball is played competitively in sweden and it 's probably a top 20 sport in terms of popularity , but handegg and baseball have very small leagues and almost no one can name a team or player . 
  not * our * borders , but many wants to change the borders of israel to make room for palestine .
