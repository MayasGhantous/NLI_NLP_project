  sweden is currently the battleground of a propaganda war between alt-right and leftists , and it 's likely that most things you 've read about the immigration situation in sweden was biased and politically motivated ( for either side ) rather than objective reporting . 
  you 'll probably be fine , even if you were a muslim . 
  sweden is a very tolerant country . 
  yes mumin !, 
  i immediately got nostalgia overload and got the humming part stuck in my brain . 
  * [ knight rider ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onyxyphnuis ), 
   there once was a swedish pm who publicly condemned the us involvement in vietnam and led protest marches . 
  after comparing american bombings to the holocaust , the us suspended relations with sweden . 
  just to be clear , this is what he ( olof palme in his speech on christmas 1972 ) said :  therefore the bombing [ of hanoi ] is an atrocity . 
  and we have many examples of that in modern history . 
  and they are generally associated with a name : guernica , oradour , babij jar , katy\u0144 , lidice , sharpeville , treblinka . 
  there violence has triumphed . 
  but posterity has judged those responsible harshly . 
   now another name is added to the list : hanoi , christmas 1972 . 
  ( freely translated by yours truly ) i personally think that eu leaders should indeed condemn any war crime . 
  i 've not visited or gone sight seeing in them all , but i 'm sure they have their charm as well . 
  nyhavn in copenhagen is really pretty . 
  but what i like about stockholm is that it 's integrated with the water with gamla stan being the [ centre island ] ( http://twistedsifter.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/stockholm-sweden-aerial-yann-arthus-bertrand.jpg ) filled with old buildings . 
  i 'm of-course biased , but i also really like gamla stan in stockholm .

  [ marie fors\u00e5 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marie_fors%c3%a5 ) also did many pornographic and sexploitation films .

  us under obama would have been ok , but not the current us under trump . 
  japan , probably south korea depending on how they handle their recent political scandal . 
  uruguay , chile and costa rica , stable democracies without much corruption . 
   why are muslims , islam and islamic practices treated as less authentically european than christianity or other ways of living ? 
  how can we be accepted ? 
  christianity has been forced to accommodate fundamental human rights , such as acceptance of homosexuality , divorce , premarital sex and abortion . 
  we ask islam to do the same with their values which are incompatible with fundamental human rights . 
  we also performed human experiments on mentally disabled people up until 1955 . 
  we rotted their teeth to see the effects of sugar on tooth decay .

  not too much and not too little , an appropriate amount . 
  a short social break from an activity where you share a pot of coffee and light snacks or something equivalent . 
  i 'm aware of the distinction , but it 's as you said political . 
  i chose the term tornedalsfinska to group it with the per\u00e4pohjola dialect spoken in torne valley rather than me\u00e4nkieli which is also spoken in g\u00e4llivare and jukkasj\u00e4rvi to illustrate my point about similarity with finland . 
  one can read about the differences here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/per%c3%a4pohjola_dialects edit : accidentally a word . 
  i do n't know if this counts , but the last time i laughed was when i did research for my thread [ what does your country 's english accent sound like and how is it portrayed in uk/us media ? 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/612ooq/what_does_your_countrys_english_accent_sound_like/ ) and came across a swedish accent video by a supposed dialect coach : * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onqknq4h-os&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=13, 
  many swedes think that sk\u00e5ne is basically a part of denmark , and that we should [ dig it up ] ( http://gravbortskane.se/ ) and tow it back . 
  it 's of course a joke , but sk\u00e5ne does have some danish influences . 
  the swedish-finnish border have many finnish speaking or semi-finnish ( tornedalsfinska ) speaking people . 
  the sami people of norway , sweden and finland have more in common with each other than the country they live in . 
  i think the biggest mistake you brits do when queuing is try to make the queuing less of a drudging experience by engaging in small talk . 
  we swedes enter a detached zen state when queuing , and form a collective emotionless organism , inching forward with clockwork precision .

  shitstormers can ( try to ) form a line and i 'll get to them in due order . 
  tipping has probably become less common here since everyone started paying with card instead of cash . 
  when there is a money trail you 'll have to pay tax on tips , and because of that it seems that many services do n't bother . 
  i pretty much only tip in restaurants and in busy bars ( for selfish reasons , to get service quicker ) . 
  * writing passive-aggressive notes . 
  * forming , maintaining and following a queue in an ordered and disciplined fashion . 
  leif `` loket '' olsson also has a think gothenburg accent but i would n't associate that with any social class . 
  well , maybe it 's different in g\u00f6teborg , but in stockholm accents are more regional based than social . 
  \u00d6stermalmsdialekt is associated with high social status because its spoken in rich districts , but you could very well find a cab driver with that accent . 
  i do not deny that the king has some stockholmian features in his speech , but i would n't rule out that he was a brick layer . 
   again , a myth people from that area like to tell themselves . 
  nothing can be based or rikssvenska because it is n't a real accent , it is merely a set of qualities arbitrarily chosen as a `` standard '' , nobody speaks it naturally , and you ca n't have a local variation of it because the defining feature of rikssvenska is that it is impossible to place geographically . 
  is there a non-arbitrary distinction between an accent , a dialect and a set of phonetic qualities ? 
  i do not agree with your strict definition of rikssvenska . 
  it 's more of a set of common features between a large variety of regions and rikssvenska can vary between regions .

  what you are looking for is the [ purchasing power parity ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/purchasing_power_parity ) ( ppp ) , the purchasing power relative to the exchange rate . 
  a good tool for this is the [ big mac index ] ( http://www.economist.com/content/big-mac-index ) from the economist . 
  tl ; dr : ukraine is a good bet . 
  some might talk about classes in general as a political thing , but you would never identify individuals as being from a certain class as they do in the uk . 
  maybe you have a better ear for accents than me , but if i did n't know him i would never guess that the king was royal by the way he speaks . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylh_lj4-fey of course everyone has an accent , but on the east coast from nyk\u00f6ping to sundsvall it 's varieties of rikssvenska . 
   so , you could n't distinguish a member of the royal family from a manual labourer on the basis of accent ? 
  nope . 
  equality has long been a political core value thing in sweden . 
   we can generally identify the social class somebody grew up in as soon as they open their mouth . 
  somebody with a very working-class accent would definitely be looked down upon in some professional situations , and somebody with a very upper-class accent would definitely be laughed at if they were working a menial job . 
  it makes me somewhat uncomfortable when i watch british panel shows and they joke about each other being of a certain class . 
  it 's the same way with `` race '' . 
  however \u00f6stermalmsdialekt ( the dialect spoken around the \u00d6stermalm and liding\u00f6 districts in stockholm ) is considered posh . 
  not really , but we do n't really acknowledge the concept of social classes in sweden . 
  however , in the swedish speaking part of finland they called swedish as spoken by swedes ( as opposed to fenno-swedish spoken by finns ) high swedish ( h\u00f6gsvenska ) which suggests that it is ( or was ) above fenno-swedish . 
   the definition of h\u00f6gsvenska ( literally `` high swedish '' ) was formerly the same as for rikssvenska , the most prestigious dialect spoken in ( the capital of ) sweden . 
  during the 20th century , its meaning changed , and it now denotes the prestige dialect of the swedish speakers in helsinki . 
  do n't they speak [ \u00f6stg\u00f6tska ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y71ei6wzhfu ) in norrk\u00f6ping ? 
  standard swedish ( rikssvenska ) is not really localized , it 's generally defined as an accent which is n't connected to a particular location , but uppsala is typically a region given as an example of where you speak rikssvenska . 
  in sweden we often say `` en stor stark '' ( a large strong [ one ] ) , referring to a 0.5 l glass of the house lager beer on tap with around 5 % alcohol by volume . 
  in some places you only get 0.4 l or 0.35 l , but fuck those places . 
  it 's discouraged but not regulated by law . 
  you can make a private arrangement where the mother adopts the child from the surrogate mother , but the surrogate does n't have any special rights to the baby before it is adopted . 
  true , i should perhaps have clarified that livgardet has several ceremonial guards *** in addition to their other duties *** . 
  sweden also has a [ livgardet ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/life_guards_\\ ( sweden \\ ) ) , which has several ceremonial guards ( paradstyrkor ) .
