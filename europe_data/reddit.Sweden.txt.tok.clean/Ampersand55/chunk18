  it 's not the only thing in that law . 
  just one example . 
  for reference , it was from 12 kap 1 \u00a7 : https://lagen.nu/1736:0123_1#k12p1s1, 
  we still have some antiquated laws in effect . 
  for example byggningabalken which states that you have to pay a fine of one mark ( the mark was discontinued in 1776 ) for each swine over the agreed amount you let into a jointly owned forest of acorn trees . 
  [ the eiffel tower . 
  ] ( https://cdn.getyourguide.com/img/tour_img-376513-70.jpg ) possibly the most iconic landmark in the world . 
  a symbol of the modern world , both as a feat of technology and engineering , and as a symbol of the french revolution ( erected at the 100th anniversary of the storming of the bastille ) , marking the downfall of feudalism and entering an era ruled by the people . 
  the tension between immigrants , refugees and their supporters and the emerging nationalist right wing . 
  from the [ european convention on human rights ] ( http://www.echr.coe.int/documents/convention_eng.pdf ) .

  i apologize , i read that wrong . 
  well your face has very few world class skiers . 
  not as popular as cross country . 
  slalom is by far the most popular discipline and ingmar stenmark , anja p\u00e4rson and pernilla wiberg are well known athletes . 
  frida hansdotter and andr\u00e9 myhrer are known to people into winter sports , but not so much to the general public . 
  russia has always been seen as our only credible geopolitical threat . 
  we very recently reinstituted mandatory military service , mostly due to russia 's recent military movements . 
  it 's not that we fear an invasion of our own country , we 're worried of their expanded military influence around the baltic sea . 
  the government appoints a committee to investigate the prerequisites for the law and they write a report . 
  the report is sent to the concerned parties and authorities and they give their input . 
  the government examines the comments and drafts a proposal for a law which is sent to the council on legislation to make sure it 's compatible with our other laws . 
  the government processes the proposal and sends it to the parliament . 
  yet another committee leaves their input . 
  finally , the parliament vote on it . 
  maybe not . 
  but as there the cross country skiing season going on maybe it could be one of those . 
  i recently found a discontinued 1000 kronor bill :(, 
  the last \u00f6re-coin ( 50 \u00f6re ) was discontinued for general use 1 oct 2010 , and you could exchange them in banks until 31 mars 2011 . 
  do n't confuse value with worth . 
  $ 0.105 largest : 1000 kronor ( [ front ] ( http://www.riksbank.se/documents/bilder/sedlar_giltiga/2015/new_1000/specimen/1000_new_sedel_specimen_fram.png ) / [ back ] ( http://www.riksbank.se/documents/bilder/sedlar_giltiga/2015/new_1000/specimen/1000_new_sedel_specimen_bak.png ) ) $ 105 ( pictured : former un secretary dag hammarskj\u00f6ld ), 
  it 's lucky for the environment . 
  for the consumers it just means the deposit is added to the sales price . 
  never thought about it . 
  we use almost the full range of metric prefixes , except for deca . 
  * centilitres for beverages * decilitres for cream * hectograms for bulk confectionery ( many stores have switched to kilograms now though ), 
  yes , for beverages . 
  why is that weird ? 
  container | deposit ( sek ) | deposit ( euro ) -- | -- | -- 33 cl glass bottle | 0.60 | 0.063 50 cl glass bottle | 0.90 | 0.095 aluminium can | 1 | 0.105 plastic bottle < = 1 litre ( pet ) | 1 | 0.105 plastic bottle  1 litre ( pet ) | 2 | 0.210, 
  maybe zlatan ibrahimovi\u0107 . 
  finland might be your best bet if you can get in . 
  swedes were mentioned in foreign sources before danes , we just did n't see the need to form a unified sovereign state until we learned just how vicious you danes were when you executed 80 -- 90 people of our nobility and clergy who were promised amnesty during the [ stockholm bloodbath ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stockholm_bloodbath ) . 
  then we unified under gustav i eriksson vasa and drove you demons back from whence you came . 
  randi-scandi : the word for estionians is also girl 's name in swedish ( ester ) . 
  ( a randi-scandi is a random scandinavian fact , taken from the panelshow qi ) . 
  fun fact : estonia used to be part of sweden and thereby nordic , but some backstabbing fucks which shall not be named sided with russia in the great northern war and let them take it from us . 
  nah , we hate norway too . 
  fucking cheating , blood doping , cross-country skiers :(, 
  who knows how and when it started , [ sweden and denmark has been warring since before our nations were formed ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/2g2h99/danes_vs_swedes/ckf83ng/ ) , and sweden have at some point subjugated both finland and norway , so there is some lingering tension there . 
  sweden is also the central country between our fennoscandinavian neighbours , so it 's natural our they all measure themselves against us . 
  we now mostly bicker out of habit and nostalgia and it 's more akin to sibling rivalry than a serious beef , at least for the most of us . 
  i fondly remember reading astrid lindgren 's the brothers lionheart as a young boy . 
  to quote a swedish saying :  there is no bad weather , only bad clothing . 
  that 's what i tell myself when i 'm cold and miserable waiting for the bus in a blizzard . 
  i feel it 's my national duty as a citizen of sweden to answer denmark to this question . 
  the crazy jesus lady . 
  and old lady ( possibly schizophrenic ) who randomly chases people and raves incoherently about the day of judgement on the streets of stockholm and on the subway . 
  there are several youtube clips of her in action : https://www.youtube.com/results?q=jesustanten&amp;sp=cam%253d edit : oops , i only read the title , but i 'm leaving this post here in honour of jesustanten . 
  in many ways she 's a `` special '' figure of stockholm . 
  no offence taken , but i hoped so and i still vote for them . 
  the icelandic pirate party is rather healthy and is still growing , i do n't see why sweden 's pirate party could n't do the same . 
  do you have separate containers for clear and coloured glass ? 
  it 's their best product second to the meatballs . 
  do n't they also call it `` the bbc english '' ? 
  the swedish public broadcaster also used to have an enforced dialect ( rikssvenska ) until recently . 
  under the sink : one bag for organic waste , one bag for misc household waste which goes into separate garbage bins . 
  paper/newspapers , cardboard , small metal containers ( like lids and cans ) , transparent glass and coloured glass i collect in ikea-bags and put in separate containers at the neighbourhood [ recycling station ] ( http://destinationbranas.se/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/atervinningsstationer.jpg ) . 
  non recyclable stuff like bulbs and electronics goes to the recycling central . 
  i literally cringed . 
  that was the most horrible ... 
  i ca n't even call it an attempt ... at finnish i 've ever heard . 
  maybe they all go to the same accent coach ? 
  * iron chef * za gaman aka endurance * susunu !, 
  * downtown no gaki no tsukai ya arahende aka gaki no tsukai aka no task for kids . 
  i 'm also a sucker for the super weird japanese game shows like akbingo and let 's go to the end of the world . 
  while they usually pronounce the v 's like f 's , their names are always pronounced `` herr wooogel '' . 
  one would think it 's harder to get away with a bad irish accent as people know what it is supposed to sound like due to the ( relative ) popularity of irish films and actors , but many film studios seems to think ireland is just leprechauns disguised as people . 
  btw , have you heard julia roberts in the mary reilly ? 
  i can guarantee that it 's a horror film that will horrify you . 
  almost never ( stockholm ) . 
  how the swedish accent is portrayed : * [ the swedish chef from the muppets ] ( https://youtu.be/myltknmeir4?t=17 ) * [ jamie lee curtis from trading places ] ( https://youtu.be/yasxnxebsle?t=9 ) * [ benny hill ] ( https://youtu.be/8qmbx_2eyfw?t=13 ) * [ swedish spoken by a supposed accent coach ] ( https://youtu.be/onqknq4h-os?t=13 ) if i cared , i would call the swedish chef 's accent offensive , jamie lee curtis and benny hill sounds more german than swedish and i do n't know what the accent coach has been smoking . 
  how a real swedish accent sounds : * [ ingrid bergman presents swedes in america ] ( https://youtu.be/brsqyiaqiv4?t=30 ) * [ hackerman shows how to hack time ] ( https://youtu.be/kekrwrhcdqu?t=28 ) .
