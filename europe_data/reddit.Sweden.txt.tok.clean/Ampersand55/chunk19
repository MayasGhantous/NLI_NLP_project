  * [ youtube star robbaz plays modded gta5 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f37gbomm3mi ) * [ alexander skarsg\u00e5rd exaggerating the swedish accent ( stockholm dialect ) ] ( https://youtu.be/przwpzfonxy?t=4 ) . 
  it as a bit hard to find clear examples of swedish accents as we usually try to suppress it . 
  the swedish accent in kung fury is really obvious to me , but maybe that 's just because i 'm swedish . 
  how does the accent sound to you ? 
  i 'd say about 70 % of my favourite tv-series are american . 
  hollywood is , for better and for worse , the popcultural capital of the world . 
  but other than tv-series ( and some talk shows , sketch shows and mythbusters ) , i generally do n't care for american tv . 
  the us versions of other countries shows are almost always worse , they always seem like they force every moment to be epic and it just comes of as fake and tacky . 
  the uk has far better game shows and panel shows , and japan has far better reality shows . 
  kids downloading mp3s and tv-series for personal use is seen as technically immoral , but not a big deal . 
  but if a company uses pirated software commercially or if someone sells pirated stuff it 's very frowned upon . 
  the swedish anti-piracy bureau is a powerful lobbying group backed by many organizations and companies , and they have gotten law changes in ( ipred-lagen ) to make it possible to prosecute , for instance , individuals torrenting stuff . 
  they mostly go after those who pirate swedish films and media . 
  we had a pretty big pirating counter-culture in sweden with organizations such as the swedish piracy bureau , the pirate party and the pirate bay . 
  but it has dwindled in recent years . 
  there are some weird antiquated laws in effect to give money to copyright holders . 
  we have a copyright collecting agency called stim which collects royalties every time a song from one if its members are broadcasted , played or performed and also a private copying levy on all writeable digital media , from vhs-cassettes to usb-sticks . 
  this amounts to an extra 320 sek ( $ 33 ) cost on hard drives , making the tech-savvy of us ordering them from other countries . 
  edit : misread your question . 
  i want swedish culture to survive because it 's part of who i am , and part of the life i lived , and i want that to somehow matter in the large scheme of things . 
  as long as they embraced the swedish core values and our culture , sweden could be inhabited by 90 % martians for all i care . 
  regional coffee rivalry is non-existent in stockholm afaik . 
  they speak english , have decent infrastructure and they generally seem like cool dudes . 
  the swedish comedy group * killingg\u00e4nget * has released two collections of short films : * fyra sm\u00e5 filmer ( dark comedy ) * fyra nyanser av brunt ( even darker comedy ) also : * [ kung fury official link ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs5p_laqivg ) ( [ backup link ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbfvqx7scou ) ) ( 80s retro action comedy ) * [ lights out ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knbje0y29_c ) ( horror ) edit : added descriptions and youtube links when available . 
  and the textbooks which cost like billion dollars each . 
  keep your name , but be prepared for people asking you about your genie . 
  we drink filter coffee . 
  usually dark , but sometimes with milk ( or cream in the southern parts of sweden ) . 
  some like it with sugar or sweetener . 
  we almost exclusively drink swedish brands , like gevalia , l\u00f6fbergs lila , arvid nordquist and zoegas . 
  we take short breaks a couple of times a day ( fika ) where we share a fresh pot of coffee and maybe some light snacks . 
  see the wikipedia entry on [ fika ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fika_\\ ( sweden \\ ) ) . 
  there is some latte-culture emerging in the cities . 
  there is no tuition fee in sweden . 
  we get a 2848 sek ( $ 323 ) student grant + 7168 sek ( $ 815 ) student loan per month ( more if we have children , travel expenses etc ) . 
  very generous interest rates . 
  semi-common swedish sayings : swedish | literal translation | meaning -- | -- | -- det var det det | that was that , that | and that was that h\u00f6r du du ( du ) | hear you , you ( you ) | hey you !, 
  h\u00e5 h\u00e5 , ja ja | ho ho , yes yes | an amused interjection, 
  repeated uses of `` and '' should work for most languages : swedish : \u00c4garen gillade inte skylten `` guld och smycken '' . 
  english : the owner did n't like the sign `` gold and jewellery '' . 
  it was to much space between `` gold '' and `` and '' , and `` and '' and `` jewellery '' . 
  technically , gustav vasa was democratically elected . 
  but i agree with tage erlander . 
  worst : definitely christian ii `` the tyrant '' of denmark . 
  a shameful part of our history during the union of kalmaris when we were ruled by our vile arch-enemy denmark . 
  his very first action as a king was executing 80-90 people of the swedish nobility and clergy despite of him promising them amnesty . 
  this incident is known as the [ stockholm bloodbath ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stockholm_bloodbath ) . 
  you can imagine he was n't a very popular king . 
  gustav vasa , a surviving son of one of the executed , dethroned the tyrant in a rebellion following the bloodbath is recognized as a great king mainly because of that . 
  gustavus adolphus and charles xii are recognized as great military leaders . 
  [ according to our resident swedish historian vonadler ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/1m90p9/good_afternoon_fellow_raskhistorians_i_am/cc7153x/?context=10000 ) , charles xi should also be thrown in the mix . 
  stings ... ( managed to ninja edit ) . 
  double enter and double space indent after . 
  a plant which gives you stings upon contact with the hairs under their leaves . 
  what language do they come from ? 
  i googled them all and the only hits are this thread ( damn , google works fast !, 
  some swedish proverbs : 1 . 
  * n\u00e4ra skjuter ingen hare * - * near does n't shoot a rabbit * . 
  to almost succeed is the same as to not succeed . 
  * ingen fara p\u00e5 taket , ( s\u00e5 l\u00e4nge skorstenen st\u00e5r ) * - * [ there is ] no danger on the roof ( as long as the chimney stands ) * . 
  it basically means do not worry . 
  a proverb with a similar meaning is * det \u00e4r ingen ko p\u00e5 isen ( s\u00e5 l\u00e4nge rumpan \u00e4r p\u00e5 land ) * - there is no cow on the ice ( as long as its ass are on land ) . 
  both proverbs are usually uttered without the words in the parentheses . 
  * - * [ a ] burnt child dreads the fire * . 
  one is weary of something if it has hurt one before . 
  similar to the english proverb * once bitten , twice shy * . 
  * - * do n't shout `` hey '' until you are over the creek * . 
  do not celebrate to early . 
  edit : i just have to add this idiom : * * att skita i det bl\u00e5 sk\u00e5pet * - * to shit in the blue cabinet . 
  * to go to far . 
  it 's illegal but somewhat common . 
  up to 50 grams it 's treated as a lesser narcotics crime and you get 30-150 day-fines ( a fine equivalent to between 30 and 150 days pay ) .

  i do n't know if this counts , but in sweden we have [ ** skagenr\u00f6ra ** ] ( http://www.norskfisk.se/var/ezflow_site/storage/images/b2c/recepter/sverige/skagenroera-laett/38548-2-swe-se/skagenroera-laett_large.jpg ) ( a shrimp , dill and mayonnaise stir ) , named after the danish city skagen .

  it 's a tie between two attacks for sweden . 
  the attack on the offices of the communist newspaper `` norrskensflamman '' in 1940 . 
  ** five persons were killed , including two children , and five more were injured . 
  i do not personally know much about the events , i quote [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flamman ) . 
   the 1940 arson attack  on the night of 3 march 1940 , an arson attack was made against the offices of norrskensflamman in lule\u00e5 . 
  the attack was the biggest political attack during the 1900s and considered a terrorist attack .
