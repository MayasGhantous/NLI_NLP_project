  i generally prefer estrella for crisps and olw for dipmix ( holiday ) . 
  red onions are a bit milder , but probably not . 
  the main difference in this case is probably the cut of the crisps . 
  sourcream and onion is one of the most popular flavours in sweden and olw has them in three different cuts : * regular : http://www.olw.se/sites/www.olw.se/files/styles/grid_4/public/field_product_image/sourcream_onion_275g.png?itok=8w6gmhs9 * waffle cut : http://www.olw.se/sites/www.olw.se/files/field_product_image/waffle_cut-sourcream_o_onion.png * big cut : http://www.olw.se/sites/www.olw.se/files/field_product_image/big_cut_red_onion_sourcream_200g.png, 
  crisps and dip , seedless grapes , salted almonds . 
  the current flavours of crisps from sweden 's two largest crisp manufacturers ( excluding temporary products ) . 
  estrella : * grilled paprika & garlic & chili * lentils & sourcream & onion * sourcream & onion * ramsons ( aka `` wild garlic '' ) & chili * cheddar chipotle * sourcream & onion * bbq ( onion ) * salt * dill * salt & vinegar * ranch & sourcream * black pepper * sourcream & paprika & onion * bbq & garlic * hot sweet chili olw : * cheddar & chipotle * sourcream & onion * sweet & smokey bbq * jalapeno & ranch * red onion & sourcream * sourcream & onion * bbq ( onion ) * dill & chives * cream cheese * 3 x onion * sourcream & chives * creamy taco * sourcream & cheese & onion & tomato & paprika * grilled cheese & onion -- texas style * sourcream & sweet chili * creamy bearnaise * cheese & parsley & horseradish * mushroom & garlic & tarragon * parsley & thyme & garlic * sourcream & chives & cucumber sources ( in swedish ) : * https://www.estrella.se/produkt/chips/ * http://www.olw.se/produkter variations with the same flavours such as mildly salted removed .

  lasers with a iec 60825-1 class of 3 or greater need special permission from the radiation safety authority ( str\u00e5ls\u00e4kerhetsmyndigheten ) : https://webstore.iec.ch/p-preview/info_iec60825-1%7bed1.2%7den.pdf, 
  the law applies for any laser equipment . 
  yes . 
  read again that small `` if '' statement . 
  you can carry whatever you want , unless you act threatening to other people . 
  we must be reading that text differently . 
  i read nothing about `` act threatening '' but rather `` can be used for violence or threats of violence '' . 
  according to wikipedia it 's still an offense to public safety , albeit not criminal , to carry `` cold weapons '' that can be used for violence or threats of violence in slovakia . 
   act no . 
  372/1990 offences act states in paragraph 47 that carrying of a `` cold weapon '' such as knife , dagger , or sabre on public places is a non-criminal offense to public safety if , from the circumstances of the case or the behaviour of the person , it can be concluded that these weapons can be used for violence or threats of violence . 
  it is up to the individual assessment of any single situation by a policeman whether carrying of such a weapon can lead to violence . 
  this offense can be penalized with maximum 500 eur . 
  an example of such a situation is visibly carrying of a knife in crowded public places , public meetings , etc. 
   i never understood those `` criminals will carry them too '' . 
  the same can be said for any type of weapon laws , including guns . 
  the less weapons of any kind on the streets the better imho . 
  potential victims are less likely to carry weapons than perpetrators , and if both the victims and perpetrators carry weapons the injuries will be generally be greater than if they were unarmed . 
  about one per year . 
  routine check-ups are free for people under 21 and the rest gets state tooth care benefits . 
  i think it 's especially prevalent in the nordic countries as we have high excise tax on hard liquor . 
  the concern is that it can cause serious damage , and criminals would also be able to carry pepper spray . 
  you can buy self-defence spray with a similar but weaker effect . 
  we also love moonshine ( hembr\u00e4nt ) , especially in northern sweden . 
  it 's still illegal , but not heavily enforced if it 's for personal use . 
  it 's still illegal . 
  you can have hunting weapons if you have a hunting licence , but bear spray is still illegal and carrying firearms for general bear protection is also illegal . 
  safety . 
  home distilling is illegal in most countries . 
  you can still make beer/wine etc but not hard liquor . 
  even `` realistic '' depictions of child porn is illegal . 
  there was a high profile case about that a few years ago where a manga translator possessing `` lolicon '' was acquitted . 
  * guns/pepper spray/mace for protection * childporn * certain firecrackers * home distilling equipment * drugs * radio jammers * laser pointers  5 mw,

  yes !, 
  one of my favourite shows . 
  it 's original , clever , hilarious and a surprisingly intelligent nihilist/existentialist social commentary . 
   the most problematic part was actually finland for me . 
  they share so much both with scandinavia and the baltics -- similar history as the baltics , not directly part of the `` west '' due to finlandization , but also very closely tied to sweden and being part of the west economically i consider finland distinctly nordic and they do n't share much with the baltics . 
  estonia has some nordic connection but the other baltic countries does not . 
  i would also say that scandinavia ( sweden , denmark and norway ) are distinct from the rest of the nordic .
