   the arson attack had financial support from andreas lindblom , manager of skansen , and paul wretlind , chairman of the stockholm section of the liberal people 's party . 
  the siege of the west german embassy in 1975 by the red army faction , aka the baader-meinhof group . 
  ** 4 people were killed , 2 embassy personnel and 2 perpetrators , an additional 14 people were injured . 
  again , i quote [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/west_german_embassy_siege ) :  the group consisted of six members : karl-heinz dellwo , siegfried hausner , hanna-elise krabbe , bernhard r\u00f6ssner , lutz taufer and ulrich wessel . 
  they entered the embassy , took thirteen embassy officials , including ambassador dietrich stoecher , hostage ( or twelve officials , according to some sources ) , and then proceeded to occupy the upper floors of the building . 
    they warned swedish police to back off or some hostages would be killed , but the police did not comply and one of the hostages , baron von mirbach , a german military attach\u00e9 was marched out on to the landing and shot to death . 
    the group was then told that chancellor helmut schmidt was not prepared to negotiate with them ; in response , economic attach\u00e9 hillegaart was made to stand at a window and was then shot three times . 
  with the murder of hillegaart , the attackers announced that they would execute one hostage every hour until their demands were met . 
    swedish police prepared to storm the building , but before they had the chance to , the embassy was rocked by a series of violent explosions ; the tnt had been detonated . 
  ulrich wessel dropped a grenade , which detonated and killed him . 
  the remaining hostages , as well as the raf terrorists , all suffered severe burns . 
  siegfried hausner was flown back to west germany , where he soon died of his wounds in prison . 
    the explosion of the embassy was caught on tape . 
  swedish news reporter bo holmstr\u00f6m was standing outside the embassy ready to broadcast when the explosions took off . 
  after taking cover holmstr\u00f6m started yelling `` l\u00e4gg ut , l\u00e4gg ut ! '', 
  ( `` start broadcast , start broadcast ! '' ), 
  to make sure that he was on the air . 
  when he knew he was live he began to report from the events . 
  some of the early modern cultural ideas and movements are uniquely european . 
  romanticism , humanism , neoclassicism , impressionism , expressionism etc. 
  mainly by treating arabs/muslims as human beings and advocating for their rights . 
  other than that , probably a lot of semi illegal radio surveillance .

  1 hockey is worth approximately 1 internet . 
  no comment . 
  one of the neighbouring nordic countries , but i 'm not going to admit that in public . 
  well , at least you still speak english , have humane laws , snow in the winter and hockey . 
  in stockholm ( depending on where you live ) it 's 239 sek ( ~ 36 cad ) for 100/10 , modem included , no lock-in period , no datacap . 
  you can probably get even better prices with campaign offers . 
  that ca n't be serious . 
  150/15 with a 1 tb/mo download cap for $ 79.90 / mo ? 
  is it really * that * bad ? 
  there are many twitch streamers who operate from canada . 
  while it 's not as good as sweden it seems to be comparable with european internet speeds . 
  requirements : 1 . 
  english as the main language . 
  relatively high standard of living . 
  seasons ( winters with snow ) . 
  good internet infra structure . 
  i want streaming services available , good download speeds and not have 200 + ping in my online games . 
  humane laws and politics . 
  looks like it 's canada .

  sweden is either hot blonde girls or vikings . 
  all guys are named sven and the girls are named inga . 
  no one in hollywood has done an even remotely passable swedish accent . 
  they do it like a weird singing german accent with high pitched emphasis on random syllables . 
  some of my favourite shows of the top of my head : firefly , the wire , black mirror , faulty towers , stranger things , breaking bad . 
  mouse ( in swedish : `` mus '' ) . 
  btw , can estonians and finns understand each other ? 
  only children shows for those who ca n't read subtitles are dubbed in sweden . 
  there are some dubs of children 's movies to the official minority languages sami , me\u00e4nkieli and romani [ under way ] ( http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2327&amp;artikel=6453459 ) . 
  maybe with a filthy mind and some will and determination . 
  g\u00f6k ( cuckoo ) could maybe be said to be a synonym for `` a fuck '' , but it 's more common as a verb : att g\u00f6ka - to fuck . 
  other than that , snipa ( snipe ) sort of looks like the word snippa ( pussy ) , and bredstj\u00e4rtad labb ( pomarine skua ) could be translated to `` wide-arsed skua '' . 
  edit : i forgot the best one : knulla , the standard word for fuck , is an old word for the dove 's coo . 
  let 's go bro , / r/nordicunion . 
  we still reserve the right to make fun of you though . 
  the english language , unlike swedish , lacks the even more important distinction between * europa * the continent and * europe * the rock band who made `` the final countdown ( dudu-rut-ut-uuuu ) '' . 
  sweden has a long history of international diplomats , e.g. 
  folke bernadotte , raoul wallenberg , hans blix ; but the most famous one is probably dag hammarskj\u00f6ld . 
  son of prime minister hjalmar hammarskj\u00f6ld , member of the swedish academy , un secretary-general , nobel peace prize recipient . 
  most famous for his actions as the un secretary-general in the early cold war , e.g. 
  his intervention in the 1956 suez crisis , his efforts in defusing the congo crisis , his efforts to smooth relations between israel and the arab states , his conferences in geneva for nuclear disarmament and his negations with china to release the 11 captured us korean war pilots . 
  not in stockholm that i know of , unless you count norse gods . 
  we had a big naming revision of street name in 1885 where streets were given consistent names after certain themes . 
  the stipulations allow for streets to be named after people with nordic descent or naturalized foreigners , but i ca n't come to think of any . 
  some more info on swedish wikipedia : * https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/gatunamn_i_stockholm * https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/namnrevisionen_i_stockholm_1885 * https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/stockholms_namnberedning, 
  it 's very common with streets named after swedish personalities , least in stockholm . 
  as soon an important enough person dies they make room for a street/park/square / place to be named after them in inner stockholm . 
  part of * tunnelgatan * became * olof palmes gata * , part of * vasaparken * became * astrid lindgrens terrass * and * vintertullsparken * became * anna lindhs park * .

  eurosport is still less popular than viasat who owns the rights for champions league , premier league , la liga , serie a and ligue 1 , or c more who owns the rights for allsvenskan , shl and nhl . 
  same for sweden . 
  i humbly apologize for calling you the wrong kind of retard . 
  ** denmark ** , swedens retarded little brother who we keep in the basement . 
  the entire country has a chronic speech impediment , it sounds like they have their mouth full of hot marbles and they just came out of the dentist having their wisdom teeth removed . 
  ** norway ** , they used to be civilized when they were under our rule , but now the country has gone to shit . 
  they live in mountain huts and live of fish , oil and pine cones . 
  it 's sad really . 
  also , their damn cross country skiers are all on doping . 
  ** finland ** , they also used to be civilized when they were under our rule , but fucking denmark-norway betrayed us and fought with russia to let them take finland from us . 
  they 've since gained independence , but they 've become raging knife-fighting alcoholics due to russian influence . 
  love them though < 3, 
  please also provide an english translation and how to interpret them if necessary . 
  in sweden we have a regional rivalry of coffee brands , where we are more prone to buy from the coffee company closest to us .
