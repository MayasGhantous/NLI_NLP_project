  we do n't have that many pure hardware stores in sweden , hardware is mostly sold by stores with a main focus somewhere else . 
  * byggmax , beijer and others sell building supplies and hardware . 
  * biltema sells car stuff and hardware . 
  * clas ohlson sells hardware and a bunch of everything including electronics , multimedia and leisure products . 
  * jula , rusta etc sells home improvement stuff and gardening stuff , but also hardware . 
  wedding cake . 
  indeed , but the cabs driving from the air port are usually of lesser quality . 
  no country has a completely laissez-faire free market , as they should n't . 
  i 'll be honest , i 'm dead against it . 
  i mean , people forget that traders need access to dixons . 
  they do say it 'll help people in wheelchairs . 
  besides the already mentioned bamse . 
  one should check out : * [ arne anka ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arne_anka ) ( [ example ] ( http://2static.fjcdn.com/pictures/arne_c070a9_5712015.jpg ) , [ example 2 ] ( http://2static.fjcdn.com/large/pictures/e3/94/e39467_5712015.jpg ) ) * [ rocky ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rocky_\\ ( comic_strip \\ ) ) ( [ examples ] ( http://www.comicsreporter.com/index.php/resources/interviews/3434/ ) ) both are funny and somewhat cynical short strips about urban life . 
  i near there are lots of trouble in those neighborhoods , especially around b-ball courts . 
  you should try living in bel-air instead if you have any relatives over there . 
  best country for raising children . 
  the longest paid paternity and maternity leave in the world , generous child benefits and good childcare .

  best primary schools . 
  also good for children in general .

  it 's common now during the summer months . 
  but i think hipsters/shorties are overall more popular . 
  g-string is more common than thongs in sweden . 
  there are three characters in bamse who can eat dunderhonung ( thunder-honey ) and get strong without getting a tummy ache : 1 . 
  [ bamse ] ( http://www.bamse.se/wp-content/uploads/bamse.jpg ) 2 . 
  [ gluff-gluff ] ( http://m.babyworld.se/images/2.31271/karnan-bamse-och-gluff-gluff.jpeg ) , the troll . 
  [ surre ] ( http://www.bamse.se/wp-content/uploads/surre.jpg ) , the bee . 
  special rules apply for bamse 's daughters : * [ brumma ] ( http://www.bamse.se/wp-content/uploads/brumma-song-510x382.jpg ) , bamse 's youngest daughter . 
  she neither gets strong nor gets a tummy ache . 
  * [ nalle-maja ] ( http://www.bamse.se/wp-content/uploads/nalle_maja.jpg ) , bamse 's eldest daughter . 
  she gets strong and gets a tummy ache . 
  all other characters do n't get strong but they get a tummy ache for three days . 
  i 'm seriously triggered . 
  i can play the main riff of nirvanas `` come as you are '' on guitar by plucking the top string and adjusting its tuning peg . 
  also split an apple in half with my hands ( strength not required ) . 
  [ harry brandelius - amerikabrevet ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5i264rmkn8g ) it 's like one of those jpop songs with some english words sprinkled in for flavour . 
  joina reddits discord-chatt ffs noob . 
  just adding that sweden , finland and the baltic countries will not experience a net rise in sea level ( at least not in the next couple of thousand years ) as [ post-glacial rebound ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/post-glacial_rebound ) will offset the rise in sea level . 
  [ bamse ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bamse ) - the world 's strongest bear , and also the kindest . 
  [ arne anka ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arne_anka ) - a cynical duck . 
  [ lisbeth salander ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lisbeth_salander ) - from the millennium series ( the girl with the dragon tattoo etc. ), 
  carl bildt singing ( before he was pm 1991 -- 1994 ) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc0_cpiqcdu, 
  per month in sweden . 
  i guess you could say `` urban middle-class '' instead of stockholmare , but i feel slightly uneasy identifying as a class ( or race ) . 
  they are terms from a past era . 
  i consider myself fairly representative because i mainly try to give representative answers but i also do n't have any extreme political opinions and i generally share the swedish v\u00e4rdegrund . 
  similarly , the swedish * f\u00f6r f\u00e4derneslandet !, 
  * ( for the fatherland ) got a negative connotation since the swedish extreme right and neo nazis started using it . 
  possibly inspired by the best selling album with the same name by the viking rock band [ ultima thule ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ultima_thule_\\ ( swedish_band \\ ) ) . 
  i know , i [ mentioned the hakkapeliitta ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/6ifmef/what_is_your_countrys_battle_call_or_national/dj5u5te/ ) in my post in this thread . 
  i did n't mean to steal your thunder , it 's just so rarely finns comments in these threads , 
  rammstein commented on the similarities :  the chorus sounds suspiciously similar to that of swedish band the sounds ' hit `` living in america '' , and i bring it up . 
  christoph looks at me with a surprised look on his face . 
    -- really , i do n't know the song !, 
    richard , who is on his way to the bathroom , laughs . 
    -- to me it sounds more like the beatles . 
    he starts to sing `` we all living in a yellow submarine '' . 
   christoph investigates further , so i sing the swedish song for him . 
  `` we 're not living in america ... '' . 
    -- really ? 
  it 's almost the same line !, 
    i realize this was probably not a conscious move from them . 
  sometimes this happens ... and they will think we have copied them . 
  there 's so much music out now , that you 're bound to make something that has been done before , i guess . 
  i assume it 's similar to the swedish * hacka p\u00e5 !, 
  * , which i would translate to hack on !, 
  or hack away !, 
  the term `` welfare '' should not be seen as a synonym for social security benefits , but as the more literal meaning that all citizens should `` fare well '' , i.e. 
  where their well-being is assured . 
  the country where we have been raised and fostered . 
  edit : perhaps `` fostering country '' would be a better translation . 
  - for king and foster country !, 
  g\u00e5 p\u00e5 !, 
  hurra !, 
  - for the fatherland !, 
  charge !, 
  hooray !, 
  ( call for a bayonet charge ) . 
  - cut them down ( son of the north ) !, 
  used by the [ hakkapeliitta ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hakkapeliitta ) , finnish cavalrymen fighting for the swedish king gustavus adolphus . 
  on the internet : v\u00c4lf\u00c4rd - welfare danskj\u00c4vlar - danish devils, 
  we have scores of national romantic songs from the 1800s , mostly as alls\u00e5ng ( sing-along songs ) or for mens choir . 
  based on a folk melody , [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq_x-3xcguy ) and [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxppmyyjl-g ) are some more traditional representations . 
  i ca n't think of any songs praising other countries , but we have some songs shitting on other countries , mostly the usa . 
  the first thing that comes to mind : [ the sounds - living in america ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajy4wj_-zec ), 
  positive experiences with older turks that run kiosks and pizza-places in sweden . 
  more negative , but a lot fewer , experiences with younger turks . 
  it could be longer summers and longer winters , but i 'm content overall . 
  we mentioned the new sweden american colony in delaware valley in passing , but i only recently learned that we had other colonies . 
   the former swedish colonies in africa were :   * swedish gold coast ( 1650 -- 1663 ; lost to denmark and the dutch ) including the cape coast ( 1649 -- 1663 ) consisting of the following settlements :   * fort apollonia , presently beyin : 1655-1657 . 
   * fort christiansborg/fort frederiksborg , which became the capital , presently osu : 1652-1658  * fort batenstein , presently butri : 1649-1656 . 
   * fort witsen , presently takoradi : 1653-1658 . 
   * carolusborg : april 1650 - january/february 1658 , 10 december 1660 - 22 april 1663   the former swedish colonies in america :   * guadeloupe ( 1813 -- 1814 ; returned to france )  * saint-barth\u00e9lemy ( 1784 -- 1878 ; sold to france )  * new sweden ( 1638 -- 1655 ; lost to the dutch )  * tobago ( 1733 ; attempted settlement thwarted by natives ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_overseas_colonies, 
  i would n't say i approve of it , but i was really fascinated by the baltimore gang culture as portrayed in the wire . 
  i 'd say i 'm fairly representative of a male swede living in stockholm and i try to research and provide sources for my answers about sweden in general . 
  but one should note that the political climate of sweden is a bit polarized at the moment . 
  french historical battles : 119 victories , 60 defeats , 13 draws . 
  we have it sometimes , mostly after natural disasters , terror attacks and deaths of politicians . 
  a few examples from the swedish wikipedia : * 1931 - [ \u00c5dalen shootings ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%85dalen_shootings ) * 1986 - murder of prime minister olof palme * 1994 - the sinking of ms estonia * 2001 - 11 september attacks * 2004 - murder of foreign minister anna lindh * 2004 - madrid train bombings * 2004 - indian ocean tsunami * 2005 - london bombings * 2011 - breivik norway attack * 2015 - [ trollh\u00e4ttan school attack ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trollh%c3%a4ttan_school_attack ) * 2015 - paris attacks * 2017 - stockholm terror attack,
