  which is popular where and why ? 
  the reason sweden produces weapons in the first place is that due to our long standing policy of [ neutrality ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_neutrality ) . 
  we should be self sufficient and not dependent on foreign arms deals . 
  i doubt you could own an ak47 or any other fully automatic rifle in any eu country . 
  misguided and have probably caused more acts of terrorism than it has prevented . 
  maybe [ airbus defence and space ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/airbus_defence_and_space ) , if there even is one . 
  defensive wars are almost always justified . 
  offensive wars can be justified in some cases , but they are hard to carry out in practice . 
  in theory , overthrowing an oppressive dictatorship and installing a democracy is justified . 
  but that has been the casus belli of many wars which has not been just . 
  one of the other nordic countries . 
  the general trend seems to be that the support for a monarchy is declining though , at least since 1995 . http://som.gu.se/digitalassets/1375/1375047_161-182-lennart-nilsson--monarkin.pdf, 
  probably is zlatan ibrahimovic . 
  other footballers are lennart `` nacka '' skoglund , torbj\u00f6rn nilsson , henrik larsson and the gre-no-li trio gunnar gren , gunnar nordahl and nils liedholm . 
  maizena enjoys the same status in sweden too . 
  other must have brands are : * o'boy chocolate powder milk * kalles sandwich caviar * fr\u00f6dinge swedish cheesecake ( not to be confused with non-swedish cheesecake ) * ekstr\u00f6ms blueberry soup some brands that dominate a certain market , but alternatives are acceptable : * keso cottage cheese . 
  * blossa gl\u00f6gg ( mulled wine ) * abba pickled herring * suketter sackarin sweetener * klorin bleach * t-r\u00f6d denatured ethanol * svinto steel wool * wettex dish cloth brands that are considered generic names : * bostongurka pickled gherkins * hush\u00e5llsassistent food processor * topz cotton swabs ( q-tips ) * glad pack plastic wrap edit : added some . 
  it 's seen as boring , thankless and underpaid work . 
  about the same in sweden as in norway , 65 % in favour of monarchy as of mars 2016 . 
  but that 's a big decline from 2005 when it was 80 % in favour . 
  in principle , i think a hereditary monarchy is undemocratic , but on the other hand it 's part of our national identity and i think it 's pretty neat to have walking , talking national symbols . 
  a good compromise would be to go back to having an elective monarchy . 
   is there any country in the european migration area that guarantees a decent standard of living for all citizens who are able to find work there ? 
  sweden and probably the other nordic countries too . 
  you are guaranteed a certain amount ( about $ 400 ) after having paid rent/medical expenses whether you have a job or not . 
  you are required to be actively trying to improve your situation though ( such as studying , looking for a job or participating in active labour market policies ) . 
  it was n't technically # 1 though . 
  at the time it was popular , the charts started at # 2 : http://www.hadleyandmaxwell.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/07_god-save_the_queen-1977.jpg, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/objectivism_ ( ayn_rand ), 
  it 's more than that , at least in sweden and the original novel . 
  if we change the we/us with i/me and it 's clear that it 's narcissism applied to a village/homogeneous group rather than an individual : 1 . 
  you 're not to think you are anything special . 
  you 're not to think you are as good as i am . 
  you 're not to think you are smarter than i am . 
  you 're not to imagine yourself better than i am . 
  you 're not to think you know more than i do . 
  you 're not to think you are more important than i am . 
  you 're not to think you are good at anything . 
  you 're not to laugh at me . 
  you 're not to think anyone cares about you . 
  you 're not to think you can teach me anything . 
  i 'm currently watching penny dreadful and i could have sworn she was british . 
  edit : her surname `` green '' is apparently swedish . 
  `` gren '' [ gre : n ] means branch . 
  the law of jante would apply very much to the mindset of trump if you changed all the we/us with i/me . 
  narcissism , isolationism and the inability to take critique . 
  [ the law of jante ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/law_of_jante ) . 
  not as prevalent as it was before thank god . 
  a good comparison tool is the economists big mac index : http://www.economist.com/content/big-mac-index, 
  i do n't know what people realize , but here are some swedish actors and actresses : * [ stellan skarsg\u00e5rd ] ( http://media.hollywood.com/images/699x1000/7400102.jpg ) ( good will hunting , pirates of the caribbean ) * [ alexander skarsg\u00e5rd ] ( http://cdn01.cdn.justjared.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/skarsgard-prem/alexander-skarsgard-battleship-premiere-with-liam-neeson-08.jpg ) ( true blood , generation kill , tarzan ) * [ peter stormare ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/9f/9d/94/9f9d9454a24922921d3bfcfd30c0ab39.jpg ) ( fargo , the big lebowski , constantine ) * [ joel kinnaman ] ( http://bitterblondin.se/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/joel-kinnaman-2012.jpg ) ( the killing , suicide squad , robocop ) * [ michael nyqvist ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/michael_nyqvist_2013.jpg ) ( john wick , millennium series ) * [ noomi rapace ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/cd/c3/2d/cdc32d32c7269d3c1e4eb1e0bdc3a3b2.jpg ) ( prometheus , alien covenant ) * [ alicia vikander ] ( http://www.filmbransch.se/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/alicia-vikander.jpg ) ( ex machina , the danish girl ) i guess many people know that dolph lundgren , ingrid bergman and greta garbo are swedish . 
  the first four is named after ytterby itself ( ** ytt ** rium , ** ytterb ** ium , ** terb ** ium , ** erb ** ium ) . 
  when they ran out of permutations of the word ytterby , they named it first after the nearby city stockholm ( ** holm ** ium ) , then after scandinavia ( ** skand ** ium ) , then after the nordics ( ** thul ** ium , after thule , ancient greek for nordics ) .

  postnord is the worst thing that came out of denmark since christian the tyrant . 
  for real though , how is postnord viewed in denmark ? 
  actually , it 's the 5.7 million danes that keep us out . 
  must ... resist ... denmark-joke ... 
  kul is according to the [ swedish academy 's dictionary ] ( http://www.saob.se/artikel/?unik=k_2877-0425.5z0v&amp;pz=5 ) possibly a shortening of the expression `` kulan i luften '' ( `` the bullet in the air '' ) which means/meant ideal or something great . 
  there seems to be a semantic shift where rolig went from : calm  relaxing  pleasant  enjoyable  amusing  funny . 
  some `` fun '' facts : another swedish word for funny - lustig - originally meant lustful/inclined to do something . 
  olustig means unpleasant or even ominous rather than unfunny . 
  and a third swedish word for funny - kul - originally meant very good . 
  kinky and kinkig both seem to stem from kink , a knot-like contraction or short twist in a rope . 
  swedish : [ kinkig ] ( http://www.saob.se/artikel/?unik=k_0873-0245.o4lb&amp;pz=5 ) ( adj ) corresponding to [ kinka ] ( http://www.saob.se/artikel/?unik=k_0873-0239.fvi7&amp;pz=5 ) ( v ) from [ kink ] ( http://www.saob.se/artikel/?unik=k_0873-0234.c4g4&amp;pz=5 ) ( n ) . 
  english : [ kinky ] ( http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=kinky&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 ) ( adj ) from [ kink ] ( http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=kink&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 ) ( n ) . 
  after some googling , i 've determined that he is called markus s\u00f6der , bavarian state minister for finance . 
  presumably he is not very popular in the rest of germany ? 
  * detektiv means private investigator ( not police detective ) . 
  * vrist means ancle ( not wrist ) . 
  * fabrik means factory ( not fabric ) . 
  * hammock means porch swing ( not hammock ) . 
  * kinkig means grumpy ( not kinky ) . 
  rolig in swedish means funny , but in danish it means calm . 
  why ? 
  early grey or the swedish [ s\u00f6der blend ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/s%c3%b6der_tea ) . 
  jordan will always have a place in my hart because of space jam , but i heard he 's kind of a dick irl . 
  lebanon is of course a great player , but currently i think stephen curry might be better . 
  no-one said texas ? 
  it 's the one with the cleanest features imho . 
  it 's a good one . 
  it 's called `` hall\u00e5 d\u00e4r bonde '' . 
  the video is unavailable . 
  i do n't know that song in particular , but i would n't call the other songs i 've heard from them political . 
  we have `` af '' and the occasional `` von '' . 
  we 've had two big musical movements of leftist music in sweden . 
  first came [ progg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/progg ) in the 60-70 's ( e.g. 
  [ nationalteatern - barn av v\u00e5r tid ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bomqq-dmxcu ) ) . 
  and after that came a wave of leftist punk music in the 70-80 's ( e.g. 
  [ ebba gr\u00f6n - staten och kapitalet ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ya6z54ihdu0 ) ) . 
  i never heard any right wing music that was n't like ultra-right extremist music . 
  does that even exist ? 
  mostly eurodance . 
  limiting myself to swedish groups , but the classic eurodance hits like `` what is love '' etc was of course also popular : * [ basic element - the ride ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwy8fxoivko ) * [ dr. alban - it 's my life ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zhm_6aq7cy ) * [ e-type - this is the way ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w1hedqycu4 ) * [ la cream - free ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ba2p09yghic ) * [ leila k - electric ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jl_5nhtvdai ) * [ melodie mc - dum da dum ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqpl2nnwhn4 ) * [ pandora - trust me ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwnbrqe0a7q ), 
  i did n't read those one in particular ( but i saw a few episodes of the tv-series ) . 
  i read a bunch of other stuff by astrid lindgren though . 
  my favorite was ( still is ) the brothers lionheart . 
  that 's true . 
  however , many feature films are made in trollh\u00e4ttan aka [ trollywood ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trollywood ) where housing should not be a problem .
