  it 's also close to swedens second largest city gothenburg . 
  sweden !, 
  featuring : * [ very high english proficiency ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ef_english_proficiency_index ) . 
  * a relatively large [ film industry ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cinema_of_sweden ) with a long tradition . 
  * strong support for gender equality . 
  we ( somewhat dubiously ) claim to have the [ first feminist government ] ( http://www.government.se/government-policy/a-feminist-government/ ) . 
  yep . 
  with lyrics almost equal in stupidity . 
  the song competed in the swedish selection for the eurovision song contest and is apparently about his old crush on jonna bergh , an entertainment journalist who was the host of a bunch of shows on the old ztv tv-channel . 
  not the biggest , but a funny one . 
  the town of avesta wanted to get a bridge , and in an effort to be frugal , they found and bought a bridge second hand on sweden 's equivalent of craigslist ( blocket ) from stockholm . 
  however the bridge turned out to be 10 meters too short and they had to spend 8 times what they paid for the bridge and more than 20 times what the city council originally had approved to be spent on the bridge . 
  [ martin svensson - fishes that whisper \\ ( fiskar som viskar \\ ) . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wdngco3snk ) some inane similes :  we are like fishes , fishes who whisper . 
    we are like birds , birds who question . 
    we are like flowers , flowers which blossom . 
    we are like swans , swans who speak . 
    we are like eals , eals who howl . 
  and the most dull-witted chorus imaginable :  what should we do ? 
    why should we think ? 
    we just need to sing : `` la lala lala lala '' . 
  this was a popular radio hit in 1999 . 
  we do n't know what kind of porn he was into , but that statement is otherwise correct .

  edit : from the interrogation transcript ( google translated because i 'm lazy ) :  io1 : i think i learn more when i 'm talking to people , actually . 
    vm : yes , but you actually do . 
  you 're right about that . 
    io1 : talk about it , what happened to your finger ? 
    vm : my finger ? 
    io1 : yes . 
    vm : no , i 'll hit it with an ax . 
    io1 : why did you do that ? 
  why ? 
  ( laughs , fl 's note )   io1 : yes . 
    vm : yes , it was , oh , there are . 
  yes , you sure are my ax now . 
  and the blood on the toolbar . 
  but ...   io1 : was it a mistake or was it aware ? 
  that was my question really . 
    vm : yes , it 's just as good to be honest . 
  it was actually aware then . 
    io1 : mm . 
  do you want to share the reason for that ? 
    vm : yes , it was that i had , i had an addiction . 
  and then i promised that if i fall back into it i would cut off one of my fingers . 
  or one of my fingers . 
  and i did it for a while now and then , yes , then , i stopped doing it again and then i completed it so to show that i will never fall back in it . 
    io1 : you are very hard against yourself . 
    vm : yes . 
  but that 's good , because then i can remind myself that i will not fall back into it . 
  then , but you 're the first to say that to you . 
  because , yes , maybe it sounds a bit sick in someone else 's eyes , or then i said it was an accident . 
  but if you do not think it 's related to what i 'm suspect for , i think it 's just as good to be honest . 
    io1 : it 's good that you 're honest but i still think you 're very hard against yourself . 
    vm : yes . 
  well , yes , yes , anyway . 
  i felt tormented for a while now and then i felt that when i got a relapse , i felt that i promised myself that way , and then i felt that it would be the nail in the coffin after that . 
  once for all . 
    io1 : mm . 
  i understand the idea though . 
    vm : yes , yes . 
  but it might be good to be hard on yourself too . 
    io1 : to a certain limit maybe . 
    io2 : but you 've got a finger left anyway . 
    vm : yes ( irreplaceable 21:04 ) . 
  that will be enough . 
  i can handle it without it . 
    io1 : it 's quite recent or . 
    vm : yes , it was this weekend . 
    io2 : what was addiction ? 
    io1 : online then or ? 
    vm : mm . 
  just . 
    io1 : it 's a dependency just like everyone else . 
    vm : yes , yes , sir . 
  that 's it . 
    io1 : but you can get help with that too . 
    vm : yes , yes . 
  but i 've done myself . 
  i managed to finish it a while . 
  so i can do it again . 
    io1 : extremely easy to fall back in view of being exposed to the internet only . 
    vm : yes , yes , i know . 
  that 's what i did . 
  but just know that you are addicted . 
  you should not be exposed to it . 
    vm : again . 
    io1 : i hope you can handle it . 
    vm : yes , i will do that . 
   vm is viktor melin , member of the nordic resistance movement , suspected ( along with two others ) of bombing a refugee accommodation and a syndicalist facility in gothenburg . 
  io1 and io2 are the interrogating officers of the swedish security service . 
  it tool me quite a while to realize that there even existed `` normal '' religious people in my own age . 
  i thought only immigrants from far away countries , old people and weirdos were actually religious . 
  i 'd say religious people are mostly viewed with curiosity . 
  are you religious ? 
  really ? 
  tell me more . 
  `` skadegl\u00e4dje \u00e4r den enda sanna gl\u00e4djen '' which translates to `` malicious joy is the only true joy '' . 
  `` skadegl\u00e4dje '' literally means `` schadenfreude '' , or `` harm joy '' in english .
