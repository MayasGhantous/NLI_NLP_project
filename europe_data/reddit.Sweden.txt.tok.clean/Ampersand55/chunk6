  * * the freedom of the press act * protects the freedom of printed press . 
  * * fundamental law on freedom of expression * extends protections similar to those of the * freedom of the press act * to other media . 
  #### limitations of free speech and freedom of expression : 1 ) depictions and descriptions of certain `` protected objects '' ( such as military facilities etc. ), 
  are prohibited when in the interest of national security . 
  2 ) internet sites containing child pornography are dns blocked by the police . 
  3 ) child pornography is illegal , even realistic artist depictions . 
  4 ) defamation is illegal . 
  from the swedish penal code :  a person who points out someone as being a criminal or as having a  reprehensible way of living or otherwise furnishes information  intended to cause exposure to the disrespect of others , shall be  sentenced for  defamation  to a fine . 
    if he was duty-bound to express himself or if , considering the  circumstances , the furnishing of information on the matter was  defensible , or if he can show that the information was true or that he  had reasonable grounds for it , no punishment shall be imposed . 
  gross insults are the subject of the same law :  a person who vilifies another by an insulting epithet or accusation or by other infamous conduct towards him , shall be sentenced , if the act is not punishable under section 1 or 2 , for insulting behaviour to a fine .

  ( law 1988:835 ) it takes a lot to be convicted , pastor \u00c5ke green was acquitted by the supreme court :  at his church in borgholm , green delivered a sermon in which he described `` sexual perversions '' ( referencing homosexuality ) as `` abnormal , a horrible cancerous tumor in the body of society . '', 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%85ke_green #### limitations of free speech that sweden does n't have : 1 ) unlike in many countries , courts does not have the right to issue gag orders to infringe on the freedom of expression . 
  2 ) films and other media are n't subject to censorship either . 
   the battle of k\u00f8ge bay . 
  it could be a great action movie , about the underdog fleet winning , against all odds . 
  we did n't take that battle seriously . 
  also we had new shoes on and their centre of gravity was off , also we had n't got much sleep the night before and the sun was in our eye at crucial times . 
  christian ii 's conquering of stockholm and the [ stockholm bloodbath ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stockholm_bloodbath ) and the following [ swedish war of liberation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_war_of_liberation ) . 
  could be made either as a classic revenge flick by quentin tarantino ( starring tom hardy as gustav vasa ) or as a game of thrones style fantasy epic . 
  i stand corrected and i applaud your research . 
  i think they are uncommon . 
  i 've only encountered one family that had one . 
  fondue sets with oil are ( or was in the 70s-80s ) rather popular in sweden though , and they can sort of be classified as deep fryers . 
  hey , ice frog !, 
  ( the lead developer of the dota and dota 2 computer games ) . 
  i just took that from the wiki-article . 
   at the very most , the donald duck party has scored enough write-in votes at points theoretically to be the country 's ninth-most popular ( in 1991 , it received 1,535 votes ) . 
  it seems plausible that they were the 9th or possibly even the 8th largest party in the 1988 national election though as there were only 7 main parties then . 
  or in 1985 when there were only 6 main parties . 
  according to [ this news article ] ( http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/valet2010/article12513703.ab ) the donald duck party got more than 1 618 votes in 1988 . 
  4.5-5 years studying + 3 years internship + mandatory training courses and passing the swedish bar examination . 
  so at the minimum 7.5 years , but likely longer . 
   under swedish law , only members of the swedish bar association may use the professional title `` advokat '' . 
   among the requirements for membership are :   1 . 
  domicile in sweden or another country within the european union , the european economic area , or switzerland ,  2 . 
  passed proficiency examination required for competency to a judge 's office -- i.e. 
  in sweden , a jur . 
  degree ,  3 . 
  minimum three years ' experience of practising law offering legal services to the public at the time of application ,  4 . 
  passed the swedish bar examination after completing the mandatory training courses ,  5 . 
  reputation for integrity , and also otherwise considered suitable for the legal profession . 
  https://www.advokatsamfundet.se/advokatsamfundet-engelska/membership-and-registration/ swedish universities does n't issue the jur . 
  degree anymore , it 's been replaced by the roughly equivalent degree of master of laws which also takes 4.5-5 ( at least 9 semesters ) years to complete studying at the normal pace . 
  in 1991 , the ninth most popular party in sweden 's national election was the [ donald duck party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/donald_duck_party ) , despite not officially existing . 
  denmark really did n't have a choice . 
  they were given an ultimatum : surrender or get bombed back to the stone age . 
  the whole of denmark was in range of german bombers and they did n't have the opportunity to mount a defence . 
   at 04:00 on 9 april 1940 , the german ambassador to denmark -- cecil von renthe-fink -- called the danish foreign minister peter munch and requested a meeting with him . 
  when the two men met 20 minutes later , renthe-fink declared that german troops were at that moment moving in to occupy denmark to protect the country from franco-british attack . 
  the german ambassador demanded that danish resistance cease immediately and contact be made between danish authorities and the german armed forces . 
  if the demands were not met , the luftwaffe would bomb the capital , copenhagen . 
   as the german demands were communicated , the first german advances had already been made , with forces landing by ferry in gedser at 03:55 and moving north . 
  relatively common compared to other countries . 
  ethnicity does n't really factor in that much in what i consider attractive . 
  afaik , they are mostly in gang vs gang crime . 
  they are also used in protection rackets/extortions where they attack the restaurants/shops/clubs that does n't pay up . 
  most fall into either one of these categories : 1 ) mc gangs , 2 ) gangs from the balkans ( mostly [ serbs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/serb_mafia_in_scandinavia ) , albanians and turks ) and 3 ) eastern-european gangs ( mostly lithuanians and poles ) . 
  the most serious wave of organized crime is grenade attacks , primarily in the malm\u00f6 area in south sweden . 
  m75 grenades from the yugoslav wars smuggled in , possibly by the serbian brotherhood , and sold on the black market for just $ 2 . 
  never say never , but it seems unlikely that it will happen in the foreseeable future . 
  maybe rapadalen valley in sarek national park . 
  * [ summer ] ( http://static.thousandwonders.net/sarek.national.park.original.2531.jpg ) * [ autumn ] ( https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3272/3013011030_d1fd8c37e6_b.jpg ) * [ panorama ] ( https://sites.google.com/site/akestravels/_/rsrc/1218265785100/pictures/panorama-photos/rapadalenpano1x.jpg ) * [ aerial view ] ( https://spotlight.it-notes.ru/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/7090d8f85d84682dc89043bbabf79489.jpg ) * [ sunset ] ( https://wandervisions.com/wp-content/uploads/sunset-sarek-skierfe-top-1200x931.jpg ), 
  malm\u00f6 's hockey team introduced an american style name in the 90s and started calling themselves `` redhawks '' . 
  no roots afaik , just marketing . 
  while we do n't have official marketing friendly names , many teams have unofficial nicknames ( which is the official names of some of their supporter clubs ) . 
  * the swedish national hockey team - tre kronor/three crowns ( offial nickname , thee crowns is a national symbol of sweden ) * aik - gnaget/the gnawing ( unknown origin ) * hammarby - bajen ( possibly from a south stockholm sociolect where - by was pronounced - baj ) . 
  * djurg\u00e5rden if - j\u00e4rnkaminerna / the iron stoves ( from their blue-red jerseys ) * norrk\u00f6ping - peking ( peking/beijing generously translated into swedish is norrk\u00f6ping ) * ifk g\u00f6teborg - \u00c4nglarna / the angels . 
  * gais - makrillarna/the mackerells * bk h\u00e4cken - getingarna/the wasps ( from their yellow-black jerseys ), 
  yeah . 
  i 'm not claiming the song for sweden , i just could n't resist to point out the technicality . 
  til . 
  although technically at the time it was composed , \u00c5land was a part of sweden . 
  consider those a home work assignment . 
  i 'm an earthquake virgin . 
  yea , maybe . 
  my original response was in a thread of traditional songs where everyone knew the lyrics , and the lyrics to byssan lull are easier and more repetitive . 
  sweden had the similar '' [ stams\u00e5nger ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/stams%c3%a5nger ) '' used in music classes up until 1969 . 
  i assume most people above the age of ~ 55-60 knows them . 
  based on an answer from another thread . 
  universally known : * [ vem kan segla f\u00f6rutan vind ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v356cpgtgqm ) * [ byssan lull ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpaozeyf8m4 ) known , but not everyone knows the lyrics : * [ uti v\u00e5r hage ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqtdc1k9trk ) * [ ack v\u00e4rmeland du sk\u00f6na ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxppmyyjl-g ) * [ m\u00e4rk hur v\u00e5r skugga , fredmans epistel no .

  one can argue that the songs by [ evert taube ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/evert_taube ) has semi-folk status by now . 
  the recognition of human rights is what separates us from extremists and terrorists . 
  i feel bad for the uk . 
  he 's likely referring to this thread : [ how do europeans view the democratic and republican parties in the united states ? 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/6faof2/how_do_europeans_view_the_democratic_and/ ), 
  center-left . 
  the [ political compass ] ( https://www.politicalcompass.org/images/usprimaries2016.png ) estimation is imho fairly accurate . 
  it 's not that common , but we also use `` excuse my french '' ( urs\u00e4kta franskan ) . 
  my local group of friends use `` excuse my danish '' ( urs\u00e4kta danskan ) when we throw up or dry-heave . 
  never heard that one , but i 've heard : * eken ( the oak ) * m\u00e4lardrottningen ( the queen in m\u00e4laren ) * fjolltr\u00e4sk ( sissy swamp ) and some names i 've only heard in marketing : * nordens venedig ( the venice of the nordics ) * the capital of scandinavia, 
  it 's part of the [ greater middle east ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greater_middle_east ) . 
  seems like the polish government does not represent it 's people then . 
   in poland , where the ruling law and justice ( pis ) party is in a feud with the eu on a range of issues , two-thirds ( 67 % ) of pis partisans still have a favorable opinion of the brussels institution . 
  i was a bit surprised to see how close and far up every republican candidate was . 
  i think many europeans would agree with that statement . 
  the political compass estimation of the us candidates is imho reasonably accurate : https://www.politicalcompass.org/images/usprimaries2016.png, 
  the only time i can remember stockholm had a black-out was in 2012 . 
  it did n't effect me directly , but i remember because it was on the news .
