  [ news article in english . 
  from douglas adams - so long , and thanks for all the fish :  `` it comes from a very ancient democracy , you see ... ''   `` you mean , it comes from a world of lizards ? '', 
    `` no , '' said ford , who by this time was a little more rational and coherent than he had been , having finally had the coffee forced down him , `` nothing so simple . 
  nothing anything like so straightforward . 
  on its world , the people are people . 
  the leaders are lizards . 
  the people hate the lizards and the lizards rule the people . '', 
    `` odd , '' said arthur , `` i thought you said it was a democracy . '', 
    `` i did , '' said ford . 
  `` it is . '', 
    `` so , '' said arthur , hoping he was n't sounding ridiculously obtuse , `` why do n't people get rid of the lizards ? '', 
    `` it honestly does n't occur to them , '' said ford . 
  `` they 've all got the vote , so they all pretty much assume that the government they 've voted in more or less approximates to the government they want . '', 
    `` you mean they actually vote for the lizards ? '', 
    `` oh yes , '' said ford with a shrug , `` of course . '', 
    `` but , '' said arthur , going for the big one again , `` why ? '', 
    `` because if they did n't vote for a lizard , '' said ford , `` the wrong lizard might get in . 
  got any gin ? '', 
    `` what ? '', 
    `` i said , '' said ford , with an increasing air of urgency creeping into his voice , `` have you got any gin ? '', 
  tell me about the lizards . '', 
    ford shrugged again . 
    `` some people say that the lizards are the best thing that ever happenned to them , '' he said . 
  `` they 're completely wrong of course , completely and utterly wrong , but someone 's got to say it . '', 
    `` but that 's terrible , '' said arthur . 
    `` listen , bud , '' said ford , `` if i had one altairian dollar for every time i heard one bit of the universe look at another bit of the universe and say ` that 's terrible ' i would n't be sitting here like a lemon looking for a gin . '' and that 's how i see the us two-party system .

  you are also much more likely to be killed by a terrorist in the us than in germany . 
  there is more terrorism and crime in eastern europe .

  if it did i would agree , but there is no reason to think that it does . 
  the same was said about violent video games making people violent , but there has been numerous studies showing that there is no correlation . 
  in principle i think victimless crimes should be decriminalized . 
  taste should n't be policed . 
  i agree that climate change deniers should be punished like holocaust deniers , i.e. 
  not at all . 
  ignorance should be met with debate and education , not oppression . 
  i believe in the scientific process , and thus i trust the climate scientist consensus that global warming is the result of human activity . 
  i think people who think they know better than the climate scientists who has spent their lives researching global warming are arrogant and delusional .

  the [ nagorno-karabakh republic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nagorno-karabakh_republic ) might be recognized . 
  the most quotable movie of all time . 
  i 'm ( mildly ) against them . 
  they add much complexity but carry very little meaning . 
  the syllabus for grade 1-3 groups the social sciences ( history , religion , social studies and geography ) with what appears to be general life advice .

  the movie i 've watched the most times is probably the big lebowski . 
  the [ current syllabus ] ( https://www.skolverket.se/laroplaner-amnen-och-kurser/grundskoleutbildning/grundskola/historia ) looks allright . 
  they could add history of science and natural history . 
  yes , thanks for the correction . 
  i 've updated my post . 
  i must have had some temporary delirium . 
  i was even graded with the 1-5 scale . 
  surely most european countries are first world . 
  although technically , sweden is a third-world country as it is/was not aligned with the first-world ( nato ) nor the second-world ( the eastern block + china ) . 
  before 1962 we had the confusing grades a , a , ab , ba , b , bc , c with c being failed . 
  between 1962-1980 ( lgr 62 , lgr 69 ) we had grades from 1-5 which would follow the normal distribution , i.e. 
  classes were expected to have 38 % 3 : s , 24 % 2 : s and 4 : s and 7 % 1 : s and 5 : s. between 1980-1994 ( lgr 80 ) we had grades from 1-5 which were only given in grade 8 and 9 . 
  they were also relative grades with 3 being average , but they did n't strictly have to follow the normal distribution . 
  between 1994-2011 ( lpo 94 ) we had pass ( g ) , pass with distinction ( vg ) and pass with particular distinction ( mvg ) and ig ( not pass/fail ) . 
  after criticism of the unfairness of the relative grading system , the grades were changed to be based on set knowledge requirements rather than to be in relation to other students . 
  since 2011 ( lgr 11 ) we have grades from a to f with f being failed . 
  edit : i mixed up some thing which has now been corrected , see abrovinchs post below . 
  i also reorganized my post and added some more history . 
  how common is it to learn swedish in schools ? 
  is it being taught everywhere in finland or just around the swedish speaking areas ? 
  do you learn finland-swedish or sweden-swedish ? 
  we have a district called [ pungpinan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pungpinan ) which is a common name for denmark . 
  as it happens , the swedish veterans day was yesterday ( may 29 ) . 
  an event primarily dedicated to peacekeeping unef veterans was held at the naval history museum ( sj\u00f6historiska museet ) in stockholm . 
  the king , the prime minister and the commander-in-chief attended the event . 
  what an odd question . 
  i have n't had any reason to mistrust the local government but i 've had no dealings contacting the stockholm municipality myself so i do n't know how well requests are handled . 
  the stockholm municipality has 14 boroughs which have monthly meetings open to the public . 
  you can also submit suggestions to be discussed at the meetings and you are welcome to argue your cause . 
  you can also file complaints , contact politicians/committees directly , leave suggestions and appeal decisions [ directly online ] ( http://www.stockholm.se/omstockholm/politik-och-demokrati/du-kan-paverka/ ) . 
  edit : as for being elected to the city council you need to join a party . 
  the municipal elections are every 4th year , at the same time as the national elections and the county elections . 
  * not too warm * not too high crime rates * it should have seasons * it should be progressive i 'm thinking maybe oregon or massachusetts . 
   now days and i do n't know but i 've heard they start already in grade two . 
  since the lgr 11 syllabus which was implemented in 2011 , we start learning english in lower primary school ( grade 1-3 ) , but it 's up to the school to determine which grade to start at .

   merkel said that we europeans have to take matters in our own hands and that usa ca n't be trusted longer that 's not what she said . 
  freely translated by me , corrections welcome :  the times where we could fully rely on others are long gone , and therefore i can only say : we europeans must really take our fate into our own hands .
