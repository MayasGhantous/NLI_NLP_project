  naturally we do this in friendship with the usa and the uk and with our good neighbours . 
  the us did n't follow the previous [ kyoto protocol ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kyoto_protocol ) either and i had small hopes of them follow this one , especially with trump in charge . 
  i bet if they asked the us public they would be for the agreement , but corporations have to much political power in the us . 
  also : [ ajax-nac breda ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgqsadnseq8 ), 
   to be honest , though , i do n't think that you can score as spectacular a goal as those of zlatan in a video game , even though these games are very realistic these day, 
  too soon . 
  they were late war plans in case the nazis did n't surrender . 
  they would be joint operations with the norwegian/danish resistance who we trained in sweden : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/norwegian_police_troops_in_sweden_during_world_war_ii https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/danish_brigade_in_sweden, 
  he is ( or at least was ) that good . 
  messi and ronaldo might be better , but he 's consistently been in the top 10 and in the mix for 3rd best player . 
  he 's cocky without being arrogant which is why he 's so loved . 
  that and his incredible goals . 
  we had both `` operation save denmark '' and `` operation save norway '' were we were planning to liberate our scandinavian brethren from nazi occupation . 
  some connected events in the early 1520s . 
  christian ii of denmark [ conquers stockholm in 1520 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christian_ii_of_denmark#reconquest_of_sweden ) , where he had around 80 -- 90 people ( mostly nobility and clergy supporting the sture party ) were executed , despite a promise by king christian for general amnesty in what 's called the [ stockholm bloodbath ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stockholm_bloodbath ) . 
  this lead to [ gustav vasa 's rebellion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_war_of_liberation ) 1521 -- 23 where sweden exited the kalmar union and the modern swedish monarchical rule was established as gustav vasa was elected king of sweden . 
  the day of his election is our national day ( 6 june ) . 
  charles xii 's incredible campaigns in the [ great northern war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_northern_war ) where he and his generals defeated armies several times his size dozens of times .

  as many have pointed out , this test is calibrated for the us public . 
  by european standards you seem to have a rather balanced score . 
  ok guys , we are at question 31 and we need to somehow balance the quiz so that not everyone becomes a liberal . 
  i know !, 
  let 's make a leading bullshit question that no one will ever disagree with . 
   31 . it is very important to maintain law and order . 
   i do n't really know what all of these names mean , so if anyone could eli5 that would be appreciated . 
  quoting from the page :  what are the eight values ? 
    there are four independent axes - economic , diplomatic , state , and society - and each has two opposing values assigned to them . 
  they are :   ** equality ** ( economic )  those with higher equality scores believe the economy should distribute value evenly among the populace . 
  they tend to support progressive tax codes , social programs , and at high values , socialism . 
    ** markets ** ( economic )  those with higher market scores believe the economy should be focused on rapid growth . 
  they tend to support lower taxes , privatization , deregulation , and at high values , laissez-faire capitalism . 
    ** nation ** ( diplomatic )  those with higher nation scores are patriotic and nationalist . 
  they often believe in an aggressive foreign policy , valuing the military , strength , sovereignty , and at high values , territorial expansion . 
    ** globe ** ( diplomatic )  those with higher globe scores are cosmopolitan and globalist . 
  they often believe in a peaceful foreign policy , emphasizing diplomacy , cooperation , integration , and at high values , a world government . 
    ** liberty ** ( state )  those with higher liberty scores believe in strong civil liberties . 
  they tend to support democracy and oppose state intervention in personal lives . 
  note that this refers to civil liberties , not economic liberties . 
    ** authority ** ( state )  those with higher authority scores believe in strong state power . 
  they tend to support state intervention in personal lives , government surveillance , and at high values , censorship or autocracy . 
    ** tradition ** ( society )  those with higher tradition scores believe in traditional values and strict adherence to a moral code . 
  though not always , they are usually religious , and support the status quo or the status quo ante . 
    ** progress ** ( society )  those with higher progress scores believe in social change and rationality . 
  though not always , they are usually secular or atheist , and support environmental action and scientific or technological research .

  yes , with johansson a very close second . 
  or nisse , svenne , svennebanan . 
  `` average joe '' would be a `` medel-svensson '' . 
   i 'm not sure in what way the religious questions played a role ... that would be in the societal axis , i.e the final tradition-progress spectrum . 
  [ my results ] ( https://8values.github.io/results.html?e=73.2&amp;d=71.8&amp;g=73.1&amp;s=86.0 ) . 
  as many have said , this is clearly calibrated for the american public and i would be surprised if the majority of europeans did n't get social liberalism or libertarian socialism . 
  some of them seem a little ... ( puts on sunglasses ) ... butthurt . 
  charles xii of sweden fought several battles in the great northern war where he was heavily outnumbered . 
  most famously the battle of narva . 
   charles xii positioned his 8,000 men ( another 2,500 men were garrisoned in the city and would take part in the battle at a later stage ) opposite the besieging russian army of about 34,000 to 40,000 troops . 
   ( ... )  the swedes attacked in two columns , quickly broke through the russian lines , cutting them in three , and rounded them up . 
  at one crucial point , a bridge over the narova river collapsed under retreating russian troops : the stampede led to the overall losses of 6,000 -- 18,000 russians , depending on sources . 
  the remainder surrendered . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_narva_ ( 1700 ), 
  itt : people being spanked as children and horrified swedes . 
  i disagree . 
  drowning and drinking are conceptually different things . 
  being spanked and being beaten over the buttocks are conceptually the same thing . 
  most of the rise is due to heating of surface water , ( 0 -- 700 m ) not the deep ocean . 
   over the altimetry period ( 1993 -- 2010 ) , the rate for the 0 -- 700 m depth range is 0.8 [ 0.5 -- 1.1 ] mm yr ^ -- 1 and 1.1 [ 0.8 -- 1.4 ] mm yr ^ -- 1 when accounting for the deep ocean . 
  from `` 13.3.1 thermal expansion contribution '' in the fifth assessment report ( ar5 ) of the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change ( ipcc ) : http://www.climatechange2013.org/images/uploads/wgiar5_wgi-12doc2b_finaldraft_chapter13.pdf, 
  observed contributions to global mean sea level 1993-2010 : source | rise in mean sea level ( mm/year ) -- | -- thermal expansion | 1.1 [ 0.8 to 1.4 ] glaciers except in greenland and antarctica | 0.76 [ 0.39 to 1.13 ] glaciers in greenland | 0.10 [ 0.07 to 0.13 ] greenland ice sheet | 0.33 [ 0.25 to 0.41 ] antarctic ice sheet | 0.27 [ 0.16 to 0.38 ] land water storage | 0.38 [ 0.26 to 0.49 ] total of contributions | 2.8 [ 2.3 to 3.4 ] observed gmslr | 3.2 [ 2.8 to 3.6 ] from table 13.1 in the fifth assessment report ( ar5 ) of the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change ( ipcc ) : http://www.climatechange2013.org/images/uploads/wgiar5_wgi-12doc2b_finaldraft_chapter13.pdf, 
  much of the rise in sea level is due to the thermal expansion of water as it gets hotter . 
  a mediterranean dam wo n't help with that . 
  it 's a difference of degree , not kind . 
  the use of corporal punishment in the us seems to be declining rapidly , from 223 190 cases in 2006 , to 184 527 cases in 2009-2010 , to 166 807 cases in 2011-2012 ( [ estimations by u.s. department of education ] ( http://ocrdata.ed.gov/statenationalestimations ) ) . 
  hopefully the practice will be fully banned soon . 
  dishwasher . 
  but my regular water drinking glass and my tea/coffee cup i just rinse between uses . 
  i disagree . 
  the very use of corporal punishment is fundamentally wrong . 
  there have been numerous studies showing that it 's harmful for the development of children . 
  school corporal punishment is still [ legal in about half the states ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/school_corporal_punishment_in_the_united_states ) , and it was [ upheld in the supreme court ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ingraham_v._wright ) . 
  i quote from the ingraham v. wright article :  lemmie deliford , the assistant principal , held ingraham 's arms and solomon barnes , an assistant to the principal , held ingraham 's legs . 
  while ingraham was being restrained , wright used a spanking paddle to hit ingraham more than 20 times  the paddling was so severe that he suffered a hematoma requiring medical attention . 
  physicians instructed ingraham to rest at home for a total of eleven days . 
  that 's goddamn barbaric . 
  i 've noticed that askeurope has a quite a few swedish regulars , and we all have somewhat similar values and opinions . 
  due to our similar user names , i 've on several occasions started reading one of your posts and thought `` i do n't remember writing that '' . 
  well , i do feel kind of strongly about corporal punishment of children . 
  if i had a kid going to a us school and he/she was spanked with a paddle i would go ape shit . 
  it 's not super common , only [ 6 972 ] ( http://www.scb.se/hitta-statistik/sverige-i-siffror/namnsok/search/?namesearchinput=johnny ) / [ 6 174 ] ( http://www.scb.se/hitta-statistik/sverige-i-siffror/namnsok/search/?namesearchinput=jonny ) people are called johnny/jonny in sweden , and most - y names are in that range . 
   but it 's dying out , even in the us . 
  i will not be hitting my children good !, 
  two random notes : in primary school there was a foreign kid who was spanked at home and his teacher called the social services ( as teachers are legally required to do ) . 
  i do n't know what happened after that unfortunately . 
  secondly , as i was looking up the us laws regarding corporal punishment of minors on [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corporal_punishment_of_minors_in_the_united_states#alternatives ) , and under the headline `` alternatives '' it says `` main article : parenting '' .
