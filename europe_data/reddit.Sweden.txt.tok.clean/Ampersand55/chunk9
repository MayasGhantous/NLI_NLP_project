  i thought that was pretty funny , 
  nope . 
  never heard anyone swedish that was . 
  sweden was the first country that outlawed corporal punishment of children . 
  parents right to spank children was revoked in 1966 and in 1979 all forms of corporal punishment was outlawed . 
  i ca n't believe it 's still legal in some first world countries .

  names ending with - y , like benny , conny , johnny , kenny , ronny , sonny , tommy etc. 
  the phenomenon has been the subject of a study . 
   the y-name syndrome : prisons and prejudice  the y-name syndrome is a wide-spread conception in swedish society about men with names that end with a y , such as ronny , conny and jonny . 
  y-names are taken as signals of low socioeconomic status , including criminality . 
  to the best of our knowledge , the subject has , as of yet , not be en examined empirically . 
  first , this thesis explores whether or not the y-name syndrome is evidence-based by examining the relation ship between y-names and socioeconomic status in 26 municipalities , and the prevalence of y-names among men who are , or have been in the custody of the swedish prison and probation service . 
  we find that the y-name syndrome is empirically grounded ; men with y-names are more likely to live in municipalities characterized by indicators of low socioeconomic status and are over-represented among criminals . 
  second , we explore if people with y-names are discriminated against in the labor market . 
  this is investigated by looking at the ceteris paribus effect of a y-name on how 864 swedish adults rated an employment r\u00e9sum\u00e9 . 
  the test found no conclusive evidence of discrimination . 
  first one is this , pretty funny and accurate : https://img.memecdn.com/douchebag-sweden_o_841030.jpg then there are a bunch of stupid political ones , mostly regarding immigration and the `` sweden yes '' meme . 
  for domestic football you want cmore premium which costs $ 35.83 . 
  for international football ^ 1 you want viasat silver + sport which costs $ 53.28 . 
  ^ 1 champions league , premier league , la liga , serie a , ligue 1 , eredivisie and some others cups . 
  if you want to see both domestic and international football you need both .

  i 'm not against it , but i think marriage is outdated as a legal institution . 
  i do n't see why marriage should be governed by special laws . 
  so do ( and did ) i. yay i 'm normal ... ish . 
  i just want to clarify that i did n't downvote that post . 
  i welcome the correction . 
  btw , am i the only one worrying that other people might think it 's me when a valid response that contradicts or disagrees with me gets down-voted ? 
  maybe i 'm paranoid . 
  copying from [ tage erlander 's page on wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tage_erlander ) :  known for his moderation , pragmatism and self-irony , erlander often sought approval from the liberal-conservative opposition for his policies , de facto dropping all pretences of wide-scale nationalizations whilst introducing reforms such as universal health insurance , pension additions and a growing public sector while stopping short of raising tax levels above the average oecd levels at the time . 
  until the 1960s , income taxes were lower in sweden than in the united states . 
   ( ... )  under erlander , the central pillars of the swedish welfare state were enacted between 1946 and 1947 , a period known as the social democratic `` harvest time . '' in 1946 and 1947 , three major reforms were enacted that introduced a basic pension , general child allowances and sickness cash benefits . 
  the national housing board was set up as the central authority providing subsidized loans and rent controls , while the national labour market board was established to coordinate the nationalized local employment offices and supervise the union-controlled but state-subsidized unemployment insurance funds . 
  in 1947 , a tax reform was carried out that reduced income taxes in low-income brackets , introduced an inheritance tax , and raised the marginal tax rate for higher tax brackets . 
   ( ... )  erlander coined the phrase `` the strong society '' , describing a society with a growing public sector taking care of the growing demand on many services that an affluent society creates . 
  the public sector , particularly its welfare state institutions grew considerably during his tenure as prime minister , while nationalizations were rare . 
  gr\u00e5sosse was used even before palme 's time ( 1960s ) , but he would probably fit the old garde of social democrats . 
  the haydays of the gr\u00e5sossar would probably be from per albin hansson 's government in 1932 to olof palme 's first reign to 1976 with tage erlander being the archetypical hero of the gr\u00e5sosse . 
  is betongsosse synonymous with gr\u00e5sosse or is it something else ? 
  i only heard `` ruttnande meloner '' from one person irl , but thought it was funny so i included it . 
  it was used once in a metro [ blog post ] ( http://archive.is/exbyg ) . 
  until very recently everything was concentrated in stockholm , but the newly established governmental agency of equality ( j\u00e4mst\u00e4lldhetsmyndigheten ) was placed in g\u00f6teborg . 
  would be nice to get some of our caribbean colonies back for vacation purposes , like [ guadeloupe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/guadeloupe ) , [ tobago ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tobago ) or [ saint barth\u00e9lemy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saint_barth%c3%a9lemy ) . 
  thanks for taking the time , 
  tl ; dr : in the beginning there were lots of wars between swedes and danes , and then we formed nations and warred even more . 
  at one timed we joined together in the kalmar union , but that did n't stop us from warring each other , in fact the warring between us intensified . 
  then sweden broke out of the kalmar union in a bloody war , and we soon resumed our regular warring . 
  i would like to know about finland before the swedish crusades . 
  were they norse , pagan or something else ? 
  not in my country , but i like finland-swedish .

  the answering frequency was just 47 % so there is some uncertainty in the survey . 
  fascist , communist , `` nasse '' ( nazist ) , feminazist and racist are the big ones . 
  then we have some creative ones : * batikh\u00e4xa - batik witch - leftist overly politically correct old lady wearing batik patterned clothing * h\u00f6gersp\u00f6ke - right ghost - a metaphor for the scary right wing . 
  * negerkramare - negro hugger - self explanatory . 
  `` tree hugger '' . 
  * gr\u00e5sosse - grey social democrat - someone boring conforming to the traditional values of the old social democratic party . 
  * bokstavsv\u00e4nster - letter left - association with the numerous communist/far left parties with their initialisms like mlk , kfml ( r ) , kpml ( r ) , and their literal following of the communist ideologies . 
  * champagnesosse/cocktailsosse - champagne socialist/cocktail socialist - a person who claims to be socialist but have adopted the life of the bourgeois . 
  * fittstim - a shoaling/school of cunts - feminist women acting in groups like a school of fish . 
  * ruttnande meloner - rotting melons - a pejorative for the swedish green party . 
  green on the outside , red underneath and then brown in the core . 
  they present themselves as green , but they really are socialists ( red ) and fascists ( brown ) upon closer inspection . 
  5 % vegetarians and 3 % vegans according to a survey from 14-20 mars 2016 . https://issuu.com/djurensratt/docs/novus_rapport_djurens_r__tt_160322, 
  i 'm with you !, 
  many people use english words instead of the swedish words for many things technology related , even though we have an adequate domestic vocabulary to paraphrase gunnar str\u00e4ng . 
  also some words such as the r\u00e4tt ( as in the neuter of `` r\u00e4dd '' ) , f\u00e4rst ( as in the superlative of `` f\u00e5 '' ) are avoided mainly because they are unusual . 
  i dunno , i 'd say two thirds of those are positive interactions . 
  norway , denmark and finland . 
  who to do what with depends on our mood , recent sports results , and the alignment of the planets . 
  usually our home jerseys are blue on yellow and away jerseys are yellow on blue . 
  you did a good job with the flag , but we evolved it to perfection . 
  maybe . 
  i could see us having a flag like the [ swedish air force insignia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/roundel_of_sweden.svg/600px-roundel_of_sweden.svg.png ) . 
  i thought you were the swiss flag with the cross having melted and run out the sides . 
  sometimes i like to root for when you are playing and pretend you are swedish . 
  today 's fun fact : sweden , ukraine , kazakhstan and [ palau ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/palau ) are the only countries with blue and yellow flags . 
  barbados also has a blue and yellow flag , but they have a black trident mixed in . 
  i thought you were a medipak . 
  god help us all . 
  i thought that stupid fad had died already . 
  why would we ? 
  nordic cross flag connects us with our history and the rest of the nordics . 
  blue and yellow is also a fairly unique colour scheme making our national jerseys stand out when playing sports . 
  he 's all right i guess , but not very exciting . 
  he and his administration handled the recent stockholm terror attack well , i give him that . 
  i especially remember when he gave an obtrusive journalist ( kerstin holm ) the cold shoulder . 
  [ reminds me of this video from david mitchell 's soapbox ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om7o0mfkmpw ) . 
  we have done extensive [ academic research ] ( https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237273378_is_spoken_danish_intrinsically_unintelligible ) on the subject but we have yet to find an answer . 
  it 's one of life 's mysteries . 
  i can recommend [ that channel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=pl5ugqwofgvd1sbexryhuuvxiliu8u8-pn ) for learning swedish .

  well , it 's closer but it 's not a diphthong . 
  a video with the pronunciation : https://youtu.be/wpuscccxspy?t=100, 
  are you telling me it 's not `` wang goo '' ? 
  as can be expected , anything scandinavian with the letter \u00e5\u00e4\u00f6 gets completely butchered ( smore-guz-board , ang-stromm ) .
