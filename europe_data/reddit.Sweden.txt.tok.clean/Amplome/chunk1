we bought the land for our american colony from the local tribes , was given guadeloupe from the british , traded ownership of saint barth\u00e9lemy from the french , and bought ( and was later also given ) our african colony from the locals . 
  there are some claims that new sweden ( the american colony ) was expanded further than the bought land , but there are also claims against it . 
  there was a lot of `` stealing '' was going on , and i 'm by no means defending colonialism , but not all colonialism came from stealing . 
  a lot of colonies were bought and traded from locals . 
  it 's not that many years since it became readily available here , but nowadays you can find canadian maple syrup in pretty much any decent sized store . 
  it 's pretty expensive and not the absolute finest stuff made , but it 's not bad . 
  the adjective * rolig * ( `` funny '' ) used to mean `` calm '' as it still does in danish and norwegian . 
  * orolig * does however not mean `` unfunny '' as might be expected ( * o -- * is like the english `` un -- '' ) , but rather retains the old meaning `` worried '' / `` restless '' . 
  and the base word it 's formed from , ` ro ' , does still mean `` calmness '' . 
  unless it 's changed since i last spoke to a syv , or she was dreadfully misinformed , you can fail those . 
  they are required to be part of everyone 's curriculum ( along with p.e. 
  and natural sciences btw ) , but as long as you do n't miss too many points you can fail some . 
  it 's just the three in the core you must n't fail . 
  you also ca n't fail is the * gymnasiesarbete * and programme required courses , but since those are n't ubiquitously the same , i did n't mention those . 
  you can however not apply to any university course from the gymnasium quotient without the essential courses ( which also includes those you mentioned and natural sciences ) , or any other quotient without at least swedish 3 and english 6 . 
  at least that 's what she told me . 
  but she may have been wrong . 
  yeah , any but those three . 
  if you fail too many you wo n't meet the credit requirement and not be allowed to graduate because of that , but they wo n't stop your graduation for a failed course as long as your other grades are up . 
  it 's not recommended , but you can . 
  if you do fail a course you obviously wo n't get any credit for it which you might need in the future , but they wo n't stop your graduation . 
  only swedish , english , and maths will do that for you . 
  it 's , alongside swedish and maths , a core subject you must get a passing grade in in order to graduate here . 
  i have a pair i slip on when i 'm running down to the garbage room or [ tv\u00e4ttstuga ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tv%c3%a4ttstuga ) and such . 
  they 're not the most stylish things , but they are pretty practical . 
  i do not wear them in public . 
  -- [ scb \\ [ pdf \\ ] ] ( http://www.scb.se/grupp/hitta_statistik/historisk_statistik/_dokument/valstatistiken/valstatistik%20allmanna%20valen%201988%20del%203%20specialundersokningar.pdf ) and that 's only the minority parties significant enough to make note of ; all with significantly more than 1 618 votes . 
  the socialist party was also king of the tinies in 1985 with 16 ' 247 , but i ca n't find order of the rest . 
  the communist party and scanian party did perform similarly in local elections in 1985 as they did 1988 and assuredly beat donald duck with relative ease . 
  i 'd love to be proven wrong , but i seriously doubt donald duck has ever been top 10 . 
  do you have a verifiable source on that ? 
  i ca n't find any breakdown of the `` other parties '' category anywhere trustworthy . 
  scb states sj\u00f6bopartiet was the largest `` small party '' , but i ca n't find any ranking of the others . 
  if the swedish wikipedia page over that election ( which does cite a book from 1993 ) is correct , it 'd come in ** thirteenth ** * at the highest * with 1535 votes . 
  apart from the seven parties that passed the 4 % - threshold and made it into parliament , it would also have been handily beaten by the greens ( 185 051 ) , sj\u00f6bopartiet ( 27 635 ) , sweden democrats ( 4 877 ) , people 's democrats ( 3 645 ) , and the communist party ( 2 969 ) if not more . 
  and for anyone not swedish , i can add that if 1535 is the correct number of votes , that 'd equal 0,028 % of the votes -- our threshold is 4 % ... 
  central america was pretty forgiving in my experience . 
  i mean , you have capitals like panama city , guatemala city , san salvador ... 
  i do n't know how long it took until i learned to spell honduras ' tegucigalpa though . 
  it 's the caribbean that was a killer for me . 
  not only are the island nations tiny and difficult to remember like * saint vincent and the grenadines * , their capitals are all also so generic and easy to mix up . 
  * st. george 's , st. john 's , kingston , kingstown * etc. 
  i always found south america the easiest when we had to learn that ` countries , capitals , and stuff ' - stuff . 
  south america was only 12 fairly large countries with easily memorable capitals ; no tiny islands or unpronounceable names . 
  the most difficult part what remembering which order the guianas came in . 
  that 's not how we were taught when i went to school . 
  we were taught central america was located in , and part of , north america . 
  the caribbean countries were also never considered part of central america . 
  they were both sub-divisions of north america . 
  maybe it 's different abroad , but i 'll tell you what they would n't do here : they would n't sound the signal that indicates the danger has passed and stop . 
  also ( at least here ) you are supposed to turn on the radio ( or tv , internet etc. ), 
  where they assuredly tell you if it 's the real deal . 
  maybe it 's regional , but i 'd definitely say * uti v\u00e5r hage * and * vi g\u00e5 \u00f6ver daggst\u00e4nkta berg * are more universally known than * byssan lull * . 
   `` excuse my french '' ( urs\u00e4kta franskan ) it 's uncommon alright , i have never heard that in my life . 
  just sounds like an anglicism to me . 
   my local group of friends use `` excuse my danish '' ( urs\u00e4kta danskan ) when we throw up or dry-heave . 
  i think that 's more widespread than this supposed excusing of french ... 
  it 's not just your group of friends . 
  they test them at 15:00 the first non-holiday monday every quarter here . 
  they sounded this monday , next time will be in three months . 
  edit : what the different signals mean : meaning | signal | what to do -- | -- | -- important message to the public | alternating 7s of sound , 14s silence for at least two minutes | turn on radio for further information . 
  air-raid | short signals for at least a minute | get to the air-raid shelter , turn on radio . 
  war | alternating 30s sound , 15s silence for at least five minutes | turn on radio . 
  get to the shelter if civilian , report for duty if not . 
  danger has passed | 30-40s uninterrupted signal | end of message when they test they play the signal for * important message to the public * followed by * danger has passed * . 
  there 's also the * folkh\u00f6gskola * ( [ folk high school ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/folk_high_school ) ) . 
  unlike the gymnasium you do n't get a grade in each subject , but rather an evaluation of your studying capacity across all subjects . 
  you can do it as an alternative or compliment to the gymnasium , but it 's only available for people aged 18 + . 
  most subjects at folk high school are similar to those of the gymnasium and provide the same qualifications for the purpose of university , but gives you no grades . 
  you just get merits for the courses you 've finished to go along with your evaluation . 
   would you say that gryning is a sliding scale on what the time shows for this ? 
  i do n't use it astronomically correct , just instead of the earliest morning . 
  sure it changes a bit through the year but so do the others for me . 
  i 'd use neither ` night ' nor ` morning ' for that time , so that 's why i felt like including it . 
   * runt/vid lunch * is something i often refer to when something going to happen between 11-13 . 
  oh i 'm sure , but to me that sounds like something happening around the lunch * break * ( which obviously does fall at that time ) so i would n't . 
  to me it 's like how * vid frukosten * does n't mean ` morning ' . 
  i also use * gryning * ( `` dawn '' ) . 
  i 'd also never refer to noon as just `` lunch '' , to me that refers to the meal eaten then or the break to eat such meal . 
  dialectal differences i suppose . 
  noon itself i 'd refer to as * middag * ( `` midday '' ) , * mitt p\u00e5 dagen * ( `` middle of the day '' ) , or * lunchtid * ( `` lunch time '' ) . 
  it depends on who i 'm with . 
  some exclusively use the term ` middag ' for `` dinner '' so that can be a bit ambiguous . 
  football ( soccer ), 
  * mario * is not used in the whole of europe and someone named that could potentially have a difficult time in a few european countries . 
  not because it 's difficult to pronounce , but people just think of the video game character . 
  kontinent . 
   this ca n't really be said about danish though . 
  we say en voksen ( a grown-up ) and et-barn . 
  we say et tr\u00e6 ( a tree ) , but we say en busk ( a bush ) . 
  [ ... ] et bord ( a table ) - en stol ( a chair ) , et gulv ( a floor ) - en v\u00e6g ( a wall ) . 
  all those words have the exact same genders in swedish , you can still talk about it . 
  `` more commonly '' and `` a lot '' , does n't mean `` all '' . 
  in other languages you also have words not fitting the pattern , then add a few hundred years of grammatical irrelevance to that and you do get what we have . 
  yes , it is indeed very unclear , but you can see the general trend when looking at * a lot * of nouns . 
  that does n't mean you ca n't still cherry pick , it 's a trend , not a rule . 
  nowadays there is nothing even close to a clear system , it 's all based on a `` feeling '' . 
  that 's just a remnant of when it had some logic . 
   some words can be both genders , at any given time . 
  i 'm not sure how this works in danish , if it has anything to do with harmonization or such , that exists in other languages .
