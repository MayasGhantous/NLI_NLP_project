  it 's how the feminine * agua * ( `` water '' ) ended up becoming standardized as taking on the masculine article in spanish , while it in all other aspects remains feminine . 
  but as said i do n't know how what you 're describing is in danish . 
  the dictionary does denote every nouns gender . 
  do you inflect such nouns differently too ? 
  can you give an example sentence where it 'd switch ? 
   we do n't use genders as they do in other languages i do n't really understand this , every gendered language has its system . 
  we have common-neuter , german has masculine-feminine-neuter , spanish has masculine-feminine , basque has inanimate-animate etc. 
  what do you mean by `` fluent '' ? 
  i mean , our systems have been obfuscated as the languages have evolved , but fundamentally we have a similar system to german . 
  it 's just that our masculine and feminine genders merged into the common gender in most dialects . 
  you can still see this system in most native nouns . 
  living things and naturally gendered nouns are more commonly of the common gender , neuter describes a lot of concepts and inanimate objects , but it is a bit obfuscated . 
  but in most languages there are irregularities . 
  in german `` m\u00e4dchen '' is for example neuter , despite meaning `` girl '' . 
  and how do you instinctively tell the gender of non-sexually reproductive things ? 
  gender assignment differs widely . 
  in spanish `` map '' is for example masculine , in polish it 's feminine . 
  i know , it 's the same with rikssvenska in sweden . 
  sure , some dialect may assign a noun a different gender , but they still have a gender . 
  that 's all i was saying . 
  danish is a gendered language . 
  is n't it * en kop * in standard danish ? 
  grammatical gender is completely detached from natural gender . 
  it 's a linguistic concept , not a biological or social one . 
  you do have grammatical genders and they are both genders . 
  i do n't know , pretty indifferent i suppose . 
  they can be a difficulty when learning a language , but also serve purposes . 
  i would n't artificially remove them , but if they disappeared naturally ( like our masculine and feminine did for example ) i would n't lose any sleep . 
  are you thinking about a specific language or type of gender ? 
  for a typical swede you talk about a `` svensson '' . 
  [ * n.n. 
  * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nomen_nescio ) is the typical placeholder name like `` john doe '' . 
  we call it * frankrike * . 
  it means the same thing , just less badass ... 
  we cooperate . 
  esa 's launchpad with interplanetary capabilities is in kourou . 
  only thing that bothers me about it a little is that the demonym for the modern country and the predating germanic tribe are the same in english . 
  it can make it a bit confusing when talking about history . 
  [ these ] ( http://www.jordbruksverket.se/download/18.6223f767134a3048c1e80001534/de+popul%c3%a4raste+hundnamnen.pdf ) it 's from the official registry all swedish dogs should be registered in . 
  top 10 is :  molly wilma bella ludde ronja bamse ( comic book character ) rocky charlie alice sigge ` registrering saknar namn ' means `` registration 's missing name '' . 
  well , i like mn wild too . 
  back when i played nhl 2003 ( or whatever year it was ) , i always used to play avalanche vs wild . 
  mostly because i sucked and wild had the worst rating , but still . 
  i kind of developed a fondness for them . 
  i do n't care much about any rivalries and such since i 'm so detached from all of it . 
  i mean , with the internet i could easily find out about all shenanigans off the ice , but since i 'm not surrounded by any of it , it does n't really matter to me . 
  i 'm never rooting for the habs , bruins , pens , flyers , hawks , and kings for ... reasons ... , but the rest i kind of have an imaginary tier list of support for . 
  minnesota 's up there . 
   i think mn has a couple swedes !, 
  there are like four-five teams without any swedes , so having some is n't much of an accomplishment ... :p sweden has the most players in the nhl of any foreign country !, 
  more than twice as many as the second , russia !, 
  some teams , like the red wings , canucks , and preds , are more `` swedish '' . 
  for me and my nonsense ideas like 20 % of the roster should be swedish for for me to take any extra interest * because of that * . 
  but it 's not like i only root for swedes . 
  the wild does n't reach that percentage and i quite like you , the blackhawks do and i want them to lose . 
    also fun fact , probably not as big a deal ... 
  i 've certainly heard of the miracle , but as you said it 's not that big of a deal for me . 
  it was before my time and i do n't have any connection to either team . 
  when it comes to international hockey there are two years that matter most to a swede : 1994 and 2006 . 
  in 1994 forsberg 's beauty gave us the gold medal over canada in a shootout . 
  2006 we became the first , and thus far only , country to win both the olympics and wc the same year ( take that , canada ! ) . 
  i 'll also never forget the wc quarterfinals against finland 2003 , fucking hell that was a great game . 
  i know north america does n't care as much about international hockey , especially the wc , but we do . 
  so i like it !, 
  and i freaking hate that the nhl are n't going to cooperate with even the olympics anymore ... :( they never cared for the wc , but now there wo n't be any stage for the best international hockey . 
  wan na talk about shitting the bed , eh ? 
  i 'm really an avs guy myself ... 
  but i 'm rooting for nashville now . 
  it 's one of the few places i 've actually been to , they 're fun to watch and just so happen to be yellow and blue and have a bunch of swedes . 
  the mere notion of beating children wakes us up . 
  no , i do n't know what these other guys are doing up , but i have n't gone to bed yet . 
  had to watch hockey , you know ? 
  it 's your fault you play in the middle of the night . 
  and if you actually wanted to know the sun rises at four where i live . 
  me too . 
  i think that 's true for pretty much all of us . 
  i 've never met a swede who 's indifferent towards it . 
  that 's why you can bet your ass there will be swedish flairs at these questions . 
  it 's not a bad thing , i just find it funny . 
  i 'm here too , are n't i ? 
  hmm , let 's look at the replies :  / u/highschooldramaqueen - sweden  / u/ampersand55 - sweden  / u/frikoz - sweden there 's really nothing that brings out swedes quicker than mentioning corporal punishment of children ...  to answer your question : no . 
  big surprise , i know . 
  i do n't really know when religion lost power , but here are some relevant law changes : 1860 and 1873 we had two [ dissenter acts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dissenter_acts_\\ ( sweden \\ ) ) that allowed people to leave the state church for another denomination . 
  1951 you could leave without joining something else . 
  1991 the church of sweden lost the task to handle civil registration . 
  2000 the church and state separated . 
  can be noted it did n't really have any influence . 
  depends on how you look at things . 
  the song is n't officially designated so there is no right or wrong . 
  there have been multiple additions written to the song , louise ahl\u00e9n 's are just the most popular . 
  most of the time they 're not performed , but as you say , sometimes they are . 
  richard dybeck wrote the original song in 1844 . 
  he died in 1877 . 
  the song started being perceived as a national anthem in the 1890s . 
  in 1910 louise ahl\u00e9n wrote her verses . 
  as you said in your original comment verse 1 +2 have a slightly different feel from 3 +4 . 
  they are quite literally about different things . 
  the original title richard dybeck gave it was `` s\u00e5ng till norden '' . 
  it was never meant as a song about sweden , sweden and norway were even in a union at the time . 
  ahl\u00e9n 's lyrics are on the other hand just about sweden .
