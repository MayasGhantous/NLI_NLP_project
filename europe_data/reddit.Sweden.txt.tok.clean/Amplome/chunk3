  her lyrics are additions to the song . 
  but if you 'd write verse 5 and 6 today , would they be part of the song or not ? 
  there is no official stance , it 's in the eye of the beholder . 
  but most only consider the dybeck 's lyrics the anthem . 
  it 's to this day only the anthem in practice , not by law , so there 's no official declaration of it being so . 
  but it started being perceived as the anthem after it was sung during a dinner for oscar ii in the early 1890s , who at the time was king of norway and sweden . 
  since we were in a personal union at the time we could n't just sing about sweden . 
  the two extra verses described above were written by louise ahl\u00e9n in 1910 . 
  they 're by virtually no one considered part of the anthem , but as the anthem is n't officially defined i guess you could argue for that . 
  the anthem is generally only considered to be the two original verses written by dybeck . 
   third and fourth paragraph [ ... ] is about serving your country until death and the swedish empire are n't part of the anthem . 
  the anthem is richard dybeck 's lyrics ( i.e. , verse 1 +2 ) . 
  the anthem is just de facto so there 's no official declaration what it is , but louise ahl\u00e9n 's additions are considered part of the anthem by virtually no one . 
  they were written after the song had already started being perceived as the national anthem . 
  it 's pretty archaic and mostly exists in place names nowadays . 
  it was used for small market towns and marketplaces -- places without town privileges , but that had market rights . 
  it comes from old norse . 
  relates to the verb ` k\u00f6pa ' ( `` buy '' ) . 
  the dictionary defines it as `` city-like community '' but as said , it 's pretty archaic outside of place names . 
  the government ministries are in stockholm , but there are plenty of decentralized agencies . 
  for example : skogsstyrelsen ( swedish forest agency ) : j\u00f6nk\u00f6ping jordbruksverket ( swedish board of agriculture ) : j\u00f6nk\u00f6ping sj\u00f6fartsverket ( swedish maritime administration ) : norrk\u00f6ping transportstyrelsen ( swedish transport agency ) : norrk\u00f6ping nationellt forensiskt centrum ( swedish national forensic centre ) : link\u00f6ping trafikverket ( swedish transport administration ) : borl\u00e4nge brottsoffermyndigheten ( swedish crime victim compensation and support authority ) : ume\u00e5 etc. 
   they replaced the old beautiful buildings and replaced them with [ concrete ] ( http://imgur.com/a/dbha0 ) did they demolish that building just enough to make room for the new one and then just left the rest half-broken ? 
  what 's going on there ? 
  i would n't . 
  it 's nice in a coa , but as a flag it falls victim of the `` seal on a bed sheet '' syndrome most us states ' do . 
  the cross makes for a lot better flag imo . 
  i must admit i do n't really know who that is . 
  sorry if i 'm incredibly ignorant . 
  kissing on the cheek ? 
  never . 
  with a stranger ? 
  never * er * . 
  hey now , what 's unintelligible about our language ? 
  ninja-edit : just noticed the changed flair . 
  are you snapphaning / u/werkstadt ? 
  why do you have that thing as flair ? 
  yup , same origins . 
  i think wednesday for example got its name from the old saxon * w\u014ddan * and not old norse * \u00d3\u00f0inn * and such , but it 's essentially the same guy anyway . 
  m\u00e5ndag : [ moon 's ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/m%c3%a1ni ) day tisdag : [ tyr 's ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/t%c3%bdr ) day onsdag : [ odin 's ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/odin ) day torsdag : [ thor 's ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thor ) day fredag : [ frigg 's ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frigg ) day l\u00f6rdag : bathing day s\u00f6ndag : [ sun 's ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/s%c3%b3l_\\ ( sun \\ ) ) day, 
  nah , it 's the same as english . 
  literally . 
  * gud * is a cognate of the english ` god ' . 
  * god * is a cognate of the english ` good ' . 
  it existed as ` god ' in old - and middle english too . 
  that they 're people like everyone else i guess ... ? 
  i had a classmate from somalia , she was always very pleasant . 
   i do n't think that any of `` your '' letters are in a different place on our keyboards than they are on yours ; our extra letters are off to the side , where i think you guys just have some symbols that are more easily reshuffled . 
  yeah , they 're both qwerty layouts . 
  the us layout has ` ; ` / ` ' ` / ` [ ` where we have ` \u00d6 ` / ` \u00c4 ` / ` \u00c5 ` respectively . 
  most symbols are different though . 
  of the top of my head only ` !, 
  # % , . ` are on the same place on a us layout , the rest are all different . 
  that 's one thing i never got , why do you have the \u00c6 and \u00d8 reversed compared to everyone else around you ? 
  we , norwegians , finns , germans etc. 
  all have \u00d6 / \u00d8 + \u00c4 / \u00c6 , and then you lot come and are all backwards . 
  why ... ? 
  a standard swedish keyboard . 
  writing english is just a matter of not using the extra letters we have , there 's nothing missing . 
  it 's worse the other way around with writing swedish on an english keyboard . 
  you find ketchup on sausages and burgers weird ? 
  it 's eaten all over the world . 
  on which pizzas ? 
  all types or some specific kinds ? 
  i 've never heard of it here either . 
  and we 're not exactly afraid of putting weird shit on pizza and disrespecting italian cuisine . 
  i have never in my life heard of anyone putting ketchup on pizza here either . 
  is that common across the gulf ? 
  the council of jewish communities in sweden estimates 20 000 . 
  there are no official records so that 's as close to an answer you 'll get . 
  i do n't know any to my knowledge but i do n't know , it 's not something i talk about with people . 
  i would n't care . 
  generally yes . 
  a few years esc has had more , but melodifestivalen is in general the more significant event . 
  in the past ten years the final of melodifestivalen has averaged 3 ' 766 ' 600 viewers , the final of esc has averaged almost 750 000 fewer : 3 ' 023 ' 300 . 
  the 2010 drop is because sweden was eliminated in the semi . 
  2014 and 2016 esc had more viewers . 
  from what i gather it was a block list for the @sweden twitter account to supposedly prevent such accounts from pestering the curators , but it also included several accounts who 'd never even interacted with the account . 
  it was unblocked yesterday after numerous complaints . 
  you do n't have to look at different countries to find different ages . 
  in sweden there 's : 2 . 
  no age restriction for stuff below 2.25 % abv 3 . 
  18 yr for closed containers 2.25-3 .5 % abv 4 . 
  18 yr for open containers 5 . 
  20 yr for closed containers 3.5 % + note this is for * purchasing * alcohol . 
  there are no age restrictions for * drinking * at all . 
  parents can give their kids at home etc. 
  does l\u00e4tta mean something in german ? 
  make your own . 
  cocoa powder and sugar is all you need . 
  maybe add a hint of salt and vanilla too if you feel like it . 
  if you do that you can make it your own cocoa to sugar ratio that is n't so ungodly sweet . 
  really ? 
  it 's only 25p ? 
  ` 0.25 # = 2.86 sek ` man that 's cheap . 
  the `` qp '' we have here is a lot more expensive . 
  of course , it 's the same burger . 
  but we 've got the metric system here , we do n't know what the fuck a `` quarter pound '' is . 
  * we 've got the metric system here , we would n't know what the fuck a `` quarter pounder '' is . 
   we just call it a quarter pounder here , or more commonly a `` qp '' it 's called * ` qp cheese ' * here . 
  they do n't call it `` quarter pounder '' themselves , just `` qp '' .
