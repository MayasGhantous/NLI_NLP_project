  yep , that is true . 
  there was a long meticulous planning for that switch that took years of preparation . 
  there 's so much logistics to account for . 
  all buses need replacement , every single traffic sign across the country need to be set up anew on the other side , many even redesigned to follow the vienna convention , roads repainted , extra police supervision was required etc. 
  hell , we even had songs written in preparation for it !, 
  it was also easier in the 1960s sweden than it would be in the uk of today . 
  sweden had 7,8 million people at the time and not as many cars on the road , and still it was a massive endeavor . 
  but yeah , in the end it went relatively smoothly . 
  it is possible . 
  you do n't have an opt-out . 
  it 's like with us : you are forced to switch at some point , but you 're not forced to meet the requirements to do so . 
  in essence that gives an indefinite opt-out de facto , but de jure you do n't have one . 
  switching to euro has been mandatory ever since the eu was founded at maastricht . 
  only denmark and the uk have opt-outs from it since they joined the ec before the eu was founded . 
  we do n't have an opt-out , we just consciously choose not to meet the entry requirements for the euro . 
  it 's not a special deal , and it is to my knowledge still the same for new members . 
  the reason it 's finicky is that they do n't want countries with too unstable economies to weaken the euro , so you ca n't force the change straight up . 
  but in doing that you 're essentially leaving an indefinite de facto opt-out . 
  i think you still technically can follow the rules without exceptions and still not adopt the euro . 
  you 're forced to switch to the euro at some point , but you 're not forced to meet the entry requirements to do so . 
  there is at least one country using that loophole . 
  we even had a referendum on whether or not we should join . 
  and now we 're in the process of a complete redesign of our bills and coins ... 
  it 's freaking weird to me . 
  you go to an ikea on the other side of the planet and see all those product names in swedish . 
  then you realize the books in the bookshelves are n't actually nameless props , but full-fledged books in swedish . 
  yeah , it 's been headquartered there since like the '70s - '80s or so . 
  mostly tax purposes . 
  it 's run through a non-profit foundation registered there . 
  it 's not necessarily been run from there though . 
  ingvar lived in switzerland and ran it from there for years , now he 's moved back to sweden . 
  i 've been to ikea abroad . 
  the e and a stand for places in sweden . 
  that counts , right ... ? 
  frequently when wwii is mentioned i see people bring up bullshit about us . 
  i agree with you that they do n't know enough about it as it 's mostly made up stuff or misinformation , but they bring that up anyway . 
  i also see the deluge and schwedentrunk mentioned from time to time . 
  i 'm not offended by people pointing out what sweden 's done in the past , but i am bothered by people talking about bullshit as fact . 
  we do n't have a designated national animal , but op just asked for an animal mascot . 
  just look at anything depicting sweden and swedishness : souvenir shops , swedish stands for sport events , swarje etc. , and it 's moose you 'll find . 
  it 's not an officially designated national animal , no . 
  but it sure is what would be our animal mascot . 
  it 's more moose/elk ( alces alces ) . 
  * did * represent . 
  it 's been its own letter for a long time . 
  just like the dots above \u00c4 do n't represent e anymore , the circle does n't represent o. 
  it 's just its own letter . 
  that is not far from the truth of how it once originated , but not what it is today . 
  and that was just an example of how it 's different . 
  if you actually want an example of a comparable letter , what about w ? 
  it 's literally two vs. that 's a stupid letter we do n't really have . 
  the \u00c5 in ' \u00e5ker ' and o in ` orka ' are two different sounds . 
  main difference is that the \u00c5 there is long and the o short , but they also have different phonetic values . 
  in those words the \u00c5 is generally an [ / o\u02d0 / ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/close-mid_back_rounded_vowel ) and the o generally an [ / \u0254 / ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/open-mid_back_rounded_vowel ) . 
  but it may differ with dialect , and i do n't know how it is in fenno-swedish . 
  finnish has mostly [ / o\u031e / ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mid_back_rounded_vowel ) to my knowledge , which is yet another similar , but slightly different , sound . 
  main issue is that our letters just do n't match up . 
  our \u00c5 is close to your o , our o is closer to your u. 
  the short \u00c4 and e can be pretty similar , in some dialects even the same , but they symbolize different sounds . 
  that 's why those words are spelled with \u00c4 , they 're not es !, 
  it 's mostly confusing if you 're not used to the minor particularities of swedish phonetics or are used to a dialect that does n't have those differences . 
  it 's all about what you 're used to . 
  i find your consonant gradation confusing because i often ca n't tell it apart . 
  i do n't think an english speaker should criticize someone else over letters . 
  you probably have the language with the most irregular orthography in the world . 
  it can be understood with tough thorough thought though . 
   besides \u00c5 / \u00c4 / \u00d6 are separate letters in swedish , and finnish . 
  there are no umlauts , no rings ; nothing . 
  they 're not modifications of a and o , they 're as different as i and e . an e is just an i with three added lines , right ? 
  that is what it means . 
  joining the eu, 
  when sweden won the world championships in hockey 1957 not all players knew the lyrics for the national anthem , so they sang [ helan g\u00e5r ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/helan_g%c3%a5r ) instead . 
  it 's a drinking song everyone knows . 
  how would you use that in a context where it 'd equal ` cool ' ? 
  i ca n't think of anything that i 'd translate with ` cool ' , only ` sick ' , ` insane ' , ` crazy ' etc. 
  i like words that are uncool in a `` lame parent '' kind of way . 
  i do n't like using words that are uncool in a `` peaked at 15 and never grew up '' kind of way . 
  but , yeah , i just did n't want to give the impression that they 're all ubiquitous anymore . 
  * ` cool ' * is in the dictionary here . 
  it 's a loanword from english ( only slang usage , not `` cold '' ) from the '50s . 
  it inflects like all other adjectives in swedish : * coolt , coola * etc. 
  -- other words i can think of that could kind of describe the same thing in some usages depending on dialect and age : grym = cruel h\u00e4ftig = rash fr\u00e4ck = rude fet = fat tuff = tough but some have become obsolete and uncool to say . 
  the polar bears on svalbard may fit those categories . 
  where i 'm from it 's easily going to a bar , but in sweden as a whole ... i do n't know . 
  i 'd think going to bars , but i really do n't know . 
  you 're right . 
  not very popular where i 'm from either though . 
  no , not really . 
  there are some doing it , mostly in the north , but it has n't exactly been entirely legal for a long time . 
  and nowadays it 's easier to go to another eu country and fill the car anyway . 
  you just got ta pre-party hard on german stuff . 
  depends how much you drink and what you do . 
  me personally ? 
  i do n't do clubbing and i ca n't recall the last time i drank more than a pint of beer when going out , it 's too expensive for me . 
  my local bar takes ~ 6 $ for whatever they have on tap , so that i guess . 
  that looks like a rotated * a * of the swedish sign language . 
  are they learning to communicate with our deaf ? 
  that 's so sweet !, 
  got ta give a thumbs up to that , which incidentally is also the next letter of the alphabet : * b * . 
   think of a name for the central african republic it 's apparently * k\u00f6d\u00f6r\u00f6s\u00ease t\u00ee b\u00eaafr\u00eeka * in sango .
