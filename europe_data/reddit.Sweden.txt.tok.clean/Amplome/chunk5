  even if * k\u00f6d\u00f6r\u00f6s\u00ease * is only some inflected form of `` republic '' , i want to nominate that on the principle it looks cool . 
  i have no idea how to pronounce any of it but i 'm liking the [ s\u00e4ng\u00f6 w\u00efk\u00efp\u00ead\u00efy\u00e4a ] ( https://sg.wikipedia.org/wiki/k%c3%b6d%c3%b6r%c3%b6s%c3%aase_t%c3%ae_b%c3%aaafr%c3%aeka ) . 
  they seem to really love diacritics , i can respect that . 
  not really what you 're asking , but the original saying is * `` give him and inch ( thumb ) and he 'll take an ell ( elbow to fingertip ) '' * . 
  we have * `` give him the pinky and he 'll reach for the whole hand '' * in a similar manner . 
  ca n't think of any metric phrases . 
  tjekkiet and tsjekkia respectively . 
  i 'm not aware of either having any such dialectal variations . 
  not a polyglot , but i have studied the scandinavian languages . 
  i got that country 's name wrong countless of times , eventually even i learn . 
  the guy could n't go through every language , man ... that said , i think he just misspelled it . 
  as far as i know , it 's not `` tjekkien '' in any language . 
  and kk -  ck is easy to get wrong . 
  yeah , i got that !, 
   i was just giving you the viewpoint for people who that may not be the case for since you replied to a norwegian with `` no one ever called norway or russia like that though '' giving an impression of how the two are n't comparable . 
  to a norwegian they are entirely comparable . 
  you can say the equivalent of `` czech republic '' in norwegian too , but it 's exactly like calling russia the `` russian federation '' . 
  i understand perfectly what you 're referring to , i just wanted to explain the logic behind that reasoning . 
  there 's no problem ... 
  i did get it , but a hyperbole should be an exaggeration of a fact . 
  i was just pointing out that it 's the younger term of the two and it 's not even one bit old . 
  it has n't been called that `` forever '' . 
  i do n't know about french but in english it was n't really a thing before the '90s . 
  [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/9lug1bd.png ) you have mentions since 1800 , if you [ cut it before the increase of the 1990s ] ( http://i.imgur.com/w0q0zht.png ) you 'll see how czechia was just as popular if not more prior the 1980s . 
  the name `` czechia '' is older than `` czech republic '' . 
  i do n't know if you 're too young to remember czechoslovakia , but people did n't really refer to anything as `` czech republic '' during that time . 
  and if you go back even further you 'll soon encounter the lands only being referred to as bohemia , moravia etc. 
  that does n't change the fact that it 's become unanimously accepted , but it has by no means been around `` forever '' . 
  it 's a recent name . 
  that said i 'm not refuting the fact how native french , english etc. 
  speaker may see it , but you 're replying to a norwegian arguing against his argument for preferring one over the other . 
  judging by the norwegian flair , i 'm willing to bet / u/vidicmufc is n't in your little `` we 're used to '' - group . 
  in most languages it 's one word , * we * 're used to calling it that . 
  i do n't know if that `` no one ever called '' statement is accurate , because it would n't surprise me if some language used multiple words . 
  but , yes , to us who speak languages that do n't it does seem weird . 
  but likewise it 's weird to us ( who only use one word ) having to put a `` republic '' there for the czech one . 
  we have a roof for prescription medication . 
  if you reach 1100 sek in a twelve month period you get a discount of 50 % , after 1600 sek the discount increase to 75 % , and from 2200 ( ~ 227 $ ) it 's free . 
  if you 're in the first bracket and pay full price , the medicine you mentioned : alprazolam 2mg 100 pills ( ca n't find 60 ) : * 333 sek * ( ~ 34,4 $ ) inderal 40mg 200 pills ( ca n't find 100 ) : * 153 sek * ( ~ 15,8 $ ), 
  too confrontational . 
  i 'd rather start walking backwards to maintain distance . 
  it is n't * that * bad anymore , i lived abroad long enough . 
  i do still find it a bit awkward since it 's still not antirely natural for me , but it 's a lot worse when you 're two awkward swedish teenagers ... 
  but what i 've found worse is how i can hype myself up and be ready , and then the bastard goes for an extra kiss . 
  what 's up with that ? 
  ca n't you all just agree on a number an be happy ? 
  it 's confusing . 
  thanks for the trick though . 
  i 'm going to be permanently sick from now on , it 's brilliant . 
  i do n't even have to lie , doing that does make me homesick . 
  we do it every third month . 
  first non-holiday monday of every quarter at 15:00 , `` hoarse fredrik '' makes his noises . 
  because they 'd sound at a time that is n't designated for testing ? 
  or if something actually happened to go down at that very time , they do n't stop after just one run through . 
  aaaah , it 's horrible !, 
  i still remember the horror of the first time our teacher made us to practice greeting each other `` properly '' in class . 
  what 's wrong with a firm courteous handshake an arm length away ? 
  there 's no need to invade my bubble !, 
  i do n't think we do , no . 
  at least i ca n't recall ever hearing of one . 
  i 'd look for a competent vice-president and resign . 
  i 'd want someone competent in that position , not someone like me . 
  iphone according to the survey iis did in november last year . 
  ( m\u00e4n = men ; kvinnor = women ), 
  in europe as a whole yes . 
  in sweden iphone leads according to the latest survey i could find ( nov. 2016 ) . 
  some translations for people who do n't speak swedish and could n't deduce the different categories on that page : * vanligaste efternamnen * : most common last names * vanligaste namnen p\u00e5 nyf\u00f6dda flickor * : most common names for newborn girls * vanligaste namnen p\u00e5 nyf\u00f6dda pojkar * : most common names for newborn boys * vanligaste namnen p\u00e5 m\u00e4n * : most common names for men * vanligaste namnen p\u00e5 kvinnor * : most common names for women all categories include any potential spelling variations and is for 2016 . 
  yep , i know . 
  that 's exactly what i meant by :  now the actual prayer will also sound a bit weird directly translated as swahili has different grammar . 
  my friend is a native swahili speaker , she 's the one who translated it for me . 
  the song is n't gibberish , it 's just not natural swahili . 
  the words in bold correspond to the actual prayer , if it were only them it would be perfectly natural swahili . 
  it is a direct translation after all , they usually sound weird . 
  the issue is that it 's difficult to do a proper translation when the source material is n't natural language . 
  it 's the lord 's prayer reshuffled a bit to fit the music if anyone 's curious . 
  ` baba ' means `` father '' , ` yetu ' is an inflection of `` our '' . 
  as explained to me by my old kenyan classmate it 's not entirely coherent swahili , but you can understand the general sentiment . 
  directly translated the chorus is supposedly :  ** father our ** , our ** you **  ** in heaven ** our , our amen !, 
   father our , our you  m ** name yours ** e ** hallowed be ** now the actual prayer will also sound a bit weird directly translated as swahili has different grammar . 
  the bolded text is supposed to be the actual opening of the lord 's prayer . 
  as you can see there 's a random m , e , and amen and a lot of repeating fluff . 
  ^ ( disclaimer : i do n't speak swahili and this is all just what my old friend told me . 
  may be bullshit , but she is usually trustworthy . ), 
  i prefer [ mando diao 's interpretation ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypqm-mtkci ) of that old poem , even if it was played into the ground over here . 
  rymdf\u00e5glar / wasa kind of ruins it with too much reverb and stuff in my opinion . 
  normal . 
  more boys play as more boys play sports in general , but football was at least during my upbringing not associated with either gender . 
  you could see more of a gender divide at the ice rink , with hockey being more a `` boy sport '' and figure skating more a `` girl sport '' . 
  saabs are durable , they do n't die . 
  there are plenty still on the road !, 
   the real * saab * is of course also alive and well , only the * saab automobile * general motors and later spyker had went bankrupt . 
  saab still does what it 's always done : airplanes , weaponry and stuff . 
  it 's what the name stands for : swedish * aeroplane * ab . 
  nah , we do n't believe in responding to ignorance with violence . 
  corporal punishment in schools has been prohibited for a long time . 
  nah , no punches would ever be thrown for such . 
  it 's not the 17th century anymore . 
  but if it was , punches would n't be thrown either , your snapphane ass would be broken on the wheel and killed . 
  but i honestly do n't know of anyone who 'd even react from such statement outside of reddit circlejerking . 
  people would probably be more likely to agree with it .
