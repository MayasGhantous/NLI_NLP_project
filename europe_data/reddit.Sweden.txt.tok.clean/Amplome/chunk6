  and scandinavia ( + finland ) is our little family , so them being good is nothing bad . 
  i really do n't know of anything that 'd guarantee a physical altercation . 
  tungsten has the highest melting point of any known element , because of this it 's pretty useful in things you want to heat without breaking down quickly . 
  that thin coiled up filament you can see in traditional lightbulbs is usually made of tungsten . 
  when electricity passes through it , you get heat and light . 
  `` incandescent '' simply means emitting light as a result of being heated . 
  i 'm swedish , when it comes to alcohol i ca n't afford to be picky . 
  literally . 
  yes , i believe that 's the guy i learned of . 
  that does indeed sound familiar . 
  i believe that 's the guy i learned of . 
  with airplanes ? 
  the first flight in sweden was by a frenchman by the name of [ georges legagneux ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/georges_legagneux ) . 
  the first controlled flight was by ~ ~ some german i forget the name of ~ ~ [ * otto lilienthal * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/otto_lilienthal ) in berlin i believe . 
  the first * self-propelled * flight was the wright brothers , yes . 
  the one i can afford that does n't taste like water . 
  i like beer but i 'm horrible at distinguishing them and not very picky . 
  if it 's brown and fizzy and makes me dizzy it 's usually good enough . 
  not even from chemistry or physics class ? 
  it is a pretty notable element . 
  or when debating the importance of the advancement from incandescent to solid-state electroluminescent lightbulb technology ? 
  danes winning on our home turf ? 
  preposterous . 
  it never happened , just like [ world cup ' 58 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/conspiracy_58 ) . 
  lingonberry , moped , ombudsman , smorgasbord , and tungsten ? 
  the king himself is n't actually crowned , the last swedish king to be crowned was oscar ii in 1873 . 
  but there are only 16 crowns in there to my knowledge , it 's not * that * much . 
  nine comes from the fact that our national emblem is the three crowns . 
  four comes from crowned lions , which traces back to the 13th century coa of the [ house of bj\u00e4lbo ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/coa_family_sv_magnus_ladul%c3%a5s.svg/440px-coa_family_sv_magnus_ladul%c3%a5s.svg.png ) . 
  one is a decorative crowning of the collar of the order of the seraphim . 
  and the remaining two are typical heraldic crownings which you put on royal coas ; one for the escutcheon , one for the mantle . 
  had the coa been for regular nobility those would 've been helmets instead . 
  denmark has a similar amount on theirs . 
  they have six crowned leopards ( / striding lions ) , our three crown emblem , a bunch of small ones on the collars of the orders and a heraldic one to top the mantle . 
  if it 's norway it 'd probably be rakfisk instead , surstr\u00f6mming 's ours . 
  we 're not bipartisan , so our partisanship is n't just left v. right . 
  do n't see much influence of foreign figures on any level really , certainly not locally . 
  but i still do n't really understand what you mean , i 'm probably dumb . 
  what do you mean ? 
  do n't politics always affect everyday issues ? 
  public transport funding , petrol tax etc. 
  will for example affect how i get to work . 
  can i only afford to walk , can i maybe take a bus or is driving the most efficient ? 
  the different parties have different ideas on how individualist or collectivist society should be , so of course it affects everyday life . 
  ok , thanks . 
  i edited the original comment . 
  man i ca n't get anything right today . 
  damn your lying countrymen , i was told it worked exactly the same in finnish as swedish ... 
  thanks for the correction . 
  so it 's just a possessive and noun ? 
  i 'm basing it mostly on how i perceived them travelling in all those countries . 
  ca n't put my finger on any of it either , but i would put ( east ) germany higher . 
  my list is entirely subjective , not scientifically calculated or anything . 
  so take it with a grain of salt and feel free to form your own . 
  and i do n't know if we have a stronger historical connection to ` the baltics ' . 
  estonia , sure , but the rest i do n't know . 
  we did have estonia and half of modern-day latvia until 1710 , but not the rest of latvia or lithuania . 
  swedish pomerania was on the other hand ours from gustavus adolphus until 1815 . 
  and while it did n't cover anywhere near all of east germany , it was still a small foothold . 
  more so than we ever had in lithuania . 
  but yeah , i was basing it mostly on personal experiences not anything concrete . 
  ca n't you say is\u00e4nis\u00e4 or something like that and such ? 
  it was to remove any kind of class system or such left . 
  the reason they did n't remove it entirely is because giving medals to foreigners can be diplomatically beneficial and having a royals without them makes the seem less important , which again affects diplomacy . 
  so it leaves the swedish society without the class divide they may bring , but keeps up the charade for foreigners not part of it . 
  kind of . 
  i was under the impression you hopped in and out a bit but fought with the coalition most years . 
  except around ~ 1705-10 when you had some internal conflicts between pro-sweden and anti-sweden , where pro-swedes helped us . 
  thanks for the correction . 
  damn russians , just warmongering and stealing land from others . 
  flooding into another country with their army like a deluge ... who would do such a thing ? 
  tbf a large reason we lost the great northern war was because pretty much everyone ganged up on us , not just the russians . 
  there were russians , the danes and norwegians , the prussians , the saxons , you guys ( for the most part , except for that civil war you guys had when half liked us ) ... * everyone * but the ottomans . 
  russia was just the main driving force behind it and the ones to steal most land . 
   they love to take someone land russia pretty much * needed * to take land , and to an extent still do . 
  their geography was , and is , terrible for defense . 
  so by conquering land they created buffer zones that could slow down any enemies and protect the heartland . 
  same reason they needed to expand east , though they may have overdone it a bit by going all the way to alaska ... 
   bastard russians they took plenty of our lithuania bastard russians took our entire empire from us . 
  they took our provinces in estonia and livonia . 
  and then in 1809 , they took half our freaking country . 
  damn russians . 
   he gave part of finland ? 
  never heard of that . 
  yeah , he gave a small part in the east ( kexholm ) . 
  we got it back 20 years later and kept it for 100 years before the russians took it again when they ended our `` era of a great power '' in 1721 . 
  but there were several reasons sigismund was n't popular here . 
  his catholicism was probably the most significant . 
  the polish-swedish union was a great idea , closest thing anyone has ever gotten to succeeding in creating mare nostrum of the north . 
  the issue was sigismund . 
  he gave away part of finland to the russians in a peace treaty for a war they started , you just ca n't do that . 
  finland was ours , muscovy was evil . 
  also he was catholic . 
  and his claim to the swedish throne was through the house of vasa . 
  a house founded by gustav i , the very king to bring protestantism to sweden ... 
  yeah , but absolutely nothing came of that . 
  you guys made sure of that . 
  if we 're looking at things that did n't last , [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93swedish_union ) was much more influential than that agreement . 
  all three of us were in a union !, 
  in the 17th century we wanted to make the baltic sea our mare nostrum and estonia and half of latvia was `` ours '' , but other than that sweden has n't really cared too much about the baltic .
