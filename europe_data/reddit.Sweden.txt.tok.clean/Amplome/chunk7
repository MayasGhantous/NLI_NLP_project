  lithuania has n't been much affected by us , at least not to my knowledge . 
  we had more land in modern day poland ( swedish pomerania ) than we ever did in lithuania . 
  but i think the history does play in . 
  now people have moved around and i suppose the culture has `` evened out '' everywhere in poland , but the northern parts that historically was hanseatic and under such influence did feel a little more culturally similar to us . 
  but i do n't know . 
  that list was n't scientifically based at all , just my gut feeling . 
  hey now , i did n't say i preferred either . 
  i just said i felt germany was more similar culturally . 
  there 's nothing bad about being culturally dissimilar . 
  estonia is very nice . 
  i was just basing it on my personal overall impressions from travelling , and i have n't travelled everywhere in neither country . 
  i 've been to a few places in poland , but to me it 's a bit tricky , i 've had very different experiences in poland . 
  if i 'd just been to the places i 've been to in the north you 'd probably come in third or maybe even second , but going more into the country it felt very different . 
  i do n't really know why . 
  it just felt more foreign than the other countries . 
  interesting , is it somewhat dialectal or just subjective ? 
  when i studied danish our teacher ( who was danish ) told us it 'd sound very svansk if we kept using it as we would in swedish and it was only to be used for specifying . 
  i feel lied to ... :( but that 's good to know . 
  thanks !, 
  i 'm basing it on my ( a swede 's ) personal experiences from travelling in both countries ... 
  there are several things , and there are things i ca n't really put my finger on why , but in my experience i 'd definitely say it is more culturally similar . 
  and language is a huge part of culture , but no , i do n't speak a lick of german . 
  i used english in both countries . 
  not really western european i suppose . 
  but , anyway , from the places i 've visited travelling i 'd say for me it 'd be : 1 . 
  ( east ) germany 2 . 
  estonia 3 . 
  czech republic 5 . 
  lithuania, 
  yeah i know , that 's what i meant by making the same constructs as we do . 
  but is n't * bestefar/bestemor * pretty widespread ? 
  it 's what my norwegian friends use 90 % of the time . 
  i 've been told chinese , hindi and thai do . 
  have n't heard of any other where you have to specify . 
  in danish , norwegian , icelandic ~ ~ and finnish ~ ~ you can make the same type of constructs we do , but the more ambiguous words seem to be more common in my experience . 
  but feel free to correct me if i 'm wrong . 
  ^ ( edit : apparently not finnish ), 
  it 's not a very common dish here . 
  the most eaten ones are probably the readymade ones for microwave heating . 
  i have n't seen much gun hatred on this sub , they just are n't glorified as in some other places . 
  guns are treated pretty indifferently . 
  but from what i 've seen most do respect legitimate purposes , like hunting . 
  i would n't call it a `` swedish custom '' . 
  it depends on the setting and who and how many you 're with i suppose . 
  to just disappear when your out with a few friends is just bad manners and rude . 
  and leaving the people you came with wondering where you went is n't seen as very nice either . 
  swedish culture is in general very mindful of others integrity and not interrupting others , so if someone 's busy you may just give a quick wave and a quiet ^ `` bye . '', 
  do n't know many that 'd just up and leave without saying bye , but to not go out of your way to let everyone know you 're leaving , sure . 
  if people are n't busy you say bye , it 's all about not interrupting people . 
  do n't go looking for confirmation bias and think someone is dishonest because it does n't fit your narrative . 
  i can assure you my reply was also honest and not `` self-censoring '' in any way . 
  there are 740 million europeans , all with different values and ideas , so of course some may resent them . 
  and the attitudes also vary immensely across europe , it 's probably not gon na be the same in sweden as romania . 
  hell , it 's not gon na be the same in different parts of sweden . 
  i too have noticed some animosity towards the uk here on reddit , much more so than real life . 
  honestly i think the people most resentful of the uk leaving are britons who were against it . 
  there are also several who are * less * resentful towards them for actually leaving hoping for a stronger eu . 
  resent them ? 
  many think it was a dumb choice , but it was theirs to make . 
  i agree traditional language learning is n't optimal , at least it is n't for me neither . 
  it 's taught using too much translation and is too focused on learning the metalanguage . 
  it 's both unnecessary and makes it difficult to gain any kind of fluency . 
  best way i know is the `` enhanced baby-method '' : kickstart with * basic * grammar , phonetics and vocabulary ; then have exposure , exposure , exposure with trial and error , like a baby learning their first language ; * then * , when you have a decent fluency , move to more advanced grammar . 
  i do n't even know which the five declensions are ... ? 
  i 'm pretty sure i 've been told there are six , but it 's not something you 'd ever think about as a native/high fluency speaker . 
  it 's just bad to wire your brain to think of nouns as such , you 'll get a worse fluency and have a much more difficult time developing a `` feeling '' for it . 
  hello to you too , what am i looking at ? 
  english is alongside swedish and maths a `` core subject '' through school you must pass to be allowed to graduate . 
  according to the last report i saw , i think it was about 93 % who knew conversational english here but i may be a few percent off . 
  no matter what the vast majority can hold a conversation in english . 
  i personally do n't know anyone who ca n't . 
  it also kind of lives on on virtually all [ lifebuoys ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/trygg-hansa_life_buoy.jpg/1024px-trygg-hansa_life_buoy.jpg ) in sweden . 
  hahaha , what a bunch of weirdos ... ^ ( i definitely did n't eat that myself when i was younger , and specifically ask for it at ikea or anything . 
  not at all . ), 
  ^ ^ ^ please ^ ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ ^ deport ^ ^ ^ me .

  i realized i missed saying that you have to finish by baking it a bit more after adding the breadcrumbs/seasoning . 
  the time required for baking depends on size of potatoes and heat of the oven , but you want to bake for about 4/5 of the time required before adding the breadcrumbs and 1/5 after . 
  but it 's not an exact science , you just cook until they 're done . 
  and a tip for easy slicing of the potatoes is to put them in a large wooden spoon you do n't care too much about . 
  that way you can make even cuts and not risk going to all the way through . 
  or placing it off the side of a cutting board or something . 
  [ this one ] ( https://i.imgur.com/gacknzy.jpg ) 's also pretty bad , cooked the [ same way ] ( http://zoomyummy.com/2011/10/14/scalloped-hasselback-potatoes/ ) as yours . 
  i saw one that was even worse a few months ago , but i ca n't find the link . 
  i just do n't understand it . 
  the recipe can vary a bit but generally it 's just : - cut many thin slices in peeled potatoes , but not the whole way through . 
  leaving them connected at the bottom . 
  - brush them with butter - bake in the oven . 
  - sprinkle on some breadcrumbs and salt . 
  - finish by baking it a little more . 
  you season them with some salt and maybe pepper , and some like to add a * little * bit of cheese as garnish with the breadcrumbs . 
  but less is more . 
  they should just be baked potatoes with many thin slices , looking something like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/5qo3hwq.jpg ) . 
  i do n't know what [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3sdwkrx.jpg ) , [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/y9a1sjz.jpg ) and [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gacknzy.jpg ) is , but it sure is n't something i 'd call hasselback . 
  and why anyone would call things like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/genaitr.jpg ) hasselback is beyond me . 
  ^ ( * edit : fixed instructions * ), 
  i saw some pictures of `` hasselback potatoes '' people had made for thanksgiving . 
  they were drowning in cheese and some had even made them into a gratin . 
  it was horrific .
