it should , and definitely is . 
  but it 's a different sort of education , according to my understanding . 
  it 's also really good for your morale , a good experience and it 's really thankful to have in the future . 
  it is my understanding that most people who 've done military service have had at least some use for it . 
  maybe practical things , but mostly strategical and social things , like working in groups , working under pressure and picking a good strategy for things . 
  i 'm born in 1999 so i 'll be affected by this decision . 
  tbh , i do n't mind . 
  i 'll probably serve if i get the chance . 
  they are actually banned on all airlines and in some countries ( if i 'm not mistaken ) for being `` toxic '' . 
  to be honest , i would love someone to offer boris johnson a lesson on basic logic and decency . 
  this pretty much goes for all of the nordic countries . 
  that is true , but he forgot to mention the fact that we 're basically one of the non-nato-countries which acts the most like a nato-country . 
  for example , [ we sat on the nato top table during the summit in warsaw . 
  ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-nato-summit-nordics-iduskcn0zo1eo ) russia deems us to be nato-ish enough to invite us , together with nato representatives from the baltic states and poland , to [ a meeting in september , aiming to `` improve inflamed relations between the countries . 
  '' ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/russia_invites_nato_countries__and_finland_and_sweden__to_moscow_talks/9065727 ) looking at [ this pdf , ] ( http://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/pdf_2016_06/20160615_1606-factsheet_exercises_en.pdf ) we can see that sweden participated in at least 4 nato-drills this year , some of which were major operations . 
  and not to forget , [ the swedish parliament voted yes to memorandum of understanding with nato , ] ( http://www.riksdagen.se/en/news/2016/maj/27/yes-to-memorandum-of-understanding-with-nato-on-host-nation-support-ufou4/ ) meaning we may host nato-drills . 
  [ here 's a bit more about the sweden-nato relations . 
  ] ( http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_52535.htm ), 
  to add to this ; people generally start their working life later today than previously . 
  more and more people are pursuing an university degree to use in the pursuance of a certain career . 
  obvisously that will cut some years of the `` working ladder '' . 
  when people start working later , they may have to finish later . 
  plus ; we start our professional careers later . 
  from my understanding , most people today get their first , `` real '' job in their late 20 's to early 30 's . 
  this is mostly due to us getting an university degree , but also that we travel more when we 're young ( mostly due to higher living standards and that travel is cheaper today ) . 
  previously , people got their first , `` real '' job in their early to mid 20 's . 
  the fact that we start our working lifes later today is n't necessarily a bad thing , just a reflection on the fact that more peolple educate themselves and are able to do `` more '' things while their young . 
  when this is the case , the pension system must adapt to it . 
  we 're not supposed to work during a longer part of our life than before , but the same amount of years . 
  the only difference is that we start later , and thus have to end later . 
  at least that 's my view on things . 
  [ to all the civ players out there !,

  i believe there was a study about tourism in stockholm which showed that most tourists were n't first time visitors , and first time visitors usually returned . 
  stockholm may be , as you say , an underrated city which people tend to love when they actually give it a chance and visit . 
  stockholm resident here ; it 's an amazing place to live in during the summer and spring , especially when you see the cherry trees start blossoming in kungstr\u00e4dg\u00e5rden . 
  it 's great to go into the city a summer evening with your friends to spend it at some outdoor seating , while enjoying the , not too hot , heat . 
  you can also spend the evening watching an outdoor theatre , tax financed and free to watch ( there are some shows in english ) . 
  that being said ; it sucks to live here during the winter . 
  if there 's snow , it often starts to melt to form plain slush , which is dirty and wet . 
  if we get a `` real winter '' , it will often be really cold and the snow will whip your face . 
  also , the buses are n't on time and our already very poor infrastructure ( roads and high ways in this case , they 're build for the 70 's with few lanes and are n't suited for the amounts of cars we have today , and if they actually build new roads ; they 're adapted for the 70 's ) is even worst . 
  you may be stuck in traffic for quite some time . 
  tl ; dr : if you want to visit stockholm , come in the summer , not in the winter . 
  i actually thought venice was an awesome and beautiful place , despite it being very crowded at times . 
  i 'm surprised to hear this , since berlin is my favorite city to visit . 
  i try to go there every year . 
   i hope she gets back somehow . 
  she should certainly have a bright future in the country imo . 
  i believe she will . 
  `` scandals '' like these ( i.e. 
  nothing major ) are n't career ruiners here . 
  she will probably keep her place in the parliament . 
  i bet that she 'll be back in a future ( s ) government , because of her young age . 
  i can certainly see her have a top position in 10 years or so . 
  this is what 's sad about our political system . 
  aida is a bright , young woman who actually opposed identity politics etc. , and she resigns immediately after driving drunk ( before it was even known to the public ) . 
  kaplan , a radical islamist , who said some very stupid , questionable things even before he became a minister , fights for weeks to stay ( and is defended ) before he resigns after being exposed hanging out with islamist extremists , right wing extremists and comparing israel to nazi germany . 
  as a swede i can say that she was , in my opinion , a very important person in our government . 
  she was one of the few people who opposed the `` establishment '' , mainly by saying that she did n't like identity politics and that it could be devestating for the left . 
  but ... but ... rule britannia ? 
  whilst we 're on the subject , norway ; could you please give us [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bh858ms.jpg ) piece of land ? 
  it really ruins the aesthetics of the map . 
  [ we 'll ... we 'll make it up to you by not making fun of you all of the time .

  erdogan is cheating on nato with putin . 
  they 're just a big joke of a party . 
  one of their most `` genius moves '' was to burn 100k in swedish crowns ( our currency ) to protest the supposed pay gap . 
  edit : here 's a video of said event : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsiriyhuc7y unfortunately there 's no english subtitles . 
  fun fact ; unemployment was forbidden in ddr . 
  they also had the second biggest childcare sector per capita , with only sweden beating them , if i remember correctly . 
  we 're all biased , since we 're humans with opinions and agendas . 
  this comment itself includes opinions and biases . 
  huh , it almost seems like all media is biased . 
  who would 've thought ? 
  and this is why i think people are stupid . 
  those who complain why a certain , bad hashtag is trending are often the reason to why it 's trending . 
  that 's probably why iceland is number one ... 
  the population of the eu is 500 million and the population of europe ( the continent ) is 730 + million , so it 's even higher than what you said . 
  just wanted to point that out . 
   edit : why the dislikes ? 
  these are just fact . 
  i believe that facts are important when we 're going to have a discussion . 
  in this case , the comment above mine stated that the population of europe was more than half of it 's real size . 
  the thing is that it definitely seems to be more because of the media coverage ( and media hype to some extent ) . 
  that , plus many attacks ( not all though ) are a part of isis ' global terror campaign , which is something we 're not used to and seems scary to us . 
  i also believe that civilians are a bigger target now , which makes it more scary to us . 
  in the 1980s , the targets might 've been more political ( i believe , can be wrong ) . 
  but all in all , welcome to the age of information . 
  he did n't , so it 's kind of hard to show . 
  they 're also often very well integrated in the country they live in . 
  cnn said ( paraphrazing , obviously ) : `` well one witness said it , but nothing is confirmed and it does n't have to be true . '', 
  they did n't take it as the absolute truth , but as speculation ... kinda like any reasonable human . 
  you ca n't take anything at face-value until it 's confirmed and `` all the cards are on the table '' . 
  the express ? 
  real quality source there . 
   mom and dad were devout muslims , and that means so was the kid . 
  actually , according to [ this article ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/munich-police-hunt-for-a-motive-after-iranian-german-gunman-kills-nine-in-rampage/2016/07/23/5e3058d6-5055-11e6-bf27-405106836f96_story.html ) , that was n't the case . 
   maizi\u00e8re said the use of david as a first name may suggest the killer had converted to christianity from islam . 
  but his parents said he was not a practicing member of any religion .
