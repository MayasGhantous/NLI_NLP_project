  probably deleting his history . 
  the express ? 
  really ? 
  that 's a very biased source ... 
  was he even muslim ? 
  i 'm not sure if that has been confirmed . 
  this was in the washington post :  maizi\u00e8re said the use of david as a first name may suggest the killer had converted to christianity from islam . 
  but his parents said he was not a practicing member of any religion .

  they will pretty much claim anything that puts fear into people . 
  there were reports of the guy being an ex-muslim turned christian ( thus the name david ) , but his parents demented that and said that he did n't align with any religion at all . 
  not impossible , but very uncommon . 
  jackie arkl\u00f6v is another example . 
  born in liberia , but adopted and came to sweden . 
  despite being black he turned to nazism . 
  but again , it 's very uncommon . 
  with the internet it 's easier than one think . 
  also goes to show that you ca n't really assume anything . 
  the article has been updated since i posted it . 
  therefore a new title and new information has been added on the website . 
  source ? 
  that 's a pretty bold claim . 
  there 's an illegal market for everything , unfortunately . 
  nobody have said that . 
  he was born in germany . 
  he never lived in iran . 
  you ca n't go back to a place you never lived in . 
  he did this as a revenge action towards the `` bullies '' . 
  he did n't specifically target germans . 
  he was mad at the people who bullied him , not germans . 
  7 out of the 9 people he killed were teenagers . 
  keeping that in mind as well as the fact that he was bullied and mocked in school may mean something , but nothing is confirmed . 
  it could just have been so that they were in the wrong place at the wrong time , or he was actually specifically targeting teenagers . 
  the police said it , but nothing is confirmed . 
  understood !, 
  this definitely seems like something where the perpetrator was bent on revenge and not driven by an ideology . 
  nothing confirmed though . 
  were you mentally ill as well ? 
  i 'm not the one who wrote the main post . 
  thanks for pointing it out !, 
  i 'm always concerned that some of the videos and photos which circulate during these attacks are from other incidents ( many videos and photos are real , of course ) . 
  everything for the karma , retweets and likes i guess . 
  just to clarify : the summer camp was for youths who were members of the youth party of the social democrats in norway , not children of left wing politicians ( at least not mainly ) . 
  they were basically the future of the party . 
  definitely not impossible . 
  i was afraid someone inspired by him and his manifesto would do something today . 
  praying and blindly believing is what gets us into most terror attacks these days . 
  to be honest ; is anyone really surprised ? 
  we all know russia have some shady shit going on . 
  ** sold !, 
  the * estado novo * was also very pro-colonialism . 
  they held on to their colonies ( angola and mozambique ) for such a long time ( they became independent in 1975 , among the last countries to be independent in africa ) . 
  the treatment of the indigenous people by the portuguese was very cruel and awful . 
   relations with the us are being strained over the tension of the us air force base having its power cut . 
  i really did not get why they did this . 
  do they want isis to have an `` easier time '' ? 
  there are obviously isis-sympathizers within the top rank of the turkish political class , but this is just too obvious and plain stupid . 
  if they will be granted asylum i can only see that the relationship between greece and turkey will harden . 
  i do n't know how big of a possibility they have to get asylum though . 
  i guess only time will tell . 
  swedish news reports on shots fired against protesters and exchange of fire between `` government loyalists '' and the military .

  if this is a military coup of the turkish constitutional kind , it 's not `` strange '' . 
  this has happened before ( 1980 was the latest i believe ) . 
  it 's all because turkey has a very secular constitution , which aims to keep democracy and secularism intact ( mostly due to turkey 's previous ottoman history ) . 
  in this , the military plays a central role . 
  they 're supposed to make sure that the constitution is followed . 
  if an anti-democratic , theological party or person takes power the military should seize power to make sure that democracy and secularism is intact . 
  we do n't know if that is happening now though . 
  ** edit : ** seems as if though this coup was organized by a smaller group inside the military , not by the whole military itself . 
  this sort of coup have n't happened before ( to my knowledge ) . 
  we do n't know anything yet , though . 
  hoping for the best !, 
  ** edit 2 : ** perhaps not a small group after all , but organized by the military . 
  this would make more sense , imo . 
  we do n't know anything yet though . 
  ** edit 3 : ** most of the information and sources i find seem to contradict each other , regarding who is behind this coup . 
  the whole military , or just a fraction . 
  only time will tell . 
  well , being the president and an islamic extremist in country with a constitution in which the military is supposed to defend secularism and democracy , even if it 's by organizing a military coup , is not a concept for success . 
  but to clarify ; we do n't know if this coup is by that character .
