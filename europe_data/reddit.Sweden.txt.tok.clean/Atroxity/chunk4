  we had alcohol rationing for 40 years , each person was `` only '' allowed to buy 2 litres or so of hard liquor per month . 
  up to about 10km to work and a lot of people commute by bike . 
  there are lots of [ bike paths ] ( https://www.google.se/maps/@57.7025514,11.9726102,3a,75y,42.83h,73.39t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sfnme7y0kfnlonufvey688q!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en ) in every city , at least that i 've been to , the sidewalk often have [ split bike and pedestrian lanes ] ( https://www.google.se/maps/@57.6955763,11.9871209,3a,75y,316.69h,60.85t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sisdbyhbg_wwecut5ccxpgq!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en ) . 
  where i grew up they even have them [ between the city and nearby villages ] ( https://www.google.se/maps/@56.2005782,14.7787767,3a,75y,88.11h,69.68t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sxw4t3guli-xcn6tdytrzcg!2e0!6s%2f%2fgeo1.ggpht.com%2fcbk%3fpanoid%3dxw4t3guli-xcn6tdytrzcg%26output%3dthumbnail%26cb_client%3dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3d2%26w%3d100%26h%3d80%26yaw%3d73.555176%26pitch%3d0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en ) . 
  in big cities it can get a bit confusing due to how crowded some streets are though , and the city i live in right now is fairly hilly , so taking the tram or bus is probably more common , but even here there 's lots of bikes around . 
  if you go to any smaller university city [ there 's bikes everywhere ] ( https://www.google.se/maps/@55.7031026,13.1926344,3a,75y,195.85h,68.87t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1snplukhnailkn469psrd_aa!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en ) , since very few students can afford a car and the distances are never that large . 
  there 's obviously less cyclists during the winter , but the roads are usually kept in decent condition , so some actually use their bikes all winter too . 
  i 've found the svt news report to be fairly good at staying `` neutral '' for a news source . 
  i know the party affiliation of the journalists are very skewed , but they do a good job of not showing that in their news reporting imo . 
  if there 's any sort of bias it 's very minor , and usually only towards the government , which is understandable , they are the ones paying them after all . 
  they obviously lack expertise in a lot of areas , but it 's always going to be like that , they ca n't afford to hire in `` experts '' to report on every single thing , usually they just take the info they have and read it back at you , maybe slightly altered , which is where the misinformation enters , but again that 's so minor i ca n't see how you see it as a big problem . 
  all in all i think they 're objective enough for a news source , which you never expect to be completely neutral , that 's what i got taught in school anyway , and i assume most people have , always check multiple sources . 
  `` d\u00f6dsknark '' just means death narcotics . 
  and / r/sweden usually use it sarcastically when talking about cannabis , i think it came about because of how media , the government and most of the swedish people view the drug . 
   i do n't think you should believe that most westerns hate russia . 
  generally people are fairly oke with russia , but do feel that putin is being too aggressive against nations who do n't deserve it . 
  at least , that is western europe , eastern europe might feel different of course . 
  while maybe not exactly western europe , we 're not part of eastern europe either . 
  people here are fairly friendly towards russians , as much as any other foreigners anyway . 
  but if thinking of russia as a single entity , we really do not like them . 
  they are * the * enemy , and has been for hundreds of years , doubt that 's going to change any time soon . 
  i ca n't explain exactly why that is either , might be any number of old wars we 've fought or maybe soviet actions against our finnish neighbour , but i think it 's just ingrained in our culture , and has been for a long time . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_wars_between_russia_and_sweden russia was directly responsible for the fall of the swedish empire in the 18th century . 
  first they took our baltic possessions ( estonia , half of latvia , and the area around what is now st petersburg ) in [ the great northern war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_northern_war ) , and then they took the entire eastern part of our country ( aka finland ) in [ the finnish war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_war ) . 
  but both of these wars were completely legitimate for the time ( i think ) , and it 's not something russia should feel particularly bad about nowadays , so much has changed since then . 
  especially the great northern war was mostly in response to previous swedish aggressions anyway . 
  sweden caused just as much trouble for russia as russia did to sweden though , so i would say we are even on that part of our history . 
  aside from you obviously winning , that 's not fair  more relevant to this discussion is the [ submarine that ran aground just 10km outside of one of sweden 's largest naval bases during the 80s ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_submarine_s-363 ) . 
  but again , aside from being seriously close to provoke a war , it was n't exactly `` evil '' or anything like that , just diplomatically awful . 
  there was another event just a little while ago , were people claimed to have spotted a submarine or something like that , and it was automatically assumed to be russian . 
  but we never got any confirmation of that . 
  swedes generally do n't like russia though , but that has a lot to do with our close relationship with finland and the way they have been treated by russia in the past . 
  as well as our somewhat close relationship with the us during the cold war , with the soviets right on our doorstep , that does n't exactly breed happy feelings . 
  we stay indoors . 
  and we have properly insulated and heated houses so it 's always 20-24 inside . 
  summers are nice ( bearable anyway ) even on iceland , so we spend all of the summer outside , then lock ourselves in during the winter . 
  and if we for some reason really need to go outside we put on plenty of clothes , like , a lot . 
  there might be direct flights to santorini . 
  there are from sweden anyway , but i guess going on vacation to greece is n't as common in spain . 
   i dont know how anyone that was born in santorini would ever want to leave that place for any reason . 
  because the insane amount of tourists maybe . 
  it 's is also not the only town in that style , most of the island towns look like that , santorini is just on the top because of the crazy view . 
  ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/germanic_paganism https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/midgard#etymology for starters , the norse were n't a thing until almost 1000 years after caesar , so yeah ... 
  but anyway , this is just modern names anyway , it does n't matter what they called it back then . 
  most likely they did n't call it anything , it was just the way they believed the world was . 
  germanic mythology encompasses all * germanic * mythology , including norse and angle saxon , since they are all very similar . 
  in this case i specifically meant the more original version , which both norse and other germanic beliefs originated from . 
  norse is just the most famous because there 's the most texts left from that , and they were also the last to convert to christianity . 
  but the word middle-earth specifically comes from anglo-saxon texts , not the norse . 
  anglo-saxons were also the primary thing tolkien studied , it was his thing , the language of rohan is for example almost an exact copy of old anglo-saxon . 
  as the wiki says :  the word is present in old english epic and poetry as middangeard ; later transformed to middell\u00e6rd or mittelerde ( `` middle-earth '' ) in middle english literature . 
  it never became middle - * earth * in norse , that was an english thing . 
  it 's still midg\u00e5rd in scandinavian languages btw , not midjord , or whatever the equivalent would be . 
   the cultural context from which tolkien draws his pictures is much older . 
  no it 's not , as i said , he was primarily focused on anglo-saxon linguistics , or something like that , and that 's several hundred years after caesar . 
  not that this is relevant , just wanted to point it out . 
  germanic * mythology , the middle-earth version came specifically through the anglo-saxons , not the norse , it 's the same thing though . 
  eh , we 're used to getting stabbed by now . 
  estonia likes [ dill ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dill ) . 
  at least that 's my experience visiting there . 
  my hometown has a ferry going to lithuania , never been there though . 
  always see lithuanian trucks driving around . 
  latvia looks like an interesting country , it has a lot of coastline , which is always nice . 
  know almost nothing about it . 
  you can come back home if you want < 3, 
  if curse = swearwords . 
  translated : first three are variants of devil or satan , the last one means hell . 
  these are very common , and not very `` shocking '' , could be used around almost anyone just as an emphasis . 
  overuse might not be very appropriate around for example children ( teaching them bad habits ) , but it 's not the end of the world either . 
  if you want to use more powerful words , at least with the younger generations : * kuk * , * fitta * . 
  translated : cock , cunt . 
  those are still pretty `` bad '' words , and are usually saved for when you really need something heavier , around friends they might be commonly used though . 
  i think using them as swearwords , a bit like their english counterparts , is a fairly new phenomena , my parents think it 's weird for example . 
  but they also do n't like it at all , which i guess why it 's used , it 's till taboo in most circles , unlike older swearwords . 
  for insults there 's all kinds of more or less imaginative ones . 
  only common one i can think of right now is * hora * for girls , means whore and is not very flattering . 
  generally we completely lack the imagination of more southern countries when it comes to insults , so even if i could remember some fun ones you guys could probably easily top them . 
  -- funfactsortof : kuk and fitta are some of the oldest words for genitals in the swedish language , dating back to old norse or even older . 
  but they only got added to swedish dictionaries like 40 years ago , since they where apparently seen as too inappropriate for a few hundred years . 
  still survived in the language though . 
  i dunno , russia is n't very `` samba '' either . 
  but i see your point . 
  and for any swedes around here , is this a thing here as well ? 
  have i just missed it completely ? 
  [ this sort of stuff ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chhlhgnpcsa ) overall a lot of music is popular at the moment , so i feel it 's pretty balanced . 
  but that type of electronic dance music or whatever it 's called and variants of it is definitely very popular with a majority of people . 
  i was like , wow , hungarian is actually sort of similar to swedish ( in this case ) , skola = school and stol = chair ... but yeah , no . 
  table , really ? 
  swedish folklore has tons of different creatures and it varies a lot from region to region what they do or even look like . 
  but i 'm just going to talk about the things i remember hearing when i grew up . 
  we have lots of large ( sometimes huge ) boulders lying around the countryside , in reality left by the ice during the last ice age . 
  but i got taught that those boulders were leftovers from when we still had giants living here , and they used to throw them around , either for fun or as fighting . 
  and if you 're out in the morning and you see mist over the fields , that 's elves dancing . 
  i think it 's bad luck to disturb them , or something like that . 
  but either way , saying that `` the elves are dancing on the fields '' , means there 's mist on the fields . 
  in a similar vein , if you hear thunder , that 's thor riding his wagon/cart/chariot / whatever across the sky . 
  then we have guardians of the forest , sort of , but evil , usually appear as a naked woman and will try to lure any man away into the forest , and presumably do evil things to them . 
  they 're called `` skogsr\u00e5 '' , and you know for sure they are one if they turn their back on you and instead of a human back it 's hollow and wooden , like an old tree . 
  that always freaked me out as a kid . 
  my grandmother always told me to watch out for old tree stumps in case they were * skogsr\u00e5n * with their back turned , they might take me away , never to be seen again .
