oh , yeah that criclejerk . 
  it 's certainly way worse . 
  man , i recognizance so many of the submitters and moderators . 
  more ? 
  is that possible ? 
  i remember one point of the investigation being dropped for all of eleven days . 
  that was weeks before he left though . 
  remember how he was wanted for a second interview scheduled for the day after he left , and how his lawyer was informed a week before but claimed to be unable to get hold of him ? 
   they 're not grand conclusions . 
  the implications are quite obvious by now and widely corroborated by a myriad of similar attitudes being revealed/leaked on weekly basis . 
  the * implications * are obvious ? 
  well , i would have to agree . 
  there 's a whole lot of implications being implied , but very few of them are based in facts . 
  still , examples of the evidence that has you so convinced would be nice . 
   it 's sad you view the bias on my end instead of the government . 
  i make no difference . 
  i call bias wherever i see it . 
   the effort to catch him , discredit him or just shut him up at any costs and go after any spec of dirt in his background is bias . 
  except you do n't know that that is happening , but you think you do because of actual bias . 
  now , do n't get me wrong , there certainly have been attempts at shutting wikileaks down , but this really does n't seem like one of those . 
  wait , you 've drawn grand and unlikely conclusions based on very little information indeed , and you 're accusing others of being biased ? 
  yes , as in this case . 
  i saw it more as an opinion of how it should be treated . 
  if there is a case to attach it to as an aggravating circumstance , then that would make a lot of sense . 
  i do n't see how the uk could ask anyone else to pay for actions they have taken themselves . 
  it 's not like the prosecutor ordered there to be a tens of police officers outside the embassy at any one time . 
  he was under house arrest for quite some time actually . 
  as i wrote below . 
   the bail is the carrot to the prosecutors whip . 
  it 's not a get-out-of-jail fee . 
  no , i was just wondering . 
  i do n't think i 've said anything about his personality . 
  edit : btw , it has started . 
  what 's the issue ? 
  the bail is the carrot to the prosecutors whip . 
  it 's not a get-out-of-jail fee . 
  that would be pre-trial detention then ? 
  so then they can either use the current system , which you objected to in your initial post , or simply accept that suspects run away . 
  i 'm still waiting for an alternative . 
   but if the initial charges are dropped , then does this not imply that he was right in trying to escape ? 
  i 'm not sure if this is a hypothetical situation , or if you 're referring to the eleven days during which one of the points of the investigation was dropped , to then be reinstated . 
  in the latter case , i do n't see how a normal function of the legal system would make it right to escape . 
  especially since it was two years earlier and in a different country and judiciary . 
   there 's an easy solution to the problem you describe : you can always punish breaking bail as an aggravating circumstance , still part of the initial charge . 
  there is no charge in the uk to attach it to though . 
  you 're usually reimbursed , but it 's impossible to give back time . 
  no one has said that the system is perfect . 
  considering this , what would you have the legal system do ? 
  same cross , different colours and nicks . 
  i ca n't tell why fibs3n wants him locked up , but he/she never mentioned wikileaks . 
  who 's talking about his work with wikileaks ? 
  it 's dangerous to mix up the person and the organization . 
  not that i 'm saying that that 's not what it essentially is , but if breaking bail is not punished , how do you suggest we keep people from simply running of before the trial can take place ? 
  the alternative , pre-trial detention , does not seem to be very popular . 
  leaking the ots was actually how i first came into contact with wikileaks . 
  back then assange was just the founder , and his persona had n't taken over completely . 
  there was so much potential . 
  i guess there still is , it 's just harder to see it now . 
   he may be narcissistic but the `` charges '' that are against him are pretty much made up , that 's up to the court to decide though , not the internet-jury . 
   the uk government and fbi have text messages from the girl that assange allegedly `` raped '' saying she wasnt pressing charges and that it was infact consensual . 
  the uk and the us ? 
  you 're aware that the case is in sweden , right ? 
  what use would the uk and the us have of such evidence ? 
  i also think you 've misunderstood something . 
  no one is claiming that any of them pressed charges . 
  what she describes would be rape , and that 's all that matters . 
  it 's hard to arrest someone when they 're on the run . 
   that 's not what i said , what i said was those who are are taken care of . 
  it 's pretty much what you said though . 
   because danes are not homeless . 
  homelessness is usually the result of mental problems or drug abuse . 
  people are choosing to withdraw from society . 
  the presence of security nets does not mean that there are n't actually homeless people . 
   talk to them and take them to socialen . 
  again , are you sure that that 's what 's going on , or are you just guessing ? 
  it 's certainly not part of the reporting . 
  you are aware that we 're discussing a targeted operation here , right ? 
   it does n't say that they 're targeting specific groups either . 
  ye , they do . 
  that 's the whole point . 
  that 's why i wrote what i wrote . 
  even this article alludes to it without saying it . 
  consider the introduction , for example :  police in copenhagen are ** focusing this summer on driving away beggars ** from the city 's parks and streets . 
  and ** the goal is to send them to countries like sweden ** , one politician said . 
  are you suggesting they 're hoping to send homeless danish citizens to sweden ? 
  with our housing market , they 'd sure be homeless upon arrival , even if they were n't before . 
   because the few danes who are homeless are n't the problem . 
  the problem is the 200-500 homeless who are n't danish citizens . 
  all kinds of homelessness is generally a problem . 
  i 'm interested to know why the non-danish ( but eu ) citizens are more of a problem . 
  where they were born does n't really matter , now does it ? 
   that 's the most obvious thing ever . 
  if you 're a danish citizen they ca n't exactly deport you . 
  what are they supposed to do with poor foreigners who break laws ? 
  put them in jail or deport them . 
  that 's not the strange part . 
  the strange part is the expressed focus on one group of of criminals committing a certain crime . 
   because danes are not homeless . 
  there are plenty and plenty of social security nets to prevent poverty and homelessness . 
  so there are no homeless danes ?
