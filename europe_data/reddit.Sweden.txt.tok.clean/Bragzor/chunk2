  we have social nets too , yet i see homeless people every day . 
  again , the articles i 've read have not said anything about the homeless danes being rounded up and placed in some welfare program . 
  they 've simply stated that they are focusing on foreigners . 
   there are far far more foreigners going to denmark who are homeless or lack funds to live there . 
  i 'm sure that 's true , but i really ca n't see how that 's relevant to the discussion . 
  no one 's said that the they are fewer , or that they should allowed to break the law . 
   that does n't matter when you break laws . 
  but apparently your nationality does . 
   they are , but they make a difference between citizens and non-citizens . 
  if they find beggers who are danish citizens , they recieve welfare . 
  if they find one who is n't a danish citizen , they 're deported . 
  do you know that this is what 's happening , or are you just assuming ? 
  because that is not what i 've been reading . 
  there does n't seem to be some big operation to get all homeless danes on welfare and all foreigners deported . 
  are they even there illegally ? 
  what does this have to do with welfare ? 
  no one suggested that they should give welfare to the foreigners ( except maybe the eu ) . 
  all i 'm saying is that if they 're going to go after the homeless and beggars ( no problem there ) , then you should go after all of them , not just some of them . 
  that 's what i said in my post , but in other sources , they made it clear that they are primarily targeting foreigners ( but eu citizens ) . 
  there must be homeless danes too , would n't you say ? 
  there 's obviously nothing wrong with enforcing their laws . 
  if begging is against the law , then it 's against the law . 
  seems a bit strange to only target a specific groups though . 
  even stranger to wish them on us . 
   most of what is in my own source ? 
  cite like i did , so i know what you mean , because frankly , i do n't . 
  i was referring to bold parts in these sentences :  ** the investigation into rape was dropped by the first ** ( second counting the temp ) , yes , but not the other ones . 
  ** and it was only dropped for a few days ** before the decision was successfully appealed by the women 's counsel ( who is not their lawyer ) . 
  assange says :  on 20 august 2010 , swedish police opened a ` preliminary investigation ' against me . 
  the next day , the more serious allegation was dropped , but after an intervention police authorities reopened the closed preliminary criminal investigation against me on 1 september 2010 . 
  august 21st - september 1st is eleven days , which i called `` a few '' . 
   which other ones ? 
  the other investigations , not the other prosecutors . 
  i refer to the previous citation again :  the more serious allegation was dropped that was the allegation of rape . 
  the remaining allegation , which would eventually become the three accusations besides rape that were listed in the extradition request , but which at the time was just molestation . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.aklagare.se/media/assangearendet/kronologi-i-assangearendet/ ) the warrant was just for the rape because the other accusations were not serious enough to warrant it , but a warrant for an arrest is not the same thing as an investigation . 
  the case , as it were , was not dropped . 
   so `` the time line '' is a source to what in your post how ? 
  should i guess myself ? 
  the time between the dropping of the investigation into rape , and the time at which it was reopened , of course . 
   that 's just plain bullshit , claes bergstr\u00f6m is a full blown lawyer he is , but he is not * their * lawyer in the case . 
  he 's their * m\u00e5ls\u00e4gandebitr\u00e4de * , which means he gives them legal counsel and help them with administrative tasks outside of court . 
  it was just a parenthesis anyway . 
   note that his partner thomas bodstr\u00f6m was minister of justice from 2000-2006 and at the time was the chairman of the reiksdag on judicial issues . 
  the relevance of which is ? 
   ... to call him politically inactive is pretty much disinformation . 
  he at no point left the party it 's factually correct . 
  if that 's disinformation in your world , then there 's little i could to to convince you otherwise . 
  as for leaving the party , i already addressed that . 
  the social democratic party has 105,626 members . 
  they are not all politicians . 
   how the fuck do you propagate the bullcrap and let me sort it out ? 
  gish gallop [ 4 ] technique , i guess . 
  you do n't find it at all ironic that you 're accusing me of that in a 51-lined response full of irrelevant sidesteps ( such as this and the history of bodstr\u00f6m 's co-worker ) and insults , to my one-line post ? 
  you can call it `` bullcrap '' all you want , that does n't make it any less true . 
   that uncommented `` membership '' link to the swedish social democratic party , which contains no information on the topic definitly [ sic ] falls into that category . 
  the number i just used for the number of members in the social democratic party was taken from that very site . 
  check the box to the right , and stop blaming me for your lazy investigation . 
   do n't sell what you obviously do n't have , how cheeky . 
  a very unnecessary albeit deliciously ironic comment . 
   have you ever heard of a country severing diplomatic ties with another to get someone wanted for questioning for a sex crime in another country ? 
  i certainly never have , and that includes the uk , so what 's your point . 
   even the fact they threatened to do it gives away the powers lurking in the shadows . 
  if what jooke said is true , then they did n't even do this . 
  most of it is in your own source , like the time line . 
  [ membership ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_social_democratic_party ) . 
  what else do you want to know ? 
  no , of course you ca n't . 
  it 's not like they were total strangers . 
  i assume not , but while there is a pretty wide grey area , those two scenarios are pretty far apart , would n't you say ? 
  the investigation into rape was dropped by the first ( second counting the temp ) , yes , but not the other ones . 
  and it was only dropped for a few days before the decision was successfully appealed by the women 's counsel ( who is not their lawyer ) . 
  it 's rather dishonest to call him a politician since he was not politically active at the time . 
  tens of thousands of swedes are members of the social democratic party . 
  likewise , the source ( wikileaks/julian assange ) is not exactly being fair when it comes to the prosecutors . 
  they are not really bound geographically . 
  instead , they have different specialities , much like you have in any profession . 
  i guess the prosecutor could go there , but it would n't make much difference if she decides to go through with it , because he still needs to be present in court . 
  i ca n't imagine he 'd be any more prone to go to sweden if he knew for sure that he would end up in jail as soon as he got of the plane . 
  besides that , i can only see the us closing its investigation and promise not to seek his extradition . 
  that is if he 'd believe them . 
  sometimes i think it would be for the best if he just managed to sneak out of the embassy and got to ecuador . 
   i get the consent thing , but lawmakers really need to come up with different terms for situations like this and what actually goes through the mind of most people when they read `` that guy raped her '' . 
  sure , rape is a very widely defined concept ( in most places ) , but it 's not exactly the fault of the laws that people read too much into the word . 
  most rapes are not violent . 
  in fact , most rapes are probably between spouses . 
  it 's certainly by people you already know , and therefore not the kind you 're imagining in desolate parks and dark alleyways . 
   and their after-crime needs should n't be confused in the public 's mind with the needs of a woman who claims to have woken up with her `` boyfriend 's '' dick inside her and went `` please be std free and use a condom when you sex me up in my sleep '' just so we 're perfectly clear here , assange and this woman were not boyfriend and girlfriend . 
  seriously , have you seen wikileaks ' twitter feed ? 
  it 's pretty well known that it 's mostly just an outlet for assange , and boy does he let out . 
  i do n't think i 'm exaggerating too much if i say that 10 % of the tweets are about sweden in one way or another . 
  be careful with how you use the word `` charge '' . 
  it means something very specific , and it 's hard to make it fit with our legal system . 
  what is true though is that the prosecutor has to open an investigation ( absolute duty to prosecute ) . 
   `` raped '' by sweden 's definition of rape as in she is accusing him of purposefully breaking the condom he was using during entirely consensual sex based on the fact that he was initially reluctant to use one and one he agreed to do so it ended up broken in the end . 
  well , one of the accusations is that he did n't use a condom despite that being a precondition to consent . 
  that 's not the rape accusation though . 
  it 's certainly a very common misunderstanding , probably because of how ruthlessly it was spread early on in the investigation , when few had access to any concrete facts . 
  the actual case labelled as rape is that he allegedly penetrated a woman he was sharing a bed with , while she was still asleep . 
  to further confuse matter , he supposedly did n't use a condom in this instance either , but here it 's only an aggravating circumstance .
