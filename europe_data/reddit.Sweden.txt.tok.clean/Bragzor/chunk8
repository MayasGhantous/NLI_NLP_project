  the ecuadorian embassy in not of the drive-in sort , and as far as i can tell , there 's no gated area . 
  not in the real world. , but besides that , how would he get into the car ? 
  let 's not get ahead of ourselves . 
  there 's been investigations into wikileaks for sure , but assange is not currently charged with anything in the us , and consequently there 's currently no request for extradition either . 
  without a doubt , but technically , so does ecuador . 
  i assume that 's for the rape accusation , but what about the bail breakage ? 
  i do n't think there 's any international water between denmark and sweden in the sound . 
  going via the pacific ocean might be a better idea . 
  he could even go to reunion if he does n't fancy a trip around the world . 
  still seems a bit `` knee-jerky '' and childish , does n't it ? 
   it is if a guarantee is given . 
  there 's no legal way to make guarantees . 
  we 've been through this already . 
  who would even make it ? 
  the government is made up of people who happened to win the last election and whomever they chose to employ . 
  any such guarantee , even if legally possible , could be made irrelevant at any time . 
  if i was assange , that would not be good enough . 
   the process you described earlier follows the initial review . 
  which in turn follows an extradition request . 
   ** before ** the government makes a decision on the request , the prosecutor-general shall deliver ** a statement of opinion ** on the matter . 
  in addition , if the person referred to in the request has ** not consented ** to being extradited , the case shall be tried by the supreme court . 
   and i do n't know if you beat your wife . 
  you certainly do n't , but i 'm not the one the us is supposedly trying to prosecute . 
   sure , sure . 
  go back and read what i actually wrote . 
  i realise you 're in a frame of mind now where it might be hard to be impartial , but i really was just speculating . 
   first , it has n't been satisfactorily proven that manning met assange over irc or jabber in the first place . 
  as i understand it it is just what manning assumed , so no . 
   that throws a different light on things , and for me challenges the authenticity of this `` forensic '' data . 
  it sure does . 
  it would mean that if manning was using a high-density disk , that johnson falsified the logs . 
   manning explicitly said no identifying information was exchanged : then maybe that 's one less thing assange can be legally extradited for . 
   you labelling it `` inciting crimes '' does not make it so , and what 's more , journalists entice sources to provide classified material all the time . 
  so no , not really . 
  i 'm still just speculating . 
  i do n't know if assange had any contact with manning prior to the leak , but if he did talk him into it , then that would be a crime . 
   i read what you cited , i presume i can trust you ? 
  or ca n't i ? 
  well , i just copy pasted it from the english translation of the law linked to from the governmental page someone else linked to earlier , so i really hope so . 
  however , nothing i quoted had anything to do with hypothetical requests . 
   yes , order as in when you put on your boxer shorts on before your socks . 
  not order as in : pre-emptive refusal of extradition is illegal . 
  the government has the final say . 
  if the order in which you put on your clothes was regulated by law , then putting them on in the wrong order ** would ** be illegal . 
  yes , the government has the final say , not the first . 
   by a court ? 
  no , not that i 'm aware of : yes , you are correct . 
  appeals at this stage are obviously not handled by the courts . 
   that was ten days earlier . 
  they just could n't make up their mind ... uhm , eva fine dropped the investigation , borgstr\u00f6m ( not the government ) requested the review , and marianne ny picks it up . 
  you seem to imply that there was more back and forth than that . 
   but you can build a ladder . 
  anything that is not illegal is not illegal . 
  this goes without saying . 
  yes , they could build a framework , i.e change the law . 
  you can not possibly enumerate everything people or institutions are allowed to do . 
  this is an unattainable fantasy : the book of allowed things would contain more information than the observable universe could hold . 
  it 's obviously not an enumeration , but their functions are defined and regulated . 
  you really think the government should have more powers than those stated in the law ? 
  if it does n't explicitly state that they ca n't kidnap children , then they should be able to do so legally ? 
   no it does n't . 
  it cites the swedish government as follows : yes , that 's specifies in the law , but its not obvious in this case . 
  also , the highlighted part is the consequence of the unhighlighted part , i.e. 
  a direct result of an actual , existing , request . 
  this is what i said , so they agree with me , or rather the law does . 
   so , let 's say we go with your `` strict chronological order '' as a matter of legal necessity : you just got served . 
  thanks . 
  yeah , no i was n't . 
  that condition is a part of that very chronological order . 
  just not applicable in this case . 
   and i 'm quite familiar with the type of people who will defend their country right or wrong , good for you , and good for me that it just happens to be right in this case . 
   and the type of people who want a less transparent society with less civil liberties , less government transparency and restrictions on the freedom of the press . 
  people who support governments who rule with an iron fist , trampling over the judicial process and human rights , whatever it takes to silence dissent . 
  i really hope you do n't think i 'm one of them for wanting my government to ** not ** trample the judicial process , because i 'm very much pro-transparity and against dictatorships . 
  it really has nothing to do with this case , so i will give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you just went of on some irrelevant tangent . 
   first , because assange is not a u.s. citizen and is no more guilty of manning 's actions than greenwald , gellman , poitras or macaskill are of snowden 's . 
  ( who is a legitimate whistleblower anyway and should have never been charged ) well , i do n't know if he incited manning . 
  i 'm just speculating about what they could possibly try to pin on him . 
   second , although there is very clear and distinct difference between manning and assange ( and wikileaks ' submission mechanism via onion routing effectively denied assange the identity of manning to begin with ) , manning should have never been convicted in the first place , because he is a whistleblower , if it was snowden , i 'd agree . 
  no tor networks in the world can prevent contact if the two meet on irc and jabber first , which is the case here . 
   no , not really yeah , really . 
  inciting crimes is not what journalists normally do . 
   there is no legal impediment for the swedish government to address assange 's extradition concerns , and i have the sources you yourself quoted elsewhere in this thread to thank for this knowledge . 
  you mean the source you clearly did n't read ( nor do i actually think linked to it ) ? 
  the government has addressed it though . 
  they have described the legal protection he would have . 
   no , the government has the final say period , as per your own sources . 
  then you need to read it again . 
  the order off events is extremely clear . 
  i even highlighted some of the key phrases for you people . 
   indeed , they should n't have revived a baseless rape case as they did . 
  the investigation into rape was not revived by the government , but by a court after the decision to drop it was appealed by the women 's legal counsel . 
   exercising their right to ultimately deny an illegitimate extradition request is not a problem , though , because that 's what swedish law allows , as per your own sources . 
  please quote the section ( s ) that gives the government the right to guarantees against hypothetical extradition requests . 
   yes , and i thank you for proving my points . 
  you clearly did n't then . 
   if there is `` no legal framework whatsoever '' , there is nothing forbidding them . 
  that 's not how the government or the law works . 
  the functions of the government are regulated by the law . 
   there is , however , a legal framework for the government to refuse extraditions , and nowhere in your text does it state the government is precluded from pre-emptively denying one .
