  you seriously need to read it again !, 
  it is ** all ** dependent on a request . 
  everything described is the reaction to an actual request . 
   but , you said that there was `` no legal framework whatsoever '' , and you cited sources claiming the government has the final say . 
  yes , and if there is no framework , there 's no way of legally doing it . 
  you ca n't climb up a non-existing ladder either . 
   the sources you cite describe the bureaucratic chronological order of the process , not the legality or illegality of the government stating an intent to extradite or not to extradite . 
  they describe the process , which starts with a request ( go figure ! ) . 
  going outside of the process , which you 're advocating , is going outside of the law . 
  that is the law you 're reading . 
   until i get a source explicitly saying the swedish government is legally forbidden to do this , i 'm convinced they can . 
  if its not a right given by the law , then its forbidden . 
  what better source than the actual law donyou expect to find ? 
   edit : https://**justice4assange**.com/extraditing-assange.html#swedenveto1 super unbiased source , yet it agrees with me . 
  like on most other subjects , it starts out strongly by claiming lies and bloody murder , to then move the goal post a quarter of a mile and proving something else . 
  in this case they , much like yourself , go from saying tfat guarantees against hypothetical extraditions ate tots possible , to then prove that the government has the right to veto existing requests . 
  no shit ... then it all degenerates into a load of speculations . 
  if its not obvious , i 'm quite familiar with that site and the people it caters to . 
  the government has the final say ** after ** the courts have judged on the legality . 
  the government influencing the legal system , even though indirectly , is ** serious ** business . 
  did you read the parts i quoted ? 
  neither the government nor the courts can make guarantees about hypothetical extraditions . 
  there 's simply no way for them to legally do it in the laws . 
  the one thing i 've heard him accused of that he could possibly be extradited for is conspiracy to commit the crimes manning was later convicted of . 
  i do n't know how much evidence they have against him for that , but it would clearly go beyond a normal journalists source relationship . 
  the swedish government has nothing to do with wikileaks relationship with the us , and lacking an extradition request there 's nothing to comment on . 
  would n't be the first untruth passed around as fact in this matter . 
  i can tell you this though , he has asked for all the evidence based on a new law that was passed , but which would give him no such right , and was unsurprisingly denied access to the data . 
  the accusations are included in every document concerning his extradition . 
  we also know that he has access to a report from the police investigation , since they immediately leaked it . 
  he 's not formally charged yet though , so if that 's what he 's asking for , then he might have to wait a bit longer . 
  it 's by no means incidental . 
  i agree that it 's important to discuss how we treat journalists , but this is not the place . 
  this article has nothing to do with his affiliation with wikileaks . 
  he has not been extradited yet . 
  neither to sweden nor the us , so hold your horses . 
  if he has committed a crime in the us , and the internet is making such distinctions hard to make , then he should obviously answer to that , no ? 
  if the the crime or punishment is not recognized , then he wo n't be extradited . 
  the uk reserves the right to withdraw the status of diplomatic mission at any time . 
  technically it would no longer be the embassy , but in effect it there would be no difference . 
   as i understand it ( full text [ 1 ] ) , an extradition request is made , a government authority conducts an initial examination , the prosecutor-general determines whether the extradition is legal , the supreme court deliberates the matter and makes a recommendation to the government , which then makes the final decision . 
  ( i.e. 
  the government is not forced to extradite anyone it does not wish to extradite ) you are right that they are not forced , but missing the important matter of order . 
  from your own text :  the supreme court deliberates the matter and makes a recommendation to the government , ** which then ** makes the final decision . 
  ( i.e. 
  the government is not forced to extradite anyone it does not wish to extradite ) it 's even more clear in the actual law :  section 15 ** before the government makes a decision on the request ** , the prosecutor-general shall deliver a statement of opinion on the matter . 
  in addition , if the person referred to in the request has not consented to being extradited , the case shall be tried by the supreme court . 
  the request shall , however , be rejected immediately if there is a manifest reason why it should not be granted . 
  ( sfs 1981:1090 )  section 20 ** when the supreme court has issued its decision , the matter shall be reported to the government ** . 
  if the supreme court has considered extradition to be subject to an impediment according to sections 1 to 10 , the request may not be granted . 
  however , it may be decided by agreement with a foreign state that a matter may be referred to international arbitration if it is considered that there is an impediment to extradition according to section 8 or section 9 . 
  take note that this is in response to a request . 
  there is no legal framework whatsoever for dealing with hypothetical requests . 
  the courts can deny an existing request on legal grounds . 
  the government deny legally approved requests based on political grounds . 
  neither can make guarantees about hypothetical requests . 
   that site only gives one interpretation about the `` he has n't been charged yet '' , but there are just as many human rights lawyers who say it 's true that sweden usually tells you your charges after detainment within their national boundaries . 
  there are many * foreign * human rights lawyers who have voiced their opinions in this case without knowing anything about this particular case , or the judiciary . 
  besides , being informed what the investigations into you are about is not the same thing as being charged . 
  trust me , he knows what he 's accused of . 
  the problem might be that `` charged '' is a legal term , and it 's hard to apply it to all legal systems . 
   why the basics of any western justice system ? 
  i went to secondary school , as probably everybody else here . 
  i 'm sorry , but i do n't understand the question . 
   the prosecutors do n't have prove , you do n't know that and i do n't know that . 
  we have a leaked preliminary police report and that 's it . 
   do n't have witnesses , rape cases almost never do , which is why only countries like saudis arabia requires them . 
  they do have the accounts of the women though . 
   do n't have victims , oh yes they do . 
  at least potential victims . 
   and still they continue after such a long time . 
  the alternative would be to drop the case , which makes just about no sense since the longness of the case is almost exclusively assange 's doing , first by leaving sweden mid investigation and right before a scheduled interview , then by appealing the extradition in every court available , and finally by fleeing to the ecuadorian embassy just days after losing his last appeal . 
  it would set a dangerous precedence for the future to drop cases simply because the suspect goes into hiding . 
   they did that years ago , as far as i remember . 
  but it was only reported about very briefly . 
  then i would very much like to get a link to some of that reporting , because i know of no such retraction . 
  they `` dismissed their own case '' , as i said . 
  they ca n't dismiss cases , only judges can , and you said :  they retracted the charges ... which they also ca n't do . 
  that leaves retracting their stories , which it does n't seem like they did . 
  ecuador does indeed have a extradition treaty with the us , though it 's not very relevant to assange 's position . 
  i do n't think they have one with sweden though . 
  he 's only accused of having raped the second woman . 
  she did go to the police . 
  sure it took a few days , but this was n't some alleyway rape . 
  this woman was neither . 
  of course it was refused . 
  it 's a completely unacceptable demand . 
  most countries cooperate with the us in some ways , but non as much as the uk , where he had just spent over two years . 
  i doubt you know all that much about this case since few of us do , and you admitting that you have no idea about the laws involved , but i assure you , for someone like assange , being a convicted rapist would mean a lot . 
  much more so than being trapped in an e!bassy . 
  but sure , it 's possible that assange is just afraid of being extradited to the us , who have n't charged him with anything , or asked to have him extradited . 
  and maybe it 's just a coincidence that this threat became acute just days after assange losing his last appeal against being extradited to sweden . 
  maybe . 
  in the end rape cases are almost always hard to sort out , and more so when the suspect refuses to cooperate . 
   the two women dismissed their own case when they retracted the charges two years ago . 
  first of all , ( potential ) victims do n't charge people , prosecutors do . 
  secondly , even though victims can * press * charges , neither of the women did in this case , so they ca n't even retract their accusations . 
  thirdly , the only way they could affect the investigation is by retracting their statements about what happened , and they have n't done that . 
  it might not be considered rape in some countries , such as afghanistan , but it would probably be in most western countries . 
  it certainly would in the uk .
