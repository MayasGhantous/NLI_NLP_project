that makes me sad . 
  parties should have integrity and stand up for their ideology . 
  they 're not companies that have to follow trends . 
  well i 'm not a sweden democrat , and i do n't agree with their policies in the least , but it 's a trend among all non-sd parties now . 
  they 've all stepped further to the right in order to curry votes from people voting sd . 
  is n't it ` bretagne ' in french ? 
   vegeterian  gyro  / u/ccyan is half-greek * eye twitch *, 
  i think that 's the proper adjective to use actually . 
  not the vandals , but the [ wends ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wends ), 
  bonaparte for lyfe . 
  iirc the federal government uses english or hindi , but the state governments will use local languages . 
  it took me like an hour and a half and i was pissed off it was so slow ... 
  i 've gained a fresh perspective on life . 
  you bake bread, 
  what did you think he was ? 
  iran was always called iran , in iran . 
  persia was an exonym . 
  maybe he 'll pull a north korea and stay in office even after his death, 
  i 've done this in hearts of iron iv . 
  do n't forget an economic shithouse, 
  not really ? 
  it 's still a soft drink . 
  it 's about 12 % juice apparently , and it 's also sweetened and carbonated . 
  sounds like a soft drink to me . 
  orangina is carbonated ... 
  it 's the same with the parthenon in athens, 
  in other news , it appears the sky is blue . 
  in america and the uk they tend to measure their yearly salary rather than monthly . 
  no , that 's not a screensaver . 
  that 's a wallpaper , or desktop background . 
  the kingdom of prussia was n't part of the hre , however , the electorate of brandenburg was , and the kings of/in prussia were also the electors of brandenburg, 
  elective actually, 
  you think ? 
  i do n't think [ he looks anything like ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pope_francis#/media/file:franciscus_in_2015.jpg ) [ palpatine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/palpatine#/media/file:emperor_rotj.png ),

  nea polis is greek i 'm fairly certain . 
  novigrad means `` new city '' iirc , i think there 's even a city in croatia called novigrad, 
  citation please ?

  agreed . 
  wtf happened ? 
  yeah it 's the same here . 
  we had 85 % turnout in 2014 and people were complaining about it being low, 
   first of all , do you do something what can be held against you rest of your life ? 
  is it just me or is this the old `` if you 've got nothing to hide , you 've got nothing to fear '' ? 
  i never said you could ? 
  i did n't mean to imply that they do n't sound different , my main point is that as far as i 'm aware '' \u00e4 '' does not exist as a seperate letter in the german alphabet , but rather is an `` a '' with accents that change the sound of the letter . 
  and swedish . 
  as far as i 'm aware though , in german it 's just an `` a '' with umlauts . 
   paz pax * you degenerate, 
  just realised i have him tagged in res as `` dasvedanja , putinbot '', 
  true , but to be fair , as european monarchs go , the prince of liechtenstein is actually quite powerful . 
  no , there was not . 
  what is it with greeks an marble flooring ?? 
  both my aunts have it , my grandfather has it ... it 's all marble all the time, 
  to be fair i 'm not aware of any such convention here either . 
  iceland is nordic because they , along with finland , sweden , denmark and norway have a deeply intertwined history and similar cultures and similar welfare states . 
  it 's a cultural , political and geographical term . 
  scandinavia is a geographical and cultural term , referring to the countries on the scandinavian peninsula ( sweden and norway ) as well as denmark , as they all also share a deeply intertwined history and culture , as well as to varying degrees mutually intelligble north germanic languages . 
  the reason i linked to wikipedia is because it explains it bloody perfectly . 
  finland is nordic because of the reasons i mentioned above , but it 's not scandinavian because the majority of the country is not on the scandinavian peninsula and you do n't have a mutually intelligble language . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordic_countries https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scandinavia, 
  he 'd be the head of government , not state would n't he ? 
  they are n't though ... finland is definitely a nordic country , but it 's not a scandinavian one . 
  libya *, 
  ah , one of those i see . 
  have a nice day . 
  nazism is a fascist ideology , you 're aware of that right ? 
  ah so there we have it .

  i did n't comment on `` fascists gon na fasci '' because it 's directly relevant to to the post . 
  if it had been posted in a thread about a communist mp beating up a colleague , then i would have commented on that too . 
  then what exactly were you trying to imply with `` commies gon na commie '' ? 
  if you were n't trying to imply that nd are communists , how are communists at all relevant ? 
  are you calling new democracy communists ? 
  because i can assure you , they are n't . 
  or are you trying to deny that golden dawn is fascist ? 
  the party led by [ this guy ] ( http://neoskosmos.com/news/sites/default/files/imagecache/news_node_image/2014/june/michaloliakos_nazi.jpg ) ? 
  give me a break, 
  very interesting , thank you . 
  yeah , fair enough . 
  are estonians generally emotionally attached to their flag ? 
  i ask only out of curiosity btw , because in my experience swedes generally are n't at all . 
  i like the estonian flag ( in fact it 's currently flying in front of the town hall in my city , not entirely sure why ) but you ca n't be nordic without a nordic cross :p i saw a version with the nordic cross that actually looked really cool, 
  alright , thank you !, 
  p.s it 's only a matter of time ( and a flag change :p ) until you lads can into nordic :d, 
  haha . 
  off-topic but what 's a good time and place to visit in estonia ? 
  i 'd really like to go sometime . 
  estonia can not into nordic though, 
  they can take our lives , but they can never take our ~ ~ freedom ~ ~ sovereignty !, 
  100 years ? 
  seems likely enough tbh ... 
  vive la france !, 
  a rather accurate description lol . 
  lots of things i love about ellada ( food , people , landscape ) , but television aint one of them haha, 
  how strange . 
  then again i often find greek television to be a bit odd, 
  admittedly my greek has been getting rather rusty due to lack of practice and i sometimes have trouble following it when its spoken quickly , but is she pretending to be an alien ?
