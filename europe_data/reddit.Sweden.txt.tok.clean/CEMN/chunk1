sadly we have ~ ~ our fair share ~ ~ an endless supply of stupid people in the ~ ~ uk ~ ~ world . 
  absolutely agree with the idea of a slightly less severe ( chilly ? ), 
  cold war . 
  in my above posts i 've even acknowledged that an actual confrontation is unlikely , but at the end of the day i 'd prefer spending more money to be sure . 
  defending my country is tied to my political beliefs and i do feel solidarity with others in europe . 
  a conflict involving russia and the west in some way would likely be destabilisation efforts through `` independent '' groups using electronic warfare and perhaps arming and organisation of groups such as the huge russian presence in parts of the baltics . 
  so the question is , where does nato draw the line in such a conflict ? 
  and does that imply for sweden ? 
  because of that uncertainty i prefer to be a little too paranoid rather than a little too naive . 
  sure , but russian violations of swedish airspace sharply declined after the end of the cold war and is only starting to increase again the last few years . 
  aggressive person ? 
  hardly . 
  aggressive style of debate ? 
  maybe . 
  i 'm passionate about defense questions because as a liberal i believe that all the rights and benefits that comes with living in sweden and europe are connected to the duty to also defend those , militarily and otherwise . 
  even if still unlikely , a conflict between russia and western europe is most certainly something we will * not * be able to stay out of , even disregarding notions of solidarity because of how extremely dependent our economy is on trade and the state of global finance , something that will certainly face critical shocks in the event of such a war . 
  oh so all the russian violations of swedish airspace this year and practise bombing raids against swedish targets are also part of the conspiracy ? 
  furthermore , you 're wrong since the current government is planning to increase defense spending and is even considering reestablishing conscription . 
  the recurring message from the swedish armed forces has been : - '' * this is not a submarine hunt , we lack the resources for that so what we are doing is to be classified as an intelligence gathering mission * . '', 
  - '' * we have evidence of `` foreign underwater activity '' ( mini-submarines or divers ) in swedish territorial waters , specifically this region for several years . 
  * - * we have highly plausible indications that such activity is currently taking place * [ not too sure about terminology but what they 're using the official term that implies the highest possible degree of supsicions ] * but we can not confirm any speculation about nationality or purpose . 
  * now , you can believe it 's a conspiracy where the impoverished swedish armed forces just launched a huge and costly operation to acquire funds and join nato if you want . 
  personally i believe russia is doing most of the fear-mongering itself , regardless of swedish media . 
  they 've spent all spring and summer violating swedish air space and practising bombing raids against swedish targets , so why would n't they be doing the same under water ? 
  swedish defense politics the last 25 years has pretty much been '' * hey look , russia will either embrace our system of peaceful democracy and market liberalism , or be poor and toothless !, 
  we wo n't need a national defense ever again , let 's decimate the budget and put what meagre resources are still available into foreign peace keeping . 
  * '' turns out russia found a third way and we 'd be stupid not to listen to the ringing alarm bells . 
  fuck ukrainians who believe they have the right to make sovereign democratic decisions regardless of their much more powerful neighbour with nostalgic imperial ambitions right ? 
  i suppose you also support al-qaeda and the `` islamic state '' then ? 
  instead of downvoting you , i 'm curious to know why you support russia ? 
  where are you from ? 
  hey lukashenko , do n't bite the hand that feeds you ... 
  even if it feeds you toilet paper and soy . 
  and the dresser . 
  and the table . 
  and the chair ... 
  russia gets criticized here a lot mostly because of your backwards , corrupt , anti-democratic , militaristic government rather than russian people in general . 
  then there is of course cultural stereotypes of alcoholism , dashcams , poor education and other things , but i would n't call that racism unless you 'd also qualify stereotypes of racist , bible-thumping cousin-marrying , weapon-wielding , flag-waving rednecks in the us south as racism . 
  thanks !, 
  this was the kind of explanation i was looking for !, 
  explanation please ? 
  the free movement of labor across eu borders is one of the fundamental pillars of the union . 
  if this is causing problems for a national economy , it 's their own fault . 
  malta is and island , morocco is comparatively safe and stable , mexico is n't filled with extremists and weak , collapsing governments . 
  and it 's not like * huge * floods of people , weapons , drugs do n't enter the us despite big walls and barbed fence ... 
  your second point is spot on though , i agree completely . 
  the shift of power matters * way * more than religion , which is what i 've argued against all along . 
  yeah , unfortunately it does n't matter who 's at fault when germany , greece and cyprus can use their vetos . 
   as if eastern eu does n't border an unstable region hah , are you comparing russia to iraq , syria , lebanon ... ? 
   cyprus is a short boat trip from the levant , malta from africa , spain even has exclaves in muslim africa smuggling of people , weapons and other things are way harder to control along long land borders ( how much control does the turkish government actually have over the kurdish mountain borders ? ), 
  than to and from islands or heavily gated and guarded enclaves in spain and morocco is pretty stable . 
   i guarantee you if anatolia were under christian greek rule this would n't even be a conversation . 
  if you want to believe it is only about religion , i 'd say you 're very misinformed . 
  one of them is * definitely * religion . 
  but there are of course loads of other reasons : - turkey 's growing authoritarianism - decades of hostility towards press and journalists - treatment of kurds ( although seemingly heading in the right direction now ) - refusal to recognize the armenian holocaust - the issue of cyprus - millions of turks living in germany for decades or generation without getting citizenship - the huge population in general , proximity to and borders with volatile-as-fuck middle eastern states ... 
  nuke stockpiles in nordic countries !? 
  source please ? 
  from my post :  the build-up to which was ** caused by governments of both sides ** in the decades before . 
  [ swedish governments 1975-2006 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dw49auz.png?1 ) my `` re-writing history '' comes from a university semester of economics , with former member of centre-right folkpartiet , anders bergh as head lecturer and author of the course literature : [ * `` the conclusion is that both political blocs should be blamed for the stagnation \\ [ of swedish economy \\ ] and - especially - both blocs should be credited for greatly increasing economic freedom in sweden during the last two decades of the 1900 's . 
  ** edit : ** i should clarify that i originally meant that the crisis broke out during bildt , his politics just sped up the process while the opposition did n't do much to help . 
  my point that we have a better economy today partly because of the financial clean-up during the following social democratic governments under g\u00f6ran persson still stands . 
  some insight from someone who voted for the former centre-right government last election , and against it in this one : - the swedish economy has done great through the crisis in part because of a competent finance minister , * but also * because we already suffered through [ financial crisis in the early 90 's ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_banking_rescue ) , the build-up to which was caused by governments of both sides in the decades before . 
  - the crisis broke out because of the frivolous dergulations by the centre-right government of carl bildt , and was cleaned up by social democrats , leaving a stable and sound economy for the centre-right government we 've had through the current crisis . 
  my reasons for voting agianst the centre-right government : - despite 8 years of reforms and lots of money , school grades keep plummeting . 
  - there has been a rush to privatize schools , hospitals , care for the elderly with little or no benefit for society and little or no regulations , and several scandals were investors have bought such welfare institutions , cutting costs by firing people and lowering expenses , and then selling or declaring bankruptcy . 
  - they have continued the left-wing tradition of cutting defense spending . 
  the left wing actually has a more credible defense policy nowadays . 
  - our absolutely brainless minister of justice , beatrice ask . 
  she has not completed any education over high school , no education in law whatsoever . 
  contrary to international research , she advocates severe punishments for crime , especially related to violence and drugs . 
  she also thinks * suspected * sex offenders should recieve mail in bright purple lettering because , i do n't even know , shaming criminal suspects before any legal proceedings have begun is a good idea ? 
  - [ the catastrophic nuon deal ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/blogs/corneliushamelberg/?p=17646 ) , which cost taxpayers billions , which our prime minister , financial minister and former businiess minister lied about in constitutional hearings . 
  lying , corruption , incompetence or a combination of above ? 
  edit : gold !? 
  for this barely sourced , poorly spell-checked statement of my personal opinions ? 
  [ well , thank you !, 
  ( i can absolutely read what you 're writing in catalan ! ), 
  i never said i think languages are stupid , i said nationalism is - which is why i , unlike you , do n't care which language you spell geographical names in . 
  as i said , i do n't think you and i can have any constructive conversation about nationalism , since i think nationalism in general is stupid , divisive and destructive and i do n't care even a little bit which language you choose to spell sweden/suecia/su \u00e8cia , catalonia/catalu \u00f1a / catalunya or spain/espa \u00f1a / espanya . 
  claro que no compatriota mio !, 
  you can spell * catalu\u00f1a * in english or catalan if you want , but i 'll continue using the castilian spelling . 
  that 's exactly how it was when i lived there around 2005-2006 in catalu\u00f1a . 
  for example , construction sites were * everywhere * and they were invariably staffed by northern africans , subsaharians and eastern europeans . 
  then the financial crisis happened , the construction sector imploded and spanish economy went down the toilet . 
  the article and i are not talking about people who feel like change of scenery , we 're talking about people fleeing persecution , war , genocide . 
  * refugees * , not immigrants . 
  these people need more support and incentive to integrate and become productive members of society rather than living on welfare , which is what our state is failing to do . 
  if it were up to me , refugees would be given free - and mandatory - therapy and classes in swedish , easier access to low level jobs , training and so on . 
  the problem is neither our housing market or our employment markets are designed for this . 
  a high percentage of jobs require high-skill/educated labour . 
  yes , the problem is we suck at integration . 
  refugees do n't learn swedish , become part of society and get jobs . 
  this is the fault of both main political blocks over at least two decades , and none of them want to admit that fact . 
  therefore the only party that critizes current policy is a formerly neo-nazi populist moral conservative one , * filled * with people who are stupid enough to go on social media and post shockingly hateful , racist , homophobic and islamophobic things , despite the party 's official zero-tolerance on these things . 
  that 'd be letting the terrorists win !, 
  they will * never * take my beard !, 
  agreed . 
  the moment the us credibility in defending its allies is questioned is the moment china starts steamrolling through sea and the middle east explodes . 
  yeah personally i 'm for nato membership or at least an extensive defense pact with finland or any of our neighbours . 
  that being said , attacking sweden without involving finland or the baltics would be pretty complicated and fuck up the already fragile eu economy so much that the rest of the eu would feel the sting .
