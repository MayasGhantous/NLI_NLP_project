  good point . 
  though i trust the us more than europe , there 's simply too much at stake geopolitically if it can suddenly be argued that their guarantees of security are not to be trusted . 
  ely5 : the current global geopolitical balance would go to absolute shit if the us did n't honor it 's obligations to see an attack on any nato member as an attack on itself ; and russia can not fight the full might of nato in . 
  an attack on a eu , but non-nato member would be more complicated but the same thing would probably apply . 
   the left wing extremists are scum . 
  so are the right wing . 
  any extremists . 
  they are undemocratic idiot youths . 
  agreed 100 % . 
  but , violent attacks and persecution against representatives of any non-extreme left-wing party , including sd , are very rare however and carried out by individuals on the fringe of an already extremist movement . 
   noone cares if someone steals from or hurts a sweden democrat . 
  it 's such an overwhelming crackdown that i am surprised that sd even survived . 
  this is 100 % bullshit . 
  you 're mixing up things here . 
  those violently attacked by left-wing extremists were mostly part of [ smr ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_resistance_movement ) who are actual militant '' * the international jewish conspiracy controls world finance and media and are trying to exterminate the white race through feminization and mass immigration * '' - nazis . 
  sd are however somewhat unfairly reported on by mainstream media and their rights to free speech is often violated at public rallies , where left-wing supporters make noise and cause disturbances . 
  `` standard conservative '' according to some , right-wing populists according to most . 
  russia still has work camps as punishment ? 
  any sources on that ? 
  alternate title : * islamic extremist makes sweden go ' * meh * ' with tv-threat * the fact that there are swedish ( and other european ) citizens radical enough to be getting their jihad on in the middle east is worrysome of course , but the national threat level has n't changed and people seem to take the news calmly . 
   * china 's xi jinping drove a brutal bargain in may on a future gazprom pipeline , securing a price near $ 350 per 1,000 cubic metres that is barely above russia 's production costs . 
  *   * pieties aside , the two countries are rivals in central asia , where china is systematically building pipelines that break russia 's stranglehold . 
  china has large territorial claims on far eastern russia , land seized from the qing dynasty in the 19th century . 
  * sounds like a lovely relationship compared to how horrible russia has fared doing business with europe !, 
  talllllllllllllllllllll, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl-s2jdcdhu ) ( in swedish ), 
  that 's where you and most people of the civilised world disagree . 
  ouch , all those positive comments must really sting . 
  ironically most people in this thread seem to identify more with a black dutchman rather than a slovak with early-last-century ideas about race and nationality . 
  yeah i meant that sarcastically , you know in the way ` murica brings * freedom * !, 
  ukraine , prepare to recieve some * glasnost * and * perestrojka * !, 
  hah good luck . 
  exporting military hardware is essential for covering costs of r&d , which can be important for small countries to produce their own systems . 
  but i agree , those exports should be heavily regulated so as to not sell to ongoing conflicts and not to states that regularly abuse human rights or international law . 
  sweden for example is a small country with an important military industry , with lots of nice regulations which cause our government to hesitate calling saudi arabia a dictatorship which violates human rights . 
  freedom from euronazi propaganda !, 
  freedom from homosex !, 
  freedom from weakling democratic system !, 
  yeah like , sanctions and stuff - ugh so boring !, 
  why have n't we totally nuked moscow yet i mean god all those warheads are just collecting dust . 
  and nato kinda needs a new job now that afghanistan thing is all over so they should just totally like , occupy or annex russia or whatever . 
  and totally give them human rights and economy and stuff oh and crimea to ukraine . 
  geopolitics is n't exactly rocket science , duh !, 
  funny how so many so often attribute the same kind of rethoric to 2 billion muslims ... 
  you say `` the west '' as if we were all the same political entity . 
  afghanistan was approved by the un and many non-western powers , most of the eu was thoroughly against the war in iraq and the limited intervention against ghadaffi was requested by libyan rebels themselves , after which they completely failed to reach any sort of national unity . 
  yes , i agree he did n't expect the maidan protests to be so strong or yanukovich to run away with his tail between his legs . 
  but i 'd still say everything he 's done since that is according to plan . 
  his attitude towards georgia , ukraine and everything else in his percieved russian sphere of influence has long pointed to him preferring power politics over good relations to the west . 
  we 'll see how far he 'll go as the eu and us steps up . 
  well , not necessarily if he 's purposely turning away from the west and towards the east as i believe is the case . 
  do you honestly believe putin expected us to applaud things like the ukraine situation , crackdowns on dissent at sotji or increasing homophobia ? 
  meanwhile , china does n't care and central asian neighbours either suck up to russia or join out of fear as they know the west wo n't do shit for them . 
  you misunderstand , i 'm not saying russia is healthy , i am saying that the putin regime is successful in accomplishing its goals . 
  putin is a cold , calculating nationalist , not a crazed megalomaniac . 
  proving my point , we need russia in the short term . 
  russia 's surely got a market in china and the rest of asia * at least * in the long term . 
  could you link any sources on that ? 
  what i posted is mostly based on analysis from various western media and political institutes but i do n't have good information about how russians see it . 
  as far as i know , russia gained everything they wanted from crimea and got away with it scot free . 
  if anything , it was a loss of prestige for us in the west while internally , most russians support interventionism in ukraine . 
  sotji was indeed a success in the eyes of russians as nothing really went wrong and that putin made a point of hosting them in a formerly volatile area . 
  even when pussy riot were beaten by security forces many russians seem to be conservative and think they deserve it for what they did to the church and lack of patriotism . 
  the laws against homosexuality , outrage against eurovision and other moral issues seems to be another thing that enjoys wide support within russia and paints the eu and the west in general as something undesirable . 
  could you link any sources on that ? 
  not saying you 're wrong , but from what i have read thus far it seems to be more of a short term problem for europe than long term problem for russia . 
  china is certainly looking to lessen their energy dependency on the us , who can hopefully supply europe now that they 're producing a lot while russia faces east . 
  nah , the putin regime knows exactly what it 's doing . 
  they 've grabbed the strategically important crimea with few consequences , they 're punishing ukraine for chosing good relations to the eu rather than russia , they 're refocusing their exports to central asia and asia and strengthening their ties with china . 
  now they can paint europe as a threat and thus increase demand for strong ( authoritarian ) leadership , increased military spending and future use of coercion and intervention within russia 's sphere of influence . 
  yes , swedish national radio and television is excellent in this regard . 
  [ from wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sveriges_radio ) : * sveriges radio is a public limited company , owned by an independent foundation , and funded through a licensing fee determined by the swedish riksdag . 
  no advertising is permitted . 
  sr 's status could be described as that of a quasi-autonomous non-governmental organization . 
  * [ sveriges television ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sveriges_television ) works in pretty much the same way . 
  how long before we have these poor , [ `` disabled '' ] ( http://criticalmas.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/scooter.jpg ) people in europe ? 
  `` hey look at me , i 'm so fat i can neither walk nor take responsibility for my life anymore . 
  it 's a disease i tell ya !, 
  now excuse me while i [ roll over to the fast food joint . ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qmnrt45571k/t_hsv6u06hi/aaaaaaaarl8/4nkumx5frze/s1600/scooters+at+fast+food.jpg ) . 
  and who has time to [ cook for their kids ] ( http://www.smartambala.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/funny-fat-boy.jpg ) , anyway . '', 
  am i the only one who would like to see a mandatory eu-standardised course of english , both for school children and a similiar course for adults ? 
  i disagree , the emotions in the voices of the actors are definitely more important . 
  some of my favorite movies in languages i do n't understand are * am\u00e9lie * ( french ) , * lola rennt * ( german ) , * black cat white cat * ( romani and serbo-croatian-whatever-you-wanna-call-it ) and the * infernal affairs * trilogy ( chinese ) and i 'd never want to watch any of those in swedish or english . 
  i do n't know about the other countries , but i lived in spain and the acting is piss poor , it 's oftn the same actor doing multiple voices , every child in every movie sound the same , which also applies to every male black actor ( will smith in * men in black * sounds just like denzel washington in * remember the titans * , it 's hilarious ) . 
  really though , the headline sucks and there is n't even any form of link to anything of substance , not the election , not even anything to promote discussion . 
  the essence of a shitpost . 
  hah that is perfect , old juan carlos could get a new job !, 
  they are dependent on us too . 
  the us-eu economic relationship is extremly important for the whole globe : [ ec.europa.eu ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/countries-and-regions/countries/united-states/ ) [www.fas.org ] ( http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/rl30608.pdf ) [ www.ustr.gov ] ( http://www.ustr.gov/sites/default/files/chapter%20i%20the%20presidents%20trade%20policy%20agenda.pdf ) i responded to someone who proposed the eu has to be a usa-style superpower in a new emerging multipolar cold war situation . 
  my reply , in short , is that i prefer to have the us on our side as that mere fact is more of a deterrent than anything we in europe can do on our own . 
  you 're right about good and bad federalism of course and no one knows for sure if a super-eu would be a force for true freedom and liberty , but right now i 'm concerned about growing european state nationalism and the huge expansion of surveillance in the name of fighting terror and crime in general . 
  i mean our national governments are already spying on us , what would improve if you put those powers in brussels ? 
  yeah , why are they even independent ? 
  they owe us a few decades worth of oil revenue !, 
  i meant we are dependent on them for defense and economy , and that is fine . 
  what we should avoid is federalization of the eu . 
  common , fully integrated defense , sure . 
  but a federated eu would probably devalue our democracy and freedom is what i meant . 
  hell no , we do n't stand a chance without the united states . 
  we 'd need to invest decades of time and resources for a defense and force projection on the level the us and nato provides us .
