  secondly , our economies are highly dependent on eachother so if anything we need more integration with nato and the us . 
  it is inevitable . 
  further federalization would curtail our democracy and make us a * usa light * in terms of the relationship between economy , politics and media . 
  especially for us in scandinavia , that is something we would want to avoid . 
  yes . 
  this is the kind of stuff i want withing europe and an area i 'd like to see the eu expand in . 
  cooperation and interoperability in defence , more bang for the buck . 
  yeah sorry bout that . 
  sk\u00e5ne is nice though !, 
  woah i take it back . 
  imagine how silly the star-spangled banner would look with 51 stars . 
  well i did n't mean you should hug me , but someone , whoever !, 
  you might feel better and stop being so angry and bitter . 
  take care !, 
  you seem like you need a hug . 
  have a nice day ,

  the amount of swedish-finnish brotherly love in this thread f\u00e5r \u00e4lgarna att gr\u00e5ta !,

  translation : '' * poland is developing quickly . 
  but many families still work in agriculture , the old-fashioned way . 
  * '' as for how recent it is , it 's from 1993 at the earliest ( soviet union has disbanded ) and 2006 at the latest ( serbia-montenegro is still a thing ) . 
  ah , thanks for clarifying . 
  people flip their shit over turkey because of human rights abuses , weak democratic institutions , huge population , cultural and religious differences , security concerns from their borders with the middle east . 
  and then there 's issues from individual member countries such as germany who do n't want to give citizenship to the hundreds of thousands ( millions ? ), 
  of turks who have been living there for decades or even generations , as well as greek contention over cyprus and other things . 
  maybe it means you should rejoin sweden , [ we 've missed you guys !,

  me too !, 
  faith in institutions , exercise and secularism sounds pretty swedish , does n't it ? 
  huh , expected italy to be much worse . 
  because they imprison more journalists per capita than north korea . 
  among other undemocratic practices . 
  i agree with this map , although i 'd put bulgaria and parts of the former yugoslavia in the * southern europe * category . 
  well we do combat training with both live ammunition and blanks as well . 
  my example was a one time ocurrence in 12 months worth of military service . 
  but it happens . 
  and as i mentioned , those who see live combat ( i.e. 
  those who go on foreign missions ) are very adequately trained and prepared . 
  [ here is an article ] ( http://www.svt.se/nyheter/val2014/vi-springer-runt-och-sager-pang-pang ) ( you 'll have to google translate it ) about the problem persisting today , six years later . 
  the same problem applies to eod teams who do n't get to practice with real explosives , or with a tenth of what they would in a real case scenario . 
  important to note though is that soldiers who go on any foreign mission get to exercise without these limitations and are held to very high standards in every mission they 've been on . 
  well we ( as in the west ) did n't only count on continued russian weakness , we ( again , as in the west ) expected them to eventually find the path to democratisation and liberal market economy . 
  why would they start shit when they have more to gain by joining us and trading with us ? 
  well , since cold war-era politicians such as putin percieve that path as being too dominated by the west , and so while we 've thought economic integration with russia would keep relations good , putin sees it as a loss of power , which is why we 're so caught with our pants down now as russia turns more autocratic and aggressive . 
  well , our current one is competent and qualified , but in the current government defense policy is , as it always has been with alliansen , completely subject to our department of finance . 
  anders borg is the only real defense minister we 've had . 
  and i 'm not in any way implying the opposition would be any different . 
  hah , i 'll never forget the time we were practicing ambushing an enemy force , our squad shouting '' * bang !, 
  bang bang !, 
  * '' when suddenly , a wild vehicle target appeared . 
  me : * `` 10 o clock !, 
  enemy armour !, 
  ready anti tank !, 
  '' * soldier : * `` anti tank ready !, 
  '' * me : * `` fire at will !, 
  '' * soldier : * `` firing anti tank !!, 
  ... uhhh ... booshhhhhh ... ka pow !!, 
  '' * it took the lieutenant in charge of the exercise considerable discipline to keep a straight face . 
  that was back in 2008 and i hear it 's pretty much the same today ... 
  typical stupid swedish defence policy , throwing money the wrong way rather than solving the fundamental problems at hand . 
  the last decade it 's been problems caused by foreign missions ( kosovo , afghanistan , chad , libya , gulf of aden ) consuming the budget needed to complete the 20 years-and-counting reformation from a cold war full-scale invasion defense to a modern flexible one . 
  the second and current glaring problem is throwing money at the defense industry rather than spending on education and fuel for our tanks , planes and other weapon systems , as well as the critical lack of personell after the change from conscription to voluntary recruitment , mostly due to many people quitting early and the low salaries and benefits . 
  having advanced and modern weapon systems is crucial for the modern flexible defense , and the foreign missions have been beneficial in giving us a lot of experience and international good-will , but it does n't matter when the armed forces barely function as a whole in the long term . 
  [ ha en trevlig nationaldag !, 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/sweden/comments/23912o/sk%c3%a4rtorsdagen/ ), 
  long term economic integration with the eu seems to have worked pretty well for a lot of states in eastern europe , and guess what ? 
  popular opinion was in favor of that , which is why protests started , rather than price cuts on russian energy ( which can easily be reversed if the ukrainians do n't follow their master 's bidding ! ), 
  and more bribes for yanukovich and his friends . 
  no one ( including western media ) is implying svoboda and other nationalists did n't take part in the protests , but if you think the majority was n't people who were tired of their leader being a corrupt puppet of russia - well then you 've obviously fallen for russian propaganda . 
  what does the united states have to do with  following putin or suck eu cock you seem to imply that eu pressures on ukraine to join economic integration is pretty much the same as russian extortion , coercion and actual military invasions . 
  and that life under russia would be pretty nice compared to life in the eu . 
  uh what ? 
  no free press , no free assembly , no freedom of sexuality , huge , all-powerful executive branch which sees the legislative and judicial branches as guiding rather than providing balance of power ? 
  i could go on , but right there are a few of the glaringly unlibertarian things about russia . 
  well thank ~ ~ god ~ ~ vladimir putin for the bastion of freedom democracy and human rights that is russia !, 
  ** no ** homsexuals or perverted minorities !, 
  ** no ** dissenting media !, 
  ** no ** critical opposition leaders - they 're all liars anyway !, 
  ** no ** pesky human rights groups - they 're foreign spies , all of them !, 
  ** no ** musical satire or protests of any kind , they 're agitators who deserve to be trampled beneath the boots of the cossacks and riot police !, 
  ** no ** strong economic growth and prosperity , money belongs in the hands of friendly oligarchs rather than poor people !, 
  destabilising , raising energy prices , annecting territory and amassing huge military contingents on the borders of a soveign nation is the only way to counter a few fascists !, 
  thank you [ based putin !, 
  ] ( http://www.awsm.com/img/2010/vladimir-putin-riding-bear.jpg ), 
   and everyone is happy to ignore the actual neo-nazi fascists which are in power in ukraine now . 
  om nom nom , dat delicious russian propaganda . 
  well right now that 's the theme for europe in general , and for good reason . 
  though i 'd rather say * fuck putin and the brainwashed masses who follow him * . 
  what i described is the absolute * minimal * definition of democracy . 
  and by direct rule or sortition i take it you mean something like they have in switzerland ? 
  even in those forms of democracy an executive branch is elected by the people , the difference is that a lot of power is moved from the legislative to referendums . 
  my opinion as a is that due democratic process is slow for a reason , which is mostly a good thing . 
  secession should only be an option when : 1 . 
  both parties agree to the idea of secession . 
  one party is being repressed . 
  / u/aleixasv and other nationalists will surely argue that the small amount of their gdp that funds poorer parts of spain counts as oppression , but i do n't .
