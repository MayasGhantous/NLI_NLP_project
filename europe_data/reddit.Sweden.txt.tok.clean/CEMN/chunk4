  the regional catalonian government has full autonomy in everything else except foreign - and defense policy . 
  separatism in catalonia is strong mostly because of populism and the current financial crisis , but since they need spain 's approval to join the eu they wo n't be better off for many years . 
  which is why i believe both parties should agree to the idea of secession before you make unilateral declarations . 
  no one will be a winner when you do it this way . 
   the constitution of spain would not apply to independent catalonia anymore than the constitution of the united states applies to canada . 
  the constitution of the us does not apply to canada because unlike catalonia , canada is a sovereign state . 
  neither could you compare the relationship between a us state and the us constitution , since the us is a full federation , and spain is not . 
  democracy consists of two parts : * people power * , and * constitutionalism * . 
  * people power * means that a vast majority of citizens in some way ( such as elections ) chose their leaders . 
  * constitutionalism * means that those elected must act within the framework provided by a democratic constitution . 
  * constitutionalism * without * people power * describes many semi-democracies of from around 150 years ago : strong checks and balances limiting government , but only men , also often requiring a certain amount of wealth could vote . 
  * people power * without * constitutionalism * is what 's happening in for example russia and venezuela today : their governments got political mandate through people 's votes , but the elected government abuses it 's powers over the legislative and judicial branches to consolidate it 's own position . 
  constitutions exist for a reason , and only once the spanish constitution has been changed to allow separatism can any such referendum be considered legal or democratic . 
  well , abiding by a democratically formulated constitution is something any real democracy does . 
  the referendum is not legal under spanish law , thus the referendum is not democratic . 
  enemies are terrorists , allies are liberators . 
  oh wow , first the planned seizure of san marco by armed men with a home built [ `` bulldozer-tank '' ] ( http://d2.dn-static.se/uploadedimages/2014/4/2/c2c2fc18-8af6-4a81-9bf2-be4bf0810287/original.jpg ) and now this . 
  lega nord should have their own sit-com , where they get into wacky adventures like these !, 
  many people of that particular sub culture are poorly educated rural people , ie more likely to either be actually racist or completely ignorant of and/or uninterested in any sort of political meaning of flags and symbols . 
  an important distinction is that there are also a lot of older swedish men who are in to vintage american cars , but who are not * raggare * .

  sverige is the euphoric atheist neutral land where moose and polar bears roam the streets , every girl is a heavenly beautiful blonde and every guy is so effeminate that he 's probably more attractive than your girls . 
  also , sverige has recently become almost 50 % islamic state with sharia laws due to feminist-immigration-politically correct-socialist-lbgt movements .

  hah , the sk\u00e5ne `` separatism '' is extremely fringe and mostly a joke because they talk funny and belonged to denmark around 350 years ago ... 
  the northern and eastern part painted in the same red and yellow color ( halland and blekinge ) also used to belong to denmark and i 've * never * heard of separatism from them even as a joke ... 
  how i wished sweden had the same idea about our defense . 
  but the vast majority of swedes think something like '' * eh , we would n't stand a chance against russia anyways , so money spent on our armed forces is money wasted . 
  * '' they simply do n't understand basic geopolitical concepts of how hypothetical hostilities would affect at least the whole nordic region and the baltics , or the idea of deterrence through making aggression too costly for the invader . 
  because the people does not understand this , politicians constantly cut funding from our defense , and in the event of hostilities we 'd need years to adapt from such the low , barely functioning level we have today . 
  unpopular political decision was made , legitimate peaceful protests erupted . 
  these were met with disproportionate violence instead of dialogue , both sides escalated to destruction and deaths . 
  russia uses bribing , bullying , and intimidation to force ukraine to do as it pleases . 
  a few years ago they turned off fuel deliveries in the middle of winter , killing hundreds as punishment against pro-eu government . 
  you 're not inclined to compromise with the puppet of a country that uses the military and annexes your territory . 
  one does not simply march into another sovereign nation 's territory and annex it . 
  it sets a dangerous precedent for justifying invasions of other sovereign nations . 
  well , sources seem more legit and comments less circlejerky/uninformed and moronic than most news or politics related subs i 've found so far .

  context and translation : the above is a poster for recruiting swedish volonteers to finland during their wars against the soviet union . 
  it translates to * `` the finnish cause is ours !, 
  '' * but as / u/loozerr says , today they 'd be more in a position to help us than vice versa ... 
  oh , the irony . 
  russia sends in troops to protect russians from ukrainian nationalist persecution . 
  who will protect the tatars from nationalist russian persecution ? 
  as a swede who constantly trips over romanian beggars , this really cracked me up !, 
  no , thankfully we have very strong institutions and regulatory mechanisms which limit the power of individual ministers . 
  meaning even if they 're incompetent , it 's hard for them to really fuck things up . 
  things like corruption and abuse of power are rare because of this , high transparency in the political process and a free critically examining media . 
  not to mention people like beatrice ask , who neither has any education * and * has n't even done any `` real work '' . 
  her only merit is being a party member for moderaterna ( centre/liberal party ) for a few decades . 
  and that 's our minister of justice ... 
  yes let 's just start world war iii because that would likely be a quick and easy solution without any negative consequences . 
  try actually reading comments you respond to . 
  free speech ? 
  like only allowing subscribers to vote and banning those who disagree ? 
  and speaking of racism , what would you call moderators using terms like ** [ turk race mixed muppet ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xunomin.png?1 ) ** ? 
  it 's only free speech critique of race mixing !, 
   why is n't `` encouraging mass murder '' illegal it most certainly is , but our hate-crime laws were created to protect minorities . 
  i 'd agree that hate speech laws should apply equally to any group including majority ones . 
  when it comes to defining who is protected under this hate law , the text includes intentionally vague definitions such as '' * ( ... ) or other such group * '' , which * could * include ethnic swedes , but as of yet that has n't been tried in a court of law . 
  what fria tider and / r/european is getting at is probably the myth that the powers that be does not recognize a swedish ethnicity or culture are actively trying to destroy replace us by multiculturalism . 
  furthermore , daesh is not running around freely distributing propaganda , in fact it 's contrary to the point where police visited a girl who recently celebrated her 21 : st birthday and put [ these ballons in her ] ( http://www.metro.se/_internal/gxml!0/r0dc21o2f3vste5s7ezej9x3a10rp3w$pkaoom22cd39yn1n568g2xxnpbx5d5r/isispuff.jpeg ) window . 
  spelling checks out , looks like danish to me . 
  - * admiral , we 're approaching scandinvia , a cold desolate place filled with the descendants of vikings and varangians . 
  should we proceed ? 
  * - * eh ... tell the cartographer to just wing it . 
  / r/european, 
   we have grown from a developing nation to a fully first world one . 
  losing your money hurts , but the truth is that now it 's out turn to pay our share to poland and romania and slovenia and so on . 
  this kind of solidarity is why i love the idea of the eu and why i support the project with all my heart despite all it 's bureaucratic , democratic and other flaws . 
  people like feeling like they are part of something greater , and having an enemy they can call inferior . 
  if not religion , then nation , political identity , culture , ethnicity or whatever . 
  the swedish word for bread , * br\u00f6d * also refers to dark bread , while white bread is called * franska * , which means french . 
  / r/mapporn should appreciate this !, 
  yeah some countries in the region such as morocco algeria and tunisia are pretty stable , but who knows what will happen as daesh 's influence keeps spreading . 
  probably a good idea to take a proactive stance . 
  ironic that someone with a belarus flair says they do n't see any problem ... 
  yeah , state media misinforming citizens with pure falsification of history and outright lies is perfectly valid . 
  saw op : s text and thought i was in / r/european ... 
  if i had to pick one : [ the full 1812 overture finale ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbxgylcnxe8 ) by tchaikovsky . 
  it is about a battle where russia defended against napoleon 's invading grande arm\u00e9e in 1812 . 
  it 's very theatrical storytelling that paints a musical picture of advancing armies and the ebb and flow of battle , it is bittersweet at times and triumphant at the thunderous ending , which features ringing town bells and booming cannon shots . 
  love it !,
