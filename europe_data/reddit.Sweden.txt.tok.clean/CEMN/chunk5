  europe belongs to the nordics !, 
  obvious / r/inglin mass infiltration . 
  you obviously took no time to read or address most of the issues brought up in the articles i linked , and neither do your links . 
  if the entire text of the agreement is made public for more than a year before its ratified , with strong possibilities of changing or cancelling it , sure that 's a good thing . 
  but i think a large dose of scepticism is healthy when it comes to an agreement so large and sweeping in powers over our everyday lives . 
  the answers in your euractiv link does nothing to address concerns about consumer protection , social rights , health , the environment and data protection , forced privatisation and generally the moving of power from elected government to multinational corporations . 
  the isds link is from 2013 , and correct me if i 'm wrong , but that could easily have changed since then ? 
  okay , please show me reputable sources that make me trust you over [ the independent ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/what-is-ttip-and-six-reasons-why-the-answer-should-scare-you-9779688.html ) , [ the international business times ] ( http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/ttip-how-new-secret-trade-treaty-could-put-worlds-biggest-firms-beyond-government-control-1432405 ) and [ the guardian ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/05/us-eu-trade-deal-the-guardian-briefing ) . 
  eh , probably . 
  does n't change what i wrote about ttip though . 
  in fact , we ca n't know anything since it includes * secret provisions * . 
  i am a liberal , firm believer in the benefits of free trade but i do n't trust any government to sign an accord not fully disclosed to the public . 
  and that is beyond things like allowing us companies to override and even sue our national governments if they find our regulations , such as those protecting the environment , harmful to their competition . 
  free trade , yes please . 
  but fuck ttip in it 's current incarnation . 
  reminds me of [ kimi r\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen ] ( http://wordpress.carthrottle.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/aauqr.jpg ) !, 
  what planet are you from ? 
  swedish military spending has been down since the fall of the soviet union and especially the unanimous decision by parliament to downsize in 1995 . 
  further spending cuts constantly continued under the liberal right government over the last 8 years . 
  yet somehow , everything 's to blame on the feminism of the current government , which is n't even administrating it 's own budget !, 
  did you not read your own source ? 
  '' * head of the swedish mali troops , lieutenant colonel carl-magnus svensson , ( ... ) says that expecting to eat the same food as back home in sweden is a `` luxury problem '' and adds that the swedish forces can not demand more food than other un units in timbuktu . 
  * '' is he the evil feminist running the government ? 
  you 're just wrong , rations are decided and provided by the un , the force commander says he has informed headquarters about the problems , but their bureaucracy has always been slow . 
  the swedish soldiers in the * united nations funded * mali peacekeeping mission are getting the standard un rations for that mission , which are arguably too small since they 're based on the needs of local soldiers . 
  there is enough money , there are reserves of canned food in sweden , but un regulations and slow bureaucracy in the defense headquarers are to blame , not the government . 
  the mission to train soldiers against daesh in iraq has nothing to do with the un funded peacekeeping mission in mali . 
  finally a solution to global warming !, 
  fuck nazis and fascists more though . 
  ( ( ( globalist elites ) ) ) ftfy, 
  it 's true that public opinion for increasing defense funding was low before 2014 , but has been increasing steadily since . 
  v thrives in opposition so will have little influence on policy , and ideologically they 're actually pro national defense so that we wo n't have to rely on `` imperialists '' like nato . 
  mp , although in government only got like 6 % of the vote and were only given influence over a few of their main political areas . 
  they got no influence at all over defense questions , they have had to accept whatever the social democrats wants . 
  afaik , no swedish politician wants to join nato without finland . 
  we 're resisting mostly for the same reasons as you do ( do n't poke the bear , do n't get dragged into the conflicts of others ) , except unlike you guys we do n't have a credible defense of our own . 
  [ popular support for nato is way below 50 % ] ( http://www.svd.se/svd-sifo-kraftigt-okat-motstand-mot-nato ) and swedish politics in general and defence politics especially tend to be very consensus oriented . 
  this is in regards both to popular opinion and parliamentary opinion . 
  resistance to nato comes from different perspectives : the far left and far right are similarly skeptical to losing sovereignty in general , environmentalists are pacifists and social democrats prefer scandinavian/finnish cooperation . 
  my personal opinion is that the centre-left is using nato as a distraction from discussing further increases to spending , which would probably mean high taxes , or at least no tax cuts , which will definitely not be in their platform . 
  najs , i 've been abroad on vacation for a little over a week so i have n't read much swedish media and everything i 've seen has been about trump . 
  can you link me some of those opinion pieces s\u00e5 \u00e4r du schysst !, 
  for the uninitiated : the party proposing this is named partido popular , abbreviated pp , which is pronunciated exactly like pepe . 
  nah , along with the rest of the world ( except finland , the baltics and poland ) we were sooo sure that after the fall of the soviet union , russia would either embark on the road of glorious free market capitalism and democracy and thus be peaceful , or remain poor , weak corrupt , and thus not a threat . 
  but then the centre-right government wanted to lower taxes as much as possible . 
  so they insisted on ignoring the fact that putin was becoming more and more authoritarian , their military build-up , the status incident in estonia , the invasion of georgia , and still did n't want to increase defense spending for the election half a year after the invasion of ukraine . 
  thankfully they lost . 
  i agree , but the pendulum has finally swung back to focusing on national defense and increased budgets . 
  it 's still too little , but hopefully this trend will increase along with deeper cooperation with you guys and the scandinavian and/or baltic nations . 
  uh yeah , sweden has been involved in different peace keeping missions almost constantly during the last 20 years . 
  bosnia , kosovo , afghanistan , chad , liberia , mali , the gulf of aden to name a few . 
  our previous government even decided that russia would likely never be a threat again so our defence was downsized and completely geared towards international deployments . 
  but after crimea/eastern ukraine the pendulum finally switched back and although it 's too little too late , the new government has changed back focus to national defence and increased the defence budget . 
  no i agree , i was calling for more of them !, 
  [ i was referencing this . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/taco_trucks_on_every_corner ) cevapcici and gyro trucks are mostly found during festivals and such . 
  ~ ~ taco ~ ~ cevapcici trucks on every corner !!, 
  and yes , i definitely agree on that . 
  luckily we already get our fill of quality pizza , kebab , falafel and other stuff mostly from our various immigrant communities . 
  we are lacking in balkan food though , which is strange what with the huge number of balkan immigrants in sweden . 
  i 'd kill for some cevapcici and gyros ... 
  it did n't stop my friends from being like : `` swedish food , music , culture etc is so bland compared to ours !, 
  i 'm a serb/croat/bosnian / whatever and i 'll marry a whatever girl and have whatever kids !, 
  but fuck moving back there , the country 's a corrupt shithole . 
  sweden for life ! '', 
  also ex-yugoslavs born around the 90 's , judging by the ones i 've met in sweden . 
  like the guys about as religiously observant as ozzy osbourne in his prime wearing gold jewelry of their selected faith and tattooing huge orthodox crosses to go with their other tattoos of eagles with too many heads and/or their last name in [ gta : san andreas font ] ( http://cs3.gtaall.com/screenshots/4dc09/2013-10/original/20a5bb66b56bd6fb0403f764b532084cb5bc771f/131708-oldengl.jpg ) . 
  i posted it mostly because it seems many people have never heard of it and thought it could be interesting for a broader european audience . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ms_estonia#protection_of_the_wreck  citing the practical difficulties and the moral implications of raising decaying bodies from the sea floor ( the majority of the bodies were never recovered ) , and fearing financial burden of lifting the entire hull to the surface and the salvage operation , the swedish government suggested burying the whole ship in situ with a shell of concrete . 
  [ 29 ] [ 30 ]  as a preliminary step , thousands of tons of pebbles were dropped on the site . 
  [ 28 ] the estonia agreement 1995 , a treaty among sweden , finland , estonia , latvia , poland , denmark , russia and the united kingdom , declared sanctity over the site , prohibiting their citizens from even approaching the wreck . 
  yeah this is seen as * the * national tragedy in sweden , along with the south east asian tsunami in 2004 . 
  over 500 swedes died in the estonia disaster and although i was too young to understand it 's scope , i can relate as it felt like everone knew someone out of the 700 swedes who died in thailand . 
  a teacher or two and several kids from my high school for example . 
  definitely eerie . 
  imagine such a large vessel sinking in 15 minutes . 
  impressive how everyone sounds so calm and professional . 
  [ m/s estonia mayday call , subtitled ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68iwvon8lby ), 
  some of the brexiters belong in the basket of deplorables . 
  and some , i assume , are good people . 
  you did n't read the article , and you did n't bother to use any dots or commas . 
  to which country do you suggest we deport nazi terrorists such as the ones referenced in the article ? 
  you should learn the difference between paraphrasing and strawmanning . 
  hahah this guy ... `` the jews may be lying about who 's been systematically attacking them for years ! '', 
  `` nazis might have been brown foreigner muslims in disguise ! '', 
  `` what , i 'm just being healthily sceptical ! '', 
  lol , no you 're not  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/636cz0/neonazi_threats_force_jewish_group_in_sweden_to/dfrqve1/, 
  i 'm pretty sure you 're sceptical because this not being muslims does n't fit your agenda . 
  stickers with links to nmr : s website , which also contains `` battle reports '' of nazi campaigning against them in the city for years . 
  do you believe the jews are lying about who is threatening them ? 
  do you think they 'd close down their community center without knowing ? 
  you mean besides the fact that the leader of the ume\u00e5 jewish community says so in the article ? 
  no one 's denying jews in sweden face persecution by some muslims ( the fact is even mentioned in the bbc article ) but that does n't mean you should ignore or jump to conclusions about swedish nazis .

   ** after threats from the nazis - jewish association puts down **  * after several threats from the nazis decided jewish association in ume\u00e5 on sunday that they will terminate their local and out of business . 
  *  * - it is because of the vulnerability and strong threats which are against us , says an upset carinne sj\u00f6berg , a spokesman for the jewish association in ume\u00e5 . 
  the association had on sunday called to a meeting to discuss whether they should close down by the growing threat against them . 
  all who attended the meeting agreed , and they came to a joint decision - the venue is terminated and the association are dropped . 
  that road was so cute , sad to see norweigian imperialists eat slovakia 's flag ... 
  i disagree , but i 'm biased of course !,
