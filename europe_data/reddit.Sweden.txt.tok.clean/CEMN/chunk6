  to me , danish sounds like trying to speak swedish while also coughing up a hair ball , and dutch sounds like trying to speak german while also coughing up a hair ball . 
  i imagine germans think dutch sound worse for that reason !, 
  yeah what 's up with that ? 
  `` ugliest language '' or `` lost most wars against sweden '' would be better . 
  thank you !, 
  like many others in this thread , i definitely believed hungary had low support for the eu because of \u00d3rban 's nationalist government . 
  interesting , could you link it to me ? 
  why would we be anti-eu ? 
  the swedish economy is extremely dependent on both export and import with the eu , so any renegotiation of trade agreements would likely cause economic disruptions and almost certainly a heavy recession . 
  there is of course what i believe is universal and valid criticism about how the eu bureaucracy functions and issues with representation and democracy , but on the other hand small nations like sweden does gain a lot of influence by being in the eu as well , which is something eu critics seem to forget . 
  when it comes to leaving the eu , only far left and far right wing populists are in favor . 
  in addition to the criticism above , the far leftists believe the union is too `` neoliberal '' when it comes to things like worker 's rights , exploiting the third world and so on , while for the far right meanwhile it 's mostly about refugees and immigrants taking our jerbs . 
  you mean if at first you do n't * secede * !, 
  haha , what 's with the 5 month necro post !, 
  i guess at that point they have to slightly detach themselves from what 's happening to remain calm . 
  especially the part where silja europa realizes there are people floating in the water around [ 12:13 ] ( https://youtu.be/68iwvon8lby?t=733 ) . 
  '' * they 're in the sea !, 
  * '' i.e. 
  yes , this is a catastrophy unfolding as we speak . 
  and i do n't know that the area was that accessible - it was midnight , 3-4 meter waves and hard winds . 
  but what scares me the most is n't what happened to people who got off , but rather everyone in their cabins , on the dance floor , a restaurant etc. 
  who are suddenly being thrown around the ship like a piece of meat with chairs , tables and other people crashing into you , followed by water flooding in , slowly drowning everyone . 
  stuff of nightmares ... 
  thanks for your answer !, 
  what i 'm trying to answer is if the station leans in a certain way in regards to immigration , as the swedish source aftonbladet ( which only repeats what is said in the danish one ) is left wing and specifically pro-immigration . 
  if the danish source leans right and/or is known to be credible on immigration , then any attack on aftonbladet as partial on this story can be d\u00edsregarded . 
  i 'll copypaste my comments from the thread in / r/sweden : 1 . 
  yes , sweden has problems with immigration and integration . 
  no , it 's not as bad as certain actors would have you believe . 
  yes , this is an obvious russian attempt of spreading propaganda . 
  no , not everything negative about immigration and integration in sweden can be blamed on russian conspiracies . 
  see 1 . 
  ***** the russian news corp ntv was formerly a somewhat kremlin critical , privately owned station which faced pressure from the russian government until state owned energy giant gazprom bought it , shut down programs critical of the kremlin and changed its focus from news and society to entertainment . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ntv_ ( russia ) the danish news company which originally reported this story seems to be right wing oriented ? 
  could any danes verify or deny this ? 
   we have anti-propaganda laws limiting activity and those laws are actively being used as excuses for persecuting lbgt people in russia as per hrw above . 
   it was revealed that some of them had hostile purposes do you have any non-russian-state affiliated source for this ? 
  are you saying hrw , one of the world 's most reputable ngo : s is `` openly hostile '' ? 
   ** russia : anti-lgbt law a tool for discrimination ** ( 2014 )  ( new york ) -- russia 's anti-gay `` propaganda '' law has served as a tool for anti-gay discrimination in the year since it entered into force , even though russian authorities have fined only four people for violating it . 
  the law 's adoption also coincided with the spread of violence and harassment of lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender ( lgbt ) people and lgbt rights activists and a rise in homophobic hate speech by some russian officials and public figures , human rights watch research found . 
   the law , passed unanimously by the russian parliament , entered into force on june 30 , 2013 . 
  it bans the dissemination among children of `` propaganda for nontraditional sexual relationships , '' broadly understood to be lesbian , gay , and bisexual relationships . 
  the law denies lgbt people equal social standing and implies that their identities and relationships are unnatural and perverse , human rights watch said . 
  https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/06/29/russia-anti-lgbt-law-tool-discrimination ** sexual orientation and gender identity ** ( 2017 )  authorities continued to implement discriminatory policies and laws against lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender ( lgbt ) people . 
   in march , police found journalist and theater critic dmitry tsilikin dead in his st. petersburg apartment from stab wounds . 
  the perpetrator , arrested a week later , confessed that he planned to blackmail tsilikin about his homosexuality , but killed him during a confrontation . 
  the police did not categorize the killing as a hate crime . 
   in january , a court in murmansk , northwestern russia , found lgbt activist sergei alekseenko guilty of violating the discriminatory `` gay propaganda '' law which prohibits allowing children access to positive information about lgbt relationships . 
  the court called several publications on the website of an lgbt organization formerly run by alekseenko `` gay propaganda '' and fined him 100,000 rubles ( us$ 1,300 ) . 
   authorities continued legal action against deti-404 , an online support group for lgbt children . 
  in april , a court in the siberian town of barnaul ruled to ban the website . 
  as of november , deti-404 's website remained blocked . 
   in september , a court in siberia ruled to block bluesystem.ru , a highly popular lgbt news site . 
  as of november , the site was blocked . 
  interesting , you should post this to / r/geopolitics !, 
  just make sure you write a submission statement or the thread will be locked . 
  bbc is one of the world 's most reputable media organizations 2 . 
  it 's a direct quote from the russian defense minister ... 
  now :  russia 's military has admitted for the first time the scale of its information warfare effort , saying it was significantly expanded post-cold war . 
  defence minister sergei shoigu said that russian `` information troops '' were involved in `` intelligent , effective propaganda '' , but he did not reveal details about the team or its targets . 
   the admission follows repeated allegations of cyberattacks against western nations by the russian state . 
  nato is reported to be a top target . 
  '' * all this talk of russia meddling in european affairs are just paranoid russophobic conspiracy theories !, 
  you 're talking about firefights in a combat situation ; i 'm talking about 1 . 
  police interacting with kids throwing rocks 2 . 
  military guarding in peace time or on a peace keeping mission . 
  roe : s differ and do not always allow lethal force . 
  but please for the love of god come to sweden and educate our police and armed forces , they 're in desperate need of your knowledge . 
  i just hope you 're not a patronizing cunt in every social interaction in real life as you are on the internet . 
  from my source :  double taps are an integral part of the el presidente combat pistol shooting drill developed by jeff cooper in the 1970s and published in the january/february 1979 issue of american handgunner . 
  [ 5 ] ** also developed by cooper in the 1970s is the mozambique drill ** or failure drill , for a situation where a double-tap to the torso fails to stop an attacker , adding a third shot to the head . 
  [ 6 ] the discussion at hand was whether the swedish police shot live fire with out lethal intentions , but you 're still being arrogant . 
   again , though , one must bow to mighty ... sweden ... in matters of armed conflict , eh ? 
  you 've failed to provide any sources for your statements so i 'll just conclude you 're an [ opinionated keyboard warrior ] ( http://new3.fjcdn.com/comments/for+you+_97b2c8495c0b1a4c491e3fda235808ce.jpg ) who thinks he can educate someone with actual military training . 
  [ my source is the guard 's manual of the swedish armed forces ] ( redacted ) and what we learned from our instructors of course . 
  i 'll leave the joy of transcribing and google translating to you , but you can see a nice picture of a guard shooting even a person with a firearm in the leg because of the roe not allowing lethal force in this example . 
  [ the two in the chest , one in the head ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/double_tap ) is an actual technique used by armed forces all over the world . 
  you 're being arrogant and sound more like a keyboard warrior than someone who know what he 's speaking about . 
  what are your own sources ? 
  we had different rules of engagement for different situations of course . 
  this was the general ordering in `` low threat '' circumstances , like guarding a weapons storage facility on base , or during a peace keeping mission where you do n't want to accidently start murdering confused civilians . 
  in a more hostile situation the roe could be changed to for example '' * shoot to kill on sight anyone not in swedish uniform , armed or unarmed * '' . 
  [ wrong ] ( https://media.giphy.com/media/3oz8xld9djq2l2vftu/giphy.gif ) . 
  i served in the military for a year and in our guard training we were taught the stairway of escalation in case of an unauthorized person approaching : 1 . 
  give vocal order to halt ; 2 . 
  a warning shot slightly in front and to the side ; 3 . 
  if carrying a melee weapon of any kind - shoot at the legs . 
  if carrying a ranged weapon of any kind - shoot to kill , two shots in the chest , one in the face . 
  no , misappropriating public funds , refusing to pay them back and accusing the justice system of persecution is hardly democratic . 
  seems to be the norm in the western world these days ... 
   french police were searching the headquarters of marine le pen 's far-right front national west of paris on monday in relation to an investigation into the alleged misuse of european union funds to pay parliamentary assistants , an fn official told reuters . 
   earlier this month le pen refused the demand to repay nearly $ 300,000 ( # 258,000 ) of eu funds that a european parliament investigation alleged she misspent . 
   le pen described the demand as `` a unilateral decision taken by political opponents ... without proof and without waiting for a judgment from the court action i have started '' . 
  aww , poor girl ca n't even misappropriate funds without the evil establishment persecuting her . 
  good thing russia is so generously supporting her !, 
  sure , but none of that matters if president trump and his cronies decides the baltic states are n't worth spilling american blood over . 
  i could rephrase myself to `` america * under the trump administration * is n't a reliable ally '' if that makes my point any clearer to you . 
   germany is to lead the nato battalion in lithuania , with up to 600 soldiers , joined by another 400 from belgium , croatia , france , luxembourg , the netherlands , and norway . 
  what happened over 8 decades ago is n't as relevant in 2017 as electing an administration that threatens to abandon the alliance , a president who repeatedly praises putin 's `` strong leadership '' , with pro-russian businessman tillerson as secretary of state , pro-russian general flynn as national security advisor , who had to resign for colluding to remove sanctions on russia . 
  i 'm not talking about canada , i 'm talking about the trump administration 's explicit threats to allies in europe and asia .
