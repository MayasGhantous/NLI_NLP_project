  also , i 'm talking from the point of view of the entire european geopolitical theatre rather than sweden . 
  in fact comparing a tiny nation to the world 's only superpower is pretty pointless , especially since sweden has been nominally neutral for over 200 years . 
  thanks for the links . 
  at least he did n't threaten to not honour american commitments to european allies . 
  how do you argue that an ally that has repeatedly puts its defense commitments in doubt and even threatens to remove their support altogether is n't unreliable ? 
  you ca n't deny that the current administration has done this to allies both in regards europe and south east asia . 
  mattis is right that europe - nato members or not - should increase their defense spending and not rely too much on unpredictable and unreliable allies like the united states . 
  but competent statesmen would apply this kind of pressure on their allies in talks behind closed doors rather than in front of the world and emboldening russia , especially right now with the russian revelations unfolding in washington . 
  no but if i had a copy of the iranian lawbook i could probably show you what applies to visitors . 
  and although foreign government representatives could refuse if they wanted to , they 're there to promote business cooperation , not antagonize their hosts . 
  what 's your point ? 
  we 're talking about diplomatic relations , not the justice system ? 
  iran has laws for what people should wear so it 's a matter of following the law , not assimilating to its culture . 
  iran has laws for what people should wear so it 's a matter of following the law , not assimilating to its culture . 
  proving my point . 
  they did n't follow custom , and the result was offending the host . 
  that 's a false equivalence . 
  first , diplomats are n't immigrants and second , why would we force anyone to take anything off ? 
  our laws do not dictate what people can wear . 
  and your assertion that `` iranian/muslim immigrants do n't remove their headscarves in sweden '' is n't 100 % true either as some actuality do because they 're free to do so . 
  as for iranian law , it requires women to cover their hair in some way and foreigners like these government representatives wear the minimum required scarves with plenty of hair showing while still conforming to diplomatic etiquette . 
  no , but observing basic customs of the host country is usually expected in diplomatic missions . 
  thank you , had to scroll down way too far to find people with some sense . 
  reddit loves circlejerking about sweden muslims and feminism . 
  this is n't feministiskt initiativ , these are members of government from socialdemokraterna and milj\u00f6partiet . 
  this is so stupid . 
  they swedish government is n't immigrating to iran , they 're on a diplomatic mission and we have important trade relations and social issues aside its good to have stable relations to one of he few actually stable states in the region . 
  yeah the mra/anti feminist angle factors into it . 
  nationalists tend to dislike anything that give women to many rights which distract them from their natural duty of producing pure children of course . 
  nationalists love masturbating to the idea of evil dark hairy foreigners raping pure nordic blonde women . 
  what are you even talking about ? 
  elderly people are n't that much more conservative as far as i know . 
  there 's probably more of the '' * i do n't like it , but it 's really not my business either * '' sentiment than 100 % acceptance . 
  same goes for the very few religious people , our main ( formerly state ) church is very accepting as well . 
  social conservatism is just rare in sweden in general . 
  what ? 
  swedes have been open-minded about sex in general for decades , and tend to consider sexuality a very private thing . 
  giving a fuck about what two consenting adults do in private feels wierd . 
  we 've got the right to say that , internet time passes at least three times faster than regular time . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hh01fkh8oia sorry for the quality , this is an ancient meme so handle with care . 
  it 's like how swedish nazis debate the anti-muslim party sweden democrats , which supports israel and has a few officials of jewish heritage or jewish relatives . 
  worth a vote to combat the immediate muslim threat or dangerously furthering the secret agenda of swedish zionists ? 
  a tough nut to crack for nazi top minds !, 
  those barbarians do not represent swedish pizza !, 
  traditional swedish pizza is made by middle eastern immigrants and [ looks like this ] ( http://kebabkungen.se/skovde/alpina/kp4/kp4.jpg ) . 
  thin crust , kebab , chicken or other meat , garlic sauce and a side of [ pizzasallad ] ( https://matmorsan.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dsc_1371.jpg ) . 
  if you 're really hungry , go ahead and add a [ whole bowl of sallad and some french fries on top ] ( http://i.imgur.com/d3nkkjc.jpg ) . 
  those pizzas are a crime against culinary law . 
  i 'm swedish and even i 'm offended . 
  no it 's worse than what they do to our neighbours , as well as the occasional nato detour through our airspace . 
  [ russia practiced nuking sweden a few years back ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/12139943/russia-simulated-a-nuclear-strike-against-sweden-nato-admits.html ) . 
  what he says is essentially '' * an authoritarian strongman is better than chaos . 
  * '' which is the foundation of legitimacy of dictators and poorly functioning democracies all over the world . 
  '' * without me there will be crime and terrorism , our nothing works , our country was once great and i will make it great again !, 
  * '' sound familiar ? 
  accountability is an important part of being a functioning democracy . 
  a system where politicians can and do vote to excuse themselves from corruption is evidence of a malfunctioning democracy . 
  89,3 % of all statistics are made up on the spot . 
   and no , russia wo n't invade gotland . 
  surely russia would n't invade georgia or ukraine either . 
  no one would have believed that , until it happened . 
  even if the probability is low , the problem is sweden almost abolished it 's defense after 1991 because `` russia will never be a threat again '' . 
  we do n't think russia will be aggressive towards us tomorrow , but in 5 years , 10 years ? 
  who knows . 
  and since building our defense takes time we have to be sceptic and prepare today . 
  same thing with our sweden democrats . 
  they vote pro-russia every occasion they get and recently had to fire a highly suspicious aide from russia , working under a swedish sounding pseudonym .

  okay , but is it known that the car actually flied away like that , or is this a colorful exaggeration for the movie ? 
  i lived in spain and attended the whole year of * segundo de bachillerato * in a cultural exchange . 
  i remember we were taught about this incident and pictures of a huge crater . 
  upon googling , yeah that [ crater was pretty fucking huge ] ( http://madrilanea.com/wp-content/uploads/4175361.jpg ) so it might be plausible that the explosion launched the car a quite bit ... 
  wait , is that actual footage of the car bomb ? 
   illegaly occupied by ukraine and that 's where i stopped taking you seriously . 
   a referendum is pretty meaningless when held in an illegally seized territory under occupation, 
  * you * brought up nukes in response to a post where i said russia would most likely * not * use nukes 2 . 
  what the us did during ww2 in japan has little relevance to the geopolitical situation in the baltic sea 70 years later 3 . 
  russia * has * : - [ updated their nuclear doctrine to be more aggerssive ] ( https://www.csis.org/analysis/russia%e2%80%99s-nuclear-doctrine ) ; - [ directly threatened denmark with nukes ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/russia-threatens-denmark-with-nuclear-weapons-if-it-tries-to-join-nato-defence-shield-10125529.html ) ; - [ practised nuclear bombing runs against sweden ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/12139943/russia-simulated-a-nuclear-strike-against-sweden-nato-admits.html ) . 
  i still do n't believe russia , or any other stable world power for that matter , would ever actually use nukes except in an end-of-the-world-scenario . 
  but it is undeniable russia is carrying out nuclear threats and posturing more aggerssively than the soviet union did after the cuban missile crisis . 
  a referendum is pretty meaningless when held in an illegally seized territory under occupation, 
   yeah but what about the us, 
  ... is not enough . 
  gotland is strategically important for the same reason . 
  you 're probably correct , but do you have a good source where i can read more about numbers relating to the geopolitical situation in europe please ? 
  not when talking about baltic security and stability specifically, 
  russia definitely wants access to the baltic sea and airspace . 
  and again , an invasion wo n't even happen from the start if they do n't believe benefits would outweigh the costs . 
  bleeding out an occupying force has been the strategy for both sweden ( although we were on the way of practically abolishing our defense since 1995 ) and finland since world war 2 . 
  even russia would face popular resistance from the costs of occupation and if there kept coming home caskets of dead soldiers , not to mention the effects of crippling sanctions . 
  what they 're facing in sanctions since crimea is pretty weak compared to fully freezing their foreign assets , not giving out visas and everything else the world could impose on them . 
  what 's your source for those numbers ? 
  is that 72 % of us spending counted as the usa : s total capacity , as nato commitments or as forces assigned specifically to europe ? 
  because those would make very different percentages .
