  the media exaggerates for ratings , yes , but their reporting is based on statements from the swedish armed forces . 
  given the fact that this happened only six months after the russian invasion of crimea and russian backed rebels shooting down a passenger jet , it was n't strange that people reacted strongly . 
  and the incident definitely was n't `` something completely different '' . 
  the military has officially confirmed a foreign submarine illegally entered waters outside of one of our main naval bases . 
  as a southerner , j\u00e4garna and pistvakt are my main cultural references to norrland . 
  are you telling me they 're not accurate portrayals !, 
  finland could definitely resist for more than 48 hours . 
  the cost for invading and occupying a country with so much forest and wetlands ( where tanks and aircraft are less effective and moving infantry is slow and dangerous ) through military resistance would hugely outweigh the benefits . 
  and you ca n't just go `` surrender or we 'll nuke you ! '' . 
  that 's not how it works . 
  the whole world would unite to cripple russia through sanctions , not to mention how much damage to russia the fallout would cause . 
  i mean both st petersburg and moscow are practically next door neighbors to helsinki . 
  edit : wrong order words i put, 
  all opposition to liberal immigration policy is not associated with russia . 
  but for some reason nationalist media tend to be very uncritical in repeating the kremlin world view . 
  i agree with most of your post , but not the part about maintaining good relationships and trade with russia , which definitely is the best guarantee for peace and stability . 
  and i 'm not entirely convinced us joining nato is a good idea . 
  finland seems to have a great defense on their own precisely because they 're not relying on anyone but themselves in an extreme situation . 
  but it should be possible to do this while also maintaining a healthy scepticism towards them , at least as long as russia has more to lose on bad a relationship with us than than we do - for example , by building pipelines and becoming dependent on russian energy exports . 
  check out : - j\u00e4garna , crime thriller set in the rural north : http://m.imdb.com/title/tt0116736/ - arn , historical drama trilogy about a swede joining up with the knights templar : http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0837106/ - snabba cash , crime film about different people connected by the booming cocaine trade in stockholm : http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1291652/, 
  i disagree , i see swedish populist far right media and far left pacifists repeat the exact same talking talking points as the kremlin . 
  `` being afraid of russia is russophobia and paranoia !, 
  nato is just as bad !, 
  the us is just as bad !, 
  crimeans were actually in favor of joining russia !, 
  the invasion of ukraine was justified to prevent a nato coup !, 
  nato has been building their bases to surround russia ! '', 
  * major crimes ? 
  yep the word is exactly the same in swedish !, 
  * rik * means rich . 
  til !, 
  an antiquated swedish term for money which is still used colloquially is * riksdaler * ( * rike * = kingdom ) . 
  i always suspected our * daler * had the same origin as dollar . 
  [ south korea shows how it 's done ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbfsvh1mmiw ) !, 
   nato expansions and us interventionism do look like a threat i 've never understood how people believe this myth . 
  do you think any western or other state for that matter would invade russia , with it 's huge military and especially , nuclear arsenal ? 
  no , russia believes it has a god given right to control it 's neighbours , and it just so happens many of it 's neighbours prefer freely joining the west in eu and nato than becoming russian satellite states . 
  imma start using that . 
  r/europe should do like r/politics and ban `` articles '' purely rehosting content .

  and here i thought it could be a viable alternative to the inhumane traditional spanish bullfighting . 
  i watched it on tv and it looks really cool . 
  do they sedate the bull before killing it ? 
  because then i 'd have no problem with it ( except for hurting it before the fight ) , or i 'd be a hypocrite for eating meat . 
  when non-muslims do it it 's just poor misadjusted people suffering from mental disorders . 
  so what you meant to say is we need more mental disorders !,

  impressive !, 
  your graph says nothing about decline in relation to hdi , economic development and so forth . 
  as i said , fertility decreases as hdi , the economy etc. 
  improves , which it is n't uniformly across the continent . 
  [ here 's data from the un ] ( https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/fertility-vs-human-development-index ) , comparing hdi and fertility only . 
  there is a very clear trend . 
   many african nations have this idea that `` kids are a kid from god '' . 
  furthermore , if you are rich , it is expected that you have a big family , 10 + kids , possibly multiple wives . 
  as people become richer , this religious idea actually encourages them to have more kids . 
  source on this and particularly that this has a noticeable effect on african populations ? 
  edit : spelling, 
  how popular is the portuguese humane acrobatic version in spain ? 
  could you see it replacing the traditional spanish version ? 
  the population boom is expected to diminish as income and hdi increases . 
  there is a wealth of empirical data confirming this ( on mobile so ca n't link , but google something like `` fertility human development income ) . 
  one reason is that people in poor countries see children as the guarantee of their future welfare - a small child up to 3 or 4 does n't cost a lot to raise , and they are expected to help out with work around the home or the fields as they grow older . 
  furthermore , with high child mortality you get even more children to be safe . 
  this is why humanitarian projects in africa tend to focus on education , sanitation , medicine and infrastructure . 
  health and opportunity for economic development will stop overpopulation by itself . 
  finally , when africans get access to better coverage of the west , they 'll likely also notice our problems with too many immigrants and growing hostility towards them . 
  our national anthem is actually about how beautiful our country is and the glorious century or so when we were a major european power . 
  the lyrics of the second verse , freely translated :  * you reign atop the memories of days of ancient glory *  * when your name flew across the world in honour *  * i know that you are and remain what you were *  * i want to live and die in the north *  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lin57nfjfw that sort of patriotism feels hilariously out of place in a tiny country which has been very anti flag waving nationalism since the postwar era . 
  edit : grammar, 
  i 'm willing to bet the americans was n't practicing attacks or nuclear bombing runs against us like the russians usually do though . 
  how about w. bush , rumsfeld and mike pence 's rolemodel dick cheney ? 
  yes , my point was that neither the usa nor russia are members . 
  bill clinton was one of the original founders , but w. bush did n't want his soldiers held accountable in afghanistan and iraq so he left the icc . 
  [ and lo and behold ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/nov/15/us-army-and-cia-may-be-guilty-of-war-crimes-afghanistan-says-icc ) ... 
  just like the usa . 
  `` war crimes are n't war crimes when we do it . '', 
  just to clear things out , it is very unlikely that sweden would join nato . 
  first of all , there seems to be agreement between sweden and finland that [ one of the countries should n't consider joining without the other ] ( http://www.nato.int/docu/review/2016/also-in-2016/nato-membership-finland-sweden/en/index.htm ) . 
  secondly , swedish parliamentary and public support for joining nato is low . 
  although all four parties of the centre-right coalition * alliansen * , who will possibly win the elections of 2018 are pro nato , swedish defense politics have traditionally been very consensus oriented and every other party , representing around half the electorate is firmly against . 
  furthermore , while public opinion for nato membership had an upswing after the invasion of ukraine in 2014 and the suspected russian submarine violation of swedish waters in november of the same year , support for nato has been on a strong downwards trend since 2015 . 
  [ popular opinion on nato membership was 49 % against and 33 % for as of july 2016 ] ( http://images-4.svd.se/v2/images/ddb8055c-2389-435c-819f-1f2cf67b2c3f?h=833&amp;q=60&amp;w=1250&amp;s=b7b0331235ba205bb37a2a7abdf803c5dd393666 ) .

  why is hungarian support so high ? 
  i thought they hated the eu . 
   mildly pro russia candidate uh ... recognizing the invasion of crimea , ending sanctions , threatening to remove military support from europe ? 
  mildly ? 
  like all these shit sites that popped up during the us election : - less than 1 year old , oftentimes less than 6 months , in some cases only 2-3 - all focusing exclusively on praising trump and attacking clinton - all appear in the_donald either on the first submission or within a handful of the first few submissions - many first submitted by users that 're either obviously from the sites being posted or who have account registration dates that tie in pretty closely with the registrations of the sites they 're posting - many of them share the same cookie-cutter page layouts - when registrant data is available , many of them share the same geographical locations or owners , and sites that profess a particular focus in us affairs are often halfway around the world in the likes of macedonia sources here : https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5b013v/reddit_users_declare_war_on_hillarys_paid/d9kotxa/,
