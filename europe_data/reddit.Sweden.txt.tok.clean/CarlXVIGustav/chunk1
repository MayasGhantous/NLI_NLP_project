hopefully armed citizens will * happen * . 
  please tell everyone you know * not * to vote for us . 
  when we start losing , people will lose interest . 
  not just the hockey team , a combined military would be amazing !, 
  you have the artillery , we have the air force . 
  together we could actually be a competent defence force !, 
  plus , cooperation could put pressure on our cheap-ass politicians to actually focus on military spending so that we do n't put finland in danger . 
  i love you finland . 
  i 'm sorry we 're terrible neighbours . 
  fantastic work !, 
  can you make one with which countries mention war in their national anthem ? 
  cut them in half and count their rings . 
  works every time . 
  they all turn out to either be 1 , or change their story to be 30 . 
  not quite true . 
  age testing was being done , but due to sheer numbers not everyone could be tested , and the tests were questioned concerning their accuracy . 
  what outraged me was that nothing seems to happen to people who later got caught lying about their age/identity . 
  i 'm strongly opposed to current immigration , * and * the idea that anyone under 18 is permitted to stay . 
  vikings invade borders , not personal boundaries . 
  hey , i 'm as upset as you about the apparent censorship . 
  but / u/i _ stole_your_puppy said absolutely nothing that would imply s/he supported the current case - quite the opposite in fact . 
  all s/he did was mention a second alternative to why the powers-that-be decided to pursue this case like they have . 
  i 'm not so sure about that , but then again i know very little about scotland and scottish attitudes . 
  according to the police statement it 's all about the anti-immigrant opinions expressed . 
  i guess we 'll have to await the trial to see what it 's all about . 
  regardless of which it is , i 'm deeply concerned about the censorship it entails . 
  unless it happens to be an [ idiom ] ( http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/spit-in-the-eye-or-face-of ) ( which it is , ca n't say how this guy meant it though ) . 
  similar to , but much tamer , compared to someone writing `` the new pressure cooker i bought is the bomb , man ! '', 
  or `` i 've been practising all week - i 'll be killing on the dance floor this weekend ! '', 
  and getting arrested for it . 
  oh yes , he expressed opinions you do n't agree with . 
  clearly censorship is then ok in this case . 
  except it 's not . 
  nothing short of direct threats should be censored in an open society . 
  this is just a crackdown on free speech . 
  we 've had a lot of censorship , propaganda and crackdown on freely expressing opinions with regards to the refugee crisis . 
  it 's getting quite sickening , even if you or i find some of the expressed sentiments offensive . 
  ah , i misunderstood you then . 
  i did find a tweet saying [ this was what he wrote ] ( https://twitter.com/liamutlr/status/698581550842146816/photo/1 ) . 
  if that 's what he got arrested for , we have a true totalitarian censorship in motion , which is * utterly * disgusting . 
  if these were some of his messages , they 're tame compared to what 's written here on reddit . 
  this is pure unadulterated censorship of the highest degree from the uk . 
  http://mashable.com/2016/02/16/refugees-rothesay-man-arrested/ https://twitter.com/liamutlr/status/698581550842146816/photo/1, 
  considering everyone else in this thread is desperately trying to find out what he wrote , and you seem to know what it was ... what did he write ? 
  i would n't go so far as to call them educated . 
  * `` sir , i have n't killed a person in all my life !, 
  so i followed my desires and bombed a playground . 
  a little mistake , i admit , but i 'm sure you understand . 
  countries are allowed to protect their * citizens * . 
  we 're talking about stopping people who have n't even been granted asylum from entering sensitive areas where lots of refugees have committed molestation and rape . 
  they can still cancel the asylum process and leave the country if the so choose . 
  age of consent is not the same as forcing marriage with an older man on a child . 
  age of consent simply dictates when a person is considered old enough to make decisions about sex . 
  yes , as in `` political correctness trumps all , and mass-immigration must not be objected against '' . 
  and reports of prioritising asylum seekers ahead of the german population . 
  in sweden the supposedly `` neutral '' parties ( news media , police , migration agency , etc ) have decided to take a pro-immigration stance through propaganda , coverups and social intimidation . 
  so , as i said ... sick political climate . 
  well , we also have sweden where police covered up a massive sexual assault in stockholm . 
  and where they report asylum seeker crimes in a special crime code to hide them . 
  police in sweden have zero reliability , so there 's no point in waiting for their `` investigations '' . 
  given that germany seem to have an equally sick political climate , i would n't be surprised if the same thing happened there . 
  most news outlets do n't have a comment section at all . 
  the guardian should be praised for having one . 
  what * is * concerning is the selective shut down of a comment section where the large media houses have shown to have a heavy bias and propaganda-like reporting . 
  because you wrote :  you cant deport your citizens . 
  and i 'm providing evidence that apparently some countries can quite handily do just that . 
  what do n't you understand ? 
  i 'm just saying that apparently you * can * deport your citizen , if you 're smart about it . 
  oh , the irony of a german being the first one to resort to godwin 's law . 
  the eu is a joke . 
  it does n't have that kind of power . 
  [ you could just google , like the rest of us ] ( https://www.google.se/search?q=babel+fish+symbol&amp;safe=off&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=971&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjl7ugs6t7oahwknjokhsvtcd8q_auibigb#safe=off&amp;tbm=isch&amp;q=jesus+fish+bumper ) . 
  seems to work great for afghanistan , iraq and morocco who refuse to take their own citizen back . 
  calling people with opposing opinions `` dimwitted xenophobes and closet-racists '' is an action that can * actually * cause a divide and drive people into the arms of such groups . 
  being mindful of your own culture and society is not `` xenophobic '' or `` racist '' . 
  actually , the us has used persuasion campagins and fear tactics to try to get sweden to join nato . 
  so contrary to your point , ` nato ' * does * point fingers and say they want x to join . 
  what a military alliance needs is a tight military cooperation and clear directives , * not * a superpower doing all the work . 
  much like the sweden/switzerland confusion . 
  though spanish-speakers may have trouble too with its suecia/suiza . 
  strictly speaking the magnet link sites are n't even illegal since they do n't host any copyrighted material . 
  but corrupt , technologically inept judges and massively rich lobbyists think differently . 
  i guess they have to learn the horrible lesson themselves that we in europe learned during the 20th century . 
  to think they died to protect us and democracy feels terribly hollywoodian and propaganda-like . 
  i see it more as a reminder of the horrors of war . 
  yes , the parliament get to say yes or no . 
  how * extremely * democratic . 
  so we elect governments ( majority approval for the certain country ) , the leaders of the governments ( minority approval ) then get to elect eu commissioners with executive powers . 
  and that strikes you as democratic ? 
  the parliament is the only democratic part of the eu . 
  and they 're not the main decision makers , the european commission is . 
  so what is the european commission ? 
  a minority of votes in each country with * party appointed * , not elected , leaders . 
  sure . 
  really democratic . 
  the eu is functional as a trade union , but is a joke if you 're talking about democracy . 
  the uk , as an american puppet state , has fervently been pushing ttip onto the eu . 
  the uk leaving means germany and france will have a far easier time simply refusing that piece of shit legislation . 
  i do n't know , the f-35 looks a bit stubby and pudgy .
