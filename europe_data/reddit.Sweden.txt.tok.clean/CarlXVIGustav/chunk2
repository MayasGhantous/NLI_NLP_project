  [ they really are tiny ] ( https://defenseissues.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/visual.jpg ) . 
  which is actually an advantage , as it has a smaller radar signature , among other things . 
  nope . 
  ancient sailors were the first ones to point out their discovery of a seemingly round earth . 
  erastosthenes even did a good estimation of our planets circumference using shadows and trigonometry . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  there 's only one true * kingindanorf * !, 
  king carl xvi gustaf . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ ^ biased . 
  and here i was trying to save your statement that europe is past hostile conquering , and you go and shit on my save . 
  nice , real nice . 
  it 's worrying that we 're so uncoordinated that we do n't even know what to call ourselves . 
  king in the north !, 
  well , russia is mostly on the asian continent . 
  and now you know how it is that we used to be a superpower !, 
  ^ ^ oh ^ ^ hello ^ ^ norway , ^ ^ we 'll ^ ^ just ^ ^ move ^ ^ you ^ ^ a ^ ^ little ^ ^ bit . 
  ^ ^ ^ oh ^ ^ ^ hi ^ ^ ^ poland , ^ ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ moving ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ little ^ ^ ^ bit ^ ^ ^ too . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ just , ^ ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ ^ know ... ^ ^ ^ ^ moving ^ ^ ^ ^ you . 
  i 've never been at a protest before . 
  but if they smoked weed and ate pancakes ? 
  i 'd protest the dutch every waking hour !, 
  we 'll survive well past 2030 unless something * truly * cataclysmic happens , like a planetary collision , direct-hit gamma ray burst or similar . 
  global warming and nuclear war ? 
  that * could * kill us , but very very slowly . 
  i always find it so sweetly ironic when people who claim they want unity , freedom and open borders say everyone that disagree with them can just move/go away . 
  that does n't sound very free and inclusive at all . 
  it sounds like you want an echo-chamber and a dictatorship that just happen to represent your opinions . 
  if your response to opposition is to try to shut your opponent up instead of responding to their argument , your stance is probably not worth a lot . 
  that 's the most famous example though . 
  and although russia certainly do their `` fair share '' of airborne and submersible incursions , nato does too . 
  apparently the us did plenty of submersible incursions during the cold war , in an attempt to drive sweden into nato . 
  it seems like powerful nations tend to not respect borders , we just consider some of those breaches less serious . 
  i do n't know about sabotage , but a lot of submarine activity in swedish waters - that was at the time thought to be russian - has been attributed to american attempts to drive sweden into nato . 
  his comment does n't add anything to the discussion . 
  there 's no points to be argued in that comment , it 's just a `` yes '' . 
  oh absolutely , the humanitarian disaster that will arise from global warming will make the current migrant crisis pale in comparison . 
  i guess it 's good that we got a `` practice run '' , in a sense . 
  but what i 'm blaming merkel ( and the swedish politicians ) of is openly pouring petrol on the immigration fire with their promise of permanent residencies and welfare . 
  people who were n't even in the most need of aid started their journey to take advantage of the deal . 
  we had economic migrants instead of humanitarian migrants , and often not those humanitarian migrants in most dire need of asylum in a western nation . 
  i do n't blame the migrants for escaping the then-underfunded refugee camps - i again blame the german and swedish government . 
  it was another effect of the massive expensive immigration , that made funding the refugee camps impossible . 
  it was absurd to see it unfold and see the politicians keep saying `` you 're welcome here , we can accept everyone ! '', 
  while the coffers ran dry and the systems failed . 
  that laid the foundation of it , it did n't cause it . 
  claiming everyone that could get to germany and sweden would get permanent residence permits , and refusing to dispel the rumours spread by the human smugglers about the welfare states caused the giant wave of immigrants . 
  most did n't even come from the war-torn syria . 
  people came from the relative safety of iraq and afghanistan . 
  and they kept getting accepted due to idiots like merkel being in charge . 
  this eventually led to the defunding of the refugee camps near the syrian border , forcing the people there too to move on into europe . 
  open-border policies and promises of taking in refugees caused the crisis . 
  the refugees should have been placed in well-funded refugee camps at or near the border with international protective forces . 
  from those camps , the refugees with actual immediate need of temporary asylum in a western nation should have been picked out and transferred in a controlled fashion . 
  in all honesty , she was also a great cause of the migrant crisis . 
  and she did n't solve it , the eastern countries and harsh winter did . 
  as a swede ; norway . 
  that may also be an anorexic bear by the looks of it . 
  sheesh , why are lions [ always so weird ] ( http://satwcomic.com/coat-of-arms ) in coat of arms . 
  in sweden , it 's all british english . 
  we 're also exposed to a lot of british television ( sherlock , midsomer murders , etc ) . 
  but surely that 's a non-spatial equivalent to newton-seconds to describe impulse ? 
  the truth is it varies depending on the size of the stone . 
  given that mali and france fought against islamists that wanted to topple the government and impose sharia on the country , it 's not that outlandish . 
   do n't decide for others what 's good for them . 
  exactly . 
  * do n't decide for others what 's good for them !, 
  * do n't decide for a child if he should be circumcised or not . 
  leave it to the person themselves to decide once they 're old enough to make that decision . 
  and yes , religious genital mutilation is a societal issue we should bring up and ban for children . 
   lots of males think circumsized penises look better and a lot of girls also agree with that . 
  ... in some parts of the world . 
  it 's a cultural thing , not a general thing . 
  the difference is that all the other religions are n't exactly prominent as far as terrorism is concerned . 
  islam * is * the problem , and we need to deal with it until it 's modernised and its followers secularised . 
  seems like luxembourgish is a language and luxembourgers is an ethnic group , while luxembourgian is a person from luxembourg . 
  the correct term is `` luxembourgian '' . 
  [ you need a passport or national id with you ] ( http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/entry-exit/eu-citizen/index_en.htm ) . 
  note that a national id is essentially a mini-passport , and not the same as a drivers license . 
  this is false . 
  [ you need a passport or * national id * when traveling within eu ] ( http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/entry-exit/eu-citizen/index_en.htm ) . 
  note that a national id is ** not ** the same as a drivers license . 
  he also said he hoped his music would change pop music forever , called his own music `` real music '' and called catchy tunes people usually enjoy `` fast food music '' . 
  he 's not the least bit humble . 
  he 's pretentious and considers himself a saver of pop . 
  honestly , the only 2 entries people remember are the first and the last . 
  and the first is often hated by many , so the last place is the best place !, 
   they can just , you know ... sing better songs or not sing boring , standard , mostly meaningless music they 're voted for by their countries to participate in eurovision . 
  perhaps other artists in the pre-selection had these `` better songs '' you speak of , but as it turns out people do n't like that shit and prefer these songs you find `` boring , standard , mostly meaningless '' . 
  you sound as much a pretentious prick as that fuck that won this year . 
  here 's to hoping !, 
  which is n't weird . 
  neighbouring countries tend to share culture and therefore have similar tastes . 
  that portuguese guy was such a pretentious prick . 
  the song was n't good either , but sheesh , at least be humble and thankful when you win a contest . 
  you can start by paying back that extra 'n' you used there . 
  mm , i agree . 
  shallow and pedantic . 
  let 's hope we can avoid that kafkaesque society . 
  after your propaganda video blatantly lying about the immigration crisis , i 've lost all respect for you kurzgesagt . 
  you really deserve a lot of flak for that shit .
