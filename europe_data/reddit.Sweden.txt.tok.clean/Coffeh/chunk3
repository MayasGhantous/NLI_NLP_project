  and thats to not encourage a mob-mentality of hunting the person . 
  which has happened a few times in reddits history . 
  but if a newspaper posts the name its absoutley ok . 
  hm , suppose . 
  i 'll edit it out to avoid confusion . 
  it 's not our rule . 
  its reddits rule . 
  reddit.com/rules they 're really adiment that it should be enforced hard . 
  in this case their names , adress , personnumbers , appartment numbers , zipcode ( postnummer ) , city of residence , and citizenship for those who werent swedish citizens , were posted . 
  haha so you caught that . 
  no it wasnt pointed out by the court .
