  * a gang-rape conviction was overturned in a higher court , as the court belived there was reasonable doubt that the boys involved didnt do it , the room was dark . 
  they were all bettween 15 and 16 , all 6 of them . 
  * russia might invade sweden soon !, 
  - at least thats the conclusion drawn in swedish media from a joint russian-belarussian troop exercise near the baltics . 
  * russia bans adoption of russian kids to swedish parents . 
  ( i belive this actually extends to all countries that recognizes homosexuall-marriages ), 
  ** sweden ** * a debate article arguing to outlaw infant male circumsision got a lot of traction . 
  and was signed by a lot of prominent healthcare professionals and the child-ombudsman .

  * the former state church ( protestant ) the church of sweden , are having elections today . 
  where people vote whos going to make the decissions in the church bodies .

  so they 've been allowed to set the debate in such a way that the election has more or less become a referendum on the swedendemocrats than anything really related to the church . 
  * the parties in government have suggested to half the population of the nations wild bears and lynxs .
