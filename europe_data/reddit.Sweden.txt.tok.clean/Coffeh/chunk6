  mexico is n't spain . 
  spain is n't mexico . 
  there 's one like this every week . 
  usually on sunday . 
  however , for the past 2 or 3 weeks someone has sniped me and posted one on a saturday , and even on a friday evening . 
  hm , yes you are quite right . 
  my personal opinion got in the way , i shall edit the post . 
  i hope you can accept my sincere apology . 
  i suppose in a way it highlights the left moving away from the old days of free love , and in to what i can only describe as moralism . 
  ** sweden ** * swedish left party politican accidentaly ( ? ), 
  tweeted a picture of his penis . 
  * swedish left party youth wing wants to ban porn . 
  * tv6 , swedens 6th largest tv channel , will start broadcasting e-sport in prime time . 
  * the youngest member of parliment in history has said he will resign , ~ ~ due to people not voting for his legislations . ~ ~ because politicians merely see fault in other politicians views instead of trying to think of new ideas and solutions . 
  * thanks to / u/svenne and / u/adamkex for correcting me . 
  why on earth would it be held in baku of all places ? 
  which account did you use for sweden ? 
  i support the idea , but i do think that under the current economic system it would be next to impossible to implement . 
   which european country has the most attractive citizens ? 
   sweden 27 % why , thank you europe . 
  you may touch me . 
  ( except you denmark ), 
  a glorious swede from / r/swarje probably wrote that . 
  i wasnt in favour of the death penelty before ... but now i 'm reconsidering . 
  no , you smell . 
  the idea is nice . 
  but it 's become a week of politicans blaming eachother for everything , but with the added feature of a sunny backdrop . 
  ** sweden ** * the almedal week . 
  a week when all the political parties in parliment meet in the almedal park in gotland and talk about politics . 
  each party gets one day each to focus on their issues . 
  and the entire national media is there . 
  a tradition started by olof palme * nothing . 
  ** sweden ** * it was revealed this week that the secret police has had infiltrators in the swedish ( former communist ) far left wing party . 
  * almedalsveckan starts today , a week where every party in the riksdag ( parliment ) has one day each to talk about their politics and entire nations newsmedia is gatherd there . 
  * the comission for lottery controll has decided that lan gaming constitutes gambling and thus you 'll need a license to organize one . 
  a license starts at 3000 sek ( 300eur ) * computers have to pay television license , as they can now watch state tv online . 
  * a prominent member of the swedendemocrats has secretly been funding a website called avpixlat ( depixilated ) . 
  the website is generaly considerd in line with the parties opinions , but with no offical connection . 
  * varan-tv season2 is out on svt 's open archive . 
  and there was much rejoicing, 
  & # 3232 ;\\ _ & # 3232 ; pizzasallad is mandatory . 
  ** sweden ** * it was midsummers - lots of drunks - lost of accidents . 
  * our military doesnt have any artillery . 
  * buss drivers union is on strike in a lot of cities , including the capital . 
  ** sweden ** : riots . 
  you 've probably heard about it allready . 
  when hell stops freezing over . 
  warmer ?!, 
  i 'm contemplating moving to svalbard , too warm in sweden . 
  the [ blue banana ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blue_banana ) is quite evident . 
  bavaria was the state where hitler was sent to jail in for the beer hall putsch . 
  so im guessing he 's somehow saying that bavaria will be leniant on the nazis 80 years later too . 
  if we 're gon na lose to one country with a redflag that has a white cross on it . 
  i 'd like it to be switzerland . 
  do n't forget the hockey world cup !, 
  its a stateowned lottery , so theres no tax . 
  if i was going to be attacked by anything , i 'd like it to be breasts . 
  just get some mittens and enjoy the snow like us nordics , 
  just to be clear , you 're refering to russia right ? 
  data obtained from http://www.reddit.com/r/muws/comments/19yoy8/request_reurope/, 
  never realized how many european flags were just stripes . 
  that 's not how percentages work :p, 
  i wonder how many longhaird gentlemen get accidentaly stopped . 
  reminds me of bubblewrap, 
  not ikea !, 
  wasnt the hamburger invented in the german city of hamburg ? 
  thats very cool actually , didnt know that  but barcelona is a symbol to all of catalonia . 
  and sweden ( 9,5 m ) doesnt have that many more inhabitants than catalonia ( 7,5 m ) . 
  so if we were to focus our entire nation on only one footballteam , i think we 'd be better than 28th . 
  we 're ranked 19th on the fifa world ranking afterall . 
  i 'd be downvoted so hard i 'd be kicked of reddit and in to orbit . 
  in sweden 51 % of the shares in a footballclub has to be owned by a sports-association in order to secure that they 're still routed in the local community etc etc. 
  which is allso why our top league ranks 28th in europe . 
   super bowl xlv , played in 2011 , became the most-watched american television program in history , drawing an average audience of ** 111 million viewers ** _____  the final of the 2011 tournament was the most-watched uefa champions league final to date , as well as the most watched annual sporting event worldwide that year , drawing ** 178.7 million television viewers **, 
  any suggestions as to where ? 
  every country is filled to the brink with stuff , except russia . 
  russia is so big it had to be coverd with a ladder . 
  kissinger won it back in 1973 . 
  oh balkans , how i love you . 
  but damn you 're hard for an old fart like me :(, 
  higher quality than me ? 
  pish posh, 
  are lizard-people a race ? 
  i ask for my friend david ^ ^ ^ ^ icke, 
  what happens if a deal isnt reached this week ? 
  what happend in the 90s that almost caused a war bettween greece and turkey ? 
  not bad . 
  but what do people have against the previewthumbnails that are standard on the rest of reddit ? 
  he did, 
  wow , strong move mate . 
  feel like sharing why ? 
  i get if you dont . 
  but i think we 're all intrested . 
  just noticed / u/bezbojnicul no longer mods the subreddit . 
  what 's happening here ? 
  another resignation ? 
  and yet , here you are & # 3232 ; _ & # 3232 ;, 
  giftwrappers ? 
  i quit a while back :( in fact , / u/obraka quit a few weeks before me . 
  / u/slyratchet is infact the only moderator left from both the last and the second to last round of moderator additions .
