  both me and obraka left for the same reason . 
  and i think you can guess why . 
  its unfortunate . 
  i thought for a while that after obraka left it would be a wake up call for the others , but it turned out that such wasnt the case . 
  so i wrote up a long goodbye post saying why i left , and demodded myself . 
  hopeing , in vain , that things would change . 
  hey , former europe mod ( featured in some of the leaks ) here . 
  it should be obvious by now that any action you guys take that does n't include the demodding of dr is n't going to be seen as credible by the community at large . 
  this post certinly isnt saying anything worthwhile . 
  basicly , you did bad . 
  now youre gon na do good . 
  but no actuall changes are to be made . 
  just my 2 cents . 
  ____ edit : 00:41:03 cest : dr is no longer a mod of / r/europe, 
  poor fella cant catch a break, 
  you have been banned from / r/swarje, 
  ah yes , the penis party . 
  they really stick it to the man , and woman . 
  he moderated by his own set of rules . 
  not listed in teh sidebar . 
  he removed entire threads/posts , because as he said `` they could lead to racist comments '' . 
  when pushed that was his usuall defence for pretty much any removal that he couldnt link to a specific rule . 
  from what i wittnes he tried to push a political narritive on the subreddit , removing threads that disagreed with him , approving threads he agreed with . 
  we used to have long debates on this , and he was very stubborn and would cry racism to pretty much anything when he ran out of arguments . 
  after a few months of this i had enough and left the moderator team . 
  2 out of the 3 moderators that joined the moderator team last year have left . 
  and i know more than just the two of us have heavy disagreement with the moderator in question . 
  but due to the hirarchy of the moderation team there was nothing we could do . 
  and so two of us left as we could no longer stand by and casually give our consent . 
  thanks for re-approving it . 
  that said , its a rather stupid rule only there to quiet any dissent against said moderator . 
  and it 's been fairly successfull . 
  otherwise / r/europe would have done what / r/canada did a long time ago , and [ publicly remove him ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditdrama/comments/wvq06/rcanada_to_hold_public_vote_on_the_removal_of/ ), 
  that was my comment . 
  to be fair it could be autommoderaror that removed it . 
  as at the time i left . 
  it had a rule that removed any comment mentioning that one mod . 
   by the way , / u/davidreiss666 does a lot of our heavy lifting , and is actually an exceptionally active moderator here . 
  from my time as a moderator on this subreddit i remember about 90-95 % of davids modactions being removing of comments and posts . 
  mainly ones he disagreed with . 
  at least that is the pattern i noticed . 
  remember i was the most active ( in terms of modactions ) for a while there . 
  is usa really called sad in serbian ? 
  got a clear majority of the ocean , sweet . 
  if the republicans are light blue , which colour does the rojalists have ? 
  well , you got the important one right !, 
  what are the shortlisted mod applicants opinions on such things as : * brexit * trump * the continued existance of the nation of denmark and the danish way of life . 
  * putin, 
  colonial legacy, 
  finland isnt scandinavian . 
  only germany . 
  what is this `` sun '' you 're talking about ? 
  congrats finland you 're an inspiration to us all !, 
  well not really , since we do n't adopt your policys . 
  but its nice to say . 
  isnt something like half their income allready coming from the cap ? 
  we work pretty fast up here . 
  i dont get how [ denmark can eat twice as much ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/datablog/2009/sep/02/meat-consumption-per-capita-climate-change ) meat as us swedes . 
  and more than any other country in the world . 
  learn dutch , it 's truly the universal language in yurop !, 
  thats 11/9 not 9/11 , 
  haha , oh wow , good catch !, 
  fair enough my transatlantic friend, 
  c'mon have a go if you think you 're hard enough !, 
  thats a law . 
  freedom of speech is more abstract , as everyone has their own idea of it . 
  for some it might include what others consider hate speech . 
  potato extermination . 
  is it ? 
  i remember qi saying it was 12 , something to do with the lateran treaty . 
  they adopted the laws of italy * at that time * . 
  which were 12 . 
  but i would be neat if they changed it to 14 . 
  hm now that i look at it again , you 're right . 
  i guess i included the neutral once in with the negative ones . 
  maybe i 'll look in to it . 
  i mean ; that would require me to have the results in . csv form . 
   which european country has the most attractive citizens  sweden 26 % http://i.imgur.com/spcpm.gif ^ ( ( suck it norway ) ), 
  looks like / r/europe would like a federal european state with a single currency and a well armed military force , with free internal migration , but almost no external imigration . 
  yet based on social-progressive-green ideals . 
   the age of consent in my country is . .  just right 67 % but it differs from 18 to 12 around europe . 
  ( 12 in the vatican btw ), 
  can national democrats be shortend to nadis ? 
  like national socialists were shorten to nazis . 
  nice find . 
  if anyone would know nations , you 'd think it 'd be the united nations . 
  i 'm calling it : the average / r/europe redditor is an hetrosexual male atheist , from western/northern european , studying at university and in their early 20s . 
  norway is in europe . 
  i contemplated calling it something along the lines * `` the shining beacon of civilzation - europe at night '' * but i figured that would be to bombastic and hyperbolic, 
  [ esa source article ] ( http://www.esa.int/esaeo/sem980p256e_index_0.html ) from 2005, 
  didnt know about it untill just now , but it sounds intresting , i 'll definitely give it a watch.thanks for the heads up , 
  finland , the new netherlands ? 
  the nordic model is crumbling with all the outsourcing and privatisations we 're doing tho , especially during the financial crises . 
   i hear that sex feels better uncut but it 's hard imagining it could feel any better than it does right now , and quite frankly i do n't want to know because you ca n't miss what you do n't have . 
  try removing the base from all the music you listen to . 
  after a while you get used to it . 
  after an even longer time youll have forgotten what the base sound is , and you cant fathom what people are talking about , more sound ? 
  do they want it louder ? 
  wouldnt that just hurt your ears ? 
  then you turn the base back on .
