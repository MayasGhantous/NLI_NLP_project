  best analogy i can give you , with out surgery or something . 
  it 's the original reasoning behind it , but it has indeed evolved . 
  for a while it was looked on as a anti-mastrubation device , wich kind of worked back in the day before lube . 
  now i belive they claim its hiv-protective and cleaner . 
  to remove a functioning body part of your children to appease your invisible skyfriend is rather odd when you think about it . 
  this got me curious about how large the other european subreddits are . 
  so i made a little list . 
  | country | subscribers | | : ----------- | ------------ :| | / r/armenian | 191 | | / r/austria | 1 123 | | / r/belarus | 235 | | / r/belgium | 2 029 | | / r/bosnia | 13 | | / r/bulgaria | 352 | | / r/croatia | 704 | | / r/cyprus | 114 | | / r/czech | 391 | | / r/denmark | 3 419 | | / r/eesti | 642 | | / r/finland | 1 883 | | / r/france | 5 954 | | / r/germany | 5 543 | | / r/greece | 718 | | / r/hungary | 430 | | / r/iceland | 1 792 | | / r/ireland | 10 681 | | / r/italy | 2 473 | | / r/latvia | 196 | | / r/lithuania | 380 | | / r/luxembourg | 126 | | / r/macedonia | 360 | | / r/malta | 146 | | / r/moldova | 76 | | / r/netherlands | 2 286 | | / r/norway | 3 063 | | / r/poland | 1 228 | | / r/portugal | 2 004 | | / r/romania | 1 823 | | / r/russia | 2 678 | | / r/serbia | 525 | | / r/slovakia | 218 | | / r/slovenia | 251 | | / r/spain | 1 242 | | / r/sweden | 7 421 | | / r/switzerland | 1 569 | | / r/turkey | 816 | | / r/ukraine | 287 | | / r/unitedkingdom | 29 022 |, 
  that my friends , that takes character . 
  in some languages * on * and * for * are very similiar . 
  so i understand the confusion . 
  yes it is !, 
  1905 never happened !, 
  return to your master !, 
  back when we had conscription ( 2010 ) ; if you were a pacifist , you still had to do your military service . 
  they just put you in a non-combat training , so you had to peal potatoes and stuff . 
  in the regards to sweden where just about every other party has gotten closer and closer to the middle ( maybe not so much v\u00e4nsterpartiet & kristdemokraterna ) . 
  id say that votes for the far right is more of a no vote on the current view of the system than a vote actually for the policies of the far right . 
  i felt that i needed to xpost it here . 
  because the title hit home , it 's true . 
  i had never heard about this . 
  in school or on tv . 
  [ wikipedia link ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flight_and_expulsion_of_germans_\\ ( 1944 % e2 % 80 % 931950 \\ ) ) about it for those who trust wikipedia more . 
  well they did succeed in poland . 
  iirc : she 's straight edge . 
  healthcare and meatballs for all !, 
  first time they 're counting votes in azerbaijan . 
  would love to see jedward when they 're in their 50s and all they have left to live for is the eurovision song the do once per year . 
  suprisingly so , good on you ireland . 
  the honorable shiny spandex knights of ireland !, 
  give it to switzerland , they 're neutral !, 
  afaik its not raised to 67 per say . 
  you can still retire at 65 , but you have the right to work to 67 if you so choose . 
  thats the american version of cnn . 
  not cnn international . 
  wich we get stuck with here in europe . 
  what also annoys me about cnn , is that they 're still broadcastin in 4:3 . 
  im gon na sell the eu financeministers some magic beans ... 
  congratulationswelldone, 
  i 'd like to add * views on greek bailout * views on future eu expansion * views on eu in general * views on imigration ( from other european countries , and non european countries ) * do you watch the eurovision song contest, 
  some of our fellow countrymen do tho . 
  [ relevant satw ] ( http://satwcomic.com/new-nordic ), 
  welcome to the club !, 
  and most importantly , what did you eat ? 
  there 's always been a strong nordic unity . 
  even before schengen we had pass-free inter-nordic travel . 
  there is a sort of trust among us . 
  so i can see why this would seem like a good idea . 
  sad day for the french . 
  swede here , 62 % if you make 53k euros / year . 
  last time i checked ( 2008 ) the top tax rate was about 85 % back in the late 70 's . 
  i was thinking more of eu-wide implementation of full body scanners . 
  fair point though . 
  this could have terrifying implications . 
  why would you standardize something if you dont intend on implementing it ? 
  in order for europe to be able to tackle this increasing rise in religon . 
  we need to be more aware that every religion is just an idea . 
  an idea a few people hold very dear to their heart , but its nothing more than an idea , and its absoutley essential that we , as an open society , are able to discuss the merits within these ideas . 
  wether its , islam , judaism , christianity , communism or capitalism . 
  i strive for as localy produced as possible ( for a reasonable price ) which usually have me buying swedish products . 
  i kind of stay away from anything out of european tho i have to admit that . 
  except the occasional sweet from foregin countries , just to try it . 
  actully thats not the free market . 
  during the nixon administration the us goverment realized that it would be cheeper to produce a lot of just one crop . 
  they settled on corn . 
  cause its versitile . 
  subsidesd it heavily . 
  america ended up overproducing corn , the us goverment buys any corn that doesnt get sold on the open market . 
  so now they feed their cattle with corn . 
  they allso invented a way to make a sweet liquid out of corn using acids . 
  this is what the sweetner in american coke . 
  americans are aware of this and some disaprove . 
  `` mexican coke '' is selling in certin places around the us . 
  as mexico still uses suger . 
  ( sorry i co-run a soda blogg so i know trivia like this ), 
  i 'm sure they 're aware that they suck already . 
  i have to admit that i 've got mixed emotions about this . 
  on the one side im glad , if not thrilled that europe finaly is getting its own , independant from the us , navigation system . 
  thats not made for the military and adopted for public use . 
  this is great . 
  on the other hand it essentialy not needed , as there 's allready gps . 
  it doesnt fill a new use and just servers to further clutter the near earth debris . 
  mixed emotions as you can tell , still , a great day for europe . 
  the question is , would the join ? 
  are n't they too neutral ? 
  laptop & latte generation . 
  gon na start using that term now . 
  hits suprisingly close to home . 
  thats a very nice flag you have there , i like how it compliments my flag . 
  subreddit improvements are always welcome . 
  well done . 
  [ a lot of things ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/november_9 ) happend on this day in history . 
  perhaps most notably : [ napoleons coup d'\u00e9tat ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/18_brumaire ) in 1799 [ night of broken glass ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kristallnacht ) / kristallnacht in 1938 and [ the fall of the berlin wall ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/berlin_wall#demolition ) in 1989 the 9th of november has truly been an eventfull day for europe through history .
