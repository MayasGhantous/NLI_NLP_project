i 'd quite like to see the study if you have it . 
  i do n't disbelieve knowledge could be better but ( assuming google translate is correct on that article ) many not knowing things like swedish being an official language or even in use and that finnish jokes would be perceived as truth in anyway ? 
  none of that is even close to true in my experience , and i 'm from the `` wrong '' part of the country . 
  i 'd really like to know what kind of sampling they had and how the questions were asked . 
  catalan is not top 10 in europe , far from it . 
  you could double the number speakers and still would n't make top 10 . 
  and that 's a awful infographic . 
  it seems to base data on different metrics for different countries , and it has sources that tell nothing so you ca n't check methodology . 
  that cia factbook page does n't rank most spoken languages for most countries , and the other source is literally * `` wikipedia.org '' * . 
  it does n't refer to a specific article on wikipedia , hell it does n't even say which language 's wikipedia it 's using . 
  but it does only have the ambiguous title `` second languages around the world '' , it does n't claim to be over the most spoken second languages or anything . 
  of course . 
  i was n't saying you were wrong , just wanted to point out the actual legality of things . 
  yes . 
  well ... technically it 's illegal to buy , not sell . 
  so you are free to prostitute yourself all you want , but doing so successfully will cause someone else to commit a crime . 
  brothels are explicitly illegal though iirc . 
  not that it 'd be easy to operate such business above board with exclusively criminal clientele . 
  only buying . 
  you 're free to prostitute yourself all you want . 
  not sure i 'd go that far , it 's a soft drink flavored by hop - and malt extracts and various spices . 
  it was created as a non-alcoholic alternative to the christmas beer , but i 'm not sure i 'd say that it 'd pretty much be a spiced stout or porter . 
  but in any case beer would n't have anything to do with actual must . 
  wort ( v\u00f6rt ) would probably be the analogous liquid there . 
  i know , just poor wording on my part . 
  that 's why i did put a ` generally ' in there . 
  ` p\u00e5sk ' means easter . 
  ` must ' originally meant [ must ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/must ) like in english , but now generally refers to the soft drink mentioned above . 
  must does n't mean drink . 
  it means the same as the english [ must ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/must ) ( i.e. , not yet fermented fruit juice ) . 
  but now just `` must '' does generally refer to the holiday soft drink . 
  jul - / p\u00e5skmust is n't really must in it 's original meaning . 
  iirc it was just called that as it was originally intended as a non-alcoholic alternative . 
   german is also one of the only germanic languages that does n't follow the obviously related where/waar/w \u00ear / hvor/var form so i got confused there . 
  tbf , ` hvor ' is pronounced closer to ` wo ' . 
  the h and r are pretty much only there to challenge the anglos in most random spelling . 
   and it 's funny how you scandi 's just completely stopped conjugating your verbs for different pronouns . 
  i mean , why would n't you ? 
  you 're required to name the subject here anyway , so conjugating verbs would n't tell us anything we did n't already know ... 
  it 's utterly pointless !, 
  in spanish it 's perfectly fine to say only ` soy sueco ' , but you ca n't just say ` am swedish ' in english even though it 's exactly the same . 
  you must specify ' * i * am swedish ' despite the fact no other person could possibly be something using ` am ' . 
  it 'd be much more logical to simply go ' i are ' , ` you are ' , ` he are ' , ` she are ' etc. 
   and yeah , i knew that it was n't exactly ein but rather something similar to definite die , but i wanted to emphasise the similarities . 
  ok , cool . 
  i 've just seen people who 've not realized we have definite suffixes so i wanted to point it out . 
  the definite suffix is n't a thing in many languages after all . 
   hvor = wer my german sucks , but should n't it be ` wo ' ? 
   er = like english are , possibly related to german art i 'd doubt that , ` art ' exists in danish too and stems from a different origin afaik . 
  but it is indeed related to the english ` are ' . 
  i can add the reason it 's unlike english also used for third person is because complicated conjugations are annoying . 
  you 're making it clear who the sentence subject is anyway , why bother complicating the verb unnecessarily ? 
    svensken = ein schwede to be pedantic , the - en suffix specifically denotes it 's definite . 
  iirc it 's a set expression referring to swedish people in general . 
  actual individuals would be ` svenskeren ' in definite singular afaik , but some danish fellow may correct that . 
  where 's the swede ? 
   danskj\u00e4vel literally : danish devil . 
  but it carries a connotation more like : danish bastard / danish fucker it is pretty similar . 
  dj\u00e4vel / duivel / teufel etc. 
  ` region sk\u00e5ne ' is the * county council * ( landsting ) ; the first level administrative unit with iso code is the * county * ( l\u00e4n ) itself ` sk\u00e5ne l\u00e4n ' . 
  the * county council * is the highest regional political body of the * county * , but it 's not the county itself . 
  the flag has not been adopted for the county to my knowledge , but it is as said used in official settings of the county . 
  but , yes , the county council did as you say accept use of the provincial flag officially in a newsletter 1999 , * while its primary official flag remained the armorial one of a griffin 's head * . 
  but by these subreddit rules that 's irrelevant as it 's organizationally not the subnational unit the iso code stands for . 
  and what the newsletter bulletin actually said was that the county council , * `` in addition to the own armorial flag that symbolizes the region '' * , intended to use the cross flag . 
  and how the county council government recommended its governed municipalities to utilize the cross flag at `` scanian '' flaggings . 
  if these rules are to be enforced the flag for scania would realistically be replaced with the griffin head as that is * the * official one . 
  the cross flag ca n't really be considered anything more than semi-official . 
  it 's not what i 'd want at all , but it is what i 'm interpreting the rules as saying . 
  but yes , it 'd certainly be riot worthy . 
  but i do n't think these rules were decided upon with sweden in mind . 
  which is pretty much what i tried saying in my post . 
  our counties are not our provinces , and are not something people would generally identify with . 
  and our provinces hold no official standing so neither can their flags , no matter the extent they 're used to . 
   during a trip to bohusl\u00e4n the other year i really enjoyed looking at all the good looking bohus flags . 
  huh , i completely missed that they also had . 
  i guess my original comment is n't entirely true then as there are more than the ones i knew of . 
  sorry about that . 
  greenland has an iso 3166 code , and it is part of the danish realm , and is arguably in europe . 
  you should really sit safe in my opinion , but that 's of course up to the mods . 
  if your municipalities had flags you could even make the case for them to get flairs as they have 3166 codes too . 
  if the mods count that greenland by itself `` is in europe '' that is . 
   as well as first level administrative regions ( regions ) of european countries , as defined by iso 3166 standard . 
  of course , for them to be represented , regions must actually have a flag . 
  i understand you need to draw the line somewhere , but which country subdivision to use should really be declared on a per country basis . 
  and you 've already in this thread said we 'll simply pretend france did n't change theirs to allow them to keep their flags , so you 're already making an exception there , it 's not like your really imposing these rules fully anyway . 
  in sweden the first level administrative regions with iso codes are our counties . 
  those counties are purely administrative ( duh ) , not the cultural , historical , or geographical units people really talk about . 
  for that you want our [ * landskap * \\ ( `` provinces '' \\ ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/provinces_of_sweden ) . 
  several provinces match their respective counties , but they 're not the same . 
  those provinces used to be the administrative regions , but they were later redrawn into what we know call counties . 
  you know , * in the same manner france redrew theirs * , just 382 years earlier . 
  i mean , either you should declare the subdivision on a per country basis ( which i 'd personally prefer ) , or france should also say bye bye to their regional flairs . 
  if you really cared about being fair that is . 
  btw the only subdivision flair we have at the moment is the flag for scania which is only semi-official and i assume you 'll unfortunately remove if you impose these rules . 
  why ? 
  well , it 's the provincial flag , but since the provinces do n't have any legal standing in sweden it 's only used by custom , not law . 
  the official flag for the * county * of scania is the same as for any country , their banner of arms , which absolutely no one cares for . 
  the provincial flag is used in official settings , but it 's not the official flag -- hence * semi-official * . 
  removing scania 's flag would be utter bullshit though , unless you decide to remove all countries ' regional flags .
