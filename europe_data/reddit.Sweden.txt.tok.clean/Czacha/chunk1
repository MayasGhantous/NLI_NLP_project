looks like a good place to record a new set of vessel signature tracks . 
  i assume it 's a lot quieter in the waters outside stockholm than let say rotterdam . 
  putin : how do you know it 's a russian sub and not some people who happen to speak russian that bought it in a survival shop ? 
  as long as it 's not a ground invasion , i 'm good . 
  ow yes the ice porridge , my brain had supressed that . 
  walk throught that and your shoes gets those damn salt stains . 
   but : icy winters with snow , during winter i wish it would snow and stay frosty . 
  but no , winter in malm\u00f6 is often 0.5 + c , damp as fuck , and vertical rain due to winds resulting in such a cold feeling in your body that even your bones starts to ache after more than one hour outside . 
  once spring arrives and you feel that first heat from the sun rays , you just forget you just survived some of the most horrific shit of the year . 
  then it 's all about maximizing the sun before hell returns back . 
  us has a huge stockpile of tanks and armored vehicles in norway in case of a conflict . 
  and i bet they 've started switching it to more modern vehicles as the russian threat was increasing during the last couple of years . 
  they would not need to ship the first wave from america , only soldiers , but that would take days and not weeks . 
  are we seeing history repeat itself . 
  germany and russia once decided the fate of poland . 
  today it 's seems merkel and putin already decided the way for ukraine . 
  they will and most likely already have , with the arctic ice shrinking smaller , the uncovered area will give rise to many new geopolitical disputes . 
  did n't stop a lost brit from dropping a couple of bombs in malm\u00f6 though :p, 
  it was a gift from soviet , if i recall correctly . 
  so while the fade of building in style with art deco pretty much ended after wwii , it was quite the hit in soviet . 
  i remember seeing similar buildings in moscow . 
  yeah it really stands out , when it 's the only big structure in the area . 
  we joke that it was built as a big middle-finger towards denmark . 
  i feel like stockholm 's picture was a bit unflattering , so to contribute to this awesome post . 
  here comes more : ** stockholm : ** http://blog.radissonblu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/stozs-stockholm-skyline.jpg http://img0.mxstatic.com/wallpapers/309148e2f355fad1a99d20ebfdfd435c_large.jpeg ** malm\u00f6 ** http://www.skane.com/sites/all/files/styles/slideshow-big/public/media/images/urning_torso.jpg?itok=rjxkrue5 http://31.media.tumblr.com/04aefc1f20980b79de507df7c04c9e97/tumblr_mvpu0twrrz1qao0cco1_1280.jpg bonus pic of malm\u00f6 's ufo : http://willyoinger.homeip.net/city/080116_hyllie.jpg, 
  from when i was there , the only `` rebuilt '' part of town is the old town . 
  however the city center is a mis-mash of new buildings and those grey ugly concrete-block soviet flats . 
  i do not have anything against poles getting rid of that soviet crap . 
  looks like a well fed bull . 
  even got those bumpers while head-butting stray pedestrians on the road . 
  do they sell life-insurance together with the bus tickets ? 
  wo n't work as there is still a too nationalistic pride in the member states . 
  well not everyone has to use the other hand to shift the lard covering the dick . 
  i 'd fucking make the fatty run if i ever saw them using the handicap space . 
  fatty parks the closest to the store , fuck that . 
  make fatty-parkings at the far end of the lot , make them walk a mile to the store , they need it . 
  some were maybe waiting for the free ride to the polling station like in the olden days . 
  then update it !, 
  either the lakes would be filled up by glaciers melting in surrounding mountains . 
  or if they 're connected to the sea somehow maybe the new height would be pushing seawater back up the rivers ? 
  god has an old map dating back to the habsburg empire !, 
  has n't he been in power for a decade ? 
  i have a feeling i 've seen his face when it comes to turkey for a very long time now , might be wrong though . 
  but what is the maximum number of years a president is allowed to be in power in turkey ? 
  so in order to bitch , i am forced to vote even if the options are all shit ? 
  does n't sound too democratic . 
  i blame shit socio-planning for this . 
  the state has allowed only some municipalities to accept the bulk of immigration , what did they think would happen ? 
  it 's only right for the state to pay up after causing such a mess . 
  but malm\u00f6 is n't that bad , at least you feel safer today than you did in the early 90 's motorcycle gang war , or end of 90s early 00 's balkan gang wars . 
  same shit basically , the calm some people refer to was most of the times due to truces between big criminal orgs/gangs . 
  between the stability we have murders , bombings and shootings . 
  what is new , is the use of grenades , it seems a lot of people got hold of them in recent years . 
  and let me guess , each year they make changes and the school accepts them rendering the previous years ' books obsolete . 
  thus people ca n't buy the books from the students that had them a year ago ? . 
  that must be how the majority of the middle-aged and older viewers of most eastern-european feel when watching eurovision . 
  i 've always wondered what they go by in those cases , is it the melody itself ? 
  how about soviet ? 
  we do n't consider a walker a vehicle , and using it , driving . 
  but first they need to take a nap . 
  that 's why i learnt french at one point , to be able to talk with people when traveling in europe . 
  after arriving in spain i learnt that i should have added that language as well . 
  also germany outside bigger cities is a nightmare too ( or at least was , this was 8 years ago ) . 
  it is recognised highly within the medicine research world . 
  so depending on how you rank , it may show up or wo n't . 
  i 've read about a study not long ago , where it was based on how recognised the uni was within the world 's research community , thus unis with extensive international ties ranked higher ( given they did a good job of course , it was n't based solely on reputation ) . 
  when i studied we had quite a few students from finland , they said it was easier to study here when it came to some particular disciplines . 
  why ? 
  the schools in the top are very good universities , some of which have a long history of higher education , educated some of the world 's greatest minds . 
  be proud and do n't give a shit about haters , they will always be around even while enjoying the effects of the research conducted in those unis or any other top rated school . 
  ** edit ** i was supposed to answer the guy above you , but well you see my friday celebration started a little early this friday . 
  although the nuance of the word might be different from the swedish `` skadeglad '' , i 've always translated that to the english words epicaricacy , maybe a hard word to use in every day conversation however it means taking pleasure in other 's misfortune . 
  and i 'm pretty sure i 've heard the word schadenfreude used in english conversation as well by persons who were not german . 
  what it all comes down to in the end and this might only be my own notions . 
  is that people who reminisce of the old days when the country had a bigger impact in the world and immense power in the immediate surrounding geographical area can not accept that states they used to control slink out of any future potential grip . 
  it 's like a badly written romance with a jealous partner , that comes to the conclusion ; if not i then no one else . 
  words might have been uttered and most likely have behind closed doors however putting such a statement into a treaty would be foolish for any nation of any considerable power . 
  so putin wants to do a reverse majdan , get russians shot so he can send in `` peacekeeping '' troops . 
  while the west will be quite canned in their critique as after all civilians were killed . 
  i remember the good old days in early and mid 90s when the sek stood strong and we took the ferry to copenhagen and drag\u00f6r to buy a shitload of beer . 
  good times . 
  one norwegian told me the word for ambulance is klantetaxi and toilet paper is rumpekrafs . 
  i 'm still quite unsure if i was n't trolled . 
  both are used pretty frequently especially out in various work sectors . 
  the more swedish the business the higher the frequency of snabel-a , at least in my experience . 
  i would n't know , i 'm just a dane that was forcefully transformed swedish during a war some hundred years ago . 
  how are the armenians doing ? 
  well you do n't use a military intervention and expect no one to die . 
  whoever made the call to bomb those locations deemed the predicted civilian casualty number to be acceptable compared to whatever they were comparing it against . 
  and that 's why war should always be the last possible alternative . 
  i 'm not disputing the fact that civilian serbs also died . 
  i clearly remember the cluster bomb that hit a local plaza where people were buying vegetables due to neglecting the winds on that particular day . 
  the number is insignificant , what is significant is that civilian were being targeted and that can not be tolerated . 
  but whatever makes you sleep at night . 
  you might have missed the groups who missed the bulletin , and started an ethnic murder rampage . 
  unfortunately it 's a good way to prohibit an ease of moving equipment , people and resources . 
  so it 's understandable it was done , however it 's unfortunate for the civilians after the conflict is resolved .

  pilot error and poor safety measures taken by the organizer . 
  not since they took the cctvs down .
