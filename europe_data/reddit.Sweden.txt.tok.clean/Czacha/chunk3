  sign at the border : enemies are advised to attack between office hours 08-17 . 
  protect the vatican ? 
  polish news outlets report at least 6 confirmed dead . 
  pretty much every cake bakery do these if you get in early or if you order them . 
  this is the best shit ever , love it !, 
  looks a lot like polish christmas day dinner table . 
  well the ones living in mansions did n't go to begg themselves they exploited kids and women in their villages . 
  i will try to find the documentary , i saw it on svt play some time ago . 
  remember that documentary about gipsy bosses sending out the young to begg on the streets of london ? 
  while they lived in big mansions with golden mercedes signs on the towers on their houses . 
  i wonder if this begg operation in sweden is part of something similar . 
  no big gipsy populations ? 
  are you kidding me , sure we had only they did n't live in makeshift tents . 
  only hobos had made makeshift tent cities up until now , at least here in malm\u00f6 . 
  some of them are living in tents outside the city http://gfx.svd-cdn.se/multimedia/dynamic/01118/kakstad_lp_59r-bsp_1118050c.jpg http://gfx.svd-cdn.se/multimedia/dynamic/01118/kakstad_lp_18r-bsp_1118048c.jpg, 
  true . 
  but it 's basically the same problem pretty much everywhere , maybe not as extreme however i remember the speech we got when i started my uni studies . 
  which basically can be summarized into : a degree does not necessarily translate into a job , while the politicians increase the number of new student spots each year due to a clear shortage of qualified workers out in the market , the market still has graduates not finding a job they are qualified for . 
  but one thing this increase will result in , is more of you per empty job place resulting in industries being able to lower your starting salaries . 
  congratulations on choosing this school and good luck in life . 
  since then , i 've come to understand how much truth he spoke that day . 
  only regret i have is that i was too inexperienced to grasp how important that speech was . 
  it was long , however i did enjoy the effects and composition and the artistic representation of russia 's history . 
  but i wondered if the trololo song when the modern women were doing their thing had a deeper meaning ? 
  the russian tv sent an altered version where the fifth ring opened . 
  so what you are saying never happened , it 's all your imagination !, 
   the rich are too highly taxed . 
  it 's quite ambiguous . 
   look up they us policy on that issue and use that as the specific . 
  this solves it , i should have read the guidelines before taking the test . 
  and some of those views would be affected of the situation in said country . 
  if i answer that i strongly agree that rich are taxed too heavily in a country where they evidently are n't . 
  or i answer the same but the rich are being taxed much heavier . 
  would they reflect the same political view ? 
  but some of these question depends on where in the world you live . 
  for example if you live in a country who truly does tax rich ( people who earn more ) a lot more than the average or if you live in a country where they do not or even tax less . 
  then the answer to that particular question means different things . 
  but was it really pasta ? 
  it was mostly these tasteless farts if i recall correctly : http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/macaroni_closeup.jpg, 
  indeed , inside it 's bloody summer . 
  i had to go out on the balcony today ... holy shit did i regret that in t-shirt and shorts . 
  the first image has a different graph with gdp ( ppp ) per capita . 
  ukraine has a decline culminating in late/early 00s which is interesting as is n't that around the time russia had their ruble crisis ? 
  the second image , frankly i 'm not sure as they do n't specify it , however the third link mentions only gdp per capita and use the same image . 
  the continent europe has , if i recall correctly , 47 independent countries . 
  and i think it depends also on the source as some argue a few of those countries belongs to another continent ( all from cultural to which tectonic plates are involved etc etc ) . 
  now that i checked wikipedia they state 50 countries among which 6 are disputed . 
  i have forgotten that some countries have gained independence since my geography lessons in the 90s . 
  these are images tweeted and retweeted by sikorski https://pbs.twimg.com/media/bfo6fdscmaagius.jpg:large http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/e2/c2/e9/z15319778p,pkb-polski-i-ukrainy.jpg http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/alex-massie/2014/01/what-is-europe-good-for-rather-a-lot-actually/, 
  my attempt : it 's not that you can predict it , however you can have a lot of preconceived notions on how certain specific groups of people will behave due to past experiences with groups . 
  which is unfortunate , however it seems a lot of people do this . 
  i too must admit i 've had preconceived notions about people . 
  some of those turned out to be valid other did n't . 
  in recent years i 've tried to suppress my brain 's tendencies to do this , to look at a persons actions and judge by these . 
  the problem here becomes when you wrongly label a person you are about to meet as one of the groups you already have opinions about . 
  as this can lead to really shitty treatment . 
   which european country has the silliest accent ? 
   denmark 96 ( 5 % )   country of residence   sweden 93 ( 5 % ) i wonder where ~ ~ who ~ ~ the other 3 choosing this are from ? 
  you ca n't complain about east european women ... well at least not when it comes to looks . 
  this wait is nothing , in / r/sweden we have now soon waited 6 months for part two of the results .

  so where in america did you study ? 
  i think poland would disagree . 
  this is our long time strategy to reclaim some of our long lost land in america !, 
   one of those is compulsory breath alcohol measuring device in every car , following some dramatic alcohol related accidents on new years . 
  in what way ? 
  will it be hooked up to the ignition loop or will it only require you to have a breathalyzer in the car ? 
  as the latter is completely useless for preventing anything and the first will not be cheap to implement . 
  with east europeans coming to uk taking jobs you guys long ago did n't want ? 
  or is it the non europeans coming to uk not getting a job but hogging the system . 
  the perspective of this issue is idiotic to begin with , if poles net contribution is greater than what they take out of the system , one must lack brain matter where it costs . 
  poland will then get intelligent and motivated workers from countries who view poland as poland views england . 
   this is how europeans discuss foreign policy ? 
  looked more like a stand up show to me , not a discussion of foreign policy . 
  as these will be biannual surveys , i think your answers should reflect your current view . 
  in the future when time is right you will be able to instead put yes as the answer for that particular question , given that it 's still around . 
  you got the age groups . 
  i bet a lot of the older generations absolutely do n't like germany whereas the younger more distanced from what happened , are more positive . 
  the type of immigration have changed over the years . 
  70-early 90s it was mostly educated immigrants or immigrants with an occupational trade .
