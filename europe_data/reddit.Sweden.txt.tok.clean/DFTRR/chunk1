[ garmarna - herr mannelig ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kc570kwus ) an old swedish medieval ballad . 
  [ lykke li - du \u00e4r den ende ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htndet0fbmw ) [ ulla billquist - min soldat ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfay2loaiak ) the `` anthem '' of the swedish army during wwii . 
  [ vargs\u00e5ngen from ronja r\u00f6vardotter ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl1ta9np7f8 ) from one of the most loved swedish children 's movies . 
  created from a story by astrid lindgren off course . 
  well , where i 'm from we usually use just `` blyerts '' . 
  asking for a `` penna '' usually gets me the question `` kulspets ( ballpoint ) eller ( or ) blyerts ? 
  well i do really like norwegian , it sounds so happy !, 
  outside of scandinavia i think the languages i like the best is french for the melody , english for the simplicity and greek for the history and for it 's dignity . 
  the only thing i 've ever heard about bulgaria is that it 's very poor and that many truck drivers are from there and and from macedonia but when it comes to reputation , i 've heard nothing bad or rather nothing at all . 
  romanians are the new poles since the poles are starting to get a better reputation . 
  i would say that many probably use the snabel-a word when trying to be clear about what they 're saying when talking on the phone or in an interview . 
  that 's from the jellinge stone right ? 
  i found out last thursday that i 'm one of those 1 % and am allergic to the vespula ( earth-wasps ) family of wasps by getting my first allergic reaction with swelling , urtikaria , itching and all that jazz . 
  it 's not pleasant . 
  apparently you usually are n't allergic the first time you get stung , i 've been stung before a lot of times by common wasps , bees and bumblebees but only one time by the vespula . 
  i have n't yet seen the movie but it 's true that the book is really entertaining/good . 
  one of my all time favorite movies is `` blinkande lyktor '' from denmark . 
  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0236027/?ref_=nv_sr_2 after france and maybe uk , denmark is probably the best european country at making movies . 
  oh my , you did n't even need that flair for me to know you were turkish . 
  we all get it , you hate the kurds and the kurds hate you . 
  you killed the kurds and the kurds killed you . 
  but the ypg , although connected to pkk , was not those kurds and i think it 's unreasonable for you to hate kurds just because they are kurds . 
  could you give me a date so i 'll know when to expect the imminent collapse ? 
  i did say `` every budget that did n't adjust to their view on the immigration '' . 
  there 's no lies in my answers . 
  also , how could they possibly promise that there would be no increase in immigration ? 
  by limiting the right to search asylum or refusing to test the asylum seekers applications fairly ? 
  the ultimatum was impossible and sd knows it . 
  i 'm saying that it 's not undemocratic to let the largest minority govern . 
  do n't you think it 's undemocraftic for a party to vote for a budget that is n't their own , that is n't what their voters voted for ? 
  because you know , sd did that . 
  it 's probably not but in any case , i think it 's distasteful . 
   that there is no difference between sds stance on their budget and any other party all parties has the stance that if it 's possible to vote for you own budget you do and if it 's not you do n't vote at all . 
  all parties except for sd that voted the alliances budget . 
  * cooperating with sd . 
  nope * cooperating with the green-reds . 
  nope , that would ruin the alliance and possibly the right bloc for a long time . 
  * not voting . 
  that was what eventually happened . 
  * waiting for the reelection . 
  that costs money and that likely only would lead to another re-election . 
  also kd might lose their seats . 
  they democratically let the coalition with the largest support form a government since there were no real alternatives . 
  edit :  agreeing to absolutely everything your opposition says , surrendering your ability to influence the government . 
  that has not happened and it will not because this whole thing is based on a mutual non-legal agreement and if the the budget is too absurd they will break the agreement and so the reds + greens would not do that . 
   not true . 
  the 2014 election was the most dramatic yet and anything could have happened . 
  besides , if you at first do not succeed , try again . 
  see atomicgardens post . 
  and you 'll realize there were no chance for a majority coalition . 
  the only thing that might have happened was that kd ( christian democrats ) would have been voted off the riksdag . 
  and the alliance would never have risked that at that point , they had nothing to win on an re-election . 
   exactly , and that 's what makes the morons . 
  they had the option to be in the government , and they simply declined . 
  no sane person would do that . 
  i do not agree . 
  if they would have done that they would have split up the alliance and with that making it weak and then they might not have had the possibility to govern with parties that they are closer to again . 
  yes and legally sd did nothing wrong , however the praxis was there to avoid situations like this and to make it possible for the relative majority to govern . 
   a ) a reelection can yield varying results indeed but both coalitions would need about 10 % more votes , that was n't gon na happen . 
   b ) every coalition or party can adjust their budgets in a way as to encourage their counterparts to vote for it . 
  well , sd had their ultimatum and that would never have happended . 
  and the alliance wouldnt put down their votes unless an agreement was made which was what happened . 
   if the social-democrats can accept the green part as part of their government , why can they not accept any other party ? 
  they did say multiple times that they wanted to have the peoples party and the center party in the coalition but they refused . 
  the only party they could n't accept in a coalition was sd . 
   all this mess not because the alternative is civil war or mass demonstrations , but to fail to form a government this one time . 
  no , all this mess because sd wanted to force their politics on any possible goverment and did n't follow the long standing praxis . 
  that 's not what they did . 
  sds budget got voted down and left was the red + greens and the alliance . 
  since red and geens was the largest minority they would have won the vote but sd did n't follow the praxis and instead of not voting for any budget they voted for the alliance budget making it impossible to create a functioning goverment . 
  and it would n't have mattered if there would have been a re-election because even if the alliance would 've won and becoming the largest minority sd would have voted for the red and greens budget as promised . 
  and around it goes . 
  december agreement was the option left . 
  this would never have happened if sd had followed the praxis . 
  that is true , but i think their possible voteshare is at it 's max at something like 20-25 . 
  which is huge but not enough to form a goverment and since no other party is willing to cooperate with them they 'll have very little real influence . 
  i think that when the syrian civil war has ended , and god knows when that might be , the amount of refugees will decline and their voteshare with it . 
  also , the goverment that `` solves '' the beggar problem ( aka get them out of our sight ) will steal a huge share of sds vote . 
  the reason for the agreement is that sd promised to vote down every budget that did n't adjust to their view on the immigration . 
  leaving the country without govermernt since neither the leftbloc or the rightbloc was unable to pass their budget and form a goverment since there were no majority . 
  in other words , a minority ( sd ) made it impossible for the relative majority to pass a budget because of a single issue , the immigration . 
  thus the december agreement . 
  that 's not really how i define human value . 
  also , just because they do n't know all those things now does n't mean they never will . 
  it 's not , but extremists have on several occasions expressed that will , although it 's often about the whole world and not only europe . 
  btw , you should know that r/europe is pretty right wing with voting brigades and whatnot . 
  is it wrong for him to want his sons to hava a better future than egypt can offer ? 
  he seem to have the will to do whatever it takes for it to happen , and that includes learning the language and getting a job . 
  if not for himself , for his sons . 
  those sons will get an education and in the long term they will contribute greatly to sweden . 
  yup , that 's balkan .

  awesome work man !, 
  i love it . 
  that is not true , here is the poll on how sweddit would vote from before the election [ yellow is anti-immigration party ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gpxrsom.png ) . 
  there has been a large influx of anti-immigration people on sweddit , partly from far right forums but they 're not a majority yet . 
  they are the ones that are the loudest though and because of massdownvoting other opinions is often hidden , much like in r/europe . 
  to be honest , i think , sweden will profit greatly with large immigration in the long term with an otherwise aging population and what not . 
  the truth is that most of us knows immigrants , both christian and muslims , they are our neighbours and friends and we like them .
