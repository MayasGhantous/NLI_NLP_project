you know what 's worse than the dark winters ? 
  the bright summers . 
  it 's unbearable . 
  i hate it . 
  the darkness might get you down , but the constant sunlight really messes with your head . 
   yooo , -20 here , just chilling , fun fact we only have 6 hours of sunlight !, 
  in my part of the country it 's warmer . 
  has n't gone below -16 in the past 12 months ( and that was a pretty big outlier ) . 
  up north , of course , they have a couple of weeks without sunlight at all . 
  reminds me of a `` report '' on the `` most equal '' swedish businesses , with the winner having 63 % women on the board . 
  because more women = more equality . 
  [ story in swedish . 
  the first two parts of that really looks like a terrible speller trying to write half-english , half-swedish . 
  `` blast the bryggor upp , break alla diken '', 
  at least it was n't in one of the cities that make pizzas 5 cm thick .

  hence the popularity of the video . 
  ( `` who threw it ? 
  the one who threw it is gonne get beat ! '' ), 
  is said whenever anyone throws anything . 
  they 're of the opinion that increasing defence spending or cooperating with nato will just antagonize putin and that it would be much better if we just spoke to him . 
  they also think the stockholm archipelago , 40km from the city centre , is the border . 
  absolut is swedish however ( well , french now ) . 
  isds made vattenfall willing to build and operate nuclear power plants in germany at the lowest cost to the german tax payer . 
  had germany not changed the law , germany would have saved money . 
  somewhat related to the skogsr\u00e5 is the bergsr\u00e5 , who made people forget where they found ore . 
  in * very * local mythology , there 's a tunnel in my home town where you have to knock before entering , else the bergsr\u00e5 will take you and you will never be seen again . 
  [ nonsense !,

  well , it 's the middle in an east-west sense .

  almost as much as nuclear . 
  61 twh hydro , 64 twh nuclear ( out of 140 twh used ) . 
  that statistic is based on a survey where the surveytakers decided if the woman was raped based on her answers to 3 questions , not the woman herself . 
  `` steam from your hot spring is blowing in over my yard ! '', 
  [ looks like they 're winning at that as well .

  you do n't just vote for a party here , but ( optionally ) also a person . 
  [ this ] ( http://oi45.tinypic.com/2hpu8ih.jpg ) is what a ballot for one party might look like . 
  for the riksdag you have 8 parties with 30 names each - it makes for quite a large ballot . 
  and that 's not counting the smaller parties who have proper ballots ( at least 2 more ) . 
  quite a few of these are real parties . 
  junilistan , piratpartiet , klassiskt liberala partiet ... small , but they do exist . 
  friet speciaal is better anyway . 
  in the last election ( yesterday ) , the social democrats were the biggest party in all but 4 regions : stockholm city , stockholm county , gothenburg and scania ( southern ) . 
  so the entire country is socialist i suppose , but in general the top 2/3rds lean to the left and the bottom 1/3rd ( and stockholm ) to the right . 
  g\u00f6ran persson , the former swedish prime minister , has called her immature , ignorant , unpredictable , and impossible to work with . 
  at a meeting between the leaders of the ( then ) 7 parties in the riksdag , she burst out `` you men ca n't think you 're allowed to fuck anything in a skirt from different social environments '' . 
  they were discussing the presidency of the eu and laws regarding prostitution . 
  the parties of the former coalition have publicly said they want to keep alliansen ( the name they 've taken ) together more than they want political power today , and that it 's more important that they keep working together than it is for sweden to have a majority government . 
  alliansen is the only way they have of challenging the social democrats long term , so it 's not entirely stupid . 
  all of alliansen ( c , m , fp , kd ) have publicly said they will not form a government with the social democrats or without all of alliansen . 
  historically the social democrats have worked with whoever had enough seats for them to reach a majority : part of the reason they 've held power for so long is that they 've been willing to work with pretty much everyone and done so fairly , so you 've always been safe knowing that voting for ( s ) you will get a functioning government . 
  with alliansen the right-wing parties presents themselves as a pre-defined coalition government and people ready for cabinet posts , which ( s ) does not . 
  with alliansen up and running , yes . 
  the leaders said earlier tonight that they consider keeping alliansen together is more important than sweden having a majority government . 
  `` hen '' makes sense though , it 's easier than going `` him or her '' or referring only to one gender . 
  the real madness is wanting to replace the armed forces with hbtq-groups in dealing with foreign conflicts . 
  because , you know , isis would probably stop if a couple of swedish lesbians gave them a stern talking to . 
  they 're socialists , not communists though they were founded as a communist party . 
  they want to re-educate ( yes , that 's the word they use ) men to make their habits more similar to womens ( which are , apparently , ideal ) . 
  they want a special tax to fund a `` womens salary '' . 
  they estimate it to be about $ 60/month for every woman in sweden . 
  they also want tax incentives to raise womens pay . 
  one of their highest-ranking members took her daughter out of school at 11 , and later entered her into an ( arranged ? 
  not sure ) marriage at 16 . 
  another congratulated afa on their `` birthday '' . 
  the leader tweeted positively about an article talking about how it 's natural , harmless and actually positive to hate men . 
  at a conference a few years ago three members sang a song about how awful men are and how they should be killed . 
  they were , of course , cheered . 
  on a more hypocritical note , they want to use affirmative action in all public and large private organizations ( sometimes defined as ** at least ** 50 % women ) . 
  meanwhile , their top leadership are 3 women , and their board/council/don ` t-know-the-right-term is composed of 93 % women ( 14/15 ) . 
  as a bonus , [ this is the face of a reporter working for public service tv ( svt ) when interviewing the leader about their success at the eu elections .

  there are more people in kiruna than there are sami in sweden , so it 's probably too large still . 
  sure it does , everyone makes fun of stockholm ( or `` fjolltr\u00e4sk '' ) . 
  they 're probably all r8s . 
  the ebu is limited by latitude and longitude , not european borders . 
  thus morocco has competed and tunisia ( ? ), 
  was planning to but withdrew . 
  and [ morocco ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/morocco_in_the_eurovision_song_contest ) . 
  but is , on the other hand , dickless . 
  australia tends to do well too . 
  they did n't just `` search his home '' of course , they had a search warrant . 
  it sure is unusual , but not * that * strange . 
  someone being `` extremely buff '' is basically the `` stash of needles '' of steroids . 
  ca n't have people walking around looking like evidence of a crime more like . 
  se also built a nuclear power plant close to them . 
  they get all of the risks with none of the rewards !, 
  largest in `` modern times '' , so yeah pretty big .

  the day before yesterday the fire was level with virsbo . 
  the entire area north of virsbo was burned after 03.00 yesterday and before 16.40 today - and that 's with very little wind today . 
  according to the authorities they 've held and even started to push the fire back slightly today .
