  this led to the december agreement , made to avoid endless re-elections or breaking the alliance in attempts to get a majority coalition , which has made a lot of people angry . 
  $ 13 for 3 litres is n't too bad , but the wine probably is . 
  back in the old days with [ the bratt system ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bratt_system ) there were limits on how much alcohol you could buy per month - except wine . 
  hey , we 're not all \u00d6rebroare !, 
  i 'll have you know my hometown of 6000 people has an elvis store ( and funeral services ) and a yearly celebration of him with impersonators singing in one of the parks . 
  as an outsider i 'd say . 
  i do n't think we covered anything sweden did during the war in school . 
  just saying we were neutral , and mentioning the grand coalition in the government and the volunteers going to finland in passing . 
  focus was very heavily on europe and the holocaust , so i suspect that 's how most people look at it . 
  [ is expressen alright ? 
  ] ( http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/expressen-avslojar/jimmie-akessons-angrepp-pa-gardell/ ) the article claims jimmie \u00c5kesson , leader of sd , called the participants of pride `` tasteless '' and that he `` will never understand homosexual love '' . 
  otherwise , [ here ] ( http://www.svt.se/nyheter/val2014/vi-ar-oppna-att-samarbeta-med-alla-partier ) bj\u00f6rn s\u00f6der makes it clear they oppose same-sex adoption on the basis that straight couples make for a better environment for children . 
  they 've called themselves pro-hbt simply because they oppose `` the increased islamisation '' of sweden ( according to the expressen article ) . 
  `` dalm\u00e5l '' only covers a small part of dalarna . 
  i 'd take it with a truckload of salt . 
  i have a very hard time sympathising with people who deliberately antagonise people into wanting to kill them . 
  yes , it 's a ridiculous overreaction . 
  yes , you have the right to say/draw that . 
  but i wo n't be surprised or pay attention to you when you get the reaction you want . 
  english media and entertainment , at least compared to swedish , is pretty hostile towards other countries . 
  jokes at other countries expense and about how much better england is pop up pretty frequently , which just gives of an arrogant vibe . 
  then there are your politicians : ukip meps are the worst but less known , but britain threatening to leave the eu/veto unless it gets special dispensation from treaties and rules is pretty irritating . 
  within your right of course , but it still sounds pretty bad . 
  not `` we believe this legislation is bad and should not pass '' but `` we do n't give a shit what you do , just leave us out of it '' . 
  the americans will probably grab all the offices with good views though . 
  it was different , it should have gotten more points . 
  worked for lordi . 
  knowing bj\u00f6rkman they probably save more than a little . 
  very advanced coatbuttons in macedonia it seems . 
  well , it is an avicii song . 
  more countries now though . 
  we 'll get the kommunalr\u00e5d from stockholm , malm\u00f6 , g\u00f6teborg and ( surprisingly ) uddevalla to fight over it . 
  he threw around glowing stuff . 
  that way , they 'll have 0 points !, 
  phew . 
  they kept us low as long as they could , so it 's done now . 
  bit surprising that . 
  only a 5-point difference now , and they get at least as many political votes as sweden does . 
  just keep at it . 
  it 's worked quite well for turkey with germany . 
  we 're really bad at this political voting thing . 
  we should give our top points to you , finland and denmark since you 're no threat . 
  part of 60-year celebration . 
  it 's really big in australia with like 3 million viewers every year . 
  at least it is n't a pensioner this time . 
  it 's actually ordered to keep it as close as possible for as long as possible . 
  just goes to show how popular some entries were . 
  damn this political voting , another point for the uk . 
  shocking turn of events there . 
  you 're beating france and germany though . 
  `` two world wars , one world cup and one point in eurovision '' is pretty catchy . 
  blue and yellow are beautiful colours . 
  sweden as well . 
  we do n't , and i do n't think the other nordic countries , translate city names . 
  really malta ? 
  1 point for the uk ? 
  typical political voting . 
  wow , and i thought rapping in swedish sounded silly . 
  this is how the world ends . 
  not with a bang , but a burp . 
  hey , that girl has been a contestant on several talent shows . 
  clearly she 's never won one , but ... 
  swedish broadcasting will probably pay you if we can host it in your stead . 
  it sure is n't about tight songs . 
  any day now . 
  well , hopefully . 
  [ you 're missing out !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-rrxhg00gy ), 
  sorry , our 8-12s are reserved for other nordics ( and estonia for finland ) . 
  last time they won they did it with a male figure skater on scene and t.a.t.u. 
  performed when they hosted . 
  i 'm loving the [ guardians live updates . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/live/2015/may/23/eurovision-song-contest-2015-live-blog ) `` this is a true story : a couple of years ago i went to vienna with my wife . 
  we were walking back to our hotel and , because hardly anyone lives in vienna , the streets were deserted . 
  but , on the breeze , we heard music that sounded a lot like this from an open-air performance a few hundred yards away . 
  right then it felt truly magical , like the sort of thing that only happens once or twice in your life . 
  right now , though , i 'm sitting on my own in the dark , covered in bits of haribo writing this for money and it 's rubbish . 
  shut up you big drum idiots . 
  shut up . '', 
  it 's also the name of a pastry . 
  we do n't just call him yummy yummy all willy nilly . 
  though now that i think about it , since [ this is a mumsmums ] ( http://i.imgur.com/s4jim3k.jpg ) you could argue we 're saying looks like a piece of shit . 
  the guy with the teeth probably has a drum-mounted fleshlight at home . 
  so what 's our excuse ? 
  `` i 'd call this a peebreak , but i do n't know anyone who pees for 9 minutes . 
  it 's like a parody of a eurovision segment . '', 
  it 's been an on-and-off rule so yeah waterloo was in english . 
  it won the swedish selection in swedish though ( lots of abbas songs have two versions ) . 
  appropriate username i suppose . 
  how dare you . 
  he 's a beautiful , beautiful human being . 
  i 'd pay good money to see eurovision hosted in cockney . 
  nobody would understand a damn thing . 
  yup . 
  he broke a glass box and was just generally a workplace hazard . 
  austria reminding the hungarians who was before the hyphen . 
  so , the spanish entry is partially written be swedes . 
  the swedish empire lives on in eurovision !, 
  hey , avicii is swedish . 
  finland gives them a lot of points .
