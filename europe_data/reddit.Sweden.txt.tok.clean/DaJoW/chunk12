  nobody would dream of having kids read breiviks manifesto . 
  putting rhubarb on something . 
  ( this is supposedly due to poor translation at some point though ) . 
  say neither `` boo '' [ like a ghost ) ] or `` baah '' [ like a sheep ] . 
  they 'll need to keep an eye on the tau east of china as well . 
  the 6 % for english is probably due to immigrants speaking it as a second language . 
  went on an exchange to germany , every family i visited had special indoor shoes . 
  not slippers , just a pair of shoes each that they changed to when they came home . 
  two reasons : first , it happened quite a long time ago . 
  israel is n't even 70 years old . 
  second , those countries defeated/displaced the people who were there first and have come to a more-or-less peaceful cohabitation of the area . 
  israel and palestine have not . 
  get rid of danish influence . 
  `` ethnic registration '' refers to several cases where law enforcement would keep registries of non-swedes . 
  most notably the scanian police had a registry of romani that started out as a registry of romani criminals , but also included everyone related to them . 
  when the news broke the registry contained some 4000 names with over 1000 of them children . 
  it has n't been like that in systembolaget for a long time . 
  i only know of one store which still does it ( and only for spirits ) but in that shop you could not fit those bottles in the rest of the store without removing something else . 
  i 've heard people say `` they did n't discover it , people already lived there ! '', 
  many times and i really do n't agree with that line of thought . 
  there were people who knew about it yes , but not the person who discovered it and not the people they revealed that information to later . 
  is it wrong to say you `` discovered '' a band because the band members already knew about it ? 
  germans have a reputation of stealing moose-crossing roadsigns . 
  really ? 
  when i think `` arrogant '' i do n't think german at all . 
  guess that 's just the difference between scandinavia and `` usa usa usa '' . 
  we even let former inmates vote regardless of what crimes they committed . 
  except for , you know , being free to do what you want and meet whoever you want . 
  in general you need to commit pretty serious crimes to go to jail in norway , nevermind whatever class of facility holds breivik . 
  murders are relatively rare , but that just means all of them will be in one place . 
  sounds more like revenge to me . 
  norway and sweden at least also have a lot of hydro which adds a lot to transport costs . 
  not a lot of people living around the dams exactly . 
  do n't you have a lot of wind power though ? 
  not the ~ 90 % hydro/nuclear we have but still a lot . 
  sweden - silent . 
  it even says so in the national anthem : `` you old , you free , you mountainous north ; you silent , you joyfully fair '', 
  [ v\u00e4stmanland-dalas nationshus ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4q0lrvd.jpg ) in uppsala is damned ugly . 
  not alvar aalots finest work . 
  swedish law is n't common law . 
  in the swedish system being charged means that you 're going to court , it 's the last part of an investigation . 
  if he 's extradited to sweden , * both * sweden and the uk need to agree to an extradition to the us for the duration of his court case . 
  in the context of the un at least , the us will just veto it . 
  sweden has 3 . 
  no , the `` racism = power + prejudice '' crap applies globally . 
  a white guy in zimbabwe is still privileged and you ca n't be racist towards him . 
  a white guy in north korea is n't oppressed , because he is white and thus part of the system . 
  a white homeless man in the us has more power than hillary clinton or the women on the supreme court , because he is a man . 
  sd leaders oppose same-sex marriage and same-sex adoption . 
  their `` gay pride parade '' was organized by a guy who has spoken highly of antisemites , white power-advocates , recommended a movie about how muslims are pedophiles and should all be deported etc. 
  it was planned to go through a muslim neighbourhood , and he has been accused of trying to provoke both sides . 
  well , the swedish citizens . 
  not people with swedish citizenship but the proper swedes , the ones who are part of the `` swedish nation '' as defined by their party program . 
  the ones with the right taste in music , clothing etc , who celebrate the right holidays , and have the right religious beliefs . 
  more than that , nothing would change . 
  yeah sd would grow a bit , but as long as the alliance wo n't form a government with anyone else we 'll end up in the same position : two large groups without a majority who wo n't work together and sd . 
  the agreement was made because sd broke parliamentary practice . 
  budget resolutions in the swedish parliament are passed by each party or group presenting one proposal , everybody voting , the one with the lowest support is defeated , repeat . 
  parliamentary practice has been that you vote for your own proposal then abstain from voting on any other . 
  sd voted for their own proposal , then the alliances . 
  due to current politics this means that we can not have a functioning government unless a party with 13 % support dictate policy . 
   if the un is going to state that merely being opposed to immigration is inherently intolerant well , sd was founded by a group of white supremacists from the `` bevara sverige svenskt '' ( `` keep sweden swedish '' ) movement and most ( all ? ), 
  of the current leadership joined and rose to prominence while sd still used that slogan . 
  this year they used practically the same logo as bss did for a campaign . 
  bss is famous for a poster telling swedish women not to `` defile their race '' by sleeping with `` aids-carrying niggers '' . 
  a couple of years ago one of the party leaders was filmed telling a swedish-born kurd to leave `` his '' country , and calling a woman `` whore '' and `` niggerlover '' when she tried to intervene . 
  so there 's more to sd being xenophobic and intolerant than just wanting to reduce immigration . 
  your examples are fine . 
  \u00c5ke green stood in a pulpit and said that gays are a cancer on society , and that was ruled to be fine . 
  the only times someone has been found guilty of breaking that law is by inciting violence . 
  saying `` i hate russians '' is fine . 
  shouting `` kill all russians '' in a public space is not . 
  rough translation : `` inciting threats or hatred/insult must be done in a public space and to more than a few people . '', 
  it then refers to a case where 13 people were found to me enough . 
  the pm said that if leave won he would trigger article 50 the next morning . 
  ca n't get much harder than that . 
  the uk system really is something . 
  lib dems get 8 seats with 8 % of votes , snp get 56 with 5.7 % , and the tories get a majority with 36 % . 
  i would n't be surprised if russophiles get stronger in eastern europe simply because putin will look calm and rational compared to trumps volatility and immaturity . 
  it means they 're not calling him gay , he 's actually a homosexual . 
  my worst memory from several trips to the netherlands is buying some popcorn at a zoo and getting cold ones covered in sugar . 
  swedish law is n't common law . 
  suspects are n't charged mid-investigation but at the very end , along with arrest and trial scheduling . 
  it 's close . 
  hitler has 30.578 points , mozart 30.515 . 
  official statistics put the swedish coast line at 11,500 km , with another 31,700 km of coastline for islands in the sea , so i really wonder where they got their figures . 
  according to the swedish bureau of statistics we have ~ 220,000 islands . 
  edit : though only ~ 98,000 islands in the sea . 
  he just has n't been in the spotlight much lately . 
  he 's quite well liked for his sense of humour and for being a man of the people . 
  his birthday celebrations often include stand up and he always seems to enjoy it immensely for example . 
  reminds me of a scene from [ yes , minister ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ww7mhtp5a5e ) . 
  seems it was a fear that the current system would be a disaster as well . 
  and then the mongols put a stop to that . 
  i like it . 
  fines are supposed to hurt and be a deterrent , $ 100 does n't deter millionaires . 
  because it 's cheap and a very effective way of using otherwise lost heat from power plants . 
  and it 's only for heating homes ( by pumping warm water into radiators ) , not tap water . 
  not sure about this incident , but there 's been organized crime by serbs in sweden for [ over 30 years .
