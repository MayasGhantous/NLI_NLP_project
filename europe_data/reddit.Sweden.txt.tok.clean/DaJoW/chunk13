  yes , minister had an episode on the evils of the eu when thatcher was pm . 
  and us violent crime statistics only include events where someone is at risk of dying . 
  rape statistics exploded well before immigration did . 
  the kings grandfather chose not to be crowned and it has not been worn since . 
   they have equal rights in israel . 
  i 'm guessing being a non-jew in a state defined as jewish probably does n't feel like it . 
  they are . 
  a few years ago one of their leaders spoke of wanting a law saying that at least 50 % of board members of all companies must be women . 
  not 50/50 , a minimum of 50 % women . 
  on the other hand , in student housing you can leave the building whenever you want . 
  we had that . 
  unemployed people were doing things of no economic benefit and the company was paid to have them . 
  so you had dozens of people given a stool and paint and told to repaint the stool over and over or they 'd lose their benefits . 
  another was `` employed '' as a foot massager . 
  oh absolutely . 
  a friend of mine bought a 1 bedroom apartment overlooking the town square for $ 2600 . 
  but nobody wants to live in a town of 5500 without jobs or even a train station for commuting . 
  his flair is `` brits in , slavs out '' so i think his general position on immigration is pretty clear . 
   cold and lonley . 
  the swedish experience . 
  we already make heavy use of [ district heating ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/district_heating ) . 
  surprisingly , there were fairly few 300 year olds killed in the bombings . 
  we use bourgeoisie for most of the `` right '' parties , how 's that ? 
  the country in eurovision with the annoyingly long name . 
  how would someone be banned from playing concerts due to saying stupid shit ? 
  i really do feel like most of our media is completely separated from the rest of society . 
  big newspapers keep saying shit like that but i 've never heard anyone agree with them and my circle of friends consists to a large part of f !, 
  voters , s voters , communists , and a couple of former afa members . 
  come on now . 
  fifa regularly makes countries change their laws to get the privilege of hosting . 
  actually lower than our last general election , where we had 85.81 % . 
  the iberian lynx is a separate subspecies though . 
  or a street , was his point . 
  `` public space '' is pretty much everywhere except peoples homes and businesses . 
  the `` s '' in `` islandpony '' is pronounced though . 
  he is/was quite liked by sweden democrat voters . 
  nor in the swedish ( `` swede '' or `` sweden '' that is ) . 
  we sing about `` the north '' instead . 
  no harder than ripping off masks , but if the ultras do stuff in the stands - cause damage , throw stuff etc - guards wo n't always get to them in the act . 
  in swedish : `` what are you doing ? '', 
  when it should be `` vad g\u00f6r du ? '', 
  we have 4 % and still 8 parties in parliament . 
  the [ ebu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_broadcasting_union ) is defined by latitude and longitude . 
  it includes north africa as well , they just choose not to compete . 
  the uk has fairly [ poor social mobility ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_mobility#/media/file:intergenerational_mobility_graph-1.jpg ) ( lower is better ) . 
  the richest may not have a huge share of wealth but it 's pretty hard for a poor person to get rich . 
  that 's because sweden is the land of the jenn aiel . 
   shrove tuesday is also called pancake day , because traditionally you eat pancakes . 
  that 's traditionally thursday in sweden . 
  * every * thursday . 
  a few years back one of them burned down the [ yule goat ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/g%c3%a4vle_goat ) thinking it was legal . 
  iirc he left the country before he could stand trial . 
  according to the site : * adventure * citizenship * cultural influence * entrepeneurship * heritage * movers * open for business * power * quality of life looks like it 's just a survey where people were asked to associate countries with terms . 
  `` adventure '' , for instance , was ranked based on people calling the country friendly , fun , having a pleasant climate , scenic , and sexy ( brazil won , sweden 18th , us 26th ) . 
  ( `` molestation [ ... ] applies to one who [ ... ] through words of actions interferes with a person in a way dedicated to violating the persons sexual integrity . '' ), 
  wolves , bears , reindeer , and wolverines too !, 
  easier to see the moose admittedly . 
  i remember my mother telling me , horrified , that people living near refugee housing felt they had to start locking their cars at night . 
  there had n't been any thefts or anything , they just did n't like that people walked past their house several times a day . 
  if we managed to cram another 300 million into the netherlands they 'd be quite a lot more influential . 
  step 9 use swedes to do the jobs norwegians do n't want to . 
  us purchasing power is really strong . 
  pretty much the only thing you might find cheaper in sweden is , amusingly , really high-end alcohol - big bulk import prices ( as one company supplies the entire country ) and no profit offsets the tax . 
  hey now , we were just protecting protestant rights that last time . 
  those cities on the baltic wanted to be swedish , i swear . 
  that 's a `` viking kebab '' , available at any pizzeria . 
  not sure why vikings loved iceberg lettuce so much ( tomato is standard ) . 
  yeah , `` fj\u00e4rrv\u00e4rme '' ( `` long-distance heat '' ) is quite popular . 
  even stockholms main train station collects heat for a nearby office building . 
  no , he 's saying in the us if a man rapes a woman 100 times , the statistics count it once . 
  the statistics do `` favour '' the us because the us counts differently . 
  it makes any comparison pointless . 
  statistics `` favour '' ireland over both , as rape is defined by their law as something a man does . 
   julian assagne would not be be charged for rape according to swedish law , for example . 
  yes he would . 
  he had sex with a sleeping woman . 
  [ 23 % of women at us universities are raped . 
  ] ( http://europe.newsweek.com/1-4-women-sexual-assault-college-333396?rm=eu ) there , vastly higher than sweden and both are stats so it 's a fair comparison right ? 
  neither . 
  of swedish gdp , 46 % is paid taxes . 
  highest possible is far higher , lowest possible far lower . 
  in the 90 's we took in a lot of yugoslavians . 
  the `` yugo mafia '' is still around . 
  social mobility is [ better in the nordics , including sweden . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:intergenerational_mobility_graph-1.jpg ) and concerning universities , sweden has [ karolinska institutet ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/karolinska_institutet ) - ranked 11th in medicine , 3rd in pharmacy , 1st in dental ... 
  it 's a decent school . 
  and it does n't have a tuition . 
  and sweden actually has higher social mobility than the us . 
  the odds of someone born to a poor family getting rich are almost twice as good in sweden . 
  i do n't know how denmark does it , but sweden typically does n't seize the property of people on welfare . 
  or how about irish law defining rape as something a man does ? 
  the rape accusation is assange having sex with a sleeping woman . 
  i 'm pretty sure that 's rape in every country , or it should be . 
  comparing incarceration rates with the us is pretty pointless . 
  they 're about on par with estimates for north korea . 
  sweden democrats . 
  i think they and ukip have some common ground , does ukip also say it 's difficult to maintain `` government by the people '' if there are several different peoples in one country ? 
  they 're only 3k subs ahead of sweddit , which is itself ludicrously over represented in r/all . 
  [ justified at times of course .
