  and snorway, 
  same in sweden , though i think most moved back . 
  there are stories of big companies hiring entire villages . 
  one of the most successful strongmen in history , as well as a world-class armwrestler . 
  he once broke [ this guys ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/nathanjones.jpg ) arm in armwrestling . 
  [ it was insane . 
  ] ( http://www.historyhome.co.uk/peel/economic/currency.htm ), 
  nsfw . 
  great northern war probably . 
  sweden vs denmark-norway , saxony-poland-lithuania , and russia . 
  clearly we 'll be a fundamentalist islamic state in 6 months . 
  `` sverige '' ( sweden ) is a bit more complicated . 
  it comes from `` svea rike '' - `` realm of the swedes '' - which originally referred to the people living in [ svealand ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/svealand ) - `` land of the swedes '' - as opposed to [ g\u00f6taland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/g%c3%b6taland ) - `` land of the geats '' . 
  any data that suggests finland is pro-russia should be scrutinised i 'd say . 
  it is n't pronounced `` mal-m\u00f6 '' though . 
  it 's pronounced `` malm-\u00f6 '' though , not `` mal-m\u00f6 '' . 
  he 's appeared on the comedy panel show have i got news for you several times . 
  good panel shows though . 
  i hear they have bunga-bunga parties . 
  as a kicker eu regulations are functionally identical to pre-existing uk legislation . 
  i know this is a joke , but i 'm pretty tired of it . 
  [ eu regulations ] ( http://www.europarl.org.uk/en/media/euromyths/bendybananas.html ) just say that class 1 bananas must be `` free from malformation or abnormal curvature . '', 
  it 's functionally identical to british law . 
  what a nice change from being told we 'll be a caliphate in 6 months . 
  most stouts sold in sweden are from the uk , but there are quite a few small swedish breweries making good ones : electric nurse for instance . 
  there are 127 swedish-brewed porters and stouts according to systembolaget . 
   it was hoped that allied intervention would eventually bring the neutral nordic countries , norway and sweden , to the allied side by strengthening their positions against germany -- although hitler had by december declared to the swedish government that franco-british troops on swedish soil would immediately provoke a german invasion . 
  and twice a day during the summer , stockholm city hall rings bells in his honour . 
  how about `` lady mary 's chambermaid '' ? . 
  nothing . 
  you just spin it . 
  i do n't really get why people are so mad about them , it 's not like they make a noise or anything . 
  sure , but most also add stuff the voters want but do n't affect themselves . 
  `` lower taxes for me and cheaper preschools '' sounds a lot more palatable than `` lower taxes for me , fewer human rights for you '' . 
  according to the article he has a degree from uppsala and another from stockholm . 
  especially drunk people . 
  people go fucking mental over it every time . 
  geothermal , burning wood pellets , and district heating ( [ 60 % of houses ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/district_heating#sweden ) ) are the most common ones . 
  the song was n't good , but the performance was awful . 
  can only hope portugal crashes hard in the popular vote . 
  sweden can compete in two major sports : hockey and eurovision . 
  best get used to it because the media will be * full * of it for the next week regardless of what happens . 
  not our fault nobody else takes eurovision seriously :p, 
  and it 's expensive . 
  i 'm guessing for the same reason we do n't have it in sweden : there 's no need for it . 
  the unions keep everyones pay reasonable ( or higher , admittedly ) . 
  please do n't link to friatider , it 's worse than the mail . 
   `` i allowed myself to be provoked and was provocative myself '' he was `` provoked '' by there being an immigrant , zoran ismail ( a comedian as it happens ) , in his general vicinity . 
  the video shows almqvist ( the politician ) saying : `` in my opinion you 're acting like a [ racist slur , do n't know a good translation ] ... you 've got no business being here ... this is my country , you hear me ? '', 
  zoran replied `` it 's my country too '' `` ahh , my country ... not , it 's not your country , it 's my country . '', 
  almqvist then hissed in zorans ear . 
  soran : `` take it easy , it 's like ... 
  i 'm just making a point . '', 
  almqvist : `` yeah , but you 're making it like a cunt . '', 
  a drunk man wanders up and tries to snatch the camera out of the sd-politicians hand . 
  the three politicians then shove the man and say `` learn swedish !, 
  speak swedish for fucks sake ! '', 
  as the three are leaving a short while later , they again walk up to the man , shove him and say : `` hey !, 
  act like a swede ! '', 
  the man replies `` what did i do ? 
  what does it mean that i 'm just standing here ? '', 
  `` it means you 're being aggressive . '', 
  almqvist leans in and says something to the man , who then says the racist slur from earlier twice . 
  almqvist turns to his friends , laughing , and says `` i love doing that just to fuck with them . '', 
  they all laugh . 
  amqvist : `` do n't you just love doing that just to fuck with them ? 
  it 's not like i care anyway . '', 
  a woman confronts them about the second incident , and asks them why they were `` hitting '' the man . 
  almqvist tells the other two `` fuck this little whore !, 
  [ as in , `` ignore '' , not literally ] . 
  this all happened at a mcdonalds in central stockholm early on a wednesday morning . 
  it 's worth pointing out that sd actually used footage from this video , heavily edited , a few years ago to make it appear as though they were being attacked by immigrants . 
  just yesterday one of the men who were there that night twittered about this all being lies . 
  note that this is all based on reports in the media today , i have n't seen the video myself . 
  well , there are no numbers for norwegians trusting swedes , so we ca n't know for sure . 
  greece probably got a lower rating than it deserves due to tourist traps where there 's plenty of ripping off going on . 
  i 've read articles about how china is headed for a crash , as their demographics are getting more and more top-heavy due to the low birthrate . 
  [ this article ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-18091107 ) , for instance , says 1/3rd of chinas population will be  60 by 2050 . 
  this list is like saying the us gave the world lady gaga , matt damon and walmart . 
  factually correct , but pretty pointless things to thank the us for ( and very much not awesome ) . 
  bah , we also went to russia and all the way to turkey . 
  mostly for trade though . 
  really ? 
  my hometown of 6,000 has two ( i.e. 
  all ) grocery stores that close at 10pm , clothing stores in the area are open until ~ 8 , hairdressers are usually open until 6 or 7 on weekdays . 
  but * which * germany ? 
  agreed . 
  every knows saarl\u00e4nders give the rest of germans a bad name !, 
  vilks was already in some trouble due to other stuff he 'd said , and had received death threats . 
  they were most likely going to see if he would dare say what he wanted to in front of them , knowing the threats he had received . 
  the uk got a special opt-out clause . 
  i think they threatened to veto the whole thing if they did n't . 
  not ( necessarily ) in a legal document . 
  when we got pizza in school in sweden it was [ these ] ( http://fastfoodexpress.eu/afbeeldingen/food/panpizza.jpg ) bastards , also very greasy . 
  then again , they had lunch ladies standing guard to make sure you did n't take more than 2 at a time and it was a once-a-semester thing . 
  well , yeah . 
  afa explicitly fights `` fascism '' ( whatever that happens to be that day ) on the streets . 
  they describe themselves as `` militant '' , and supposedly believe the only way to stop `` fascism '' is to intimidate and/or kill their political opponents . 
  seems contradictory to me . 
  well , one of the investigative svt shows ( uppdrag granskning perhaps ) had native swedes call various companies and present themselves as a ) a swedish-sounding name or b ) an arab/african sounding name and ask if they had any job openings .
