  the area basically grew by 50 % yesterday . 
  smoke ( lightly ) covered lule\u00e5 , close to the finnish border , earlier today . 
  [ this ] ( http://toolbox.aftonbladet.se/aftonbladet-tools/helpers/file.php?file=549/2014-08-05_18.21.34-f0e94ebc73231fcc0e16f451f9be0ed7bf7675f0_610.jpg ) was taken almost 500 km away from the fire . 
  living < 10km from the fire , visibility is down to about 200 meters . 
  the planes coming in have to get water from m\u00e4laren because they simply ca n't see the lakes here . 
  banter is too social an activity . 
  we just curse eachother . 
  it 's worth pointing out that race has far more connotations than just skin colour in sweden , which is what they want to get away from . 
  laws ( such as anti-discrimination laws ) will still mention ethnicity/ethnic background . 
  nobody is saying there 's no such thing as skin colour . 
  not sure why we made ourselves the idiots either . 
  we just joke about finnish names . 
  what 's the name of finlands second-best skiier ? 
  what 's the name of the tallest finn ? 
  what 's the name of finlands worst gardener ? 
  maski halonen ( wormsin raspberries ) . 
  i take full responsibility for those translations . 
  the point is that they sound vaguely finnish . 
  there are a few about the chinese as well : what do you call the poorest man in china ? 
  tom peng pung ( empty money purse ) . 
  do you know what they call a hallway in china ? 
  how do you keep a norwegian entertained ? 
  give him a piece of paper with `` turn over '' on both sides . 
  have n't you heard ? 
  sweden is literally a middle eastern country now . 
  except for when it 's a radical feminist utopia that is . 
  i can never take \u00f6stg\u00f6tar seriously . 
  every sentence sounds like several questions strung together . 
  they should have realized something was up when the name ( presumably ) was rejected when the girl was an infant . 
  looks to me like she has no official name at all , because none was ever approved - the same as if the parents had n't sent in the papers specifying her name in the first place . 
  they could n't give her a passport with `` st\u00falka '' on it because that is n't a name in accordance to their naming laws either ( no surname ) . 
  kingdom of sweden has a nice ring to it . 
  it 's the same in summer . 
  it messes with your head in very strange ways . 
  i miss when the end said `` finland wins eurovision '' . 
  wrong ronaldo . 
  cristiano has very few wc goals ( australias tim cahill has more than cr7 and messi combined for instance ) . 
  water i think . 
  an archbishop executing 80 people for opposing him , regardless of class , would probably not be too popular . 
  especially as this particular archbishop was removed from his position by the swedish riksdag , and then reinstated by christian ii . 
  the castration program mainly targeted women . 
  iirc , of the 5 criteria you could be `` asked '' to `` voluntarily '' be castrated for , 3 were exclusive to women . 
  the fervor to improve * folkh\u00e4lsan * was insane in the early 20th century . 
  made for a very good lucky luke comic . 
   what are you talking about ? 
  he 's talking about the `` free flow of information '' . 
  wales founded wikipedia , torvalds created linux . 
  meanwhile , the us has a far more diverse history and culture than europe , and people from different states are as different from eachother as people from different european countries . 
  0.5 % of the population , 0.2 % of the seats . 
  not too bad . 
  their leader is a former left party leader , she left because her political views were too extreme for the party . 
  she has compared sweden to taliban afghanistan in terms of equality and has spoken of a `` man tax '' to pay for mens violence towards women . 
  it 's a problem because many of their ideas give feminism a bad name , or at least makes the movement seem out of touch with reality . 
  completely free immigration into the eu is untenable , and arguing for the eu to mandate prostitution - and marriage laws wo n't be very popular . 
  probably not mandating abortionlaws either . 
   it opens up the debate except that it does n't . 
  no other party can say one word about reducing immigration or they 'll be torn apart as allies of sd . 
  but they will be giving lots of ammo to people who do n't like/understand feminism as it is . 
  open borders between the eu and the rest of the world ? 
  the eu stopping `` tax havens '' through regulations ( mandating tax rates ? ) ? 
  `` equality analysis '' of eu budgets ? 
  they wo n't be taken seriously at all , but will no doubt be used as examples of what pro-eu parties and feminists want . 
  swedish sd will likely join them as well . 
  at least the party paid for a leaders membership fees . 
  now now , only 92 seats in the house of lords are hereditary . 
  the problem is that other languages ca n't compete with english and french . 
  up until 1998 ( when the rule changed last time ) , there were 14 winners in english , 14 in french and 16 in all other languages combined - and it had already been 10 years since a song won in french . 
  the largest non-english , non-french languages were dutch and hebrew with 3 wins each . 
  but to people who do n't speak french , it 's just `` bla bla bla moustache moustache '', 
  they were robbed . 
  much better than 2nd . 
  with the squad they have it 's no less than expected . 
  they 're due a win ( and it 's about time spain lost something ) . 
  [ looks like france is your best friend historically . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/netherlands_in_the_eurovision_song_contest#voting_history ), 
  you were 5th in 2009 , since then you 've sent engelbert humperdinck , bonnie tyler and blue - not exactly the kind of acts who tend to do well . 
  blue did n't do too badly though . 
  only english and french , really . 
  there have been more winners in hebrew than in german . 
  one word : fairytale . 
  the uk thing is to not care , send a bad song , and complain about doing badly . 
  the years they do decently , their media is strangely quiet about it . 
  like the us beat hitler in wwii ? 
  yeah , you have a higher rate of non-eu immigrants than we do of immigrants . 
  i think our problems basically boil down to 1 . 
  we accept a lot of middle-eastern/african refugees . 
  we basically do n't do anything to integrate immigrants , pretty much just provide them with a free swedish course . 
  our problems are exaggerated . 
  far from non-existent , but also not as bad as many people seem to think . 
  they do , but it 's kind of disturbing that people can say `` we ca n't have socialized medicine because we have so many black people and mexicans '' with a straight face . 
  nah , he 's celebrating [ st. lucy 's day . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saint_lucy's_day ), 
  only about 3 % of our electricity comes from burning fossil fuels . 
  hydro and nuclear makes up 90 % and burning waste another 6 % . 
  [ this is the extent of our gas line network . 
  ] ( http://www.energimarknadsinspektionen.se/documents/bilder/illustrationer/naturgasnatet_sverige.jpg ) we just do n't use gas in sweden . 
  then there are pellets burners and [ downhole heat exchangers ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/downhole_heat_exchanger ) ( bergv\u00e4rme ) for smaller homes . 
  except for us . 
  we even try to take credit when other countries win because a backup singer , choreographer or dressmaker was swedish . 
  the costumes were somehow too over-the-top for eurovision .
