  few can make that claim . 
   the first university ever founded on german soil was in ... wait for it ... prague . 
  our second oldest is in estonia . 
  funny things , empires . 
  a couple of old winners that are pretty damn good : [ luxembourg 1965 . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buhvurgp8yu ) [ uk 1967 . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfeicarjgmy ) [ ireland 1980 . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vccwzuttiqy ) [ and , of course , the only song about shoes to ever win it - sweden , 1984 . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-rrxhg00gy ), 
  the brilliance of it is how it clashes with everything around it , making it stand out . 
  remember , it followed [ this . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsueqn1qvv4 ) not at all surprised verka serduchka finished second ( after molitva ) . 
  finland have had a couple of great entries recently . 
  [ 2012 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43gwovxrk2y ) is very beautiful , but i guess you need to understand the lyrics for it to be good ( did n't make it to the final ) . 
  [ 2011 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fj9of4izfu ) was pretty damn good as well . 
  [ greece ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3k2mojokkg ) was pretty catchy last year . 
  and who can forget [ probably the most influential winner of all time ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fsvemz1f5c ), 
  pontare may be insane , but i quite like his music . 
  both of his ... native themed songs were way better in swedish though . 
  i think you mean `` big thing '' rather than `` big deal '' . 
  not me , but [ elfdalian ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elfdalian ) is more of a separate language than a dialect . 
  i ca n't understand a word of it . 
  the big feminist groups here are of the opinion that prostitution is a form of oppression , especially due to the all-too-common human trafficking cases . 
  the goal is ( usually said to be ) to make sweden a bad market for human trafficking in an attempt to do what we can to stop it . 
  prostitution mostly seems like something with no good way to handle it . 
  the swedish way is n't very good , [ the dutch still have problems ] ( http://amsterdamherald.com/index.php/rss/705-20130219-dutch-politicians-study-swedish-prostitution-laws ) ... 
  dutch sounds like a drunk dane trying to speak german to me . 
  not to mention that at christmas you just replace p\u00e5skmust with julmust ( the only difference is the label ) . 
  good thing he 's selling fish then . 
  i 'm not sure anyone knows . 
  there 's a myth about it having to do with archers during some wars with the french , but that 's the only story i 've heard and it 's not true . 
  yeah , it 's pretty surprising . 
  a few years back they had an exercize close to my hometown , in a town of ~ 10,000 people hundreds of kilometers from any military base . 
  weird as hell to meet an armoured convoy when you 're going groceryshopping . 
  same in swedish . 
  most likely it 's because studies show that pedestrians hit at < 30 km/h has a 90 % chance to survive , but < 50 % at 45 km/h ( according to [ who ] ( http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/publications/road_traffic/world_report/speed_en.pdf ) ) . 
  2002 may just have been a bad year with such a low population . 
  29 deaths in 2002 , 9 in 2012 . 
  part of the `` glenn '' stuff comes from a hugely successful ifk g\u00f6teborg football team that had 4 players called glenn . 
  opposing fans started chanting `` alla heter glenn i g\u00f6teborg '' [ `` everyone in gothenburg is called glenn '' ] , but then the home fans took it up because it harkens back to glory days . 
  not from what i 've seen based on my nieces and nephews and their friends . 
  if anything they seem a lot more well-adjusted than my friends were when i was their age . 
  seems to be more of the `` kids today are terrible , back in my day everything was perfect '' stuff to me . 
  there 's also this :  the connections he draws are his own `` common sense '' conclusions and observations , he says , rather than based on scientific studies . 
  so is ikea since a decade or so . 
  i 'm quite fond of `` ty '' myself [ `` he kicked her , ** for ** he was a bad man . ] . 
  i do n't even know about any modern word to replace it . 
  * assisting * in the packing of bouillon cubes . 
  that 's my favourite thing about all these made-up really long words : it 's always about assistants , instructors or trainees :p, 
  swedish for `` oops '' is `` oj '' . 
  dutch for `` hello '' is `` hoj '' . 
  according to my sister some people thought it was odd that she would say `` hello '' after bumping into them etc. 
  `` nja '' in swedish . 
  we also have [ kr\u00e4ftskivor . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crayfish_party ) both are really just excuses to get drunk on snaps . 
  it 's true though . 
  i know a few english students here who have stopped responding to english in order to force people to speak swedish with them . 
  depending on location . 
  in my hometown we could only choose from german and french , while the next town over also had spanish and italian . 
  a year or two ago there were hardly any , but now they 're everywhere . 
  every grocery and liquor store has one , and none of them speak swedish or even understandable english . 
  never seen anyone give them any money either . 
  because australia is n't part of the ebu . 
  well , you ca n't seem to win anywhere else . 
  more general than that , good pr . 
  you get several hours of showing a few hundred million people how great your country is and how there are totally no human rights violations going on ( in azerbaijans case ) . 
  can confirm , how a lot of people eat it here . 
  even in school we always had ketchup when we had pasta , though ketchup was n't available most other days . 
  we also eat spaghetti with a knife and fork , and hot dogs with macaroni is a pretty common kids meal . 
  if it makes you feel any better , we still complain about the weather constantly . 
  maybe many of those without jobs have left the country ? 
  and both extremes are shitty . 
  i spend all winter tired from the constant dark , and all summer tired from not getting any sleep due to the constant light . 
  it 's maddening having < 1 hour of proper dark during the night . 
  i do n't understand why people care so much , not about the candy or about it being pulled . 
  some people complained and the company stopped producing it . 
  who gives a shit ? 
  there are some no doubt very bored people who complain about these things . 
  [ this candy ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xsiv2jc.jpg ) had to change its logo after an adopted asian man wrote to a newspaper about how he felt swedes were racist against him and people on social media made a fuss . 
  the candy `` negerbollar '' ( `` niggerballs '' ) had to change name after people on social media made a fuss . 
  both , as well as these ones , had been around for decades with nobody giving a shit . 
  the vast majority of people still do n't give a shit . 
  people still call negerbollar negerbollar . 
  there are overly sensitive `` think of the children ! '', 
  types everywhere . 
  our sad excuses for newspapers just cater to them more than in most places . 
  pretty impressive that they included nils holgersson , did n't think anyone outside sweden knew about that . 
  it 's not unreasonable to partially do that . 
  i would n't trust someone who has repeatedly said belgium is n't a `` real country '' or is `` made up '' to be the face of my government or involved in foreign affairs . 
  * ** engelbrekt engelbrektsson ** should get a mention i feel . 
  he started a massive rebellion against the then danish king of sweden after he failed to remove a very unpopular tax collector . 
  it lead to the king losing a lot of power and was a leading part of the dissolution of the kalmar union . 
  not as big nowadays but he was a national hero for a long time . 
  they also have to seek approval from the riksdag when they marry and are not allowed to comment on politics . 
  it 's no longer free in sweden ( though probably cheaper than in the uk ) . 
  there are few bachelors taught in english in sweden actually , including technical fields . 
  a fair amount of courses , but i think it would be hard to make a decent bachelors out of them . 
  there 's no way the government would make svt cut all entertainment shows . 
  they dominate the ratings year in , year out .
