  it seems helping people is n't a valid reason . 
  everything must be aimed at maximizing gdp and preserving national culture ( whatever that is ) . 
   a growing population is not sustainable . 
  a dwindling population is a benefit , not a problem . 
  sweden desperately needs more working people or our social services will crash . 
  it 's either that or drastically raising the retirement age . 
  not to mention the german market is large enough for an artist to do well enough singing only in german , which is n't the case for a lot of other countries/languages . 
  they 're always huge issues i feel . 
  `` v\u00e5rd , skola , omsorg '' [ healthcare , education , social security ] is damn near a slogan for the entire political system , especially with an election coming up . 
  you 're the ones with the [ church burners .

  he did n't pay the $ 15,000 fine either . 
  * we celebrate on christmas eve . 
  * the yule goat used to bring presents but had its job stolen by immigrants . 
  now it just kind of lays around peoples houses , [ and of course being ritualistically and illegaly burned every year . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/g%c3%a4vle_goat ) * we have special lights in the windows , usually in the shape of a star or an [ electric advent lights thing . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/elektrisk_adventsljusstake.jpg ) these are usually put up on the first advent sunday . 
  we also light advent lights every advent sunday , and have them lit while having dinner ( this is getting less common i think ) . 
  * christmas dinner is typically a type of smorgasbord . 
  must-haves include meatballs , prinskorv ( a type of sausage ) , pickled herring , and a christmas ham . 
  there is of course a lot of other stuff , but these are pretty much guaranteed on every christmas table . 
  * at 3 pm one of the most watched tv-shows of the year is aired : [ from all of us to all of you ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/from_all_of_us_to_all_of_you ) . 
  * we do n't have christmas lights like in the us , but it 's common to have a christmas tree ( with only lights , no other ornaments ) in the garden . 
  they started in the uk and are violent wherever they are . 
  it 's one of their stated methods . 
  they 're ... 
  i hesitate to call them terrorists , but they 're not just swedish . 
  great fun watching news reporters talk about it with straight faces . 
  we used to have it as well . 
  far creepier is the birthday goat , which comes to sleeping children and tap them on the back once for each year they have lived . 
   the court confiscated jones 's cigarette lighter with the argument that he clearly was not able to handle it . 
  what an excellent , excellent judge . 
  `` is '' = `` ice '' `` land '' = `` land '' . 
  afa are no better than fascists . 
  they do not accept political views that differ from their own and they will use violence to suppress them . 
  it 's alright , they 're only allowed to treat stuff that ca n't kill you . 
  like flu , which is apparently no longer dangerous at all . 
  not exactly about the language , but : svenska akademien ( `` authority '' on the swedish language ) is busy creating a complete list of all swedish words used since the fall of the kalmar union . 
  since 1893 35 books have been published covering words from a-t . 
  for sweden you really want to find a smaller brewery . 
  all our big brands are absolute shit ( except maybe norrlands ) . 
  i 've heard a similar one in swedish about a norwegian . 
  did you read the finnish ? 
  it 'd be the member states of the hre in the early 15th century for me . 
   they have no meaning in international relations but they have meaning in the daily lives of average americans . 
   for the average american neighboring states do play a much larger role in daily life than some european country they may have heard of a couple times in history class and have no exposure to their culture or media let alone no chance in hell of ever going there . 
  how does this make them in any way comparable with nations ? 
  all you 're basically saying is that us states are more important to americans than european countries . 
  my neighbouring town is vastly more important to me than china or the us is , can i now expect to just map out my local area and say that 's the same as knowing the map of the world ? 
  * jimmie \u00c5kesson , leader for the anti-immigration party sverigedemokraterna , has been quoted saying he would be willing to ignore the immigrationissue temporarily if another party sought to make a coalition with sd after the next election . 
  all other parties in the riksdag have rejected it and there 's some anger withing sd and their youth-group sdu . 
  for added bonus , the ruling coalition is a minority government . 
  you 're not alone , it 's been criticized for that in national media here . 
  really dislike that ( especially yolo ) , do n't understand why they did n't use goold ` ol lorem ipsum . 
  the swedish mining laws are all kinds of weird though . 
  big subsidies and low taxes on mining to encourage more employment , but much of the workforce is foreign . 
  they were n't on school grounds though . 
  the majority of refugees flee to neighbouring countries . 
  according to [ unhcr ] ( http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49e486f96.html ) iran for example has over 800,000 afghani refugees , and that 's after over 900,000 have already left . 
  19,000 afghanis have sought asylum in sweden since 2000 . 
  i think sd have also made it impossible for any of the two big parties to argue for any changes to immigration policies lest they be seen to be working with sd . 
  it was n't ( only ) afa though . 
  from the article :  the counter-demonstrators range from old ladies with walking aids to families with strollers , reports one svt employee . 
  afa are assholes for sure but this was n't them . 
  there were two injured , both from thrown objects . 
  if afa had been there there would have been more violence . 
  norway would probably lose all of their oil ( a.k.a. 
  the foundation of their economy ) though . 
  it seems like the map is more a map of cultural minorities than of separatist movements . 
  and there are only around 15,000 sami in sweden . 
  kiruna alone outnumbers them . 
  if they were to take even half that land they 'd be hugely outnumbered , and no doubt you could make a new map of a separatist movement wanting to go back to sweden . 
  everybody hates fjolltr\u00e4sk . 
  that 's pretty much my impression of the uk 's position on most eu legislation . 
  like them or not , they were ( and are ) extremely popular . 
  you feel someone who makes ad hominem attacks in parliament is a good representative ? 
  he is n't . 
  him and his type is actually a big problem for eurosceptics i 'd say . 
  norway is turning into one of those weird people with way too much time and money on their hands . 
  now now , they even went to houston i independence day . 
  some of the things people claim is just incredible . 
   the bfb report contains a series of factual errors , wrongly claiming for example that the eu is seeking to impose laws banning high heels for hairdressers , uk flags on meat packaging and olive oil on restaurant tables . 
  * idiom : det brinner i knutarna * literal : the corners are on fire * #meaning : we 're in a hurry . 
  * idiom : ha tummen mitt i handen * literal : having the thumb in the middle of the hand * #meaning : not being very practical * idiom : l\u00e4gga rabarber p\u00e5 [ n\u00e5got ] * literal : putting rhubarbs on [ something ] * meaning : claiming something ( i.e. 
  a cookie ) , possibly in an illegal or unethical way . 
  it also depends on the school . 
  my * h\u00f6gstadie * only offered french and german , but the one in the neighbouring town also offered spanish and italian . 
  england has a knack for doing well in qualifiers and the group stages . 
  statistically they 're usually very good , though usually not as good practically . 
  no offense to any englanders , you have a pretty good team but not top 4 . 
  it would have been better to skip swedish and pick another country . 
  never cared for hagelslag . 
  patatje speciaal and vla on the other hand ... 
  nah , it 's what keeps scandinavia icefree . 
  luckily for us swedes the scandinavian mountain range keeps the rain in norway . 
  the only hard part was ( and is ) working on my accent . 
  it 's all over the place , and i do n't like it . 
  svalbard is on there . 
  [ did you see this thread ?
