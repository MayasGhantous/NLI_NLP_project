  correcton : the hunters do n't want other things killing the things they want to kill ... i.e. 
  moose . 
  during that time swedish was the language of all levels of government ( finnish did not have a written language for the first centuries ) and the aristocracy , so there was a fairly large population of mainly swedish speakers in the country . 
  ] ( http://static.kokaihop.se/recipe/large/68965-137290.jpg ) because god damn , i want sm\u00f6rg\u00e5st\u00e5rta . 
  actually , just bring vla . 
  lots and lots of vla . 
  winter 's not so bad . 
  at least it 's dark when you want to sleep , unlike the goddamn summer . 
  what i do n't understand is why we have these terrible rivalries . 
  finland i hockey ? 
  denmark in football ? 
  norway in skiing ? 
  why could n't it be finland in football , norway in hockey and denmark in skiing !, 
  i dislike it just because of their huge market share . 
  still shop there , but i 'm not happy about it :p, 
  it 's very expensive ... unless you have a norwegian wage . 
  there are an additional two verses , one of which mentions sweden , but i 'm not sure if they 're officially part of it . 
  the danes make some fantastic crimedramas , it must be said . 
  we get tons of them . 
  not to swedes . 
  yeah , they are . 
  always confuses me . 
  we mostly kept to ourselves , really . 
  * lots * of wars between sweden and denmark over norway , the south of sweden , baltic islands ... every now and then we 'd be part of larger european wars , but mostly it was us , poland , lithuania and russia . 
  what confuses me is that i 've been told the uk is also northern europe despite being so far south . 
  indeed . 
  so many of these maps and stats contradict my prejudices !, 
  it 's a shame pollsters ca n't be honest . 
  i do !, 
  my sisters old boyfriend and his friends ( all dutch ) drank nothing but heineken , and lots of it . 
  according to an episode of qi , german tourists are most annoyed by brits claiming sunbeds by leaving towels on them . 
  it 's like some weird passive-aggressive war has erupted . 
   most pleasant : nordics that 's surprising , i thought we had a reputation for being constantly drunk on vacation . 
  maybe that 's just in the alps . 
   every university student in denmark gets more money for his stipend than his/her eastern and southern neighbors would get by actually working . 
  that 's because of cost of living though . 
  we get a similar stipend in sweden , and it does n't cover rent for an average student home . 
  if you could n't afford a 1 room , 18m ^ 2 flat sharing a kitchen with 6-7 other people on the outskirts of town on your salary , you 'd probably be unhappy . 
  yup . 
  house , garage and the fence were stolen , though the police think it 's a case of disputed ownership . 
  in good and proper swedish passive-aggressiveness , the other people just took the house rather than have a confrontation . 
  maybe you should have thought about that before losing scania , eh ? 
  as has been said , it 's probably because quite a lot gets incinerated . 
  still , in my apartment complex we have bins for clear and tinted glass , metal , plastic , paper , cardboard and compost , along with lightbulbs , batteries etc. 
  then there are recycling stations for less common stuff . 
  this is pretty standard and people are pretty good at recycling so i 'm not sure how the stats are so low . 
  sweden has low population density because much of the northern half is uninhabited forests . 
  [ it 's not that hard to reach a very large portion of the population . 
  ] ( http://www.nordregio.se/templates/nordregio/pages/tni.aspx?imgurl=/global/maps/per%20theme/01%20population%20and%20demography/02126_pop_dens_11.jpg&amp;imgwidth=558 ), 
  i 'll just be boring and say meatballs with boiled potatoes , gravy and lingonberry jam , possibly with some type of pickled cucumber . 
  `` belgium is n't so bad . '', 
  during swedish rule , it really was swedish rule . 
  the language of government was swedish ( though the lack of written finnish did n't help ) , swedes held most ( if not all ) influential positions and finns were in general poorer than swedes . 
  we may look at it as a sort of union of brothers now , but it was n't . 
  finland has a lot of lakes ( `` the land of a thousand lakes '' being a nickname ) and no fjords . 
  if it makes you feel any better , swedish rail recently bought a bunch of high-speed trains but there 's hardly any track that can handle their speeds . 
  so the trains cost more , the tickets cost more but the travelt times remain the same . 
  eurovision is n't only for european nations though . 
  morocco and a bunch of north african countries are eligible to compete . 
  one of my favourite comedies includes a ww2 veteran being stabbed , losing teeth and being put on fire before finally having to have his legs amputated . 
  this all happens after he gets on the wrong train , leaving him stranded in berlin in 1945 . 
  the protagonist meanwhile ends up as a soviet prisoner after being mistakenly believed to have commited murder , and is forced to help build the berling wall . 
  a would-be murderer is murdered , a nun loses her faith and a carriage full of war refugees suffer food poisoning . 
  it 's hilarious . 
  there 's also been flooding of at least two large cities , j\u00f6nk\u00f6ping and gothenburg . 
  they have blogs of swedes in most of the big e-sports though , so it 's possible they 'll try to add some more eventually . 
  the left youth wing probably got the idea from the tories but on the grounds of feminism instead . 
  it would appear they think every porn actress is a victim of human trafficking or something . 
  who are brought up in households which hold these views , which tends to skew their own . 
  see westboro baptist church for instance . 
  hooligans are groups who join up specifically to cause violence . 
  nobody is going to call you a racist for calling hamas or al qaeda an issue . 
   anecdotal evidence is taken as a must only anecdotal evidence * against * muslims though . 
  any other is discarded as leftist propaganda . 
  israel apparantly have a habit of mislabeling stuff produced in the settlements as well . 
  well , the article is from april 2012 . 
  if only ... 
  we won tonight !, 
  i knew it !, 
  only denmark consider himmelbjerget a mountain though . 
  y may be either a vowel or consonant in english , but swedish has * at least * 14 different spellings for the * sj * - sound and i think 7 for the * j * - sound . 
  and yes , `` j '' can be pronounced `` sj '' in a word . 
  we had a fair bit of focus on local ( as in , my hometown ) history in the early years , and later on it was more european history . 
  we did n't really have all that many classes on swedish history . 
  i 'm not really sure why ... 
  i can understand a few classes on local history - there 's a lot of it - but i do n't really know anything about the swedish empire , the 30 years war etc. 
  i do know we were taught about the [ march across the belts ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/march_across_the_belts ) but that 's about it . 
  my understanding was always that scania etc. 
  were won at the [ treaty of roskilde . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_roskilde ), 
  does `` saatana perkele '' work or is it just nonsense ? 
  yeah , the issue is subtitles for pirated versions . 
  they used to have subtitles for specific pirate versions . 
  clearly you have n't read aftonbladets comment section . 
  now now , there 's also a fair bit of * awful * attempts at appealing to younger voters . 
  reinfeldts dancing , for instance . 
  every swede would complain about svt . 
  meanwhile , svts viewing figures would dominate the charts as usual . 
  kids movies also have english versions though , it should be mentioned .
