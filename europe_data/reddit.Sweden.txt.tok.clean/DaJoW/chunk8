  i suspect whoever made the map did n't read the notes on the official statistics : those numbers include every case where there is a suspicion of violence : suicide , accidents and natural causes . 
  the actual number of deaths due to violence ( murder , manslaughter and assault leading to death ) were 81 in 2011 . 
  less than 1/100 ,000 . 
  the numbers seem to be very off anyway - as in weirdly off . 
  br\u00c5 says there are 95 deaths caused by violence each year . 
  even including manslaughter , the homicide rate would inly be about 1/100 ,000 . 
  yeah , br\u00c5 says there are about [ 95 people killed due to violence per year . 
  ] ( http://www.bra.se/bra/brott--statistik/mord-och-drap.html ) that figure includes manslaughter and `` assault with deadly outcome '' . 
  i know they have been popular ( they did something similar where they showed footage from a train for several hours ) , but i 'm thinking most people have it on in the background . 
  with so few truly competitive national teams i doubt it . 
  last womens world cup sweden won with a goal difference of 102-5 . 
  only 2 countries have ever won the mens world cup , and only twice has the final been between anyone but sweden and finland . 
  it is a great sport though and given the chance i 'm sure it could spread . 
  it sure looks like [ petain ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/philippe_p%c3%a9tain ) on the stamp , which would make it from vichy france . 
  you linked the same video twice : [ for he is an englishman . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fb8snjiqyo ), 
  i think everybody dislikes hearing `` their '' accent in another language . 
  political correctness = gulag ? 
  those are n't supposed to provide any form of liveable wage though , just to give kids a chance to earn some extra money ( and cover for people on holiday short-term ) . 
  average wage for a window cleaner ( for example ) is about $ 22/hour before taxes . 
  the flag is inverted . 
  denmarks flag is white cross on red background , the one in the picture is the english flag . 
  more like 16 % of spanish residents asked were foreign-born and had learned the language i 'd guess . 
  it 's been a long time since i 've been present when someone has gotten a tip . 
  fancier restaurants maybe ? 
  i do n't eat out much . 
  i 'm so tired of this debate . 
  every year it 's the same thing : * environmentalists say the wolves have a right to live . 
  * * naturv\u00e5rdsverket * says the wolf population is still very frail ( hence the inbreeding ) . 
  * the eu says the hunt is illegal . 
  * the hunters say the wolves kill their dogs and steal their prey . 
  * the farmers say the wolves kill their livestock . 
  nothing ever comes of it , just people shouting the same thing at eachother in debates and newspapers . 
  i have n't heard anything about it so ca n't really comment . 
  you might have better luck in / r/sweden . 
  feels like it , yeah . 
  you should try swedish !, 
  we have ( at least ) 5 ways of spelling the `` y '' - sound in `` yes '' , * 18 * ways of spelling the `` sj '' - sound and there are no rules about which of the two definite articles to use with a noun . 
  i must say , you make a very compelling case . 
  interesting that you remembered andorra and liechtenstein but forgot luxembourg . 
  1500 thousand years ? 
  that 's a pretty big slip-up . 
  an investigative show in sweden did something similar a few years ago . 
  they had a guy call companies and real estate agents and introduce himself as muhammed and ask about openings/apartments , then do the same thing calling himself j\u00f6ns a week later . 
  huge difference . 
  oh no , norway lost a peninsula !, 
  astrid lindgrens works would be the most obvious ones i guess . 
  those and strindberg if you want heavier stuff . 
  well , the biggest entertaiment shows here are `` p\u00e5 sp\u00e5ret '' and `` s\u00e5 ska det l\u00e5ta '' , but they probably wo n't make much sense if you do n't speak swedish ( especially `` p\u00e5 sp\u00e5ret '' ) , but if you 're curious : `` p\u00e5 sp\u00e5ret '' ( `` on track '' ) is one of the longest-running shows on swedish television , and is generally the most watched show any given week it 's airing . 
  the show shows clips of journeys ( train rides etc. ), 
  while the presenter reads out hints about the destination . 
  the two teams ( made up of celebrities ) are then to guess where they are going as quickly as possible to score the maximum amount of points . 
  once they `` arrive '' there are a series of questions about the city , country , culture or an industry they are famous for . 
  the hints are usually made up of wordplay and historical events , so it might be tricky to follow if you do n't speak swedish . 
  `` s\u00e5 ska det l\u00e5ta '' ( `` how t should sound '' ) is also a competition between two teams , here usually a mix of comedians and artists . 
  there are a number of rounds all based on knowing music . 
  [ i found an episode on youtube if you 're interested . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyllpy50dnq ) the banter might be tricky if you do n't know swedish , but the singing should be alright i suppose . 
  yeah , but he 's doing a bachelors . 
  i know bachelors in english are ( pretty ) rare in sweden at least . 
  those are not trick questions . 
  those are just biased , and worded in ways to make you agree with the questioner . 
  and the mandatory boiled potatoes nobody really cares about . 
  and the kn\u00e4ckebr\u00f6d . 
  julkn\u00e4cke with ham and scanian mustard ... 
  i 'm practically drooling . 
  it 's very cute . 
  like a more family-oriented version of the queens speech i suppose . 
  being pc has become offensive to a lot of people somehow ( sd and their supporters tend to talk about the `` pc-mafia '' oppressing them ) . 
  then there are some who believe the suggestions is removing `` he '' and `` she '' with `` hen '' and claim lunacy on the whole thing . 
  then there are ( a few ) others who claim it 's just a lgbt attack on the language . 
  it 's really weird . 
  yeah , this pops up every few months but the guy really does have major issues . 
  he is n't getting disability because he likes music , he gets it because he is obsessed . 
  i 'd also like to point out that these `` news '' are 5 years old , and even the source in the article is some 18 months old . 
  [ the worlds largest dalah\u00e4st , obviously . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/dalah%c3%a4st_i_avesta.jpg ), 
  i 'll just try to clarify in case google translate is unclear ( based on a shorter article in [ dn.se ] ( http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/sd-karriar-med-hjalp-av-sjukbidrag ) ) : the allegation is that he received welfare due to his inability to work while forging a political career , including serving on a city council and becoming one of the leading figures of his party . 
  he continued receiving welfare for over 2 years after he should have stopped . 
  a [ swedditor ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/sweden/comments/153r4p/sdtopp_bidragsfuskade/c7j1v2s ) calculated it to be roughly 15,000 euros , possibly as much as 18,000 . 
  the party has filed a complaint with the police regarding a breach of confidantiality , and the man has stated he finds the whole thing insulting . 
  the classical stuff to see in stockholm are the old town , changing of the guard at the castle ( not sure when that happens ) and [ vasamuseet ] ( http://www.vasamuseet.se/en/ ) - it is quite impressive and the tour was very interesting . 
  the technical museum is n't bad but there 's probably not much there you would n't find in any technical museum ( at least not last time i was there ) . 
  there are also several good ( i 've been told ) theaters etc. 
  the archipelago is , i think , mostly for the summer . 
  you could also pop over to uppsala if you have the time and see the cathedral , the university house , the castle and the botanical garden ( depending on when you visit ) , along with the old part of town and ( i think ) 17 runestones all in a very small area . 
  you could easily have a look at it all in two hours or so . 
  if you 're very interested in history [ gamla uppsala ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gamla_uppsala ) might also be interesting , though there is n't a whole lot to see afaik and it 's quite far from the city centre . 
  ( as you may have noticed , i know a fair bit more about uppsala than stockholm :p ), 
  i agree . 
  it 's my impression that many uk politicians and a large part of their media are only interested in being one of the `` big boys '' , but without their level of integration and often on the opposite side of them . 
  it seems only natural for the uk not to be one of the leading voices if they 're constantly opposing the other big countries without really gathering any support - just getting opt-out clauses for themselves rather than working with other countries who more-or-less agree with them . 
  have n't heard of anyone doing it in uppsala either . 
  it 's interesting that the only sources for this in swedish are `` alternative news '' sites ( read : conspiracy theorists ) , ronpaul.se ( a blogg ) and a religious news site . 
  makes it very hard to get any at least slightly realiable facts about it . 
  edit : ah , there we go . 
  not surprisingly swedish media does not mention the boys name . 
  so , what has happened ( all sources in swedish ) : the parents decided to homeschool the child without state approval and oversight ( this is required in sweden in order to ensure the welfare of the child ) and were sentenced to fines ( ~ 40usd ) for every day the child was absent from school . 
  this is the last resort for local authorities , and the parents refused to pay . 
  [ [ 1 ] ] ( http://www.helagotland.se/nyheter/artikel.aspx?articleid=5040833 ) later on a court decided the child should be removed from his parents through lvu , the law for care of children , due to lack of physical and mental care and lack of education ( the exact wording is `` isolation from learning '' ) .
