  lvu is a long and demanding process with extensive requirements of the court and social services before a child can be removed from his parents . 
  [ [ 2 ] ] ( http://www.helagotland.se/nyheter/artikel.aspx?articleid=5528308 ) the child was taken from them as they were preparing to move out of the country , and social services describe the incident as a failure on their part . 
  this article also mentions the reason the parents did not want the child to go to school : he does n't like `` stressful , noisy environments '' . 
  [ [ 3 ] ] ( http://www.helagotland.se/nyheter/artikel.aspx?articleid=5436553 ) the decision was appealed to the european court [ [ 4 ] ] ( http://www.helagotland.se/nyheter/artikel.aspx?articleid=6110059 ) and the judicial ombudsman [ [ 5 ] ] ( http://www.helagotland.se/nyheter/artikel.aspx?articleid=5440810 ) but nothing seems to have come of it . 
  the father was later charged with kidnapping after taking the child and leaving during a visit . 
  [ [ 6 ] ] ( http://www.helagotland.se/nyheter/artikel.aspx?articleid=6523999 ) tl ; dr : parents refuse to let child attend school . 
  parents do not fulfill requirements for homeschooling . 
  the parents are issued fines but refuse to pay . 
  child is found to have suffered physically and mentally , and the education to be sub-par . 
  the child is to be taken from the parents through lvu , and the parents try to move to india . 
  finland a full liter under average alcohol consumption ? 
  yet another stereotype ruined by facts !, 
  funny thing is , we think of it as a german thing ( like everything else unfashionable ) . 
  only person i 've ever seen where that is my father , and only while he 's working in the garage . 
  for those who do n't know , stenmark was so dominant that they changed the rules . 
  that or beating the finns for olympic gold in hockey . 
  [ people did seem to overreact a bit , yeah .

  just as an fyi , the word is [ shtick . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shtick ), 
  that 'd be cheap for a pint in sweden , especially if it 's for anything but the shitty local stuff ( falcon , pripps ) . 
  probably because they have twice the population . 
   fries of war ? 
  prefer speciaal myself . 
   i 've never heard anyone here express the sentiment that they actually wanted a gun ( with the exception of some criminal types i used to hang out with when i was younger ) . 
  yeah , the people i hear talk most about guns are the type of people who should under no circumstance be allowed to have one . 
  not criminals , but reckless and just generally unaware of consequences and risks . 
  one in particular talks about his excessive speeding ( 200 + km/h on a 70km/h road without streetlights ) and guns pretty much every time i talk to him . 
  texas was a country for 10 years . 
  catalonia was a country for several centuries and has its own language . 
  there is no comparison . 
  in addition to what others have said , `` sexual offences '' includes everything from rape to being harassed on the street . 
  the point of giving them permanent residency is so that they wo n't have to worry about being sent back while the war is still going on , or being sent back to be homeless in the ruins . 
  this is also nothing new : refugees from the balkans were given permanent residency in the 90 's . 
  how does swedish politics not matter in a thread about swedish politics ? 
  but fine . 
  do you think kokoomus or kristillisdemokraatit would invite vasemmistoliitto to discuss business regulation or the like ? 
  7 parties representing 87 % of seats in parliament are meeting to craft a bill . 
  it 'd be madness if every bill presented to parliament had to be crafted jointly by every party . 
  we 've had minority governments pretty much constantly for the last 40 years . 
  parliamentary practice has always been pretty pragmatic in letting the largest coalition available rule in order to keep government working . 
  sd breaking practice necessitated d\u00d6 , an agreement between the other 7 parties basically sying they will follow the old parliamentary practice for the next two elections . 
  in the current state it 's actually very difficult for sd to topple any coalition larger than itself . 
  nobody was upset over the left party having no say under the last government . 
  that 's just how it is : smaller parties have less say . 
  sds views are diametrically opposed to the views of the other parties . 
  it 's like inviting tea party members to a discussion on which taxes to raise - they 'll just say `` none !, 
  stop this ! '', 
  and not add anything to the conversation . 
  everyone knows their views and that they wo n't budge . 
   parties with socialist ideals are n't excluded from talks about business . 
  sure they are . 
  the left party was never included in talks with the last government . 
  sd used a racist slogan 10 years ago . 
  there 's a difference of scale . 
  sd was founded by a group from [ `` bevara sverige svenskt '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bevara_sverige_svenskt ) ( `` keep sweden swedish '' ) and they used the slogan well into the 2000 's - less than a year before the current chairman took office . 
  bss is famous for a poster telling white women not to `` sully their race , their sweden , their family '' by having sex with aids-carrying negroes . 
  [ this image ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bevara_sverige_svenskt#/media/file:sdsticker.jpg ) is still used by sd ( without the slogan and with some minor changes ) . 
  their current party program says that being a swedish citizen is not the same as being a member of `` the swedish nation '' , and depending on your interpretation of the rest of the program they may be advocating for fighting `` un-swedishness '' - such as following the wrong religion - among citizens . 
  it may just be poorly worded , but it is clear that they take a dim view of acting `` un-swedish '' ( with examples including following the wrong religion , listening to the wrong music , and celebrating the wrong holidays ) . 
  87 % of the seats in parliament are represented at the meeting . 
  does every single party have to weigh in on every single bill written ? 
  they 're crafting a bill . 
  you ca n't do that in parliament , it 'd take a very long time . 
  7 parties and 87 % of the seats in parliament are represented at the meeting . 
  it is very much a cross-party compromise . 
  d\u00d6 is the only possible solution as long as alliansen remains and sd keep voting against every cabinet budget . 
  if not for d\u00d6 , we 'd have had a new election . 
  perhaps alliansen would have become the largest bloc , perhaps the left would have , but they would not have had a majority . 
  next budget , sd sinks the cabinet budget . 
  there 's a new election . 
  repeat until one group has a majority or sd stops . 
  the main thing : ** this is nothing new ** . 
  we 've had very few majority governments , but minority governments have been able to rule because of parliamentary practice saying that each party only votes for their own proposal . 
  nobody cared , and it was a fair enough way of keeping the country going . 
  sd breaking that practice means that another solution had to be found . 
  it 's not a formal discussion in parliament . 
  it 's an informal meeting between party leaders to try to come up with a joint proposal in parliament . 
  that 's it . 
  it is not a requirement of democracy for every party to have a say in crafting bills before they are presented to parliament . 
  or else the man will work and send back money until the rest can be brought over . 
  it costs a lot of money to get people in the eu and it 's a hell of a lot easier paying for the rest of the family if the first arrival can get a job . 
  22 million with a 5m change . 
  it 'd be far , far more with a 60m increase . 
  it is n't , we 've just hade 2-3 extremely good ones . 
  damn near everyone following football here seem to support liverpool . 
  true , you 'd 've been better off still living in a tribal society . 
  a 17th century caf\u00e9 in my parents ' town burned down . 
  it was horribly overpriced and now it 'll be socially acceptable to go to another caf\u00e9 . 
  they put up fliers telling `` swedish girls '' not to sleep with `` niggers '' in order to `` protect their race '' . 
  bss members formed sd . 
  sd used the slogan `` bevara sverige svenskt '' until the late 90 's . 
  i genuinely do n't see how people do n't find it troubling that the current leadership joined a racist if not neo-nazi party and rose to power in it . 
  a re-election would not have changed anything . 
  v+s+mp would not have had a majority , the alliance would not have had a majority , and sd would not have had a majority . 
  the alliance would not be willing to break up or work with sd , and v+s+mp would not have worked with sd . 
  when the next budget was proposed and sd again , breaking practice , sinks it , we 'd have another re-election , changing nothing . 
  without d\u00d6 we 'd have a re-election every year until one group gets a majority . 
   ( why on earth did a pro-welfare , anti-immigration party support the budget of the anti-welfare , pro-immigration moderaterna last year ) because the cabinets budget did not restrict immigration . 
  they 've publicly said they will do whatever they can to sink all cabinet budgets that does not do this , regardless of the alternative .
