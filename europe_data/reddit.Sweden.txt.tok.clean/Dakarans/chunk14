  if you give notice , you can miss ** one ** whole session and still have the right to your nation when you come back . 
  do note that the availability of free nations is low right now especially ones that are n't in the immediate conquest zone of someone else leaving primarily colonial nations as okayish picks . 
  ** - i can only join for 3 hours , not 4 , is that fine ? 
  ** ** answer : ** then join for 3 hours and leave before 4 . 
  that 's fine  ** - i came 10 minutes late and you have already started / i crashed / i got annexed and disconnected , what do ? 
  ** ** answer : ** we will be playing with a ton of people . 
  that means we unfortunately ca n't be restarting every time someone joins or disconnects . 
  we will be having ~ 2 restarts total for everyone that came late or crashed to be able to rejoin , so it 's not the end of the world . 
  in general the first one will be around 21:15 cest ** - i am bad at this game ** you are absolutely welcome !, 
  most of us were n't experienced players in the last game and we had a ton of fun with a lot of wars , plots , politics , etc. 
  ** - i have never played this game before ** you are also absolutely welcome but ... you probably wo n't enjoy this . 
  the game is super complicated and you wo n't understand most things and a 20-40 player game is usually a wild west mess so that would make it even harder to understand . 
  i would personally suggest skipping this week and trying the game in sp first - and then join us once you know at least some basics . 
  it is really fun !, 
  ** - my internet is trash , can i join anyway ? 
  ** ** answer : ** sure but ... your internet probably ca n't handle it if it 's really bad . 
  if you slow down the game too much , it 's not practical to participate . 
  we need to keep a consistent speed 2 and if you ca n't handle that ... sorry . 
  if you are not sure , feel free to join and see how it goes  *************************** ** - rules ? 
  ** answer : last game we had only a surrender rule and no other rules which produced some weird situations , so we 've agreed to set up some basic ground rules : * ** we are limiting the number of player allies to 2 . 
  ** basically , what this means is that you can have at most 2 allies which are played by humans , but as many ai allies as you can get . 
  the reason for this is preventing unrealistically huge alliances which stifle the whole game because everyone 's too afraid to do anything . 
  we want to get a lot of smaller alliance blocks for greater diplomacy and tension !, 
  ** addendum to the above rule : ** the above rule means that you are n't supposed to be alliance jumping . 
  you ca n't simply quickly break an alliance to ally someone else just to intervene in a war . 
  if you want to defend/attack someone with some other player , you either have to ally them beforehand , you can guarantee them ( which does not count towards alliance limits ) , you can `` enforce peace '' or you can simply declare a seperate war . 
  seperate war is important because if the attacked nation surrenders to one of the aggressors , they have to accept so they can turn on you , making ganking up more risky . 
  breaking alliances in peacetime is , of course , fully allowed . 
  it is also fully allowed to not defend an ally that is attacked . 
  * ** if you 're in the top 6 at the start of the session you 're limited to only 1 other top 6 player as an ally . 
  ** top 6 for this round are : 1 . 
  ottomans 3 . 
  bohemia 6 . 
  france [ spreadsheet here ] ( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mp9xwj3kbdeh05g5zaowsn7n4jnt5q6wyxfmhmg2bmu/edit?usp=sharing ) * ** after the first round , you are not allowed to pick a vassal or pu ( personal union ) of a player nation without the permission of that player . 
  ** you can pick one at the 1st round 's start though . 
  * ** you are allowed to play a player 's colonial nation ( i.e. 
  thirteen colonies in eastern america ) once those are created . 
  ** however , you are limited to two nations supporting your independence , and if you lose your independence war , you lose control of the colonial nation and it has to stay ai . 
  glory is there for those who seize the opportunity , but choose wisely !, 
  * ** try to be a sporting player . 
  ** this is more of a suggestion since this can hardly be enforced . 
  you are of course allowed ( and encouraged ) to declare war on whoever you think , and take what suits you and what you can conquer !, 
  do try and play fair ( ish ) at least , do n't deliberately gank people with like 5 separate alliances on your side , try not to crush someone completely at the very beginning of the game ( unless it 's like you 're castille and he 's navarra because that 's natural ) , etc. 
  do n't abuse exploits if you find any or consistently try to bypass the house rules . 
  feel free to plot and scheme with/against players though , it 's one of the most fun parts of the game !, 
  * ** no nation ruining . 
  ** if someone surrenders ( by saying ` i surrender ' in general chat ) , you have to offer them a peace deal at maximum 100 warscore . 
  taking more than 100 warscore per war is not allowed . 
  have fun !, 
  ** p.s. 
  feel free to ask any question regarding this mp game or eu4 in general in this thread or anywhere else . 
  do n't be afraid to ask !, 
  ** ** the savegame is on the old patch so do n't forget to rollback to 1.15.1 !!, 
  ** ** note ** game will be hosted and available for joining approx 15min prior to 8pm cest so try and join fast so we do n't have to sit around and wait for 5-10min because people keep showing up in the last minute and instead we can try to start near immediately at the designated time !, 
  hey again folks , on the 23rd of april at [ 6 pm gmt ] ( http://time.is/gmt ) , 8pm cest we continue our eu4 campaign . 
  the game will last 4 hours per session because previously people said 5 hours was a bit much . 
  it 'll be ending at a more reasonable hour for most people which is a good thing . 
  anyways , you can drop off at any time before that . 
  no hard feelings !, 
  there is currently quite a bit of independant countries available to pick up in the americas for any new player !, 
  ** the savegame is on the old patch so do n't forget to rollback to 1.15.1 !!, 
  ** we only ask to please take a major nation only if you 're going to be sticking it out with us regularly , because major nations , at least at first , affect the balance of the game a lot and it 'll be more fun for everyone if they do n't get imploded by the ai . 
  * p.s. 
  no reason you ca n't become the most powerful starting from a minor nation - that actually happened in the last game . 
  * ** to join : ** [ this is / r/europe 's steam group ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/groups/europereddit ) . 
  it is open for anyone to join so you do n't even need an invitation . 
  there are two ways to join the actual game . 
  ** first way : ** once you are in , we can invite you , just remind us to in the steam group 's chat . 
  you can also directly join by clicking join game on someone already in the lobby that is also in the group chat . 
  ** second way : ** i ( dakarans ) should be hosting , so you can send me a friend invite and then you can join the game through me by : * entering eu4 and going into the multiplayer window ( if you were in single player , you need to restart eu4 ) * open your friends list where i am . 
  * click on my profile * click join game button as pictured here [ friend profile ] ( http://i.imgur.com/oiyscji.png ) ** faq : ** * - do we use some sort of communication tool ? 
  * yes !, 
  for anything other than super secret plots ( for which we recommend eu4 's whisper and chat groups functionality ) , we use teamspeak . 
  you do n't have to join it , but we strongly recommend it . 
  if you do n't know how to set it up , please ask . 
  the teamspeak server details are : address : 185.4.149.102:9152 room : eu4game password : europe ** - i did n't play last session/last week , can i join now ? 
  ** ** answer : ** absolutely !, 
  the usual rule is that you can also pick any nation unless someone played it previously , in which case , that someone has priority . 
  but if he is n't there when we play , you can take it for at least that session . 
  if an absentee going to be late to a session and do n't want to lose your nation please post in the weekly thread so we know you wo n't be showing up . 
  if you give notice , you can miss ** one ** whole session and still have the right to your nation when you come back . 
  do note that the availability of free nations is low right now especially ones that are n't in the immediate conquest zone of someone else leaving primarily colonial nations as okayish picks .
