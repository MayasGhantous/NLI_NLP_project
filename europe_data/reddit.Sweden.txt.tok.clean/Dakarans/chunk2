  did you manage to get it from someone else ? 
  for future weekends is there anyone with a good enough internet and all the necessary content dlcs ( all but mare nostrum ) that could cover in case i ca n't make it for a future weekend and host instead of me , i 'm currently in a very busy period at uni so there may be weekends where i ca n't dedicate the 4 hours necessary to play this . 
  loving the maps [ here is the spreadsheet for next weeks gps ] ( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mp9xwj3kbdeh05g5zaowsn7n4jnt5q6wyxfmhmg2bmu/edit?usp=sharing ) ming has quite the sizeable lead following its westernization . 
  well you posted 7pm gmt so now we should prob start at that exact time . 
  otherwise we 'll prob face complaints from people who show up at that time . 
  since hound forgot to update the way score is determined or link the rankings , [ here they are ] ( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rplt4ibw_kxpjryczeoebpl2s2bcrw0hwznccopv2a4/edit#gid=1405204707 ) we 'll prob be taking dst into account from next week since 7pm gmt is what this post went up with but we 'll discuss it at the end of this session . 
   hamburg i 'm no longer the oligarchic republic of hamburg but now the even greater administrative republic of hannover . 
  reason for name changed , no longer swedes doing it to the poor people of the empire , but the glorious imperial army doing it to the swedes . 
  history changed , [ schwedentrunk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schwedentrunk ) never invented !, 
  genius move !, 
  can confirm , spain ate your exiled dutchmen . 
  we made the hre great again !, 
  now we 're gon na build a wall against the swedes and make sweden pay for it !, 
  - prussia steals the league war , turning bohemia into our glorious emperor . 
  - prussia crashes - ai prussia turns out to be a genius and declares the war to make hre great again . 
  [ save game ] ( http://rghost.net/7bcp7xyms ) since it was asked for . 
  actually if no one minds we 'll be running with the [ new system ] ( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rplt4ibw_kxpjryczeoebpl2s2bcrw0hwznccopv2a4/edit#gid=0 ) straight away since byenkow already ran the numbers . 
  no , only before he fixed the tech modifier . 
  oh wow thats really nice , i did mean something smaller on the tech modifier . 
  example 1-0 .2 / 5 on ottoman tech . 
  maybe the modifier becomes a bit small for asian and african tech groups but otherwise the impact becomes to high on eastern and anatolian tech groups . 
  i made an [ edited ] ( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nmuxjl4rp3iicndiaxplbqhudo-dmcqvc3jhd9guvw8/edit?usp=sharing ) and not as pretty version of yours . 
  actually if no one minds we could run with this directly from this session , otherwise the top 6 will be 1 . 
  ottomans 3 . 
  france 4 . 
  venice 5 . 
  lithuania 6 . 
  sweden if i remember correctly which i 'm sure many people realize make for a bit odd `` great powers '' edit : byenkows version is updated . 
  mr pope made [ this map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/59z3gyh.png ) if thats what you mean . 
  my lovely border gore looks greater than ever . 
  best italy is florence italy !, 
  make cusco great again ? 
  i 'd never take the wp he can beat ethiopia while holding the line in anatolia np.one of his stacks and the tunis stack would probably almost outnumber ethiopia 2 to 1 . 
  white peace if both sides agree . 
  if the one the peace is being enforced upon disagrees you join the war assuming the one the peace is being enforced for accepts . 
  if the one the peace is being enforced for declines , you do n't join the war . . from what i know . 
  i 'll admit to not knowing entirely what happens if the one you 're enforcing for declines . 
  in this case hedjaz would enforce peace . 
  ottomans most likely decline , ethiopia accept and war continues with hedjaz joining in . 
  if both decline i imagine at least that you do n't join the war . 
  arathian just posted that he wo n't be able to show up for the next few sessions so muscovy is fully free if you want it . 
  its tech is pretty horrid though . 
  i 've got a screenshot from the start of the last session showing which nations had players on start but a lot of player have rerolled into new nations or just left without saying a word so its not really a good tool for showing which nations have players currently . 
  i could post it however if you want . 
  list is score - score from victory cards . 
  castille is the only one with a victory card right now which inflates his number . 
  edit : ottomans has one as well but not enough score from it to change his position yet . 
  muscovy has fallen behind pretty far in tech and ideas . 
  enforce peace to join the war is an option . 
  you can ally but you are n't allowed to be called in the standard way . 
   if you want to defend/attack someone with some other player , you ** either have to ally them beforehand ** , you can guarantee them ( which does not count towards alliance limits ) , you can `` enforce peace '' or you can simply declare a seperate war . 
  top 6 nations for this session are : 1 . 
  ottomans 3 . 
  france 4 . 
  venice 5 . 
  lithuania, 
  burgundy decided war against england was a good opener if i remember correctly , then expected england to turn around and loyally help them out . 
  yeah got ta give some challenge and not leave a region to be just consumed in simple player on ai action thats no fun !, 
  bohemia was player till the first rehost i believe then did n't show back up or moved to another nation . 
  you abandoning your mali ? 
  : o got ta build that massive mali empire . 
  that playstyle might be fun in the next expansion as a member state in a trade league . 
  i 'll upload it with the next thread . 
  lovely map by the way . 
  [ world map before the session ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qfjoqha.png ) , 27th of october 1470 . 
  [ world map after the session ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jjmynt9.png ) , 1st of january 1500 . 
  some pretty big border shifts all over the place . 
  rip england , at least france is in big debts now . 
  wreck and now open i believe since the player rq 'd . 
  i do n't recommend it , its lost tyrol , the imperial title and is being partitioned . 
  multiplayer is n't as straightforward as single player . 
  if a player is seen as growing too rapidly it 'll make other players more concerned and they 'll be far more interested in containing that player . 
  last time i had some measure of luck in that the collapse of relations between france and castille let me grow in the shadow of france that was the one everyone was concerned about while i was slowly carving out the foundation of my overseas empire in north africa . 
  by the time people realized that i had grown beyond the strength of france the two blocks of europe were already formed and meant that i was unlikely to be ganged up upon and contained . 
  thats what has kept me alive this far . 
  only prominent nation `` free '' is england and that is with the risk of raz taking it back with the following part of the ruleset next week since he gave notice [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/48zp7y/reuropes_eu4_campaign_no2_round_2_coming_soon/d0oewql ) . 
   if you give notice , you can miss one whole session and still have the right to your nation when you come back . 
  of course you could discuss things with him and he might let you run the country permanently . 
  but england is open for this session . 
  in regards to nations a ton are taken , too many to really count considering we started with just over 50 players and in the end we still had just below 40 left i believe . 
  some will be free due to the fact that players do n't show up with no notice however . 
  i use 0 on the numpad but i 'm also stuck with a shitton more keys i ca n't use since they 're host hotkeys . 
  i know some use extra mouse keys as well . 
  anyway i do n't really mind having it a bit non-convenient since generally the ts is more for jokes , banter and harmless discussion . 
  only host needs it, 
  the orange color in northern hre at least indicates i did n't fuck up my start yet . 
  what you ca n't tell from the map is almost all the princes in the northern hre under ai control are under vassalage by one player or another in the hre . 
  i 'm kinda expecting to go down during the next 20-40years . 
  i started as the free city of hamburg, 
  ** state of europe , 27th october 1470 ** [ map of the world ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qfjoqha.png ) in 1470 europe is in turmoil . 
  war reigns all across western and central europe . 
  in the west the french-castillian alliance found itself embroiled in wars on all fronts . 
  it all started with a french declaration on the kingdom of england in 1463 , not content with driving them from normandie and gascogne . 
  the allies of england in portugal abandoned them . 
  the republic of hamburg rallied to the side of england but when their fleet was sunk their ability to impact the war was limited . 
  the english managed to replace their former allies in portugal with the tunisians , the rising power in north africa . 
  hit and run proved an effective tactic against the joint french-spanish armada with slow advantages being won by the english and their allies . 
  after a hamburgian expedition to try and attack what was believed to be an unguarded border in lorraine turned sour the republic was forced to abandon the war and sign a peace treaty with the french . 
  but while the french and spanish may have seemed to have strict grip on europe at this point in 1468 the republic of genoa with the aid of the pope and the florentines struck at the savoyards , a french and castillian ally . 
  seeking to end foreign influence in italy they struck at the perceived weakness of the grand alliance to the west turning the lands of savoy into a wartorn land .
