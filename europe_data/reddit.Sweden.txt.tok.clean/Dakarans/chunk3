  in 1469 the portoguese struck against the castillians with the support of the ottoman empire . 
  it turned into a disaster , the portoguese mainland is at the current date occupied and a portoguese counter attack will have to rally from the islands . 
  thus the french-castillian alliance find itself in a war on every front . 
  in central europe the hungarians are revolting against their austrian overlords and indeed it looks like the austrians no longer possesing the imperial title will stand no hope of holding on to the hungarian throne . 
  indeed the imperial crown falling to the electoral palatinate left the holy roman empire in a state of chaos . 
  without a powerful emperor to keep the princes in line borders have shifted rapidly and several princes have fallen with many more forced to kneel before a peer . 
  furthest to the north of the holy roman empire the republic of l\u00fcbeck finds itself facing a punitive war for its reckless expansion within imperial land . 
  in eastern europe peace reigns for now after what had been a bloody conflict in russia . 
  but word has it that the chaos that envelops the rest of europe will soon reach the land in the east . 
  -- ** the hosting ** in regards to the hosting i 'll be aiming to have it up 15 min before 7pm gmt and i expect us to be able to start shortly after 7pm gmt and we wo n't be sitting around as long in the lobby waiting for people who are late . 
  in regards to new players i 'm afraid the world is quite crowded since turnout was way higher than expected last round . 
  i believe the best spots for a new player to drop in would be either the indonesian area or a steppe tribe in central asia . 
  unless we 've got a lot of people not showing up however we do n't exactly have a lot of room in areas where you can expect to last for a whole session i 'd say . 
  -- also ** top 6 for this session ** ming , france , ottomans , castille , timurids and england . 
  italy disunited 0/10 florences given . 
  kommuner -  muncipalities and yes you 're correct after 2 years costs are shifted to the local muncipalities . 
  the ease of written accounts or transcripts is that they are way faster to process . 
  opening up a video and seeing 2 hours more to watch tends to lead to it not being watched . 
  either way thanks for clarifying appreciate it !, 
  ah i see , thanks having the efdd symbol behind them when it zooms outs as well as efdd being the uploader gave the impression of it being a politician talking in the first vid and admittedly i only took a quick look at second vid with it also having a political party allegiance in uploader . 
  that said is n't looking just at the tariff in average hitting 0.1 % of uk gpd a bit dishonest . 
  if the products suddenly wo n't be able to compete with tariffs added on thats not a loss of just the tariff value its a loss of the entire product value . 
  its not like companies generally limit their exports . 
  if they could sell to more people they would so having those exports end up somewhere else relies on having new deals with other nations that make those products competitable there . 
  admittedly i 'm not an economist but viewing the tariffs as a hit on gdp seems weird . 
  it would be the hit on competitiveness for the products and its ability to be exported that would matter not how large a percentage of the economy it stands for . 
  the jobs lost from businesses that ca n't compete in exports when faced with a tariff would seemingly be the main issue . 
  his numbers might be true , but without a source other than the words of a politician it ai n't exactly reliable numbers . 
  i 'm asking for factual sources . 
  do you do anything but try and twist the meaning of what others write ? 
  i was referring to the right for other eu-citizens and citizens of eea-countries to go work in your country and enjoy social benefits . 
  uk already has an exception from all things refugees that they do n't opt in to you silly goose . 
  same as denmark for that matter . 
  no , i 'm asking for a written source that backs up his argument . 
  argument might be right but not magically because he believes so . 
  seriously do you do anything but try and twist others words ? 
  just asking for a good source for the facts . 
  eea includes the freedom of movement for persons . 
  it means all those eastern europeans will come and take all your jobs and then smooch your welfare even if you leave . 
  norway is eea with all the 4 freedoms including the one you hate . 
  i 'm not saying numbers are wrong . 
  i 'm saying what a ukip politician personally counted a gain to is n't exactly a reliable source nor even a remotely independant one . 
  how is not giving special treatment making enemies ? 
  could you link a written source and one that is n't directly from a political party ? 
  even a slightly lower bias than straight from ukip does help . 
  edit : also most numbers i see put british exports to eu at 50 % of total exports . 
  hiding behind your domestic economy seems quite a silly way to decrease numbers . 
  of course but then do n't expect to have some special free trade deal with the single market . 
  eu is a protectionistic entity to outsiders . 
  the only full access to the single market would come from joining the eea and there 's no way you brits like that option much more than being in the eu . 
  noted , enjoy all the players in the neighbourhood !, 
  i 'm not the lithuania player but you 'd like me to set poland as free ? 
  is there any other free nation you 'd rather switch to ? 
  guarantees do not count towards alliance limits , if you can convince them to guarantee you thats an option . 
  there is no guarantee anyway that they 'd ally you regardless since there ai n't exactly nothing for them to gain there . 
  aside from that galley spam is a defensive option to keep the scary timurids away . 
  player alliance limit does n't apply to your alliances with ai 's and i do n't think there even are that many players in the middle east right now either way . 
  in general i 'd say it comes down more to how good your net is and if you 're running on wired broadband or not . 
  still open , so i 'll note you down on that . 
  i 'll note you down on mali !, 
  noted, 
  taken as well please have a look at [ the list ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/47rl8d/reuropes_eu4_campaign_no2_round_1_coming_soon/d0ftc5v ), 
  already taken, 
  noted !, 
  denmark , bohemia , hungary and lithuania are some of the larger nations still available in europe . 
  rnw slows at the very least down the speed at which people load the game since it has to be resent everytime we rehost . 
  i 'd at least prefer to limit the risks to making the game more unstable . 
   after the first round , you are not allowed to pick a vassal or pu ( personal union ) of a player nation without the permission of that player . 
  you can pick one at the 1st round 's start though . 
  from the ruleset . 
   do note a failed independance war is a pretty much guaranteed insta-annex . 
  i made [ a list ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/47rl8d/reuropes_eu4_campaign_no2_round_1_coming_soon/d0ftc5v ) , if i missed someone do notify me . 
  i made a list , if i added / between two names its because i know both their steam name and reddit name and it differs .

  lithuania , hungary , bohemia , denmark are probably the most notable nations still not picked in europe . 
  i do n't think we will be using random new world . 
  edit : also [ list of players ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/47rl8d/reuropes_eu4_campaign_no2_round_1_coming_soon/d0ftc5v ), 
  he 's one of the nicer players but not that nice i believe :p, 
  is n't aragon taken [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/47rl8d/reuropes_eu4_campaign_no2_round_1_coming_soon/d0fr82n ) ? 
  i think for some reason your post was n't showing immediately . 
  is the acc new ? 
  sometimes it takes a while before the posts of new accs end up showing i believe . 
  i 'll put you down on morocco . 
   unless you 'd rather have one of the other two . 
  just to confirm your friend will be showing up to the session ? 
  but he ca n't post before the session right ? 
  based on current amount of people having claimed nations/stating they will show up we are looking at 24 + people presuming everyone shows up . 
  the vast majority of these are in europe or near-europe . 
  i think we have 3 players currently in the far-east . 
  since this is a fresh start no nations have been played previously unless you mean the last playthrough ? 
  we ran the game at atleast constant speed 2 last session with occasional speed 3 if no one minded . 
  i believe we decided that one has to be able to at least keep up with speed 2 most of the time during the last playthrough . 
  the vast majority of the players had neither a problem with speed 2 nor speed 3 . 
  there are no pauses of course . 
  there is also a lot of plotting and intrigue involved which keep people quite busy during the game . 
  i also recommend joining the teamspeak to have some light discussion/banter between players . 
  it tends to keep the mood in the game better when you can share jokes and such in my experience . 
  * enter game as minor in italy planning to go tall . 
  * end up blobbing the most out of anyone . 
  : i at least i still managed to turn italy into mostly 30 + development provinces .
