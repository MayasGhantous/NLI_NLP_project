  the difficulty in playing any non-major and a lot of majors as well is how well you handle the diplomatic parts of the game as well as where you have other players competing with you . 
  i did quite well but italy as a region was n't stacked with players . 
  venice , me ( florence ) and naples were the only ones starting in italy . 
  naples failed their independance war and got full annexed in the first session so they disappeared real quick . 
  i also got a bit lucky in some matters . 
  i got to north africa way ahead of time since one of the minor players there sent privateers to genoa which handed me a cb to get a foothold there from which i could later push into full control of alexandria node and from there into gulf of aden , india and ethiopia . 
  had i not gotten that cb it would 've taken me way longer to get into north africa and if the ottomans had n't been weakened so much early on they might 've held the alexandria node instead of the mamluks who were powerless to stop me . 
  that said i still became a pretty big player by just consolidating most of northern italy under my rule . 
  there 's probably not a lot of notable nations in europe i did n't end up fighting at one time or the other unless they got knocked out very early on . 
  i 'd argue its a good nation with the strong capability to go tall in case you do n't manage to secure an expansion path outside of europe which was my original plan that i ended up putting to the side with all the opportunities that i got . 
  ottomans were a player for the first 2 sessions or so but they got ganked in session 1 in a very silly way . 
  the ottomans player had disconnect problems so the nation switched between player and ai during these early sessions as well between the rehosts which slowed down expansion quite a bit as well . 
  the nation itself stayed around for quite long though in anatolia . 
  byz had severe economical problems with debts and such so finishing off the ottomans took a very long time for them + few were willing to commit their armies to aid byz in finishing the removal . 
  bonus development and religious mapmode from 1773 . 
  [ religious map mode ] ( http://i.imgur.com/55iqcvg.png ) , catholics ended up evicted from most of europe and primarily still existed in the current and former spanish holdings . 
  protestantism made it big . 
  [ development mapmode ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ocjwwvu.png ) , italy looks pretty with all the green stuff . 
  for those who do n't know , red means a province is 3-9 in development , orange 10-19 , yellow 20-29 and green 30 +, 
  it is indeed . 
  yeah no problem but we do lack end game screens since a lot of people left prior to the end and even the final map screenshot is a bit messed up due to this . 
  ( i think we had been sitting around for ~ 10-15 years primarily talking in ts prior to that screenshot for those of us who were still there . ), 
  so lots of land have shifted by ai conquering from other ai 's that were previously former players .

  [ map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cdjwu7k.png ) of the world in 1772 , approx 10-15 years after most people had left . 
  the earliest ledger pics i can get ahold of without people having released vassals would 've been in 1735 which is ~ 15 years prior to the big wars in the end and do n't really show how the strength of my nation exploded around ~ 1750 and crashed any tiny bit of balance in the world . 
  there 's no such thing as too crowded !, 
  zoroastrian persia lasted till the end !, 
  pope is good , it was one of the things i considered, 
  you mean the timurids right ? 
  i recommend florence to any fellow fans of the republican form of governance . 
  this time you 'll find me further north in the free city of hamburg !, 
  as i said that opt out will be left alone with 99.99 % certainty but without the uk protecting the opt out on the area of freedom , justice and security its very likely to be pressured . 
  just seems silly with the uk mainly having an issue with the freedom of movement for persons which is included in the eea . 
  you give up all say in the area and your seemingly biggest issue with eu is still there . 
  norway and iceland are direct members of eea . 
  the eu does n't like bilateral agreements in terms of its fully free trade ( access to the inner market ) . 
  switzerland is the only nation that has it and its unlikely they 'd ever get it today if they did n't already have it . 
  that said if nations wanted primarily free trade joining just the eea is an option , its a bit wider than just free trade with the 4 freedoms . 
  ( free movement of goods , services , persons and capital ) with its only real drawback the fact that you have no say in terms of regulation and of course if you do n't want all of the 4 freedoms that is in it self a problem i guess . 
  whether uk can negotiate access to the internal market without bowing down and just joining the eea is probably the biggest question of brexit . 
  there is nothing indicating there 'd be any punishment , the eu would probably however be extremely reluctant to have any bilateral agreement in regards to access to the inner market for a nation that left the eu and will probably say join the eea with the consequences this has in terms of having to accept a lot of eu-regulation while having no say in how its formed . 
  maybe if the efta members become a too large group it 'd be possible for them to gain some influence but i doubt it since it would most likely be the same as abolishing the eu . 
  i 'd argue a big benefit is that this makes scrapping and replacing dublin iii easier . 
  the current rules have uk as one of the biggest winners and thus makes it a lot harder to change the rules with them in the system . 
  the other thing which i 'm not clear on whether its a benefit or not is how a british secession will affect the status of the danish and irish opt outs on the area of freedom , security and justice . 
  if the british do n't get out unscathed from leaving the union it is n't impossible that the danish and irish may be pressured to give up their opt outs in at the very least this area . 
  ( the irish schengen opt out and danish emu opt out are unlikely to be of any real concern to other eu nations . ), 
  in the face of the infinite legion a mere 5 % disc makes no difference anyway . 
  you are n't forced to get more than 10 seats now which means the bloat in terms of seats you have to convince to vote for you is n't as insane . 
  events will add more seats to your parliament though but its generally a lot easier to deal with now than it used to for larger countries . 
  i think i was the only to go go constitutional in the end however , monarchies prefering to stick to absolute for the 5 % discipline bonus . 
  i just wanted the income boost to fund my infinite legion and massive fort defences . 
  if you want other narratives you can write some more aars yourself . 
  :p the italian propaganda machine is the greatest . 
  i 'd rather start same time or an hour later rather than sooner and sundays are pretty much a big no no in terms of playability for me . 
  england , scotland and wales are under the rule of the kingdom of france and has been for quite some time by now . 
  democracies as in the modern variety are n't really a thing but the government forms english monarchy , constitutional monarchy and constitutional republic comes with parliaments in which some of their provinces will be represented and the ruler will have the ability to present some issues for the parliament to debate and vote upon . 
  examples of these issues would be increasing taxes , conducting nationwide land surveys or restricting imports . 
  to acquire the support of these provinces you need to bribe them . 
  based on the number of provinces supporting the proposal you 'll have a certain percentage for the debate to suceed . 
  since there has never been a great britain , a great britain can not vote . 
  besides i hear them absolute monarchies are n't too keen on the whole democracy or voting thing . 
  hindustan , mongolia , japan and liang still exist in the east with some power . 
  hindustan face continous attacks from me however and mongolia from russia . 
  i 'm not entirely sure what the status on liang and japan is in terms of players . 
  i think the liang player rq 'd last session after ai hindustan invaded and beat them up however . 
  the japanese player might return i 'm not sure . 
  otherwise exile opm kilwa in alaska could be fun lol . 
  are you sure that it 'll come in march ? 
  considering we are only 4 dev diaries in to the new expansion and it has n't had its release date announcement yet . 
  cossacks had its release date announces 1 1/2 month prior to release which even if we end up getting the announcement now would be in april not march . 
  i 'd wager at earliest it 'd be mid april and probably more likely to be in may unless the dlc is smaller than what i anticipate . 
  we should still be looking at a minimum of ~ 2 months of dev diaries more before release . 
  edit : addendum , the new dlc is 100 % not save game compatible so if we do start we 'd have to revert when it releases which should n't be that big a problem considering balance is pretty nice on this patch in my opinion at least . 
  you are indeed , you went from guy with just the largest navy and subpar army compared to all the other great powers to the guy with the largest navy and army . 
  the italian republic will be in attendance !, 
  and here is my aar/recap for the last session . 
  -- aar round 8 , 1666 -- 1720 [ map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hasjfzm.jpg ) before round 8 ( 1666 ) [ map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/u1wmjkl.jpg ) after round 8 , before round 9 ( 1720 ) ** renegotiating ** with the prussians changing their tune with the alliance forged , going from ` you may keep what you hold in germany ' to ` hand over augsburg . ', 
  the italians had set out to find a new partnerships to protect their interest that did not require turnover of their own land . 
  in the end the new alliance was forged with spain , france and hungary . 
  the hungarians who had suffered greatly following the intrigue of recent years were offered military support to regain what was rightfully theirs . 
  with the backing of the french and italians the outcome of the kosovo peace conference were reversed and the hungarian losses in that war returned . 
  beyond that italy offered up most of the remaining parts of mamlukian syria which would then also serve as buffer zone between italian palestine and the byzantine empire . 
  in 1675 the reconquest of the provinces hungary had lost to lithuania had begun . 
  with the armies of italy and france behind them the hungarians succeeded in retaking all their land as well as forcing the duke of bavaria , a vassal of prussia to cede m\u00fcnchen and prussia itself had to cede sjaelland to france . 
  it was during this war that the ortodox alliance consisting of russia and byzantium decided to strike against the lithuanians . 
  foolishly the lithuanians and prussians did not surrender to the hungarian offensive and turn their attention to the russians instead choosing to attempt to inflict as much casualties on their enemies as possible despite the costs it would inevitably lead to . 
  this lead to the dismantlement of the holy roman empire and massive losses for the prussians and lithuanians . 
  the lithuanians especially suffered from this , losing vast parts of their kingdom . 
  ** the great mobilisation ** with the threat from prussia and lithuania seemingly removed the republic once again turned its attention towards north-east africa , the arabian peninsula and india dedicating vast amounts of resources to secure as much land and trade routes as possible to allow the wealth to properly flow home to italy . 
  but while italy comfortably grew in the east another nation was increasing their power rapidly . 
  spain having largely abandoned their policy of funding nations within europe that would serve to slow down its potential threats had after having its anti-italian coalition turn against it focused on investing their massive wealth from both the new world and its recent conquests in indonesia and the spice islands into a grand army . 
  indeed the spanish army reached a standing force of over 500k . 
  italy was of course also turning the wealth of india into a grand army of their own . 
  by 1720 the italians had a standing army of over 350k consisting of some of the greatest soldiers in europe and the capacity to field far more . 
  ** prussia goes bankrupt ** prussia faced a large invasion in 1714 from several fronts . 
  the prussians fought to the brink of their own doom . 
  indeed the nation held out till january 1720 but in their stubborness they ended up in economical collapse , indeed prussia went bankrupt and still lost several provinces including some recently conquered from lithuania , small parts of the netherlands and the scania region , the northernmost part of jylland as well as 2 provinces in the southern parts of their country . 
  ** other stuff ** * the entirety of the arabian peninsula is under italian rule with small parts held by its loyal vassal hedjaz , it has completely embraced protestantism from the church of italy .
