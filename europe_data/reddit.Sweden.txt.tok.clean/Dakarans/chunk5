  in northeastern africa only kaffa and mamluks still hold some provinces and conquest by the italian republic is imminent . 
  in india the coastline has almost completely fallen to the italian aggression and the italian trade companies are a source of great wealth for the republic . 
  * malaysia suffered great losses to the spanish invaders leading to almost the entirety of indonesia falling into spanish hands . 
  * sweden lost its colony vinland in north america . 
  the recently independant colony was swiftly conquered by the french * italy pushed into the by ravensburg held swiss territories in an attempt to secure itself the vast majority of the alps to use as a defensive position in any future european war . 
  -- sadly for prussia its not 1750 yet so going rev by bankruptcy is n't possible yet . 
  the great powers are as of now ( as measured in score ) 1 . 
  italy 2 . 
  france 3 . 
  spain 4 . 
  lithuania 6 . 
  hungary 8 . 
  prussia with both lithuania and prussia currently dropping rapidly , hindustan and byzantium stand closest to reach into the top 8 . 
  however they are quite a bit behind and it remains to be seen whether they can grab the score gain necessary to climb into the top 8 . 
  spain , morocco and hungary are the current big climbers that are rapidly going upwards . 
  if one were to measure in actual strength there 'd be three real super powers in italy , spain and france . 
  and the notable great powers in russia , hungary , morocco and byzantium . 
  prussia will of course be counted amongst them if they manage to get out of their bankruptcy relatively unharmed . 
  and amongst these russia stand at the undisputed top in military power , what however makes me not consider russia a super power is how its currently behind in army quality , size wise its up there with france but quality wise it 'll struggle to compete . 
  we then have the mid size powers in mongolia and hindustan who are still holding on despite having lacked players recently by expanding into china and limiting how much they 've been weakened by their losses to russia for mongolia and italy for hindustan . 
  -- well probably just two sessions left guys , lets make it a great end and remember that becoming the revolution target is a thing after 1750 which can be a major game changer for someone who just took a severe beating at that point . 
  i 'm good at diplomacy . 
  anyway spain actually has a larger army and navy than me since he stopped tossing all his money into other players and started investing into buildings almost fully . 
  i 've got my land pretty well fortified however any war against me is gon na be a slug fest thats pretty much gon na cost insanely much . 
  just getting to my capital by land requires sieging down at least 3 lvl 8 forts before the lvl 9 fort of the capital itself . 
  and thats the shortest route . 
  and landing troops is risky business far likelier to backfire and end up with your troops wiped . 
  and in 1720 the end game is indeed here . 
  mondando put up a pretty big post in the group on steam and i 've responded with my own wall of text , anyway i think its pretty worthwhile to have these discussion in advance of the next playthrough . 
  eh its pretty much only 2 people even considering the restart . 
  i do n't think we 'll be quitting . 
  new guy , he drove it into bankruptcy, 
  when you said i had to give up augsburg i started looking for other options . 
  so by the time this session rolled around i was pretty much committed already to not remaining allied to prussia . 
  i like augsburg its a 37 dev province with massive base tax . 
  you did n't really offer anything for it either . 
  just mentioned i could have some provinces i could 've taken at any point for the last hundred years that were pretty low value in my eyes . 
  its even implied i did n't like that you tried to make me hand over augsburg in the recap/aar i posted before this session and was looking around for options . 
  [ before ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hasjfzm.jpg ) , january 1666 [ after ] ( http://i.imgur.com/u1wmjkl.jpg ) , january 1720 i 've got an aar in the works but i think i 'll publish it in the next thread . 
  [ map of the world ] ( http://i.imgur.com/t9s7wee.png ) before round 7 . 
  year is 1635 [ map of the world ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hasjfzm.jpg ) after round 7 , before round 8 . 
  year is 1666 -- ** the french led invasion of prussia ** the french with the support of russia , italy and bohemia attacked prussia and fought against the prussians and their lithuanian allies . 
  it ended in a french victory and l\u00fcbeck and hamburg were ceded to the french monarch , danzig to the russian tsar and prague returned to bohemia from lithuania . 
  the republic declared that it had no interest in further wars on european soil and that we should instead strive for ` peace for our time . ', 
  ** the kosovo peace conference ** following a hungarian invasion of the byzantine empire which ended in disaster the great powers of italy , france and spain intervened to negotiate a peace deal . 
  this thus lead to a limitation in land ceded to victorious byzantium . 
  only 3 provinces were turned over as a result of the war . 
  ** the decades of plots ** indeed this was an odd time . 
  at first arrived a stray message to the republic . 
  `` a grand coalition is being planned against you . '', 
  at first the leaders of the republic rejected this possibility . 
  and then another nation independantly approached the republic with the same information . 
  it did indeed start looking like the rumors were true . 
  and in response the italians vastly increased both their army and navy while sending out envoys to try and dig out more information . 
  it took some time but indeed a third independant confirmation that something were in the works was gathered . 
  it looked grim , italy seemingly stood alone against the vast armies of the rest of europe . 
  negotiations however with the prussian monarch led forward and indeed a new alliance was born . 
  but in the end the prussians could not settle for the original terms agreed in the alliance and instead trying to forcefully renegotiate the terms leading italy to look for other options . 
  and indeed the envoys of the republic have been busy looking for another way forward and mayhaps they 've found it . 
  -- just a short recap sorry have n't had a lot of spare time for this kind of things . 
  to be honest the ai got to start westernising of me since i screwed up when evicting hindustan out of the middle east and accidentally left them one province since i was n't fully paying attention when making the peace deal . 
  oh well makes the game more exciting at any rate . 
  the year is 1635 , easiest way to see the general state of the world is to look at the world map i posted in my recap post in this thread . 
  most of europe is claimed , the 3 ai nations that are to some degree relevant would be trier , cologne and ravensburg but they are still very much minor powers . 
  in asia most things are free . 
  if someone who played a nation last session does n't show up their nation is free for the takings as well . 
  dunno , i kinda think it 's fine to have cns under player control as long as there 's some house rules in regards to independance wars . 
  there is supposed to be a realistic threat of them breaking free later in the game and in ai hands this is too easy to counteract for a player . 
  the problem can just as easily be handled with house rules for when cns can do independance wars anyway . 
  in the case of pu 's and vassals i agree though . 
  its okay to pick those at the 1444 start but picking them when the other player has spent a lot of time vassal feeding them just to declare an independance war at the first moment is just silly . 
  i 'd still say a ld rule is pretty fair . 
  and as cn you 'd get high enough liberty desire pretty much guaranteed anyway . 
  no problems last week . 
  i 'm building a new silk road ai n't nobody got time for islands . 
  italy intends to keep the deal as well . 
  we have no interest in this new world . 
  italians do not concern themselves with the sillyness of this `` new world '' of yours . 
  true wealth lies in india and its wealth belongs to the republic . 
  for indeed the italian republic constitute the greatest of christians for it was under our banner that the holy lands once again fell under christian domain . 
  my recap is up now in this thread . 
  was very busy this week so did n't have time to do it properly after the game . 
  the italian republic will be in attendance . 
  now onto the recap for last weeks session . 
  -- [ world map before session 6 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mqznls5.png ) , date is 1600 january . 
  [ world map after session 6 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/t9s7wee.png ) , date is 1635 january . 
  ** westerners in the east and south ** * italy in response to hindustan conquest in the arabian peninsula launched an invasion with minor support from byzantium in which the italian army proved their superiority over the joint defence force of the hindustan-mongolia alliance . 
  at the battle of kalat 64 000 italian launched an assault on over 100 000 asians . 
  despite having the defensive position in the mountains on their side the combined army of the asian alliance proved incapable of defeating the superior italian army . 
  in the end hindustan was forced to surrender leading to them near being driven out of the arabian peninsula , left only with the province of al-qatif . 
  aside from the provinces in arabian peninsula italy also acquired the port cities of ahmadabad and goa from the hindustan vassal gujarat . 
  this means italy has become the first western nation to establish a proper indian trading company . 
  * following this the italian forces also conquered a large amount of provinces on the horn of africa and coastal provinces in the western part of the arabian peninsula . 
  this led to the coast of the red sea being fully under control of the republic . 
  the province of mecca was also conquered by the italian republic . 
  * in india the italians used their conquest of goa to launch an assault on the indian kingdom of vijayanagar which led to large parts of the southern indian coastline falling under their control . 
  * around the same time as of the italian victory at kalat the russians launched their own invasion , mongolia which eventually led to russia seizing notable amounts of land from the mongolians and pushing them further away from europe . 
  * spain settles southern africa . 
  ** europe ** * austria is partitioned by hungary , bohemia and italy . 
  italy found the bohemian share to close to the italian heartland and started planning an invasion .
