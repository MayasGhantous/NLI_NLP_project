  * swedish and bohemian attempts to form a coalition against prussia ended in a prussian invasion of bohemia . 
  france and russia rallied to the bohemian side but italy did not participate in the war due to a border dispute with bohemia as well as being tied up in a war against cologne , the emperor of the now defunct empire . 
  prussia and their allies were victorious seizing large amounts of lands from the kingdom of bohemia . 
  following the war the border dispute between bohemia and italy was settled and the republic promised that any following invasion by prussia or their allies would lead to an italian intervention . 
  this was extended to include bavaria following a bavarian invasion of the weakened bohemia . 
  italy was awarded with province of augsburg for their defence of bohemia . 
  * catholicism has nearly been eradicated from europe , indeed the only free nations still following the pope within europe is the defunct kingdom of norway , exiled to iceland , the bishopric of parma and the kingdom of spain . 
  * the holy roman empire is practically defunct with a mere 4 electors and barely any princes remaining . 
  * hungary , prussia and lithuania finish their partitioning of poland . 
  -- i probably forgot alot since i did n't do this one till today . 
  the current great powers are in order of rank 1 . 
  italy 2 . 
  france 4 . 
  lithuania 5 . 
  spain 6 . 
  hungary we thus welcome hungary to the big boys club . 
  i expect this will be an exciting session as well !, 
  you can have a [ world map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/t9s7wee.png ) at least . 
  i 'm busy with exams and shit so if i do write one it 'll be later in the week . 
  its not done at service provider level , its dm blocking swedish isps . 
  its quite the same but you do n't have the terror of no one wanting to ally you in the early game in sp . 
  i was pretty much friendless for like the first 10-20years of the game . 
  also you start as florence now with tuscany as formable country . 
  the largest difference is that there may be a naples player that screws up his independance war and gets annexed and then castille gets the iberian wedding on the big aragon and insists that the pope is off limits for florentine expansion . 
  aragonese holdouts , yes thats my republic of italy . 
  nw africa is morocco . 
  okay there are currently 3 major blocks . 
  the [ italian-french-russian alliance ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wvbmphx.png ) with sweden as minor power included . 
  ( french subjects not shown , cns in caribbean and na 's eastern coast as well as england as vassal ) [ the asian alliance ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ck2ahjd.png ) , it also includes japan but he was n't directly allied to hindustan but he is allied to pasai and mongolia . 
  finally the [ prussia-hungary-lithuania alliance ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4l4uqez.png ) , it used to officially at least include spain until the last session . 
  extra for the [ entirety of the spanish empire ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lxvz8na.png ) i presume you know what the colors mean . 
  specific questions might be more useful than these maps though . 
  welcome !, 
  i 'm not the nicest neighbour to people in my zone of interest though . 
  the purple color in greece and western anatolia is indeed byzantium . 
  there are n't really a lot of countries in good shape . 
  and a lot of them border a great power which means staying alive is very dependant on how nice that neighbour is . 
  i 'd probably suggest a french or spanish colonial nation but they also do n't make for the most exciting playthroughs and you 'd be quite limited as a subject . 
  you wo n't need anything but steam and the base game if you do join us now . 
  all of them !, 
  only host needs to have them so its no concern that you only have art of war . 
  pfft , you were just gathering everyone you could for revenge for the aragonese independance . 
  the italian republic will be in attendance . 
  first off that was recap not an aar . 
  :p also you linked the follow up post not the [ actual recap ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/42813u/reuropes_eu4_campaign_round_5_coming_soon_details/czbds11 ) [ world map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mqznls5.png ) from the last session . 
  the date is 1st of january in the year 1600 . 
  anyway i guess we 're running with the new patch unless a lot of people would rather not . 
  at least i 'd prefer to , the estate changes are really good in my opinion and i have n't seen any issue when checking out the save file . 
  estate loyalty and the new prestige effect on liberty desire are the biggest changes that 'll affect players . 
  if you have n't looked them up i 'd recommend doing so before the session . 
  i do n't think we have anyone with confucian religion but it received a nice buff as well . 
  they are a medium size power in a hotkeg region bordering both the big blocks , they 'll slowly go east . 
  its not like neutralities are locked in and most players will want to do some plotting here and there . 
  in a mp interesting developments come from the intrigue more than anything else . 
  even unreliable neutrals will be courted from time to time to try and tip the balance of power into your groups favor . 
  that said i do n't think we 'll see a lot of interesting developments until byz feels confident in being able hold his own frontlines in a war . 
  neutrality suits him well for now when he is n't willing to commit properly to any alliance , its already hurt his reputation as an alliance member quite severely . 
  and it 'll take a lot of confidence to start a war over his lands since the other side will most likely rally to his side if only to deny the others the conquest and try to secure his allegiance . 
  austria is really just having score from the first 2-3 sessions when they were actually a notable power , they get nothing nowadays . 
  excluding me most of the big 5 have been top 8 for every session i believe of the game . 
  prussia and hindustan are the big growers of the last 2 sessions . 
  glad someone enjoys my writings . 
  hungary had a player this session and he was included in the lith-prussian alliance to increase their strength after losing the war . 
  i 've got religious ideas so i convert stuff pretty quickly + extra missionaries from jerusalem and rome so i can convert a grand total of 4 provinces at a time , lots of protestantism spreading easily . 
  regarding the whole deal it was pretty much russias business . 
  the war was primarily to disarm a lot of the medium powers castille was collecting for a retribution war against us since we got aragons independance in the last session . 
  russia and lithuania has a on off relationship either russia tries to conquer him or he wants to be his friend . 
  it swings . 
  morocco should 've actually been mentioned in that he did not participate in the war despite originally being a close ally of castille . 
  england is indeed a french vassal . 
  war in europe is quite tiresome and it all depends on what is viewed as being in each great powers of the alliances interest . 
  not all may want war in europe where they have little to gain but setting back a future enemy . 
  whether war is in preparation is something i 'll neither confirm nor deny however . 
  first off i ca n't speak for others and secondly my recaps are recaps . 
  they are not stories of what is to come , that remains to be seen . 
  some believed the war would continue in 1593 when the truce ended yet we 've seen peace for 7 years . 
  the only one that can make proper land gains in this war on our side is primarily russia though . 
  you also need to remember that them officially being neutral now is no guarantee that they wo n't side with someone in a future war nor is there any guarantee that the current alliances that shape europe willl remain . 
  not too long ago it was a castille-french-florence alliance dominating europe . 
  now its a french-russian-italian alliance . 
  i 'm fairly certain most alliances want to keep some check on the balance of power in between each other to make sure one does n't get to far left behind and risk getting crushed when old friends become new enemies and old enemies become new friends . 
  the current great powers based on score would be 1 . 
  italy 3 . 
  france 4 . 
  lithuania 5 . 
  spain 6 . 
  prussia the eight is austria and considering how long they 've been down on their luck i 'd argue it says quite a bit about the other players being pretty far from great power status in my eyes at least . 
  there 's a pretty big divide between top 5 and those below as well . 
  so all money goes to the spanish armada eh ? 
  well i guess building a proper navy is a bit overdue for me as well . 
  even if you 're neutral i still got ta be able to secure the transport routes between egypt and italy . 
  ok i made you that recap now [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/42813u/reuropes_eu4_campaign_round_5_coming_soon_details/czbds11 ) . 
  haha , i 've been a bit busy with law school studying . 
  [ before session map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sssrk7x.png ) , year was 1573 [ after session map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mqznls5.png ) , year is 1600 , 1st of january . 
  a lot less in game time passed due to the fact that we had a lot of issues in game and pretty much ended up replaying the same ~ 2years like 3 times or so . 
  so now to the recap , i do n't have the energy for a proper aar and nor do i have the mood after this session . 
  i think the technical issues left us all a bit grumpy . 
  hopefully it 'll do !, 
   ** end of the league war ** the protestant league achieved victory and the duke of switzerland was crowned emperor and still holds the title to this day . 
  ** the great war ** the great war featured italy , russia , france and sweden on one side and castille , aragon , lithuania , prussia , byzantium , mongolia , japan , pasai and hindustan on the other .
