  it started in 1575 with the russian invasion of lithuania and ended in 1578 with a lithuanian surrender . 
  the aftermath left the following situation : * palermo ceded to italy from aragon * navarra ceded to france from castille * lipetsk and bryansk ceded to russia from lithuania * georgia freed from their vassalage to lithuania . 
  * byzantine neutrality in future european wars . 
  years later a treaty between the kingdom of spain and the kingdom of france returned navarra in exchange for spanish neutrality in future european wars with the spanish promised all the land in south america and mexico . 
  ** the partitioning of poland ** a treaty between lithuania and russia led to the russian , french and swedish ending of their guarantee on the defence of poland and led to hungary , lithuania and prussia partitioning it with only a small part of the polish kingdom currently remaining independant . 
  in exchange the russians received the provinces of tichoretsk , ekaterinodar and taman for a small amount of money . 
  ** other stuff ** * the italian republic finalizes the eviction of austria from north italy . 
  * with lithuanian and prussian assistance the kingdom of hungary conquers land from poland , bohemia , wallachia and austria . 
  * the byzantine empire pushes back the ottomans even further in anatolia . 
  * prussia acquires sk\u00e5neland from sweden following foolish swedish participation in a prussian war that was declared on bohemia . 
  * italy conquers large swaths of land from the mamluks consolidating their hold on the palestine and north east african region . 
  the population in these areas are now dominantly protestants belonging to the protestant church of italy . 
  * france embraces protestantism following an excommunication by the pope on the command of the curia controller spain . 
  * castille conquers all the aragonese provinces in spain and formes the kingdom of spain . 
  * italy conquers more italian land from the aragonese leaving them with a tiny bit of neapolitan land . 
  italy also conquers the provinces of nice , cuneo and piedmont from the savoyards . 
  * russia conquers large parts of georgia who are also conquering their way southwards . 
  -- i think this covers the most important parts of at least europe , in the second map colored wastelands is turned on . 
  aside from what arathian said you also have to take into account that the guy streaming is n't one of the wealthiest countries . 
  if you were looking at me ( italy ) or spain ( arathian ) , i 'm fairly sure you 'd see a lot more building . 
  to be honest i really think we should 've had a rule against taking a nation during a rehost that was played by a player that had to leave early . 
  being able to take the nation of someone that has left early and intends to play next session is kinda silly to begin with . 
  leaving early is n't the same as not showing up a session . 
  the purpose of the rule ca n't have been anything else than that we do n't want nations sitting empty a whole session 'cause someone played them once and might return in a future session . 
  its quite different from nabbing someones nation after they have to leave early . 
  m8stro was very clear when he left that he had to go early and would be with us next session . 
  indeed my plan if i end up getting eliminated in the next 2 session would be to grab one of those for the reroll . 
  yeah , sndrtj was m\u00fcnster in session 3 but could n't make it for session 4 and the ai wrecked his nation . 
  sndrtj did n't play prussia last round though ? 
  he was n't even here last session . 
  still has a like 6-7 cores on other nations around it though !, 
  i 'm sorry but it seems the protestant bishopric of m\u00fcnster has become the reformed duchy of m\u00fcnster . 
  is n't it a bit harsh to do so when someone just had to leave early one session . 
  its one thing when they miss a session its another when they go an hour early . 
  i kinda feel it 'd suck to lose the nation due to someone taking it because i 'm not there one session but losing it cause i had to go an hour early and someone else took it instead is way way worse . 
  dude plays my italy for an hour and suddenly i ca n't get the nation back in spite of playing it for several sessions and leaving one early would be pretty sad and would pretty much mean that leaving early is the same as losing your claim . 
  punishing people that harsly for going early is pretty extreme imo at least . 
  dunno feels like its just gon na make people join the rehost and then instant leave when they 've got to go to prevent others from stealing their nation . 
  would n't playtime on a nation be a better way of determining who has the claim on playing a nation . 
  okay i kinda checked these nations a bit more in depth . 
  poland is pretty much 0 manpower and almost no troops left with 9loans and about to lose more provinces to prussia from the league war . 
  rebels may be an issue in the short term damaging the nation even further . 
  bohemia has 8 loans , some manpower but pretty small forcelimits , i 'd actually struggle to consider them even a medium power at that strength . 
  techwise their quite good ahead of most of their neighbours in fact . 
  high we but thats easily fixable . 
  hungary only 5 loans but like poland your army is gone from the league war and your manpower very low with extremely high we and rebellions ticking . 
  half the country is already sieged down in the league war and there 's no telling what the protestants will demand from you . 
  i 'd recommend bohemia , i think they 're the easiest to get on track and you do n't start with the nation burnt completely to the ground . 
  yes , as far as i remember atleast . 
  there are interesting nations but they tend to be in a bit of a dire strait . 
  anyway i 'd say the 5 most interesting nations that have been player free for awhile would be austria , bohemia , poland , hungary and ottomans in europe or its very close vicinity . 
  that said they all come with pretty hefty drawbacks . 
  ** austria ** the reigning emperor of the holy roman empire . 
  tied up in the league war against the protestants and are being destroyed . 
  the league war will be lost anytime now , presenting an excellent opportunity for its neighbours to take a chunk of it . 
  alliances are with castille and ai hungary . 
  a shrewd diplomatic game may be able to bring them back into something resembling their former glory but its a wartorn country with italy in the south ready to finish driving the austrians out of italy . 
  ** hungary ** also tied up in the league war on the losing catholic side and weakened by the war . 
  holds a colony in south america that will lead to any player being presented with a cede this or war from castille unless castillian foreign policy has drastically changed in a drive to counter the french and italians . 
  comes with ai austria and player aragon as allies . 
  is bound to be dragged into the great wars of europe on way or another . 
  lots of diplomatic opportunities to seek friends on either side of the great division . 
  ravaged by war and lots of players around , will need to recover from the league war to make any gains . 
  ** poland ** player enemies in prussia and lithuania who wo n't hesitate to cut you up for more land . 
  about to lose more in land to prussia in the ongoing league war since they 're participating on the catholic side . 
  does however come with strong alliances in the players of sweden , russia and france . 
  these nations are opposed to further partitioning of poland and may become allies in a war to help poland retake their lost provinces . 
  poland itself has been destroyed in a plentitude of wars and is probably in the worst shape of all the nations i 'll mention . 
  you can easily solidify yourself into an existing alliance structure however . 
  ** bohemia ** since they are on the winning protestant side in the league war they 're not as war torn as the catholic nations in the hre . 
  but they are far from being a great power and lack any notable allies . 
  and even when the protestants seize the emperorship its far more likely to fall to prussia , who stands as their greatest threat to the north . 
  a medium power but a skilled diplomat may be able to find a way forward . 
  ** ottomans ** beaten , beaten and beaten but not yet destroyed . 
  they can still field some notable armies but they come without any decent allies with both byz and lithuania aiming for their head . 
  enemies in all directions and it would take a lot of negotiating to find players willing to restore them to all the land they 've lost . 
  they do however have a shit ton of cores to reconquer so the potential is clearly there . 
  its all about finding the necessary friends . 
  the ottomans are also halfway through westernization so reactionary rebels may end up posing a problem for the ottomans in combination with their debts . 
  they do have truces with both byz , lithuania and the mamluks so they 've got some time to prepare and rebuild . 
  -- either of these nations will be hard to bring back and you 'll start out in a pretty bad spot for all of them . 
  edit : ottomans also has qara qoyunlu as a vassal . 
  hehe sorry mate , i kinda wanted jerusalem and the trade node . 
  game speed is 2 , all nations are free to be picked but the person who played it last has first pick on that specific nation . 
  if you 're not there to play your nation it will be open for someone else to play . 
  we generally have 3 restarts every session to allow late comers and people who disconnect/desync to join up . 
  there 's no real specific time but generally around every 1 1/2 hour i 'd say . 
  maybe a bit longer but somewhere around that . 
  episode 5 : the evicting of spaniards and austrians from italy, 
  makes me feel good though . 
  see if you had n't been so insistent on not letting me eat the papal state i might not have gone to such drastic measures . 
  well , that and i truly did think you were planning on betraying me when you broke that alliance and did n't reestablish it before the truce ran out . 
  blame morocco for that , he gave me the impression that was what was going on . 
  georgia is a lithuanian vassal though . 
  the italian republic will be in attendance . 
  [ here is my aar ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4151x9/reuropes_eu4_campaign_round_4_coming_soon_details/cz0zzs1 ) from the last session for those interested . 
  and [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sssrk7x.png ) is the map of the world at the end of the last session . 
  i as italy am the green color in italy as well as the same green color in northern africa and a tiny part of the middle east . 
  the year is 1573 . 
  technically you can still do it as long as you continue to participate in dublin iii but as a lot of eu countries are looking to change dublin iii into something else that will probably feature relocating them it wo n't necessarily be around to participate in at that time nor forever .
