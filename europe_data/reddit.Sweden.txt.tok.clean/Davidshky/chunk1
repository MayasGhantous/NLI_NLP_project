i dunno man , imagine like a dystopian future in the year 2000 where the worlds oil reserves is running out and britain ( + other countries ) is being ruled by the evil oil company , bp , who rule with an iron fist from their giant refinery-citadel hq in london . 
  i actually like it as well . 
  it kinda looks like 50 % oil refinery and 50 % evil overlord hq . 
  like something from some dystopian cyber/diesel-punk movie, 
  well if you 're lucky , swedbank might decide to purchase you one day . 
  exactly !, 
  they could also be a potential source of information about isis . 
  like for example who the recruiters are . 
  dont give us that look . 
  \u00d6sterland is one of the four lands of sweden and just because some separatist rebels are in control of it ( for the moment ) does n't mean it 's not a part of sweden anymore . 
  latvia - riga : ** swedbank ** central office 123m 27 floors 2004 :d, 
  it 's a polish cv90120-t http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pl-01, 
  found an article about the forced sterilization . 
  http://yle.fi/uutiset/transgender_man_wants_end_to_forced_sterilisation/6663467 so basically in order to legally change gender ( name , id etc ) they must be sterile and possibly had the sex change surgery ( not sure about that one ) . 
  not my picture but i would imagine that if you could place your capital wherever you wanted why not place it somewhere with nice weather and beaches and shit . 
  just consider yourself a part of sweden ( again ) and thus a part of scandinavia . 
  crusaders king 2, 
  :p silly northern germans . 
  you would n't like it here anyway . 
  you would get height vertigo in 99 % of the region . 
  [ scandinavia !, 
  be careful or we 'll [ melt the ice caps ] ( http://i.imgur.com/v4tqfbu.jpg ) or something . 
  nah , imo we should build a new capital . 
  for some reason i keep forgetting about kaliningrad oblast and got really confused by that red little baltic state . 
   i thought sweden and denmark are the two countries on earth that have had the most conflicts in between them ? 
  it 's either us or england + france i 've heard that we gold the record as long as you count the 100 year war as a single war . 
  it 's also a bit tricky since we do n't even really know how old sweden is ( iirc , we 're the only existing country without a known founding date ) . 
  / u/vonadler estimates somewhere between 15-21 wars between sweden and denmark in [ this post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/1emc97/is_it_true_that_sweden_and_denmark_is_the_two/ca1sjf6 ), 
  i 'm not saying they should n't fight the rebels . 
  but airstrikes against targets in civilian areas is how you risk ending up like syria . 
   the question is if they can keep it up . 
  the rebels can only last if they have support by a foreign actor , which would have to be russia . 
  well if the government `` goes full assad '' and incidents like the airstrike yesterday keep happening i would imagine that more people will join the rebels . 
   the left and right scale is a ridiculous over simplification thank you !, 
  there are so many `` scales '' in politics and the left/right thing is kinda bothering me . 
  first we could have left/right in the economical sense . 
  how much power the government has over the economy . 
  taxes , welfare etc etc then a scale about how much power the government has over its citizens . 
  sexuality , religion , entertainment and so on . 
  then we can come up with more scales , like one about the enviroment ( tony abbot in one end , most green parties in the other ) . 
  [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/political_spectrum#other_proposed_dimensions ) are some more examples from wikipedia . 
  unfortunately a n-dimensional ( where n  2 ) scale is kinda hard to work with ( and print in newspapers ) so usually we end up with the basic 1 or 2 dimensional crap . 
  the violent groups of the far left and far right are probably extremely different in most regards except the `` political violence '' scale . 
  it would almost be worth losing stockholm ( and the rest of our coastal towns ) just to see denmark disappear . 
  anyone know the fastest way to melt all the ice caps ? 
  gdp ( ppp ) $ billion from wikipedia . 
  germany : 3232,6 france : 2278,0 russia : 2556,2 germany + france = 5510,6 5510,6 / 2556,2 = 2,15, 
  as long as we 're not talking nuclear war , france + germany should win against russia , without any allies on both sides . 
  they have basically the same population and even though the russian military has more active personell and a bigger budget , this can quickly change . 
  together , france and germany has over double the gdp of russia . 
  also , france has 4 aircraft-carriers and russia has 1 . 
  scandinavia is more about culture and language . 
  denmark is n't a part of the peninsula ( anymore  :d ) but it 's still scandinavian . 
  the nordic countires are denmark , finland , iceland , norway and sweden but that 's simply geography . 
  personally i do n't really identify myself as nordic more than i do as a european . 
  you 're the southern orkney islands . 
  give back western sweden !, 
  shutup northern germany !, 
  give back eastern sweden !, 
  well then they could spend more money per soldier . 
  quality over quantity . 
  well an intact statue would be preferable but the upper half or maybe just a head would be enough . 
  is waste of precious resources comrade . 
  true socialists find happiness in equality , red or yellow stars and alcohol . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stop_sign  the convention allows for the word `` stop '' to be in either english or the national language of the particular country . 
  why would n't they speak swedish in eastern sweden ? 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/s%c3%a1pmi_%28area%29#demography the sami is a minority group even in `` their own '' territory , so even though the sami live in northern norway , northern norway is n't really sami . 
  ok , that makes a lot more sense . 
  i think [ carl gustaf von rosen ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carl_gustaf_von_rosen ) deserves an honorable mention . 
  while he never accomplished as much as those you mentioned , i think he could be concidered a hero . 
  well i guess they mean `` not having to pay taxes = there 's no government = anarchy '' and that taxes are preferable to anarchy . 
  well the north/south/west / east division of europe does n't make that much sense . 
  just look at [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/europe_subregion_map_un_geoschme.svg ) map . 
  ( blue = north , cyan = west , green = south and red = east ) the uk is way further west than germany and like half of germany is above the southern end of the uk . 
  and portugal is like the westernmost country in europe . 
  [ yeeeeaaah ... no ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stockholm_bloodbath ), 
  ofc it was , everything has been conquered somehow by someone at some point . 
  and you do n't really occupy a place for 7 centuries . 
  well finland used to be a part of sweden . 
  it was n't some occupied territory or something , it was simply the eastern 1/3rd of sweden . 
  mostly joking . 
  personally i would prefer reunifying the swedish empire , taking back our old colonies , teaching eastern sweden how to speak properly , getting our hands on all that oil , defeating the p\u00f8lsetroll and messing around in germany . 
  i think greece and turkey should join together and reunify the eastern roman empire . 
  i think the goat burning down is a tradition and that it 's like 75 % of the reason it 's built at all nowdays , but it would n't be any fun if they did n't even try to protect it . 
  i guess that 's because media is probably less biased about stuff that does n't really concern their own country . 
  except ( afaik ) that 's not really assimilation , it 's a `` melting pot '' . 
  i wonder how much it would cost to make camps like this for the other 9/10ths and if it would be worth it for the eu to more or less finance it . 
  use them to create a foreign legion ( the auxilia ) and recreate/reconquer the eastern roman empire . 
  maybe it 's a shitty [ evil dead ] ( http://www.blastr.com/sites/blastr/files/styles/width_1280/public/images/evildeadchainsawarm.jpeg?itok=3_aolgvd ) costume for halloween . 
  apparently it 's much much easier to get your hands on grenades here in sweden than assault rifles ( or guns in general except hunting rifles ) . 
   i 'm not trying to say they 're all evil greedy people . 
  never said you did , it 's mostly directed to some of the people here on / r/europe think that way . 
  yeah i totally agree with that . 
  i do n't actually think that economic immigrants should get asylum in their country of choice ( or even asylum at all ) , i 'm just arguing that they 're not all `` evil greedy people who want to steal our welfare and/or jobs '' just because they did n't settle down in the first safe country they got to . 
  well how is it then ? 
  i honestly do n't really know how the situation is in greece except that the unemployment rate is really high and that they receive a ton of refugees/immigrants . 
  yes but from their point of view it 's probably a much better idea to take your chances and at least try the illegal way . 
  if they success they get out of greece , if they fail they 're sent back to greece and can do it the slow way . 
  300 per month was n't my figure , it 's what pushkalo used in his living cost estimate so i just went with it . 
  personally i do n't doubt that you can survive for much much less than that .
