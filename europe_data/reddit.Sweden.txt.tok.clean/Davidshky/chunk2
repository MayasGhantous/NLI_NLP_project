   and somehow those countries are good enough for people living there but not good enough for syrians and africans who escape war . 
  hardly a fair comparison . 
  for a greek , there are quite a lot of benefits to staying in greece , like already knowing the language , family and friends being there , already having somewhere to live etc etc. 
  for a refugee , staying in greece instead of trying to get to germany would be the shittier option . 
  you 're probably right about the food costs but i doubt that 's their only expense . 
  add hygiene products , clothes and possibly transportation costs ( bus fares etc ) and 1470 euro is n't that much . 
  they 're not gon na starve to death or anything but it 's hardly the fortune that some people seem to think . 
  my guess is he meant after taxes . 
  1470 euro/month for a family of 5 . 
  i mean you yourself estimate 300/m in food for one person so that 's basically just enough for food . 
  ( edit : tbh you can probably survive for much less ) also , afaik most lone asylum seekers do basically just get a bed in a common room or like share an apartment with a lot of other people . 
  who says they all plan on living on welfare for the rest of their lives ? 
  i mean if you 're a refugee and wish to get a job in the future then mmmmmaybe you do n't wan na get stuck in greece . 
  or maybe the russians have started to use ww1 submarines again to confuse us . 
  does the aid to finland during the winter war , helping out allied intelligence , selling ball bearings to britain despite the blockade and training norwegian troops in secret not count ? 
   the first article had 21.000 shares on facebook which one ? 
  the svt.se article has 4700 shares and i do n't see that any other article has many shares at all . 
   the last link is an example of a comment section ofc they 'll whine about something like that on exponerat . 
  all they do there is whine and complain about brown people . 
  maybe something like [ this ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2010/sep/26/plaster-matches-brown-skin ) ? 
  just because it 's covered by the media does n't mean it 's a debate . 
  i 'm pretty certain most people here had n't heard/read about this at all until kristian jensen opened his mouth ( and ironically apparently made denmark a country where you debate stuff like the color of plasters ) . 
   god paints a golden cross to the finnish sky and swedes steal it . 
  it was obviously a divine waypoint for christian crusaders . 
   afaik the colors do n't have any specific meaning . 
  i 'm 99 % sure the colors are for r\u00f8dgr\u00f8d med fl\u00f8de . 
  only about tea and imperialism afaik . 
  i kinda like to pretend that russia = mordor and yet this list is kinda accurate ( except maybe for no 4 ) . 
  what are you taking about ? 
  they map clearly states that estonia likes to make fun of eastern sweden . 
  yeah , judging by what i read about malm\u00f6 on the internet it sounds like the [ ghetto in children of men ] ( https://vimeo.com/92383943 ) . 
  we are , in fact we 're basically in a `` construction-boom '' atm but it takes time and the housing problem is pretty big so it will still take a while to build enough apartments unless we do another [ `` million programme '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/million_programme ), 
  the word hen is basically a neutral option for when the gender is unknown , irrelevant or secret . 
  in this case they 're rewriting some legal texts in which case gender should be irrelevant . 
  tbh that is kinda the point with the word hen . 
  do n't worry , this time we 'll teach them how to talk properly . 
  either norway for dat oil or finland to restore most of good old [ sweden proper ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sweden_proper ) . 
  yes it is !, 
  this would have been waaaaaaaaay easier if they were still yugoslavia . 
  balkans ? 
  or the second ... 
  first of all , nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, 
  secondly , whats up with norways and estonias negative trends ? 
  norway . 
  not only is it pretty similar to sweden in terms of culture , language and climate but since i expect a lot of my fellow countrymen to do the same , us swedes could end up being the majority , essentially taking over norway . 
  eesti can try to annex them and then into us/nato occupation . 
  yeah but iceland does n't have a military , only a small coast guard . 
  edit : also , the meeting was actually at f21 in lule\u00e5 . 
  tbh it 's probably hard for iceland to send their chod to a meeting like this . 
  the swedish and danish chods are apparently both from the army . 
  according to wikipedia we have 31,6 guns per 100 citizens so not quite enough to equip half of us but most likely enough to give everyone the age 18-40 a rifle . 
  ofc not everyone would be willing to fight but probably enough to make sweden a very unpleasant vacation spot for russian soldiers . 
  i think this is basically our military 's current plan as well . 
  imo our hunters might be a bigger deterrent than our armed forces . 
  not that they could stop an invasion but they could possibly make an occupation kinda uncomfortable . 
  this reminds me that maybe i should continue reading the [ 1632 book series . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1632_series )  the series is set in 17th-century europe , in which the small fictional town of grantville , west virginia , in the year 2000 was sent to the past in central germany in the year 1631 , during the thirty years ' war . 
  more like deir ez-zor . 
  i 'm pretty sure that 's satan claus but tbh its easy to get them confused . 
  there 's no way santa lives in finland , he 's supposed to be happy , jolly and nice . 
  [ original reddit post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/prorevenge/comments/1w0sav/6th_grade_girl_bullies_get_destroyed/cexnfsr?context=3 ), 
  i prefer [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aprqomtw-wo ), 
  maybe it 's time to recreate the eastern roman empire ? 
  indeed , just look at [ this list ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_armed_groups_in_the_syrian_civil_war ) these factions seem to reproduce by budding or something . 
  and just check the ideologies of the `` syrian government and allies '' groups . 
  i doubt they would get along very well if they did n't have a bunch of common enemies . 
  in some of the other threads about this people mentioned that normal mace is legal in denmark , so i guess that 's a legal alternative in more countries . 
  first time i 've seen crosswalks with different colored cobblestone . 
  i ca n't find the source but i remember reading that they did n't really force people to work at the concentration/extermination camps . 
  i mean they even had a [ special division of the ss ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ss-totenkopfverb%c3%a4nde ) to deal with that stuff . 
  iirc they could simply ask to be transferred somewhere else if they wanted to without getting punished or even shamed for it . 
  pretty much the same here in sweden except the limit is 240 $ for prescription drugs and 120 $ for basic doctors ( and nurses , psychiatrists etc etc ) visits . 
  probably the [ vasa museum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vasa_museum ) in stockholm . 
   what ? 
  why ? 
  what 's the reasoning behind it ? 
  and do you have a source ? 
  old laws made back when europe was n't as friendly to lgbt people i guess . 
  and here 's a source . 
   i would assume anyone can get sex change surgery on their own expense whenever . 
  unless you go to thailand or something . 
   i guess the requirement you are talking about is for the public healthcare to pay for the operation . 
  nah i 'm talking about the legal stuff like getting a new social security number . 
  as in changing their legal sex , not legally having a sex change . 
  the law that i think they 're referring to was actually a different law that required transgender people to be sterile and have any frozen sperm/eggs destroyed not only if they wanted a sex change but also if they wanted a `` legal sex change '' ( changing the gender marker on their passports , driver licenses etc and their social security number ) , which was kinda bullshit . 
  sadly it 's apparently a pretty common requirement here in europe . 
  anti-facist action here in sweden tend to appear in the news once in a while for attacking some right-wingers so it does exist here in the west . 
  nah , we 're keeping those because the border would look really stupid otherwise . 
  until they decide to recreate the eastern roman empire and start anschlussing countries . 
  we were the same country for like 7 centuries until the evil ruskies stole them from us . 
  finland is our lost brother to the east and denmark is our arch nemesis ( though they kinda share that place with russia ) . 
  from wikipedia  the order of the seraphim is only awarded to foreign heads of state and members of the royal family and they have given it to [ a lot of people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_current_knights_of_the_royal_order_of_the_seraphim ) the order of the polar star on the other hand is an reward for `` services to sweden '' so it kinda means you 've actually done something . 
  i misread it as `` italian police took elderly couples pasta '' and got really confused about what kind of strange punishments they had in italy . 
  well then the [ vasa museum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vasa_museum ) is a must ( imo it is for anyone who visits stockholm ) . 
  maybe they suffer from some sort of [ insular dwarfism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/insular_dwarfism ) . 
  yes , [ here 's a video from last week . 
  how could you forget the [ v\u00e4stg\u00f6taspets / swedish vallhund ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/v%c3%a4stg%c3%b6taspets_hane_5_%c3%a5r.jpg ) ? 
  the t is there because they 've faced similar problems from usually the same sources and have been working together for a long time ( for example the [ stonewall riots ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stonewall_riots ) ) . 
   the causes , and not the symptoms of gender dysphoria should be treated . 
  when they actually discover a cure , then sure .
