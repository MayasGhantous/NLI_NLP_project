  the `` gruntiest '' of these jobs i can think of is scaffolding construction ( certification required ) but on this end the right connections might be even more important . 
  in short : you would need more than a bit of luck . 
  internally : yes , we have somewhat of a free market . 
  except for regulations on everything ... externally it 's a different thing . 
  personally i believe suppression of imports might help a bit as a short-sight transition if your country/region suffers economically from cheaper imports . 
  or if they want to keep their internal production in case of war , meltdown of the global economy or what ever they fear lie in the future . 
  that 's a different thing though and if the globalists actually believed in their own words this would n't be needed . 
  however , in the longer run ( if we are actually trying to reach a globalized world ) we need to open those borders to the free market . 
  protectionism can only give us a bit of extra time to adjust our internal markets to the cheaper imports . 
  `` protecting your interests '' so much for a global free market ... edit : i am under no impression that the eu was ever for a globalized free market . 
  eu is , as can be seen , highly protectionistic and was never intended otherwise , as opposed to what the general consensus of / r/europe seem to be ... 
   that 's something i disagree on . 
  that used to be the law / socially acceptable , and the end result was that lots of classes of people had poor quality of life . 
  it has never been tried in a modern society . 
  we have to remember that information , knowledge and technological advancement is what made our relatively gender equal society possible , not the other way around . 
   so what happens if no-one has opened a shop in that area , or there are n't enough women to support a shop there ? 
  our hypothetical woman now has no-where to buy food . 
  what then ? 
  do we mandate that if there are only `` men-only '' shops within an area that that 's illegal ? 
  do we mandate that `` men only '' shops are only legal if there are enough shops that a woman can go to ? 
  what 's the suggestion ? 
  she would be free to move wherever she wants . 
  the government should never guarantee perfect living conditions wherever you want to live . 
  in fact the government should n't guarantee perfect living conditions anywhere . 
  first of all : excuse me for crashing in on your discussion . 
   ok , do you think businesses should be allowed discriminate based on race/ethnicity or religion ? 
  why is it ok for a company to turn away women from a shop as a customer , but not ok for the company to turn them down from a job application ? 
  the private sector should be able to discriminate however they want and to whatever degree they want . 
  same goes for you in your private life . 
   what if ( say ) you 're a woman and all the shops nearby have a `` no women '' rule ? 
  eating is * not * optional , so should it be legal to essentially , de facto have it really hard to get for women ? 
  sounds like really good business to open a store , welcoming both genders , in that area ... ;-), 
  yep , because language barriers are the only thing that sets people apart ... / s, 
   * ethnic groups in europe *, 
  the map does however ** claim ** to show ethnicity . 
  which it , like you said , does n't actually do . 
  when poe 's law goes full circle ... 
  the map shows incorrect numbers for sweden according to the source , real number was 83 % . 
  also it 's an old and outdated source from 2006 and an updated count from 2014 is at 78,5 % . 
  also , these numbers does not in any way show ethnicity . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.statistikdatabasen.scb.se/pxweb/sv/ssd/start__be__be0101__be0101q/utlsvbakgtotnk/table/tableviewlayout1/?rxid=a09b5689-e578-4132-a598-43088d5a7880 ), 
  greece has nothing to recover to . 
  they have been a parasite on the productive eu-members constantly for the 34 years it has been since they joined . 
  they ** lied ** to be able to join the euro and have never even been close to follow the minimum demands . 
  their status as a western society is built with brick upon brick of corruption , loans and trickery . 
  i see no reason as to why another bag of cash would be any different this time . 
   that was n't my point . 
  i ca n't really see how a proposal to split the euro would ever look like that . 
  the euro is a socialist experiment doomed to fail , remove it altogether . 
  when i say union i mean union . 
  not centralization of power , not monetary monopoly and not federation . 
  union as in utilizing each other for trade and freedom of movement . 
   have you seen how few the eurozone purple areas are ? 
  germany minus bavaria and a big chunk of the ruhr , plus the northern half of the netherlands , finland , estonia and most of latvia . 
  and that 's it . 
  hence the use of the word `` roughly '' , and i 'm still not talking about the euro . 
  though when we are on the subject the best way to end the euro-era might be not to force the unproductive members out but instead for the productive countries to willingly take the step outside . 
  edit : and i really do n't see a problem with the purple area being small . 
  an even smaller , scandinavian , union would be just fine . 
  yes . 
  i 'd much rather be a part of a culturally coherent union and the colored fields of this map roughly represents decent potential borders . 
  i find it amusing that people striving for centralized power are so often surprised by how it is abused . 
  the answer is less centralization , not more . 
  in a stable and thriving western country there was less need for the police . 
  tell me again how immigration from low trust societies is not the issue at hand ... 
  it 's really just pick one ... 
  dude , i 'm not a follower of the holy saint mises and neither am i a rothbardian . 
  i 'm as realist as they come , watch the clip i linked if you 're interested . 
  different cultures leads to different outcomes . 
  i 'm not trying to save the world here . 
  behavior is ruled by lot 's of factors and different incentives leads to different behavior . 
  less government regulation and lower taxes will , within a culture that does not strive for authoritarian rule , always bring us closer to a free market . 
  culture and behavior plays a huge role in this . 
  i 'd recommend this lecture by [ peter t. leeson ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ez5-gqi5bbq ) . 
  i recommend it not because i praise him as an all knowing god but because this lecture touches a wide variety of thoughts on what makes a society . 
  well , less government , taxes and state intervention would be in the right direction so let 's begin there . 
  women work in tax funded jobs to a higher degree . 
  give me a choice ( free market ) for all the products and services i use and i 'll promise you that people will be payed exactly what ~ ~ their labor is worth ~ ~ they are worth to their employer . 
  what we have now is skewed in so many dimensions . 
   everything held secret this is one of the reasons eu needs to die . 
  if it 's even a tiny bit like sweden they 're fucked . 
  the only requirement to become a citizen here is stay in the country , legally or not . 
  yes , i know the statement is about solar panels . 
  the problem is that the news article seem to be mixing solar and renewables in a really strange way . 
  solar power is not an end in itself but one of many ways to produce electric power , it is not in anyway a universal solution . 
  in fact it is still not even close to environmentally friendly in many places ( like the scandinavian countries ) compared to other renewables , nuclear or even fossil gas . 
   ** scandinavia ** , eastern europe , the netherlands and the uk , by contrast , are all lagging behind . 
  a very peculiar statement . 
  what are they talking about here ? 
  renewables or solar ? 
  considering sweden already produces well over half of its electricity from renewable sources and norway is at over 96 % renewables i really ca n't see how that statement can be made . 
  denmark is mostly using coal and natural ( sic ) gas but with an ever growing output of wind power . 
  as for finland it 's pretty much the same as in sweden , a mix of hydro and nuclear , though nuclear is a greater part of the mix there . 
  the scandinavian countries are among the best in the world at producing electricity with minimal greenhouse gas emissions so why should we adopt solar when it clearly is a worse alternative to the power plants we are currently using ? 
  edit : source - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_electricity_production_from_renewable_sources edit2 :  `` on a sunny and windy day in the summer at lunchtime [ when demand is low ] , in theory we can have 80 to 90 percent of electricity coming from solar and wind , '' sven teske , renewable energy director at greenpeace international , told euobserver . 
  energy production on a sunny and windy day does n't really help us the winter with -30 \u00b0 c and no wind ... 
  well ... if we look at the inmates in swedish prisons we can see that 28 % of them are not even citizens . 
  as for the other 72 % all we know is that they are citizens because of laws stopping the swedish prison and probation service from releasing any information about ethnic origin about the inmates . 
  ~ ~ however the 28 % alone means an over-representation of 2 times considering 14 % of the people living in sweden are immigrants . ~ ~ ( ok , that was some extremely faulty use of statistics by me . 
  many of the non-swedish inmates might not even live in sweden .
