depressing image , really . 
  yep ... :'(, 
  i honestly ca n't remember the idiocy ... 
  since my comment i 've done some more checking and while you may only see 2 incidents per year ( notice that i mentioned that the list is far from complete ) here 's a lot more going on than this . 
  in 2010 for example , according to [ effis ] ( http://forest.jrc.ec.europa.eu/effis/ ) and only counting fires larger than 100ha added to the total ( if you include smaller fires it becomes much more ) . 
  * portugal lost 101,808 ha * spain lost 23,121 ha * italy lost 16,832 ha * france lost 4,989 ha * greece lost 7,077 ha * and bulgaria lost 5,039 ha and many others , but these are the largest for just one year . 
  according to [ this ] ( http://www.alternativainvesteringar.se/docs/brochure_realfond_skog-engweb.pdf ) ( page 3 ) i 'm going to roughly estimate that the average price in europe for forest land is 10 euro/m ^ ^ 2 or 10 million euro per km ^ ^ 2 . 
  the total from my previous count is 158,866 ha , which is 1588km ^ ^ 2 which would translate into 15 billion euro . 
  disclaimer : i tried to do the math but it is late so i have no idea how correct i am , good night !, 
  oh , would you look at that !, 
  i think they need to be a bit better and maybe have their own resources and not just rely on the solidarity of others to help . 
  also , they should really update their website !, 
  the age of eternal peace : * spends 48 billion on military . 
  * spends 42 billion on healthcare . 
  i think it does . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_wildfires#europe ( note that this list is most likely far from complete ), 
  the `` united states of europe '' ? 
  have you been talking too much with americans ? 
  what 's wrong about the european union , or the european federation ( after ww2 there was a major political split between union - federation and union won ) . 
  and what the hell do you mean about getting rid of all the other nations !!?? 
  you are american are n't you ? 
  yeah , but how about all 28 nations helping out by default if its needed . 
  there should be a political institution and protocol for this because today there 's too much diplomacy that takes time and firefighting does n't have time to give . 
  yes , i meant only for airborne water bombing . 
  ground forces would take too long . 
  there are many european countries that have a lot of forest , makes better sense to share the resources because fires like this do n't happen every year in each nation but in the eu as a whole they are more regular . 
  also the combined resources could fund many more planes to be sent at the same time , making it much more effective . 
  and if any swedish agency should have firefighting capabilities it should n't be the armed forces , hear me out here , it should be the fire departments . 
  we should have a european fire fighting force that can be deployed when needed . 
  yeah , i was just talking about how much american culture has influenced the world the other day . 
  suddenly everybody thinks that ** they ** are going to be the ones who make it and that all others can just suck it because they did n't try hard enough . 
  show me the evidence . 
  yes , agreed !, 
   seriously though , i do n't know what people are on about , it 's regular old sweden whenever i 'm there . 
  actually it 's not regular old sweden for the swedes , but most do n't understand the reasons for why its this way and many blame it on immigrants . 
  we 've had a right-wing government for the past 8 years and they 've dismantled much of our social security and opportunities that the government previously gave us . 
  this makes the vulnerable ( and often stupid ) people wanting to cast blame and many have fallen for the myth that its all the immigrant 's fault when in fact this effects our economy in a negligible way . 
  but they use bad math and misleading statistics to convince people that what they say is true ( much like the anti-vaxxers in the us ) . 
  combine this with the fact that the first thing our right-wing government did was to dismantle the school system and make people dumber ( in 8 years sweden has fallen from about 10th place to about 30th in international comparisons ) and you have a very good basis for hate . 
  many of the voter today do n't even know how it used to be once ... oh well , it 's going to change in september when its election time ... 
  but that still wont help because our system is outdated ( just like all other `` democratic '' systems ) and will soon fail either way . 
  they all rely on jobs when quite soon there will be very few left at all ... 
  sorry for the rant . 
  yup ... :'( it 's mostly that way on the internet i 've found . 
  people make economic arguments about humanitarian efforts that they do n't give a shit about . 
  all they want is for others to either get a job ( and there are n't any ) or just fucking die off so that they can pay less taxes and have a new kitchen installed in their house . 
  most of the really emphatic people are out there doing humanitarian work and do n't have time to go to reddit and debate this shit . 
  and therefore we 're almost always outnumbered when it comes to these questions about everybody being equal and such , which the other 's do n't think because only * their * people are equal to them ... gaaahhhh !, 
  well , i 'm not saying that you should do it all by yourself or all at once . 
  baby steps my friend . 
  for example , on the next blueprint you write you could use as much metric as possible with nuts and bolts . 
  that would in turn make factories make less imperial and more metric . 
  one piece of legislation that would impact greatly is just changing the road signs from mph to kmh . 
  this would in turn make car manufacturers put kmh on the dashboard instead . 
  leading to people measuring distance in meters by default . 
  going back is trickier , but things become obsolete with time and are discarded , so it 's a natural phase out . 
  as long as there 's a new default system in place to replace it . 
  now , i know that the video i shared is n't by the most charismatic speaker . 
  but i really advice watching it as you 'll get a very good summary of what other nations have done to switch and how they did it . 
  what the problems of not using the * le syst\u00e8me international d'unit\u00e9s * are and so on . 
  edit : also , if it was mandated by the top down it would `` fuck '' with everyone equally so you would n't be at any disadvantage . 
  trying to influence a nation to adopt the best system of measurement humans have is n't a wrong . 
  also , your nation `` wants '' to adopt metric so you should welcome voluntary work from the outside in helping you with this . 
  um , look who 's talking ... america !, 
   you 'd think that 96 % of the planet would n't be so held back by the 4 % . 
  why do n't you just carry on without us ? 
  because you 've already done great stuff , just needs a tweak . 
  i really , really do !, 
  the world needs a unified system of measurement and the us is the big one holding it back . 
  not only would it ease things like education for the world ( just look at khanacademy for example that teaches math to the world but uses imperial units ) but it would be cost and time saving for everybody if the last 4 % of of the global population tagged along and used the measurement on which the imperial is defined . 
  also , the mars orbiter would n't have crashed if it was n't for imperial units and the list goes on . 
  it 's really hindering progress . 
  then you will continue to lag behind on science and economics . 
  if you 'll watch the video then you 'll understand that that is the only way of doing it or it wont happen . 
  alright , fair enough . 
  [ here 's why using both is the worst thing you can do ( google talk ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngtssm7vn0m ), 
  tell me . 
  how many products in your vicinity do you buy in kilograms or ( milli ) meters ? 
  what system of measurement is your car using for speed ? 
  when you buy fruit or stuff , is it by the kilo ? 
  when you buy nails , are they in millimeters ? 
  do you give your height in centimeters when giving it to others in your country , or your weight in kilos ? 
  how many kilometers is it to your closest town ? 
  what does your signs say ? 
  getting my point ? 
  oh , i understand the metric in the us . 
  i hang a lot at / r/metric, 
  well ... 
  language and systems of measurements are hardly the same . 
  also , i bet you did n't know that the us `` has been trying '' to introduce metric as the standard since 1875 . http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/metrication_in_the_united_states#history, 
  i get that . 
  but there 's a difference between understanding it and using it as a default system . 
   i weighed almost 140 kilos you , american sir/mam , are using metric and deserve [ this ] ( http://i.minus.com/ib1wsmipzdiydk.gif ) !, 
  half swede , half austrian here . 
  can confirm . 
  have never been able to understand my grandparents on my fathers side as the speak austrian with an austrian dialect . 
  on a side note , i 've always found it annoying that the english language does n't have a word to differentiate which grandparents you 're talking about like the swedish language has . 
  in swedish : mor ( mamma ) = mother far ( pappa ) = father mormor = mother 's mother morfar = mother 's father farmor = father 's mother farfar = father 's father really easy !, 
  i think it 's both actually . 
  i know quite a lot of `` old '' people who ** ca n't ** * speak * english .
