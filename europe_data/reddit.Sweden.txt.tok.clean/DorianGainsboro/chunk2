  but then again , i used to work with the elderly and i 've always hung out with seniors for fun so i may know more of them than you do ... 
  yes , `` i am also a butterfly '' ... : /, 
  [ cognitive advantages of bilingualism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cognitive_advantages_to_bilingualism ), 
  good point !, 
  you must mean britain and france yes . 
  you 're a part of the eu , right ? 
  how many nuclear nations do you think we need to deter anyone from invading ? 
  no , we should all step * down * our `` game '' . 
  we already have enough womd to deter anyone from invading us , do n't need tanks and bombers , just the good old mutual assured destruction . 
  which the eu is fully capable of handling ourselves . 
  we do n't need and should ' t be in an arms race just because they are still stuck in their cold war mentality and put us in the middle . 
  why would i go along with a false dilemma ? 
  get the fuck out !, 
  do n't want the us here , do n't want russia here . 
  historically where one goes the other will try to follow , so just get the fuck away from my continent !, 
  yes ... 
  i know ** exactly ** how you felt about that !, 
  i 've always thought that that would be a smart solution , but this is the first that i hear about a live example !, 
  actually , i won !, 
  keep reading !, 
  that sounds very good . 
  i 'm glad that we 've reached a consensus . 
  i 'm sorry for going apeshit on you ... 
  do n't confuse him !, 
  that 's because i 'm really upset with your lack of knowledge of basic math and you 're arguing against someone who is trying to teach you a thing or two ... you even ask how the calculations for average speed is done , shit i learned that in 4th grade . 
  it makes me sad and frustrated that you can not comprehend this . 
  oh my fucking god !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, 
  did n't you learn how to calculate average speeds in grade school !????? 
  yes !!!, 
  it 's not very hard !, 
  what you 're talking about is not the average but the median !, 
  this is where our dispute is . 
  so the ** average ** of a series of numbers is simply the numbers added and then divided by the amount of numbers . 
  example : 1 +3 +5 +5 +5 +5 +5 +7 +9 +100 = 145/10 = 14.5 while the ** median ** ( which is ** not the same thing as the average ** ) is simply the middle number . 
  example : 1 +3 +5 +5 +5 +5 +5 +7 +9 +100 ** ~ ~ 1 +3 +5 +5 ~ ~ ** +5 +5 + ** ~ ~ 5 +7 +9 +100 ~ ~ ** in the case of even numbers you take the ** average ** of the two in the middle , in this case it 's still 5 . 
  so , you see , in my example the ** average ** is 14.5 but the ** median ** is 5 . 
  and all from the same number series . 
  no , that was my own calculation based on the distance and estimated time , very easy to calculate . 
   i already did i may understand where we have a communication problem now !, 
  you seem to be talking about the ** ~ ~ mean ~ ~ ** ** median ** and not ** average ** , amirite ? 
  i thought that was pretty clear too ... : / apparently what is clear to some is n't to others . 
  no , i 'm asking if that 's how you calculate it . 
  here 's a random calculation for you from google maps ( without traffic ) . 
  from : t\u00fcri , j\u00e4rva county , estonia to : rakvere , l\u00e4\u00e4ne-virumaa , estonia distance : 90,1 km estimated time : 1 h 26 min average traveling speed : 62.9 km/h [ source ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/dir/t%c3%bcri/rakvere,+l%c3%a4%c3%a4ne-virumaa,+estland/@58.6560924,26.0032298,8z/data=!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x469333558c6d1831:0x400b36d18fc6610!2m2!1d25.428707!2d58.807924!1m5!1m1!1s0x469375d2d183e92b:0x400b36d18fc6760!2m2!1d26.3625304!2d59.3479604 ) ** edit : ** i feel the need to do an eli5 on this because clearly / u/draakon0 does n't get it !, 
  if the distance is 90km and the time it takes is an hour ** and a half ** then clearly you ca n't be travelling at 90km per hour !, 
  because then you would be travelling 90km in ** one hour ** !, 
  you and me have a communication problem ... : /, 
  so your counting the average like : 70 +90 +110 = 270/3 = 90km/h ? 
  so the average in germany is still unlimited then ? 
   every other road has maximum speed of 90 km/h , which is the average as well . 
  that 's not what wikipedia says ... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/speed_limits_by_country, 
  in sweden we have ( km/h ) : 30 , 40 , 50 , 60 , 70 , 80 , 90 , 100 , 110 , 120 . 
  all depending on where you are ( and in some cases the circumstances of the road ) . 
  if i want to take the car to the shop which is about 3km from here i will first drive about 400m at 30km/h then 2km at 50km/h and another 600m at 40km/h ... now , multiply this with all roads in just my nation and the lack of open , easily accessible data on this and it makes for a huge calculation problem . 
  would you care to give the average of your country ? 
  yes , they also engage in `` kangaroo driving '' due to all the speed cameras ... 
  the * average * would be pretty low would n't it ? 
  also ** really ** hard to calculate . 
  thank you for answering my question and stating your nationality ... : / so , in your european nation does this happen a lot ? 
  are you turning this into a debate about immigrants in sweden ? 
  let 's not do that , let 's either return to the original question or stop this debate . 
  because i do n't think that you 're qualified to speak about our immigration `` issues '' and you seem to have a bias against them . 
  you are a great person for putting in the effort !, 
  `` the guys who were hit were actually police themselves , in plainclothes . 
  now they press charges against their colleagues . '', 
  also , that french video was pretty great !, 
  shooting a man in the leg to save his life !, 
  i 've seen the norwegian one , also hilarious !, 
  and thanks a ton for the sources , i 'm skimming through them now but i 'm much to tired to go sleep . 
  at least i know what i 'm doing tomorrow !, 
  edit : `` but i 'm much to tired to go sleep . '', 
  this is what happens when you do n't sleep enough !, 
  ah , it would be up to germany to make the first fully fact based comment with sources would n't it !, 
  thank you !!!, 
  thanks !, 
  just make a post like this : remindme !, 
  0 days 12 hours `` provide source '', 
  please come back tomorrow ( before you drink again ) !, 
  how come you changed the topic btw ? 
  are you satisfied with the information that i have provided about swedish police 's use of lethal force ? 
  i just noticed that you went from `` that 's what the books say ... what 's it like in reality ? '', 
  concerning lethal force and then went on to talk about race riots without context ... : / also , did you know that those riots was because a man got shot by the police ( 1 of 4 last year ) ? 
   police in the uk automatically get put on 6 months paid suspension if they fire their weapon i 'm going to need a source on that . 
   i know . 
  that 's why i pointed out that i have not been to sweden , but i have been to the uk to me that 's like me saying that i have n't been to the us but i have been to canada ... / r/nocontext, 
  yes , it also depend in sweden . 
  i hope that you realize that i 'm generalizing ... our worst department is * malm\u00f6 * ( our third biggest city , bordering to denmark ) . 
  while gothenburg is much better . 
  unarmed police !? 
  but how !??? 
  ( just kidding , i lived in leixlip for 3 months so i 'm somewhat accustomed with ireland ), 
  sweden and the uk are fundamentally different places . 
  europe is n't * one place * as many americans think , it 's 50 nations . 
  there 's about as much a difference between the uk and sweden as there is between france and poland , of which i 'm hoping that you get some cultural pictures in your head . 
  [ also , burglaries in sweden are n't what you think they might be , we do n't shoot people for it , we give them `` fika '' ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/20140128/man-invites-burglar-for-coffee-after-botched-break-in ) ... 
  yes , our police force is far from perfect and i 'm the first to criticize it when talking to other swedes . 
  as all other police forces we have an outspread mentality of prejudice among police , both towards immigrants and and other minorities . 
  there 's a vast macho culture in the swedish police force ( as all other forces i suspect ) but put in relation to other nations ( mainly the us in this case ) it 's not so bad . 
  but yes , there 's a `` racist '' agenda in sweden . 
  just as in the us .
