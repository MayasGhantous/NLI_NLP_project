  -- '' ** how often do police firearms ? 
  ** * answers to common questions about police use of firearms . 
  * ** how common is it that the police use of firearms ? 
  ** it is unusual . 
  on average , shoot police for effect against a person at about 20 times per year . 
  it may be against the police makes a total of 1.3 million interventions per year . 
  for effect means that the police shooting of a person or an object , such as a vehicle to hit and stop the person or car . 
  upon further approximately 20 times a year shooting police warning shot . 
  this means that it fires the weapon to warn that it will be used . 
  a warning shot aimed in a safe direction so that no risk to meet . 
  the most common way that the police use the firearm is to only threaten it without firing shots . 
  it occurs at almost 200 times per year ** how often [ are people ] killed [ by ] one of the police ? 
  ** it is very rare that someone dies after being shot by police . 
  each such case is tragic for everyone involved and of course any police wants to avoid . 
  but the legislature has given the police the right to use firearms , and in some situations , deadly force is inevitable in order to protect others . 
  over a longer period , as the last twenty years , has averaged one person per year have died . 
  but the statistics vary over the years . 
  some years dies no other year more . 
  the highest number of deaths was four and occurred in 2013 . 
  1999 killed three people which was the second highest number . 
  during the years 1996 , 1997 , 2007 , 2008 , 2012 died no . 
  ** what does the police [ do ] to prevent shootings ? 
  ** the basis of the police are trying to solve situations by talking to the people involved as much as possible . 
  the vast majority of police interventions succeed with it . 
  also in very threatening and dangerous situations trying to police first use verbal communication to resolve conflicts , sometimes with the help of specially trained negotiators or dialogue policemen . 
  in some situations , various techniques hand grip . 
  but sometimes the threat is so serious that it requires that the police use any of the tools the police have to use force - handcuffs , baton , pepper spray or a gun . 
  firearms are the absolute last resort . 
  police have a strong focus on education and in basic training for police officers , and through its continuous updating the activities . 
  a large part is about communication , mental preparation and the ability to make quick decisions in different situations . 
  the police also practice practical to use physical techniques and the different tools . 
  ** why not shoot the police always in the leg ? 
  [ why do n't they always shoot in the leg ? 
  ] ** in some situations , the police have to shoot directly into the body to protect itself or others , such as from an attacking person at a short distance . 
  rushing around ten meters with such a knife in his hand are incredibly fast and hitting a leg can be very difficult . 
  nor is it likely that a hit in the leg immediately stop the attacker . 
  even if the firearm is a very powerful force , it is not certain that even a hit in the upper body immediately stop an attacker . '', 
  oh , i occasionally visit / r/protectandserve . 
  but to say that it 's international is highly misleading !, 
  this is a google translate from the swedish police 's website about the ** police 's right to use firearms ** it 's far from a perfect translation but it may get the message across and i will highlight the most important part . 
  -- `` if no other way out , there may be a police officer in certain circumstances use firearms . 
  police officers may shoot when they themselves or other threatened or severe violence that can cause serious injury , such as a person with a knife or firearm . 
  it 's called self-defense - police shoot to protect themselves or others . 
  most situations where the police firing for effect , then fires shots at a person , is about self-defense . 
  police officers may in some situations also use firearms to arrest a person suspected or convicted of particularly serious offenses and may be dangerous to others , for example if the person is on their way to accommodate . 
  it 's called cooking power , and demands that the police need to intervene immediately . 
  the police should , as far as it is possible to have control over the shot bar . 
  to shoot from or toward a moving vehicle , like a car or motorcycle , shall be avoided as far . 
  ** if the police shoot at a person [ they ] should seek to only temporarily incapacitate the person . 
  the shots will be primarily directed against the legs , but if circumstances warrant , the police shoot directly against the body ** - for example , if the threatening person is close in distance and attack flies . 
  the police must always take into account the risk that third parties may be damaged by gunfire . 
  the risk is particularly high when the shooting distance is long or when visibility is poor , such as in darkness , fog , backlit or rain . 
  although the risk of ricochets , that a bullet changes direction on contact with an object , should be considered . 
  when a police officer has fired a shot , either intentionally or by mistake , the police must make a report about it to the authority . 
  all cases are reviewed . 
  if there is reason to believe that an offense subject to public prosecution has been committed so headed the investigation by prosecutors . '',
