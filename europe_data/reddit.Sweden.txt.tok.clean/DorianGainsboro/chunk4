  makes you do that , but that 's over now and you do n't have to vodka like them anymore . 
  let me guess , you go straight from whatever you do in the day home and sit in front of your computer . 
  you 've ( almost ) never invited anyone over . 
  you do n't go to any kind of social gatherings ( pub , concert , political meetings or whatever ) and when it 's time for lunch you usually go sit at an empty table because you do n't feel welcome at the ones that already have people . 
  how am i dong ? 
  and if this was somewhat accurate i just pointed out what to not do fyi . 
  it 's not as if we have n't continued to progress after the first social democrats , who 's pushing the worlds feminist and environmental agenda these days for example . 
  i 'm a part of that so i contribute and do my part . 
  we 're kinda trying to get rid of it because the original writing is not about modesty but oppression . 
  this has got to be a troll . 
  you american ? 
   about wild , really wild partying means . 
  you tend to be reserved and inhibited . 
  yeah , east european girls are fucking awesome !, 
  no inhibitions whatsoever !, 
  you 're speaking to finland , he does n't count because he 's got bigger alcohol problems than the rest of us combined , therefore they 're fat . 
   pretty good enlgish skills the reason : we do n't dub !, 
  anything !, 
  germany is terrible in this way . 
  the only reason you laugh so much is because of releasing the tension of despair . 
  i 'd rather have joy than laughter any day . 
   also very well dressed . 
  haha , i worked in ireland ( leixlip ) for a summer at hp . 
  you guys just seem to step out of the bed and go to the pub , all we do is put on a pair of jeans and some t-shirt and hoodie . 
  but you basically have your night gowns on when out . 
  getting irish women is so easy , if only there were any attractive ones ... : /, 
  so , what the fuck are you !? 
  where did you spend most of your life ? 
  also , do you have friends elsewhere in the world ? 
   if it was such perfect society , why the flight of so many talented people ? 
  because people actually have the opportunity to leave ? 
  also , living on the government check in another country allows you to live as a king . 
  well , if your social code is to break it then you 're just following your code ... : /, 
  how old are you ? 
  might have something to do with that ? 
  yep . 
  there was an interesting statistic that my social sciences teacher showed me once . 
  one year we brought back the `` stark\u00f6l '' as a test in stores , you could see the bump in domestic violence that year . 
  hey , we have jantelagen as well !, 
  for the lazy : http://satwcomic.com/, 
   food was a bit lacking your food culture * is * lacking . 
  i think it 's because then we would n't have an ocean between us ... 
  i recognize this too , it 's connecting to our moonshine roots and traditions . 
  we only act this way once a year , when we sing `` little frogies '' . 
  this is how i feel when speaking to outsiders ... people are always thinking that `` this and that luck '' has made us what we are and that they 've just had bad luck and that there 's noting to do about that . 
  well , why do n't you guys listen to the pros instead !? 
  if you want what we got listen to what we have to say about how we got that . 
  this is the best answer !, 
  as long as you 're scandinavian when picking on another scandinavian country you 'll do fine , we 're just siblings having some fun mocking each other . 
  til, 
  i wish i could apologize on behalf of people , but sadly they 're not sorry for their bigotry ... : /, 
  it 's a whole series ( watch it !!, 
  ) , i posted it to / r/sweden but it got downvoted ... my bad , i did n't include a pun or mildly racist remark in the title ... : /, 
  could we have a / r/dataisbeautiful on this ? 
  they 're trying to change that with '' [ svensker er mennesker ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmrynddqipm ) '' ;-p, 
  laws effect our behavior . 
  speed limits are a good proof of that . 
  you are one weird kid ... 
  could we find a correlation between intelligence and latitude ? 
   i am not quite sure what , as most gun nuts i know are responsible with their guns . 
  i think that this is highly relative . 
  do they always ( except when driving to or from the shooting range or out hunting ) keep their guns in either a ) a +400 lbs heavy safe . 
  b ) a somewhat lighter safe that is instead bolted to the ground . 
  is this regularly ( by-yearly at random ) controlled by police by house visits ? 
  do they need to get a licence to own * any * kind of firearm ? 
  cause yeah ... that 's how it is here . 
  edit : what you consider responsible , i consider illegal for good reasons . 
  why are you so ignorant ?

  join us !, 
  children !!!, 
  could someone make a / r/dataisbeautiful of this please ? 
  what happened !, 
  this is very true , we take every opportunity to speak english , that 's also a reason why english speaking immigrants have a hard time learning swedish , they do n't get to practice . 
  when it 's turned like that i believe that it means `` stick it up your arse '' in britain . 
  it 's more offensive than the `` fuck you '' - sign in britain as i 've understood it . 
  almost no swedes know that this is rude in britain , so i highly doubt that this was anything else than an attempt at a peace sign . 
   homogenous population about 1 in 10 citizens were n't born in sweden or has parents that were n't born in sweden ... 
  i do n't know too much about other counties status on this but i do n't think we 're that homologous . 
  as far as i 've understood it this is much more true for switzerland ? 
  what the !!?? 
  story !, 
  well , there 's a lot of hate towards romanians in sweden right now , so i do n't think that he was joking actually ... and we must take every opportunity to stop this xenophobia . 
  okay , i can buy that ... 
  but it 's due to prejudice . 
  yeah , the internet is a great thing !, 
  i 'm not from stockholm and have never lived there , i grew up in rural halland so i know what i 'm talking about as i used to be one of these morons , and most of my ( former ) friends still are . 
   basically everyone in sweden has been abroad , speaks a foreign language and knows what is going on in the world . 
  nope , nope , nope !, 
  we still have a large rural population that do n't like to go anywhere and just sit in their little towns circlejerking how sweden was once a great nation and that every problem is due to immigrants , socialists and feminazis . 
  they 're our rednecks , simple as that . 
  and they 're greatly inspired by the american rednecks . 
  or , just plainly liberal compared to the us . 
  oh , you 're talking about west sweden ... 
  shut up east sweden !, 
  that 's amazing , thanks !, 
  april 1st ... 
  yes , with a population density of 21 people/km \u00b2 compared to the us 32 people/km \u00b2 there 's no way to compare the two ... / s, 
  i feel sad for you with all those stupid people ( americans ) walking all over you . 
  i 've never seen the vatican here ...
