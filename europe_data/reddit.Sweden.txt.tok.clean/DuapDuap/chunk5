  and fprces like reserve police battallion 101 who in their first eradication mission killes about 1500 people in a single day . 
  i was more talking about those directly killed by the nazis . 
  consider that 80 % of the victims were still alive in early 1942 , but at around the same time of year 1943 only 20-20 % remained . 
   the holocaust could n't have happened because zyklon b can not be real . 
  i 'll never stop loving this argument because it 's so wrong . 
  most people who were killed by the nazis where killed with guns , the gas was implemented late in the process and did n't kill all that many people compared to the final number . 
  maybe bj\u00f6rn borg should come out of retirement :@, 
  so is it gon na be like a tennis match over \u00d6resund ? 
   i feel like my comment triggered your white knight sense aw , adorable . 
  hey man as i swede i know that 's a bogus notion . 
  if there is any country that is a humanitarian superpower it 's either the un , the eu , or the us ( though they are mostly on the list because of the sheer volume of $ $ $ they contribute which is crucial mind you ) . 
  i have an extension i use to block analytics and stuff , though i doubt it 's perfect . 
  yeah , i do n't expect them to last through the next election cycle . 
  it 's a pretty common story i 'm afraid . 
  eastern european women get brought to a richer european country under some promise . 
  work , a relationship , etc. 
  instead when they arrive they 're forced into prostitution . 
  fun times !, 
  haha , that 's definitely true . 
  if romson was in charge i 'd expect parliament to devolve into literal shit-flinging . 
  i have no problem with l\u00f6fven , he has just been dealt so many bad cards . 
  it 's no surprise that things are going crazy . 
  is n't development * exactly * what we need to solve this fucking gordian knot of a problem in the long run ? 
  this is less a question of free speech , but rather about a member of the swedish government going \\ #renegadeforlife . 
  the reason she was n't supported was because the government were n't willing to back her up on something wallstr\u00f6m did on her own volition . 
  had this topic been agreed upon by our government i assume they 'd stand by her , hell or high water . 
  one of the biggest minorities in sweden are also the assyrians . 
  orthodox christians from syria who fled a time ago . 
  they even had a pretty big football club . 
  the bible says to do that as well . 
  though not so much killing christians . 
  well they 've got sort of their wish , sort of . 
  iirc many laws in denmark are based in christian belief and the bible , which bears a lot of similarities to the quran . 
  besides does n't the quran say to respect the law of the land ? 
  muslims are generally pretty chill . 
  i mean , if i had been detained in gitmo i 'd be pissed enough to do something really stupid as well . 
  i do n't know about the baby thing , but from what i 've read the women beg and the men either steel or work illegally . 
  it 's not like we actually want scania . 
  we 're just keeping it to spite them at this point . 
  both norway and denmark are so limited . 
  here in sweden we do both , and we do them better than both of you . 
  ** country : ** sweden ** favorite neighbor : ** norway . 
  ** least favorite neighbor : ** denmark, 
  yup . 
  if i understand the subject correctly , that 's basically what happened in the palestine . 
  a bunch of refugee camps eventually became simple brick neighborhoods , which eventually became a city . 
  i mean , if you smack the shit out of your kid you 'll be arrested . 
  but i do n't think they 'd take the kid based on that . 
  you will receive enlightenment some day . 
  that 's not an empire , that 's a kingdom . 
  i 'm for it . 
  if it came to a public referendum here in sweden i 'd vote yes . 
  people will certainly voice their misgivings when discussing the eu here in sweden , but judging from the people i know , i 'd say that most people view it as a net-positive . 
  there are just a fair few issues to iron out . 
  in terms of politics i think we only have one party directly opposed to the eu in parliment and the rest of the other parties are all in favor . 
  in terms of public opinion i would guess that approval of the eu has increased by quite a bit this year due to 2016 proving to be a wild fucking ride . 
  i think snus is a lot better compared to cigarrettes because there is no second hand smoke . 
  i think snus is a lot better compared to cigarrettes because there is no second hand smoke . 
  considering the amount of russian porn-sties i 've come across i do n't see how this would impact the number of porn-consumers at all . 
  yeah but belarus is like russia 's bootleg brother . 
  the [ sense of right alliance ] ( http://i67.tinypic.com/1z53zp5.jpg ) to russia 's justice league, 
  wow look at that virtue signaling !, 
  makes me glad i 've never bought anything from h&m . though that 's pretty coincidental since none of their clothes have been in my style . 
  for some reason i thought that would look cooler than it did . 
  if it goes on like this i bet that in thirty years britain leaving the eu will be one of those facts that get posted once a week on / r/todayilearned with titles like `` til great britain has been in the process of leaving the eu for 30 years '' or something like that . 
  yeah it 's disappointing . 
  if it came to a vote again i would definitely vote for us to change to euro . 
  france and germany are two of the closest allies in the eu . 
  i would be not be surprised at all to see a military alliance between the two . 
  as cool as it would be if this happened , i ca n't help but feel that it would be extremely unsafe for both the competitors and the horses . 
  basically , economists and sufficiently qualified politicians draw up the deal , and it 's a take it or leave it situation for the corporations . 
  though that 's simplifying it quite a bit and it 's only a vague idea . 
  it 's so annoying . 
  not to mention that the people that negotiated and made this deal dug their graves for themselves by being so non-transparent about the whole thing . 
  it forced people to take a hardline stance against it because it was not clear what was actually being proposed . 
  had this trade deal been a more open negotiation , without any corporations or lobbyists i think the eu could 've convinced more people to be in favor of the partnership . 
  like the fact that i oppose ttip does n't mean i oppose all similar trade deals , i just oppose those i see as a risk to our citizens . 
  this was a great read i urge anyone interested or invested in the goings on with ttip to read this . 
  though to add to the discussion i 'm personally not opposed to ( nor am i necessarily for ) a free trade deal with the us and eu and other countries in the future . 
  ** but ** such a trade deal can not be dictated or influenced by large corporations to the extent ttip was , or give them any power over sovereign nations . 
  it would also help if the negotiations where part of public record with transcripts and stuff . 
  to be completely fair circumcision is not * nearly * as bad as female gender mutilation . 
  for one there is medical merit to circumcision , it is for example used in case of severe phimosis ( when the foreskin is too tight ) . 
  fgm has no medical merits at all . 
  but all that said circumcising babies and young children is a gross violation of their bodily autonomy and should rightly be considered child abuse . 
  i would say that metric is objectively better because it goes in a straight line and you can more easily convert between area measurements , volume , weight , and so on . 
  planning your words carefully is n't being a rat . 
  it 's called being prepared . 
  still , the murder rate is higher than my entire country . 
  i just googled `` murder capital united states '' and chicago came up lol . 
  iirc sweyn did n't conquer those places `` all the way '' cnut kind of finished his father 's work . 
  karl xii was kind of a hot mess as a king . 
  sure he was good a warfare and his troops fucking loved him , but as a king he was n't that great . 
  no tact , no diplomatic ability , neglectful of the country while out at war , etc. 
  i like the design of gustavus adolphus or gustaf ii adolf as he 's called here in sweden , i like that he does n't look like he did when he was older , but rather looks like how he was when he was crowned . 
  that said , i do n't like his voice acting , it 's too modern in the tone and it sounds kind of like a salesperson . 
  on the whole i would 've preferred gustav vasa as the leader in civ 5 . 
  their own fault for letting people in boats sneak up on them . 
  like we have some troubles with sexist and homophobic subcultures in different neighborhoods around our cities , but it 's not like we have a chicago level of murders . 
  hopefully you 'll manage .
