  google translate told me it means clock ( in swedish ) . 
  i guess somewhere it went wrong with `` watch '' . 
  yup , thanks for norway btw . 
  while i agree on some southern parts having economic troubles : would you like to back up your claims ? 
  [ do n't mention the war ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfl6lu3xqw0 ) . 
  yeah , norway is not a part of the eu so they where missing from the euro coins . 
  [ an old euro ] ( http://blogs.independent.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/euro.jpg ), 
  this just reminds me they removed the penis from euro coins . 
  i have not noticed this yet . 
  imo i see quite a difference to other large subs . 
  what is the dissenting opinion ? 
  anti-eu ? 
  * edit : `` we '' can be quite racist though ... *, 
  they ca n't as far as i know . 
  immigrants have to be processed in the eu country that they arrive in . 
  they can not be `` referred '' to another country . 
  looking to sheer numbers , sure . 
  but not per capita . 
  back 1400 a third of stockholms population consisted of germans . 
  the advance in living standard in sweden in the last 100 years have little to do with immigration . 
  in my opinion it is a bit of a stretch to say that most refuges will not be able to return . 
  even tough the civilian population have been targeted , i have not heard about a certain group being especially discriminated by one side or an other . 
  it 's more about where you live etc. 
  as a disclaimer i should say that i 'm not too well read on the details . 
  if i 'm wrong please do tell . 
  oh they did , often by simply annihilating the people who practiced it . 
  they did n't in britain , sure . 
  but they did to many other countries . 
  the war nerd have written an interesting [ column ] ( http://exiledonline.com/when-pigs-fly-and-scold-brits-lecturing-sri-lanka/ ) about it . 
  it 's a bit rough though . 
  i see what you are saying . 
  but my reasoning is that there is enough theocratic influence and enough of the population practice to call these countries muslim and christian . 
  even though the church and state separated as late as 2000 here in sweden i would not have called it a christian country as the population where very secularised and christianity had all but no influence over the national politics . 
  i 'm not saying that you are wrong , you are more right that i am . 
  but it is different way to look at what constitutes a religious country . 
  and i think homsig sees it the same way as me . 
   you know damn well i 'm not talking about turkey , but about countries like iran , iraq etc. 
   this is not completely related , but iran is the country in the world that next to thailand perform the most sex change operations in the world . 
  not to say that gay people are well treated , it 's just interesting considering how we view trans people in the western world . 
  sure , the state is secular . 
  but i would call the country in itself muslim . 
  the religion do have an impact on the politics , even though their not officially a part of the state . 
  i would , for example , call the us a christian country . 
  it is great that you have friends who cycle . 
  and as i said in my other reply , uppsala and lund are the extreme outliers when it comes to cycling . 
  i 'm guessing link\u00f6ping is up there as well . 
  but do you really argue that one in five in sweden use the bicycle as their primary way of transportation ? 
  that number includes everyone , not just students and people working . 
  sure there are a lot of bikes in both citys amongst students , but they are ( afaik ) as good as it gets and are in no way representative of sweden as a whole . 
  i do n't think so tbh . 
  sweden have not had a real cycling culture in the past and because of this the infrastructure is not built for cycling . 
  of course this is changing , but i doubt we would see numbers anywhere near the netherlands or denmark . 
  combine the culture and infrastructure with a very spread out city planning in stockholm and pretty good public transport . 
  the veil is not about slavery . 
  in some cases it 's a symptom of oppression from home . 
  but it is more of a symptom than * the * problem . 
  yeah !, 
  and you do n't se them blowing up the wtc either !, 
  or maybe it would have resulted in a non-peaceful dissolution of the union before the ww2 . 
  we 're dealing with a very hypothetical situation here . 
  damn [ oscar ii ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oscar_ii_of_sweden#king_of_sweden_and_norway ) !, 
  do you have any source for af being an abbreviation for africa ? 
  anyway : i assure you that eu does not in any way stand for geographical europe . 
  as you might have noticed that would create a lot of confusion . 
  i have no idea . 
  how do you abbreviate north america ? 
  or africa ? 
  google eu and see what you get . 
  uh , no . 
  eu is an abbreviation for the european union . 
  just like the us is an abbreviation for the united states - not america . 
  just read what he wrote , he said the eu , you replied saying this is wrong . 
  of course you , should both have realized that there are different definitions of europe . 
  however , in the context of the question i would say that you asked about the eu and western europe . 
  or did you want to know about the political climate of russia and turkey as well ? 
  except for siri using the source i posted , wolfram alpha . 
  anyway using googles saved data includes turkey and a large part of russia . 
  they are certainly not a part of the eu . 
  hence , you are wrong and rilly616s quote stands . 
  google is a search engine . 
  you can find a better [ source ] ( http://m.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=total+area+europe+vs+total+area+us&amp;x=0&amp;y=0 ) here . 
  i choose to include geographical europe and not the eu . 
  otherwise the difference would have been bigger . 
  tbh , i have no idea why we are discussing how islam expanded hundreds of years ago . 
  and saying that the crusaders did not commit genocides on muslims is just ignorant . 
  they massacred [ jews ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/worms_massacre_ ( 1096 ) ) and ortodox christians as well btw . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_jerusalem_ ( 1099 ) #massacre recounts one of these massacres of muslims during the crusades, 
  are you kidding me ? 
  have you even heard about the crusades and inquisitions just to name a few ? 
  and you post a bunch of links to what seem to be biased authors and websites ? 
  put a little effort in it . 
  on my way going in to the army i sat next to a jehovas witness on the train who had been studying technical physics for 6 years . 
  but i still have no idea how many very religious people study these fields nor how many turn away from religion . 
  i 'm guessing the same way christianity did , by more or less agressive missionaries . 
  of course it dosent , but putting islam as a source of our problems today is just wrong . 
  religion is a part of the problem , sure . 
  but it is in a lot of ways more of a symptom . 
  people like to single out islam as the source of the problem , just like people singled out `` black culture '' or maybe even judaism ( with the smearing of that religion ) as the source of the problem . 
  the discussion is not about wether we should give islam a power over the state , but about the demonisation of it . 
  exactly , we did have devout christians here .
