  but we do n't anymore due to us living in social safety for the last 60 years . 
  most immigrants have not . 
  and with failed integration they continue to live in social insecurity . 
  this do of course lead to a more extreme and radical subscription to religion . 
  once again , anecdotal evidence . 
  i 'm sure there are wealthy families that are very religous . 
  ever heard about the koch brothers ? 
  but i do n't really consider a girl in your high ( ? 
  ) school a source for this . 
  the thing is that i do not believe that islam is the root of the problem , rather they have turned to religion and maybe even an extreme version of it because of the harsh backgrounds they come from . 
  and this is not something you drop quickly nor easily . 
  i 'm not saying that christianity is as harmful as islam , but it has the potential to be and certainly have been . 
  i am unfortunately not knowledgable enough to know how you solve the integration problem , but imo what plays the biggest part is where and how you place immigrants who will be staying in the country . 
  and christians `` believe '' so too !, 
  go check what the bible says about homosexuality . 
  of course an ideology can be basically flawed . 
  especially one so undeveloped as nazism where . 
  but this notion of blaming so much of the problems we have with extremists in western society today on a religion is a bad oversimplification in my opinion . 
  your opinion is extreme and generalising because you are saying that europe as a whole is taking away the rights of non-whites . 
  i am not saying that xenophobia is not on the rise . 
  this would entail the states actually passing laws against people based on their skin colour . 
  sure there have been laws passed that have directly targeting islam in a few countries . 
  but you make it seem so much more . 
  some of them would do this . 
  it 's just that they do n't have to flee from the us . 
  this thing repeats through history . 
  extremism have nothing to do with a certain religion or movement . 
  it 's mostly spawned out of insecurity which in turn is spawned out of a poor social and economical standing . 
  extremes like what we at the moment see in sweden is a result of having a marginalized group of people with a low socioeconomic standing in a society that is still in recession . 
  sure , islam because of it 's differing culture from the host country is not helping . 
  but it is not the basis for extremism . 
  we had similar problems with finns right after ww2 . 
  but we had about 30 years of great economic growth in the country , largely due to staying neutral during the war . 
  we do not have that luxury anymore . 
  mix this with the failed integration : not being able to prevent immigrants from being placed/moving in to the same area and you have the situation we have today . 
  islam is not the cause for this . 
  your evidence for islam being a harmful religion is at best anecdotal and the exact same evidence can be applied on christianity and the bible . 
  just go check / r/atheism and you will find plenty of cases with crazy christians . 
  it is just that we do not see them here in sweden . 
  not really . 
  you are being downvoted because it 's a rather extreme and most of all generalising opinion that you did not source . 
  i guess you understand now that you should explain , source etc. 
  since you know this : what formations do the chemicals in the gas actually take when it is used ? 
  as an anecdote : an unused brush helped immensely in getting the stuff out of our eyes , these where also used ( as instructed ) to brush the chemicals ( crystals ) of our clothes . 
  edit : here is a [ picture ] ( http://i.imgur.com/scptsfy.jpg ) from when we tried the gas on ourselves . 
  this was done in a closed room , so the effects are more extreme than what you see on tv . 
  from what i learned ( and experienced ) doing my military service it 's crystals that causes the burning itching and general discomfort . 
  of course it might be something different in the gas that make you dizzy and disoriented . 
  but i always figured it was the the crystals affecting the lungs . 
  edit : salvaxe is without reason in saying that i 'm wrong . 
  after first checking what kind of tear gas the swedish army use ( cs-gas ) and what the active component is ( 2-chlorobenzalmalononitrile ) it do infact appear as crystals . 
  check under `` appearance '' to the right in [ this wikipedia article ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cs_gas ) . 
  during the war in bosnia the swedish `` peacekeepers '' where actually nicknamed the lucky batalion due to being in a high number of firefights with very few injuries and no deaths . 
  the weird thing is that i actually enjoy the food in ikea quite a bit . 
  sure you do n't expect anything special , but it 's part of the ritual : going to ikea , buying stuff you never know you needed and had no plan on buying and eating plain food . 
  in what way ? 
  was the quality of the water lower ? 
  was this the case in most of the uk ? 
  yeah , it 's quite ironic !, 
  there is a common misconception that the school itself was at first a prison . 
  this was done during 60s when a [ large part of stockholm was being rebuilt ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/redevelopment_of_norrmalm ) . 
  it 's still a much discussed event and far from popular . 
  but if you compare the scale of the two buildings in this case you will quite quickly realize that the size difference is overwhelming . 
  fun fact : prior to building the school there was actually a prison located in the same spot . 
  incidentally [ not nearly as ugly ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/l%c3%a4nsf%c3%a4ngelset_%c3%96stermalm.jpg ) . 
  note the church in the back of both photos !, 
   edit : [ more pictures of the prison . 
  because the us and europe are similar , `` western culture '' . 
  i guess they where lying since [ erasmus at most cover a year abroad ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/erasmus_programme#details ) . 
  they might recieve a grant from the program , but that does afaik not at all enough to cover the living expenses . 
  they still need financial support from their home country . 
  that is not erasmus , nor is it any other exchange program if they are getting full degrees . 
  [ this blogpost ] ( http://kommissariecuriosa.blogspot.se/2005/11/swedish-mating-and-dating.html?m=1 ) describes dating in sweden somewhat well . 
  well , new weapon sales are in the making between sweden and saudi arabia . 
  tbh i 'm not sure what the contract regulated . 
  but they fighting between the countries is more about our fm speaking out against saudi arabia . 
  i kind of agree , but they are not really in a position where they can afford to do anything but follow saudi bidding . 
  oh , the selling of weapons is not stopping . 
  that ca n't entirely be blamed blamed on the current government though . 
  i do n't know , i 'm not too happy having to pay for it . 
  sucks that i have to pay for it though . 
  i remember it being quite left leaning two years back . 
  i do not visit any more . 
  edit : apparently that people moved here considering medborgare and i are getting downvoted . 
  a very polarized debate and almost unprecedented levels of immigration combined with a failed integration system will create a strong anti immigration movement , even in sweden . 
  do you have any source for this ? 
  from what i found out the colors came first , then the cross . 
  i very much doubt it is related to wheat fields . 
  you just made that up , did n't you ? 
  i 've only been to amsterdam for a week , but it was great !, 
  the only real problem i had with it was the toilets ... 
  but i guess where you notice cultural differences the most are with the people , and as you said : the cultural differences where , in general , small . 
  the city itself did however remind me more of copenhagen than stockholm . 
  no , but they will [ burn 40 000 women ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/witch_trials_in_the_early_modern_period ) for helping people give birth , curing sickness etc. 
  yes , when you buy the ticket you choose among the available seats . 
  it looks like [ this ] ( http://www.sf.se/biljetter/bokningsflodet/valj-antal-biljetter/?auditorium=31&amp;date=20120807&amp;time=1300&amp;city=se ) . 
  is that the only reason those toilets exist ? 
  that 's not normal ? 
  just a thought : afaik most police agencies require police issued with pepper spray to be sprayed once themselves . 
  i can imagine that the controlled environment and knowledge of what to do makes it quite a bit easier to deal with .
