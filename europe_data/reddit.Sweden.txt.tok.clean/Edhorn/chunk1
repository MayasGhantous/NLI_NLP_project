i think if we have a unified currency we should have a unified economical policy . 
  i think if we have a unified military we should have a unified foreign policy concerning military actions . 
  afaik the current eu battlegroups are a joke . 
  if we are going to spend money on these things then let 's do them properly is all i 'm saying . 
  / r/europe, 
  i 've not heard about magnus nilsson , so i ca n't comment on that . 
  sorry if i sounded irritated with the sami , i simply have more in common with j\u00e4mtar . 
  generally i would reckon most swedes are n't either , i ca n't even think what they would be irritated about . 
  the ' [ republic of j\u00e4mtland ] ( http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/republiken_jamtland ) ' exists as a humorous culture and marketing project . 
  i would n't hold it against somebody not including it , but personally i would rather be a part of that than the sami . 
  `` fuck these guys trying to be ` factual ' , i have anectdotes . '', 
  yes , i think my view has changed on this . 
  it 's still not nice wasting your time on someone just wanting to piss you off , a troll , but if the comment is very visible you might as well argue with the comment itself . 
  no , i do not . 
  i do think about my `` own '' people , and i am concerned about the situation . 
  i do not , however , think that any nation deserves to become a shithole , no matter what kind of people live there . 
  so you would argue with someone whose only purpose is to piss you off or spread fabricated stories ? 
  i actually think i agree with you in this case , but there are exceptions . 
  and go learn enough about european politics to realize that i 'm not a liberal . 
  going through someone 's post history = psycho sorry , * liberal * psycho , whatever that 's supposed to mean . 
  seriously , you have some sort of victim complex if you think this counts as persecution . 
  you know you are a great person when you wish for the ruin of 10 million lives just so your opinion can be confirmed . 
  so the white rabbits have donned sheep 's clothing . 
  read the last quote again , talk about preserving ` race ' , you do n't think that 's creepy at all ? 
  downvote and move on . 
  i 'm not pro-ttip but holy crap you do n't get sick from gmo crops . 
  the issue is not biological it 's ecological , the crops themselves are superior in some way to normal crops , very often more resistant to pests or pesticides . 
  the problem is the effect on the ecology when populations of the species effected by the pesticides dissappear , a problem that grows bigger when the crops accidentally grows wild and outgrows the native plantlife . 
  the reason i get hung up on this is that it is a a lot more hurtful for you to be using the wrong arguments for the right side than the right arguments for the wrong side . 
  the cia 's counter-intelligence program even advices to infect and kill of movements and forums this way . 
  where else do you see numbers seperated by spaces ? 
  also if possible the space should be smaller than a normal space , that would be my absolute ideal way . 
  it is actually my second preferred system after just a space , commas and especially periods are too ambiguous . 
   50 ' 000 confirmed swiss . 
   but as a policy , it should be designed to serve the interests of the country where the policies apply . 
  if it does n't serve those interests , it should be modified . 
  so do you think no country should take in refugees ? 
  sorry for pressing this but why then would you say islam and evolution is incompatible ? 
  by not believing the quran literally . 
  surely there exists writing in the quran which you do not believe literally ? 
  i know in the bible it says you can not eat shrimp for instance , yet most christians do because they realize that the message of the passage was something else . 
  can we get some sources in here please ? 
  not that i 'm doubting you any more than i 'm doubting the video . 
  [ \\  your face when americans call colour `` color '' ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0qfq5ai.jpg ), 
  moving to or growing up in are worlds apart . 
  the us is probably one of the best if not the best place to live if you have a high income , so if i had one moving there would definitely be an option . 
  but that does not mean i would have liked to be born or grow up there . 
  i find it interesting that your example is one of the most westernized countries in africa . 
  what an incredibly constructive response and a good addition to the discussion . 
  yeah  you too . 
  do n't sweat it , i am somewhat enjoying this argument though . 
   i do n't know why i am even arguing with you . 
  do you download intellectual property though illegal channels ? 
  yeah , i do n't think any of us will change opinions ...  if so , you are a tjief. , plain and simple . 
  if does not matter how you presenbt your argument . 
  yes , if you define theft as the unlawful taking of the property of another . 
  no , if you define theft as the dishonest taking of property belonging to another person with the intention of depriving the owner permanently of its possession or larceny . 
  also we have a fundamental disagreement here , as i have no such ultimatum . 
  and this is still just definitions , law . 
  ink on paper kinda stuff . 
  i say even theft does n't have to be immoral . 
  i guess you did n't cheer for robin hood ? 
   if you are not `` okay '' with the `` terms of service '' , you are free to not get the product . 
  you do not have a right to a product !, 
  you have the right to refer from buying it , but digital products are not a human right . 
  i did n't say i have a right to it . 
  in practice though , i pay my license to svt which svt used to buy the license for the show . 
  my money is already in hbo 's hands . 
  svt and hbo does n't give a fuck what i do in the privacy of my own home , and like i said i already gave them my money . 
  why in the world would pirating the show be immoral in this situation ? 
  it makes no difference for me , hbo , or svt . 
  yes , the terms and conditions probably said i am not allowed to do that but it makes no difference for all of the parties involved , except for me who gets to watch the show . 
   no you are stealing , since yo do n't pay for it . 
  if i copy the a video game , does that make me the owner of the game ? 
  no it does not . 
  if you borrow a game does that make you its owner ? 
  sony has even made videos for the ps4 encouraging borrowing games , so clearly you have the ` right ' to borrow games for the ps4 . 
  but what if you illegally download to same extent that you would borrow games ? 
  that is robbery and theft and you do n't have the right to do that i guess ? 
  so here the method of distribution determines whether something is immoral or not , this is not a practical view point you have to admit . 
  ** tl ; dr ** our fundamental disagreement is that you say that the method of distribution matters , and that if you use channels that the law or terms and conditions do n't give you the right to use , you commit theft , and theft is immoral . 
  and i say that it does n't matter if the end result is the same or if no sale is lost . 
   even if they have , that does not give you the right to steal it on the internet . 
  you have to watch it on those respective channels . 
  i 'm speechless as to why you would be opposed to torrenting in this situation , just why ? 
  it makes absolutely ** no ** difference in practice , ** none , nada , nil ** . 
  i do n't have a tracker on my tv . 
  just , why ? 
  i 'm baffled . 
   [ ... ] you are stealing property . 
  pure and simple . 
  you 're * copying * property , there is a difference . 
  it is not the same as stealing from a store as there is only a potential loss of a sale . 
  i agree that downloading illegally instead of buying is wrong , but i think it is perfectly acceptable to download when you would n't have access to it and bought it otherwise . 
   you think no one is causing grief by stealing someones work off the internet ? 
  are we arguing that digital work is not real produce at this point ? 
  no to both statements , you deconstructed my argument wrong . 
   when ( no one is caused grief by illegal downloading ) = = true  why do you think it is immoral ? 
  question still stands , you need to argue why you 're opposed to downloading illegally when no one is losing potential sales . 
   give me a source on a swedish `` national tv show '' that has bought the license .
