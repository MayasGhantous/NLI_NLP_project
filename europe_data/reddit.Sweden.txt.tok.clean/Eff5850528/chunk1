as far as we know , yes . 
  / sweden, 
   karl gustav of sweden gustav ii adolf , no karl in there , 
   his life would make a great game of thrones character . 
  and we have [ `` the lion of the north '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gustavus_adolphus_of_sweden ) as well . 
  and there are plenty of other interesting characters around to make a game of thrones like thing out of it . 
  [ christina ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christina,_queen_of_sweden ) too , from sweden , while it happened just after the wars , choosing not to marry , abdicating and converting to catholicism is a pretty ballsy thing to do while ruling one of the most zealous protestant nations in europe . 
  you 're welcome . 
  the fact that they even considered the war in afghanistan a `` defensive war '' is what 's worrying . 
  even if they did n't force anyone in nato to join , it was treated as if they were defending themselves . 
  i think it 's a bit of an attitude difference . 
  i would not want the swedish army doing anything other than strictly defending our own nation ( or any nato nation if we joined ) . 
  even if we in some way was in a war were we had the advantage i would not want us to push the war in our favour , i would just make peace as soon as possible . 
  going to afghanistan to fight a war seems really wrong to me . 
  i 'm potentially okey with peacekeeping missions , but i would never support an invasion of any foreign country . 
  -- i 'm not saying that i think they would do something like that . 
  but the chance of it still worries me , which is why i 'm sceptical of joining . 
  i think it looks fine . 
  but i do n't see the eu anything like my own country . 
  not that i would hang a swedish flag anywhere in my room anyway , it 's a bit ugly . 
  not a huge fan of the eu anyway , i like a lot of things about it but there 's also a lot i do n't like . 
  and i do n't want to unite the eu at all , current levels of integration is tolerable but not much more . 
  if we had a vote in sweden about leaving the eu i would have a hard time to choose . 
  is n't that generally what everything putin does is explained as ? 
  even things like invading ukraine and stuff , distract the russian population . 
   and while they definitely need aid , they tend to need it for more basic needs , such as clean water or basic healthcare . 
  what are your sources for that ? 
  do n't mean to be antagonising , genuinely just curious why you think that is what they need the most ? 
  obviously a lot of people down there need that too , but i thought there were huge populations , especially in the cities , where that might not be their primary concern ? 
  they have access to healthcare and such , what they need is money to live off . 
  http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sp.urb.totl.in.zs?name_desc=false for example , from what i 've heard , what you 're talking about , and what most people think about when they think of africa , are the rural populations . 
  but in the last decades there has been massive urbanisation in most african countries , and the people living in the new mega cities have very different needs to the rural farmers . 
  i guess they still need medicine and clean water , but i 'm not sure that is the most important to them , if they had more money they could get those things themselves anyway . 
  yes , it is . 
  most swedes support a swedish-finnish military cooperation/alliance thing though . 
  very many here would want to help finland if they were attacked . 
  most of all we trust finland to not provoke a stupid war that we would get drawn into , unlike certain nato members . 
  if we are talking about military cooperation between nations close to us that we trust , like the nordics , we might still be a bit divided . 
  but it 's not a division between a `` strictly neutral '' and `` nordic alliance '' stance , it 's between `` we need a military '' and `` we should get rid of our military '' . 
  i do n't think anyone who supports a proper swedish army to defend our country opposes closer nordic military cooperation . 
  the ones who do are the ones who opposes the military as a whole . 
  eu cooperation is a bit more split , because we do n't entirely trust all of the eu to not do some stupid shit . 
  but it 's still better than nato i would think , since the us is really low on the list of nations people trust not to go to stupid wars . 
  we have the same winds ( the entire west coast does ) , on top of that we also have many hills , so when you 're on top of one it 's awful , winds coming in straight from the north sea . 
  one plus with that is that at least it 's sometimes calmer on the leeside of the hills . 
   i do n't really understand why eu military cooperation ca n't be built up inside of the structure already provided by nato . 
  because some countries who might want to join the `` eu army '' does not want to join nato . 
  ( finland , sweden , austria , ireland ) from my point of view here in sweden , the main reason for wanting an eu army in the first place is so we do n't have to rely as much on the us as we would in nato . 
  i can accept giving away power to the eu to some extent , but not to the us . 
  that said , as is shown on the map , we still prefer neutrality over any alliance , for the time being . 
  swedish government has essentially said that it 's bad and they do n't like him but obviously has to make the best of the situation . 
  not surprising really , they are social democrats . 
  yeah , he has talked about a lot of horrible shit . 
  but especially this i 'm actually really worried about how much damage could be done . 
  lots of the other stuff like his famous wall is n't particularly realistic ideas , but majorly fucking over the environment hardly requires any effort . 
  having snow cover by christmas is pretty rare in the southern parts of the country ( which the picture is , ish ) , in early november it is very rare . 
  it snows a lot , but it usually melts away as it falls . 
  it 's only really in january and february that we get proper winter , and even that is not guaranteed . 
  but up north they get metres of snow and -30 degrees . 
  so it varies a lot over the country . 
  i have almost no snow here in gothenburg right now , despite it having snowed a lot , it just melts . 
   i struggle to see an advantage of wood tbh , care to enlighten me ? 
  i think it handles moisture better . 
  ( does n't get mold as easily ) also better insulated than at least metal , not sure how it compares to bricks . 
  easy to build . 
  ( maybe cheap too ? 
  not sure ) in case of sweden we have a massive timber industry , so it makes sense to use that to build our houses . 
  but probably mostly just because of looks and tradition . 
  most of our houses here are made at least partly of wood , and as long as you maintain them they wo n't rot or get infested with insects or whatever . 
  mostly just need to paint it every 20 years or so . 
  they last for 100 + years if you take care of them ( lots of old wooden houses around from at least the 1800s ) . 
  there are wooden buildings around that are like 1000 years old . 
  welcome to sweden . 
   an article on nitrate ? 
  really ? 
  what 's wrong with it ? 
  well no , but still sort of , spain is very far west in their timezone . 
  [ they are in the same timezone as poland , for example . 
  ] ( http://holykaw.alltop.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/timezoneerror.png ), 
  guys , this is `` biogeographical '' regions , not climate . 
  so basically regions divided by what types of species there are and stuff , not entirely sure myself . 
  climate does play a big part in this , but it 's not the same . 
  if you want a map of climate regions : [ here you go ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/world_koppen_classification_%28with_authors%29.svg ), 
  karst is n't a biogeographical region , it 's more like a type of landform . 
  yeah , but not everyone uses dot separators like that ( 1.11 ) . 
  has to be specifically `` 1/11 '' in sweden or no one would understand it for example . 
  ( unless you add the full year as well ), 
  it 's not until saturday here , right ? 
  probably because the map is entirely made from ( and for ) sailing . 
  so counting the number of bays on a coastline is relatively easy compared to most other things , like measuring distance . 
  you can measure latitude by looking at the angle the sun sits above the horizon at midday . 
  can also be done with stars i think . 
  a lot of the distances were also made by how long it took for a ship to travel there , and relatively directions between places from compasses . 
  and a lot of guessing when they did n't have enough info , like northern europe . 
  longitude is much trickier and requires accurate clocks that you can actually bring aboard ships ( ie no pendulums ) . 
  so maps were n't accurate at all until we figured that out ( ~ 18th century ) . 
  but when we did [ we basically got modern world maps ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lfbnsrcojba/tifp_cpcy7i/aaaaaaaacs8/ieug3ol8t-m/s1600/colton%2527s_map_1852.jpg ) , we did n't need satellites for that . 
  in fact , even today most maps are based on aerial photography ( thanks ww1 ) , not satellite images . 
  accurate inland maps came much later than the sea , an amazing example of how they did it at first is [ the great trigonometrical survey of india ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_trigonometrical_survey ) . 
  but we only mapped the populated and `` important '' areas like that .
