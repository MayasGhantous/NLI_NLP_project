  but that does n't explain why they are n't including france in the base game ? 
  there are at least 2 maps * in * france , and [ historically the french fought along the british in those battles ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spring_offensive ) . 
  but the french are n't even in the fucking game . 
  i do n't think anyone is actually mad about the us being included , it is the fact that they are completely cutting out the two biggest contributors to the entente war effort that people are actually pissed off about . 
  the fact america gets blamed is because they are probably the least historically significant of the countries currently included in the game . 
  the `` mockery '' would stop if they just had more factions in the game at all , it 's the lack of ( extremely important ) factions that is the problem for people , not the inclusion of the us . 
  people also see the game as an american product , and it being a historical game ( regardless of claims of accuracy , it is still based on history ) it shows a lack of respect ( from americans ) for especially france that they are cut out given the circumstances . 
  it is basically whitewashing in a sense , not showing the french participation in the war . 
  it 's not exactly an american game though , so i personally think that thinking is a bit silly . 
  but france should be in the base game regardless . 
  lack of russians is more about the maps , there are n't going to be any eastern front until dlc or something . 
  but the french should fucking be there though . 
  cutting out france from the base game is still completely idiotic . 
  they are n't exactly making a western front dlc . 
  they are adding in the french and the russians as dlc later . 
  i can understand that decision for russia ( not exactly supporting the dlc idea though ) , the war is big , having it all in a game from the start is pretty ambitious . 
  ( dice could totally do it though , it 's all about money , but still ) but having 2/4 confirmed maps being * in * france , with the french army historically fighting those battles just as much as the british did , and then not even have the french in the game at launch is ridiculous . 
  they really need to add at least some map with france vs germany instead of just having britain vs germany ( in france ! ), 
  on every map from the western front . 
  i get that they wo n't have multiple armies on one side in the same battle for gameplay reasons , but leaving the french out entirely is fucking stupid , at least give them some representation , they deserve that much . 
  dice are making a historical game , obviously not an accurate work of history or anything , but at least treat the history with some respect . 
  ok , i think i get what you 're saying now , basically use the existing cities/municipalities/counties or whatever smaller administrative areas each country uses , but remove all the `` useless '' ones and split them up into the bigger cities ' spheres . 
  it could work . 
  would have a lot of opposition from the countryside though , with more decisions being taken in a single central city ( instead of over the entire country ) they are bound to loose out much more . 
  and it would vary a lot how the countryside gets treated depending on the urban/rural composition . 
  in essence , rural communities probably feel more connected to other rural communities , but not at all with the cities , and the other way around , the urban/rural ratio of a region would create very big differences in how the region is run , even though the urban and rural communities in themselves probably looks roughly the same as all other regions . 
  the national governments , and other regional governments is what is currently leveling out these differences in interests , that would not happen nearly as much in a region with a single strong central city , the countryside would suffer . 
  and the opposite in a very rural region with a small central city , the city would suffer . 
  not sure what you mean , an official city center i guess ? 
  what about cities that have grown together ? 
  are they considered one big city , and if so where is the center ? 
  if not , where are the border between them ? 
  just a cut in the middle of a neighbourhood depending on which city center they are closest to ? 
  my point is that to do this without it getting ridiculously convoluted and getting arbitrary results you do still have to draw some more or less arbitrary lines at some point , either for the whole region or the city itself . 
  so why not just keep the existing regions and work from the existing power structures instead of rearranging it needlessly ? 
   the territory nearest to it . 
  how do you measure that without knowing what the borders of the cities is ? 
   like have own schools , hospitals etc. 
  would need to define what a school and a hospital is then . 
  what is and is n't a city ? 
  and where are the city 's borders ? 
  and you really only need one person from another tree to mix it up completely over a few generations . 
  do n't you have someone handing out tickets to all the people who ca n't park properly ? 
  i think that 's mostly a coincidence , those areas has been the centre of european culture for a long time , and usually things spread out from there to the outlying areas , the eu is a good example of that . 
   i think most non-english speaking countries do the same . 
  we actually call them `` britter '' , and if not we at least try choosing the right nationality , so `` engelsm\u00e4n '' , `` skottar '' or `` irl\u00e4ndare '' . 
  ( sorry wales ) so not every non-english country  almost always storbritannien when talking about the country though , or england/skottland/nordirland / wales . 
  no such thing as `` the uk '' in swedish . 
  to be fair , `` the continent '' or `` europe '' is often used in swedish too when talking about the mainland ( although `` europe '' is used a lot less than the british do , but it still happens ) . 
  in my mind there are different levels of europeaness , germany/france is like the core , then we in the north are definitely part of europe , but not on the same level as the central europeans , same thing with the british isles . 
  eastern europe or the balkans too . 
  the brits are probably more extreme in that regard though , but i do n't really know . 
  n\u00f6rd-ica hehe , they are calling you nerds :d, 
  it 's not like it affects us . 
  why should we care ? 
  they should have waited with the weather switch a bit , now it 's just even unlikelier we will not have rain on midsummer , the rain will almost certainly have come back by then :( / swedish problems, 
   and no you can not join without a bike culture so when does a country have a `` bike culture '' ? 
   cycling culture refers to cities and countries which actively support a large percentage of utility cycling . 
  examples include denmark , the netherlands , germany , belgium ( flanders in particular ) , ** sweden ** , china , bangladesh and japan . 
  according to wikipedia . 
  i am aware that we do n't use bikes as much as you guys ( i blame the many hills in our two biggest cities ) , but cycling to and from school and work is very normal in most of the country . 
  edit : eh , fuck you guys , i 'm going to form a ski culture club with norway and finland instead :p, 
  it 's a lot lower in eastern and northern europe . 
  we bring down the average . 
  19/28 , i do n't fucking know how your coins look , or who your kings/queens are ... also the slovakia/slovenia/croatia question , totally fair ... 
  [ i would suggest that a repeat is not necessary ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_lund ) , gg though , one of the few battles from that era with such heavy swedish losses . 
  either way , if you wanted us to join your federation you could just ask :(, 
  [ the highest point in the netherlands ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vaalserberg ) is actually quite a lot higher than [ the highest point in denmark ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/m%c3%b8lleh%c3%b8j ) . 
  well , you 're not wrong , but bikes are not some precious treasure to most people , they are a tool and supposed to be used . 
  it 's like not driving your car when it 's raining outside , hardly mistreatment of the car , unless it 's a rare car or something , and i 'm pretty sure those bikes are not rare . 
  and you 're supposed to oil the chain regularly anyway , only thing this will do is making it so you have to do it sooner . 
  i think another reason foodstuff is fairly cheap in germany is that you produce a lot of it . 
  i can mostly compare to sweden , but i think we have good competition here too , but most swedish goods are much more expensive than their german counterparts . 
  if you buy the cheap brands here they are usually from germany , and the normal/expensive brands are from sweden . 
  speaking of suspiciously looking lidls , [ my local one ] ( https://streetview.hitta.se/streetview/v4/snapshots/3230/19193/stigbergstorget10gooteborg.jpg ) , although it shut down a few months ago . 
  it 's an old cinema . 
  being allowed to build something is the problem , not the actual work itself . 
  it mostly just takes a really long time and lots of effort to get a building permit , from what i 've heard . 
  mostly because of the regulations on what can and can not be built . 
  [ i like it ] ( http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/lotr/images/7/77/isengard_army.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120601223256 ), 
  estonian alcohol can into nordic though ... 
  http://checkcheckcheck.se/ translation : right now : xxx checkmarks - on '' [ the evening post ] ( http://www.aftonbladet.se/ ) `` s frontpage and then you can click `` visa alla bockar '' to see them all . 
  for some reason our biggest tabloid is completely obsessed with red checkmarks , and puts them in front of every other sentence . 
  http://www.migrationsverket.se/english/private-individuals/protection-and-asylum-in-sweden/applying-for-asylum.html if you want to come to sweden . 
  seriously though , you 're actually free to apply for asylum , it 's just extremely unlikely it will get accepted . 
  sweden does n't have a minimum wage either . 
  although we have extremely strong unions and our collective agreements could effectively be considered as a sort of minimum wage . 
  the facts has still been considered , but pleasing their voters and the media often comes before `` hard numbers '' as some people here put it . 
  it 's the main flaw of all democracies , they rely on the entire population being educated , not just the leaders , which is not always realistic . 
  `` leftist '' in this circumstance , on reddit , is basically anything that is n't sd . 
  most news outlets are fairly centrist , or whatever it 's called . 
  and even swedish centrists have been mostly pro immigration . 
   btw , anyone noticing how little variety of food there is in the africans examples ? 
  a few big sacks of some grain and then some tiny amounts of a few other types of food . 
  that 's what happens when you 're poor . 
  not first world poor that is . 
  nothing wrong with wikipedia in itself ( it is often much more accurate than a single text , due to it 's collaborative nature ) . 
  but it is only as good as it 's own sources are , so you should go look at those instead of whining about wikipedia . 
  yes there is ? 
  unless i 'm looking at the wrong town , there 's a river running right through it , and a smaller stream joining the bigger river in the middle of the town .
