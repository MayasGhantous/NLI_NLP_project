  and , you know , not building in places where there is a high risk of flooding . 
  pretty much everywhere in the world that has a lot of rain needs to be better at planning for floods . 
  since almost every city lies near some sort of water . 
  germany is not alone in the need to plan this sort of stuff better . 
  the second edit one ? 
  i do n't know much about house prices , but checking hemnet.se , 750 000 $ or more ( like 1 mil + for the nicer/bigger houses ) . 
  that 's in central stockholm though . 
  similar houses in some less attractive location can be much cheaper . 
  i grew up in the countryside in sweden . 
  lots of hunting , and sport shooting ( or whatever it 's called ) . 
  i know lots of people who own guns , but they all actually go hunting with them . 
  although they probably have more than one gun , and might not use them all for hunting . 
  i just think it 's very rare for a person to have a weapons license without being a hunter . 
  but might be wrong , only anecdotal evidence . 
  as others pointed out , to make nato seem antagonising or something like that . 
  the reason they are fine with pushing sweden closer to nato is because they do n't care about sweden anyway , they are already close enough to nato and anti-russian enough that there is n't much point in trying to turn them towards russia . 
  pretty sure the nordic numbers are almost entirely from hunters . 
  not denying your point , just adding some context . 
  i think i 've seen two from romania , nothing special about them . 
  have n't seen anything from new york . 
  but i have added some more expensive areas now . 
  my first picture is equal to most things posted in this thread , and it 's representative of almost all swedish housing areas , even fairly expensive ones , they do n't look that different , just a bit bigger houses , it 's mostly about location . 
  first picture is a fairly well off neighbourhood . 
  last one too , but i can add a picture from liding\u00f6 or something if you want . 
  why not ? 
  what would you add ? 
  mostly in south western scania really . 
  i grew up on the scania/blekinge border and there 's plenty of wood houses around there . 
  the scanian plains has more danish architecture , that is correct . 
  same thing with the painting , it depends on why you like the painting , if i like it because it 's historical significance a copy is nice to have , but not the same . 
  if i just like the way it looks a copy is no different from the original . 
  yeah , it started getting popular in sweden again ( i think it 's from the 60s originally ) just before i started high school , in like 05-06 ( at least that 's when i noticed it ) . 
  since then pretty much everyone here got one , but i guess it spread to other countries too . 
  basically starting random conversations with strangers . 
  anything other than `` thanks '' or `` sorry '' or stuff like that seems strange unless you have a reason . 
  but hey , i 'm scandinavian , we ca n't help it . 
  and as i said , i 'm fine with it , should n't force my weird ways upon you , haha .

  depends how you classify something as a `` suburb '' too . 
  most nicer areas are close to the city centres here , so most suburbs here are not particularly nice .

  but it makes me think you have some sort of motive behind it , like , it 's pretty obviously `` fake '' niceness , so why ? 
  it 's fine , but i do sort of get that feeling , ca n't help it . 
  i think i 'm just not used to random people being overly nice , we just try to stay out of each others way over here . 
   ah , and you guys are kings of queuing , too !, 
  i think my countrymen would like to dispute the english superiority on that matter . 
  although , i think we put quite a lot of effort to fit in whenever we visit another country , unlike the brits , so our fondness of queueing might not show unless you come to sweden . 
  from my experience , on ski resorts : obnoxiously loud walkie-talkies . 
  no idea why , but for some reasons all russians had them and talked to each other or something . 
  swedes , danes and norwegians are really hard to tell the difference between , even as a swede , only real giveaway is the language and even that can be tricky unless you 're listening closely , especially norwegian sounds really similar to swedish if you 're close enough to hear them speak but not close enough to hear what they are saying . 
  maybe it 's just me , but i fell like finns look a bit different than the average scandinavian , obviously not a lot and there 's plenty of overlap , but still enough to sometimes tell them apart . 
  while all the scandinavians look pretty much the same , on average . 
  you could go for the stereotypical norwegian being very outdoorsy and that sort of thing ( which might show on their clothes ) , but that 's not exactly a unique feature at all , and only really works over a large amount of people . 
  yeah , i think it has sort of spread now , maybe not a good swedish identifier any more . 
  sorry , removed that part , thought it was irrelevant . 
  but yes , you 're right . 
  blonde hair and wearing [ this backpack ] ( http://www.fjallraven.se/kanken ) . 
  if most of the material is still there i agree with you . 
  but when most of the structure is just modern concrete it sort of ruins it for me ( sorry ) . 
  you might as well just build a copy somewhere else at that point , not covering up the existing ruin with a modern copy . 
  the coolest thing to me about these buildings is how old they are , they were built centuries ago and they in a way serves as a connection between us and the people from the past . 
  a modern recreation looses that aspect , it still looks as good or better , but you do n't need to go to ancient ruins to look at nice looking buildings . 
  photos or drawings are honestly good enough for me just to understand how it looked , if i go visit it i want to see the actual ancient ruin , not a reconstruction . 
  the more you `` fix '' it the more fake it becomes . 
  i think it 's mostly sweden . 
  lot 's of music coming out of here , not just metal . 
  probably because our government is the only one that keeps track of this , but they claim to have the worlds highest music exports per capita . 
  also people like [ this guy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/max_martin ) . 
  building restrictions is the only real hindrance i know about . 
  probably other regulations too that is stopping it , our governments like that sort of stuff . 
  it is strange , i do n't understand why there is n't more building , this situation has steadily been getting worse for several years now , but there 's still not much being done about it . 
  you can get a sublet in a short amount of time , but the official queues for rental apartments are around 5 years or longer for anything near stockholm . 
  20 years is only for specific areas . 
  we apparently have about the same average rent here as you . 
  but on top of that there 's also a massive shortage of apartments , so you have to wait around 5 years to get an apartment at all . 
  it can always get worse . 
  / gothenburg speaking of worse , the queues are [ getting close to 20 years in some parts of stockholm ] ( http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20160517-this-is-one-city-where-youll-never-find-a-home ) now . 
  what ? 
  you 're suggesting we should build more houses ? 
  what a silly idea ... 
  if there 's a need for electricians or plumbers they will get payed more , and if there 's too many developers they will get paid less ( that 's the idea anyway ) . 
  how long the education is does n't matter . 
  same thing with historians , they can have a very long education but they are not necessarily useful just because of that . 
  [ here they drive around the city partying on the back of lorries .

  yes , but not for private use . 
  unlike some mediterranean countries , where every other family or at least village makes their own wine . 
  both finland and norway has similar systems , so not really comparable , and denmark has always been more of a beer country than us . 
  the big change in sweden was the rationing system we had from the 20s to the 50s , you were only allowed to buy a certain amount of alcohol each month . 
  before initiatives like that we had a similar alcohol culture to for example russia , vodka ( br\u00e4nnvin ) everywhere all the time ( have seen 34 litres annual per capita consumption of spirits from the 19th century , not sure how correct that is ) . 
  that might have change by itself though , it 's hard to tell .
