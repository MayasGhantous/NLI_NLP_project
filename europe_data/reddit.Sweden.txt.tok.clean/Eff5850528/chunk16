  there might be reasons to not have a pride parade in that area , but if it 's because of peoples religions or some other reason should n't matter . 
  anyway , my point was that `` left-wing '' is n't one single entity with some sort of hivemind who agrees on everything . 
  you just got to fight a war or two with germany . 
  then maybe people would accept it . 
  nah , i 'm fine at least . 
  seriously though , who are you suggesting where the `` legal owners '' ? 
  i do n't think there are more moose up north ( might even be fewer due to competition with reindeer and so on ) . 
  i lived far south in sweden and we still had lots of them . 
  you 'll probably see some eventually if you spend time outside of the cities . 
  as i said in another comment , they do n't care much about humans , unlike many animals who run away as soon as they hear you , moose just slowly walk/jog away from you , or just ignore you completely . 
  so they are n't terribly hard to find . 
  ( do n't mess with them though , they are a lot bigger than you ... [ unless you 're this guy i guess ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzebbz2irxe ) ), 
  you must have at least seen some deer ? 
  they are everywhere at least here in sweden , i saw one walking around like in the middle of gothenburg the other day . 
  and if you just drive across the country some you 'll see some moose eventually . 
  it 's a bit rarer to spot them in the forest itself if you 're walking or something since you ca n't see very far , but seeing them on fields while driving is really common . 
  [ or maybe like this , haha ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsyxb0azmpm ) . 
  the coolest thing i 've seen in the wild is a wild wolf while driving through v\u00e4rmland . 
  really ? 
  i thought lynxes were super hard to spot . 
  and moose just do n't give a fuck , they can easily just stand around a garden eating stuff even while there are people around . 
  [ reminded me of this thing from just a few days ago , haha ] ( http://www.svt.se/nyheter/lokalt/sormland/se-yahyas-mote-med-skogens-konung ) . 
  ( he said the moose did n't understand either swedish or somalian . . ) i 've never seen a lynx though , and neither has my grandpa who 's out in the forest all the time , although i guess they are rarer in the southern parts of the country . 
  ( but we did have lynx in the woods there , or at least the local hunters said so ), 
  a lot of old soldier names are cool as well . 
  like stark ( strong ) , sv\u00e4rd ( sword ) , modig ( brave ) and so on . 
  dude , it was built in like 12 bc . . you could have complained about it to your local roman governor or whatever back then , a bit too late now . 
  pyramids are pretty neat . 
   better tools and knowledge are available now than back when everything was basically done by hand . 
  the main reason people prefer older architecture is because they think it looks nicer . 
  and one of the main reasons we do n't make buildings look as nice any more is exactly because it would need to be done by hand , which we ca n't really afford any more , wages are too high , and in some cases the knowledge to make that stuff is almost forgotten , complicated masonry for example . 
  i mean they can do things like it of course , but the actual way they did it back then which had been worked on over generations has more or less been forgotten . 
  they were built in the 20s , so back then they would have probably felt a bit taller . 
   why would anyone want to bother doing this in sweden , of all places ? 
  well the person who did this probably lives in sweden , so i dunno , seems pretty logical to do it here ? 
  it 's not like muslim hate against the `` western world '' is limited to the countries militarily involved in their homelands , like the us or whatever . 
  like all people they like to generalise and simplify things if possible ( like i 'm sure a lot of people in the west do about muslims ) . 
  in their eyes the entire west is the problem , including sweden . 
  very much an `` us vs them '' thing , and sweden is definitely not on their side . 
  a lot of the muslim extremists do n't care about what countries are doing . 
  to them it 's them against everyone else , especially `` the west '' . 
  it 's probably not a particularly rational decision to do an attack like this either way . 
  gang wars , not terror attacks . 
  seems pretty obvious . 
  i may be wrong of course , but it definitely was n't an accident . 
  the driver might have just been crazy i guess , but even then the line between that and `` terror '' seems pretty blurry . 
  not sure why anyone would do things like this other than to spread terror ? 
  do n't think these are particular rational actions done to benefit any particular person or group . 
  i think feelings play a bigger part in why they do this than rational thought . 
   the more this happens the more i rethink moving to europe , which is a real big fucking shame . 
  i hope something changes . 
  i feel so bad for everyone that has died in all of these attacks . 
  if it makes things any better , this is pretty much the first successful terrorist attack in swedish history . 
   what could you possibly accomplish by splitting people in half with your vehicle ? 
  terror, 
  and it does in sweden too . 
  [ same thing was done in scandinavia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scandinavian_monetary_union ) , and ww1 collapsed that one too . 
  but we still use the same currency , they are just not pegged to the same gold value any more . 
  that 's why we have * kroner/kronor * ( crowns ) , and not * daler * like we had before . 
  it was danish originally , the original company was just bought by fazer who are finnish . 
  [ got messy further east :( ] ( https://i.imgur.com/sjmvqyo.png ) i do n't have much problem getting the shape right , but the length and proportions are really difficult . 
  so i just sort of gave up on the balkans being right , at least most countries border the right ones . 
  euro support in sweden , denmark and czechia is pretty funny . 
  there have been plenty of presidents with german ancestry . 
  but you 're right that english families have generally been the most powerful . 
  they are the ones who have been in the us the longest after all . 
  most germans came later . 
  it 's still autumn here on the west coast . 
  not sure what he means to be honest , maybe he 's [ thinking about this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/junker_ ( prussia \\ ) ) ? 
  yes . 
  sverige is what our country is actually called , `` sweden '' is some dutch invention . 
  sv\u00e4rje is approximately how sverige is pronounced ( using swedish grammar ) . 
  i guess the w is just to make it more fancy or something . 
  / r/sweden is a bit too similar to / r/swarje imo . 
  but it is almost exactly like a miniature version of reddits front page , but in swedish ( memes and all ) . 
  so i think it actually does it 's job very well . 
  it is supposed to be a place for people to share stuff in , both serious and `` funny '' . 
  it 's not just a discussion forum , even if a lot of people want it to only be about that . 
  the 25 posts on the / r/sweden front page right now : 13 funny pictures/memes , 10 news stories ( some less serious than others ) , 2 others ( one music video ... ish , and one selfpost asking a question ) . 
  that 's relatively mixed still . 
  i have a hard time believing it 's the `` worst '' in any case , considering how much stuff gets posted there , even if a lot of it is pretty bad . 
  ok , good that you 're consistent at least . 
  / r/norway is linked there though , but / r/norge is the actual norwegian subreddit . 
  same with / r/de . 
  but i 'm sure if you just took the largest one people would complain about that instead ( if the english speaking sub is larger for example ) . 
  at least now people are aware of this ( if they read the comments ) . 
   even in schools we learn american english not british english , at least i used to . 
  we learnt both in sweden , but british was the primary one . 
  might depend on the teacher though . 
  we were allowed to use either as long as we were consistent . 
   no but seriously , since most of the foreign entertainment/media/tech is already in english , and so many euros speak it , why go to the trouble ? 
  exactly , and what would even be the reason to * not * use english ? 
  surely more people using the same language is just a good thing ? 
  they had a bit more reason to do it than europe does . 
  they did n't have a common language back then ( right ? 
  ) , and were way more motivated to create a new national identity , something which most europeans are n't interested in . 
  french was the lingua franca before english took over around ww1 ( lingua * franca * , you know ) . 
  it 's not really comparable because we did n't have mass media back then , so the general populace did n't really speak any other language . 
  but the international communications there was were most likely in french . 
  of course something else could have taken french 's place , but it is the natural assumption if you did n't specify the scenario further .
