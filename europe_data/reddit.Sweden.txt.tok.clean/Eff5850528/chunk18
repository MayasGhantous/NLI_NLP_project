  just talking about the differences . 
  do n't think you can judge it by how crazy the drivers are , that has more to do with how obsessed people are of following rules than anything else . 
  sweden is among the nicest countries to drive in in that regard , but people here are anything but relaxed , got ta have rules for everything , ca n't allow individualism or anything like that . 
  you do have a point about the work hours though , but the main difference from what i 've seen is that people in greece just do n't take their work that seriously , it 's not the most important thing in the world . 
  unlike for example northern europe . 
  you work to live , not the other way around . 
  but i might be completely wrong , ca n't exactly judge these things very well as a visitor . 
  this is just my impression . 
  definitely a contender for most relaxed country in europe . 
  polar opposite of sweden in almost every way , which i think is why so many swedes like going there on vacation . 
   they are often strays so if you visit , please adopt a kitty !, 
  pretty much every greek taverna has a bunch of strays roaming around begging for food , so they are not exactly hard to find , haha . 
  not sure if `` adopting '' them is a good idea though ... 
  it was called [ estland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/duchy_of_estonia_ ( 1561 % e2 % 80 % 931721 \\ ) ) by the swedes though . 
   2 `` christians '' could be believing completely opposite things yet theyre both christian ? 
  that is definitely the case , even when talking about christians who believe in god , compare westboro baptists church to some mainstream church for example . 
  the way it works is that you believe in what is written in the bible , but you do n't believe it 's a message from god . 
  jesus existed and probably did a bunch of stuff and so on , but he was not the son of god . 
  but everything written about him and so on is important , and we should take inspiration from him and bla bla bla . 
  even christians who do believe in god rarely take the bible literally , it 's about the message it 's trying to convey , not facts . 
  you believe in the message of the bible , but you do n't take it literally . 
  i 'm pretty sure that 's how most religious people in sweden think , christian values and what not are good , but some omniscient being creating the world might not be the exact truth . 
  darkest green is europe , not sure about what period all of those are , most probably napoleon . 
  the dark green in north america and india is because they did n't hold those territories at the same time as the african empire , which was later . 
  every other house here has a flagpole with a swedish flag in their garden ( or at least a smaller flag to mount on the wall when needed ) . 
  they at least fly the flag on flag days , birthdays , or if someone died ( but only halfway then ofc ) . 
  and we have flags everywhere on midsummer . 
  any sort of parade or that sort of thing too ( student graduations for example ) . 
  could have sued for peace earlier instead of trying to invade russia . 
  would have lost to russia sooner or later anyway though , just no way to compete with them if they actually manage to use the resources they had somewhat efficiently . 
  so looking at it that way the choice to invade them was the `` correct '' one , had to knock them out as soon as possible , timing was not right though . 
  [ yes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/truce_of_altmark ) . 
  but only for a limited period of time , the cities were handed back to poland willingly in the next peace . 
  i think the money collected from tolls in those cities where a major reason sweden managed to fight the thirty years war at all . 
  it was official with the treaty of roskilde , which is what is shown on the map , but that only lasted two years until the next treaty of copenhagen that you talk about , where tr\u00f6ndelag and bornholm was handed back to denmark . 
  no occupations are shown on this map , then most of poland and half of germany would be shown as well . 
  only land officially ceded to sweden , and tr\u00f6ndelag and bornholm was for two years . 
  i would guess the green line is because swedish authorities never had much control over the areas . 
  the territory lost in 1721 to russia on the map was what ended those wars , so those `` conquests '' are included ... 
  sweden tried [ invading russia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_invasion_of_russia ) . 
  this was also around the time that [ peter the great ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peter_the_great ) modernised the russian state , making them a lot deadlier than before . 
  the invasion of russia ended badly ( surprise ... ) , [ the battle of poltava ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_poltava ) is known by most swedes . 
  russia occupied everything on the eastern baltic coast and started raiding the swedish mainland . 
  the [ peace with them ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_nystad ) was signed in 1721 and marks the end of the swedish `` great power period '' . 
  fun fact : st petersburg was built during the war in 1703 on occupied swedish land . 
  well you guys paid for it . 
  good that you are satisfied with the results i guess . 
  the population in sk\u00e5ne still has a weird dialect compared to most of sweden because of the variant of danish that was spoken there before the conquest ( bornholm is the only survivor of the eastern danish dialects ) . 
  you can also still see some cultural and architectural differences for example . 
  occupied most of poland , most of denmark , and big chunks of germany . 
  but those were only occupations . 
  the peace of westphalia ended the swedish occupations in germany , but it only ceded the north german territories you can see on the map to sweden . 
  was thinking more as a base for your airforce , like a giant carrier . 
   your country should invest in its own nuclear program and developing modern means of delivery ... we had a nuclear program , but shut it down because we really do n't want any more nuclear weapons in the world . 
  and i 'm now even more convinced you 're insane or something . 
  or just trolling . 
  either way , not even gon na try , bye . 
  for a base covering all of the baltic sea . 
  i do n't believe russia will invade us either . 
  but you are completely deluded if you think it 's sweden who 's not being `` good neighbors and searching compromises '' , or that it 's sweden who is propping up it 's military . 
  we are purely doing this * in response * to russia , you are the ones escalating things . 
  we almost completely dismantled our military in the 90s and 2000s , but since russia is once again becoming a military threat we are forced to rebuild it . 
  your military is like 20 times bigger than ours . 
  we are n't even in any alliances except the eu , and you 're complaining about us threatening you , really ? 
   the eu is irrelevant military wise . 
  effectively maybe , as in they ca n't practically help defend sweden , but there is [ this part of the lisbon treaty ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/summary/glossary/mutual_defence.html ) , so they are obliged to do so . 
  and the reason russia wants to break it up is so they can get more influence themselves , one way to get that is actually war . 
  it 's still unlikely though . 
  if they were only worried about not getting invaded they could just join nato or at least try getting on their good side . 
  but they do n't want to give up their own power just for increased safety . 
  btw , not defending the person you responded too , just adding/correcting what you said . 
  they also talk a lot about that in the report the article is talking about . 
  but just because we have a big terrorist threat does n't make military threats from our neighbours go away . 
  so the intelligence service does it 's job and talk about both . 
  we also do n't have hundreds of thousands of young men from third world countries here . 
  just thousands . 
   being good neighbors and searching compromises is far better than being paranoid and mobilize to fight . 
  maybe you should tell your government that . 
  i think [ this is the original source ] ( http://www.sakerhetspolisen.se/ovrigt/pressrum/aktuellt/aktuellt/2017-03-16-nu-kommer-arsboken-sakerhetspolisen-2016.html ) . 
  what about nepal ? 
  to be fair , luxembourg is approximately 15 times larger than lichtenstein . 
  it 's not that badly represented actually , only 52 % voted to join . 
  massalia and emporion, 
  we are probably both right . 
  the reason i posted my argument against your first post was because i did n't think about it that way . 
  but i also have a feeling you did n't really think about it that way either when you said it , but whatever . 
  germany is in the middle of europe , so unlike spain or britain a lot of cultures have had actual significant contact with them and so created their own names . 
  and since they have n't had a centralised state for very long there has n't been any `` correct '' name to call them , like france for example , which has been a unified country for ages . 
   maybe because it 's such a modern country compared to the rest of us ? 
  people have been calling germany germany hundreds of years before the modern united germany appeared . 
  if anything it 's the other way around , it 's such an old region it has got tons of different names by different peoples . 
  `` germany '' starting during roman times for example . 
  in russia 's case , at least as i understand it , most of the 1 % or whatever got their wealth through government connections . 
  the government is actually restricting other businesses , not letting them compete . 
  so in that case a freer market would help . 
  of course the wealth might instead shift to a few ceos of private corporations or whatever if the market opens up , but that 's another issue . 
  also depends how you define `` free market '' . 
  it usually includes government intervention against monopolies and such for example . 
  to be fair , the worst one on this list , russia , is there mostly because of government corruption , and a lack of a working free market . 
  per meteorological station , i guess , then extrapolate that over larger areas .
