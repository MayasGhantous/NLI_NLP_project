  but that 's about it . 
  it 's your duty as a swedish citizen , not a job . 
   though i do n't think anyone should be forced into active duty so then you are against it . 
  very few people complain about military service in itself . 
  the problem is that the government has the ability to force people into it . 
  they should just make it completely voluntary . 
  i realise no one will really be forced now , since they are only taking in so few , but that 's even more reason to change it , what 's the point of it being mandatory if you 're not going to force anyone anyway ? 
   it will be a lottery where a small minority is forced to serv it wo n't be a lottery , and in this case it is very unlikely that anyone will be forced , they choose the people who are willing to do it before everyone else . 
  but i am still against it out of principle , it should be completely voluntary . 
   philip iv 's niece looked pretty hot [ truly ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/diego_vel%c3%a1zquez_032.jpg ), 
  we had very high immigration during the 50s/60s . 
  but it was very different from modern immigration , so people do n't really compare the two much . 
  back then they were actively encouraged to come here to work in factories , many finns and yugoslavians . 
  those finns are still our largest immigration group . 
  we also had some `` smaller '' immigration waves after that by chileans , iranians , and so on . 
  then of course it kicked off for real during the 90s with the balkan wars , and has n't stopped since . 
  anyway , immigration in sweden is not a new phenomena . 
  [ graph with emigration ( blue ) and immigration ( red ) ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/invandrare_utvandrare_sverige_1850-2007.svg ) ( keep in mind that it 's not per capita ), 
  not at all . 
  you ca n't just `` turn it up '' when you need . 
  i 'm not sure why hydro ca n't do it , but i remember reading about it and there being a good reason . 
  maybe we are just at max capacity there already when we need the oil . 
  and replace them with what ? 
  all our oil power plants are just used as reserves to handle peaks and such . 
  i do n't think we have anything that can replace them in that role yet . 
  you are the most powerful country in the world . 
  your politics affects us as well . 
  would n't exactly call it obsessed though . 
  and it 's in the baltic sea , so no shipworms and stuff to eat it up like more salty seas . 
  the sea is completely filled with old shipwrecks because wood does n't really decompose well in the environment . 
  i learned recently that a lot of big ships , tankers and stuff , go into the baltic every once in a while just to kill of all the animals living on their hulls , because they ca n't survive in the brackish water . 
  thanks ... 
  why is it a tourist trap ? 
  i 've never been to the museum , but if i 'm ever visiting stockholm as a tourist i would like to go there . 
  i can understand if you 're not interested in archaeology , but why a tourist trap ? 
  it sounds like a nickname putin would have had when he was a kid if he was swedish . 
  you sure it 's not in the dictionary ? 
  that seems unlikely . 
  i think enkel is a german loanword into the scandinavian languages . 
  simple is a loanword from french in english . 
  where a word originally comes from is not relevant . 
  i 'm a leftist myself but even i agree with him to some extent . 
  a lot of the biggest mainstream media is not nearly as open to right wing ideas and such as it could be . 
  of course if you talk about things like newspapers it 's perfectly fine , we have both right leaning and left leaning papers ( withing the traditional swedish political spectrum at least ) . 
  but if you start looking at tv , radio and such it is actually pretty universally biased towards the left . 
  media still does a pretty good job at being objective imo , the worrying part is that the little bias they have always is in the same direction . 
  we are not talking russia level propaganda here , just the fact that most people within the industry are pretty left wing , so that shines through in tv-shows and such . 
  that in turn affects swedish culture as a whole as well , where pretty left wing stuff is considered the norm , and being firmly conservative or that sort of thing is plain out weird to a lot of people who have n't really been seeing those sort of opinions before . 
  ( and not talking widely controversial opinions here , just things that would be pretty normal in most countries ), 
  i feel like people in sweden do n't care much at all about the eu , and if they do they are almost always against it . 
  but i guess being indifferent towards it is also being positive about it in a way ( complaining about the government/politicians tends to be the norm ) . 
  i have not seen many people being excited about what * more * we could do within the eu like people on this sub do . 
  we 're mostly alright with what we already have and that 's about it . 
  which is why we did n't join the eurozone for example , but why we have n't left yet , like the british . 
  you do actually have to write the \u00e9 in id\u00e9 caf\u00e9 arm\u00e9 , it 's not optional . 
  since these words are pronounced like in french , which is completely different from normal swedish pronunciation , people will read it wrong if you do n't write it like that . 
  those words are also a pretty good representation of historical french influence on europe , come to think of it . 
   but '' \u00e9 '' is n't a character in the swedish alphabet though , it 's just a diacritic . 
  you are looking at a map of diacritics though . 
   the german keyboard layout does have some so called `` dead keys '' ( ^ , ` , \u00b4 ) , but with those you 're not able to write umlaute . 
  umlaute have their own dedicated keys . 
  the cost of this is that some programming essential characters like curly braces are moved to other places and require some serious finger gymnastics : { =  altgr +7 / ctrl + alt +7 , } =  altgr +0 / ctrl + alt +0 . 
  horrendous . 
  same with nordic keyboards . 
  \u00c5\u00c4\u00d6 on their own keys , !, 
  '' # $ % & / ( ) = ? ` and @ # $ $ { [ ] } \\ \\ are shift or altgr + number keys . 
  / being shift +7 is the most annoying imo considering how often i use that . 
  somalis are not really arabic either . 
  close enough though , depends how you look at it , i think they do speak arabic ( as well as somali ) . 
   when people are given free housing i do n't think anyone in sweden is given free housing except refugees which are put in refugee shelters . 
  a lot of people are on social welfare though , so in the end it 's still sort of the same thing as what you were talking about . 
  difference is they pay their rent and so on themselves , but they still get the money for free . 
  just thought i 'd mention it . 
   any advice my fellow top ranked europeans how to become democratic country ? 
  get lucky and manage to elect decent governments for a very long period of time . 
  that will build trust in the democratic system , which is by far the most important thing . 
   what do you think we are doing wrong from your point of view ? 
  do n't think you 're doing that badly , just need more time . 
  also , do n't underestimate botswana , they were like the only country in africa that managed to maintain a functioning democratic system after independence . 
  no one really colonised the country either , which is very likely why their democracy worked , it was their own thing , not just a left over from the previous colonial overlords . 
   the entirety of china was going between 37 and 60 million people up until the modern age it was up towards 100 million during this period ( ~ 1000 ) . 
  the song dynasty was arguably one of the best times in chinese history , and the point where the chinese were the most `` ahead '' of the rest of the world . 
   that is nowhere near `` densely populated '' for a region the size of europe . 
  almost all of those lived in an area less than half the size of europe . 
  the north china plain for example housed a very big portion of those 100 million , it would actually have been relatively dense even by modern standards . 
  not comparable to our metropolitan regions by any stretch , but still comparable to many `` normal '' countries today . 
  they also had some pretty massive cities . 
  again , not comparable to our biggest cities today , but still large cities , maybe around 1 million inhabitants . 
  not like dublin in the picture . 
  china was probably pretty densely populated even back then . 
  but other than that , yeah not so much . 
  yeah , he definitely does in america . 
  then he talks about it in some of the other ones , but it 's not exactly central to the story . 
  [ this guy ] ( http://cdn1.cdnme.se/cdn/9-2/622199/images/2008/glad_mumin_18903560.jpg ), 
  ireland ? 
  yeah , the irish are breeding like rabbits , no longer empty . 
   i was probably dead anyway so why bother investing in a sword ? 
  in case you break your spear . 
  halberd or billhooks are good too of course , but slightly trickier to make than a spear ( also not easy to use with a shield ) . 
  a pike is pretty useless unless you 're in a trained formation , being able to use big shields is a big advantage if you 're just a bunch of peasants .
