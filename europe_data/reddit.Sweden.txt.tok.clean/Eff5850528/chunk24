  he 's implying that ops argument has no bearing , as in , * `` im a lazy useless slob , so i assume everyone will be too !, 
  '' * is false . 
  the rest you said is perfectly true . 
  i was just annoyed by your original comment because you were arguing with him about something that he did n't say , and i still stand by that , regardless of how much he misinterpreted op . 
   okay , he is implying that the opposite is true . 
  no he is n't . 
  he is simply implying that what op said is false . 
  he 's not trying to prove any of his own points . 
  he 's not arguing the opposite , just saying that that type of argument means nothing . 
  you could move to madagascar , i 've heard they are fans of that type of farming there . 
  well , sort of , but not really . 
  the `` best '' soils are on the steppes , so places like ukraine or the american plains . 
  there are a lot more things disqualifying the british isles from that than latitude , mainly being a small island in the atlantic , so the weather does n't exactly work for that . 
  most fertile soils tend to be in volcanic regions ( i think ) , but they are n't as resilient . 
  the uk still has very fertile soils though , as can be seen on the map . 
  they are just a bit vulnerable , got ta be careful so you do n't ruin them . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong though , was a while since i read up on this . 
  you did n't have window shutters to colour so you did the whole house instead ? 
  same in sweden . 
  it does exist , but i think it 's very rare . 
  most is electrical or district heating ( which i guess can be from oil or gas , but i 'm under the impression that most of that in sweden is from industries who would waste the heat otherwise ) . 
  we do have quite a lot of people out in the countryside who still heat their houses partly with wood stoves though . 
  but again , not a large percentage of the population , and that 's renewable energy anyway , so does n't really count . 
  claiming your country is `` the rape capital of the world '' tend to get people pretty angry , that 's a pretty serious claim . 
  are you surprised ? 
  so can i not call your country `` moldavia '' ? 
  that 's the way it is in swedish ( moldavien ) so i always forget about the english name . 
  romania should be `` so you are a gypsy then ? 
  '' , or something like that . 
  they are generally pretty good at being unions , yeah . 
  but if there comes a time when we want to limit their power somewhat , that will probably be very difficult . 
  that 's the same reason i do n't think this sort of thing will be viable in sweden either any time soon . 
  our unions are way too powerful . 
   adding the non-eu balkan countries ( macedonia , montenegro , kosovo , bosnia , serbia and albania ) not relevant to your point , but you forget about turkey there . 
  ~ 11 million people in east thrace , ~ 0,3 trillion gdp ( only found data on istanbul ) . 
  us gdp nominal : $ 18.558 trillion eu gdp nominal : $ 16.97 trillion from wikipedia ( citing imf ) norway and switzerland is another 1 trillion . 
  then the missing balkan territories and eastern europe ( but leaving out most of russia ) should add up to the rest ( all of those areas are relatively poor , * all * of russia only has ~ 1 trillion for example ) . 
  looks alright to me . 
  wrong . 
  * new york city * is all in new york . 
  but the urban area ( or similar ) extends way into new jersey too , but that 's not part of nyc . 
  okey , that makes more sense then . 
  generally the conscription period starts when you finish school , at which point most people do n't have a business to run . 
  the issue is not really one of impracticality , if everyone knows that they get conscripted the year they turn 19 or whatever , then they wo n't be committed to anything when that happens . 
  the problem is that you 're forcing people to do something they may not want to do , which sort of goes against a lot of our societies values . 
  i 'm surprised he has n't been to sweden . 
  we are not exactly friends with russia but did n't think it was that bad . 
  would have thought he 'd visited at some point , being neighbours and all . 
  everyone on reddit does not have the same opinions . 
   i would have never guessed tha in my life . 
  now look up bangladesh and indonesia . 
  tr\u00e4dg\u00e5rd in swedish , so sort of the same , we just added `` tree '' in front to make sure , haha . 
  i think it 's because it originally meant `` enclosure '' or something like that . 
  all the other meanings came from that . 
  the area around modern day benghazi was supposedly pretty fertile back then ( and still is , relative to the actual desert ) , several greek colonies there for example . 
  and gdp is not only related to agricultural potential , even back in those days . 
  i would guess that there was a lot of trade going through libya and africa . 
  even arabic and persian coins have been found up here . 
  so supposedly they could . 
  the big city not in modern swedish . 
  mikla = big , g\u00e5rd / gar\u00f0r is a bit harder to translate , but meant something like stronghold or manor , there are no real english equivalent . 
  i do n't think vikings had a name for `` city '' so that 's just he word they used for it . 
  in modern swedish g\u00e5rd means big farmhouse or courtyard . 
  mikla is n't a word anymore , but it 's related to `` mycket '' which means `` much '' or `` very '' . 
  both , sort of . 
  it 's a bit confusing . 
  the title is `` rex vandalorum '' in latin . 
  i think when they came up with the title they did n't realise the wends and the vandals were two different things . 
  either way , it was meant both literally as `` king of wends '' ( as a justification for conquering the baltic coast ) and symbolically as `` king of vandals '' for the prestige or whatever . 
  similarly , the geats and the goths were n't really the same thing either , but the swedish kings were pretty keen on making it seem that way . 
  [ the town of andros itself ] ( http://andros.gr/images/slider/slider04.jpg ) looks nice as well , sitting on a rock in the middle of a bay with a ( ruined ) castle at the tip . 
   as to if these tribes originated in today 's germany is a different question . 
  swedish kings claimed in their titles to be king of both the goths and the vandals ( as well as the swedes ) up until 1973 , haha . 
  we even had our own name for constantinople : * miklag\u00e5rd *, 
  to add on to what people have already said about it moving . 
  the reason it moves relatively slowly is because the wind direction is not always the same . 
  that 's not really runes . 
  just another alphabet :p [ a lot of ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/old_italic_script ) old [ alphabets ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/phoenician_alphabet ) around [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iberian_scripts ) look [ similar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/old_turkic_alphabet ) to that . 
  not just [ runes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/runes ) , which are specifically the alphabets of the old germanic languages . 
  but the fact that you had your own alphabet is a fun fact nevertheless , did n't know that . 
   you probably would n't mind if i uploaded ss songs in different languages just because this subreddit is also used by all kinds far right users , right ? 
  you do n't understand what i just said . 
  the song is used by social democrats too . 
  if the ss song is used by normal right-wing people too then yes , i would probably argue that it 's alright . 
  it 's used by all kinds of socialists , not just communists . 
  including social democrats . 
  could be winter . 
  but the bushes are green so it 's probably summer . 
  i like how it is spelled different in the scandinavian languages , it is pronounced exactly the same way . 
   \u015f\u00fck\u00fcr means something like gratitude . 
  thanks is `` shukran '' in arabic , i think . 
  do n't know how turkish letters are pronounced , but seems related . 
   being christian is a question that obviously has a us bias . 
  in the eu only 51 % believes in the existance of god . 
  that basically represents the sum of all religions ( christians , muslims , jews , ... ) . 
  my dad considers himself christian , but he says he does n't believe in god . 
  basically he support the church , think they are doing good things and spreading a good message , but he does n't believe in their stories . 
  and regardless of that , a lot of people here are just `` culturally christian '' , they are baptised , do their confirmation , get married , have funerals , and so on . 
  in that case it 's about tradition , not belief . 
  depending on what way you look at it there are a lot more than 18 % christians in sweden .
