  the border is at the [ water divide ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/baltic_drainage_basins_ ( catchment_area \\ ) . svg/2000px-baltic _ drainage_basins _ ( catchment_area \\ ) . svg.png ) ( mostly ) , which is roughly in the middle of the mountain range . 
  the forest 's edge is at the bottom of the mountains ( ish ) , so it 's still pretty far to the border from there . 
  you can even see it on [ google maps ] ( https://www.google.se/maps/@66.9482469,16.664719,306149m/data=!3m1!1e3?hl=en ) . 
   from what i can tell it 's a common stereotype for people living in national capitals in quite a few countries , and occasionally even regional capitals . 
  definitely true in sweden . 
  both about stockholm and the different provincial `` capitals '' . 
   no gulf stream means canadian weather . 
  not really , the atlantic is still there , it will continue moderating the climate , just not as much . 
  admittedly we do n't know exactly how much weather patterns would change if the gulf stream fucks off , but not enough that we would get canadian ( or siberian ) weather at least . 
  i would guess that it would be more similar to the north american west coast . 
  ( but less rain , because we do n't have a huge ass mountain range along our entire coast ), 
  zlatan then notch are 2nd and 3rd , could have been either of those too tbh . 
  so you should n't feel that stupid . 
  h&m have a ton of followers too , but that does n't really count as a swedish account i guess . 
  top 3 for sweden : 1 . pewdiepie 2 . 
  notch nothing that embarrassing to be honest , so that 's nice . 
  because unlike you they do n't think she has obvious mental health issues . 
  i personally do n't know enough about her to say . 
   am i the only european here who likes president trump more than any european leader right now ? 
  that is very likely . 
  most people do n't want people with obvious mental health issues ruling their country . 
  i think . 
  that 's why you also have to drink at least a few beers per day , to slow you down . 
  right ? 
  i guess that 's also why you slur every word . 
  one is 2000 years older than the other though . 
   but those few who `` slipped '' and got a child do n't seem to regret it , they actually seem to quite enjoy it . 
  do n't have much choice do they . 
  i was really thinking we were going to get some actual winter now last weekend or whenever it got a bit cold . 
  but nope , back to this in just a day or two ... 
  i think czechia is a good name , very straight forward , a sort of latin version of czech-land . 
  but being able to call you guys b\u00f6hmen and m\u00e4hren again in swedish ( and german obviously ) would be great . 
  both are really cool names imo , they do sound a bit silly to most people i think , but only in an old fashioned kind of way . 
   czechia is just some new strange word , which makes no sense . 
  you guys have always been called that ( or things very similar to that , like tschechien or tjeckien ) in many languages . 
  english was the weird one who only had the long official-looking form with `` the czech republic '' . 
  adding - ia to the end of the name of the people to create a country name is fairly normal in english . 
  it originally comes from latin i think , but it 's still a normal thing to do in english . 
  - ien does the same thing in swedish , and i 'm pretty sure german as well . 
  add - ia to pretty much anything in english and it will sound like the name of a country . 
  nah , [ much nicer weather here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/udoafds.jpg ) , +7 right now as well ... the foggy picture was taken earlier this week , just did n't upload it immediately . 
  they 're not wrong though . 
  ca n't blame them for the actual weather , haha .

  no real meteorologist would claim to be able to predict the weather more than a few days ahead . 
  unlucky weather patterns . 
  we have had western winds blowing in here almost all winter with warm atlantic air . 
  i do n't mind it so much as long as it 's not constantly like this . 
  we have had some slightly colder clear days too , which where beautiful despite the lack of snow . 
  at least the days are getting longer again now , lack of daylight is the real killer for me . 
  gothenburg actually has had problems with smog ( ish ) . 
  since the city consists of a series of valleys , with heavily trafficked roads at the bottom the pollution tends to gather there . 
  this is just normal fog though . 
  ( and yes , i know you 're a troll ), 
  fid n't go below +5 tonight here . 
  had +10 around new year . 
  really crazy . 
  think it 's a bit extreme here on the west coast though , the further east you go the colder/more normal it get .

  we have had snow , once in november , and twice in january , but the day after it 's been at least +5 degrees , so it melted away very quickly . 
   and please do not give me `` to the baks '' speech ... well , a lot of it is to the banks . 
   how did we let our governments do this shit ? 
  so they could earn more money in the long term . 
  for example : you borrow money and invest it into something that will turn a profit in the future . 
  as long as that profit is greater than the interest on the loan you will have made more money than if you did n't take the loan . 
  similar thing can be said about houses too ( as another example ) , you can buy a house right now , and while you do have to pay the interest on the loan , that might be worth it instead of being homeless for 20 years before you can afford it . 
  governments do similar things , sometimes it 's better to spend money right now so we can get the benefit from the spending right now , than waiting several years before we eventually saved up enough . 
  of course this only works if your government uses their money properly . 
  but the loans themselves are not a problem . 
  other way around really , having no loans at all mostly means you 're not using your money as efficiently as you could . 
  yes , i 'm not sure if it 's still autumn or if spring has started early at this point . 
  at least medical marijuana is legal here . 
  just is n't prescribed much . 
   what does it mean for it to be decriminalised ? 
  very simply : you do n't get put in jail for consuming it/possession . 
  might still get fines and that sort of stuff though . 
  compare a speeding ticket to theft , for example . 
  i dunno , in spain i think ... 
  military deaths in ww2 : russia : 8-11 million germany : 4-5 million china : 3-4 million japan : ~ 2 million us : ~ 400 000 uk : ~ 400 000 meanwhile poland probably got the worst off on the civilian side , loosing almost 20 % of their population . 
  it says `` fr\u00e5n 324 000 kr '' on volvo 's webpage here in sweden . 
  that 's ~ 34 000 $ . 
  http://www.lada.ru/en/ http://gazgroup.ru/en/ http://www.uaz.ru/en/ i mean they do n't compete much in the rest of europe , but they probably do within russia . 
  i did n't realise how big the region was when i wrote the first sentence , did n't think it included that much land up north around norrt\u00e4lje . 
  but also what allan said , both of those pictures could be more or less inside a city here , they can be very spread out with chunks of nature inbetween different suburbs and so on . 
  if you look around stockholm on a map you 'll see plenty of forests surrounding the suburbs that are sort of snaking out from the city centre . 
  and archipelagos are a bit hard to measure area-wise . 
  should probably only count the land when talking about population density , but if talking about the area of a region including the water might be a good idea . 
   meanwhile , south-holland has a population density of 1300km2 , and half of it looks like this to be fair , more than half of stockholm county looks [ like this ] ( https://www.google.se/maps/@59.6502804,18.4816894,3a,60y,155.79h,86.8t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1su6tfyy_yyc-5ewrf_d21cg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en ) or [ this ] ( https://www.google.se/maps/@59.438016,18.77585,3a,75y,74.49h,88.06t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1s-w9bwpdz3hzg%2fufpwxlg7koi%2faaaaaaaaiow%2f7haftzzj7fk3lxzpzkvjdfp9bfzl96llgcjkc!2e4!3e11!6s%2f%2flh4.googleusercontent.com%2f-w9bwpdz3hzg%2fufpwxlg7koi%2faaaaaaaaiow%2f7haftzzj7fk3lxzpzkvjdfp9bfzl96llgcjkc%2fw203-h100-k-no-pi0-ya253.5-ro-0-fo100%2f!7i6000!8i3000?hl=en ), 
  yep , the stockholm region has 346/m ^ 2 and that is almost all a city . 
  sk\u00e5ne is the second densest with 120 , that has plenty of nature and farms and stuff though . 
  territorial waters or something , not sure why they are n't shown in the rest of europe ( except croatia ) . 
  you can see the actual land borders in grey inside the coloured zones actually . 
   my city river is nice enough not to have floods that would need getting stuff built yet, 
  i remember one town in tuscany having those sort of towers in assassins creed 2 . 
  did n't known they looked like that for real , thought they exaggerated a bit in the game . 
  actually ( googled it ) , the town [ in game ] ( http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/assassinscreed/images/6/6e/sangimignanophoto.png/revision/latest?cb=20120127061153 ) exists [ irl ] ( http://www.sangimignano.com/sangimignano-tuscany/homepage/0001.jpg ) too . 
  according to standard swedish stereotypes , we should mark more or less all of finland as : `` get stabbed '', 
  etna looks pretty cool . 
  more likely that he did the whole thing as a 2d map first , in a map app ( what tvrtko was talking about ) , then imported that into a 3d app to make it look nice .
