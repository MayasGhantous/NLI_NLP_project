  since ww2 still is a main topic , but we were n't actually involved in the war itself , the little we did do is discussed quite a lot , and especially our close connection with germany is emphasised . 
   especially if the wage is below the official minimum wage . 
  the minimum wage here is determined by collective bargaining in each sector , in this case between the armed forces and the defence union . 
  i 'm not sure if that is actually how it 's decided on in this case , probably not . 
  but anyway , `` below minimum wage '' is n't a simple concept over here . 
  also you do n't actually have many expenses while you 're conscripted , housing and food and everything is paid for , so a `` normal '' wage on top of that would be a lot of money . 
  also , people are not forced to do military service in practice , at least not yet . 
  it will probably work similarly to how it used to 10 years ago before they abolished it , if you just tell them you do n't want to do it you do n't have to ( they will probably try to convince you if you are otherwise a good fit , though . 
  but you can mask that too . 
  i did n't even get called into evaluation for example ) . 
  they do however have the legal means to force people to do it if necessary , it 's just unlikely to happen as long as we stay at peace . 
  but i agree to some extent . 
  the general idea behind this is n't bad , to keep a big reserve force in case something happens . 
  they should have just not built it on top of the old mandatory system , remake it as completely voluntary instead . 
  even if there is n't a difference in practice you should do it right from the bottom up . 
  the current military education we have is aimed completely towards becoming a professional afterwards ( which often involves stationing in some other country ) . 
  they should just add another voluntary program that is aimed at just the reserve forces instead . 
  eh , the war was pretty shitty for us to ( just nowhere near the levels of the rest of europe ) . 
  what we actually made some money out of was the rebuilding of europe after the war , since our country was mostly intact . 
  and the same could be said for your lovely country . 
  if you did n't want to you never was drafted before they changed it either . 
  probably the main reason they got rid of it , there were more people wanting to do it than they had space for . 
  so would n't really have mattered . 
  do n't think it 's slavery as long as they get paid . 
  checkia is how i think most people say it . 
  the spelling is a bit of a problem , but it 's not worse than `` the czech republic '' . 
  it sounds natural to me , but probably only because i 'm used to `` tjeckien '' in swedish ( - ien is our equivalent to - ia in many other languages ) . 
  is n't the new name exactly the same thing as how you guys say '' \u010cesko '' instead of '' \u010cesk\u00e1 republika '' ? 
  finland was n't a colony of sweden , it had exactly the same rights and laws as what is now mainland sweden ( back then finland * was * mainland sweden too ) , the university in \u00c5bo / turku was the 3rd in the swedish empire , after uppsala and tallinn . 
  there should n't have been any real difference between sweden and finland back then . 
  the big difference comes from the russian times and the struggles for independence as late as ww2 . 
  finland was always a bit `` behind '' the other nordic countries up until the 90s or so ( i think ) . 
  it 's also very similar to the swedish system . 
  but we have shit pisa rankings . 
  have n't high up people talked a lot about how if our countries ever are to join nato we would do it together ? 
  [ or a few others ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/viking_expansion.svg/2000px-viking_expansion.svg.png ), 
  you could probably mobilise some [ snapphanar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/snapphane ) too . 
  also a question of how you measure `` success '' . 
  i 'm pretty sure record sales are a lot lower now than they used to be . 
  services like spotify and youtube makes it impossible to compare with older artists . 
  and radio has always been around to make it harder . 
  [ here , have some abba ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xejlohdbvee ), 
   the most successful musician in sweden is max martin , but since he only writes songs it might not count for your list ? 
  abba has insane numbers of records sold , i do n't think he beats them that way . 
  he may have written more `` hits '' but that 's not everything . 
  ( also , it 's not fair comparing them , writing the music is n't all there is to selling music )  abba 's record sales figure is uncertain and various estimates range from over 380 to over 500 million sold records . 
  u2 in ireland , bj\u00f6rk in iceland . 
  but yeah , that 's about it . 
  language is the problem . 
  the most well known swedish artists sings in english , like abba , that 's the only reason people in the uk knows about them . 
  we have some music that is almost as well known as abba here in sweden , but they sing in swedish instead , and no one else knows about them . 
  [ gyllene tider for example ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_cdayydf50 ) , and then the singer starts a new band with another swedish artist , singing in english , and [ suddenly you 're interested ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llvi7znifli ) . 
   on the land that they 've inhabited way longer than the norwegians . 
  we 've killed them off before . 
  the few we have in scandinavia right now have just been there for a few years . 
  and what pbostrom said , 10 000 years ago or so the entire country was covered by the polar ice cap , humans and wolves probably settled the area at about the same rate after the ice withdrew . 
  when i was in istria , as soon as the water was n't perfectly clear they blamed it on `` shit from italy '' . 
  there are fish in the baltic too . 
  just not on the seafloor in the dead zones . 
  it 's never right up to the shore either , since the water mixes there and gets oxygenated . 
  [ dead zones in the baltic ] ( http://www.balticnest.org/images/18.3186f824143d05551ad53be/1396349219948/fig+hypoxic+area_2012.jpg ) that 's areas where the water lacks oxygen to support life . 
  have seen a good worldwide map for comparison , but ca n't find it now . 
  best one i could google up is [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/aquatic_dead_zones.jpg ) . 
  anyway , this sea is fucked up . 
   you must be gravely mistaken if you think anyone cares about finland , or any country except their own for that matter . 
  sweden cares about finland . 
  i ca n't say for certain what would happen , but there are definitely a lot of swedes that would want us to help them . 
  we helped them during the winter war , admittedly not as much as we could have . 
  but the situation was pretty different back then , might be a lot of hindsight , but our own flanks were n't exactly secured ( uhm , germany ) . 
  but if a russian invasion was to happen today , finland would basically be our defence too , so it makes sense for us to help them , not just from a political/emotional standpoint . 
  but who knows , we ca n't predict the future . 
  something like nato but only in europe would be a good idea imo . 
  but not sure about an actual combined army , might work in the future , but we got to start easy and work our way up towards that , not just plunge into it . 
  a necessary evil = / = inherently bad i agree that we need a military , mostly to stop other countries from thinking about invading us . 
  so they are * good * for that . 
  but other than being a deterrent , most of the things they are supposed to do is really not something i want anyone to do , if it 's at all avoidable . 
  i can still think that we need a military , without thinking that what they are doing is morally * good * , it 's just necessary . 
  that 's the difference between them and the police , teachers , firemen and so on . 
  pretty much nothing of what police , teachers or firemen are supposed to do is something i consider `` morally wrong '' , but fighting a war is . 
  but again , that does n't mean that i think the military is of no use . 
  we also share the baltic sea with russia , so not so sure how friendly all our neighbours are . 
  where do you live that has so terribly unfriendly neighbours ? 
  we do n't like war , and that 's what the military represents . 
  ( in fact , war is pretty much the worst thing ever , only beaten by genocide , that i can think of ) and we have n't actually used our military much for the last 200 years , so we do n't have any sort of `` grateful '' feeling or whatever towards them because they saved our country or something . 
  and a lot of people who dislike the military believe we do n't actually need them , and that a war anywhere near sweden is n't likely at all . 
  although opinions on that has changed quite a lot lately , mostly because of russia 's actions in crimea . 
  either way , it 's just another job , maybe one that is needed , but not something to be admired . 
  sort of like politicians , we do n't exactly like them either , although we do need them . 
  a necessary evil , as they say . 
  whenever americans go `` thank you for your service '' and all that shit around soldiers i get seriously creeped out btw , i just do n't understand how you look up to them as something good . 
  what continent are you on then ? 
  asia ? 
  which ones ? 
  what are the meanings behind those names ? 
  it does n't classify the language as `` proto-germanic '' , it 's just their names of weekdays has a proto-germanic origin , they copied them off the scandinavian languages , just like finnish . 
  just like how we have lots of words in swedish with french origin , that does n't make our language a romance language . 
  and oden and wotan is the same thing . 
  the god was called odin/oden in the northern varieties of germanic paganism , but he was wotan/woden or some other variants in the south . 
  the `` original '' proto-germanic deity was called something similar to that too , oden is a later version . 
  we do n't hate our country .
