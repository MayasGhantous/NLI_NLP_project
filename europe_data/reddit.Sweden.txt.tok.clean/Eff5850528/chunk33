  not saying that is a solution for everyone though . 
  you can always avoid those sort of problems by having two different accounts . 
  yeah because clearly all the kids nowadays growing up without getting hit become horrible adults . 
   why bother at all then ? 
  because it 's nice having an animal to keep you company and cuddle with . 
  but it 's also nice not being forced to spend a lot of time on them if you ca n't , they 'll still be there when you 're less busy/tired . 
  because it 's nice having an animal to keep you company . 
  but unlike a dog they do it only when they want to ( although they usually want to , but depends on the cat ) , not when you tell them to . 
  and again , you do n't have to do much else than feeding it , depending on how you live . 
  a dog you have to take care of , and they are more or less ( ideally ) your servant , doing exactly what you tell them to , and not much else . 
  cats are basically just a random animal that happens to like living with you . 
  you will have a hard time forcing them to do anything , and you do n't really have to take care of them much at all , they can handle themselves . 
  they feel like they have much more free will than a dog does . 
  so it depends on what you want your pet to be like . 
  also , dogs can smell pretty bad . 
  maybe i 'm just used to them , but cats feels like much cleaner animals . 
  cats are also good for killing mice , admittedly not very important for most people nowadays , but it is actually one reason why my parents always had a cat . 
   i was pickpocketed twice in 2 months when i lived in sweden i 've never been pickpocketed in the 26 years i 've lived in sweden . 
  if everyone expects everyone else to be honest , people are a lot more honest . 
  sure , it can hurt when some dishonest person comes along and ruins it for everyone . 
  but on the whole it works pretty well . 
   where stuff like this has become acceptable for the government to do . 
  making it illegal to hit children ? 
  i think it 's the other way around . 
  one of the biggest reasons we have `` low corruption '' and well functioning governments ( leading to good economies and high living standards and stuff ) is that we are so trusting in each other . 
  if everyone expects you to be honest you better be if you want to be accepted in society . 
  if no one expects you to be like that then you can get by without it a lot of the time . 
   i wonder why the nordics tend to say that most people can be trusted i think it 's a pretty deep rooted cultural thing , very old . 
  so do n't think we really know any specific reason . 
   we would need to work out whether it will be financially viable . 
  just dealing with the erosion problems on something this large would cost too much , let alone getting the material to build the dikes and stuff from who knows where . 
  and we really do n't get much out of it , some farmland mostly , it 's never going to repay itself . 
  i doubt the financial gains from this would even cover the maintenance costs . 
   this barrier mechanism will also protect coastal ecosystems from being inundated by sea level rise . 
  instead it would clog up with sediments from the huge rivers running into the small channels you 've made with nowhere to go , requiring constant dredging on a massive scale . 
  sweden used to ( ? ), 
  have our own roma , but not sure what happened to them in the last 50 years , at least i have never really seen or heard about them ? 
  my grandma has talked about them from when she was younger , and i know that we have a surprising amount of romani loanwords in our language . 
  so they must have been seen more back in the day . 
  the only ones we get nowadays ( as far as most people notice ) is romanian and bulgarian migrants begging in the street , which has only been going on for 5 or so years . 
  they live in small tent camps and stuff like that , but it 's all much more temporary here than in the balkans for example . 
  i 'm also not sure if all of them actually are romani ? 
  we just assume that . 
  anyway , if people associate romani with the beggars i doubt they have a very positive opinion of them , but apparently that 's not what most people think about , looking at our results in the poll . 
  also overall we have a very strong attitude that we should only be interfering with our kids personal affairs as little as possible . 
  if they get in a relationship the parents do n't like they mostly have to deal with it , do n't interfere unless it 's actually important . 
  i think that is the main reason why we score really high in all these polls . 
  also possibly something about individualism , the specific person matters much more than what religion or ethnic group they belong to . 
  but do n't see any particular reason we would think more like that than other countries . 
  nice spam there . 
  but yeah , you should probably open your eyes . 
  for real , it 's been going on since the 1200s or something . 
  [ been going for a while ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/1emc97/is_it_true_that_sweden_and_denmark_is_the_two/ ), 
   that heavy cavalry is quite good against it . 
  [ apparently not ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_caucasus_mountain ) is n't heavy cavalry and massed infantry exactly what it 's good against ? 
  you can just tire the heavy cavalry by making them chase you and then surround them when they no longer have their infantry support . 
  i think each thing in game of thrones have many historical inspirations . 
  the whole `` king in the north '' thing , with him riding south and all that seems very inspired by [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gustavus_adolphus_of_sweden ) and [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charles_xii_of_sweden ) guy , at least to me ( gustav was even called `` the lion of the north '' , haha ) . 
  but i bet there are tons of other similar figures in european history it could be applied to . 
   why have there been so much westward invasion over the eurasian steppe or that general area ? 
  off the top of my head the huns , hungarians , turks and mongols ? 
  steppe people were really good at fighting , so when someone managed to unite them they could easily go kill anyone . 
  more or less . 
  why they would be uniting and leaving their homes can have many reasons , climate change being a likely one , but probably combined with other factors . 
  in the show they basically behave like a mindless horde though . 
  irl mongols were way more organised and disciplined than at least their european enemies . 
  they used advanced siege engines , even on battlefields , and had some pretty intense tactics , like feigned charges and retreats . 
  they won a lot of their battles by staying away from their enemies and peppering them with arrows until they were completely disorganised , not just charging into shield walls like they do in the show . 
  i did . 
  i do n't think federalising right now would help , it would create more problems than it would solve . 
  and if we federalise i think we should break down the current country divisions we have right now into smaller blocks that are more uniform and easily managed . 
  but that is clearly not something that is possible any time soon . 
  trying to form a federation between such ridiculously nationalistic countries as the ones in the eu is not going to go well . 
  it has been called iran for over 2000 years . 
  it 's only we europeans who changed what we call it recently . 
  if you find one that can tolerate colder temperatures , please send it to the baltic . 
  i think making the rivers a bit bigger and reducing how many you show on the map would make it look better . 
  just pick a few of the biggest ones and show them very clearly . 
  donau barely exist on this , and po connects to the sea both ways . 
  and it 's questionable if some of the mountains should really be considered mountains and not just hills . 
  but cool looking map either way . 
  you can always come here and enjoy the [ swedish summer ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ayvaw69.png ) ... 
  [ some warmth would be nice though ... ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ayvaw69.png ) / sweden, 
   and resulted in the defeat of a small swedish squadron hurray, 
  [ example of the swedish navy doing some work ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_svensksund ) . 
  how much has the polish navy accomplished exactly ? 
  yeah , very similar to that . 
  how do you sink a polish battleship ? 
  put it in water . 
  i just went [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/earthporn/top/ ) , and they are 11th and 19th . 
  check the upvotes . 
  and the swiss one does n't show up on search because it only says `` swiss '' in the title , not `` switzerland '' . 
  checking a bit more , [ this is actually finlands most upvoted one ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/earthporn/comments/5o7wx8/aurora_over_finnish_lapland_new_years_eve_oc/ ) , you missed that for the same reason as the swiss one . 
  there are probably others too . 
  edit : [ slovenia ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/earthporn/comments/42w3bx/the_incredible_slovenian_alps_1920x1034_by_luka/ ) too :p do n't worry too much about it though , it 's mostly because of reddits search engine , not really your fault , haha . 
  sorry , was n't clear enough . 
  from what i can see the two i posted are the actual top posts for those countries , not the ones you have used . 
  going hiking in the mountains or sailing on the west coast is n't the same as going to stockholm . 
  as an example . 
  [ switzerland ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/earthporn/comments/6a2531/my_brother_is_backpacking_in_the_swiss_alps_and/ ) [ iceland ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/earthporn/comments/67lsob/i_rarely_get_lucky_with_nice_sunsets_while/ ) i think , just looking through the top of the all time top posts over there .
