  so it 's a bit of both . 
  it 's 11ish $ in sweden . 
  we do have minimum wages in practice , they just vary for different fields of work . 
  the unions control all that stuff through their agreements , we just do n't have any legislation for it . 
  edited my post to make it more clear . 
  do you have a fixed tax rate or something in bosnia ? 
  only the employer taxes . 
  how much taxes you pay on top of your salary varies depending on a lot of things . 
  i think the effective minimum wage for most jobs in sweden is somewhere around 11 $ . 
   saves us having to annex germany . 
  we can always do that later , it will be like the good old days with the finnbros . 
  i mean it 's definitely not the worst , but i think if there was no traditional usage it would be considered pretty `` hard '' . 
   also , expelling all those people will require lots of planes  you also have to find some other country that will accept them . 
  i was under the impression that is the biggest hurdle to deporting people ? 
  and not something we can actually do much about . 
   the degree of urbanization is an important factor , do n't you think ? 
  [ here 's a thing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/urbanization_by_country ) . 
  i know you 're in j\u00e4mtland , so might not seem that way , but most swedes live in cities down south . 
  there is at the very least not a very big difference in that regard compared to denmark . 
  their cities are just closer together , the percent of people living in cities in each country is about the same . 
  you should probably use [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/coat_of_arms_of_sweden.svg ) instead for sweden . 
  that is what all the government offices , police , and other stuff uses . 
  even something as simple as [ this ] ( http://skylto.se/content/uploads/tpl//tre-kronor-thumbnail3-300x300.png ) is used in some cases too , [ like on military aircraft ] ( http://www.airshows.co.uk/features/2013/nordic-airpower/photos/nordic-airpower-04.jpg ) , or our [ hockey team ] ( http://www.swedishpress.com/sites/default/files/styles/article-detail/public/articles/sweden-600x350.jpg?itok=un2w2fmu ) ( the national hockey team are commonly just called `` three crowns '' in swedish ) anyway , the three crowns is a very common symbol here , and the first one i linked is the official lesser coat of arms used everywhere , so it would n't even be wrong using it . 
  you used the greater coat of arms which i 'm not even sure if it 's ever used except by things related to the monarchy ( the little thing in the middle represents the current ruling family , bernadotte ) . 
  yes , the swedish king was king in norway too , so he ruled over both . 
  but both countries had separate parliaments and everything , and even though there was n't universal democracy back then the parliaments still had most of the power ( i believe , at least ) . 
   indeed , copenhagen is significantly bigger than stockholm . 
  not significantly , and not at all by most comparable measurements ( urban or metro area for example ) . 
  i was not talking about municipalities here , i believe the numbers changes a bit if you want to measure it that way . 
  ( nvm , they do n't , all are within the city centre , it 's still an irrelevant comparison of population though )  impressive since \u00c5rhus is the size of malm\u00f6 . 
  why is gothenburg so low in this context ? 
  it 's not , it 's \u00c5rhus that is ( relatively ) high . 
  helsinki is at 25 if you want another comparison . 
   remember that denmark is much more densely populated . 
  in denmark you 're never moren than 20 km from a city . 
  and how is that related to the absolute number of restaurants ? 
   almost 5 million , in fact . 
  denmark 's got slightly above 5 million and sweden 10 . 
  they have are on 5,7 million . 
   or if he did , it was an awful low-alcohol version . 
  3,5 % , to be exact . 
   i do not know how large a percentage of the alcohol consumed in malm\u00f6 are bought in denmark , but i would not be surprised if it is more than 50 % not any more i do n't think , there 's no real price difference at the moment . 
  what you do is you drive to germany and bulk up . 
   how many do you have in , say , bornholm ? 
  they have two michelin starred restaurants on bornholm . 
  there 's just one in all of norrland . 
  20 in aarhus , comparable to gothenburg . 
  then a few others spread over the country , more than sweden outside of the big cities . 
  and keep in mind we are 4 million more people than them . 
   ruled norway until very recently ( 1880 maybe ? ), 
  1814-1905  at its largest its empire had norway finland greenland estonia and down into what 's now poland and eastern germany i think . 
  not norway and greenland . 
  sweden , finland , russian baltic coast , estonia , about half of latvia , and a few chunks of northern germany . 
  it also was n't an empire really , that 's just something it 's called in english for some reason . 
  sweden did occupy most of poland and like half of germany and stuff like that , but those areas were never `` legally '' taken by sweden , only occupied during wars . 
  one of the most famous swedish battles were near [ poltava ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_poltava ) which is in modern day ukraine , for example , so the armies went pretty far . 
  ( also yet another lesson about not invading russia in winter and blah blah blah ), 
  no , what they got ta do is marry their future heir , i think it 's a boy one step down the line , to the future heir of sweden , which is a girl , like 7 years younger i think , so totally doable . 
  then work out a deal with norway as well somehow , i dunno . 
  then we can go for a kalmar union 2.0 . 
  actually , norway also has a girl heir in a similar age , so the danish heir 's brother or something got ta marry one of them , have kids , then they kill the kid off or something and claim the throne . 
  not sure if that works ... 
   but ... why ? 
  coincidence no one sat down and decided they were going to do it differently than the other , they just sort of developed that way for a probably very large number of random reasons . 
  i just want us to use [ the three crowns ] ( http://skylto.se/content/uploads/tpl//tre-kronor-thumbnail3-300x300.png ) instead . 
  exactly how they would be designed i 'm not sure , but just a blue background with the three yellow crowns either in the middle or the corner would look great . 
  not that that is related to the eu in any way , but i do n't see why the national flags would ever need to be . 
  it 's better if we just use the already great looking eu flag more instead , and make the national flags more like regional flags . 
  [ statoil ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/logo_statoil.png ), 
   according to my spellings checker `` grey '' is not an english word . 
  fuck you spellings checker . 
  * gray * in american english , * grey * in british english . 
  i think in a lot of cases the defenders even burned down the town themselves before the attacker could get there . 
  it 's a big enough lake to not flood from meltwater or stuff like that , there 's no significant inflow from mountains or anything , it 's mostly just what rains in the local area . 
  but of course with extreme rainfall the lake could still flood the city . 
  and since it 's a lake there is no risk of storm floods or that sort of thing . 
  looks like any finnish or swedish industrial town to me . 
  only a few older towns have city centres that does not look like this . 
  you can also not see most of the city , [ it 's either behind the camera or hidden in the forest ] ( https://www.google.se/maps/@61.8683199,28.8811713,7162m/data=!3m1!1e3?hl=sv ) . 
  there 's nothing connecting all of asia together other than the name of the continent , which they may or may not even count as a continent ( i do n't know ) . 
  this is also an american/english speaking website . 
  so it 's the same as everything else like that , english native speakers and smaller countries which do n't have many websites in their own languages ( like most european countries ) dominate here . 
  russia , china , india , japan and so on all have their own websites in their own languages . 
  that 's why their respective subreddits are relatively small , and the people that go there are usually expats . 
  that 's also why for example nordic countries are disproportionately represented here , we have very high internet usage and very many english speakers , while not having large enough population on our own to create our own corner on the internet . 
  in the case of china reddit might also be blocked . 
  temperature does n't matter , it 's mostly about how high in the sky the sun is ( how much atmosphere it has to pass through before reaching you ) . 
  reflections from water or snow or stuff like that makes it worse too . 
  so the beach is especially deadly . 
  [ yeah , we totally only have a few large islands ... ] ( https://www.google.se/maps/@60.3411331,21.4267652,27498m/data=!3m1!1e3?hl=en ) our islands and bays/peninsulas are * too * small , they do n't show up on your data . 
  there 's no way sweden and finland are the same or shorter than germany or estonia for example . 
  [ look at that list ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_length_of_coastline ) on finland and sweden from the two different sources . 
  finland goes from ~ 1000km to 31000km . 
  and then go look [ at a map ] ( https://www.google.se/maps/@60.346687,26.0738664,10.64z?hl=en ) of the countries and think which seems more accurate ? 
  the lower of these two datasets ( which i think is the one used for the maps ) must be really low resolution , because the distance written for sweden and finland is basically what it would be if you assumed our entire coastlines were straight . 
  for real , i just did a quick measure distance thing on google maps with like ten points along the finnish coast , and i came close to the number used on the map . 
  that might be true , i 'm not very good with tectonics . 
  but there are still faults , otherwise there would n't be earthquakes . 
  they might just be deeper than normal . 
  and there are certainly something interesting going on in that particular area since there is so many earthquakes outside of an active plate boundary .
