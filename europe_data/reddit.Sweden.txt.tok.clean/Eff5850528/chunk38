  i do n't think i 'm a big fan of macron , but when paired up against trump i 'm suddenly feeling all fanboyish , fuck that guy . 
  i know that kind of hostility/hate/whatever is n't really good , but at the same time , fucking hell , ca n't the americans just get rid of him somehow ? 
  the usual political discord suddenly feels like nothing compared to the idiocy of his presidency . 
  sorry , not really relevant to the picture at all , just venting a bit . 
  paris or london would probably be around the 7th largest economy in the eu , somewhere between sweden and the netherlands . 
  yeah , you better watch out . 
  very nice map , but not knowing cyrillic or most names of the russian regions it 's a bit hard to translate this into a geographical map , i would especially like to know where the urals would be on this ? 
  i can see tatarstan , so i know it 's east of that , but how much ? 
  out on the sea or inside their houses . 
  no reason to run around on the streets in the evening . 
  but it looks like there are christmas lights on that bush , so it 's probably around 3 in the afternoon judging by the light , they are probably at work . 
   it was ruled for a very long time by sweden ( until at least 18th century , possibly even 19th ? ), 
  but despite that only some coastal parts ended up with majority swedish speaking populations , which have probably mostly gone away by now . 
  speaking of which , finland owns some nearby island ( forgot the name , but maybe ` smaland ' ) populated by swedes . 
  swedish speakers where at around 15 % of the population in the early 19th century ( when russia took over ) , it has now dropped to around 5 % . 
  [ map of the language situation in finland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish-speaking_population_of_finland#/media/file:languages_of_finnish_municipalities_\\ ( 2016 \\ ) . svg ) the island is called \u00c5land . 
  sm\u00e5land is a swedish province . 
  \u00c5 = river . 
  sm\u00e5 = small . 
  ( not sure if it actually was river-land originally , but whatever ), 
   what is it with that sentence ? 
  you know how when you 're on the toilet shitting , if you have something near the toilet to read , you 're probably going to read it . 
  if that happens to be an electric radiator , which is often the case , it will have a sticker on it saying `` do not cover '' in all the nordic languages . 
  it 's on sauna heaters too . 
  cock ? 
  i think it 's about right . 
  but i really do n't know much . 
  i 'm not sure i consider that reasonable though . 
  that 's around $ 320000 for a one bedroom apartment in stockholm city centre . 
   because the government controls the parliamentary majority not necessarily . 
  [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_body_mass_index_ ( bmi \\ ) ) , referencing who from 2015/16 . 
  have n't looked up the source , assumed no one could be bothered faking the actual statistics . 
  also remember us being around there on other lists , maps and so on i 've seen around the internet . 
  [ cia too ] ( https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2228rank.html ), 
  the building is kept at -18 c. and it 's not exactly a building , it 's a cave . 
  and the water came from outside because of the warm weather , the ice was melting it was even raining , so the water made it 's way inside the entrance and froze . 
  it 's still nowhere near the actual seed storage , but apparently the vault is supposed to be fully automatic and not need any maintenance , that 's probably not the case if water can get inside . . 
  i 'm also pretty sure the norwegians on svalbard know how to build on permafrost , it 's not some closely guarded secret how it works . 
  i do n't know , have only been looking at rental apartments , ca n't afford buying one . 
  [ stockholm ] ( https://www.numbeo.com/property-investment/in/stockholm ) [ gothenburg ] ( https://www.numbeo.com/property-investment/in/gothenburg ) [ malm\u00f6 ] ( https://www.numbeo.com/property-investment/in/malmo ) not sure how accurate that is . 
  stockholm is apparently on par with new york . 
   there is alot you need to plan before you can expand new city parts . 
  as i understand it one of the biggest reasons we have a shortage in the first place is because building new buildings is extremely regulated . 
  and that 's sort of what i meant with the government not doing much , they 're not doing anything about fixing our system , just encouraging more building within the currently obviously broken system . 
   is the housing all state owned for the units on the waiting list ? 
  not really . 
  but i do n't know how it works everywhere . 
  in gothenburg more or less all first hand contracts are applied for on the same webpage , which i 'm pretty sure is connected to the state owned companies somehow . 
  but there are private companies renting out through that system too . 
  state owned housing is n't like paid for by the state btw , they are basically just owned by the state ( kommun , to be exact ) , but receive no funding , i think , got ta handle that on their own . 
   that was frustrating enough but waiting two years would suck . 
  it 's like 5 years here now i think . 
  worse in most places in stockholm . 
  in my small hometown it might be 2 years or so depending on what you 're looking for and your situation . 
  some companies do n't really use queue time and makes you apply for it like a job instead for example , but there 's still like 1000 + applicants per apartment so good luck with that haha . 
  only reliable way to get housing is to be a student ( shorter queue times ) , sublet ( more expensive and often limited time only ) , or buy ( super expensive ) . 
  it really is fucked up , and our politicians are n't really doing anything . 
  they are all like `` yeah we 're gon na build 100 000 apartments !, 
  '' , but we need like 300 000 at least ... and they do n't seem to really be dealing with the actual problems causing the lack of new housing projects ( although i think it has gotten a bit better the last coupe of years at least ) . 
  every university student here gets the same , ~ 300 $ as subsidies + ~ 700 $ as loans , per month . 
  only thing that happens if you fail your courses is that you ca n't apply for new money for the next semester until you have passed enough stuff . 
  then there 's some stipends and stuff you can apply for for specific things like if you have to travel or you 're studying a certain thing or you come from a certain place or whatever . 
  but those are entirely separated from the normal student subsidies & loans . 
  more or less everywhere , but it 's much worse in the bigger cities . 
  if you 're 180cm tall , pretty average , you need to weigh 100kg to be obese by bmi . 
  i do n't personally know ( skinny as fuck ) , but that does n't seem that crazy , it 's your standard fat guy , not some mountain of fat . 
  and yeah , the `` lifetime of bad choices '' is just eating junk/snacks a lot of days of the week . 
  like , you can eat a normal diet otherwise , but if you add a soda and some chips/candy/whatever on top of that most days you are going to go up in weight pretty steadily . 
  i would honestly not be against something like that here . 
  easy for me to say i guess , i 'm not fat yet . 
  but i feel like if i ever stopped training i would probably get fat pretty quickly and it would be good to have an actual real check like that , not just people sort of hinting sometimes that i might need to loose a little bit of weight but maybe not really i look great . 
  a mandatory health check in general would actually be pretty good . 
  i think a lot of people have minor issues they do n't think are important enough to go to the doctor with , especially mental health stuff . 
  i 'm pretty sure sweden is at 20 something in other data , probably the same with many others down there . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/guernsey_ ( clothing ) that 's definitely where the swedish and norwegian gensare/genser comes from , in at least swedish it 's a pretty specific thing ( knitted wool ) , not just any sweater . 
  the irish might be different though , remarkable coincidence if that 's the case . 
   living on campus is more of a sleep-over done inside the school perimeter . 
  why ? 
  i 'm not sure how `` college dorms '' work in other countries , but most places here , especially for university , work like any other apartment except you might share kitchen with other people . 
  i 've also never seen any student housing actually on campus either , usually it 's spread out throughout the city . 
  in sweden you are essentially getting paid to study ( if you fail you do n't get any money ) , and you pay your bills that way . 
  so there 's no real difference between studying and having a job , except a large portion of the money you `` earn '' while studying is in loans ( they are very cheap loans though , 0,34 % interest right now ) . 
  in practice you have exactly the same responsibilities and everything as a student as you would if you were working . 
   i 'm sorry if i sounded too serious , but to me , it just seemed that you 're massively projecting your own views , or just views that are dominant in your society , on other societies and people and present these views as ` natural insticts ' . 
  that 's exactly what i did , but that 's hardly a particularly controversial argument . 
  afaik the whole what 's culture and what 's instinct thing is a pretty huge question that has been debated over and over again for ages . 
   human beings are by nature actually pack animals who later formed tribes precisely on the basis of family ties . 
  but natural instinct also made the young people in a tribe more willing to for example find mates from other tribes to prevent inbreeding . 
  i think i actually remember that from some documentary , exchange of the young between different tribes happened all the time even way back . 
  moving between different families and forming new ones inside a tribe must have been absolutely necessary at the very least , which is another thing i thought of when i talked about `` human nature '' . 
  but yeah , i 'll stop now . 
  neither of us appear to be particularly good psychologists , anthropologists , or whatever field deals with these sort of things . 
  so i think we can stop arguing , haha . 
   nordic countries are simply very individualistic and you place a huge value on independence and your government gives you money so that you 're able to reach this independence soon . 
  other countries put more value on strong family ties . 
  yes , that 's definitely the case . 
  that 's sort of why i started asking these questions to begin with , to find out how much of it is just things taught to me just by my culture . 
  definitely a lot more doubtful about it than when i started but you have n't completely convinced me :p, 
  at that point they are already established living like that , of course they are not going to move out unless it 's a really big deal . 
  it 's not as if just because people prefer living on their own means they are completely miserable when they do n't .
