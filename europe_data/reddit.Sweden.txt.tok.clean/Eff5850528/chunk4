  but a lot of us do n't like the military . 
  one is n't derived of the other , they just both have the same origin . 
  the germanic beliefs in what is now germany and the netherlands did too . 
   but a few year ago , would you have considered the current events in ukraine to be plausible ? 
  the people who had actually read up on crimea would have thought it plausible , they have had pro-russian sentiment there since independence ( or lack thereof ) . 
  but it still was n't likely to happen , so no one actually thought much about it , the way russia did it was also fairly `` innovative '' as i understand it , so that 's another reason people did n't expect it . 
  not because it was n't `` plausible '' , just unlikely with our established understanding of things . 
  i feel the same way about the baltics , people are looking at it in the wrong way , if russia does something they wo n't do it the `` expected '' way , because their enemies are prepared for that ( a bit at least ) , and it would be fairly suicidal . 
  it 's the same in all bigger cities . 
  but in sweden ( and supposedly a lot of northern europe ) it 's everywhere , even small towns or villages , and at least in my experience that is n't the case in southern europe . 
  i like it the way it is exactly because of work . 
  now i have time to both earn a decent amount of money and have some time off . 
  4 weeks is less than most people work already , doubt they would be too happy to be forced to work less . 
   in that situation , not talking to strangers is often weird or hostile . 
  is that not so in finland too ? 
  im not from finland . 
  but you do n't talk to strangers even in small towns/villages . 
  obviously if you live in a small enough place it 's a good chance that you might know the person , and then you 'll probably talk . 
  but not with strangers . 
  it 's the same thing almost everywhere , not just bus stops , you never talk with strangers unless you have a specific reason . 
  and again , it 's not that you ca n't do it , some people still do , it 's just not normal . 
  in smaller towns , at most you might say `` hi '' if you pass someone in the street/on a path or that sort of thing , but you would not start talking with them unless you knew them or actually had something to ask them or whatever . 
  keep in mind that this is mostly a northern european thing . 
  the mediterranean countries are entirely different . 
  i have n't seen anything this extreme in sweden either , but i could definitely believe it happening . 
  we primarily do this out of respect of other people , do n't want to annoy them or something like that . 
  so you would most likely get a good response if you started talking . 
  we are n't that different from you guys , it 's just the norm here not to talk to strangers or intrude on their `` personal space '' , while in the us it is the norm to do just that . 
  there are people here who want to talk just like i 'm sure there are people in the us who do n't . 
  people would think you are a bit strange though , but it 's not like they would dislike you for it , i do n't think anyway , you would just be `` that foreign guy '' . 
   not even bars or pubs ? 
  how does anyone ever get laid ? 
  it 's fine in bars . 
  but even there i think it 's a lot less common than in many other countries . 
  the norm is to meet through mutual friends or hobbies or work or that sort of thing . 
  because it 's not , not traditionally anyway . 
  some estonians want them to move towards that though , because i do n't know , prestige ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordic_countries known as * norden * ( the north ) in all scandinavian countries , and something with a similar meaning in finnish . 
  i ca n't speak for everyone living here , but i believe at least in sweden it 's the sub-region of europe most of us see ourselves as living in , it 's used much more than [ * scandinavia * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scandinavia ) ( which it is often mixed up with in english ) . 
  so yes , it is a region like the balkans for example . 
  fun fact : the swedish national anthem ends with `` jag vill leva , jag vill d\u00f6 i norden '' ( i want to live and die in the north ), 
  and most of the population in norrland lives by the coast , where it 's relatively warm . 
  there are still cities/towns inland though , even in the far north ( [ kiruna ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/kiruna_panorama.jpg ) for example ) . 
  i always saw it the other way around . 
  having * an * income compared to * no * income makes a lot of difference . 
  but if you earn * some * money or * a lot * of money does n't really matter much when happiness is concerned . 
  but there are n't any surviving speakers of most genuine swedish dialects , afaik . 
  even the old people nowadays are young enough to have grown up after they started forcing people to learn proper swedish in school . 
  yeah , but i at least have a vague idea about most dialects . 
  and i definitely know a lot about the ones around the area i grew up , and there are supposedly 3 or 4 different words there , and no * sn\u00f6 * , which is what pretty much all of them uses , just with some minor variations , like a slight diphthong or whatever on the \u00f6 , or that sort of stuff , never heard about anyone adding a v on the end at least . 
  yeah , that 's what i meant . 
  norway 's dialects are more different from each other than the swedish ones . 
  sax = scissor in swedish . 
  so saxons are literally known as `` scissors '' in swedish . 
  not sure if that is related at all , but now you know . 
  so the stereotypes are true ... 
  norway has a lot more different dialects than swedish . 
  sweden used to be more like that too , but that was over like 100 years ago , just seems odd to include those dialects on this map , they are never included anywhere else , since * literally * no one speaks like that anymore . 
  i could imagine gotland having their own one , as well as the ones up north ( do n't know anything about those areas ) . 
  but the 3 different ones in southern sweden seems odd , i grew up around there and only know about one possible dialect that could have a weird word like that ( listerl\u00e4ndska ) . 
  unless the \u00fd does n't sound anything like y and it 's just the regular scanian pronunciation of sn\u00f6 . 
  but that still leaves sn\u00f6v / sniv . 
  what 's up with all the different ones in the same language ? 
  i have n't heard that many variations in swedish . 
  https://sv.wiktionary.org/wiki/bira no idea where they got that from though . 
  same with b\u00e4rs . 
  i grew up calling danish beer pilsner . 
  did n't know it was a specific type of beer until quite late , thought it was just what danish beer was called . 
  except for * \u00f6l * , you can also say * bira * or * b\u00e4rs * in swedish . 
  according to wiktionary * bira * comes from german * bier * , and * b\u00e4rs * is a shortened version of * bayerskt \u00f6l * ( bavarian beer ) . 
  i think we win the `` most naked women '' award . 
  simple factory work , so pretty much the entire industry is situated in countries with cheap labour . 
  countries with cheap labour have a lot of children that need to work . 
  the reason these countries have so much child labour is because most of the population is incredibly poor , which means in many cases children has to work to survive . 
  there are not many other industries that rely on uneducated cheap labour to the same extent as the clothing industry . 
  and it 's a huge industry , so you hear a lot about it . 
  that 's the simple answer anyway . 
  i thought it was a really large truck driving past , haha .

  i prefer trains over anything else . 
  the only advantage cars have over trains is that you can go wherever you want whenever you want . 
  but trains are much more comfortable to travel in , and you do n't have to drive them yourselves , so you can do other stuff . 
  i also do n't mind being near a train track as much as i mind being near a road , much more frequent noise from the road . 
  and rails take up much less space than all the roads we have . 
  and you usually see more nature while travelling by train than by road . 
  why does it matter ? 
  if he 's `` born and raised in estonia '' is n't he as estonian as everyone else ? 
  does n't most `` persian '' carpets look that way ? 
  arabs , i think . 
   because of the majority of the population there being ethnic russians also because most of those russians wanted to join russia , at least on paper ( even by western surveys ) . 
  and ukraine when it happened was in a bit of a crisis , not being able to do much . 
  as long as the baltic countries remain stable there really is n't much risk of the russians in those countries causing trouble , and russia really ca n't do anything by itself , it needs to primarily be the people themselves . 
  who knows what other shit can happen though , but the same thing as in ukraine would n't be possible . 
   the city 's population is listed as 264k on wikipedia . 
  60k of which live in the actual historical city , the rest live on the mainland . 
  anyway , never said there had to necessarily be more tourists than inhabitants for it to end up that way . 
  just that the ratio mattered . 
  i think it comes down to the ratio of tourists to natives . 
  when the tourists realise they are just visitors to a place where people live and work they tend to behave like normal people . 
  when they end up in places like venice it 's easy to start thinking like the entire place is there for the tourists , like a giant museum .
