  but the reason we have become so rich is not very clear , at least not scandinavia as a whole . 
   the whole community is build around the majority of people having off sunday . 
  let 's throw that away because a few people wan na work on sunday even tho they can do that already . 
  and the other way around my whole community is built around stuff being open on sundays , so it would be stupid to throw that away because a few people do n't like working on sundays . 
   let 's not forget that there is a difference between students that have to work to be able to attend university and students that work just to have more spending money ... 
  i agree , but we pay our students enough that they should n't have to work unless they want to or have other issues . 
  figured we needed a new thirty years war , but this time under our new estonian overlords . 
   and not many are working in retail sales to begin with some do , so suddenly banning it would kinda suck . 
  i 'm sure there are other groups than students who like working on weekends too . 
  especially considering the extra pay you get compared to weekdays . 
   if you ca n't see that being green at all you should probably check your eyes . 
  then  i can see the green a bit but it 's definitely more blue . 
  then  so you 're either a little colorblind or have your monitor settings set up badly . 
  i 'm seeing the same thing you are , you 're just certain it 's blue , i 'm saying different people see it differently , which is pretty common knowledge , have you never heard about that ? 
  if you want to be specific you should call it turquoise or something like that , calling it blue is just as wrong as calling it green , since it 's in the middle of the two ( and exactly where the line is varies from person to person , and language ) . 
  but since there is n't any other green or blue on the map that hardly matters . 
  i 'm talking about having sundays available to work in shops and such . 
  since we do n't have school then a lot of us take up extra work on weekends , if shops closed on sundays a lot of us would have less opportunity to work . 
  probably you . 
  it 's right in between green and blue , could be called either , op chose green . 
  if you ca n't see that being green at all you should probably check your eyes . 
  they do n't need the money . 
  not need-need at least , i mean they are going on holidays to central america and stuff , so do n't think money is a huge problem . 
  students here get around 1000 $ combined grant and loan per month , that 's enough to live on unless you have a way too expensive apartment or something . 
   either they do n't care about the lectures and prefer the money this . 
  it 's usually the people who are doing good in school anyway that are working , the people who are just managing to pass do n't look for extra work . 
   if students want to work for extra money , we should n't have special derogation for that or use them as scapegoats for opening on sunday . 
  it 's not specifically about students , that was just an example of how it benefits some people . 
   they want extra money , they can work the same days as everyone else . 
  which they do , and that happens to include sundays here . 
  which is a preferred workday for students since they do n't have school then and it pays more than a normal weekday . 
  so taking that away would make us sad , since we would have less opportunity to work during the school year . 
  no , they are not allowed to employ you for that many days in a row , so working all week does not become the norm . 
  it does normalise working on weekends though , so in a lot of jobs you are expected to work some weekends , but then you get other days off instead . 
  working on weekends or evenings also pays better , so people who can work then without problems often wants to ( like students ) , making it not as necessary for others to do it . 
  being able to do it saturday & sunday is really nice though , especially since you get extra pay during those days ( and even more on evenings ) . 
  monday - friday we have school , some people work those days too , but they tend to miss lectures and stuff sometimes , which is n't optimal . 
  most people who work full time tend to not want to work on weekends too , so perfect opportunity for students to earn some extra money . 
   students have enough work studying and should n't have to worry about holding a job . 
  most of my classmates have extra jobs , we might not need more money , but we can still want more .

  there are usually a ton of tourists everywhere , but it should be a great place for painting . 
   this is really as typical as they can get . 
  [ sweden confirmed as communist country ] ( https://www.google.se/maps/@57.7221858,11.9294019,3a,75y,121.5h,88.67t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sepilkw4acev293xjzyynrq!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en ) seriously though , those types of houses actually look alright , even when not maintained they still have a bit of soul ( or whatever ) left , imo . 
  the [ later commieblocks ] ( https://www.google.se/maps/@57.7155838,11.9261256,3a,74.1y,159.39h,90.73t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sdszp2spl8vea1ih8kbudtw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en ) are a lot worse . 
  not exactly health spas , but i see your point . 
  they live about as well as me , a poor student . 
  but they ca n't leave , which sucks a bit i 'm guessing . 
  also worth noting that it does n't actually work worse than harsher prison environments ( some even say it works better ) . 
  which you know , is almost relevant to the original discussion . 
  it has been banned in sweden since the 70s . 
  are you saying entire generations over here have not been raised properly ? 
   i was somewhat surprised that these guys just marched to the immigration armed to the teeth , and the officers were like `` cool , can i take your photo ? '' . 
  all the people in the pictures were asked to dress up for the photo . 
  so they probably did n't travel dressed like that . 
  they are not doing too well in sweden . 
  probably because people are n't that obsessed with getting the lowest prices , it 's more important that they know what they are getting and that sort of stuff . 
  i think lidl seems a little bit foreign to most swedes . 
  netto and willys are competitors too . 
  but they follow the union rules and everything , afaik . 
  so no real problems with their workers . 
  m\u00e5rran in swedish , so your name is actually pretty close to the original . 
  can try it with minttu ( finland ) instead , sounds like the same thing , but 50 % alcohol . 
  seriously dangerous though since the peppermint masks the alcohol taste really well .

  elsa for girls , not surprisingly popular due to frozen ( i 'm guessing ? 
  ) , but it was a common name with old women here already . 
  i 'm eagerly awaiting karl-g\u00f6ran , sven-erik , per-gunnar and such getting in fashion again , haha . 
  fair enough . 
  english . 
  i share a kitchen with 8 other people , 4 of them do n't speak swedish . 
  and the teacher in my current course at uni is american , although he does speak swedish it is often easier to communicate in english . 
  i guess it gets a lot colder inland . 
  i 've only ever lived on the coast , so do n't have a complete picture . 
  sliced meat for sandwiches i think is common , but anything other than than that is not popular at all . 
  but you can still get it , have eaten whole turkey a few times . 
  we do n't have it for holidays or anything like that . 
  although i think one of the times i had it it was on a `` second '' christmas party , with friends instead of family . 
  did n't want a repeat of the traditional food i guess . 
  yeah , but `` european '' is n't just western europe . 
  i feel a lot closer to someone from the us than someone from bulgaria for example . 
   i 'd say places where people regularly throwing stones at the police & emergency crew is n't something that exists in most countries . 
  `` regularly '' ? 
  rainy and grey . 
  and obviously the police has to be more careful in certain areas , might not have the best reception from the locals . 
  but i 'm pretty sure areas like that exist more or less in almost every country . 
  imo : blekingsk  swedish  nordic/scandinavian  western ( or something like that ) european is only about geography , all the people from countries in europe are `` european '' . 
  but there is very little cultural significance about it . 
  while i could definitely talk about `` western '' culture or whatever , which would include the us , canada , australia and so on . 
  btw , i sort of secretly wish blekinge could just join up with sk\u00e5ne so i would n't have to explain to everyone i meet where blekinge is . 
  most of the time i just get to be from `` somewhere near sk\u00e5ne '' ... 
   and it 's difficult to get to and get around . 
  it 's fine if you have a car . 
  but yeah , not sure what to do there , except skiing . 
  somewhere in austria or southern germany is probably better . 
   it sounds like you do n't like when it turns dark early , why ? 
  i do n't know , i 'm human , we like daylight . 
  it would be fine if it was just a day or something , but when it 's constantly like that for months it 's not so fun . 
  a couple years back i worked in the basement of a factory during winter , no windows , not even in the break room . 
  so i went to work at 7:30 , when it was still dark .
