  and got out of work at 16:30 when it was also dark . 
  i only saw the sun on the weekends ( and only if it was n't cloudy , which it is 75 % of the time or something ) , it sucks . 
  and when it 's already cold outside nighttime has absolutely no positive qualities , obviously if it 's hot during the day it can be nice in the evening , but yeah , that 's not the case here in the winter , it just gets even colder . 
   does it ever get up to 43 degrees c ? 
  no , haha , literally never . 
  highest temperature ever recorded in sweden is 38 . 
  usually it 's around 20-24 if the weather is good . 
  maybe a couple of weeks heatwave with around 30 each summer . 
  in the south that is ( where most people live ) . 
  in the winter , for the south ( stockholm and below , generalising a lot ) it 's usually around 0 with some drops down to around -10 . 
  do n't think it ever really gets below -20 . 
  up north it can get very cold , -30 is not uncommon , coldest ever recorded was -52 . 
  it 's very dark though . 
  even here in the south you only get like 6-7 hours of daylight each day in late december , and the further north you go the worse it gets . 
  anyway , the nature here is really beautiful in summer , everything is extremely green and so on , and the weather is relatively nice most of the time , we also get back all the daylight we lost in the winter , the sun does n't set until like 22-23 at midsummer . 
  the winter is the exact opposite of all that . 
  / r/swarje we mainly talk shit about everyone else ( especially denmark ) and link to posts mentioning sweden, 
   winter is hell for people not used to scandinavia . 
  well i hate it too :(  we just have cold wind and muddy snow . 
  sounds like gothenburg . 
  lot 's of rain too . 
   mind throwing some proper snow this way this winter ? 
  supposedly this winter is going to be cold . 
  so yeah , we might actually get snow for more than a week this year , i 'll throw some in kattegat for you . 
   are swedish people in general very outdoorsy ? 
  not as much as the norwegians , but i guess still more than a lot of other places . 
   is this why this law exists ? 
  no , it 's just an old custom . 
  in most other european countries almost all the land was private and owned by someone , usually nobles . 
  but up here in the north we did n't have a very strong nobility and lots of land , so the peasants managed to keep their rights to use it . 
  i think that 's the gist of it anyway . 
   where in sweden can you find lesser known places that have nice scenery ? 
  we have lots of nature anywhere in the country , even close to the cities , so you can find nice scenery pretty much anywhere . 
  not all our nature looks nice , but we have so much of it that at least some nice scenery should never be too far off . 
   because of this law , could a random person camp out in your backyard if they wanted to ? 
  no , that is still private property . 
  they can walk through it in some circumstances though , like if you have a backyard right up to a beach , or if there is a road going through it . 
  but if you own a forest anyone can camp in it for a day or whatever it is , as long as they behave . 
   is h & m one of the most popular clothing stores in sweden ? 
  yes , probably the most popular . 
   is this term really as popular in sweden as they say ? 
  not sure what they say , but yes , it is a word we use quite a lot . 
   and what would be a proper way to use it ? 
  whenever you want to tell someone that you need `` enough but not too much '' of something , but you 're not sure yourself how much that is , so you say `` lagom '' and you will have technically answered the question without actually answering it at all , because no one knows what you mean by `` lagom '' . 
  so you shift the responsibility of knowing how much lagom is to the other person instead . 
  it 's a rubbish word really . 
   fika it just means `` coffee break '' . 
  i do n't see what the big deal is . 
   what is one piece of advice that you would give to someone visiting your country for the first time ? 
  come here in the summer . 
  winter is hell . 
   is the mjolnir considered a religious symbol in sweden ? 
  it 's a historical symbol i guess . 
  people do n't really believe in that any more , so i guess it ca n't be classified as a proper religious symbol any more . 
  but it is still the hammer of a god , so i remembered about it when `` scanning '' my memory of my parents place for religious symbols . 
  religion to the point where they feel it appropriate to decorate their living room with religious symbols is a bit creepy . 
  at least here in sweden , since that is n't something people normally do . 
  i do n't mind people going to church or praying or whatever . 
  the few younger people who are really into it is a bit weird though , but not that creepy . 
  do n't think anyone here does . 
  my parents do have a small brass cast of [ mj\u00f6lnir ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/f7/80/41/f7804134cad65159d8260821d97cfcfd.jpg ) on a shelf though . 
  but that 's only cause i made it myself in elementary school , haha . 
  speaking of these things , i do n't think we even had a bible in the house when i grew up . 
  despite having like 6 bookcases full of books . 
   and maybe i read this wrong ? 
  no you did n't . 
  does n't exactly explain what they meant with that though , or what the source for their data is . 
   okay , arable might be the wrong word then . 
  you have a lot of trees . 
  and trees do n't grow in tundras or deserts . 
  so you are able to make a lot of money selling wood while desert countries with the same population density are n't able to do it . 
  [ here are swedish exports ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/visualize/tree_map/hs92/export/swe/all/show/2014/ ) almost half our exports are from advanced industries , not our own basic resources . 
  [ here are our imports ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/2pyora ) , in case you want to see that too . 
  -- [ here are the exports of papua new guinea ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/visualize/tree_map/hs92/export/png/all/show/2014/ ) as a comparison . 
  they are a similarly sized country with a similar population , and also very rich on natural resources . 
  resources are not the key here . 
  you can also look at for example south korea , taiwan or [ japan ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/visualize/tree_map/hs92/export/jpn/all/show/2014/ ) to see that natural resources are n't even a requirement to be successful . 
   the thing is that sweden has a lot of arable land . 
  among the lowest in the world . 
  and only 7,5 % agricultural land in total , which is very very low . 
  https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2097.html we are not producing enough food to feed our own population either . 
  although i admit data on that is hard to find , but the fact that we barely export any food mostly confirms that . 
  the food we do export is generally not basic food stuff either , which is what is actually necessary to feed ourselves , we do import some of that though , from denmark for example , which are big food producers . 
  a lot of the food exported from sweden does not have it 's origin here either , it 's only processed here . 
  think that 's the case with a lot of norwegian fish for example . 
  ( one of our bigger food exports is coffee ... ) i can buy that our iron exports has helped us a lot on the way , but that is not anywhere close to the whole story . 
  africa is probably the most resource rich continent on earth for example , and not particularly rich last time i checked . 
  you need a well functioning state first of all , low corruption , high trust , etc. 
  and you need working industries , basic industries can be enough though , as australia shows , but most of the time more advanced industries are what high gdp/capita countries rely on . 
  having very varied exports helps in the long run as well , which is why the arabian economies might be very rich , but still not in a particularly good position . 
  the rebuilding of europe boosting the mostly intact swedish industries after ww2 helped a bunch too . 
  you have * b\u00f8gballe * too . 
  would translate to `` gay dick '' in a lot of sweden . 
  ( meaning of balle changes with dialects though ), 
  hors\u00e5s ( whore sauce ) ( actually pronounced almost the same as in english ) h\u00f6ga skiten ( the high shit ) menstr\u00e4sk ( period swamp ) k\u00f6ttsj\u00f6n ( meat lake ) r\u00f6ven ( the ass ) r\u00f6vh\u00e5let ( the asshole ) snopptorp ( dick croft ) ( - torp ( croft ) is common at the end of place names ) tarmberget ( bowel mountain ) -- just picked some out of a list i found , there are soooo many of these . 
  anyone else feel free to add more . 
  we do also have two actually relatively big towns with slightly funny names . 
  trosa , which means `` panty '' , and fittja , which is very close to `` fitta '' which means `` cunt '' . 
  -- btw , great thread , haha . 
  there are n't many swedish tv-series .
