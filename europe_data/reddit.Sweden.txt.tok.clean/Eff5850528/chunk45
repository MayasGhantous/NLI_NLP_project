  it 's the sort of thing people are expected to know , or at least have a vague idea about . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/template:most_traded_currencies and are n't you just as `` special '' for demanding that they convert to euros or whatever ? 
   signed by representatives of the nobility , clergy , burghers and peasantry . 
  and of course approved by `` carl , by the grace of god , king of sweden , the goths , and the wends , & c. , & c. , & c. , heir to norway , duke of schleswig holstein , stormarn and ditmarsen , count of oldenburg and delmenhorst , & c. , & c. '' nice titles . 
  second to last paragraph :  art . 
  whatever applies under article 1 in respect of the right to communicate  and procure information and intelligence and the right to anonymity  applies also to radio programmes broadcast from transmitters outside  sweden and to technical recordings not delivered for dissemination in  sweden , if the information was communicated or procured in sweden ,  regardless of whether the recording was made in sweden or abroad . 
   exceptions to the right to communicate and procure information in respect  of radio programmes transmitted from the high seas or the airspace  over the high seas may however be laid down in law . 
  we have so much weird stuff in our `` constitution '' , lol . 
  there are cheaper pubs for normal people too . 
  around 3,5 $ for a beer is as low as it gets . 
  [ this too ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnig8osv10m ), 
  not an idiom . 
  but `` dansk skalle '' ( danish skull/head ) is a headbutt . 
  supposedly it comes from danish sailors who used that trick in fights . 
   so it 's a pretty big document to say the least . 
  [ about 150 pages total . 
  ] ( http://www.riksdagen.se/en/syssiteassets/07.-dokument--lagar/the-constitution-of-sweden-160628.pdf/ ) okey , only about 100 if you discount the riksdag act , which i guess is n't technically part of our `` fundamental laws '' ? 
  i feel like i should really know this stuff better than i do . 
  [ here 's one in norway ] ( https://www.google.se/maps/@61.3090467,12.1771987,3a,75y,79.94h,87.88t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sgtzy0mwndcmaemz-qnqtxw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=sv ) , [ and another one ] ( https://www.google.se/maps/@60.8429498,8.496403,3a,75y,347.28h,77.55t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s28odkfxmvahjw3kq7ftyhg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=sv ) . 
  [ and a bonus from the border ] ( https://www.google.se/maps/@68.4176377,18.1053722,3a,75y,73.65h,76.09t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1slkzgtnjaeq0j7doshz31qg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=sv ) . 
  half the population is getting more and the other half is getting less nationalistic . 
   in finland , hmmm ... no . 
  do n't think i use the `` high speed '' trains . 
  ( some portions of the route i travel might be considered than , not sure ) but i do always travel by train when visiting my parents , or going anywhere outside the city on my own . 
  car is faster and more reliable , but i do n't own a car , and trains are more comfortable . 
  i can sit and read in a ~ ~ relatively comfy chair ~ ~ ( actually , fuck \u00d6resundst\u00e5gs chairs ... ) with a fair amount of leg space for 4 hours , usually nice views out the window too . 
  with a car it would take 3 hours , but the road is super boring and if i drove myself i would n't be able to do anything else . 
  if i had the money and ability ( parking space for example ) to own a car i probably would , but only because i could explore and stop in new places on the way , not because it 's quicker . 
  if there is a train route going from your city to wherever you 're visiting it is very convenient , but as soon as you need to change trains on the way and that sort of thing it gets annoying very quickly . 
  i 'm lucky to have only one change on the way to my parents , and i can walk to the train stations from both of our homes . 
  all in all , a car is not high on my priority list of things to spend money on , trains are fine for now . 
  edit : and yeah , when flying it 's a lot more convenient to take the train to kastrup than having to deal with parking and stuff . 
  was n't what i meant though . 
  meant areas that were actually part of russia ( or ussr ) historically . 
  the warsaw pact were puppets of the soviets , but not directly controlled . 
  finland and poland are the exceptions . 
  chocolate ingredients are not european , but modern chocolate is . 
  at least it 's definitely not swedish . 
   no , but putting them together to make what we call kebabpizza is !, 
  it 's not . 
  it was not invented in sweden . 
  only thing special about kebabpizza and sweden is how popular it is here . 
  is n't that pretty much exactly what i said ? 
  spanish . 
  fairly straightforward language imo , and spaniards are notoriously bad english speakers . 
  also the second largest language in the world in number of native speakers ( after mandarin ) . 
  but most of the speakers are in america , so if you 're just interested in europe it 's not as useful . 
  german is probably the most useful in europe , but nowhere else really . 
  lots of german speakers all over central europe . 
  french is fairly useful in europe , but also in a lot of other places , mainly africa . 
  russian is very useful in eastern europe , and anywhere else where the russians has been historically , central asia for example . 
  english is bad in most of these areas too . 
  arabic is used around like half the mediterranean too , so that 's almost european . 
  probably difficult to learn though . 
   so when the paris-dakar race went from paris to dakar , did the racers ride a ferry ? 
  yep . 
  we do n't have that many complete historic areas remaining though . 
  height-wise maybe , but a lot of the old buildings were demolished in the 60s and replaced with concrete blocks instead . 
  it 's more a case of not wanting those odd towers like turning torso `` ruining '' the view in the city . 
  it 's not really about keeping it `` historic '' , at least not here in sweden . 
  ( as in , it 's not the * history * that 's in focus , just aesthetics ) the difference in america is that they expect their cities to look like that . 
  we do n't expect uppsala to have skyscrapers , so we do n't build any . 
  they 're at the other end of the spectrum , they probably build skyscrapers even when it 's not really sensible , because that 's the way you build things in city centres over there . 
  just different traditions . 
   which is de rotterdam that place looks surprisingly good , considering it 's basically just a bunch of slightly misaligned cubes . 
  london is one of the most expensive places on earth to live in , keep that in mind . 
  not any specific event . 
  if the eurozone got their shit together . 
  the countries need to get on more similar levels economically before we would join . 
  or at least be heading in that direction , currently greece are pretty much going the other way round , their economy is shrinking , does n't feel very stable . 
  i do n't know too much about this though , economics is n't my forte . 
  also , we will be better off alone for the foreseeable future . 
  if we were to join it would be to help build europe as a whole stronger , short term loss for us , but long term gain . 
  [ gothia towers ] ( http://www.goteborg.com/globalassets/bilder---image/gothia-towers/gothia-towers-167-3.jpg/w1200/ ) ( 100m ) [ lisebergstornet ] ( https://jozii.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/dsc_7048.jpg ) ( 116m ) is taller , on a hill , and more iconic , but it 's a tower , not a building , apparently . 
  they dress it up like that for christmas , normally it [ looks like this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/lisebergstornet_goteborg_sweden_20100717.jpg/240px-lisebergstornet_goteborg_sweden_20100717.jpg ) . 
  also , it 's europes highest free fall amusement park ride thing , according to wikipedia . 
  they are planning on building a new highest building in sweden here , [ karlatornet ] ( http://www.karlatornet.se/wp-content/themes/karlatornet/dist/images/bg/blue/blue-2.jpg ) , 240m i think . 
  personally i think it looks like [ orthanc ] ( http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/lotr/images/7/77/isengard_army.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120601223256 ) from lotr . 
  gothenburg population : 550k, 
  probably not . 
  i 'm not against the idea out of principle , it just seems like a bad move right now . 
  we have enough things to deal with at home without getting involved in all the problems that comes with the eurozone . 
  our current government does n't appear to be very good at actually doing things , mostly talk and little action . 
  would not trust them to take us through a conversion to the euro . 
  and as always , i 'd rather have a closer nordic union than a closer eu . 
  not many mountains in sweden , at least not where people live . 
  norway has most of them . 
  we do have lots of lakes and forests though , even if you live in the bigger cities you will have that type of nature very nearby . 
  norway . 
  easier to get a job , easier to get an apartment , higher pay , already know most of the language , more beautiful nature . 
  not sure why i 'm not moving to norway already to be honest . 
  otherwise i like france , not sure why , just feels like a good mix of what i already have and something different . 
  i like greece too for example , but i feel like actually living there properly , not just visiting , would be a bit too much of a change . 
  possibly scotland , really like that place . 
   and this minority in scania wants to be independent or do they want to join denmark ? 
  only like a really small group of people are actually serious about it , and i think they want independence . 
  joking about independence or joining denmark is pretty widespread though , which one depends on the situation . 
   i 've heard their dialect is similar to danish . 
  it is , but not really . 
  a lot of the weird things about the dialect do n't exist in danish either .
