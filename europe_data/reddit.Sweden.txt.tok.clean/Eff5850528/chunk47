  but if you want to maximise your grades , look up what courses give extra `` points '' when applying for the specific program you 're interested in . 
  usually as long as you study something that would be useful for later studies you get points anyway . 
  studying a bunch of technical courses is probably more useful than doing french if you 're going for engineering for example . 
  obviously some university programs are very hard to get into , then you have to plan a bit more , but for most people it does n't matter much . 
  and in my experience , most high school students underestimates how useful actually learning stuff is , focuses too much on just grades and doing the least amount of effort possible . 
  that 's what i did too , but figured i would translate them to the newer system . 
  nothing fundamental changed with the subjects that i know of , just some rearranging . 
  was there actually a `` religion b '' course ? 
  some cities have different schools doing different programs , but there are no official divisions . 
  i think most agricultural schools are separate though , mostly for practical reasons i suppose . 
  did they change that again ? 
  when i was in high school just a few years back we only got merit points if the university program did n't already require those subjects . 
  so i did n't get any points from the math courses when i applied for the engineering program , because all those courses were mandatory . 
  i did get points for programming , cad , and some others though . 
  and what subjects you could get extra points from varied depending on what university program you were applying for , do n't think i would have gotten any points for cad if i was applying for sociology , for example . 
  and exactly what courses you would take in year 3 ( the year you turn 19 ) varies between schools ( and programs , obviously ) . 
  even exactly what courses you take within your program varies between schools to some degree . 
  there are a few subjects that are shared on different levels , some that everyone does , some that are program specific and then some others that the school chooses for your program , and then another few that the student themselves can choose freely . 
  and when they appear on your schedule depends on how your school plans out the years in regards to classrooms and teachers and all that . 
  for ops question : i do n't remember what i did the last year , was a while back , did the technical program with focus on computer science + university studies . 
  definitely did maths 4 + 5 and physics 2 ( actually struggled a bit with those ) . 
  some random computer courses too and some basic courses that we had n't done yet , like religion . 
  overall my third year was very relaxed though , had very few hours every week especially the last term ( like 10-12 or something iirc ) because our first and second year was packed completely full . 
  i know there has been a few reforms lately , so excuse me if this is n't up to date . 
  in sweden we do the same thing . 
  classic dad joke btw , `` shit in the ... '' ( meaning `` do n't bother with the ... '' ) and someone answers `` no , that would stink '' . 
  but we 're worse over here , we also add shit to the beginning of words and it means `` very ... '' , so `` skitkul '' ( shit funny ) = very funny . 
  even really bizarre ones are common like `` skitgott '' ( shit good ) which you could say about something you 're eating and it would mean it 's `` very good '' . 
  no idea how we came up with that . 
  j\u00e4vlar / fan/satan etc. 
  ( the most common swearwords ) are fine in casual speech with almost anyone except kids ( and even with kids it 's not too bad unless you overdo it ) . 
  they do n't use it on for example tv depending on what program it is though , and obviously not in most `` serious '' settings . 
  do n't think our equivalent of shit/crap was ever considered swearwords here , but might be wrong , they are not the `` proper '' word to use , but not really `` bad '' . 
  what i have noticed is the younger generations using kuk/fitta as swearwords a lot ( our versions of cock/cunt ) . 
  i know at least some older people ( like my parents ) do n't really like that . 
  so that 's mostly what we 're left with nowadays if we actually want to get a reaction . 
  edit : btw , `` fuck '' ( in the context of swearing ) has no real equivalent in the swedish language , any of fan/j \u00e4vlar / satan would work ( they all translate to the devil/devils ) , but they are considered relatively mild swearwords here . 
  so that is partly why you often see swedes overusing the word `` fuck '' when speaking english , when translated to swedish it is a pretty mild swearword . 
  i thought [ these ] ( http://f.tqn.com/y/insects/1/w/e/7/-/-/full-harvestman.jpg ) where `` daddy long legs '' ? 
  where i live now , in the middle of the city : none . 
  where i grew up , right next to a cow field : lots of very very annoying flies ( they like to fly into your nose/mouth/eyes in the morning , while buzzing insanely loudly ) , mosquitoes , moths , bees , wasps , and [ these ] ( http://www.bioresurs.uu.se/myller/stad/stad_bild/harkrankhane.jpg ) that i do n't know the name of in english . 
  possibly dragonflies too , had lots of those in the garden , but do n't think i 've ever had one inside . 
   we learn some things about russia but not as much compared to sweden you were never * really * a part of russia , while you definitely were a part of sweden , so that makes sense . 
  that 's cool to hear though , did n't know you did that much swedish history . 
  when people on reddit talks about finnish history it 's often as if people only count the 20th century , but you were as much part of for example the swedish great power period as modern sweden was ( for better or worse ) . 
  in fact more so than for example i would have been down here in sk\u00e5ne . 
  okey , cool . 
  that 's exactly the sort of things i was wondering about . 
  but do you in `` latvian history '' for example get to learn about the history of the russian empire ? 
  since you where part of that for 200 years . 
  or do they only focus on events that are specifically linked to the area that is now modern latvia ? 
  ( occupations , famines etc. ), 
   it 's both comedy and deama so there 's everything in it . 
  has a really good mix too imo , enough comedy to not make it boring , but still enough drama that you get really into the characters . 
  season 1-2s cast was brilliant too , several of them have gone on to become bigger actors after it . 
  also great soundtrack . 
  have to admit i stopped watching it in season 5 though , maybe i just grew out of it , but felt like it lost some quality . 
  season 1-4 was released when i went through high school , so obviously i liked it back then . 
  [ apparently it 's all on youtube :d ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ise2jflskcc ), 
  that 's not exactly the reason sweden let foreigners into the country . 
  he 's not wrong about the successful part , from his definition anyway . 
  but the main goal with accepting refugees was n't necessarily to gain an economic benefit from it ( although that was claimed as well ) . 
  the first clear memories i have are probably from when i was 10 or 11 and spent the summer visiting my grandparents outside of nice in southern france . 
  remember reading lord of the rings for the first time while i was there , always pretending i was on an adventure with elves and orcs and stuff , my grandpa always got to be gandalf , haha . 
  remember going on lots of different trips , as well as the car ride down there from sweden , also sleeping under the stars in the vineyards . 
  so that was pretty nice . 
  i have other earlier memories , but only like images , ca n't actually remember it `` as if i was there '' . 
  earliest probably from cyprus when i was 5 , but i might have just made up those memories for all i know . 
  actually remember going to legoland and danish stone beaches as well , haha . 
  yep , does n't work all the time though . 
  you can say that it 's `` lagom '' warm outside for example . 
  which you can obviously work out a way to say in english too , but anyway , it 's still a bit unique . 
  though i know people who think it 's this totally new word that does n't exist in any other language or whatever , and it obviously is n't . 
  if you want to answer the question `` how much ? '', 
  without actually thinking about the answer it 's brilliant . 
   if a stranger holds a door open people always hold doors open for whoever is coming after them here , at least what i 've seen . 
   or tries to start a conversation . 
  we do n't do that in public because we do n't want to inconvenience people . 
  we assume they do n't want to talk with us , i guess you assume everyone wants to talk , that 's really the only difference . 
  we can still start conversations with strangers , but only in a situation where that is acceptable . 
  i guess the obligatory swedish `` lagom '' . 
  translates as both `` enough '' and `` not too much '' in one word . 
  how much butter do you want on your sandwich ? 
  - lagom it 's actually pretty useless , because no one really knows how much `` lagom '' is . 
  day after tomorrow = \u00f6vermorgon day before yesterday = f\u00f6rg\u00e5r :d, 
   eat surstr\u00f6mming , maybe ? 
  i 've never even seen surstr\u00f6mming , definitely have n't tasted it . 
  is n't it just a northern thing ? 
  but the other things you mentioned actually have fairly rigid rules , if you learn them you 're fine . 
  with en/ett you need to learn that for pretty much every word , which is why i mentioned it specifically . 
  i guess the pitch accent might be difficult too if you 're not used to it , did n't think of that . 
   yes and no . 
  it 's similar and certainly easier than a lot of other languages , yes , but not necessarily that easy . 
  how many languages are easier than swedish to learn though ? 
  ( for an english speaker ) norwegian , danish , dutch and french are the only real contenders afaik . 
  obviously learning an entirely different langauge is never going to be * easy * , it 's all relative . 
  we use mostly the same system . 
  when to write words as a single word or not . 
  example : `` s\u00e4rskrivning '' or `` s\u00e4r skrivning '' and another thing swedes often mess up is when to write `` de '' or `` dem '' ( they/them ) . 
  it 's pretty pointless in the end because almost everyone says `` dom '' in both cases , it 's just a leftover from older language that we are supposed to use when writing .
