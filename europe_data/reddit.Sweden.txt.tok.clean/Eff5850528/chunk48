  and what actually is hardest for people learning our languages is probably `` en '' and `` ett '' ( a/an/one ) , native speakers knows what to use , but most people ca n't actually explain why it 's one or the other , we just know . 
  it has to do with gender ( common/neuter ) , but the rules are a bit ( very ) messy , so yeah , hard to learn . 
  other than the last thing i think swedish is an easy language if you already know english . 
   do n't know of an private facilities here , so ... no ? 
  do n't think people would opt for it even if we had them . 
  the private healthcare we have is generally just clinics within the same framework as the public clinics , same costs and everything ( i think ? 
   for the general populace , i 'd say the monarchy is a non-issue . 
  the king is a lovable goof , and he has no executive power anyway . 
  and victoria , his daughter and next in line , seems very competent . 
  i think if we somehow got a bunch of idiots in our royal family we would be fairly quick with abolishing it . 
  we 're not very strict about holding on to the past and all that like for example the uk often seems to be . 
  we have kept the monarchy because it 's not actually hurting anyone , do n't fix something that is n't broken type of deal . 
  i think there has been some debate about how much and who in the royal family that should get money from the state . 
  but again , there are much more important reforms we could work on instead , if we would change that it 's mostly out of principle , not because it 's particularly bad for our country or whatever . 
  so in short , i think if we had a reason to abolish it we would do so without too many problems . 
  but we do n't really have a reason , so no one has bothered . 
   kackerlacka the word came from the dutch * kakkerlakken * . 
  i have no idea what it actually means . 
  yeah , it used to mean calm in swedish too . 
  maybe it comes from how certain people remain calm in stressful situations by joking about it ? 
  i do n't know . 
   `` sex '' - well , this actually means sex , but it 's also used for the number 6 . 
  so getting assigned to `` group 6 '' in school was always funny . 
   in german the word `` curve '' is `` die kurve '' which in lithuanian ( thanks to polish `` kurwa '' ) sounds almost like `` a whore '' . 
  same thing here . 
  * kurva * in swedish , sounds exactly like kurwa i think , haha . 
  we have the classic `` it 's not the * fart * that kills you , it 's the * smell * '' fart = speed smell ( sm\u00e4ll ) = bang ( that 's the same in norwegian too ) there are tons of these . 
  fack = compartment/box skum = foam hora ( spanish for hour/time ) = whore , in swedish buys/byes sounds like `` bajs '' which = poo but yeah , there are many many more . 
  sk\u00c5l we have a tradition of singing `` drinking songs '' ( not sure what to call it , * snapsvisor * in swedish ) , but that is mostly on holidays or other more `` important '' events . 
  speeches do of course happen occasionally if celebrating something , not sure how common it is compared to other countries though . 
  in a more casual setting we just say `` sk\u00e5l '' , or at most `` sk\u00e5l '' for something , like good weather or good luck or whatever . 
  the drinking songs are pretty interesting though , but i 'm not good at that so i hope someone else can write about it . 
  lithuania where i grew up , because we had a ferry route to klaipeda . 
  it varies a lot depending on where you are . 
  our current queen is german-brazilian , and not from a `` noble '' family afaik . 
  university student , living in 19m ^ 2 student housing in a 550k city , sharing a kitchen with 8 other people , have my own bathroom though . 
  rent is 3500kr ( 370 $ ) per month , but only 10 months of the year ( no rent over the summer ) , and i get 1200kr per month in housing subsidies too ( because i have no real income ) . 
  so the real rent becomes about 1900kr ( 200 $ ) per month . 
  electricity and all that is included in the rent , 100/100 mbit internet too . 
  outside of that i spend around 2000kr on food every month , so i have plenty of my 10 000kr student subsidies + loans left to spend on other shit . 
  ( student loans are cheap , so worth taking even if i just save them for when i eventually will need to buy an apartment ) -- rents are relatively low in sweden due to regulations ( compared to the price of buying an apartment ) . 
  but it is extremely hard to find a rental apartment in the bigger cities , there is an overall housing shortage , but especially on rental apartments . 
  5 years queue time or something like that i think . 
  student housing is a bit easier , but you still need to be in a queue for at least one year to get something ( in gothenburg , worse in stockholm ) . 
  they become more integrated with time too , some words might even switch spelling to a swedish variant . 
  i 'm sure there are other better examples , but how you can spell * nice * like * najs * comes to mind . 
  https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucyqb1ttrfrzqzmefsx770qw vlog , you might not like that , but whatever . 
  he travels a lot and does lots of things so usually enjoyable to follow . 
  that can help a bit yeah . 
  but managing your truces and attacking or paying them off when appropriate is a bit more important . 
  i like it because the repetitive/annoying memes are easily avoidable . 
  and if i ca n't tell that it 's a meme from the link i 'll probably get a bit of a laugh out of it , since i did n't expect it . 
  it 's much better than it was a year or two ago with the front page being 60 % opinion pieces about immigration , and 30 % minor news that somehow always ended up in a discussion about immigration . 
  a single province is usually possible , anyway , learning how to deal with coalitions is a good idea too . 
  you only eat oatmeal for breakfast , that 's the only thing i could think of that is entirely `` meal specific '' . 
  and you generally do n't eat cooked food for breakfast , so no spaghetti , that would be super weird , even if you have leftovers , save that for lunch instead . 
  bacon and eggs for example is accepted as normal , but it 's not exactly common , most people eat sandwiches , cereal , or those sort of things . 
  i 've never eaten [ crayfish ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crayfish_party ) . 
  no idea how people would react , i just say i do n't like crayfish whenever a crayfish party comes up , and i either do n't go or go there but only drink . 
  i just think it looks disgusting , so feel no need to try it out . 
  good old classic scandinenglish quote from someone i ca n't remember who :  it 's not the fart that kills you , it 's the smell [ fart ] ( http://www.linkopingstrafiken.se/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/farthinder.jpg ) = speed , smell = bang/smash/slam / etc. 
  i think the bartender would like you more if you actually specified what beer you want . 
  i think if you just want any cheap lager '' [ en stor stark ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4opvrzlf9he ) '' is a more accepted choice of words , right ? 
  but yeah , best is to just tell them which of the beers they have that you want , which you can probably do by just pointing and gesturing how many . 
  instead of trying to get them to understand your broken swedish . 
   and more importantly , how do i order a beer ? 
  in english , otherwise whoever you 're ordering from probably wo n't understand you . 
  black sea , caucasus , caspian , urals . 
  with the river flowing from the urals to the caspian usually serving as the border on that bit , although it is n't very clear . 
  it 's a similar thing in the urals and the caucasus too , there is n't a 100 % clear border , and there are overlaps with other regions that are probably more important than whether or not the area is in europe . 
  it 's more of a gradual mix of europe and asia at the border , instead of a solid line . 
  the volga could work as well , and i think is more in line with what people actually perceive europe as . 
  but that 's not the `` official '' border . 
  and g\u00f6teborg has all the gangs with grenades and stuff . 
  and similar things for certain stockholm suburbs . 
  it 's not really the whole cities , only certain parts of them . 
  russia , belarus and ukraine are the only ones that are definitely in eastern europe . 
  the others depends on the context . 
   if you 're playing eu4 , yeah , nah , it 's all about development . 
  and eastern europe is pretty shit for that as well . 
  obviously you can develop your provinces if you want , but you do n't have infinite mana , better to start out in the lowlands or northern italy that already have high dev if you 're doing that . 
  if you only go east you 'll probably end up near kiev . 
  moscow is pretty far north you know . 
  i moved out in high school . 
  but that 's not very common , only if you have a specific reason . 
  moved about 4 hours away for university , mostly because i like this city , could have chosen a closer school if i wanted . 
  most people go to a school fairly nearby , so if you live in a city with a good university you might stay put , but i think most people still move out completely , or at least want to if they could find a place to live . 
  money is n't really an issue if you 're studying , student subsidies and loans are enough to live comfortably off . 
  btw , why has denmark tied their currency to the euro ? 
  does n't that sort of fuck up the whole point of keeping their own currency ? 
  i know both of those are often ranked highly by people . 
  i do n't like ranking songs . 
  music is hardly a competition , and there are so many songs out there that even listing a few ones considered `` the best '' would be impossible . 
  homemade [ kanelbullar ] ( https://tickledpinkstyle.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/kanelbulle.jpg ) ( cinnamon buns ) with some good swedish coffee . 
  lots of different pies are great too . 
  apple , rhubarb , bilberry , and so on . 
  preferably you should pick the apples/berries yourself too , tastes better that way imo . 
  if you 're here in february , the days before fasting used to start , then you have to try [ these glorious things ] ( https://d3vjk4jagnknqc.cloudfront.net/uploads/2013/07/semla-2048x1152.jpg ) , it 's called a `` semla '' , and it 's just a sweet bun with lots of cream and a core of almond paste . 
  not too fancy , but hey . 
  and if you 're here before/during christmas , [ lussebullar ] ( http://www.spisa.nu/recipeimages/ri_18124_3.jpg ) ( saffron buns ) and [ pepparkakor ] ( http://www.prinsessanpaarten.se/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/pepparkakor.jpg ) ( gingerbread cookies ) with some gl\u00f6gg ( mulled wine ) .
