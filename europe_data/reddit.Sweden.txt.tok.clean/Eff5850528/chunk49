  some of those might fall outside the definition of pastry , but whatever , you have some things here at least . 
  we have more `` proper '' pastries too , but i 'm not good at that , someone else has to do them . 
   you either have a compost on your own or a brown bin on your driveway , as well as a green bin for household garbage . 
  the garbage truck will come and pick these up . 
   for other types of garbage ( like plastics , paper etc. ), 
  you need to drive to recycling facility . 
  my parents have [ full recycling in their bins ] ( http://www.alingsas.se/sites/default/files/imagecache/box_images_right_900/fni_sopkarl_etiketter_okt2014_0_0.jpg ) at home : metal , plastic , paper , glass and so on . 
  and has had for a few years now . 
   yet large enough for third-world migrants to maybe not have . 
  they already pay pretty big amounts to get here . 
  the smugglers do n't do it as a charity . 
  are n't sweden still technically obligated to join ? 
  we 're just not `` fulfilling '' the requirements willingly , which we can continue doing for as long as we want or something . 
  or is that how it used to be and they have actually given us a real exception now ? 
  keep the volume down . 
  for some reason especially americans are way louder than everyone else , at least up here in the north . 
  it 's sort of double ironic , the irony is that he is singing unironically about a un politician . 
  i want to get rid of it . 
  although our current monarch and heir are doing a good job , so it 's not like there 's any particular rush . 
  one big thing in our culture is to not bother other people unnecessary , what people say about respecting personal space , not randomly chatting with strangers and so on is all about that . 
  but this also works the other way around , it 's very important for us to help other people and just overall be friendly and helpful . 
  so if we 're having you as our guest or that kind of situation most people will try being as helpful as possible , really go out of their way to make sure things are good and all that stuff . 
  we are a very respectful and considerate people , even though we might appear cold on the outside . 
  supposedly mushrooms are traditionally not seen as something you 're supposed to eat in sweden ( like , 2-300 years ago , they did n't even have names for most mushrooms ) . 
  but considering how big berry picking in the wild and that sort of thing has always been , mushrooms have definitely caught on by now , but it has n't been a tradition here forever . 
  my mum always picks chanterelles . 
  she has her own hard to reach places out in the woods where she basically grows them , picking them every week or so when they are getting big . 
  with the right amount of rain and sun/warmth and so on she gets at least a few litres per `` harvest '' . 
  most people i know do n't do it all that focused though , they basically go out in the woods sometime and see if they find anything . 
  we 're definitely very conservative about what types of mushrooms we pick too , we know they can be poisonous so we tend to stick to a few ones we know ( like chanterelles ) . 
  the best way to enjoy chanterelles is probably fried in butter on some bread . 
  we do n't have any particular special dishes with mushrooms though , not in my family anyway , we might do a pie or pasta sauce with them , or just throw them in with whatever dish we 're doing , can have them in a wok or hamburgers for example , works with most things tbh . 
  but yeah , i think most people gathering food in the forests here go for berries instead . 
  especially bilberries , most forest floors are covered with bilberry bushes , and they all grow lots of tasty berries , you do n't exactly have to `` go looking '' for them , just go outside and pick some , they are everywhere . 
  but somewhat rarer berries like lingonberries , blackberries , raspberries , or cloudberries are also picked . 
  my grandpa always picks buckets of billberries in the summers , making lot 's of pies and stuff out of them :d they also freeze them and have them with their oatmeal for breakfast the rest of the year . 
   do you watch the dubbed version only animated movies are dubbed as far as i know , so it 's not like i have a choice most of the time . 
  for animation i 'm not sure what i would choose . 
  probably swedish if it 's an older one that i remember from growing up , like the lion king , finding nemo etc , i think the big disney movies and that sort of thing tend to have fairly good voice acting even in swedish , at least those did . 
  i 'm not sure what i would choose with a newer movie , do n't remember watching any that could have been dubbed , probably the native language , feels more `` right '' that way . 
  iirc the cat in the childrens book was actually named from the box pettsson found him in or something like that , which was from the company findus . 
  the same is true for germanic or romance languages too . 
  a lot of words are shared , they are just pronounced differently . 
  sometimes very differently , dutch compared to swedish for example , but looking at written text it 's possible to understand at least some of it still . 
  gesturing usually helps more than actually speaking a similar language though . 
  my grandma did fine in france despite not knowing french or english , haha . 
  people name their pets anything ( my parents cat is called `` zeppelin '' for example ) . 
  even though these names might be the most common they are still not particularly common . 
  i 've never seen most of them . 
  since you did n't list them , ** cats ( female ) : ** - maja - smulan - selma - molly - doris ** cats ( male ) : ** - sigge - nisse - findus ( [ cartoon/childrens book character ] ( http://kulturfalat.hu/files/2013/04/pettson.jpg ) ) - sixten - tiger most of these names are regular people names ( or at least nick names ) , we do n't have many specific pet names . 
  if you 're trying to speak completely in swedish it 's usually annoying , because i probably will have a hard time understanding you , beginners tend to fuck up pronunciation badly . 
  my english is probably way better than your swedish . 
  just using certain swedish words in your english sentences works great though , at least for things that do n't have a clear equivalent in the english language . 
  obviously if i know the person and know they want to practice or something i 'm usually fine with it . 
  but if a stranger starts talking to me in broken swedish that 's just annoying . 
   i guess not funny for you anymore i do n't think it was ever funny for us . 
  i feel like people talk a lot about all the nordic countries , at least considering our population sizes . 
  sweden is also the biggest country out of them . 
  10 million people . 
  denmark , norway and finland all have 5-6 million only . 
  iceland has only 0,3 million , but more volcanoes than anyone else . 
  also , we 're relatively rich , so we do a lot of weird/innovative/whatever things , that tend to get some talk going . 
  the biggest topic ( at least on reddit ) for the last few years has been the immigration crisis too , and sweden and germany are the two biggest `` victims '' of that in europe . 
  greece nice climate . 
  it 's beautiful , basically all coastline and mountains , great combo . 
  great food , and the typical restaurant is `` basic '' enough that i do n't feel out of place ( like i do in many `` nice '' restaurants ) . 
  overall very relaxed atmosphere as long as you stay away from the most touristy places . 
  lot 's of places around the mediterranean are similar , but greece will probably always be my favourite because i spent a lot of my childhood there . 
  sweden, 
  you 're welcome, 
  yes, 
  swedes . 
  i 've seen way more swedes misbehave in my life than any other nationality . 
  wonder why ... 
  we did that in math too , but i think they should do that in a lot more subjects . 
  i worked as a music teacher for a while and it would have been great if i could have done that . 
  now i basically had to spend all my time in every class making sure the `` bad '' kids behaved , the ones who actually cared about what they were doing where mostly left alone . 
  if i had the worst ones in one class i could have got help dealing with that one , but the others i could have actually done alone . 
  now i was basically doing a bad job teaching in every class instead . 
  with an actual teacher i guess they are better at it than me , but it would still affect them too in a similar way . 
  first off we desperately need more teachers in some subjects . 
  everyone in the entire country agrees on that , we just have n't managed to fix that yet for whatever reason . 
  the other issues are mostly based on personal opinion . 
  i believe we need to get rid of the extreme `` everyone is equal '' thing we have going . 
  divide students into groups based on student ability in each subject instead of having arbitrary chosen classes . 
  that both makes it simpler to allocate resources were needed ( ie bad students ) and make school more fun for the better students . 
  it would also to some extent encourage students to perform better . 
  right now grades are supposed to do that , but there is n't really a good way to compare yourself to others with grades , other than basically going around asking everyone , which obviously not many do , especially if they are doing poorly . 
  obviously it would also cause some issues , but i feel like it would be totally worth it to get students to take things somewhat more seriously . 
  right now i think a lot of kids basically just go to school because that 's what they 're supposed to do , they really do n't see much point in putting effort into it , grades are supposed to motivate them i guess but that 's mostly just arbitrary numbers which they are barely even sure what they 're useful for . 
  only talking about primary school here btw . 
  i believe gymnasium ( high school ) works alright most of the time because of more mature students and them having chosen a lot of their subjects willingly , but the same thing about student competitiveness could be useful there as well . 
  but overall i do n't think it 's that bad except for the teacher problem . 
  we have shitty results internationally , but i think that 's mainly because we have basically no real system in place to handle all the immigrant kids , they just get shoved into normal classes for their age despite them not having enough knowledge for that , sometimes they do n't even speak swedish . 
  our school system is definitely not the best , but it 's not as bad as it might seem looking at statistics either . 
  cost of living is relatively high . 
  and it 's hard getting someplace to live . 
  everything else is alright , i suppose . 
  but that change did n't come from schengen did it ? 
  was n't that later ?
