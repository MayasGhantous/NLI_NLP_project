  obviously we still primarily focus on our own people , but i feel like we put a lot more focus on these sort of things than most other countries . 
  it 's not necessarily always a good thing , but i feel like i can be proud of that general attitude at least . 
  generalising a lot since this is / r/askeurope . 
  but i speak a south swedish dialect , which is spoken in the formerly danish provinces of sweden . 
  sk\u00e5nska ( scanian ) is the most well known , but both halland and blekinge speak variants of the dialect as well ( usually with more swedish influence ) . 
  i 'm from blekinge btw , so i do n't actually speak `` sk\u00e5nska '' , but no one knows how people in my tiny province speak anyway and just assume i 'm from sk\u00e5ne , so i 'll represent sk\u00e5nska as well in this post , should be fine . 
  it differs from standard swedish because of the danish influence . 
  the region used to be an integral part of denmark and spoke danish until the late 17th century , when it was conquered and assimilated into sweden . 
  they forced everyone to speak swedish instead of danish , but some danish influence can still be heard . 
  mostly in how the language sounds , we still use a lot of [ diphthongs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/diphthong ) for example , unlike standard swedish . 
  we also pronounce r differently from most of the rest of sweden . 
  but there are also some unique words and so on , some of them we have in common with danish . 
  the dialect is easily winning `` ugliest dialect '' polls most of the time , and is not exactly seen as a particular intellectual dialect , stereotypical farmers often speak this way for example . 
  but the people living in the area are very attached to their dialect , and it 's probably a large part in why this is still one of the most `` independent '' ( for lack of a better word ) areas in sweden , do n't exactly have an independence movement going , but it is often joked about . 
  [ this gem too ] ( http://cdn08.dayviews.com/69/_u1/_u3/_u4/_u1/_u1/u134117/fs_403748048_94859_1251106814/_smaskens_knackebrodsmacka_med_skivad_kokt_agg_o_kaviar.jpg ) [ or this ] ( http://lh4.ggpht.com/-7a5yk2_y9b0/vppzm-fgrri/aaaaaaaaiyi/nm0kijq7-jy/s640/dc24f985f96e1ac7ddf5d024f4fe4704.webp.jpg ) , which is just very boring , but good as a snack . 
  preferably enjoyed with a glass of chocolate milk to bring back childhood memories . 
  it specifically means something you put on a sandwich , haha . 
  do n't think i 've seen it used on anything else . 
  could roughly translate it to something like `` add on top '' ( p\u00e5 = on top , l\u00e4gg = add ), 
  in reality we probably just copied the danish flag , but with our own traditional colours ( blue and gold ) . 
  we were in a union under them at the time , and frequently rebelled , so it seems likely that 's what happened . 
  i do n't clean them . 
  have n't died of it yet , so do n't think it 's too bad . 
  my neighbours . 
  most of them are really boring , and since i 'm boring too it 's not fun at all here . 
  grew up with dinner at 17-18 . 
  since my parents worked from 7/8 to 16/17 we always ate when the last one of them got home . 
  regular day was : breakfast around 7 , lunch around 12 , dinner around 17 . 
  not sure what 's so strange about it . 
  sweden does . 
  sweden : we do n't have fraternities , but all the big universities have organisations that do mostly the same things that ( as i understand it ) american fraternities do . 
  it can be `` nations '' , originally composed of students from different parts of the country , but only the names remain of that system ( they are all named after swedish regions ) . 
  it can also be program `` sections '' , you automatically belong to your program 's section ( so the `` electrical engineering section '' for example , often shortened to a letter , e maybe ) . 
  there are probably other systems too , it varies from school to school , but i do n't know about all the schools in sweden . 
  our older/bigger universities have crazy amounts of traditions btw , both official and unofficial , more than anything else i 've encountered . 
  these are all different from the `` student corps '' which handle most of the serious things related to your studies . 
  the death of \u00d6gedei khan . 
  while we do n't know this for certain , it 's possible that it saved europe from getting completely invaded by the mongols . 
  they withdrew their armies from hungary , supposedly to elect a new khan , but it 's likely that there were other reasons as well . 
  but either way , if they would have continued their invasion europe would have probably looked very different today . 
  it 's not much different from regular sausages or things like that , not on a weirdness scale anyway . 
   raggarrock : eddie meduza is there much competition in that genre ? 
  haha mbma are pretty damn good btw , loved finding them a few years back when i got more into hip hop .

  and most of this is very mainstream , but i guess that hardly matters for all you non-swedes . 
  -- if i had to choose only one favourite , then probably kent . 
  not a fan of their latest albums , but hagnesta hill , vapen och ammunition , and du och jag d\u00f6den are all great records . 
  but that 's not very fun , so i added a bunch of other really good artists too . 
  copenhagen , stockholm , helsinki , prague , edinburgh ( if that counts ) , rome , reykjavik , monaco ( again , does that count ? ) . 
  it 's funny , i really have n't visited many capitals . 
  i 've been to a few other too actually ( like oslo or tallinn ) , but only travelling through , so i did n't count them . 
  would like to visit at least berlin , paris , london and istanbul . 
  i 'd like to go most places , but those are the ones that i know i want to do some day , the others are optional , sort of . 
  stockholm too actually , never gone there just to see the city , always had other stuff to do . 
  denmark has nice cities/towns , fun people , and lots of beer . 
  norway has amazing nature , and jobs . 
  finland is just like home but with an unintelligible language . 
  then there 's all the other states around the baltic , but not sure if you would count them as our neighbours or not ? 
  estonia . . cheap alcohol ? 
  germany , well , it 's a huge place with lots of things , that 's nice . 
  poland/lithuania/latvia / russia i have n't visited , so wo n't say anything . 
  swedish is my native language . 
  i also speak english fluently . 
  i sort of `` speak '' norwegian , but not really , i just speak swedish with them and they understand , and vice versa . 
  same with danish but to a lesser extent , it 's harder to understand , both for them and us . 
  can read both languages very well though ( i 've used danish articles as sources in school projects for example ) . 
  i can sometimes read german , due to similarities with swedish . 
  i can also read some french ( but my vocabulary is very small ) , due to taking it in school . 
  but do n't understand either when spoken . 
  i can also read the greek alphabet , haha . 
  and used to be able to write in runic script . 
  but that 's hardly relevant . 
  -- english is taught in schools here from i think even grade 1 now ( maybe grade 2 , not sure ) . 
  from grade 6 or 7 ( again , not sure ) students can choose a third language , spanish/german/french at the schools i 've been to , but that varies , i think those are the three big ones though . 
  there is an option to not study a third language if you want , but that 's mostly if you already have trouble with swedish and english . 
  those continue until grade 9 when `` primary school '' ends . 
  in high school ( 3 years ) we choose what we want to study , some programs include third languages , some do n't , and you can always choose it among your personal courses too . 
  english continues all through this , so any young people in sweden will be decent at english , we 've studied it practically as long as we 've studied swedish . 
  the sistine chapel . 
  it 's not that it 's not worth seeing , it 's just not worth wading through thousands of people in the vatican museum to see it . 
  this applies for the entire museum , it 's so overcrowded that i had a very hard time enjoying it , and i was n't even there during the main tourist season . 
  st peters was cool though , although we were lucky and barely had to wait to get in , but that is one hell of a church , good view from the top too , if you can handle the stairs . 
  ( the [ statues ] ( http://stpetersbasilica.info/pics/fac/redmr-apost3.jpg ) on top totally look like a rock band on stage from behind btw ), 
   oh alright , but driving or taking a train would probably be cheaper than flying within central europe for example , yeah ? 
  varies a lot between different places . 
  sometimes air travel is extremely cheap . 
  i know i could fly from gothenburg to london for like 30 $ at one point for example . 
  but generally if you 're going just a short distance car is the cheapest , if you already have a car that is ( i do n't ) . 
  trains vary from country to country , they are fairly expensive in sweden , and always late . 
   i 'm guessing rather than going to europe to visit one country by plane then flying back , it would be less expensive to find a cheap place to stay and live there for a while and use the euro train lines . 
  i feel like that would be a cheaper way to travel but i have no idea staying longer is always going to be cheaper , the less distance you have to cover the cheaper it gets , pretty much . 
  do n't know how cheap the trains are , but should n't be too bad . 
  getting there and back is the big cost . 
  fuel for the car is expensive , and so is air travel and trains . 
  most places are cheaper than sweden , housing obviously still costs extra but other than that it 's no real extra cost if you do n't want it . 
  ( people tend to spend more money than usual while on vacation though , nice hotel and eating at nice restaurants and so on ), 
  did when i was younger . 
  usually went south to the sun once every year ( for a week or two ) , often to greece ( been there like 10 + times over the years ) . 
  sometimes some other trips too , skiing in the winter for example , or visiting my grandparents over christmas when they lived abroad . 
  since i moved away from home my parents occasionally invite me on a vacation still , but not as often .
