  i ca n't afford to go on any long trips myself though . 
  actually just declined an offer for doing a bunch of classes in uni that would involve me travelling a lot , just ca n't afford the costs . 
  but i have almost never been outside of europe . 
  tunisia , cyprus or iceland is as far as i 've gotten . 
  you mean to another country ? 
  or what ? 
  either way , i do n't remember , was just a baby . 
   knowing that ` yaupon ' is a kind of holly tree seems more a test of biology than vocabulary . 
  same can be said for most non-basic words . 
  having a large vocabulary is mostly about knowing those sorts of things . 
  you said yes to 84 % of the existing words . 
  you said yes to 0 % of the nonwords . 
  better than i expected :d still a bit confused if i should say yes on words that i recognised , but was n't sure what they meant ? 
  would probably have a lot lower score if i had to explain what every word meant in detail . 
  i usually have at least a vague idea though . 
  it 's different all over europe too . 
  i think grading in swedish universities even varies between them . 
  not that grades matter much , only that you pass . 
  japan . 
  i dunno , seems very foreign but at the same time similar in many ways . 
  there are plenty of polish doctors in sweden . 
  i was only talking about common stereotypes , i know a lot of those are n't true . 
  croatia is n't really considered `` eastern europe '' by swedes btw , and i do n't think anyone really doubt that it looks nice . 
  it 's like one of the most popular tourist destinations in europe . 
  if we include former yugoslavia in eastern europe we have a whole other set of stereotypes btw . 
  we had huge immigration from there in the 60s to work in our factories , and then another huge wave in the 90s during the war . 
  most of them have more or less assimilated into normal swedes at this point though , but most of the stereotypes we now have of middle-easterners used to apply to yugoslavs before , at least during the 90s . 
  my first girlfriend ( when i was like 15 ) was half croatian actually , haha . 
  we are similar to the rest of europe . 
  we have some `` socialist '' policies , like mostly free healthcare and schools for everyone , that sort of thing , and we used to have a higher proportion of state owned companies than most countries , not sure if that 's the case anymore . 
  but even the us has state owned companies , so that 's hardly anything special . 
  we have very strong unions too , and the government has given them a lot of power ( so we 're not going on strike every other week like certain countries ) , which is why we have very `` generous '' ( for the worker ) labour laws . 
  overall we have a capitalist system like everyone else , just with a relatively strong state who handles certain things instead of the free market . 
  but very importantly , it 's all very democratic , unlike a lot of `` socialist '' regimes , the socialism we have is generally what the people want , it 's not forced upon us . 
  hence why it 's called a `` social democratic '' system . 
  the scandinavian countries all have very similar systems , which is why they are often bundled together . 
  in my opinion there is n't much to see , it 's worth a stop if you 're going through that area anyway , but not as it 's own destination . 
  it 's a cute little city with a cool church and university and that 's about it . 
  norway ... 
  seriously though , if you 're thinking about spending enough time here to travel through sweden or something like that , just make a trip to norway instead of going all around sweden . 
  stockholm is great , and some other places are alright , but you quickly reach a point where it would have been a lot more worthwhile to just go to norway instead , which has some amazing places . 
  although , as i 've said before in similar posts , if you 're visiting and need some more ideas for what to do . 
  go out to some [ archipelago ] ( http://www.thegreentrails.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/henrik_trygg-kayaking-2445-1024x682.jpg ) somewhere , both stockholm and gothenburg has beautiful ones , you can usually get a ferry some island ( super easy in gothenburg , not sure about stockholm ) . 
  it 's just a [ generally beautiful place ] ( http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01927/archipelago_1927279i.jpg ) , you can go for a swim if it 's summer , or just go for a walk or picnic or whatever ( kayaking is nice too ) . 
  am i in `` western europe '' ? 
  anyway , i can answer for my hometown : it 's where all the strawberry pickers come from . 
  the fields are full of them in the summer . 
  -- i do n't think we have a `` the women are hot '' stereotype though , i 'd argue the other way around , but not too sure if that 's a general perception or just me . 
  cheap workers , you can hire some poles or lithuanians or whatever to build your house for like 1/3 of any swedish company , but it might end up a bit half-assed . 
  some of them doing cleaning and other `` simple '' jobs like that too ( strawberry picking ) . 
  for the countries themselves i think our stereotypes are in line with the rest of w europe , grey depressing commieblocks , or something like that . 
  [ here 's an example of a slightly over the top stereotypical swedish accent ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmciet-vnha ) , maybe not the best link , but the only thing i could think of right now . 
  most swedish people you would have heard do n't have a very heavy accent though . 
   i 'm not actually sure , but i do n't think the german compound word system is used in swedish or norwegian for example i think it is . 
  according to guinness world records the longest word in swedish is : `` nordv\u00e4stersj\u00f6kustartilleriflygspaningssimulatoranl\u00e4ggningsmaterielunderh\u00e5llsuppf\u00f6ljningssystemdiskussionsinl\u00e4ggsf\u00f6rberedelsearbeten '' which i can confirm is technically a word , but it 's not like anyone would ever use that , and you can probably quite easily build a longer one if you want . 
  great to hear , haha . 
  too bad speaking english with a swedish accent sounds awful . 
  same . 
  it 's a bit sad , i grew up just two hours from copenhagen , would like to know danish better . 
  at least i can understand norwegian , i think you guys can as well , right ? 
  it 's like a little bit of both our languages , haha . 
  indeed . 
  funny how one of the biggest swedish songwriters where actually dutch . 
   dutch flair do you disagree though ? 
  i 'm not french , but it pretty much always sounds great , at least when sung . 
  danish ... 
  i thought it might be easier to understand when sung , but nope , still barely understand a word :(, 
  imperiets video is so awful , haha . 
  these might not qualify as `` making swedish sound beautiful '' , that 's really hard for me to tell ( does swedish sound ugly normally ? ) . 
  but they are at least ( imo ) beautiful songs in swedish : [ cornelis vreeswijk - somliga g\u00e5r med trasiga skor ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwhxsqol_v0 ) [ kent - mannen i den vita hatten ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvs4u6bbjha ) [ jonathan johansson - aldrig ensam ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbwh5929cic ) we have lots of great music , sadly a lot of artists tend to sing in english , which is understandable , a lot of them do break through internationally after all . 
  but i prefer swedish , i feel like i appreciate the lyrics more that way . 
  -- edit : only posted male singers , so thought i 'd add at least one girl too : [ veronica maggio - sergels torg ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-_uqvsolqq ), 
  no idea . 
  some people say they 're all gypsies , some say there are a lot of `` normal '' people too . 
  they come here to beg on the streets , lot more money to be earned here than in their homelands i suppose . 
  they tend to write that they are bulgarian or romanian on the signs some of them hold , but that does n't really say much . 
  and i do n't know if they all live in tent camps or how it works , but they do exist . 
  true . 
  i knew that once , maybe i 'll remember it this time . 
  that would be interesting , but is n't really fit for an / r/askeurope thread . 
  best we could do is dig up some article on the internet where they have gathered a bunch of statistics like that , and i 'm not sure anyone here is really willing to go looking for that on your behalf . 
  also , it 's like doing that with `` an average north american '' , the category includes massively different countries like canada and mexico . 
  doing an average is n't going to tell you much . 
  [ here 's something ] ( http://www.euronews.com/2015/12/14/how-close-are-you-to-being-the-average-european ) , not much to do with standard of living and only in the eu . 
  but what do you want answered then ? 
  because for most of europe differences in `` standard of living '' is things like how big your house/apartment is , how close to work/the city centre you live , how often you can go travelling , how much free time you have , and so on . 
  none of that is easy to measure , and you wo n't get a comprehensive answer from reddit . 
  there are people living in tents though . 
  some romanians and bulgarians here in sweden anyway . 
  you went to possibly the poorest country in europe ( except moldova i guess ) , and there where only `` some houses '' in a village who did n't have running water . 
  to give you a sense of the economical differences , the uk ( representing western europe ) has 5 times higher gdp per capita than ukraine ( with ppp ) or more than 20 times higher ( nominal ) . 
  ukraine is on a similar level to a lot of subsaharan african countries . 
  so , not a very good representation of the average in europe . 
  there is a pretty big economical difference between the old western and eastern europe as a whole ( but ukraine is poor even by eastern european standards ) , but even then it does n't really affect things like running water , that 's standard pretty much everywhere . 
  [ i think hdi could be used as an indicator for basic living standards ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_development_index#/media/file:2014_un_human_development_report_quartiles.svg ), 
  that 's only northern sweden . 
  and even then i 'm not sure why anyone would recommend that . 
  i 've never had it , not even seen it in shops or anything . 
  weird , i think it 's the most popular 3rd language here . 
  probably due to how similar it is to swedish , it 's perceived as easy when starting out , but then when you hit the grammar it gets crazy , or so i 've been told .
