  ( although it 's probably a good idea anyway , just in case ) . 
  i live in gothenburg , which admittedly is a fairly large city by nordic standards , but in the last 2 years i 've never had to use cash except in one pub , but they have an atm inside the pub , so no big deal . 
  define `` relevant '' ? 
  the norwegians definitely did their part . 
  swedes were n't relevant for western europe , they mostly headed east instead . 
  russia is actually named after them . 
  the varangian guard in constantinople tended to be swedes too , for what it 's worth . 
  either way , the area i come from used to be danish , so i 'm fine with either . 
  you 're right . 
  do n't forget helsingborg either , and if you want some nature [ s\u00f6der\u00e5sen ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/s%c3%b6der%c3%a5sen ) or [ kullen ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/kullaberg ) is n't far away . 
  oh , i definitely did n't think about it that way . 
  thanks for writing that , 
  i ca n't really do anything if it 's 30 + , but the beach or any water really would probably be top priority at that point . 
  we do n't have ac btw , so staying inside when it gets hot is n't really a good option if you want to stay cool . 
  not really . 
  i 'm not particularly read up on the subject , but i 'm fairly certain there 's no perfect correlation between crime reported in general and rapes reported . 
  sweden still has a lot of unreported cases , as does every country on earth , a lot more than most other crimes , that 's the whole point , you ca n't read the actual number of rapes committed out of a statistic about rapes reported . 
  you can most likely read up on swedens situation here if you want : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rape_in_sweden, 
  lund is a cool city , but what 's really to see there except the church ? 
  it 's more like a few hour stop than any real destination , from what i 've seen anyway . 
  that 's unusually cold . 
  unless latvia is massively different than sweden ( i do n't think so ) slightly above 20 is considered normal in the summer , and heatwaves bring it closer to 30 . 
  enough to go to the beach anyway . 
  -- yeah , average high temperature in june-july-august in riga is 20-21 . 
  so temperatures both below and above that can be expected . 
  record high is 34 . 
  -- water might be a bit cold though , but the baltic is shallow and warms up pretty quickly . 
  we are though . 
  i mean , we do n't go out and pillage europe anymore , but we are still basically the same people . 
  and our country definitely has its roots in the viking era . 
  there was n't some special point in history were we suddenly stopped being `` vikings '' ( as in the people , not the occupation ) , we just changed gradually until we became what we are today . 
   not a stereotype , but ikea that i do n't mind too much . 
  i mean , i do n't blame people for associating sweden with ikea , it is extremely swedish . 
  the rest is the same things i would say . 
  `` beautiful women '' is probably the most common stereotype , but i do n't think anyone mind that . 
  that you drink a lot of vodka ? 
  or is my life a lie ? 
  also the fact that higher amount of reported rape cases might be a good thing . 
  since it 's a pretty well established fact that rape is a crime that extremely often goes unreported . 
  the north is cold , dark , and overall not a very nice place to live . 
  we had to work hard and invent new ways to make our situation bearable . 
  you guys already had fairly good lives , so you were usually more than happy for things to just continue as they always had . 
  when building an economy the former is usually the `` winning '' approach . 
  ( in other areas of life , maybe not so much ) that 's my take on it anyway . 
  because we still come to your countries for the climate , history and art , just not the job opportunities . 
  i would n't want to move either if i had a homeland as beautiful as greece : /, 
  the baltic shield is the oldest bedrock in europe ( and among the oldest in the world ) . 
  the scandinavian mountain range is also quite old , which is why they tend to be fairly rounded in shape , not very pointed like newer ranges like the alps or himalaya . 
  but scandinavia has changed a lot lately , the glaciations over the past couple of million years has repeatedly covered and uncovered the land with kilometer thick glaciers , the last one withdrawing only 10 000 or so years ago . 
  they both carved the land when `` flowing '' over it , and weighed it down , which is why areas in the northern baltic sea are still rising considerably every year . 
  very similar to what we see on greenland right now . 
  the article does n't answer my question . 
  i do n't think this phenomenon is exclusive to eastern europe . 
  and i 'm pretty sure i 've seen articles about equipment sold to the saudis `` legitimately '' being used in syria as well . 
   instead i seem to have struck a nerve with a bunch of e europeans with inferiority complexes who have no clue about what has been going when it comes to syria and weapons . 
  it looks more like you 're very naive towards how much stuff is coming from western europe as well . 
  from the article :  gabriel openly addressed instances in which recipients had illegally passed on weapons imported from germany . 
  these too have turned up in war zones . 
  not much . 
  the western european eu countries exports way more weapons to the saudis than eastern europe . 
  they do n't want to shut down any trade . 
  do you have any sources to back what you 're saying up ? 
  that eastern europe are the only ones selling `` shitty small arms '' and they are the only ones ending up outside of saudi arabia ? 
  for sweden in general : get on a boat out to one of our many archipelagos . 
  it 's probably the most uniquely swedish nature we have . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stockholm_archipelago https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/archipelago_of_gothenburg but there are a bunch of others , all similar . 
  most of our coastline is sort of like that . 
  this is also true for finland , they have the same thing . 
  -- for eastern sk\u00e5ne ( southern tip of sweden ) : if you for some reason feel like going to a beach . 
  [ this one is really nice , and there is rarely a lot of people there ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rty4rslgysc ) , sorry about the military footage , it is a military practice field , but you 're allowed in there when they are n't doing stuff . 
  you can also find quite a lot of amber on the beach after storms , if you think that 's fun , my mum likes it anyway . 
  not anything particularly spectacular , but probably the most `` off the beaten path '' thing i could recommend around here . 
  that entire area of sk\u00e5ne is pretty nice too , but quite touristy , for sweden anyway . 
  reykjavik would be somewhere around the 3rd largest city in denmark . 
  4th in sweden . 
  it is small for a capital city , but it 's not a small city by nordic standards . 
  true , did well up until that winter though . 
  one of the most used tricks of the swedish army at that time was to do surprise marches in the middle of the winter when everyone else was staying in winter camps . 
  [ crushed the russian army by the help of a blizzard early on in that same war too ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_narva_\\ ( 1700 \\ ) ) . 
  except https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_northern_war ( almost had them ... coldest winter in recorded european history sort of fucked up the invasion though . 
  never invade russia in winter , and so on . ), 
  and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_war i think those are the only two wars where russia threatened/invaded the swedish mainland . 
  i doubt that 's the case here seeing sweden 's extremely low number . 
  our military is very capable at most things it does , the only problem is that `` what it does '' does n't really include defending our country . 
  meanwhile in sweden : `` well , they have to get through finland first , we 'll be fine . '', 
  there are generally two different categorisations . 
  it 's either just west/east ( cold war borders ) , or you add in more regions , like central europe . 
  if there is a central european region germany is pretty much always in it , together with austria , czechia , poland and slovakia , usually hungary and schweiz too . 
  still managed to trigger the baltics , haha . 
  why not both ? 
  just like how scandinavia can be considered both northern and western europe in different situations ? 
  the only really clear split in europe that most can agree on is the [ west/east split ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/europe-blocs-49-89x4.svg ) from the cold war . 
  other than that what regions are used changes between different organisations . 
  the baltic states can be both northern or eastern in different situations , even central sometimes . 
  just visiting monaco does n't cost anything . 
  you obviously do n't need to stay * in * monaco to visit , the country is like 2km across , just stay in france and make a day-trip there or something . 
  i 'm not sure what 's to see there though , we mostly just looked at all the expensive cars driving around when we were there ( saw a porsche 918 for example ) . 
  that part of france surrounding it is nice though ( but packed full of tourists ) . 
  but historical and cultural heritage is usually not defined by genetics . 
  like in pretty much every other country , trucks and cars replaced the railroads in the mid 20th century , there was n't as much need for them any more .
