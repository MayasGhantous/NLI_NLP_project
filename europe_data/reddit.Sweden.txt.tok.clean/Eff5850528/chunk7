  was also a need to replace the old narrow-gauge railways , so it was n't so much a case of shutting down rail-lines as they just did n't update them to a modern standard , and so they got abandoned instead . 
  the current system is obviously much higher quality than in 1910 , just less connections . 
  increasing oil prices might make trains more popular again . 
  at least i hope it will , i do n't have a car so always take the train when going out of town . 
   it 's since been converted into a public walkway . 
  did the same around where i grew up in sweden , so we have some really long bike paths going straight through the forests here now . 
  also used as cross country ski tracks in the winter :d, 
  sweden too [ today ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/sweden_railways.png ) [ 1910 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/sverigesjarnvagar1910.png ), 
  you can come to scandinavia , do n't think it 's very dirty here . 
  smaller roads are still shit though , but that 's because of the cold . 
  if you want nice road surfaces i would suggest italy . 
  why did you think you would not be able to sunbath in sweden ? 
  more blood than usual . 
  that one is the flower of sm\u00e5land btw . 
   even your own army says it can only defend one piece of land for less than a week . 
  so then what 's the difference ? 
  i 'm definitely not trying to bash on the polish military or anything . 
  i just do n't see how sweden is particularly exceptional in not being able to hold the borders for very long . 
  just curious , are the polish armed forces theoretically able to defend against an invasion by russia ? 
  draw an arbitrary line somewhere , like we do with all other borders . 
  few of the islands are inhabited so it 's really not a big deal . 
  [ this for example ] ( https://www.google.se/maps/place/%c3%85land/@60.1991296,19.8244688,9z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x468ae468c4e1eb19:0xcd43f68373428eed!8m2!3d60.1785247!4d19.9156105?hl=sv ) they had to draw a line somewhere anyway given the autonomous status of the region . 
  btw , not saying they should change it or anything , but if i was there 100 years ago i would probably have favoured sweden , but then i am very biased , haha . 
   after 1917 the residents of the islands worked towards having them ceded to sweden . 
  in 1919 a petition for secession from finland and integration with sweden was signed by 96.4 % of the voters on the islands , with over 95 % in favour , [ 12 ] although serious questions later arose regarding this extraordinarily high figure . 
  [ citation needed ] swedish nationalist sentiments had grown strong particularly as a result of the anti-swedish tendencies in finland and finnish nationalism fueled by finland 's struggle to retain its autonomy and resistance against russification . 
  the conflict between the swedish-speaking minority and the finnish-speaking majority on the mainland , prominent in finnish politics since the 1840s , contributed to the apprehension of the \u00c5land population about its future in finland . 
   finland , however , declined to cede the islands and instead offered them an autonomous status . 
  nevertheless , the residents did not approve the offer , and the dispute over the islands was submitted to the league of nations . 
  the latter decided that finland should retain sovereignty over the province but that the \u00c5land islands should be made an autonomous territory . 
  thus finland was obliged to ensure the residents of the \u00c5land islands the right to maintain the swedish language , as well as their own culture and local traditions . 
  at the same time , an international treaty established the neutral status of \u00c5land , prohibiting the placing of military installations or forces on the islands . 
  huh , did n't actually know it was an issue as late as that , thought it was all decided in the original peace with russia 100 years earlier . 
  and regarding the archipelago , it does n't actually make much of a difference except in winter when the sea can freeze ( i think ) , it 's still closer to the swedish mainland than the finnish , and the only practical way of getting there is by boat or airplane , so if there are islands on the way does n't really matter . 
  not any more . 
  in sweden anyway . 
  no , but they ca n't ban skirts for men and then allow it for women ( that would be illegal ) . 
  question is why they do n't just allow them to wear shorts in the first place , it 's not like it looks worse than wearing a skirt . 
  swamp football/rugby is popular with orienteerers in sweden too :d great fun , and insanely tough . 
  we do swamp intervals too , which is more proper training . 
  i 'm not sure there is any tougher way to run , hill running is pretty bad , but swamps are way worse . 
  no , [ it 's because of russians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_war ) , and the somewhat incompetent swedish army/leaders . 
  [ acceptable attempt i guess ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ukvoduj.png ) , i think i got the most important bits anyway , like the right amount of islands in the right places , sort of . 
  the whole thing is not shaped right though , but in my defence i would have just as much problem drawing an accurate shape of sweden . 
  in swedish ` fitta ' is ` cunt ' . 
  so ` fitting ' would be cunting , i guess . 
  stockholm is more expensive , and not on the list either . 
  22 for city centre and 36 for outside . 
  so still not close to london . 
  stockholm city centre would be around 22 , outside city centre 36 . http://www.numbeo.com/property-investment/city_result.jsp?country=sweden&amp;city=stockholm comparing on that site , very close to paris prices . 
  i actually really enjoyed the summer weather in scotland when i was there . 
  even though it rained at least once every day that did n't matter too much in summer , it just made the air feel `` fresh '' or something like that . 
  and for just walking around and sightseeing 18 degrees or so is perfect imo . 
  was there for an orienteering competition though , and that got a bit wet , but i 'm used to that , haha . 
  was some cool maps though . 
  stockholm is actually warmer right now than most of southern sweden . 
  25 is nice , hope we 'll get that too . 
  right now i thought we had very similar weather ? 
  18 degrees and partly cloudy here in gothenburg , maybe different where you are , stockholm ? 
  we have 3 kinds of summer weather in southern sweden . 
  it 's either `` mild '' air coming in from the atlantic , what you guys have in scotland all the time . 
  not very warm and lots of rain , that 's the most common type here as well . 
  or we have dry air coming in from russia , i 'm not sure how common that is during summer , but since it happens in winter ( what causes most of our cold spells ) i 'm guessing it happens in summer too . 
  and lastly we have warm air coming up from southern europe and africa , which is what causes heatwaves . 
  had one of those for a week or so in may , up to 30 degrees . 
  will likely have another one before the end of summer , tends to get a week or so in july/august . 
  anyway , we definitely have more variance than scotland , but most of the time it 's very similar to you , has been for a month or so now for example , not a single day with totally clear skies , and from what i 've seen never above like 23 degrees , at least here in gothenburg . 
  and pretty much always at risk of rain . 
  but if it 's 0 and raining everything gets wet and muddy . 
  it 's also a lot brighter outside if there is a proper snow cover , without it the night ( which is most of the day ) gets extremely dark . 
  i also for some reason associate 0 and raining a lot more with windy weather than -20 or whatever , which obviously would make a huge difference , maybe that 's why . 
  you got me . 
  i was skiing in \u00c5re over new years a few years back , -32 two of the days . 
  only a few of us went outside that day , but got back to the cabin in under an hour because it was too damn cold , haha . 
  that cold just goes straight through even relatively thick winter clothes . 
  so at least i 've experienced proper cold once , 
  yeah , southern sweden and scotland have similar weather ( on a similar latitude too ) , except it rains more in scotland on average ( although east coast scotland is the same as west coast sweden ) . 
  nevermind , looked up some data , and sweden is consistently a few degrees colder . 
  summers are similar though , maybe a bit warmer in sweden . 
  so yeah , definitely more oceanic climate in scotland , but it 's not a huge difference ( except the west coast which has insane amounts of rain ) . 
  same as southern sweden , but we get a few weeks each winter when it snows . 
  not like an entire month though , just a few cold days , then the snow melts and turns everything into mud and then it freezes a week or so later for a few days , then melts again , and so on . 
  it can shift daily between snowing and raining , makes things very messy . 
  the actual cold days of the winter are pretty nice though . 
  -5 to -10 ish . 
  it 's when it 's around 0 and raining that it 's the worst .

  it 's a military coup . 
  the military takes the power , after that it 's very uncertain what will happen . 
  they also need to seize power first too , a lot can ( and probably will ) happen before the country is stable enough to hold a potential election . 
   but if they go outside their interests then that is punishment . 
  so where in the article are they saying that they should do that ? 
  ok . is that a yes or a no ? 
  yeah , so you get back your right , but you also loose the benefits . 
  is that punishment ? 
   i think english has 30,000 more commonly used words than german . 
  depends on how you count them . 
  you have a lot more specific words than most other languages . 
  but other germanic languages ( german or scandinavian for example ) uses `` combined '' words to replace your specific ones , making the number of possible words almost infinite . 
  as an example ( off the top of my head ) , you say `` hospital '' in english , but in swedish ( and i think german ) we call it something like `` sick-house '' , which technically is n't a new word in itself , just a combination of two previous ones .
