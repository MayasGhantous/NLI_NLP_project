you have no idea . 
  well ... 
  yes . 
  got anything except the obvious to add ? 
   `` europeans killed jews and then gave them the land of the arabs as compensation and thus the state of israel and war in the middle east was born '' i never said that . 
  i beg to differ , generalizations serve their purpose . 
  it quickly identifies the likelihood of some basic characteristics for whatever . 
  if someone says `` i 'm a feminist '' for example , i 'm going to equate the likelihood of that person thinking about women rights and the patriarchy a lot more than the general person . 
  if someone says that they 're a republican i 'm going to assume that they 're for a set of ideals and moral code that guides their political decisions . 
  if someone says that they 're christian i 'm going to assume that they believe in some form a deity , it should be an all-father but nowadays many theists claim to be something and when you question them they turn out to be pantheists . 
  so , if someone says that they 're american and republican and christian , i 'm going to make some general assumptions , which more often than not turn out to be correct . 
  so , no !, 
  generalization is n't bad , just like technology or statistics are n't bad . 
  they may be used badly or with bad motives to mislead , but when used correctly they paint a picture of the whole . 
  in social sciences it is often recommended that you use both quantitative and qualitative data to get the best picture of something . 
  when you put them in isolation they do n't really say much about a situation . 
   how would you feel if i do n't think empathy is the most effective argument here ... 
  in fact i do n't think anyone is going to tell / u/shadowbannedfu anything about how the world works . 
   were they the only ones voting for this ? 
  [ they were the only ones voting for it ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_partition_plan_for_palestine#against.2c_.2813_countries.2c_28.25_of_voting.29 ) . 
  maybe not in france ? 
  after ww2 the un felt very sorry for the jews and thought that giving them a land of their own might make some amends . 
  [ proposals for a jewish state ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/proposals_for_a_jewish_state ) had been made through the years with both madagascar and japan among others as suggestions for the creation of the jewish state . 
  so , in 1947 the [ united nations partition plan for palestine ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_partition_plan_for_palestine ) was adopted that basically stated that the jews were to be given a part of palestine when the [ british mandate for palestine ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_mandate_for_palestine_ ( legal_instrument ) ended in 1948 . 
  that 's because it was developed nations that caused this mess to begin with , it takes a lot from a government to basically say `` we 're sorry for fucking up and allowing all of this suffering '' ... also , the us is heavily in bed with israel and they 'll be damned before anyone badmouths their lover . 
  so everybody is just really cautious to call israel a whore in front of us because he 'd get angry ... 
  you do know that name-calling does n't help your argument , right ? 
  i ca n't believe that you 're not a negative karma troll !, 
  do you need a hug ? 
  well ... now i 've got to ask . 
  what made you question it , and what conclusion did you reach that made you revert to your original thinking ? 
  i 'm not going to kill you !, 
  :d eh , fuck it !, 
  you go on and do your god-thing , but i do think that it has way more draw backs for humanity than perks ... 
  but i do n't really have the energy to argue religion today ... 
  but have you ever questioned it ? 
  and by that i do n't mean with someone who 's religious but with someone who is n't . 
  / r/atheism * can * be perceived as toxic , but if you 're ever up for questioning your core beliefs you could do that on / r/trueatheism , / r/exchristian or any other r/ex-religion subreddit that you happen to subscribe to and get their point of view on why they no longer believe . 
  anyway , have a good one !, 
  just checked 3-4 pages of your history and i 'd say that you 're doing quite well imo . 
  but it 's different with bluntness on the web compared to real life . 
  it 's much easier to argue with strangers anonymously because it does n't affect your personal relationships with people . 
  for example , i find it much easier to argue religion ( i 'm anti-theist ) with strangers and being blunt about what i think about religion . 
  but when i do it in real life i 'm always a bit more careful to not make enemies or really hurt people . 
  because that will only make them see me as an idiot and then they wo n't listen to anything that i have to say . 
  so i make baby steps , get a feel for the person first and see how hard i can push things . 
  so that i do n't push them away , but still push them in the direction of ( what i think is ) reason . 
   i do agree that i am usually much more blunt than older people , but i do n't think that 's necessarily a bad thing . 
  i do n't think that bluntness is necessarily a bad thing either . 
  i can be quite blunt and provocative at times . 
  but with time you 'll get better and better on deciding when to be blunt and how blunt to be to achieve what you want with that bluntness . 
  for example : sometimes being too blunt can push people further away from you or the position that you 're arguing/debating for . 
  which defeats the purpose of what you 're trying to do , which is to make them see your point of view . 
  would you say that you prefer to hang out with people younger than you , older or the same age ? 
  i 'm sure that you are a quite mature 16 year old person . 
  but learning things takes time and experience . 
  look back at the 12 year old you and you 'll notice some differences , the same will be true about 16 year old you in 4 years . 
  we , as humans , mostly think that we are complete as we are in the present . 
  and we mostly cringe at our past selves for the things that we can no longer relate to . 
  if you keep growing as a person ( something that i highly suggest that people should do throughout their entire lives ) you wo n't ever be done with who you are . 
  of course there are ignorant people of all ages , genders and ethnicities and if you cherry-pick examples based on your own experience you can justify anything and come to any conclusion . 
  i 'm 28 and i also thought that i was done at 16 , that all i had left to do was collect knowledge and that i knew * who * i was and that that would never change . 
  i thought the same thing at the age of 18 , that i had ridden myself from the flaws that 16 year old me had and that i was done . 
  and so it continued until i realized that , yes age does n't have much to do with it when it comes to me personally because i was `` better '' than many old people . 
  but age had affected me for every year that went on , and i see it in all my friends too . 
  not all good change , many became more bigoted when they could have gone the other way . 
  but most have become more nuanced and are able to think and reason in ways that they , we , were n't before . 
  ** tl ; dr ** there are many young people who are smarter and wiser than old people , but age matters on the grand scale . 
   because he has one counter example ? 
  `` just that ** the arguments lifted in this conversation ** about how lobbying has effected the eu showed that that lobbying did n't work ... '' do you even read ? 
  yeah ... 
  i wonder what a reddit-site with an age limit of 25 ( that was able to guarantee it . 
  hypothetically , let 's not argue tech ) would look like ... 
  he 's not arguing that there is n't lobbying in the eu . 
  just that the arguments lifted in this conversation about how lobbying has effected the eu showed that * that * lobbying did n't work ... 
  but ... why am i even writing to you , you seem intent on misunderstanding . 
  many are . 
  many romas are indeed stateless , please check some of the sources i 've provided or do some research on this topic . 
  let 's not go on your lack of research on this topic as some kind of proof and just forget the already forgotten . 
  please check some of my newly added links and then come back and speak for a bunch of nations . 
  as a bonus : http://www.nationalityforall.org/czech-republic, 
  let 's just say that it 's really complicated ... ww2 , the fall of the soviet union and many , many other factors are at play . 
  i honestly have n't researched this * that * closely , i just stumbled across the topic while doing a paper on stateless syrians in jordan . 
  but hey , i added a few links to my previous post since reddit was being a moron . 
  you could read up on those to get a better picture of it . 
  yeah , i agree . 
  apart from the history that / u/anarchisto mentioned , the * real * issue is their statelessness . 
  in most of the world , except the americas , people get their citizenship from one of their parents . 
  if your parents lack citizenship ( because their parents did ) you do n't gain one either . 
  which means that you are basically illegal . 
  you do n't have the right to school , health , voting , or basically identity , which means that you ca n't legally work , pay taxes or have a bank account ... statelessness really sucks and not much has happened in the last 50 years to improve this . 
  although the un is doing a mega-campaign starting this year , lasting a decade , to try to remedy this problem in the world . 
  source : am studying global studies with a focus on human rights . 
  ** edit ** : not all roma are stateless , but a large portion ( about 40 % ) are . 
  http://www.statelessness.eu/ ** edit2 ** : okay , everybody is saying that romas are n't stateless or that that 's such a small number that it does n't matter ... well ... did you even try google ? 
  http://lmgtfy.com/?q=roma+statelessness http://www.refworld.org/docid/4a7023c72.html http://www.statelessness.eu/search/node/roma http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/voices/trapped-limbo-italys-stateless-roma http://www.unhcr.org/4edcde676.html http://www.migration.ox.ac.uk/odp/stateless-diasporas.shtml http://www.nationalromacentrum.org/en/publications/research/roma-citizenship-statelessness-and-related-status-issues-in-europe http://www.trust.org/item/?map=interview-eu-governments-should-give-stateless-roma-citizenship-commissioner http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/nationality/speech%20commissioner%20of%20hr.pdf and this is just the very tip of it !, 
  for once i 'd really like to just say that ; reddit , sometimes you really do n't know what the hell you 're talking about and you should try some research before you comment !, 
  yeah ... you 're so civil ... 
  and there are vast cultural differences between many of these nations as well . 
  that 's like thinking that the us and mexico has about the same culture because they 're neighbors .
