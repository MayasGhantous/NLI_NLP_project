  what kind of money distribution do you mean ? 
  i do n't have any such numbers at hand , but i could take a look on a search engine ... are you coming from the standpoint that europe ( sweden in particular ) spends more cash on refugees and that our burden is therefore heavier than the burden of developing nations ? 
  i 'm `` sure '' that we spend more money in total , but in context to what we have we basically do n't do shit compared to neighboring countries of refugee sources . 
  just take a look at [ this map ] ( http://img.static.reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/171629-syrianrefugeesintheregion2014jan07-.png?itok=phnu8b3w ) and then look at each countries population and gdp and it becomes clear that we 're no real heroes in comparison to the already poor who have opened their countries for the needing . 
  we in the west often think that we 're the ones pulling the heavey load when it comes to refugees , [ when in fact 86 % of all refugees flee to developing countries . 
  ] ( http://youtu.be/1bxakbcyjpo?list=uuauuunt6odekwe6v1ngqxug ) jordan by itself has taken more * syrian * refugees than all the eu countries combined in 2013 according to op 's graph ... 
  my bad . 
  i think that you 're being downvoted because the law really sucks . 
  i ca n't believe that they used cubic decimeters to define this !, 
  they should have just defined the liter as 10 cubic centimeters , which they did n't . 
  seriously , just about anybody today can write a better law for this in a single evening using google and ctrl + c/ctrl + v. 
  i very much disagree with this ( am also swedish ) . 
  the former or current government will not be able to cope with what 's to come . 
  and neither will sd if that 's what you 're thinking . 
  the problem is n't that we always choose the wrong government , it 's that all structures of `` democracy '' in the world are in fact no democracies . 
  people do n't get a real say , instead we leave that to a few rulers who do n't have any connection to the real harsh world that most live in . 
  wow ... 
  i 'm surprised that i 'm surprised . 
  meh , ** everybody ** is ruled by idiots these days . 
  it 's going to get worse before we make it better . 
  no i could n't .

  well , could you be a bit more specific ? 
  maybe provide a link even ? 
  why oh why would you ever do that !, 
  thank you for this sobering comment on the issue ( s ) . 
  you 're such an american !, 
  noooo !, 
  not a christian immigrant !, 
  who can we trust now ? 
  i 'm kinda betting that i 'm the only one who 's read this wikipedia article ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/types_of_socialism, 
  lets not accept more immigrants , that 's the solution !, 
  yes , i agree . 
  i also think that people who we have agreed to let stay in our countries deserve social security . 
  on what basis do you judge if someone is * worthy * of social security ? 
  and each country can deny any treaty or have as many reservations as they like and not abide to paragraph 1-29 on a 30 paragraph treaty . 
  but , never mind that . 
  it 's the immigrants ' fault that we as nations chose this . 
  should people who never had a job ( and therefore never paid taxes ) not be eligible ? 
  maybe you 're thinking that the parents paid tax , if so what about orphans ? 
  i 'm male , kind of a big guy . 
  my ex is quite small . 
  i 've never lain a hand on her . 
  but the day we broke up she jumped onto me which caused me to fall back onto the floor and just started pounding my chest all she could . 
  as i lay there in chock about the current events i realized that i was completely powerless to do anything about it , except use physical force back . 
  that was n't an option . 
  so i `` let '' her hit me all she could until she was exhausted and then looked at her and for the first time called her a cunt and told her to get off me . 
  which she did . 
  she starts crying ( nope , not a victim ) while i lecture her about what she 's done . 
  i was sore for days . 
  i have trust issues with women now , especially devoted feminists like her ... let 's not talk about the times when some women have got me stupidly drunk ( buying me drink after drink ) only to `` escort '' me home . 
  technically , i 've been raped and beaten by women , but because of the way i was raised and society i 'm almost unable to see it that way ... 
  they do , this is the first one . 
  title is misleading . 
  all other are women-only . 
  see my explanation ( which basically says the same thing ) [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3iggus/sweden_the_first_rape_emergency_room_for_men/cugoo00 ), 
  oh , come on !? 
  am i really the first to point out that the title is misleading ? 
  it makes it sound like this is a men-only emergency ward , * while in fact it is the first to * ** also ** * accept men and boys * . 
  so , this is the first rape emergency ward that is n't ** women-only ** . 
  are you offended ? 
   also ** if ** evangelical christians practise ostracizim with people who think differently how about yourself ? 
  are you willfully ignorant or just ignorant about how evangelical christians tend to treat their kids if they turn away from religion or happen to be gay ? 
  i do n't [ ostracize ] ( http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ostracize ) groups as that 's not something that an individual can do . 
  i have some religious friends , their views tend to sway from mine though so i rarely hang out with theists . 
   how many evangelical christian friends do you have ? 
  a few , we tend to avoid theological debate though . 
  i even went to mass a year ago to see what it was about , it was full of tales about curing cancer and similar things . 
  people yelling hallelujah . 
  exactly what i expected , i was not moved or impressed . 
  keep in mind that you 're speaking to a swede and that evangelical christians are a rare breed here and that the majority of our population are n't religious . 
  i 've never been approached by a muslim recruiter . 
  and when i 've had theological conversations with muslim acquaintances ' ( i 'm anti-theist ) i 've never felt any fear and have always been able to speak my mind . 
  that said , i view the militantism in islam as a greater threat to global prosperity than christianity . 
  but in my opinion they are both based on equally ridiculous fantasies and wishful thinking . 
  they both punish apostasy , but one prefers death and the other ostracization ... clearly one is better than the other , but christianity is hardly harmless . 
  yeah , from one extreme to another . 
  i mean , sure , it is understood on some level for most . 
  but to actually have an original source ** from the man who invented the measurement ** is different . 
  when criticizing economics to economists comics is n't that good of a comeback , a name like simon kuznets is . 
  the best thing wikipedia taught me about economics is that gdp was never meant as a measurement for the welfare of a nation . 
  it made me go back and look at original sources about the first report on gdp ( gnp actually ) and what the creator of the measurement ( simon kuznets ) had to say about its flaws . 
  something that was never reflected in my university curriculum more than in passing and never with original sources . 
   the valuable capacity of the human mind to simplify a complex situation in a compact characterization becomes dangerous when not controlled in terms of definitely stated criteria . 
  with quantitative measurements especially , the definiteness of the result suggests , often misleadingly , a precision and simplicity in the outlines of the object measured . 
  measurements of national income are subject to this type of illusion and resulting abuse , especially since they deal with matters that are the center of conflict of opposing social groups where the effectiveness of an argument is often contingent upon oversimplification . 
  [ ... ]  all these qualifications upon estimates of national income as an index of productivity are just as important when income measurements are interpreted from the point of view of economic welfare . 
  but in the latter case additional difficulties will be suggested to anyone who wants to penetrate below the surface of total figures and market values . 
  economic welfare can not be adequately measured unless the personal distribution of income is known . 
  and no income measurement undertakes to estimate the reverse side of income , that is , the intensity and unpleasantness of effort going into the earning of income . 
  the welfare of a nation can , therefore , scarcely be inferred from a measurement of national income as defined above . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gross_domestic_product#cite_note-kuznets-6 https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/scribd/?title_id=971&amp;filepath=/docs/publications/natincome_1934/19340104_nationalinc.pdf#scribd-open so yeah , i think you can learn a lot from wikipedia that you would n't otherwise , even at the higher levels of education . 
   people who were known and closely monitored by surveillance services . 
  are n't we all ? 
  no , it 's because cognitive bias of reporters and stuff ( and `` better '' headlines ) tend to select those stories over the common ones . 
  the only time ethnicity is reported is when it is n't the most common ethnicity in a country . 
  if it 's a white male for example ( in a predominantly white country ) it will only read `` man ... '' . 
   care of the russian people is up to the russian government . 
  i would agree with this if i thought that the russian people had the ultimate control over their government and that it was n't the other way around . 
   but let 's not pretend that the russian government acts completely disconnected from a people which does n't want a thing to do with it .
