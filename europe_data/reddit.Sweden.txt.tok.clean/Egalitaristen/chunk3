  agreed . 
   the american government is voted on in a democratic fashion . 
  um , i think you 're one of the few who thinks that their political system is democratic . 
   free and independent information in all kinds of languages is only a mouse-click away . 
  yeah , so is misinformation and propaganda . 
  especially in the places we 're talking about . 
  yeah , and just like with the us , it 's unfair to punish the people for bad government . 
  do you really think that it would be good for anyone if russia reverted back to communism ? 
  there are plenty who would `` give a fuck '' about that ... 
  ** yeah !!!, 
  ** let 's punish the russian people for their government !, 
  they should all suffer , who cares . 
  and , what message is he trying to send ? 
  had some excellent * fika * !, 
   kinda taints that nice rosy picture a bit ... 
  it sure does . 
  [ this song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzirytrhbjw ) is spot on . 
  yeah , ~ ~ 206 ~ ~ 201 years ago lastly . 
  about ~ ~ 33 ~ ~ 28 years after 1776 . 
  edit : forgot norway , changed numbers . 
  if society gave a fuck about people they would n't have to turn into criminals and/or re-offend . 
  for a white supremacist i 'm sure that what you just said is just confirmation that white people are better . 
  i do n't think stormfronters are drawn to titles like this one ... 
  well , every murder is one too many ... 
  but our rate/capita is almost half of that of crotia for example . 
  only if the one making the claim is n't american . 
  americans can bash the us all they want , but show that you 're foreign and even the libertarians will take personal offense to legitimate worries about how their government acts . 
  strange , is n't it . 
  yep . 
  the us has nearly 5 % of the world population and account for about 25 % all inmates globally . 
  and as you said , they have about 8 times as many as china per capita ... `` something '' is off indeed . 
   i think there 's something off about that . 
  i agree ... 
  but in what way do you think something 's off ? 
  oh , you went * technical * . 
  i see . 
   `` being gay '' has never been a crime . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but you claim that homosexuality was never illegal in the uk ? 
  and i link a wikipedia article about the ** decriminalization of homosexuality ** in the uk . 
  are you interpreting the decriminalization as proof that it was never illegal ? 
  ^ ^ that ^ ^ would ^ ^ be ^ ^ strange anyway , have a read . 
   for most people the sixties was a time of sexual awakening and experimentation . 
  but it was n't until 1967 that gay and bisexual men could share that freedom . 
  on the 40th anniversary of the decriminalisation of homosexuality , we revisit the appallingly repressive atmosphere of the fifties and sixties that ruined lives , destroyed reputations and finally sparked a campaign for change http://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/jun/24/communities.gayrights, 
  well yes . 
  i 'm sure that the identity is already available on flashback . 
  i guess that the * sexual offences act 1967 * is just made-up . 
   the sexual offences act 1967 is an act of parliament in the united kingdom ( citation 1967 c. 60 ) . 
  it decriminalised homosexual acts in private between two men , both of whom had to have attained the age of 21 . 
  the act applied only to england and wales and did not cover the merchant navy or the armed forces . 
  homosexuality was decriminalised in scotland by the criminal justice ( scotland ) act 1980 and in northern ireland by the homosexual offences ( northern ireland ) order 1982 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sexual_offences_act_1967, 
   a few hours early . 
  actually , we almost never release the identity of the accused or even the convicted . 
  it 's not in the interest of the public to know such details . 
  actually , we average 1 murder/week . 
  we do n't do such things here , or very rarely at least . 
  basically we do it for the same reasons that reddit has similar rules . 
  we do n't need witch hunts , it 's not in the public interest to know the identity and innocent until proven guilty , at which time our legal system takes care of that . 
  the public need n't bother with these details , does n't do any good . 
  i do n't think the ** norwegian ** , whose flair is `` homogeneous oil money '' needs to do that ... 
  i think that ( s ) he was taking the american perspective . 
  `` ca n't ever have enough oil '', 
   where has it `` been in place '' for 10 years ? 
  i mean , r2p is an idea/concept that dates back to the 90s , and as the wiki article you linked clearly states , it is `` a proposed norm and not a law '' . 
  the idea of r2p is old , yes . 
  when i say `` been in place '' , i was referring to the 2005 world summit . 
   as the iciss report was released in 2001 , right around the time of the second gulf war , many thought that would be the end of this new norm . 
  however , at the 2005 world summit , where the largest number of heads of state and government in the history of the un convened , the r2p was unanimously adopted . 
  the 4 cases i 'm referring to are : * kenya , 2007/2008 * ivory coast , 2011 * libya , 2011 * central african republic , 2013 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/responsibility_to_protect#in_practice additionally :  the security council has reaffirmed its commitment to the r2p in several resolutions . 
  the first such resolution came in april 2006 , when the security council reaffirmed the provisions of paragraphs 138 and 139 in resolution 1674 , formalizing their support for the r2p . 
  in 2009 , the council again recognized states ' primary responsibility to protect and reaffirmed paragraphs 138 and 139 in resolution 1894 . 
   additionally , the security council has mentioned the r2p in several country-specific resolutions :  * darfur : resolution 1706 in 2006  * libya : resolution 1970 , resolution 1973 in 2011 , resolution 2016 in 2011 , and resolution 2040 in 2012  * c\u00f4te d'ivoire : resolution 1975 in 2011  * yemen : resolution 2014 in 2011  * mali : resolution 2085 in 2012 and resolution 2100 in 2013  * sudan and south sudan : resolution 1996 in 2011 and resolution 2121 in 2013 on a side note , i do n't disagree with these interventions . 
  also ...  is delivered to the places we buy it from in trucks . 
  how do you think things are delivered in europe , by serfs walking the never-ending alleys we call roads ? 
  our infrastructure is set up for driving , but it 's also built for alternatives , like biking or walking . 
  our fuel prices also encourage the expansion of the later mentioned infrastructure and better public transport . 
  as long as your prices remain low you have no incentive to build additional infrastructure for anything but roads , which is n't good . 
  well , i did state that `` of course this is n't possible because they hold the biggest stick '' ... 
  i 'm not advocating a military invasion of the us , just pointing out that , logically ( in accordance with r2p ) , the eu seems to have a responsibility to protect the american population from its government . 
  obviously the r2p is used to protect the general population . 
  the intention would be to save lives , not kill . 
  help you guys get some freedom and democracy . 
  thank you !, 
  so , you recognize isis as a sovereign nation ? 
  anyway , i do n't see the point of this discussion . 
  isis is an oil producing country now ? 
  and i 'm in no way suggesting making enemies of the us , just like the us is n't an enemy of afghanistan but a friend that 's there to help . 
  `` very rarely '' , i 'm not sure how often they 'd have to do it for it to be frequent . 
  it 's been in place for 10 years and has been used 4 times since , and has been suggested more times but has been vetoed in the unsc . 
  it was the previous comment who lumped them together . 
  yes , basically they do lose their voting rights , and i too consider that undemocratic . 
  especially if you consider that almost 1 % ( 704/100 ,000 of adults ) of their population are at any point imprisoned and that they have the largest prison population in the world . 
  yeah , fuel should be more expensive in the us . 
  since we do this in europe to decrease emissions and to get public funds . 
  let 's not piss off isis , we should just let them do thing their own way . 
  as we should with the us , that will surely lead to a good world for everyone . 
  yeah , seriously . 
  the us is among the worst among industrialized countries in the world on human rights . 
   the united states has a vibrant civil society and strong constitutional protections for many basic rights . 
  yet , particularly in the areas of criminal justice , immigration , and national security , us laws and practices routinely violate rights .
