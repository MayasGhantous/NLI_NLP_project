  often , those least able to defend their rights in court or through the political process -- racial and ethnic minorities , immigrants , children , the poor , and prisoners -- are the people most likely to suffer abuses . 
  https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2015/country-chapters/united-states  tens of thousands of prisoners remained in isolation in state and federal prisons across the usa , confined to cells for between 22 and 24 hours a day in conditions of stark social and environmental deprivation . 
   in february , the senate judiciary subcommittee held a second hearing on solitary confinement . 
  senator durbin who chaired the hearing and urged reform of this practice , also pushed during the year for the opening of a new federal prison which would extend the number of federal isolation cells . 
  amnesty international 's report into federal use of isolation concluded that conditions in the only current super-maximum security prison in florence , colorado , breached standards for the humane treatment of prisoners . 
  https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/americas/united-states-of-america/report-united-states-of-america/ as a swede , i feel that the conditions in the us are so inhumane that an intervention would really be required , just like the us intervenes in other countries on the grounds of [ responsibility to protect ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/responsibility_to_protect ) , so should europe intervene in the us . 
  of course this is n't possible because they hold the biggest stick , but it would really be ** good ** for them to get a taste of their own medicine . 
  edit : grammar . 
  i was going to say that , the ** inequality-adjusted human development index ** is a much better measurement than hdi , and certainly better than gdp ( ppp adjusted ) . 
  i 'm a big fan of statistics , and lies since they tend to go hand in hand , and i 'm always looking for better ways to give an objective wholesome overview of a situation . 
  since we are discussing better ways to measure things i 'd really like to suggest the ** social progress index ** . 
  it measures a total of 52 indicators of well-being but does not concern itself with money or gdp . 
  it has its faults , as all statistics do , but it 's the best measurement i 've found so far . 
  http://www.socialprogressimperative.org/data/spi [ ted talk about it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8votwxx8a0 ), 
  i 'd like to point out that this says nothing about the distribution of wealth or the well-being of the population . 
  or , as the man who basically invented gdp said . 
   the valuable capacity of the human mind to simplify a complex situation in a compact characterization becomes dangerous when not controlled in terms of definitely stated criteria . 
  with quantitative measurements especially , the definiteness of the result suggests , often misleadingly , a precision and simplicity in the outlines of the object measured . 
  measurements of national income are subject to this type of illusion and resulting abuse , especially since they deal with matters that are the center of conflict of opposing social groups where the effectiveness of an argument is often contingent upon oversimplification . 
  [ ... ]  all these qualifications upon estimates of national income as an index of productivity are just as important when income measurements are interpreted from the point of view of economic welfare . 
  but in the latter case additional difficulties will be suggested to anyone who wants to penetrate below the surface of total figures and market values . 
  economic welfare can not be adequately measured unless the personal distribution of income is known . 
  and no income measurement undertakes to estimate the reverse side of income , that is , the intensity and unpleasantness of effort going into the earning of income . 
  ** the welfare of a nation can , therefore , scarcely be inferred from a measurement of national income as defined above .

  unions are a really good thing if done correctly , but i also understand americans who do n't like them because from what i gather they are as corrupt as your government . 
  these are some contributing reasons to why your regular joe still ca n't afford the basics while working a minimum wage job full time . 
  do n't forget about the present !, 
  at that point i would torch at least 2 buildings . 
  i know and agree . 
  thanks  i think it 's because i 'm late to comment and also that people will be satisfied with short answers that confirm their bias rather than read a * whole * article to gain a better understanding of basically anything .

   incompatible with human rights it 's okay , they created their own human rights and 58 states have signed it . 
  it basically looks like the universal one for the untrained eye , except that they put sharia law as the governing law in all questions . 
  [ cairo declaration on human rights in islam ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cairo_declaration_on_human_rights_in_islam ), 
  to add to that , the churches that are marked as cultural inheritance ( k-m\u00e4rkt ) , which is to say most , will still get funding from the state to keep them up to shape . 
  the church tax mainly adds to the salary of church staffs and for events , the church will claim that they do a lot of philanthropy but it 's not a big part of their total funding and you can do that better yourself .

  do your part ( if you have n't already ) and exit the church . 
  it also saves you about 3000kr/year since it 's the only optional tax we have ( at least in sweden ) . 
   human capital flight is an economics term equivalent to the sociology term , brain drain , which refers to the emigration of intelligent , well-educated individuals to somewhere for better pay or conditions , causing the place they came from to lose those skilled people , or `` brains . '',

   have you read * the precariat * ? 
  i have not , it 's on the list but not very high up there since i tend to disagree with a lot of smith 's views and i do n't think that it 's very applicable to today 's world .

  what 's sad is that kuznets ' criticism of the measurement he created is n't taught to economists and has all but been forgotten . 
  i took a course in national economics at university and the teacher made it seem like the measurement had more or less always existed . 
  there was criticism of the measurement in the literature , but those pointed to the limitations as minor faults and not fundamental . 
  the only reason i know about kuznets ' criticism is that i got pissed off and looked for the origin of the measurement on wikipedia since it was n't included anywhere in the curriculum . 
  wikipedia had taught me more than university ever has . 
  yes !, 
  let 's look at what the man who invented the measurement says about it . 
   the valuable capacity of the human mind to simplify a complex situation in a compact characterization becomes dangerous when not controlled in terms of definitely stated criteria . 
  with quantitative measurements especially , the definiteness of the result suggests , often misleadingly , a precision and simplicity in the outlines of the object measured . 
  measurements of national income are subject to this type of illusion and resulting abuse , especially since they deal with matters that are the center of conflict of opposing social groups where the effectiveness of an argument is often contingent upon oversimplification . 
  [ ... ]  all these qualifications upon estimates of national income as an index of productivity are just as important when income measurements are interpreted from the point of view of economic welfare . 
  but in the latter case additional difficulties will be suggested to anyone who wants to penetrate below the surface of total figures and market values . 
  economic welfare can not be adequately measured unless the personal distribution of income is known . 
  and no income measurement undertakes to estimate the reverse side of income , that is , the intensity and unpleasantness of effort going into the earning of income . 
  ** the welfare of a nation can , therefore , scarcely be inferred from a measurement of national income as defined above ** . 
  --  ** distinctions must be kept in mind between quantity and quality of growth , between costs and returns , and between the short and long run . 
  goals for more growth should specify more growth of what and for what . 
  ** http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gross_domestic_product#limitations_and_criticisms i do n't advocate communism either , but it is a poor measurement for determining the welfare of a nation . 
  that propaganda would be impossible even for the us .

  thank you germany !, 
   sexual assault and sexual harassment are not seperately defined true . 
   the line between sexual assault and rape has become more vague true . 
   therefore the line between sexual harassment and rape as well . 
  true , but this is where you 're wrong . 
  more things are counted as rape today that were n't before , and rape is not included in the definition of assault/harassment . 
  and therefore :  i doubt that rape counts as sexual harassment ... 
  i 'm right and you 're :  swedish police counts every rape into statistics . 
  wrong . 
  just so that we 're both on board . 
  the context : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2zqpb1/11_maps_and_charts_to_challenge_your_perceptions/cplrtlx?context=10000 so we were speaking about ** sexual harassment ** .
