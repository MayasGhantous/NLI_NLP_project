fine , with a few exceptions . 
  for instance , i do n't like how we import milk instead of making sure our own milk farmers get paid enough . 
  finns have quite distinct features . 
  something about the jaw . 
  used as opposed to `` flat '' . 
  not really . 
  the embarrassing dad used to be a thing i think , nowadays they try to portray parents three-dimensionally . 
  yep , i 'd rather be discreet around people that might take offense . 
  english and french , also did a little norwegian and danish in swedish class . 
  not exactly a problem , you want to avoid them of course . 
  american black bears are angrier than our brown bears . 
  on the whole , not much to complain about regarding how society works . 
  but there is still heartache , sickness , self doubt , boredom , lonelieness and cruelty . 
  top 100 . 
  no , but not unheard of either . 
  oops , read the title wrong !, 
  g\u00f6te / g\u00f6ta means `` person from g\u00f6taland '' ( southern sweden ) . 
  svea means `` swedish '' . 
  i have one that i bought in ny 20 years ago as a souvenir . 
  i know it 's a sports team . 
  i do n't wear the cap much these days , but if i did , it would be in memory of the trip . 
  i do n't think your family is average in this respect . 
  i 'm 38 and have been watching american tv shows my whole life , in addition to 9 years of english classes and 20 + years online . 
  my father ( 66 ) wrote his dissertation in english . 
  do you think people over 35 are ancient or something ? 
   i 'd double that - everyone 70 or younger took english for several years in school and have since been heavily exposed to the language . 
  while there are always a few non-speakers , and certainly varying levels of fluency , i 'd still say that anyone under 70 who does n't speak at least rudimentary english is seen as uneducated , ignorant or stupid , depending on the circumstances . 
  two popular swedish comic writers are [ martin kellerman ] ( http://www.comicsbeat.com/rocky-on-line/ ) and [ liv str\u00f6mquist ] ( http://www.topshelfcomix.com/ts2.0/whitney/ ) . 
  the linked comics should give you an idea . 
  not important at all . 
  they get to attend some dinners though . 
  `` comfortably '' for us ( sweden ) does not typically mean having only one parent working . 
  in my experience , most people want to work , but maybe cut hours once there are children ( work 30 hours a week or so ) . 
  which is totally feasible . 
  i actually am uncomfortable with non-speakers voting . 
  staying here , sure !, 
  more than welcome !, 
  affecting the political scene without being able to understand the discussions , please no . 
  yeah , but that 's an average . 
  if the op grew up in a wealthy area , most parents would have had kids later than average . 
  definitely not in medicine , but sometimes in science or it . 
  midwife , unless there are complications . 
  i 'd want a three or four day weekend at least . 
  a regular one is so short . 
  i 'd say anyone under 70 . 
  i trust they are honest but i do n't think they 're all competent . 
  or sometimes something short like bo ek . 
  in the major cities , yes . 
  yes , students have their own housing . 
  most students get their own place even if they do n't move out of town . 
  am i an irresponsible parent for being unwed ? 
  [ old ladies with scarves ] ( http://nystromska.weebly.com/uploads/9/9/8/7/9987079/7571201_orig.jpg ) is a thing of the past for swedish women ( i 'm 37 and have never seen it except on immigrants ) . 
  [ but this is common .

  but god rested on the seventh day . 
  same in sweden . 
  i even know some people who were n't happy first their first degree/career and went for a second one in their forties . 
  you 'll always have a home in sweden if need be , 
  fr\u00e4n = harsh/rank, 
  in addition to this , there are not that many jobs available for teenagers . 
  most employers prefer adults . 
  we swedes hug too . 
  i once greeted a foreigner with a hug , he went for the bise . 
  suddenly we were basically making out . 
  to be fair , we 'd probably maintain the historical castles even as a republic and the representation budget would be the same . 
  the ones i met in moscow were really sweet . 
  the paperwork is really no biggie and can be done during pregnancy . 
  i imagine the system works as it 's never about large sums of money . 
  why swindle anybody for $ 200 a month when there 's government aid anyway ? 
  at least a couple of times a week . 
  i guess it depends on how much i pay attention to others on my way to work . 
  leftovers from last night 's dinner . 
  in some parts of sweden , on holy wednesday , you put funny notes on other 's backs . 
  her face was on posters all over the country at the time , as it was right before the euro vote . 
  i feel old now ... 
  there is usually a theme . 
  the invitations typically match the decorations , flowers and maybe the tie .

  first case : tant/farbror ( `` aunt '' / uncle ) second case : nothing , we do n't address strangers like that . 
  i 'd relocate to my inlaws in a more rural area . 
  strangers are easier to spot there and we 'd have the options of fishing , hunting or even farming . 
  i always choose swedish words for variables to make them stick out . 
  on occasion , not always . 
  and sometimes we get drunk together !, 
  skadegl\u00e4dje in swedish . 
  that would be 15 ml . 
  yes !, 
  american teeth look like animal teeth . 
  - what 's the lumberjack 's phone number ? 
  - en en ( one one , also cade cade ) tr\u00e4 ( wood , sounds like tre = three ) fura ( pine , sounds like fyra = four ) en swedish, 
  i actually used cash a few days ago .
