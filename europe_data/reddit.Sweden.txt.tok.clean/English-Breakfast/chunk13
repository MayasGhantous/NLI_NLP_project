  [ source ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37183733 ) those are just two countries . 
  probably many more outdated examples in this map . 
  not sure what you mean . 
  shootings in general ? 
  trust me , there are shootings in every country . 
  terrorist incidents ? 
  well those are the biggest countries ... although several other smaller countries like belgium and sweden have also suffered from terrorism over the past few years . 
  heh , saw this earlier on / r/casualuk . 
  watching this video makes me happy . 
   the eu is europe . 
  no it is not . 
  latest updates from the bbc : ------------------------------------------------  the uk 's terror threat level has been raised to critical - meaning an attack is expected imminently - after 22 people were killed by a suicide bomber in manchester . 
   prime minister theresa may made the announcement after a meeting of cobra , the government 's crisis response committee , on tuesday evening . 
   the terror threat level had been severe - meaning an attack was highly likely - since 2014 . 
  ------------------------------------------------  it is possible that there is a `` wider group of individuals '' responsible for the manchester explosion which has killed 22 people , said prime minister theresa may . 
  ------------------------------------------------  members of the armed forces will be deployed across the uk as part of the raising of the uk 's terror level . 
   prime minister theresa may said members of the military would be under the command of the police as part of what is being called operation tempora . 
   armed forces personnel will be visible at `` big events '' such as football matches and concerts , she said . 
  ------------------------------------------------ very serious stuff indeed . 
  bulgaria bus bombing . 
  let 's hope it 's a misunderstanding like mentioned elsewhere . 
  most of us do n't want the euro and if this deadline became reality then it would become a big election issue . 
   wales has the same gdp per capita as romania , for example . 
  not even true . 
  wales has a gdp per capita between malta and spain . 
  more than 2.5 times the gdp per capita in romania ... 
  i sometimes wonder if people spouting this type of nonsense have ever even been to the uk . 
  i used to live in wales and while it 's among the poorest parts of the uk it 's hardly a backwater hellhole . 
  also , there are several countries in europe which are more dependant on their capital than london . 
  [ source ] ( https://www.iwkoeln.de/en/_storage/asset/296722/storage/iwm:r2-image-main-content/file/11547136/05715614.jpg ) this narrative that the uk is a third world country outside of london is a comfortable narrative for a lot of people on this sub who have an axe to grind , but it 's simply not true . 
  the guardian should stay ; they still do decent reporting even if they like making a mountain out of a molehill when it suits them . 
  however the independent is a 100 % clickbait awful source of news ; fast approaching huffington post levels . 
  should be added to the banned tabloid list in my opinion . 
  posting unemployment statistics is now doing the tories bidding . 
  so who gets most of these migrants ? 
  i 'm guessing population size is taken into account , but what about the amount of migrants already received by said country ? 
  does that play any role in this ? 
  i do n't know . 
  it 's weird because i have literally never thought of the eu as being the same as europe . 
  i have always seen europe as the mass of countries on the continent ; only on this sub have i seen some people insist the the eu * is * europe . 
  do n't know if it 's a spooky coincidence , but the fiber broadband company i work at in sweden just had almost our entire network go down . 
  it looks like suspicious activity brought it down too . 
  mutual interest like the other guy said . 
  i used to live in the uk so i care about them too . 
  i also want minimum disruption to the swedish economy . 
  i dont think a good trade deal is out of the question . 
  riiiiight, 
  ca n't really blame her . 
  she is young , and a prominent member in the front national . 
  must be a huge burden to bear . 
  it 's not worth it in my opinion . 
  if i was her i 'd quit too , and go enjoy my life outside politics . 
  it wo n't be cheaper than the current system . 
  whatever bureaucracy there is today does n't outweigh the costs of providing a basic income for every citizen instead of only those who need it . 
  most federalists here definitely are n't americans . 
  i do n't think you can pin down a certain nationality for supporting a federal eu on / r/europe . 
  either way they are over-represented here compared to the real world . 
  and yeah i 'm frankly tired with this obsession about / r/the _ donald . 
  / r/politicaldiscussion is decent . 
  very us centric and with a left wing slant but there is an ongoing discussion about the french election . 
  shame that the discussion is not too big simply because most of the subscribers are american . 
  i agree with you though , most political discussion on this website is awful beyond words . 
  i wonder how many french le pen supporters there are on reddit . 
  certainly a rare sight on this sub , although there are several like you in this thread . 
  so campaign funding laws may have been broken . 
  but then the author says that we ca n't let the referendum result stand because of targeted marketing and the influence it may have had . 
  do n't agree . 
  if so , where was the outrage when obama used big data in 2012 for his re-election ? 
  his campaign even called individual people knowing exactly what they could use to press their buttons . 
  it 's a bit spooky , sure . 
  welcome to the world of the internet where all our data is online . 
  however this excuse should n't be used to invalidate referendum/election results that you do n't like . 
  the uk wants as good of a trade deal as possible without being in the single market , that 's exactly what they want ... 
  the point of a fta is to ease trading as much as possible . 
  does n't mean that it 'll be tariff free for everything . 
  you might lower tariffs in some areas , remove in others etc. 
  free trade agreements are n't only about tariffs either . 
  the incoming agreement between the eu and canada reduces barriers in a lot of areas , but it obviously does n't remove every single barrier . 
  that 's what the single market is . 
  every trade barrier removed , including borders . 
   there are lots of people claiming that the uk does n't want free trade with the eu . 
  who is saying this ? 
  i have heard the exact opposite . 
   free trade can not happen without freedom of movement . 
  well , the uk ca n't be in the single market , that is true . 
  the concept of freedom of movement refers to the standard eu law that allows for the free movement of workers across borders . 
  same with goods , services and capital . 
  that 's what the single market is . 
  however the uk does not have to accept freedom of movement if they sign a fta with the eu . 
  nobody cares about easier travel for businessmen and tourists . 
  its the permanent right to stay that they have a problem with . 
  rugged and fallen out to a point not seen since the civil war ? 
  really ? 
  this article is sensationalist bullshit . 
  brussels will just try to milk this any way they can . 
  before you know it they 'll be throwing out 200bn . 
  let 's be honest , there is a big hole in the budget coming up when the uk leaves and in these times it 'll be a hard sell to any electorate that more of their money is needed to go to the eu . 
  sch\u00e4uble is already saying that germany wo n't be paying more towards the budget after brexit .

  i 'll nitpick here and say that your numbers on the economy are outdated .
