i 've added a link per your request . 
  if i remember correctly , there was an israeli leader with just the right attitude not a long time ago , but was promptly assassinated by a zionist . 
  edit : [ more on the topic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/assassination_of_yitzhak_rabin ), 
  such a pessimistic ( or realistic ? ), 
  approach . 
  i would like to point out the dissonance between our feelings about the existing buildings and any potential new buildings . 
  we can all agree that the hungarian building looks really nice . 
  but imagine your country 's government proposing to spend some hundreds of millions on such a building right now . 
  we 'd be all rightfully saying that this money should be spent on sensible things . 
  and yet we participate in this giant contest by comparing the sizes of our parliaments . 
  the strength of modern democracies is the replaceability of our elected leaders . 
  my guess was always that mercedes makes cars comfy enough for a taxi driver to spend most of his waking hours in . 
  unceasing xenophobia should get negative modifiers for having foreign influence , such as tourism or trade . 
  one might argue that what he neutrolgreek wrote were news , while what you wrote were olds . 
  but i digress . 
  yeah , but without the weather . 
  worst of both worlds . 
  i hate to be that guy , but i have to say that europe has already seen a wave of far-right-ism . 
  i would hate to witness one now . 
  whether it changes anything or not will determine if it was disastrous . 
  there is no such thing as a meaningless disaster , is there ? 
  pink used to be considered a manly colour , because of connotations with blood . 
  the problem with ukip is the same as with many extremists - they 're loud and make themselves seem to be bigger than they actually are . 
  and that is an actual strength and danger . 
  i should not have to know what is this damn far-right party * at all * , and yet i know . 
  i was referring to what / u/mkvgtired said :  when the uk and france wanted cooperation they never demanded anything . 
  they came to washington and asked , and washington obliged . 
   the way the polish defense minister went about it seemed overly arrogant . 
  - quickly , you must help us !, 
  - sorry , you 're being rude . 
  we wo n't help you , even though it 's against our own interests . 
  well , it 's really easy to solve that problem - incarcerate nice people . 
  it 's also recommended to open it under water in order to limit airborne death . 
   europeans are sex craved communists who do n't shave west europe 's vision of east europe , actually . 
  i 'm so tired i almost believed you . 
  this is such a fantastic story , i was wondering how could i have not heard of it on qi or in school before . 
  well written . 
  the internet needs a sarcasm font . 
  what hypocrisy . 
  why are n't journalists calling politicians on the most obvious bullshit ? 
  is n't david cameron focusing too much on * his * country ? 
  every time he opens his mouth , we hear only whining . 
  a lot of polish , american , british , and german people somehow found a reason to go to ireland . 
  as for boringness , it does remind me of this old chinese curse : may you live in interesting times . 
  it 's similar in sweden . 
  tap water is pristine quality and extremely cheap . 
  not much demand for bottled water perhaps ? 
  maybe the bottled water companies target a certain group of people who never trust tap water and will pay a higher price ? 
  who knows . 
  i hope it 's just a sensationalist title . 
  this region of the world has already seen too much consolidation of power . 
  i say , link to your heart 's content as long as it 's in a subreddit that 's not saturated by likely-to-take-offence americans . 
  there was a huge influx of them in the last few months . 
  i initially thought this was an onion article . 
  well , after changing one answer i got sweden , so we 're all very similar i suppose !, 
  any secret bulgarians here ? 
  art is * supposed * to be politically incorrect . 
  the artist did see that coming , i 'm sure . 
  perhaps some people care for these things enough to risk a backlash . 
  there is no modern art depicting nazi crimes because germany has ` atoned ' ^ 1 more than any other country in history ( except for those that were exterminated ) . 
  ____ ^ 1 assuming there is such a thing as ` guilty ' in war . 
  a merican version of europe would perhaps sound a bit like * yerp * . 
  still , the mere fact that people ca n't agree on this is very european in itself . 
   biggest of the small states of europe . 
  this is hilarious . 
  to paraphrase stewart lee , it 's like being the 50th tallest dwarf . 
  it really is a shame that british and american music easily invade all of our radio waves , yet there is almost no musical exchange between european countries . 
   the ukraine ouch !, 
  dane-ish , maybe . 
  that 's not the point . 
  the word ` roma ' will eventually inherit all of the negative connotation of the word ` gypsy ' , and that will lead to using yet another euphemism . 
  i think you can see the larger image here . 
  all this confusion only serves to prove that it 's okay to simply use the word ` gypsy ' . 
  i 'm not trying to justify someone 's racism - i 'm just saying that is the actual reality . 
  it 's the same when it comes to grammar . 
  when everybody 's making the same mistakes and forget the strict rules , the rules have to change . 
   would you call a black guy `` nigga '' just because rappers do it ? 
  [ only a ***** can call a ***** , ' ***** ' . ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvn_0qvuhhw ) . 
  anyway , the word itself does n't hold any offensive value . 
  it 's the connotation . 
  ` retarded ' used to be a medical description . 
  it became offensive , so we started using the word ` special ' to refer to certain people . 
  and suddenly that word became offensive too . 
  so we started using other euphemisms , and this cycle wo n't end . 
  probably in poland 's because many lithuanians are homophobic . 
  do n't want to raise any suspicion among the neighbours . 
  are n't we all ... 
  fascinating question !, 
  i think it 's pronounced similarly as `` lechia '' , the alternative name for poland . 
  more examples of this etymology from [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lechia ) : * lenkija in the lithuanian language * lengyelorsz\u00e1g in the hungarian language * lehastan in the armenian language , * lehistan in the ottoman turkish language * lahestan/lehestan in persian . 
  * lehia in the romanian language the word is derived from the name of one of the first major polish tribes , so it likely does n't have any other meaning . 
  a name bordering on racist by today 's standards . 
  i heard something along these lines said by an old german guy , but i can not remember it exactly . 
  the proper form might be himmeldonnerwetter and verfluchte as separate words . 
  in any case , german does have quite a few swear words . 
  would you say that perhaps this is a good example of `` hate russia , love the russians '' ? 
  i think these protests ( or rather , the root causes of them ) are n't given enough attention . 
  look , even among the threads in this post there is barely any mention of them . 
  i would love to see a map that shows alcohol tourism in europe . 
  with power comes corruption .
