  i have met more atheist folk dancers than religious ones . 
  most of the policemen i have seen were also likely atheists . 
  does it mean that i live in an atheist police state in which it is mandatory that atheist police enforces eating garlic bread and folk dancing ? 
  that 's actually a very good outcome . 
  even reckless drivers are n't usually that considerate . 
  all the while fuelling a large industry of annoying glitter . 
  they even live with for a bit * after * they marry . 
  family is important for southerners . 
  but swedes tend to give a shit when you have black hair ... and dark eyes ... and a slightly dark carnation of skin ... 
  the legend seems to be broken . 
  take a look at i1a , i1b and i1c . 
  a truly objective and credible article about economy is like a truly objective article on evolutionary biology , fluid mechanics , or graph theory : extremely boring . 
  yet a lot of people seem to have opinions on economics . 
  i have n't seen these people trying to calculate the mechanical stresses in their houses , or diying a shed , or studying medicine to know how to diet better . 
  sweden 's increasing foreign-born population is a big factor in the current birth rate . 
  i 'd say there are less and less swedes in sweden . 
  i would just like to drop this glorious [ speech by churchill , accompanied by a band from the future ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw6jw9y59jy ) . 
  lift up your hearts !, 
  yeah , but just imagine where would you need to drive if you lived in luxembourg !, 
  while in the us you probably make twice the trip to work than an average european . 
  well they do earn a lot more than the countries where everything is cheaper . 
  the purchasing power of the money an average person would earn is still a lot higher than everywhere else in europe . 
  people * do * drive to sweden for shopping , though !, 
  it 's just that it takes a lot of gasoline and time to make such a trip . 
  as for running an importing business ... people tend to be patriotic with their shopping . 
  at least here in sweden , most people would rather buy a product branded as `` made in sweden '' rather than pay 2 times less for an imported alternative . 
  i suppose the immigrants here , and people who are worse off do n't care about that . 
  i always wonder why does anyone bother to put `` average '' values in such charts without explaining how were these averages calculated . 
  there are many ways to calculate an `` average '' . 
  of course it 's not like journalists who use these charts for sensationalism really care about maths . 
  yeah ... but it 's a rectangle . 
  you ca n't possibly take a rectangular state seriously . 
  how much euro for one hardship and suffering ? 
  take a look at the historic graph and see how variable it all is . 
  maybe france wants to get rid of pests from its society ? 
  who would that be ... 
  you do have a point . 
  i feel pity for all those americans with germanic or slavic roots . 
  they can not pronounce their own surnames and struggle with all the weird letters . 
  because they would end up in jail faster than you could spell `` communist '' or `` topless '' . 
  they do n't really have to . 
  it 's marketing . 
  it might have been a marketing decision to promote clean ` healthy ' eggs , and it now became a standard . 
  and whether americans eat more than hungarians or not is completely irrelevant . 
  i dunno , seems the [ us eats quite a lot of eggs ] ( http://www.thepoultrysite.com/articles/1575/good-news-on-global-egg-consumption ) when compared to other countries . 
  still , i did n't mean to put forward a serious claim , it was just a random guess . 
  well , from an engineering standpoint , the eu approach is better , being quite elegant and simple . 
  but this is economics . 
  maybe americans manage to sell more eggs if they all look pristine clean . 
  and forget where it came from . 
  we-ell , there is steak tartare , quite a tasty dish , but from beef , not pork . 
  oh , and sometimes horse meat is used . 
  preferably intentionally , though . 
  important things can be seen in the regional view . 
  it shows how culture propagates . 
  the higher resolution helps . 
  [ here we see ] ( http://www.atlasofeuropeanvalues.eu/new/europa-regio2.php?c2=society&amp;map[]=&amp;map[]=&amp;map[]=&amp;map[]=&amp;map[]=50&amp;map[]=&amp;map[]=&amp;button= ) that societies under german influence hate extremists of all kinds . 
  oh my ... not god ... 
  i have found a mind-boggling map . 
  take a look at the percentage of [ people who do n't believe in any sort of god , spirit , or life force ] ( http://www.atlasofeuropeanvalues.eu/new/europa-regio2.php?c2=religion&amp;map[]=&amp;map[]=&amp;map[]=&amp;map[]=1254&amp;map[]=&amp;map[]=&amp;map[]=&amp;button= ) this has got to be some sort of misunderstanding , surely ? 
  was the question differently phrased in east germany ( and the czech republic ) ? 
  or maybe there 's another explanation . 
  after communist totalitarianism removed religion and replaced it with the party leader there may have been no strong church to fill in the void after the fall of the wall . 
  or perhaps the survey sample was small in some countries and large in others . 
  ----- there are more questions with a suspicious contrast . 
  while i can see how ireland and poland have high church attendance , i ca n't not suspect there was something wrong with the phrasing or context of questions . 
  here are [ people very concerned about the living conditions of their immediate family : www.atlasofeuropeanvalues.eu/new/europa-regio2.php?c2=society&amp;map[]=&amp;map[]=&amp;map[]=&amp;map[]=&amp;map[]=284&amp;map[]=&amp;map[]=&amp;button= . 
  a few nations clearly stand out . 
  why ? 
  surely not because of some nation-wide cultural willy-nilly attitude about family . 
  i second this notion . 
  and most religious people i know are , like you , right wing nuts . 
  so maybe stop being so pc . 
  me too . 
  oh boy that would be simply awesome . 
  they would divide into two groups : enraged racists and racists that somehow manage to pretend they do n't mind it . 
  there are still too many people associating religion with patriotism . 
  iirc , a lot of the eastern block somehow considers religion as being key in what took down the non-theist authoritarian communist rule . 
  constituting a secular division in all eu countries would be considered an anti-nationalist movement of the eu , and people would shout at the big bad europe that wants to assimilate their land . 
  the ussr * did * combat nationalism ( or simply national identity ) by destroying culture , including local religiosity . 
  even if ireland has medieval laws that contradict reason , legislatively forcing a change would probably be considered abusive . 
  i think we 'd have to begin with proper education that might lead to a gradual change in the course of a generation or two . 
  the image of this ghostly design will haunt fiat until the end of time . 
  they made just one of these ugly models , yet people wo n't stop talking shit about them . 
  yeah , there are differences between genders . 
  but is marriage a way of celebrating * differences between two people * ? 
  surely not , that 's just stupid . 
  otherwise conservatives would be all about mixed-race marriages . 
  it 's a contract between two people who share a strong relationship . 
  the guy 's twisting words like a snake . 
  perhaps he 's not a fan ? 
  sorry for the phrasing : i was thinking more about the comments on the paper itself , be it the bbc article or others . 
  wherever you look , you see numbers that make this seem like a daunting challenge . 
  i suspect this analysis was purposefully made to look like a giant impossible task to raise a few discouraging voices . 
  i mean , surely this whole process could be planned out over a longer time period for a smoother transition . 
  oh well , it 's not like it 's going to happen , anyway . 
  got ta love them idioms . 
  it 's almost like encryption against foreigners . 
  they know more of the national language than most any other immigrants in the world . 
  you ca n't appreciate what a huge difference there is here .
