sorry my point was that a younger demographic is more likely to accept english being used on most signs . 
  i do n't think english would be used in such a way on other types of businesses . 
  seems to be a tattooist so they probably have a younger customer base . 
  well it was n't since we have real neo-nazis . 
  the `` big '' neo-nazi party lost all of its mandates , the best county result was 0.8 % . 
  one should also remember that this is a party that got 528 votes in the ep elections . 
  it is propaganda left over from the 16th century . 
   at first glance it would appear that these two notions are opposed to each other . 
  i do n't see how they are opposite each other , it is exactly the same argument . 
  yeah it probably is . 
  scandinavians are basically the same people anyway . 
  i doubt anyone could really tell the difference between a norwegian , dane or swede . 
  herman van rompuy is so insignificant that the guardian spells his name wrong . 
  if this goes through the main parties will have cemented efdds anti-establishment views and their voters view that the european institutions are undemocratic . 
  it is just bad political maneuvering that will give the eu-skeptics something to constantly poke at . 
  shame they did n't interview someone who supports swedish weapon exports . 
   then comes the sweden democrats ( ** nazis ** ) i think someone who calls them nazis do not know what national socialism is . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.vk.se/1196393/lanets-forsta-runsten ) is a video showing the runestone ( video might be loud ) . 
  the swedish media do not cover the eu . 
  they only report on stuff when they want to ban snus or surstr\u00f6mming . 
  so the general public have no idea about what work our meps have done . 
  we have a serious problem in sweden with hooligans . 
  just this season premiere six weeks ago a regular supporter died after he was attacked on his way to the stadium . 
  the pirate party rode to the last election on a horse composed of the tpb-trial and ipred . 
  they also had a different leader last election . 
  they are also largely irrelevant to national politics getting around 1 % in most polls . 
  what is conchitas connection with the union ? 
  this is just stupid , most languages can have words with infinite length because of compound words . 
  it is more civilized here in sweden . 
  i do n't get it . 
  russia already borders poland . 
  okay . 
  at least its not an even number of members then . 
  we had an even number in sweden for a while and when the voting was tied they had to draw straws . 
  does the finnish riksdag have an even number of members ? 
  seems like the grass is greener in poland . 
  it looks like modern art !, 
  [ kungsleden ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kungsleden ) is a swedish hiking trail , i have heard that it is very beautiful . 
  hopefully only in a capacity that makes it possible for the member states to easily trade and cooperate . 
  european bureaucrats would have tried to transfer as such power as they can from national parliaments to brussels . 
  more people will start to question the legitimacy of the eu leaders . 
  this is hilarious . 
  sorry , i read too quickly !, 
  there is no `` upcoming referendum '' about scanian independence . 
  scanian independence is mostly used as a joke . 
  `` we '' go after the buyers not the sellers . 
  yes , it burned on december 2nd last year !, 
  this is not true , it is a proposal from one party in stockholm 's municipal council . 
  it was a male member of the party who proposed this . 
  [ here is some from wikipedia . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antifaschistische_aktion#sweden ), 
  the group who now has a database of over 6000 people who have commented on right-wing sites have clear connections to afa a leftist extremist organisation who uses intimidation and violence to silence people and make politicians leave their democratically elected seats . 
  [ translated ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=sv&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.svd.se%2fnyheter%2fstockholm%2fsnorojningen-gynnar-man_8807762.svd ) [ swedish ] ( http://www.svd.se/nyheter/stockholm/snorojningen-gynnar-man_8807762.svd ), 
   stockholm city council to introuce `` gender aware snow removal '' . 
  by removing the snow from bussstops , daycare centers , and bikebaths . 
  before roads and industry get their snow removed . 
  because men are over represented in the driving pool so cleaning roads is a manifestation of the patriarchy . 
  i thought this was only a proposal from the green party , it has not been introduced right ? 
  in sweden it is three years . 
  immigration/integration , might not be the `` biggest '' debate but definitely the loudest . 
  it is the dutch/danish that gets them confused . 
  it is n't really about karma , it is about the visibility of dissenting opinions . 
  why ca n't we at least have a similar thing / r/games have with `` does n't contribute to the discussion '' when you hover over the downvote button . 
   swedish police and security forces are about to get acess to all domestic phone and datatrafic . 
  did n't they just ask the service providers for an automated system ? 
  a system the service providers refused to allow . 
  bleeding-hearts give them money because they do n't know or care that if you give one of them money more beggars will flock to that area . 
  the thing is that these beggars are organised . 
  they have the same modus operandi . 
  i even see different people going around trains handing out the same laminated notes with a picture of their `` family '' and a plea to give them money for their sick motherfathersisteruncle . 
  is there a reason for this ? 
  well it is n't really a surprise that a product costing less would sell more . 
  also comparing a product which has no additional cost with one that has huge running costs is n't really fair . 
  yes , you should do it outside . 
  you do n't necessarily have to do it underwater , it just helps masking the smell . 
  how is this even news ? 
  it would have been better if they compared the money rather than the quantity . 
  it would be news if the bicycle business made more money than the car business . 
  if anyone does n't know , you are suppose to clean the fish , take out the intestines and the skin . 
  then you take the small filet 's and put them on `` tunnbr\u00f6d '' with potatoes , onion and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche . 
  it does taste good but the smell from the can is n't the best . 
  how many of these `` luca 's '' do you think live on the second floor ? 
  then the party should be tasked with creating a political stance on the issue , they should n't need to be told what to do by companies and organisations . 
  also in sweden we mostly vote for party not people . 
  so at least on the national level there are n't any constituents in the same way . 
  politicians should only be influenced by the party which sets the political manifesto . 
  they should go forward with the politics they were elected to , not change their minds just because a company or organisation gave them money or `` gifts '' . 
   a guy with cancer died . 
  ( he had a popular blogg about it , a book will now be released ) he was also a member of the quite popular band sugarplum fairy , which is ( i think ) a reason for the blog being popular . 
  what about alko ? 
  i did n't think of that . 
  seems really strange since very little english is used in those fields , it is mostly mathematics . 
  the promised speed is 50-100 down and 7-10 up . 
  also the price is $ 43 . 
  well the biggest newspaper in sweden have a couple of articles about it and a commercial tv station is airing it live . 
  so yeah kind of national news . 
  they give the prize on the 10th of december but they announce the recipient on the 11th of october . 
  i totally lost it at the last picture . 
  they can try . 
  he proposed .
