interesting , thanks !, 
  congrats to the people of germany . 
  to the politicians of germany : what took you so goddamn long ? 
  holding it back for so long just seemed weird . 
  ha , i just said in another comment that i loved visiting a smaller fest when i visited tegernsee a few years back . 
  i had a marvelous time . 
  such great fun . 
  one of my most treasured travel memories . 
  i remember going to a `` waldfest '' in a smaller bavarian village when i was visiting family in that area , and its one of my favorite travel memories of all time . 
  i had such a fantastic time there , it does n't really compare to anything else i 've done elsewhere . 
  i tend to think that most big , famous tourist attractions are overrated . 
  people might not agree and that 's fine , but i 'm generally more of a fan of the cities themselves rather than the specific , touristy hotspots in them . 
  i had a great time in london for example , but seeing big ben is one of my least memorable things about the week i spent there . 
  that is not to say that the cities themselves are overrated . 
  i 've really enjoyed my time in london , berlin , munich , rome , florence - great cities , all of them . 
  i recommend them all . 
  but rome , ah , i really need to make a special shout-out to that city . 
  the history visible throughout rome is just ridiculous . 
  it keeps suckerpunching you in the face wherever you look . 
  a truly majestic city . 
  i still would n't stand in line for hours on end in that heat just to get into the colosseum , but the overall experience is what matters to me and that was fantastic . 
  it was scorching hot the whole day which normally has a tendency to destroy my impression of whatever i 'm experiencing in such heat , so that fact that rome still holds up in my mind really says something . 
  but otherwise i generally prefer to visit stuff outside the beaten track , away from the big attractions . 
  small villages in germany , camping in italy , spending a week in a small cottage in denmark . 
  those are the true attractions of europe , to me . 
  it was twenty years ago in my case , so i have a hard time remembering exactly what i learned right then and there in school , and what i 've picked up somewhere along the way in the twenty years since . 
  but i do think that most of the things i learned about the us was in relation to european history . 
  the colonization of the americas is an important part of european history , so we learned that . 
  the slave trade is important as well , so we learned about that . 
  the us was an important part of ww2 as well , if perhaps not * as * important as they sometimes think they were . 
  when it comes to stuff that 's more domestic to the us , it was mostly left alone . 
  of course you ca n't * not * talk about stuff like the cold war and the various conflicts that the us was involved in during the 20th century , but i do n't remember being explicitly taught `` us history '' . 
  when the war in iraq started in 2003 i was in the last stretch of education before going to university , and a group of friends and i really dug into their involvement in that region as part of a large project . 
  that was very enlightening , but not a part of the general education for everyone . 
  ** finland ** : the dutyfree ferry over , allowing you to really stock up on all of the tasty salmiakki !, 
  :d i also enjoy the finnish wilderness . 
  they are certainly not the only country up here to have large empty spaces , but i 've experienced it more in finland than a anywhere else ( even more than our own ) . 
  i 'm for the most part a close-to-the-city boy , but it has been really nice to get away from it all occasionally and i have gotten the furthest away from it in finland . 
  ** denmark ** : i always have a great time in denmark . 
  they speak a little funny , but they are still our bros. 
  they also have surprisingly beautiful nature that i do n't think they are properly credited for . 
  everyone says that everything is just flat , but go to m\u00f8n and see for yourself . 
  beautiful white cliffs . 
  they also have some amazing cider called somersby . 
  i do n't drink much , but i do drink that . 
  whenever my dad is down there he always buys me a bunch of them . 
  we have them here as well , but denmark has a vastly superior amount of flavors . 
  ** norway ** : i 've only been there once , when i was a really little kid , so i do n't have as many first hand experiences as with finland or denmark . 
  that is something i would really like to rectify some day . 
  they have some amazing nature that i would love to experience for myself . 
  generally we tend to share our nature with our neighbors , but they really seem to have kept the best for themselves . 
  quite a different selection of animals from those we hunt . 
  or at least those that i know that we hunt . 
  i 've never hunted myself , so i do n't really know much about anything related to hunting . 
  still , interesting to see the differences . 
  thanks !, 
  what types of animals do you hunt in greece ? 
  when i think of hunting i mostly think of the animals that feel pretty northern , like moose and reindeer . 
  i 've never really thought about what is hunted down south . 
  well , there are three types of ammunition you can use . 
  for most of training you use a laser system instead of actual rockets . 
  i do n't remember exactly how it worked , since it was a decade ago , but i think you fire off a round that only makes a small explosion ( enough to simulate recoil , but nothing dangerous ) whose sound triggers a laser which is then registered on the target board , giving you a score . 
  it was basically rocket launcher laser tag . 
  then there 's obviously the real anti-tank ammunition . 
  that 's used a lot more sparingly , since firing actual rockets constantly would get really expensive really quickly . 
  it 's still the end goal of the training , though . 
  we had one session planned , but did n't end up actually using live ammunition because of some problem . 
  i do n't remember if we ran out of that particular type of ammunition ( since it is quite rare ) or if there was some problem with the live ammo shooting range on that specific day , but either way , no live ammo for us . 
  and that brings us to the last type of ammunition there is , which is a sort of middle-ground between the two others . 
  it still does n't fire off a rocket , but it * does * give off a real backblast ( ie the fire coming out of the back of the tube when you fire it ) just like a real rocket would . 
  backblast is one of the things you really need to train an awareness for , and it 's one of the things that really sets that type of weaponry apart from your other guns . 
  if you are firing a rifle you do n't really need to know what 's behind you , but if you 're firing a rocket you need to make sure that you do n't accidentally barbecue the rest of your team just because you did n't give fair warning beforehand . 
  or your own legs , if you 're lying down when firing it . 
  tl ; dr version : there are three ammo types - fake ammo , real ammo and fake-with-real-backblast ammo . 
  fake ammo is used for general practice , but real ammo ( or the third kind , if live ammo is somehow not available ) is used at the last stage of training . 
  i was in the military , so yes , i 've fired several types of firearms . 
  assault rifles , pistols , anti-tank ordinance . 
  also thrown hand grenades . 
  i 'm shit at everything , though . 
  for some reason that comment made me listen to iron man by black sabbath all day . 
  it was a good day . 
  if shit hits the fan because the uk did n't think where it was throwing said shit around during their tantrum , i do n't consider that the fault of anyone besides the leavers themselves . 
  a lot of things should have been thought through before deciding on leaving , and it seems like they were n't . 
  that 's on them and their politicians , not on anyone else . 
  knowing how to navigate the issue of the irish border seems like one of the first things that ought to have been discussed until a solution was found , but like so much more : it seems like that was not the case . 
  it 's as if a majority of people genuinely went , `` ah , it 'll all sort itself out for the best in the end , i 'm sure '' . 
  nothing about this makes me happy - a lot of it makes me either irritated or resigned - but it 's hard not to feel like the reality of brexit is telling the uk `` told you so '' while clubbing their dreams to death as if they were a seal . 
  i 'm not aware of anyone . 
  we have n't been in a proper war for a very long time so it 's been a while since any military leader of ours could have amassed such a reputation , and we have n't fought each other for an even longer time so there really is n't that tension within sweden as there is within the us along the two sides of their civil war . 
  maybe people to the south of us could object to some statues we have - a lot of our kings certainly were n't saints back in the day , before we stopped warring against our neighbors - but i 've never heard poles or germans or whoever else we treated shitty historically raise any complaints against any statue of ours . 
  i do n't think anyone really cares that much about us or our monuments . 
  i 've heard so much good things about it , but i 've never seen it here either . 
  indian and chinese food are two staples in my restaurant food experience , but my favorite ( even if i eat it a bit more rarely since there are n't as many restaurants serving it ) is lebanese food . 
  ordering in a whole plate of different meze and various meats is just golden . 
  * smells under armpit * i do n't feel comfortable answering that . 
  enlightening . 
  thanks for explaining !, 
  no problem . 
   how did you imagine it looked like/was defined as ? 
  no , we call the coast facing westward the west coast .
