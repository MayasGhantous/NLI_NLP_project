  assuming it 's cheese inside . 
  if it 's not it still looks goddamn delicious , but in a more mysterious way . 
  it looks like the [ chili cheese ] ( http://www.hamburgare.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/chili_cheese_1.jpg ) that 's popular here , but i could be mistaken . 
  nope . 
  i was supposed to have gone there a couple of years ago , but a month or so before the trip my feet said `` fuck that '' and just broke down completely . 
  goddamned bastards . 
  hopefully i 'll get there someday . 
  it was a bit up and down . 
  i think that the best summary i can give is that i enjoyed it as a kid , but less as a teenager . 
  when i was 16 i switched school and suddenly i did n't have any of my old friends around me , while not finding people i really clicked with for a long while . 
  it was a weird time . 
  i did really like university , though . 
  again , ups and downs . 
  but i have always enjoyed learning things , so i enjoyed going to school in general , regardless of whether or not i had a lot of friends there ( even if friends did make things more enjoyable , obviously ) . 
  i love how all norwegians in the thread are in agreement about that . 
  :d but grandiosa is delicious , so it 's hard to fault you for that . 
  we are also not tangled up in especially many conflicts where their contributions could make us proud . 
  it 's a little peacekeeping here and there , but we do n't have a major presence anywhere . 
  also , we have a veteran 's day ? 
  i did n't know that , nor that it had become a flag day . 
  if we 're speaking fast food ( and i exclude all of the stuff that can be found all over europe ) it 's probably [ tunnbr\u00f6drulle ] ( http://blogg.vinkocken.se/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/img_7104.jpg ) : sausage and mashed potatoes , with ketchup , mustard , cucumber relish , roasted onion and a little salad . 
  maybe a little shrimp salad as well . 
  everything is then rolled into a * tunnbr\u00f6d * , a thin swedish bread . 
  yummy . 
  in terms of everyday food , i 'm not sure what 's the most popular . 
  probably [ falukorv ] ( https://www.google.se/search?q=tunnbr%c3%b6dsrulle&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewj9zehctahvahwqhjokheteapsq_auicigb&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=950#tbm=isch&amp;q=falukorv ) , in some way . 
  you can use it in a lot of different dishes . 
  haha , before i read his name your comment made no sense at all . 
  `` well , * that * escalated quickly ... '' knowing you 're a mod made it even weirder . 
  is curling a thing in norway ? 
  i always enjoy watching it when the olympics come around , and we 're fairly good at it , but i do n't remember seeing a lot of other nordic countries doing it . 
  that has always seemed a bit odd to me , considering how we usually tend to gravitate toward the same snowy , icy sports . 
  are there notable differences between your regions ? 
  yeah , here too . 
  probably not more popular than football , but still crazy popular . 
  hahaha , that might actually do the trick . 
  such a cute little fish !, 
  i think that petra mede [ summed us up ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29tzaqjktxs ) pretty well a couple of eurovisions ago . 
  yeah , i can down a bottle in an evening . 
  yummy , yummy . 
  that does sound a lot nicer than what i usually do . 
  i got mine right when i moved out from my dad 's house ... it must have been almost 10 years ago . 
  i tried some of the flavors you can add to it then , but did n't like them and have n't tried any since . 
  but they might have changed in taste and quality since then . 
  probably have . 
  it 's about 80-100 kronor per capsule and that usually lasts around a month and a half for me . 
  i do n't know how much that translates to kr/litre , exactly , but it feels pretty reasonable . 
  indeed it has . 
  i had the same problems with the former yugoslavian countries , but i found that traveling to croatia and montenegro helped a bit with that . 
  easier to place countries you 've been to on a map . 
  another reason to travel a bit in your direction . 
   since i do n't have any kids of my own , i do n't really know how the current curriculum looks . 
  i grew up in the 90 's , so the new borders were all very fresh at the time . 
  hopefully things are at least * a little bit * better nowadays . 
  it 's very popular in sweden . 
  it comes in a great variety of flavors ( such as [ these ] ( https://ramlosa.se/produkter ) and [ these ] ( http://loka.nu/vara-drycker/ ) ) . 
  i also have a soda streamer so that i can carbonate my own water , which is neat . 
  as much as possible , i try to drink sparkling water instead of soda . 
  it 's just so much less sugar . 
   also , most swedes i met could not point to poland on a physical map . 
  i 'm not sure if i should be surprised or not . 
  on the one hand , * it 's right there !, 
  * out of all of the countries who used to be behind the iron curtain ( besides russia itself , of course ) , i find poland to be the easiest to place on a map . 
  it 's the big country just next to germany . 
  easy peasy . 
  but on the other hand : it 's not like i 'm going to pretend that we swedes are super well-versed in post-iron curtain geography . 
  i 've tried to correct it in recent years , but i still have huge and rather embarrassing blind spots when it comes to the european map . 
  but i do have poland on my `` countries i need to visit someday '' list . 
  seems like an interesting place . 
   on escalators stay on the right , the left side is for busy people . 
  for some reason i read that as elevators , which made absolutely no sense at all . 
  people on the left side of elevators get up faster ? 
  it 's pretty rare to hear people speak good swedish with a foreign accent . 
  i rarely like it , which is a bit odd since i * do * like foreign accents when people speak english . 
  but there 's something ... i do n't know , really . 
  it 's can just be really hard to understand foreigners , no matter where they come from . 
  native english-speakers can be the worst . 
  not because they 're somehow worse * at * swedish , per se , but simply because their accent makes me think i should interact with them in english . 
  in a way similar to when irish people actually speak irish , the accent and the language i expect when i hear the accent does n't add up . 
  it just messes with my mind . 
  [ not quite . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpyg94ozhk0 ), 
  black , no sugar . 
  if i 'm out somewhere i might stray , but never when i 'm at home . 
  * throws holy water at you * the power of christ compels you !, 
  interesting . 
  thanks !, 
  i 'm a bit curious about how you determine a `` thick '' accent since you ( if i 've understood things correctly ) do n't have any `` central '' norwegian accent , like we have rikssvenska . 
  if i were to label a swedish accent as thick ( or an individual as having a thick accent , regardless of which one ) , i would use rikssvenska as a starting point and judge it from there . 
  the further away it got , the thicker . 
  presumably . 
  but how does that work in your case , without a `` riksnorska '' ? 
  no problems !, 
  except my hand . 
   do liberals and christan democrats support the moderates ? 
  yes . 
  it 's the three of them and the center party that make up the alliance . 
  then you have `` the left party '' , the social democrats and the green party on the left , with the latter two being the ones in power at the moment . 
  and then the sweden democrats to the side , constantly raging about refugees and immigrants . 
  i 've busted up my hand and ca n't write properly , so i 'll skip your last question since it 's a bit complicated .
