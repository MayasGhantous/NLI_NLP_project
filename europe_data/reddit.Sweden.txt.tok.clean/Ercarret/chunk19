  i have n't really thought about how things look in countries without a single dominant language . 
  the fictional donald duck party ( * kalle anka-partiet * ) always gets some votes every election . 
  it 's been sort of a long-running joke to vote for them to show your displeasure with the system , without actually voting for some racist bastards or whatever other fringe parties might have gained traction at the time . 
  edit : if anyone feels like running [ this article ] ( https://nyheter24.se/maktkamp24/777452-11-knappa-partier-som-folk-rostade-pa ) through google translate it lists a bunch of the funniest weird parties that people voted for in the last election . 
  some of the highlights : `` masturbationists against nato '' , `` satanic initiative '' ( a riff on the actual feminist initiative party ) and `` the bajen party '' ( bajen being the nickname for hammarby , a football club in stockholm ) . 
  the anglosphere dominates certain genres , certainly . 
  i read a few horror/fantasy short story collections in swedish recently and was surprised by how much i enjoyed it , since i basically only ever read those kinds of stories in english . 
  writing really niche novels in a very small language usually wo n't end up with you rolling in cash . 
   but there are genres in which it is possible for swedish writers to make a living - usually detective stories . 
  not only is there a sizable domestic market for them , there 's also a fairly decent international demand for books of that type . 
  i 'm not really into those kinds of stories so i still rarely read swedish books , but it 's certainly * there * . 
  as far as what language i read in , it depends on the book . 
  if it was written in swedish or english , i read it in the original language . 
  if it was written in a language i ca n't read myself , i read whatever translation is available . 
  mostly swedish ones , naturally , but there are occasions where the english translation of a book comes out earlier ( or even just at all ) than a swedish one , in which case i grab that one . 
  the us and canadian dollar , absolutely . 
  remembering that mexico uses the peso took a moment , but it came to me eventually . 
  i keep track of the usd , british pound and euro exchange rates , since those are currencies i tend to buy stuff in . 
  the usd a little less so , perhaps , but it 's still good to know for a bunch of reasons . 
  i have no idea what the exchange rates for either the canadian dollar or the mexican peso are . 
  if i ever find myself in a situation where i 'm going there i 'll check it , but until then it 's not really relevant knowledge . 
  it 's complicated . 
  before the last election , i could have said a number of things . 
  i 'm a leftie , but for the most part i really respected the rightwing government we had . 
  they were the kind of liberals i really like . 
  we might have some different opinions on a lot of things , but at the end of the day i kind of felt that we were still on the same page in our basic values . 
  but i do n't feel that way under the new leadership they ( * moderaterna * , the biggest party in the rightwing bloc ) got after their defeat in the election . 
  they 've taken a turn too far right for me to follow , which is a shame . 
  i do respect * centern * for their stance with regards to immigration , though . 
  they 've stood steadfast and principled even as a lot of parties on both sides have lost their footing . 
  what 's red lemonade ? 
  i 've always seen it as a yellow drink because of the lemons . 
  if you substitute them for something else , it would n't feel like lemonade anymore . 
  to me , anyway . 
  yes !, 
  i do n't know if there is any differences between austrian and german leberk\u00e4se ( i 've only had it when visiting relatives in bavaria ) , but it 's the german food i miss the most . 
  huh , interesting . 
  til . 
  i guess that might explain why there seem to be so many andorrans/people with andorran flairs here . 
  i 've seen that flair a lot , which , given the population of andorra , seemed a bit odd . 
  i do n't mind the question as long as things do n't turn personal , but i do mind it when i 'm clearly in a bad state and people who i do n't want to have an honest discussion about it with ask me that . 
  since i 'm obviously unable to just brush it off i really have to be honest , and that just creates an entirely avoidable awkwardness . 
  it happened a lot when i had trouble walking and had to order home food . 
  i 'm opening the door , leaning heavily on my crutches , and the delivery man goes , `` hi !, 
  how are you ? '', 
  how do i answer that ? 
  `` well , gee , thanks for asking . 
  i 'm fine . 
  really . 
  looking fucking miserable is just a favorite pastime of mine , i do it for an hour every day . '', 
  do you come from or have ties to somewhere else than your flair indicate ? 
  i 'll freely admit to not knowing a whole lot about andorra , but i struggle to come up with a reason for not viewing it as an independent nation . 
  how does that even work ? 
  i knew you had a bunch of languages spoken in belgium , but i did n't know that so many people could n't understand each other because of it . 
  i mean , how do you even get something as basic as your news ? 
  are there any newspapers that are read by everyone or do you only have regional ones ? 
  i 'm not sure what 's greater when thinking about all of this : my confusion or my fascination . 
  yeah , exactly . 
  my grandmother used to have a house in the wilderness outside of jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 , and i was met with utter bewilderment when i spoke swedish around there . 
  it was especially weird since i had been able to speak swedish just fine with finns in helsinki , so i kind of assumed that that would be the case for the rest of finland as well . 
  it was a rough awakening . 
  haha !, 
  finland , for sure . 
  i was really young and it was the first time i ever visited a country where the people spoke a language i could n't understand , and where they could n't understand me . 
  sure , swedish is taught in finland , but no one spoke it where i was . 
  this was also before i knew any english , so i just could n't communicate with anyone at all . 
  it confused the shit out of my five year old brain . 
  a very weird experience . 
  it feels even weirder that it 's a neighboring country - especially since it 's the one that i nowadays would say is the one i 'm probably closest to in many ways . 
  current world champions , woooo !!!, 
  :d it 's big . 
  one of the other nordic countries ( probably denmark , but maybe finland ) or germany . 
  the only reason would be to defend myself , so if you take away the option of defending my country from an invasion there are n't really any reasons i can think of that would make me want to fight . 
  maybe in defense of some of the other nordic countries ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7umux68kte&amp;t=14 ) i 've heard people try to describe swedish in many different ways , from sounding like german to sounding like russian , but i guess that `` sing-songy '' is something that tends to come up every now and again . 
  edit : regarding english , i learned it at such a young age that i did n't really have a grasp of how it sounded before i started hearing it as part of the curriculum . 
  especially in the ( i think ) early 2000s it felt as if there were more swedish actors playing russians with horrible accents than there were swedes playing swedes or russians playing russians . 
  it was really weird . 
   if you include islands we have the 2nd longest coastline in the world , only beaten by canada . 
  that has to be relative to your size or something , right ? 
  there is no way you 're beating russia or australia otherwise . 
   crocodiles can bathe happily in a warm water that comes from the nearby nuclear plant .

  i 'm not sure how it 's viewed by you danes , but i remember visiting m\u00f8n when i was a teenager and being really surprised by the tall white cliffs there . 
  it was nothing like what i thought danish nature looked like , and it was breathtaking .

  while i understand that turkish might not make you understand a lot of other european languages , how is with other turkish languages ? 
  i do n't know exactly how closely related they are , but are n't the languages of uzbekistan , turkmenistan and kyrgyzstan part of the turkish language family ? 
  i would understand people thinking that if you were french , but it seems like a weird connection to make for someone who is not . 
  i mean , i would n't have thought you were a supporter of the `` sweden democrats '' party if your name had been sdzombie . 
  had you been a swede , then maybe , but otherwise it feels like an odd assumption to make . 
  interesting random fun fact : `` fn '' in swedish typically stands for * f\u00f6renta nationerna * , or the united nations . 
  does n't make me think you 're related to them in any way , though . 
  when i was a wee teen , i used to write a lot of fiction . 
  one of the things i wrote was this sci fi fantasy story , and a mysterious character in it was called terracre ( with some apostrophe in there somewhere , if i remember correctly ) . 
  it never really felt as badass as i wanted it to be and once when i misspelt it it came out as `` terrace '' , which sounded way too uncool for my mysterious alien character . 
  i tried just inverting the name , and thus `` ercarret '' was born .
