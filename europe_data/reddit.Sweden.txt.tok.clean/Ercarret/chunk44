  not the little green men themselves , but perhaps they were suffering from something like sleep paralysis . 
  it 's basically people waking up before their body is done dreaming , leaving them paralysed and hallucinating ( while otherwise awake ) for a while before their body snaps out of it . 
  it 's not some new phenomena - people have been experiencing sleep paralysis all throughout history , and different explanations have been given for it depending on place and time . 
  i would n't be surprised if , say , the scandinavian myth of the `` mare '' ( an evil creature that sits on you while you sleep , from which english gets the word '' nightmare '' ) is also related to the same condition . 
  but just as with european/american folklore , i view these two ideas very differently . 
  the concept of mares intrigue me , while aliens do n't ( in this form , at least ) . 
  one is a very old myth explaining a mysterious phenomenon in an unenlightened time , while the other one feels more like a modern misunderstanding of something natural . 
  ( even if i 'll be the first to admit that sleep paralysis hardly is an especially well-known condition , and that i myself would freak the fuck out if i ever experienced it without having heard the explanation for it beforehand . ), 
  all of this is not to say that there are n't american things that interests me along the same lines , though . 
  there are , just not much in the way of creature stuff . 
  but while i 'm not too interested in your jersey devils , mothmen or sasquatches , i 'm pretty fascinated by certain elements of your nature and environments . 
  for one , my fascination with swedish forests extends to yours as well : you have some * really * cool ones . 
  i also really dig your long , sometimes lonely roads . 
  i have a hard time really nailing down why i like them , but there is just something i really , really dig about dark lonely roads . 
  and , while i do n't consider the tales you have of ( semi ) historical figures to be folklore , i can still occasionally enjoy those tales . 
  i really like the tale of john henry , for example ; or those of a lot of heroes and outlaws in the wild west . 
  this is probably a fair assessment . 
  i know enough people with `` non-nordic '' appearance to know that everything 's not always entirely peachy . 
  that said , i doubt europe is worse than the us in this regard , so i do n't think op will meet any new shocking depths of prejudices . 
   favourites were r\u00e4ddningspatrullen , ankliv and of course bumbibj\u00f6rnarna all classics , but let 's not forget about [ luftens hj\u00e4ltar ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ip68ox_92cw ) !, 
  i * love * that song . 
  fully agree . 
  i love a lot of the intros to old 80s tv series : knight rider , airwolf , a-team , macgyver , magnum pi . 
  ah , the memories !, 
  nhl would probably be a lot more popular if all of the games were n't played at 3 am . 
  that makes following the season kind of unsustainable , unless you have some really weird work hours . 
  i imagine that the same might be true for other european countries with an interest in other leagues of yours . 
  unexpected human interactions ? 
  * runs away nordic-ly * all kidding aside , i think it would be okay . 
  ca n't speak for how koreans/other asians would see it , obviously , but speaking as someone from a country that 's kind of known for not wanting to talk to strangers , i guess i can say that help in need is probably an exception to that . 
  if i for whatever reason do n't want or need your help , i can always say `` no , please '' or something to that effect , easily resolving the situation . 
  but if i * do * want the help , then you offering it is , well , helpful . 
  you monster . 
  such unmitigated cruelty . 
  so you call it a hawaiian as well ? 
  i 'm always curious about names of pizzas , and whether people from the places themselves would recognize the pizzas we name after them . 
  we have a lot of pizzas named after places in the us , mainly of the * panpizza * variety since it 's thicker crust is typically seen as an american type of pizza . 
  my family used to own a house in rural finland , where i , my little sister and my mom ( and sometimes my grandmother ) would go in the summers . 
  among many positive ones , i have two very clear , traumatic memories from my first time there : 1 ) when i played in the road and accidentally left something in the middle of it , which made a car brake/swerve wildly to avoid it , which in turn convinced my mother that i 'd been hit and oh my god , oh my god , oh my god . 
  lots of crying and yelling . 
  2 ) pineapples on fucking pizza !!!, 
  the trauma of that experience still haunts me , 25 years later . 
  i can ... * chokes up * i can still feel the taste . 
  even as i tried to scrub them away , the entire pizza still tasted of pineapples . 
  i was expecting pizza - wonderful , tasty pizza - and what i got was ... was ... * sobs in corner *, 
  interesting , i 've never had apple on pizza before . 
  i do love chicken and curry , though . 
  that 's one of the ones i order most , usually with bananas and ham . 
  i 've also found that adding a little gorgonzola can do wonders . 
  i do n't know what the best food i 've ever eaten is , but i can name the best examples of a few types of food i 've had : ** risotto : ** a restaurant in kotor , montenegro . 
  i 'm not a huge fan of risotto in general , but that one was * amazing * . 
  ** kebab : ** there 's a kebab shop in gothenburg that i always visit whenever i 'm there . 
  last time i had a kebab with a splash of shrimp salad in it , and i fell in love with it . 
  it sounds like such a weird combination , but it just worked together beautifully . 
  tried ordering shrimp salad to the next kebab i had back home , but got a bad batch and ended up having the shits for days afterwards . 
  ** schnitzel : ** weirdly in a restaurant in stockholm , despite having been to germany many times . 
  but that may have been because i generally do n't go out to fancy restaurants when i 'm on vacation for budget reasons , whereas i can do so occasionally back home . 
  but yeah , that schnitzel was great . 
  everything was great . 
  even the lemon was superb , which just blew my mind . 
  up until then i just thought that all lemon always had a pretty consistent taste , but no , you can actually get high quality lemons . 
  i have a hard time deciding the `` best '' of other foods i 've had . 
  the ones above are those who really stick out in their respective categories . 
  yeah . 
  we did n't even abolish mandatory sterilization as a prerequisite for gender reassignment surgery until a few years ago , which just blows my mind . 
  i do n't even know what that was * about * . 
  i mean , if you sterilize criminals or groups who you think are more likely to be criminals , then i can still see some kind of twisted logic in it ( regardless of all of the objections i have with that practice ) . 
  but no one i 've spoken to about the gender reassignment sterilizations seems to know why that was actually a thing . 
  it just ... was . 
  and it was allowed to continue far longer than it should have been . 
  how you view danish is very similar to my first experience with dutch , on a trip to the uk when i was a kid ( 12 or so ) . 
  it was an international scout meetup so there were scouts from all over , and when i walked past the dutch ones they spoke what i first thought was this completely unintelligible english . 
  it took a moment for me to realize that they were n't speaking english , and then a moment longer to figure out what they were actually speaking . 
  i 'm better at identifying spoken dutch nowadays , since i 've had a bit more exposure to it as i 've grown up . 
  my mind can still go completely blank at times when i hear it , but that 's usually a tell in itself that the person in question probably speaks dutch . 
  the one thing that springs to mind is `` gift '' , which means both `` married '' and `` poison '' in swedish . 
  make of that what you will . 
  no , but fortunately the rest did n't leak out of the toilet . 
  what the ... ? 
  how ... ? 
  who thought ... ? 
  i just ... 
   human zoo what the hell ... ? 
  and in 1931 ? 
  wow . 
  but yeah , exactly . 
  shit like that was way more common than i think people realize . 
  sure , the nazis * were * the big bad at the time - for good reason - but we should never let their horrendous actions and ideas eclipse the memory of our own . 
  unfortunately i feel that the common perception of that time period is pretty black and white . 
  well , at least we wash down our food before we speak . 
  yeah , i really think that one of the most fundamental misunderstandings of the second world war is that the germans were somehow alone when it came to these ideas . 
  they certainly took it further than most countries , but the fundamental idea of one race 's superiority over the others were hardly contained to just one country . 
  there were a lot of people all over europe who shared those opinions , and i think forgetting that is dangerous . 
  yeah , this . 
  it 's a * really * shady part of our history that we should teach more in school than we do . 
  our treatment of the sami in particular is pretty horrendous , even if there were plenty of other groups ( such as finns , romani and jews ) who were also deemed undesirable and inferior . 
  i mostly read the guardian and new york times through their respective apps . 
  i used to read a couple of swedish newspapers as well , but they 've locked most of their content behind paywalls recently so i do n't any more . 
  other than that i read a lot of different news from a lot of different sources , both swedish and international . 
  in terms of social media i mostly get my news from twitter , since i curate the people i follow there a lot more than i do on facebook .
