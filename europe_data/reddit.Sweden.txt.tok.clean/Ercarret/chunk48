  to so many otherwise fantastic dishes ? 
  why ... ? 
  i have some friends that swear that they like surstr\u00f6mming , but my take on it is that if opening it can [ bring down a plane ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4867024.stm ) i 'm good right where i am - well away from it . 
  i 'm a second generation immigrant ( my mom 's from finland , and my dad is half-german ) and viewing me as somehow `` not from sweden '' would be absurd , so i try to apply the same logic to people who 've immigrated from other places . 
  yes , i have a finnish identity , of a sort , but i do n't identify * as * finnish ; i identify as a swede with a finnish ( and german ) heritage . 
  people can cling to the national identities that their parents hold to a greater or lesser extent , but at the end of the day they are what they were born as - swedes , if born in sweden . 
  we certainly do n't lack popular sports athletes , in skiing or elsewhere . 
  i would easily count several ice hockey players as well . 
  but regardless , i feel that zlatan just eclipses everyone with raw star power . 
  i do n't listen to the radio , so i find it a little difficult to answer . 
  english music is obviously very popular , and a popular language for our own artists as well , but there is still a very healthy , vibrant music scene for songs sung in swedish . 
  lots of popular artists sing in swedish , especially if they do n't have any immediate plans to try to go international . 
  there really is no need for a `` maybe '' in that sentence . 
  it 's a little difficult to remember details like that , since i began learning it some 20 years ago . 
  nowadays i feel like the biggest thing are sounds that we do n't have in swedish , like your `` th '' and `` w '' sounds for example . 
  even if i can ( hopefully ) pronounce them correctly today , i still have to concentrate so that they do n't just come out as `` d/f '' and `` v '' . 
  english grammar is , at a basic level , a lot more similar to swedish than german grammar is . 
  i 'm pretty sure native english-speakers would agree , should they ever try to learn both languages . 
  that said , swedish has been heavily influenced by german . 
  much more so , i 'd wager , than by english . 
  we have a * ton * of words and expressions in common , while we `` just '' have a lot of words in common with english . 
  if this only made german easier to actually learn ... * sigh *, 
  maybe . 
  i do n't remember the name . 
  looking at the old yeller wikipedia page , it seems to share at least some story beats with the book i was talking about - even if there seems to be an actual , longer story in old yeller than i remember from `` my '' book . 
  i do n't do squat on saturday mornings . 
  if there are any ski competitions i may watch them on the telly , but i do n't participate in anything more strenuous than waking up and * maybe * getting out of bed . 
  hahaha , wtf kind of question is this ? 
  i do n't know how to answer either of those questions , and i would n't want to answer the latter even if i somehow had a clear candidate in mind . 
  i wo n't even throw the danes under that bus . 
  well , everything from hbo , naturally . 
  also a bunch of other stuff from other american networks that they 've nabbed the nordic rights to , such as 12 monkeys , into the badlands , the shannara chronicles , vikings , supergirl etc. 
  it is , to me , the second best streaming service after netflix . 
  the weird kid is the one who does n't read those stories . 
  haha , my mother loved really sad stories . 
  i remember one vividly : basically `` a kid had a dog that he loved like none other , and the dog loved the kid just as much . 
  then the dog got rabies . 
  [ long description of the dog deteriorating . ], 
  eventually the dad had to take it out back and shoot it . 
  the end . '', 
  it 's literally one of the first books i can remember my mother reading to me . 
  did n't traumatize me either . 
  i think that dealing with difficult subjects in a safe environment can be a good thing . 
  i read * soooo * much when i was a kid , so it 's pretty hard to do a list that does n't look like an essey , but if i were to whittle it down to three authors they 'd probably be : * astrid lindgren * roald dahl * j. r. r. tolkien i 'm also a huge fan of swedish nature and folk lore , and elsa beskow and john bauer are two swedish illustrators that influenced that immensely . 
  i fell in love with especially swedish forests through their works . 
  then there are a ton of older stuff , like the grimm brothers or h. c. andersen , or mythologies from various cultures . 
  i always loved that kind of stuff . 
  side note : my dad used to read a lot to me and my sister , but my memories with my mother tend to involve songs and lullabies rather than books . 
  i have almost as many fond memories of those as of books . 
  * knee-deep in snow * `` if i 'd only taken an extra pair of socks , everything would be fine . '', 
  * slips and falls * `` fine , i tell ya ! '', 
  you cringed at * that * ? 
  you 've seen nothing yet !, 
  here 's snl doing a [ swedish talkshow ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol3kudtizty&amp;t ) . 
  [ i do ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6wmvilqnrw ) . 
  there are a lot of american tv series that i watch . 
  i 'm a huge nerd and sweden ca n't really compete with the us when it comes to sci fi , fantasy or super hero shows . 
  but for comedy i almost always turn to the uk . 
  i love their humor and their game shows , and i 've yet to see something - anything - from the us compete with the latter . 
  it * should * exist since there are plenty of american comedians ( and some sitcoms ) i like , but i 've just never really found any such shows that i really fancy . 
  the ones i 've seen have n't clicked with me in the way even a lot of the oddball british ones do . 
  i 'm a bit curious about where , exactly , the southern edge of siberia actually is and how much the temperature changes along the way . 
  i 've never really thought of that before . 
  it feels like people generally ( me included ) think of the northern edge of it , which for all i know could be just as ignorant as thinking that the very north of sweden is all there is to us . 
  hahahaha , that accent coach !, 
  :d i 've seen a few people on youtube claiming to teach similar things , and they 're always truly awful . 
  this thread reminded me of the `` the producers '' . 
  the only movie that gets a pass when it comes to godawful accents ( and stereotypes in general ) everywhere , purely by being genuinely hilarious when doing them . 
  surprisingly little . 
  when i grew up and drilled the european map and all of its countries into my head , yugoslavia was still on it . 
  therefore , the post-yugoslavia countries have always been a bit hard to nail down for me ( even after all these years ) . 
  i visited croatia and montenegro a few years ago , so i have at least some personal experience of those countries . 
  but serbia is a weird blind spot that i have . 
  i feel that i should know more than i actually do . 
   seems to have a big problem with minefields would n't anyone ? 
  i have some personal problems keeping me home for long stretches of time during which i do n't see any people whatsoever , but when i 'm outside interacting with the rest of the world , i see a lot of people from a lot of different backgrounds . 
  the place where i live is very diverse . 
  that includes asians . 
  some of my favorites , even if my favorite swedish albums from the last few years have n't been pop albums .

  we got those too . 
  love them . 
  every bath is a bubble bath !, 
  if you just ask for a glass of water , in my experience , you always get still water . 
  when i order sparkling water , i always ask for either * mineralvatten * or one of the popular brands . 
  yeah , i thought about including him , but he died the year before i was born so i do n't have the same connection to him that i do to lindh . 
  but you 're quite right that it shook sweden at least as much if not more . 
  i remember this weird murder rate of ministers being commented upon before obama visited us one time . 
  it 's not something that i think swedes think about often , but apparently it 's something that foreign leaders are aware of when they visit us . 
  although our murders only happened because neither palme nor lindh walked around with any security at all ; obama was surrounded by a small country 's army and would n't have been harmed even if god himself got mad at him . 
  i do n't remember exactly . 
  i think that the murderer was mentally unstable , in the `` i 'll go around town with a knife in my pocket and stab someone random '' way . 
  i do n't think he had any grudge against her personally . 
  i do n't even know if he even knew * why * he suddenly recognized her face when he saw her , but when he did he stabbed her . 
  for ... some reason . 
  i suspect that he would have easily been ruled too mentally unstable to incarcerate if the person he killed had n't been our foreign minister . 
  i remember his case going before a lot of different psychiatrists who landed at that conclusion , before one finally did n't and that was the one who the court listened to . 
  it 's been nearly a decade and a half since the trial so i may remember some of it wrong , but yeah , he really did n't appear sane in any way to me .
