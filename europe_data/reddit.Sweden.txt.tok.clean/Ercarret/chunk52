  it 's an old viking settlement ( so from about the 8th century or so ) from which we 've excavated a ton of stuff that has allowed us to understand them better . 
  it 's a unesco world heritage site , and open for visitation . 
  the latter is housed in a museum in stockholm . 
  it was a majestic ship , supposed to be the crown jewel of the swedish fleet , but sank immediately on its maiden voyage in 1628 . 
  apparently `` more cannons !, 
  more cannons ! '', 
  is n't always the very best instruction in construction . 
  anyway , in the 1950s it was finally salvaged , restored and given its own museum . 
  if you 're ever in stockholm , i really recommend checking it out . 
  it 's not a good and seaworthy ship , but it is cool as hell . 
  they really went to town on the craftsmanship . 
  other than that , we have a ton of old viking stuff littered around the country . 
  rune stones , labyrinths , graves , that sort of thing . 
  my mom lives just beside an old viking burial site , for example . 
  our current king , carl xvi gustaf , is sometimes jokingly referred to as `` knugen '' . 
  it 's a misspelling of `` kungen '' , meaning `` the king '' . 
  i 'm not entirely sure where it comes from ( other than being about his dyslexia in general ) , but a quick google search says that when he was a kid , he was asked what he was going to be when he grew up and wrote `` knug '' ( `` king '' ) . 
  i do n't know if that 's true , but he has that nickname nonetheless . 
  it does n't surprise me that stuff like that exists around zlatan , but i have n't seen it myself . 
  as far as i know , we do n't have anyone that fills the chuck norris niche . 
  we had chuch norris and that was quite enough . 
  that said , there are a ton of memes about our current king defending his kingdom . 
  they vary from hilarious to ... less so . 
  i find them a lot funnier in swedish than in english , but here goes : first [ a meme ] ( http://gfx.bloggar.aftonbladet-cdn.se/wp-content/blogs.dir/428/files/2014/10/518.jpg ) that does n't need an explanation . 
  then [ a meme ] ( http://gfx.bloggar.aftonbladet-cdn.se/wp-content/blogs.dir/428/files/2014/10/bonus-1024x768.png ) that needs a translation : it says something along the lines of `` come at me , goddammit '' . 
  and finally [ a meme ] ( http://gfx.bloggar.aftonbladet-cdn.se/wp-content/blogs.dir/428/files/2014/10/226.jpg ) that needs context and translation : russian military has a tendency to enter our waters and airspace without permission from time to time , and a couple of years ago there was this huge hullabaloo with regards to a possible russian submarine sighting . 
  the text is something like , `` russian submarines ? 
  that 's fucking it '' . 
  i suggest that she contacts the uk embassy in poland and asks them about her options . 
  even if no one knows exactly what the rules will be when you 've actually left the eu , your embassy still probably knows a lot of things that could be useful for her ( and you ) to know . 
  i mean , i 'm sure this kind of situation happens quite a lot ( just with less brexit-related uncertainty ) . 
  perhaps they could describe the visa process for a hypothetical scenario where she is n't a citizen of a country whose travel rights are in such flux at the moment , and instead imagine that she comes from a country that does n't enjoy free movement to the uk ? 
  that might help you prepare for a worst case scenario , if that were to occur eventually . 
  or maybe there is a simple ( ish ) solution that you have n't thought of yet , because you lack certain information that they might provide you with . 
  i think that one of the worst things you could do is to just guess and assume , and base your decisions on the conclusions you reach that way . 
  get as official information as you can , and plan from there . 
  for us it would be gustav vasa . 
  he established the modern state of sweden in the 16th century . 
  i do n't know if i 'd say he 's `` revered '' , but people are definitely well-aware of his importance in our history . 
  if swedes know one king , they probably know him ( even if i think that gustavus adolphus - an important king later on - is more internationally recognized ) . 
  not from stockholm it is n't . 
  indeed it is . 
  i can sometimes envy you central european countries because of just that . 
  seems so nice . 
  i absolutely adore tuscany , but i only stayed at a small hotel out in the countryside . 
  visited florence briefly ( beautiful city , just like the rest of the area ) , but did n't stay there or see especially many of the sights . 
  i do n't know where else to go from there , but i would suggest checking out a train for transport . 
  i imagine that traveling comfortably through the tuscan countryside is quite amazing . 
  where do you live ? 
  i wish the same was true for all of us , but as someone living on the schengen border , there are plenty of countries that seem pretty far off from my point of view . 
  you really do n't like any of your neighbors , do you ? 
  i would totally watch the movie about the event that left europe looking like that . 
  some sort of epic michael bay/roland emmerich co-production . 
  i guess it depends on how you view it . 
  the ferry ride would take a while , sure , but getting on and off the ferry is fairly quick , and being on the ferry is quite pleasant . 
  you can eat at the buffet , watch a movie or go to a bar and listen to some music . 
  you set off in the afternoon , arrive in the morning and can go around town doing stuff for a few hours before setting off again in the afternoon , arriving back in stockholm the next morning . 
  nice times all around . 
  me and my family used to do this all the time when i was younger . 
  compare that to road tripping down through sweden , denmark and finally into germany . 
  you ca n't do a short weekend vacation out of that . 
  i can and do enjoy road trips immensely , but they leave me exhausted in a whole different way , and they necessitate a longer vacation because of that . 
  i would n't mind having germany as an eastern neighbor instead of finland . 
  i love going to germany , so being able to just take a ferry over real quick would be wonderful . 
  i have a bachelor 's degree in sociology . 
  i was looking for another speech by olof palme , but i found [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3hk8ubv7mg ) instead . 
  kind of scary that we 're in the same shit with racism and bigotry today as we were 50 years ago , but it 's a good speech nonetheless . 
  there 's always [ kladdkaka ] ( http://foodelicious.se/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/2011-01-091.jpg ) . 
  this is probably `` the '' swedish dessert i can think of . 
  we also have [ princess cake ] ( http://www.ica.se/imagevaultfiles/id_44939/cf_6901/princesstarta-526115.jpg ) , a close second . 
  whenever you celebrate something , you have this . 
  it 's sort of a litmus test of swedishness ; have something else on your birthday and you have n't earned your wings yet . 
  then there 's [ chokladbollar ] ( http://ikoketmedanders.se/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/chokladbollar-delicato.jpg ) ( `` chocolate balls '' ) . 
  extremely popular since they 're so very easy to do , and just as tasty . 
  me , my little sister and our grandmother used to do them all the time when i was a kid . 
  i could name more , but i feel that i 've mentioned some of them in similar threads already . 
  well , [ n\u00e4r vi gr\u00e4ver guld i usa ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_aa7awpc6s8 ) was written for a very specific thing : the '94 football world cup in the united states . 
  but it has seared itself into my memory as the best `` go out and win '' song there is . 
  more than 20 years later , i still love the song . 
  it really is about how we are going to go to the us and overcome everything in our path to take home the gold , no matter how many people have doubted us or how many loved ones we 've forsaken in our attempt to get there . 
  i mean , we did n't * actually * win the gold in the end , but winning the bronze was pretty fucking glorious for a nation of our size . 
  i can respect a lot of different toppings on pizza - regardless if i personally would like them or not - but chocolate ? 
  it seems like it would change the pizza from actual food to a snack of some kind . 
  the image on that website really messes with my head . 
  as a native swede , i find it a little difficult to speak for how important it is for foreigners to speak swedish in our society . 
  but i 'll try my best , from what i 've heard foreigners say . 
  and what i 've heard is that sweden can be a bit of a tricky country to live in , especially if you are a native english speaker . 
  we generally speak so good english that you can get by alright by only speaking it , but people seem to find it difficult to take that last step into full integration if they do n't speak swedish . 
  it probably does n't help that we are a bit notorious for switching to english as soon as we hear someone struggle with swedish ( which usually leads them to switch to english as well ) , rather than to allow them to practice their swedish . 
  i do n't remember much from the swedish film `` kopps '' , but i 've always loved [ this dream sequence ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=much5x98rxg ) from it . 
  and also : [ kung fury ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_diwugbna ) . 
  blackadder i love . 
  father ted i 've heard of . 
  green wing i do n't recognize at all . 
  kitkat pizza sounds weird even to me , but otherwise they do n't seem to have anything on us . 
  hamburger pizza ? 
  [ we 've got that covered ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ha86cwkd50u ) . 
  and i also present the mighty [ vulkan pizza ] ( https://gfx.aftonbladet-cdn.se/image/20988631/960/normal/43f0ddd20b947/pizzan.jpg ) !, 
  those two are from the north of sweden , though . 
  the people in the north of sweden - they 're a special bunch .
