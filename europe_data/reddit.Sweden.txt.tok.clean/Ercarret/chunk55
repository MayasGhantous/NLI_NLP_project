  well , i 've seen americans compare swedish to russian , so let 's count them out of this , okay ? 
  :p but interesting videos . 
  i can kinda see the comparison to simlish . 
  not in that it actually sounds like what the sims speak - it does n't - but since i 'm * waaaay * more familiar with the irish accent ( on spoken english ) than i am with the irish language in itself , it felt a bit odd to see irish people actually speak irish . 
  you hear the accent and immediately think , `` oh , i should understand this '' ... but then you do n't . 
  i 'd guess it 's that quality that makes people draw the comparisons . 
  a language that makes you think of english , yet is n't . 
  wonder if that 's the same reason why we 're compared to simlish sometimes ? 
  should n't be since our accent is n't as well-known ( and certainly not on english ) . 
  but then the question is , why * are * we compared to it ? 
  sing-songy i hear all the time . 
  gay , only from finns . 
  but they , on the other hand , * really * seem to think so . 
  whatever 's down there just grows more solid with age . 
  soon they 'll just be making choking sounds , and eventually , whenever a dane goes out to eat , well-meaning people will line up to perform the heimlich maneuver on them whether they need it or not . 
  to op : irish is seen as similar to scandinavian languages ? 
  strange , i 've never heard the reverse . 
  i * have * heard that we sound similar to simlish , though . 
  i honestly would n't be surprised if all of our nordic neighbors have similar laws that `` just have n't been officially repealed '' . 
  i do n't think we have a law for individuals wearing them , but there are laws requiring them on various non-car vehicles . 
  you even have to have them on a wheelchair if you 're out in one . 
  i fully agree with that , and am not sure i would disagree with a law similar to yours regarding individuals . 
  it gets really dark here , and i know from experience ( as a car passenger looking out ) how difficult it can be to see stuff that 's hidden in the dark in time to stop . 
  luckily i have n't been involved in an accident involving a pedestrian , but dammit , wear your reflectors people !, 
  now i imagine tenerife someday getting a governor ( or whatever the highest office there would be ) who just slams his gavel down and orders the police to arrest everyone building sandcastles . 
  tons and tons of tourists and locals alike ushered into a football stadium , in shackles , awaiting deportation either to their homeland or just mainland spain . 
  well , my first thought is that i 'm not sure if there are mountains , forests and oceans within hiking distance of each other . 
  you might have to settle for one or maybe a pair of them ( or move around a bit ) . 
  i would suggest checking out [ this link ] ( http://www.nationalparksofsweden.se/seeing-and-doing/ ) . 
  it lists all of the national parks and what you can do in them . 
  it should give you an idea about where you could go to see the most of what you want to see . 
  if you want mountains , i would recommend [ sarek ] ( http://www.nationalparksofsweden.se/choose-park---list/sarek-national-park/ ) as a starting point . 
  i do n't know if sarek is the `` best '' park for mountain hiking , but it 's probably the most famous of our parks and it 's right in the middle of our most mountainous area . 
  [ stora sj\u00f6fallet national park ] ( http://www.nationalparksofsweden.se/choose-park---list/stora-sjofallet--stuor-muorkke-national-park/ ) , right beside sarek , might also be an alternative . 
  both of them are in the far north . 
  for forests , there 's [ dalby s\u00f6derskog national park ] ( http://www.nationalparksofsweden.se/choose-park---list/dalby-soderskog-national-park/ ) in southern sweden . 
  `` s\u00f6derskog '' literally means `` southern forest '' , so my guess is that this might be something you could be interested in . 
  even if there are * a lot * of forests in sweden , i kind of assume that this one might be a bit special if they make a national park around it . 
  if you want the ocean , you could go to either [ kosterhavet ] ( http://www.nationalparksofsweden.se/choose-park---list/kosterhavet-national-park/ ) on the west coast or [ gotska sand\u00f6n ] ( http://www.nationalparksofsweden.se/choose-park---list/gotska-sandon-national-park/ ) on the east coast . 
  you can , among other things , go snorkeling in the former and seal-sightseeing in the latter . 
  with all of this said , i have n't gone through all of the parks and i have n't looked into which ones offer several of the sights you want to see . 
  i would suggest you look through the list of them yourself to see which one suits your needs best . 
  ( i had n't actually planned to pick parks in the very north , south , east and west of sweden , but that was how it turned out and i guess it demonstrates a bit how the different parts of sweden offer different experiences . ), 
  i had no idea we had any of those until i dug up that link in my previous comment , but apparently there are two coral reefs in the `` koster sea '' ( not sure what the proper english name for it is , but it 's called `` kosterhavet '' in swedish ) . 
  one of them lies in kosterhavet national park , while the other one was recently ( 2013 ) discovered a bit south of there . 
  i ca n't find a good map that marks where the national park is in an easy-to-see way , but it 's on the west coast , just below where our border with norway begins . 
  edit : [ google maps ] ( https://www.google.se/maps/place/kosterhavets+nationalpark/@61.760326,10.4411126,5.02z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x46442538187e8c47:0x17f44945d52abe44!8m2!3d58.8371072!4d11.03445 ) . 
  everyone who is n't , is failing at life . 
  * looks at all the comments about various countries not having enough space for national parks * well ... * looks at sweden 's immense , untouched wildlife areas * we have 29 national parks . 
  about 730,000 hectares of them . 
  mountains and forests and archipelago and coral reefs - we have half a dozen major habitat types . 
  [ more info here ] ( http://www.nationalparksofsweden.se/ ) , if anyone 's interested . 
  i have some problems with my feet that makes it hard to walk , which makes taking trips like those difficult . 
  when i was a bit younger me and my family used to go out to or near the beach and grill using these [ one-time grills ] ( http://tyda.se/img/608da24a1e6e6941ee1b0d5fff82f9ab.jpg ) . 
  i loved doing that , but it has become a bit more difficult nowadays because of ... reasons . 
  i 'm not sure if skiing is a `` sport-related activity '' or not . 
  there certainly are ski sports , but that 's not really what i 'm doing personally when i 've skied in the past . 
  i do n't actually race or anything , just sort of tumble uncontrollably down mountains hoping not to hit a tree or something . 
  having coffee and pastries is also a very common occurrence . 
  you might go out to a cafe , or you might meet at someone 's home and `` fika '' ( as we call it ) there . 
  not really when they 're in their apartments , but i can hear people in the corridor outside as if they were right beside me . 
  usually not a problem at night , though , so i do n't care . 
  the only thing that can be bothersome is if someone moves in or out of an apartment , or if there is some renovating done . 
  the actual renovations are usually pretty silent as long as they do n't drill or something , but workers dragging or driving stuff through the corridor can make a ruckus . 
  [ cashen dom tas ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daovljhkks8 ) - the latin kings . 
  my heroes growing up . 
  the area i come from was always painted unfairly in a negative light whenever it was mentioned in the news , but tlk came from here and put us on the map for something else . 
  [ alla vill till himlen men ingen vill d\u00f6 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv759wmssfk ) - timbuktu . 
  probably the best swedish rapper . 
  i love this song . 
  [ repa skivan ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pubahwcq-3w ) - petter featuring afc . 
  petter is the one contender to timbuktu 's position . 
  this song is just unbelievably catchy . 
  [ inga problem ( remix ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bj5woznl4ik ) - snook featuring petter & veronica maggio . 
  i love snook all on their own , but together with petter and veronica maggio they just created magic with this song . 
  [ ey g\u00e4ri ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvwcede6pqq ) - linda pira featuring molly sand\u00e9n . 
  some girl power . 
  i had a hard time deciding between this song and pira 's `` kn\u00e4pper mina fingrar '' , but in the end i think that this is the better song . 
  ** bonus : ** [ helt alene ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj7f14vitfk ) - suspekt featuring anna dickow . 
  a danish hip hop group . 
  i like them ... but not as much as the swedish artists . 
  me hardly understanding a word they say might have something to do with it , since the lyrics are an important aspect for why i like most of the songs above . 
  ** bonus 2 : ** [ augenbling ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qttgj3il62y ) - seeed . 
  super catchy german hip hop group . 
  sadly the german original ( that i link to here ) is n't available on spotify . 
  cool !, 
  how is her russian ? 
  any good ? 
  i do n't know the male singer , but listening to that song i realized just how much i miss turunen 's voice . 
  i have n't heard anything from her since she left nightwish ; barely even the old nightwish songs with her . 
  i must rectify that post-haste . 
  well , no one but swedes ( and a small minority of finns ) know swedish , so i 'm not aware of any collaborations where both artists sing in swedish . 
  well , except for when petter enlisted american rapper fabulous for a remix of his song [ det g\u00e5r bra nu ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgtgxyfqsce ) . 
  fabulous does his best with his , uh , one swedish line . 
  but it 's not exactly * the * best international collaboration in swedish music history . 
  i like this song , [ ff ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7jgiz81vmy ) , better . 
  it 's by swedish ( former ) rock band kent , along with french singer nancy danino . 
  it 's not kent 's best song in any way , but i still really like it . 
  i also really like danino 's contribution to it . 
  i live just outside the capital so there are at least tourists nearby , even if they generally do n't visit the southern suburbs .
