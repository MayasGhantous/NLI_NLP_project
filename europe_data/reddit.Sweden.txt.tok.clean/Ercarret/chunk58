  really funny dude , though . 
  one of the best guys i 've known , so i certainly have a positive impression of the chilean culture i gleaned from being around him . 
  i do n't have any personal experience with cubans , though . 
  my opinions of cuba are mostly tied to political stuff . 
  hopefully us normalizing relations with cuba can lead to something good down the line . 
  the blockade never really made sense to me . 
  hahaha !, 
  so many languages are indo european , i have a hard time coming up with european languages that are n't . 
  i guess the finno-ugric languages are a different family , so i 'll pick finnish . 
  i do n't understand it despite being half-finnish ( thanks , mom , for not learning me the family 's language !, 
  ) , but i hear or see it every now and again due to ( especially eastern ) sweden 's proximity to them . 
  i just wish i knew it better , so that i could actually appreciate it more . 
  hahaha , i love satw !, 
  fun fact : the \u00fc is actually commonly called a `` tyskt y '' ( `` german y '' ) in swedish , so when both are pronounced correctly they should sound pretty similar . 
  haha , interesting list of car brands to have nicknames for . 
  i only recognized half of them . 
  kind of fascinating to see some small proof of how the former cold war divide still influences minor cultural things , even today . 
  wait , shakira is the queen of the swedish forest muslims ? 
  i think this clears things up . 
  they may be packing explosive material , but the only thing they want to blow up is the charts . 
  one of my all-time strongest vacation memories is from when i was a kid and my family went to copenhagen . 
  we stayed at a hotel that served pastries as part of the breakfast and me and my little sister were in seventh heaven . 
  i think that it speaks to the quality of the rest of the breakfast that we did n't just munch on pastries for a week straight . 
  but i could have . 
  oh boy , could i have . 
  i do n't know if i would classify any swedish bread as tasty specialties , but we do have two that comes to mind : * [ kn\u00e4ckebr\u00f6d ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crispbread ) * [ tunnbr\u00f6d ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tunnbr%c3%b6d ) . 
  the former is a pretty versatile crispbread , while the main reason to care about the latter is because it can be made into [ a roll with mashed potatoes , fried onion , hot dogs and maybe some veggies ] ( http://blogg.vinkocken.se/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/img_7105.jpg ) . 
  when i look at * tunnbr\u00f6dsrullar * i just ca n't grasp how it is that sweden is n't seen as the culinary mecca it is ... in this one case . 
  oh my god . 
  who else may be up there ? 
  i 've thought that the north is largely empty space , but now ... ? 
  endless possibilities !, 
  what kind of monster would hate the moose ? 
  that just ai n't right , goddammit . 
  but , true , we do n't really have any rogue tribes of forest muslims deep in our woods , terrorizing the local wildlife . 
  not that that fact is likely to convince trump that they do n't threaten our very existence . 
  i guess i do n't really have to answer since we 're constant rivals in a lot of these cross country skiing competitions . 
  you guys do seem to be better at keeping your team strength consistent through the years , though . 
  our successes ( and thus our interest ) flows a bit more up and down with time . 
  sometimes we 're really good , but then when those guys retire we do n't always have any new talent coming up behind them . 
  i do n't know if i can speak for sweden in general when i say this , so i 'll just say it for myself and maybe others can jump in and say if they agree with me - but to me , all of my interest in cross country skiing depends on how good we are . 
  i prefer biathlon simply because i think it 's a fun mix of stuff , but by and large i follow whatever we 're good in . 
  if that 's biathlon , then i follow that . 
  if it 's something else , then i follow that instead . 
  i am such a huge fan of skiing in general that i can watch more or less any kind , as long as i feel that i have someone to root for . 
  tsch\u00fcss does have a t-sound in it that kyss does n't have , but schiss has a i-sound that kyss does n't have . 
  * shrugs * both sound pretty similar to kyss , even if neither is a perfect match . 
  `` sch\u00fcss '' would probably be as close as it 's possible to come . 
  still , some differences aside , i do find it amusingly similar . 
  it was an easy word to learn in german class and it makes me smile when i hear it . 
  when the last star has gone out in the universe and the very fabric of reality is falling apart , the moose will still be alright . 
  i missed * p\u00e5 sp\u00e5ret * friday evening . 
  had an annoying phone call earlier in the day . 
  and i 'm pretty sure i had the worst day of any swede . 
  maybe he 's right ? 
  maybe we 've just missed it ? 
  you know the old philosophical conundrum : if a bomb goes off deep in the swedish forests and no one is around to notice it , is it still a worthy justification for a muslim ban ? 
  yes , apparently to trump it is . 
  the one sane country above the crazy masses beneath ? 
  i think the fact that we have a hard and a soft `` k '' sound confuses foreigners . 
  even if i think it should be pretty easy to understand if you think of the two ways `` ch '' is pronounced in `` choir '' and `` choke '' , respectively . 
  it 's the same principle . 
  the `` sj '' sound is a little harder to define . 
  that tends to be a hard one to learn , from what i 've heard . 
  `` sjuksk\u00f6terska '' is something you really have to master a lot of swedish to pronounce correctly , since you both need to be able to do the `` sj '' sound and tell when one `` sk '' is hard and the other one is soft . 
  when it is soft , it also does a slightly different sound than a regular soft k . if you know english , it can also be a little difficult to express affection . 
  `` sex '' can indeed mean sex even in swedish , but it 's also our name for the number 6 . 
  `` kiss '' means `` pee '' in swedish , while `` puss '' is our word for `` kiss '' . 
  another swedish word for `` kiss '' ( `` kyss '' ) also sounds pretty much exactly like the german `` tsch\u00fcss '' ( meaning `` goodbye '' ) . 
  it makes an ordinary goodbye sound like the ending of a fourteen year old girl 's text message - `` kisses ! '' . 
  my german relatives use `` tsch\u00fcss '' a lot , and i always have to remember that it 's just a regular farewell . 
  hahaha , awesome . 
  i would love to be a fly on the wall in situations like those , where translators probably just go , `` how ... what ... can we ... maybe we could ... bah , fuck it . 
  fuck it all to hell and just write something . '', 
   it 's not the hottest continent . 
  very true . 
  have n't been outside of europe yet . 
  not sure how well i 'd do in most places , seeing how i can barely cope with central european summer . 
  :p i generally do n't go vacationing in southern europe , instead preferring the countries around the alps ( and while that includes italy , i usually only go to the northern parts of the country ) . 
  crete is probably the warmest place i 've been to , but i was too young to be aware of specific temperatures when i was there . 
  speaking of hailing golf balls : i still feel kind of bad for my german relatives who had left their car out in the open to make room in the garage for ours when we roadtripped down to bavaria once . 
  when the hailing started there was n't much to do , so their car got completely mauled . 
  weather : it 's crazy . 
  i do n't think so . 
  the highest temperature i 'm aware of having experienced is 35 c when i was in rome . 
  that was hellish ; although , really , anything over 25 is already pretty hellish for a northerner like me . 
  but i guess it 's possible that it climbed above 40 c when i was in crete , greece as a kid . 
  i did n't keep track of the exact temperature ( since i was only six years old or thereabout ) , but it gave me the worst burns i 've ever gotten . 
  granted , it was my first time in non-scandinavian sun so it 's possible that i 'd gotten burns even if it was n't 40 + degrees , but i still remember the heat as being thoroughly oppressive . 
  where did you experience such heat ? 
  i have n't experienced anything like it even when i was in southern europe . 
  wandered around in rome in 35 degree heat , and thank god for those public water stations they had all over the place . 
  would n't have made it around otherwise . 
  i do n't watch a ton of foreign movies ( other than us/uk ones ) anymore , but i did use to watch german movies when i was younger . 
  one of my favorites is `` lola rennt '' ( `` run lola run '' in english ) . 
  one movie i 'd really like to see but have n't seen available anywhere is the norwegian catastrophe movie `` the wave '' . 
  i 've heard a lot of good things about it and i really want to see how that type of movie works in a scandinavian setting . 
  it kind of reminds me of a particular swedish sausage , which is probably why i refer to it as such . 
  but in all honesty , i 'm not really sure * what * it is . 
  except yummy .
