  haha , well , a little more often than that . 
  yeah , we have * svenska akademien * . 
  not only do they publish the occasional , official swedish dictionaries , they are also in charge of the nobel prize in literature . 
  they also give out a bunch of more swedish/nordic-centric prizes . 
  none of that really applies to swedes . 
  at least not in my experience . 
  we move out quickly and grandparents do n't move in with their children . 
  i ca n't really speak for other people 's family gatherings , but in my family it 's usually at most five people who meet at holidays etc. 
  six when my grandmother was still alive . 
  part of this is probably that my mom and dad divorced when i was young , and therefor kind of separated the family into two distinct branches that rarely overlap , but even so i have a hard time seeing any kind of `` whole extended family '' gatherings . 
  but i mean , we all love each other and try to see each other every once in a while . 
  i speak with both of my parents regularly and if it were n't for some medical stuff preventing me i would visit them a lot more than i currently do . 
  especially me , my sister and my dad try to go out and eat together whenever we can . 
  real swedish meatballs !, 
  :d if i were to choose something a bit more serious , i really like our [ dalecarlian horses ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dalecarlian_horse ) . 
  they just scream `` sweden '' ( or more specifically `` dalarna '' , which is a region in sweden ) to me . 
  i guess you could get one of those for under 20 euro . 
  or for a lot more than 20 euro , if you 're feeling fancy . 
  in terms of what i 'd like to have from other countries , i do like some finnish salmiakki . 
  my mom goes over there a lot and i always ask her to buy me some when she 's there . 
  we do have our own swedish stuff and i do like some of that , but ... i do n't know . 
  i grew up with the finnish ones . 
  i also miss a kind of sausage ( i guess ? ), 
  from germany that i used to eat while visiting my relatives there , known as '' [ leberk\u00e4se ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leberk%c3%a4se ) '' . 
  i can miss german sausages in general too , but that one in particular i 've never seen in swedish stores . 
  my dad also constantly remembers that i like a certain danish cider . 
  probably more than i do . 
  but since i 'm not really a trinket person ( as these examples probably show ) , he tends to buy a lot of that cider to me whenever he 's in denmark . 
  oh , i did n't mean to imply you did anything wrong ; you most certainly did not . 
  i was just a little surprised due to my own preconceived notions of what to expect , is all . 
  now that you mentioned the lemon slice i remember having a really good schnitzel at a swedish restaurant . 
  the lemon is somehow my strongest memory from that meal . 
  everything was tastier than i 'd expected , and somehow that included the lemon . 
  i 'd always figured that lemon tasted like lemon ; basically that there were n't too much variation in either taste or quality there . 
  but that meal proved me wrong , because that lemon tasted better than any i 'd ever had before . 
  really enhanced the schnitzel . 
  just some random , kind of tangential observation . 
  hm , i do n't really know how to describe myself in terms more precise than `` from stockholm '' , even though i identify more with my particular suburb and municipality than with stockholm as a city . 
  with that disclaimer in place , the rest of my demonyms are as follows : stockholmare , svensk , skandinav , nordisk , europ\u00e9 . 
  in english : someone from stockholm , sweden , scandinavia , the nordic countries and europe . 
  haha , that threw me for a loop initially . 
  i recognized the language as greenlandic so i was sure everything would translate to various greenlandic locations in english . 
  when you translated it into danish stuff , it spun my head a bit . 
  had to read on to realize you 'd moved there from greenland , and used the greenlandic to describe yourself in both locations . 
  we have a lot of strange pizza , [ or so i 've heard ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/johan-kugelberg/swedish-pizza_b_1608146.html ) . 
  but if you 've never had a kebab pizza or one with bananas , chicken and curry , you have n't really lived . 
  you 've merely scraped by in a grey and joyless world . 
  how do you eat it then ? 
  meat + pasta/potatoes/whatever + some sauce ( and maybe some veggies ) tends to be how i structure most meals . 
  or is it just the schnitzel you do n't have sauce on , while you have it to the rest of the meal ? 
   heat them up in the oven haha , i remember seeing a video of some poor american doing swedish meatballs in the oven . 
  he got roasted in the comments by `` purists '' , who still could n't agree on a `` real '' way to make them among themselves . 
  but they all agreed that making them in the oven was a foul practice . 
  :p i usually just fry them in a pan , but i can throw them in the oven if i ( like you ) do something there at the same time . 
  see no reason to be angry about that particular aspect of it , but i was apparently a clear minority among the comments under that video . 
  hahaha , yeah , i remember a guy from some `` surstr\u00f6mming society '' or whatever going completely mental when buzzfeed did a video where they ate it wrong . 
  i can be a little annoyed when people just shove it down as if that 's how swedes would eat it , but mostly i just shrug and laugh a little at them . 
  not my tradition , though . 
  i live a bit too far south , i think . 
  before clicking on the imgur link : `` woo !, 
  swedish cuisine is spreading !, 
  the joy of that is greater than my annoyance over any deviations ! '', 
  after clicking on the link : `` whaaaaat the hell ... ? 
  who even uses that much butter ? 
  and who then thinks that combining that much butter with two kinds of cheese , as well as both heavy and sour cream is good on * anything * ? '', 
  people would just pronounce the `` right '' word differently depending on the language they 're used to speaking , and after a while we 'd still end up with different names for countries in different countries . 
  it might even out some obvious differences between some groups of people , but overall i think it would be a pretty futile attempt with no real benefit . 
  how do you even drive 1600 km in a day ? 
  google says its about a 18 hour drive . 
  it pretty much exactly matches the distance between me and the town where my german relatives live , but i ca n't recall ever having done that trip in one go . 
  i guess it 's possible , but it really clashes with my idea of a pleasant trip . 
  i 'd really prefer to have a break halfway through that drive . 
  yeah , it 's quite the distance . 
  i have occasionally driven for longer stretches than that when going on vacation , but i have a hard time imagining doing that just for a day trip . 
  seems like you 'd waste basically the entire day in the car . 
  but if you huff it down to germany or italy in a few days and then have a week or two to actually spend there , then it 's a different story altogether . 
  i love doing that . 
  no , i 've never seen anything like that coming in either the mail or my inbox . 
  it reminds me slightly of some things you can see in certain magazines , but you have to go out of your way to get them yourself ; they wo n't come to you . 
  heh , when i first read your comment i thought you said `` cc is only really meant for possible victims of terrorism or [ members of the ] mafias '' . 
  the latter group seemed like a weird one to legally arm . 
  had to reread the sentence , but now it seems quite sensible . 
  it 's a bit hard to compare since at least sweden 's political system is quite different from that in the us . 
  we do n't have a president , so there is no opportunity for any one individual to rise to that kind of power . 
  we also do n't have a two-party system , so political power is distributed across seven or eight parties . 
  if seven out of those eight parties disagrees with the eight , it 's possible to minimize their influence even if they gain a significant number of votes . 
  that said , having that eight party gain a significant number of votes still causes some problems . 
  it 's after midnight here so i 'm too tired to go into specifics , but having them leech votes from the other parties is a bad thing in several ways . 
  especially when some of the other parties decide that the best way to gain these votes back is by utilizing the same anti-immigration rhetoric of the supposed pariah . 
  really ? 
  a shame . 
  i quite like the swedish one . 
  it 's fun to read for a foreigner 's perspective on our country ( even if i read my actual news elsewhere ) . 
  it was a long time since i was a kid , but i 'll do my best to remember . 
  i 've already seen a lot of stuff i used to play , so i 'll try to not repeat anything . 
  if some of these things are a little too indoorsy to fit the playground aspect of the question , please remember that we kids tried our best to not have to go out into the biting cold whenever we could . 
  :p the first thing i remembered was having a big sack of ** marbles ** and playing the other kids . 
  that was a hoot . 
  loved collecting them , probably more than actually playing with them . 
  i also remember that we used to play a variant of ** ping pong ** during recess .
