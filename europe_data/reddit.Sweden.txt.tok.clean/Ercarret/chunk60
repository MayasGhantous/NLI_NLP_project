  but since we only had one table and not enough time for everyone to play one-on-one matches against each other , everyone just formed a circle around the table and then hit the ball from one side to the other while constantly moving . 
  everyone moved in a circle , and every time someone missed that someone was out . 
  as people continued to drop off , you 'd have to run faster and faster to be able to get to the other side of the table in time to get to the ball . 
  eventually , if time allowed , you 'd have an ordinary game between the final two people left . 
  do n't remember if this game had any specific name , though . 
  and since i 'm from sweden : ** snow ball fights ** . 
  so many snow ball fights . 
  we had a small brook running in the forest outside of our school , so there was a natural dividing line for two teams . 
  i have a vague memory of us playing a lot of ** cards ** as well ( when i was a little older ) . 
  poker , probably . 
  you could always check out [ the local ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/ ) . 
  it was originally a site for swedish news in english ( so that expats could understand what was happening in the country ) , but it has since spread to other countries as well . 
  they also have a lot of other interesting stuff besides news , such as articles about various traditions in sweden ( or whatever country 's edition you read ) . 
  if something bad happens they report on it , but you 'll quickly see that the reality is quite different from how negatively it 's sometimes portrayed in international media . 
  ca n't speak for the other editions of the local , but i assume that they 're about as good/interesting/fascinating as the swedish one . 
  they seem to be : * [ peace & love ] ( https://www.peaceandlove.se/ ) ( i ca n't seem to find any english setting for this website , so it 's in swedish . ), 
  * [ sweden rock ] ( http://www.swedenrock.com/en/ ) * [ br\u00e5valla ] ( http://www.bravallafestival.se/en/ ) i do n't know which one is , objectively , most popular though . 
  various sources seems to say different things . 
  oh , that video made my day . 
  haha , yeah , i know . 
  deep down , at least . 
  my understanding of sk\u00e5nska have not prepared me for danish in any way ( not to mention west coast danish , my god ... ) . 
  there 's always [ the north ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urgdiaz4qng ) on a more serious note , it kind of depends . 
  people from stockholm make fun of everyone , and everyone makes fun of people from stockholm . 
  then there 's `` sk\u00e5nska '' , from the very south of sweden , that gets made fun of because of it 's similarities with danish ( which in itself is often made fun of ) . 
  but in the end i think that the prize goes to `` gn\u00e4llb\u00e4ltet '' , which translates as `` the whine belt '' . 
  i 'll let you draw your own conclusions regarding how other swedes view the dialects of the people from that area . 
  hahaha , cool . 
  football and ice hockey . 
  i also think that horse riding ( as in jumping over stuff , not racing ) is silently enormous . 
  you do n't hear much from them in the day to day coverage of sports , but as soon as this annual people 's choice sport award comes around , and a rider has done something exceptional the previous year , they always seem to be able to mobilize . 
  the day after the ceremony everyone is perplexed as to how that ( relatively ) little-known outsider could have won against some of the more well-known athletes or teams who were also in the running for the same award . 
   roller hockey is that a thing ? 
  never heard of it , but it sounds awesome . 
  it depends on what you mean by `` speak english '' . 
  i basically never actually speak english in my everyday life , since there 's no need for it . 
  but i read , write and hear it every day , which means that my english in those areas is vastly superior compared to my spoken english . 
  i 'd guess that is probably the case for a lot of swedes , unless you work in some field that requires spoken english or at least live a little closer to touristy places than i do . 
  ca n't speak for the it field . 
  there are a lot of really nice small towns in sweden that are probably overlooked by foreigners who flock to the bigger cities . 
  i like going to some of these every now and again ; they 're really charming . 
  gr\u00e4nna is one of those , even if i find it a bit hard to judge exactly how `` touristy '' it is . 
  it 's most definitely known to swedes , and since it 's close to one of the main highways it kind of automatically gets a ton of visitors each year . 
  but i rarely hear it being promoted internationally as some of our other more famous tourist destinations , so it might not be a place foreign visitors come to see a lot . 
  either way , it is a place i recommend . 
  the town is famous for it 's '' [ polkagrisar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polkagris ) '' . 
  [ lots ] ( http://www.polkagrisar.se/polkagris%20i1.png ) and [ lots ] ( http://wilmaroos.me.formecdn.com/2014/07/19447-image-223.jpg?w=980&amp; ) of [ polkagrisar ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ijfa4j2ibsk/maxresdefault.jpg ) . 
  it 's a sort of candy similar to a candy cane ( but without the christmas connotations ) . 
  there are tons of stores selling these treats in the summer , in all kinds of different flavors . 
  a lovely place , even if you ( like me ) do n't really like the candy . 
  not only is it also a really pleasant little town to walk through , they also have an awesome `` ice cream restaurant '' ( their words ) named smultronst\u00e4llet . 
  you have [ one of their ice creams ] ( http://media.basetool.se/productimage/143199/1004/3/183981/ ) , you 're basically set for the day . 
  i 'd say it 's pretty accurate . 
  studying at 100 % speed in sweden is considered the equivalent of a full-time job , so you do n't really have the time to work as well . 
  as a result you 're almost guaranteed to rack up quite some debt if you have to pay for rent , food etc by yourself . 
  especially if you study for a long time . 
  i do n't have a problem with ours . 
  the outrages i occasionally see tends to be more focused on the government giving them too broad tools to work with , rather than their specific use of those tools . 
  they are n't known to make any horrible transgressions ... they just have the means to do so , should they want to . 
  if that makes sense . 
  woltersworld is amazing !, 
  love that channel . 
  i guess `` svensson '' would be the swedish equivalent . 
  it is an actual swedish surname , but it tends to be used as `` the average swede '' in various circumstances due to how widespread it is . 
  i have a hard time seeing a different nationality as something that would , in itself , turn me off from someone i otherwise liked . 
  there might be certain cultural differences that could perhaps clash with my personality , and those might be more common in some other countries . 
  but there are plenty of swedes whose personalities clash with my own , so at the end of the day i still think it 's down to the individual . 
  i 've mostly been to italy and germany myself . 
  plus a lot of cruises to finland . 
  of them , i would recommend going to tuscany in italy . 
  i do n't think i 've ever been anywhere more beautiful . 
  i like germany ( and especially bavaria ) more than italy , in general , but i have * so * vivid memories of the rolling hills of tuscany that i ca n't help but recommend it first . 
  interesting !, 
  thanks . 
  okay , thanks . 
  i saw that several of those albums are on spotify , so i 've been binging them all day . 
  yup , more or less . 
  the one deviation in your map from the route i had in my head is that i would have traveled up along greece and then the mediterranean coast ( croatia etc ) when i returned from turkey . 
  but other than that you illustrated it rather well . 
   why did you ask the question in the first place ? 
  planning a trip or something ? 
  the only way for sweden to somehow end up in some kind of war being fought on our soil would be for things in the baltic sea to escalate to the point where russia and nato goes to war against each other . 
  that would probably drag us into it as well , regardless of whether or not we 've actually joined nato at the time . 
  we have a big island in a fairly strategic position that i guess both sides could potentially want to take control over . 
  but even so , i do n't think anyone would march on stockholm , which is where i live . 
  in either case , i do n't know if any of this would actually affect me all that much . 
  i 'm not healthy enough to fight ( or do much of anything , really ) , so i do n't really foresee any change to my current status quo . 
  the invaders would have to be either * really * dickish against the sick or a lot more understanding of our needs than our current government ; i do n't really see either happen , even in the unlikely scenario of a hypothetical invasion . 
  i suspect that taking a train would be the easiest way to get around europe , but i 've always been fond of driving around . 
  or being driven around , since i do n't have a driver 's license of my own . 
  but just a relaxed road trip , stopping whenever you want to see the sights or to eat or check in to some roadside b 'n' b : those are generally my favorite holidays . 
  so from sweden : take a plane to portugal , rent a car and just start driving east until i reached russia , then down eastern europe to turkey . 
  take a ferry over to cyprus , then to greece , and up through the former yugoslavian countries , past the baltic countries and up into finland . 
  drive to the far north , into norway , take a ferry to the british isles and from there a ferry to benelux . 
  drive through germany , to denmark and finally back to sweden . 
  i do n't know if that would hit each and every one of the european countries , but it 's as close as i can imagine it without giving a detailed country-by-country description of my travel . 
  i do n't really have the time or the patience to do one of those . 
  although , i must say : this much time in the car ( unless it 's spread out over a very long time ) would drive me mad , no matter how much i love road trips . 
  it would still be a pretty dope vacation , though . 
  thanks , i 'll give it a listen .
