  i ca n't even imagine how large a city it must be . 
  why not ? 
  wanting to go to the us is one thing . 
  i do too . 
  but wanting to go there more than visiting other european countries ? 
  i find that notion pretty odd , if for no other reason that it 's much simpler to visit other european countries than fly to the other side of the world . 
  to me , the us is similar to various places in africa , asia and south america : i would love to go there , sure , but it 's much more of a pipe dream than me wanting to visit spain or france . 
  happy to help . 
  i do n't know any podcasts , but it might interest you to know about [ the local ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/ ) . 
  originally a site for swedish news in english , it has since spread to a lot of other european countries as well . 
  even i as a native swede find the local fun to read occasionally . 
  they mix news ( which i find less interesting , since i can just read our newspapers ) with various cultural observation from expats living in sweden ( which is far more interesting ) . 
  a few examples of articles from the site : [ 16 traditions you need to follow to fake being a swede at christmas ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/20161208/traditions-you-need-to-follow-for-a-swedish-christmas ) - one of many articles about our various traditions . 
  [ eight differences between germany and sweden ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/20170202/coffee-cash-and-eurovision-eight-differences-between-germany-and-sweden ) - perhaps interesting in two ways , if you 're curious about germany as well . 
  [ trump 's presidency sees swedish interest in us trips halve ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/20170202/trumps-presidency-sees-swedish-interest-in-us-trips-halve ) - i saw , perhaps unsurprisingly , quite a lot about trump on the site . 
  we are quite aware of what happens in american politics , since it always affects us a great deal . 
  i ca n't speak for the other european editions of the site , but i assume that they too have their own articles where they dig into their various cultures . 
  huh , look at that . 
  did not know that . 
  that explains how nollywood can sustain itself . 
  at least to some extent . 
  cool . 
  i watched on a lot of the shows that other people have already linked to , so i wo n't link to them again . 
  but a swedish show i remember watching was * [ bamse - v\u00e4rldens starkaste bj\u00f6rn ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2uujlw5dtu ) * . 
  i like that one . 
  he 's always the world 's kindest bear , but when he drinks `` thunder honey '' he also becomes the world 's strongest bear . 
  the series has always just been so wonderfully wholesome , without being preachy . 
  it 's still ongoing , and nowadays bamse is [ teaching children ] ( http://www.bamse.se/wp-content/uploads/bamse_kallkritik_lilleskutt-1.jpg ) how to be critical of things written on the internet/in general : lille skutt , the bunny , says : `` bamse no longer gets strong by thunder honey !, 
  i read it on the internet ! '', 
  skalman , the turtle , responds : `` have you checked the source ? '', 
  i would suggest staying maybe a week in each country ( or in each hub of countries , if there are several close together ) . 
  trying to do more than that would probably only be exhausting , and would n't do justice to the places you visit . 
  it would probably take more than a week to see everything stockholm has to offer , and that 's only one city in one region in sweden : other cities and other regions offer just as much to see and do . 
  the same is true for the other countries in europe . 
  northern and southern germany are quite different as well , but both worth exploring . 
  berlin is a wonderful city , but i love bavaria . 
  if you 're travelling on a budget , you might be interested in examining which countries are expensive and which are ( relatively ) cheap . 
  here up north things tends to be more expensive than in the rest of europe , so perhaps a shorter stay here would be advisable while you stay a bit longer somewhere that puts a little less stress on your wallet . 
  some recommendations : ** tuscany ** ( italy ) is way more beautiful than anyone says it is . 
  i wholeheartedly recommend it . 
  ** bavaria ** ( germany ) , as i mentioned , is gorgeous . 
  you could use munich as a base , but i 've mostly spent my time in the countryside there . 
  ** tegernsee ** is a pearl southeast of munich . 
  if you time it so that they have one of their `` fests '' ( i was there at `` waldfest '' once , but i 'm sure there are more ) you 're bound to have a good time . 
  i have only been to ** croatia ** and ** montenegro ** briefly , but both were fantastic places that i heartily recommend . 
  gorgeous views , good food and cheep drinks . 
  if you do go up north , i recommend ** stockholm ** ( sweden ) . 
  it 's both a beautiful city in its own right , with an amazing archipelago , but you could also take a ferry over to finland for a day or so . 
  malm\u00f6 and copenhagen ( denmark ) are also very close to one another , but i 'm less familiar with malm\u00f6 . 
  copenhagen is a really nice city , though . 
  one last note : some of my favorite vacation stories come from places where we ( my family used to do roadtrips around europe ) just landed to sleep for a night or so . 
  i remember once driving off autobahn in germany , into a teeny tiny little village with the cutest hotel . 
  we checked in , dumped our stuff on the beds , and then just explored for a while . 
  ended up in a tiny restaurant with superb food , just soaking up the wonderful atmosphere . 
  we would never have found that place if we did n't explore a little without a plan . 
  obviously plans can be good to have at times , but i would recommend trying to leave a little leeway for the unexpected wonders to happen . 
  those , in my experience , are what you remember most . 
  i find `` w '' ( and especially `` wh '' ) to be a little weird . 
  i can say it , but it does n't really come naturally to me . 
  it 's like some sort of rolling v , and what the hell is a `` rolling v '' ? 
  same thing with `` th '' . 
  i 'm sort of naturally inclined to pronounce it as either `` f '' or `` d '' , depending on the circumstance . 
  i have to consciously not do so if i want it to sound like it should . 
  i mostly think of nollywood . 
  it 's so random , it 's wonderful . 
  i mean , hollywood and bollywood i get . 
  both india and the us are huge countries that i 'm not surprised can sustain such an industry . 
  but nigeria ? 
  i do n't know exactly how many people live there , but to me it just seems like an ordinary country with what i would assume would be a fairly ordinary amount of citizens . 
  i would n't have thought that they could sustain such a big movie industry , just like no european country ( for example ) can do so . 
  but apparently , sustain it they do . 
  i was almost about to write about the sami 's fight againt the governemtn for land rights etc , but since that 's barely even covered in sweden , i 'm not sure it 's the best example . 
  now i 'm just imagining this nationwide divide in france . 
  rioting in the streets , demonstrations , political parties on both sides of the issues debating on live tv , newspapers picking sides . 
  court rulings left and right , appeals , rogue bakeries dumping prices . 
  i usually do n't find myself in positions when i need to actually speak german , but i do run into some occasional problems when i need to read or write it . 
  die , der and das are n't too complicated on their own , but the ways in which they both change themselves and then mess up the rest of the words in every sentence they 're in can be really frustrating . 
  i also have this weird problem with remember certain function words . 
  the annoying part is that it really should n't be a problem . 
  they usually are n't inherently more difficult than their equivalents in swedish or english , but for some reason i can never learn them correctly . 
  those other languages always gets in the way , confusing me . 
  whenever one word would be used in german , there 's always another one that feels more correct to me because of how the grammar works in english or swedish . 
  i have n't been able to reach a point where i can just put aside the other languages i know and just think in german . 
  i like compound words . 
  we use them a lot in swedish as well . 
  i think that they generally show the character of the language and those who speak it . 
  it does n't matter if there are really old words that show how people thought of the world way back when , or new words that immigrants ( or maybe just the youth ) come up with that refresh the language in wondrous ways . 
  since i come from a small country with a language that is only spoken by about 10 million people , i really envy the way english is understood worldwide . 
  i imagine that 's hard to really grasp unless you 're burdened with a language no one understands . 
  whenever you write or create something , whether it 's creative or academic , you really need to do so in english if you want it to reach people . 
  especially if what you 're writing is niche . 
  i have a degree in sociology , for example , and the idea of writing something serious in swedish is ridiculous . 
  i mean , sure , you can if it 's only meant for swedes , but you ca n't be part of the international conversation unless you write it in english ( or maybe a few other languages , in academia ) . 
  while i might not exactly aspire to be the next \u00c9mile durkheim , i would like to have the option while still writing in my native language . 
  sure , i 've read and written english for about 20 years so i * can * do it , but i do n't like how everyone sort of must use the same language to express different things . 
  this is even more of a problem in creative writing , be it prose or poetry or songwriting . 
  if there 's something i 've learned from studying languages , it 's that every language has its own quirks with which you can express things unique to that language . 
  if i look at swedish , english and german , i see different beautiful things with each language . 
  to remove this beauty of individuality and have every work conform to the same language and only it 's specific quirks , i think lessens what can be said . 
  the point might still be made , but its core is still needlessly shackled in the steel of a foreign language .
