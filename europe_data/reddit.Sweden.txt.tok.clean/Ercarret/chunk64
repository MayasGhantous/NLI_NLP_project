  a consequence of this is that american stories dominate the market so much . 
  even when they are told by non-americans , they tend to be told * to * americans , which makes everything feel pretty samey . 
  i would love for other stories to be told as well , but that 's hard to do . 
  i want an epic finnish rpg or a ww2 game made and/or played from the perspective of non-americans ( valiant hearts is an amazing ww1 example of that ) . 
  i basically wish that we could all be a little more american , so that we could all be a little less american . 
  level the cultural ( and academic ) playing field a bit , in other words . 
  but what about `` merbles '' ? 
  what does that mean ? 
  i have no idea what you 're talking about ? 
   drunken tourists . 
  i so wish swedes could behave when they go abroad , but some just seem unable to do so . 
  as someone who do n't drink , it 's a little irritating to hear that we can be so annoying to the locals when we go on vacation . 
  of course we know they do n't exist , but keep it a little hush hush , wo n't ya ? 
  do n't screw up our arrangement with russia , where we just take ferries to meet in the middle of not-finland and trade vodka . 
  there 's no need for anyone to regulate that just because of sanctions and shit . 
  first i was all like , [ come at me ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/dc/b7/e2/dcb7e21fbe2f3fa7d709786e2cddb912.png ) , but i guess i 'll settle for that potato compliment . 
  meager as it may be . 
  the danes executed a lot of our noblemen and religious people in 1520 . 
  about a hundred people all in all , i think . 
  i remember the history lesson about how the blood flowed along the cobblestones to be a lot more graphic than i would 've expected , given our relatively young age . 
  thinking back on it , maybe it was a guided tour aimed at adults that we school kids just kind of tagged along on ? 
  do n't remember exactly , but that would explain some things . 
  no , that is * our * worst massacre . 
  you ca n't have it !, 
  finland . 
  we were one country until we decided to go to war with russia . 
  you do n't go to war with russia . 
  why does no one ever learn ? 
  it * never * ends well . 
  ( unless you 're the mongols . ), 
  anyhow : now we are separated and we constantly have to explain why we keep finland around as a nordic country when their history is a lot more tied to us swedes than to the rest of the nordic countries , who do n't understand a word they say . 
  but on the plus side : duty free ferries !, 
   absolutely no culinary achievements . 
  but ... !, 
  do n't forget ... !, 
  if there 's someone who 's allowed to diss us when it comes to food , it 's an italian . 
  we have our meatballs and our shrimp sandwiches , but it does n't really compare to your kitchen , does it ? 
  the whole world must look like gastronomic barbarians to you . 
  :p but say anything bad about our [ buns ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8pwl_srvp6q/tvtcl9rzkmi/aaaaaaaacbc/odarw1ocb5g/s1600/kanelbulle.jpg ) , [ semlor ] ( http://www.alltomstockholm.se/incoming/article4091691.aos/alternates/xl_wide/semlapanel.jpg ) or [ cakes ] ( http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/food/ic/food_16x9_506/recipes/prinsesstrta_17336_16x9.jpg ) and i 'll fight you . 
  ha , look at that !, 
  i know we have our birds and our flowers , but i never knew we had different songs too . 
  cool . 
  as long as it 's properly regulated , i 'm for it . 
  maybe not enthusiastically so , but at the end of the day it 's your life . 
  i do n't feel that i have the absolute power to stop you from ending it , even if i might try damn hard to convince you otherwise . 
  i do have a concern that runs parallel to this , though . 
  i feel that it gets into some murky territory due to some debates we 've had in sweden regarding abortion and `` freedom of conscience '' ( where your conscience ca n't allow you to perform the procedure ) . 
  the general consensus seems to be that that argument is pretty bullshitty when it comes to abortions : if your conscience does n't allow you to perform a specific job , get a different job . 
  it 's really only a fringe group who argues otherwise . 
  however , if you make euthanasia legal , it sort of falls into the same territory - except this time i 'm all for doctors not being forced to actively kill their patients . 
  i think that 's an absurd request to make of them . 
  it 's not something that sways me against euthanasia , but i have a hard time reconciling why doctors should be exempt from killing a person when i do n't think they should be exempt from ( from their perspective ) killing a fetus . 
  i do n't want how we deal with euthanasia to open up ways for anti-abortionists to refuse women their services , or other similar refusals . 
  if that problem can be solved , go ahead . 
  you 'd be fine . 
  we 're swedes - no one would sit close enough to you on the bus to hear you mumbling . 
  i do n't know if i 'd call it hot , but i quite like it . 
  haha , that 's cool , never knew such a thing existed . 
  interesting . 
  i 've never heard of the phenomena and do n't think any of our `` landskap '' have their own anthems . 
  although if anyone would have one , it would probably be scania . 
  or maybe every landskap except for * s\u00f6dermanland * has one , and no one 's told me . 
  in a way , that feels like a very non-stockholmer thing to do . 
  or perhaps , reversely , it would be very stockholmer-y of me . 
  people generally find foreign accents and languages hot , do they not ? 
  if i ever met a frenchman ( or any nationality ) whose own language made him purr like a kitten , it 'd come off as really weird to me . 
  the social democrats ( despite being in power ) just kind of fumble around issues without coming up with any ideas of their own , and then simply implement ideas that the opposing parties already put forth earlier . 
  i 've had a hard time seeing actual social democratic politics coming from them these past few years , and i ca n't see myself voting for them in the next election . 
  in normal circumstances this would just lead me to vote right , because that coalition did do a pretty good job from 2006 to 2014 . 
  it 's just that the opposition is made up of a lot of parties i do n't want in power , who 've all banded together . 
  the biggest party 's analysis of their loss in the last election seems to have been `` we were to nice for foreigners '' . 
  the christian democrats , meanwhile , have turned a bit more `` we need jesus '' since the loss . 
  while that 's not as bad a change as those who became `` tough on immigration '' , it 's still not my cup of tea . 
  the one party in the coalition - and maybe out of all of our parties - that i could actually vote for are the former fucking farmer 's party - and i 'm a city boy . 
  all of this is complicated by the amount of votes the sweden democrats get , who no one wants to work with due to their far right roots . 
  that 's fine by me since i do n't want them in power either , but everyone 's utter lack of ability to cooperate nearly led to a snap election right after the actual election in 2014 . 
  in 2018 the parties need to be able to work together , or else ... well , shit . 
  why did almost every single party have to either abandon their principles or turn crazy at the same time ? 
  * shakes head *, 
  hahaha !, 
  ooooh , i really liked both of them !, 
  it 's a shame that there 's so much good music that just stays within the various borders in europe ( and elsewhere , presumably ) , just because the songs are not sung in english . 
  i think compulsory voting could be really dangerous . 
  if you have 20 % who normally do n't vote because they do n't care and do n't believe in the system or its players , who suddenly have to vote anyway , they could be easy pickings for populist parties who feeds on the base instincts of people . 
  normally they 'd hopefully be kept in check by the other parties and the media if they just shout out lies and deception , but if these 20 % do n't listen to the other parties or the media then those speaking to these masses could go basically unchecked ( in the minds of these people ) . 
  2016 showed that similar stuff can happen even if you do n't have compulsory voting , but i fear that compulsory voting could worsen the situation instead of improving it . 
  i think that the best thing would be to actually draw people out voluntarily . 
  that 's hard and you 'll never going to get to 100 % of people voting no matter what , but i think that 's the right ( and only ) way to go . 
  i have a hard time picking just one , so you 'll get a few favorites of mine : [ r\u00f6dljus 2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yef5c_c7pk ) - kent . 
  i still ca n't believe how this is an alternate version of a b-side that never ended up on an album ( other than a b-side collection ) . 
  i * love * this song . 
  [ flicka med guld ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kgenx5e-nc ) - joakim th\u00e5str\u00f6m . 
  the most beautiful love song i 've ever heard , and i 've still not decided if it 's happy or sad yet . 
  [ du f\u00e5r g\u00f6ra som du vill ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jdng6y6uwi ) - patrik isaksson . 
  he can become a little repetitive since this is the only kind of music that he really does , but this is still a magical song . 
  [ under ytan ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chy8t_9m9dq ) - uno svenningsson . 
  this has been one of my favorite songs ever since i was a child . 
  it 's just so haunting . 
  i have absolutely no idea what any of you are talking about . 
  did not grow up with any similar traditions whatsoever .
