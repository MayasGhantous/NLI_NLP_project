  [ r\u00f6dljus 2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yef5c_c7pk ) - kent . 
  i still ca n't believe how this is an alternate version of a b-side that never ended up on an album ( other than a b-side collection ) . 
  i * love * this song . 
  [ flicka med guld ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kgenx5e-nc ) - joakim th\u00e5str\u00f6m . 
  the most beautiful love song i 've ever heard , and i 've still not decided if it 's happy or sad yet . 
  [ du f\u00e5r g\u00f6ra som du vill ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jdng6y6uwi ) - patrik isaksson . 
  he can become a little repetitive since this is the only kind of music that he really does , but this is still a magical song . 
  [ under ytan ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chy8t_9m9dq ) - uno svenningsson . 
  this has been one of my favorite songs ever since i was a child . 
  it 's just so haunting . 
  there are 50 areas with various levels of criminality , and in five or six of them , it 's especially bad . 
  they are n't no-go zones , but they can be a challenge for the police ( especially since the police get little more than a hot dog and a pat on the back in terms of resources to actually operate with ) . 
  hahaha . 
  let me reassure you that it 's meant more as `` i want to live my whole life in the north '' rather than some sort of viking battlecry . 
  there is ? 
  that 's cool , did n't know that . 
  yeah , he 's probably the most well-known politician we 've had , although i had n't guessed people outside of sweden still remembered him . 
  it 's a careful balance . 
  being part of a military alliance obviously has certain advantages in terms of potential support if things were to go sideways somehow , but at the same time we are sort of a neutral buffer zone between nato and russia . 
  if both finland and sweden were to join nato , nato would gain control over basically the entire baltic sea . 
  that would shift the balance of power in that region immensely , and the consequences of such shifts can be hard to predict . 
  at the very least it would heighten the tensions in that area , which is not something that needs to happen right now . 
  ... unless the tensions grow so much that it 'd be advisable to join nato out of self-preservation after all . 
  as i said , it 's a balancing act . 
  i never meant that the us is n't actually part of north america . 
  it most definitely is , just like russia is without a doubt a european country ( as well as an asian one ) . 
  what i meant was that both the us and russia seem to operate , politically , on a much higher level than as just a one part of a continent . 
  russia is n't just `` a european power '' like any other - its a global superpower . 
  the us , likewise , is politically so much more than just a north american country . 
  when i look at both of you on the global political stage i see you more as two singular forces than as `` only '' part of north america or europe/asia . 
  i hope that makes sense . 
  that 's not to say that i do n't view the us and russia as north american or european/asian in other contexts . 
  if i met you on my travels , you 'd most definitely be a north american to me . 
  * facepalms * so obvious !, 
  how could i forget him ? 
  1 ) you have * way * too many famous people . 
  share some with the rest of us . 
  2 ) ruth negga 's irish ? 
  that 's cool , did n't know that . 
  i really liked her on agents of shield , and i heard that she did really , really well in some movie that i ca n't for the life of me remember the name of now . 
  dammit . 
  3 ) dara o'briain is dope . 
  i 've loved him for years and years . 
  so incredibly funny . 
  :d 4 ) graham norton is one of my favorite talk show hosts . 
  no matter the guests , the interviews always turn hilarious . 
  i feel that it 's similar to the suggestion of alfred nobel by yosoyunpayaso above you : people certainly know about both of their legacies , but i do n't think that they themselves are all that well-known . 
  abba and ikea still tends to be the sort of go-to , stereotypical answers i see when people try to sum up sweden quickly , but i agree : if you asked someone just off the street to name someone from sweden , i think they 'd be much more likely to say zlatan than abba . 
  it depends on whether or not you prefer ice hockey or football . 
  the hockey team hears it quite often at the end of games ; the football team , not so much . 
  :p but on a more serious note : i used to know it , but since i never sing it anymore i ca n't say for sure that i would be able to sing it perfectly now . 
  it 's not especially long , it 's just that everything kind of blurs together . 
  but i 've always liked how it promotes nordic unity rather than some sort of swedish exceptionalism or anything like that , so i try to never forget it * too * much . 
  everyone seems to know about abba , even if i doubt most people could name the actual people that made up the group . 
  nowadays i 'd probably say zlatan ibrahimovic . 
  you probably have to be interested in football to know him ( at least if you 're outside of europe ) , but i struggle to come up with a bigger name . 
  they are europeans , in an absolute sense . 
  part of russia is in europe , and most russians live there . 
  no question . 
  but i also feel that they transcend their geographical location somewhat . 
  they are not a `` european player '' when it comes to world politics , but a `` world player '' . 
  much in the same way that i do n't consider the us to be a north american player . 
  both nations operate at a different level than say sweden , who will probably always be a `` european nation '' when it comes to world politics . 
  so when i do n't consider russia 's politics european , it 's not because i do n't consider them to be europeans but rather that i consider them to be much more than europeans . 
  we are all different countries and while we are very similar on the whole , we still have our own political and economical realities to deal with . 
  there is n't any reason for us to join up any more than we already do . 
  the five nordic countries cooperate in a bunch of ways , especially through the nordic council . 
  we 're almost a mini-eu as is , so there is n't really a need to develop it further . 
  the way things are right now works out great , since we get all the perks of that close cooperation while not being tied to each other in the areas where our interests diverge in important ways . 
  norway and iceland are n't part of the eu , while sweden , denmark and finland are ; norway , iceland and denmark are part of nato , while finland and sweden are n't . 
  the countries all have their reasons for staying out of the respective organisations and being forced into either because we are part of some pan-nordic/scandinavian state would n't benefit anyone . 
  except maybe eu/nato themselves . 
  i love our forests . 
  they can be magical . 
  i used to love walking in them when i was younger . 
  you can either take a gander at a general google search for [ swedish forests ] ( https://www.google.se/search?q=svensk+skog&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=590&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewif2fjb7u_rahwqf5okhqf_bswq_auibigb#q=svensk+skog&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbs=isz:l ) or look at these pictures : [ 1 ] ( http://cdnx.nwt.se/inkommande/opbgnf-2417080.jpg/alternates/free_1140/2417080.jpg ) , [ 2 ] ( http://www.skogssverige.se/sites/skogssverige.se/files/styles/large/public/images/portals/bild1273_-_skog.jpg?itok=ph-7jqvr ) , [ 3 ] ( https://hallbarahokarangen.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/skog1.jpg ) , [ 4 ] ( http://www.naturskyddsforeningen.se/sites/default/files/styles/artikelbild/public/artikelbilder/skogssluttning_986x370.jpg?itok=yywcdtgl ) , [ 5 ] ( http://naturarvet.se/wp-content/uploads/2013/05mossmatta.jpg ) , and [ 6 ] ( http://www.naturvardsverket.se/upload/var-natur/skyddad-natur/nationalparker/hamra/hamra-skog-027nf672-hog.jpg ), 
  i used to be basically cashless until my local store began refusing my card for no discernible reason . 
  i do n't have that problem anywhere else , but i need to have some cash on me if i want to be able to buy groceries . 
  annoying . 
  but i would go cashless if i could , and if it were n't for this particular store 's technical problems it certainly would n't be a problem in sweden . 
  there 's a lot of shit going on , but in the end there is only one thing that i think would be really bad : breaking up the eu . 
  i still do n't think that 's especially likely to happen , but brexit has shaken that certainty a lot . 
  now i feel that the eu is under attack on a lot of different fronts , both from within and from the outside . 
  but assuming that we do n't do anything stupid and the eu stays strong , i do n't really foresee any problems that we ca n't fix . 
  as some of the other people have said , if you 're old enough , you 've seen europe and the world deal with a lot of shit before . 
  sure , there are fires out there , but there are also plenty of flowers growing from the ashes of fires we 've already put out . 
  the problem i have is more that there are five permanent members of the council , rather than who those members are . 
  i have no problem with france and uk being there per se , but it all feels very elitist when they can not be replaced . 
  i also think that it harms the un 's credibility when the biggest nations constantly get their say and the right to veto decisions . 
  the un works best if everyone agrees that they represents the world at large and not just a few chosen nations . 
  but if you 're dealing with a nation or leader from africa , the middle east or perhaps southeast asia , and they say that the un mainly represents the interests of the superpowers ... they 're kinda right . 
  that becomes a problem if neither the government or the populace of said country respects un 's authority , because that hampers the un 's ability to act immensely . 
  and there are certainly times when we really , really need the un to be able to act . 
  but as i said , that 's more of a structural problem i have with the un rather than a problem i have with either the uk or france ( or the us , russia or china , for that matter ) . 
  i ca n't really speak for the netherlands . 
  never been there . 
  but the dutch seem like decent folks . 
  even if they do joke like that with their friends , i 'm sure they can vary their teasing to an appropriate level depending on who they 're talking with . 
  i 'll throw in sweden and norway as travel tips . 
  i 've never been to norway 's fjords , but i hear they 're amazing .
