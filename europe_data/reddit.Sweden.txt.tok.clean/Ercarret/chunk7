  it 's a weird case and probably the greatest miscarriage of justice we 've ever had . 
  he confessed to * a lot * of murders and the prosecutors just ran with it despite a lack of actual evidence linking him to them and constant inaccuracies in his testimonies . 
  i do n't know if there was something fishy with how the confessions came about ( i think he was in a mental hospital or drug rehabilitation center or something like that at the time ) , but he should n't have been convicted regardless . 
  * [ stig bergling ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stig_bergling ) : a swedish spy and policeman who sold secrets to the ussr . 
  the biggest espionage case we 've had , i think . 
  * [ hagamannen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/niklas_lindgren ) ( the man from haga ) : a serial rapist . 
  committed crimes for ten years , finally got caught , served his time and was released to public outcry , and was met with a couple of whacks to the head with a golf club from a few guys who did n't like having him in the neighborhood . 
  he survived , the men where somehow acquitted , and that 's where my knowledge of the case ends . 
  just an additional bit of weird information about that case : the current lead investigator is named krister petersson . 
  when i read that last year i was terribly confused , especially since christer pettersson has been dead for quite a while . 
  it took a while to realize that they were different people with , roughly , the same name . 
  gustav ii adolf , or gustavus adolphus as he 's known in english . 
  it 's a mix of `` it was cool to be a powerful enough nation to be important '' and `` did we * really * have to kill that many non-swedes to get there ? '' . 
  when it comes to scandinavians fighting each other i can joke around completely unreserved ( except maybe for the conquest of the sami lands ) , but for the rest i generally just feel that we are where we should be ; where we are n't anymore , we should n't have been in the first place . 
  same in sweden , which is a bit odd since they 're usually pretty talented . 
  a two hit wonder , perhaps . 
  i remember `` doctor jones '' , the single after `` barbie girls '' , very clearly . 
  it was really popular . 
  over here , anyway . 
  would you classify the olsen brother 's `` fly on the wings of love '' as a one hit wonder ? 
  i can imagine that it might seem so internationally - i do n't know them from anything else - but looking through their wikipedia page they still do seem to have had a very long and prosperous career . 
  that 's kind of the charm with this thread . 
  i similarly earned that lou bega is german . 
  had no idea . 
  i guess that it 's hard to know where people come from when they come and go so quickly . 
  but we 're rectifying that here , one one hit wonder at a time . 
  i was sure that he must have had other successful songs , because he represents that whole genre that seemed so popular at the time ... but no , not really . 
  huh . 
  reading your comment i thought to myself , `` true , but i 'm sure i 've heard worse lyrics '' . 
  [ and then i remembered this !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnmnaa8yey ), 
  he was german ? 
  i never knew . 
  loved that song , though . 
  so much nostalgia !, 
  some examples when it comes to music : meja - [ all ` bout the money . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycxmhwf4etq ) eagle-eye cherry - [ save tonight . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxnm1-gvs4 ) emilia - [ big , big world . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpks2du_qms ), 
  well , you do n't get rich by being sick and unable to work anywhere , so a move is n't really an option . 
  plus , i could n't anyway . 
  being sick and all . 
   i also really like frps what 's an frp ? 
  i 've never heard of that acronym before . 
  my favorite game of all time is easily planescape : torment . 
  such a fantastic game . 
  with the exception of the spiritual successor torment : tides of numenera , that came out recently and that i 'm playing right now , there has n't really been any rpgs like it since . 
  what i enjoy about both of them is how much of a focus there is on exploration and solving problems through other means than just skull-bashing . 
  it 's as if someone crossed an rpg with an adventure game instead of an action game , and i love it . 
  i 'll reserve judgement on tides of numenera until after i 'm done , but it does some very fundamental things right . 
  i 'm also a huge fan of the mass effect series , and most games that obsidian have made . 
  the witcher series is also a favorite . 
  the last game is just amazing . 
  stepping away from rpgs , i really enjoy the civilization series of games , and deus ex . 
  the latest of the latter , mankind divided , was n't * quite * there , but it 's predecessor human revolution was a masterpiece and the original is a classic that i return to every so often and try to finish . 
  oh , and no one lives forever is a forgotten gem , a super fun 60 's spy fps that deserves a better fate than being in this weird limbo due to no one knowing who owns the rights to it because of a series of acquisitions that confused everyone involved as rights changed hands left and right . 
  i could probably go on for days . 
  i 've been playing games obsessively for 25 years , so i have a lot of favorites . 
  i , on the other hand , live pretty far from it and have never heard the name said out loud , so i bow to your better knowledge . 
  you are all archaic !, 
  * flails wildly *, 
  i do n't want to sound like a besserwisser because i 'm really not - i just found this out when i googled * lunds lasarett * to see if it was an old hospital and if that might have been the reason for it 's name - but from what i can see , it has been renamed * sk\u00e5nes universitetssjukhus * . 
  but my point was never that the term `` lasarett '' is never in use in swedish . 
  there are a lot of hospitals with that word in their names . 
  but it does sound old-timey to me , and while i do n't have any hard data to back me up on this i have n't heard of new hospitals being called anything but * sjukhus * . 
  this is the comment thread that just keeps on giving small pieces of interesting information . 
  you ? 
  i do n't see how i would ever use * lasarett * unless i was directly referring to a hospital with that word in it 's name . 
  those are still fairly common so i still hear ( and , in that specific context , use ) the word every so often , but it definitively seem archaic to me . 
   lazar for a patient/a sick person who have to stay in the bed at home that is not a use of the word i 've ever heard in swedish , though . 
  * giggling uncontrollably *, 
  hm , interesting . 
  we do have * lasarett * , but it 's kind of an old-timey way of saying hospital ( even though a little research says that it originally had the same `` house for leper patients '' meaning that is listed in your link ) . 
  nowadays * sjukhus * ( `` sick house '' ) is the word used . 
  i 'm not sure if * lasarett * is still used in some capacity . 
  i mean , if you say `` i want to go to the * lasarett * '' someone will take you to the hospital , but i do n't think that any new hospital would be called a * lasarett * instead of a * sjukhus * . 
  but either way , i had no idea that the etymology of the word had anything to do with lazarus . 
  til . 
   maybe it 's his surname i had n't considered that , but that makes sense in a way . 
  maybe . 
  indeed . 
  do n't know , maybe not - but when you discover the name at 16 , you bet it is . 
   babin kuk - grandma 's hip hm , i wonder if the meaning of `` kuk '' is the same in montenegrin as in croatian ? 
  i 've been wondering for years . 
  in swedish it 's a rather crude way of saying penis , so me and my father where childishly amused when we saw a hearse belonging to a funeral home named `` lazarus kuk '' . 
  to us it kind of read as `` rising cock funeral home '' and we had to fight the urge to burst out laughing * so hard * , until the procession had moved past us and it was safe and non-offensive to do so . 
  there is a train station outside of stockholm called `` krigslida '' . 
  * krig * means war while * slida * is vagina . 
  we had to do some kind of school assignment where we delved into the names of places around us , and i dove right into that ( among many others ) . 
  for people willing to google translate a bit from swedish , the stockholm county museum has [ tried to answer ] ( http://old.stockholmslansmuseum.se/faktabanken/fraga-museet/kat/3/ ) where it comes from in the `` ask the museum '' section of their homepage . 
  there is no clear answer , however . 
  you probably have to search for the name to find the question/answer among all of the others . 
  ah , cool , i held a similar position , but in the army . 
  or perhaps today 's rap is n't cool anymore , if people like us do n't know about it ? 
  because while i do n't know about you , i 'm hella cool . 
  haha , not quite that bad . 
  but i did throw it a couple of meters short of the mark , which , while not exactly dangerous , still led to me and my commanding officer being showered with dirt from the explosion . 
  i did throw another grenade after that , and that went better , but i still think that i should stay away from future explosives as much as possible . 
  thanks !, 
  for the defense of v\u00e4ster\u00e5s !,
