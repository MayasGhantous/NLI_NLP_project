  it feels like the alienation of those who just want reason is fuelling the rise of the more extreme right . 
  in sweden we can see continues use of violence against the so called `` racists '' , which hold peaceful demonstrations . 
  one day the left wing might create the violent fascist that they fear , by not leaving any other peaceful means for the thinking right to express themselves . 
  example of how the swedish democrats , the main party critical to immigration ( 14 % of votes last election ) , is typically met on the streets : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ae3ppnj__9e the chant is `` no racists on our streets '' . 
  freedom of the press from the state does not mean that they will break against their own often very strict rules . 
  for example , suicides are never reported in swedish media due to the risk of inspiring others . 
  nor do they ever report the ethnicity of culprits in order to not create prejudice . 
  the media in censoring itself for a good cause . 
  the politically correct values of pro immigration and anti racism have likewise strongly effected our media . 
  there are though a few web sites that break from this , but they are therefore considered racist and anyone visiting them should do so in secret in order to not be seen as a racist . 
   how the fuck is a good investment money wise ? 
  the political consensus is that all immigration will be profitable.they used the german labour immigration of the 60s as proof for this . 
  any debate on the matter has been suppressed by labelling those of different views as racists . 
  it was considered racist to talk about the costs of immigration . 
  any research in the matter was suppressed , and the political consensus was that all immigration would be profitable . 
  all mass media were in on it too . 
  they used the german labour immigration of the 60s as proof the few times the subject was brought up at all . 
  it 's gotten better now that the effects are slightly undeniable . 
  a change is being debated . 
  but is not likely to occur since the courses are already overcrowded in the current system , to the point of lacking chairs for pupils . 
  i think the ideas most associate with capitalists are completely wrong then . 
  capitalists and economists are mostly libertarians not fascists . 
  the economist is pro migration , legalization , free speech and democracy . 
  in america they would probably be considered left leaning . 
  it 's understandably a hard rule to enforce though . 
  how are we to know how long they have been staying if we 're not allowed to register them ? 
  technically the city and its people will be located at a different position than before . 
  but if you a city as its buildings , you are correct . 
  only a few buildings are actually moved . 
  they do n't break any law in sweden when they beg . 
  even their temporary housing is not strictly illegal here if they leave when the police demands so . 
  our problem is rather that we have never had any laws against begging in any form . 
  this was viable when we only had a handful local beggars , but the thousands that have come are now occupying the streets . 
  our police have said that they 'll try to hinder the gypsy beggars from blockading too much of the sidewalks , but that 's all the law allows them . 
  i 'm very much being serious . 
  you counted them ? 
  i 'm honoured . 
  you disgust me . 
  they are greeks , are strongly allied with europe , have strong historical ties , are members of the eu and have the matching politics and policies , are greek orthodox , and much more . 
  they are definitely part of the european sphere ** according to me ** . 
  i do n't give a shit about whatever you have to say in the matter . 
  you have gone far beyond the point of having a reasonable discussion . 
   when asked to give his own subjective view , ca n't reply my subjective view is that it is european . 
  that is my subjective view . 
  am i clear enough for you about this ? 
  ** it is european according to me ** you are just angry that there is nothing you can say about it . 
  prove to me cyprus factually is not european and i 'd forgive you for past offences . 
  although , keep in mind that since it 's a fucking ** subjective question ** any and all points you could ever bring up both can and will be met with ** i do n't fucking see it that way ** . 
  now fuck off . 
   i 'll ask you again - what is `` culturally european '' ? 
  my ass hole is . 
  and no , this is not a joke . 
  i arbitrarily define my ass hole to be culturally european . 
  happy ? 
  my claim is a fucking opinion , and if applies here just as it does everywhere else , because it 's a fucking opinion . 
  you do n't share my opinion , but i could n't care less . 
  now shut up and stop badgering me . 
  there is no definition of `` culturally european '' . 
  i 've been clear with this . 
  what you want me to do is define the answer to a subjective question , which is impossible . 
  therefore i can only conclude that you are either stupid , or have malicious intent , of which the latter seem more likely . 
  you 're a very rude person . 
  k , you define it . 
  is n't this discussion going in a circle ? 
  a line must be drawn somewhere , even a subjective one . 
  it 's subjective . 
  who are you arguing with ? 
  you 're not making a coherent argument any more . 
  hehe , i usually tease some of my middle eastern friends for being asians . 
   i 've worked in baku several times and have never found sushi . 
  any time i 've eaten chinese food there it 's been terrible . 
  we did n't say east asia , did we ? 
  iran is asia . 
   azerbaijan is turkic both turkic and persian influences . 
  both of wish are not european . 
   a majority of jews in israel have mizrahi descent . 
  does not deicide culture , does it ? 
   what exactly is `` culturally european '' about cypriots that is n't about azeris ? 
  language , culture and history . 
   there goes your argument , which still is n't really based on anything . 
  this discussion goes nowhere with that attitude . 
  you can continue argue details , but it will not convince anyone but yourself . 
  there are other jews . 
  but the majority of jews in israel are european . 
  cyprus is greek , azerbaijan is persian . 
  and i do n't only mean by language . 
  they are european people . 
  greeks and jews are deeply european culturally . 
  azerbaijan is more persian . 
  germany has already taken their role though . 
  no , why on earth would you think that ? 
  they gave 0 to ukraine and 12 to their ally armenia : https://youtu.be/398c_2-t4ty?t=19m20s, 
  azerbaijan has much more in common with iran than with europe . 
   vote for australians , let them feel good and welcome !, 
  this is really close to being politics too though . 
  it is by all considered to be a border country partly located in europe , and partly in asia . 
  politically and culturally they are not very european , as you say , and therefore are commonly grouped with the asian nations . 
   they are slightly outside europe azerbaijan is inside europe though . 
  cyprus and israel are not geographically inside europe . 
  but they are culturally a hell of a lot more european than azerbaijan .
