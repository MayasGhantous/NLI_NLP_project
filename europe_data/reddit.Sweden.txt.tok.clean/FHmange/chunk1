ca n't blame them . 
  our archipelago is beautiful so it 's not weird to send submarines on vacation here . 
  they were still fairly close to enter the parliament after last months election . 
  also the green party has several leading politicians , now among those running our country , who are pretty much just as bad . 
  just look at \u00c5sa romson , our vice prime minister , she blames all the worlds problem on white middle age men who eat meat and drive suvs , and they want to completely abolish our armed forces . 
  it 's a joke in my opinion . 
  i would guess they are areas where a lot of students live . 
  surprisingly many go through some kind of communist phase during university . 
  we wipe . 
  galway is awesome . 
  best place i visited during my backpacking in ireland last year . 
  do n't worry man , you 're even more famous for all the beggars that come here !, 
  once again , denmark will smell the fires created by sweden . 
  how do i reach these keeedz, 
  [ also ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gustavus_adolphus_college ), 
  military service in sweden is entirely optional since 2011 , but i decided to sign up for three months of basic training last year . 
  best thing i 've done in my entire life , i was taught so much more than just how to kill someone , like how to survive in the forest during the swedish winter with just a knife and fire-starter . 
  i 'm considering going back to the army to work as a soldier . 
  yep . 
  you would of course never actually use this one , but it 's still a legit word . 
  once when i was backpacking with three friends our room only had two singles and one double , so me and a mate shared the double ( only one blanket so we hade to share that as well ) . 
  we went out doing some heavy drinking and when we woke up the next morning i was naked in the bed , sharing a blanket with my mate . 
  i had taken a shower when we got back the night before and then just passed out in the bed with a towel around my waist , which had come off . 
  we just laughed about it . 
  nothing weird about sharing a bed with a good friend . 
  just your ordinary baby brother complex, 
  we ( generally , ca n't speak for everyone of course ) absolutely do , but that flag has gotten a different meaning in sweden , here it 's more of a `` rebel flag '' mainly used by [ raggare ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/raggare ), 
  op said he had just googled for the images as he was inspired by the romanian album , so they 're most likely not from one single professional photographer . 
  i did my basic military training ( gmu ) at livgardet in kungs\u00e4ngen just outside stockholm . 
  we too were forced to walk past several restaurants and caf\u00e9s after * very * little food and sleep for five days , and knowing we still hade atleast three days left of that shit . 
  it was pretty sucky . 
  meh , it only neutralized the 2003 world cup quarterfinal when we turned the game from 1-5 to 6-5 , 
  [ kladdkaka ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kladdkaka ) from sweden . 
  [ it 's delicious ] ( http://static-cdn.kokaihop.se/recipe/large/1537390-1540843.jpg ), 
  my mom told me that , atleast in sweden , the night before lucia used to be a night where youths got extremely wasted . 
  for some reason that tradition died out , though . 
  i guess we have enough traditions allowing us to drink as it is . 
  so the point is that alexander the great was king over a macedonia ( macedon ) , but it 's not the same macedonia as the macedonia that exists today ? 
  sorry , i have no idea now , my world has been turned upside down . 
  i , too , thought that the modern macedonia was atleast * basically * the same as the one alexander ruled . 
  i 'll send one from stockholm if you 'd like, 
  [ this match ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7gonytzrzw ) made me want to go to ireland so bad when i saw it , so this summer me and three friends went backpacking for two weeks . 
  it was fucking amazing , and i 'm coming back for sure . 
  i hope your fans will be as awesome tonight . 
  good luck !, 
  ah , that 's good . 
  thanks !, 
  ca n't find anything about this on any of the large newspapers . 
  got any link ? 
  just get us drunk and it 's problem solved, 
  yeah [ this one ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypqm-mtkci ) . 
  i do n't listen to a lot of radio , but that 's probably the one i hear the most when i 'm in the car . 
  that 's pretty cool . 
  also , i was backpacking in ireland this summer , and holy shit the original wake me up by avicii was played everywhere all the time . 
  but then again i guess it kinda is here in sweden as well , i just do n't listen to a lot of radio here ... 
  what, 
  nothing 's impossible  i played 2004-2006 , then wow took over, 
  why , thank you . 
  i have n't mastered the english language yet so i 'm grateful for everything new i learn, 
  born and raised in sweden , started learning english in school at age 7 , and from an early age i watched movies with english audio and swedish subtitles , which i think helped a lot . 
  i guess when i realized i had `` learned '' english was when i could play runescape without any major problems , at age 11/12 ( do n't remember exactly ) . 
  i 'd say english movies with subs and gaming ( ** !, 
  ** ) has helped me * a lot * . 
  i studied german 2hrs a week for 5 years in school and i 'm not even * close * to as good in german , since i extremely rarely encounter it in every-day-life, 
  atleast it 's not horse, 
  i once met a guy on wow who went to that pilot school . 
  we became good friends, 
  in swedish , like norwegian , we have * sp\u00e4nn * which is just another word for money . 
  we also have names for 100 sek and 500 sek banknotes . 
  100 sek banknote = hunka ( the words * hundra kronor * just smashed together ) 500 sek banknote = r\u00f6ding ( basically means something like `` the red one '' , because [ it 's kinda red ] ( http://www.legendarisk.nu/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/500kr.jpg ) ) a lot of immigrant youths also started using the word `` para '' or something like that , which spread to most suburbs , and i guess it means money in some other language but i 'm not sure of it 's origins ... edit : forgot `` st\u00e5lar '' which is like `` sp\u00e4nn '' . 
  i 'm from stockholm btw , ca n't speak for the rest of the country, 
  yeah i 'm sure this is n't representetive of people below 40 . 
  honestly i can only think of like 2 fat people i know below the age of 35 . 
  great tip thx, 
  compared to other countries in europe and around the globe , yes , sd are pretty damn normal . 
  just not after swedish leftists weird-ass standards . 
  you know what 's creepy ? 
  that we 're basically importing conflicts to our country and slowly destroying our welfare with an extremely failed immigration that we * by no means can handle * , but you 're still considered a fascist or racist for voting for the single party that wants to decrease it . 
  and even though that party is rising like a rocket , the other parties * refuse * to acknowledge them , their voters , or the question at hand . 
  that 's what 's fucking creepy . 
  they were mostly russian and some ukrainian . 
  i 'm certain of this . 
  haha that 's true . 
  my worst memory from this trip was during the new years eve celebration at the hotel . 
  they placed all the food on a long table , like a buffet , and everyone start getting in an orderly line ... then the russians just started forcing their way to the food , completely ignoring the line . 
  what they did was placing one member of their company at the food table , and then the rest just started handing him their plates and he just stood there filling them all up while everyone else patiently waited in the line . 
  it was a disgrace . 
  and they wonder why people do n't like them . 
  the russian tourists i encountered in egypt were , by far , the worse i 've ever seen . 
  i 've traveled a lot and never have i seen such rudeness in tourists as i saw in the russians . 
  it made me never want to visit egypt again just because i knew it was a popular destination for russians . 
  ( i guess right now it 's not a very popular destination for anyone ) they were extremely rude to * everyone * . 
  staff , other guests at the hotel , people in the street , vendors etc etc. 
  they literally acted like they owned the place and would cuss out anyone who displeased them in any minor way . 
  what, 
  piketen is a task force within the swedish police , that is correct . 
  but they are not swat . 
  * nationella insatsstyrkan * ( national task force ) is the swedish swat . 
  `` if i ca n't have it , no one will ! '', 
  if he actually did lie about it , my guess is that he 's either far-right and wanted people to be scared and think isis is operating in sweden and is starting to attack our citizens ( he claims they yelled about being isis ) .
