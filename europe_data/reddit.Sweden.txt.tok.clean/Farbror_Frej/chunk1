or ` nja ' in swedish, 
  it 's a court decision , not a legislative ban . 
  we have a law requiring permits to use surveillance cameras . 
  the court found cameras placed on drones to fall under that category , and therefore requires such a permit to operate . 
  that has nothing to with this . 
  we have , and have had for a long time , a law requiring permits to utilize surveillance cameras . 
  the court deemed cameras placed on drones to fall under that category , and as such requires a permit to use . 
  it does not , but if you look at [ press freedom index ] ( https://rsf.org/en/ranking ) or other measurements you 'll find that all of the nordics generally do score pretty well . 
  that said , this poll 's about support for freedom of expression , not freedom of expression itself . 
  also , we 're not socialist . 
  here 's a bunch of different sources from different countries : [ . dk ] ( http://www.ef-danmark.dk/epi/ ) [ . nl ] ( http://www.ef.nl/epi/ ) [ . co.uk ] ( http://www.ef.co.uk/epi/ ) [.edu ] ( http://www.ef.edu/epi/ ) [.com . au ] ( http://www.ef-australia.com.au/epi/ ) [ . co.nz ] ( http://www.ef.co.nz/epi/ ) must be conclusive since they all found the same result . 
  the government . 
  here in sweden you get about 300 $ / month in support for free , and can loan another 600 $ / month with very low interest from the state . 
  many try to get a part time gig for weekends etc. 
  for some extra cash , but you do n't really need to if you live frugally enough . 
  not sweden . 
  we hop around a giant penis pretending to be frogs . 
  walpurgis is for burning . 
  according to our own [ national statistics agency ] ( http://www.statistikdatabasen.scb.se/pxweb/en/ssd/start__be__be0101__be0101a/befolkningny/ ) the counties of stockholm , uppsala , gotland , and scania should for 2016 . 
  do n't know where eurostat got its data . 
  but our counties are pretty large , if you divide by municipalities you 'll find nine of the ten most populous cities . 
  as elsewhere , [ our larger cities ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gbfykbt.png ) are where you 'll find more women than men . 
   there 's no real university down there blekinge institute of technology is certainly real . 
  it 's on the smaller scale with 7000-8000 students , but it usually ranks highly for sustainable development and applied it . 
  it is specialized in fields that are dominated by men , so it 's not helping the numbers . 
  the 's ' is already in the ` x ' , or at least that 's the logic . 
  it does n't follow standard swedish orthography , but y' know , it looks cooler ... !, 
  and you do n't have to get out blekinge for it . 
  bth 's a good , specialized university and there are pretty good amounts of job opportunities in the field . 
  but that is a field dominated by men , dragging the numbers up further . 
  there is also significantly more going on there during summer when all the summer house people and tourists come . 
  blekinge can be fairly seasonal . 
  it 's a rumor that there 's an old law permitting danes to hit swedes with a stick if they ever walk across the ice . 
  it 's just an urban legend without any proof of ever existing . 
  it relates to when [ swedes actually did walk across the ice ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/march_across_the_belts ) , which [ did n't end too well for denmark ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_roskilde ) . 
  now all european or partially european countries ( that alexa tracks ) should be there , at least i hope so . 
  done !, 
  for future reference , gr is greece . 
  since i do n't have a life : country | alexa rank -- | -- denmark | 7 sweden | 8 ireland | 9 norway | 9 iceland | 9 finland | 10 * gibraltar * | 11 belgium | 12 netherlands | 12 united kingdom | 12 portugal | 15 switzerland | 18 austria | 19 slovenia | 20 romania | 22 croatia | 23 germany | 24 malta | 30 luxembourg | 32 poland | 32 bosnia and herzegovina | 32 lithuania | 37 bulgaria | 40 cyprus | 40 serbia | 40 montenegro | 41 estonia | 44 france | 46 slovakia | 46 hungary | 47 latvia | 48 czech republic | 50 spain | 68 italy | 70 albania | 91 greece | 93 republic of macedonia | 95 turkey | 150 georgia | 161 russia | 220 belarus | 241 andorra | 255 azerbaijan | 260 moldova | 295 ukraine | 309 kazakhstan | 345 armenia | not in top 500 edit : figured i 'd add some non-eu countries as well , as there 's no need to always exclude them . 
  edit 2 : changed to full names edit 3 : i 've gone through all european nations ( and territory ) alexa keeps ranks of ^ ( ( i hope ... ) ^ ) . 
  so that should be all . 
  yeah , we do get some of that mix-up in spain , for the very reason you stated . 
  there 's also a lot of * hilarious * people telling us to stop playing dumb ( hacerse el sueco ) . 
  source : am swedish . 
  used to live in spain . 
  yeah , i know and correctly so . 
  specifying it in this case would be pedantic . 
  what i 'm saying is that the drawing is probably based on the english ` sandwich ' and not our ` macka ' . 
  that 's why it looks like that in the image . 
  ` sandwich ' refers to two slices of bread with stuff in between . 
  translating it to specify ` open sandwich ' is kind of unnecessary methinks . 
  the point 's still there , is n't it ? 
  nope , and neither is the bible . 
  matthew 23:24 :  you blind guides !, 
  you strain out a gnat but swallow a camel . 
  do n't know how norway got that meaning . 
  in sweden ` swallowing camels ' refers to fixating on unnecessary things and ignoring the real issues . 
  it 's not as dark blue as it used to be , no , that changed in 1906 . 
  but it is supposed to be on the blue side of the spectrum , not that close to cyan . 
  that 's the average of the blues in the image on the left and the officially designated ncs 4055-r95b on the right ( to be precise it 's a digital representation , # 006aa7 ) . 
  it can also be noted that the left side is slightly darkened due to shadows while the right side one `` clean '' , meaning the right appears comparatively brighter . 
  ** tl ; dr : ** the blue is indeed off . 
  * farbror frej * was a character parodying a popular children 's crafts show in the '90s . 
  [ here 's a video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1f5m4yzbc4u ) , but it wo n't make much sense if you do n't understand swedish . 
  as for why i picked it ... who knows ? 
  that melody does sometimes get stuck in my head , maybe it was when i created the account . 
  my hometown hockey team does have an american style name : *** v\u00e4xj\u00f6 lakers *** . 
  they could n't name themselves by the otherwise typical system as * v\u00e4xj\u00f6 hc * was the bankrupt hockey club they replaced . 
  so they named themselves after the lakes that are synonymous with the area ( essentially like minneapolis lakers ) . 
  the floorball club does too : *** v\u00e4xj\u00f6 vipers *** . 
  they used to be * v\u00e4xj\u00f6 innebandyklubb * ( `` v\u00e4xj\u00f6 floorball club '' ) but i think they renamed themselves to `` vipers '' for marketing purposes . 
  while we do have some common european adders slithering about in the woods , i do n't think we 're particularly known for vipers . 
  it just sounded `` cool '' . 
  our main football club is called * \u00d6sters if * , * \u00d6ster * for short . 
  \u00d6ster ( literally `` east '' ) is the name of the part of town they 're from ( funnily enough they now play in another part of town : v\u00e4ster ( `` west '' ) ... ) . 
  no clue what kind of `` american-stye '' name they 'd have . 
  they do n't have a nickname , logo or anything really to play on . 
  their supporter club is called * east front * . 
  most iconic is the [ cathedral ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ydjtqpl.jpg ) , but i do n't know about breathtaking . 
  the ugliest ? 
  any of the soviet-style concrete boxes . 
  i read about it for school back when i lived in spain . 
  it was in my teachers literature over spanish etymology and idioms . 
  i do n't remember the titles and i do n't have any means of contacting her , so no , unfortunately i ca n't name anything . 
  it was serious literature with all historical examples were referenced , so * i * know it was truthful . 
  but that does n't help you of course . 
  sorry i ca n't be of better help . 
  is [ this ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/5bh60c/how_is_your_educational_system_organized/ ) what you want to know ? 
  how the actual systems are laid out ? 
  if so i 'll just copy-paste my reply :  * primary school , `` grundskola '' . 
  year ( 0 ) ,1 -9 . 
  `` year 0 '' is optional , but most people do it to my knowledge . 
  1-9 are mandatory . 
  some schools do all years , another common split is to have different schools for 0-6 and 7-9 . 
  * upper secondary school , `` gymnasium '' . 
  optional , but virtually everyone does it . 
  three years , called 1-3 . 
  this is also secondary education , but only available for 18 + year olds . 
  it 's an alternative , or addition , to the gymnasium . 
  puts you into a different university application quotient , which can help .
