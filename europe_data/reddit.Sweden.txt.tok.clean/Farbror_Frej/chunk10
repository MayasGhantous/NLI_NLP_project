  i tried to explain my way of thinking , but i 'm not a succinct individual so it became pretty drawn out and i 'm still not sure i got my point across . 
  anyway , if you 're interested ... -- no , it 's not very different in swedish , it 's mostly the same . 
  we capitalize proper nouns , and beginnings of a sentences as well . 
  we do n't capitalize derivatives in the same way and there are some differences in what constitutes a proper noun ( e.g. 
  we do n't capitalize languages , nationalities , week days , months etc. 
  ) , but otherwise it 's pretty similar . 
  what 's different about english is that it 's not always as consistent . 
  the rules themselves are fine on paper . 
  but the exceptions , the reason you had to write `` it 's * pretty much * just the [ ... ] '' , that 's what i find inconsistent . 
  even though it 's pretty foreign to me to capitalize as many nouns as you do in german , i can understand it , because it 's consistent . 
  english is less so to me . 
  it 's not that i find english capitalization super difficult , i just find to be lacking in consistency , like a lot of other little idiosyncrasies of the english language . 
  what i find most inconsistent in english capitalization , are related to the derivatives . 
  adjectives derived from proper nouns should be capitalized . 
  ` freudian ' should be capitalized as it 's derived from the proper noun ` freud ' . 
  but then you have adjectives like ` quixotic ' , or nouns like ` malapropism ' . 
  they are n't capitalized despite being derived from don quixote , and mrs. malaprop respectively . 
  also , when you add a prefix it 's * usually * the same as it is with ` pre-columbian ' . 
  columbian ( being derived from columbus ) is capitalized , the ` pre - ' is n't ( unless it starts a sentence of course ) . 
  but that 's not true for some words . 
  say you 're researching philosophy you 'll encounter presocratic , presocratic , pre-socratic , and pre-socratic , because they 're all acceptable spellings . 
  and as i said before , we do n't capitalize week days and months in swedish . 
  which may be why i do n't understand why you capitalize those in english , but not for example seasons ? 
  because to me they 're also just a division of the year , but they are n't capitalized . 
  is it because they 're not derivatives from proper nouns ? 
  because if that 's the case then neither are september , october , november , and december . 
  they 're derived from numbers , not emperors/gods like the other months/week days . 
  ** tl ; dr : ** the rules are not very different from swedish , but in practice i find it a bit inconsistent . 
  but that may just be me . 
  hm , interesting . 
  is there a known reason why the feminine is used ? 
  or is it just the mystery of language ? 
  really ? 
  what is it in pt ? 
  in spanish it 's the same as usual . 
  abuelos / - as . 
  like normal , the masculine is used for everything except for when referring to exclusively females . 
  i know why , but i do n't think it 's fair to blame the lexicographers . 
  many lexicographers through the years have pushed for a spelling reform , honestly it 's probably the group of people that have tried it the most . 
  it 's the general populace that 's given little support for change . 
  but while the lack of a spelling reform is the main reason , there are also others adding to the inconsistencies . 
  for example : many words got a french influenced spelling around the renaissance , really only because that language was trendy . 
  that 's why ` island ' has an 's ' for example , it did n't have one in old - and middle english . 
  counting in danish is kind of quirky and unique . 
  first off , they do like german/dutch/etc . 
  and put the units before the tens . 
  so 21 is ` one-and-twenty ' , not ` twenty-one ' . 
  which is a bit strange imo , but whatever , it 's fine . 
  so , then you count along just fine to 49 . 
  but then , you reach 50 , and enter the 50-99 range . 
  so ... 60 is ` tres ' in danish , which is shortened from ` tresindstyvende ' meaning ` three times twenty ' . 
  easy enough . 
  then they removed the ` times twenty ' - part and you 're left with something that sounds like three with an added 's ' ( three is ` tre ' , sixty is ` tres ' . 
  see the similarity ? ) . 
  which means 63 is ` treogtres ' , ` three and three-s ' essentially . 
  and did you think that was complicated enough ? 
  nooo . 
  so , you obviously ca n't multiply 20 evenly and get 50,70 , and 90 . 
  so what do they do ? 
  add ten like in french ? 
  nope , they multiply with halves . 
  only instead of saying ` four-point-five-times-twenty ' or ` four-and-a-half-times-twenty ' , they say ` half five times twenty ' . 
  because ( 1/2 subtracted from 5 ) * 20 is such a normal way to say ninety . 
  or , you know , the ` times twenty ' - part is obviously removed , so you 're left ` half-five-s ' . 
  which means that instead of saying ` ninety-five ' like a sane individual they 're saying ` five and half five-s ' . 
  but wait , there 's more . 
  because ... guess what ? 
  on cheques and such they write ` nitifem ' as in : ` ninety-five ' ... why not just use that everywhere danes ? 
  why ? 
  oh , and another thing . 
  when it comes to ordinal numbers they do n't remove the ` times twenty ' - part , because consistency 's overrated y' know . 
  so where you in english would have ` ninety-fourth ' you in danish have : * fireoghalvfemsindstyvende * . 
  ** tl ; dr : ** ninety-five is essentially ` five and half five-s ' in danish . 
  ^ ^ edit : ^ ^ typo, 
  there 's too much quirkiness in english . 
  it 's essentially the bastard creole of germanic languages and seems to be built around inconsistencies . 
  the spelling 's a complete mess . 
  you ( usually ) ca n't negate a verb without first adding another useless verb . 
  compounding 's inconsistent . 
  likewise is the capitalization . 
  i do n't know if anythings untranslatable to swedish . 
  if there is we just tend to use the english word . 
  the swedish language council will recognize it soon enough . 
  i mean , i 'm quite fond of it , but english is just ... weird . 
  when you say `` foreign language '' , do you mean foreign to me or foreign to you ? 
  english is a foreign language to me . 
  wait , what ? 
  you do the lord 's prayer in school ? 
  is that common ? 
  ok , sure . 
  `` a close to 80 year old grenade [ ... ] since the mid 30 's '' . 
  i only mentioned wwi , and i did specifically say a lot . 
  unless there have been major changes back and forth , there is a significant part of the nationwide curriculum allocated to it in gymnasiet . 
  so it should be taught , and if a class is n't studying it , the teacher 's not doing their job properly . 
  the fact that it 's seen as a boring obstacle may however be true . 
  but it is a boring obstacle you have to pass , and therefore learn to some extent . 
  personally i loved learning about wwi , as it was keeping us from wwii . 
  not that wwii is uninteresting or anything , but it takes up such a massive part . 
  almost too much . 
  i wish we had some more vikings and stuff .
