  or maybe ancient history . 
  just though i 'd join and say that we do not find a lot of wwi ammo here !, 
  not in the north , west , east , or even south . 
  we also do n't find a lot of dead people from that time . 
  it is mostly seen as a pointless war however . 
  of course , that is why . 
  i 'm just saying that even if you had n't gotten dragged in , every high schooler would still have the pressure on them . 
  as in thinking about it on a daily basis ? 
  sure . 
  but it 's not like people have completely forgotten about it , and are oblivious towards it . 
  i do n't believe that for a second . 
  we do learn about it extensively school . 
  possibly not as extensively as wwii , but there 's still a lot . 
  when i went to school , history class spent much * much * more time with wwi than the days of the swedish empire . 
  you do n't have to get dragged into a war to have to learn about it in school . 
  i mean we did n't really get properly dragged in , and yet the two world wars are the most significant topics in history class . 
  or at least they were when i went to school . 
  depends very much on where in the country you are . 
  trams exist in stockholm , gothenburg , and norrk\u00f6ping . 
  personally , i 've never had a bad experience with them . 
  but i also do n't live in either of those cities , so i do n't now . 
  maybe i 've been lucky . 
  i 've never had any issues with that one either , it 's always been good and on time whenever i 've used it . 
  but again , i do n't live there . 
  trains and buses exists all over the place . 
  where i live buses are fine . 
  not great , not horrible . 
  they have a good coverage , and are usually not too late . 
  the most annoying part about them is that you ca n't pay with cash nor credit/debit card . 
  you have to either pre-purchase an mobile ticket before boarding or have a prepaid travel card . 
  which is annoying if you do n't travel much . 
  with trains it depends , they can be a bit of a hit and miss . 
  they 're unreliable every single winter for whatever reason . 
  when the first millimeter snow falls , the train companies are always `` shocked '' . 
  we get snow every winter , there 's absolutely nothing unexpected about that ... 
  i do n't know if it 's the trains , the rails , or some other infrastructure that 's lacking , but during winter , they are not to be trusted . 
  and you 're better of by other means of transport . 
  also they are quite expensive . 
  ah , spoken like a true swede . 
   in spanish , the masculine version of words is used when relating to both or unknown genders . 
  as such , the word for ` child ' is the same as for ` son ' , sibling = brother , parent = father , etc. 
  to answer your question , it does . 
  the leg\u00edtima goes to any descendants , biological or adopted , male or female . 
  ^ ^ edit : ^ ^ phrasing, 
  in some dialects , it is . 
  that 's what i meant by ` kv\u00e4llsmat ' being `` the sandwich or such '' ( essentially high tea * ish * ) in some dialects . 
  but to me , ` middag ' is exclusively used for banquets , feasts , and other festive meals . 
  not an everyday dinner . 
  ` kv\u00e4llsmat ' is the cooked meal eaten in the late afternoon , and is typically the largest meal of the day . 
  which i 'd translate to dinner , it 's more significant than high tea . 
  but that 's in my dialect , in others that 's not the case . 
  to me that 's the cooked meal eaten in the late afternoon/evening . 
  i eat dinner at around midnight . 
  and , yes , it 's the last meal . 
  but that is * quite * late by swedish standards . 
  most people eat dinner around six i think . 
  a night sandwich or something before going to bed is n't uncommon . 
  same as norway really . 
  terminology differ with dialects and such . 
  to me `` middag '' is a fancy dinner ( for gatherings , festivities , and such ; banquets/feasts etc. ) . 
  an ` everyday dinner ' is `` kv\u00e4llsmat '' ( literally ` evening food ' ) . 
  but in some dialects a ` middag ' is any type of dinner , fancy or not , and ` kv\u00e4llsmat ' may be a late snack with a sandwich or such . 
  also , in some dialects ` middag ' means lunch . 
  ^ ( ^ edit : ^ more ^ coherent ^ wording ), 
   but the difference is that their islands are rather large , while sweden has two major islands and the rest are rather small . 
  i thought so too , but looking into it the drop in size is rather quick there too . 
  ignoring ` gb ' and ` ireland ' ( the islands , not countries ) , [ that 's really only true for number 4 to 20 , and from number 35 and beyond ours are larger . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/oxib36v.png )  only 3 % for us , although our island territory is larger proportionally . 
  yeah , the reason our number is that big is really only because large parts of stockholm , as well as hisingen in gothenburg , are islands . 
  which of course drags the numbers up a bit . 
  huh , interesting . 
  that is fewer than i 'd imagined . 
  the vast majority of ours are n't inhabited either . 
  according to the latest survey ( 2013 ) , we have 8093 islands with buildings . 
  about 7000 of those have residences specifically , only 984 of which are permanently inhabited ( island holiday homes are quite popular ) . 
  and 17 % of our population lives on islands , guess we ca n't beat you on that one . 
  we have 267 ' 570 islands total in sweden . 
  visting anywhere close to all is impossible . 
  but i 've been to far too many to count . 
  i grew up with a summer place in an archipelago and a boat . 
  island jumping was standard every summer . 
  abroad , i 've been to islands in ~ 15 countries . 
  highest number out of those is probably the us with maybe 50 or so . 
  are there really only just over 6000 islands total in the uk ? 
  that sounds few to me , i imagined much more . 
  i mean , we have 267 ' 570 islands total . 
  now , i know that we have quite a lot , and that that number includes every island blob down to 9 m ^ 2 , but still . 
   so in j\u00e4mtland we 're neanderthals i 'm pretty sure it 's `` norwegian '' , and yes , i 'm pretty sure you are . 
  ^ ^ i ^ ^ jest , ^ ^ i ^ ^ jest but seriously , no . 
  i did n't say that . 
  i only mentioned \u00d6vik as h\u00f6ga kusten is the de facto capital of surstr\u00f6mming , adding some pseudo-credibility . 
  is drowning the can some kind of j\u00e4mtland custom ? 
  i know people from there who do n't . 
  songs in english outnumber all other languages combined ( including swedish ) by a lot . 
  the vast majority of swedish music produced nowadays is in english too . 
  second to english is swedish , by it 's not very much of that . 
  other languages are rarer , but on occasion something pops up . 
  and there are of course people with individual preferences . 
  yeah , but you acclimatize pretty quickly . 
  and when you do , it 's feels so cold ...
