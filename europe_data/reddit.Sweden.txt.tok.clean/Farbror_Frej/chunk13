  there 's no word for it . 
  you 'll have to be content with ` great britain ' even if that is technically only the island with scotland , england and wales , where northern ireland is n't included . 
  the same is true for quite a few languages if i 'm not mistaken . 
  or , well , i suppose you could bring out the whole shebang : ` united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland ' . 
  but that does just not happen , ever . 
  frida hansdotter is n't that famous here . 
  andr\u00e9 myhrer more so , but nowhere near the top . 
  anja p\u00e4rson , on the other hand , i 'd say definitely . 
  i think you forgot about the ladies . 
  some of them are very recognizable . 
  it feels like we miss out on their `` amazingness '' by speaking swedish . 
  they 're just normal words to us ... and some are just weird . 
  like they have this [ `` rocking-moose '' ] ( http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/products/childrens-ikea-products/baby/baby-toys/ekorre-rocking-moose-red-rubberwood-art-50060713/ ) called `` ekorre '' . 
  ` ekorre ' is swedish for squirrel ... and they have a series of stoneware named f\u00e4rgrik ( colorful ) . 
  the two most popular colors of it ? 
  you guessed it , white and black ... 
  yeah , that 's what i figured with schengen and euro and all . 
  maybe not as easy for people in the south/east whose closest ikea is in zagreb though . 
  by language barrier i 'm just gon na take it as if you 're talking about the glorious swedish product names . 
  there ai n't no getting rid of that one !, 
   the ones abroad are n't that far , as long as you 're not buying anything huge . 
  judging solely from google maps , it really does n't seem to be * a whole lot * further for you guys than it is for me to mine ( about an hour drive ) . 
  it 's just sweden going strong for that cultural victory . 
  nothing to worry about . 
  ah , ok . good to see we 're going strong on that cultural victory . 
  every country deserves our delicious meatballs with lingonberries and affordable furniture !, 
   this power of ikea where else would you go for your regular dose of swedish ? 
  then there 's meatballs with lingonberries , affordable furniture , and cute little `` apartments '' , [ what 's not to love ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iupu_ipbvb0 ), 
  yeah , i figured that 'd be the case . 
    in slovenia * ( yet ) * are there plans on opening one ? 
  come on now , 8,5 million is n't '' * that * few '' ... not everyone can be top 20 in the world population wise , ms. german ...  that said , i thought they had a slightly larger population than us . 
  apparently they do n't . 
   tehe place where you hide your money and * buy swedish furniture * . 
  i 've been doing it wrong my entire life , i 've only ever bought those things here . 
  there are n't many nudists or naturists who like to walk around naked . 
  most people prefer clothes at pretty much all times . 
  but we 're not afraid to sit naked in a sauna or such , and we do n't freakout over the sight of naked bodies . 
  yeah i know . 
  i checked wikipedia for an article , but alas , no english . 
  it truly is the bastard of germanic languages . 
  the language is a pretty big one . 
  every year we get a bunch new load words and expressions from english ( mostly from the us ) , and `` s\u00e4rskrivning '' is rampant . 
  that 's when you write compounds as separate , similar to how blackboard \u2260 black board or highlight \u2260 high light . 
  in swedish compounds are important , and 's \u00e4rskrivning ' can often change the entire meaning of a sentence . 
  english , on the other hand , has very few real compounds and the standard is the write words separately . 
  that practice is being imported here , even though it does n't function well in our language . 
  not really . 
  there are some medieval and viking things though . 
  medieval week on gotland is pretty big every summer . 
  [ here list of notable european fairs . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_renaissance_fairs#europe ), 
  i know , it was more of a `` fun fact '' . 
  few anthems celebrate other countries . 
  well , you guys who celebrate all of them , do n't you ... ? 
  sabaton 's pretty good if you like power metal , even if i 'm not the biggest fan of their latest stuff . 
  and almost all of their songs have pretty interesting lyrics about historical events . 
  i just wish they 'd write some more in swedish . 
   ( apart from your anthem ) our anthem 's about neither the country nor people . 
  it 's about all of the nordics . 
  ( we were in a union with norway and scandinavism was at an all-time high at the time of writing , that 's why ) sabaton has an [ album ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo3cd1rjsz4&amp;index=3&amp;list=plhicnhry-xtuwl41if5ivrl8b8d7vy_jp ) about some of the history of the swedish empire . 
  each song has been translated to english , so i do n't think translation is necessary ( i do think the swedish lyrics are better though ) . 
  the themes for each song can be seen on [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carolus_rex_\\ ( album \\ ) #track _ listing ) . 
  it does have the option . 
  but it has been discontinued , so it is n't that common anymore . 
  it 's been replaced by the official reddit app . 
  settings  comments  show author flair , 
  most people here walk . 
  there 's no law against it . 
  too many cross even if there are cars coming , just assuming they 'll stop . 
  i do think many people may be more careful in countries where you drive on the other side of the road though , so they do n't forget which direction the cars are coming from . 
  personally , i always wait . 
  i see no reason not to wait another five seconds . 
  why the rush ? 
  [ arbetsf\u00f6rmedlingen ] ( http://www.arbetsformedlingen.se/ ) 's ( the swedish public employment service ) own website 's the largest by far . 
  the [ assassination of olof palme ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/assassination_of_olof_palme#murder_theories ) is probably the most theorized event . 
  both kgb and cia , and everything in between , have been blamed for that one . 
  that wikipedia page has only a fraction of the theories . 
  it 's like `` our jfk '' . 
  possibly , depends where you live i suppose . 
  and if you live in an apartment in the city , it 's also difficult to eat . 
  it 's not something you want to open indoors . 
  * ever * . 
  but it tastes alright . 
  it 's pretty salty , a lot of popular swedish foodstuff is : salty licorice , kalles kaviar etc. 
  that 's amazing progress for a month . 
  only thing missing there is a tiny little `` f\u00f6r '' :  n\u00e4r jag b\u00f6rjade * f\u00f6r * en m\u00e5nad sedan otherwise there 's nothing you need to change . 
  personally i 'd rearrange the first part to ` jag talar mycket b\u00e4ttre svenska nu [ ... ] ' . 
  but i 'm not sure why nor what rules apply for that . 
  yours is 100 % accepted . 
   --  the rest i think i was something about snus not being that good for me , but ok if i do n't want to smoke in the cold right ? 
  pretty much . 
  i just wanted to give you a challenge . 
   essentially it 's : do n't start using snus , it 's addictive and unhealthy . 
  unless your already a smoker , then you might as well so do n't have to go outside for a nicotine fix . 
  --  either way i dread more my eventual test against a certain fermented delicacy ... surstr\u00f6mming ? 
  it 's really not very widespread , mostly centered around [ h\u00f6ga kusten ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/high_coast ) . 
  i mean , you can buy it everywhere , but the majority of swedes do n't eat it . 
  i quite like it though . 
  just remember it tastes better than it smells , and do n't let anyone trick you into eating it as it is .
