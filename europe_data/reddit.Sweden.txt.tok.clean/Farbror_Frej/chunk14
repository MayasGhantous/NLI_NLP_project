  it 's meant to be a dish served with some bread , potatoes , onion etc. 
  not a youtube challenge . 
  doubt it 's me . 
  about 200 km to denmark . 
   do you cross the border regularly ? 
  every time i fly i do . 
  cph is the best easily accessible airport from here . 
  the train goes straight there and stops right underneath the airport . 
  no annoying flight busses , taxis or such required . 
  i do n't understand why so few airports seem to be connected to the rail network , it 's so practical . 
  well , that 's an admirable initiative !, 
   ^ ( i do n't know what level of swedish you 're on , but best of luck to you ! ), 
  ( also , when you get here , tell people you 're making an effort to learn the language and try to stay away from english even just for a single word you do n't know in swedish . 
  otherwise it 's very easy to fall into the perpetual english-speaking trap . ), 
   take a wild guess ... wild guess ? 
  okay ... you traveled to the future where it 's mysteriously become the lingua franca and decided to get a head start ? 
  or maybe you have/are planning to move to sweden ? 
   which is ? 
  a mess ... 
  it 's not a pure dialect . 
  it 's a mixture of south-swedish dialects . 
  mostly south-central sm\u00e5landian , but with a fair share blekinge and northern scanian . 
  i do n't know if it 's standard for us to not differentiate there , but i personally do n't . 
  wait , is it ? 
  i know we have long/short vowels , i guess i did n't think of that as changing the sound as all our vowels have them and there are set rules . 
  depends on the dialect , but it 's typically an [ \\ [ \u00f8\u032b\u02d0 \\ ] ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/close-mid_front_rounded_vowel#close-mid_front_protruded_vowel ) when stressed and [ \\ [ \u0153\u032b \\ ] ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/open-mid_front_rounded_vowel#open-mid_front_protruded_vowel ) when unstressed . 
  but , you 're right , stressed while preceding an ` r ' seems more like a [ \\ [ \u0276\u02d0 \\ ] ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/open_front_rounded_vowel ) in rikssvenska . 
  my dialect does n't really differentiate between them , i guess that 's why i did n't think of it . 
  why are you learning swedish , if i may ask ? 
  i may be misinterpreting , but what do you mean by `` we just never ever change its pronunciation , ever '' ? 
  the swedish \u00d6 does n't change pronunciation either ... ? 
  that 's interesting about the keyboards . 
  it makes sense , but it never occurred to me that using foreign language keyboards would be standard in some places . 
  [ we are ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_number_of_internet_users#list ) ( sort by percentage ) to add to that , the swedish language internet culture is n't really as well developed as some languages , so we usually end up browsing the anglophone web since we all speak that . 
  also , we also have a relatively high percentage of `` power users '' ( or what ever you want to call it ) , as we have a lot of leisure time and little else to do . 
   and moose , they also left . 
  i seem to remember at least one swam over . 
  he was promptly hit by a train . 
  poor guy . 
  : / also , i think a few were supposed to be reintroduced in northern jutland a year or two ago . 
  do n't know what happened with that though . 
  most people call it moose since that eliminates any ambiguity with the wapiti . 
  also it 's a funnier and more exotic word ( our \u00e4lg is similar to elk ; hyperforeignism in play ) . 
  another example of trying to eliminate ambiguity is with those two foot related sports , most people here call them `` soccer '' and `` american football '' respectively , neither is `` football '' . 
   edit : also , arent flairs customizable on this sub ? 
  mine appears to be i ca n't , neither with the css turned on nor off . 
  i 've tried . 
  but you obviously can , your flair says `` promanian/proldolvan '' . 
  how ... ? 
  it 's from an exhibition celebrating homosexuality in the armed forces . 
  that 'll work i suppose . 
  the flairs on here already have issues : - iraq has an almost ten year outdated flag . 
  - the flair called `` saudi arabia '' is the flag of the arab league . 
  - there 's a flair showing the flag of guinea , but called new guinea . 
  - andorra and macedonia do n't have flairs etc. 
  i feel like many would like what you 're proposing , or at least the ability to change flair text . 
  there have been threads requesting this before , but i have n't heard any response from the mod team . 
  you sure ? 
  i 've never seen such a thing , and most languages seem to have ` wikipedia ' . 
  in fact standardizing it would make more sense as it eliminates uncertainty between ` wikipedia.org ' and ` vickipedia.org ' etc. 
  also , not relevant , but the foundation is called wikimedia not wikipedia . 
  swedish wikipedia is * wikipedia * , because it 's a name . 
  correct orthographical spelling of how we pronounce it would otherwise be ` vickipedia ' . 
  ( we do not have the english ` w ' - sound , only v ), 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.vasamuseet.se/en ) their website . 
  it has information about the exhibitions , history , preservation work etc. 
  if you like 17th-century stuff i can recommend : - the [ vasa museum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vasa_\\ ( ship \\ ) ) . 
  vasa is a well-preserved 17th-century warship . 
  it 's been a few years since i was there , but from i remember the museum is great . 
  it 's not `` just a boat '' . 
  - [ livrustskammaren ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/livrustkammaren ) in the basement of the royal palace . 
  oldest museum in sweden . 
  focuses on swedish royal history . 
  this of course includes a lot of plate armor and such from the days of the swedish empire . 
  they also have stuff stolen from the polish . 
  but those two may not be military museums outright . 
  i do n't really know what requirement 's you have for that . 
  if you 're into more recent and solely military-focused museums , i ca n't really help as i have n't been to any , but here 's a [ wikipedia list ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/lista_%c3%b6ver_milit%c3%a4rhistoriska_museer_i_sverige ) ( it 's in swedish , but several of the individual museum 's articles exists on the english wiki as well ) . 
  but as i said , i ca n't verify their greatness . 
  we 're cold . 
  both in climate and personality . 
  -- well ... that 's not realistic . 
  but i really do n't know what ads for watered down things we put out there to attract tourists . 
  all i see from a google search seems pretty factual and authentic to me . 
  maybe a bit too much focus on stockholm , but that 's just personal preference . 
  otherwise , i really do n't know . 
   you have nice winters . 
  that differs quite a bit . 
  sweden stretches 15 latitudes and two geographical zones . 
  in the northernmost parts the sun never rise , which is n't great even for people used to it . 
  in the flat south it 's mostly the same as yours ' . 
   mind throwing some proper snow this way this winter ? 
  yes , please !, 
   that attitude is so prevalent here in the uk considering how widespread it is here , a country where english is n't even the native language , that does n't really surprise me . 
  we do learn a third language to a basic conversational level , but i do n't know how much of that the average swede retains . 
  most people seem to think it 's pointless . 
  also , i do think that the traditional foreign language learning is very inefficient and has some fundamental flaws as well , at least the classes i 've taken . 
  but that 's another issue . 
  copied ? 
  i 'll have you know it was god who showed it to erik the holy in 1157 !,
