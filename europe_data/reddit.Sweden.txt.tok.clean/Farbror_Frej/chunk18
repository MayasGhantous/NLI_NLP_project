   also , it 's not entirely relevant if the estonian expression is a derivative of the german one anyway . 
  yeah , i know . 
  i just found it a bit amusingly contradictory . 
  ooh , that term exists on the swedish wikipedia page of [ curtains ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/gardin#uttrycket_.22schwedische_gardinen.22_.28svenska_gardiner.29 ) . 
  it says the same thing . 
  rough translation :  according to a widespread theory the origin of the term comes from military slang from the thirsty years war [ ... ] but no contemporary sources exist , and it 's earliest known usage is from 1906 more likely , it originated in 19th-century criminal circles , at the time sweden became famous for it 's steel -- `` schwedenstahl '' is still well-know in germany etc. 
  and it has spread to estonia who themselves were part of the swedish empire at the time ? 
  fascinating, 
  well , i 've studied it for eight years or so and used to live in spain , i know it well enough . 
  had a teacher in spain who always wore a pair , so ... presenting yourself as a swede in spain is ... interesting . 
  if you say you 're a * sueco * `` funny '' people always go `` uy , no te hagas el sueco !, 
  jajaj\u00e1 '' or something , and if you instead say you 're from * suecia * it 's always `` suiza ? '' . 
  you spaniards ... , 
   swedish curtains - prison what 's the origin of that one ? 
  the only one somewhat related that i can think of is : \u2022 polsk riksdag ( polish parliament ) : something chaotic , disordered and just to defend me and my countrymen 's honor , the expression `` hacerse el sueco `` s etymological background most likely originated from the word * zueco * ( clog-type shoe ) , and not swedes . 
  zueco came to mean dumb after the roman actors , and especially comedians , who wore that type of shoe when performing . 
  edit : spelling, 
   meatballs to me should not be sweet me neither . 
  no way . 
  never . 
  lingonberries are tart , and the jam should never be very sweet . 
  lingonberry jam is n't like some strawberry or raspberry jam or some other sweet jam . 
  and while some sugar is added to `` balance '' the tartiness , only bad jam could ever be considered `` sweet '' in my book . 
  besides `` raw-stirred '' lingonberries or untouched lingonberries are preferred to the jam anyway , and that 's even tarter . 
  as for the tartiness , i guess it 's every man to his taste . 
  to me meatballs without the acidity of the lingonberries is missing something . 
  anyway ... what i 'm trying to say : lingonberries are not sweet . 
  ^ ( apologies if i 'm inarticulate . 
  it 's 03:50 on a weekday and i 'm tired . 
  good night . ), 
  lingonberry/cowberry/partridgeberry / foxberry/redberry etc. . . you do n't get lingonberry jam with the meatballs at canadian ikeas ? 
  sweet . 
  with potatoes , lingonberry jam and gravy ? 
  that reminds me , lingonberry jam and `` raw-stirred '' lingonberries are also very popular here . 
  add that to the answer of the op question . 
  well , it 's * technically * just fermented fish so i suppose we 're fine then !, 
  i get that . 
  it 's what pops into my head when i hear porridge too . 
  in reality porridge is just ground/crushed grains boiled in water/milk . 
  looks pretty similar . 
  they 're nothing special , so it 's not really important . 
  just some breakfast cereal made of oats . 
  make you own meatballs !, 
  it 's easy , and they 're better anyway . 
  all you need is some minced meat , eggs , breadcrumbs/potatoes , onions , salt , black pepper and cream . 
   ketchup should not be used on pasta . 
  oh , please , next you 'll tell me you should n't eat rotten fish either ... 
   i mean , you could live on the edge but i guess to each their own . 
  oh , last time i was in the us i flew with southwest and their heavenly in-flight snacks . 
  sitting in metal tube a few thousand meters up in a cloud of peanut dust , now that 's living . 
   can porridge be made with anything other than oats ? 
  sure , most cereals work . 
  semolina porridge 's not uncommon here . 
  [ rice pudding ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rice_pudding#nordic_countries ) is pretty common , and a standard for christmas . 
  oats are the most common for breakfast though . 
   i am trying to figure out what you mean by pillowy quaker things . 
  i mean [ these ] ( https://cdn1.cdnme.se/cdn/9-2/605086/images/2009/fras_33272006.jpg ) . 
  i know they exist elsewhere , but not what they 're called . 
  they 're primarily made by quaker oats company . 
  crunchy square oat cushion thingymajigs . 
   is julmast just juice ? 
  julmust is a carbonated soft drink . 
  do n't really know how to explain it . 
  it tastes a bit like coke with a hint of hops , or ... something . 
  it 's delicious . 
  because of everyone drinking julmust , sweden is one of the very few countries where coca-cola sales go down during christmas , and not by a little either , it cuts in half . 
  if you have an ikea nearby you could probably try it for christmas . 
  their julmust is like all their food , not the best . 
  but it gives you an idea . 
   you are sick for doing what you do to pasta !, 
  haha , personally i 'm not the biggest fan . 
  i prefer just adding some simple parmesan . 
  buuut ... 
  it 's not * that * bad . 
   peanut butter you can find it in a supermarket , but it 's not very popular . 
  honestly i do n't know much about it , i 'm allergic so i do my best to stay away . 
  do n't feel like dying , for ... reasons . 
   jam/jelly strawberry jam , cloudberry jam , and `` queen '' jam ( blueberry & raspberry ) are common for waffles/pancakes . 
  marmalade of oranges or apricots and such is pretty popular on bread . 
  in my family we typically make homemade jam during summer . 
  the most popular brands are probably the store brands , ` bob ' or , if you 're willing to spend a few extra crowns , ' \u00d6nos ' . 
   ready to eat meals do n't eat those a lot myself , so not sure . 
  i used to eat [ `` billy 's pan pizza '' ] ( https://res.cloudinary.com/coopsverige/image/upload/v1444247381/61034.jpg ) and [ `` gorby 's pirog '' ] ( https://static.mathem.se/shared/images/products/large/fryst-pirog-original-120g-gorbys-1578909153.jpg ) when i was younger , might still be popular . 
  ( yes , their names are plays on bill clinton ( `` american '' pan pizza ) and gorbachev ( `` russian '' pirozhki ) )  common breakfast items traditional swedish breakfast no. 1 is porridge made from oatmeal . 
  some eat sandwiches . 
  i typically eat some cereal with milk myself . 
  big breakfasts are n't very common . 
   cereal kellogg 's and quaker oats are big . 
  cornflakes and those pillowy quaker thingies ( do n't know english name ) are popular among others . 
   common beverages tap water , coffee , tea , juice , coffee , soft drinks , and more coffee . 
  pretty similar to canada afaik . 
  for christmas [ julmust ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/julmust ) is a must . 
   common condiments ketchup , mustard , mayo . 
  pretty standard . 
  ca n't think of anything typically swedish . 
   ... pasta ... 
  pretty standard to buy dry 7-8 minute pasta . 
  having ketchup to the pasta is pretty common , especially among children but plenty of adults have it too . 
  ( i hope no italian read this )  common alcoholic beverages ? 
  beer , wine etc.
