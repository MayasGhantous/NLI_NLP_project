  alcohol is pretty expensive and reserved for friday/saturday/holidays . 
  drinking during the week you may be seen as an alcoholic . 
  binge drinking during the weekend is fine though ... for holiday feasts and such , shots of [ akvavit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/akvavit ) are a necessity . 
  are n't you ? 
  snow ? 
  ... in northern europe ? 
  who would 've thought ? 
  no , but putting them together to make what we call kebabpizza is !, 
   grapes are n't french , but champagne sure is . 
   kebabpizza he said * not * from your country . 
  no high speed line connects to my city , but i do take the regular `` higher-speed '' trains to other cities in sweden and denmark occasionally . 
  whether it 's better than taking a car , i do n't know . 
  they 're not entirely comparable . 
  a train ride and a car drive takes about the same time . 
  the price difference depends on how far you go , but usually it 'd be similar * ish * to driving . 
  the car is obviously more versatile . 
  you can stop if you wa n't , make a detour etc. 
  but , if you 're going to a city , also more clunky as you need to find a parking spot etc. 
  when flying for example , i pretty much always take the train to copenhagen airport , it stops right there and you do n't have to think about long-term parking . 
  otherwise it depends ; is the place i 'm going to/visiting * not * easily accessible from the train station ? 
  probably car . 
  is it ? 
  choo-choo , here we go !, 
  ... unless it 's a snowy winter . 
  then the system collapses and delays are imminent . 
  what do you mean ` like last time ' ? 
  the kalmar union ? 
  that one was ruined because christian 2 . a.k.a. 
  the tyrant , the irresolute mad man , decided to break his promise of amnesty and have a nice little bloodbath in the middle of stockholm . 
  before that the pro-unionists handily outnumbered by the anti ones in sweden . 
  not disagreeing with the sentiment though . 
  it probably would n't work with us , it rarely does when one region 's significantly more populous , at least not in a democracy . 
  but i 'm not convinced dk-no-is would get along very nicely either . 
  remember they both broke away from you and neither country would want to give up their power . 
  there used to be a true dialect continuum between romance languages . 
  whether it 's still there in a matter of debate as a lot of the intermediate dialects have been dying out in recent centuries . 
  not sure i understand , if wages below the average were n't allowed , the average ( and , by extension , the wages ) would just keep rising , no ? 
  anyway , as has been said , in sweden salaries are negotiated through collective agreements between employer and employee unions for each individual field of work . 
  so there 's no need for the state to interfere . 
  that is correct . 
  i 'd assume that depends on the legislation in the country etc. 
  but minimum is minimum , going lower would n't be legal . 
  i think ... 
  here in sweden we do n't have any minimum wage , so i do n't know . 
  it 's similar in this pretty secularized protestant town as well i suppose . 
  our cathedral is the only notable building . 
  how big do you make chapels in germany ? 
  50m does n't really sound like a ` little ' one to me . 
  here the cathedral is 63 meters tall and the regular churches a bit smaller . 
  the standalone chapels we have are much much smaller than that . 
  it 's nothing special , just a clip from the show . 
  it 's really more reality tv than a documentary and has been going for like 7 seasons . 
  not my cup of tea , but i guess someone must like it . 
  anyway ... [ here are ] ( https://youtu.be/tykgthkc1qw?t=2m40s ) [ a few ] ( https://youtu.be/vbf6oef40pw?t=48s ) [ more ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yeddepij7g ) , in case you really want to watch for some reason . 
   people that are very poor , people with bad hygiene , homeless people , the morbidly obese do n't know about any of that that . 
  the closest thing are probably the `` people of [ ullared ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gek%c3%a5s ) '' . 
  there 's a [ documentary/reality tv-series ] ( https://youtu.be/iylwtpt409a?t=11s ) following people there . 
  some are a bit odd . 
  you should give ' \u00f6 ' the sovereignty it deserves . 
  \u00d6 is a strong and independent letter , not some pesky o with dots !, 
  well ... uhm ... i do n't know about that . 
  they 're * technically * not umlauts in swedish , so ... 
  silly danes , stop putting null signs in the middle of words and embrace the \u00d6 . 
  i mean , i 'm by no means a professional and i feel pretty average ... 
  but maybe i 'm just weird . 
  absolutely , i know . 
  it definitely is . 
  myriameter is the fancy name for our `` mil '' . 
  and fuel consumption measurements have been switching to using l/100km rather than the old l/mil . 
  some still use l/mil , but l/100km is probably more common nowadays . 
  yes and no . 
  the term ` the west ' is far older than the cold war . 
  it also refers to the historical ` occident ' ( from latin for ` west ' / sunset ) , opposed with the ` orient ' ( from the latin for ` east ' / sunrise ; asia ) . 
  that 's the term i interpreted op using as ( s ) he also wrote ` western civilization ' . 
  yeah , i know about the `` first - '' , `` second - '' and `` third '' world . 
  i come from sweden , a third world county . 
   what is eastern europe ? 
  depends entirely on the context . 
  the political , geographical , historical ... eastern europes are all different to me . 
  but if you just say ` eastern europe ' without pre-established context , i generally imagine the countries located east of v4 . 
   does your country belong to eastern europe ? 
  sweden , no . 
   what countries constitute `` the west '' or `` western civilization '' , in your opinion ? 
  difficult question . 
  my immediate thought : eu/eea , us and the older commonwealth realms australia , nz and canada . 
  but i really do n't know why mate ... 
   viking may come from the viking town viken is not a very widely accepted theory among historians . 
  most agree that the word originated straight from the word v\u00edk ( bay ) + * ing * . 
  bay * ling * , if you will . 
  but , yes , nowadays it is pretty much synonymous with norsemen , so it 's not totally wrong to refer to the people as vikings . 
  [ these ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prince_oscar,_duke_of_sk%c3%a5ne ) [ two ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prince_alexander,_duke_of_s%c3%b6dermanland ) cousins , mate . 
  have n't heard a single good thing they 've accomplished themselves , and still they 've headlined newspapers all summer . 
  yup , same for sweden, 
  i know !, 
  i 'm not being serious , 
  the flairs are done by the mods who are : - [ swiss ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/1tpfxv/_/cea71ww?context=10000 ) ( or at least lived there ) - [ swiss ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/military/comments/3swmr0/_/cx8czqr ) - [ scottish ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1svhfn/_/ce1qten ) ( technically ... ? 
  whatever that means ) - [ scottish ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ghoststories/comments/1kl4yd/_/cbq5y09 ) ( or at least lived in aberdeen ) - [ english ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/3uaq4x/does_odeon_accept_nonnus_affiliated_student_id/ ) ( or at least went to university in southampton ) - [ english ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/45fnod/_/czxqovl ) ( at least lived in chesterfield ) - [ english ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/scotland/comments/3e3kq2/_/ctbgh0j ) ( or at least lived there ), 
  pretty much yeah, 
  that is secondary school . 
  it is the equivalent of high school in the us .
