  functions a bit differently from regular secondary education . 
  you generally do n't have any tests and you wo n't receive grades in each subject . 
  rather you receive an overall grade in `` studying capacity '' for all subjects . 
  i did it for a year , thought it was great . 
  * university , `` universitet '' / `` h\u00f6gskola '' . 
  free for all eu/eea-citizens . 
  everyone with the prerequisite education can get in . 
  granted , there 's an application process so you may not get into the highly competitive programmes . 
   all are free . 
  at each level are you 're eligible for some kind of social security payment . 
  child benefits in primary school , and student benefits in upper secondary school . 
  student grants from the ministry of education from 18 + , they also offer the possibility of extra money through low interest student loans, 
  i do n't know about `` very very '' , but yeah , there is a stereotype for not being very wasteful . 
  goes a bit hand in hand with the whole hard working salt of the earth if you ask me . 
  ikea 's ingvar kamprad is a pretty typical sm\u00e5landian . 
  can be noted there are a lot of different dialects across sm\u00e5land . 
  sm\u00e5l\u00e4ndska is a pretty wide umbrella term . 
  some border region dialects ( like tjustm\u00e5l ) are stereotyped more with their neighbor regions than other sm\u00e5land dialects in my experience . 
  pretty sure i 've got him on my wall . 
  i 've got a very old framed print of [ * wexi\u00f6 torg \u00e5r 1837 * ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/v%c3%a4xj%c3%b6_torget_1837_sfgt8.jpg/1280px-v%c3%a4xj%c3%b6_torget_1837_sfgt8.jpg ) and if i 'm not mistaken he 's the tall dude near the center . 
  is he the guy that carried a massive bag of salt from karlshamn to tors\u00e5s that no one else could even lift ? 
  yup . 
  it means ` chaos ' or ` turmoil ' in swedish , comes from the [ skirmish at bender ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/skirmish_at_bender ) . 
  you are correct , they 're only scientific in english too . 
  \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m is simply a unit of length that has a few other applications than the one you mentioned , but yeah , it 's super tiny and not really useful outside of science . 
  tungsten is n't really used in swedish anymore either , it 's outdated . 
  originally it was the name for scheelite which then expanded to the element found in scheelite , but now the mineral is called * scheelit * and the element * volfram * . 
  ` tung sten ' can of course be used , it simply means `` heavy stone '' , but the compound ` tungsten ' is n't . 
   from your list in english , i have only come across `` lingonberry '' , `` ombudsman '' , `` moped '' and `` orienteering '' . 
  it 's very much possible you 've heard ` smorgasbord ' sometime in some movie or tv show , it 's not too rare . 
  i 'm more surprised by orienteering , it 's kind of a niche sport in the anglo world in my experience . 
  but yes , the other words on that list is pretty much just specific jargon . 
  ` lek ' has to do with mating habits in english and is used in biology and zoology , ` fartlek ' is a type of interval training for long distance runners etc. , not exactly words you 'd use in everyday conversation . 
  in sweden it refers to a range of different crispy flatbreads , but something like [ this ] ( http://lchf-recept.se/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/bread_knackebrod_crumb_500.jpg ) is the traditional one , it 's based on rye . 
  you can use it to refer to such in english too , but it 's not common language and i do n't know which dictionary would have it . 
  the generic english term for such flatbread would be crispbread . 
   i even think we pronounce it the same way , but i ca n't say for sure . 
  i do n't know the swedish pronunciation rules myself . 
  i believe you would , yes . 
  the most significant differences i can imagine is that you 'd put a little more emphasis on the 'd ' than most here and that the ` e 's would be a little different , but i do n't really know . 
  the pronunciation of ` r ' also varies quite a bit depending on dialect here so that may be different from yours , but otherwise i can imagine it 'd be decently similar . 
  not all . 
  rutabaga is for example just a respelling of the dialectal rotabagge ( rotbagge , a.k.a. 
  and i 'm not sure i understand what that lists constitutes loan words . 
  you 'll for example have a difficult time finding ` kn\u00e4ckebr\u00f6d ' in a dictionary , it 's crispbread . 
  if you include such names you can include surstr\u00f6mming etc. 
  too . 
  technically the farm is called \u00c4lmtaryd , elmtaryd is an outdated spelling for it . 
  ik\u00c4a does n't have quite the same ring to it . 
  i 've seen examples of it used long before any significant swedish contact , so it 'd be weird if it actually came from us . 
  but i do n't know , maybe it is . 
  it 's a much older term . 
  the general consensus i 've heard of it 's etymology says it comes from ** z ** ueco , i.e. 
  the shoe the roman actors , especially comedians , wore . 
  it just morphed into ** s ** ueco . 
  it actually has little to do with us . 
  the general consensus i 've heard of it 's etymology says it comes from the similar sounding word * zueco * ( ` swede ' is * sueco * ) . 
  zueco is a type of clog which the roman actors , especially comedians , wore . 
  it just morphed into * sueco * . 
  just to defend my countrymen 's honor : the expression most likely originated from the word * zueco * ( clog-type shoe ) , and not * sueco * ( swede ) . 
  * zueco * came to mean dumb after the roman actors , and especially comedians , who wore that type of shoe when performing . 
  they probably mean the surstr\u00f6mming , rakfisk , or h\u00e1karl of sweden , norway , and iceland respectively . 
  neither is rotten , but they are fermented . 
  i 've never heard lutfisk described as rotten . 
  surstr\u00f6mming both smells and tastes more pungent than h\u00e1karl . 
  i like both myself , but most who do n't will probably find surstr\u00f6mming worse . 
  significantly worse . 
  traditionally it 's eaten with diced onions and potatoes ( preferably [ almonds ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/almond_\\ ( potato \\ ) ) ) on swedish flatbread ( [ * tunnbr\u00f6d * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tunnbr%c3%b6d ) ) . 
  you could use two buttered pieces of crispy tunnbr\u00f6d to make a little sandwich , or go burrito-style using the soft tunnbr\u00f6d . 
  some also just eat it on a plate with the potatoes and onions , but if it 's your first time i 'd go with the tunnbr\u00f6d . 
  some swear by adding a touch of dill and sour cream or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche , which is fine . 
  but the three most important things are : the potatoes , onions , and the fish itself . 
  and if it 's your first time , do n't use too high concentration of fish compared to the other ingredients . 
  also , eat it outside . 
  as someone else said , the international baccalaureate ( ib ) does require service work . 
  it originally comes , and is administered , from switzerland , but i do n't know if the idea of service work comes from there . 
  it is international after all . 
  [ * the greenest city in europe !, 
  * ] ( http://www.vaxjo.se/upload/profileradwebbplats/n%c3%a4tverketexpansivav%c3%a4xj%c3%b6/logotyper/vaxjo_egs_rgb_eng.png ) ( ... is the actual official slogan ) it 's alright . 
  we have plenty of forests in these parts and in the city itself there are some smaller parks . 
  our buses are also green if that counts ? 
   there 's not too much traffic and there 's a lake downtown so the air quality and such is always pretty good . 
  open it outside , away from any windows or ventilation intakes . 
  when you open it , tilt the can 45 \u00b0 and puncture at the top , once the can had depressurized you can lay it down flat and open normally . 
  alternatively i 've heard you can puncture the can in a plastic bag or underwater , but they 're not methods i 've used , i just tilt it 45 \u00b0 . 
  this is to prevent spray . 
  the surstr\u00f6mming comes as either fillets or whole fish . 
  if your can contains whole fish , you have to gut it . 
  traditionally it 's eaten with diced onions and potatoes ( preferably almond potatoes ) on thin flatbread ( swedish * tunnbr\u00f6d * ) . 
  you could use two buttered pieces of crispy flatbread to make a little sandwich , or go burrito-style using soft flatbread . 
  some also just eat it on a plate with the potatoes and onions , but if it 's your first time i 'd go with the flatbread . 
  some also swear by adding a touch of sour cream or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and dill . 
  but the most important things are potatoes , onions , and the fish itself . 
  and do n't use too high concentration of fish compared to the other ingredients if it 's your first time . 
  different strokes i suppose . 
  i prefer the surstr\u00f6mming over crayfish party . 
  it 's not like it smells that bad when you sit outside and do n't deliberately put your nose in the can . 
  and there are plenty of other foodstuffs that smell . 
  but it 's certainly not for everyone . 
  i do think you should try it if you get the opportunity .
