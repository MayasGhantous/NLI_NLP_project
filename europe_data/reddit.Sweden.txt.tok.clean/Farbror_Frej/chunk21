  it does in many languages . 
  probably why no one wants to share some fika with us . 
  * troja * means troy ( the ancient city ) in swedish . 
  * tr\u00f6ja * means sweater . 
  * merda * does n't mean anything in swedish . 
  maybe you 're thinking of * kaka * ( cake/cookie ) . 
  probably not . 
  in all likelihood that 's just a legend stemming from the french comedy * le camarade de lit * , in which the king has some similar tattoo iirc . 
  he did allegedly say something about being a republican at heart and wanting to fight all royalists to the death however . 
  before becoming a king himself , obviously . 
  m\u00e4n = men , kvinnor = women . 
  the swedish act of succession works on absolute primogeniture . 
  as in the eldest child is next in line . 
  as such , the next in line is currently crown princess victoria ( our king 's first born ) , followed by estelle and oscar ( her children ) , then prince carl philip ( the king 's second born ) , then his kid ... etc. 
  so , first of all , we 're not subjects ... at all . 
  republicanism exists . 
  all the major left-wing parties ( social democrats , left party , greens ) have included abolishing the monarchy on their party platform in the past , but neither is working very actively towards it . 
  there 's also a republican association , that does ... something , i guess ? 
  for the general populace , i 'd say the monarchy is a non-issue . 
  the king is a lovable goof , and he has no executive power anyway . 
  [ here 's the latest poll ] ( http://i.imgur.com/oriaisy.png ) i could find ( from march this year ) . 
  dark blue 's for keeping the monarchy , lighter blue for abolishing it . 
  that i do not know , it would depend on the department for transport i guess . 
  no non-eu country issues the circle of stars to my knowledge . 
  it is and it is n't . 
  it was originally adopted by the council of europe to represent europe as a whole . 
  it is however an official symbol for both the council and eu nowadays . 
  so , while it does represent the eu , it is n't a flag of the eu . 
  well , i would n't exactly call the original lyrics high-class and intelligent ... 
  but man i do n't know , it must 've been what like 10 years since i last heard that song . 
  lisping and stuttering are probably the most common ones . 
  inability to pronounce ` r ' is also fairly common i suppose , but in my dialect they are n't really that prominent anyway . 
  i 'd never heard of it so ... 
  pretty sure most people here still think that song is about * b\u00e5ten * ( the boat ) rather than a bot , it is pretty excusable considering the double meanings in the lyrics . 
  but , are those dutch lyrics about an actual boat ? 
  we use them pretty liberally . 
  in general i think people try to use the original pronunciation but without entirely switching the phonetic profile , so i suppose it ends up somewhere in the middle * ish * , but closer to swedish phonetics . 
  words are generally conjugated to fit the swedish standards . 
  so verbs end in - a in infinitive ( ex . 
  `` to chat '' becomes `` att chatta '' , `` to google '' becomes `` att googla '' ) etc. 
   best-tasting tap water in europe oh , really ? 
  i can tell someone has n't been to where i live ... 
  i 'm * totally * unbiased , so you can definitely trust me when i say that we have the best !, 
  plenty of things , but they all depend entirely on which country you 're planning on migrating to . 
  i used to live in spain for example . 
  coming back i really appreciate the comparatively mild weather we have here . 
  but that would n't really be an issue if i were to migrate across the bridge to denmark where the weather is the same . 
  it seems to be 98 % puns and memes , 2 % other content nowadays . 
  i still check in once in a while hoping there will be something i find worthwhile , generally there is n't . 
  ca n't think of a single one . 
  all commonly used internet acronyms are in english . 
  we have some other acronyms , you know like ikea , saab and such , but in the digital world it 's all english . 
  not our equivalent . 
  the `` the '' here is a definite article , just like our `` den/det '' ( the articles , not the identical pronouns ) , that we use when there are any adjectives infront of the noun ( the precise thing this thread is about ! ) . 
  in such case , they are placed in the exact same spot as in english ( * den * gr\u00f6na draken vs. * the * green dragon ) . 
  what you 're thinking of are the suffixes '' -- en / -- et '' , that do n't exist in english where they 're instead denoted by the previously mentioned definite article . 
  the fact that we add those suffixes when an article has already been declared ( they 're completely unnecessary at that point ) is just because swedish is weird . 
  not even the danes do that ... 
  i 'm sure there 's plenty but i do n't really know , what is typically swedish ? 
  i do hate pickled herring , and those things are on the table for every festivity . 
  christmas , easter , midsummer ... you name it , they 're always there , haunting me . 
  i do like surstr\u00f6mming ( its fermented cousin ) though ... 
  nope , never . 
  seems to be the most natural order in swedish as well , at least in the phrases i can think of . 
  hmm , interesting ... 
  meh , maybe , at the pub it hardly matters if you go `` en \u00f6l '' or `` en stor stark '' , they 'll just give you whatever they 've got on tap , at least in my experience . 
  at a restaurant they may do a follow-up asking which alcohol level you want if you just say `` en \u00f6l '' . 
  might be a dialectal thing but never in my life have i gone `` en stor stark '' , it just feels so ... tacky ? 
  to me . 
   how do i have a simple conversations in your language ? 
  you do n't , not with strangers at least . 
  if you already have some swedish friends , just go and ask them so you can hear how it 's pronounced as well . 
   how do i order a beer ? 
  or preferably , go to some other country with reasonable prices on alcohol . 
  i understand your reasoning , but i 'd personally argue the direct translation `` water scooter '' would be better as * skoter * is literally a loan word of the english * scooter * . 
  it 's rather the `` sn\u00f6skoter '' that should be changed to `` snow scooter '' if directly translated . 
  then again , it hardly matters ... 
  to some stockholmers i 've met , everywhere not stockholm is pretty much hillbillycountry , with the possible exceptions of gothenburg ( `` lame wannabes '' ) , malm\u00f6 ( `` pretty much denmark '' ) and uppsala ( `` the university ? '' ) . 
  ca n't think of any specific city that has a nationwide reputation for being such . 
  when i grew up i remember j\u00f6nk\u00f6ping getting a lot of flak for being `` a bit behind '' and weird , being the ` capital ' of the bible belt and all that . 
  yup , we 're obligated to join , but not obligated to meet the requirements to join . 
  we 've even had a referendum on whether or not to do it . 
  but considering we 're currently in the process of an expensive , complete redesign all of our bills and coins ( and adding a 200kr bill ) , it 'll be a long time until the euro 's on the table again . 
  yup . 
  they used to stock the major swedish national brands , but have been moving towards only offering their own mediocre store brand . 
  they 've gotten quite a lot of complains about it from swedes , especially those living abroad who previously could just go to ikea to get high-quality swedish food . 
  we sold the last one 138 years ago , so it 's history . 
  do n't even think people living in those areas know they were once swedish colonies , even if saint barth\u00e9lemy still wields our three crown on their coat of arms and philadelphia 's flag is in our colors . 
  do n't know why you guys in cyprus ca n't , most of us can ... 
  they 're called kanelbullar . 
  do n't know how good they are however , have n't had one from ikea in a long time . 
  i 'm not gon na debate the quality of french automobiles but do n't you dare disparage our cinnamon rolls , they 're are delicious !, 
  sweden . 
  we invented them . 
  maybe they 're from the future , 
  [ the united nations superhero man !, 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/yn-oemgzleu?t=3s ), 
  where i 'm from it 's extremely common . 
  most popular are probably kantarell [ ( chanterelle ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chanterelle ) , trattkantarell [ ( yellowfoot ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/craterellus_tubaeformis ) , karljohansvamp/stensopp [ ( penny bun ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boletus_edulis ) and sm\u00f6rsopp [ ( slippery jack ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suillus_luteus ) , in that order . 
  sounds just like sweden .
