  the reason the cans bulge is because the fermentation process continues inside the can and produces gases which builds up enough pressure to bend the metal . 
  that it tastes better than it smells is honestly a bit of an understatement . 
  it smells absolutely putrid and tastes pretty good when eaten properly . 
  but yeah , i think it 's nice at least . 
  many are deterred by the smell before even tasting it . 
  yeah , i was talking about the dish , not the fish . 
  if you were just given the fish , you did n't try the dish . 
  the dish is also referred to as just * surstr\u00f6mming * . 
  eating it as it is is like eating uncooked pasta . 
  sure , you * can * do that , but it 's not going to taste as intended . 
  the fish acts like seasoning to the dish , and like most seasonings it 's not particularly good on its own . 
  surstr\u00f6mming just smells bad , but so does a lot of other food . 
  the dish is pretty good . 
  you should try some if you get the opportunity . 
  of course it 's not going to be good if you misuse it as 99 % of people you 'll see on youtube . 
  yeah i know , i told you , i lived in spain . 
  it was n't just a short erasmus partying stint or such , i lived there full time . 
  i went to high school , graduated , did some odd jobs etc. 
  i only moved back to sweden for university and that was the year i turned 21 i believe . 
  i was of the age group where cali is supposed to be popular . 
  although in my personal experience it ca n't really say it was , but i suppose some may have made it . 
  i do n't like coca-cola and back then i did n't like wine either , so i never had any interest of even trying . 
  i would say tinto de verano and such were much more common than cali , at least where i lived and among my friends . 
  oh i know of cali , i used to live in spain . 
  but i also know it 's a thing that may not be too appreciated in france so i figured misusing their wine would make for good pretend retaliation for misusing our fish . 
  i do think it sounds awful , but i never actually tried it . 
  so really , who am i to judge ? 
  fermented herring . 
  it 's pretty salty and a bit acidic , and smells putrid . 
  when eaten properly it 's kind of like a seasoning for the dish . 
  you essentially add just enough salt ( brine ) to prevent the herrings from rotting , but not enough to stop other harmless bacteria from functioning , and then leave them for a few months . 
  bacteria and enzymes will then cause acids to form and such stuff to happen . 
  this process also continues after they 're put in a can , which is why you can sometimes see the cans bulge from pressure of gasses and why you get a lot of smelly spray on you if you open the can incorrectly . 
  another thing that 's important is to keep it refrigerated , which many seem to not understand since it 's in a can . 
  but in any warmer environment different enzymes will activate and cause the fish to actually break down , forming a grey soupy mess . 
  properly stored surstr\u00f6mming will still be whole fish/filets when opened . 
  the smell is what most find off-putting . 
  and as opposed to youtube challenges , surstr\u00f6mming is meant to be eaten as part of their eponymous dish and not as it is . 
  they 're opening it wrongly , in a very unsuitable location , and then tops it all off by eating it improperly . 
  the urge to get some french wine just to put cola and blocks of ice in it is rising ... ^ ( ( would n't actually do that , sounds pretty disgusting , but you know ... ) ^ ) . 
  not sure what stovies is , but it may very well be related . 
  labskaus is the german variant of lobscouse , which was eaten all around the north sea , mostly by sailors . 
  it is pretty good . 
  it just smells repugnant . 
  that 's why it 's opened , and usually also eaten , outside . 
  you certainly would n't want a can to open in an enclosed metal cylinder 11000 meters up in the air . 
  the reasoning for the ban is ridiculous as they just do n't explode , but i suspect it has more to do with avoiding the smell in case someone brought a punctured can and spoiled everyone 's luggage or something , which i can understand . 
  but there are plenty of other smelly things allowed , so i do n't know . 
  ^ ( edit : added an ` in ' that was missing ), 
  we do , it 's the basic pronunciation of our ` g ' . 
  when followed by a `` soft '' vowel ( e , i , y , \u00e4 , \u00f6 ) ` g ' generally becomes / j / in native words , and can be / & # 615 ; / ( our `` sj-sound '' ) in some french loan words . 
  but most of the time ` g ' is a hard / \u0261 / for us . 
  when i studied latin it was based on standard classical pronunciation , which is to my knowledge true for most latin educations here . 
  even when we were touching on more recent latin we were for the most part using classical pronunciation . 
  as for the swedish pronunciation of it ... 
  i suppose most pronounce things more similar to swedish orthography . 
  but i have n't really thought about it , it 's very rare that i hear it . 
  the ` g ' in the latin * regina * would by most probably be / g / ( ** g ** un ) , but i can imagine some pronouncing it as / j / ( ** y ** ankee ) . 
  they really do n't mean anything to me and i ca n't even remember ever seeing one in my part of sweden . 
  i know , i. . . i did n't want anyone to know . 
  i do have cups , really bad cups . 
  sometimes i ca n't even calm down and relax with a morning coffee because of my cups ... 
  i really do n't want to blame my misfortunes or so , but sometimes i really do feel held back by cups , you know ? 
  and i often wonder -- what would my life have been like without cups ? 
  it 's such an integral part of my life , i ca n't ... 
  i ca n't even imagine not having cups . 
  i know , i 'm a renowned stalker . 
  known for opening user pages and noticing the sixth last posts ... 
  it 's a problem . 
  : / ^ ( ( i actually only checked when replying to you about the hedgehog earlier since i 've accidentally stepped on moravian toes before and do n't to want again ... ) ^ ) the song is n't technically related to bohemia in any way really . 
  it refers to * bohemianism * -- which is a lifestyle that 's related to that of the romanis -- who the french had mistaken as having come from bohemia -- a region you 're not actually from ... 
  it 's ... something . 
  ah , ok . got it . 
  and tagliatelle was my favorite type of pasta growing up , i know it well !, 
  it 's actually what i preferred with what 's in swedish called so imaginatively * spaghetti med k\u00f6ttf\u00e4rss\u00e5s * ( `` spaghetti with minced-meat-sauce '' ) . 
  i know the difference , but * spaghetti * can kind of be used for all noodly italian pasta types in swedish , incl . 
  things like tagliatelle . 
  do n't be mad , we do far worse things than that to italian cuisine ... 
  / u/kspreptile actually seem to [ be from brno ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/60mra6/how_old_is_your_city/df7tptw/?context=3 ) , which would be moravia if i 'm not mistaken . 
  granted it was a land under the bohemian crown , it 's not actually bohemia . 
  no , i know . 
  i 'm just saying there are stuff named after you guys . 
  but `` czech '' really is n't that old , at least not internationally . 
  there are probably more things named after more historically significant places like * bohemia * . 
  most notably anything socially unconventional . 
  the czech hedgehog is , at least in all of the languages i know . 
  there are also some animals that come from there like the czech red rabbit or czech warmblood . 
  is this `` rag\u00f9 '' the same as the meatsauce then ? 
  what are the differences ? 
  is it not used with spaghetti or something ? 
  man , i ca n't get anything right today . 
  i should just shut up about food , do n't think it 's meant for swedes . 
  i was lied to by another russian ( or someone pretending to be one ) then . 
  not intentional . 
  absolutely did n't intend to offend anyone , i 'm just paraphrasing what i 've been told . 
  sorry , i 'll cross it out . 
  mm , maybe . 
  i do love the name . 
  english soup : neither english nor soup . 
  in denmark they have * svensk p\u00f8lseret * ( `` swedish sausage dish '' ) , which no one here knows what it is .
