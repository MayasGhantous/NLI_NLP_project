  * zuppa inglese * ( `` english soup '' ) is an italian dessert . 
  in the us there 's a cake called * german chocolate cake * , it 's not german . 
  originally the name was * german 's chocolate cake * , german being a last name , which explains it . 
  * russischer zupfkuchen * and * russisch brot * are n't russian . 
  ~ ~ * olivier salad * is called russian salad in a lot of languages , despite not being as popular in russia . 
  may not count as it was actually invented in russia , albeit by a belgian if i 'm not mistaken . ~ ~ apparently not . 
  some other foodstuff named after places in countries : spaghetti bolognese , is n't really from bologna . 
  we have `` rhode island dressing '' and `` boston cucumbers '' here in sweden , neither having anything to do with the us . 
  hawaiian pizza is n't from hawaii . 
  not that it matters , but it was n't just at atocha station . 
  three bombs exploded at atocha , two at el pozo , one at santa eugenia , and four on a train just before entering atocha ( at calle de t\u00e9llez ) . 
  an additional three ieds were also found and detonated in controlled explosions . 
  out of the 192 who died , the plurality ( 67 ) died at el pozo . 
  followed by t\u00e9llez , and atocha . 
  ** tl ; dr ** no , not really . 
  especially not alice and doris . 
  and apologies for not being very succinct ... : / out of those four i do concede molly and charlie coming here from an anglo origin , but i do n't even think you can claim their gain in popularity is due to some anglicization . 
  kids are named names their parents like and find aesthetically pleasing , and people happen to like those names . 
  the names that may have trashier connotations here are more stuff ending in - y ; like conny , ronny , johnny etc. 
  people with names ending in - y have a statistically above average likelihood of being involved in criminal activities , so y' know ... 
  if anything , very traditional swedish names ( the stuff i 'd consider `` old people names '' ... ) have been on the rise in recent years , after having taken the backseat for decades . 
  ebba , saga , astrid , freja , elsa ( it was up there before frozen , so no , it 's not because that ... ) , axel , arvid , nils etc. 
  -- ** alice ** is probably here more due to french influence if anything . 
  it 's been here , and common at that , for centuries . 
  [ alice tegn\u00e9r ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alice_tegn%c3%a9r ) was one of the most famous children 's song and hymn writers we have for example . 
  ** doris ** comes from the greek mythology . 
  been here since the early 1800s , and it 's more likely it came here through germany than the uk . 
  no one would turn their head over that name , it 's seen as a completely normal swedish name . 
  but it 's not very popular , not even in the top 100 for newborn girls . 
  it 's more of a name for pets . 
  oldest sources for ** molly ** in sweden comes from 1806 . 
  but , sure , that is originally english . 
  it 's been here for a while , but mostly as a nickname . 
  in recent years it 's become more popular to name children what would traditionally have been nicknames , so it 's been rising . 
  last year it placed 17 of the most popular girl names for newborns . 
  ** charlie ** is also an originally anglo nickname ( for charles ) . 
  here it 's been a decently common nickname for variations of karl for quite some time , never as popular as ` kalle ' , but existent nonetheless . 
  like molly it 's climbed since `` nicknames as name '' has gotten more popular in recent years . 
  last year it ranked 9 in most popular .

  76,5 % of dogs and 35,6 % of cats have `` veterinary treatment insurance '' ( [ src ] ( http://www.jordbruksverket.se/download/18.300b18bd13d103e79ef80002666/hundar+och+katter.pdf#page=14 ) ) . 
  do n't think it 's very common for smaller rodents and such . 
  it 's like any insurance , if nothing ever happens to you , it is paying money for nothing . 
  but if something does , it 's good to have . 
  it sure helped when my dog needed emergency treatment a few months ago . 
  animal healthcare can be crazy expensive . 
  yep . 
  this is also true for sweden . 
  i 'm not even sure what you 're talking about . 
  some kind of uv-indicator , or what ? 
  what i wore in order to not get burned by the sun was spf 100 + and long sleeves . 
  it did not work . 
  ( also not as early as march ), 
  i suppose many reasons , but what 's so anglicized in this instance ? 
  `` our names '' are germanic , most of those have been swedish for centuries . 
   however , do you know about every brand 's name origin ? 
  nah , i did actually google herbert felix , was n't sure if it was herbert or hubert ... 
  but , sure , i know a few swedish ones . 
  it 's not that weird , is it ? 
  i grew up with them . 
  any other one you want to know ? 
   ** ikea ** : ** i ** ngvar ** k ** amprad ( the founder ) ** e ** lmtaryd ( his childhood farm ( old spelling ) ) ** a ** gunnaryd ( the parish the farm lies in ) . 
  pretty self-centered to be honest . 
  ** volvo ** : the very same latin word ( `` i roll '' ) ** saab ** : ** s ** venska ** a ** eroplan ** a ** ktie ** b ** olaget ( `` swedish airplane corporation '' ) . 
  `` ab '' ( ` aktiebolag ' ( `` stock company '' ) ) is essentially the swedish `` gmbh '' , `` ltd '' or such . 
  * hennes * ( `` hers '' ) sold clothes for women ; * mauritz widforss * sold hunting gear and menswear . 
  the owner of * hennes * acquired * mauritz widforss * , merged the names , and started including menswear in the product range . 
   it would be funny if i fed my findus with felix food . 
  he already sleeps on an ikea couch , while moving his ears to music on spotify . 
  pretty much an honorary swede at this point . 
  haha , those poor people ...   there 's also a felix brand here , they do food for animals , is it the same ? 
  probably not , it 's not really international to my knowledge . 
  ours make ketchup , salad dressings , pickles , meatballs , and stuff . 
  human food . 
  it was named after its founder , herbert felix , but it 's not like * felix * would be a rare and unsuitable word for a company . 
  it 's both joyful and prosperous . 
  literally . 
  when i was young i thought it was a normal human name ( although i did n't know anyone named it ) , just like we have another food company called * felix * . 
  but , nope , it 's just * fruktindustri * . 
  if i 'm not mistaken the cat got its name from pettson finding it in a food crate from findus or something like that . 
   `` findus '' is a brand of deep-frozen meat it 's a swedish brand , we have it too . 
   it started out as * sk\u00e5nska frukt-vin - & lik\u00f6rfabriken * ( `` the scanian fruit wine and liqueur factory '' ) as that what they originally did . 
  after wwii they started with frozen foodstuffs . 
  the name * findus * is a portmanteau of ** f ** rukt ** indus ** ti ( `` fruit industry '' ) . 
  but , mispronounced ... ? 
  do you mean you pronounce the two finduses different ? 
  most popular names according to agria ( big pet insurance company ) : ** dogs ( female ) : ** - molly - bella - wilma - doris - alice ** dogs ( male ) : ** - sigge ( traditional nickname for sigurd , sigvard and sigfrid ) - charlie - ludde ( traditional nickname for ludvig ) - bamse ( popular [ cartoon character ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bamse ) ) - hugo ** cats ( female ) : ** - maja - smulan ( `` the crumb '' ) - selma - molly - doris ** cats ( male ) : ** - sigge - nisse - findus ( popular [ cartoon character ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pettson_and_findus ) ) - sixten - tiger here are some other pets they list too : ** rabbits : ** - stampe - molly - smulan - ludde - bamse ** guinea pigs : ** - stinky - bella - doris ** hamsters : ** - smulan ( the crumb , again ) - p\u00e4rlan ( the pearl ) - puff ( puff ; it 's also the name of chip or dale ( the one with red nose whomever that is ) ) ** turtles : ** - skalman ( shell-man ; name of cartoon character from bamse ) - sk\u00f6ldis ( sk\u00f6ld = shield ) - doris ** reptiles ** : - rex - molly - spike - lucifer - yoda ** pigs : ** - nasse ( piglet from winnie-the-pooh ; also a name nazis but that 's a different story ) - pumba ( pumbaa , from the lion king and such ) - doris, 
  a hummer , my dad had one . 
  5,5 m long , 2m high and wide . 
  dreadful car for sweden , with our gas prices the wallet was empty by the time you got to the store ... also a ford transit , if that counts as a car . 
  may be larger , but i do n't know the size . 
  felt smaller than the hummer . 
  when i lived in malta and spain it would occasionally would go up to 40 + in august . 
  but i 've also experienced it traveling outside of europe , it 's not the hottest continent . 
  i do n't think there are many places in europe that averages as much as 35 , but it does occasionally go to 40 + in places . 
  but it 's not like it 's an everyday thing , but it happens . 
  do n't know what other southern european places you 've been to , but rome really is n't anywhere near as warm as places like c\u00f3rdoba from what i 've experienced of them . 
  granted the last time i went to rome it was hailing golfballs , which is something i really did n't expect in the summer , so maybe i have a skewed impression of roman weather . 
  yes , several times . 
  nothing to say really , temperatures rarely bother me .
