  neither hot nor cold . 
  i grew up in the sauna , it 's hotter . 
  the sun that usually is the cause for such weather does n't play nice with my palefaced scandinavian ass though . 
  so there 's a lot of cruising the shadows , fully dressed , with spf over 100 , and hope that it still does n't manage to somehow burn you . 
  i already have chronic nerve damage and pain from a sun burn i had as a kid . 
  `` moderator , speaking officially '' . 
  haha , i love the fact that you mod-distinguished this . 
  aww , man . 
  i thought he 'd mix it up on occasion , i 've gotten pretty much the exact [ same message ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ba5ioza.png ) . 
  except that i only sound `` stupid '' , you apparently sound `` fucking stupid '' . 
   but it 's kind of funny how the guy criticizing perfectly acceptable spellings , seem to have made a typo that actually does affect the meaning of the sentence ( so \u2260 do ) . 
  you speak british enough english then !, 
  i happened to write ` favor ' once which made me a `` stupid fucking americanised cunt '' . 
  he sends pms if you sound too american , not much else to say . 
  the cartilages and intervertebral discs do also degrade with age which causes the spine to compress slightly and does make you shorter . 
  this starts the instant you stop growing , but gets more noticeable the older you get . 
  so , really it 's both / u/vidicmufc . 
  according to scb ( the official statistics agency ) 2010-11 [ \u00b1 0,5-0 ,7 cm ] men : 16-19 : 179,7 20-29 : 180,9 30-39 : 180,5 40-49 : 180,6 50-59 : 179,1 60-69 : 178,2 70-79 : 176,6 80 + : 175,6 women : 16-19 : 166,6 20-29 : 166,9 30-39 : 166,7 40-49 : 166,0 50-59 : 165,9 60-69 : 165,3 70-79 : 163,8 80 + : 162,2, 
   literally * female dog * , but used as * bitch * just in case you did n't know : `` bitch '' is literally the english word for ` female dog ' . 
  though you 're probably more likely to see it in its vulgar usage nowadays . 
  yeah , same for me . 
  and you can kind of use those words for such an individual in spanish . 
  but they 're used in other contexts too . 
  a `` puta '' is more versatile than a `` bitch '' . 
  it could mean `` bitch '' , in could mean `` whore '' , or it could be just a plain old `` fuck !, 
  that is the usual translation . 
  * zorra * and * guarra * are also more frequently translated as * ` slut ' * . 
  but it 's a bit of a grey area , it could probably be translated as ` bitch ' in most cursing contexts . 
  * ` hijo de puta ' * is for example usually translated as * ` son of a bitch ' * . 
  otherwise the real `` bitch '' ( female dog ) is * ` perra ' * , which is used vulgarly by some , just like it is in english . 
  [ drottningholmsmusiken ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9rzix8btjy ) by johan helmich roman , `` the father of swedish music '' , i 'd say . 
  the first movement is probably the most famous bit . 
   but how would you notice the different prices if you use card and there are dual tags ? 
  i mean , dual tags ca n't be a permanent thing . 
  people would still need to start changing the way of thinking to prices in euros , even if you could see the old sek for a while . 
  sek is about a tenth of a euro , the mental `` is this expensive ? 
  '' - compass would need to be adjusted for most . 
  and the actual cost of things would probably change in the same way you just described for germany ... how things became more expensive . 
  business owners would certainly take the opportunity to exploit peoples love for round numbers and round up where possible . 
  so you 'd notice a change in the actual prices paid . 
  thirdly , i regularly check my internet bank and the card log over expenses . 
  there i 'd notice the difference of magnitude . 
  i think . 
  on another note , we 're currently going through a redesign of our coins and bills . 
  so if the different look of the cash would be the issue we 're currently facing it . 
  the biggest difference between euros and sek cash are that we have a 20 sek * bill * , where euro has a 2 $ * coin * . 
  also the euro also have all those tiny coins . 
  our smallest denomination is 1 sek which is about 10 cents , meaning we do n't have any equivalent of 1 , 2 , or 5 cent coins . 
  but i do n't know , i just think we 'd notice . 
  you ca n't buy a hotdog at my local arena with cash , only cards . 
  i myself have stopped carrying cash . 
  now that 's just anecdotal evidence , but yeah , card is king over here . 
  i think people would notice a change much like in any other country . 
  the biggest difference after a change is n't the paper bills , but the prices is n't it ? 
  even if you do keep dual tags for a while . 
  ^ edit : ^ corrected ^ a ^ typo, 
  that logo does actually remind me of [ that ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qywm1ry.png ) of my hometown hockey team . 
  huh , til we did . 
  awesome . 
  had n't heard of it , but it 's always nice when we get stuff . 
  did they do a good job hosting ? 
  just europe , the slogan is `` the greenest city in europe '' . 
  but how do you know about that ? 
  i did n't think anyone outside the city would , with the possible exception of that one bbc crew who coined it years ago . 
  that 's from my hometown v\u00e4xj\u00f6 ( [ same spot today ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@56.8793803,14.8104185,3a,75y,231.59h,84.82t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sj0pehbxcfhpkhrqc6l6sug!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) ) . 
  my parents knew the woman and her husband . 
  she was an immigrant from poland . 
  she herself was born after the war , but her mother had been in a nazi concentration camp . 
  she wanted nothing to do with the photo and hated the attention she received because of it . 
  she ended up committing suicide by jumping from the caf\u00e9 at the top of the water tower some three years after the photo was published . 
  it 's a powerful photo , but knowing her story kind of ruins it for me . 
  it 's a long , sad , and pretty dark one . 
  and i 've heard so many false rumors about that photo and her , that very imgur title mentions one . 
  as unflattering as the photo may be , she 's 38 there . 
  she was born after wwii had ended . 
  south sm\u00e5land , we have snow . 
  the first snow this winter ( that 's stayed on the ground ) . 
  ice hockey draws the second largest amount of viewers . 
  ` storbritannien ' is also * a * formal name , but yeah , you 're correct , ` f\u00f6renade konungariket storbritannien och nordirland ' is the full official name , and it may potentially be the most formal if you 're gon na measure them . 
   ... or very casually : `` england '' , but it most cases `` england '' refer to just england proper . 
  that we 're gon na have to agree to disagree on . 
  i concede i used to think that , but since a scottish friend of mine brought it to my attention and i actually paid attention when others spoke , i ca n't say i do anymore . 
  in my experience it 's not only used in '' * very * casual '' settings , and is n't `` mostly referring '' to england . 
  if you mean politics and such refers to england since westminster happens to be in there , then maybe . 
  but to me that argument ca n't be made for national policies and such . 
  of course it 's sometimes difficult to draw the line since in some instances you may not know whether they 're actually talking about england or the uk , but yeah in my experience england is indeed frequently used for the uk . 
  though , scotland is sometimes distinguished from the rest . 
  yeah . 
  and it 's not just unfamiliar , there is none . 
  no such name exist and you could n't say it even if you wanted to . 
  i suppose you theoretically could say the adjective `` united '' followed by the noun `` kingdom '' , but it does n't mean the uk . 
  the formal name here is ` storbritannien ' ( great britain ) , and the colloquial name is just ` england ' . 
  everyone knows what scotland is though , and if we 're specifically talking about that we do say ` skottland ' . 
  i believe the saying `` whatever you can rightly say about india , the opposite is also true '' is pretty accurate . 
  it 's very difficult to accurately talk about ` indian people ' and ` indian culture ' to me as it 's one of the , if not * the * , most diverse countries i know . 
  it 's just too different . 
  it 's a country of contradictions .
