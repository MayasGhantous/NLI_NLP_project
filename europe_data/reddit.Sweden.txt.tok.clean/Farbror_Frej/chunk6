  - after that : christmas dinner , a smorgasbord of stuff . 
  [ christmas ham ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christmas_ham ) , meatballs , [ prince sausage ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prinskorv ) , different types of cabbage , pickled herring , and a bunch of other stuff . 
  also , [ julmust ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/julmust ) . 
  - opening of presents by the christmas tree . 
  everyone 's together , one gift at a time , rhymes , takes hours ... yada yada . 
  - rice pudding as an evening snack . 
  there 's an almond in there and the one who gets it is supposed to marry , have good luck , or some other superstitious thing , i do n't remember . 
  i 'm allergic and do n't really feel like dying ... for reasons . 
  i have had the opportunity , although it 's not very popular here . 
  personally i hope it stays that way , solely out of self-interest ... 
   small differences . 
  yeah , that 's the thing i meant was n't weird . 
  the fact that we do have some minor differences . 
  and i 'd assume there 's probably been some logic behind it , plenty of countries do have it . 
  but i really do n't know why , we do n't . 
  it 's not really weird , is it ? 
  countries are different . 
  judging from google images it seems like the italian driver 's license does n't have the ' 4d ' - field for example , which we do . 
  and i mean , the home adress is n't really required information to print on a driver 's license anyway . 
  name and date of birth are required for identification of the person , photo and signature for verifying said identity , and any information related to the license itself is of course required to immediately see eligibility of said licensee . 
  home/postal address is n't really , is it ? 
  i ca n't think of any reason to have that information readily available upfront . 
  and if anyone would need to send you something , the address can be pulled it from the civil registry . 
  in what scenario would that information be vital to have upfront ? 
  nope . 
  4d ( administrative reference number ) and 8 ( postal adress/residence ) are [ optional fields ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/lexuriserv/lexuriserv.do?uri=oj:l:2006:403:0018:0060:en:pdf#page=12 ) for eu driving licenses . 
  we have 4d , but not 8 . 
  most people use their driving license as their id . 
  there are a several different agencies and banks issuing ids ( mostly for people without driver 's license ) . 
  in general they all look like the one issued by the police , and have the [ same information ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_identity_card_\\ ( sweden \\ ) #printed _ data ) . 
  no addresses . 
  i suppose translations like those are the only thing most people will ever get to use latin for ... maybe ? 
  but still , it does seem like a pretty bad way of learning a language properly . 
  : / we did all kinds of things . 
  from listening to speeches and summarizing them , to holding oral presentations about texts we read . 
  not that it 's been much help to me , i 've probably forgotten most by now anyway ... 
  it 's a pretty difficult language to retain . 
  it 's not really that much harder to learn than any other foreign language . 
  it depends a bit on how different it is from your native language , and some grammar may not have been `` dumbed down '' as much as many other modern european languages , but it 's not really as difficult as you make it out to be . 
  i do n't think it 'd make a good lingua franca since it is `` dead '' after all , and not widely spoken . 
  but it 's nowhere near impossible to learn fluently , even as an adult . 
   how latin is teached today , meaning only translating from latin to the native language , and that only in written form really ? 
  is that how it 's taught in germany ? 
  i took latin , and that 's not at all what we did . 
  there was writing/reading/speaking / listening ; from , to , and only using latin etc. 
  i do think the latin classes i took put an excessive emphasis on grammar rather than `` real usage '' , but that 's been true for all other language studies i 've done too . 
  and there was too much translation to swedish/english ( both to and from ) , rather than using only latin ( which is much more efficient way of learning a language in my experience ) . 
  but yeah , latin is a language like any other , not really that different . 
  in some aspects it 's maybe not `` dumbed down '' as much grammatically , but it 's not like it 's impossible to learn . 
  i do think it 's a bad linga franca though , it is `` dead '' after all . 
  it 's much better to use an already widely spoken language . 
  note that donald duck is really only part of two of the shorts ( +1 cameo ) . 
  the name `` donald duck and his friends wish you a merry christmas '' ( or just `` donald duck '' for short ) is only because he 's the most popular disney character in sweden by far . 
  in reality jiminy cricket would probably make more sense , since he is the one `` hosting '' it . 
  or not singling any character out i suppose , like the english `` from all of us to all of you '' . 
  here in the city , not very . 
  outside the cities it 's more common . 
  around my old summer place it 's very common , virtually every household has rifles . 
  yeah , that is correct . 
  well , it is affected by some other metrics like child mortality etc. , but around 2 to 2.2 is usually the magic number of sustainability for medcs . 
  for sweden it would be pretty close to 2 , which is where we usually are . 
  so , our population would remain * fairly * stable even without immigration . 
  what i meant was that with the existing population being stable any migration directly increases population , rather than restoring and stabilizing it . 
  which also means there 's a low turnover rate and an increased demand for new housing , which is n't being built . 
  i really do n't know why i wrote like that . 
  you are correct . 
  ok , thanks for the link . 
  i just was n't sure . 
  that 's why i said that there '' * may * be some rural flight '' , i thought it was pretty insignificant . 
  it 's got more to do with slow building and bad turnover rates than population growth . 
  but sweden has a fairly stable fertility rate of around 2.0 , so population increase naturally . 
  there may be some rural flight , but not too extreme . 
  as i said we have a building shortages in about 240/290 municipalities , so it 's not just the big cities that have problems . 
  some people will of course blame immigration , but i have n't seen any data that that would be any major issue . 
  it probably has some impact , but i doubt it 's the main contributor . 
  our immigration rates have been a bit overstated in media . 
  the county government in stockholm projected that they need about 16 000 new dwellings per year for the shortage not to worsen , in recent years that number has been about 10 000 . 
  and it 's a pretty big problem all over sweden , not just stockholm . 
  you could write an essay on why our housing are so expensive . 
  lots of politics , slow building , stagnant turnover rates etc. 
  to boil it down , we have a lack on housing in general in sweden . 
  240 out of 290 municipalities now report lacking housing . 
  then add to that the fact that stockholm is the capital , the largest , and most attractive city for businesses which increases competitiveness . 
  in central stockholm the average waiting time for housing stretches upwards to 20 years . 
  yeah , that 's what i meant . 
  ( or maybe you had n't refreshed and seen my ninja-edited post when replying ) . 
  it 's not perfect though since its pronunciation depends on dialects and such . 
  many accents do n't really finish the diphthong with as pronounced y-sound . 
  ( it 's pronounced like i ), 
  also east slavic . 
  originally the name came from the old norse * v\u01fdringi * meaning `` faithful companion '' . 
  which turned into ` varangos ' in byzantine greek , ` varjag ' in east slavic etc. 
  it was ` w\u00e6rgenga ' in old english . 
  the rurik dynasty of the kievan rus ' ( predecessor to russia ) was described as being ' \u0412\u0430\u0440\u044f\u0433\u044a ' * ( varyagu ) * , which would indeed be ` varangian ' in english . 
  the varangian guard of the byzantine army may be the most famous example of `` varangians '' , but the term was used for a lot of `` east-heading norsemen '' . 
  well , i did n't move there under duress . 
  i moved there because i wanted to , so ... 
  i like spain , but there 's lots of it i have n't been to . 
  i lived , and traveled a lot in catalonia and i did see a fair share of valencia and pa\u00eds vasco , but as for the other ca 's i have n't seen much . 
  i 've only seen arag\u00f3n , la rioja , and navarra from bus/train windows , and the rest i have n't seen any of .
