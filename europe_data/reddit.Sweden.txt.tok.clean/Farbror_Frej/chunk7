  the summers are tough on me , but that 's really a surprise ( i lived in malta prior ) , the sun 's too strong for me . 
  the spanish people i got to know are great . 
  i do n't really know what to say , i love spain . 
  maybe i 'll move back sometime , but for now i 'm doing uni here in sweden . 
  no , i mean taking the train to copenhagen airport , going through luggage check-in and security , flying across that atlantic ocean to newark , standing five hours in line at border control so they could take my fingerprints and make sure my esta was valid , having to take a new plane because the booked one left while i stood in line , flying to cincinnati/northern kentucky , locating the luggage that had taken a detour , and then riding in a car for three hours before really being able to say : `` hey , i 'm in the us ! '' . 
  reddit may be pretty us-centric for the most part , but it sure as hell is n't `` visiting the us '' . 
  that 's a fucking ridiculous notion . 
  what i mean is `` visited the united states of america '' . 
  no , not anymore . 
  i moved back to sweden last year . 
  on this subreddit they 're flags , yes . 
  on / r/soccer or / r/hockey they 're team logos etc. 
  `` flair '' is the general term . 
  [ a `` flair '' next to you username , ] ( http://i.imgur.com/j2zzt87.png ) on this subreddit they 're flags so others can see which country you 're from . 
  if you 're on a computer you can set one in the sidebar . 
  which country is it ? 
  spain ? 
  you do n't seem to have a flair . 
  no need to apologize . 
  it 's not even that rude , just innocent puns . 
  and i 'd rather have overused puns than genuine belief in derogatory stereotypes any day . 
  most spanish-speaking swedes would probably find it funny too . 
  the reason i do n't probably has more to do with hearing it so frequently living in spain , it 's outlived its jocosity for me . 
  my experience in spanish speaking countries : - `` oh , you 're a clog ? '', 
  * with a super smug face because they just made the most original joke ever * ( sueco \u2260 zueco ) - `` hey , do n't play dumb ! '', 
  * with an equally smug face * ( to do a swede = to play dumb in spanish ) - or something about switzerland of course , since ` suecia ' and ` suiza ' are pretty similar . 
  more so than english . 
  i have gotten that a few times , but normally it 's been about being gay vikings surrounded by blonde bombshells . 
  when i visited the us last , there was a toss-up between : `` you mean the european caliphate cesspool with rampant jihadists raping blonde bombshells ? 
  '' , and `` oh , the socialist utopia without any problems whatsoever ? '' ... 
  have n't gotten that elsewhere though . 
  i do n't know how anyone would go about finding a source on that . 
  the first time i heard it myself was prior to solberg debuting , so ... 
  i 'd assume it 's as old as the first scandinavian to learn english . 
  at least the first since `` speeding kills '' was being discussed . 
   does n't `` rea '' translate to the danish `` udsalg '' it does , as in `` for sale at reduced prices '' . 
  it 's just a pun since korea and korea are the same . 
  a ` sale on cows ' would n't have to be in korea , but otherwise there would n't be a reference for the pun . 
   google translate says both `` rea '' is both `` salg '' and `` udsalg '' it is n't really . 
  this is probably caused by google 's `` through english '' - translation , where it first translates into `` sale '' , which means both . 
  it 's really quite difficult to `` just speak swedish ! '', 
  when all you do everyday is interact with norwegians . 
  i have a friend who 's lived in norway for ~ ten years . 
  i remember once when we were out , some norwegians criticized him for being `` one of those ` wannabe norwegian ' - swedes '' because of how he spoke . 
  the thing is , he 's not trying to imitate norwegian . 
  that 's just how he speaks . 
  even when he 's surrounded by swedes , in sweden , without having interacted with a norwegian for months , that is how he speaks . 
  that weird norwegian with a swedish accent you talk about . 
  the language just rub off after enough exposure for a long time and as you say , that little thing that makes it sound weird has a way of sticking around , which may cause it to sound fake . 
  i mean he 's really struggling with finding the swedish words nowadays . 
  i 've overheard him trying to get a mutual friend to understand what a trillekoffert ( or whatever it was ) was , as he could n't find the swedish word . 
  which has been genuinely difficult for him to deal with psychologically . 
  he 's too swedish for norway , but has become too norwegian for sweden . 
  so yeah ... all i 'm saying is that it 's not always intentional . 
  give people the benefit of the doubt . 
  some people do n't do it for fun , and it 's really quite difficult to keep speaking swedish when all you do is interact with norwegians . 
  the same is true in reverse for norwegians in sweden . 
  if you do n't believe me you could always cut ties with everyone you know in norway , move here for ten years , and then listen to yourself . 
  you will not sound the same , i guarantee you . 
  ** tl ; dr : ** sorry for the rant , but please do n't judge people just because they 're `` swedes trying to speak norwegian '' , or vice versa . 
  `` just speaking swedish '' is n't as easy as it sounds for someone living in norway . 
   swedish tourists in my city which is surprising it 's not surprising !, 
  poland is a beautiful country with lots of great people !, 
  well ... 
  i 've personally only ever been to gdynia and gda\u0144sk , but at least those places are nice !, 
  and i 'm imagining the rest is too . 
    quite common to take some `` unusual '' language classes we do to , i took latin myself . 
  then i promptly forgot all about it . 
  it 's apparently pretty difficult to find opportunities to utilize a dead language , who 'd have thought ? 
   recommend me something over the internet ? 
  well , i 'm not / u/frikoz . 
  but if you have n't already , i suppose you could check : * [ sr ] ( http://sverigesradio.se/sida/allakanaler.aspx ) , the public radio broadcaster . 
  but i do n't know if it 's available abroad . 
  p1 is talk-only with news , culture , documentaries etc. 
  the others have more music , with some talk in-between songs . 
  * [ svt ] ( http://www.svtplay.se/ ) , the public tv broadcaster . 
  they have a bit of everything . 
  some shows are a bit hit and miss , but i 've seen some nice documentaries etc. 
  on there . 
  and considering there 's a `` kan ses utomlands '' - checkbox , i assume some can be seen in poland . 
  they also run [ \u00d6ppet arkiv ] ( http://www.oppetarkiv.se/ ) with old stuff , but i do n't know it 's availability abroad . 
  i ca n't help with much else since i do n't browse the `` swedish internet '' very much , also i really do n't know what 's region blocked , and what is n't . 
  and i really do n't know about good newspapers , i find most of them too tabloidy and clickbaity , or biased . 
  haha , i did n't expect any poetry !, 
   i studied latin as a foreign language at uni and i 'd be able to say jack shit in it know . 
  what you wrote is a comprehensible sentence . 
  yeah , that 's my impression too . 
  and i ca n't think of any of my acquaintances who prays or goes to church/mosque/synagogue / whatever , but i 'd also only need one hand to count the ones that call themselves atheist . 
  people do n't really care , religion 's pretty insignificant . 
  0 in cash . 
  i only carry my cards . 
  i also have my phone if i ever need to send someone money . 
  i 've heard that swish is used some extent , but i do n't know . 
  it 's not my thing either . 
  yeah , i carry nothing but that plastic card . 
  i mean there 's no point , at my local arena you ca n't even buy a hotdog with cash . 
  card only . 
  i do n't know what the metric for `` large amounts of content '' is , so maybe i do n't fit into that category . 
  but anyway , the reason i initially started browsing the `` english web '' many years ago was to practice ( and also `` preserve '' ) english . 
  in real life i had little access to interactions with english .
