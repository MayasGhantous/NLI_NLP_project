  and you do n't really learn regular colloquial language from textbooks and , while there 's certainly internet specific lingo to account for , forums are a great place for that when you do n't have anyone else . 
  and if you do n't keep up with a language you will forget and lose fluency * quickly * , surprisingly quickly . 
  i noticed that with the german i once could hold a basic conversation in . 
  you 're talking to a guy whose local cathedral is made of bright orange plaster and a copper roof ... 
  although it does have a 1000 + years old [ runestone ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xoqmdjd.jpg ) talking about vikings , so that 's something i guess . 
   sheffield just stuck a new bit on the end of the old church and that now counts as a cathedral . 
  but being a cathedral has nothing to do with the building itself , it could 've looked exactly the same . 
  all it means is that it 's the central church of a diocese or episcopate . 
  or is that different in the uk ? 
  does a cathedral need to have two towers/spires or something ? 
  also , ( and i 'm aware it may just be a typo , but incase you did n't know ) it 's spelled `` jordgu ** bb ** ssylt '' . 
  two b 's . 
   you swedes really do n't like us danes having somethings that you do n't , huh ? 
   has nothing to do with that . 
  ^ ( ( do n't tell anyone , but i actually like denmark . 
  if i did n't i would n't have studied danish ... ) ^ ) what i do n't like are theories presented as fact . 
  that is how it was drawn . 
  and as a symbol of denmark it has been in use from before 1748 . 
  it is depicted on many paintings older than 1748 . 
  i know that it was drawn like that , there are no surviving fabrics . 
  but if you do n't count the drawings , it 's not nearly as old . 
  and yes it was depicted in paintings earlier than that law , but so were the centered versions , and until that stipulation there was no legal backing for said design . 
  that 's all i 'm saying . 
  but none of this changes the fact that it is not proven or even known whether it 's the oldest flag or not . 
  if you want to talk about having something we swedes do n't , there 's actually no proof you had the scandinavian cross ( offset vertical bar ) before us . 
  so ...    allegedly  but most likely i do n't know which of my `` allegedly '' your talking about here . 
  but , yes , many are very likely . 
  but as i said , i do n't like presenting theories as fact . 
   can all be traced back to gorm the old magnus den gode ca n't , can he ? 
  and being traced ... sure , if you count someone who 's the son of the biological , but not adopted , sister of man who * was * adopted into the lineage . 
  then again , we are talking about european monarchies ... a claim is a claim , i guess . 
  but yes , your royal family is old . 
  i 'm not denying that . 
   ^ ^ edit : ^ ^ phrasing, 
   we have the oldest uninterrupted monarchy in the world . 
  \\* europe . 
  look at japan etc. 
  also , it depends on definitions and an `` allegedly '' should really be put in there . 
  for example there 's no agreed upon definition of when the `` monarchy of sweden '' formed . 
   denmark is the home place of germanic culture . 
  * allegedly * . 
  there 's no definitive proof , and basing it on oldest accounts is a deductive fallacy . 
  it 's likely , but not proven . 
  nor is it unanimously agreed upon by historians . 
   dannebrog is the oldest national flag still in use . 
  this is also only alleged and it depends on definitions . 
  it looked like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/a86ccnh.png ) in the beginning , is that the still to be considered the same flag ? 
  and there are designs for other flags that can be traced further but has n't necessarily been in contiguous use , like the swiss or austrian flags . 
  the oldest legal stipulation for the modern dannebrog ( with scandi-cross and all that ) came for merchant ships in 1748 . 
  there are a few flags still in use older than that . 
   str\u00f8get in copenhagen is the oldest pedestrian street in the world . 
  i personally do n't know anything about that one . 
  but if wikipedia is to be trusted : `` str\u00f8get was converted to a pedestrian zone on 17 november 1962 when cars were beginning to dominate copenhagen 's old central streets . 
  * inspired by a number of new pedestrian streets * created in germany after the war '',

  it may have given it a small boost , but elsa was already very popular .

  for reference , the movie was released in 2014 in sweden ( nov. 2013 in the us ) .

  yeah , i know , i meant it more from a ` mentality of the swedish language ' stand-point . 
  swedish has n't really held fast to that mentality ever , especially not today . 
  the language council is pretty quick to adapt and not afraid to add load words . 
  and we do n't even localize names in translation anymore . 
  we used to , that 's why ` huey , dewey , louie ' = ` knatte , fnatte , tjatte ' etc. , but not anymore . 
  even if no one knew how `` dumbledore '' was supposed to be pronounced , it stayed as ` dumbledore ' in the swedish translation . 
  depends on the compound and its context . 
  usually you can understand what 's meant based on context , maybe you 'll have to do a double take and it breaks your flow or such . 
  on occasion they do however lead to complete misunderstandings . 
  it 's difficult to give accurate examples in english as it does n't work the same way , but if i were to act like a crazy person and say :  `` i ate a luke warm take out cheese burger and some home made pepper mint cheese cake while watching an up loaded broad cast of a foot ball game on sun day after noon last week end '' and  `` i ate a lukewarm takeout cheeseburger and some homemade peppermint cheesecake while watching an uploaded broadcast of a football game on sunday afternoon last weekend . '', 
  you probably found the latter a bit easier to read . 
  and then there is n't even anything really ambiguous and message changing . 
  now , this example is n't entirely accurate of how it is in swedish , but as a thought experiment of how it can impede legibility , it might work ? 
  ** tl ; dr : ** it depends on the compound and context . 
  usually you 'd understand , even if the reading flow is impeded . 
  sometimes it does cause misunderstandings . 
  ^ ^ edit : ^ ^ spelling, 
  yes , they 're essential . 
  they function just like in most other germanic languages ( with the exception of english ) . 
  and they 're quite important . 
  it 's the difference between saying ` smoke-free ( area ) ' and ` smoke freely ' , or ` physiotherapist ' and ` sick gymnast ' etc. 
  not really , people do n't communicate using english here . 
  everyone knows it , but it 's not like we speak it to each other . 
  and we 've always had loan words . 
  it used to come mostly from french , now it 's more english . 
  not really an issue . 
  it 's not often english loan words end up substituting preexisting words , they 're mostly used for new concepts . 
  and why would you make up new words , when a perfectly fine one already exist . 
  the biggest issue english is causing swedish is making 's \u00e4rskrivning ' more widespread . 
  that is when you write compounds as separate ( i.e. 
  highlight \u2260 high light ) . 
  in english most words are written as separate so it 's not really a major issue , in swedish and most other germanic languages it 's worse and it can often change the meaning . 
  ^ edit : ^ phrasing, 
  i was taught the urals , caspian sea , caucasus , black sea , and turkish straits . 
  how have the history of those old laws looked ? 
  have they been regional laws since then or something ? 
  did n't iceland get its first constitution in 1874 or something like that ? 
  i agree .
