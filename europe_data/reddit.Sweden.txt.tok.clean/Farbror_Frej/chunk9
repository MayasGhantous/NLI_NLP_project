  but it 's all very subjective what laws should and should n't be . 
  i just posted some that i personally known people having issues with . 
  some people i 've met think that prohibiting free choice in naming is a sign of an totalitarian government . 
  i remember a few years ago there was a news story here where parents had gotten their daughters ` metallica ' proposal rejected . 
  it seems like 29 people in the registry are called that today though , so i do n't know what happened . 
  yeah , i probably should have made that clearer . 
  it 'd be pretty bad if you actually had to pick them up infront of people . 
  you also get some sent home . 
  if you do n't want to use those , it depends on the voting place . 
  but in general , yes , they are in the open . 
  * however * , there 's no limit to just grab just one there , you could take one for every single party if you 'd so like . 
  or a blank one and write your party . 
  the actual ` putting ballot into envelope ' and any potential writing is done in a booth behind a screen . 
  some laws are timeless you know . 
  you ca n't just have people go around releasing their swine into other 's acorn woods all willy-nilly . 
  our ballots look like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gnsnxlu.jpg ) . 
  they 're for the individual parties with the party name up top , and a list of candidates beneath where you can optionally mark . 
  there are also blank ones you can write on if you 're voting for a smaller party , or your own candidate . 
  yellow 's for parliament , blue for the county council , and white for municipality . 
  then you just [ pick up ] ( http://i.imgur.com/totfdjm.jpg ) the three you want and put them into envelopes . 
  pretty subjective i suppose . 
  some things that are different in some other countries : * we have pretty strict laws against drug use . 
  * prostitution : legal to sell , illegal to buy . 
  * we have restrictions in place for naming babies weird names . 
  * we have pretty strict laws on the requirement of building permits , that include painting your house in a new color etc. 
  * alcohol is only for sale to people over 18 in bars/restaurants , but 20 for the closed containers in stores ( except for those classified as having a low alcohol content ) then we have some remnants of weird old laws . 
  for example there 's an infamous one from 1736 about limiting your rights to release pigs in acorn woods . 
  not really enforced though , i think , i have however never released any pigs into the woods . 
  they do , every jail and prison has its own clinic . 
  emergency dentistry should also be given if required . 
  do n't know what happened in this case . 
  he claims to have reported it to the staff , but multiple days passed without anything happening . 
  but i ca n't find much details about it . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/rymde-fran-anstalt-for-att-ga-till-tandlakaren/ ) is the most comprehensive article i could find in swedish , and it does n't say that much either . 
  in my neighborhood , mostly swedish ( mainly a southern sm\u00e5land dialect , but also some others ) . 
  fair amount of arabic , and some occasional spanish , bosnian , and polish . 
  our holiday home was surrounded by danes . 
  so there it was mostly danish , with some scanian swedish . 
  i went to an international school , so in my class arabic , somali , swahili , persian , urdu , german , norwegian ( and svorsk ) , english , amharic , spanish , serbo-croatian ( mainly bosnian ) , lithuanian , and polish were all used on a daily basis . 
  on occasion also some greenlandic , korean , chinese ( mandarin ) , vietnamese , portuguese , and finnish , but that was n't everyday . 
  i 'd also overhear some other odd languages in school , but i 'm not sure what they were . 
  not a tourist hotspot , so i did n't get to overhear any other foreign languages . 
  yeah , i meant kindergarten by the broader colloquial meaning , preschool/nursery school essentially . 
  sounds pretty similar to here . 
  well , not that junior infant stuff ( we do n't have any compulsory schooling until you 're 6 or 7 ) , but montessori preschools being popular . 
  but you do n't have any montessori primary schools ? 
  do you call all kindergartens `` montessori '' , or are n't there any non-montessori ones ? 
  here ` montessori ' specifically refers to the montessori approach to education and exists both for preschool and primary school . 
  * primary school , `` grundskola '' . 
  year ( 0 ) ,1 -9 . 
  `` year 0 '' is optional , but most people do it to my knowledge . 
  1-9 are mandatory . 
  some schools do all years , another common split is to have different schools for 0-6 and 7-9 . 
  * upper secondary school , `` gymnasium '' . 
  optional , but virtually everyone does it . 
  three years , called 1-3 . 
  this is also secondary education , but only available for 18 + year olds . 
  it 's an alternative , or addition , to the gymnasium . 
  puts you into a different university application quotient , which can help . 
  functions a bit differently from regular secondary education . 
  you generally do n't have any tests and you wo n't receive grades in each subject . 
  rather you receive an overall grade in `` studying capacity '' for all subjects . 
  i did it for a year , thought it was great . 
  * university , `` universitet '' / `` h\u00f6gskola '' . 
  free for all eu/eea-citizens . 
  everyone with the prerequisite education can get in . 
  granted , there 's an application process so you may not get into the highly competitive programmes . 
  all are free . 
  at each level are you 're eligible for some kind of social security payment . 
  child benefits in primary school , and student benefits in upper secondary school . 
  student grants from the ministry of education from 18 + , they also offer the possibility of extra money through low interest student loans ^ ^ edit : ^ ^ grammar, 
  prices at my local supermarket at the moment : - ica ( their own store brand ) i \u2665 eco 175g : 16,95 sek ( 1,70 $ ) - ica ( their own store brand ) regular 300g : 18 sek ( 1,81 $ ) - lay 's salted 175g : 18,95 sek ( 1,90 $ ) - estrella 275g : 18,95 sek ( 1,90 $ ) - olw 40g : 6,95 sek ( 0,70 $ ) - olw 275g : 20,75 sek ( 2,08 $ ) - svenska lantchips 200g : 19,95 sek ( 2 $ ) - pringles original 190g : 19,95 sek ( 2 $ ), 
  i 'm swedish , did n't have any gcse stuff . 
  and i do n't now that this `` red anthology '' is . 
  if you are for some strange unknown reason interested , our text books came from cambridge university press . 
  for literature we did n't have * a * nicely organized anthology . 
  closer to 50 different , with only a single piece we 'd use in each ... dragging all of them around was pretty good for keeping in shape though ... 
  granted , many may think it 's just some weird archaic english and not a scots rabbie burns poem , but y' know ... 
  some of us even analysed scots poetry in english class . 
  it 's pretty straight forward for sweden . 
  the noun describing people is * ` swede ' * ( note that with a minuscule 's ' it 's a turnip ) . 
  the official language here is * swedish * . 
  the adjective 's the same , * swedish * . 
  yeah , i know the theory . 
  that is how it 's * suposed * to work . 
  but the fact that it 's not black-on-white means it ends up being quite ambiguous . 
  which is pretty much my point , it ends up being inconsistent . 
  even ` freudian ' ( which is a bad example , but i 'm rolling with it ) can be used for things `` relating to subconscious desires '' and such . 
  granted , it is the same field as freud is famous for , but not necessarily having anything to do with him nor his research . 
  so where is the line drawn ? 
  or ` byzantine ' . 
  should it always be capitalized , or never ? 
  or should it be capitalized when talking about things pertaining to byzantium and not when talking about something complicated ? 
  that 's what i find pretty unique , and peculiar about english . 
  it 's not an issue in most languages . 
  actually , there 's barely any other language that capitalize adjectives whatsoever , regardless of where they 're derived from . 
  i got it . 
  interesting . 
  i 've never actually tried reading portuguese before , it 's surprisingly comprehensive . 
  compared to spanish , it feels a bit like swedish with danish .
