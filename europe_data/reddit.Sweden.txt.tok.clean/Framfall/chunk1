cant answer for the rest of the countries but my anecdotal experience in sweden are immigrants from russia are chechen or other minorities ( that often do not get asylum ) and roma coming from serbia . 
  [ oh you want more ? 
  this in on one of their demonstrations . 
  ] ( http://skola.expo.se/images/tl_sd_07_1994.jpg ) you racist apologist will never quit . 
  the difference is that one is joke in bad taste and the other is a genuine opinion . 
  [ this ] ( http://skola.expo.se/images/tl_sd_09_1996.jpg ) was how one of the members looked in the 90s while their current leader joined the party . 
  and [ this ] ( https://cdn3.cdnme.se/cdn/6-1/841033/images/2010/sverigedemokraterna_108503051.jpg ) was the posters during the same time . 
  on the bottom it says :  varning !, 
   to swedish girls !, 
   avoid unprotected sex with negros that carries the deadly aids virus !, 
  preferably : do not dishonour your race , your sweden , your family and relatives . 
  yeah , they 're just a bit center right . 
  the were communists historically but now socialist/social democratic . 
  what facts are twisted and how does it work ? 
  to me this is a fair representation although tongue in cheek . 
  ah , so that is what tevez is doing on his time off during the wc . 
  good for you , keeping yourself busy and organizing a human trafficking ring in north africa . 
  interesting to compare the forecast to reality . 
  it shows that sweden came in 7th place 2009 and in the latest in 2013 , in 8th place . 
  there is a reason why the page on forecast for hdi are deleted from wikipedia . 
  well the result i 've seen from that culture when i visit friends and family from southern/eastern europe is that 26 year old still lives at home and puts every bit of money on a car that is too expensive for them while wearing fake designer clothes . 
  on the other hand , the same bragging culture exist in sweden only that people brags about how healthy they are , how well they raises their children , how much they work out and how politically aware they are . 
  we have more of an social media facade than an street facade . 
  i get about $ 1000 each month but i think the cost of living is a bit higher here . 
  maybe its because i have cheap rent but for me thats enough and beyond . 
   the casualty figures for the whole of yugoslavia sways between the maximum 1,700,000 and the more conservative figures between 1,500,000 . 
  [ 99 ] or one million . 
   they should be honest and just admit that the reason why he was fined is simply because they disallow `` hate speech '' , whether his sayings are backed by fact or not . 
  the court commented on the report that hess submitted and they nullified it . 
  they wrote that the one single paper is not solid evidence of a commonly admitted truth of any form . 
  but the far-right page that ops link sources failed to include that for some reason . 
  no , he did not . 
  he submitted what he claims to be proof but was nullified by the [ court ] ( http://www.expressen.se/kvallsposten/sd-politiker-i-ratten-for-hets-mot-folkgrupp/ ) . 
   does this law apply to radical muslims who do hate speech towards other minorities too ? 
  yes of course , [ one example ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ahmed_rami_\\ ( writer \\ ) ), 
  this is what you initially wrote :  this means in practice that a ** russian guy ** can come up to me '' pretty singular ? 
  my initial point is that your example when you discredit russians in front of a russian is false and would not be included in the law against hate speech . 
  that is backed up by the example when a 16 year old was acquitted for doing a hitler salute . 
  a insult of miscredit aimed towards a small group of russians or one single isnt enough to be included , at least according to the the professional lawyers of the court but you probably know better right ? 
  if you just took this as an adult you could 've admitted that your example is wrong and this could have taken about 1 minute instead . 
   if you can read you can clearly see that wikipedia say they 're connected to the arab/kurdish culture . 
  no , one of the sources claims that . 
  here is a source that says its a culture spread all over the world : [ source ] ( http://www.unl.edu/rhames/courses/212/readings/honor-kil-ng.pdf ) now you got your sources , fine scholar . 
   it could be but you 're assuming things ( in my case no it was n't private ) no you clearly wrote russian and not russians . 
  so in your scenario it was you and one other russian . 
  you have to target a greater group and do it on a public forum aiming to reach to a lot of people . 
  tired of people trying to discredit a law they even do n't fully understand . 
  i have n't argued that the honour killings does n't exist , so no need to show me anymore wiki pages . 
  i discussing the reason for it , countless regions all over the world greatly oppresses females and have done long before islam and span all over the world . 
  you are not stating your point and what you agues for . 
  the article quotes are just historic statements . 
  how is that not a private discussion ? 
  and if you say it to one specific person it is not included in the law , even if you are out in the public . 
  you must aim it to a group that you slander and not just a single person . 
   perhaps but why should we care about your opinion ? 
  if you want to dispute the grounds your best bet is facts . 
  saying it 's your opinion does n't make it true , and it does n't prove it either . 
  wikipedia is a good first step . 
  [ 1 ] oh a link to the wiki-page of what honor killings is ? 
  so for my feebly functioning mind , maybe can get the slightest grasp of the term and get back in the game again with the great thinker and scholar that is yourself ? 
  a greatly tipped fedora my dear sir . 
   they 're way more prevalent in certain regions and religions . 
  they are more prevalent in undeveloped countries and regions , yes . 
  but what is your point ? 
  let me guess : its the muslims and arabs !, 
  no , because you said `` asshat '' to a russian in a private discussion and therefore it does not qualify as hate speech . 
  the problem here is archaic/obsolete behaviors that are not specific to any regions or religions . 
  this `` honor killing '' is going on in albania , kurdistan and india and are in my opinion a result of female oppression . 
  not really . 
  `` asshat '' would hardly count as hate speech and when people get convicted its usually on good grounds . 
  saying that muslims have a deeply rooted culture of raping non-believers is n't anywhere near `` asshat '' . 
  but are n't you only focusing on dishes and where they 're originated from ? 
  traditional cooking is n't all food culture . 
  ah , another one that only visited stockholm . 
  there are scandinavian restaurants all around the world . 
  modern scandinavian cooking is very much popular and highly regarded around the world . 
  just look at the bocuse dor winners , only scandinavians and french for almost 25 years . 
  that was n't a border guard . 
  that was the migrant reception centre , they were already on spanish soil . 
  its not considered a aphrodisiac , that 's an old myth . 
  well you did say  it 's like calling for trouble that is like saying she called for the rape by getting lost . 
  the sick part that i think everybody should focus on is that people still rape and not that people gets lost or makes common mistakes . 
  of course its foolish to just walk about thinking you are completely safe in a poor country but i was just puling your leg about the `` armed security '' part , which is a little over the top in my books . 
  if you are careful in india , you are perfectly safe and wont need an army with you . 
  or when we talk about a rape we can instead focus on the fact that people still do that to other people . 
  instead of focusing on the victim and laying blame there . 
  are you really serious ? 
  negative , this is alpha eagle requesting armed security or ap/at back-up asap regarding a freedom convoy in brown country . 
  engage in all hostile activity . 
  the really 90s seems to be the heyday of german music . 
  but if you listen to industrial music or ( minimal ) techno , germany is the place to be . 
  also : dont forget that boney m are german . 
  do the spanish royalties have legal immunity ? 
  you said  2008 was a year with way fewer immigrants than most other years i showed that 2008 was a year with less immigrants than usual . 
  you want more examples ? 
  lebanon : 39 % syria : 10 % jordan : 6 % there is a lot of christians in the middle east and they are accepted are an integrated part of society . 
  no , my number are in general . 
  in 2008 we had 90k new citizens , 2009 98k , 2010 91k , 2011 93k and 2012 111k . 
  so in reality less than 100k in the last few years and 2008 was not a year with fever immigrants . 
  if you look at the refugee quota , 2008 has the highest number since 1980 .
