no , we do n't , only the gain . 
  we need them to have someone to play bandy with , since the finns are as good as us yet . 
  it 's too bad that mikael odenberg resigned , he would have been a great minister for defence . 
  meh , not really . 
  he is well known to the world , but in sweden he is known as a diplomat , not politician . 
  he was the secretery to our fm but then he went to the un . 
  he was never our prime minister . 
  the riksdag does not decide what countries to recognise , that is done by the government . 
  august-early september or june , we hav our vacations in july . 
  so was it king sigismund ? 
  the shield in the middle with the crowns and lions is swedish , but the rest seem austrian . 
  well , considering that sweden was a part of a union with denmark at the time , i 'm not sure that it counts . 
  if the ukrainian people wants to join the eu , i do n't think that we should let putin stop for some imperialist reason . 
  well , if the same situation would have occured today , \u00c5lan would have become swedish , consiedring that at elast 90 % of the population wanted it . 
  [ english wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%85land_crisis ) [ swedish wiki ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%85landsfr%c3%a5gan ) with source for the 90 % . 
  mas could either proclaim a unilateral indepenence or he could dissolve the parliament and have an election which would become like a referendum , so that if ciu and erc wins , it would mean that the people wants independence , and mas would proclaim that . 
  the date 9/11 has been out for ages . 
  yes , the states pays for it . 
  when it comes to food , buying european seems way better the something from the rest of the world , as long as it 's not danish . 
  in current polls they get somewhere inbetween 2-3 % , and they would need 4 % , and the elections are this sunday so , not realisticly . 
  also , the finnish independence day is 6th of december , exactly 6 months from the swedish one . 
  the weird thing is that such a law exist in sweden . 
  the lack of data is really weird . 
  you 're on the internet man , this is where you find all the anti-immigration people . 
  a recent studie shows that a majority want to keep the current immigration levels or increase them even further . 
  [ source in swedish ] ( http://www.dn.se/valet-2014/majoritet-for-att-ta-emot-flyktingar/ ), 
  it 's not a lot if you compare to turkey , jordania and libanon , it 's just that the rest of europe practically do n't accept any . 
  no , the budget wo n't be slashed , it 's just that there wo n't be a surplus to spend . 
  [ real kebnekaise ] ( http://dynafitsverige.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/dsc03367-kopia.jpg ), 
  most people who regulary hike will do kebnekaise 's south summit , which is the highest . 
  however , that peak is the only one in sweden with a top glacier , and it 's shrinking with the temperature increase . 
  so in a few year , the north peak , which is harder to get to , will become taller than the south one , which will make summiting a bit less common . 
  might want to nsfw-tag this . 
  serbia is not part of eu , so no , germany did n't break anything . 
  our king is doing way better than [ that ] ( http://cdn02.nyheter24.se/259fe15a0802021d01/old/2011/5/16/sxd40cf5.jpg ), 
  but that 's not eu being undemocratic . 
  complain about how france and the netherlands handled the referendas instead . 
  well , they have been going for quite a while by now . 
  the swdish state rarly compansates victims , and when we do , it 's not a lot of money . 
  there 's a beleif in sweden that the state always does the right thing , even though it 's clearly wrong . 
  i think that we got rid of the ghettos , but i 'm not sure . 
  in know for a fact though that everything was n't handled correctly , but i apologies have been made . 
  r\u00f6sti , from switzerland . 
  an alround grat way to serve potato . 
  nothing i can do really . 
  in swedish , use google translate or something . 
  please tell your government to pay the un membership fee . 
  * edit why ca n't organisations have the same name in all languages ? 
  the thing is that spain ca n't really do that . 
  there are only two highways leading out of the iberian peninsula , one of them through catalunya , and the other one through basquia , which also has a strong independence movement . 
  so if madrid stpos all trade , catalunya will do the same . 
  if basquia then leaves spain as well and closes it 's borders for spanish goods , spain would be in a really bad situation . 
  the only reason why the greek economy was as big as it were was because the greek state was paying its expenses with loaned money , so much of the growth was not sustainable . 
  well , i do n't really care about the negotiations , when they 're done they 're done and all the parliaments will get to vote on it . 
  there does n't need to be any substance or transparancy yet . 
  because if the other negotiating part knows what we wanty out of the deal and know what compromises we are willing to make , their position will be strenghten and we will get a worse deal , which is n't in the interest of the people .

  swedish coop 's system is ownership , so i would assume it 's the same in denmark c, 
  for anyone wondering , [ this ] ( http://kan-elin.blogspot.se/2011/09/i-lingonskogen.html ) is how pretty much all of finland and sweden looks like . 
  less than 400 years is not a lot compared to europe . 
  i can almost count the people using my surname with my fingers . 
  even if they did n't become a state , they would still be under american rule . 
  it 's great . 
  i have no clue it also seem slike google has n't updated streetview in the area since , so you can check out the rest [ here  ( https://www.google.se/maps/@59.3437119,18.0700668,3a,75y,269.8h,89.44t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sdzvqwccjim3rdas37rzgkq!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1 ),

  except that the nobel peace prize is norweigan . 
  do n't blame of , we just take care of the science part of it . 
  well , except that our central bank only started qe after ecb did it , to not increase private debt . 
  however , when ecb did it , riksbanken had to do it as well to keep the currency value down to keep the import prices up . 
  if we were in the euro , they would n't have to be so aggresive . 
  on export prices : they can fix it for some time , but after two years most have had to renew their deals , and then they are stuck with bad deals when the currency cheapend . 
  as you can see in [ this graph ] ( http://www.xe.com/sv/currencycharts/?from=eur&amp;to=sek&amp;view=10y ) , our currency had a very high value around 2012 . 
  as an export heavy nation , this caused our companies to lose money which caused us to have a higher unemployment . 
  if we are in the euro zone , we would have a fixed rate towards our biggest markets , which would make our economy more stable . 
  but they would n't stop sweden from joining . 
  during the 80s , after years of economic issues , our politicians promised to never again devalue our currency , since had n't helped at all and only caused high inflation . 
  they have kept that promise , and today , it would be political suicide to mention devaluation . 
  if we want to strengthen our economical situation , our politicians have to do reforms that actually changes things , and not use the quick fix that only works for a while . 
  i believe that to be false since we had issues with a high valued currency after the crisis , since that made our goods more expensive in the euro zone , which is one of our main markets . 
  we also have a bigger trade surplus than germany , so i believe that we would gain from having the euro . 
  well , i would like to join the euro , but the rest of the country do n't agree with me . 
   the european union no member , no glory, 
  japan ? 
  doing well economically ? 
  that has n't been the case since the 80s . 
  hitler was actually a fan of islam , as he believed that the religion was more in line with the nazist ideology compared to christianty , which he saw as weak and hindering .

  uk is not a relevant comparison , because schengen would n't remove it 's borders with the rest of europe . 
  i have written som music as well as poetry in both swedish and english , and i much prefer doing it in swedish . 
  words are more modular , since different words can be combined to new ones , there are no articles that has to be used , and it 's easy to change the grammatical former of a word , since we use different endings of words for that . 
  well , you ca n't really compare the swedish unions to those of others countries . 
  we have had rules regulating strikes and lock-outs since 1938 through the treaty of saltsj\u00f6baden . 
  because of this sweden does n't have that many strikes , and those that happen are rather short and not very serious . 
  the unions and the employer organisations have good realtions . 
  link to one of the unions information site on the topic : http://likeaswede.se/index_eng.html, 
  check out the french casualties . 
  well , the same thing can be said for many cities in sweden , since many smaller cities are only alive during summer and the bigger ones are built around an industry . 
  i would n't recommend going to for example v\u00e4ster\u00e5s , just because it 's a bigger town . 
  karlskrona has enough historical attractions to be worth a visit .
