how is it racist in any way ? 
  good neighbors . 
   sweden was a colonial power of sorts in both finland and norway . 
  this is n't true . 
  what we now know as finland was sweden , and sweden was finland , we were one . 
  it was n't ruled over by sweden , it was part of the sweden proper . 
  it was as integral of a part of sweden as sm\u00e5land , in fact it was probably more important since sm\u00e5land was just a bunch of farmers wanting the king 's head . 
  many of the provinces on the eastern side of the baltic was more important than several on the west . 
  it 's not really accurate , but i can see the claim that sweden ruled over estonia and livonia `` sort of as a colonial power '' , but in no way finland . 
  and sweden and norway did have the same king and foreign policy , but not any type of colonialism i 've ever heard of . 
  two peas in a pod . 
  the cock and the balls . 
  we 're really not much different . 
  we 've been the same country longer than we 've been apart . 
  we wait for the bus in [ exactly the same manner ] ( http://i.imgur.com/g2dqgr5.jpg ) . 
  every index and comparison is going to have its flaws , and there are several reasons to include it despite its flaws . 
  and for the sake of the us , it does actually have a positive value `` gni/cap minus hdi rank '' , unlike nations like qatar or brunei . 
  but yes , what you 're saying is very true . 
  every index has its flaws . 
  the hdi is based on life expectancy , education , and gni per capita . 
  qatar lacks in the first two categories compared to similarly ranked nations , but averages a very highly in the last . 
  the hdi caps gni per capita , lowering qatar 's value by a lot , but it 's still enough to pull the nation 's ranking up . 
  the colors on the map are arbitrary . 
  for the report 's defined categories bulgaria is the only eu country not considered to have * very high human development * . 
  it 's in the * high human development * - category .

  -- ^ ( edit : added more countries . 
  please let me know if i missed something . ), 
  denmark had a pretty standard bicameral parliament , but not * exactly * the same as the uk . 
  there was an upper house of fancy fucks and a lower house for the regular folk . 
  sweden did too until 1971 . 
  for denmark , from 1866 and onwards , 12 members were appointed by the king ( later on the government de facto ) , 1 by the faroese islands ' assembly , and the remaining 53 through indirect elections in an electoral system . 
  the house of lords in the uk is exclusively by appointment if i 'm not mistaken . 
  the house of lords also do n't have fixed number of members and is currently larger than the house of commons . 
  in denmark it was fixed to 66 ( later expanded ) and smaller than the second chamber as it is in most bicameral systems . 
  and there are some other differences too . 
  but yeah , it was a bicameral parliament just like the uk , just not * exactly * the same . 
  denmark too had ` rigsdag ' until 1953 . 
  they originate from two different things . 
  a * thing * simply meant an assembly . 
  while a * riksdag * was a ( usually yearly ) meeting of the realm , usually of representatives of different local * things * . 
  through the years when sweden became more centralized and governed more as one nation , the * riksdag * became more akin to a permanent * thing * but kept the name . 
  the difference between the two can be seen more clearly in denmark prior to 1953 . 
  their parliament was called ` rigsdagen ' , while its two chambers were ` folketinget ' and ` landstinget ' respectively . 
  in 1953 they abolished ` landstinget ' for a single chamber ` folketing ' as parliament . 
  when we moved to a single chamber system , we kept the name ` riksdag ' . 
  * things * were more regional governance in sweden , not national . 
  not that many actually go to church , but the majority of swedes ( ~ 63 % ) are members of the church of sweden . 
  there are several reasons why those numbers are so high despite people not being religious , and leaving does requires you to take a `` stance '' many are not willing to . 
  it 's very easy to leave , but most do n't care for doing it . 
  the church does a lot of good welfare - and societal things and such , that really has nothing to do with religion , so people do n't see an issue with paying that extra tax a membership entails . 
  honestly , most of the things the church does is n't inherently religious . 
  also by being a member you 're allowed to have funerals and weddings in church , which many want despite not being religious . 
  but yeah , sweden is a secularized christian society . 
  and many ( most ? ), 
  are irreligious cultural christians , and see themselves as such . 
  technically , it was 85,81 % . 
  if you 're rounding it to whole integers that 'd more accurately be 86 % . 
  stop making us look worse !, 
  what turnout do you usually have ? 
  i always thought it 'd be quite similar to ours . 
  we had 85,8 % the last election , 84,6 % the one before . 
  `` inkasso '' is debt collection . 
  like if you fail to pay an invoice before the payment deadline you receive an ` inkasso ' - demand with an added collection fee . 
  the name is probably also meant as a bastardization of sebastian * ingrosso * of swedish house mafia of course . 
  scandinavian techno-dance society = swedish house mafia fatswell = axwell inkazzo = ingrosso fake swedish accents , `` save the word '' , etc. 
  ^ ( edit : typo ), 
  i found [ this ] ( http://www.sprakinstitutet.fi/sv/publikationer/sprakspalter/reuters_rutor/1988/soul_och_andra_namn ) in a quick search . 
  sure , it 's technically not a * swedish * source . 
  but it is from the official language institute of finland , which of course also handle with swedish . 
  so , both spelling and pronunciation was deemed correct in 1988 . 
  -- for more modern standards : tt , the national news agency , does specify [ '' * seoul * -- not s\u00f6ul '' ] ( https://tt.se/tt-spraket/ord-och-begrepp/ordsnabben/ ) . 
  they do indeed . 
  korean is n't written with the latin alphabet , it 's never going to match perfectly . 
  the same is true in reverse . 
  one issue with m-r is that due to it 's inconveniences , many would omit the breves and diaereses altogether which makes it absolutely dreadful . 
   interesting about mcc-r and it 's \u3150 is that \uc5d0 after \u314f is written \u00eb instead of e , just to distinguish it from \u3150 , ae . 
  clever , but again , not much use for anyone who has n't learned these differences . 
  yeah , i know . 
  when i started learning korean it was mostly m-r that was used , i know it well . 
  and , of course , you have to learn those peculiarities . 
  using diaereses that way will probably come more naturally to say a spanish speaker than to us swedes who are used to dotted characters having different sounds . 
  the latin alphabet has so many variations with different customs that no matter the romanization it 'll be misleading to some . 
   i 'm sure you have seen the 's \u00f6ul ' spelling that messes the pronunciation up for any swede i honestly ca n't recall that . 
  but i believe you , i have heard it pronounced in such a way . 
  i 've also heard `` seh -- o -- ul '' because of how it 's spelled in revised , which is n't much better ... 
  it 's because revised romanization limits itself to the iso basic latin alphabet for international convenience . 
  as such it could n't use diacritics or such and needs to rely on digraphs . 
  mccune -- reischauer romanization which was used officially in south korea until 2000 and still is in north korea uses several diacritics . 
  \uc73c is ' \u016d ' and \uc5b4 is ' \u014f ' for example . 
  \uc560 is still ` ae ' though . 
  but yeah , i agree . 
  digraphs are bad for transcription , they 're misleading . 
  what 's with the finnish striped area around m\u00e4laren in sweden ? 
  nah , sweden 's the dick , finland 's the balls , and denmark 's the ejaculate coming off the tip . 
  norway 's also a zoomed in spermatozoon . 
  if your dick looks like scandinavia , you should probably have it checked . 
  that norwegian abscess is n't normal . 
  part of it 's on the * scandinavian peninsula * , it 's not part of * scandinavia * .
