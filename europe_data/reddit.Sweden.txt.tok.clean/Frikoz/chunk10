  outside the entrance . 
  when i previously lived in a house we had one on the mailbox , but none by the door . 
  they stem from the same word , but neither of the current meanings . 
  it 's actually closer in english as they all come from old norse * gipt * , which referred to something given , a * gift * . 
  the woman was `` given '' away in marriage , and the poison was `` given '' . 
  we learned about it sometime around grade 7-8 or so . 
  not super duper in-depth but we certainly spent a few classes on the subject and got the general gist of things . 
  it was also mentioned in secondary school . 
   the karl xii : s likf\u00e4rd painting is beautiful . 
  there are actually two of it . 
  cederstr\u00f6m painted the first one in paris in 1878 which ended up being sold to some grand duke of russia and placed in a palace there . 
  this cause quite a stir in sweden as russia was the very country charles xii spent his life fighting and many found it disgraceful to have a painting of the late king 's funeral progression placed there . 
  so they started a collection to have cederstr\u00f6m paint another , which he did in sweden in 1884 and which was put in the national museum . 
  the [ 1878 version ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/karl_xiis_likf%c3%a4rd_-_g%c3%b6teborgs_konstmuseum_-_gustaf_cederstr%c3%b6m.jpg/1280px-karl_xiis_likf%c3%a4rd_-_g%c3%b6teborgs_konstmuseum_-_gustaf_cederstr%c3%b6m.jpg ) eventually found its way to sweden and can since 1934 be found at the gothenburg museum of art , the [ 1884 version ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/gustaf_cederstr%c3%b6m_-_bringing_home_the_body_of_king_karl_xii_of_sweden_-_google_art_project.jpg/1280px-gustaf_cederstr%c3%b6m_-_bringing_home_the_body_of_king_karl_xii_of_sweden_-_google_art_project.jpg ) can still be found in its original museum in stockholm . 
  [ also blocked ] ( https://polsy.org.uk/stuff/ytrestrict.cgi?ytid=https%3a%2f%2fwww.youtube.com%2fwatch%3fv%3dlxcrj6cuiik ) if op 's in the us or s.korea . 
  not if they 're in canada , taiwan or brazil . 
  here 's a [ dailymotion mirror ] ( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4anosd ) that may work if it 's the us you 're in / u/wesleypatterson . 
  i know the phonetic differences , but i do remember how specifically * `` woll '' * was used in chaucer poems when we studied them . 
  and as i recall was used exactly like * will * would . 
  but you may very well be right and that it was used differently , i do n't know , i may be misremembering . 
  you probably know this stuff better than me . 
  i just know that * wo n't * comes from * woll not * . 
  i do n't know about that , chaucer used it in poems and i do n't know many people more middle english than he was . 
  o , u , y , and i were all used during the middle english period iirc from my studies . 
  it 's not really at all like a hybrid language , it 's germanic . 
  there is however a hypothesis middle english may have originally developed as a creole , but english is considered to be fully germanic with reason . 
  it 's just like it 's the bastard child of germanics filled with exceptions , inconsistencies , and loan words . 
    nearly half of english is made up of romance words and only around 1/4 made up of germanic words . 
  actually i believe it 's estimated to almost 60 % but while technically true for the dictionary , it 's a very misleading factoid . 
  a lot of those words are specific jargon and rare loanwords you 'll virtually never hear outside of a spelling bee competition . 
  if you look at the list of most common words in english , pretty much all have germanic origin . 
  if you look at * any * sentence , the majority of the words will most likely be germanic in origin . 
  that said it is heavily influenced by french , but it 's still a germanic language . 
   then we have silly things like would not = would n't , but will not = wo n't and not `` will n't '' . 
  * wo n't * comes from `` woll not '' that 's why . 
  * woll * being an archaic variation of * will * that 's fallen out of use . 
  it 's already a well developed city , the third largest city in sweden . 
  and the fact that it 's on the swedish side of the \u00d8\u0308resund bridge , directly connecting it to copenhagen , is the main reason the region could become so strong . 
  they 're directly connected . 
  it 's also already of significance . 
  it 's already the place many venues and events are chosen to be held , even beating stockholm . 
  there are of course other alternatives , but malm\u00f6 would in my opinion probably be one of the better choices . 
  anywhere !, 
  it 'd empty it of all the stockolmers and their vaingloriousness !, 
  :p no , but if i had to i 'd probably say malm\u00f6 . 
  together with copenhagen it 'd have the potential to create an international powerhouse and it 'd possibly strengthen relations with the continent . 
  or , from a national perspective , maybe j\u00f6nk\u00f6ping . 
  it 's feels like it 's the most suitable city close to the middle of the big three cities and in the most populated parts ( i.e. , the south ) of sweden . 
  i would love to see have a more developed city in the north to strengthen that region , but i do n't necessarily think it 's the most suitable location for a capital . 
  it 's a bit disconnected from ... everything . 
  distances are too long . 
  yeah , i know . 
  that 's why i find the multi-language labels ridiculous . 
  beer ... beer ... beer ... beer ... * strong * beer . 
  all languages just calls it beer except us . 
  can be noted that when spoken normally you can just say a simple '' \u00f6l '' , but they always make the distinction on labels . 
   they are arranged alphabetically [ ... ] they are , * but * that 's not obvious for everybody , and it 's not something that helps people not well versed in vexillology . 
  sure , some people may realize you can hover the flag and see its name , but for most the fact that they 're alphabetical can be completely useless just because there are so many unnecessary options . 
  the vast majority of people do n't know even close to all flags on there , so the fact that they 're alphabetical does n't matter . 
  you ca n't locate things sorted alphabetically any easier if you do n't know which letter you 're on . 
   i 'd say flairs are useful to gauge the identity of the person you 're talking to [ ... ] i 'd agree if this was / r/askreddit and not / r/askeurope . 
  maybe we interpret this subs intention differently , but to me it has an inherently geographical purpose . 
  the vast majority of questions are aimed how it is in europe and european countries , and how perceptions in those places are , so to me * that 's * where the focus of the flairs should be . 
  they 're not asking what people of different sport affiliations see things . 
  now thanks to the free movement you can live in multiple countries or simply identify as a federalist , making a national choice difficult , so i do hold the eu flag a little separately as it still tells the op `` this guy 's european '' , but i do think the others are completely useless . 
  it 's not that i 'm against having many flairs , i 'm against having many flairs * for / r/askeurope * . 
   [ ... ] could come in use during olympic years . 
  this is exactly what i hope it does n't . 
  it 'll just end up with people having what i referred to as `` useless '' flairs that do n't tell you anything . 
   using a bot is a possibility . 
  they have one over at / r/europe , but i personally found it annoying to use [ ... ] i can definitely see that , especially for newcomers of reddit . 
  it can be programmed so that it 's just hitting a botton and has an automatically written message , but it can still be confusing and imposing for some . 
  that 's why my first thought was of simply sending a modmail , you 'd just have to tell them to write which country 's flag they wanted . 
  there 'd be no worrying of matching the formula perfectly if it 's a human reading it . 
  but this should rarely happen at all as my proposal was just to have it as an alternative for countries we never get users from ( e.g. 
  so that they 'd still have a possibility to have those flairs , but without crowding the selection for everyone we do regularly have people from . 
  that 's my two cents anyway . 
  do we really need those new flairs ? 
  i do have some concerns about it . 
  most importantly , it crowds the selection screen . 
  it 's already difficult enough for a new member to locate their among the selection . 
  now you 're filling it with even more . 
  if locating your flair is a hassle , people will just skip doing it . 
  sure it 's easy for us who 've already picked one , but you have to cater the flairs for newcomers , and having too many will just cause people to not use one at all . 
  it also encourages picking a `` useless '' flair . 
  so , what do i mean by useless ? 
  well , i mean one that does n't tell the users anything of value . 
  for example the olympic movement . 
  sure , you may want to support it , great for you !, 
  but this is / r / ** askeurope ** , and you having five colorful rings will not add anything of value whatsoever . 
  flairs are brilliant as it allows you to get a quick glance as to which country or culture the person giving the response may have . 
  seeing how someone supports the olympics or the un does n't . 
  and just having the option to pick them , will cause people choose useless flairs over useful ones . 
  honestly i think you should remove all but the most common flairs . 
  keep all european countries and regular outsiders ' , and remove the rest from the user selection screen . 
  now you may think that is rude in case any tuvaluan happens to show up against all odds , but hear me out . 
  i 'm not saying remove the flairs completely , only from the user selection screen . 
  for those countries you could add a link in the sidebar or create a wiki page with instructions to send a modmail and have it manually assigned by a mod ( or a bot ) . 
  considering how few users will be from those countries , it does n't need to be user assigned , they just take up space . 
  now , i know this would create a tiny bit extra work for mods if you do n't set up a bot , but the number of cases per month should honestly be negligible if all common ones are selectable .
