  but if it would be too much i 'd of course be happy to help , you only need flair privileges for it . 
  but that 's just my two cents . 
  others may not agree . 
  also , the faroese islands ' flair seems to have a bad css reference , it 's all white . 
  ** tl ; dr ** this is / r/askeurope , not / r/vexillology . 
  let 's have flairs that serve a purpose instead of just adding superfluous ones . 
  it just creates unnecessary obstacles for newcomers and may diminish the flairs usefulness . 
  to expand , ` stark ' relates to * stark\u00f6l * ( `` strong beer '' ) . 
  in sweden that 's any beer above 3,6 % abv , i.e. 
  beer only to be sold by the monopoly or in open containers ( restaurants , bars etc. ) . 
  in the pub a ` stark ' usually means 5-6 % abv as said . 
  between 2,25-3 ,5 % abv it 's called * folk\u00f6l * , which is 18 + and can be sold in any store . 
  below 2,25 % abv it 's called * l\u00e4tt\u00f6l * ( `` light beer '' ) , which has no age limit . 
  it can look a bit weird on bottles with labels in multiple languages , because for swedish it usually specifies '' * strong * beer '' , when most others just say `` beer '' . 
  so it can become a bit of a : beer ... bier ... bi\u00e8re ... cerveza ... \u00f8l ... * stark * \u00d6l . 
  well , none of that 's my experience here , at all . 
  so i guess i did n't really see how it applied to op 's question , but i suppose you could interpret it as talking about individual countries too . 
  i did not know it was that difficult in austria , that surprises me . 
   and how much easier it is to start a small business in the us . 
  exactly how much easier is it ? 
  actually , how is it easier in any way at all ? 
  i 'm genuinely curious . 
  several european countries score higher than the us on the ease of doing business index and setting up a business here consists of filling in a single piece of paper . 
  it could n't be much easier . 
  yeah , we have it . 
  when you 've tricked someone you 're supposed to say the rhyme * `` april april , din dumma sill , jag kan lura dig vart jag vill !, 
  '' * ( `` april april , you stupid herring , i can fool you to wherever i want !, 
  '' ) , or just the shortened `` april , april ! '' . 
  i do n't generally do anything since i rarely have good enough imagination to come up with something funny . 
  if you meant to write `` what is v4 ? 
  '' , it stands for * visegr\u00e1d 4 * , i.e. 
  czech republic , slovakia , hungary , and poland . 
  the way we celebrate midsummer maybe . 
  our neighbors all seem to burn mighty bonfires , meanwhile we erect a phallus-looking pole and hop around it pretending to be frogs . 
  probably true for some , but i do n't use my phone for much else than phone calls . 
  i have barely any exposure to autocorrect . 
  and i 've also started to make really stupid grammatical mistakes , ca n't blame that on autocorrect . 
  maybe my brain is just starting to go bad . 
  or maybe , i was given a brain only capable of storing two languages , so when i went over the limit it started overwriting aspects of one with new information of another . 
  that is totally how it works , right ... ? 
  do you by chance have subreddit css disabled or browse using a mobile platform without custom css support for flairs ? 
  i ask because we who do n't can see a norwegian flag , `` eastway '' is just the flair text . 
  noticeably better . 
  my swedish is n't horrible , but my brain just works faster in english mode . 
  but honestly both are pretty mediocre . 
  i sometimes have to look up words in swedish , very rarely in english . 
  my schooling in secondary school was in english and it was my most used language for a significant part of my life , so it 's not that weird . 
  i have been making a conscious effort to to improve my swedish again recently . 
  but at the same time i feel my english has gotten worse and i find myself making mistakes i did n't use to do . 
  june 6th . 
  it 's also the `` swedish flag 's day '' . 
  not that many care , but you get the day off since 2005 . 
  it was the date gustav i ( vasa ) was elected king of sweden 1523 and the instruments of government in 1809 and 1974 was adopted . 
  also the day charles x ascended the throne in 1654 . 
  i do n't really think any of it 's very common in sweden . 
  we barely have specialized stores anymore . 
  this was on a somewhat isolated island without any convenience stores or such whatsoever , so it 's a bit different . 
  we also had a butcher 's shop there when i was young ( unlike yours , they did not give any free things ... ) . 
  but now a supermarket has opened , the butcher 's has had to close , and i 'm honestly a little worried about the future of my beloved childhood bakery . 
  but hopefully it will survive . 
  the local bakery near my childhood summer house gives free cinnamon rolls to all children . 
  during summers we 'd go there by boat every morning to buy fresh bread ( and for me to get that delicious cinnamon roll ! ) . 
  the thing is they do n't have an established age limit . 
  and considering it was the same people year after year , who 'd recognize me , i think they felt guilty or something for that one day they had to stop giving me cinnamon rolls . 
  so they just kept giving , even when i was old enough to drive the boat there myself . 
  eventually the house was sold and we did n't go to the bakery anymore . 
  but i found my way out there after a few years while traveling . 
  as it turns out 21 is too old for free cinnamon rolls ... or so i thought until i got home and opened the bag ... 
  i love that bakery . 
  snus is a type of moist tobacco snuff for oral use . 
  it 's put it under the ( usually upper ) lip . 
  it 's a bit like a safer dipping tobacco that does n't require any spitting or such . 
  it 's illegal to sell in the eu , sweden just has an exemption . 
  it 's mostly used in sweden and its neighbors , not very widespread internationally . 
  there has also been a growing market for snus in the us . 
  american - and scandinavian snus are however quite different . 
  ours follow much stricter standards , and the one produced in america is more hazardous and seen more as an insult to the name . 
  it 's healthier than smoking , but still very carcinogenic . 
  it 's also a lot more convenient as you do n't have to worry about cigarette smell , having to go outside , or indirectly affecting others . 
  it 's not uncommon to switch from smoking to snus , some use it as a stepping stone to quit completely . 
  depending on amount , using snus can however give a rather distinct , swollen-looking `` snus lip '' . 
  this is more of concern for some than others . 
  falukorv is tsg protected by the eu . 
  so it is filled with * exactly * what should be there . 
  that being said what should be there is n't necessarily things a sausage snob may accept . 
  it was traditionally a `` working class sausage '' , and was n't exactly made of the finest of ingredients . 
  but it is quite tasty . 
  i should also say that most our brands do actually significantly exceed what the eu standards require . 
  for example their required to have a minimum of 45 % meat by weight , while most brands to my knowledge have 60-70 % ( the remaining part is mostly starch and water for binding ) . 
  i do n't know what gelbwurst is and have never tried it , but it does indeed look very similar . 
  -- here are things eu requires and allows falukorv to contain :  ** obligatory raw materials ** -- raw or salted beef , horsemeat or pigmeat with rind removed ( meat as defined in annex i to european parliament and council directive 2000/13/ec ) , -- raw or salted pig fat with rind removed , -- potato flour , -- water , -- salt , -- seasoning . 
  ** raw materials permitted ** -- sugar , -- dextrose , -- onion . 
  ** obligatory additives ** -- preservative e 250 . 
  ** additives permitted ** -- anti-oxidants e 300 , e 301 , -- stabilisers e 450 , e 451 , e 452 ( maximum 1,5 g/kg calculated as p2o5 ) . 
  and these are the defined mini - / maximums of materials per 100g finished product ( but as said most brands have significantly more meat than is required of them ) : minimum 45g meat . 
  maximum 65g water . 
  maximum 4g dry potato flour . 
  maximum 23g fat . 
  and if you want to know what food reviewer extraordinaire , the eu , thinks about falukorv :  the colour of the slices ranges from a faint to marked brownish-pink . 
  the consistency is firm .
