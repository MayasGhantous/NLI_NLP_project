  ` falukorv ' has a delicate to pronounced taste of smoke , seasoning and salt . 
  i 'm indifferent towards it . 
  it 's not for me and i really do n't care . 
  it 's not on my list of concerns . 
  i do n't like having strong opinions on things i 'm not well informed about . 
  i find the debate a bit exhausting to be honest , and i disagree with what i 've seen from both sides . 
  i do n't believe it 's as harmless as the pro side makes it out to be , nor as harmful as the opposition . 
  but i suppose it 's not uncommon for things to go to the extremes in political debates . 
  i 'm neither for nor against it . 
  i 'm fine with it being legal as long as there 's be proper legislation preventing exposure to people who do n't want it ( e.g. 
  the smoking ban for restaurants etc. ), 
  or in any other way affect them ( dui , child neglect etc. 
  ) , there is some kind of system at hand to prevent and combat addiction , and such things . 
  i 'm also perfectly fine with it remaining illegal . 
  i just do n't care and have n't given to much thought about it . 
  the swedish mindset can be a bit extreme and hypocritical at times . 
  but since it is clearly illegal , i ca n't say i feel any empathy for people who are caught and whine about it on facebook . 
  it 's not `` injustice '' . 
  if you make your bed , you better be prepared to lie in it . 
  i do n't see it as justified civil disobedience . 
  about sweden and cigarette smoking , we are a bit weird . 
  supposedly we 're the only country where smoking rates for women are higher than for men , and it 's not by an insignificant amount either . 
  most smokers here are women . 
  it probably has a bit to do with our precious snus , which is more popular among men . 
  ca n't respond to your question as i do n't , but i just wanted to say that smoking rates have been going down in i believe every european country . 
  and it varies quite a bit across it . 
  a fair bit of europe has [ lower cigarette consumption per capita ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_cigarette_consumption_per_capita#2014_rankings ) than the us . 
  and the attitude towards smokers can also be very different . 
  here in sweden smoking 's generally looked down upon and attitudes can be pretty hostile . 
  as for why weed is more popular in the us than sweden , it 's probably because most see recreational drug users as junkies here , it does n't matter if it 's cannabis/meth/heroin / krokodil/whatever . 
  and our drug laws are really strict . 
  not exactly something you 'd flaunt about doing . 
  saab automobiles is `` gone '' ( not really , the name and brand has been sold and reproduction is coming , but it 's not quite here yet ) . 
  volvo cars is owned by a chinese company , but is mostly run from sweden . 
  koenigsegg is fully swedish . 
  pretty high-quality and safe , i suppose . 
  they 've always prioritized safety over simply making money which is a virtue i can fully support . 
  volvo is the most popular car brand in sweden and has been ... forever . 
  saab used to be popular too , and you can still see many out and about . 
  i do n't own any car myself , so no , i do n't own any . 
  koenigseggs are pretty fast i suppose . 
  seen a few , but never driven or rode in one so i do n't know them well . 
  yeah , i realize they are n't both used as letters at the same time . 
  i was just wondering in general . 
  makes sense you get accustomed to it . 
  i can also see there 's something `` off '' , but i 'd probably be confused . 
  they look similar enough to just be a different font to me . 
  yeah , pretty much the same in swedish . 
  the only differences are : maart =  mars mei =  maj augustus =  augusti did n't know we were more similar to you than the other scandinavians who keep dropping the ` i ' . 
  i know . 
  that 's why i said there are some exceptions and that it gets a bit more complicated . 
  did n't see the need to write an essay for a quick explanation of the difference . 
  is there ever any ambiguity and confusion over ' \u0431 ' and ' 6 ' ? 
  to me they look pretty much exactly the same . 
  99,7 % of registered companies are privately owned . 
  the majority are `` one man companies '' , but of the companies with more employees i believe most are family owned . 
  according to [ this study ] ( https://www.sns.se/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/familjeforetagande_affarer_och_kanslor.pdf ) ( ca n't verify its authenticity and it is seemingly based on owner perception , but i ca n't find anything else categorizing it ) , among companies of ... 5-19 employees : ~ 60 % are family owned . 
  20-99 employees : ~ 45 % 100-499 employees : ~ 35 % 500 + employees : ~ 20 % i suppose they 're viewed similarly as you say it is in the us . 
  effective but a bit nepotistic . 
  [ you can still turn it in . 
  ] ( http://www.riksbank.se/sv/sedlar--mynt/sedlar/att-losa-in-ogiltiga-sedlar/ ) they will take a 100 sek fee per transaction , but if it 's a 1000 kronor bill you 'll still get 900 out of it , and if you find any other bills you can turn them in at the same time for full value . 
  or if you 're not hurting for cash , keep it and reminisce about the good old royal bills ... and then sell it to a collector in 50 years !, 
  or something . 
  i do n't know . 
  i do n't know , i do . 
  it refers to the words order . 
  svo means * subject-verb-object * , v2 is * verb-second * . 
  english is considered svo ( there are some exceptions ) , danish is v2 . 
  i think dutch is usually v2 too , sometimes switching to vf ( verb-final ) , right ? 
  the difference becomes clear when you add say ` yesterday ' * to the front * . 
  in v2 the verb should come in second :  yesterday read i a book . 
  in svo the order of subject-verb-object should persist :  yesterday i read a book . 
  v2 can also be more flexible as anything can go in front of the verb . 
  the verb just has to come in second . 
  which is n't really standard in english . 
  so you can shift emphasis to the object and say things like :  the book read i it gets a bit more complicated , but you get the idea . 
  the orthography , or lack thereof i suppose . 
  it does n't make any sense . 
  spelling and pronunciation correlate poorly , as can be seen in the poem ` the chaos ' . 
  also some of the phonetics we do n't have , like z 's and w 's . 
   which do you find more similar to your native language , german or english ? 
  do n't know . 
  ca n't compare since i already speak english . 
  english grammar feels a bit more similar since ours is a bit dumbed down and english is `` baby level '' , german feels much more complicated to me . 
  but that may be a biased perception since i speak swedish and english fluently , while my german ca n't get me much more than a beer . 
  ^ ( edit : spelling ), 
  it 's not entirely without reason to be upset . 
  you fight a war and win . 
  and then when you 've negotiated a peace treaty with * mutually agreed upon terms * , the opponent go and render it void . 
  and just to add insult to injury they start it by hooking up with the danes again . 
  but yeah , i did say it was a bit of a cunt move . 
  but not one without reason . 
   until a couple of years ago , it was still in danish , even as if bokm\u00e5l 's any different ...  ( pls , do n't hurt me norwegians ), 
   sweden occupied norway ( or tried to ) immediately before the got their independence . 
  not entirely . 
  according to the treaty of kiel ( napoleonic wars ) denmark-norway was to turn over norway to the swedish king . 
  but before this could be enacted the norwegian hurried to write a constitution declaring itself independent and elected the danish-norwegian crown-prince as king . 
  the swedish king did n't stand for this so he arranged a campaign against norway . 
  this lasted 2,5 weeks and ended with norway entering a personal union under the swedish king . 
  sweden 's `` last '' war .
