  so it was n't about norway `` getting '' independence , and it was after they 'd declared it . 
  it also was n't without reason , but a bit of a cunt move by us still . 
  we do n't hate them , we just make fun of them . 
  they 're often the butt of our jokes . 
  this . 
  we may bicker and tease , but it 's out of love . 
  it 's a sibling thing . 
  i 'm pretty sure something akin to that proverb is in the bible though , so i 'm not sure about the danishness of it . 
  in modern times a country is generally considered a country when it receives enough recognition from other countries . 
  but that is not the date neither nordic country 's `` founding date '' is based on . 
  those are defined as when the norwegian , danish , and geatish and swedish tribes respectively unified under a single ruler . 
  and this is entirely unknown for sweden and norway , and more confirmed for denmark ( but not without disputes either . 
  some say bluetooth , others gorm ) . 
  and even counting foreign sources , the * swedes * and the * kingdom of swedes * are mentioned early . 
  which is why it 's a dreadful comparison because the * kingdom of swedes * lived on as a name for the kingdom of both swedes and geats , it 's even called * swede * n , the geats disappeared . 
  denmark does n't have any ambiguity . 
  and the danelaw was n't really established by the kingdom of denmark , was it ? 
  it was established against alfred the great . 
  similarly the rus ' from `` sweden '' founded russia and the varangian guard influenced byzantium back then too ... 
  but it 's irrelevant to the `` kingdoms ' power '' . 
  danish kings took over * all of england * , which can be a greater show of power than danelaw . 
  and the danish did n't really occupy normandy . 
  normandy came to be when a group of norsemen * legally got permission * to settle the region in exchange for protecting it . 
  these norsemen came from * different parts of scandinavia * and were according to most legends lead by a norwegian . 
  i 'm just saying it can be argued , not that it was n't the case . 
  i 'm by no means saying denmark was n't powerful , i 'm not saying it is n't old , both are definite yes . 
  i 'm just saying theories should n't be presented as fact . 
  i do n't know , you do n't know , no one knows . 
  it should n't be pretended to be so . 
  that 's it . 
  and it 's pretty pointless comparing . 
   denmark is the oldest of the three kingdoms , and was in the start also the most powerful lies !, 
  `` norway '' can be seen as being unified by at least the battle of hafrsfjord . 
  sweden 's age is unknown and disputed , and there 's no evidence pointing towards it being younger than denmark . 
  as for who was the most powerful in the beginning can too be argued . 
  the rest is fine though , but stop spreading unfounded theories , you little sneaky dane . 
  it 's illegal in a whole bunch of countries . 
  i do n't even think germany have the strictest laws on it , it allows for exceptions in extraordinary cases where schooling would create hardship for the child afaik . 
  we have a similar law here in sweden and those exceptions are virtually never granted . 
   i just checked , seems like sweden is planning to make it illegal too . 
  it 's already illegal in the same way as germany : illegal except for extraordinary circumstances , which are virtually never granted . 
  it 's illegal in a bunch of other countries too . 
  i meant there were no such bags for sale at all , they only had yellow ones ( which are only for the store ) . 
  poor phrasing on my part , sorry . 
  no no , that 's everywhere . 
  they originally only had the yellow ones for the store , then later had to introduce the blue for people to purchase since the yellows got stolen . 
  the yellows were always intended to stay in the store . 
  they only expected people to use them as shopping baskets * in * the store . 
  they were n't for sale initially , only yellow ones . 
  they only started selling those blue ones after they started receiving innumerable requests for them and their yellow ones started `` disappearing '' . 
  many stores were having issues keeping stock of yellows just because of how many were stolen ... 
  source : ikea museum ( yes , that exist . 
  it 's in the original store building in \u00c4lmhult . ), 
  i agree , not gon na argue that . 
  and i did put that ` essentially ' there since i know the first * had * has a use . 
  i 'm just saying they 're not entirely comparable . 
  i 'm not saying the sentence is great . 
  it 's just a traditional and pretty common example of what op asked for of the english language . 
  that 's all . 
  well ... that depends a lot on the subreddit , i know some that are ... * yeah * ... 
  but for the most part it 's alright . 
  it certainly is . 
  its sorting algorithm is awful . 
  it usually ends up quite bigoted and as you say hateful . 
  do n't pay much attention to youtube comments , you do n't need that in life , trust me . 
  i installed alientube just to get rid of it and now get reddit threads instead of comments . 
  you may , but there 's a significant difference between the two in terms of the use -- mention distinction of analytical philosophy though . 
  your sentence is n't using the word , it 's essentially only mentions . 
  and i mean `` buffalo ... '' is also kind of cheating . 
  how often have you heard the verb ` buffalo ' ? 
  i agree it 's better when they 're natural sentences , but the two i posted are traditional phrases used to demonstrate lexical ambiguity and do both apply the use-mention distinction . 
  just like ` f\u00e5r f\u00e5r f\u00e5r ? ', 
  in op is for swedish . 
  you should n't have any issues in norway at all . 
  maybe the occasional person asking if you know a genie as a joke . 
  youtube comments are rarely to be paid much attention to . 
   we have meatballs too but no one seems to know . 
  most swedes would probably assume you do , at least some type of it . 
  it 's a * very * well known theory that we got the predecessor to ours with charles xii 's return from the ottoman empire . 
  those were a bit different than modern swedish meatballs , but meatballs nonetheless . 
  ca n't speak for everyone , but my family and the majority of my friends ' i know do egg fighting here in sweden too . 
  oh , yeah , that 's right !, 
  i remember giving willow twigs as a kid too , no rhyming though . 
  but maybe others do that here too . 
  robben does n't crawl , robben only cuts inside . 
  p\u00e5skk\u00e4rringar ( `` easter hags '' ) . 
  children dress-up as old hags . 
  it stems from old swedish folklore that witches flew on brooms to * bl\u00e5kulla * ( essentially the devil 's meadow ) between maundy thursday and easter sunday to celebrate witches ' sabbath with the devil . 
  somehow this became that children should dress up like the hags and people should give them candy for looking cute i guess . 
  but local traditions vary a bit . 
  there 's no discrimination , i too was a hag with dress and everything as a boy . 
  there are also easter bonfires for the same satanic , witchy reason . 
  edit : there 's no english wikipedia page , but [ here 's ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/p%c3%a5skk%c3%a4rring ) the swedish one with some images . 
  it was just asked if we watched this so called ` march madness ' ( literally [ `` 1 day ago '' ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/60h7d1/is_march_madness_watched_much_in_your_country/ ) ) . 
  virtually no one even knew what it was . 
  it 's difficult to fill out brackets for something you do n't know what it is !, 
  same as the one above but with seals and crawling rather than flies and flying , if i 'm not mistaken . 
  is it not still grammatically correct if you move the ` hinter ' to the second spot in the sentence so you get six in a row ? 
  i 'm sure i 've seen that before . 
  ( `` is that what it is ?
