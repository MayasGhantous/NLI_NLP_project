  that is what it is ! '' ), 
  you know you can also drag out the response to the ' * f\u00e5r f\u00e5r f\u00e5r ? 
  * ' you posted to ' * nej , inte f\u00e5r f\u00e5r f\u00e5r , f\u00e5r f\u00e5r lamm * ' . 
  also it 's usually in my experience said with the added ' * far , ... * ' ( `` father , ... '' ) in the beginning , since that too is a similar word . 
  -- english : buffalo buffalo , buffalo buffalo buffalo , buffalo buffalo buffalo ( `` buffalo '' can be a city in new york ( hence the capitalized ` buffalo ' ) , an animal , or a slightly archaic verb for bullying ) james , while john had had * had * , had had * had had * ; * had had * had had a better effect on the teacher . 
  [ max ] ( http://www.maxburgers.com/ ) and [ frasses ] ( http://frasses.se/ ) have pretty tasty burgers and such , made from good , fresh ingredients . 
  much better than the american alternatives we have imo . 
  but i do n't really know to many chains . 
  the few times i go to restaurants i prefer `` real '' ones . 
  in my experience , waiters and such always ask which type if you just say `` water '' . 
  meanwhile , virtually everyone who actually do want sparkling water , specifically order that like you say . 
  huh . 
  i thought valio had a similar product range in sweden , but i ca n't see them having any such yoghurt here . 
  they do however have some [ * medelhavsyoghurt * ] ( https://lottabrinck.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/laktosfri_medelhavs_yoghurt_400gr_ny.jpg ) ( `` mediterranean sea yogurt '' ) , whatever that is . 
  edit : come to think of it i suppose that name may just be like with their `` lactose-free milk ^ ^ drink '' and that they just could n't call it some traditional name since it 's lactose-free . 
  ignorant person here , but are they not different things ? 
  in sweden * grekisk yoghurt * is slightly more acidic and protein rich than the original * turkisk yoghurt * . 
  then there 's * cypriotisk yoghurt * which is much fatter , and russian with a creamier consistency . 
  the brand i usually have bases their greek one on an originally greek variation of the recipe , hence the name . 
  that variation specifically did come from greece . 
  their traditional yoghurt is indeed called `` turkisk '' . 
  i 'm confused . 
  i think it 's [ this ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/5ihck2/do_you_have_a_meal_called_by_another_country_or/ ) one / u/heebicka is talking about . 
  instinctively i 'd say still , as sparkling usually has some descriptor ( `` carbonic acidified '' ( carbonated ) , mineral , bubble - , etc. ) . 
  but i do n't think we have a `` default '' , they always ask in my experience . 
  ah , but those are not a separate letters , are they ? 
  we do n't treat * \u00e9 * like the basic vowels either . 
  it 's not its own letter , it 's an '' * e * med accent '' / `` accent - * e * '' / '' * e * with bird shit '' etc. 
  ( it 's called many things ) . 
  it 's also the only accented letter we have ( \u00e5\u00e4\u00f6 are n't !, 
  ) , really only used in words we stole from you guys . 
  do you have names for the vowels in french ? 
  i thought most languages just called them their phonetic value ( except for that weird one of course , * english * ... ) . 
  although , i do know that ` y ' is a `` greek i '' in spanish , maybe in the other romance languages too , but that 's also often used as a consonant and not vowel there . 
  in swedish ` y ' too just has its phonetic value . 
  it 's not messing up . 
  really . 
  i did say it was a * pedantic * distinction . 
   how do you call the letter \u00e4 then ? 
  in swedish ? 
  we call it : [ * \u00c4 * ] ( https://forvo.com/word/%c3%a4/#sv ) ... !, 
  it 's a vowel , it 's just called what it 's pronounced like when stressed . 
  similar to a drawn out ` a\u00ee ' in french , maybe ? 
  i do n't know . 
  i suck at explaining things . 
  in english i 'd just refer to it as an '' * a * with two dots '' . 
  that is what it looks like . 
  you really do n't need to worry about it . 
  as i said , when \u00e5 / \u00e4 / \u00f6 are n't available , we ourselves do just remove the floaty stuff and let context do the talking . 
  it 's rarely ambiguous . 
  but in this case there were just two words and ` akta ' actually works . 
  there was no ambiguity with the `` manniskor '' , as that can only be `` m\u00e4nniskor '' for example . 
  and if we 're being linguistically pedantic they 're ( unlike in german ) not diacritics like umlauts , accents , or such . 
  they 're fully separate letters with as much connection to their dot-less counterpart , as ` e ' has to ` i ' . 
  just like ` e ' looks like an ` i ' with three added lines , ' \u00c4 ' just looks like an ` a ' with two added dots . 
  everything else is different . 
  but that said , we still understand the removal of them . 
   they aired akta manniskor ( a scifi show from sweden ) in this case those little dots actually change the meaning quite a bit . 
  * akta * is a verb and can be translated in many ways , but it generally has to do with cautioning or paying attention to . 
  * \u00c4kta * is an adjective meaning `` real/genuine '' . 
  the proper swedish title is * \u00c4kta m\u00e4nniskor * ( `` real humans '' ) . 
  `` be mindful of humans '' does n't convey quite the same sentiment . 
  but i guess * akta manniskor * is n't completely wrong per se . 
  unlike say german , where you 'd typically replace \u00e4 with ae in international spelling , we do just remove the dots . 
  it 's in instances like these that it can get a little confusing ... had to do a double take to understand what you meant . 
  i believe there was some english-language remake of it from the uk too , but i 've seen neither so i do n't know if it 's true to the original . 
  to me , no . 
  i suppose some people are going to argue either way , it depends if you 're up early or out late i guess . 
  in the middle of summer the day really is long enough for the change not to be insignificant . 
  right when it shifts during spring/fall , you may notice a slight difference , but it 's really not too big imo . 
  in general , the further north you go , the less significant of a change dst brings since the days are naturally longer . 
  and sweden is pretty far north . 
  it can mess up the schedule for farmers ( as everywhere ) , since their animals , and thus work , will remain at the same hours , while society and all its services , like deliveries , will shift an hour . 
  at the moment i live in the south , and where i live the sun rises at four and sets at ten around the summer solstice . 
  so about 18 hours , i guess ? 
  we do have pretty long days during summer in sweden . 
  far up there in the north there 's midnight sun . 
  it 's of course the exact opposite during winter . 
  relic of another time . 
  it has no effect on modern energy consumption , so it 's not like it 's original purpose is still valid . 
  i really ca n't see any reason for it , it 's just an annoyance . 
  but i grew up knowing plenty of farmers , they may have influenced my opinion of it a bit . 
  every single one of them , unsurprisingly , despised it . 
  i do n't know how you 'd generalize `` desirability to live '' in a country . 
  it 's * entirely * subjective in my experience . 
  quite a few swedes go to the us . 
  no language barrier , lower costs of living than here , and good opportunities ( what can be remembered is that people do n't really go to work for minimum wage in the us , they have greater opportunities ahead ) . 
  if you had to compare it to a country , maybe the uk ? 
  but as said , i do n't really understand comparing it . 
  the us is pretty popular . 
  it does n't have the greatest reputation for social security and such matters , but that 's not really an issue for people with good jobs and salaries lined up . 
  and those are the ones that are most interested in the us . 
  you 're looking to travel europe from gothenburg and start off by going to ... * trondheim * ? 
  650 km straight * north * ? 
  huh ... 
  interesting . 
   i want to know why we should really think about coming to visit your country meh , you know what it 's like . 
  literally . 
  i 'm not criticizing it !, 
  i 'm just wondering .
