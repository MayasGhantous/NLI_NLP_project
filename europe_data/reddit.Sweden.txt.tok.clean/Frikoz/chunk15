  text is just so weird to me to mark nsfw . 
  i mean , i do also find `` walking on egg shells around sex-related content '' really weird , but that i 've come to understand from this website and differences in culture . 
  but marking text as it i just do n't `` get '' . 
  and your image contains literal porn . 
  * that * is nsfw by most standards . 
  `` coward '' can be translated to `` mes '' in swedish , which is the same as the name for * tits * ( bird family ) . 
  it is . 
  it 's administered by an eponymous organization headquartered in switzerland . 
  schools must be authorized by them to teach ib , and all ib educations across the globe follow the same framework . 
  in addition to the `` diploma programme '' ( high school - * ish * ) , they also have primary - and middle years programmes for younger students . 
  no , * blue tit * is ` bl\u00e5mes ' and * booby * is ` sula ' in swedish . 
  but i do speak english , so yeah , i knew them previously . 
  furthermore i went the international baccalaureate , so all my classes were in english ( except swedish and spanish for obvious reasons ) and i probably know the names of more animal species in english than swedish ... 
  wait , so it 's `` nsfw '' in an orwellian thought police kind of way ? 
  i feel like i understand the reasoning even less now ... 
  what i never quite understood is how text can be nsfw ? 
  i mean i 'd understand not wanting to open certain types of images and videos in front of the boss ( actually i do n't even open sfw stuff myself ) , but how 's anyone gon na know the difference between sfw and nsfw * text * ? 
  or did you expect some [ glorious tit pics ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/eurasian_blue_tit_lancashire.jpg/1024px-eurasian_blue_tit_lancashire.jpg ) and [ horny videos of boobies ] ( https://youtu.be/d1cl4wsmkco?t=14s ) ? 
  ` kuk ' has the same origin as ` cock ' does in english . 
  it originally ( and still can in few dialects ) referred to a `` rooster '' , which then became a euphemism for penises . 
  no , there 's not much reason to do nowadays . 
  but if you ever were to get a non-eu plate , it 'd probably be best to remember it if you want to take the car across any borders . 
  op 's talking about the old white ellipse sticker from the vienna convention , the eu-plates you seem to be talking about replaces their functionality since the country code is already on them . 
  you do n't need the white ellipse within the eea if you have an eu-plate . 
  it 's not required anymore * because of * the eu-plates . 
  meanwhile , if you 're from uk or denmark and has opted out or for some other reason do n't have an eu-plate , you do need the sticker when traveling internationally . 
  it comes from the [ vienna convention on road traffic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vienna_convention_on_road_traffic ) from ' 68 . 
  [ article 37 ] ( https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/dam/trans/conventn/crt1968e.pdf#page=33 ) states :  1 . 
  every motor vehicle in international traffic shall display at the rear , in addition to its registration number , a distinguishing sign of the state in which it is registered . 
  [ ... ] [ annex 3 ] ( https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/dam/trans/conventn/crt1968e.pdf#page=46 ) regulates design :  1 . 
  the distinguishing sign referred to in article 37 of this convention shall consist of one to three letters in capital latin characters . 
  the letters shall have a height of at least 0.08 m and their strokes a width of at least 0.01 m . the letters shall be painted in black on a white ground having the shape of an ellipse with the major axis horizontal . 
  [ ... ] with the introduction of a common standard for license plates in the '90s , it 's become superfluous as the eu-plates have the country code to the left . 
  the white ellipses are n't as common anymore . 
  ** tl ; dr ** it was to denote where cars in international traffic was registered . 
  it 's unfortunately spread beyond the web . 
  but it is still limited to a * certain * type of people . 
  i did encounter quite a few in the us last , their orange-in-chief and his people is n't helping our reputation . 
  i know . 
  i was stretching calling some of them stereotypes , i just do n't know what else there are ? 
  most i encountered living abroad were stereotypes about switzerland because for whatever reason people ca n't tell us apart ... :| but stereotypes does n't mean they 're genuinely believed to be 100 % real , a stereotype is just a `` widely held but oversimplified image '' of something . 
  difference in bias does n't mean other 's do n't have certain ideas . 
  if you 're into hockey , you probably have more knowledge of swedes and their appearance than the average joe . 
  but you 're right , few probably think it 's true for everyone . 
  people do seem to believe being blond is more common than reality . 
  yeah , pretty much . 
  i thought it was just some 4chan fatuity until i went to the us last and ran into some * lovely * people . 
  but , yeah , it is limited to a particular group of people . 
  it is difficult to get ahold of abroad . 
  if you ever do have the opportunity , eat it properly . 
  do n't do it like those stupid youtube challenges . 
  and know that if it 's a grey goo in the can ( as can often be seen on those challenges ) , it 's gone bad due to not being refrigerated . 
  they 're supposed to be whole herrings or fillets , not soup . 
  also remember to tilt the can 45 \u00b0 when puncturing to prevent spray , and do it outside . 
  it does smell . 
  a lot . 
  and bad . 
  nah , while slightly more popular among financially limited people , i 'd say ikea 's more universal here than the us . 
  it may not be seen as being as nice as some fancy pants furniture , but ikea stuff can be found in all types of household . 
  but sweden still is n't the `` ikea-land '' some believe . 
  amy poehler 's brother greg had a show called * welcome to sweden * . 
  i 've only seen the first few episodes of either series so i ca n't really judge them . 
  it 's probably not as good as lilyhammer , but it might sate any `` american culture clashing in scandinavia '' craving you may have . 
   and norway 's not our hockey rival , never have been , that title belongs to finland . 
  damn lions . 
  norwegians , not you guys . 
   it 's because many swedes do go there after highschool and do their `` undesirable '' jobs as salaries are usually better in norway . 
  sweden 's about twice as populous , yes , but which one 's richer depends on metric . 
  looking at gdp we , with our much larger population , have a higher total gdp , but they have about 40 % higher gdp per capita . 
  norway is usually seen as richer one . 
  their gdp per capita is top 3 in the world , we chumps are struggling to make top 10 . 
  me and what money ? 
  did i not mention that shit 's expensive ? 
  we do not . 
  but traveling the us ( my family 's originally american , i have a lot of relatives and time spent there ) , i can tell you that in my experience that is what about 80 % of americans tend to go with when trying to imitate swedish . 
  15 % seem to use some weird german phonetics , the last 5 % succeed with somewhat realistic phonetics and prosody . 
  the muppet has had a clear influence on people 's idea of swedish . 
  also when they put that danish/norwegian * \u00d8 * i die a little inside , we use * \u00d6 * not a null sign . 
  we 're not all blonds . 
  and beauty is subjective , but i doubt that 's true either . 
  we 're not all muslims . 
  the majority are secularized christians . 
  nor are we all cuckolds , i personally do n't see the appeal of that fetish/kink . 
  we do n't all eat rotten fish . 
  first of all surstr\u00f6mming 's , like bread , fermented , and not rotten . 
  secondly the majority of swedes do n't eat it . 
  thirdly it 's delicious , do n't knock it 'til you tried it . 
  in general most do value their and other 's integrity and personal space . 
  so , yes , we may be seen as `` cold '' and reserved compared to some other countries and cultures . 
  we do n't all drive around in volvos and listen to abba all day . 
  nor are all our furniture from ikea . 
  though volvos are quite popular , and ikea furniture too . 
  abba 's disappeared from most people 's playlists . 
  we 're not socialist . 
  we do pay pretty high taxes and stuff it kind of expensive , especially alcohol . 
  but it 's cheaper than norway , so it 's not all bad . 
  we do n't all work in norway . 
  quite a few do . 
  we 're not all drunks . 
  the reason we may seem that way is because when we go abroad alcohol seems so cheap , so we must take the opportunity to test out the liver .
