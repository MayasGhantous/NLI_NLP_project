  ca n't do that at home . 
  we do n't sound like that muppet . 
  i do n't know what other stereotypes there are . 
  it varies from person to person , but in surveys danes usually score better on that , yes . 
  it 's all about previous exposure , the languages themselves are close enough to be understood . 
  it really is just about getting used to it . 
  the reason stockholm region dialects can be easier , is because that 's what you 'd hear on swedish television and other media , and that 's for many the main source of exposure to swedish . 
  especially among the older generation for whom svt was decently popular . 
  the older generation are also better at understanding swedish in general for this same reason . 
  sk\u00e5nska is n't really much closer to modern danish . 
  sure , the dialects come from 17th century danish and the region has had a bit more danish influence through the years since , but it has many peculiarities which does n't really give it much advantage in being understood by danes . 
  the general prosody is similar to that of bornholmsk though . 
  it 's not used much here either , we mostly use [ `` high-99 '' - quotation marks ] ( http://i.imgur.com/k1w8van.png ) for both opening and closing . 
  but you ca n't use `` '' in swedish . 
  well , i suppose you * can * , but it 's wrong . 
  '' `` or '' '' are the accepted ones , `` '' is not . 
   i just wondered since apparently swiss german uses the french style ( at least that 's what google told me ) . 
  i know you 're not as affected by the french language , but i figured i 'd ask since you said `` '' . 
  we 'd use '' `` or '' '' in swedish . 
  it seems to vary a lot . 
  `` '' is used in everything from arabic to russian to spanish etc. 
  it 's much more common than '' `` . 
  but '' `` does seem more common for germanic languages , it 's what we 'd use in swedish too ( or '' '' ) . 
  but then my googling told me that swiss standard german supposedly uses `` '' and since wurzn said `` '' i wondered if the other mountain german nation somehow does too . 
  even if austria 's clearly not as affected by the french language as switzerland . 
  but that book seems to have '' `` , not `` '' . 
  do you have both ? 
  oh , yeah , single quotes may confuse it . 
  but i honestly can recall having too many issues with that either . 
  but maybe they improved it , i did n't really learn about `` 66/99 '' until that teacher in upper secondary school , so probably around 2009 or so . 
  prior to that i probably would n't think of it . 
  double quotes should n't be an issue though . 
  it should n't try to close with `` 99 `` s if it succeeds a space , ' ( ' , or such ; if you 're opening a quote those are the only things that should feasibly be to the left . 
  or maybe you subconsciously wanted to learn swedish , so you switched your formatting without knowing !, 
  that would explain an influx of `` 99 `` s !, 
  it 's not that weird , it 's easy to forget if you think `` hmm , what do we use as * quotation marks * ? '' . 
  it is a ` speech line ' and not ` quotation mark ' after all . 
  and technically it should be an `` en '' - dash and not a hyphen or figure dash ( * tankstreck * \u2260 * bindestreck * ) . 
  ' -- ' is longer than ' - ' , but not quite as as long as ' -- ' . 
  i think it 's itu you 're talking about , but maybe iso also recommends it . 
  `` 66/99 '' is the correct way for english . 
  as you say most word processors auto-assigns them . 
  if you 'd write in swedish , the straight marks would also be replaced , but by `` 99/99 '' . 
  just different standards . 
  my english teacher was very adamant we must n't turn in anything with `` 99/99 '' , but people would constantly forget to change word 's language for formatting , so ... yeah . 
  straight quotation marks really only came to be since typewriters would have a limited amount of type hammers . 
  same reason you wo n't find a ' 1 ' on most typewriters , you could just use ( lower case ) ` l' , so it was a waste of valuable space having both . 
  ' 1 ' returned with computer keyboards since it 's a world difference for a computer , but you still want to minimize the amount of different keys so it makes sense to only keep that one key for quotation marks as the computer should be able to deduce it easily . 
  with regular writing your word processor should n't really have any difficulty whatsoever assigning it correctly . 
  what are you typing if word is `` often wrong '' ? 
  i 've never had that issue . 
  the only issue i 've had is forgetting to change between swedish and english formatting . 
  two cases : the standard nominative , and genitive . 
  you can also make the argument that we have three cases for pronouns , or none at all and that the genitive is n't actually an case . 
  it depends on definitions . 
  but according to svenska akademien genitive is regarded as a case and most linguist do claim those two . 
  it 's a lot simpler than german nonetheless . 
  properly it should be [ `` 99 `` s ] ( http://i.imgur.com/k1w8van.png ) on both ends , but it 's common to use straight ones on computers . 
   `` this kind '' ( or maybe < this kind  , ca n't remember exactly ) * g\u00e5s\u00f6gon * ( `` goose eyes '' ) . 
  unless you read an improperly translated book , they were probably pointing towards the text or to the right , like * '' this `` * or * '' this '' * . 
  they can frequently be found in older books like bibles or such . 
  they 're also not uncommon to use in serious texts like say judicial matters . 
  another quotation indicator we have to denote the beginning of speech are en-dashes ( -- ) . 
  they 're frequently used in novels . 
   ( firefox says ` eery ' is not a word . 
  get your shit together , firefox . 
  children know that word . ), 
  * eerie * is the way most people would spell that word . 
  i bet your firefox knows of that spelling . 
  the swedish expression refers to cayenne pepper and its homeland in the guianas , south america . 
  it comes from the early 1500s . 
  the norwegian is with all likelihood the same , quite possibly yours too . 
   i have to ask , where does the pepper grow ? 
  if it 's the same as it is in swedish ( which i 'm 99,99 ... 9 % sure it is ) [ the guianas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_guianas ) . 
  the expression comes from the early 1500s and is specifically referring to cayenne pepper . 
  guyana ( which cayenne pepper is native to ) was supposedly infamous for having a hazardous climate for europeans . 
  source : [ this old swedish etymology book . 
  you 're right . 
  do n't know how i missed that . 
  i 've added it the the list . 
  the native romani population here went to swedish schools , speak swedish , and do regular swedish jobs . 
  and the few that still retain speaking romani , speak scandoromani , a distinct para-romani language . 
  they 're swedish . 
  the recent migrants people may have issue with ( the panhandlers ) speak neither swedish nor scandoromani , do n't have swedish schooling or jobs , and panhandle . 
  they 're not integrated and are n't as much as looking to integrate . 
  and are by many seen as a thorn in the side in regards to swedish societal values . 
  panhandling did n't really exist here at all just a few years ago , now there 's one sitting outside every supermarket . 
  the two groups have about as much in common as those orange guys on jersey shore and actual italians from the boot . 
  at least that 's to my experience here in my part of sweden . 
  people are n't talking about them at all similarly . 
  the people some may complain about are `` eu-migrants '' , not `` romanis '' , `` gypsies '' , or any other word . 
  people are very cautious with that type of language in sweden , and since the native romani population are n't `` eu-migrants '' there is zero ambiguity .

  died on the scene .
