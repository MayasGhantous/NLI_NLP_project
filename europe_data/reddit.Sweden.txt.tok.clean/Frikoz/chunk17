  about 30 police officers have been killed in the line of duty in the past 100 years ( excl . 
  accidents ) . 
  edit : apparently a police officer was shot to death by a 17-year-old in 1983 too . 
  ca n't find a name and date though . 
  edit 2 : / u/ercarret 's right . 
  added fredrik wid\u00e9n . 
  we 've had pretty good success in sports like ice hockey , bandy , floorball , handball , speedway , curling , orienteering , skiing , e-sport and there 's the occasional successful athlete in tennis , table tennis , golf , swimming , and track and field, 
  i suppose you 'd purchase similar flowers and such so it does n't look completely haphazardous , but otherwise i do n't know . 
  white and light colors are usually quite prevalent . 
  but i can count the married couples i know on one hand and the ones i do know all had pretty inexpensive low-key weddings , so i do n't know . 
  wisteria is the name of a plant , the color of the same name is just a shade of violet similar to that plant 's flowers . 
  there are many other shades of color named in such manner like `` avocado '' or `` asparagus '' . 
  it 's not a spectral color like * yellow * or * green * . 
  i think that comes from the fact that he once engraved his name as `` cal gustf '' when visiting a copper mine . 
  i 've never seen any evidence of him writing `` knug '' on anything official . 
  the only thing i 've ever heard of him supposedly misspelling that , is the incident when he was young that / u/ercarret mentioned . 
  but he does have problems with his dyslexia . 
  ^ ( edit : phrasing ), 
  i do n't know , and ca n't find anything . 
  fasting , while important during the middle ages , has n't really been observed here since sweden became protestant in the 16th century . 
  the only thing we really do in somewhat relation to lent is eat [ * semlor * / * fastlagsbullar * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/semla ) on shrove tuesday . 
  but that 's not really because of lent , it 's mostly just because they 're delicious . 
  some other swedish kings ' nicknames : ** gustavus adolphus -- lejonet fr\u00e5n norden ** ( * the lion of the north * ( literally : the lion from the north/nordics ) ) ** charles xi -- gr\u00e5kappan ** ( * the grey coat * ) ; according to a legend he 'd supposedly ride around incognito wearing a grey coat to help peasantry and punish abusers of power . 
  most likely a myth . 
  ** gustav iii -- teaterkungen ** ( * the theater king * ) . 
  he lead the `` theater war '' against denmark ( called so because there were more theatrical spectacles than actual fighting going on ) , opened the royal swedish opera , and was eventually assassinated at the theater . 
  not really , but russia is the country whose military regularly infringe on our territory , who 've been found spying on us , and * have done military simulations of invading sweden * . 
  most of it 's probably just to remind us who 's holding the bigger stick but it 's better to be prepared and safe than naive and sorry . 
  russia is our only real threat . 
  so , [ this ? 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6b9ub69.png ) had to move you guys a bit north to fit too , hope you do n't mind coming a bit closer to us . 
  [ like this ? 
  something like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/awmmlop.png ) then ? 
   you can have the same discussion over `` riksdagen '' in sweden . 
  i 've seen claims of it being a proper name and needing to be capitalized . 
  but by the national news agency 's standards ( which are pretty much law ) it should be lowercase , and it is also what * riksdagen * themselves do . 
  i was just curious as * folketinget * did n't seem to do that themselves . 
  not saying you 're wrong , but how come [ they capitalize it themselves ] ( http://www.ft.dk/folketinget/arbejde_og_opgaver.aspx ) then ? 
   also , what are the reasons for reintroduction ? 
  it ca n't be good . 
  two reasons : dwindling manpower in the military and * you * . 
  ( not you personally , your country ) it 'll still be easy to get out , they have no interest in wasting time training people without motivation to be there . 
  this is more of a change of the default , it puts the effort on getting out rather than getting in . 
  just changing the default has an immense effect on numbers . 
  compare it to opt out - vs opt in-countries regarding organ donation . 
  a fermented milk drink . 
  it 's a bit like thin drinking yoghurt . 
  for * purchasing * alcoholic beverages : less than 2,25 % abv : ** none ** less than 3,5 % abv ( any store ) , and anything in open containers ( bars , restaurants ) : ** 18 ** closed containers above 3,5 % abv ( systembolaget ) : ** 20 ** there 's technically no * drinking * age . 
  as in , it 's not illegal for a person of any age to drink or even possess alcohol . 
  you 're just gon na have a difficult time doing so without someone breaking the law . 
  in private places parents or such may give in moderation . 
  yeah , i have no clue . 
  i do n't remember . 
  just how big of a water network have you guys laid down ? 
  the entirety of france is covered ? 
  here it 's pretty common with wells in rural parts , we had one at the old summer house . 
  it was , like virtually all , electric so you would n't have a chance of knowing we had one unless you saw the pump in the basement . 
  there 's really not much difference , we ran dishwashers and washing machines and everything from it . 
  it 's not like you have to pump by hand or hoist buckets nowadays . 
  * v\u00e5r kokbok * ( `` our cookbook '' ; 1951 - ) and * rutiga kokboken * ( `` the checkered cookbook '' ; 1980 - ) are probably the most common all-around cookbooks and are both at the core based around `` husmanskost '' ( traditional swedish every-day cuisine ) . 
  they 're very easy to follow . 
  i do n't really know of any cookbook just for swedish cuisine . 
   but another part of danske lov states that if a swede crosses the frozen straits ( \u00d8resund , lilleb\u00e6lt , storeb\u00e6lt , etc. ), 
  it is the duty of a dane to beat them . 
  this law is now legally `` dead '' , but there was a case some time back , where it was brought up . 
  according to rigsarkivet that law 's just a myth without any evidence of ever existing . 
  what case is it you 're talking about ? 
  when i was young it was always `` porridge in the throat '' , now all i see is potatoes . 
  what happened ?

  in latin * rooster * is ` gallus ' and * gaul * is ` gallus ' , i 'll let you do the math . 
  i think there the rooster had some biblical significance as well , but the original reason was the phonetical similarity in latin iirc . 
  the national personification is [ * mother svea * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mother_svea ) , but i ca n't remember seeing too many political cartoons about sweden . 
  our royal house also stems from jean-baptiste bernadotte ( charles xiv john ) , who was marshal of the empire under napoleon . 
   we fought out last wars against him if i remember correctly . 
  and lost , i think . 
  lost the first half , won the second . 
  we were part of the fourth ( french victory ) and sixth ( coalition victory ) coalitions . 
  we were also * involved * in the wars of the third - ( incl . 
  franco-swedish war ; french victory ) and seventh coalition ( coalition victory ) . 
  that last one rarely counts though , as we were only part of it nominally and not actively participating in any fighting . 
  our very `` last war '' was fought against norway though . 
  which ended in swedish victory and forcing them into a union with us . 
  kind of a dick move since they 'd just gained independence from denmark . 
   horrible , horrible comparisons . 
  i 'm not making any comparisons , where did you get that from ? 
  you asked for examples of affluent people throwing punches , so i 'm providing you with some . 
  none of that 's related to op 's clip . 
   the saddest thing was they had to have a police escort to go there . 
  and police had to stand away from some places so they would n't provoke them . 
  who , other than themselves , said a police escort was necessary ? 
  i have n't seen any other journalists needing police escort in those areas and i 've seen plenty of reports from them . 
  i 've been there , i sure did n't need any . 
  i do n't know what 's going on behind the scenes in that clip , but somehow you seem to . 
  how ? 
  the only information i 've been able to confirm from another source than that crew itself is : 1 . that they were there with jan sjunnesson , a swedish journalist ( who , big surprise , just so happens to have ties to the far-right ) . 
  there was a police report regarding the foot being run over . 
  it did n't go anywhere due to lack of evidence of any foul play . 
  that 's it . 
  no other instances of assault being reported to the police .
