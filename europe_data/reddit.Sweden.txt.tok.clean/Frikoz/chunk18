  no interviews with any of the attackers nor witnesses . 
  i ca n't find anything . 
  where do you get your information ? 
  and for the umpteenth time , i 'm not condoning their behavior . 
  never said i did . 
  i do not . 
  all i 'm arguing is that that clip is disingenuous and hyperbolic of the situation . 
  i 'm not even saying the areas are without issues , but i trust my own experiences better than some foreign camera crew who demonstrate clear bias from the get go . 
  it 's not normal behavior here either , in any neighborhood , anywhere . 
  that 's what i 'm saying , it is n't normal , it 's not common . 
  anyone can be punched if they 're provoking others . 
  a hostile response can quickly escalate into a physical one irregardless of the amount of money in the wallet . 
  buzz aldrin punched that annoying and disrespectful `` journalist '' , jeremy clarkson punched piers morgan for publishing a story , harold wilson ( then prime minister of the uk ) punched a journalist in the gut , benedict cumberbatch punched a journalist for offending keira knightley or something , etc. 
  they all had their reasons , some very valid ones , and they all threw punches . 
  i 'm not saying it is n't wrong and i 'm not saying anything to excuse the behavior of the guys in that clip , i do not believe it was right . 
  but there 's nothing preventing a journalist from being punched if they piss someone off just because they 're journalists , no matter if the person is rich or not . 
  358 years , 11 months , and 8 days and people still have to ask ... how many nations have fallen and emerged since ? 
  it was not meant as an excuse for their behavior , it 's not acceptable . 
  all i was saying is that there could be a reason the people in the clip are so wound up . 
  they keep repeating that they do n't want to be filmed , yet the team appears to make no effort in stopping . 
  but it may very well be that working in the industry has made me too cynical . 
  i ca n't really see how any of what i said impedes with objectiveness though . 
   nowhere in our poor neighborhoods of ljubljana are you gon na get beaten for filming . 
  then ljubljana must have wonderfully levelheaded people , props to you guys . 
  i do n't think i 'd have too difficult time to find provokable people in any of the cities i 've lived in in malta , spain , the us , and sweden . 
  and it 's not limited to poor neighborhoods , at all . 
  keep putting a camera in the face of someone who does n't want to be on camera could provoke a hostile response from people in all kinds of neighborhoods . 
  from rich to poor ; from born-and-raised to immigrant heavy ; any . 
   the what we see and what we ca n't see agrument is horrible it is indeed . 
  that 's why i was careful with distinguishing what `` they * may * very well '' have done from what is observable from the clip . 
  i was basing that on what i could hear in the clip and my personal knowledge of the industry . 
  i 'm not sure i got the point across as i intended , still not sure i have , but i was trying to objectively call it as i saw it . 
  that 's cool , i had the impression everyone down on the continent hated 17th century sweden . 
  poland with the deluge , you guys with the thirty years ' war etc. 
  is the german of that children 's song archaic , dialectal , slang , poetic , or something ? 
  i really do n't recognize those inflections from school ... 
  i do think i 've managed to deduce the gist of it :  the swedes have come , taken everything , broken windows , [ something about lead ? 
  ] , poured bullets , and shot everyone/farmers . 
  i thought * gott mit uns * was already a well established saying and that 's why gustavus adolphus used it as field word . 
  you mean he popularize it ? 
   are certain parts of sweden actually like this due to migration or is there a greater underlying problem ? 
  it 's not . 
  i 've never seen anything even close to that video , and i visit one of the `` worst '' ones frequently . 
  there are areas with higher percentage of immigration , like every country has . 
  and , yes , tbh there as some issues that are more concentrated to those areas , but they 're not some kind of no-go zones as is being reported . 
  but a biased 2 minute video is a piss poor representation of what 's going on and we have no idea what happened behind the camera . 
  in that very clip you can hear the guy throwing something say `` do n't fucking film me '' , and yet they are , and keep , pointing the camera straight at him and holding the boom above him . 
  i do n't know many who would take too kindly to such disrespect . 
  and that 's what was aired , we do n't know what was left on the cutting room floor . 
  they may very well have deliberately provoked a response , in the very least they facilitated one . 
   is there actually areas in the country that police refuse to enter due to it being so bad ? 
  sweden 's not worse than it was 10 years ago . 
  it 's not the utopia some seem to imagine , no country is , but it sure as hell is n't a hellhole . 
  he seems to sit on the coat of arms of krostitz itself too . 
  apparently he stayed there prior to breitenfeld in 1631 . 
  no wonder he liked it , breitenfeld could n't have gone much better and was what put him on the map . 
  but is he regarded highly in that region ? 
  i know there were quite a few german protestant states sweden fought alongside in the 30 years ' war , but all i 've ever heard from germany about that war seem to portray sweden as evil itself . 
  they put null signs in the middle of words , does that sort of behavior sound sane to you ? 
  it is . 
  most of the names ikea has for their foodstuff are pretty much exactly what it 's called in swedish . 
  yeah , shocking . 
  i 'm not used to it . 
  our media also takes some liberties when it comes to the truth in order to sell a story , but nothing as blatant as that . 
  same in swedish with `` och-tecken '' . 
  * och * = and ; * tecken * = sign , symbol . 
  although the proper name is `` et-tecken '' ( * et * being the latin ligature it originates from ) . 
  i 've also seen slightly weirder `` snabel-och '' . 
  * snabel * meaning ` trunk ' ( of an elephant ) . 
  i think that name comes from imitating the @ - symbol , which is called `` snabel-a '' in swedish , because it looks like an ` a ' with a trunk . 
  mercedes : merca/mersa ( ` rc ' / ` rs ' pronounced as a ` sh ' ) volkswagen : folkvagn ( but that 's really just a translation from german ) mini : hundkoja ( `` dog house '' ), 
  suiweden sounds weird . 
  would n't suiden or something suffice ? 
  trump * knows * his supporters wo n't . 
  and if anyone actually disproves it he just dismisses it as `` no , * you * are wrong . 
  you 're fake news '' , `` i 'm right . 
  lots of people believe i 'm right '' , or '' [ i was given that information , i do n't know , ] ( https://youtu.be/w5frum-ak9k?t=32m31s ) i do n't care '' . 
  even middle schooler 's who copy-pastes wikipedia have better excuses . 
  more likely it comes from a reportage fox news aired friday about immigration to sweden . 
  it 's well known trump gets a lot of his information from television news reports and then regurgitates it without any fact-checking and the timing fits . 
  from what i saw of it , the report was riddled in inaccuracies , data taken out of context , and a few blatant lies . 
  honestly it 's quite shocking what airs on fox * news * , there was n't even the faintest attempt at even appearing unbiased . 
  it 's a loanword that comes from the english ` cakes ' . 
  ` cakes ' \u2260 ` shakes ' , how hard can it be ? 
  hard k for life !, 
  it 's the same for swedish . 
  well , except that ` er ' is ' \u00e4r ' . 
  i love phrases like those , but it 's better when they 're not completely unrealistic and nonsensical ones like the `` james while john had had had ... '' or `` buffalo buffalo ... '' . 
  -- * `` far , f\u00e5r f\u00e5r f\u00e5r ? 
  '' * is also a perfectly valid question in swedish ( i 'm guessing the other scandinavian languages too ? ) . 
  ` f\u00e5r ' is both a verb meaning ` get ' and a noun meaning ` sheep ' . 
  it means `` father , do sheep get sheep ( as offspring ) ? '', 
  the answer to which is obviously * `` nej , inte f\u00e5r f\u00e5r f\u00e5r , f\u00e5r f\u00e5r lamm . 
  '' * ( `` no , sheep do n't get sheep , sheep get lambs . 
  in the swedish translation he 's * tom gus mervolo dolder * to make the anagram work ... in latin !, 
  ( ego sum lord voldemort ) probably because `` i am '' in swedish would include an ' \u00e4 ' , which does n't really fit the otherwise english name . 
  when i was young i thought it was in latin in all languages , it 's classier that way . 
  but no , all translations are different : some change the name , some change the anagram . 
  in swedish six and sex are exactly the same , * sex * . 
  to be in `` group 6 '' on group assignments is always a favorite among middle schoolers .
