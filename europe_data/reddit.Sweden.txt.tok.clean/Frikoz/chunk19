  also whenever there 's six of something like `` 6 addicts '' . 
  it does n't really work in correct writing as ` group sex ' should be compounded as ` gruppsex ' , while ` group six ' is ` grupp sex ' etc. 
  although , `` s\u00e4rskrivning '' is rampant and `` idiots ' spaces '' are everywhere . 
  i pronounce the letters individually , but they can kind of blend together for me . 
  ` u ' and ` a ' are both vowels and their `` names '' are the same as their pronunciation in swedish , there 's none of those weird `` yu '' / `` ey '' - * ish * pronunciations english has . 
  's ' is pronounced `` ess '' , but my dialect kind of merges subsequent vowels , so if i speak casually the ` u ' and `` e '' may become one . 
  so while i say u-s-a , it may sound like a single word to an untrained ear . 
  it does n't sound like how i 'd pronounce `` usa '' , but it may sound more like an acronym than an initialism . 
  i most definitely am not !, 
  i mean [ snus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/snus ) . 
  snus is put under the lip and passively released and swallowed . 
  no chewing , no spitting . 
  but you can see the differences from other products on that wiki-page . 
  and if you use american `` snus '' , you should really try some proper scandinavian !, 
  they 're quite different , ours is healthier and all around better ( totally not biased ) . 
  yours have just highjacked the name and put it on a far inferior product . 
   -- anyway , here 's what the eu says :  member states shall prohibit the placing on the market of tobacco for oral use , without prejudice to article 151 of the act of accession of austria , finland and sweden . 
  from what i read ` oral use ' does n't include products that are chewed or inhaled , but does cover moist snuff and snus . 
  that article mentioned of our accession into the union basically protects snus as an important cultural thing to sweden . 
  so it 's legal to sell for us , and only us . 
  it 's banned for the same reason a lot of foodstuff and materials are : it 's really quite unhealthy . 
  and since it 's not used much outside of scandinavia it could , unlike cigarettes and such , be banned . 
  although , it is actually slightly less harmful than cigarettes , but that 's not very difficult to be . 
  banning stuff is n't bad , you do n't want asbestos and such everywhere . 
  ** tl ; dr ** nope , i did n't mean chew . 
  i meant ` snus ' , our pride and joy . 
  yes and no . 
  they used oversee all things swedish , but now that 's done by * spr\u00e5kv\u00e5rdsgruppen * , a cooperative group of a bunch of different organizations that meet a few times a year ( * svenska akademien * is part of this ) . 
  * spr\u00e5kv\u00e5rdsgruppen * also has other organizations like * terminologicentrum tnc * who are responsible for regulating terminology and jargon , and * kotus * ( finland 's institute ) who keep track of fenno-swedish etc. 
  * svenska akademien * is an free-standing organization and are as you say important for publishing dictionaries and describing the language , but they 're in a way the last step in the process . 
  so in a way they 're standardizing the language in that they publish what 's law , but at the same time they 're not . 
  it 's complicated . 
  ** tl ; dr ** swedish used to be in the hands of * svenska akademien * , now it 's a collaboration . 
  you probably had a similar sentiment the first time you tried coffee . 
  it 's popular for the same reason cigarettes are popular . 
  trying a cigarette for the first time , all it will do is make you cough ; try snus and it makes your lips numb . 
  but once you get used to it , you get addicted . 
  then add the fact that snus has an increased popularity due to being a replacement for cigarettes , as it is slightly less harmful and a lot more convenient than smoking . 
  smoking rates in sweden are among the lowest in europe partially because of snus . 
  a log of * snus * maybe . 
  it 's illegal in the eu ( except here ) , and i think it 's more expensive in norway . 
  not very popular elsewhere in the world . 
  and a can of * surstr\u00f6mming * ( our infamous fermented fish ) may prove difficult to find in most countries . 
  as for what 's cheaper elsewhere , there 's a lot . 
  alcohol 's a big one , that 's why we go to denmark and germany . 
  * korv * is just swedish for ` sausage ' . 
  are you talking about some specific type of sausage ? 
  pretty sure it 's `` hel - / halv special '' everywhere , at least that 's what it was called where i grew up too . 
  but when i grew up that meant you got the mashed potatoes next to the hotdog . 
  same thing otherwise , with two/one sausage ( s ) in a bun . 
  i 'd question the sanity of anyone doing that . 
  who 'd even think of such a thing ? 
  where did you find that etymology ? 
  the old norse * kol * means coal and it 's the same in swedish . 
  it 's only `` kull '' in bokm\u00e5l norwegian . 
  we have a * kull * meaning litter ( as in a litter of animals ) . 
  a second , unrelated , * kull * is an adverb that refers to a change of position and is almost always used in a compound such as `` omkull '' . 
  to fall * over * = att falla * omkull * . 
  a third , also unrelated , * kull * is dialect for * kulle * meaning hill . 
  but the game comes from the completely unrelated dialectal verb to `` kulla '' , which means to lightly punch or hit . 
  in sweden it 's not . 
  potatoes , green peas , and b\u00e9chamel sauce with mustard , allspice , or black pepper ( depending on region ) is the traditional way to eat it in sweden . 
  in j\u00e4mtland they also eat it on flat bread with brown cheese . 
  but there 's none of that bacon stuff anywhere to my knowledge . 
  and stop claiming our dishes as yours !, 
  lutfisk is rightfully swedish !, 
  i do n't know where you 've been eating , but if i order a simple `` korv med br\u00f6d '' i expect a simple sausage in a bun with mustard and possibly ketchup . 
  if it comes with any other stuff it should have another name . 
  we do however get the sausage * in * the bun and not beside it , that 's just weird . 
  and if it is that danish ` r\u00f8d p\u00f8lse ' you want , they 're usually called ` p\u00f8\u0308lse ' or something and not ` korv ' . 
  never in my life have i encountered a `` dansk korv med br\u00f6d '' , but that may be different wherever you 've been . 
  as for the hotdog with mashed potatoes , that stems from the pre-hotdog bun days when the sausage was served with mashed potatoes . 
  when the buns made a breakthrough people missed the potatoes so they 'd give some on the side . 
  why some weirdos put the mashed potatoes on top the sausage and not beside it like normal , i do not know . 
   some people tend to believe that a stands for `` avlopp '' , which is suer . 
  but that 's not true , a and k are markings for different manufacturers , a for `` alvetsa '' and k for `` karlstads gjuteri '' . 
  no no , it 's both . 
  the letters originally signified the manufacturers , yes , but several places started using `` k `` s for * kombinerad * ( spill - och dagvatten ) and `` a `` s for * avlopp * . 
  as such , they can mean either thing today . 
  iirc neither alvesta - nor karlstad 's foundry even exist anymore . 
  and i think you meant `` sewer '' . 
  a ` suer ' is something else . 
   pj\u00e4tt / kull/tage ( and a bunch of *** other *** regional names for essentially the game of tag ) those three are dialectal too . 
  the `` proper '' name you 'll find as the main entry in dictionaries , encyclopedias and such is * tafatt * ( sometimes spelled ` tagfatt ' ) . 
  ` datt ' or ` datten ' is best though , anyone who tells you otherwise is definitely wrong . 
  we have both `` maffia '' and `` varulv '' in sweden . 
  some characters change name depending on version , but yeah , it 's the same game . 
  the swedish * kull * comes from a dialectal word for a ` light punch ' which itself does n't have any record until 1878 . 
  the oldest attested record of it as an alternative name for the game is only about 100 years old and it is dialectal for stockholm . 
  sure , you may have borrowed it , but it 's not very old for swedish . 
  far younger than any substantial swedish influence in estonia . 
  it is mostly for the kids and some of the more playful grandparents may join . 
  the parents mostly stand by the side and watch , unless their child is to shy to go to the pole by themselves . 
  it 's not really common for a bunch of sober adults to have it if there are n't any children present in my experience . 
  the exception is if it 's a party without kids and everyone 's drunk out of their minds , then people may do it because drunk people do weird shit . 
  but , yeah , it 's only midsummer once a year . 
  it 's not everyday you 're allowed to pretend to be a frog without being sent to a mental institution . 
  so why not ? 
  the usual lyrics is really just the first half of the video you linked . 
  you may then switch to `` sm\u00e5 grisarna '' ( little pigs ) which is the same thing really except that they , contrary to the frogs , * do * have both ears and tail .
