  these are really quite weird and have plenty of errors , at least for sweden . 
  take the map of `` major cities '' . 
  it includes the tiniest of villages like slussfors , bergn\u00e4sviken , and parkajoki . 
  they have populations of less than 100 . 
  about as far from `` major cities '' as possible . 
  and the map over airports is pretty much useless . 
  it 's way too sparse , it does n't even include landvetter , the second busiest airport in sweden . 
  and the placement of for example lidk\u00f6ping-hovby is way , * way * off . 
  lidk\u00f6ping 's a fair bit north-east of gothenburg , not in malm\u00f6 . 
  all i 've been discussing is that obama was n't awarded the nobel prize for being black . 
  that has nothing to do with the us . 
  it has to do with norwegians and their norwegian values since they 're the ones that award it . 
  i 'm not gon na get into a debate over human labelling , the totally homogeneous scandinavia vs the mighty diverse us , or the significance of things like the one-drop rule . 
  that 's not what i 'm discussing . 
  i 'm talking about obama and nobel . 
   mixed race which is a term i 've never in my life have heard here ...  muslim immigrant background kenya is a christian country if anything . 
  obama sr. was n't a `` muslim immigrant '' , he was a self-proclaimed * christian * from the age of six and later turned atheist ... 
  besides , obama ( jr. ) grew up with his mother and religion is n't stored in the dna . 
   raised partly in indonesia he did indeed for four years . 
  but he does n't even speak indonesian fluently . 
   fetish for the diversity-focused part of the political spectrum maybe in the us , but not here . 
  and that 's my point . 
  it was the * norwegian * , not american , nobel committee awarded the prize . 
  `` scandinavians '' did n't award him jack shit for being `` black '' . 
  no no , i know i 'm generalizing . 
  there are always going to be a few that care about something . 
  and i meant it was n't of significance for the nobel committee . 
   there 's no need to be defensive i 'm not . 
  i 'm just trying to explain the difference between a nobel committee and random activists . 
   but to say race has no significance in scandinavian politics is equally untrue . 
  accusations of racism are nearly as common as in the us . 
  racism as in immigrant/native , sure . 
  not racism as in black/white , skin color is n't of significance . 
  that 's what i meant , the original definition of racism , regarding so called `` human races '' . 
  a few things : 1 . 
  that 's a movement that 's been ridiculed just for being blindly imported from the us without any basis in swedish society . 
  that 's an insignificant fringe movement , not a nobel committee . 
  that 's sweden , not norway . 
  we award all the other nobel prizes , but not the peace prize . 
  that video 's uploaded by feministiskt initiativ , they survive on creating controversy from nothing . 
  other things they 've done includes things like burning 100000 sek in the street , instead of actually putting them to use . 
  obama brought a hope of more humanitarian politics , which was seen as a positive change for the `` world 's leading spokesman '' to spread . 
  of course they 're going to care about someone who says `` now is the time for all of us to take our share of responsibility for a global response to global challenges '' and put the emphasis on a humanitarian world . 
  no , he had n't really made any extraordinary effort , that 's why the decision was questioned and ridiculed . 
  he had made promises and was promoting those ideals . 
  race is n't of any significance at all , none . 
  we do n't care about that as the us does . 
  no , he got it because of * the norwegian nobel committee * . 
  it was questioned and ridiculed here in scandinavia too . 
  and the official reasoning was `` for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples '' ( [ full reasoning here ] ( http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2009/press.html ) ) , which many equated to `` not being gwb '' . 
  it had nothing to do with race whatsoever . 
  it 's a ` saab 29 ' a.k.a. 
  `` flygande tunnan '' ( `` the flying barrel '' ) . 
  do n't know anything about it being the ` greatest of all time ' but it was fast and very agile . 
  it set a few speed records in its day , and was a pretty effective fighter aircraft . 
  also , it looks pretty cute . 
  dude , you 're telling the guy with * scanian * flair to go to malm\u00f6 ... gee , i wonder who knows malm\u00f6 best : the guy who ( based on comment history ) seems to live 10 minutes from malm\u00f6 or you , who i can guarantee with 99 % certainty never has even been there . 
  * perception * of media bias . 
  it 's about how people perceive their country 's media , not how biased the media may or may not be . 
  do you know how confused i was the first time i heard of * boxing day * ? 
  i thought families were beating each other up . 
  i mean , i can understand the sentiment after christmas with the family , but it feels a bit extreme ... 
  the pitch accent you 're talking about is n't really related to the difference between * ide * and * id\u00e9 * , that 's just a matter of stress . 
  but , if you did n't know , most varieties of finland-swedish do n't actually have the pitch accent . 
   though the swedes are sneaky bastards because sometimes they have words that sound the same but mean completely different things most languages have homonyms , mate !, 
  english has plenty too . 
  yeah , i also heard that occasionally in sm\u00e5land growing up . 
  same word really , one 's just different inflections . 
  i just stuck to what was included on the map . 
  sure , we do . 
  but they speak about as easy swedish as there is . 
  it 's very slow , well articulated , and does n't have any difficult words . 
  it 's honestly as easy to understand as standard swedish . 
  it does n't help at all with understanding the more difficult dialects found in finland . 
  true . 
  it probably should 've been included in parentheses as it is for some other countries . 
  dunno if it 's excluded because it 's only ever used for loanwords ( mostly french ) and names , or something like that . 
  but that 's probably also true for some of those other languages that do have stuff in parentheses on the map . 
  yeah , i know . 
  not like we had many channels either , but yeah , we did have two until ' 88 . 
  it 's all about exposure , if you 'd start listening to some swedish show/podcast/whatever a few times a week , you 'd learn to understand it perfectly in no time . 
  the languages are close enough , it is really just a matter of getting used to it . 
  no need to be sorry about not knowing stuff , mate . 
  ca n't blame someone for not knowing , that 'd be silly . 
  they 're dialectal/outdated words , not exactly common knowledge . 
  but now you know for the next time children 's games ' etymology comes up in conversation !, 
  no no , it 's just what some people i 've talked to thought i said when i said `` kyrkog\u00e5rden '' in my dialect . 
  if you feel up for making the map you can find data from 6000 people [ here ] ( http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=411&amp;artikel=770178 ) . 
  but `` mula '' is the most common in almost all regions , from lappland to sk\u00e5ne . 
  not true , they 're all dialectal and/or archaic . 
  `` pj\u00e4tt '' and `` kull '' both comes from dialectal words for `` light punch '' . 
  `` datten/tatten '' comes from the old dialectal `` datt '' meaning `` thrust '' . 
  `` tagen/tafatt/tage ... '' comes from the expression `` taga fatt '' , meaning `` grab ahold '' or `` catch up '' . 
  `` jaga/jage '' means `` hunt '' . 
  it 's an old dialectal word for a light punch or hit . 
  it was originally only a dialectal name for the game to stockholm , but as anything related to stockholm it 's spread . 
   what is this game called in finnish ? 
  my finnish friends call it `` hippa '' , but i do n't know if that 's ubiquitous, 
  correct , * fennoscandia * would n't include those . 
  and it does include parts of russia .
