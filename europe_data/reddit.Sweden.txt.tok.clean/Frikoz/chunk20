  that 's it really , it 's not a long song . 
  i do hope you learned the dance as well ? 
  you have to do the dance . 
  but what 's surreal about it ? 
  do n't you have any silly children 's songs in poland ? 
  do n't know about most competent , that 's difficult to rate and they were all very competent , but probably most famous . 
  he 's accredited for spearheading the invention of the v-2 rocket , then leading the team behind the redstone rocket , and overseeing a bunch of other stuff . 
  but they all did stuff , many became directors of their own branches . 
  there were n't many branches of the us rocket program without a german in charge . 
  and just to clarify , nasa was n't really * founded * by germans , they just ran a lot of it . 
  because no one did rocketry quite like the germans in the mid-1900s . 
  a lot of countries are great at engineering . 
  germany 's reputation comes from several things . 
  lots of people = large workforce and large pool to draw great engineers from . 
  early adaptors and great emphasis on education and making it universally accessible . 
  good quality control across the board , whereas many other countries had some independent shoddy companies lowering the impression of said country 's product quality . 
  `` made in germany '' , was therefore a mark denoting `` great quality '' . 
  `` germanic '' work ethics : you go to work to work , not to socialize etc. 
  but , yes , germany certainly has an amazing history in engineering . 
  but i do n't have any , so do n't you put this on me . 
  but if i did , who would i give it to ? 
   and ofc [ this gem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxut5trtiwa ) - like wtf sverige - how can this be one of your national songs ? 
  brutal do n't know what would make it a ` national song ' , it 's just a traditional song for kids and drunk people for midsummer celebrations . 
  it comes from a [ french military march ] ( https://youtu.be/ye70jrhorjk?t=25s ) . 
  the britons did n't think it was very imposing for some unknown reason , and condescendingly made fun of them changing the lyrics to ` au pas , grenouilles ' . 
  somehow that ended up in sweden and became a child - and drunk people favorite . 
  but you ca n't just listen to it , you have to do the dance , ~ ~ preferably ~ ~ drunk !, 
  that version you linked is weird though . 
  they 've added lyrics i 've never even heard before . 
  hats and pants , wtf is that about ? 
  ears and tails , and then you switch to pigs . 
  over 1600 germans scientists and engineers were brought over for operation paperclip . 
  many of which continued to nasa when that was founded in '58 and even more joined later . 
  the list goes on and on , the germans * made * nasa ... essentially . 
  that is true . 
  but if i were to play the devil 's advocate , i 'd say it 's not as much as ` refusing ' to give it back , as it is logistically difficult to do so . 
  - it 's over 360 years ago , both victims and offenders have been gone for generations . 
  the lines of inheritance are long broken , so who 's the rightful owner of today ? 
  with neither people nor country in a direct line of inheritance , who do you `` give it * back * '' to ? 
  there is no `` back '' . 
  if you die , and i take your television for a while , what gives your completely unrelated countryman any claim to it ? 
  of course one can argue it 's not rightfully mine , but whose is it ? 
  - and since the offenders are long gone , how can it be forced on today 's swedes ? 
  is it right for someone in 350 years to pay for a crime you commit today ? 
  the state of sweden does n't own them , they 're in the hands of museums and private collectors , all who 've acquired them legally . 
  a fair share have been donated back in good faith , but there 's no compensation for doing it . 
  and the state ca n't force the current owner to do so . 
  would you give up your house for free because someone came and made a claim the plot of land was stolen sixteen generations ago ? 
  - how do we even know which items were stolen and which were received legally ? 
  sweden and poland-lithuania did trade . 
  60 years before the deluge we were even in a personal union . 
  - and a lot of the items have also been lost with time . 
  so while `` most of these items have never been returned to poland '' is technically correct , it 's impossible to return them as they no longer exist . 
  a fair share has been donated in good faith , but it 's not possible to do that with `` most '' since they 're gone . 
  now i 'm not saying it 's right , the deluge is undoubtedly one of the darkest things about my country 's past , but how would you go about returning things ? 
  it 's not just a matter of `` here , you take it '' or ` refusing ' to do so . 
  how can a legal owner of an item be forced to give it away without compensation , and to whom ? 
  not really any outright threats , but the occasional military aircraft and submarine infringes on our territory . 
  there really is n't any legitimate excuse for them being there other than showing off their guns . 
  they 've also simulated nuclear attacks on sweden and such in war games . 
  ^ ( ^ edit : ^ typo ), 
  ca n't say i 've ever heard of such a thing , no . 
  we have a similar thing here since historically the populated parts were * effectively * disconnected in a similar way . 
  but when we 're talking about it , it 's ` down on '' * the continent * '' ' never `` europe '' . 
  we always see ourselves part of `` europe '' , but not part of `` the continent '' . 
  that refers to the historical ` mainland europe ' , the landmass traversable without boats . 
  edit : just to add , the swedish definition of ` continent ' is n't exactly the same as english . 
  ` europe ' is never a `` kontinent '' in swedish , it 's a `` v\u00e4rldsdel '' ( world-part ) . 
  ` eurasia ' is a `` kontinent '' . 
  so there is n't any ambiguity with ` europe ' being a continent . 
  the largest dictionary is probably `` svenska akademiens ordbok '' . 
  work on it started 1786 , but it 's still not complete . 
  they are now 37 volumes in but have eight letters left to go through . 
  i think it has about 500000 words now . 
  that 's honestly a lot better than i expected , thought i 'd butchered the spelling completely . 
  it was like 10 years ago i learned it from a classmate from greenland . 
  but yeah , that is all what i thought i said . 
  ` asavakkit ' is however less similar to ` akvavit ' than i remember ... og godt svensk !, 
  qujan is all i can say , unless i was lied to and it 's just bullshit . 
  and i 'm pretty sure i misspelled some things though . 
  `` i love you '' also remind me of ` akvavit ' , but i ca n't remember exactly what it was . 
  ` asakvakit ' or something ? 
  the thirty years ' war started in 1618 , 399 years ago . 
  martin luther wrote the 95 theses exactly 500 years ago , so there were n't many protestants to be unfriendly towards . 
  they do not . 
  cze\u015b\u0107 to you too , kolega !, 
  thanks . 
  haha , touch\u00e9 . 
  i was really just pulling your leg  you are correct . 
  but why do you even call it `` swede '' anyway ? 
  you could 've just used our word instead of naming it the exact same thing as us . 
  the americans managed to do that , even if they somehow got a weird dialectal word . 
  unlike them you could just use the normal `` k\u00e5lrot '' . 
  `` k\u00e5l '' means ` cabbage ' , so if you find the letter ' \u00e5 ' too difficult just call it `` cabbage rot '' . 
  much better . 
   ^ ( ( edit : ` rot ' means ` root ' , if you for some reason wondered what k\u00e5lrot acually meant . 
  it 's `` cabbage-root '' . 
   the corsican constitution is the oldest constitution in the world depends on definitions . 
  `` constitution '' simply means `` constitution '' , and there are as many different definitions as there are countries . 
  the first thing that cam be referred to as the `` constitution of sweden '' came in 1634 for example and i 'm sure there are older than that .
