  but that was different from the four `` fundamental laws '' we now have that are called `` constitution '' in english . 
  then there are unwritten constitutions like for the uk , which are understandably difficult to date etc. 
  the oldest modern , written , all-encompassing , single-document constitution or something maybe . 
  but that is n't as catchy . 
  wait , what ... ? 
  pedantically a ' * swede * ' is a turnip , a ' * swede * ' ca n't be one unless it 's at the beginning of the sentence . 
  and that 's the power of proper capitalization !, 
  * swede * is the noun , * swedish * is just an adjective unless you 're talking about the language . 
  yup . 
  one theory is that it comes from how the smurfs would react to things simultaneously and thusly do say things at the same time , but no one really knows for sure where it came from . 
  i 'm replying about the ` zollstock ' , never as much as mentioned a swedish name . 
  if anything those same arguments could be said in german , where the ` meterstab ' , ` gliederma\u00dfstab ' , and such also exist . 
  tumstock = zollstock , meterstock = meterstab etc. 
  so it can most definitely be said that it 's common for a `` zollstock '' to have inches in sweden , no matter what nomenclature you have in swedish . 
  but just for the record the definitions i grew up with and know : tumstock = a folding rule . 
  its units of measurement does n't matter , it can have either one or both ; meterstock = a measuring stick in metric . 
  can be both foldable or not ; m\u00e5ttstock = a measuring stick . 
  neither foldability nor units matter . 
   outside of the us , i 've never seen a zollstock that has inches . 
  it 's common in sweden . 
  i do n't know anyone who ever uses the inches , but they 're usually there . 
  that dispute really ended with the league of nation 's decision in 1921 , which sweden reluctantly agreed to . 
  while there were some tensions between the nations until the mid - '30s , sweden has n't ever made any claim to \u00c5land since the ln solution , to my knowledge . 
  most \u00c5landers were however still pro-sweden after the solution . 
  but that sentiment pretty much disappeared with sweden 's choice of neutrality during wwii , which many \u00c5landers took as sweden abandoning them . 
  since then there has n't been any real argument for \u00c5land becoming part of sweden . 
  if you 're going to find any arguing regarding \u00c5land today , it 's probably got more to do with its special status within finland and the issue of languages . 
  but that has nothing to do with sweden , only finland . 
  oh , of course , m\u00e4rket . 
  yes , you 're right . 
  https://np.reddit.com/r/outoftheloop/comments/5rg2bd/whats_happening_in_romania_right_now/ ^ ( tl ; dr : some politicians sidestepped the system and decriminalized being corrupt . 
  people protest . ), 
  norway left the union in 1905 . 
  that was a personal union though and the borders of the sweden proper did n't change so maybe it does n't count . 
  the last change to the sweden proper was when russia took finland in 1809 i think . 
  no , i 'm afraid not . 
  it 's bj\u00f6rn ( swedish/icelandic ) or bj\u00f8rn ( norwegian/danish/faroese ) . 
  \u00d6 and \u00d8 are really the same thing . 
  '' * frida * '' ) * agnetha * spells her name with an ` h ' , but many swedes would probably get that wrong too . 
  the ` h ' is silent and does n't affect pronunciation in swedish , it 's just an alternative spelling . 
  * bj\u00f6rn * should be spelled with an ' \u00f6 ' , but maybe you do n't have that easily available on your keyboard . 
   it lasted from 1600 's and ended in early 1700 's just to specify , it 's typically 1611-1718 . 
  from the ascension of gustavus adolphus to the death of charles xii . 
  some argue it started in 1630 with sweden 's intervention of the * thirty years ' war * and some argue it ended in 1721 with the actual end of the * great northern war * , but most sources will claim 1611-1718 . 
  difficult to know who pledged allegiance and not before , but one * supposedly * did espionage for the danish king before ( according to a letter or something my great uncle had , but that 's been lost in the past 70 years ) . 
  but we 're talking about `` insignificant '' people in the 16th/17th century , followed by a century of persecution and destruction of everything danish , so there is n't much to go by . 
  you 're lucky if you manage to find a name and birth/death date in a church registry . 
  they may very well have done it in defiance , i do n't know . 
  no one does and no one can without a time machine . 
  and that 's the annoying part of genealogy , all the open ends . 
  the most significant thing about our pirate party is having inspired all other ones . 
  they have no seat in any parliament , county council , or municipality . 
  their best result was the election for the european parliament in 2009 in which they got one seat ( +1 after the lisbon treaty ) . 
  they did n't repeat that success in 2014 . 
  they received less than 0,5 % of the votes in the last national election . 
  it was n't as much a wave of danish support encroaching on swedish territory , as it was being a proud danish family finding themselves living in a very hostile sweden all of the sudden . 
  they lived in scania , which was danish until 1658 . 
  after it became swedish it was subject to a rather extreme swedification . 
  it was pretty much a witch hunt of anything danish that makes the trail of tears look happy ( that maybe a hyperbole , but it was pretty bad ) . 
  but yeah , a few of my relatives did have to pay with their lives . 
  broken on the wheel and impaled , helluva way to go . 
  maybe , but you ca n't know without doing some genealogy . 
  and if you were to go back 240 years i 'm not so sure that 90 % is accurate for every branch of your family . 
  but even if it happens to be in the same region does n't mean it 's not interesting . 
  i 've got relatives in the 16th-17th century who swore allegiance to the danish king , even if that branch of my family tree lived in the same area for hundreds of years . 
  europe has changed a lot over the centuries . 
  and you can ask pretty much the same questions . 
  just like for people on the other side of the pond , the answer is n't always interesting . 
  but often it is . 
  at least that 's my experience doing genealogy myself , but i do n't know , maybe i have the most interesting ancestry in europe . 
  that 's not exclusive to the new world , it 's the same here . 
  you ca n't know whether the answer is interesting or not without looking into it , can you ? 
   i would decline , since making new categories would break with the will of nobel the economics prize has already broken that for you . 
  even if it 's technically a `` prize in memory of alfred nobel '' rather than `` nobel prize '' , it is referred to as such by most and is awarded at the same time with the same rewards as the others . 
  why would we ? 
  if it was only awarded to swedes , it would n't be notable whatsoever . 
  if anything sweden is overrepresented . 
  we 're in fifth place with 30 laureates , in a country of 10 million people . 
  the only four countries with more laureates is the us , uk , germany , and france , compare their population size to ours ...  also do you resent alfred nobel was ` shamed ' into giving the peace prize after inventing dynamite ? 
  ask the norwegians , that 's their nobel prize , not ours . 
  we award all but that one . 
  but no , why the hell would i. . . ? 
  it is . 
  but not very common in my experience . 
  most flags that are burned are burned because that 's the proper way of disposing them . 
  granted , if it 's someone else 's flag it 's of course damage of property , if the fire spreads it can be arson , reckless endangerment etc. 
  so you may break other laws in the process , but there 's nothing illegal about the flag burning itself . 
   american anti-abortion supported ( * allegedly * ) swedish maternity nurse i 'm pretty sure it 's been proven , not just alleged , that adf provided both judicial and economic support . 
  and there 's two nurses in two different cases , one in j\u00f6nk\u00f6ping , one in s\u00f6rmland . 
  hey now , it 's fermented , not rotten . 
  same thing as when baking bread or making wine really , except smellier . 
  yup . 
  they weigh half a ton and that mass is centered very high . 
  if you crash into a car the crumple zone in the front takes most of the damage , crash into a moose and the bulk of their weight goes straight for your windshield . 
  as you can see on that image , the front of the car is relatively undamaged since all it got was the legs . 
  in many ways it can be preferable to crash into a car than a moose . 
  not that i recommend either . 
  grew up in south sweden . 
  i 'd assume we may have learned more about `` us '' , than the average swede , but not really the samis . 
  it 's not like they 've had much to do with southern sweden ...
