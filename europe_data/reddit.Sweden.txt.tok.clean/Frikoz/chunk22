  but it might also differ from school to school , i do n't know . 
  i really ca n't remember learning barely anything about the pre-viking northern europe in school ... no stone age , no bronze , no iron ; nothing . 
  when i went to school , we were taught rather extensively about the samis in 5th ~ 6th grade sometime . 
  and we spent a significant time focusing on sweden 's involvement in wwii in secondary school . 
  if anything i think the railway situation etc. 
  tend to be overemphasized . 
  in primary school we were pretty much taught how we helped the nazis occupy norway , when in reality sweden refused the movement of anything military ( despite bribes and threats of invasion ) until months after norway was undisputedly captured . 
  i ca n't say it was `` only quickly acknowledged '' , at least not where i went to school . 
  the part of the history of sweden i felt most overlooked when i went to school was probably everything pre-gustav vasa . 
  we were taught a ton about the swedish empire , but not much about the kalmar union , middle ages , and vikings . 
  in case you want to increase the difficulty and learn words from a few other languages : hotell hotell hotell hotell hotelli h\u00f3tel h\u00f4tel otel, 
  it 's a cute mixture of scandinavian you 've got though . 
  ` deg ' is norwegian ( or swedish if it 's really dough that you love ) and ending the verb with - ar is swedish . 
  just in case you did n't know : dj\u00e4vla does n't work that well on its own since it 's an adjective/adverb . 
  you need something for it to describe . 
  but if you add an '' - r '' you get the plural of the noun ( dj\u00e4vlar ) , which can be used as an interjection . 
  edit : i guess i should add that the `` d '' i use is optional and by no means necessary . 
  oh , it does n't make any sense , anywhere really . 
  it 's probably more of a thought experiment . 
  just in case you did n't realize : the map is based on areas of similar population , which are just named after something somewhat fitting . 
  it 's not created with cultural areas in mind . 
  i 'd go with all of the nordic countries , we 're all pretty similar . 
  narrower definition could be scandinavia with the swedish speaking parts of finland . 
  do n't live there , but iirc yes , many places do . 
  and i know some of the large chains do as well , e.g. 
  h&m . would n't recommend anyone using euros though , the prices will not work in your favor . 
  very uncommon . 
  do n't think any swede ever would , but i suppose a few tourists/border-crossing finns might . 
  most places probably do n't even accept it , and the ones that do use high exchange rates to cover their bases . 
  we do . 
  99 % sure i 've seen it being sold in the uk and spain too . 
  do n't know how popular it is in those places though . 
  hey now , when did i say we wanted sk\u00e5ne ? 
  they 've had 359 years to learn the bloody language and still have n't . 
  just take it , it 's yours . 
  and i do n't know why you want some old rocks in a ruin , but you can have those too i suppose . 
  ^ ^ \\ ( honestly , ^ ^ this ^ ^ comment ^ ^ does n't ^ ^ make ^ ^ much ^ ^ sense ^ ^ considering ^ ^ my ^ ^ very ^ ^ own ^ ^ dialect ... \\ ), 
  sure , i 'll be right over when the belts freeze, 
   not typing the dots/adding the e will sound as wrong , as if you had written any other wrong vowel instead . 
  this is true for german . 
  in for example swedish and finnish the dots are usually just removed . 
  if possible they should of course be maintained , since as you say the sound changes * a lot * , but so it does when adding an ` e ' , that adds an entire syllable !, 
  the standard here is to write a for \u00c5 / \u00c4 , and o for \u00d6 , and let context do the talking . 
  now in this context you were talking about schr\u00f6dinger , a german name , but know that the practice is n't ubiquitous . 
  \u00d8 is a null sign , not a letter , you silly danes . 
  interesting how you say that ae only is \u00e6 , and not \u00e4 . 
  but nothing about how oe would be only \u0153 , and not \u00f6 ... 
  i do wonder which language might have the \u00d6 but not \u00c4 , mr. * icelandic * flair guy ... * cough cough * \u00c4 can most definitely be written as ae in german , which is the language / u/essiggurkerl is talking about . 
  and what do you mean except us ? 
  \u00c4 is n't properly transcribed as ae in swedish . 
  unlike german , \u00c4 is a separate letter in swedish and should n't be split into two . 
  if \u00c4 is n't available the standard way of transcribing it in swedish is by putting an a. 
  the same is to my knowledge also true for finnish , who you seem to have omitted from your nordics . 
  and for any future insults , the e goes before the l in svenskdj\u00e4v * el * n. 
  looks difficult ? 
  just wait til you hear it !, 
  i can assure you the person who told you they `` lived in a ** socialist ** paradise '' was not swedish . 
  guaranteed . 
  and , honestly , in my experience what you 're saying is objectively untrue . 
  the `` sweden is great '' comments seems to mostly come from americans in my experience , and just gives us a feeling of abashment . 
  i 'm sure there are a few boastful swedes , but they 're in the minority . 
  we 're not a paradise , we 're not a hellhole . 
   this is a reddit only thing and it does n't come from no where because of the double negative , i 'm not 100 % sure whether you mean it came from somewhere or not . 
  but what i do know is that it 's not a reddit only thing . 
  that i know from personal experience in the us . 
  i do n't know whether you 're a troll or just confused , your username does seem to be the wrong way around . 
  oh no , no , i did n't criticize you comment !, 
  the map you linked seems fine . 
  yes , it 's probably conical . 
  i suppose it could be a cropped azimuthal or pseudoconical projection , but eye-balling it , my guess is that it 's an equal area conic . 
  i just said something since the list you linked does include cylindrical projections like just gall-peters . 
  they are equal area , but can be pretty deceiving and are a bit unnecessary to use if you are only working with one hemisphere . 
  that 's all . 
  it was just a recommendation of which equal area projection to use . 
  because while any equal area projection could technically be used to compare size , some are more suited than others for specific purposes . 
  if you 're for example only working with europe , a cylindrical projection probably is n't as appropriate as a conical one , even if they 're both equal area . 
  i was n't criticizing your comment , just adding to it . 
  apologies if it came across in any other way . 
  plans for tall skyscrapers are often dismissed building permits for ruining the esthetic of the city and skyline . 
  we have a rather significant housing shortage , especially in the larger cities , so it 'd probably be helpful to have some , but we do n't have many . 
  honestly i think you just get used to it to some extent after a while . 
  i 'm inside working during all our sun hours during winter , so i rarely see the sun at all . 
  ca n't really say i 'm ever really affected by it though . 
  just a note , all of them do accurately depict the size in terms of land . 
  but they do distort shapes slightly and are therefore not accurate for measuring distances . 
  gall-peters is an example of a projection that completely butchers in that regard . 
  its distances latitude-wise and its distances longitude-wise ca n't be accurately compared . 
  since you 're only worried about europe , which is entirely in the northern hemisphere , i 'd recommend using one of the conical projections originating on the north pole .

  [ you know what people , very important people , say about them .

  ikea has a pretty complicated corporate structure . 
  it consists of an array of for-profit and nonprofit organizations , organized from all over the place . 
  there are 13 franchises running somewhat independently . 
  but , if you 're talking about the very top , the nonprofit foundation that owns it all has been based in ( you guessed it ! ), 
  the netherlands since it was founded there in ' 82 . 
  and to my knowledge ingvar kamprad ( the founder ) actually moved back to sweden a couple of years ago . 
  he now lives on his farm outside a small village close to where he grew up ( and the original ikea store is ) . 
  ** tl ; dr ** the netherlands .
