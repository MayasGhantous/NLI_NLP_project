  yup , and unlike some other large swedish companies that have relocated for tax purposes , h&m is still irrefutably a swedish company . 
  headquartered in stockholm . 
  although , there are several countries with more h&m stores than us , italy being one . 
  i did however say that more in jest , it 's not like there 's a right and wrong way to pronounce it . 
  just a bit ? 
  it 's like half an hour ... 
  i really should stop this habit of opening a bunch of threads in multiple tabs if i ca n't remember to refresh before posting . 
  it 's better with multiple replies than none i guess ... ? 
  [ the chaos ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_chaos ) ? 
  [ here 's ] ( https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~clamen/misc/humour/thechaos.html ) the full one . 
  do n't blame us , blame the ... uhm ... * russians !, 
  * yeah , blame those russians !, 
  if it were n't for them , you could be included in ` swedish ' !, 
  hey now , it 's a swedish brand , why would the english name be the correct pronunciation ? 
   if anything i 'd argue the '' * acca emme * '' is truly the more correct pronunciation , that 's what we do in swedish , say the name of the letters ( * h\u00e5 em * ) . 
  support for the eu is pretty strong . 
  there are people who 're against it , but they 're in the minority . 
  adopting the euro is a different question , there are quite a few here vary of doing that . 
  the swedish krona has remained fairly stable and the eurozone crisis and debt things did n't help support . 
   4 ) sweden - the swedish democrats are hugely popular at this time i do n't know what your definition of `` hugely '' is , but the sweden democrats polls at 16-17 % currently . 
  while decently popular , they 're beaten by both the social democrats and moderates , who also have support by their respective blocks while sd are lone wolves . 
  so how would they go about making us leave the union exactly ? 
  as for the people , twice as many claimed support for the eu as were against it in the latest sifo-poll i could find . 
  not a few percent here and there , * twice * . 
  what to call the nordic model . 
  we 're very modest in sweden . 
  especially when you add a stick and some vulcanized rubber !, 
  usually . 
  when possible i prefer playing games in the `` local '' language ( what the characters would realistically speak ) with english subtitles . 
  if that 's not possible , or if the game does n't have any dialogue , i just go with english . 
  more specifically `` klave '' meant [ collar ] ( http://i.imgur.com/irdtsei.jpg ) ( for livestock ) . 
  it was a nickname given to the coat of arms due to its shape . 
  the `` klave '' is the side with the shield , at least historically . 
  the `` krona '' would by process of elimination indeed be the side with the head . 
  the king has always been a personification of `` the crown '' ( the monarchy ) , so it 's not like it does n't make sense . 
  but if i 'm not mistaken the expression was originally `` krona * och * klave '' , taking about the same side . 
  the `` klave '' was however always the side with the shield , irregardless of any crowns it also may have had . 
  there are about 700 species in sweden . 
  [ here 's a list ] ( http://www2.nrm.se/en/spindlar.html ) . 
  most common is probably the domestic house spider or something . 
  no established spiders here are of any danger to humans . 
  the [ cross spider ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/araneus_diadematus ) is known as our venomous spider , but in reality its venom is weaker than that of a wasp . 
  on the internet , very often , there are many americans on here . 
  otherwise , i really do n't know . 
  i ca n't think of any instances where i * consciously * deal with them . 
  we have things that are measured in inches , for example computer screens , tvs , hdds etc. , but it 's not something i think of as actually being a different measuring system , they 're more just numbers on a sizing scale like s/m/l are for t-shirts . 
  but i 'm not a mechanic , maybe i would if i were working on cars and stuff . 
   it 's in swedish , but if you are really interested google translate should do an ok job at translating well enough do give a general idea of how it 's laid out . 
  there is n't an official translation with the most recent amendments , but [ here 's ] ( http://www.government.se/4ac87e/contentassets/b58069e2c0f24aa6be53d8932de85d86/sfs-198280-employment-protection-act ) the ` non-official ' one that is published by the government and has amendments until 2008 . 
  it does n't hold any legal standing , but it 's probably better than google translate . 
  not really , cuneiform did n't have any child systems . 
  it ended up dying out during the neo-assyrian empire , when it was replaced by the phoenician alphabet . 
  egyptian hieroglyphs  proto-sinatic script  phoenician alphabet  greek alphabet . 
  all variations of cuneiform were separate from that line . 
  yup , all the way back to hieroglyphs . 
  i just mentioned back to greek because of what op put in the question . 
  yes , cyrillic descends from a variation of the greek alphabet with some glagolitic additions . 
  the latin script is also a descendant of the greek . 
  runes , while of more uncertain origins , most likely came from a variation of greek as well . 
  so they 'd too be `` greek-ish '' by that logic . 
  there 's been quite a few variations of the greek writing system through history as well . 
  some with additional letters , some with less . 
  some written left-to-right , some right-to-left , and even some in boustrophedon ( my favorite !, 
  i 've never heard of any `` doktor [ ... ] '' for medical professionals since the du-reform . 
  prior to that yes , but not since . 
  the only two instances i know about is for royalty in official settings , and greeting the speaker of parliament during debate ( `` herr - / fru talman '' ) . 
  it 's the same here . 
  odd for the living , even for the dead . 
  i do n't think many care nowadays , but bouquets are generally sold with an odd number of flowers because of it . 
  can also be noted variations with commas ( , - ) and semi-colons ( ;-) are also used . 
   quotation marks : '' like this '' ( note that they are at an angle ) just to clarify ( as the font i see makes those look like straight marks in italic ) : we use [ `` 99 `` s ] ( http://i.imgur.com/k1w8van.png ) , both to start and end quotation . 
  an en-dash ( -- ) can also be used to indicate speech in literature , and '' ... `` is found in some older texts ( my bible has those for example ) . 
  in the southern parts of sweden at the moment , have snow . 
  not loads , but certainly enough to make everything white . 
  in general , yes . 
  now whether it 's voluntary i do n't know . 
  but yeah , there 's not as much stigma there in my experience . 
  or maybe i just befriended weirdos when i lived in spain ... our ages are getting up there due to the housing shortage and how expensive it is though , especially in the larger cities . 
  do n't take what he says too seriously , he 's a. . . * special * redditor . 
  just look at his comment history . 
  while it 's true that the us does have a lot of individualism going on , do n't overestimate a cultural gap on this . 
  here in northern europe there 's a stigma against staying at home too long , and moving across the country when you do move is n't rare here in sweden . 
  most of my family lives 300 + km away , and quite a few do n't even live in the country . 
  `` god jul '' ( good yule \u2248 merry christmas ) is the standard . 
  never heard anyone use any `` religion neutral '' greeting . 
  but ` jul ' does n't really have very religious connotations . 
  the word itself comes from the old pagan celebrations , it just never got translated into something like * christ * mas . 
  i 've encountered it exactly once in my life , two years ago . 
  not super popular here to my knowledge , but i think it 's increasing in popularity . 
  it makes some assumptions , especially in ancient times . 
  probably because little/no recorded history exists , but it 's a bit disingenuous to present it at all . 
  the tribes and peoples are also a bit inaccurate , for example it puts swedes where geats would 've lived ( the swedes lived to the north/north-east of that ) . 
  and i 'd say the finns are misleadingly far north . 
  maybe it 's because it moves labels to be easily legible ( not on lakes etc. 
  ) , but it leaves it a bit inaccurate . 
  and it lumps some peoples together while making clear distinctions for others , which is kind of weird . 
  it puts `` swedish states '' becoming `` sweden '' in 1000 . 
  the real year is unknown and disputed , but the first known undisputed king reigned from ~ 970 to ~ 995 . 
  the video does say it rounds dates lacking precise detail , but 1000 is kind of weird as he was dead . 
  and , as / u/tonygaze said , you really should n't call it `` the entire history of europe '' .
