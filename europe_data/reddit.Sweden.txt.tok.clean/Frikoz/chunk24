  it 's missing the most interesting parts !, 
  i do n't know of one . 
  the final countdown by europe is probably the only one i 've come to expect hearing every year . 
  danish and swedish changed at the same time , they both spelled it the same . 
  what can be remembered is that there were no written standards , people just wrote as it sounded and added some `` decorative touches '' at their own discretion . 
  could all exist in the very same same text . 
  and ` rike ' can be found as ` rige ' in old swedish . 
  ` sverige ' just ended up sticking with g , the word ` rike ' became standardized with a k. 
  haha no , but it probably could 've been . 
  i have heard the whereabouts of arne weise being questioned . 
   i do n't think they were doing it very seriously , it 's just what they 've told me in recent years . 
  and i do think the `` year after year '' is an exaggeration . 
  they probably stopped pretty early , otherwise i would 've remembered . 
  i had the opposite of that growing up . 
  apparently i never thought he was real but my parents insisted i should have `` real childhood '' so they tried to make me believe year after year . 
   however these things probably are n't unique to * the uk * . 
  probably the uk . 
  alright . 
  i did n't pick that up , sorry . 
  i know people here who believe those things to be true because that 's kind of how it 's been portrayed . 
  figured that might 've been true for denmark too . 
  my apologies . 
   please germany , move troops across my country , it is n't a problem untrue , it was a problem for us . 
  germany pressured , threatened , and even tried to bribe sweden into letting military personnel and equipment through , but we did n't as it 'd break our stance on neutrality . 
  the things we did let the germans send through were food , tobacco , and medical supplies . 
  they were not allowed to send troops or weaponry . 
  we did let through 292 unarmed medical workers from the red cross . 
  some of those we now know were military recon personnel in disguise , but that 's only by reading dietl 's diary , which the swedes at the time could n't . 
  most troops came by ship . 
   germany , you can have my steel we sold steel to both sides . 
  but that 's the downside of remaining neutral , afterwards people just focus on `` helping the other side '' . 
  did we sell more to germany ? 
  probably . 
  to this very day germany is our largest export partner and we did n't have quotas to match sales to both sides . 
  if we ever broke neutrality , it was when we warned norway about an impending invasion we knew about from intel we 'd gotten by tapping the german transmissions . 
  it 's really quite unfair to claim sweden was `` axis by proxy '' . 
  that 's only because of what / u/maninthewoods said : the downside of being neutral , whomever wins will blame us for not joining them . 
  ^ ( edit : improving phrasing ), 
  when did he say that ? 
   what do you refer to it as in english , and ** what do you refer to it as in your native language ? 
  ** ... is * probably * the question / u/werkstadt responded to . 
  i disagree . 
  i do n't think people have anything against people looking for their european roots . 
  i myself have done a lot of research into my ancestry , it can be interesting . 
  what people dislike is how people seem to present themselves as sharing their ancestors nationality . 
  if your great great grandfather was swedish , * he * was swedish , not you . 
  i 'm paraphrasing , but i had a conversation similar to this when i was in the us last :  `` i 'm swedish '' `` ooh , me too ! '', 
  `` ehh ... like , my great grandfather was swedish . 
  so , i 'm swedish . '', 
  that 's just not how it works in europe . 
   no one is ** ok ** with having to say goodbye to 30-50 % of their income , friend . 
  i 'm ok with it . 
  i 'm i * happy * doing it ? 
  do i sometimes wish it was less ? 
  yeah ... 
  but i 'm certainly *** ok *** with it . 
  mainly because of everything else you said . 
  sure , i 'd see them as countrymen if they became swedish citizens . 
  but , their ethnicity would n't matter one bit . 
  i 'd see a han chinese as a countryman just as much as an ethnic swede if they were citizens . 
  would i say descendants were part of my ethnic group ? 
  sure . 
  ethnicity 's ethnicity , that would n't be affected by the place you happened to be born . 
  naming something loki is playing with fire dude , that 's how you get ragnar\u00f6k . 
  though i suppose you 'd be fine until he finds a h\u00f6\u00f0r to manipulate , then you 're properly screwed . 
  i do know a few people with those names , but not my age . 
  if i were to be prejudicial , i 'd say they 'd be raggare , listening to nationalteatern or something . 
  yeah , astrid was in the top 20 for newborn girls last year . 
  i know multiple people my age named gunnar ... 
  exactly 0 ragnhilds , though . 
  does he happen to be missing an eye ? 
  and please tell me that you call his water bowl `` m\u00edmir 's well '' . 
  i am . 
  but , as / u/liliputput said , there are some homophonic names with unrelated etymologies . 
  but she did invent the swedish name ` ronja ' . 
  she got the inspiration for it from looking at one of those car atlases and liking the sound of some sami/finnish-named lake in lapland . 
  ` jauronjaure ' or something i think it was called . 
  the first swede named ronja was born in 1985 . 
  anyone else who 's called it must 've either changed their name since or have it as a nickname . 
  7403 people have the name ragnhild here , 2445 of those have it as their primary name . 
  but i can confirm , it sounds like the name of a character in the old eddas to me . 
  but you never know , it may just make a comeback . 
  many newborns today have what i 'd consider `` old-people names '' like elsa , alma , edith , ester etc. 
  maybe ragnhild will be next , who knows ? 
  it 's probably worse the larger the city , but last i saw 240 of our 290 municipalities report a lack of housing , so it 's * pretty * widespread . 
  i 'm do n't know about j\u00e4mtland though . 
  and while rural areas may have some houses , it 's not really useful housing if it 's located too far from work opportunities since there 'd be no one to live there . 
  we have 502 caesars . 
  and apparently 309 ` ceasar ' . 
  i do n't know of a perfect male equivalent of gun . 
  we 've got gunnar for men , which is * somewhat * related . 
  though technically it comes from `` gunnr + - arr '' meaning battl * er * ( or ` warrior ' ) . 
  so it 's not entirely the same . 
  also i know variations of that does exist abroad , like gunther etc. 
  oh yeah , kjetil ( and ketil ) are other variations of kjell . 
  yeah , astrid lindgren invented the name for that book . 
  we have 5776 ronjas , but i only included top 100-names which it 'd need to quadruple to join . 
  but i do n't know about its popularity abroad , the book 's been out in other countries for almost as long as here . 
  gun is a name for women . 
  bojans usually for men , right ?
