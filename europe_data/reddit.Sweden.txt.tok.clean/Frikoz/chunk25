  it 's more an issue with culture and such and actually owning your place . 
  if you have a steady income you 'll probably be able to sublet , but it 's usually pretty disadvantageous and can be a bit ... meh . 
  people also live at home longer than we have in the past ( there 's a bit of a stigma against that here ) . 
  roommates are n't super common compared to some other countries , we 're pretty individualistic people . 
  the waiting time for a place in cities like stockholm stretches upwards to 20 years . 
  that 's the main issue . 
  uncommon outside of the nordic countries possibly , but i do n't know any name that 'd only exist in sweden . 
  popular names ( top 100 in sweden ) that may potentially be limited to the nordics ( ? 
  ) : - ** \u00c5ke ** ( \u00c5ge , aage ) : derived from medieval ` anicho ' , `` ancestor '' . 
  - ** kjell ** ( kjeld , keld ) : from old norse ` k\u0119till ' ( `` cauldron , helmet '' ) . 
  - ** h\u00e5kan ** ( haakon , h\u00e5kon , hakon ) : probably from old norse ` h\u00e1 konr ' , `` high son '' . 
  - ** rune ** : from old norse ` r\u00fan ' , `` secret '' ( yes , same origin as ` runes ' . 
  not pronounced like that though ) . 
  - ** b\u00f6rje ** ( b\u00f8rge ) : variation of * birger * ( maybe birger fits too ? 
  ) , from old norse ` bjarga ' , `` to help , to protect '' . 
  - ** \u00c5sa ** ( \u00c5se ) : from old norse ` asa ' , `` goddess '' . 
  - ** gun ** ( gunn ) : from old norse ` gunnr ' , `` battle , war '' . 
  edit : added some etymologies and danish/norwegian spellings for anyone interested . 
  it feels a bit ineffective and unnecessarily bureaucratic at times . 
  and going abroad you realize how expensive stuff can sometimes be here . 
  the lack of housing is also a pain in the arse , but i do n't know if that 's a consequence of the nordic system or just sweden things . 
  i would n't give it up though . 
  i 'm getting an education , have zilch in debt , and if shit were to hit the fan i know there 's a safety net to catch me . 
  ^ ( edit : grammar fixes ), 
  i do n't think that 's limited to places with universal healthcare , it 's a pretty universal complaint . 
  anecdotally , the longest waiting time i 've personally encountered was in the us . 
  he does n't really represent any constituency . 
  the prime minister is n't elected by votes . 
  his seat in parliament is from stockholm 's constituency , yes , but being the prime minister he 's currently off his duty as member of parliament . 
  and the description `` which constituency they had represented in their country during their election '' is n't necessarily accurate as there is n't an election for the position . 
  anyway , since you 've written it i assume you have a source , but since you have n't linked anything [ here 's one ] ( https://www.riksdagen.se/en/members-and-parties/member/stefan-lofven_ac737989-5fa0-44bc-ad69-c1a0ddba71bb ) in case you do n't . 
  it may , i do n't know enough about the netherlands to confirm . 
  we do n't use formal/polite pronouns , titles , last names , or any of that type of formality at all since the reform . 
  not even during formal occasions . 
  with the exception of the king , you 'd ` du ' everyone even at things like the nobel banquet . 
  we do . 
  they 're not ubiquitous , but libraries , schools , sporting facilities etc. 
  may have them . 
  an officially supported cultural shift ? 
  but no , i guess more of a cultural shift . 
  there was n't any law change or such . 
  long story short : it started a few years earlier with some workplaces adapting the policy , but what 's called the `` du-reform '' came into place in 1967 with a policy of the head of the national board of health . 
  this then spread to the other governmental organs , and eventually it had trickled down to everyone else . 
  it did take about ten years until everyone was comfortable with it . 
  also , it can be noted it does n't apply to royals in official settings nor when addressing the speaker in parliament . 
  -- edit : there 's apparently a [ wikipedia page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/du-reformen ) , if you 're really curious . 
  we do n't have one since the `` du-reform '' in the 60s/70s . 
  it 's ` du ' ( you ) or first name . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kmuwxluoyg that 's the highest placed swedish song on the charts here currently . 
  i do n't listen much to popular music myself , so i do n't really know much else . 
  is n't ` ombudsman ' used in russian too ? 
  no , no . 
  that 's not at all what i meant !, 
  i just wanted to explain why i found it unnecessarily convolute . 
  apologies if i 'm inarticulate and it came across as something else . 
  dear god , i do n't think it offends anyone . 
  i just did n't want others to be misled about the meaning and without context i think it may . 
  that is n't any better for me either . 
  k\u00f8benhavn or k\u00f6penhamn , i really do n't care . 
  but those weird mixtures ... man , they 're horrible . 
   k\u00f8penhamn that spelling is making me feel oddly uneasy . 
  it 's some kind of uncanny valley shit . 
  more accurately they 're named after the eponymous mine next to the village , where they were all discovered . 
  holmium was also discovered there ( ytterby lies in the stockholm archipelago ) . 
  in addition to those five , four other elements found in the mine : - scandium ( named after scandia ( latin for scandinavia ) ) - thulium ( after thule ( believed to have been another latin word for scandinavia ) ) - gadolinium ( after chemist johan gadolin who discovered yttrium there ) - tantalum ( after tantalus in greek mythology , unrelated to the ytterby ), 
  when you churn butter small lumps of butter forms and floats on the surface of the milk , these lumps were called `` butter geese '' . 
  that meaning then extended to all butter , and since you put the butter on sandwiches , soon the entire sandwich was referred to as ` butter goose ' . 
  has little to do with actual geese ( other than the fact that they also float ) . 
  ` sandwich ' actually comes from the english town of the same name , or rather its [ earl ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_montagu,_4th_earl_of_sandwich ) who supposedly invented it . 
  not to my knowledge , no . 
  and if you meant that as some stereotypical implication that i 'd lack humour , i do n't . 
  it 's just that most people here do not speak swedish and it 's a bit unnecessary and misleading to translate it like that , just for the sake of being weird . 
  sure , it can be whimsical and fun for us who speak the language . 
  but it 's not very nice to mislead others who may not know that sm\u00f6rg\u00e5s means sandwich and may take your translation at face value . 
  no , it 's swedish for ` sandwich table ' . 
  the fact that `` sandwich '' can be broken down further into ` butter goose ' , does n't mean that that 's what the ` sm\u00f6rg\u00e5s ' of ` sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord ' stands for . 
  that 's a different matter and saying so is just convoluting it excessively . 
  sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord means ` sandwich table ' . 
  also they do n't use falukorv . 
  it 's ... * okay * . 
  better than starving , but not something i 'd serve the king . 
  yeah , it 's like traveling activates our viking genes or something . 
  it 's obviously very different from person to person . 
  but , in general , yes . 
  til i 'm german . 
  i have jack wolfskin stuff and always wait for green . 
  is it because people believe it 's bad for their health ? 
  we 've had criticism of palm oil here , but it 's all because of how horrendous its production is for the environment . 
  not an health issue . 
  i feel like our `` regions '' are being a bit overstated , i mean they cooperate . 
  for example , the travel card i used in j\u00f6nk\u00f6ping can be used for trips to , from , and within the six southernmost ` regions ' of sweden . 
  that 's an area larger than the whole kingdom of the netherlands . 
  and since it includes trips to , and from those six regions , it can be used elsewhere for taking a trip , or going back home . 
  i mean i 've used that card to go to , and from , copenhagen and that * is * a different country . 
  the reason we have those regions is to decentralize and allow each region to have better control of their public transport . 
  it 's more difficult for someone sitting in stockholm to know wither h\u00f6\u00f6r needs an extra bus line and allocate resources for that , than it is for someone already in scania . 
  wait , so is it a brand like mastercard or visa or do you call all debit cards with pins `` pin '' ? 
  sweden 's a mostly cashless society , i only carry a debit card . 
  the busses and trains of most ( all ? ), 
  regions , have their own system with contactless travel cards .
