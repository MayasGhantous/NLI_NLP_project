   danish according to [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/danish_phonology#broad_phonetic_transcription ) : [ \u02c8no\u028c\u032f\u028cnven\u02c0n\u0329 \u028c \u02c8so\u02d0\u02c0l\u0329n ]  standard swedish : [ \u02c8nu\u02d0\u0256a\u0271\u02ccv\u026an\u02d0d\u0259n \u0254 \u02c8su\u02d0l\u0259n ] not sure i 100 % agree with that [ \u0271 ] . 
  it 's can be close to a labiodental nasal because of the following [ v ] , but i would n't think standard swedish would omit the [ n ] . 
  but maybe i just do n't know standard swedish as well as i like to think . 
  not entirely because of the geographical proximity , more the increased exposure it may bring . 
  in my experience many danes seem to understand the stockholm dialect easier than some of the scanian ones that are much closer . 
  it 's all about exposure . 
  this can also be because people attempt to speak `` clearer '' for you . 
  i know i change my dialect when speaking to people i do n't know ; omitting dialectal words , slowing down , and articulating more . 
  it sounds more `` standardized '' than how i speak with the people back home . 
  does n't mean it 's gone , i just wo n't speak it to people i do n't know will understand it . 
  it 's just easier to do that then constantly stopping and repeating what i 've already said to some dialectally-incompetent stockholmer . 
  it 's the same for me with many swedes from other parts of the country . 
  i have to slowdown and speak `` clearer '' or something as simple as * `` the graveyard '' * will be misinterpreted as * `` the kitchen creek '' * ( kyrkog\u00e5rden \u2260 k\u00f6k\u00e5n ) and that 's not even a dialectal word . 
  it all depends on exposure , someone from haparanda will probably have an easier time understanding fenno-swedish than someone from gothenburg . 
  nah , sweden is second in what matters : overrepresentation !, 
  ireland seems to be first though . 
  * you * can take your spot in third . 
  that 's the old design though, 
  it 's also of a five years outdated design . 
  our passports expire after just five years , so who knows what 's going on . 
  there are [ over 100 locations ] ( https://polisen.se/service/pass-och-id-kort/har-ansoker-du-om-pass-id/ ) . 
  yeah , he was a member of a local planning board , you ca n't be much smaller of a fish than that and still be called a politician . 
  alright !, 
  no , i do stand by it . 
  i ca n't see a reason for a newspaper to ever release that information to the public . 
  that 's cool . 
  ca n't really agree that it was well thought out though , but meh , i got most of it . 
  what is it you disagree with the most if i may ask ? 
  i do n't . 
  people should be innocent until proven guilty . 
  publishing a suspects information turns them into a criminal in the public 's eye . 
  even in cut and dry cases it seldom makes sense to publish it , and sets a bad precedent . 
  due process ( or whatever it is it 's called in english ) is important . 
  having that information published also makes any investigation of the case more difficult , creates targets ( both out of the suspect and their family/friends ) for reactionary mod punishment , and all kinds of stuff . 
  and for what ? 
  why would the public ever need to know that information ? 
  it does n't add anything to the news story . 
  sure , everything can be found on the internet . 
  but there 's a big difference between some nosy basement dwellers knowing something and causing permanent damage to an individual . 
  i agree , many do however seem to have a need to immediately put a face on the criminal . 
  it 's a core principle of our journalism ethics , and it is taken very seriously . 
  there have been a few incidents over the years with tabloids fishing for readers , but that rarely ends well for them . 
  one exception many tabloids claim , is doing it when the perpetrator is known to have died . 
  like when [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trollh%c3%a4ttan_school_attack ) happened in 2015 , they started blasting his face and name all over the place the instant he 'd died . 
  there 's no law explicitly forbidding it to my knowledge , but it is may break other laws , like for libel . 
  however , it is a core principle of swedish journalism ethics to not publish any identifying information about suspects until conviction , nor any such information about the victim or potential witnesses without consent . 
  which is a principle virtually all news outlets in sweden respects . 
  it 's taken very seriously here . 
  i will remember expressen , a tabloid , broke it in 2006 ( ? ), 
  or something which lead to boycotts and all kinds of stuff . 
  what do you think happens to the color averages when people have pink lips and white teeth visible ? 
  [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dimqnld.jpg ) you have the averages of the same area of the completely uncensored image , and the pixelated one . 
  just for fun i 'm gon na let you guess which one is `` whitepixeled '' . 
  tell me , is the top or the bottom ? 
  what ? 
  dn is n't a tabloid , they frequently ( usually ? ), 
  post reports of suspected crime without images . 
  our tabloids have been posting pixelated images , and parts of the video , * all with unedited skin color * as far as i can see . 
  right-wing bias in general , but also with some communists ... generally attracts the extremes of the spectrum . 
  heavily anti-immigration . 
  general political orientation can be seen [ here ] ( https://www.flashback.org/t2402122 ) . 
  to give you an idea ` svp ' ( 12,5 % of the votes there ) was a fairly openly neo-nazi party . 
  and for comparison with the general populace : sd received about 13 % of the votes in the 2014 election ( when that poll was held ) , on flashback they got 57 % . 
  values freedom of expression over any journalism ethics . 
  no reputable news source would report their names , and i do n't know of any that has . 
  the standard is to refer to suspects by their age . 
  if we 're being pedantic , skanska was named after the southernmost * province * , not * county * . 
  the county did n't exist until 1997 and the merger of malm\u00f6hus - and kristianstad counties . 
  but that may be a bit too pedantic and it is quite irrelevant since the only difference between the county and province is the small parish of \u00d6stra karup ... 
  i should stop now . 
  in this case : svenska = swedish ( adjective ) sveriges = sweden 's ( genitive ), 
  not here either, 
  norwegians are just a standard punchline in a lot of our jokes . 
  if someone does something stupid or naive in a joke it 's often a norwegian . 
  they do the same with us . 
  works for a lot of styles of jokes : `` a swede , a dane , and a norwegian ... [ ends with the norwegian doing something stupid/weird ] '' `` why did the norwegian [ something stupid ] ? 
  - [ punchline ] '' `` what do norwegians call [ something ] ? 
  - [ punchline ] '' `` what do you call [ something positive ] people in norway ? 
  - tourists '' etc. 
  yes , there would be some standard . 
  but that does n't mean a specific hue is strictly enforced . 
  all their digital media and prints probably use the same rgb/cmyk values respectively , that 's easy to control . 
  but having a strictly enforced hue matching across the board with building facades , frakta bags , flags etc. , is much more difficult . 
  just looking at the op , the yellow of the ikea-logo , entrance , and sign all look slightly different to me . 
  now that could of course be due to a difference in lighting , blending of colors , jpg artifacts , or something . 
  controlling fonts and its size is easy , standardizing colorspaces is difficult . 
  that 's all i meant , they do probably have standards for approximate colors . 
  as you say , branding 's important . 
  i 'm not sure ikea has a strict standards for which exact tone to use , but in general , if you were to compare them side-by-side , yes , i do believe ikea would have a richer blue . 
  but , like most flags , the swedish flag is meant to be flown in the wind , which gives it shadows and a degree of translucency which makes the blue darker and colors more vivid . 
  it 's not meant to be seen flat , unlike ikea 's building facade . 
  so you ca n't really compare them as they have different applications . 
  it 's a bit like comparing a and b of the [ checker shadow illusion ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/grey_square_optical_illusion.svg/310px-grey_square_optical_illusion.svg.png ) ... kind of . 
  colorimetry 's weird . 
  it is . 
  it 's named after the borough it 's in , nordstaden . 
  nord -  `` north '' . 
  ` stan ' is a standard contraction of ` staden ' -  `` the town '' , `` the city '' . 
  it has nothing to do with the persian suffix . 
  ` stan ' is a word in swedish , it means `` the city '' or `` the town '' .
