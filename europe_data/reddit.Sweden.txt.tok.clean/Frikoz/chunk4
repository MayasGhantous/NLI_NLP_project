  it 's a colloquial contraction of the word ` staden ' . 
  * nordstan * is a mall in the * north * ern parts of down * town * gothenburg . 
  it 's named after the borough it 's in , * nordstaden * . 
  it has nothing to do with the persian suffix that stupid `` swedistan '' comes from . 
  it 's not . 
  the lower the number , the more popular reddit is ( compared to other websites ) . 
  reddit 's the eighth most popular website in sweden , that 's what the rather low number indicates . 
  eh , you deserve some cred . 
   it 's not fair i have the more popular post , when you actually were first . 
  the comment is too old to give you any karma if you care about that , but at least people see it . 
  i wo n't care if people takes my comment either , but , personally , i always want to pay credit where it 's due if possible . 
  if i 'm spreading someone else 's work i do n't want people to think it 's mine . 
  i actually did put together my list myself , but i feel like i should to apologize to you for something still . 
  you did a great job . 
  i 'm sorry if i encroached on your idea . 
  edit : do you want me to add an edit pointing to your post ? 
  you obviously did it first . 
  i do n't like it . 
  i really do n't care about karma , if i did i would n't spend my days on / r/askeurope . 
  so to be called a karma whore who 's part of some grand karma conspiracy because i responded to a question feels a little demeaning . 
  i 'd take my usual ~ 5 karma comments over this any day . 
  you just have to take one look at my comment history to see that i 'm not one who chases upvotes . 
  the vast majority of my comments are just responding to questions on / r/askeurope . 
  what ? 
  please do n't . 
  it was a completely valid assumption , it just was n't true for this instance . 
  there have been several such lists , all very similar as * they 're of the exact same thing * ... !, 
  it 's literally a matter of finding tweets and putting them into a list , i do n't really understand this `` hype '' ... 
  i actually did compile this myself , but yeah , it certainly could 've been . 
  if it had been i 'd given credit though . 
  it 's not very difficult to dig stuff up , the man had tweeted a lot and his twitter is open for everyone to scour through . 
  it just takes a little time . 
  it 's not like i hacked his computer or something . 
  i did n't , if i 'd copy-pasted someone else 's list i would 've given credit . 
  but i guess you 're free to believe what you want . 
  there are a bunch of lists over the same exact thing and it 's not like i can prove anything . 
  it 's not difficult to compile , it 's just a little time consuming . 
  but maybe it is n't even that with this nice little archive / u/gunnarsvg linked . 
  well , that could certainly have been handy to have earlier ... 
  i 'm not entirely sure what this entails , but i will find out and i will treasure it !, 
  thank you !, 
  i put this together a while ago so that could also play a part . 
  i have n't seen much about it so it 's possible he 's been less vocal , but i have n't exactly kept up with his twitter either . 
  i 've not heard of him taking on a different stance , but who knows ? 
  he has n't been the most steadfast person i know when it comes to opinions . 
  i have not . 
  it would n't be too difficult to look for other topics , but i do n't know if he 's posted that much that 's blatantly against mexicans . 
  he has insinuated that a lot of immigrants from mexico are criminals , like : https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/612083064945180672 https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/570384640281870337 https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/617857470933913600 https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/769539271678013440 etc. 
  but most tweets i could find related to mexico now were about the government , legal system , how their businessmen are untrustworthy , and payment for that damn wall , not about the people themselves . 
  i did n't look in-depth though , just a quick search .

  ** -- ^ ( edit 2 : to you who complained about them not being chronological : i think they all should be now . 
  edit 2.1 : well , now i think they really should be . ), 
  when [ it was polled last time ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/5gk5qn/how_many_of_you_have_shot_a_gun_before/ ) it came out : 62 % no / 38 % yes as for me , yes . 
  of course . 
  now i live in an apartment , but i 've had saunas at home in all of the houses i 've lived in . 
  i 've never been to one that allowed wearing garments ( but usually towels ) and most have had heating rocks for water throwing . 
  otherwise there 's been all kinds . 
   besides like the swedish notion we 're in the stone age wait , what ? 
  i have literally never heard anything like that . 
  ever . 
  nothing or socks, 
  i made a crossbow in woodshop in 6th or 7th grade . 
  i used real crossbow schematics and it ended up pretty darn powerful . 
  i also made bolts for it using reversed nails for the head . 
  i shot it at a tree and the bolt went in the entire length of the protruding nail past the bark ... back then i thought he was awesome , but grown-up me would have some real questions for that woodshop teacher . 
  letting 6th graders loose with actual , dangerous , weaponry ? 
  what was he thinking ? 
  are you talking about [ this thread ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4qytzb/what_are_some_of_the_free_benefits_that_the_eu/ ) on / r/europe ? 
  the ` language council ' ( spr\u00e5kr\u00e5det ) of the * institute for language and folk memory * is the primary and official regulatory body for swedish and an equally , if not more , important source for swedish . 
  swedish used to be in the hands of swedish academy , now it 's a collaboration by the cooperative group * spr\u00e5kv\u00e5rdsgruppen * , which sa and spr\u00e5kr\u00e5det are both part of . 
  other important organizations part of spr\u00e5kv\u00e5rdsgruppen include * terminology center tnc * and * kotus * ( finland 's language institute ) among others . 
  it woke me up , i thought a lorry was driving past and promptly fell asleep again . 
  i did n't realize it had been an earthquake until i saw the news in the morning . 
  it did crack our ceiling which needed to be replastered and painted though . 
  edit : it was [ this one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_sk%c3%a5ne_county_earthquake ), 
  not to discredit that sj worker , but it 's not really difficult to understand that !, 
  you were a lot closer than the * vax * + * joe * many go with . 
  and to be fair it does n't make sense with swedish orthography either . 
  it 's not really correct to shorten * k * + * ` sj ' * with * `` xj '' * , even if * x * pretty much is a * ` ks ' * . 
  you could 've spoken swedish and still have been wrong if you 'd never heard it pronounced before ... , 
   one of my least proud moments in sweden was my first attempt to pronounce v\u00e4xj\u00f6 ... do n't beat yourself up , i 've met born and raised swedes who mispronounced it . 
  how did you say it ? 
  well , to me it sounded like you just defended their honor . 
  you do n't think english is the bastard of germanic languages ? 
  it does have some significant differences separating it from the rest . 
  i mean , there is a widely believed hypothesis that middle english developed as a creole of old english and french . 
  and the majority of the words in the dictionary are of romance origin . 
  * but * that 's not how linguistics work ... english is just the bastard of germanic languages , with a french mother . 
  not you guys if that 's what you 're asking . 
  you do n't speak a germanic language , do you ? 
  i 'm talking about the guys who want to keep one foot in the germanic language camp and one in the french . 
  estland is what you call it in most germanic languages . 
  it 's just the anglos who 're being contrarian , again ... , 
  well ... 
  i 've applied to a university course for this fall in irish and i do n't even have any plans of moving there . 
  i really do n't know why , i 'm not going to have any use for it . 
  i just think it sounds nice and i like studying . 
  i love languages , so yeah , if i moved to a region with a native minority language i would definitely make an effort to learn it . 
  it 's respectful and giving .
