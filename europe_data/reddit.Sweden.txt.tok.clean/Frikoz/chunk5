  i have a dishwasher . 
  otherwise i use a brush and dishwashing liquid . 
  and yes , i rinse afterwards . 
  do n't know anyone who does n't . 
  one thing i learned when i lived in spain was how people apparently use sponges elsewhere , i 'd never seen that here . 
  everyone i know here has always used brushes . 
  nope . 
  as others have said it 's illegal here and has been for quite some time . 
  almost right . 
  it was a personal union . 
  you 're presenting theories as facts again tony . 
  it 's * believed * to be the oldest flag for a * sovereign state * in * continuous * use while * ignoring changes to the design * . 
  otherwise i agree . 
  do n't see why you 'd change it . 
  what do you mean ? 
  i do n't understand what you 're asking ? 
  i do n't know what 's typical as i neither look at what 's trending on youtube nor use swedish youtube . 
  but looking at it now , the sweden-produced videos currently under `` trending '' are called :  `` jason tests -- bathing in popcorn '' `` youtuber sends nude pics to underage [ people ] '' `` ghost chase | the children-murder-cross '' `` to poop at work '' `` best invention for under 100 '' ( 100 sek = 10,22 $ ) `` compare this year 's best vlog-camera with last year 's '' `` can you solve these 6 riddles ? '', 
  `` f \\* ck - marry - kill ! '', 
  ( title in english ) `` leo 's 11th [ birthday ] party '' `` 5 '80s - sandwiches do to this weekend '' `` makeover at rapunzel + the guldtuben-dress !!, 
  ( ` guldtuben ' means `` the golden tube '' , i do not know what that is ) most videos on there do not seem to be swedish though . 
  there 's a significant amount of esc related stuff .

  no matter what it ends up being a dictatorship going against my wishes . 
  ** scenario 1 : ** my interest is that it remains a democracy =  it becomes a dictatorship . 
  ** scenario 2 : ** my interest is that it 's a functional democracy =  it becomes a democracy =  scenario 1, 
  i can , but i do n't notice them if i 'm not consciously paying attention . 
  church bells are pretty unobtrusive . 
  no , it does n't annoy me . 
  i live close to the fire station so i hear a lot more sirens . 
  those are obviously designed to be more noticeable and can be annoying at times , but i 'm pretty used to them . 
  * carl linnaeus * ( father of modern taxonomy ) , * carl scheele * ( element discoverer extraordinaire ) , * ingmar bergman * ( film auteur ) and * august strindberg * ( writing and stuff ) , maybe ? 
  i do n't know that it 'd be any less , i just have n't heard such slang for money . 
  i do n't know if it 's just my dialect or social circle not using it , but i had n't heard of any . 
  it obviously exists as posted by / u/abrovinch . 
  thanks !, 
  til . 
  i guess i have heard two : st\u00e5lar and kosing . 
  the others are all new to me though ... 
  i do n't know if it 's dialectal or just me having a weird circle of friends , but i genuinely have n't . 
  well , i do also know what riksdaler were but i 've never heard anyone use it for present day money . 
  i 've never heard anything but * pengar * ( `` money '' ) ... 
  it is possible i do n't hang out with cool enough people who are down with the slang though . 
  most countries had customary units with similarly named units , but they varied slightly . 
  the imperial system specifically denotes the customary system the uk defined . 
  not the type of system , that specific system . 
  for example our inch was 2,4742 cm , an imperial inch is 2,54 cm . 
  our mile and the english mile are also unrelated . 
  initially our varied greatly across the country . 
  in eastern sweden ( now finland ) it was ~ 6000 meters , in dalarna it was ~ 14500 m. eventually it was standardized after the uppland mile to ~ 10688 meters , which was rounded down to a myriameter in 1889 . 
  obviously . 
  pre-sliced is more expensive , does n't last as long , is never the thickness i want and ends up tasting worse imo . 
  a block of cheese and norwegian kitchen utensils is much better . 
  usually whatever cheese i have home or [ kalles kaviar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kalles_kaviar ) . 
   malm that could be a bed . 
  pretty normal . 
  not to strange , nice of y' all to mix it up a bit . 
   billy ... ? 
  & nbsp ; * billy ? 
  * & nbsp ; you conceive children atop * bookcases * in germany ? 
  some explanations if anyone 's curious : ingvar kamprad = name of the founder elmtaryd = ingvar 's childhood farm ( old spelling of * \u00c4lmtaryd * ) agunnaryd = the town/parish the farm is in, 
  just in time for intermission !, 
  correct . 
  the scandinavian peninsula is the actual peninsula . 
  scandinavia = skandinavien scandinavian peninsula = skandinaviska halv\u00f6n, 
  yes , it also includes parts of russia . 
  it 's a primarily geographical description , not a cultural one . 
  denmark is n't part of the scandinavian peninsula since 1658/1814 either . 
  the * scandinavian peninsula * refers to the scandinavian peninsula , it 's something different . 
  that 's a geographic description of which denmark is n't part and a small part of finland is . 
  * scandinavia * refers norway/sweden/denmark . 
  no , i have n't seen it in forever . 
  i 'm gon na watch this slovakia-denmark hockey game now . 
  something like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/k816zqd.png ) if i 'm not forgetting something . 
  red : traveled extensively . 
  pink : seen a fair bit of . 
  light pink : been to a couple of places , but do n't really know . 
  white : never been . 
  i 've gone more south down the continent than up north . 
  it 's a bit expensive and i 've never really had the opportunity . 
  hopefully i will one day . 
  for teenagers in secondary school it 's 1050 sek ( ~ 110 $ ) per month , 10 months per year . 
  the benefit itself does n't depend on parents income . 
  but if your parent ( s ) have a ( collective ) income lower than 125000 ( ~ 13000 $ ) you 're eligible for extra additions , which do depend on it . 
  there are also other additions you may be eligible for too . 
  for example if you 're required to move for your education you 'll get benefits for lodging etc. 
  they cut you off if your attendance is too low . 
  -- for university and adults it 's 2848kr/month ^ \\* ( ~ 295 $ ) and you can loan 7168/month ^ \\* ( ~ 741 $ ) , for a total of 1036 $ per month ^ \\* \\* by month i really mean 4 weeks . 
  it 's based on a weekly basis of actual weeks of studying . 
  most take the loan even if they do n't need it as there are n't much better loans out there . 
  the interest for 2017 is 0,34 % . 
  there 's also a `` higher benefit '' thing where you essentially get the loan portion as a benefit , and can loan the benefit portion ( i.e. , you get more money for free , but the total per month is the same as for others ) . 
  this is possible for people getting primary or secondary schooling who are over 25 ( or under 25 , but longterm unemployed ) . 
  it also depends on how much you earn and pace . 
  what i denoted is what someone studying 100 % with little or no income . 
  -- ** tl ; dr ** there are some variables and things to account for , but : teenagers in secondary school : ~ ** 110 $ ** per month + possible additions adult education : ~ ** 295 $ ** ( +741 $ loan ) per month \\* + possible additions, 
  what do you mean ? 
  yeah , that 's what i meant by being `` paid '' to go to school . 
  you get money for studying all the way until you leave uni . 
  your parents get the regular ` child benefits ' for you until you 're 16 , after which you get ` study benefits ' as long as you 're in school .
