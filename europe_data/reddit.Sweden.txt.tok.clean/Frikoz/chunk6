  the study benefits are only for ten months of the year since you 're not in school during breaks . 
  in university you also get study benefits , as well as the possibility for an additional low interest loan if you need more . 
  ca n't speak for others but when i was in school i studied full-time . 
  when would i have had time for a part-time job ? 
  if i was n't in class , i was doing homework . 
  i was a lot busier then than i am now . 
  i was paid to go to school 10 months per year , so i went to school ten months per year . 
  during summer break i could have a job . 
  during the school year , school * was * my job . 
  makes sense . 
  i too care more about what stuff goes into my dog than me ... , 
  no mars , nestl\u00e9 , or del monte for you then . 
  what about companies that sell both food and shampoo , like unilever ? 
  and what about companies that have both dog food and toothpaste and such , like colgate-palmolive ? 
  they 're both wrigley 's . 
  i can recall having had both here in sweden as a kid , but considering [ mars nordics ] ( http://www.mars.com/nordics/en/brands.aspx ) has hubba bubba and not boomer , i think they either incorporated it into that here or changed name . 
  [ mars spain ] ( http://www.mars.com/spain/es/brands/chocolate-and-wrigley.aspx ) has boomer but not hubba bubba . 
  no ... my dentist gave me small plastic toys !, 
  much better than your flimsy stickers !, 
  you sure must 've had nicer doctor visits than i did . 
  i got nothing . 
  :( i got them at the local pizza place . 
  blue and green were my favorites . 
  same here . 
   to me they 'll always be `` pizzaklubbor '' . 
  they 're no longer produced . 
  it 's [ this ] ( https://i.imgur.com/xkjhnmo.gifv ) . 
  with [ audio ] ( https://twitter.com/freezze/status/859880227056570368 ) . 
  i 'm assuming you mean [ this gif ] ( https://i.imgur.com/xkjhnmo.gifv ) ? 
  [ here ] ( https://twitter.com/freezze/status/859880227056570368 ) it is with audio for anyone who speaks french . 
  they did n't in sweden , their own country of origin . 
  :( i 'm part of a family subscription though so it 's even less for me . 
  spotify premium . 
  nothing else . 
  i did n't know it was an earthquake until i read the news neither . 
  i really did think that it just was a lorry and promptly went back to sleep . 
  yeah , i had no clue either until i read the news . 
  i just went back to sleep . 
  i do also know plenty who it did n't wake . 
  and i remember at least one newspaper had it in the headlines as if it had been like 2004 indian ocean ... 
  goes to show how used we are to have earthquakes here i guess . 
  i also lived in sm\u00e5land , no where near the epicenter !, 
  but no , it was strong enough to crack an old brittle 19th-century ceiling ... be barely do , we 're nowhere near a plate boundary . 
  occasionally there is little one , but they 're usually so small you have no chance of noticing them . 
  the largest one to affect sweden i believe was the 1904 koster\u00f6 earthquake which measured aprox . 
  but there has to my knowledge not been a single other one ever reaching 5 since we started recording them . 
  [ 2008 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_sk%c3%a5ne_county_earthquake ) . 
  it woke me up and i thought a lorry drove past . 
  terrifying . 
  it did crack our ceiling though which needed to be replastered and painted . 
   is commonly smoked by people in large groups or do people use it privately ? 
  small groups i believe . 
   is there a huge push for recreational or medical legalization ? 
  not huge . 
  it exists , but it 's pretty small . 
  the first instance of medical use being allowed happened just a few months ago iirc , but i did n't pay much attention so i do n't know exactly what was declared . 
   is there a stigma surrounding users like in the us of being lazy or stupid ? 
  not lazy/stupid , you 're seen as a junkie . 
  the general attitude here does n't distinguish cannabis from meth , you 're a * narkoman * no matter what you use . 
   what are the most common ways of consuming it ? 
  rolled spliffs in think . 
  at least among those i know who use . 
  but it 's not my thing and i 'm exceptionally indifferent towards it , so i 'm no expert by any means . 
  hahaha , `` long live sluts '' is probably not the best thing to say when breaking up or maybe that is why you are breaking up ... 
  but , yeah , it may be best not to use it in an otherwise english sentence , ` slut ' can sound pretty strange to english speakers . 
  you get signs like [ these ] ( http://i.imgur.com/awd5j8y.jpg ) ( `` final station '' ) on the train and many old movies , books , and such end with * ` slut . 
  ' * ( `` the end . '', 
  / `` fin . '' ), 
  in swedish * \u00d6 * and * o * are completely different letters , to us the dots are n't simple diacritics . 
  * g\u00f6ra slut * is probably the most common way to say it . 
  it kind of means to `` do [ an ] end [ to the relationship ] '' . 
  i suppose there are a few eupheisms floating around to as well . 
  it depends on who you ask , it 's still `` iffy '' . 
  ever since the svenska akademien separated them in their dictionary 2006 many linguist recognize it as different , but many others do n't . 
  spr\u00e5kr\u00e5det have both separated and not separated since . 
  the last time they had a word beginning with w in nyordslistan was in [ 2010 ] ( http://www.sprakochfolkminnen.se/download/18.5e02b54a144bbda8e9b2a0/1398151028616/spr%c3%a5kr%c3%a5dets+nyordslista+2010+webb2.pdf ) when they did n't , for example . 
  when children are taught to recite the alphabet in school it 's still generally not taught , when people spell out initialisms they 're not separated etc. 
  it 's not really any less iffy than when / u/xeekei went to school in the '90s . 
  in some ways it 's more iffy nowadays , because in the '90s none of the regulatory bodied backed it being a different letter , now even they are n't fully unanimous . 
  but they do generally favor separation nowadays . 
  ** tl ; dr ** svenska akademien separated v and w in their dictionary in 2006 . 
  they did n't end the discussion . 
  it exists in several other languages too . 
  there are essentially three different types of `` double dotted characters '' : the diaeresis , the umlaut , and the individual letter . 
  the * diaeresis * exists primarily in some romance languages but can also be found in for example archaic english . 
  those make sure the vowel is pronounced as it 's own letter and does n't disappear or form a diphthong ( e.g. 
  they 're pronounced like the dotless counterpart is normally pronounced , but are required in instances where a dotless one would n't work the same way . 
  * umlaut * pretty much means `` sound alteration '' and is just that . 
  in theory it 's the dotless letter modified to have a slightly different sound . 
  these are the ones you find in for example german . 
  then there 's the one that are actual individual letters . 
  they have their own place in the alphabet and orthographically they have as little in common with their dotless counterpart , as t has to i. 
  these are the ones you find in turkish , swedish , finnish etc. 
  then there 's of course a fourth type , the `` metal-umlaut '' . 
  that 's something people not accustomed to useful dots probably thinks looks cool or something . 
  this is the type you find in `` mot\u00f6rhead '' and `` m\u00f6tley cr\u00fce '' . 
  those often confuse people who do put value in dots as they 're not actually supposed to affect the pronunciation one bit . 
  they 're counterproductive and stupid . 
   i think that 's all . 
  ** tl ; dr : ** they 're the same , but different .
