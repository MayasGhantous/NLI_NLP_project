  johann strauss is also * d.\u00e4 . 
  * and * d.y. 
  * in swedish . 
  really ca n't think of anyone who 'd be father/son . 
  i get what you 're saying and in this specific context may be a bit more appropriate to use ` elder ' as it 's connected to the dumases , i was more referring to `` den \u00e4ldre '' in general . 
  that 's why i went with ` older ' , it was a deliberate choice . 
  ' \u00c4ldre ' means both and since ` older ' has a wider use that may also overlap with ` elder ' i went with that . 
  but yeah , ` elder ' may be more appropriate when talking about people , in particular familial relations . 
  neither . 
  we use native words , but not for `` father '' / `` son '' . 
  alexandre dumas * den \u00e4ldre * ( `` the older '' ) and alexandre dumas * den yngre * ( `` the younger '' ) . 
  it 's how you usually do it in swedish , it 's essentially our `` senior '' / `` junior '' . 
  they 're shortened * d.\u00e4 . 
  * and * d.y. 
  * respectively . 
  i was taught innocenzo manzetti in school . 
  do n't know if he did invent it , but that 's the name i was taught . 
  i believe most would respond with alexander graham bell if asked though . 
  many others would probably claim bell was a thief that stole the design , but not actually know anything about who he would 've stolen it from . 
  the opposite side is also pretty complicated . 
  you have the lord , god , and father , but then it get 's a little weird when the rest of the trinity enters the picture . 
  dj\u00e4vul is n't necessarily some lower thing . 
  when you use it in definite article ( * dj\u00e4vulen * ) it refers to , well , the devil . 
  it 's like in english i suppose . 
  * the * devil is usually lucifer , * a * devil is just ... a devil ... ? 
  when you talk about the devil you 'd probably usually use * dj\u00e4vulen * . 
  ` fan ' is rarely used as anything other than a profanity , and it 's a pretty mild profanity at that . 
  we also have satan and lucifer too , which means the same as in english . 
  man that guy has many names . 
  satan can also be used as a profanity . 
  two different words for devil . 
  * fan * or * fanden * is one . 
  it 's a word for * the * devil . 
  there is n't a plural . 
  * dj\u00e4vul * or * dj\u00e4vel * is another . 
  it 's * dj\u00e4vlar * in plural . 
  ( as said , d is optional ) . 
  the singular and adjective ( dj\u00e4vla ) is also be used depending on context , but when using it by itself as an interjection you use the plural . 
  yeah . 
  some like the d , some do n't . 
  i grew up with it , so i use it . 
  most probably do n't . 
  is there a difference between ` figa ' and ` fica ' ? 
  i 've heard the latter before , but never the former . 
  as demonstrated in [ this scene ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb78qoqieai ) from the children 's christmas calendar svt aired in 1991 . 
  i believe in keeping it simple . 
  these are probably the most common ones in swedish : word | actual meaning | english equivalent - * ish * -- | -- | -- fan | devil | damn ( d ) j\u00e4vlar | devils | fuck helvete | hell | hell skit | shit | shit ( but not as harsh ) kuk | cock | cock fitta | cunt | cunt hora | whore | whore and maybe stringing together a few of them if you 're feeling creative , like `` dj\u00e4vla skit helvete '' or such . 
   i was also a little unaware that people in northern europe seem to think we ride donkeys , in sombreros while doing a flamenco and drinking sangria before having a siesta wait , what ... ? 
  who have you interacted with that 's given you that impression ? 
  only place here i can imagine finding such beliefs is in some stereotype fueled cartoon from the '30s ...  i 'm always surprised when people think we 're poor and barely surviving , and that there 's no industry here do n't really see any of that either . 
  there have been reports on high unemployment rates and such , but i do n't know anyone who thinks you 're poor and without industry . 
  they mentioned that goal in the annual report too , they 're apparently changing it . 
   our previous target of increasing the number of stores by 10 to 15 percent per year will instead become a sales target that includes both stores and online sales . 
  they had 3962 stores ( 4351 for the whole group ) according to the [ 2016 annual report ] ( http://about.hm.com/content/dam/hmgroup/groupsite/documents/masterlanguage/annual%20report/annual%20report%202016.pdf ) . 
  do n't know what other chains have , but considering that article mentions 1569 things have clearly happened . 
  looking at the competition mentioned in the article you liked they 're still larger . 
  zara had less than 2200 , the whole gap group 3700 . 
  but i do n't know about others . 
  the inditex group is however still larger than the h&m group . 
  edit : looked at the other annual reports for no reason . 
  ah , yes . 
  we also have a bunch of * estonia * related conspiracy theories . 
  it comes from a svt ( public broadcaster ) [ mockumentary from 2002 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/conspiracy_58 ) . 
  its entire purpose was to illustrate how historical revisionism works and the importance of source criticism , so they aired it without telling the audience it was a mockumentary until the very end of the movie iirc . 
  of course , a certain stereotype would make you believe * everyone * is , which obviously is n't true . 
  but i would n't describe it as any less than pretty common , it is one of the countries with the highest percentage . 
  ah , thanks for the correction . 
  we would with all certainty still have one if we ever were to leave the eu . 
  so the inner six ? 
  no portugal , ireland , switzerland or such allowed if they wanted to ? 
  what data are those maps based on ? 
   the countries that founded the europe what do you mean by that ? 
  no such statistics are kept in sweden so it 's impossible to accurately know exactly how common . 
  it 's pretty common . 
  i am on both counts myself . 
  with a non-binding referendum . 
  i do n't know if there technically would * need * to be one , the only times referendums are required by law is to change our `` fundamental laws '' ( essentially constitution ) , but for such major decisions we always have advisory referendums . 
  we had one about joining the eu , we had one about adopting the euro , we 'd need one about leaving the eu . 
  nah , you 're probably fine . 
  he speaks norwegian . 
  he just makes it a little bit more swede-friendly when he has swedish guests on . 
  refraining from difficult words and such . 
  if it 's the swedish guests you 're talking about then , yeah ... they do usually speak swedish if you could n't tell that apart . 
  the languages are pretty similar , there 's a reason we understand each other without switching language . 
  there are greater dialectal differences within each of the two languages , than there is immediately across the border of the two different languages . 
  what makes a dialect a language is mostly political . 
  yeah , it 's * mysig * in swedish . 
  same thing really , just a different word . 
  skavlan is a half swedish show . 
  the man himself is a norwegian who often speaks svorsk ( swedish-norwegian `` patois '' ) . 
  in regards to production the first season was swedish , 2-3 were swedish/norwegian , and season 4 + is norwegian . 
  it originally airs on both svt ( swedish ) and nrk ( norwegian ) . 
  so all in all it 's not * not * swedish , it 's norwegian-swedish . 
  no , because i 'm not norwegian . 
   it is pretty * mysigt * now though , before it was stressful . 
  you 're looking at it . 
  i 'm here on reddit trying to forget i do n't have a life . 
  january 1 , 1975 . 
  the instrument of government was created and adopted in 1973-74 , it went into effect with the start of 1975 . 
  now he 's only of ceremonial and representative role .
