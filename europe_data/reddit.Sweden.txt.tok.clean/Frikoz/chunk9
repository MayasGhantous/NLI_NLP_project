  are . 
  sure , it 's more similar to the indian panc that inspired punch than those , but it 's still it 's own drink . 
  i 'm just saying the punsch and punch are n't the same since your comment seemed to really make a point of that not being swedish . 
  nothing more . 
  punsch is uniquely swedish ( + a bit finnish as we were one , but more popular here ) , punch is n't . 
  just like sangr\u00eda is spanish and caipirinha is brazilian . 
  it 's not wikipedia being wikipedia , they 're not synonymous . 
  punch ! = punsch . 
  as it says at the very top of the very wiki page / u/jesuissuedois linked , `` punsch is not to be confused with punch '' . 
  the origin for the swedish name is disputed . 
  that it 's derived from the english `` punch '' is but one of the possibilities . 
  you could argue that it , like sangr\u00eda , is a subtype of punch , but they do not equal each other . 
  the english `` punch '' is referred to as `` b\u00e5l '' in swedish , `` punsch '' is something different . 
   your post was one of the reasons i started this thread , so do n't think you 're not being heard . 
  no no , i do n't think that . 
  i just wanted to reiterate it since you asked what we thought could be improved . 
   i 'm afraid that 's not / r/askreddit problem , but just reddit problem . 
  think you mean / r/askeurope but yeah , i know . 
  that 's exactly what i said in the second sentence of that paragraph !, 
   i just wanted to mention it for people to see . 
  i do n't think this sub is the worst offender , but it 's a trend i 've unfortunately noticed increasing here . 
  according to the national [ public health agency ] ( https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/livsvillkor-levnadsvanor/alkohol-narkotika-dopning-tobak-och-spel-andts/tobak/utvecklingen-av-bruket/ ) for 2015 : 10 % of boys and 14 % of girls claim to smoke in year 9 ( i.e. 
  15-year-olds , technically primary school here ) . 
  25 % of boys and 27 % of girls claim to smoke in year 2 of the gymnasium ( i.e. 
  17-year-olds ) . 
  i present to you [ the vodka belt ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/vodkabelt.png ) . 
  the name `` vodka '' was n't really used that much in sweden until we wanted international sales though , it was referred to as * br\u00e4nnvin * ( `` burn wine '' ) as all other strong , clear , distilled spirits . 
  polish and finnish vodka is also really good . 
  no , never . 
   do you think its common in your area ? 
  no clue . 
  hey now , the root vegetable should n't be capitalised unless it starts the sentence . 
  if you capitalise it mid-sentence it magically transforms into a person linguistically . 
  it 's believed to have originated in the scandinavian region . 
  and it 's known to have spread to a lot of places from just sweden , which is why it became known as the `` swedish turnip '' and the shortened `` swede '' in some places . 
  in 17th century german it 's also denoted as `` schwedische r\u00fcbe '' because it came from sweden . 
  in north american english it 's commonly called `` rutabaga '' , which comes from a dialectal swedish word for the root vegetable . 
  in sweden we just call it descriptively , * k\u00e5lrot * ( `` cabbage root '' ) . 
  but that 's probably enough neep knowledge for today . 
  it 's hidden for five minutes here , but i do n't know how much hiding it actually affects voting on a sub like this . 
  this is a small sub and i do n't think it has that much actual hivemind behavior , i think it 's mostly just biased voting presenting itself as such . 
  you ca n't remove it , you can only hide it with custom css . 
  which this subreddit actually does for non-subscribers . 
  you could of course hide it from everyone , but it 's very easy to disable custom css and it would n't affect most mobile clients at all . 
  and by removing it , you also remove the possibility of using it for its intended purpose : to downvote people not actually contributing . 
   what could use an improvement ? 
  i think the flairs need to be reworked . 
  i 've [ already voiced some of my concerns ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/62xktz/the_papal_states_are_no_more_new_flairs/dfpv9wr/ ) about them , and stand by what i said then . 
  sometimes i feel it get 's a little hivemindy and that people vote too much based on their preference . 
  but i know this is difficult to prevent and is prevalent all over reddit , so i do n't really know what could be improved . 
  i 've not really faced much of that myself as my view seem to align pretty well here , but i 've seen it and do wish people would stop downvoting people who actually contribute just because they disagree . 
  i disagree with a lot too , but i do n't try to silence them because of it . 
  downvoting 's for stuff that does n't contribute . 
  i know reddit is an awful platform for discussion , but since this is a small sub i 'd wish we 'd keep it civil . 
   what do you think about the traffic here ? 
  pretty good . 
  if it gets too big i 'd probably leave . 
   would you say your country has a strong enough presence here ? 
  i suppose . 
  we generally do on reddit . 
   are they actually shown on mainstream channels ? 
  nope . 
   nba basketball is pretty popular to play with simplified rules during pe , and there is a small competitive scene . 
  but i do n't know a single person who watches nba or such . 
   nhl not really . 
  hockey 's very popular , but nhl not as much . 
  easily the easiest american sport league to watch , but it does n't really have that great following . 
  it 's more our own leagues and international hockey that draws crowds . 
   nfl american football is even less popular than rugby , and the average swede gives a rat 's ass about the latter . 
   and i assume baseball is an unknown sport in europe ? 
  not unknown , everyone knows what it is . 
  but no one watches it . 
  everyone knows [ br\u00e4nnboll ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/br%c3%a4nnboll ) is the real `` hit ball with bat and run '' - game !, 
  we had a [ swedish translation ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_xenfz8dmq ) of the english song . 
  the [ original japanese intro ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7csb1izu_8u ) sounds more like the german one / u/buddhakekz linked . 
  yeah , i know . 
  when i lived in spain i was apartment hunting for quite a while and went on a ton viewings . 
  i think i must 've seen every combination possible ... 
  i remember once i was in a building without * any * numbering or door bells giving hints at all , and they 'd told me to knock when i got there , so i ended up standing there knocking on a storage room like a fool ... and , not to brag , but i do have a real nice machine . 
  i still use the big ones in the basement when i have a lot of laundry , but my own is good enough for regular use . 
  actually there 's no fighting here either , i live in a building with 95 % pensioners who do all their laundry when i 'm busy working . 
  the whole saturday is always open , and that 's when i want to do it anyway . 
  so , ha !, 
  if there is more than one residence on the same address , there is an ordinance requiring a four digit apartment number per residence . 
  i 've not heard of any exceptions . 
  you can read about it on [ lantm\u00e4teriet ] ( https://www.lantmateriet.se/sv/fastigheter/fastighetsinformation/lagenhetsregistret/innehall/lagenhetsnummer/ ) , if you 've really never heard of it . 
  that said , those numbers are what 's in the official registry and some property owners use their own systems too . 
  as i said my apartment is registered on `` 1201 '' , but is otherwise known as `` apartment 3 '' . 
  oh , but the first two digits do indicate floor , the second two the door number , it 's simple !, 
  when i lived in spain you 'd usually just get a number like `` 3-2 '' , it 's really the exact same principle : first floor , then door . 
  we just standardized ours so you always can know regardless of building layout . 
  which was incredibly annoying in spain , i might add . 
  not only do y' all count floors and doors real weird to begin with , it 's also very inconsistent ... 
  the `` first '' floor is often the third , but not always , because that 'd be too easy . 
  and you only seem to count doors leading to actual apartments , which would makes sense * if * i could somehow know which doors actually had apartments behind them and you did n't use the exact same doors for storage rooms etc. . . : / living in spain is so much more difficult ... :p that said i do n't know anyone who actually uses our four digit numbers in everyday life here . 
  i technically live in `` 1201 '' , but everyone just knows it as `` apartment 3 '' and that is what it says on the floor plan by the entrance . 
  `` 1201 '' is really just the official designation which is required for the registry . 
  do n't other countries have some system ? 
  also , how do you know about that ? 
  i have one next to the apartment door , one on the letterbox down by the entrance to the building , and one on the buzzer/unlock-thing ( whatever it 's called ? ),
