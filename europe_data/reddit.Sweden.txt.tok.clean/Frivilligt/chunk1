not really , lots of only-english speakers in his field in stockholm . 
  that was not something i said . 
  it 's just that being in nato , it will mean further cooperation with usa 's military , and there is then a possibility of nato bases in sweden . 
  that 's not something i 'd want . 
  but by being a small country in nato , we will have little to say and there might be lot of demands from nato . 
  it 's better for us to stay outside in my opinion . 
  it was still a bad argument . 
  all criticism to nato is not russian propaganda ? 
  united states has an air base in stavanger , the 426th air base squadron . 
  it 's probably safer to not be in nato for sweden . 
  nato 's defence is built around nuclear weapons , and the further `` away '' we are from them the safer we are . 
  yeah , russia wo n't attack sweden anyways so i think we 're safe too . 
  i doubt anyone expects nato support in that case . 
  you 're just calling me ignorant without explaining why i am wrong . 
  sweden and finland wo n't join nato in any time soon . 
  the new swedish government has explicitly said they are against joining nato thankfully . 
  ugh i hope we do n't . 
  i would not want any american soldiers here , or to have sweden send troops to wherever usa wants . 
  subtitles exists , but i do n't watch with it . 
  it 's just that some american series will not be released at all on the swedish netflix . 
  i think netflix just does not have the licens to broadcast all series internationally . 
  * netflix with the same series and movies as in usa ( the swedish edition of netflix has a very limited selection ) * some fast food brand , like chipotle or in n ' out * there are a lot of cools apps in san francisco that lets you order food on apps like grubhub , that could be cool to have here . 
  there exists some alternatives in europe though , nothing major though that many people use i think . 
  it counts estonia , latvia and parts of germany as former swedish colonies ... okay ... 
  seriously , someone should have punched him in the face . 
  he also only chose smaller people or girls so there would be no risk for him . 
  i bet there are more posts about russia though . 
  easier to post news about uk since most of it will be in english anyway . 
  i think it 's more a case of russian trolling to see how bad our defence is and to show russia 's military power ( which has been going on for many years ) . 
  the swedish military has been unusually open about these russian breaches these lasts months , probably in order to get more funding from the newly appointed government . 
  if you 're at a fancy restaurant you can tip 10 % in sweden , if the service was okay/good . 
  otherwise not needed ( you can round it up to some even number at bars if you want to be nice ) . 
  why do they like germany more than for example the netherlands or belgium ? 
  it 's pretty difficult to come up with anything negative about benelux countries . 
  thank you !, 
  53 % of youths who are * actively looking * for a job are unemployed ( they exclude those who are inactive ) . 
  while only about 20 % of the spanish youth are looking for a job . 
  for the [ full definitions ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/eu_labour_force_survey_-_methodology#labour_force_status_definition ) you can look at eurostat again . 
  look a [ this picture ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/images/8/84/population_employed_unemployed_inactive%2c_2012.png ) for a better understanding . 
  in the unemployment rate you only count the active labour force . 
  [ they use surveys to count unemployment , but they use national statistics to interpolated/extrapolated the data from the surveys . 
  ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/unemployment_statistics#data_sources_and_availability )  these monthly data are estimates based on results of the european union labour force survey ( eu lfs ) , which is a continuous household survey carried out in all member states . 
   [ ... ]  the quarterly labour force survey results are always used as a benchmark to ensure international comparability . 
   [ ... ]  member states may publish other rates such as register-based unemployment rates , or rates based on the national lfs or corresponding surveys . 
  these rates may vary from those published by eurostat due to a different definition or methodological choices . 
  i see people asking the same questions on all of these unemployment statistics . 
  so i 'm just going to try to write what i know about these studies . 
  they measure unemployment by doing [ a phone survey ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/employment_unemployment_lfs/introduction ) , where they each quarter do 1.8 million interviews . 
  so it 's the same method used for all countries . 
  when you count unemployment , you only count those who are actively looking for jobs . 
  this means that a housewife who does not look for a job , is not counted as unemployed . 
  while a student who is looking for work , is counted as unemployed . 
  so it 's not like 53 % percent of spanish youths are looking for jobs but unable to find it . 
  many youths are `` inactive '' in the job market ( for example students ) . 
  so if students in a country are expected to find work part time , then the youth unemployment will be high . 
  the ** unemployment ratio ** will count everyone instead : unemployment ratio = number of unemployed youths looking for job / number of total youths in country you can see the [ unemployment ratio here ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/images/4/42/youth_unemployment%2c_2013q4_%28%25%29.png ) . 
  where for example spain has 20.8 % youth unemployment ratio . 
  the problem with youth unemployment is that it does not take into consideration the different cultures . 
  so it can be difficult to compare youth unemployment between countries . 
  [ eurostat has a great article on this ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/participation_of_young_people_in_education_and_the_labour_market#country_differences ) where they point out that differences in cultures and institutions . 
  for example for scandinavia + nl + uk young people start to look for jobs at a very early age , and as a result there is sizeable unemployment among students at 15 to 17 years of age . 
  students are counted as unemployed if they are actively looking for a job . 
  you can not compare youth unemployment between countries using different methods . 
  the swiss youth unemployment you point out probably has another method to count youth unemployment compared to eurostat .

  in every country students are counted as unemployed , if the student is actively looking for job . 
  eurostat does surveys in all countries where they call people and ask if they are looking for job . 
  they use the same method for all countries . 
  you can [ read more here ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/unemployment_statistics#data_sources_and_availability ) :  these monthly data are estimates based on results of the european union labour force survey ( eu lfs ) , which is a continuous household survey carried out in all member states in accordance with european legislation and on the basis of harmonised definitions . 
  these results are interpolated/extrapolated to monthly data using national survey data and/or national monthly series on registered unemployment, 
  no eurostat 's does phone interviews to measure unemployment , they do not rely on any national statistics ( or they use it extrapolate with national data to see relative difference between surveys as i have understood it ) . 
  see [ here ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/employment_unemployment_lfs/introduction ) :  each quarter some 1.8 million interviews are conducted throughout the participating countries to obtain statistical information for some 100 variables . 
  the sampling rates in the various countries vary between 0.2 % and 3.3 % . 
  in eurostat students are counted as unemployed if they are actively looking for work . 
  i think most countries have these sort of things right ? 
  i know you can do this in sweden as well , at least online . 
  he shows his skills in self-defense on a reporter here : http://val.tv4.se/artiklar/h%c3%a4r-kopplar-l%c3%b6fven-grepp-p%c3%a5-tv4s-reporter-5410b4dac45948af7f00003c, 
  stefan l\u00f6fven is our prime minister . 
  he was placed in an orphanage 10 months after his birth but was later placed in a foster family . 
  his foster father was a lumberjack and then a factory worker , while his foster mother , worked as a health visitor . 
  he began working as a welder , but after two years he was chosen as the group 's union representative , and went on to work for the union . 
  eventually he became the chairman of one of the largest and most powerful unions in sweden . 
  he was then in 2012 chosen to be the leader of the social democratic party . 
  sweden uses almost no natural gas , so in reality it 's not dependent on gas from russia . 
  why destroy a perfect pictures with hdr . . ugh,
