  you could for example meet a former prime minister on the streets and go and talk to him if you want to . 
  i do n't know but this makes me really sad . 
  especially knowing that one time nokia once dominated the phone market , together with ericsson . 
  the [ russian national anthem ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmzfxn1uopw ) is so powerful . 
  i want to become a communist just by listening to it . 
  here is illegal to pick up things from trash containers , i think . 
  if you throw something , it belongs to the trash company , so it 'd stealing . 
  is that not illegal ? 
  the tax cuts made by the government . 
  it 's one year from elections so they try to win the public with it . 
  it also means that no other reforms can be made without breaking the budget the next years , so the left wing parties must then raise taxes if they want to do any `` welfare '' reforms . 
  that 's priceless . 
  and i did n't know that germans liked to dig holes at beaches . 
  found [ this article ] ( http://www.thelocal.de/society/20100922-30013.html ) about a german almost killing himself while digging a hole . 
  lol, 
  german tourists have the worst reputation in sweden . 
  they steal signs on the side of the road because of the `` funny '' elk warning sign . 
   equal opportunity ... families . 
  great explanation . 
   but , does this apply also to non native swedish speakers ? 
  to be honest , i do not know . 
  i have lived in a dorm with other europeans ( germans , spaniards ) and they seemed to live pretty much exactly like we swedes did . 
  they were on exchange though , so it was pretty chill for them study wise . 
   do many immigrants ( particularly native english speakers ) move to sweden and make friends ? 
  or are they seen as more of a nuisance ? 
  i know to little to make an informed statement , but if i make some generalisations : * exchange students usually hang out with other exchange students , but i 've understood it 's like that everywhere . 
  * if someone speaks bad swedish it 's of course not as fun to be with them , so then maybe they 'd be seen as irritating . 
  * an english speaking foreigner would be more interesting than pretty much any other nationality ( because of movies from uk and usa ) . 
  new zealand ? 
  then i 'd pick uk . 
  great culture , fun people , but bad weather . 
  no , life is great in sweden if you 're employed . 
  it just sucks for the 7 % or so that not have jobs . 
   progressive country with a high quality of life i think you 'd find that scandinavia is not so different from any other western region . 
  i do not really know what you expect . 
  it 's not like you get paid for doing nothing , you have to work to get welfare . 
   not sure if i could sacrifice having a good conversation with a stranger or giving a random guy a ride to the store for a being a part of such an economically fair country . 
  the thing is that * most swedes * ( there are exceptions of course ) do n't like talking a lot to strangers . 
  they would feel you were intruding their personal space , and you 'd be the one that is rude . 
  :p if it makes any sense ... we make friends through work , school , sports or other social gatherings . 
  i mean there is no way to measure if a country 's people are cold or not , but if you want to read a [ long report by eu ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ity_offpub/ks-58-04-998/en/ks-58-04-998-en.pdf ) you can see that scandinavians spend more time socialising with friends and family than other european countries . 
  we do also visit friend 's homes more , but that might be more due to the climate than anything else . 
  i think many english native speakers also assume that just because scandinavians can speak english , they do not have learn the language their residing in . 
  that 's a mistake because it can be tiresome and boring to socialise in english ( it 's not very easy to be funny in a second language ... ) . 
  hope i could fill in some gaps here , but i have never lived outside of sweden so i base my `` knowledge '' on experience from meeting other foreigners who have decided to move to sweden . 
  norway , it 's like sweden but with a better economy . 
  that 's the most balkan sounding song i 've ever heard . 
  well wake me up with avicii is played a lot ... everywhere . 
  [ niello - legenden feat phantomen ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqe1b4heodk ) is a swedish song though that 's popular at the moment . 
  i 'm impressed that my grandma pay her bills online , even though she can barely see . 
  these fish feminists have taken it too far . 
  i think also people are reading into different things . 
  some show houses that are charasteristic for < insert country  , but perhaps not the most common houses . 
  or the otherway around . 
  i mean these big blocks sure are common , but they do not have any particular polish about them ... :p, 
  dunno , tradition i guess . 
  you could fly it on name days too if you want . 
  it 's in the city of karlstad , which have a population of like 60k . 
  i think the city planning is just old for that part of town , but i doubt there are many cars there except for the people who live there anyway . 
  usually it 's [ pavements like this ] ( https://www.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;ll=59.323907,17.946596&amp;spn=0.029733,0.090637&amp;sll=59.390003,13.52078&amp;sspn=0.003731,0.01133&amp;t=h&amp;hnear=bromma,+sweden&amp;z=14&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=59.323975,17.947378&amp;panoid=n33-7i9ozpjmxikc7hy2xq&amp;cbp=12,332.25,,0,5.47 ) where villas are located . 
  yes !, 
  on flag days and birthdays . 
  here 's a [ cute swedish house ] ( https://www.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;ie=utf8&amp;ll=58.014588,14.459467&amp;spn=0.007718,0.022681&amp;sll=58.14172,15.842285&amp;sspn=3.961512,11.612549&amp;oq=lin&amp;t=h&amp;hnear=link%c3%b6ping,+sweden&amp;z=16&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=58.014511,14.459399&amp;panoid=nvfpmsbsgrov-jsi3gi4fq&amp;cbp=12,264.73,,0,4.87 ) with the lake v\u00e4ttern in the background . 
  the most typical swedish house should be red though , [ maybe something like this ] ( https://www.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;ll=59.38213,13.481491&amp;spn=0.007421,0.022659&amp;sll=58.174029,13.954611&amp;sspn=0.015457,0.045362&amp;t=h&amp;hnear=uppsala,+sweden&amp;z=16&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=59.382039,13.48153&amp;panoid=ckvl-2nsk5_yrt9s8_hsla&amp;cbp=12,255.93,,0,3.64 ) . 
  we call diet products for ** light ** , for example light coke . 
  also walkmans are called ** freestyles ** for some reason ... 
  or maybe it was just that obama had already visited denmark and norway , and stockholm would be a quick hop over to st petersburg ( where he is going after one night in stockholm ) . 
  the show made germany look very boring . 
  i wonder how someone can stand working at that pencil factory , i would n't be able to do it for a day . 
  quite difficult to stereotype the whole europe , some of the things listed to not hold for sweden . 
  still a fun article . 
  :-)  a 100-year old house or church is considered new by europeans , but old by americans . 
  i have even heard americans think that 200 years was `` ancient '' . 
  100 year old house is considered new ? 
  not for me atleast . 
  sure 200 years is no way ancient ... esp not for churches but most swedes live in houses that were made < 70 years ago or later . 
   europeans write the date in the format `` day month year '' , in sweden the official use is `` year month day '' . 
   europeans tend to be more liberal regarding soft drugs , prostitution , alcohol quite the contrary in sweden . 
  wops , it should be : smallest republic . 
  smallest state in europe . 
  it 's located on a mountain . 
  has a population of around 30k . 
  i visited it some years ago , it was nice . 
  you have to put in your pin code to transfer so it should be as safe as any internet payment !, 
  it 's free between all major banks in sweden . 
  they have even cooperated and created a mobile phone app called swish , that let 's you send money instantly between friends if you know their phone number ( for free ) !, 
  ** environment and climate change ** as it is a problem that can only be solved by working globally . 
  midsummer = summer solstice . 
  it 's like the 2nd largest celebration in sweden after christmas . 
  best : great opportunities in high-tech sectors like software , web startups etc worst : the dark winter ( it 's not that cold actually , relatively speaking :p ), 
  oh you passive-aggresive finns . 
  sweden is the largest arms exporter per capita . 
  y\u00e4y ? 
  minecraft is missing from sweden !, 
  and angry birds for finland :p, 
  no snakes . 
  let 's not forget justin bieber . 
  yes , he 's from canada . 
  omg i love the meatballs haha, 
  this is just too random .
