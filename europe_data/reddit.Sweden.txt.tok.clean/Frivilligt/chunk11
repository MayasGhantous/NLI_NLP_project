  my two favourites as well . 
  romania is going to win !, 
  i actually voted for norway now . 
  am i a bad person now ? 
  neighbour voting and all ... 
  i am sure of that , it was more a joke than anything else but good to know . 
  this is gon na be emberassing edit : okay it was funny for a swede at least : ddd, 
  there was an interview with him on swedish tv before the eurovision started . 
  he seemed quite annoyed . 
  we begin at 19/20 , 
  a song about peace from russia . 
  mhmh believable, 
  he 's 23 and a doctor . 
  should i trust maltas hospitals ? 
  lol, 
  black n white , why ? 
  she 's so boring . 
  gahh . 
  you can change to total under `` data '' to the right . 
  it 's from [ eurostat ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/graph.do?pcode=tsdec420&amp;language=en ) . 
  citation from eurostat : `` the employment rate is calculated by dividing the number of persons aged 20 to 64 in employment by the total population of the same age group . 
  the indicator is based on the eu labour force survey . 
  the survey covers the entire population living in private households and excludes those in collective households such as boarding houses , halls of residence and hospitals . 
  employed population consists of those persons who during the reference week did any work for pay or profit for at least one hour , or were not working but had jobs from which they were temporarily absent . '', 
  i took this from eurostat . 
  edit : i could see a protestant / catholic-divide , but i suppose its wrong . 
  highest in the world ? 
  all of the scandinavian countries have lower sucide rate than france , new zealand , usa , russia , etc. 
  the unites states . 
  i 'm from sweden . 
  most swedes have a very bad picture of russia and most do not really know anything about brazil ( except their great national fotball team ) . 
  rasperry pi , last.fm and king.com ( develops lot of facebook games ) are some great brittish start ups i came to think of . 
  and large companies definitely helps the `` start up communities '' , like nokia and ericsson in finland and sweden , i think . 
  voluntarily * in that case, 
  frivilligt = freely, 
  that 's quite some leading questions you have there . 
  i honestly do not care if the mods are british or not , if they were nominated or not , as long as they do their job correct . 
  you got ta keep that record of drinking most coffee per capita , keep drinking !, 
  italians , the coffee snobs of europe . 
  :p i wonder what would happend if a starbucks opened in your country , most people would boycott it i suppose ? 
  i love the sound when making percolated coffee , but it feels like it is mostly grandmas that use it . 
  iced coffe sure is nice too , in the summer at least . 
  i 've understood it 's some kind of hype for the `` moccamaster '' , why is that ? 
  lol . 
  is it not the same as most filter machines ? 
  i meant drip brew . 
  it 's not the same colour , look at the legend . 
  it 's like when swedes say you go to `` the continent '' , when we travel outside of scandinavia . 
  even though , we 're actually on the same continent . 
  this was the best oscars for sweden in a long time : * best documentary was won by a swede ( malik bendjelloul ) * best sound editing , shared , ( zero dark thirty ) was won by paul nj ottosson * best sound editing , shared , ( skyfall ) was won by per hallberg, 
  all [ baltic states ] ( http://i.imgur.com/na11pdd.png ) seem to have very high homicide rate . 
  i do not think it 's a statistical mistake , because the trend over the years seem to be that you have among the highest rates in europe . 
  1 minute googling and here 's the maps . 
  :p [ europe ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/web/_svg/eurostat_map_tps00122_2018370424_download_tmp_embed.png ) vs [ us ] ( http://www.nimh.nih.gov/statistics/images/cdc-map2000-2006deathrates-final-720.jpg ) . 
  hungary has the 3rd highest sucide rate , eh , even higher than finland . 
  i 've posted both of these maps . 
  i think the comparsion is interesting , i see them very rarely , us vs eu that is . 
  that is also why i posted them when i found them . 
  it 's also made by eu so i 'm pretty sure they 've have made sure it 's quality data etc before publishing them . 
  a [ large pdf of maps and more information can be found here ( warning , it 's like  100 mb ) ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/docoffic/official/reports/cohesion5/pdf/5cr_en.pdf ) . 
  floorball as the second largest participated sport . 
  ice hockey is the second largest watched sport . 
  i mean , today in spain , they 're protesting because ibera is laying off 3k people : http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/436482/20130218/iberia-strike-protest-flights-cancelled-staff-lay.htm it 's more interesting , than 90 persons being laid off in norway . 
  i 'm sure these opera engineers will find jobs very quick . 
  the swedish mentality is ** individualism served by the state ** . 
  it means that no one is dependent on another person , only by the state . 
  so no parent has to save money for their childs university education , it 's taken care by the state . 
  there are ( almost ) no housewives , as they should be economically independent from their husbands . 
  you do not even have to rely on your friends , because if your company fails or you lose your job , they state will always back you up . 
  this is probably why we have the most single households in the world , tha largest amount of women in the workforce and a low percentage of `` young adults '' living with their parents . 
  this do also means that swedes hate having debts to anyone , people will even pay back `` loans '' of just some cent . 
  we do also have a culture of consensus , which means that there will always be endless meetings until everyone has agreed to something . 
  we 're very afraid of conflict , kind of like japanese . 
  we do also have some proverbs like `` speaking is silver , silence is gold '' , but foreigners will probably think we 're cold or smug when we 're quiet . 
  all of these `` traits '' i think come from the fact that we 've been a cold sparsly populated country , so you have to trust and be in agreement with your neighbours to survive the winters . 
  90 people , is this even newsworthy ? 
  it 's not so suprising really , since they 've adopted webkit . 
  i mean , in comparsion , in november ericsson laid off 1500 people in sweden . 
  yes . 
  the founder of ikea is from sm\u00e5land , and he 's known to be cheap and greedy , so he fits into the stereotype . 
  people would say that as a joke . 
  like everyone outside of stockholm thinks we 're snobby . 
  edit : when i lived outside of stockholm in rural areas , people did n't really know anything about stockholms `` inner city '' and its suburbs . 
  people thought of the typical stockholmian as a `` one stereotype '' . 
  so uhh ... 
  i do n't think so , because that 'd be me . 
  it 's mostly about people from sk\u00e5ne ( scania ) . 
  that they 're not really swedish , half-danish , or whatever . 
  and that they talk very weird . 
  but stereotypes about other people are : * that sm\u00e5l\u00e4nningar , or people from sm\u00e5land , are cheap . 
  * that norrl\u00e4nningar are a bit slow , at least they speak slow , and that they 're shy . 
  * people from gothenborg have bad jokes , and everyone has the name glenn . 
  etc, 
  yes , it really does . 
  fortunately there was a fire there last year or something , so i think it 's going to be rebuilt ( but it 's still standing ) !, 
  oh , it 's quite fun that you have some words `` about swedes '' in german . 
  i read this article on wikipedia about ` alte schwede ' , which would be one more of those expressions i suppose . 
  but i 've never understood if it 's a good expression or not ? 
  if you just say if when you 're suprised ? 
  the [ kth school of architecture ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/kth_arkitektur_20060805.jpg/1280px-kth_arkitektur_20060805.jpg ) , has been chosen as the ugliest building in stockholm several times !,
