  quite ironic , is n't ... , 
  not trying to defend it , but you mean just like usa ? 
   native american women were also victims of sterilization abuse up into the 1970s . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eugenics_in_the_united_states or how japan removed its last eugenics laws in 1996 . 
   laws that decreed compulsory sterilization of the disabled were abolished with the approval of the mother 's body protection law on june 18 , 1996 . http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eugenics_in_japan i guess most countires has its dark history ... 
  i had not heard that they wanted to legalize drunken driving . 
  good to know . 
  but seriously , they [ irish times ] seem to obsess a bit too much of what other countries report on ireland . 
  such news stories come as fast as they are forgotten . 
  it 's like how they believe in china that there is a [ town in sweden where they only allow lesbians ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/6280464/women-only-town-of-swedish-lesbians-does-not-exist.html# ) to live . 
  or how everyone believes that our rape laws in sweden are insane after the julian assange case . 
  he 's trolling hard . 
  though swedes would be ashamed if they were 23 + and living at home ( not the parents of course ) . 
  you have to present it in a fun way , i suppose . 
  people always love maps and infographics here on reddit it seems . 
  there is / r/tillsverige for that . 
  you should make it .

  yeah , i guess we both did pretty typical `` western block/eastern block '' with nordic and southern europe as separate . 
  i could n't put greece in eastern so i had to make a suthern europe as well . 
  nobody in sweden talks about central europe ( noone really knows that it 's sensitive to be called eastern europe in poland for example ) . 
  swedish : * tjej , from romani , means girl * jycke , from romani , means dog * lattjo , from romani , means fun ( as an adjective ) swedish slang : * haja , from romani , means ` to understand ' * pr\u00f6jsa , from romani , means ` to pay ' * kirra , from romani , means ` to fix ' * vischan , from romani , means countryside, 
  netherlands : 4 percent worse of broadband connection than sweden . 
  feels good , at least i 've butter . 
  sweden : best broadband access in the eu . \u2122, 
  ** best : ** the order in the society . 
  there is very little social unrest or what you would call it !, 
  for example : we would never have those strikes that they have in france , where farmers dump shit on the street to protest . 
  ** worst : ** the muddy snow . 
  it 's killing me right now , it makes everything ugly . 
  the mud and the snow . 
  bulgaria and serbia , with their respective 7m population , do still perform very well !, 
  there is no competition in school in scandinavia , no parent will push their kids . 
  i meant the one you replied to, 
  obvious troll is obvious ? 
  [ r\u00f6yksopp ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/r%c3%b6yksopp ) from norway is great . 
  exactly . 
  mumbai would have low purchase power per capita , but probarbly pretty high puchase power density aka purchase power per km ^ 2 . 
  someone said it in the other thread at / r/mapporn , that perhaps companies would want to know where to locate their business for maximal purchase power . 
  but it is indeed redundant , it really becomes the population density map you talk about . 
  i believe it 's adjusted for taxes and such . 
  i guess netherlands generous retirement system could impact its purchase power for example . 
  belgium does also have a higher public dept-to-gdp ratio compared to netherlands so eventually they might have to pay it back in taxes . 
  a small population would need less hospitals , stores , etc anyway . 
  it 's purchasing power per km ^ 2 ( or a similar measurement ) . 
  so all places with high population density will of course also be `` high '' on that map . 
  the map i submitted shows per capita instead , so even though northern sweden and northern norway might not `` generate much money '' ( because of small population ) , it is still more money per inhabitant compared to eastern europe for example . 
  they measure different things , the map he linked was purchase power per km ^ 2 , but it says nothing about how each person has it . 
  the map i submitted shows purchase power per capita instead . 
  between 30 min to 1h lunch is what i should have written . 
  i usually eat pretty quickly though . 
  true , but if you get food to go and eat at the office you can get done in 30 min . 
  not as nice as eating in a restaurant though . 
  1 and 1.5 hours for lunch ? 
  i thought about 30 min was normal for lunch at larger corporations . 
  found this map on [ the guardian ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/23/young-europeans-may-die-at-earlier-age-than-their-grandparents-says-who ) , with data from who . 
  malta is the fattest and austria the slimmest . 
  yeah , 7-8 pm sounds weird to me too . 
  it sets at [ 4:45 pm in los angeles ] ( http://www.timeanddate.com/sun/usa/los-angeles?month=12&amp;year=2015 ) for example . 
  it 's not really cold in stockholm though , because of the sea . 
  with average low temperatures at 23 f. it 's much colder in states like minnesota , etc. 
  does n't bother me , i 'm used to it . 
  the summers in sweden have 19 hours sunlight instead . 
  i did spend this winter in california though , and the climate change made me more active compared to how i 'd be in sweden . 
  you definitely spend more time indoors in the swedish winter . 
  sweden spends the [ 8th most money on its military budget in eu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_of_the_european_union#expenditure_and_personnel ) ( or 6th per capita if you wan na measure that ) , so it 's probably better than some other nato states . 
  unemployment from eurostat is not counted from ` bureaus ' . 
  they do interviews/surveys that are harmonised between countries , so the same method is used for all countries . 
  [ look at their wiki for more info ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/unemployment_statistics#data_sources_and_availability ) :  these monthly data are estimates based on results of the european union labour force survey ( eu lfs ) , which is a continuous household survey carried out in all member states, 
  it 's not the largest party in the parliament, 
  like europe , this is old . 
  lack of big cities ? 
  which will make most european countries boring . 
  dutch and danish - sounds like they have something stuck in their throat . 
  norwegian - happy swedish french - too many guttural sounds spanish - sounds like someone wants to talk really fast portugese - like spanish italian - i 'm mostly thinking about someone shouting while doing hand motions slavic languages - sounds mostly the same to me , do n't know enough about them to have an opinion . 
  lawl that swenglish . 
  hugga is to cut in swedish : <, 
  somewhat related , but i often find it funny when people from other countries talk about `` not using paper '' to save trees . 
  if you look at [ statistics ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pulp_and_paper_industry ) the paper industry is dominated by countries like sweden , finland and usa where trees are abundant . 
  for every tree they ~ ~ hug ~ ~ cut down , they will also plant a new one , it 's a renewable resource after all . 
  so people should use more paper !, 
  good luck . 
  europe will never have a silicon valley , unless companies here try to compete with american salaries to attract the best talents . 
  it 's emojis , you can probably install a plugin on your browser if your operating system does not support it . 
  an index of countries ca n't be wrong if scandinavia is in the top . 
  3 + million plays on spotify at least and 4th on sverigetopplistan . 
  :p i 'd say this qualifies as a `` sommarpl\u00e5ga '' . 
  nope , all lutheran / swedish church, 
  my family celebrates name days . 
  i used to get a small gift as a child on my name days ( i have two names ) . 
  and here i am in us as a swede , the map makes sense . 
  spanish . 
  it 's one of the largest languages in the world and they are pretty terrible at english in spain . 
   aaaaaaaaaaahahahahahahahahahaha compare apartment prices in cities like hamburg or munich to stockholm ... 
  so much more cheaper in germany . 
  and we have had negative interest rates in sweden for a while now . 
  if builders can keep up with the demand in high growth cities . 
  most likely easier access to capital will just lead to rising prices . 
  yep . 
  if i were living in germany i 'd buy a flat now before prices rise too much .
