  swedens military budget is like double the size of finland , so even if it has less personell it 's probably still okay in comparison . 
  four leaders that i think will be remembered : * merkel * orban * putin * berlusconi they have all been so long in office , and have been kind of `` controversial '' which will make it hard to forget them . 
  their planes are usually old . 
  scandinavian airlines are expensive and not especially good . 
  still flying with them sometimes . 
  that is a terrible economic situation . 
  hope you have the energy to apply for better jobs . 
  it requires some `` self-awareness '' to be able to know what your best skills are , but if you can figure them out then hopefully use them to get to a better place . 
  are there some sort of vocational education programs in bulgaria that you can attend , to get skills that are more attractive in the job market ? 
  for example , if you have an interest in programming or computers ? 
  why smuggle when you can buy legally : http://www.bodyguard.nu, 
  i guess the lack of a really large city like london , paris or berlin ? 
  usually big cities are seen as more exciting . 
  i 'm not too familiar with italian visas , but i guess he applied for some sort of `` business '' visa to attend the conference . 
  if he had applied for a tourism visa i guess they would not care about him travelling to other countries . 
  i 'm not defending the current rules or anything . 
  i 'm just saying that this is probably what the immigration officer thought . 
  if he had been more clear about his intentions and done two separate visa applications ( one for tourism and one for the conference ) , he would probably have been accepted . 
  that is all . 
  i 'm just saying what the immigration officer probably thought . 
  if you do not think they are racially profiling , then you are naive . 
  first he says to the immigration officer : `` yes , i intend to visit austria after the conference '' . 
  then he unwillingly assured him that he would only travel to italy . 
  even though he probably would go to austria , aka lying . 
  the immigration officer did probably not trust his intentions . 
   why is it that you allow high-risk refugees run abound , but put restrictions on low-risk phds ? 
  because there are no border controls . 
  if these refugees would apply for visas from their home countries they 'd be rejected as well . 
  why did he have to go to austria if he he going to the conference in italy ? 
  he should have applied for a tourist visa later if he wanted to do that . 
  in fact he actually admits to lying to the immigration officer about visiting other countries , so what else might he lie about ? 
  polish citizens have been arrested for planning an attack on asylum centers in sweden , but i do n't think anyone thinks that it represents what regular polish citizens think . 
  in general people do n't care about european migrants . 
  i know a lot more about slovenia . 
  ljubljana is beautiful . 
  there are a lot of cool castles there as well . 
  it 's median income , should n't matter, 
  the biggest ; tbh the reported incidents in stockholm are all in one swimming hall that i do n't go too though . 
  no but there are ` fast tracks ' for swimmers that are faster , which they sometime occupy even if they swim as slow as your next grandma . 
  all of these stories are so ` wtf ' to me . 
  i 'm going to my swimming hall as usual . 
  there are no refugees , as far as i can see . 
  the most annoying swimmers are chinese students that does not follow the instructions on where to swim ... 
  look at this chart of eur to dkk , it had a `` top '' in 2014 : http://www.xe.com/sv/currencycharts/?from=dkk&amp;to=eur&amp;view=2y, 
  i do n't know too much , but to me i do n't really see how italy is so different from any other country . 
  for example italy has some of the highest share of government spending of the total gdp ? 
  [ 51.2 % ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tec00023&amp;plugin=1 ) of your gdp is government spending , that is equal to sweden . 
   the nordic ones are the nordic ones . 
  they do n't have industry not really . 
  sweden has two of the world largest truck manufacturer ; volvo and scania . 
  a lot of heavy machinery is done in sweden , see atlas copco . 
  compare the export map of [ sweden ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:sweden_export_treemap_by_product.png ) and [ italy ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:italy_export_treemap.jpg ) and you will see that sweden export a lot of industrial goods ... actually a larger part of swedish gdp is industry compared to italy according to wikipedia . 
  this is how eurostat has measured unemployment since its beginning . 
  i love how experts on reddit who `` know everything '' , but in reality you are just guessing . 
  okay ? 
  i have never heard of that . 
  if you really wan na go deep into the sources look here : http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/unemployment_statistics_at_regional_level#data_sources_and_availability  these data on regional unemployment , compiled on the basis of the eu labour force survey , are published by eurostat , the statistical office of the european union . 
  and then to counter [ your argument ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/unemployment_statistics#data_sources_and_availability ) :  member states may publish other rates such as register-based unemployment rates , or rates based on the national lfs or corresponding surveys . 
  these rates may vary from those published by eurostat due to a different definition or methodological choices . 
  the second image would be blonde too , haha . 
  so i should not have included it !, 
  this map has , as far as i can see , data from eurostat . 
  they do a survey across all of europe , so this data does not come from `` unemployment agencies '' . 
  this means that comparisons between countries can be made , as the same method is used to measure it . 
  but that picture would be considered blonde in sweden too , do n't know why i included it haha . 
  oh well maybe the definition is pretty much the same, 
  here [ she is in a different light ] ( https://art8amby.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/daria-werbowy2-1.jpg ) ( edit : which is blonde for me too ) . 
  in other pictures it is much darker . 
  anyway , from my experience the definition of blond is not always clear . 
  i 've been called blond in usa and other countries , and brown in sweden . 
  yeah . 
  [ this hair color ] ( http://images.forbes.com/media/2011/05/05/0505_daria-werbowy2_485x340.jpg ) would not be blonde here , but in many other countries . 
  yeah , it 's kind of weird . 
  but many of the refugees coming to europe lack passports , so they ca n't enter sweden . 
  the swedish military seem to be pretty consistent in `` leaking '' such documents in order to get more funding . 
  conflict of interest ? 
  i do n't know . 
  this article is factually wrong , poor research ...  henceforth , no one would be permitted to enter sweden without proper identity documents . 
  [ ... ] since no refugees possess either european citizenship or a swedish visa , the new rules meant that no asylum-seekers arriving overland would be permitted to enter the country . 
  refugees with syrian passports can enter sweden from denmark . 
  or any other person with proper documentation . 
  the border checks does not mean that you need a visa to enter sweden . 
  how many eu migrants leave germany every year ? 
  it 's net migration that is relevant . 
  because a lot of those eu migrants will only be studying in germany or working there temporarily . 
  edit : the [ net migration in 2014 was actually 555,000 ] ( https://www.destatis.de/en/pressservices/press/pr/2015/09/pe15_321_12711.html ) , so saying it was 1.34 millions is kind of misleading imho . 
  there are about [ 28.000 chileans in sweden ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_to_sweden ) according to wikipedia . 
  i find it scary that they can strip citizenship from anyone . 
  it 's probably better for society if we put these criminals in prisons instead . 
  i get that estonia tries to market itself as a digital state , but sweden seems to have the same systems . 
  for example digital signatures in sweden are authorized through banks . 
  i do my interactions with swedish government agencies online , as well as with banks . 
  can also be done through android and iphone apps . 
  from such a group of important people , one would think that the discussion would be more interesting . 
  i did not watch it all , but it seems to be really difficult to have a good conversations when they all speak in different languages . 
  you can find the name on forums ( you just have to go to the police and ask for the `` prosecutor papers '' , it 's public information ) , and it 's a swedish name . 
  i think most are like that though . 
  criticise ` american culture ' infront of americans and they get very defendant of their way of life etc , even if they 're super liberal democrats . 
  finns , germans , french , spaniards , britts , norwegians are the same , and the list could go on and on . 
  in my experience .
