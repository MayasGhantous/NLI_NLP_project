  yeah , i just shared mine too now  i guess we 're all unique individuals . 
  a lot of what is written must be from his or her own experiences . 
  many swedes have absolutely no contact with friends from their high school or upbringing . 
  what he or she says might be true in some small town , but definitely not in stockholm where you can meet new people . 
  that 's not what the quote says . 
  it means that : `` no one but a madman would mock a foreign culture . '', 
  structural racism is everywhere , deal with it . 
  `` if anyone , no matter who , were given the opportunity of choosing from amongst all the nations in the world the set of beliefs which he thought best , he would inevitably -- after careful considerations of their relative merits -- choose that of his own country . 
  everyone without exception believes his own native customs , and the religion he was brought up in , to be the best ; and that being so , it is unlikely that anyone but a madman would mock at such things . 
  there is abundant evidence that this is the universal feeling about the ancient customs of one 's country . '', 
  herodotus almost 2500 years ago . 
  new zealand should be red , otherwise pretty accurate . 
  when in rome , do as the romans do, 
  - people can use mobile apps to meet hookups instead of clubs or bars . 
  - drugs are harder to come by ? 
  - it 's expensive . 
  it 's very sad indeed :(, 
  the difference is that the tunnel between uk and france connects two mega cities , london and paris . 
  to compare it to the channel tunnel seems like a stretch . 
  finland has a `` border fence '' between it and germany , as it requires valid visas on the ferries from germany . 
  how so ? 
  almost all of the content is in swedish there , so i 'd be surprised if that was true . 
  never heard of it , but it seems like they broadcast it here though . 
  nice work :d, 
  if we compare gdp per capita in ppp , these comparisons should be adjusted according to salaries . 
  join eu and you 'll be included in these polls . 
  nope , the last 8 years was a right wing government that changed unemployment benefits and cut a lot of taxes . 
  currently we have a social democratic government though . 
  if people are finding work , then they 're not unemployed anymore . 
  thus they 'd not be counted in this ratio . 
  how would that affect the ratio of people who get unemployment benefits ? 
  i mean it might affect the unemployment rate but that 's not what this graph shows . 
  shows the effect of having a right wing government in sweden from 2006 to 2014 . 
  same for some popular food trucks in san francisco . 
  maybe it 's just that city . 
  i definitely used more cash in usa compared to sweden anyway . 
  edit : tolls too , god damn it , i hate tolls . 
  many bars in us do n't accept credit cards though . 
  i 'd always have to go to an atm before going out in san francisco . 
  when a presidential candidate like donald trump approves of putin , i guess it 's not so weird after all . 
  no , it 's -38 % net favourability . 
  this means that 31 % approve of putin in ukraine , while 69 % disapprove . 
  this gives you a 31 - 69 = -38 % net approval rating . 
  found the map [ in the comments ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/3y8qsz/world_map_of_putins_net_approval_rating_oc/cybhnwu ) of / r/mapporn . 
  it 's a sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord , so there will be 10 or more dishes . 
  standard dishes are : gravlax , smoked salmon , herring , meatballs , sausages , ham , pork ribs , potato , casserole , cheeses , salads , bread , etc. 
  will look something [ like this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0jqey6b.jpg ) . 
  24th here , after lunch , when jultomten comes with the presents . 
  let 's not forget important songs like [ det draaar - axel wikner ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q8w4bmyoao ) . 
  yeah i mean it 's not the ugliest one by far !, 
  here 's an ugly project [ in solna in stockholm ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xvcj09b.jpg ) . 
  it 's not as impressive though and very generic . 
  edit : [ rinkeby ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/rinkeby_mot_nordost_1988.jpg ) has a soviet feeling too , but the houses are not that huge . 
  they look [ the same even in usa ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/pruitt-igoeusgs02.jpg ) . 
  here 's some [ swedish `` soviet '' blocks ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wbmtlrw.jpg ) in stockholm . 
  not the ugliest project , actually one of the more impressing ones . 
  still very much a soviet feeling . 
  spain is much more left wing at least . 
  this says more about what 's `` politically correct '' in different countries . 
  if people really wanted to host a refugee , and were going to be paid for it , then i 'm sure eu can set up a system to let people host them . 
  some south americans thought i spoke dutch , when speaking swedish . 
  also my american friend thought a swedish video was of someone speaking french . 
  / u/executivemonkey is a troll , portraying himself as an `` uneducated '' american, 
  tap water tastes really good and is of high quality here . 
  if you buy bottled water here , it 's going to be carbonated . 
  there are no more permanent asylum decisions in sweden too . 
  they changed that a few weeks ago . 
  well , estonia does not want to be nordic nor will it ever be, 
  woops , i made it too fast . 
  stockholm is more expensive than oslo ? 
  i do n't believe this . 
  [ `` keyed fiddle '' or nyckelharpa ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/nyckelharpa_built_by_fredrik_soderstrom.jpg ) in swedish . 
  [ clip here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oarowix5mgw ) of a song . 
  i would love to see germany to host olympics . 
  feel like it would be pretty epic !, 
  almost no one buys household gas in sweden , so it 's not surprising it 's very expensive . 
  electricity is cheap instead . 
  that is exactly what the article states . 
  ` peak booze ' was apparently 2004 , when at least the brits drank the most per capita . 
  * [ sarek national park ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xjdejtd.jpg ) is pretty cool . 
  this picture is from the delta rapaselet . 
  * skuleskogen national park also has some cool spots . 
  [ slottdalsskrevan ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mfkomen.jpg ) is one of them . 
  [ the view ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cab1fgd.jpg ) is great too . 
  yeah , i mean it is stereotypes ... 
  but i have rarely been impressed by how other people look compared to stockholm . 
  exceptions are norway and los angeles , where i found many good looking people !, 
  if you measure nominal gdp per capita scandinavia , netherlands etc is richer than austria . 
  swedes look better than most other people . 
  with a towel, 
  why would you voluntarily eat from mcdonalds ? 
  i feel like it 's only teenagers ( or drunk adults ) who ca n't afford anything else that eat there . 
  [ most of europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/all_saints%27_day ) seem to do this :  in austria , bosnia and herzegovina , croatia , the czech republic , finland , catholic parts of germany , hungary , italy , lithuania , macedonia , moldova , poland , romania , slovakia , slovenia , serbia and sweden , the tradition is to light candles and visit the graves of deceased relatives . 
  sweden as well, 
  tbh i do n't know . 
  here 's a [ study ] ( http://epn.sagepub.com/content/42/11/2674.abstract?id=a43120 ) , i do n't have the energy to read it though . 
  here 's [ another small article ] ( http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2054&amp;artikel=5480305 ) on the subject too . 
  swedish society is very segregated . 
  we have free school choice , and swedish parents or well integrated families usually move away their children to ` better ' schools ( meaning less immigrants ) . 
  immigrant families that are not so well informed about the school system usually take the school that they are assigned ( the one closest to them ) .
