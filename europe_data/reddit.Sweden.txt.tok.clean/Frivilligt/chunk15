  yeah , i wo n't do that . 
  i still think the picture with his helmet is relevant , as it shows that he is a `` right wing extremist '' and not a `` star wars '' character that others reported . 
  i 'm not glorifying anyone . 
  if you seriously think this will inspire other people i can remove it . 
  we know his address from where the police did the house search . 
  we also know his age . 
  from this it is pretty easy to find out his name . 
  his facebook profile picture matches the one that the newspapers have used ( they have pixelated it though ) . 
  it 's pretty much confirmed by [ swedish media now anyway ] ( https://brottsplatssverige.se/garningsmannen-bakom-attacken-man-i-20-arsaldern-fran-trollhattan/ ) . 
  the blurred picture is the picture from the facebook profile i 'm talking about . 
  i guess , he and his brother both like stuff from sweden democrats . 
  he does not like immigrants , that 's for sure . 
  according to some sources he went around the school before the attack and students took pictures with him . 
  they thought he was a `` star wars '' character . 
  yep , he 's most likely a native swede . 
  i found , what is probably the suspect 's facebook ( from swedish forums ) . 
  his cover picture has this [ `` rammstein '' sign ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yzfltsd.jpg ) . 
  he also links to [ this music video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifq9-jeoqvo&amp;feature=share ) from 17 hours ago . 
  edit : his youtube channel also likes several hitler videos . 
  if [ the lastest ] ( https://i.imgur.com/7ccyekp.jpg ) picture that has been found on swedish forum , actually show the suspect , it could be a right-wing extremist/nazi attacking foreigners . 
  the suspect also lives in the ` nicer ' parts of town ( in a villa it seems ) . 
  we do n't know , but the school that was attacked seem to have mostly foreign-born ( and probably many muslim ) students . 
  does not seem to be the obvious target for a terrorist . 
  you seem crazy !, 
  no one cares about finland here , i 've never heard anyone talk bad about finland . 
  if you ca n't control your border - that 's your problem . 
  we do not even know anything about the suspect , so there are no double standards . 
  right now , it seems most likely it 's an attack on ` foreign ' students and teachers . 
  ` you ' ? 
  you seem very angry . 
  i 'm not personally responsible for anything of what you list . 
  ugh , please show some respect . 
  this is no time to be spiteful . 
  the attack was made at the cafe at the school , i think , and it seems like it was an [ cafe that was open to the public ] ( http://m.ttela.se/nyheter/trollhattan/1.4399926--stang-gubbcafeet-pa-kronan - ) . 
  so it might not only be students that was attacked . 
  does not seem likely , as the school only has students between the ages from 6 to 15 . 
  not yet , this is really recent news . 
  edit : he had a sword , not a knife , it seems . 
  * a disguised man attacked school children and teachers at a school , and two persons are dead , and two injured . 
  * the suspect was shot by police , and is now reported dead . 
  * a [ new high quality picture of the suspect ] ( http://i.imgur.com/slryfwd.jpg ) , that was taken before the attack , has been posted by swedish newspaper dn . 
  * suspect is a native swede , 21 years old * from his facebook account he has a cover picture of the [ `` rammstein '' sign ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yzfltsd.jpg ) . 
  * he also links to [ this music video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifq9-jeoqvo&amp;feature=share ) from 17 hours ago . 
  * you can read more on his [ social media activity here ] ( http://expo.se/2015/skolmordaren-visar-hogerextrema-sympatier-pa-sociala-medier_6954.html ) . 
  they seem to have forgotten that it 's ** citizens ** that vote for the politicians , not migrants . 
  the politicians talk about this situation like they are literally saving peoples life , ignoring the fact that these migrants have passed multiple safe countries on the way . 
  they have talked for years about how sweden needs to help refugees , which has been easy , as it has been pretty much impossible to come to sweden from the middle east . 
  now that the floodgates have opened , without any real external borders of eu , thousands of migrants are coming and this policy does not work anymore . 
  to suddenly start to talk about refugees as what they truly are , economic migrations , would mean that they had lied for 10 + years . 
  to think that mainstream politicians will make any big policy changes is unlikely . 
  this will probably go on until eu stops the flow of migrants from the external borders , or when migrants realise that sweden is not the paradise they think . 
  at least he tried to protect schengen 's external border . 
  if germany got as many asylum seekers as sweden , adjusted for population , you 'd expect up to 1.6 m asylum seekers this year . 
  next year they expect up to [ 170,000 asylum seekers ] ( http://www.migrationsverket.se/om-migrationsverket/nyhetsarkiv/nyhetsarkiv-2015/2015-10-22-stor-osakerhet-i-prognosen---eus-agerande-avgorande.html ) . 
  swedish politicians are unable to do anything , so next years expectations will probably rise . 
  good bye sweden 's welfare system !, 
  [ singel och s\u00f6kande / single and seeking , starts at 1:39 .

  well 6 $ will bring you a meal in germany , so 5 $ for a meal is not that different ... 
  but salaries are probably like 3x higher in germany . 
  except for [ cities like san francisco ] ( http://sf-planning.org/chain-stores-formula-retail-use ) in usa that has ban on formula retail ? 
  this is nothing unique to europe . 
  maybe not gotland , but after ukraine the baltics look like an easy target for russia . 
  and the regressive nature of russian politics ( corruption and homophobia ) does n't really give it a better reputation . 
  there are so many flags in peoples window in germany though . 
  or on cars . 
  i see them everywhere . 
  these measurements are just an approximation but have you been there ? 
  czech republic has the lowest unemployment rate in europe , 3 % . 
  that is compared with italy 's 11 % and france 's 9.5 % . 
  i can see why they rank so high !, 
  if you look at hdi adjusted for inequality you will get a different picture : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_inequality-adjusted_hdi, 
  i guess you were lucky your hospital was in-network for your insurance . 
  i had go to a hospital once in usa , because i thought i had appendicitis . 
  one night at the hospital cost me about $ 1200 . 
  no surgeries or anything , just a cat-scan . 
  this is with insurance . 
  in sweden it would have been about $ 20 . 
  10 % of americans are without health insurance . 
  and there are so many bankruptcies because of health problems . 
  just look at a website like `` gofundme '' , so many americans pleading for help . 
  this does not exist in europe because we have a welfare state to help all citizens . 
  higher salaries but also higher student debts , longer commute , and higher medical costs . 
  all of these give usa higher gdp but not higher quality of life . 
  unless your only definition of quality of life is to drive far away into the suburbs to your oversized house , carefully chosen to be in a neighbourhood with a good school and with low crime rates . 
  that 's what you get in inequal societies . 
  to see your parents grow old when you 're on the other side of the world is not nice . 
  combine that with the fact that a generous employer in us gives you 15 vacation days . 
  it means you will use most of your vacation to go back home 2 weeks every year . 
  europeans migrating to usa will be highly educated , thus working in big cities . 
  cities like boston , san francisco , and new york where its normal to pay $ 2000 in rent for a studio apartment . 
  and where you can dream of ever buying something nice , even if you earn a  $ 150k salary . 
  the cities also have horrible infrastructure ( crappy public transportation for example ) , it 's just hard to adjust to that for me . 
  i live in san francisco , and its full of homeless people that will aggressively panhandle . 
  you never know what they might do as they 're usually drug addicts . 
  i mush prefer the european gypsy begging on the street , they are at least not high off drugs . 
  there are also smaller things , like not being able to buy your favourite french cheese in the stores , or not finding european groceries that you expect . 
  the culture shock can also be big , americans are way different than europeans in how they socialize imho . 
  much bigger culture shock moving here compared to moving within europe . 
  ** tl ; dr ** most europeans are here to earn money and move back later .
