  i 'm a european living in california and that 's how i and most of my european friends think here . 
  very few want to actually stay here . 
  those moving to us are most likely coming back when they realize that a big paycheck is not everything in life . 
  but brain drain to the rest of europe is probably inevitable, 
  it 's not even a paper , more like a blog run by a 5-person team advocating neo-nazism . 
  sorry for ruining your joke :p i guess ... 
  you mean icelanders have more computers than croatians ? 
  then what category do you win ? 
  sorry to burst your bubble , but iceland do definitely win , they are only 320 060 and have 20 less / r/europe redditors than you . 
  i 'm more worried that you have to do school parades to `` fight '' nazis ( or show that you do not support nazis or what it 's supposed to show ) . 
  did n't really know the problem was that big to be honest . 
  it 's always fun when americans hear that something is better in another country , then they jump to one of these three arguments ( judging from comments on the article and elsewhere on reddit ) : 1 . 
  our country is too big/too sparsely populated . 
  we 're too diverse aka not a `` homogeneous society '' . 
  if anything is done by the state , then it 's evil . 
  i 'm probarbly posting this in the wrong subbreddit though , or do we have any americans here ? 
  i like how he first takes some ( small ) countries in europe , and say that they have the greatest hdi in the world therefore europe is great . 
  but he says we should n't compare australia to europe , because it 's just one country with relatively small population ? 
  and because greece has a gdp per capita higher than some asian countries , we 're great but we should not compare our gdp per capita to america , because it does n't tell the whole picture . 
  it all make sense ... go europe ? 
  yes , $ = euro . 
  this prize went to the eu not the euro . 
  i 'm sure the greeks are happy with eu . 
  true , it 's hilarious though when nations , cough china , seems to think that it 's the norwegian government that hands out the prize . 
  now it 's confirmed , woho . 
  congratulations to eu , a wise but boring choice . 
  it 's rather ironic though that a committee of ** former ** norwegian politicians praise the eu , when they do n't even want to join it . 
  edit : former politicans *, 
  i was wrong , now that i 've read more about it . 
  it seems like it is only charged on the specific transactions that are designated as taxable . 
  so if an institution never carries out the taxable transaction , then it will never be subject to the transaction tax . 
  edit : fuck it i 'm not sure . 
  yes and more countries reasons like that . 
  finland was originally one of the countries in favour of it , but now that sweden wo n't implement it they 're afraid that all their financial buisness will move to sweden if it 's implemented . 
  sweden also had the experience of a tax like this in the 80s , and most of the capital fled to london until they abolished it . 
  as i 've understood it , ~ ~ it 's total value . ~ ~ from wikipedia :  the tax would be levied on all transactions on financial instruments between financial institutions when at least one party to the transaction is located in the eu . 
  it would cover 85 % of the transactions between financial institutions ( banks , investment firms , insurance companies , pension funds , hedge funds and others ) , but not affect citizens and businesses . 
  edit : it 's only on the specific transactions that are designated as taxable , i think . 
  sweden had a transaction tax in the 80s and most of the capital fled to london . 
  swedens banking industry is also quite big in the baltic which might also explain why they do n't want to implement it . 
  those are swedens largest lakes , one of them is the largest lake in eu . 
  they 're called [ v\u00e4rnen ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/v%c3%a4nern ) and [ v\u00e4ttern ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/v%c3%a4nern ) . 
  south sweden ? 
  your question makes no sense . 
  it shows eu countries view on the proposed financial transaction tax ( 0.1 % charge on all exchange of shares and bonds ) . 
  the green countries are currently adopting it , the red countries are against the proposal and the grey countires have not yet decided . 
  i changed the [ wikipedia map ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_financial_transaction_tax ) to show the current views , so it should be correct , otherwise tell me . 
  i guess they need some income to lower that deficit . 
  no , it 's just that they do n't represent news of sweden in any way . 
  they usually just post link-bait articles that are highly editorialized about irrelevant `` news '' . 
  you should check out the german version of [ the local ] ( http://www.thelocal.de/ ) , i 'm sure it 's as irrelvant as the swedish . 
  you can clearly see the [ blue banana ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blue_banana ) in this map , a fun name for an interesting fact !, 
  from wikpedia : it 's the corridor of urbanisation in western europe , with a population of around 110 million ( like a fifth of eu 's population ) . 
  it stretches approximately from north west england in the north to milan in the south . 
  the headline is highly editorialized which seems to make all redditors claim that sweden is a victim to `` terrible egalitarism '' . 
  but as i said in another comment : this story is not about mad egalitarianism but rather a civil servant going too far in trying to enforce a school diet scheme . 
  well this story is not about mad egalitarianism but rather a civil servant going too far in trying to enforce a school diet scheme . 
  because you are trying to imply that this bureaucratic problem is there because of socialism , even though sweden is a free market economy ( with generous welfare policies ) . 
  taking the local as a source for swedish news is just wrong . 
  it 's like a bachelor version for expats of our newspapers , they mostly write `` quirky '' news that swedes do not even hear about . 
  it 's better to use a british newspaper if you want to read about swedish news in english . 
  and then every 5th year a guy tries to be lucia for fun , at least for one year in my school . 
  some schools ban males for applying , haha . 
  the first impression is important , it 'll not help you if you dress like a slob . 
  nah , uht is the same as [ `` mj\u00f6lk med l\u00e5ng h\u00e5llbarhet '' ] ( http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/h-mj%c3%b6lk ) . 
  we buy it at our job ( `` l\u00e5ngh\u00e5llbarhets mj\u00f6lk '' ) , because we only use it for coffee ... so the taste does n't really matter and it 'll last longer ( longer expiration date ) . 
   so it definitely exists in sweden . 
  and the oh so atheist sweden relegated their state church to a national church first in 2000 . 
  in late 2009 the church of sweden had 71.3 % of the population as its members in 2009 although only around 20 % of the swedish population believes in any religion . 
  memberships are high because until 1996 membership was involuntary , all born before 1996 have to actively leave the church . 
  it 's always been like this on / r/europe , not a suprise huh ? 
  when bj\u00f6rn rosengren ( `` commerce minister '' ) said that [ norway is the last soviet state ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqjlz8xxxg0 ) . 
  now it 's 25 kr or $ 3 in stockholm , probably because the euro is low ... not that anyone else but tourists buy those one-time tickets anyway . 
  ah thanks . 
  well i 'm happy i 'm not a poor portuguese from portugal , the africa of europe ? 
  if you are so delusional to believe that then please do so . 
  also if they are so anti-racist why do n't they start a new group to get rid of their unpleasant history . 
  if you read my post again you 'll see that they 're not only opposing islam . 
  however being islamophobic is indeed cultural racism and the use of the word racism usually includes hatred against religions nowadays . 
  what do you expect in this subreddit and thread , go to / r/funny if you want cheap jokes . 
  really ? 
  i thought this subreddit was about making europeans work together , not insulting each other . 
  your sarcasm is far from funny . 
  but it is indeed good that we show this group that we do not accept their racism and xenophobia as well as we do not accept any crime in sweden . 
  you could say the same thing about al-qaida . 
  nah , it 's normal . 
  do you want to imply that being anti-racist is the same as supporting of terrorism or what ? 
  this counter-jihad group is also anti-homosexual and want woman to stay at home ( well anti-feminist ) . 
  i think we all can agree that we , as a majority , should show them that we do not accept their ignorance and racism . 
  people here say the protesters are not anti-racist but you forget that this `` counter-jihad '' group is not only against religon they also wants to target people of the wrong genetic background and eliminate them . 
  large parts of counter-jihad are also anti-homosexuals , demands christian prayer in school , national anthem american style and that women should stay at home . 
  looks like eu to me, 
  a citation from the study :  the study draws on statistics on income and tax levels , government benefits and forecasts by economic institutes . 
  the gfk purchasing power study does not take into account regional cost-of-living variations or recurring monthly deductions from disposable income such as rent , mortgage payments and contributions to private retirement funds and insurance policies . 
  * so areas with high population density , with higher rents , will appear to have higher purchasing power ( even though they have to pay higher rent ) . 
  * countries with generous pension systems ( like the netherlands ) will score low because of the higher taxes needed to support it . 
  * countries like norway which has high tariffs on everything will also in reality have lower purchase power as this study seems to only calculate the purchasing power after wages and taxes and not on actual prices . 
  so this map seems like it could be a bit misleading if i have understood it correctly , or i 'm just stupid , lol . 
  what oil ? 
  what nazi gold ?
