  i went inside the church and rang the bell and all . 
  it was great . 
  you get a fun boat ride too . 
  i can think of worse tourist traps . 
  what , no . 
  i love gr\u00f6na lund as a native stockholmer . 
   it 's only great because it 's small and overcrowded , gives it a old school feeling . 
  and you get a great view of the city too . 
  i think business and political environment , education & research , infrastructure , investments & credits , impact of knowledge , creative goods and service etc all sound like good measurements . 
  if you say their metrics are wrong , then what is your definition of innovative countries ? 
  i 've understood that lots of online casinos/betting companies have their headquarters in malta because of your progressive gambling laws . 
   which should boost it too . 
  that 's nice . 
  it 's `` fun '' though to see that greece is at the same league as countries like lebanon and namibia . 
  from the report :  ` efficient innovators ' are countries/economies with innovation efficiency ratios \u2265 0.74 ; ` inefficient innovators ' have ratios < 0.74 ; the trend line is a polynomial of degree four . 
   the innovation efficiency index is the ratio of the output sub-index over the input subindex . 
  it shows how much innovation output a given country is getting for its inputs , and is a sense of efficiency of sorts . 
   ** innovation input sub-index ** : five input pillars capture elements of the national economy that enable innovative activities : ( 1 ) institutions , ( 2 ) human capital and research , ( 3 ) infrastructure , ( 4 ) market sophistication , and ( 5 ) business sophistication . 
  the innovation input sub-index is the simple average of the first five pillar scores . 
   ** innovation output sub-index : ** innovation outputs are the results of innovative activities within the economy . 
  there are two output pillars : ( 6 ) knowledge and technology outputs19 and ( 7 ) creative outputs . 
  the innovation output sub-index is the simple average of the last two pillar scores . 
  although the output sub-index includes only two pillars , it has the same weight in calculating the overall gii scores as the input sub-index . 
  yes , it 's a blog post from the economist : [ charting innovation , new ideas about new ideas ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2012/07/charting-innovation ) . 
  and now you 're what ? 
  from wikipedia article , [ disappearing blonde gene ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/disappearing_blonde_gene ) :  according to the erroneous reports , the world health organization , or other experts , published a report claiming that people with blond hair `` will become extinct by 2202 '' . 
   the story about the report ** was a hoax ** -- neither the who nor any reputable expert has issued such a report . 
  those who commented on this alleged report were asked by the who to retract . 
  the extinction claim is based on a misinterpretation of recessiveness in genetics . 
  in reality , unless blond genes are positively selected against , blondeness will not disappear . 
  oh wow , that was painful but great fun . 
  i always see these maps but what are the sources ? 
  is it from nazi germany ' 39 ? 
  i do n't think you were the only ones wanting to avoid wars . 
  true , mistake by me . 
  the data and map is from [ the eurobarometer ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/maptoolclosed.do?tab=map&amp;init=1&amp;plugin=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tsdgo510&amp;toolbox=types# ) , and there you can see all the percentages !, 
  does n't really hold for the irish then does it ? 
  this map is a bit misleading actually , as the british trust eu at a 21 % level compared to the 39 % of france and 43 % of germany . 
  sweden and denmark both have our currencies , but i think for the british it 's more that they cling on their former imperialist glory . 
  it 's from the [ 2009 autumn eurobarometer ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/maptoolclosed.do?tab=map&amp;init=1&amp;plugin=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tsdgo510&amp;toolbox=types# ) . 
  i made a map now with data from the eurobarometer showing the [ level of citizens ' confidence in eu institutions ] ( http://i.imgur.com/thcly.png ) , could be fun to compare it with the submitted map . 
  i 'll repost this on / r/europe now . 
  sorry , i read the stats on the left wrong , i saw your flag at the bottom and thought you had lower percentage than greece . 
  it 's from the eurobarometer , ca n't find it online now though . 
  a theory , bacause romanian is a romance language compared to the slavic bulgarian language , they feel more european ? 
  more `` connected '' to western europe ... no it does n't hold !, 
  haha, 
  and now they lost it . 
  nah , only if the people watching were videotaping the person videotaping them on the tv , with the tv in the background . 
  / inception, 
  i wonder why greece , ~ ~ croatia ~ ~ , etc does n't feel european ? 
  i mean what else do they consider themselves ... my only guess is that they 're pretty patriotic . 
  the majority of americans on reddit seems to love the military and weapons . 
  of course there are miniorities that hate it , but that does n't rule out that most of you seem to be pretty positive about the military and what it does ? 
  if you get a work that 's in english you could live in sweden without speaking swedish , but if you want to be part of the community and get swedish friends then it 'll be easier if you try and learn the language . 
  even if people will happily help you in english , no one will really want to hold longer conversations in it . 
  and people will get tired of switching to english at parties just because you 're the only one in the company speaking english , and everyone will start speaking swedish instead , and you will feel left out . 
  i doubt children who ca n't read would watch subbed television . 
  it depends on how you are ranking cultures . 
  if you look at equality , than western cultures might be more advanced . 
  but if you perhaps look at community values , then other cultures might be more advanced there . 
  so i do n't think you can definitely say that a culture is superior to others . 
  i was joking but i do not believe any culture is superior of another . 
  but i would never want to live in saudi arabia or support their insane laws . 
  there is only a good placement in this if you believe some values are better than others , which sould suggest that you have stronger `` survival values '' . 
  your national pride would also be considered a `` traditional value '' according do this survey . 
  so all in all you 're not very swedish , so stop being proud if you do not even support swedish values . 
  / submissive-swede-with-a-hint-of-sarcasm, 
  i agree , what did the author think norway would be , a socialist utopia ? 
  many young swedes go to norway to work after high school , to get some money for travelling ( because of the high value of the norwegian krone ) . 
  you also get some tax reduction the first year . 
  so it 's a win-win if you want some cash for travel , fast . 
  i guess my irony over germans having no humour was old too , or it did n't really get through ... 
  the yellow spot is over [ v\u00e4rnern ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/v%c3%a4nern ) , europes third largest lake . 
  / random-facts, 
  humourless german . 
  * check *, 
  i think it 's from [ here at wikipedia ] ( http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/fichier:europe_sunshine_hours_map.png ) originally . 
  what 's going on in belgium , germany and czech republic ? 
  and i always thought stockholm was dark !, 
  this article might shine some light onto this persons opinion : http://www.stripes.com/military-life/travel/rose-wines-have-had-a-bad-rap-but-in-france-they-re-the-rage-1.78469, 
  it 's a forecast made by eurostat , so i 'd doubt it 's `` useless crap '' . 
  thank you . 
  europe has made sweden happy today . 
  not many people know much about sweden so i forgive you . 
  well , that 's why it 's good we do not have a recession , swedish economy has boomed the latest years , 
  sarah dawn finer , it was part of a comedian act, 
  she 's a comedian/singer , but i thinks she 's part american . 
  yes , sweden has won . 
  thank you europe !, 
  * from the future *, 
  wtfbbq , i actully like the non-swedish songs more ( excluding sweden ) ... atleast they 're not generic pop songs , but ethnic rock ballads . 
  and cyprus had a swedish song . 
  what 's up with the beanie ? 
  it 's like he does n't want to get votes . 
  there is a large chance that something swedish will win this year ... 
  the following countries have songs made by or with swedish producers : spain , norway , malta , ireland , cyprus , greece , italy , azerbaijan , great britain and of course sweden . 
  it 's great . 
  finally someone who can sing and does n't scream . 
  i think it 'd be difficult to compete with us and uk papers when the paper even wo n't be read in the home market .
