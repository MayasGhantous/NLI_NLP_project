  for example , you would never see english newspapers translated to swedish , french or russian . 
  no , i think it 's only some articles that are translated . 
  there is n't really a market for articles translated to english in europe , who would read it ? 
  only redditors ? 
  looks like italy and greece could raise their retirement age , or have they already done so in the times of economic crisis ( the date of the data seems to be 2002-2007 ) ? 
  i think it 's more that old people will have to expect a lower living standard ( by retiring early ) , because with an increasing ageing population the society can not support them all . 
  i guess so , also for spaniards and portugueses on the iberian peninsula . 
  i [ found this map ] ( http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:a-swedish-view-continental-europe.png ) from wikipedia which pretty much sums up the use of `` the continent '' in swedish . 
  in sweden ( and norway i think ) , we say we got to europe/travel to the continent when we travel outside of norway and finland . 
  so i guess it 's true in some sense ... 
  meh , i disagree . 
  i usually like the stuff that 's popular , but that does n't mean you ca n't listen to more obscure music . 
  with the attitude you have , you sound like someone who 's trying very hard to be `` cool/hipster '' . 
  i guess you could say she got tricked into cutting the cake . 
  it was a performance artist who wanted to highlight the problem of female circumcision . 
  he is black and his art is known to use `` caricature of a black face '' . 
  from [ aljazeera ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2012/04/201241804049897269.html ) :  `` either she 'd been accused of being judgemental about artistic freedom , or to express racism , '' he wrote . 
  `` if this is the case , it was a skillfully set trap . '', 
  she does n't really get any criticizing in sweden , at least not by the media . 
   karin olsson , culture editor of swedish daily expressen , wrote that the event appeared to be a `` brilliant performance , in which the initially humourostic tone raised questions about power and colonial perspectives . 
  it 's just a weird video , \u00e4ckligt means nasty so i guess they did a spin out of that , but the lyrics are really about sex .

  some swedes take this competition too serious , [ swedish eurovision imperialism . 
  ] ( http://www.escforums.com/showthread.php/7204-swedish-eurovision-imperialism ), 
  in sweden we have [ easter witches ] ( http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/p%c3%a5skk%c3%a4rring ) , who each year fly back and forth to bl\u00e5kulla during easter , to party with the devil . 
  so that 's why we have lika a mini halloween with kids dressed up as easter `` hags '' and they knock on doors to give gifts like cards and get candy back . 
  huh , wow they really did . 
  i like how they put the `` france '' - tag at spain . 
  no , nothing else . 
  i was approached by some high taxi drivers , nothing dangerous , but compared to other european capitals sarajevos train station stood out . 
  it was very empty as well so hard to find anyone who spoke english . 
  great clip , make you wan na go skiing . 
  i visited sarajevo some summers ago and everyone was lovely there . 
   try to avoid to arrive to the train station at night though ... 
  the additional state-loan is per month ( for 10 months per year ) . 
  $ 900 * 10 months * 4 years = $ 36,000, 
  stockholm is a 40 year old guy running an ad agency , a bit alcoholic , always wearing a suit . 
  he 's quite cold and can come of as stiff , but at least he 's always looking great . 
  the tuition is free , but not the books . 
  you get ~ $ 410 per month for free ( if you complete 75 % of your courses ) and then you can get an additional state-loan of ~ $ 900 . 
  the interest rate is 1.5 % during the time you study . 
  since i do n't live at home i take a full loan and i will study for 5 years which will give me a debt of ~ $ 45,000 . 
  edit : i guess you meant a four year bachelor 's degree ? 
  well , the debt in sweden would then be ** ~ $ 36,000 ** . 
  i think this article had some great points , especially about absolute poverty [ 1 ] and education . 
  in sweden `` many people '' think that it 's impossible to get a higher education in usa if you 're not rich , when actually there 's a higher percent of people in usa with a degree compared to sweden [ 2 ] . 
  but that they do n't have universal healthcare kinda makes them look like a 3rd world country anyway ...

  haha , no one here really understands them ( atleast i do n't ... ) so it does n't really matter . 
  i love mew . 
  the most popular danish song here is [ rasmus seebach - natteravn ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eojvi5j4qjc&amp;ob=av2n ) , great party song .

  from a scandinavian perspective i 'd definitely say the ut\u00f8ya massacre was the largest and most tragic news of the year . 
  i 'll start with my routine : i just made some filtered light-roasted coffee with some warm milk in a big mug . 
  if i 'm at a cafe i usually order caffe latte . 
  many swedes do have espresso machines , but i think most people usually just make `` drip-brew '' coffee that is quite strong . 
  milk is optional . 
  i was just thinking about how often other bigger cultures influence smaller ones . 
  for example how we all listen to american music at the moment , but still i do not feel any particular close to american culture in the sense that i do not often relate to characters in their movies etc. 
  i guess swedish culture has mostly been influenced by the three countries mentioned in the title , but i do not know which ones we are closer too . 
  so instead i 'm just going to ask you / r/europe ( this vague question ) of which culture you feel most close to : german , british or french ? 
  in what country/culture would you feel most at home ? 
  i 'm just asking so please do n't down vote this controversial opinion . 
  i mean the nationalists in kiev have taken control over the government , without holding any new elections . 
  the russian parts of ukraine have had no say in this change so they have abolished russian as the second official language . 
  do we even know what these nationalists in the ukrainian government want ? 
  i just feel a bit skeptic about this `` change '' in ukraine . 
  here in sweden nationalism is often considered very bad , except when it comes to animal welfare . 
  many people often only buy swedish meat , and nothing else , as all other options are considered inferior . 
  there is a belief that swedish animal welfare ( with laws protecting animals ) is the best , often without any scientific bias in it . 
  there is even a word called [ `` svegan '' ] ( http://i.imgur.com/q2f8mom.png ) which means that you only eat meat if you can get swedish meat , otherwise you eat vegetarian food . 
  is it the same in your country ? 
  furniture : svenskt tenn , and other scandinavian designers . 
  clothes : filippa k , acne , tiger of sweden cars : porsche or mercedes . 
  bmw is stereotypically the wan na be rich car for immigrants in comparison i guess ? 
  electronics : bang & olufsen glassware : orrefors , kosta boda ceramics : royal copenhagen most of these are also common in upper middle class but i guess it 's the same as upper class anyways, 
  paris -  geneva you get a big and a smaller city . 
  a little bit of both . 
  sounds nice to me . 
  norway : good skiers , sandwich for lunch , proud of only exporting oil denmark : drink beer a lot , like to complain about foreigners finland : like saunas and knives germany : rude and stiff , steal road signs with moose on in sweden baltic : they have our boat motors france : likes wine and to complain spain : lazy but have a relaxed lifestyle, 
  you could get a backup job at ikea ? 
  sweden is that the same as belgium ? 
  how do you do __ in sweden ? 
  i lived in northern germany for some time . 
  it was pretty great but really similar to sweden . 
  germany is great if you want to live in a big city , like to go to bars and want efficient transportation . 
  no big differences to sweden . 
  i moved to another country in the end , but do n't really see myself living in germany any time soon , there are more exciting places for me . 
  california !, 
  i already live here though , so maybe i 'm cheating . 
  but it 's the most liberal state , it has a great job market , and the nature is beautiful . 
  none of that country music here as well , which i personally do n't like at all . 
  it 's very casual in sweden . 
  you talk to them by their first name and usually professors are very available students asking questions and asking for help . 
  i think southern germany would be perfect for you . 
  you 'd be close to the mountains , with a lot of cool hikes . 
  they like christmas a lot in germany , with xmas markets in every city . 
  they also have oktoberfest in munich of course , or other beer fests in other cities . 
  i 'd avoid northern germany as most of the nature around those cities are just farming land .
