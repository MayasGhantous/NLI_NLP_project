  ** sweden **  if the person you are talking to is female , you are in luck : just insist that a woman 's place is in the kitchen and you are bound to get some gender equality outrage right there and then . 
  try to find out where they are from and then praise the other parts of the country very highly . 
  ask about the high suicide rates . 
  lame . 
  give me better insults, 
  this one as well ( number one on spotify in sweden ) : [ i 'm an albatraoz - aronchupa ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evyxkenjzky ), 
  in sweden we have had peace for the last 200 years , which has probably helped ... 
  both countries do also have cultures that makes both women and men available as workers . 
  education available to ( qualified ) students from all social classes without limitations such as if their parents can afford to pay for college for them . 
  also relatively corrupt free society with a high level of trust between people have made it easy to conduct business . 
  that people are suicidal here because of the darkness or whatever . 
  it 's not true , the statistics say we are equal to usa but have less suicides than for example france . 
  he 's talking about iceland not norway . 
  your argument is illogical . 
  it 'd be as expensive as someone from vilnius to travel to dallas as the other way . 
   i do n't think europeans understand how exorbitantly expensive it is for americans to travel to europe . 
  europeans are always shocked when i tell them how much flights cost . 
  what ? 
  it 'd be as expensive as it is for us to travel to usa . 
  you can fly for under $ 600 back and forth btw . 
  yes , but only 300 $ of them are benefits ( `` free '' ) , the rest you have to pay back in 25 years after you graduate ( with interest rate right now at 1,2 % ) . 
  i 'm a student and 13 $ does not really feel like much when you get 1000 $ per month in student benefits and loans tbh . 
  add norwegian to that and op has gotten the full list ... 
  yeah , i though i was going to exclude russia but i wanted to add putin . 
  lol . 
  georgia and azerbaijan are cut off as well from the original map . 
  i made this map with pictures of the ones who hold `` executive power '' in each country in europe . 
  so presidents ( head of state ) for semi-presidential countries and prime ministers ( head of government ) for parliamentary countries . 
  there are probably some errors in the map , but i tried to make it correct . 
  i 'm not surprised . 
  most swedes have an unmotivated `` hate '' for russia . 
  if swedish parents want to scare their children they will say that `` the russians will come and take you '' ( * annars kommer ryssen och tar dig * ) . 
  so it 's kind of a cultural dislike for russia . 
  the recent development with homophobic laws etc is certainly not helping . 
  not true for sweden . 
  just some facts for fun : together these countries have a population of 97 million people and an estimated gdp of $ 3.15 trillion per year compared to russia 's population of 141 million people and its estimated gdp of $ 1.4 trillion per year . 
  yep , and so many small restaurants and bars will cheat on taxes . 
  that 's why i always try to pay with credit card and take a receipt . 
  as long as people can cheat on taxes , they will . 
  that 's why you try to make it impossible . 
  i do n't think this is a `` greek '' problem but rather a `` human '' problem . 
  i have not heard anything about this is the national media . 
  the first map is wrong azerbaijan , georgia and kazakhstan etc all have parts of their countries that are within europe . 
  you do realize that c++ was designed by a dane , python ( reddit is written using it ) by a dutch , linux ( reddit servers run linux ) by a finn etc. 
  so it 's very much an international effort . 
  the national day is in honour of the election of king gustav vasa in 1523 , as this was considered the foundation of modern sweden . 
  the living costs for a billionaire is probably not really worth calculating on ; taxes on the other hand ... 
  made in estonia but founded by a swede ( niklas zennstr\u00f6m ) and a dane ( janus friis ) living in their respective countries . 
  the king of the forest : a moose . 
  i really need to move to norway ... 
  a consensus culture is very strong in sweden , so anyone who does n't agree with the current policy will not publicly tell so . 
  people might disagree but no one will know . 
  and according to polls , a majority agree with the current immigration policies actually . 
  yep swedish housing market is terrible for those who are outside , but great for those inside . 
  makes it very difficult to move to stockholm . 
  i guess the perfect balance of market regulation somewhere between bucharest and stockholm . 
  sorry i have never been to bulgaria so maybe i would love it there . 
  i 'm not so sure this is because of the richness of romania but rather that regular romanians have such low income that they can not get a mortgage . 
  i think i 'd rather be in switzerland with lots of mortage than own my own house in bulgaria . 
  this reminds me of the riots in stockholm last year . 
  they were very small ( about 50-100 people who were rioting , no looting just cars who were burning ) yet journalist from all all over the world came to report about the failure of sweden . 
  with headlines like [ `` stockholm riots leave sweden 's dreams of perfect society up in smoke '' ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/sweden/10080320/stockholm-riots-leave-swedens-dreams-of-perfect-society-up-in-smoke.html ) . 
  in a way journalists seemed to be more happy about the problems in sweden rather than actually evaluating what is happening . 
  the same can be said about ferguson and usa . 
  what about chinese owned car maker volvo ? 
  they 're produced in sweden and belgium , but i 'm sure the chinese wo n't like it . 
  been there done that :p, 
  stockholmian  swedish  scandinavian/nordic  european, 
  if they were all hipsters and ironic , it would make more sense . 
  now i just do n't understand how they can have such bad taste in fashion and politics . 
  i do n't see how this is going to help him , i doubt anyone cares that he is the son of an ex-president in france ? 
  except some rare francophiles . 
  so i do n't think this was politically motivated really . 
  did you have an insurance ? 
  maybe you can get some money if you make a police report . 
  that 's some nsfl material . 
  google and facebook have servers in northern sweden and finland actually . 
  western europe do not have any more racism than usa . 
  it 's also doing quite well economically ( excluding spain and greece ) . 
  it 's however a stupid dream if you have never been here . 
  the only reason you want to move seems to be some `` dream of something else '' . 
  you should try to take a year abroad and try it out , before you make a plan for your whole life . 
  let 's exclude northern scandinavia , because that 's clearly not europe . 
  i think people are just arguing that some of the strongest workers right is thanks to the unions here and no one wants to weaken them because of eu legislation . 
  it is not comparable to germany , your unions do n't have the same power and are much smaller . 
  yesh but in germany the socialist want minimum wage , in sweden they do n't . 
  that 's what german politicians do n't understand . 
  i have talked to a swedish lobbyist ( sent by swedish unions ) who lived in brussels with the sole task to teach other countries ( esp germany ) politcians and lobbyist about how it works in sweden . 
  so the problem is real . 
  most of the unemployment insurances are administrated by unions , though it 's funded by taxes as well . 
  so there are different conditions for different unions . 
  there is a basic insurance that all people can join too ( without any union ) . 
  i 'm a student but i 'm a member of the * engineering union * . 
  i pay 180 sek a year which is 20 $ . 
  someone who works will pay about 400 $ a year though . 
  that includes a lot of insurances and other stuff , but most importantly you get 80 % of your salary if you lose your job ( up to the limit of 8500 $ / month for 120 days ) . 
  after that you less money , do n't know how much exactly . 
  yes the nordic countries have the largest union participation rate in the world . 
  [ 67.7 % of swedish workers belonged to a union in 2011 ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/international/21575752-unions-are-trouble-some-are-learning-new-tricksfrom-bosses-unions-inc ) . 
  the thing is minimum wage would be ** worse ** in nordic countries than what unions can give .
