  wages , including minimum wages , are regulated exclusively through collective agreements here . 
  now there are several different minimum wages for different sectors , which gives much better entry salaries etc. 
  the * conflict * is that minimum wage would compete with the collective agreements , which could be bad . 
  why destroy something that already works ? 
  [ * this article * ] ( http://www.nordiclabourjournal.org/nyheter/news-2012/article.2012-05-22.8368695730 ) explains it well . 
  for the long answer check the wikipedia article on the [ nordic model ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordic_model ) . 
  in summary : unions can keep the salaries higher and give better workers right as it 's more flexible . 
  with minimum wage the need for unions are not so strong , and in the end it will weaken unions and workers right ( as governments and politics will then control the lowest salaries instead ) . 
  to implement minimum wage would be a huge blow to our unions here in the nordic countries . 
  something which continental europeans never understand ... 
  nice documentary , it seems like a nice city . 
  i 'm sort of conflicted though when people try to suger coat . 
  they say the like the big differences/contrast/chaos for example , but is that not just a nice way of saying that there are some nice areas ( and a lot of rough neighbourhoods ) ? 
  french has been the language of the upper class ( i 'm thinking of food and wine now for example ) . 
  at least that 's how its seen in sweden imo , while german is looked upon as boring and not so useful as many germans speak english well . 
  i 'd say that swedes generally do not know much about other countries politicians , not even the prime ministers . 
  those who are interested in politics might know the prime ministers of uk , france , germany and norway . 
  people do talk a lot about politics in sweden though , since it 's an election in september . 
  it 's not so much about persons , but more about ** political parties ** since we have 8 of them in the parliament . 
  so people might be a member of a political party and follow them on facebook , rather than following the party leader . 
  it 's just a holding company for tax reasons . 
  the product development is done in \u00c4lmhult , sweden . 
  volvo group makes machinery , buses and trucks so not only automotive . 
  according to wikipedia their industry is heavy equipment . 
  it 's not volvo cars , it 's volvo group . 
  that means they produce buses , lorries and other machinery you do n't realize is made by volvo . 
  learn programming 2 . 
  go to programming/informatics competitions 3 . 
  get a computer science degree 4 . 
  you can get a good job anywhere in the world 4 . 
  ikea should trademark their mazes as well then . 
  what ? 
  no swedes are illegal immigrants in norway . 
  all nordic citizens have the same rights in the nordic countries . 
  ** sweden ** * a sweden democrat politician lied about his crime history . 
  * summer weather has come back to sweden !, 
  * the government promises high speed trains and more apartments if they win the reelection . 
  * the swedish central bank ( the oldest in the world ) has lowered the repo rate to 0.25 % . 
  so not much really . 
  this week has mainly been about almedalen week which is a week when all important persons are relocating from stockholm to the island gotland . 
  all party leaders hold speeches that are broadcasted etc. 
  that 'd assume they are deported to sweden . 
  i think most of these illegal immigrants are from africa and middle east , it 's not that easy to get to northern europe from there . 
  it 's bascially stockolm vs the rest of sweden . 
  i think people from norrland ( the north ) somewhat look down on the south as well and think of them as `` less manly '' etc. 
  open the link in incognito, 
  scanian accent is weird . 
  i also think the [ gutnish accent ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/gutnish ) on gotland sounds pretty funny . 
  yeah , sure low income earners probably like oslo , but it 's still no utopia . 
  there is no utopia anywhere , and if you think that then you have been brainwashed . 
  every place has its cons and pros . 
  lol i never said norway was bad and i never compared it to sweden . 
  i guess there is some truth to our jokes about the norwegians :p, 
  when did i say it was utopia ? 
  i just said that ** i ** liked california more than scandinavia, 
  belgium and italy should be blue though . 
  both had pretty large colonial empires . 
  norway  sweden , sure but i 'd take california over both, 
  loke , he 's more evil . 
  but anyway , i 'd not think norway is paradise if i was a beggar as it will soon be forbidden to beg . 
  i 'd also not think it 's a paradise if i liked warm weather . 
  the import tariffs on food , lack of exciting food scene etc ( this is true for sweden as well ) simply makes norway quite boring for ** me ** . 
  in conclusion there is no paradise . 
   closest thing we will ever see to a utopia lol, 
  nothing reported from sweden . 
  every country thinks its own people are more important . 
  swedish media have speculated that the swedish prime minister would get an important position as well ( as another option for juncker ) . 
  yes , it 's brewdogs largest export market . 
  it 's the same with brooklyn brewery , their second largest market after new york is sweden . 
  i mean not even other states in usa drink as much brooklyn brewery as sweden which is quite weird . 
  would n't they otherwise have tried to change it ( i mean it 's a democracy ) ? 
  look at / r/iceland and you 'll see that they support it , or the other threads about this `` news article '' . 
  that 's true . 
  i 'd add brewdog bar to that list , they only spoke english when i went there last year . 
  or you can have it as in sweden , where the parent can name their child whatever they want . 
  however , if they use a name that 's offensive or that will make the kid suffer it wo n't be `` approved '' . 
  of course people will have problem with it , but a majority in iceland probably supports it . 
  democracy can be fucked up . 
  so the british-icelandic couple should just deal with it and stop complaining . 
  there is some logic behind the law after all , i have heard about more stupid things like ban on gay marriage . 
  i did read the article . 
  i know i do n't have to change my name , but i 'd still be glad to do so if i 'd integrate more easily as it 'd probably have a positive effect on my career . 
  the same way would be true if i moved to usa . 
  i 'd probably change my first name to a common american name ( or just use my middle name ) . 
  it is two different type of freedoms . 
  either you have freedom from the state , of freedom by the state . 
  by paying taxes in sweden , we know that every kid will be independent from their parents . 
  as their parents income will not affect their right to get financial aid and free education . 
  in usa you view high taxes as theft , even though not every kid will have universal healthcare and access to education . 
  the same type of logic can be applied to names . 
  by preventing stupid names , the state gives freedom to the children to avoid the risk of having weird names that will affect their future in a bad way . 
  i do n't care , i just like to debate on the internet . 
  i just do n't understand why other people care so much about an icelandic law and do n't just accept that they are different . 
  in swedish history books i think the swedish army is somewhat glorified while the russians are made to look like the enemy , which it was i suppose . 
  the names they have for the kings like `` christian the tyrant '' for the danish king is quite telling too . 
  really , is a name that important to you ? 
  well it does n't really work like that in countries like iceland and israel . 
  maybe you should tell israel to accept more muslims and christian refugees ? 
  but they wo n't , because they want to protect their culture . 
  it 's not a crusade on harriet , they have a list of pre-approved names that people use in icelandic culture .
