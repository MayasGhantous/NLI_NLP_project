  it both protects icelandic culture but also the children from getting weird names ( i mean did n't you have two children named ` adolf hitler ' and ` aryan nation ' in usa ? ) . 
  it also makes sense to have icelandic names in iceland , because of how the language is constructed ( as explained in the article ) . 
  well i 'm mostly exaggerating for fun . 
  i think the law is pretty stupid too but if i moved to iceland , i would be glad to change my name . 
  democracy is also about making laws in a society where people share some kind of connection . 
  so if the society wants to change the laws they can , this is also freedom . 
  i think it 's better to preserve their culture , if that 's what icelanders want . 
  i mean it 's up to the society to choose ... 
  the supply for low-wage labor is too high in sweden , so you will have a hard time to get a job here . 
  only if you spoke swedish you 'd have a chance . 
  otherwise you can survive with just english in sweden , and probably the rest of europe . 
  iceland is very protective of their language , and i guess therefore the names . 
  it 's better than becoming americanised , at least they can preserve their culture . 
  they 're not forced to change names , they could just add an icelandic middle name to their children . 
  but they refuse because do not want to adapt . 
  quite some immigrants change their names to make them more swedish here . 
  like adopt common last names etc , and sometimes make the spelling of their names easier . 
  i do n't see what 's so weird about changing your name if you want to adapt to a different society . 
  i wo n't try to make people say my weird nordic name in other countries , instead i 'll opt for my more international middle name . 
  they should just move back to britain if they want to name their child harriet . 
  ca n't they just accept and follow the laws ? 
  there are high taxes in general . 
  and tech salaries are not `` amazing '' compared to other jobs as the salaries are quite compressed . 
  low salaries for tech workers , high taxes and terrible climate . 
  it was trendy like 2 years ago , now it 's too common so it 's sort of declining in popularity . 
  haha , of course but it 'd also be out of style for a swede ( and our pm ) to be so confrontational . 
  but sure , i 'll just call reinfeldt . 
  let me get my phone . 
  yes , it 'd be very bad for sweden if great britain left eu . 
  sweden ca n't really threaten to leave the eu though , because no one would care . 
  i guess that is why you never hear anything about the swedish eu-skeptical voice in the media ... 
  i really hope britain will get its way . 
  most swedish politicians are kind of skeptical to eu , both they still seem to vote for more federalism in the parliament , at least cameron does something !, 
  sweden is number one , social democracy and income equality wins again . 
  you should remove one from s&p and add one to the greens , as after the final count in sweden the social democratic party only gets 5 mandates and the greens will get 4 mandates . 
  i like the [ r\u00e5dhuset station ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rahp9m9.jpg ) more . 
  it 's very cold there though ( one of the deepest stations ) . 
  sweden democrats have said they wo n't cooperate with front national and that they want to cooperate with danish people 's party ( df ) and ukip . 
  df have said that they are willing to cooperate with sd , so i guess it will be up to ukip to decide if they want to have sd . 
  sarajevo , but i lived in their old town which is quite touristy i guess . 
  otherwise chengdu in china . 
  it 's an industrial city ( 6m people ) but it has a lot to offer both inside and outside the city . 
  the sichuan province is also known for its food with lots of strong spices . 
  it 's a bit late to look for summer jobs in sweden so i 'd look elsewhere , but good luck . 
  sms has been free of charge almost so there has never been any need for an app to send `` free '' text messages . 
  there also exist a service called smsgrupp here , which is group chat by sms ( free as well ) . 
  people mostly use facebook messenger because it 's integrated with facebook i think . 
  no , facebook messenger is used here . 
  here 's a [ chart of what 's most used ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qapdhfc.jpg ) in some countries . 
  if you want to improve romanias image , you should defend all romanians instead of lowering yourself to the extreme right . 
  you must not be very well wersed in swedish politics . 
  it was a privacy issue ( read about the fra law if you want to learn more ) coupled with the case against private bay . 
  eu elections are not taken as serious as national elections though . 
  she is the first roma candidate in sweden . 
  her father is a jew as well . 
  it will be interesting to see her in ep , she 's rather inexperienced though so i do not expect anything `` spectacular '' from her . 
  i guess she will confront front national a lot . 
  here are the updated results where nearly all votes have been counted . 
  social democrats ( s&d ) 24.7 % ( +0.3 ) green party ( greens -- efa ) 15.1 % ( +4.1 ) moderates ( epp ) 13.4 % ( -5.4 ) sweden democrats ( far right ) 9.9 % ( +6.7 ) liberal party ( alde ) 9.8 % ( -3.8 ) left party ( gue-ngl ) 6.3 % ( +0.6 ) centre party ( alde ) 6.6 % ( +1.1 ) the christian democrats ( epp ) 6.0 % ( +1.3 ) feminist initiative ( probably gue-ngl ) 5.3 % ( +3.1 ) pirate party ( greens -- efa ) 2.2 % ( -4.9 ) other 0.7 % ( +0.5 ) sweden democrats , feminist initiative and the green party seems to be the big winners , while the pirate party seems to get no mandates ( it 's a 4 % threshold ) . 
  general loss of support , they are probably going to lose in the national elections in september . 
  the low turnout , projected at 51 % ( which is still a record for eu elections here ) , is probably bad for social democrats and moderates . 
  they usually get lower support in eu elections compared to national elections . 
  nothing really , but it 's the largest government party . 
  the opposition is gaining votes . 
  ~ ~ according to a large poll by the state tv broadcaster , these are the results ~ ~ ** edit : ** here are the updated results where nearly all votes have been counted . 
  social democrats ( s&d ) 24.7 % ( +0.3 ) green party ( greens -- efa ) 15.1 % ( +4.1 ) moderates ( epp ) 13.4 % ( -5.4 ) sweden democrats ( far right ) 9.9 % ( +6.7 ) liberal party ( alde ) 9.8 % ( -3.8 ) left party ( gue-ngl ) 6.3 % ( +0.6 ) centre party ( alde ) 6.6 % ( +1.1 ) the christian democrats ( epp ) 6.0 % ( +1.3 ) feminist initiative ( probably gue-ngl ) 5.3 % ( +3.1 ) pirate party ( greens -- efa ) 2.2 % ( -4.9 ) other 0.7 % ( +0.5 ) sweden democrats , feminist initiative and the green party seems to be the big winners , while the pirate party seems to get no mandates ( it 's a 4 % threshold ) . 
  the party leader jimmie \u00c5kesson says : `` the eu is not this scary [ referencing the first clip ] , but it is scary that half of our laws are made by eu and other countries politicians . 
  let us get the power back to control our every day lives . '', 
  i think you underestimate the knowledge and intelligence of sd voters . 
  they might be xenophobic but a lot of them have probable real life experience as reasons for voting on sd . 
  if we simply dismiss sd-voters as stupid , it will be hard to convince them to vote for a political party not built on anti-immigration . 
  i 've for example heard how swedish truckers and builders ( sd-voters ) have to compete with polish workers , who are willing to work for lower salaries and worse conditions . 
  this undermines the swedish model , as eu is more concerned about making companies feel well rather than people . 
  it 's a joke . 
  not very funny though . 
  the swedish equivalent of selfie used to be ego-pic in sweden . 
  i liked it more . 
  mostly norwegians , danes , finns and germans visit stockholm i think . 
  there might be some more americans , russians or other `` internationals '' who come by cruise ships in the summer though . 
  i think it 's more that swedes notice it when others think sweden has a high suicide rate . 
  the stereotype is out there , but other foreigners will of course not notice it . 
  the author is american so i guess it 's more a point of view from usa . 
  should one go short on any hungarian stocks ? 
  seems like an opportunity to use the future failure of hungary ... 
  netflix in sweden is pretty worthless , very limited selection . 
  it 's only worth it with mediahint and the us selection . 
  you 're cute , but 9 days for 5 cities ? 
  that sounds crammed . 
  i 'd try to get 4 days in each of these cities . 
  if that 's too expensive it can be smart to try to get to eastern european as that will probably be cheaper . 
  it 's also quite funny how you talk about `` meeting the locals '' , yet you went to the most touristy places in europe ( nothing wrong with that though ) . 
  here 's the [ press release ( pdf ) ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ity_public/3-19052014-bp/en/3-19052014-bp-en.pdf ) from eurostat . 
  many people actually listen to `` swedish '' music without knowing it . 
  for example all the songs on the lastest katy perry album is produced by swedes . 
  but also artists like britney spears , nicki minaj , pink , lady gaga , jennifer lopez , pitbull , etc use swedish sing and song writers and producers . 
  so the swedish music scene is probably quite alike american music scene . 
  there are not many great tv series though , for budget reasons ... 
  i wish we had a swedish hbo . 
  the bridge , a danish-swedish crime tv-series is doing quite well abroad though . 
  the tv series '' \u00c4kta m\u00e4nniskor '' ( real humans ) is about how the society would look like if we had robots who looked like humans , it is a good series .
