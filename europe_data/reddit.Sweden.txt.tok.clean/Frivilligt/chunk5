  to stop wage dumping , there needs to be laws that protect workers over borders . 
  right now a polish worker can go to sweden and work for half the pay ( because it 's still better for him than working in poland ) , instead he should get the same pay as a swedish worker . 
  so now you ca n't criticise nazism and far right parties if you have made some mistakes ? 
  it 's important to vote , and i thought the movie was very well made . 
   workfare - public works in return for extended unemployment but in a way that makes ... 
  so you want to `` fake '' jobs ? 
  because they ca n't compete with other companies . 
   wealthier or at least working people are more incentivized to have more kids than poorer or not working people fucked up ideals , are somewhat working peoples kids worth less ? 
   slant that whole thing towards two-parent households , do not encourge single-motherhood  joint family taxation more 1950 's ideals . 
   support small family farms it 's better to support innovative jobs in high tech market , that will create more wealth . 
   gear policy in a supportive way yay , more religion that 's really what we need . 
  i 'd rather have more secularism . 
  1950 's ideals again . 
  i 'd rather support innovative and ground breaking art that is interesting . 
   do n't bully those countries into full marriage 1950 's ideals . 
  gay marriage is about equality , so of course you should support it !, 
  this party would be a very conservative party in my opinion , but i guess that 's politics in hungary . 
  no thank you, 
  yes , an anglicism . 
  there is no way any nordic language ( danish , swedish , norwegian , finnish or icelandic ) would disappear . 
  the only way swedish would disappear is if we became invaded and someone tried to remove our language . 
  swedish is quite a flexible language and we do not even have many loanwords from english , instead we swedify them . 
  for example , languages ( like german ) uses the word `` computer '' but in sweden we have made our own word `` dator '' ( directly translating as data-ing ) . 
  or how dating ( go on a date ) has become dejting in swedish . 
  the police thinks that that the grenade was thrown into the wrong apartment . 
  a person already known to the police was supposed to stay in another apartment in the neighbourhood . 
  ** sweden ** * 19 year old man was shot in link\u00f6ping ( not deadly outcome , he is still in hopsital ) . 
  * norwegian skier northug admitted he was driving drunk ( not swedish news but ... ) * swedish law says that ministers should have salary deductions when they are sick and miss their assignments . 
  however , many swedish ministers have not reported their sickness . 
  * a man in his 40s was seriously injured when a hand grenade was thrown through a window in malm\u00f6 . 
  even a cat that was in the apartment was injured and taken to animal hospital for care . 
  * a swede won the world chef championship bocuse d'or * a dead man was found early saturday morning in r\u00e5lambshovsparken on kungsholmen in stockholm * sweden 's entry sanna nielsen came third in eurovision, 
  you should do it anyway , as this thread will `` drop '' soon ( ? 
  http://www.pixmania.com is a european-webshop ( from france ) that is quite good . 
  they sell a lot of tech stuff , and i have used it to buy mobile phones that they do n't sell in sweden . 
  nothing to apologise about , and without any seriousness the fun with eurovision would die too . 
  i mean if every country would send entries that were `` freak shows '' it would get boring pretty quickly . 
   i also really dislike [ ... ] reeeaally obvious that they just announce the most anticipated countries last for dramatic effect . 
  are you not taking the competition a bit to serious ? 
  i like it that they try to make a good tv show . 
  i mean i do not want to watch a slow boring show , i would rather have more `` drama '' if it was possible . 
  i think london is more likely to become the next silicon valley , if only the weather was a bit better . 
  it 's a social liberal party so not libertarian . 
  i just thought the poster was interesting , so i wanted to share it as i have seen other eu election posters here on / r/europe . 
  usa and their crazy gun culture the reason i never want to live in that country . 
  i ca n't believe how these gun enthusiasts have taken control of their laws and country . 
  europe will sympathy vote with ukraine . 
  i really want to visit bucharest . 
  austria is my place . 
  sounds fair . 
  that 's some boring commercials ( looked at the big ones ) . 
  why are there only people talking directly to the camera ? 
  the only interesting was `` die linke '' , he sounded very * german * . 
  you can talk to anyone you want in a pub , or you could meet new friends at your football club , or at work or wherever you are !, 
  it 's slightly exaggerated that scandinavians do n't talk to strangers . 
  i have stroke up conversations with strangers on trains many times . 
  great !, 
  no swedish media went ape shit over swastika pastries . 
  it was a joke from one newspaper . 
  yep . 
  but i think the gardens i describe though is what exists in pretty much all of europe except some poorer areas in eastern europe . 
  at least when i looked at google maps and compared . 
  in sweden it 's almost always lawns . 
  you could plant an apple tree on it . 
  some might also have a small garden or a greenhouse . 
  very rare to make the whole garden into a full vegetable garden . 
  ** sweden ** * swedish government wants to rapidly increase the military budget ( 5 billion crowns per year ) . 
  * a 21-year old pedophile has admitted to 16 sex crimes against children * a swedish officer , part of the osse observers , is hold as hostage in slovjansk , ukraine * there was a shooting a a club in south of stockholm , three people were hurt . 
  the police has three suspects that are held on suspicion of attempted murder . 
  anyonomous eastern european . 
  i do n't think anyone has any specific opinion . 
  some might have visited prague and has some stereotypes from that . 
  swedish air force is actually over-dimensioned for sweden at least compared [ to the rest of europe ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_of_the_european_union#european_air_forces ) . 
  still useless against russia though . 
  write about oktoberfest or lederhosen . 
  well , they ca n't just say that they are sponsring industry . 
  that 'd be socialism . 
  so instead they want to act like russia is going to attack sweden . 
  they 're just using russia as an excuse to create jobs in swedish military industry . 
  with an energy union the prices would probably spike here . 
  i feel like the whole british society is more opinionated . 
  just look at your parliament where they scream at each other , i do n't think that would happen in germany . 
  swedish  scandinavian  european, 
  i love the light at summers . 
  it 's great to forget what time it is , when it 's still light until very late . 
  kind of sucks though when you go out and when you are going home it 's broad daylight ( at like 3 am ) . 
  [ flashback ] ( https://www.flashback.org/ ) is sweden 's equivalent to reddit only there is more racism , drugs and gossip . 
  if you want to know about a famous crime that has happened , there will always be details on flashback . 
  if you need some tips about how to take some drugs , you can go to flashback . 
  well for pretty much whatever you search on google in swedish , flashback will be one of the top results . 
  try to open the link in incognito ( if using chrome ) , it usually works . 
  we have egg fights too in our family . 
  what is most often used it called [ bankid ] ( https://www.bankid.com/en/what-is-bankid/ ) , you can read on their website about the technology . 
  you can do it by : * sms * android/iphone-app * online * papers i did it on my android phone actually , the first time the tax agency had an app i think . 
  i just pressed `` okay '' after i had checked they had the correct data . 
  in sweden it 's called `` long friday '' because it 's supposed to be a long boring day of sadness . 
  so it kind of makes sense to ban alcohol . 
  woops , yes of course . 
  you ca n't buy alcohol over 2.8 % in sweden from stores on good friday , but that 's because it 's a holiday ( it also applies for sundays ) . 
  you can still go to a bar though .
