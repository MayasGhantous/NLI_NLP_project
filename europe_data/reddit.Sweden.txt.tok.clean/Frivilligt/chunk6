  * i want to have a big city like london or berlin in scandinavia . 
  i do not think it 's as extreme as you portray it , but still there 's some sort of similar themes in swedish media . 
  here 's an article from one of our largest newspapers : [ `` here is where the youth drink the most in europe - even at the school parties they sell beer '' ] ( http://www.dn.se/nyheter/varlden/har-dricker-unga-mest-i-europa-aven-pa-skolfesten-saljs-det-ol/ ) , where they compare the drinking culture of sweden and denmark and talk about how students are allowed to drink beer at high school parties in denmark when they 're 16 . 
  in sweden you have to be 18 to drink at bars and 20 to purchase alcohol in stores . 
  no , sk\u00e4msskudde is more about watching something cringeworthy , an expressen you then say . 
  it can also be used in a sentence , like : `` where is my sk\u00e4msskudde ? '', 
  when you see something embarrassing . 
  something that 's cringeworthy is called `` pinsamt '' most often . 
  i 've heard americans are surprised there are men working at nursery schools as well . 
  go equality i say !, 
  i must add the word ** sk\u00e4msskudde ** . 
  from sk\u00e4mmas ( `` to be embarrassed '' ) and kudde ( `` pillow '' ) . 
  it refers to the idea of seeing something so embarrassing that one gets the urge to hide one 's face in a pillow or couch cushion , for example when watching a television program from a couch . 
  do you have words that you can put a gender on , like actor and actress ? 
  or is everything gender neutral ? 
  `` awkward '' does not really exists . 
  i mean we have embarrassing ( pinsamt ) , but it 's often too strong to use . 
  so to describe a feeling as awkward is hard in swedish . 
  most people would mistake it for a peace sign , but i know that i learned in english class that it was rude in britain . 
  i found the romanian photo albums fun to see so thought i 'd make my own . 
  i searched after some fun pictures of people in sweden . 
  tried to make it `` representative '' ( except i chose more pictures of attractive people ) , but it 's almost impossible to cover one country in an album . 
  hope someone found it interesting at least . 
  of course i read way to much into it , but i do still not like the title , it was just criticism . 
  calling the title `` street photos in romania '' would have been better . 
  compete by lowering our salaries ? 
  with a unionised work force we can create a more equal society , which leads to a better society . 
  if you look at statistics on crime rates , prison population , health , trust between people , social mobility you can see that they are all linked to income equality . 
  by lowering salaries ( thus increasing the income differences ) the problems will only increase . 
  a healthier society is better , than having a few companies making more profits . 
  more like , satire from sweden but okay, 
  such sadness, 
  i do n't know why i did this , i really need to sleep , but [ here is a picture ] ( http://i.imgur.com/g0ocdsy.png ) !, 
  like comic sans, 
  i think the article was mostly talking about `` digital extinction '' . 
  so i do n't think it 's probable to think that the whole language will be extinct , unless someone forces people to speak english . 
  i think it 's icelandic crowns so more like 15 eur . 
  i 've never met a backpacker with a canadian flag , but i would n't feel anything special about it . 
  i do n't think anyone really see that much of a difference between an american and a canadian . 
  i 'm just a bit allergic to the whole thing . 
  probably because i grew up with a mom that counts and records everything she eats and a dad who runs marathons . 
  of course , but it can get ridiculous . 
  i feel that when you start to weigh and count everything you eat , you are at the risk of developing an unhealthy view of food and your body . 
  these statistics just show that the regular life is good in scandinavia , probably because of the social democracy policies that have made life opportunities more equal here . 
  i feel like there is an unhealthy amount of `` fitness pressure '' here in stockholm . 
  it 's almost like everyone is on a special diet where they try to maximize their protein intake and to get as much muscles or whatever . 
  some do not drink alcohol , as it 'll mess up their work out schedule . 
  almost all stores have milk with extra added protein ( this is something recent here ) and quark is also starting to become very popular because of its protein content . 
  yet both switzerland and brazil choose saab over the other competitors . 
   if `` fifth-generation '' means more than `` the ultimate driving machine , '' a sixth generation will emerge . 
  the concept behind the `` fifth generation '' of fighters is almost 30 years old . 
   [ ... ]  we can say little for certain about the nature of future conflict , except that it is likely to be led by , and revolve around , intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance ( isr ) . 
   [ ... ]  the reason that the jas 39e may earn `` sixth generation '' tag is that it has been designed with these issues in mind . 
  software comes first . 
  there was a series that asked these questions before . 
  [ here 's the thread about andorra . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1huqup/series_what_do_you_know_about_andorra/ ), 
  there are almost no gas heating in sweden , it has been phased out . 
  there have been lot of incentives to move to electrical heating . 
  in the comments section of swedish news sites there will `` always '' be someone : * relating the issue to immigration . 
  * saying sweden has a housing bubble . 
  * warning about how sweden is about to become a shit country . 
  soon there will be no welfare , or how the industry is in decay or how sweden is becoming dangerous . 
  yada , yada ... 
  so yes , there always a constant fear of losing of what you have . 
  i think that we do not use indirect messages as much as british , but at the same time we 're careful of giving criticism . 
  it 's important to keep the status quo and not create any conflicts so ... 
  [ only about 18 % of the swedish population supports membership in nato while 47 % is against it . 
  sweden has a `` cultural identity '' of being neutral and no one wants to change that . 
  let 's annex it and hold a referendum and ask if they want to join sweden . 
  have you heard of pensions ? 
  sweden wo n't join nato anyway , it would be political suicide to join here . 
  all of this is just speculation . 
  they always do it wrong , when trying surstr\u00f6mming . 
  you open it under water , outside , then it will not stink so much . 
  you do not eat the skin , or the bones , just the file . 
  do not just eat the fish as it is . 
  eat it potatoes , onions , flatbread etc. 
  [ like this . 
  ] ( http://kryddburken.se/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/surstr%c3%b6mming.jpg ) my mom loves it , but i admit the stench is horrible and i 'd always refuse to eat it when i was little . 
  i 'd get meatballs instead , lol . 
  the new city will be cool . 
  they are planning for an aerial lift to transport people to the mines and the airport . 
  [ here is an album ] ( http://imgur.com/a/6bhly ) with some pictures of it . 
  edit : by the way public transportation is free in kiruna . 
  it 's also a very left wing / social democratic city so it 'll be exciting to see what will come out of this . 
  toivo annus the former head of engineering at skype answered the question about skypes `` nationality '' in a [ quora thread ] ( https://www.quora.com/estonia/why-do-estonians-claim-estonians-made-skype-when-the-founders-were-swedish-and-danish ) . 
  i think it sums up the question quite well . 
   its only natural to have more emphasis on local achievements and while the similar claims are made elsewhere you perceive it amplified in estonia as we do not have many similar success stories to dilute the chatter about skype . 
   was it created here or there ? 
  no , we did not pay attention to that . 
  we had team of many nationals who worked well together , over changing locations . 
  even in estonia the setup was far from sitting in the same office . 
  it was multinational effort to create a new communication platform and we succeeded well with that . 
  well it 's free and open source so there was never an exit . 
  but linus did make some money of it with redhat , i think . 
  it 's ridiculous to put national labels on companies anyways since they 're usually multinational . 
  what the estonians did was to develop the platform and i 'm sure they were not just `` robots '' who did not have any say in the process . 
  it 's like people who think that steve jobs is a genius , when creating ipad or whatever , when it is really was hundreds of people who worked together . 
  it was not just `` cheap labor '' .
