  it was estonias who developed the platform and had the technology from the beginning . 
  however it was indeed a swede and a dane who owned it , and i guess it was them who got most ( if not all ) of the capital at the exit . 
  it 's kind of like soundcloud in berlin , germany . 
  it 's founded by two swedes , but it 's still not a `` swedish company '' . 
  great , more eu regulations to destroy what already works . 
  not 6 billion but there exists start ups that have had some big exits in sweden , like mysql ( 1 billion usd ) and qliktech ( around 2 billion usd , i think ) . 
  now with rovio , supercell , spotify , klarna and king.com etc the nordic start up market is quite hot . 
  it 's mostly because of populism . 
  they want to increase the status of teachers , and recently you could get a place at the `` teacher education '' with only 0.1 points ( because there were so few applicants ) , so this is supposed to help raise the standards of teachers !, 
  ** sweden ** * sweden 's mens hockey team is in the final against canada - playing in 1 hour . 
  * bronze and silver medals in curling . 
  * the government will tighten the rules for admission to university ( it will only affect those with the worst grades ) . 
  * managers who bullied an employee ( who later killed himself ) has been convicted . 
  the court says that the managers are guilty involuntary manslaughter . 
  * the princess madeleine has given birth to a daughter . 
  i think most people think of eu as a bureaucratic mess that 's taking money , with a big democracy deficit . 
  most people do not even care about the eu elections . 
  it 's more of a peace project than anything else for swedes . 
  edit : in a eurobarometer from 2011 [ they asked what people thought was good about eu ] ( http://imgur.com/a/6n5xk ) , it shows my point of most swedes seeing it as a `` peace project '' . 
  they have not completely merged scania and man yet , however today vw is making bids to buy the last remaining shares in scania . 
  now they are going to use the `` synergies '' to save money , which means less jobs . 
  i just find it sad that swedish jobs will be moved to germany because of eu rules . 
  but sweden and the nordic countries is a really small market . 
  it just shows how the monopoly rules does n't work . 
  i 'm sure that man has a 90 % market share in one of the states in germany , which is comparable to a country as sweden . 
  yeah , but vw owns a majority in man trucks and with scania it is the biggest truck manufacturer in europe . 
  the problem is that germany is dominating the eu and can alter the rules to fit german interests . 
  in 1999 volvo wanted to take over the swedish truck maker scania , but that was considered `` monopoly '' . 
  now that vw want to take over it , it 's okay . 
  german corruption ftw ... 
  then i guess all statistics is meaningless as you can never be 100 % sure that it 's reliable . 
  i do n't know any other places in russia except for moscow , sochi and st. petersburg . 
  so sochi it 'd be then . 
  it looks dirty as fuck in stockholm too when the snow is melting ( with gravel on top ) . 
  swedes eat lutfisk during christmas , at least my parents . 
  still pretty exciting that a swedish culture has lived on in minnesota . 
  makes me want to visit !, 
  if you are more interested in sweden , you should watch the swedish show `` allt f\u00f6r sverige '' . 
  it 's about americans getting back to sweden to find their swedish family . 
  it 's covers a lot of swedish culture ( even if it 's quite `` light '' and mostly entertainment ) . 
  as they speak english in it a lot you can probably watch it without subtitles . 
  yeah , that 's nice but the problem is that most swedish-americans left sweden in 1850-1920 , and has `` mentally stuck '' with that picture of sweden . 
  these horses are mostly for tourist , and they got famous when promoted during the world expo in new york to be `` typical swedish '' . 
  i am not trying to deny your swedishness , but in modern sweden you would be proud over things like equality and tolerance . 
  i saw lena endre in stockholm a few weeks ago . 
  haha . 
  the only big swedish diaspora is in america , where about 1 million swedes emigrated . 
  however , all of them have assimilated and have basically nothing in common with sweden except their last names . 
  it is nice to see some american [ celebrities ] ( http://www.apnatimepass.com/emma-stone-hd-wallpapers-30.jpg ) have [ kept ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/julia_roberts_2011_shankbone_3.jpg ) their [ good ] ( http://images.desimartini.com/media/uploads/jake.jpg ) looking swedish genes at least . 
  i found the map on [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_enlargement_of_the_european_union#post-accession_access_to_free_movement_in_other_eu_member_states ) . 
  the eu countries that now impose restrictions will lift them in 2015 . 
  the reason is ** apple ** . 
  first of all nokia has been doing very bad ( thanks to the iphone ) , and been bought by microsoft , this has probably affected related industries as well . 
  with ipads and what not , paper is not needed as much anymore . 
  this means that the big forest industry in finland is doing badly . 
  poor hungary ... to have to live in copenhagen . 
  i remember when i went to a language trip to uk for 3 weeks - torquay to be specific . 
  we were about 30 swedish kids ( 13-15 years old ) together and sure some of us were wild . 
  but compared to the italian or spanish groups , we seemed very tame and orderly . 
  this is just an anecdote but i think that having parents that do n't have to discipline their children , makes them calmer . 
  we learn from our parents after all . 
  the nordic council and passport union would probably make it so that nordic citizens still can move to norway . 
  there is no legislated minimum wage in norway , it 's decided by the unions ( as in all of the nordic countries ) . 
  i think this will be between oslo and beijing . 
  i doubt ukraine will get it , considering all of the protesting that has happened . 
  krakow does n't have any good slopes , so it 'd be both in slovakia and poland which i doubt will be appreciated . 
  i do n't know anything about kazakhstan , but it seems like they will wait some more until another ex-soviet country gets it . 
  because of the cold all houses are very well insulated . 
  i can walk in t-shirt and shorts inside . 
  * when you meet someone you do n't know you handshake or hug , do n't kiss . 
  * take off your shoes when invited to someones home . 
  * at some official buildings , if there are [ blue plastic protections ] ( http://karibien.typepad.com/.a/6a00e54ee84d1988330133f4e309ac970b-pi ) for shoes , put them on . 
  * if there 's a [ number machine ] ( http://www2.lio.se/upload/bildarkiv/arsredovisning/2002/verksamheten/nummerlapp180.jpg ) in a store , you must take a number before you get served . 
  it 'd be annoying, 
  is this a competition ? 
  no rental units , and it 's super expensive to buy . 
  yes but it will only get you like 25 square meters in the suburbs . 
  housing situation , impossible to get an apartment in stockholm without having to buy an apartment for $ 100k . 
  25 % youth unemployment . 
  schools , we are below average in oced in the latest pisa ranking . 
  you can still buy the regular nogger , not just nogger black . 
  we used to have [ this ] ( http://oddculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/04/nogger_black_02.jpg ) ice cream in sweden . 
  nice , huh ? 
  that 's true , it 's terrible to bike in the rain . 
  but i might have been a bit `` too positive '' about commuting with minus degrees . 
  the worst thing is when the lock and bicycle gear get 's frozen . 
  i have had mornings when i had to bike in the first gear to uni because it was frozen , so i have to remember to put it into the right gear the day before . 
  i have been commuting by bike ( only 3km though ) when it 's -10 c with lots of snow . 
  if you 're used to cold weather it 's not difficult . 
  oh , that 's a great idea . 
  makes me want to move to hamburg . 
  in stockholm they banned cars in almost the whole inner-city when obama visited for one day , and it was fantastic . 
  the streets really came to life when you could sit outside and eat by the `` main roads '' . 
  at least it makes you feel smarter . 
  \uff3c \uff08 \uff0d \uff0d \uff09 \uff0f it 's like those graduate speeches : i 'd like to thank the internet , google , wikipedia , and copy & paste coffee and energy drinks should be somewhere in there too ... 
  americans seem to think european countries are completely homogenous . 
  they also seem to think that we 're socialists and that every country is super liberal to drugs . 
  dizziness +3 intelligence +5 endurance +2 :p, 
  this summer i would drink like 5 cups of coffee a day , wihooo ... 
  currently on my 3rd cup for today .
