  ( trying to improve our stats ), 
  to be fair though , most of the iranians in sweden are secular and fled iran because of their islamist government . 
  it was the middle-class who left that had the tradition of education . 
  so i guess swedish-iranians are not really representative for all iranians :p, 
  swedish society might be secular in the sense that people do not believe in god , but it 's still christian ( think traditions , holidays etc ) . 
  i mean 70 % of the population are in the church of sweden . 
  bosnians ( muslim ) are surely better integrated in sweden than christians from eritrea . 
  i do n't think it 's about religion . 
  iranians are very well integrated in sweden , a higher percent of their children go to higher education than other swedish-born citizens . 
  so i do n't think it 's about religion but rather who 's better at integrating into the society . 
  yes , i stayed with some friends there . 
  ( they are expats though ... ), 
  yes , of course 60 % youth unemployment rate is real ... but it does not show the `` whole picture '' . 
  i mean many misinterpret unemployment rate and think that 60 % of the youth are unemployed . 
  but as the statistics say , about 20 % about the spanish youth is unemployed . 
  compare that to the 12 % in sweden or united kingdom . 
  of course the situation is bad in spain , but it 's not like it 's all chaos or whatever picture people paint here on reddit . 
  it means that 20 % of the youth ( 15-24 ) in spain are unemployed , which is the same as someone without job who is also looking for job : unemployment ratio = unemployed / total population the unemployment rate just counts those in the labour force . 
  so it does only count those who are in employment or are unemployed , and excludes others who are inactive . 
  unemployment rate = unemployed / labour force euro stat has a picture that [ explains it well ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/images/8/84/population_employed_unemployed_inactive%2c_2012.png ) . 
  when i was in barcelona a month ago it did n't really feel like people were struggling . 
  maybe it was just because i was in the better parts , and that catalonia is the rich part of spain , but 60 % youth unemployment is kind of bogus . 
  if one includes every youth in the statistics ( and does not exclude those who are `` inactive '' ) then the youth unemployment rate is [ about 20 % ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php?title=file:youth_unemployment_rate_ratio,_2012.png&amp;filetimestamp=20130710115744 ) . 
  this does still count students that are seeking employment as unemployed . 
  it 's from 1810 , and was adopted when they elected him , you can [ read on wikipedia about it ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_act_of_succession ) . 
  princess madeleine is fourth in line of succession so it 's not so important . 
  the baby will get swedish citizenship later so it wo n't really affect anything , but it 'll be the first time this happens . 
  but to be in line of succession one must : * have swedish citizenship and be of lutheran faith * spend a part of its upbringing in sweden and have a permanent address in sweden, 
  ** sweden : ** * winter has come to sweden , finally there is some snow here ( in stockholm at least ) . 
  * new reports about the deteriorating rail infrastructure . 
  * princess madeleine will deliver her baby in new york , usa . 
  she lives there since some years ago . 
  * outrage over a statement from a sweden democrat politician that `` rape is deeply ingrained in islamic culture '' . 
  * the social democratic party ( opposition ) wants to cut down on personal in government agencies in order to save money to use for school resources . 
  * the swedish king is going to norway to celebrate their national day . 
  this was cross country skiing though , very athletic , at least at competitive levels . 
  yes , it is rare , but it still tells you something about a person . 
  it 's usually very subtle imho , just listen to some students from djursholm or at handels and you 'll hear it . 
  some people `` fake it '' , while others try to hide it . 
  it 's not so different as i live in stockholm , it 's more about my accent . 
  we do have some slang though , that 's not used in the rest of sweden . 
  it 's mostly that we pronounce some vowels and such a bit different . 
  within stockholm there are many accents and it can give clues about peoples `` social class '' . 
  here 's an explanation from wikipedia :  in the affluent areas of northern stockholm there is a distinct dialect characterized by the pronunciation of the letter `` i '' , with the tongue against the front teeth , so called liding\u00f6 i or viby i ( after viby in n\u00e4rke ) . 
  such areas are liding\u00f6 , danderyd and t\u00e4by . 
  in north-eastern stockholm the `` sj '' sound also has a special pronunciation at the front of the mouth , similar to the one used in kiruna . 
  everywhere i go in sweden people will immediately recognise that i am a stockholmer and therefore hate me . 
  but i will hate on the peasants when they come here and try to integrate into the city life . 
  this is propaganda from companies who just want to lower the salaries of it workers and engineers . 
  i 'm sure they can get competent personal if they are willing to pay the right salaries . 
  in sweden we educate way to many engineers just to keep the salaries down . 
  the doctors ( union ) in sweden have been smart to minimize the number of swedish medicine students in order to keep their salaries high . 
  definitely more active than swedish players at least . 
  then maybe one should make a map of the number of active football players as a percentage of the population in each country instead . 
  if every norwegian game in the first league was full , as in spain , it would still show norway as a larger `` fotboll nation '' in this map . 
  a better metric would count tv views as well . 
  edit : besides you can see for you self that all the `` top countries '' on this map are small countries like iceland , faroe islands , cyprus and montenegro . 
  this is unfair , i mean a standard stadium can only hold up to about 50000 spectators . 
  it 'd be much more difficult for large country like germany , france , spain and italy to have the same percentage as norway or the netherlands for example . 
  right ? 
  why are so many countries worried about inflation , when it 's below 1 % ? 
  it 's really weird , i guess some are afraid of hyper inflation or that they have lost their jobs . 
  this is what happens when foreigners do n't understand that icelanders `` believe '' in elfes as a joke in the same way someone would `` believe '' in santa as a grown up . 
  i think . 
  or icelanders are indeed crazy . 
  btw the [ elf lobby is not real ] ( http://www.thewire.com/global/2013/12/icelands-elf-lobby-isnt-real-according-actual-icelanders/356427/ ) . 
  yeah , i agree . 
  it was quite funny/suprising because we met so many bosnian-swedes there as well who spoke swedish to us ( who were there on vacation as well ) , more than any other country we visited ( which is not so weird really since so many moved here ) . 
  the protest followed events last weekend when around 30 neo-nazis attacked another anti-racism rally in the same suburb , k\u00e4rrtorp , throwing bottles and firecrackers at protesters . 
  two people were stabbed and 26 neo-nazis were detained by police . 
  you can read more [ here in an article ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/22/us-sweden-protests-idusbre9bl08a20131222 ) from reuters . 
  k\u00e4rrtorp has had problems with neo-nazist that go and tag swastikas all over the local school , and puts up lots of posters to neo-nazist websites . 
  so this was a reaction to this . 
  i have travelled through most of southern and western europe + some countries in the balkan . 
  the biggest surprise for me is how alike we are all , and that there are no big differences between us . 
  the only country that had a different feeling though was bosnia or more specifically sarajevo . 
  you could really feel that there had been a war there recently , as you could see the houses had holes from gunshots and also how it lacked proper infrastructure as power cuts occurred regularly . 
  * i make my dinners myself , i eat lunch at restaurants usually . 
  * when i 'm lazy i eat something ready made , but usually it 's just pasta with sauce etc that i make quickly . 
  it is just so boring to cook food for myself so it 's usually something very easy . 
  * well , my parents have a small garden that they cultivate some potatoes in , but it would probably be cheaper to buy it from supermarket . 
  * sometimes i buy organic food , when i feel like it , i do n't really care ... 
  i only buy swedish beef though , because i 'm paranoid of getting mad cow disease , haha . 
  i do n't think it exists in sweden yet . 
  * i 'm a student . 
  * i 'm not sure of costs per month , but i guess it would be something like 1500 sek ( 166 $ ) and on top of that i guess i pay about 1500 sek ( 166 $ ) on eating lunches + beers at bars . 
  together with her boyfriend ( account manager for a telecommunications company ) though , they could probably earn 80k sek which would be $ 106k/year . 
  wow , that comment ... 
  he should apologise , it was not funny at all . 
  yes , and britain has banned porn . 
  the world is crazy . 
  this was a proposal from one politician in one municipality in 2012 . 
  surely no other countries have any crazy politicians . 
  we eat it in sweden ... at least kids puts ketchup on pretty much all their food . 
  i do n't know the answer , but as i 've understood it european startups performs worse compared to us ones and creates less return for the vc companies . 
  which in turn creates less vc capital for that area . 
  so the reason might be how firms can operate in the different markets , for example , europe lack : * a single market . 
  * difficult to exit via ipo 's . 
  * difficult to attract talent to european cities * higher taxes on capital gains in europe . 
  i think vc capital is not exactly a way of measuring of all entrepreneurial activity .
