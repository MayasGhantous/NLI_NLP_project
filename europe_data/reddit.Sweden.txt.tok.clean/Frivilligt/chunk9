  i think it 's more a sign of the maturity of that `` start-up market '' . 
  if you have a lot of successful exits in a market , like zennstr\u00f6m ( skype ) had in sweden , many will further invest that in local start ups . 
  so it 's kind of a circle . 
  * oil : norway * knives : finland * p\u00f6lse : denmark * sweaters : iceland, 
  fact 3 : ikea opened their first store outside of scandinavia in 1973 , h&m in 1976 and according to wikipedia tetra pak had financial troubles until they became successful in the mid 1960s . 
  schools are being sold out to private companies . 
  it 's a voucher system where they compete with public schools . 
  since market economy ca n't be forced upon schools , it has created grade inflation ( because students choose schools that give easy grades ) , and swedish school results are going down fast . 
  they have introduced tax breaks for hiring private teachers ( and nannies ) , because you need that in sweden 2013 . 
  they have `` privatised '' railways . 
  private companies vie with each other to provide state-funded health services and care for the elderly . 
  this has resulted in terrible [ health care for the elderly ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/37292/ ) . 
  they have abolished property tax and inheritance tax in sweden . 
  we have some of the lowest corporate taxes in europe at 22 % . 
  sweden is the state in europe where the gap between low and high incomes is increasing fastest . 
  soon we will not be able to afford the welfare system that we have today . 
  even today health care is unfunded , sweden has for example the [ lowest amount of hospital beds per capita ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/images/d/d3/healthcare_indicators%2c_2000%2c_2009_and_2010_%28per_100_000_inhabitants%29.png ) in europe . 
  no , it 'd be hard to miss all my friends and family . 
  but if i had to it would be norway for several reasons . 
  * richer country , more prepared for globalisation and its effects . 
  * it seems their society takes better care of the population . 
  * sweden is being sold out to private companies and soon we will be the next uk . 
  the swedish social democratic party is growing and is expected to win the power together with the greens in 2014 . 
  it 's a european nation , so i 'd guess so ? 
  norway , it is the country in europe that i know the most about except for sweden so it 's kind of obvious ...  edit : iceland is a close 2nd though . 
  they have medicare though , so they would have health insurance . 
  depends on the mood , if i 'm not feeling like it i wo n't open . 
  they do not offer swedish ? 
  it 's http://www.presseurop.eu/ we 're talking about . 
  no port in russian kaliningrad ? 
  ** sweden ** * usa and sweden have a broad cooperation when it comes to surveillance * sweden is ready for the world cup play off as we won against austria * eu wo n't regulate our snus * arson in \u00d6rebro and in v\u00e4stra g\u00f6taland * nobel prize * pediatricians warn that school children are getting sick because of dirty and untidy school toilets . 
  * some guy is being deported to libera, 
  well they could start by cutting of some of the languages . 
  is it really necessary to have czech or dutch for example ? 
   rt   neutral news yeah , sure, 
  for stockholm : more housing ( less regulation or more subsidies ), 
  i bet the salaries in estonia are pretty low though . 
  sofiero is what all alcoholics are drinking in sweden !, 
  do n't they eat it in austria as well ? 
  i met one austrian who liked it anyway . 
  if they can drive their car themselves , then i do n't think they 'll have any problem . 
  but if they ca n't , then it 's going to be a problem for them to walk outside if it 's icy and snowy , then it 'd be easier in greece for sure . 
  we have warm houses you know , no one lives in a home where it gets below 20 c inside . 
  i doubt it 's the best place . 
  there have been many horror stories of how old people have been cared for in terrible nursing homes . 
  from [ an article in late 2011 ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/37116/20111102/ ) :  staff and ex-employees have told dn that there often was n't enough toilet paper , paper towlesl , alco gel , or soap to keep the place or the patients clean . 
    earlier this spring one resident 's bed broke , which was solved by requisitioning that of another patient , making him sleep on the floor for several months . 
    a third patient was too tall for his bed , but it took six months before he was given a new one , despite pleas from staff who were forced to tie his bed together , according tot he dn report . 
  6 hours of daylight at the darkest point in stockholm . 
  but right now it 's 11 hours 40 min something . 
  also i should point out that it 's more like 10 degrees c during the day . 
  the danish flags on the building in the background makes me think this is in copenhagen . 
  yeah , but `` winter '' is already coming to sweden . 
  today i woke up and it was like 1 degree c when i walked to my uni . 
  there was frost on the ground . 
  it 's time to start wearing a hat , and that 's how it 'll be for the next 6 months . 
  in december / january it will also be dark which makes you tired and boring !, 
  we all have it terrible , do n't we ? 
  spanish weather, 
  the title is not vulgar , it 's translated to `` the girls at tv2 '' . 
  but the `` hidden '' song meaning is how they want to shag the girls at tv2 . 
  lol, 
  the main headlines in sweden is about the terrorist attack in nairobi . 
  but about the elections it says : * `` angela merkel may get majority '' * `` record numbers for merkel '' * `` merkel : it 's a super result '' so it 's basically about how its a win for merkel and how it 's most likely it 'll be a big coalition with the social democrats . 
  so they do not really say anything interesting ... 
  ** sweden : ** 1 . 
  [ gyllene tider - flickorna p\u00e5 tv2 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwxxd7e8dtw ) 2 . 
  baguette, 
  a billy bookshelf or a volvo, 
   character and personality   swede  cruel okay ...  pole  more cruel  hungarian  most cruel  russian  really hungarian lol o_o, 
  i 'd say swedes are guessers because we hate confrontation . 
  do n't almost all countries have multi-lingual populations ? 
  did you know that swedish was not an official language in sweden until 2008 ? 
  and that finnish , me\u00e4nkieli , romani , sami and yiddish are all officially recognised languages in sweden . 
  :p  i do n't know how much more you want you could begin by taking in more refugees from syria , iraq and afghanistan . 
   what do you mean by this ? 
  what are some examples ? 
  well whenever discussions about universal healthcare ( or other social programs ) in european countries comes up , people will always point out the supposed `` homogenous populations '' , as if it were a requirement . 
  and how it would not be possible to implement in america because of its diversity . 
  i do not think we doubt that america is diverse , but you seem to believe that america is the most diverse country , and therefore so many of americas problem can be blamed on it . 
  ignoring that other countries are diverse too . 
  america might be geographically diverse but that is not what people mean when they say that a certain country is `` diverse '' . 
  you still have national tv , you all learn the same language in school , etc , so your supposed extreme diversity can definitely be questioned . 
  i do not even use cash , except for small things like candy or coffee . 
  i pay all my bills online too , so i do n't think the demand for this is so high ? 
  you 're german ? 
  if they make clear what european country they are talking about in an `` ask europe '' thread , i doubt they 'll get downvoted . 
  i have noticed this too . 
  any slight criticism on america , is being anti-american . 
  / r/shitamericanssay is quite fun even if it 's hyperbole, 
  this makes europe look like a 3rd world country . 
  if you want to be ironic , i suppose that would be a good choice . 
  ryanair is an awful company , but people do n't care enough so they fly with them anyways ... 
  yeah , former swedish prime ministers do not have body guards , so that would n't be a problem . 
  i have not talked to any prime ministers , but my mom met [ ingvar carlsson ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ingvar_carlsson ) on a cafe some years ago and actually talked a bit to him . 
  also , i 've had the prime minister come to my school to talk ( where we could ask questions ) , which i do n't think is too uncommon . 
  so if you 're in stockholm it 's quite easy to `` get access '' to swedish celebs . 
  they 're much closer and not in the same way as worshiped . 
  there are n't really any paparazzi . 
  i mean people will pretty much not disturb local celebrities , they 'll be ignored .
