oh , well yeah that 's true , but there is little correlation between age and sophistication . 
  the reason good quality beer and wine are less common among the young is mostly a cost issue , i 'd wager . 
  in my opinion cider is best enjoyed in small quantities , or as a `` sweet break '' between beers . 
  it is a respectable beverage that definitely has its place , but i ca n't imagine drinking many ciders consecutively like you would beers being very enjoyable . 
  i do n't know about denmark , but around here beer is appreciated in all age groups , just like wine . 
  and just like wine , the finer beer types are more often consumed by the older generations , while the youths often enjoy generic pale lagers . 
  if anything , it 's cider that 's considered `` less grown up '' . 
  sorry , as you can see we are obviously full and can not take in any more immigrants !, 
   it 's a media agenda to portray the sweden democrats as the knee-hound of the goverment . 
  oh , please . 
  aftonbladet is the only major news outlet that is n't liberal and pro-alliance . 
  the media would hardly have an agenda that hurts the alliance they support . 
  and [ this ] ( http://blogg.dn.se/sundellssiffror/files/2014/08/votering_final1.png ) hardly looks like 51 % . 
  what they 're saying is , `` if you want to be around us , you need to look and act like us . '' . 
  hardly what i 'd call fair , it 's a very conservative outlook . 
  i firmly believe that as long as you are n't hurting anyone ( genital mutilation , forced marriage , etc. 
  ) , you should be free to practice whatever culture or belief you belong to . 
  most immigrants do adopt a certain level of `` swedishness '' , but to ask them to outright abandon their heritage is just bizarre to me . 
  diversity is what drives society forward , and we can and should all learn from each other . 
  indeed . 
  the social democrats have been losing their role as the default winning party . 
  all the parties have been more or less drifting towards the middle and i think people are disappointed with how the social democrats have `` lost their balls '' in favour of not scaring away undecided voters . 
  *** sd also stand in the way of the integration issue . 
  it is a well known fact that the governments integration program is a bit of a failure . 
  sd advocates assimilation ( yes , they 've actually used that word ) , which basically makes them free target practice for the other parties . 
  instead of discussion , we get `` fight racism ! '', 
  from all sides . 
  this method brings us to a standstill that only furthers their influence . 
  i think the integration issue would be solved much faster if the other parties forgot about sd for a while and actually talked about it . 
  you hit the nail on the head there . 
  many sd voters are either lower working class or unemployed , so they 've suffered hard during the last eight years of right wing rule . 
  to show their dissatisfaction , they are voting for the `` not pc '' party , the one the rest hates . 
  problem is , sd almost always voted * with * the ruling right wing government in all the other issues . 
  they are still highly outnumbered in the immigrant issue , so they will have no power there . 
  in effect , the voters voted for the very same views that caused them their misery in the first place . 
  if you live in a small town you will need to go to a city to visit one of those specialised shops . 
  the very idea of systembolaget is equal access and high quality for all citizens , how is that a bad thing ? 
  if your only concern is getting drunk , sure , then you may not need much service . 
  but if you 're looking for something specific , like a wine that goes well with a certain food , or a beer that is n't your usual pils , then you may find their advice helpful . 
  the varied assortment is what makes me really positive to it , though . 
  on trips abroad i have visited large stores that did n't have a single ipa or apa , but a good 10-20 brands of pale lagers . 
  if you take away the profitability factor you can have a store in every town that has every type of beer . 
  and if there 's a beer your local systembolaget does n't have , you can order it through their website and pick it up at the store a few days later . 
  it 's perfectly legal to brew your own alcoholic beverages . 
  if you 're very concerned with not having enough alcohol , you can buy ahead , or start brewing beer or cider . 
  systembolagets monopoly on alcohol means that they are n't concerned with which product is profitable . 
  this means that * every * store has a large and varied assortment , and that service and variety of choice become a priority . 
  to me , this advantage greatly outweighs any concerns with closing hours . 
  you still have folk\u00f6l , `` folk beer '' available in stores . 
  a 50cl folk beer i 'd reckon has about the same alcoholic content as a 33cl normal beer . 
  you may have to take an extra leak every once in a while , but you 're far from `` screwed '' .

  as much as i disagree with israel 's actions in the gaza conflict ( actually i disagree with pretty much everyone 's actions in the conflict ) , i hate how reddit automatically attacks your nationality when you , presumably a normal citizen , propose humane actions to deal with an entirely different issue . 
  you should n't be held accountable for what your country does , and you should definitely not be shamed for having an opinion . 
  i completely agree with you on this issue and sincerely hope that the rest of reddit can see past your flag for once . 
  we have a few tricks up our sleeves ... * med plutonium tvingar vi dansken p\u00e5 kn\u00e4 !, 
  nope , it 's neither old nor a [ mustang ] ( http://www.guitariste.com/share/users/forums/2014/01/72521-458567-6fcde04b93-5d5a.jpg )  it 's a 2011 mij 1966 reissue jazzmaster , a modern guitar built to vintage specs .

  i 've since moved into the city , but here 's a [ picture of my guitar ] ( http://i.imgur.com/q8mjwat.jpg ) that i took last summer in what at the time was my garden . 
  s\u00f6dermanland , sweden . 
  because that is its primary function . 
  a state that is n't taking its responsibilities seriously should be replaced one way or another . 
  a companys primary function is to make a profit . 
  if raising the price or cutting down on the product quality means more profit they will do it and in certain instances they are even required to . 
  no , you 've got it backwards . 
  you need to understand it before you * approve * it . 
  it 's like signing a contract without reading it , then sitting around waiting for stuff to change . 
  `` oh , * that 's * what that contract was about ! '', 
  for all we know ttip might be great , but if it is then why do n't they share it with us ? 
  it 's not made public because in all likelihood it would n't have the support of the public . 
  we 're risking the quality standards of two continents here , it 's exactly the right time to be cautious . 
  i am under the impression that a lot of people think that while the concept of gmo in itself is n't bad , it is a very indistinct label that can and does include unethically produced products , so they are wary and cautious . 
  but i also find it a rarely talked about issue , a lot of people are indifferent towards gmo and care more about other , more pressing issues . 
  \u2022 welfare is good . 
  \u2022 recycling is good . 
  \u2022 prison = rehabilitation , not punishment . 
  \u2022 believe what you want but do n't push your views on others .

  i did n't say they were to be used for weapons production . 
  the plutonium produced in sweden was never used in any weapons production , it was sold to britain , who ultimately never used it . 
  still , they all opted for uranium in favour of thorium because of the nuclear weapons aspect , either for themselves or through trading .
