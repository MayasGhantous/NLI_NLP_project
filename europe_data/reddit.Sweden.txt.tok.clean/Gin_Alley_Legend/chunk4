  nothing like that ever happened . 
  summer breaks , dumbest crap ever . 
  i 'd give a four week holiday and that is it . 
  we could cut down schooling by almost a year this way . 
  even at university they pull this crap , and it 's not even a vacation because you still have to pay rent and eat so you have to work anyway . 
  honestly , after 200 + years i think it is fair to speak of an american culture and an american nation . 
  if the us stopped existing tomorrow by divine decree i 'm sure the survivors would still think of themselves as americans and may well form enclaves in the countries they migrate to . 
  yikes , from barely getting by to protecting all of europe . 
  those politicians were n't lying when they promised increased defense spending . 
  you can realize that something is your duty without wishing to do it . 
  believing that you have a duty to serve in your country 's military if called upon to do so is different from wanting to sign up . 
  besides , it 's not like peacetime conscription is a foreign concept for young swedes , it only went away six years ago . 
  it 's a back tax , they were supossed to pay this all along . 
  the comission is n't taxing apple retroactively according to new rules . 
  what has been ruled is that apple 's special agreement with ireland was illegal under eu rules ( that ireland has agreed to ) and therefore the deal was never valid in the first place . 
  for all intents and purposes , apple has not been paying its taxes and now have to pay them . 
  or rather ireland has been ordered to collect them . 
  in the case of minors you could then use child protective services . 
  if a girl stops coming to school then in the worst case scenario you can take custody away . 
  in the case of adults it 's trickier , you just have to hope that there are relatives or friends who are less extreme and who can alert police . 
  you 're hardly the superpower reddit thinks you are . 
  you 're not the uk , if russia had any sort of interest in invading sweden it would be more than capable of going through you if it had to . 
  what protects us is that the swedish mainland itself is of no interest to russia , only some baltic islands we own are . 
  we are also an eu member and in general a country that would generate more headlines than ukraine does . 
  during the cold war it was a large military that kept us safe . 
  that does n't mean we should n't rebuild our military and join advantageous alliances , because all this could change . 
  but the idea that sweden is kept safe by a bunch of grizzly finnish men on the border to russia is a fantasy . 
  sweden being a member of the eu is in our constitution . 
  i always thought that was really smart . 
  something as big as leaving the eu should n't be left up to a simple majority referendum , if you ca n't get a majority of parliament to agree ( twice with an election inbetween ) then you should n't leave . 
  have you lived your entire life in stockholm ? 
  the majority of swedes in norrland are not `` dark '' and they are definately not mongolians . 
  it 's like asking me to explain why the french are not asian since they look chinese . 
  the vast majority of the people in the north are swedes the same way i am . 
  your family having some sami woman , a finlander and a german or two spread out over a thousand years does not make you not a swede . 
  i doubt even a straight up nazi would claim that . 
  * tips fedora * m'dane . 
  the reason most northern swedes consider themselves ethnic swedes is because they are . 
  only a small minority are sami or finnish . 
  i would n't translate andersson as `` son of andrew '' . 
  i 'd translate it as , well , anders 's son . 
  the us response was similar to europe , at 44 % saying they were willing to fight . 
  i think there might be a correlation between ( claiming ) willingness to fight and perception about the kind of war you would be fighting in . 
  finland is high as fuck , sweden is lower but still relatively high . 
  if you ask people here if they are willing to fight for their country you may as well add '' ... against a russian invasion . '', 
  that might not be true for western europe . 
  for greece maybe replace russia with turkey ? 
  ukraine is obvious . 
  looking at the website i 'm surprised the us is only at 44 % . 
  i would have thought russia would be higher as well . 
  and yet you do n't see many germans seeking compensation for the thirty years war . 
  if i still held a grudge against russia specifically for the great northern war i would be seen as crazy and really , there is a much higher chance that my family was directly affected by that than a bunch of guys whose families immigrated from africa 40 years ago being affected by american race relations throughout history . 
  we had the same party in government for 41 years , 23 of those was with the same prime minister . 
  they did n't take power . 
  in general i think a term limit would be a small obstacle for a president popular enough to take power , they 'd either have it extended in time or have a puppet extend it and then get re-elected . 
  he had great success with courting left wing voters with his `` new moderates '' . 
  i imagine he tried to do the same thing with this but vastly overestimated how much we actually like immigration . 
  smallest harvest in 28 years . 
  eu has 28 member states ( for a while longer ) . 
  this is hardly a coincidence . 
  there was a question : `` have you ever masturbated ? '', 
  one of the answers was : `` no , but i 'd like to try '' and about 1 % in my country answered this . 
  how does that even happen ? 
  what is stopping these people ? 
  i would n't say people here are less enthusiastic about the `` swedish model '' as much as people take it for granted . 
  there are few people alive who remember not having any real rights for workers , not having paid vacation every year , not being able to get higher education if you are poor , not being able to get proper healthcare if you are poor etc. 
  people , including the left , think the welfare state is just about handing out money from rich people to poor people . 
  not to mention that the current social democrats are absolute retards . 
  had they not decided to focus on massive immigration at all costs ( well , not all as we just witnessed ) and identity politics and kept to working on the welfare state and exhuding a competent beuarucrat image i 'm sure they would be polling much higher . 
  we have always been at war with eastasia . 
  we should replace nato with a common european military in some form anyway . 
  it does n't have to be able the match the us in power projection if we 're not willing to spend that kind of cash , it just has to be much stronger than russia 's and be able to stabilize countries in our near region should it have to . 
  i do n't think this would be as hard to market as people think , as long as you market it as `` yurop stronk '' and not some wishy washy cosmopolitan project . 
  people like to feel strong . 
  sounds like a well adjusted dude . 
  i have an irrational hatred against this little tidbit that pops up from time to time . 
  `` sounds legit '' and fancy designs are not science . 
  unless somebody shows me how this was actually measured mostly objectively then i wo n't believe a word of it . 
  and i 'm not talking a survey where old people say it seems like time passes faster . 
  it 's almost like europe does not adhere to us party politics . 
  i hate to make fun of someone 's thinning hair but , what exactly is this barber paid so much to work with ? 
  this is our own thing . 
  if anything ** we ** did this to the eu , nobody forced us to have such a generous asylum policy . 
  is anything ** not ** considered a provocation by russia ? 
  booho , we 've all had an empire and we 've all had to face that they are gone . 
  trying to act like an empire when you are not will only serve to hurt yourself . 
  wait . 
  the eu should have involved itself ** more ** in greece 's financial crisis and ** more ** in germany 's affairs ? 
  so the problem with the eu is in fact that it is not integrated enough ? 
  yeah , what the hell ? 
  how can you justify to yourself not turning up for the most important vote your country will have in decades ? 
  youth is an excuse for why you did n't study for an exam that one time ( okay two times , okay three ) or why you have that horrid tatoo . 
  it is not an excuse for giving a big middle finger to the democratic process . 
  they ca n't all ** be ** stupid but they can ** act ** stupid . 
  the vast majority of swedes voted for parties that were outright giddy to continue certain policies that anybody should have known were extremely detrimental to our country . 
  they did n't stop until it was clear to even a baby that continuing was impossible . 
  it is fully possible that 52 % of the brits have acted in a stupid manner today . 
  a majority does not make you right . 
  it is likely that this will weaken all of us , the uk most of all . 
  immigrant groups have no power , not to decide anything and not to stay seperate should we decide to integrate them actively .
