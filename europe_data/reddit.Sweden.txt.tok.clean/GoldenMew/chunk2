  surely that must mean their elections were n't legitimate either . 
  south korea claims all of north korea as part of its nation . 
  can they not have democratic elections either ? 
  and what about elections in taiwan which claims all of mainland china ? 
  i can go on for a while . 
  there are many countries usually considered democratic which do not control all the territory they claim as theirs . 
  how far does this logic of yours extend ? 
  here we go again . 
  they tried to conduct the vote in the occupied parts of donbass but the occupying russian forces stopped it from happening . 
  that pro-russian propagandists then use the fact that the vote was stopped in those regions as an argument against its legitimacy is so incredibly cynical , it 's frankly disgusting . 
  and getting deeper every day !, 
  you forgot copenhagen . 
  sweden 's refusal to join the eurozone is tacitly accepted by the eu . 
  while we are theoretically obligated to join - it 's not gon na happen since we 're deliberately refusing to fulfill the requirements for joining by not participating in erm2 . 
  he seems quite concerned with maintaining his reputation as the heroic underdog taking on the usa , and getting convicted of rape would hurt his credibility . 
  and if upon his release in sweden he would be free to leave the country without any extradition to the us , that would only discredit him further . 
  that right there is in fact not the difference in sweden , because rape has a different legal definition here . 
  there 's plenty of indigenous people in south america . 
  having separatist opinions is a [ crime in russia ] ( http://www.rferl.org/content/putin-extremism-internet-law-bill-rights-separatism-ukraine/25466010.html ) which could get you imprisoned for years , and [ extrajudicial harassment ] ( https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/03/crimea-annexation-critics-attacked-and-silenced/ ) against those who still dare to disagree is common . 
  only an utter fool would expect polls to be fair under these conditions . 
  here 's [ one with estonia and a bit of northern scandinavia ] ( http://i.imgur.com/txkl5cj.jpg ), 
   the left did not walk out , they were not invited as a precondition to any discussion . 
  ] ( https://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=96&amp;artikel=6286379 )  the far-right have blocked all reformations of the immigration policies in sweden since 2010 . 
  uh , no . 
  do n't you remember this agreement in 2011 ? 
  no , i 'm not surprised that the people remaining in the territory might feel this way when people who openly state they do not feel this way are being detained , tortured and executed prompting everyone else who does not agree with this state of affairs to flee the area if they are able to , while the occupying forces of the area are bringing in a massive amount of foreign extremist fighters to settle the area . 
  for similar reasons , you should n't be surprised if pro-caliphate views have become more common in raqqa recently . 
  that would be natural when people with pro-ukraine views have been forced to flee from the area to escape repression and violent nationalists from russia have settled in the area . 
  there was no popular support for becoming part of russia in these regions prior to the takeover . 
  while donbass had been part of imperial russia before 1917 , it is n't really the `` original '' country of the region ( since the area had been part of other countries previously ) , and if we should right historic wrongs by allowing european countries to reclaim territory by force that they had possessed previously , there 's a lot of territory that could be retaken by various countries with a varying degree of justifiability . 
  perhaps what europe really needs right now is another german attempt to grab alsace !, 
  that 'll surely work out well for the future stability of the continent . 
  yes , very interesting stats , if you are interested in something completely irrelevant to the question at hand . 
  a `` western controlled ukraine '' only exists in the fever dreams of conspiracy theorists . 
  of course , they instead asked a question that pertains to reality . 
  well , people were asked that some years ago and becoming part of russia had less than 30 % support in 2013 . http://dif.org.ua/en/events/ukrainieyu-ne-hochut.htm, 
  well , people were asked that some years ago and becoming part of russia had less than 30 % support in 2013 . http://dif.org.ua/en/events/ukrainieyu-ne-hochut.htm, 
  it is really the case here . 
  the idmc [ estimates 1.4 million idps ] ( http://www.internal-displacement.org/europe-the-caucasus-and-central-asia/ukraine/figures-analysis ) in addition to the people who have fled to other countries . 
  a lot of that is spurred by the fighting itself , but there are also very widespread reports of people who are suspected of harboring pro-ukraine views being detained , tortured and harassed in the occupied territory which has caused many to flee . 
  for example , you can read this hrw article from last year about the kind of tactics used : https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/08/28/ukraine-rebel-forces-detain-torture-civilians, 
  that 's what happens when you cleanse the area of anyone who thinks otherwise . 
  you know , i 've seen this claimed frequently , but i 've never seen any photos of this . 
  new construction is not required for population to rise in an area . 
  a recent trend in sweden has been a large amount of immigrants cramming themselves into small overcrowded apartments . 
  ( or merely changing their folkbokf\u00f6ringsadress there so they 're registered at an address within the city . ), 
  found a column by oisin cantwell about this : http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/kolumnister/oisincantwell/article20380577.ab really , every side of the political spectrum seems to condemn the fact that the police did more or less nothing to protect the man from the threats he faced . 
  you pretty much seem to be the only person who thinks what they did to him is okay . 
   i 'm not exactly a fan of what they did but it was n't a crime however you look at it . 
  1 . brott mot knivlagen 2 . olaga hot 3 . probably something else too but of course , he made a joke about how the adhan sounds , so he 's hateful and should be blamed for that and therefore deserves what he 's getting . 
  i wonder if you 'd feel the same way if a group of sd : ers gathered with knives outside a refugee facility and made threatening statements about punishing the inhabitants for some perceived slight ? 
  yes , the mob forming outside someone 's house with knives and saying they 'll enter his house if the police does n't do something about him are just using their rights of free speech . 
  really , are you fucking kidding me ? 
  your post is utterly disgusting . 
  romania is not that earthquake-safe itself : https://horizon-magazine.eu//sites/default/files/share-map.png, 
  they do n't even have gay marriage yet . 
  [ it can be hard to remember how it 's spelled ... ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/wwi_poster_rumania.jpg ), 
  the uk has fptp voting , which means that there 's quite naturally going to be less votes for fringe parties since it 's seen as a wasted vote . 
  i understand that dates can be hard to comprehend for some people . 
  hopefully this nice drawing can help you understand it in a more visual way : https://i.imgur.com/yyj7opm.png, 
  it 's funny , because the baltic area was the second most developed part of the russian empire . 
  your country is on the verge of electing a neo-nazi who gains support by fearmongering about syrian immigrants when you 've received only a tiny , tiny fraction of the immigrants that northern europe has received . 
  if your country had received as many middle eastern immigrants as northern europe , you would n't just have had pogroms , you would have started genociding them . 
  how many percent does donald trump have in the polls again ? 
  you do n't need to translate all of it , but i would like to know if there is anything interesting in this long rambling email ? 
   firstly , government opinion is n't what the map we are commenting on is discussing , that would be the peoples opinion no , the color encodes the government 's stance , green being that the government had no official position . 
  read the key on the map or the translation in the comments . 
  sweden 50 % ? 
  what ? 
  where on earth does that number come from ? 
  in the [ sifo survey ] ( http://www.tns-sifo.se/articlefile?fileid=2443b55b-f707-4503-aa39-1b52e6ba32e0 ) about the war from march 2003 , 14 % were in favour , 68 % opposed , and the rest had no opinion . 
  i ca n't find any other relevant swedish survey from that time period so i would consider this figure highly questionable . 
  and `` no dedicated position '' ? 
  no , that 's definitely not right . 
  on the eve of the war , the swedish government was very clear in [ condemning the war ] ( http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article10350804.ab ) and calling it a violation of international law and saying the un should have been allowed to resolve the conflict . 
  while they 're officially politically unbound , board members in sverok associations tend to be incredibly left wing from my personal experience . 
   not to mention jersey has some of the tightest gun laws in the nation . 
  tough gun laws in a single state are not that effective if you can just drive to a another state and easily buy a gun there . 
  you 'll need something more comprehensive if you want effective gun control . 
   and you 'd look dumb doing so . 
  america has cultural diversity , a large immigrant population and linguistic diversity too . 
  moreso than you by far . 
  it 's a larger country , yes . 
  i 'd comment more about this , but it 's fairly irrelevant since this is not what you or any other american really means by `` homogeneity '' . 
   no shit it means low amount of black people , amongst some others . 
  yeah , it 's pretty much only a cutesy dog whistle for `` low amount of black people '' , though sometimes it 's also one for `` low amount of hispanic people '' depending on how the murican in question feels about them . 
  again , i 'm not sure how this is related to mass shootings , which is what i was referring to in the text you rebutted with your line about `` homogeneity '' . 
  as far as i know , mass shooters are not disproportionally black . 
   what sweden does n't have is a history of extreme institutionalized racism entrenched in nearly every avenue of society that persists to this very day . 
  no racism in sweden , no sir . 
  https://www.opendemocracy.net/can-europe-make-it/mattias-gardell/swedens-dirty-little-secret  even then , those people should n't be walking the streets , they should be getting help they need in proper medical health facilities . 
  and how exactly are you going to know who should be kept off the streets ? 
  not everyone who 's sick is going to seek mental help , and of those who do , there 's no surefire way of knowing who 's going to be dangerous . 
  should everyone with a history of mental problems be locked up ? 
  that 's going to be a lot of people . 
   newsflash , people are n't shooting other people in reno just to watch them die , they 're doing it because they 're poor and need money , or they got caught up in gang violence or they 're high as fuck but coming down and need another fix or whatever . 
  or for a million other reasons !, 
  https://i.imgur.com/lnqeqgf.jpg  good enough for charles whitman to shoot 49 and kill 16 at a distance in texas . 
  where 's your mass shootings ? 
  does n't gun ownership lead to mass shootings ?
