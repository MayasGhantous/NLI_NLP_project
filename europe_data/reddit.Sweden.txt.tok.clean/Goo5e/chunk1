as stated several times , the russian national anthem can not be beaten . 
  [ the soviet anthem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x72w_69ys1a ) was even better . 
  say what you want about the soviet union as a `` country '' , but they knew how to make anthems . 
  every country has its own awesome things , but i must say slovenia . 
  pretty much . 
  this is gon na be awkward . . 
  i must applaud romania for ( seemingly ) cracking down on all of these corrupt higher-ups , well done !, 
  ah , never seen them in newspapers . 
  sweden bought estonia , but eesti still ca n't into nordic :d, 
  they should have a poll in the prisons about the most popular porn and then restrict the porn to the least popular type : ^ ), 
  yeah , those are annoying as shit . 
  one of the reasons i only watch the noncommercial channels . 
  it has to do with that whole `` let 's not encourage people to drink '' - thing , which is also why the state has a monopoly on alcoholic beverages ( above 3,5 % i think ) , and said stores are not open that much . 
  they 're illegal , as far as i know . 
  shieeet, 
  and water is wet . 
  i know from personal experience that slovenia ^ and ^ croatia is nice as fuck but tbh , czech republic seems kinda cool also . 
  this is surely not based upon my bias for czech beer . 
  yeah , because malm\u00f6 is totally representative for all of sweden . . malm\u00f6 is n't like the rest of sweden , nothing like this shit ever happens in the worst areas in my city . 
  ahaaa , thanks for clarifying . 
  the religious people are protestant by a large majority ) . 
  do n't try it :d, 
  calling swedes `` protestant '' is also stretching it . 
  ah , thanks for clarifying . 
  interesting how there 's such a difference between the czech republic and slovakia . 
   while university-level students ca n't read and comprehend the course literature . 
  stopped reading there , you fucking what ? 
   i 'm spoiled for choice , i 'd be surprised if anything in the thread is cringier than this . 
  what the fuck happened there ? 
  the same ( should ) apply there as well ? 
  * are you really sure about that ? 
  yes , just let everyone be openly racist ( especially mods ) and everyone will have a jolly good time :d / s, 
  good , but eesti still ca n't into nordic . 
  edit : no maymays in / r/europe , got it . 
  i support greece in this matter . . 
  but i like to make it look like i do n't . 
  i have way too much fun messing with my greek friend talking about how fyrom is the `` real '' macedonia . 
  ( in the caucasus ) ( gone wrong ) ( gone sexual ), 
  the voting arrows for comments are invisible in night mode ( res ) :|, 
  seems to be it , thanks . 
  ah , interesting , thanks !, 
  can i just ask , what is the `` tapping on the hand '' supposed to mean ? 
  ( the gesture the men to the right of the mep leaving are doing in the clip ) . 
   please do n't confuse the actions of our government with how people feel now you know what it 's like to be swedish , 
   swedish : sounds similar to a norwegian , if they had a stick up their ass , used the opposite tone that they were supposed to , and were mildly irritated , as if they suspected someone nearby had just farted . 
  they sound like haughty rednecks . 
  kind of annoying , kind of funny . 
  not so bad that i care . 
  passa dig j\u00e4vligt noga , fjordfjolla  :(  least favourites :  danish never mind , we 're good . 
   a golden dawn spokesman is obviously not representative , but does the greek public feel the same way about this ? 
  yes , my half-greek friend absolutely flips shit if you call fyrom `` macedonia '' . 
  not too sure if that applies to any other country than germany , i doubt most swedes could name any other german politicians in the last 50 years than um . . merkel and some east and west german leaders . 
   europe wo n't forget  merkel i agree . 
  who ? 
  hit the nail on the huvud right there mate :\\ ^ ), 
   distinct lack of dank memes to appease and placate the population ( pls donate rare pepes our children need them ) go visit / r/sweden , enough fuktighet to sink all of greece . 
  yeah , lufthansa is great . 
  absolutely haram . 
   marimekko yes , really . 
  i collect iittala 's marimekko bowls : ^ ) ^ ^ ^ ^ please ^ ^ ^ ^ make ^ ^ ^ ^ more ^ ^ ^ ^ colors ^ ^ ^ ^ finland, 
  these days , you never know . . 
   decent people  racist and hateful . 
  pick one . 
  christ man . 
  can we help in any way ? 
  holy fuck dude , can you even afford food , let alone pay rent at that rate ? 
  wow , that was wonderful :'d, 
  touche . 
   no visa to russia or belarus or brazil or cuba , visa on arrival in iran russia and belarus i can understand , but brazil or cuba ? 
  and what about iran ? 
  got any backstory to this ? 
  except for the obvious answer rammstein , i listen to a shitload of finnish metal such as ensiferum , korpiklaani , as well as finntroll and turisas ( well , does n't really count ) . 
  amen . 
  fucking wow :'d i feel like i might be little romanian , fucking savage man . 
  i 'd say his brain has been dead for quite a while already . 
  jesus christ , these are very well made and fucking hilarious . 
  yeah i agree completely . 
  i am sort of against immigration , only because the absolutely horrid integration we have had for quite some time now . 
  holy shit marry me . 
  edit : inb4 `` huh ? 
  sweden is gay ? 
   honestly i think we should be able to joke about everything : black guys , white guys , abortion , hitler , jews , muslim , atheists , skinny girls , fat girls , lama 's . 
  because for every possible joke , there is someone who we might offend . 
  and if offending people is off limits , we lose not just jokes but all forms of critical speech and honest debate . 
  totally agree , shame most people do n't ( `` hurr durr why are you kicking people why they 're down '' ) . 
  hey man . . that 's not cool :|, 
   and the bank cant tell if its real reason for a transaction or a joke , its always safer to go for the former assumption . 
  . . yeah nah , i 'm pretty sure the authorities would conduct a quick investigation/rule me out before that 'd happen . 
   but go right ahead , write such silly reasons for your bank transactions , not my fault or the banks fault when someone comes knocking on your door to find out what the transaction was really for . 
  thanks , you 'll be the first one to know when that happens . 
  tagged you as `` bank transfer man '' ( yes i assumed your gender ) . 
   supposing you still publicly ( online or in real life ) say you 're about to bomb or do a terrorist act the security forces will still act . 
  it 's a more extreme version of shouting `` fire '' in a packed theater . 
  lolwut , a bank transfer is n't really public is it ? 
  do your phones speakers activate and say `` warning - this individual sent a bank transfer containing the word * bomb * 5 seconds ago '' ? 
  unless they do , that comparison makes no sense . 
  innocent until proven guilty ? 
  if i am say , a university student transferring $ 7 to my mate at 02:34 a saturday night , would you think i actually have the intet of committing any acts beyond stuffing my face with boozefood ( ? ), 
   have you ever landed in the usa ? 
  because saying stupid stuff like that gives you a nice meeting with the fbi for at least a couple of days with the possibility of being barred to ever lay foot in american ground again .
