  we 're serious . 
  well done , guy !, 
  if i had the power , i would deem you honorary european for all your works and knowledge concerning us . 
  best one in this thread so far , eh ? 
  damn finnish and their swedish hate !, 
  i will tolerate this no longer . 
  prepare for my ombudsman to contact you shortly !, 
  mexico ?

  ^ saying ^ that ^ there 's ^ a ^ scanian ^ separatist ^ movement ^ is ^ like ^ saying ^ that ^ there 's ^ an ^ uppland ( where ^ stockholm ^ is ) ^ separatist ^ movement .

  um , belgium was never in the kalmar union . 
  what in helvete are you talking about ? 
  if i 'd just go with a neutral rationale and choose the one that makes the most sense , i 'd say that that would be stockholm . 
  most populated city in scandinavia and fennoscandia , situated in the biggest country of the ones ( sweden closing in on 10mil pop ( as you probably know ) whilst norway and denmark are both around 5mil ) . 
  lots of historical and prestigious locations and events . 
  however , historically the countries of the kalmar union kept their own separate capital , and each country handled most of the internal affairs themselves separately . 
  the union just united the scandinavian countries into one force , together , united . 
  most of the lower level governing was more or less independent . 
  as an unofficial representative for sweden , i agree with this idea !, 
  now we just need the norwegians . 
  our cultures are too different and wo n't fit . 
  as a sweden i ca n't imagine the idea of submitting to being united together with other european countries , especially since we are quite professional and and collected when it comes to governing among other things . 
  a second kalmar union might be possible for the scandinavians though since we have very good relations and cultural similarities , but i still doubt it . 
  mostly because there is n't a reason , and i ca n't imagine what kind of movement would be capable of coercing the nations or forcing such an event . 
   i do n't care about special effects , so i ca n't empathise with your last point . 
  it was a minor point , which was more one of curiosity rather than a real complaint . 
  i tried watching it , but as a person who is quite analytical it was just too much bullshit . 
  like the logic and events that did n't make any sense whatsoever pissed me off . 
  for a while i could just take it as a comedy and enjoy it at least some , but then they have these `` emotional '' moments where they try to make some sort of retarded philosophical point , that does n't even make sense . 
  i mean , paradoxes = flying dinosaurs eating people and by that way somehow fixing the paradox or whatever . 
  what the fuck kind of logic goes into that . 
  paradoxical rules seem only to apply at certain times , and are changed randomly as soon as the writer seem to think it proper . 
  quality of stories are greatly inconsistent , probably due to the great number of writers writing the script . 
  also , for such a huge series , could n't they have spent a little more on cgi/special effects ? 
  i mean some scenes looks utterly amateur . 
  what popular shows you got ? 
  no offense , just have n't heard of any at all . 
  there is no sami separatist group , and even if they were , they 're just a very tiny percentage of the total pop in those areas . 
  they actually trace the connection , showing the timing between each and every point in the route to reach the server in question . 
  great for seeing the chokepoints in the connection , and where any delays in place might happen . 
  it 's just more detailed and interesting data . 
  you should however compare your home connection instead of your workplace , since the two can possibly vary greatly in performance . 
  for the record , my ratings were from my home , passing through a router ( though top of the line , so it probably does n't add any real meaningful delay ) . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/traceroute here 's the wikipedia explanation of traceroute anyways . 
  edit : also when you got the time , i 'd love to actually see the traceroute plainly from your home pc without any additions nor removals to the connecting signal ( ie : keep the router if you can ) . 
  the possible delay from your router would be seen on the tracert as well , so there 's no problem distinguishing the data there . 
  just to show you what i 'm getting ( directly from pc and through my router , using the domain of my favorite swedish online shop webhallen . ), 
  tracing route to www.webhallen.com [ 82.96.62.68 ] over a maximum of 30 hops : 1 < 1 ms < 1 ms < 1 ms www.asusnetwork.net [ 192.168.1.1 ] 2 1 ms < 1 ms < 1 ms gw-n1-u-d2 . ias.bredband.telia.com [ 195.198.146 . 
   here 's a sample tracert ( with router ) though : edit : oh sorry misread , so that was with router . 
  your isp is voxility or is that a third party ? 
  it seems their relays are a bit of a delay . 
  no biggie at all for any reasonable use , just interesting when comparing high end connections between country/isp as we 're kinda doing atm . 
  where did you get the around .80 rating ? 
  hello ? 
  were you met with unfortunate results or why have n't you been able to post the traceroute logs yet ? 
  i 'd really love to see them . 
  it 's supposed to be as low as possible , not as high if you missed that . 
  the page linked even mentions it as well . 
  do you have any more direct criticism or are all your arguments as abstract as these ? 
  thanks , i would still however prefer traceroute logs . 
  just write tracert instead of ping and you should get it . 
  thanks . 
   i pinged 15 cs servers at random and they were all 1ms . 
  most routers ca n't even handle 1ms . 
  just to clarify , this was using a dedicated latency tool or the `` ping '' cmd command , right ? 
  or are you talking about steam server browser ? 
  server browsers are very inprecise and often use placeholder measurements . 
  assuming that you actually used the cmd command , care to post a tracert log/screenshot ? 
  it 's really quite the extraordinary phenomenon , hence why i 'd like to see it . 
  care to elaborate , or are you just full of shit ? 
  gini have seemed very accurate to me , and the measuring system is quite precise . 
   well , that 's not exactly an internet hub in romania . 
  that 's a provincial border town with a very small population . 
  for what it is , i think they have decent internet . . 
  exactly , what you think . 
  as a swede i disagree . 
   to what servers exactly ? 
  as i said , obviously depending on location . 
  but game servers , most often located in germany , where he 'd usually get 80 ping if the internet was stable at the time , it 's quite unpredictable . 
  now are you trying to prove a point , or are you just asking questions for no apparent reasons ? 
  england is n't exactly known for the best internet connections in the world , i 'm talking specifically about sweden , not the rest of non-romanian europe . 
  my swedish isp have had virtually no downtime at all , and i consistently get the same speed , if not quite the bit more . 
  he lives in carei ( near satu mare/hungarian border ) . 
  also just for the record , on swedish game servers and in speedtest test i get 3 , sometimes 2 , in ping . 
  that 's insanely good by my opinion . 
  my romanian friend usually gets around 45-60 ping with speedtest , regularly more , and 60-80 ping in most servers , though obviously depending on location . 
  i got 55 ping just last time i tried out my swedish 3g connection on speed test . 
  also , his speed fluctuates greatly between different servers he 's connecting to , for some reason . 
  even though they have the capability of going at his speed , and i 'm getting the higher speed even when i downloaded at the same time . 
  romanian internet , as people already mentioned , is still a whole lot cheaper , swedish internet is still quite cheap though , in comparison to the rest of the world . 
  it 's just that ro is insanely cheap with their internet . 
  about what ? 
  did you even look at the other countries ? 
  here in sweden we have a highly developed network , in terms of stability and latency i 'd even suggest that we have some of the best internet in the world .
