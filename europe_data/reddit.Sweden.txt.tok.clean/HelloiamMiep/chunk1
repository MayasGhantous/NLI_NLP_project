* in southern hungary , the local news media reported that up to 300 migrants escaped from a camp at roszke on friday morning , running into a field and crossing a highway with the police chasing them . 
  * * and in bicske , migrants continued to barricade themselves in a train to avoid being sent to a nearby camp . 
  others fled the train and escaped . 
  those who were still on the train overnight slept on the floor , on baggage racks or wherever they could find refuge . 
  many refused to eat as a show of protest . 
  * * migrants said the situation on the train was becoming unbearable , with the stench of clogged toilets wafting through the cars . 
  others talked of pursing a policy of passive resistance , hoping that hungary would cave into their demands , even as the authorities were digging in . 
  * * laszlo balazs , a police official in charge of border control , was quoted by the hungarian state news agency as saying that 120 migrants on a separate train , which had also stopped , had agreed to be escorted to a camp in vamosszabadi , near the border with slovakia , where they would be registered by immigration officials . 
  * * he said that in bicske , too , the police were hoping to persuade migrants to cooperate .

  why are they acting like spoiled children ? 
  the smugglers are selling them a utopia ... and the news outlets are having a field day trying to skew the debate by playing up the emotional side of the situation ( which does n't help anyone ) . 
  people need unbiased information . 
  the eu governments ( or humanitarian groups ) need to counter act that , either with signs ( in areas that immigrates frequently travel ) and/or by an official ( highly publicized ) website giving simplistic details on the eu 's refugee policy . 
  at this point they are risking their lives based on propaganda , the only way to deter it is to make the true information available . 
  do you think hungary is just trying to get the `` refugees '' wore out so that they can send them back to the camps once they hit the border ?

  * a record 104,460 asylum seekers arrived in germany last month , a bavarian official said on wednesday , part of an unprecedented wave of refugees and migrants straining the resources of german towns and villages . 
  * * germany expects about 800,000 people to file for asylum in germany this year , four times last year 's level . 
  * * german interior minister thomas de maiziere told german television channel zdf on wednesday that germany could deal with that number this year but a lot of money was needed to deal with the refugee crisis and `` for three , four , five , six years , 800,000 is too many , even for a country like germany '' .

  thousands of refugees are arriving in hungary , and from there many travel on to germany via austria . 
  * * towns have been overwhelmed with the new arrivals and want more money to house and care for them . 
  german chancellor angela merkel has called for a fair distribution of asylum seekers within the eu and has also warned against racism after almost daily attacks on shelters . 
  * * in an interview with the newspaper die zeit , de maiziere said integrating the new refugees could be more difficult than it was for previous groups of migrants , because as many as 20 percent might be illiterate and may struggle to find work . 
  * * `` now we will receive hundreds of thousands of arab muslims and that is , according to everything my french colleague says , a significant difference in terms of integration , '' die zeit quoted de maiziere as saying . 
  * * germany is home to some 4 million muslims , mostly with turkish backgrounds . 
  germany has long struggled to integrate its turkish population , some of whom live in parallel communities where turkish is the main language .

  * hundreds of passengers were stranded for hours on five eurostar high-speed trains after reports that migrants were blocking the tracks leading to the tunnel under the english channel and were attempting to climb aboard . 
  * * according to the eurostar twitter feed , three of the trains then went on to london early on wednesday , while two others returned to their original departure stations in london and paris . 
  * * eurostar had announced on twitter late on tuesday that it was holding its trains `` whilst authorities deal with trespassers '' and then said the trespassers had been spotted on the tracks at the station in calais . 
  the trains stayed in place as the trespassers were removed from the tunnel and away from the tracks , it said . 
  * * local media reported that the trespassers were migrants attempting to cross into the united kingdom through the eurotunnel , also known as the chunnel . 
  so far this year , thousands of refugees have attempted to make the dangerous crossing . 
  * * passengers on one of the london-bound trains , which stopped less than a mile ( 1.6 km ) from the tunnel , were told at one point to be very quiet and listen for the sound of people climbing on the roof . 
  a helicopter with a searchlight then circled the train as guards walked the tracks looking for migrants , but seemingly none were spotted . 
  * * with the power out , passengers on that train sat in the dark for nearly four hours . 
  the heat and mugginess in the cars rose as conductors walked the aisles with wind-up torches . 
  a woman in business class wept and many passengers said they could not breathe in the stifling air . 
  * * eurostar then pulled the train back to calais , where passengers disembarked for fresh air and bottled water . 
  but when some attempted to leave the station to cross the english channel by ferry , french gendarmes stopped them , saying that customs and immigration laws required that the passengers return to paris . 
  * * however , eurostar tweeted that the train , es9055 , `` is unable to be used to take passengers in calais back to paris and alternative options are being sought . '' * * `` we 've been abandoned on a platform somewhere in the cold with no information , '' tweeted one of the passengers , danny bell .

  `` the fact that it is armored indicates it has a special cargo . '' * * according to zuchowski , the mysterious treasure hunters were tipped off by the deathbed confession of a german soldier who helped to hide the train towards the end of world war ii as the russian army marched west across poland . 
  images taken by ground-penetrating radar appeared to show a train equipped with gun turrets somewhere on a four kilometer-long track of rail near walbrzych , the bbc reports . 
  while it is unclear what the train contains , zuchowski speculated that it could hold military equipment , stolen jewelry , artwork and archival documents .
