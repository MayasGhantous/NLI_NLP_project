  * the german foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , said on thursday that `` we must reform the dublin convention immediately , and find a way of creating binding and objective refugee quotas that take into account the ability of all member states to bear them . '' costanza hermanin , a senior analyst in migration and equality for the open society foundations , said that tragedies like the discovery of dead migrants in a truck in austria sometimes produce change , but that `` there has been a big political reluctance to deal with the problem . '' the dublin agreement was negotiated along with schengen , ms. hermanin said , to balance freedom of movement for citizens with protections against migrants .

  ** from the article : ** * as officials struggled wednesday to explain why a jet with 150 people on board crashed amid a relatively clear sky , an investigator said evidence from a cockpit voice recorder indicated one pilot left the cockpit before the plane 's descent and was unable to get back in . 
  * * a senior military official involved in the investigation described `` very smooth , very cool '' conversation between the pilots during the early part of the flight from barcelona , spain , to d\u00fcsseldorf , germany . 
  then the audio indicated that one of the pilots left the cockpit and could not re-enter . 
  * * `` the guy outside is knocking lightly on the door , and there is no answer , '' the investigator said . 
  `` and then he hits the door stronger , and no answer . 
  there is never an answer . '' * * he said , `` you can hear he is trying to smash the door down . '' * * while the audio seemed to give some insight into the circumstances leading to the germanwings crash on tuesday morning , it also left many questions unanswered . 
  * * `` we do n't know yet the reason why one of the guys went out , '' said the official , who requested anonymity because the investigation was continuing . 
  `` but what is sure is that at the very end of the flight , the other pilot is alone and does not open the door . '' * * the data from the voice recorder seems only to deepen the mystery surrounding the crash and provides no indication of the condition or activity of the pilot who remained in the cockpit . 
  the descent from 38,000 feet over about 10 minutes was alarming but still gradual enough to indicate that the twin-engine airbus a320 had not been damaged catastrophically . 
  at no point during the descent was there any communication from the cockpit to air traffic controllers or any other signal of an emergency . 
  * * when the plane plowed into craggy mountains northeast of nice , it was traveling with enough speed that it was all but pulverized , killing the 144 passengers and crew of six and leaving few clues . 
  * * the french aviation authorities have made public very little , officially , about the nature of the information that has been recovered from the audio recording , and it was not clear whether it was complete . 
  france 's bureau of investigations and analyses confirmed only that human voices and other cockpit sounds had been detected and would be subjected to detailed analysis . 
  * * asked about the new evidence revealed in the cockpit recordings , martine del bono , a bureau spokeswoman , declined to comment . 
  `` our teams continue to work on analyzing the cvr , '' she said , referring to the cockpit voice recorder . 
  `` as soon as we have accurate information we intend to hold a press conference . '' * * meanwhile , prosecutors in marseille , who have been tasked with a separate criminal inquiry into the crash , could not immediately be reached for comment . 
  brice robin , the marseille prosecutor , was due to meet thursday morning with the families of the crash victims . 
  * * at the crash site , a senior official working on the investigation said , workers found the casing of the plane 's other so-called black box , the flight data recorder , but the memory card containing data on the plane 's altitude , speed , location and condition was not inside , apparently having been thrown loose or destroyed by the impact . 
  * * the flight 's trajectory ahead of the crash also left many unanswered questions . 
  * * r\u00e9mi jouty , the director of the bureau of investigations and analyses , said at a news conference that the plane took off around 10 a.m. local time from barcelona and that the last message sent from the pilot to air traffic controllers had been at 10:30 a.m. , which indicated that the plane was proceeding on course . 
  * * but minutes later , the plane inexplicably began to descend , mr. jouty said . 
  at 10:40 and 47 seconds , the plane reported its last radar position , at an altitude of 6,175 feet . 
  `` the radar could follow the plane until the point of impact , '' he said . 
  * * mr. jouty said the plane slammed into a mountainside and disintegrated , scattering debris over a wide area , and making it difficult to analyze what had happened . 
  * * it often takes months or even years to determine the causes of plane crashes , but a little more than a year after the disappearance of a malaysian airlines jetliner that has never been found , the loss of the germanwings flight is shaping up to be particularly perplexing to investigators . 
  * * one of the main questions is why the pilots did not communicate with air traffic controllers as the plane began its unusual descent , suggesting that the pilots or the plane 's automated systems may have been trying to maintain control of the aircraft as it lost altitude . 
  * * among the theories that have been put forward by air safety analysts not involved in the investigation is the possibility that a pilot could have been incapacitated by a sudden event such as a fire or a drop in cabin pressure . 
  * * a senior french official involved in the investigation , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , said that the lack of communication from the pilots during the plane 's descent was disturbing , and that the possibility that their silence was deliberate could not be ruled out . 
  * * `` i do n't like it , '' said the french official , who cautioned that his initial analysis was based on the very limited information currently available . 
  `` to me , it seems very weird : this very long descent at normal speed without any communications , though the weather was absolutely clear . '' * * `` so far , we do n't have any evidence that points clearly to a technical explanation , '' the official said . 
  `` so we have to consider the possibility of deliberate human responsibility . '' * * mr. jouty said it was far too early in the investigation to speculate about possible causes . 
  * * `` at this moment , i have no beginning of a scenario , '' mr. jouty said . 
  however , he said there was not yet any evidence available that would support a theory of a depressurization or of a midair explosion . 
  * * speaking on the french radio station rtl , interior minister bernard cazeneuve said wednesday morning that terrorism was not a likely `` hypothesis at the moment , '' but that no theories had been excluded . 
  he said the size of the area over which debris was scattered suggested that the aircraft had not exploded in the air but rather had disintegrated on impact . 
  * * lufthansa , the parent company of germanwings , has characterized the crash as an accident . 
  the airline has not disclosed the identities of the pilots , except to say that the captain was a 10-year veteran with more than 6,000 hours of flying time in a320s . 
  * * the french bureau of investigations and analyses , which is leading the technical inquiry into the crash , sent seven investigators to the crash site tuesday . 
  they have been joined by their counterparts from germany , as well as by technical advisers from airbus and cfm international , the manufacturer of the plane 's engines . 
  * * speaking on europe 1 radio , jean-paul troadec , a former director of the french air accident investigation bureau , said one of the big challenges for investigators would be to protect the debris at the crash site from inadvertent damage . 
  * * `` we need to ensure that all the evidence is well preserved , '' mr. troadec said , referring to the pieces of the plane littered across the steep slopes as well as to the remains of the victims . 
  the identification of the victims will probably require matching dna from the remains with samples from relatives . 
  * * the recovery effort will be a laborious task , given the state of the wreckage , the difficult terrain and the fact that the crash site is so remote that it could be reached only by helicopter . 
  * * cabin depressurization , one of the possibilities speculated about on wednesday , has occurred before , perhaps most notably in the crash of a cypriot passenger plane in 2005 that killed all 121 people on board as it approached athens . 
  in that case , helios airways flight 522 , a slow loss of pressure rendered both pilots and all the passengers on the boeing 737 jet unconscious for more than three-quarters of an hour before the aircraft ran out of fuel and slammed into a wooded gorge near athens , the greek capital . 
  * * investigators eventually determined that the primary cause of that crash was a series of human errors , including deficient maintenance checks on the ground and a failure by the pilots to heed emergency warning signals . 
  ** update : ** - according to the ny times , one of the [ germanwings pilot was locked out of cockpit before crash in france ] ( http://nytimes.com/2015/03/26/world/europe/germanwings-airbus-crash.html?referrer= ) . 
  - [ more info ] ( http://abc.net.au/news/2015-03-26/germanwings-pilot-outside-cockpit-before-crash-report/6349546 ) -  * cockpit recordings recovered from the crash site indicated one of the seats was pushed back and the door opened and closed , followed by the sound of knocking , the source said , adding `` there was no more conversation from that point until the crash '' . 
  *  * the source said an alarm indicating the proximity of the ground could be heard before the impact . 
  *  * the recording included the pilots speaking normally and in german at the start of flight 4u9525 . 
  *  * the source could not say if it was the captain or the first officer who had left the cockpit . 
  * --------- possible pilot suicide ( ? ), 
  hypoxia , perhaps . 
  ** [ example - helios airways flight 522 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/helios_airways_flight_522 ) : ** on august 14 , 2005 , helios airways flight 522 crashed into a mountain while on a flight from larnaca , cyprus . 
  all 121 passengers and crew were killed in the crash , making it the deadliest in greek history . 
  the boeing 737-300 aircraft departed cyprus with an improper pre-flight pressurization configuration , which lead to pilot incapacitation due to hypoxia . 
  the aircraft eventually ran out of fuel and crashed . 
  in its final report on the crash , the hellenic republic 's air accident investigation and aviation safety board stated : `` on 14 august 2005 , a boeing 737-300 aircraft , registration number 5b-dby , operated by helios airways , departed larnaca , cyprus at 06:07 h for prague , czech republic , via athens , hellas . 
  the aircraft was cleared to climb to fl340 and to proceed direct to rds vor . 
  as the aircraft climbed through 16 000 ft , the captain contacted the company operations centre and reported a take-off configuration warning and an equipment cooling system problem . 
  several communications between the captain and the operations centre took place in the next eight minutes concerning the above problems and ended as the aircraft climbed through 28 900 ft. 
  thereafter , there was no response to radio calls to the aircraft . 
  during the climb , at an aircraft altitude of 18 200 ft , the passenger oxygen masks deployed in the cabin . 
  the aircraft leveled off at fl340 and continued on its programmed route . 
  at 07:21 h , the aircraft flew over the kea vor , then over the athens international airport , and subsequently entered the kea vor holding pattern at 07:38 h . at 08:24 h , during the sixth holding pattern , the boeing 737 was intercepted by two f-16 aircraft of the hellenic air force . 
  one of the f-16 pilots observed the aircraft at close range and reported at 08:32 h that the captain 's seat was vacant , the first officer 's seat was occupied by someone who was slumped over the controls , the passenger oxygen masks were seen dangling and three motionless passengers were seen seated wearing oxygen masks in the cabin . 
  no external damage or fire was noted and the aircraft was not responding to radio calls . 
  at 08:49 h , he reported a person not wearing an oxygen mask entering the cockpit and occupying the captain 's seat . 
  the f-16 pilot tried to attract his attention without success . 
  at 08:50 h , the left engine flamed out due to fuel depletion and the aircraft started descending . 
  at 08:54 h , two mayday messages were recorded on the cvr . 
  at 09:00 h , the right engine also flamed out at an altitude of approximately 7 100 ft. 
  the aircraft continued descending rapidly and impacted hilly terrain at 09:03 h in the vicinity of grammatiko village , hellas , approximately 33 km northwest of the athens international airport . 
  the 115 passengers and 6 crew members on board were fatally injured . 
  the aircraft was destroyed . 
  the air accident investigation and aviation safety board ( aaiasb ) of the hellenic ministry of transport & communications investigated the accident following icao practices and determined that the accident resulted from direct and latent causes . 
  the direct causes were : \u25fe non-recognition that the cabin pressurization mode selector was in the man ( manual ) position during the performance of the preflight procedure , the before start checklist and the after takeoff checklist . 
  \u25fe non-identification of the warnings and the reasons for the activation of the warnings ( cabin altitude warning horn , passenger oxygen masks deployment indication , master caution ) . 
  \u25fe incapacitation of the flight crew due to hypoxia , resulting in the continuation of the flight via the flight management computer and the autopilot , depletion of the fuel and engine flameout , and the impact of the aircraft with the ground . 
  the latent causes were : \u25fe operator 's deficiencies in the organization , quality management , and safety culture . 
  \u25fe regulatory authority 's diachronic inadequate execution of its safety oversight responsibilities . 
  \u25fe inadequate application of crew resource management principles . 
  \u25fe ineffectiveness of measures taken by the manufacturer in response to previous pressurization incidents in the particular type of aircraft . 
  the aaiasb further concluded that the following factors could have contributed to the accident : omission of returning the cabin pressurization mode selector to the auto position after non-scheduled maintenance on the aircraft ; lack of cabin crew procedures ( at an international level ) to address events involving loss of pressurization and continuation of the climb despite passenger oxygen masks deployment ; and ineffectiveness of international aviation authorities to enforce implementation of actions plans resulting from deficiencies documented in audits .

  a routine maintenance inspection had been performed monday , said martin riecken , a spokesman for lufthansa in frankfurt . 
  a more extensive check had been done in the summer of 2013 .
