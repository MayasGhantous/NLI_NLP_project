  - as many as 920,000 refugees are expected between october and december alone . 
  factoring in family members -- typically four to eight relatives join every asylum recipient -- the total could reach more than 7 million .

  hungary had the second-most asylum applicants , about 98,000 ( 16.3 % of the total ) , though that may have more to do with the country 's geographic position as a gateway to central and western europe than with its [ attitude ] ( http://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/09/16/world/europe/hungary-detains-migrants-in-border-crackdown.html?_r=0&amp;referer= ) toward migrants .
