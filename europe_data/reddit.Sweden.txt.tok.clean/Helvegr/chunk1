`` liberal '' - haha wow , learn what words mean in europe before you embarass yourself . 
  yeah , that part struck me as pretty funny , considering corporal punishment has been illegal for almost 30 years in sweden and is in fact a pretty clear facet of `` immigrant culture '' that many people would rather not have here . 
  the accusative of tveir is tv\u00e1 . 
  the actual cognate is brunn ( ur ) / br\u00f8n ( n/d ) , for anyone curious . 
  [ it 's arabic . 
  the opposite of what you said is true , most people would say scanian is just a swedish dialect , but in linguistics , when you 're using the tree model of language classification ( as this map is doing ) , you classify languages based on historical origin , which means scanian is clearly an east danish dialect . 
  look at how it 's classified on [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scanian_dialect ) , for instance . 
  not just that , but those dialects would eventually evolve into separate languages as well . 
  it obviously depends on the cooperative , i got one as a student without any income . 
  he 's just talking about housing cooperatives , where you technically buy a share in the cooperative , and then you pay a small membership fee every month . 
  the `` screening '' is usually just a formality , mostly the fact that you could afford the loan at a bank is enough . 
  you would be considered mental if you thought of all europeans as the same race 100 years ago . 
  feel free to provide a list of all races , since it 's such an obvious thing apparently . 
   there is little economic mobility under a socialist system . 
  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/intergenerational_mobility_graph-1.jpg ( lower is better ), 
  robbery and rape * are * violent crimes . 
  assault in sweden and many other eu countries includes things like slapping . 
  as long as you hurt someone else even a little , it 's assault . 
  same thing for rape , which has a much broader definition in sweden compared to pretty much everywhere else , and gets counted per instance rather than per offence . 
  as i said , since these crimes are counted very differently between the two , you have to use a relatively objective measure like murder ( although it often includes manslaughter figures ) to do a useful comparison . 
  edit : not to mention that with murder , it 's a lot more obvious when someone has actually * died * , rather than with something like rape where you only have the figures of reports vs convictions . 
  let 's use the murder rate since violent crime is defined differently pretty much everywhere . 
  the murder rate in 2014 in sweden was 0.9 per 100 000 inhabitants . 
  the lowest murder rate in the us in 2014 was new hampshire 's , which was also 0.9 per 100 000 . 
  even accounting for the rise in violent crime in 2015 , our murder rate is still `` only '' 1.1 , which means only new hampshire is safer by its 2014 numbers , as the next states ( maine , minnesota and vermont ) are at 1.6 . 
  no , it 's definitely not . 
  in pretty much any country where it was brought up in court , the defendant lost . 
  that 's why the swedish case is so unique . 
  just for the record , this is strictly illegal in pretty much every other country ( i believe there is even an eu directive ) , so on this issue we 're progressive if anything . 
  the only exceptions i know of are the us ( and even then it 's only like half their states ) and japan . 
  huh , thanks for the article , i 've only seen the numbers for svt and sr before . 
  sounds a bit weird considering most of the swedish press is liberal and support alliansen , with the exception of aftonbladet . 
  here is a [ list ] ( http://i.imgur.com/f2sngje.png ) of the supposed no-go zones , from the police report the article you posted is referencing . 
  i 've lived in one of these myself and it was definitely not on the level of rinkeby or roseng\u00e5rd . 
  it 's definitely possible that the police do n't have a lot of control there , but i think that in most places this is due to the police being understaffed rather than the places themselves being chaotic . 
  being able to buy weed in an area is n't the same as it actually being dangerous to go out in the streets . 
  ( i think that is basically the difference between the places marked with lua and urban15 vs the places that are n't in that report , actually ) . 
  rinkeby is a small town in stockholm county , it 's not a county or even a municipality . 
  also , 150 no-go zones ? 
  where did you hear about that ? 
  last i heard there were 55 , and even most of those are bullshit . 
  they 're shown as part of ukraine actually , the white lines are language borders and the dark borders are country borders . 
  https://github.com/cainesap/mapmaker/tree/master/etymologymaps + inkscape for editing, 
  http://www.faclair.com/ which seems more reputable gives saoghal for `` world '' , as does [ google translate ] ( https://translate.google.com/#en/gd/the%20world ) which uses a corpus based on books and articles , so i do n't think you 're correct ( you basically linked to a site which only compiles dictionary entries from other places , in this case probably wiktionary , without any notes on usage etc -- and it should be noted that wiktionary itself gives usage notes for saoghal translating both `` world '' and `` earth '' as its primary definition ) . 
  if anything `` cruinne '' would be a better candidate for change as it pops up in quite a few dictionaries . 
  do you have a better source ? 
  there are summer camps ( the norwegian social democratic youth party had a rather infamous one ) , generally the age span is pretty wide , from younger teenagers up to 30 years old ( although those tend to be career politicians with actual positions like chairman and whatnot ) . 
  the most active people tend to be like 18-24 . 
  gay siblings is actually one the most cited arguments against incest being illegal ( even if it 's not argued for seriously most of the time ) . 
  thank you for the information !, 
  i do n't think persian is on this map , that [ part of iran ] ( http://www.farsinet.com/farsi/images/iran_languagemapl.jpg ) mostly has azeri speakers as far as i know . 
  but thank you for the info regardless . 
  i do n't really know how it is in other countries , but here in sweden youth parties are n't really expected to be pragmatic -- they essentially exist to hold the political positions their mother party * should * have if they were ideologically consistent , but choose to forego in favour of political power and the favour of the voters . 
  the youth parties usually make statements like this in the press to bring attention to issues they think need to be discussed , but there is never really an assumption that they will have any real effect . 
  the members then join the real party when they are old enough and want to have a real political career ( except for the higher-ups like the chairman who often stay on longer ) . 
  note that the liberal youth are actually liberals in the classical sense of the word ( `` libertarian '' in us english ) , hence proposals like these . 
  they are also very drug liberal and for prostitution being legalized , iirc . 
  ( to preempt any snarky comments on this having anything to do with swedish `` liberalism '' as in leftism ), 
  yes , it shows up pretty often in finnish folk metal . 
  i originally learnt it from [ this song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3ddwvqn_v4 ) myself . 
  aromanians still seem to be a thing according to [ this article ] ( http://www.farsarotul.org/nl27_1.htm ) ( the site is obviously biased , but [ thede kahl ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ro&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=https%3a%2f%2fro.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fthede_kahl&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ) seems to be a respected professor ) , although they are n't noted on the map in the first place . 
  i 'll keep your complaints about northern greece in mind and edit the area whenever i make another map . 
  is this [ map on wikipedia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/greece_linguistic_minorities.svg ) wrong ? 
  updated version : http://i.imgur.com/fypti1m.png ( fixed irish , armenian , faroese and icelandic , added asturian ) . 
  apparently i am error-prone when it comes to languages by the atlantic . 
  thank you !, 
  it seems i missed that one . 
  i made an [ updated version ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fypti1m.png ) . 
  thanks !, 
  i made an [ updated version ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fypti1m.png ) . 
  it 's [ kildin sami ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kildin_sami_language ) , which i think has had less contact with finnish so it has n't borrowed the finnish word like the other sami languages in northern fennoscandinavia ( it has borrowed russian * mir * , though , but i included the native version because it thought it was more interesting - same thing with north sami , which has borrowed * v\u00e4rld * ) . 
  it 's kildin sami , which is essentially the only living variety left on kola . 
  and it 's definitely possible , but i have n't found any etymological sources for it either . 
  you 're welcome !, 
  i had to look it up in a [ russian dictionary ] ( http://dictionary.bumbinorn.ru/index.php?a=term&amp;d=1&amp;t=18642 ) . 
  do you know of any source for kalmyk with etymologies as well ? 
  google gives * ver\u00f6ld * around the same amount of hits as * heimur * , though , and that is with * heimur * being a faroese word as well . 
  does it have another more common meaning ? 
  edit : [ i made an updated version ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fypti1m.png ) . 
  well , i would n't say it 's `` small '' when about 37 % of latvians speak russian at home [ according to the 2011 census ] ( http://www.csb.gov.lv/sites/default/files/publikacijas/nr_13_2011gada_tautas_skaitisanas_rezultati_isuma_12_00_lv.pdf ) ( page 6 ) , but you 're correct in that it 's too large geographically on this map according to [ other maps ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/use_of_russian_language_at_home_in_latvia_%282011%29.svg/1200px-use_of_russian_language_at_home_in_latvia_%282011%29.svg.png ) . 
  i do n't think that particular version is maintained anymore , but i can at least make the area smaller myself if i make any more maps . 
  technically it is mostly a map of what wiktionary terms `` human collective existence '' , it is just that this is also the term for the physical world in most languages . 
  a map of `` the earth '' would look very different for most languages . 
  i guess this is a part of the problem when doing maps of abstract concepts . 
  i 'll change the irish word when i make an updated version . 
  edit : updated version : http://i.imgur.com/fypti1m.png . 
  [ other dictionaries ] ( http://www.teanglann.ie/en/eid/world ) give * saol * as the primary word , so i assumed that they were roughly equal . 
  a native speaker or statistics of usage would be better than a dictionary as a source . 
  this map is based on a [ standard template ] ( https://github.com/cainesap/mapmaker/blob/master/etymologymaps/resources/europe_template.svg ) which includes these divisions . 
  if you can find a good map of regions with a majority of polish speakers , i could include it in subsequent maps . 
  keep in mind this is just a map of languages spoken , not necessarily of * ethnic * minorities . 
  there are ukrainians in eastern ukraine who speak russian as their native language , as far as i know . 
  it means both , as far as i know . 
  this is common in quite a lot of languages . 
  how does occitan have `` few speakers '' , especially from a swedish perspective ? 
  you realize it has a lot more speakers than sami , right ? 
  not to mention things like elfdalian or \u00d6verkalixm\u00e5l , which most swedes have no problem with recognizing . 
  the vast majority of forests in sweden are cultivated pine and spruce forests which look like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bj637oz.jpg ) . 
  these would both be * skog * in swedish , the first one is an * urskog * ( old-growth forest ) if it 's old enough or a * naturskog * ( natural forest ) if it has had human activity in the last 150 years , the second one is a * kulturskog * ( cultivated forest ) . 
  * hex * is n't a cognate , it 's a loan from german * hexen * .
