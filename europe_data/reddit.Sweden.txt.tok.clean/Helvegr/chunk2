  the actual cognate is * hag * . 
  wapiti ( in both norwegian and swedish , and british english for that matter ) . 
  it 's not exactly a common subject since they do n't exist over here , the closest thing is red deer ( * kronhjort * ) . 
  you realize western europe is economically more right-wing than most of the world ? 
   and those are mistakes he has owned up to , are we going to talk about that the social democrats leader joined a party that voted for forced sterilisation of people with disabilities . 
  l\u00f6fven joined s a year after they voted * to repeal * that law , in 1976 . 
  bringing up forced sterilization in the context of sd is n't really a good idea , since they still support sterilizing trans people and were [ the only party ] ( http://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-lagar/utskottens-dokument/betankanden/arenden/201213/sou24/?vote=true ) to vote against repealing that law in 2013 . 
  no , brutalist architecture is definitely not unpopular . 
  i live in a brutalist apartment house built last year . 
  do you even read links ? 
   an alternative hypothesis , now obsolete because it requires unexplained and unattested phonetic irregularities , is that it 's from the greek verb \u03c3\u03ba\u03c5\u03bb\u03ac\u03c9 ( skul\u00e1\u014d ) , a variant of \u03c3\u03ba\u03c5\u03bb\u03b5\u03cd\u03c9 ( skule\u00fa\u014d , `` to get the spoils of war '' ) . 
  * you 're * the one peddling old theories , modern historical linguists think that it 's from the byzantine greek word for `` slav '' . 
  i guess this is similar to russians who think that the etymology of `` russia '' being swedish is some sort of racist old theory when every serious scholar agrees with it . 
  it 's actually because the new day was considered to begin at sunset ( in both germanic paganism and christianity ) , so christmas day actually started on what is now christmas eve . 
  i think the main difference is that in the nordic countries we used to have the yule goat give out presents in the evening and have largely carried on that tradition , whereas the anglosphere does the whole thing with presents in the morning . 
  the government ( s+mp ) only got 38 % of the vote , or 33 % of the population . 
  today they would only get ~ 27 % ( 23 % ) , according to the latest polls . 
   statistics such as a large majority of rapes in sweden being committed by the ethnic minority is a free ticket to get called a racist . 
  i 'd really like a source for these statistics . 
  i 'm guessing they 're either from the 90s or norway , though , because those are usually the ones posted . 
  there are no official statistics on ethnicity in sweden . 
  the closest you get is `` people with a foreign background '' , which includes for example my half-german mother . 
  accents in pie orthography signify stress , which is realized as higher pitch . 
  an unvoiced / v / is an / f / , which is represented by < v  in german . 
  german < w  is just a simple / v / . 
  / v / and / w / are completely different sounds , the latter of which does n't exist in ( standard ) german . 
  no , it just means bear-cloth . 
  the mushrooms are a myth . 
  as everyone knows , the uk has more people per million people . 
  scandinavian is n't a term in linguistic classification . 
  iceland is not scandinavian , for instance . 
  the correct term for norwegian , danish and swedish is `` continental north germanic '' . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/debit_mastercard https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/visa_debit, 
  no , their debit card is just called mastercard ( i have one ) . 
  debit cards are functionally equivalent to credit cards , except that you use your money directly . 
  maestro is a bank card , which you can only use at connected terminals . 
  here in sweden pretty much the only people using maestro/visa electron are people under 18 who ca n't get regular debit cards . 
  all european polities outlawed slavery in the middle ages with the introduction of christianity as far as i know , the uk was the first colonial power to recognize that buying slaves from africa and using them in their colonies also counted as slavery . 
  many countries did n't have colonies in the first place . 
  there 's no unlimited plans in sweden at least . 
  i 've seen 100gb/month for like $ 50 though , which is pretty much impossible to use up . 
  it 's an / int / meme . 
  it starts with / j / . 
  frisian is historically more related to english than dutch . 
  you 're absolutely correct , i should have actually checked the finnish etymology . 
  i just assumed it was a loan from swedish rule . 
  i think many americans are familiar with cocking a gun . 
  it 's definitely a swedish loan , you just happen to not know the word because it 's fairly uncommon nowadays . 
  http://www.saob.se/artikel/?show=hane&amp;unik=h_0399-0007.saxz&amp;pz=3 see definition 5 . 
  it 's fairly similar to the meaning of the `` hane '' ( hammer ) you see on guns . 
  `` hane '' meaning male comes from the older `` hanne '' . 
  it 's just a convenient name for other similar beers like rochefort 10 and westvleteren 12 . 
  i 've also heard it called `` abt '' after st bernardus abt 12 . 
  http://www.westvleterenbeers.com/shop/ not legit , but it 's pretty easy to buy it online these days . 
  de molen are really good , their most famous beer is hel & verdoemenis . 
  they brew a lot for other breweries like omnipollo and evil twin . 
  i meant to put `` most '' there , sorry . 
  i 've studied proto-germanic and i know quite a bit about various stages of old and middle english . 
  i know a lot more about the history of north germanic languages , though . 
  my point was that most speakers of a language know pretty much nothing about its history , that knowledge is fairly independent from the modern language . 
  that 's not how new york was named , though . 
  it was named after york . 
  the aim of this map is to show what the names actually meant when they got their names . 
  that 's how the etymology of place names works . 
  there are still a lot of personal and place names on the map . 
  if you have any specific examples of where the etymology is wrong , that would be interesting to know . 
  note that being a native speaker or being good at the modern language means very little when it comes to historical linguistics , i 'm not a native speaker of english but i know a lot more about its historical development than native speakers . 
  you get to drive by v\u00e4ttern , which is nice . 
  they 're pronounced the same in the first place , that 's why it 's a common mistake for native speakers . 
  / \u02c8w\u028ad\u0259v /, 
  no , that depends on how long you cook/bake something . 
  if you bake a cake for 30 minutes , about 35 % of the alcohol remains . 
  j\u00f3hann j\u00f3hannsson is becoming pretty famous these days too . 
  they are the most popular newspapers , yes . 
  tabloids do n't really look like this in other countries . 
  they just have large headlines with normal images . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://gfx.bloggar.aftonbladet-cdn.se/wp-content/blogs.dir/363/files/2013/06/skarmavbild-2013-06-27-kl.-16.53.40.jpg ) a typical first page from the largest tabloid in sweden . 
  the main story is `` secret e-mails exposes the mp '' . 
  hardly quality journalism , but not really at the level of calling corbyn a marxist who helps terrorists . 
  the closest equivalent you would get is when the mainstream tabloids strongly opposed sd ( basically our ukip equivalent except they actually used to be legit nazis back in the 90s ) . 
  back then you had election headlines like [ this ] ( http://bloggar.expressen.se/thomasmattsson/wp-content/blogs.dir/60/files/2012/02/bild_5506.png ) ( `` no !, 
  today we vote for sweden , against xenophobia '' ) . 
  note that both major tabloids did this . 
  the conservative tabloid tradition basically does n't exist here . 
  90 proof is 45 % . 
  the most famous swedish director of this period was victor sj\u00f6str\u00f6m , who is often considered one of the most influential directors in the history of film making . 
  his movies were often dramas based on novels and poems , and he put a lot of emphasis on dramatic landscape shots as a way to set the tone of the story . 
  the editing techniques he used to establish continuity almost look modern compared to a lot of his contemporary directors . 
  he was popular enough that he moved the the us for a while and made some hollywood movies , but his swedish movies are usually considered much better . 
  the two movies of his i 'd recommend to start with are : ** terje vigen ** from 1917 , a really depressing movie based on an ibsen poem , about a poor norwegian fisherman who gets his life destroyed when he tries to get food for his family during a war famine . 
  ** k\u00f6rkarlen ** from 1921 , based on a novel by selma lagerl\u00f6f , is about a drunk who gets visited by death 's servant and is shown the consequences of his actions . 
  it 's widely considered his masterpiece and was recently voted by the swedish association of film critics as the best swedish movie ever . 
  it directly influenced some movies which are much better known today , like the seventh seal and the shining . 
  your dialect does n't have anything to do with your ability to speak `` correct '' english , just your ability to speak standard varieties like rp and general american . 
  the ni flag is one of my favourites since it 's so unique , although it would look better if you remove the crown imo . 
  you were implicitly criticizing people who think that the communist regimes of the 20th century did n't practice `` real communism '' , and then you criticized marx for his dislike of real liberalism , the problems of which he had actual experience with , rather than your idealized version of it . 
  i am not trying to advocate for marxism , i simply care about historical accuracy and i think trying to represent complex thing like politics with simple things like a scale or graph is doomed to fail . 
   real communism  original definition of liberalism i hope you see the irony here . 
  liberals were already for gun control by marx ' time , because it is necessary for them to support the violence monopoly in order to protect capitalism . 
  you are correct that liberals originally championed personal freedoms , but it quickly turned out that this was incompatible with the capitalist social order , and those who were not willing to compromise became anarchists and socialists .
