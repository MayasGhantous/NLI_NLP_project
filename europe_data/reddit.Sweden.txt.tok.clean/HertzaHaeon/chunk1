it 's easier to understand why if you stop seeing poor people as simply a drain on the economy and contributing little or nothing to society . 
  sweden is a good example . 
  the government are buddies with the us . 
  our nsa counterpart and the real nsa are cooperating . 
  the government implemented data retention laws and then refused to dismantle them when the eu court found them at odds with human rights . 
  the solution is to go over the government 's head and force them to comply through the eu . 
  the added benefit is that any protection we manage to pass there is likely valid for the rest of eu , which restricts what gchq in the uk or any other big brother organisation can do .

   however , speaking out against organized gangs that travel between european capitols to do crime does not mean you are racist against the other group . 
  not always , but some obviously are .

  this is just generalizing and wrong . 
  * tonight on bbc news : can every headline asking a question be answered with a `` no '' ? 
  hush , you 're ruining the eurabia-jerk with facts and logics . 
   the politics talk about ind\u00e9pendance and souverainet\u00e9 . 
  but the soft power only works when you can back it up with good old hard power . 
  and as we do n't have an european army ... alternatively , politicians with vested interests in conflict are doing some saber rattling to keep people scared and pitted against each other , so the military and spying industries can keep doing their thing . 
  i suggest an equal amount of prejudice and generalization as you 'd would use if the shooter turns out to be a white ethnical european . 
    racist   muslim  what race ? 
  we can call it xenophobic instead , if you like . 
  saber rattling being used as an excuse to keep wasting money on more sabers of our own . 
  we have bigger problems . 
   almost closing our military down while changing focus to enviromental threats ... 
  i prefer a focus on the real threat of climate change instead of tired old war and spying games . 
  there 's certainly rural pride in some parts of sweden that easily seems ignorant to the rest of us . 
  it 's hard to say how much of it is real and how much of it is our own prejudice against them . 
  however , it 's generally agreed on that there is a problem with young men staying behind in less well off rural parts , foregoing higher education and being left behind by the young women who move away to study . 
  i 'd ask what recent nazi history do the social democrats have , but that would mean accepting this obvious attempt at distracting the issue with whataboutism . 
   she accused akesson and sd of being a nazi party ... she asked about the party 's * nazi roots * , which is different . 
  [ the party program from 1994 ] ( http://www.interasistmen.se/granskning/akesson-ljog-sig-bla-agenda-det-finns-inga-exempel-pa-rasism-sds-historia/ ) contains gems like keeping sweden ethnically clean , throwing out immigrants , forbidding immigration and only supporting nationalistic art . 
  the party newspaper contains blatant homophobia . 
  notice the pictures with the swastika and the seig heil salutes . 
  questions about nazi and racist roots are more than appropriate . 
  \u00c5kesson has been dodging and lying about them for a long time now . 
   ... when nobody is allowed to discuss immigration in your country ...

  so much for discussing immigration . 
  saying you 're not allowed to discuss it is a whiny trick . 
  all cultures are n't the same on this issue . 
  [ spain did n't criminalize marital rape until 1992 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spousal_rape#legal_changes ) . 
  the same is true for a lot of developed countries . 
  i 'm not saying that spain is a third world country , but until not long ago it was legal to rape your wife there , and presumably there was some social acceptance and expectations of wifely obligations regardless of how she feels about it . 
  it 's not that hard to find people here on reddit arguing that marriage means contracted consent or some such crap . 
  and let 's not forget the [ obsession reddit has with hitting women ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/adviceanimals/comments/1qv5ni/men_cant_hit_women_first_but/ ) . 
  so sure , most people think it 's unacceptable to beat a woman , but clearly there are exceptions . 
  reported rapes are indeed very high in sweden , but other official studies suggest the actual problem is n't that extreme :  instead of looking at the statistics for crimes reported -- which in any case merely show a proportion of the actual number of crimes -- criminologists instead recommend comparisons between countries based on large surveys of the general public , so-called victim surveys . 
   ... sweden is around the average mark , which is also the case for assaults and threats , despite the fact that compared to other countries , we have many such crimes reported . 
  [ how common is rape in sweden compared to other european countries ?

  how about we give europeans something to unite behind and be proud of , instead of trying to will it into existance through policitics and buraeucracy ? 
   i know we 'd be 50 + years late to the party , but send some european astronauts to the moon already . 
  why just repeat an old accomplishment ? 
  i say we aim for mars . 
  simply not believing is fine for some , but most atheists go beyond this dictionary definition of atheism and have other interests and convictions that are strongly related to their atheism . 
  secularism is a common political view strongly linked with atheism . 
  an interest in science or skepticism is also common . 
  there are many secular , humanist and atheist charities . 
  for atheists in an otherwise religious place just the social aspect of meeting like-minded people is a big thing . 
  so no , these are n't just regular clubs , just like atheist forums are n't filled with people * not * talking about god . 
   ... except they 're pretending to be better . 
  i wonder why . 
   typical liberal scum .

  no , it says right here [ in your comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1uza0i/gender_is_the_new_enemy_of_the_polish_church/cenbo8t ) :  here you go , a lossless compression of your post , free of charge :   i am swedish . 
  no argument , just dismissal . 
   i merely pointed out that you 've conveyed the same information as you would have by stating you 're swedish , making a joke about the stereotype of all swedes being ultraliberal cultural marxists . 
  so it 's * prejudiced * dismissal . 
  you 're still a hypocrite for demanding serious arguments when you yourself give replies like these . 
  that 's pretty rich coming from someone who [ argued against my original comment simply by dismissing it because i 'm swedish ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1uza0i/gender_is_the_new_enemy_of_the_polish_church/cencs3e ) . 
   you do n't want a debate , you 're out to prove everyone who disagrees with you is crazy , or at the very least a nazi psychopath . 
  no need , i think you 're doing quite a good job of proving that yourself . 
  this is the correct answer . 
  well , except for me being a leftist maniac . 
   ... i did n't hear of a single instance of any kindergarten forcing boys to wear skirts or anything ( which is an often raised argument against `` gender '' , that it happens or is going to happen ) . 
  forcing gender on children does actually happen , only it 's not progressive people forcing boys to wear skirts , but conservative people forcing them not to . 
   also , i do n't really get what 's the deal with `` fighting for the proper families '' . 
  i mean , who the hell cares , and why ? 
  traditional families are dominated by men and women have less power . 
  fighting for the traditional family is a way of keeping such old power structures alive . 
  [ anyone opposed to this should read this article ] ( http://www.watoday.com.au/national/this-is-angelique-she-wanted-to-die-with-dignity-20080913-4fqi.html?page=-1 ) . 
   just a month shy of her 31st birthday and half a lifetime since she was diagnosed with the debilitating crohn 's disease at 15 , angelique flowers was told she had colon cancer . 
  it was so advanced and so aggressive , she was given only months to live . 
   that was in may . 
  she would have dearly loved to have spent her last days with those closest to her , but another desire was overwhelming . 
   frightened of a slow , painful death from a total bowel obstruction , this softly spoken melbourne writer wanted her life to end peacefully and on her own terms . 
   it was n't to be . 
  she regretfully turned away from her loved ones and spent her final weeks searching for information about euthanasia and a dose of the lethal drug nembutal . 
  ** her final hours were robbed of the dignity she had wanted as she died vomiting the content of her bowels . 
  ** that 's such horrible fate that i do n't even wish it on the people opposing euthanasia . 
  they should however be made to look into this woman 's eyes as she vomits her own shit and explain how it 's better that she lives out her last few agonizing days than to end it painlessly and on her own terms . 
  either we decide public broadcasting is a valuable service for everyone and a good alternative to private media , and then everyone pays for it through actual taxes , or it the license fees need to be limited to those who actually watch it . 
  i 'm all for public broadcasting in principle , although the swedish tv channels have too much crap that mimic private networks , like silly game shows . 
  if you absolutely have to have a gameshow , at least make it smart and different , like qi .

  it 's getting inevitable . 
  it 'll likely be a major issue in next year 's election . 
  you could say that about the environment too , and it 'll be true until a flood sweeps your house away or pollution gives your kids cancer . 
  the idea is to keep these issues off the top ten list of * actual * problems by keeping them on the top ten list of concerns . 
  men are * even more * overrepresented among criminals . 
  what action should we logic take against men ? 
  according to your logic it should be harsher than that against immigrants .
