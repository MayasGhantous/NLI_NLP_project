  they wo n't be able to resist the march of progress forever , especially not when we show them there 's nothing to fear . 
  democracy has limits . 
  well , it should have . 
  you should n't be able to vote away someone 's equality , rights or freedom . 
  anti-gay marriage -  anti-equality based on sexuality -  homophobia . 
  you single out homosexuals for inequal treatment , denying them the rights that other adults have , solely based on their sexuality . 
  that 's homophobic . 
  there are no rational , secular reasons to deny same sex marriage . 
  you ca n't prove it 's bad for kids or society , but there 's in fact plenty of evidence supporting the opposite conclusions . 
  you do n't own marriage , and neither does the church or the state . 
  it 's not yours to deny to others . 
  there 's nothing left but an irrational hate , digust , unease or prejudice . 
  that 's called * homophobia * . 
  i 'm sure you 're otherwise a good person . 
  i 'm sure you do n't otherwise hate gays . 
  but denying them marriage is an act of homophobia . 
  so what 's the alternative ? 
  the church ? 
  * please * . 
  biological parents ? 
  plenty of those are shitty , abusive people who should n't be near kids . 
  it 's no guarantee for anything , other than the continuation of conservative power . 
  it might be secular , but it 's not rational . 
  studies have shown same sex parents to be just as good as others . 
  whatever a `` true parent '' is is subjective and not based in objective reality , because biological bonds do n't autoamtically make a parent good . 
  not only can true parents be shitty parents , but single parents , parents of adopted children and other `` fake '' parents can be good too . 
  there 's also no basis for any threat to civilization . 
  i 'd say there 's correlations for the opposite . 
  countries that are free , equal and tolerant are much better places than those that are n't , including attitudes towards lbgt people . 
  marriage is n't your institution either . 
  you do n't own marriage , neither does the church . 
   ** article 16 . 
  **  ( 1 ) men and women of full age , without any limitation due to race , nationality or religion , have the right to marry and to found a family . 
  they are entitled to equal rights as to marriage , during marriage and at its dissolution . 
  but but but it says `` men and women '' !, 
  it states the right to marriage for men and women . 
  it says nothing about having to marry * each other * . 
  i grew up in helsingborg , so i feel you . 
  i never contributed myself though . 
  when i 've been drunk in denmark , i 've been a gentleman . 
  in sweden you can buy a bottle or can of beer for 1 $ . 
  for 3 $ you get something that 's actually good . 
  i have to wonder how much cheaper people need it and how healthy their drinking habits are if they buy lots of ultra cheap booze . 
  if price is your main concern , it might be cheaper in denmark , although i do n't know how the exchange rate affects it . 
  if you want quality however , i 've been told the swedish booze store has a great selection . 
  because he 's a white supremacist who regularly writes in / r/whiterights . 
  fyi -- you 're debating a white supremacist who regularly writes in / r/whiterights . 
  note to downvoters : this is a factual statement . 
  check his posting history . 
  i 'd like to see those studies . 
  where i live , parental leave is slowly but steadily getting more equal without such effects . 
  noone is taking about a strict 50-50 split . 
  you do realize were ' far , far from such a balance , right ? 
  getting even a 30-70 split would be a huge step . 
  there are n't too many men changing diapers , so yeah , about those `` less comfortable sectors '' ... 
  well hey , some people say that male circumcision is good for sex . 
  problem solved , right ? 
  encouraging a minority into a new role they have n't had access to before is liberating . 
  if a top christian cleric like the pope or an archbishop declares something like this , it 's not just an opinion . 
  but whatever , it 's easy to find [ other sources ] ( http://news.discovery.com/human/female-genital-mutilation-begin-121210.htm ) claiming the same thing . 
  [ it 's obvious that fgm has this effect ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2008/nov/13/female-genital-mutilation-sexual-dysfunction ) . 
  with so many millions suffering , it 's not a surprise to anyone . 
  so * at best * it 's a consequence they do n't give a shit about . 
  why ? 
  because the women have n't lost anything important . 
  which brings us back to my point . 
  and the issue that was the focus of our discussion just * happened * to be excluded . 
  curious . 
  could 've fooled me since you omitted it fromy our list of reasons . 
  as for who 's `` perpetuating '' of circumcision , i do n't know because i have n't read it . 
  just hearing sounds bad , but i know doctors here would rather perform it themselves than have non professionals doing it . 
  it does n't mean they think it 's a good thing , only that they prefer realistic damage prevention over ideological purity . 
   personal attacks ... you dismiss them as untrustworthy instead of dealign with any actual argument , which is textbook ad hominem . 
  also you present your own highly biased opinion as `` fact '' . 
  still dismissing sexual purity for women as a reason , i see . 
  i never questioned male circumcision and sex . 
  however , it 's easy to find modern defences of circumcision that argues that it 's beneficial for sex . 
   i do n't consider the who an objective source ... 
   as to your other source , fgm activists and feminist are notoriously ambivalent or outright antagonistically dishonest about separating mgm and fgm by means of `` intent '' . 
  good bye . 
  well , let 's see . 
  the world has gone from a horribly prejudiced and oppressive place to a place much less so , because of the work of brave people working for social justice . 
  that could suddenly stop or it could continue . 
  i know which one i 'm counting on . 
  encouraging women into motherhood is first of all not necessary , but it would be limiting because it 's a traditional gender role with all that it entails . 
  if it 's to be an equal , free choice you ca n't just leave it as it is , you need to change it and society around it . 
  you dismiss me with `` it 's just one cleric '' and then go on to present just one mother . 
  not very convincing . 
  alright , [ let 's see what who has to say ] ( http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/ ) :  fgm is often motivated by beliefs about what is considered proper sexual behaviour , linking procedures to premarital virginity and marital fidelity . 
  fgm is in many communities believed to reduce a woman 's libido and therefore believed to help her resist `` illicit '' sexual acts . 
  when a vaginal opening is covered or narrowed ( type 3 above ) , the fear of the pain of opening it , and the fear that this will be found out , is expected to further discourage `` illicit '' sexual intercourse among women with this type of fgm . 
   fgm is associated with cultural ideals of femininity and modesty , which include the notion that girls are `` clean '' and `` beautiful '' after removal of body parts that are considered `` male '' or `` unclean '' . 
  here 's the campaign [ desert flower foundation ] ( http://www.desertflowerfoundation.org/en/what-is-fgm/ ) aimed at ending fgm :  female genital mutilation ( often referred to as fgm ) is a destructive operation , during which the female genitals are partly or entirely removed or injured with the goals of inhibiting a woman 's sexual feelings . 
  so yes , it 's very much about sexual control of women and it 's disgusting to see you dismissing it . 
  if you aim is to protect boys against circumcision you 've managed to piss all over both issues . 
   these are the results , not the motives . 
  oh , sure , they 're just * happen * to be exactly the results i talk about , but surely noone intends for them to happen . 
  right . 
  no , the result is still not the same . 
  you misunderstanding things can be dealth by explaining them to you or simply ignoring you while the world moves on .
