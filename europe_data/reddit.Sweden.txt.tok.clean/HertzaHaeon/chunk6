  noone is pushing women into anything . 
  well , except society who pushes them into motherhood and such . 
  encouraging women to break into male dominated fields is not pushing them . 
   parents circumcise their daughters because they believe it is the right thing to do ; they do believe it is more hygienic , more aesthetic , religiously mandated , etc. 
  basically the exact same reasons boys are circumcised . 
  wrong . 
  there 's a strong element of sexual control in female genital mutilation . 
  from [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/female_genital_mutilation ) :  the practice is carried out by some communities who believe i ** t reduces a woman 's libido ** -- according to official statements of the the top muslim clerical body of the largest muslim-majority nation of the world , the indonesian ulema council , `` the practice ( of fgm ) is a religious obligation that should be done to ** control women 's sexual desires ** '' . 
   ... type iii ( infibulation ) , removal of all or part of the inner and outer labia , and usually the clitoris , and the fusion of the wound , leaving a small hole for the passage of urine and menstrual blood -- ** the fused wound is opened for intercourse ** and childbirth . 
  i 've been into feminism for quite a while and on reddit for a year or so . 
  it 's quite obvious far from everyone are aware of how sexism works . 
  you know what , as long as you do n't stand in the way of progress i do n't care what you think . 
  you continue doing nothing . 
  we 'll manage . 
  the commincation failed ... or you did n't get it . 
  personal choices are n't made for no reason . 
  expectations on women might make some choose to stay home , for example . 
  no , it 's not the main talking point . 
  it 's one of several symbolic issues . 
  equality in the working place overall is a much more important issue . 
  women working less is a problem because it means they earn less and have less power . 
  they 're more tied to parenthood , which means father 's are * less * tied to parenthood . 
  it 's bad for everyone . 
  more female university graduates is n't a problem per se , although it 's strange that this academic achievement does n't carry over to the top positions in academia and industry . 
  also , you might want to worry about underachieving men and what it means for them . 
  i never claimed legislation is the only answer . 
  i think it still has its place , but it 's mostly down to activism and awareness now . 
  years ago i was very skeptical and critical of many feminist issues . 
  i did n't have to die to come around . 
  i 've seen people change often enough to think it 's worthwhile . 
  also , activism if for younger generations , to give them the chance to change . 
  no , not `` too bad '' . 
  like i said , anti-racists did n't just go `` too bad '' and wait racism out . 
  if they had , we would n't be where we are today . 
  why ? 
  biology means women need to take out the * initial * parental leave , not * more * parental leave . 
  the father can just wait and take out his later , when biology does n't matter . 
  that 's a good point . 
  i would n't be surprised if that 's the unspoken assumption . 
  equality in law is a first important step , but laws do n't cover everything . 
  it 's like with the us . 
  racism is n't over just because they have a black president . 
  speaking of racism , people did n't just wait for that to end . 
  they stood up against it and pushed it down , which is good , because we do n't have so much of it today . 
  the same goes for gender equality . 
  it 's gotten better , but to think sexism is magically over after millenia of dominating the world is naive . 
  i work in it and i see plenty of shitty sexism towards women in the field . 
  it 's still alive and kicking . 
  i meant all gender differences significant to the matter at hand . 
  how much more men can bench press is hardly relevant for a ceo . 
   the striking result is that 30 % of the effect sizes are in the close-to-zero range , and an additional 48 % are in the small range . 
  that is , ** 78 % of gender differences are small or close to zero ** . 
  the big differences are these :  the largest gender differences in table 1 are in the domain of motor performance ... a second area in which large gender differences are found is some -- but not all -- measures of sexuality ... 
  nothing relevant for a ceo , like i said . 
  i 'm not dogmatically against biological factors , i 'm against the automatic assumption that they 're significant . 
  feminism does n't have all that much power in academia . 
  also , these things are n't often so obvious you can easily deal with them . 
  discrimination is often subtle and subconscious . 
  few people actively dismiss women for conscious sexist reasons . 
  i do n't know why you 're downvoted . 
  i 'm not downvoting you . 
   ... is n't it just sensible and to be expected that women more often cut back on paid work when children arrive in a family ( since the only difference between the two partners are the physical issues ) ? 
  why is that sensible ? 
  except for the very beginning , there 's no good reason for the parents not to split parental leave equally . 
  tradition is not a good reason . 
   do you dogmatically reject any possibly of there being differences in biological predispositions between sexes ... no . 
  [ there are good , objective reasons to believe almost all gender differences are small to insignificant ] ( http://www.careerpioneernetwork.org/wwwroot/userfiles/files/the_gender_similarities_hypothesis.pdf ) . 
  not long ago people dogmatically believed women 's math ability was biologically lower than that of men 's . 
  today we know it 's not so . 
  so who really should worry about dogma here ? 
  us , or the people who support ideas about gender that area thousands of years old ? 
  you took one of several point in the graphic . 
  you did reduce it . 
  why can we only campaign for one thing ? 
  do you realize that whatever we choose , you can always point to some other problem , claim it 's worse and ask why we 're not dealing with that . 
  so let me ask you , why are you on my case and not complaining about something more important ? 
   i 'll wait for men 's day ... that 's tomorrow . 
  and the day after that . 
  and the day after that . 
  and the day after that . 
  and the day after that . 
  and the day after that . 
  if it 's just a free choice , sure . 
  but if it 's a choice made because it 's so much harder because of your gender , it 's not fine . 
  female ceos is but one point on this graphic . 
  that 's not to say equal representation in power is n't important , and that includes the people who run corporations . 
  but besides that , the way women work is something that affect a huge number of people . 
  reducing it to just a question of ceos is dishonest . 
  academic performance of boys in school and the resulting better representation in academia is also an important issue , although a bit beside the point on the international women 's day . 
  by putting these issues against each other you 're not doing either justice . 
  women 's equality in academia has n't really reached the very top . 
  you still hear people spouting nonsense about how women are biologically worse at math and such . 
  i suspect the main reason is n't as obvious though . 
  few people consciously discriminate . 
  sexism is usually more insidious . 
  you 're talking about the * clinical * definition of phobia . 
  the general but still literal definition includes irrational * aversion * to something , not just fear . 
  similarly , mental illness has strict definitions clinically , but i 'm not holding you to them if you call someone `` crazy '' . 
  let 's make a deal . 
  protests are limited to weekends when the trampling of people 's rights and freedoms is limited to weekends .
