  what if hitler 's or stalin 's mothers had been `` progressive '' ? 
  that would 've saved poland a lot of trouble . 
  by your logic . 
  there 's [ an interactive version ] ( https://www.bcgperspectives.com/content/interactive/public_sector_globalization_interactive_map_sustainable_economic_development/ ) . 
  thumbnail is from copenhagen . 
   many people do make their own guns over in the east . 
  do many mass shooters and terrorists use homemade guns , or do they use guns that once were legal ? 
  i ca n't remember a single case of the former , but if you have some feel free to post them . 
   they are also often shipped from elsewhere , illegally . 
  criminals ignore bans , therefore we should n't have bans ? 
   i strongly doubt any of us are cheering over police ... how will you deal with violence and oppression from a militarized police force with guns ? 
   ... politicians shitting on our rights . 
  they 're * your * rights , not * our * rights . 
  owning firearms is n't a fundamental right to me or my country , just as little as running a nuclear reactor in my basement is . 
   feel free to be at the whim of others , i 'll pass . 
  people manage the dark side 's of society in many places just fine without guns . 
   lets ban big trucks and cars that go faster than 20 kmh then , we will be safe this way !, 
  clearly the only way to stop a bad man with a truck is to provide private citizens with their own trucks . 
   illegal guns . 
  unless criminals are making their own guns , all illegal guns start out as legal . 
  restricting the number of legal guns in society reasonably restricts the number of illegal ones too . 
   if you want the security forces to be able to stop it all , you would need to give them the power to investigate anyone at will and throw away your privacy ... 
  which is exactly what the us does and plenty of the gun owners cheer for it . 
   i figure people ought to be able to defend themselves , that 's a basic human right . 
  i 'm still allowed to defend myself . 
   according to a unodc study , it 's hovering right around 1.1 murders ( by all methods ) per 100,000 versus say , germany , which has 0.9 !, 
  a low murder rate is really an argument against the need for guns for self protection . 
  if you 're arguing that the rate is low * because * of guns , you should show that causal link . 
   firstly , ignoring the referendum is not undemocratic . 
  the ref was advisory only ... 
  if you want to make it more democratic i guess you could have an election where a party promises to ignore the referendum if they win . 
   if the entire planet became homosexual , and we all refused to reproduce , then what ? 
  have you considered how heterosexuality affects society ? 
  what if the entire planet became heterosexual and would n't stop reproducing ? 
   the open space and untouched wildlife is nice too . 
  well , at least until they sell off your wilderness to private interests or remove it to get at the juicy coal , oil and gas it 's growing on top of . 
  a verbal switcharoo wo n't cure homophobia . 
  people who deny you equal rights are unlikely to care when you 're targeted by hate crimes . 
  they might care if they can use you as a pawn for their xenophobia , but they 'll justify all bigotry from white christians . 
  we 'll see when le pen continues to show her true colors with whatever comes after this marriage ban . 
  i 'm guessing they 're not rainbow colors . 
  if you like referendums so much , let 's hold one to ban sd . 
  so bigots with no power have hurt them . 
  how does he figure that bigots * with * power wo n't hurt them ? 
  discrimination and violence are bad enough even when they 're illegal and frowned on by society . 
  why vote for politicians who will make discrimination and violence legal and socially accepted ? 
  i 'm not against defense per se , just outspending the ridiculous us spending on sabers to rattle . 
  if you want me to help defend europe against the evil ruskies , i need something worth defending . 
  a border or a flag is n't nearly enough . 
   a joint defense force of the eu could contest the us within a decade . 
  or we could spend that money on society , science , technology , healthcare , culture , education , etc and be a rich , fair , developed , progressive and green union , instead of merely a well armed one . 
  anti-muslim bigotry goes far beyond simple racism , that 's true . 
   calling anything and everything `` fascism '' dilutes the meaning of the word . 
   for instance i consider islamism to be a new brand of fascism . 
  listen to yourself . 
   then you admit their intolerance is a problem but the only disagreement is whether they will dominate or not in the future . 
  the extreme right are a group fitting that description , but there 's an actual real risk of it happening , as well as a very dark historical example of it happening . 
  you 're playing right into their hands by furthering this fear mongering lies about eurabia . 
  here 's a proud core value for you -- fighting racists . 
  hips don ' lie , they just present alternative facts . 
   the right wing populists are more protecting of their countries . 
  i wonder if that does n't fulfill the same urge . 
  they declare parts of their own country invaded by foreigners and retake them . 
  and by trying to save noone you 'll save even fewer . 
  if the far right gets its way , we 'll be just as intolerant , so the scaremongering is just projection . 
  then everyone could 've shrugged off his acts as those of an insane monster , instead of a rational person following a common extreme ideology to its conclusion . 
   and some random music streaming service . 
  is it really random though , or is it a service that has struck a deal with the operator to buy and unfair advantage over competitors ? 
   on behalf of all americans , i express my sincerest apology for american ( as well as british and canadian ) invasion of france in 1944 . 
  you were indeed very late , but it turned out fine in the end . 
  no apology needed . 
  american is n't a race . 
  by that logic it 's fine to hate you for being american because of what has been done in the name of your country . 
  thinking all of islam is backwards and dangerous is an ugly , prejudiced and hateful idea . 
  on top of that , it 's probably an outcome terrorists hope for , to make all muslims your enemy . 
   remember that a lot of the things that a child learns growing up is from home and having 2 dads/moms as normal could have a devastating long term effect on the child and how he/she will have/see relationships in the future . 
  gay couples wo n't produce gay children . 
  plenty of gay children come out of straight couples . 
  besides , this is kind of a bad attitude towards single parents , who can do well with the right support . 
  [ apparently the current directive already being used in lithuania to uphold a russia-style anti-gay propaganda law . 
  ] ( https://euobserver.com/lgbti/137945 ) wtf , lithuania ? 
  if you think not getting married is all there 's to right wing homophobia , you 'll be sadly surprised . 
  the vast majority of immigrants are n't violent towards gay people . 
  plenty of right wing extremists still go around harassing and beating lbgtq people . 
   they worry about people bringing very homophobic views from comparatively socially backward countries voting a homegrown homophobe into power than to import a few foreign homophobes that have little to no power , makes sense . 
   no , we used to be attacked and then cultural change virtually put an end to that . 
  except that it 's now obvious the far right did n't actually change , they just switched focus from the gays to the muslims for a while . 
  the part that is unhappy with the current status is n't * that * big . 
  the opposition 's lead in the polls is quite small , and even so two of three of the parties have significant overlap with the sitting government 's politics . 
  the political middle in sweden is crowded and it 's not clear that a switch would mean any actual significant changes . 
  alternatively , he 's just as good as many others but was n't hired until someone smacked the racists upside the head with an anti-discrimination law . 
  so it 's not race , it 's ethnicity and culture you base your prejudice on . 
  got it . 
  [ exactly my thought ] ( http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=z8ehg1neoorltg_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=gerd_t1&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country_group&amp;idim=country_group:nmec&amp;idim=country:gbr:usa:deu:fra:pol:esp:ita:che:nld:chn&amp;ifdim=country_group&amp;tstart=-620701200000&amp;tend=2535058800000&amp;ind=false#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=gerd_t1&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country_group&amp;idim=country_group:nmec&amp;idim=country:gbr:usa:deu:fra:pol:esp:ita:che:nld:chn:swe:isl:fin&amp;ifdim=country_group&amp;tstart=-620701200000&amp;tend=2535058800000&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en_us&amp;ind=false ) . 
  i also added iceland . 
  just as well , what with climate change and all . 
  if they 're smart they 'll invest the oil money in green tech and energy alternatives . 
  as a swedish atheist , the sacrilege is even sweeter than all the candy . 
  it 's hot enough for me , but i guess some like it hotter . 
  you should try visiting during the summer .
