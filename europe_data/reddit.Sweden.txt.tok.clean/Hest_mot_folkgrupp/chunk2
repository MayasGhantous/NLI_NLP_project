  the curtains ? 
  i feel like this is a conflict both sides want . 
  ksa because , according to numerous articles published in the past months , it has only a few years left before it collapses due to running out of money or tensions within the royal family , because the shia crescent seems to be nearing completion , cutting of turkey from the rest of the sunni middle east , and because the west might soon abandon the ksa . 
  so the ksa wants to confront iran now when the scales are still somewhat balanced . 
  if iran develops nuclear weapons in the near future it will be too late . 
  iran on the other hand , is growing more powerful and currently enjoys sympathy from both western leaders and media and from russia . 
  when or if iran develops nuclear weapons this might change very quickly . 
  whether it will come to an open conflict between the ksa and iran , or if they 'll fight each other with proxy wars like they 've been doing these past years , but more intense , is an open question . 
  a meteor could slam into earth if you do n't click that dank upboat button , warns swedish redditor hest_mot_folkgrupp . 
  these laws wo n't have any impact on weapon smugglers and criminals who buy from them . 
  i 'd say we have to take care of the smuggling first and then deal with legal gun owners if it 's necessary .

  i do n't know if lower birthrate is the way to go . 
  south korea has issues with a population that will begin decreasing in 2017 . 
  contrary to popular belief , a decline in birthrate is very dangerous to a nation 's economy . 
  this is a quote from a comment by the op of the thread [ korean economists present dire consequences for south korean economy in 20 years if south korea does not accept 300,000 new immigrants per year ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/3w6au9/korean_economists_present_dire_consequences_for/ ) :  think of this as demand and production . 
  if demand for products dies due to shrinking and aging population , the economy goes into a tail spin . 
  the domestic spending in korea has been steadily declining over the last several years - it 's not coincidence that it 's pararell to korea 's low birth rate . 
  older , slowing population , means lower economic growth - it 's a natural law that you ca n't get away from . 
  i think that , in order to secure the future of the eu an initial influx of people ( from countries that have a positive birth rate , either in europe and outside of it ) as well as policies that promote childbearing and a shift in how education is perceived , so that we do n't end up just with millions of highly educated people that wo n't want to perform menial jobs , have to be implemented . 
  it sounds harsh , but that 's what has to be done , atleast until automatisation comes around and/or we start cloning babies to maintain a steady ratio of newborn to deceased . 
  well , does op think the eu expanded eastwards because of the kindness of our hearts ? 
  give me a break . 
  the reasons eastern europe was let into eu was 1 ) to snatch the states away from russia , who at the time was pretty weak , and 2 ) to expand the european economy . 
  no one in their right mind would have let eastern european states join the eu because they were poor and miserable . 
  sorry , but that 's not how the world works . 
  as for the myth that we need refugees so that they can work for us : there are tons of young people in southern and eastern europe who are unemployed . 
  why ca n't we use them instead of refugees who need to first settle down , learn the language and get their education to the european level ? 
  because the refugees will be cheaper ? 
  well , the salaries in newer member states are n't exactly on the level of western europe either . 
  call me a racist , but i think we should take care of our own in the union before we take care of the rest of the world . 
  if trump becomes the next potus and the uk follows through with the brexit they wo n't have many important friends left in the arena of international politics . 
  would n't want to be cameron if he has to apologize to trump .

  i 'm as much opposed to ksa as i 'm opposed to iran . 
  the `` enemy of my enemy is my friend '' is exactly the kind of mentality that caused the rise of the taliban , al-qaida and daesh . 
  just because iran is the natural enemy of ksa , who are currently being blasted in the media , does n't mean they 're suddenly the good guys or that they have done nothing wrong . 
  even though the us is n't in europe ( whether israel is or is n't can be argued ) , they 're in nato , which means that if they 're attacked every member state has to step in and help them . 
  so it 's a valid concern if an ally is threatened on a regular basis . 
  as for iran 's intentions regarding nuclear weapons , take a look at this video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t13zn8smvke even though the video is relatively old , the west 's only way of keeping iran from gaining nuclear weapons are still sanctions or military intervention , which is quite concerning when iranian people have a penchant for burning among others western flags , including british . 
  no , i think you are the one who 's being hypocritical . 
  you wrote that iranians have done nothing wrong , when their judicial system does n't respect human rights and is in some regards equally as despicable as that of saudi arabia . 
  it 's not my job to bring up israel or ksa when you make an erronous claim about iran . 
  it 's yours . 
  the same iran whose leaders keep chanting `` death to america !, 
  death to israel ! '', 
  while trying to get their hands on nuclear weapons ? 
  do you mean that iran ? 
  the same iran that doles out 74 lashes to people who kiss illicitly , convene unlawful meetings etc , and 80 lashes to those who consume alcohol and those who commit adultury ? 
  the important difference between the holy texts is that muslims agree that the quran is the word of allah which means it 's perfect , ca n't be changed and contains the ultimate truth , whereas most christians would agree that the bible is n't the word of god as it was written by prophets , apostles and a bunch of other guys and it has been edited many times over the course of history . 
  because of that christians have it easier when they choose what to believe in the bible and what to ignore . 
  muslims , on the other hand , ca n't very well choose separate passages from a text that 's literally the word of allah . 
  are n't the bulgarian border police the ones that have been accused of stealing stuff from migrants ? 
  i mean , i do n't give two shits if it 's true or not , but it 's strange that an `` enlightened '' leader such as cameron would praise them . 
  `` i know not who will fight in world war iv , but world war iii will be fought between russian hooligans and turkish shop owners , and left to future generations with dash cam footage . '' \\ - albert einstein, 
  to be fair , when i try to chat up women at the local bar a burka or niqab is an instant turn-off . 
  so the turks have their own little green men now . 
  i wonder if a certain world leader sees the irony in this . 
  people who think the french are cheese-eating surrender monkeys should play europa universalis 4 . 
  the number of times i 've been steamrolled as castile after i 've gotten into a war with france because of some moronic ally ... 
  lmao this thread is labelled news ? 
  got ta stay prepared in case those mischievous russians go bananas once we 've pounded daesh into the ground . 
  nice meme , pal . 
  how do you explain the openly homosexual priests in the swedish church with your sweeping generalisations about christians ? 
  from the translated article :  second , be prepared for a protracted battle of ideas . 
  european leaders need to tackle the infrastructure of indoctrination : mosques and muslim schools , websites and conversion material ( pamphlets , books , sermons ) which serve as a conveyor belt to the violence . 
  honestly , it 's not a bad idea . 
  putting all our effort into stabilizing syria while doing nothing about the threats back home is a terrible idea . 
  `` do n't let your dreams be dreams . '', 
  while i agree with you regarding the entertainment media 's role in shaping public opinion , the movie has been in the works for years , while the current intensity of the balkan route crisis is about six months old . 
  the first game , which the movie is based on , ended with stormwind being destroyed by the orcs , who were very much under the influence of the burning legion then . 
  a sympathetic view of the orcs did n't emerge until thrall became warchief of the orcish horde in warcraft iii , and this will probably not be included in the movie . 
  i believe blizzard 's intention of course is n't to positively address the current crisis , because they are a business and not some philanthropic organization , as the primary intention is to stop the accelerating loss of wow subscribers . 
  to subscribers and fans of the warcraft franchise the success of the movie will depend on how close the adaptation is to the source material . 
  ( well , i do n't know if you 'll be able to read my reply , as i was permabanned from this sub for posting this thread yesterday , but it seems as though it has since been revoked ... ? 
  ( but i 'm not sure as i 've not been notified of any change by the mods ) . 
  so here goes nothing . 
  and i hope i 'm not violating any forum rules by mentioning my ban . ), 
  i can see medivh being more as an allegory for merkel . 
  the mage was born with the corruption already in him , and i can see similarities between this and merkel 's younger years in the ddr . 
  of course , i 'm *** not claiming *** that merkel is evil and harbors any intentions of destroying europe , but for a long time eastern europe and the soviet union were seen as the big foe in the west . 
  medivh did what he did because he had no choice , because the influence demanded him to do so . 
  let 's forget for a moment that this is a question about black and white , good and evil , wrong and right . 
  whatever your current opinion of merkel is , i believe that she had *** no choice *** when she invited the refugees to germany , as the opinion in media and the general population overwhelmingly was positive to the idea of helping as many people as possible . 
  remember that *** i do not say that the opinion of media and the population is an evil influence *** , but it is an influence no politician has much control over , just as medivh had no control over his corruption . 
  after medivh died , he later came back as an oracle , warning others of similar mistakes he himself made . 
  whether merkel 's political career survives this crisis or not is a good question . 
  if it does n't it 's not entirely impossible that she will become like a lot of former western politicians : an unimportant authority and expert figure who nevertheless is sometimes invited to give their opinion on an issue , mostly issues they were working with while in office , in the form of interviews , in the form of autobiographical books etc etc. 
  i understand why people are offended by my comparison of the movie and the current crisis , as *** the former is a question of good versus evil , while the latter most certainly is n't *** , but that is unfortunately how entertainment media works . 
  black and white is much more appealing to an audience than a bleak world of grey nuances . 
  it 's much easier to understand black and white than grey . 
  you might think that 's the case , but both of us know that if you have such a visible position as leader for a public organization you ca n't afford to say whatever you want , or something out of line with the pc opinion , because if someone finds a reason to call you a racist , you 've probably done some damage to your career and could be replaced . 
  even though the leader did n't welcome the migrants back in september ( i do n't know if this is true as i do n't follow the guy on twitter or anywhere else ) , chances are pretty high that he , like a lot of other public figures viewed the illegal border crossing as something positive . 
  whether he actually believed that is something only he knows . 
  pretty absurd logic coming from the germans . 
  september 2015 : `` no , you ca n't build a fence !, 
  fuck you , eastern europe , you uncivilized wasteland ! '',
