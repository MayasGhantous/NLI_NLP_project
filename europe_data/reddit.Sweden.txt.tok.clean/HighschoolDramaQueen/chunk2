  fun fact : horunge is also used in printing for words that are excessive and left alone on a line of their own . 
  [ the last line on page 2 is one , for example ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/orphan-typesetting.png ) . 
  it 's not used anymore of obvious reasons . 
  i learned that from an old printer that used to work with me . 
  agree . 
  i love david cages games but they always have someone that obviously is n't native english speaker and their accent always break off the rhythm in the game . 
  i do n't mind non-native english speakers talking english in games but it just gets weird with a game that is supposed to take place in nowhere , usa , and someone sounds like they just arrived from french tv . 
  subtitles . 
  they only dub kids movies here . 
  horunge = child of a whore , basically .

  of course , none of us are . 
  or sweden would be the aryan paradise it should have been all along . 
  :d ( / s just in case ), 
  not to mention the whole `` blonde and blue-eyed '' thing . 
  it 's the single stereotype i hate over all else . 
  people can jammer on about shakira law and velour dads all they want but the whole `` you people all look like people should ! '', 
  drives me up the wall . 
  pretty prevalent , i would say . 
  at the nearest grocery store we have a small sample of brands . 
  not that many because it 's more aimed at the local neighborhood . 
  but we have some local brands ( lejonet & bj\u00f6rnen ) and international ( ben & jerry , haagen-dasz ) . 
  and that 's sort of the premium ice cream . 
  then we have the cheap ( but still good ) ice cream from brands like sia , triumf , gb . 
  so ... a lot , i guess . 
   custard ? 
  o_o frozen yogurt , gelato and sorbet are usually packed in the same cooler as ice cream but pretty well marked to differentiate them . 
  at least they are whenever i see them . 
  nothing . 
  i have heated floors so i never get cold feet unless i have the balcony open or a window . 
  in the winter i might put on socks because i 'm not a savage . 
  if they are helping then i would rather drown . 
  some of the american restaurants can be pretty good but my favorite is pizza , without a doubt . 
  hard to decide what some of my favorites ones are since i 've liked * a lot * of video games ( and i 'll probably still miss a lot ) but here goes a short list : * the elder scrolls v : skyrim * fallout 4 * elite : dangerous * no man 's sky * minecraft * killzone : shadows fall * ni no kuni * valkyria chronicles * demon 's souls * final fantasy ix ... and the list could go on for a long time so for the sake of brevity i 'll stop here . 
  haha . 
  sounds ... fascinating . 
  ouch . 
  yeah , talking about throwing money away . 
  do they throw them or something ? 
  i * love * british coins . 
  they have so much heft to them , more than our coins . 
  i used to have a small collection of foreign coins ( and some bills ) and my favorites , all categories , are the british coins . 
  s\u00f6tn\u00f6t is far superior to s\u00f6tnos , imho . 
  my parents had 3 children and i 'm not considering having any children at all . 
  childbearing does n't sound like my sort of thing . 
  some . 
  the upcoming nato exercise is pulling out all the weirdos from the shadows . 
  luckily , not that much of their weirdness get into the mainstream news . 
  the populist right have their official newsorgans that nobody other than racists seems to care about and the left is , as always , shouting into a void . 
  none that i know off . 
  people might have preconceived ideas of what men and women drink but i rarely see anything advertised as `` for the ladies '' or `` for the men '' . 
  sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord and ombudsman have been internationally co-opted . 
  at least i would n't consider them english words but pretty uniquely swedish . 
  do n't know about antiquity but people are still pulling off pre-christian fertility rites over here . 
   [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpihezbd4hq ), 
  i mean , if aryan means blonde and blue eyed , it 's not really that common . 
  it might have been at some point in the distant past but really , it 's not like swedes are the embodiment of the nazi ideal anymore . 
  agree . 
  i 'm surprised by we have any international clout considering the trainwreck that is masquerading as our domestic movie scene . 
  no , there is not nearly enough school shootings to warrant a drill like that . 
  as someone that likes horror there are sadly few alternatives but l\u00e5t den r\u00e4tte komma in is probably one of the best swedish movies ever . 
  ok , now i know 2 . :p, 
  one of the few positive ones ( that i know of ) [ stockholm ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxcga1xtqyq ) by pugh rogefeldt, 
  o_o wow . 
  i 'm mixed race so i get that a lot . 
  i 'm dark haired and while i do n't look that asian , people still think i look a bit off . 
  i still get the occasional people that starts to talk english with me when i 'm in smalltowns . 
  ouch . 
  : / yeah , that sucks . 
  if the state would stop collecting taxes and just put up a gofundme , the state would collapse . 
  we would basically become an advanced third world country , a glorified cyberpunk society notwithstanding . 
  people thinking you are all aryans simply because of where you are born . 
  the fact that people mistake porn for reality should be a wake-up call for a lot of people . 
  the cordial stranger . 
  like a reverse cowgirl but with awkward conversation about the weather . 
  yeah , but considering the sheer amount of spanish speakers , would n't spanish have a larger footprint as secondary language to learn in school ? 
  because language is useful . 
  it 's easier to interface with the rest of the world on a friendly basis . 
  and the reversed could be asked : why is the us only hedging their bets on english ? 
  i thought by now that spanish would be pretty much the second language . 
  it 's starting to spread . 
  a co-worker of my brother is trying e-cigarettes as she is trying to quit smoking . 
  haha . 
  it 's not like he forced her to stay . 
  and i 'm sure mom would have phrased it exactly the same if they had met in japan . 
  sounds about right . 
  it 's pretty unevenly distributed here . 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's a lot denser in the south of the country . 
  i 'm born in europe but my mom was born in japan . 
  she moved to europe in the mid 80s for work and got stuck here when she met dad . 
  sure , in the northern parts there are areas that are n't exactly densely packed . 
  lots of places like that . 
  according to [ the world bank ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/en.pop.dnst ) , sweden has a density of about 24 people per square kilometer . 
  there are lots of areas where you have nothing but forest for miles . 
  thanks . 
  it 's a place to start at least . 
  hehe . 
  yeah , the castles are pretty safe , all things considered .
