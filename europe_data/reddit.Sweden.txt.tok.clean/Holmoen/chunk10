  immigrants are extremely over-represented in crime here . 
  affluent economic migrants from other highly developed countries are the only immigrants who decrease crime . 
  here 's one for rape before they stopped recording this data : http://i.imgur.com/ijonf5y.png in short : immigrants managed 77 % of rape cases while only being 14 % of the population . 
  that 's true . 
  but not only last decade . 
  it 's been major since the balkan wars 27 years ago . 
  but yes , the u.s. has had major immigration for the past 270 years , 
  we took in more iraqis than the u.s. , not per capita , but ** net ** , as a result of your invasion . 
  a country of 10 mil took in more than a country of over 300 mil . 
  also : https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2014/dec/02/sweden-oecds-highest-per-capita-asylum-seekers-syria we also give more than twice as much money in aid to poor countries per capita than the u.s. does . 
  it 's actually easier to immigrate to sweden than to the u.s. edit : and 14 % of our population is foreign-born . 
  there are plenty of countries where that number is more like 1.4 % , so calling us one of the most homogeneous countries in the world is simply untrue . 
  edit 2 : we 're also not officially in nato , and up until the 90s our armed forces were very capable . 
  shieeeeeeeeeee t, 
  that 's how tove jansson herself spoke , 
  well , each of the episodes in that compilation aired here . 
  i 've seen one of the un-aired ones and that one was not removed because of creepiness . 
  it was just violent and did n't feel very moomin-like to me . 
  and in this american dub she 's all quiet . 
  the noise she makes is really creepy . 
  listen to this shit : https://youtu.be/1qerwm-v1cq?t=162 edit : also , she 's a metaphor for loneliness : /, 
  makes me wonder how on earth the local mood can be toxic when the place looks like it does , has the weather it does , and is neither poor nor at war , or even close to . 
  milo yiannopoulos as well . 
  they already are . . you guys shitting on u.k. in here are pathetic . 
  i sure could . 
  hard for me to gauge that from reading the quote , though . 
  the quote mentions literally nothing about innovative potential . 
  not even a hint . 
  i still think it 's bullshit . 
  south korea and japan are leading innovators in the world with europe and the u.s , and they are extremely closed compared to europe . 
  edit : i literally just stumbled upon this : https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-17/sweden-gains-south-korea-reigns-as-world-s-most-innovative-economies, 
  haha , reading their wiki i come across this :  on 3 june 2016 , petry tweeted in mockery of german finance minister wolfgang sch\u00e4uble ; `` sch\u00e4uble 's nightmare : the ` incestuous ' icelanders in the quarter-final . 
  '' [ 14 ] iceland 's football team had made it to the uefa euro 2016 quarter-final and ** sch\u00e4uble had made a remark in june that if europe were to isolate itself , this would cause europe to degenerate into inbreeding . 
  [ 15 ] [ 16 ] ** i ca n't even fathom how someone can say this who is n't literally close to mentally retarded in the clinical sense . 
  well to be honest i too rarely actually read the articles , but this just sounded like complete bullshit . 
  usually one of the five or so top level comments will call out the clickbait title . 
  not this time for some reason . 
  if you read the article it 's * extremely * tame . 
  it 's * one * woman who had a rude coworker . . 
  i never got to do anything nearly as smart as that in history class . 
  the relevant part of russia is in europe . 
  finnish police are among the best in europe ( and the world ) afaik . 
  no , it 's literally rush hour in the streets . 
  i personally have no idea . 
  i meant generally . 
  why northern europe is so successful in general . 
  for some reason i thought you did :d, 
  that goes for all of northern europe with the exception of belgium . 
  i would personally love a scandinavian or nordic federation . 
  the sentiment seems to be the same over at / r/sweden . 
  edit : i do n't agree with `` do n't really have close links to the heart of europe , perhaps with the exception of denmark . '', 
  we share tremendous history and culture with germany in particular . 
  maybe not so much for norway , but definitely sweden . 
  more swedes spoke german than english up until pretty recently ( like 1980s ) . 
  also , this : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thirty_years%27_war, 
  how does the uk voting system work ? 
  it 's population voted to join sweden since they 're ethnically , culturally , and linguistically swedish . 
  they did n't get to decide , though . 
  the league of nations did . 
  sweden and finland both agreed to let the league of nations decide , and they ruled in favor of finland since \u00c5land is geographically more finnish than swedish . 
  correct grammar would be `` portugal-sko '' since portugal is a name . 
   the fact that all of the camps were operated by german nazis and that the countries in which the camps were located were occupied at the time is obvious to anyone in germany it 's obvious to anyone with some ( imo ) pretty basic historical knowledge . 
  balkan is n't eastern europe . 
  it 's either balkan , southern europe , or south-eastern europe . 
  i * think * `` eastern europe '' stops with hungary and romania . 
  most drugs are like that . 
  you do n't feel cold on stimulants either . 
  but opiates gives a warmth . 
  the heroin feels extra good when it stops you from freezing . 
  speaking from experience . 
  lots of german anger over great britain declaring war on them in ww1 . 
  you could start at the very top there and then head straight to the coast and hit e4 , then after stockholm head west for gothenburg and hit the e45  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_route_e4#/media/file:e4_route.jpg, 
  just do n't start at the top . 
  the vast majority of that stretch of road in sweden is just villages and small towns . 
  nothing to see or experience . 
  no , i do n't think so . 
  it 'd drag copenhagen down . 
  sweden showing who the big brother of the nordics is , once again , 
  while a common name in sweden , gertrud is a german name . 
  it 's not nordic . 
  i mean in general . 
  these guys are definitely exhausted , 
  this sleeping position : probably exhausted . 
  my bad on the estimate/know of . 
  the rest i do realize , and two arrests is still way too low and a sign that the system is n't dealing with this correctly . 
  the system is clearly fucked in sweden as s\u00c4po just ~ ~ said they know of ~ ~ estimate there are * thousands * of jihadis in sweden . 
  fucked in germany as well . 
  they should see similar numbers to france . 
  i pronounce it like `` tanger '' . 
  silent ` i ', 
  so one of the sources ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_length_of_coastline#list ) has our coastline at 3200 km while the other has it at 26 000 km . 
  like , in what universe is germany 's coastline even remotely close to as long as ours ? 
  ours looks 3-4 times as long looking at a map . 
  and denmark longer coast than us ? 
  they got ta be kidding . 
  on the coast to area ratio-map it has sweden at < 10 % , while we 're clearly about 50 % coast : s. edit : the one source has it at 7 % and the other at 64 % ... is the east coast of sweden not a coast by some measure ? 
  since women tend to be < 180 cm many of them probably do n't even know that that 's what happens to legs if they have no support . 
  oh my god , fuck you . 
  i 'm 203 cm so my legs naturally fall out like that since they have no support . 
  only way i do n't spread out without sitting and actively holding my legs together ( ultimately tensing up the groin ) is by sitting cross legged .
