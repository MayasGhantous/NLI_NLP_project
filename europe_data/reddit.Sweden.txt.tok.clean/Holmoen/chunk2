  my butthole is ready . 
  ready and willing . 
  fuck that noise . 
  out of 362 119 there 's bound to be at least one , 
  she saw we ( the swedes ) have sweet hats and thought to herself `` that is all fine and dandy but what about your fucked up education system , sweden . '', 
  and everything in sweden and finland is `` almost the same '' . 
  christ , we 're family . 
  you mean swedish planes maintained by hungarians ? 
  because swedish planes maintained by swedes do n't seem to have this problem . 
  \u00d6 = island .

  that was fucking draining . 
  and i have no idea if that word is even legit . 
  i 'm always fucking infuriated when people call sweden the rape capital of the world . 
  it makes no fucking sense at all . 
  thank you for something straightforward to direct them to . 
  two years is pretty optimistic . 
  i 'm 98th % swedish . 
  y' all need cornelis .

  i once had a boat . 
  education and immigration . 
  i just pointed out the irony in this particular instance . 
  that does n't mean i oppose russians or any other ethnic group from the former soviet republic for that matter . 
  which i do n't . 
  i really wish we did n't squabble and wage war with each other in this world , and one way i 'd do that is to not proudly wave the flag of the ussr which did sooo much shit in this world . 
  and waving it in the us just feels provocative . 
  if he 's russian he should 've only used russias flag in my opinion . 
  being proud over defeating nazi germany is not wrong . 
  i understand that it might 've been for fun . 
  the irony is several , but mostly : german * luxury * car bought in the united states in usd with a flag of a communist republic on the hood . 
  do i have to explain why that is ironic ? 
  yeahhh , let 's put a flag of the ussr on the hood of my fucking 100k usd mercedes-benz because that 's not ironic . 
  probably not . 
  they are n't known for killing people over ridiculous shit . 
  it was supposed to be basic . 
  no one will look worse in it than they would in the typical russian bowl cut . 
  it also works if you 're 15 and if you 're 55 . 
  more advanced hairstyles are in my opinion much harsher on an unattractive person or just a person with the wrong skull and/or hairline . 
  do you dislike the haircut ? 
  if you want something easy : http://www.mens-hairstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/best-mens-short-hair-2013.jpg, 
  i once had to explain to a 18 year old girl that meat was muscle tissue . . 
  i do n't agree with him either but i 'll upvote him so the comment gets to +1 because people downvoting and effectively silencing opinions that differ from their own * really * fucking bothers me . 
  i have one of these : http://www.danegarden.com/1016581_10151466808570658_1457316474_n.jpg weighs about twice as much as a gray wolf :p, 
  where the fuck do you live ? 
  the 17th century ? 
  i 'm sure this kid will not live a regular kid 's life from now on , he just wo n't spend his time in prison like an adult . 
  sounds not just a little bit too bad to be true . 
  i honestly just wanted to be informative to others that might wonder what the other guy meant . 
  i just called it misleading , which it is . 
  i 'd personally call it that ( nobel prize in econ ) , but it 's still misleading . 
  calling it nobel prize in economics is misleading . 
  the prize was established in 1968 by sveriges riksbank . 
  to be fair i think we have something like 120 leopard 2 . 
  you and your family can up and move to any of the other nordic countries ... and the only things that would be different for you than the natives is that you ca n't be a politician , a police officer , or join the military . 
  i find the thought of emigrating to denmark and more specifically copenhagen to be quite alluring . 
  edit : not because of our taxes or immigration policies , but because finding an apartment in stockholm ( i have a big city-boner ) is pretty tough and i love danes and their language . 
  it 's 1 degrees outside my window . 
  it snowed a lot yesterday . 
  you probably have a summer that is one month longer than mine with summer nights that is n't chilly and sunny . 
  which they are here . 
  probably denmark because cultural , historical , and linguistic brothers and the best climate of sca . 
  by best i mean best for crops . 
  mostly . 
  i thought there would be waay more sites in italy and greece . 
  they do it out of ignorance , i 'd wager . 
  haha , aw < 3, 
  oh , my bad . 
  you are correct . 
  we call you nederl\u00e4nderna . 
  dude , he 's from scotland , not california . 
  he probably knows that vienna is the capital of austria . 
  he even visited the place . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ part ^ ^ ^ ^ about ^ ^ ^ ^ my ^ ^ ^ ^ dear ^ ^ ^ ^ american ^ ^ ^ ^ friends ^ ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ ^ me ^ ^ ^ ^ teasing, 
  yes !, 
  `` tjeckien '' tjecking in . 
  the jews have a problem . 
  it 's the same problem regular swedes have , only amplified . 
  largest financial centre in the world , actually . 
  how nice neighbours . 
  this gives me hope . 
  streets can be pretty damn small . 
  my street is basically 100 metres squared . 
  but it 's still a `` zone '' , since there is no definition for how big a zone is . 
  just think of how large cities like london or paris are . 
  there are probably hundreds of streets that are unsafe if we just take those two . 
  it by zone they mean street then 900 is definitely believable . 
  rekt, 
  the biggest reason for the rise of sd is precisely because the established parties were `` luvvy-duvvy '' to a fault , while being extremely disrespectful to sd and the big amount of swedes with legitimate concerns about our immigration policies , policies which were never talked about in an honest and open matter . 
  so , fuck them . 
  i hope sd wins big enough 2018 to get majority in the riksdag . 
  they have been an industrial and economic powerhouse since what , the dawn of the industrial age ? 
  it makes no sense that french workers would be lazy . 
  yeah , i 'm pretty sure ww1 completely smashed about every fucking record for anything related to war before it . 
  it 's still winter here . 
  i ca n't fucking wait to move 1500 km south for university this fall . 
  i know it 's a story . 
  that link was practically unusable , anyone have a better source for this ? 
  or too naive . 
  rolls royce has always been excellent .
