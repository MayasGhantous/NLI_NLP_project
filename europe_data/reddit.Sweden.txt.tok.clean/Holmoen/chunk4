  the wiki page shows no maps ; i want maps . 
  relaying what another redditor said : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/444lay/israeli_bulldozers_demolish_eufunded_buildings/cznky46 so it would seem this is in fact not palestinian land at all ? 
   people like you are one of the reasons people like me have no confidence in governments , law , justice , integrity , or principles in leaders . 
  what i do n't get about people like this is if things are this fucking bad , why does life in the west ( and the rest of the world ) consistently improve for every decade ? 
  everybody know there 's corruption and injustice in the world , but it 's not * everywhere . 
  it might be from people watching american film and tv . 
  there 's often stuff like that , the criminals do this or that to get immunity from this or that . 
  but i guess the difference is that this is after the fact that they have evidence against what the criminal has done . 
  you ca n't `` strike a deal '' with a swedish prosecutor . 
  get a more lenient punishment for ratting out your buddies and such . 
   on 26 november 2010 the prosecutor issued a european arrest warrant ( eaw ) . 
  this eaw is certified by the uk serious crime agency on 6 december 2010 . 
  i love shit like this . 
  i like the taste , it 's just way too much of it for me . 
  i still prefer 10 % the amount of almond cream to no amount of almond cream . 
  yeah , i think you 're right . 
  secular jews are among the most progressive of religious groups . 
  thanks , but i 'm too fucking lazy to read all that to find out if actual jews think this is a good idea ? 
  religious shit can be so fucking sensitive , so i do n't know . 
  i usually take out 90 % of the almond cream . 
  i think it 's far too sweet and far too much . 
  would it be ok if i wore a kippah in solidarity with jewish people as a `` fuck you '' to all the anti-semitic people in my country or would that be offensive to jews ? 
  i know non-jewish men should still wear a kippah if they are in a synagogue , as to not show the head to god . 
  this has crossed my mind before , so i might as well ask . 
  it 's `` fat tuesday '' here , though . 
  https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/fettisdagen semlor are delicious , btw . 
  you do n't have to add any cardamom , either . 
  you can skip the almond cream , too . 
  basically , i love whipped cream with sweet bread . 
  `` apparently '' can also mean `` right now/now '' . 
  my dictionary lists that meaning as archaic . 
  so ,  who will need social services apparently could mean :  who will need social services now how different punctuation would change that meaning i have no idea . 
  it 's ok  . 
  realizing when one is wrong and owning up to that is something that i respect , and something that is all too rare . 
  nobody * wants * to be wrong but we 're all wrong from time to time . 
  and we 're all here to learn . 
  well , i said `` probably '' . 
  it was n't some definitive statement . 
  i actually googled before my first comment and noticed that we started with skogsv\u00e5rdsstyrelser in 1905 , so you 're probably right . 
  if i was on speaking terms with my father i could 've asked him . 
  he 's a j\u00e4gm\u00e4stare who worked at skogsstyrelsen for 15 years . 
  that 's probably around the time when concerted efforts to replant the forest begun . 
  edit : seems this started way earlier , in 1905 . 
  he 's also wrong . 
  this source says that about 90 % of wood products sold in europe comes from europe : http://ec.europa.eu/environment/industry/retail/pdf/timber.pdf the number is probably the same for north america . 
  they also have a shit ton of forest . 
  how edgy you are . 
  that makes no sense . 
  there 's * plenty * of timber for europe in sweden , finland , and russia . 
  this source says that about 90 % of wood products sold in europe comes from europe : http://ec.europa.eu/environment/industry/retail/pdf/timber.pdf likely the same for the u.s ( as in , they get their timber from north america ) . 
  there 's ridiculous amounts of forest in north america . 
  in sweden and finland , * not * being nude in the sauna is almost taboo . 
  i 'm pretty sure it used to be , but i do n't think it really is nowadays . 
  at my gym i 'd still say 90 % go nude . 
  there meaning sweden . 
  [ fuck yes , casablanca ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm-e2h1chjm ), 
  i always see ddr in english . 
  so , 17 times as costly . 
  yeah , they did n't fuck around . 
  except it would be ten times as costly . 
  * at least . 
  i 'd rather head south , to be honest . 
  i 'll see with the chieftain . 
  dude , good idea . 
  it 's time to bring hedonism to constantinople . 
  fuck that `` islam '' and `` christianity '' fad . 
  it wo n't last . 
  yeah , we 'll just rape and pillage normandy and afterwards we could head north for london . 
  the raid on friday is on schedule . 
  we 're aiming for normandy . 
  that 's my middle name :  vikings , rise up !, 
  true . 
  i live in the north ( lule\u00e5 ) , and -20 is normal for about a months time . 
  i 'd say -15 is average for the coldest 30 day time span . 
  we had -1 just a few days ago . 
  that 's warm for january . 
  as someone else said , inland it gets colder . 
  but nobody lives there . 
  i read up on the [ conviction rate in japan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/criminal_justice_system_of_japan#conviction_rate ) and found this :  j. 
  mark ramseyer of harvard law school and eric b. rasmusen of indiana university examine if the accusation is in fact warranted . 
  in their paper ( `` why is the japanese conviction rate so high ? '' ), 
  they examined two possibilities . 
  one is that judges who come under the control of central bureaucracy are pressured to pass a guilty verdict , ensuring high conviction . 
  another possibility is that , given that the non-jury system under inquisition system has predictable ruling on guilt , japan 's understaffed prosecutors working on low budgets only bring the most obviously guilty defendants to trial , and do not file indictments in cases in which they are not certain they can win . 
  the optimist in me want to say that it 's mostly the latter reason presented , but the realist in me also knows that japanese culture regarding crime is wholly different to what it is in europe and north america . 
  they are in general much more law ( and rule ! ), 
  abiding , and view criminals much more harshly than we do . 
  since these truly educated men presented two reasons then the truth might lie somewhere in the middle , so to say . 
  or it might just be either or . 
  i found this quote in your link to the washington post , which made me really happy :  it 's preferable to release someone wrongfully , than convict someone wrongfully , '' shen deyong , the executive vice-president of the supreme people 's court , wrote last year in the people 's court daily . 
  `` if a true criminal is released , heaven will not collapse , but if an unlucky citizen is wrongfully convicted , heaven will fall . '' even if this might be hogwash propaganda ( since they do exactly the opposite of this ) just to calm the populace , the optimist in me says that just the fact that such a high ranking ( i assume party member ) said this publicly is a step in the right direction . 
  i have always been of the opinion that i 'd rather have ten guilty men go free than one innocent man be found guilty . 
   the criminal procedure law was revised to incorporate an important new provision , stating that nobody shall be declared guilty without being judged as such by a court according to the law . 
  i assume that the only thing that means is that even if i tell the prosecutor that i 'm guilty , a judge still has to decide if that 's actually true or not ( of course , this is a good thing ! ) . 
  i actually read up a bit on rule of law in china before i posted my first comment ( as to not be incorrect ) and i found this , which is relevant to what i found : https://www.quora.com/in-the-chinese-legal-system-is-there-a-presumption-of-guilt-why-is-it-more-difficult-to-defend-against-criminal-allegations-in-a-chinese-court  in china , there is no such thing as a `` guilty plea '' so there is always a trial . 
  as far as establishing guilt or innocence , trials in china are a formality . 
  the important things that happen are in pre-trial . 
  there is an investigation and some negotiation with the defense lawyer . 
  if it appears likely that the charges will not hold , then the authorities will drop or reduce the charges before the trial happens ( and an example of this happening is with ai weiwei ) . 
  if the authorities decide to push the case to trial , they its almost certain that they will get a conviction .
