  however , , the important thing that happens at the trial is that the judge decides what the penalty will be . 
  we have a famous case in sweden regarding a man ( now known to be mentally ill ) who confessed to several murders and was found guilty ( in a court of law , not through a plea bargain , which is something we do n't make us of ) even though there were no witnesses or technical evidence . 
  my take is that before 1996 and if he was in china , there would n't even be a trial . 
  but as you can see from my linked paragraph he would almost certainly be found guilty after a swift trial anyway . 
  the man was later found not guilty and exonerated in 2013 , and after that there have been a lot of investigations regarding similar cases as to make sure that shit does n't happen or have happened before . 
  he was a violent criminal , though . 
  he is guilty of both robbery and attempted manslaugter . 
  lastly , i just want to say that i do n't have an education in jurisprudence , i 'm merely interested in it . 
  i might very well be wrong in my assumptions . 
  china does n't even have [ presumption of innocence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/presumption_of_innocence ) , which is a key article in the universal declaration of human rights . 
  so my personal investigation says that rule of law in china is fucked up . 
  edit : reading some more , you do n't have the right to an attorney present at your first interrogation , and you do n't have a right to remain silent . 
  that was a major difference , but not really relevant . 
  here 's copenhagen and stockholm ( actually comparable cities ) : http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=sweden&amp;country2=denmark&amp;city1=stockholm&amp;city2=copenhagen&amp;tracking=getdispatchcomparison, 
  true . 
  i notice that denmark is roughly 500 higher than us while we have similar everything ( cost of living and all that ) : s, 
  i thought it was higher ( around 2500 ) . 
  ~ ~ almost all of eastern european countries . ~ ~ ~ ~ 1900 is a low income around here . ~ ~, 
  asians like to give us europeans shit for not respecting and appreciating our elders . 
  well . 
  it 's similar for gay people . 
  they do n't feel safe anymore . 
  we 're figuratively going backwards . 
  makes me sad . 
  and angry . 
  i never said it was n't . 
  crime ! = corruption . 
  yes , it is . 
  it 's hyperbole and fear mongering . 
  and what is that `` so ? '' . 
  i literally do n't have the energy to solve the worlds problems when i ca n't even solve my own . 
  i am convinced that a coup would only make things worse . 
  * substantially * worse . 
  that 's why our current low levels of corruption is relevant . 
  thank you < 3 . 
  i have come to terms with the fact that my life will never be `` perfect '' and full of joy . 
  i do n't work like that . 
  i 've been depressed since i was 12 years old ( 24 currently ) . 
  [ video that tells it how it is for me ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xicrnilqgyc ) but that was an inspiring and wise thing of you to say  . 
  i shall contemplate it . 
  have a nice day !, 
  what do you mean ? 
  the story of your times ? 
  i 'm clinically depressed and ca n't even manage my own life . 
  i 'm not equipped to take a stand at this moment in time . 
  i 'm neither ignorant nor naive , but i am ( somewhat ) apathetic . 
  and i do n't agree that i 'm part of the problem . 
  sweden is among the least corrupt nations in the world . 
  we do absolutely * not * need a coup . 
  if , and that 's if , i would vote for pp it would not be a left/right vote . 
  it would strictly be for their stance on integrity and security online . 
  which is getting ever more important . 
  * if * , and that 's if , i would vote for pp it would not be a left/right vote . 
  it would strictly be for their stance on integrity and security online . 
  which is getting ever more important . 
  i do not know . 
  it 's not unlikely . 
  i 'd almost certainly vote for either sd or the pirate party . 
  edit : really , i do n't know how i 'd vote . 
  i have n't put much thought and energy into it yet . 
  i meant it when i said that i actively avoid swedish politics , so i 'm not the most well read about it . 
  nope . 
  yeah . . 
  i actually strongly believe in giving people a second chance , but in this case ? 
  he would just lose his post as ~ ~ chief of police ~ ~ actually not chief of police of stockholm , just a part of stockholm , he would still have a job in the police force . 
  and i wonder , since he did this : what else has he done ? 
  hopefully we can both agree that withholding crucial information like that is gross incompetence/negligence at the very least and should be grounds for resignation . 
  the rest of that comment of mine is just my melodramatic thoughts . 
  what the ** fuck ** . 
  police should be impartial regarding politics . 
  this incompetent tool should resign or be fired . 
  if he does n't lose his post after that statement i guess i 'll lose even more hope in our country and it 's citizens , which i know is a defeatist attitude , but i just do n't have the fight in me . 
  i actively avoid swedish politics because it makes me depressed . 
  i actually believe it will all work out in the end but when that is i do n't know . 
  probably later rather than sooner . 
  not to mention that sweden has a much larger economy and an advanced and healthy arms industry . 
  we could supply finland with plenty of high tech arms at subsidized prices or for free in the event of war . 
  edit : and like 4000 [ bandvagn 206 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bandvagn_206 ) which would probably be lent for free . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/duty_to_rescue also :  in the united states , as of 2009 ten states had laws on the books requiring that people at least notify law enforcement of and/or seek aid for strangers in peril under certain conditions : california , [ 10 ] [ 11 ] florida , [ 10 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] hawaii , [ 10 ] [ 14 ] massachusetts , [ 10 ] [ 15 ] minnesota , [ 10 ] [ 16 ] ohio , [ 10 ] [ 17 ] rhode island , [ 10 ] [ 18 ] vermont , [ 10 ] [ 19 ] washington , [ 10 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] and wisconsin . 
  [ 10 ] [ 22 ] so there 's like a 20 % ? 
  chance you live where you could be held liable for inaction . 
  but he probably meant morally . 
  related is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/good_samaritan_law, 
  political correctness is a cancer no matter what your political views may be . 
  it has reached very dangerous levels in sweden and germany . 
  it has to stop . 
  one thing i take from this is that `` that '' is literally `` dat '' in dutch . 
  i think it 's pretty well established that the red star is a symbol of communism . 
  that was hardly a red star , even . 
  it had a red edge . 
  and the swastika can be used for other things than nazi germany , but today it means nazi germany in 99 % of cases . 
  you 're welcome . 
  it 's * pique * , my friend . 
  wow , they even have a red star on their flag/emblem . 
  props for honesty , i guess ? 
  iirc it says it weighs as much as 40 buffalo . 
  sweden as well . 
  edit : on christmas eve , actually . 
  fuck him and fuck banning shit on campuses . 
  there have been 27 wars fought between denmark and sweden .
