  ok , now i get it . 
  apparently you could use `` clay '' like we use `` soil '' or `` land '' . 
  but it 's an old use of the word and i have never come across it before . 
  so the joke is that swedish soil is russian soil , just like crimea is russian soil . 
  what does `` sweden is russia clay '' mean ? 
  to reach a bmi of 15 , at an average supermodel height of 178 cm , you 'd have to weigh ** 48 kg ** . 
  i do n't know what that looks like but i 'm pretty sure a baby can tell you 're ill at that point . 
  my friend has a bmi of 19 and he 's skinny as fuck . 
  how risk can increase as soon as you go below 20 i can not for the life of me understand . 
  lot 's of very healthy individuals have a bmi lower than 20 . 
  something is up with wikipedia . 
  this is what you 'll see on russia 's page : http://i.imgur.com/igjaufn.png while on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( nominal ) every organization ranks russia 's gdp to be 1.8 trillion to 2 trillion . 
  i 'm too lazy to go through the sources as i 'm sure this will soon be fixed . 
  i just found it interesting . 
  yes , i 'm sure there 's several ways to improve europe . 
  i 'm not really knowledgeable enough on the issue to say much more than that a less integrated europe is a europe worse off . 
  i do n't think you have to worry . 
  a work visa should n't be difficult , and becoming a citizen is easy . 
  i do n't even know if you 'd need a work visa at all , i 'm sure you can google answers to all your questions . 
  as an example , norway is not in the eu at all but the only thing really different for a norwegian compared to a swede in sweden is that they ca n't join the army , the police force , or become a politician . 
  no , as far as i know the damage lies in that they disrupt aquatic ecosystems . 
  yes , which is not great for our rivers . 
  we already ca n't fish in the baltic because it 's much too polluted . 
  i agree with you , i doubt there will be any winners if britain leaves . 
  i believe the eu should improve , not dissolve . 
  edit : russia might win . 
  russia wants a weaker eu . 
  it wo n't be the same if britain leaves . 
  the eu would lose legitimacy . 
  britain is like 20 % of europe . 
  hmm . 
  no clear answer . 
  `` the norwegian nobel committee speculates that nobel may have considered norway better suited to awarding the prize , as it did not have the same militaristic traditions as sweden . '', 
  i mean , what country * did n't * have a militaristic culture/traditions in the 19th century . 
  sweden was just better at it than norway . 
  i 'd assume that it 's just as likely that he wanted norway to award one of the prizes simply * because * the two nations were in a union . 
  http://i.imgur.com/jwr9ooq.gif especially since idiots like these have successfully hampered and continue to hamper swedish nuclear power . 
   nobel peace price the norwegian nobel price . 
  norway !, 
  the title does n't say '' * european physicists * discover '' . 
  you need to learn your english . 
  and this is a map of the countries that payed for cern : https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/cern#/media/file:cern_members.svg cern it also located * in * europe . 
  so this discovery happened * in * europe . 
  yeah , * in * europe . 
  it 's in your god damned title . 
  this thread is such a good example of how great is is when people from different backgrounds can talk intelligently with each other . 
  i think there would be * far * less conflict and misery in the world if everyone spoke the same language . 
  you 'd literally have to be several hundred years old for that . 
  am i wrong that when i think far-right i think libertarian ? 
  i ca n't believe you 've done this . 
  good . 
  he 's not above the law . 
  glonass is actually really good . 
  halland is a swedish province . 
  you should post this in / r/dataisbeautiful . 
  money trees is the perfect place for shade and that 's just how they feel . 
  he is so fucking dumb . 
  i 'm actually ashamed . 
  glad i did n't even consider giving him my vote . 
  yes , i meant wholly secular and fact based religious teaching . 
  in sweden it 's very much like history class but focused specifically on religion . 
  considering how important religion is in the world `` opting out '' of learning about it in school is fucked up . 
  finland knows that the planes coming from russia are russian , and they know * why * they act as they do . 
  edit : also , finland would stand to gain very little but lose a lot by shooting down a russian jet because it happened to be in finnish airspace for a short while . 
  russia is finland 's most important trade partner after sweden iirc . 
  if , however , there was a raging civil war going on just kilometers from the finnish/russian border and an unidentified jet who is n't responding to warnings crossed into finnish airspace it would almost without a doubt be shot down before it could be of any threat to finnish lives . 
  and lastly , there 's this gallup poll : https://i.imgur.com/pyqklui.png believe me , those 74 % of finns imagined fighting one entity : russia . 
   the 39 businessmen , who had been attending an agricultural industry conference in the southern russian region of krasnodar , were arrested on thursday afternoon for entering the country without business visas . 
   `` turkish citizens require a visa to enter the russian federation to engage in business activities or for commercial reasons , and the citizens in this case entered russia for commercial purposes , '' vartanter-saarkyan , the deputy head of the krasnodar region migration service , told a local television station . 
  i actually laughed out loud just now . 
  most of the time an article like this would make me sad but now i 'm just laughing . 
  consent lessons , motherfucker !, 
  his stupid fucking sign and facial expression does n't help . 
  he pretty much proved he 's just another idiot by claiming that rapists looks a certain way . 
  but he 's also 19 , i guess . 
  edit : the `` consent lessons , motherfucker ! '', 
  was sarcastic , and by `` just * another * idiot '' i meant that the people harassing him were idiots . 
  maybe the people who did n't get this are too . 
   malm\u00f8 is it already lost ? 
  take this with a grain of salt . 
  or maybe a jar of salt . 
  shenghen sounds chinese . 
  it was n't even freely translated . 
  she literally said that costs does n't matter . 
  i closed the video after the first 10-15 seconds and i heard her say this . 
  edit : hearing her say this is why i closed the video . 
  of course  . 
  he recently made a pretty good song , it 's called `` ta mig tillbaka '' - take me back . 
  singing about his childhood ; riding his bike `` crooning to billie jean '' . 
  in flames . 
  ca n't stand that guy . 
  `` schwedentrunk '' `` the schwedentrunk ( english : swedish drink ) is a method of torture and execution . 
  the name was invented by german victims of swedish troops during the thirty years ' war . 
  they lay the bound servant on the ground , stuck a wooden wedge into his mouth , and poured into his belly a bucket full of foul manure water , which they called a swedish drink . 
  though specific circumstances differed , in every case a restrained and gagged victim was forced to swallow ( by means of a funnel ) a large amount of unappetizing , sometimes boiling liquid . 
  substances such as urine , excrement , liquid manure , and sullage were used for this purpose . 
  apart from disgust , illness , and the possibility of bacterial infection , the schwedentrunk inflicted intense gastric pain . 
  because liquids are incompressible , the victim 's stomach and bowels must expand to painful proportions to accommodate the copious quantities of fluid . 
  the torturers then squeezed the distended belly with wooden boards or trampled the victim underfoot . '', 
  you forget that they have a highly educated populace and a very , very competent industrial sector .
