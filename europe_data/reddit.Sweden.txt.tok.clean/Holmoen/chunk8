  to me there 's just no way in hell that japan will end up in the shitter as soon as within 30 years . 
  an american is among the last one with any right to criticize another country for selling arms to dictatorships . 
  let 's just agree that it 's pretty shameful behavior from both of our countries . 
  edit : there 's also this said by our foreign minister : http://www.peacock-panache.com/2015/10/sweden-why-havent-we-heard-about-this-19634.html `` she also opined that swedish cooperation with the saudi military was unethical . 
  following her remarks , saudi arabia withdrew its ambassador to sweden . 
  it also stopped issuing visas to swedish businessmen . 
  the united arab emirates joined it . 
  the organisation of islamic co-operation , which represents 56 muslim-majority states , issued a statement accusing sweden of failing to respect the world 's ` rich and varied ethical standards , ' and the gulf co-operation council condemned her ` unacceptable interference in the internal affairs of the kingdom of saudi arabia . ', 
  what the fuck , bro ? 
  : / i 'm legitimately hurt over here . 
  finland . 
  or norway . 
  or denmark . 
  fuck it , i think we love them all . 
  at least i do . 
  well , she is extremely popular and well liked nonetheless  . 
  most sold album in the u.s. under 2014 and 6.8 million copies sold worldwide thus far . 
  and i love `` wildest dreams '' , and i agree that her voice is so-so . 
  she 's simply backed by absolutely top class production and promotion . 
  max martin is also behind many of britney spears ' biggest hits . 
  i bet you at least like her , 
  of course , i completely agree . 
  i did n't think of those as cultural but i guess they kind of are . 
  abba , ingmar bergman , max martin , minecraft . 
  if you do n't know , max martin is a music producer and songwriter . 
  he and another swede called shellback are behind every hit on taylor swift 's album `` 1989 '' , for a recent example . 
  i guess that 's what i meant , 
  we use commas separating numbers . 
  you too ? 
  i think ice hockey is the second sport in sweden with handball coming in third . 
  you 'd have to really look to find any measure of economic , social , or other measure where bulgaria or romania would beat finland . 
  i do n't know what you 're trying to say here . 
  do n't talk shit about my brothers . 
  that 's just ridiculous . 
  both my father and my mother grew up in wooden houses that are over 200 years old . 
  i would n't know . 
  you talking about how big bc is made me forget about the point of my original comment . 
  the point was that in * sweden * , houses are wooden , probably because of our overabundance of forest . 
  i do n't think i 've ever been in a brick or concrete house . 
  edit : but i live in northern sweden , southern sweden has much , much less forest so maybe there is more brick or concrete houses there . 
  how is it possibly relevant how big sweden is compared to british columbia ? 
  compared to * europe * sweden is big . 
  what the fuck are you talking about ? 
  53 % of sweden is forest . 
  it says right in the wiki , the russian cruise missile ( if that 's the one you mean ) uses inertial guidance plus terminal active radar homing for guidance . 
  good luck on isis trying to defend themselves against these . 
  it 's pretty incredible . 
  the american `` minuteman '' icbm with a range of 13,000 km has an accuracy of 150 m , while the best russian icbm is at 100-250 m precision . 
  these up-to-2 ,500 km range cruise missiles seem to have an accuracy of 10 m for both the russian and american variants . 
  `` four warships of the caspian fleet were involved in the missile attacks , the gepard-class frigate dagestan and the buyan-m-class corvettes grad sviyazhsk , uglich and veliky ustyug . 
  they fired cruise missiles from the kalibr nk ( klub ) vls launchers . 
  the missiles used are capable of hitting a target within 3 meters at a range of up to 2,500 km . '', 
  nothing on wikipedia about it 's accuracy , though . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3m-54_klub it seems the american/british tomahawk cruise missile system ( which also has a max range of 2,500 km ) has an accuracy of 10 m. soviet icbm here from 1974 with a range of over 10.000 km has an accuracy of 200-700 m : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/r-36_ ( missile ) . 
  their modern one has an accuracy of 100-250 m. 
  here 's what it sounds like : https://translate.google.se/?hl=sv#auto/en/bl%c3%b6jor , 
  was just about to post a top level comment mentioning that most if not all swedish cities have either a king 's street and/or a queen 's street . 
  the english language have several words which produces the various sounds for \u00e5 , \u00e4 , and \u00f6 . 
  some examples : \u00e5 = the `` au '' part of the british pronunciation of `` audio '' \u00e4 = the `` a '' part of the american pronunciation of `` ass '' \u00f6 = the `` bu '' part of `` burn '' there 's probably hundreds of examples , these are just the ones my sleep deprived mind managed to procure at the moment . 
  i think part of why scandinavians ( and the dutch , also germanic ) are consistently ranked at the top for english proficiency is because they are both germanic languages and not that different at all . 
  learning english is pretty straightforward as most of the time english and all the scandinavian languages have the same sentence structure . 
  `` i love small boats but only if they smell like used diapers . '', 
  `` jag ( i ) \u00e4lskar ( love ) sm\u00e5 ( small ) b\u00e5tar ( boats ) men ( but ) bara ( only ) om ( if ) de ( they ) luktar ( smell ) som ( like ) anv\u00e4nda ( used ) bl\u00f6jor ( diapers ) . 
  precisely every word in in the same spot . 
  the differences in grammar is also much smaller than between the romance and germanic language families . 
  [ `` om du m\u00f6ter varg '' ( should you meet wolf ) by detektivbyr\u00e5n ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qslebzqios ), 
  hear , hear . 
  that 's actually exactly what i meant by `` hundreds of years of brotherhood '' . 
  see my edit , 
  yes , you 're right . 
  i live in northern sweden and my best friend is 25/75 finnish/swedish and that 's not uncommon . 
  yeah . 
  pretty much . 
  swedes , norwegians , and danes are the same people in my eyes , while swedes and finns are not ethnically ~ ~ connected ~ ~ ** the same ** we are connected through hundreds of years of brotherhood anyways . 
  i love all our neighbors . 
  edit : and iceland , of course . 
  they 're just so small , 
  the 20 's . 
  has a nice ring to it , do n't it ? 
  hopefully they turn out to be roaring . 
  i view them all as brothers and sisters . 
  the icelanders are also family , but the type of family that you never speak to or hear from because they are so far away . 
  i wonder why we 're clearly worse off than denmark . 
  similiar diet , culture , and health care system . 
   doubly so if they roleplay as happy merchants anytime i see this is get an unpleasant feeling . 
  catholics . 
  that explains it . 
  it 's like european isis fighters . 
  they are only european on paper . 
  maybe he was on a hoverboard ? 
  we 've always been the most powerful and influential of the nordic countries . 
  it 's envy . 
  yeah , that was even better . 
  edit : * way * better . 
  oh , i wish i had known about this years ago . 
  lizardpoint.com is a great site for learning geography . 
  i took the liberty of linking directly to the europe : countries-quiz : http://lizardpoint.com/geography/europe-quiz.php, 
  atrocities happen in every war , * genocide * does not . 
  why ca n't they just admit it ? 
  pretty much every powerful nation ever has committed genocide somewhere , sometime .
