  so , the information can be found really , but one just has to work around it a bit . 
  sigh , my computer screen goes crazy when i try to open some of the roma links and i have now officially lost my message to you , twice . 
  anyway , there are tons of reports on why the romas are not succeeding . 
  the best i can find is this 55 page report that summarizes the relevant academic studies done on the romas in sweden . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.valentin.uu.se/digitalassets/105/105340_forskningsoversikt-14-nov2.pdf ) .

  i guess there are to big for you , and that is understandable . 
  here are some `` normal articles '' .

  basically , the explanations are the same . 
  discrimination , low education , lack of networks , suspicion against the swedish culture , suspicion of schools , lack of understanding for the roma culture etc but , what no one touches upon , apart from in the last article , is why the romas are doing worse than similar groups . 
  i mean , it is not like the kurds have it better , yet they are doing better . 
  i 'd like to know that . 
  then please tell the fn-f\u00f6rbundet to stop generalising . 
  look at these numbers . 
  you ca n't attack stuff like that by talking about individuals . 
  how on earth then ? 
  a did n't go to school , b did n't go to school and c did n't go to school ? 
  are you saying that there is absolutely no connections between those numbers and roma culture ? 
  that it is all a big accident ? 
  the fun thing about the article you posted is that it was n't a ethnicity register . 
  it was n't mentioned . 
  it was a register for criminal group . 
  and how they were interrelated and how they interacted . 
  however , a huge amount of them were romas , but it was n't a roma register . 
  but , according to your `` feelings '' it is all due to discrimination , they are so much more victims than everyone else . 
  you know that article has just been debunked , right ? 
  again , odd that you know more than i do about romas in sweden and * without * facts . 
  you must be psychic . 
  frankly , we are old fashioned in sweden , we go for facts , which you again , have none . 
  you have `` feelings '' . 
  well i have told you you are wrong but apparently you know more than me about sweden ... . 
  well , your hunch is wrong . 
  so , say `` in my country i believe this , but i do not think that is the case in sweden '' . 
  i asked it as a question , it was not a statement . 
  you are swedish as well , can you explain to me why the romas are worse at fouling to school than other immigration groups , and worse at integration . 
  as an example i took kurds and eritreans who are much more likely to go to school , and finish it , than romas . 
  it is not like they have this super education ( like iranians might have ) nor are they a kidding discrimination . 
  yet , the romas are doing worse . 
  why ? 
  so , what you are saying is that in sweden romas are worse discriminated than eritreans and kurds . 
  but then you can see that poverty is not the main issue here . 
  how do i otherwise prove that to you ? 
  i think they are flawed to , i agree with you . 
  however i want less of it and that is where we differs . 
  however , that is not the point of this discussion i believe :-) , but the fact that i have to over , and over again point out that it is flawed . 
  i understand if you disagree with me how it should go forward , but i am tired of explaining where we are and some of the mechanisms behind . 
  i will post links to when i get home how much an average welfare person receives in sweden/month . 
  then come and tell me it is poverty . 
  then i 'll post links of the eritrean and kurdish situation as well . 
  i 'll do that as soon as i get home but basically welfare is the same all over the country and there are standard rules if you qualify for it . 
  it is not based on ethnicity . 
  so , a welfare swedish single man and a welfare roma single man gets the same amount ( and i 'll post the sum when i am off my phone ) . 
  school and health care for children is free all over the country ( hope you take my word for it :-) ) and health care for adults is cheap but might vary slightly depending on where you live ( for example it is maximum 1200 sek/year in stockholm but might be 1100 in malm\u00f6 and 1300 in g\u00f6teborg ) . 
  nothing is based on ethnicity though . 
  however , romas , just like other welfare people tend to end up in `` welfare ghettos '' . 
  i hardly think we can call them ghettos in the eastern european sense though . 
  however , even compared to other welfare groups they are doing worse in school etc. 
  i 'll post links tonight with some articles . 
  most kurds and eritreans in sweden were not well educated when they came , so that is n't the issue ( could be issue with iranians for example but that is the reason i choose these two groups ) . 
  and if someone who wants to discriminate and be a xenophobe they are hardly going to differentiate between browner people . 
  that is why i claim it is not poverty . 
  also , on the european level we hardly have poverty so that is not the issue in sweden at all . 
  so , poverty is not the reason . 
  i never said that the romas do not have a social stigma . 
  i think most immigrants and all people on welfare live with a social stigma . 
  you have however in no way managed to prove that their stigma is so much worse than other welfare groups . 
  you repeat opinions like they are facts which they are not . 
  and apparently you do not want to post facts . 
  and the kurds and eritreans that came to sweden had it * worse * than many romas btw , the trauma of torture , war and starvation . 
  so , they were worse off when they started , yet they are doing better now . 
  that is what you deny . 
  i know romas are not having fun . 
  however , saying they have it worse than everybody else and absolving them off responsibility is not right . 
  i have been to eastern europe and know romas have it shitty . 
  however , i have been to africa too and seen true poverty as well in a way we ca n't imagine . 
  yet they fare better here . 
  i am talking about romas in sweden and the kurds and eritreans were most certainly not better off than romas when they came . 
  you are making it up to fit into your views on romas i suppose and it might be noble , but twisting the truth is n't serving anyone . 
  i would like you to back it up with facts , as in scientific links please . 
  or you are completely unaware of their history of those people ? 
  have you about the gassing of the kurds ? 
  the suppression of them by everyone and the war that turkish army waged on them ? 
  or the long standing war between ethiopia and eritrea not to mention the hunger disasters they have had . 
  nothing that brutal has happened to romas in the last 30 years . 
  how many million died in the last starvation disaster ? 
  and what schooling for kurds are you talking about ? 
  again , and what insights do you have of schools in literacy rate in rural eritrea ? 
  particularly in the 80 's when most came to sweden . 
  enlighten me . 
  also , i 'd like facts behind your assumption that we discriminate romas more than kurds , eritreans and other dark skinned people . 
  can you prove that ? 
  and , to answer your question , if i had to choose between a kurd , eritrean and a roma i would the least prefer to be a roma . 
  not because they are worse off because the seem to act as the perpetual victim and be the least inclined to do something about it . 
  depends on the dogs i guess . 
  i think most do not , none of ours have ever done that . 
  even my cousins labrador who eats everything and then some ( as in screws , ropes , curtains , shoes , and this is as an adult dog ) do not eat poo . 
  maybe if there 's something interesting in the poo , then she 'd go for it . 
  but the romas in sweden get the same welfare checks as everybody else if they do not have a job and they do not live in poverty .
