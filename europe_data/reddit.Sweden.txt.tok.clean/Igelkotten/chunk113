  so do we !, 
  but i 'd like to point out that the uk have good media , bbc or the guardian for example . 
  media , housing politics , immigration policy , schools , the agricultural policy ( but i blame that on the eu ) , military , environmental issues , our politics for the country side/sparcely populated areas . 
  good to hear that someone down there is fighting the good fight . 
  good luck . 
  what does le front national want to do with the eu , what are their goals ? 
  i am guessing less immigration , but what else . 
  more eu ? 
  less eu ? 
  did you forbid snus ? 
  if so , maybe a few snus users went back to cigarettes . 
  yes !, 
  * of course * they smoke inside !, 
  my trained non smoking brain from an overly pc and anal country could n't even grasp the simple fact that they smoke inside . 
  my theory still holds ( if you are not allowed to smoke inside ) . 
   plus they 're considered gross because spit everywhere . 
  that * is * gross . 
  it is not supposed to be done that way . 
  there 's a little hole on top of the `` snus box '' where one can put used ones , so there is absolutely no need to throw them anywhere . 
  i actually do n't see used snus very often , i think people here seem to be fairly good at putting them away in that whole . 
  cigarettes however are everywhere , i hate that . 
  around a million swedes uses snus every week [ source ] ( http://svensktsnus.se/sv/akademin/fragor/ ) . 
  yes , it is swedish match as a source , but i 've seen that number at other official places too , just do n't have the right google fu at the moment . 
   also i 've heard that in sweden practically only men use snus , is that right ? 
  in norway it 's normal for women to use it too . 
  it * used * to be only a mans thing to use snus , and also , a bit more `` working class '' thing . 
  however , that is changing rather rapidly . 
  more and more middle class people use it - it is common now . 
  also , more and more girls are using it too . 
  i have two girlfriends that uses snus . 
  however , one difference might be that both of them have started to use snus when they quit smoking ( started at dumb teenagers ) . 
  that was rather unheard of 15-20 years ago i believe . 
  many guys do n't go the route to using snus instead of cigarettes , they just go straight for the snus . 
  13 % actually : - ) but , as you say , only if you exclude snus . 
  one of the slogans about eu was and still is btw . 
  i still believe if the eu wants us to leave , they should just forbid snus . 
  we would be out faster than they could say `` general portion '' . 
  i am hardly an expert ( i 've tried it once when i was 16 for all of 30 seconds before i could n't stand it anymore ) but it sounds to me like you are describing chewing tobacco . 
  snus does n't really smell ( well , maybe a bit if you smell the box ) , at least not when you use it . 
  also , everyone i know that uses snus uses `` portionssnus '' , small ready made bags that looks like [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/portioned_snus.jpg ) . 
  they do n't dribble or stain actually . 
  most people use them fairly discreet . 
  i am sure some other swede knows more , but `` loose '' snus is not common from what i know , not at all . 
  are you kidding ? 
  how can anyone afford to smoke ? 
  is there a lot of illegal cigarettes ? 
  we are not the second most expensive country at something ( after norway , always after norway ) . 
  * obviously * it is happening in one of the few areas where i would n't have minded if it was expensive as hell . 
  i think a packet of marlboro costs 50 sek/5 ,75 $ here . 
  a box of snus is 20 - 25 sek i believe , $ 2.50-3 . 
  how come we are not the most expensive country . 
  i need to investigate this , i am not used to this feeling :-), 
  no , understand me right , i am not saying snus is healthy for you . 
  * but * considering the fact that we have around 1 million snus users , * if * snus gave oral cancer to the same degree as cigarettes , or in any large degree it would show up in our statistic - as in we would have higher rates than we do . 
  therefore , i think it increases your risk , but not with that much . 
  haha , yes , and when we bring snus we are invincible :-) . 
  last time i was in helsinki i basically brought snus for half of helsinki :-) . 
  i had no idea what i bought , just showed the girl in the store my little note . 
   they are trying to shift towards other crops but it is a very difficult and rather slow process . 
  depends on when you start ... . . from what i have seen of the cap it has not exactly been trying to shift it until perhaps the last 10 -15 years . 
  we let our small farmers for example die a slow death in the 70 's and 80 's , yet i am somehow sponsoring small farmers in southern europe who has been in the eu since forever . 
  frankly , the cap has been like some of the aid to africa , it has enabled non profitable , idiotic operations to survive far , far longer than it should , actually having the opposite effect of what it is intended to do . 
  to top that , to take money from the whole of eu , to grow something that obviously costs the eu more money than it brings it , is financially extremly stupid . 
  nor is it fair of the millions of people who has to pay for it just because they grow it in a few countries , but everyone in the eu suffers . 
  it is clearly not something the eu needs and it should never ever have been subsidised in the first place . 
  sorry , not hating you , but the cap is really one of my pet peeves , i hate it in its current form . 
   a a rather big group living in the less populated areas ( which gives them more power in many electoral systems ) thanks , did n't know that . 
  i would expect so to really , more cases of mouth cancer , but i do n't think there 's a lot more mouth cancer . 
  when i googled oral cancer , europe we had a lot lower than for example france . 
  also , a lot of snus users are old smokers , which messes up the findings . 
  according to [ this ] ( http://www.google.se/imgres?client=firefox-a&amp;hs=uyx&amp;rls=org.mozilla:sv-se:official&amp;biw=1024&amp;bih=457&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=vvwmusf9k05-vm:&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/s1368837508001760&amp;docid=vw50y6e0n61elm&amp;imgurl=http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-s1368837508001760-gr2.jpg&amp;w=669&amp;h=448&amp;ei=duruutmcgok54asj64h4ba&amp;zoom=1&amp;ved=1t:3588,r:13,s:0,i:118&amp;iact=rc&amp;page=2&amp;tbnh=176&amp;tbnw=262&amp;start=8&amp;ndsp=12&amp;tx=148&amp;ty=41 ) we have lower than most other countries at least ,, 
  i do n't know actually . 
  i tried to google it and there seem to be a full scale war between those who says there is a risk and those who says who says there is n't . 
  however , it seems to be a higher risk for cancer in the pancreas . 
  but , there 's an increased risk for that as well when you smoke , and a lot of the people who uses snus are old smokers . 
  i think it is safe to say that it will certainly not decrease your risk of cancer if you are a non tobacco user and start using snus , my ( non professional ) guess is that it probably raises your risk with a few percentage points . 
  not with lot though , then i would n't have stumbled upon the disagreements . 
  however , if you are an ex smoker , which lot of the swedish snus users are , then you are lowering your cancer risks , * a lot * if you start using snus . 
  my brother used to smoke and went over to snus , and then started smoking again when he divorced . 
  his snus using never really bothered me , but after he was back on his feet again after the divorce , i have been nagging him , a lot , about his smoking . 
  so , now he is back to snus again and i have promised i 'll leave it there ( and i have the best spies , his kids ) as long as he does n't smoke . 
  i am not loosing another family member to cancer if i can help it , but snus does n't feel as scary ( and it is n't ) . 
   how do the state-provided lawyers work out in sweden ? 
   because over here , you 're screwed if that 's who you have defending you . 
  they are overworked with dozens of simultaneous cases , and not paid very well . 
  most just tell you to take a plea deal instead of fighting it since it 's easier on them ( and they would n't realistically be able to win it for you anyway ) . 
  it is working out well . 
  i think everyone 's lawyer gets paid by the state , so it is the same for everyone . 
  that is what you have really , so it works out well . 
  i am not clear on the `` they will provide one for you '' . 
  in sweden you have the right to a lawyer , paid for by the state ( in criminal cases at least , in civil suits it is probably different ) . 
   hat you can not be denied access to one if you wish to have one * providing a right of access to a lawyer from the first stage of police questioning and throughout criminal proceedings * . 
  i interpreted that as the right to a lawyer , as in you can not be denied acess to one . 
  we already have those laws , so i do n't think there 's a difference for us really . 
   because our conservatives are in power . 
  they 're trying to cute funding everywhere they can ( without annoying their friends ) , so lots of smaller things are being cut thanks for the explanation . 
  i still find it strange though , it is as if you are being taken over by republicans sometime . 
  i guess i do n't see where the move to the right is coming from really . 
  is it ukip ? 
  yes , i know .
