  they can do whatever they want , as long as i do not have to pay for them . 
  unfortunately , their unwillingness to change and their corruption means that they cost me money too , and , probably my non existing children . 
  i mean , i do n't rant about eucadors corruption , or moldovas bad choices . 
   how did you get to the conclusion that southern europe excuses everything with non-scientific arguments you excuse them with non scientific arguments . 
  and , i do n't know how many greeks that has told me about the dictatorship as a reason for not being productive . 
  when i point out the baltic states , china , brazil etc , countries who has/have it rougher and certainly ( in particular china ) has had dictatorship far later . 
  it is an excuse i am getting tired off , it is non scientific , not backed up by anything but southern europe uses it . 
  i think they should stop making up excuses and deal with the issue at hand . 
   you need economies that are as diverse as possible trading with each other . 
  yes , diverse is good for trading . 
  * not * for being in a federation or in a union , certainly not a currency union , and * not * for money transfers outside of trade . 
  read about [ optimum currency area ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/optimum_currency_area )  yes , they should have gotten their shit together . 
  and they refused to . 
  why should i be punished , and my children and grandchildren for their refusal to act like responsible persons ? 
  what more , you actually do n't help someone by just bailing them out the whole time . 
  permanent money transfers can be harmfult , that is a lot of economical theories behind that . 
  just look at africa . 
  if the perment transfered worked , then some of those countries would n't be as poor as they are . 
  same for southern europe . 
  they have to take responsibility as a country , and they are not . 
  instead they are blaming everyone but themselves . 
  only southern europe can fix southern europe . 
  so , more permanent transfers is a bad idea . 
   the rules that we have are shit anyway . 
  if one do not like the rules one leaves , or re-negotiates . 
  one do * not * ignore them and forces everyone else to bail you out . 
   without political will there is no rules . 
  well , if one is not a complete madman , one lives up to the obligations . 
  that is how politics works , if one is not insane . 
  one follows treaties . 
   actually the eurozone stability and growth treaty allows to a qualified majority to skip the sanctions . 
  no , not really . 
  futhermore , it does no allow for bailout , transferring of debt , debt forgiveness , or the fact that ecb intervenes on behalf of individual countries . 
  all that is against treaties and ecb rules ...  what are they going to do ? 
  let countries leave . 
  not bail them out . 
  we do not have a federation . 
  if one put oneself in the shitter , one should dig oneself out of it . 
   was n't cutting acces to eu funds to regional development funds to countries with too much debt the only possible fine ? 
  do not think so . 
  kick countries out , and force them to pay a fine for example . 
   germany was the the first country in break the agreement without consequences . 
  no , not at all . 
  greece , italy and belgium started out with a far bigger debt/gdp ratio than they should have ( maybe france too ) . 
  then everyone else followed . 
   what i see like very german is expecting that the spanish government will do something only because it 's in the spanish constitution . 
  they will pretend and the court will say that is enought as usual . 
  i can write too much about this . 
  another proof that the euro is messed up and not working , nor is the eu, 
   i disagree with you that you 're correct . 
  prove me wrong then . 
  i 'd like to see you prove to me that southern europeans do * not * vote for corrupt bastards like berlusconi . 
  what more , i 'd like for you to prove that they do not cheat far , far more on their taxes , and pay less while at it . 
  also , i 'd like for you to prove that they are less corrupt . 
  also , i 'd like for you to prove that it will be less permanent transfers to the south with a federation . 
  start with that . 
  and , i 'd like real proof , as in credible links . 
  i am at the uni , so i have access to all scientific journals . 
  i am sorry , but if you say that i am wrong , i expect you to prove it . 
   uk had 240 % debt during the napoleonic wars . 
  are you serious ? 
  who cares , we have never paid for them !, 
  it was 200 years ago . 
  are you saying that my grandchildren will have to pay for greece 's non productive corrupt grandchildren ? 
   greece joined in 1981 , spain and portugal joined in 1986 . 
  both of them have a history you might want to look up , even italy does.you do n't fix a country overnight , and even if you want to ... look at eastern europe ( which to be honest , has much less fault in their history as it was pushed down their throats ... ) so , you are saying that greece that came out of dictatorship in * 1974 * and spain in * 1977 * ( i belive ) , and italy in ** 1945 ** had an ** harder ** time than the baltic states that ** did n't even exist ** . 
  talk about getting things showed down their throats-they fucking did n't even exists as a country . 
  what you are saying is not only historically incorrect , you are extremely disrespectful towards eastern europe . 
  in fact , you are just making shit up . 
  i 'd like you to post scientific evidence that greece , italy and spain have had no chance to fight the corruption and develop properly and become productive . 
  scientic evidence please , as in well known economic journals . 
  otherwise , you are just making stuff up . 
  as i said , countries who had it way worse , korea , china , brazil has pulled * themselves * up . 
  they had it far , far worse than southern europe ( how many millions died on you in the last 50 years ) yet you ignore those . 
   generally , zones which are economic powerhouses are going to be net contributors and zones less developed are going to be net receivers . 
  sigh , that changes . 
  in the time of that napoleonic war you are so fond of , we were dirt poor in northern europe , so you are not talking about a scientific law . 
  what irritates me is that you play it like southern europe do not have a choice . 
  of course they do . 
  they choose not to pay taxes , vote for dirtbags and not become productive . 
  they have choices . 
  when estonia was deep in trouble and reforming their economy , greece was living high on our money . 
  again - it is about the choices one makes . 
  why are you excusing that ? 
  you are just playing southern europe as a victims . 
  they are not , they have chosen every single game . 
  there are no special circumstances that excuses southern europes lack of development , refusal to deal with corruption ( how can you excuse southern italy . 
  it has n't been fixed in 70 years . 
  how much more time do you need ? ) . 
   if i grow up in france and the gov pays for my security , healthcare , education , etc. 
  they are going to have a deficit.what happens when i get to 18 and instead of paying taxes there i move to germany and pay taxes there that question is n't even relevant until now , since the transfer of people in between eu countries has been very low . 
  so , no excuse for the poor perfomance in the south . 
  i think one of the biggest transfers were between the nordic countries btw . 
  sweden have something like 10 % of finns . 
  that does n't seem to have harmed finland . 
  so again , you are making stuff up . 
   although , it 's not like the rest of the countries that you hold in regard have been respecting the 60 % gdp and 3 % deficit standard . 
  i agree , the euro area is generally in trouble and no one cares about the rules . 
  again , some more questions . 
  how many more decades of southern europe not giving , but receiving ?
