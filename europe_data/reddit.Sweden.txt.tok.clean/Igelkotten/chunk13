  been a while , maybe the numbers are a tad off , but one do not get licenses for that many weapons . 
  edit . 
  apparently he did have a license for them , but that seems still like they were more and i doubt he stored them like one should according to the license . 
  a ) i could n't read the whole text . 
  b ) what does this have to do with europe ? 
   of course - but it 's not like issues are being swept under the rug . 
  remedies are being applied and institutional powers altered to fit the charted goals . 
  no , they are not . 
  to have a working currrency union you need shared debt , huge permanent transfers , a common political and financial integration as well as a completely different central bank etc. 
  and nothing if that is even in the pipeline ? 
  when is the vote taking place that gives up the german constitution ? 
  when are the finns voting to take on greece 's debt ? 
  when are we getting new eu treaties ? 
  i 'd like the dates please , because it is not like we can wait 20 years , and changes like that needs at least one election in between , votes in 28 countries etc. 
  ** nothing ** of that is even in the pipeline - while the ez is heading towards depression/deflation . 
   what is european stability mechanism but more integration ? 
  banking union ( ssm ) is coming as well . 
  crises are good because they accelerate integration . 
  sigh , we are talking about a band aid on a vulcano outburst . 
  please , give me the dates for those and - do you honestly think the north will vote yes to abandoning their nations , taking on greeces debt , send 30 % of their gdp down south ? 
  i guarantee a no to that - and how , in detail , will you solve that ? 
  wait 40 years ? 
  all the time in a depression ? 
   all of the issues that you mention are not because of eu , but because of improper national governance . 
  no - you are wrong . 
  first - you do not seem to understand the difference between the eurozone and the eu . 
  * a lot * if not most of those issues we are seeing in the ** eurozone ** are because how extremely badly constructed the ** euro ** is.as i have said in my other post , and as i keep educating people on this board - the euro is a very , very badly constructed currency . 
  that is economics 101 and i wish you to google currency union and read up on it , and also head over to r/economics . 
  also , read this post , since i am getting slightly frustradet about repeating myself over and over again about currency unions and the difference between the eu and ez . 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1xp5iu/joining_the_euro_club_latvia/cfdrr3x  all of the countries involved would experience such maladies regardless whether they were in the eu/eurozone or not wrong again . 
  sweden , poland , uk etc are already out of it . 
  it is the ez that is suffering . 
  read the articles in my linked post . 
   being inside the eu has enabled them to experience much higher ( although artificial ) economic growth , and ultimately reforms which will enable more effective governance by enforcing balanced budgets which they now must submit to eu commission for review . 
  it 's not all roses - but most of these issues were predictable and can be solved . 
  one additional advantage of the debt crisis is that failed economies export their workers to the rest of eu , enabling more societal integration which is crucial in the long-term . 
  no , the government is not getting more effective . 
  in fact , more corrupt . 
  look at how italy have fallen on the corruption index for example . 
  deal with facts . 
  and again - ** stop mixing up the eu and the eurozone ** . 
  and no , it is not being solved . 
  please tell me how the shared debt is being solved and how you are going to solve the internal devaluation in the south . 
  in detail and scientific articles please . 
  i have access to academic journals . 
   by the time that comes , there will be no germany or greece , finland or portugal . 
  only eu frankly , you are so far out that i can hardly talk to you . 
  what year ? 
  how are you going to get the swedes to say uyes ? 
  how are you going to get the eurozone to survive until that ? 
  how are you going to get the countries to say yes ? 
  have you even read the polls ? 
  this is your dream , and it will fail , for a lot of reasons , but a big one is that you have no clue about economics 101 . 
  are you going to let the eurozone stay in depression for 20 years , while you work towards it ? 
   century ago more than 90 % of existing nation states did n't exist , and `` were not even in the pipeline '' . 
  there is no reason to assume that they will exist forever either . 
  a few more generations of those brainwashed in nationalism need to die out , and the whole notion of `` independece '' in a world ruled by few global players will look like a joke . 
  i 'd like an academic source for that . 
  we are talking about your dreams , not the truth . 
  the only one i know who raises/has kids like this is my second cousin and everyone hate her kids . 
  she and her husband has some weird idea about `` free upbringing '' and `` children should learn for themselves what is right and wrong '' . 
  that means that everyone else have to tell her kids not to do stuff and still they do n't listen . 
  they are spoiled brats and the other children refuse to play with them . 
  are they the only idiotic brats in sweden , no , of course not . 
  however , i do n't think it is as bad as the author describes it . 
  a lot of things are wrong . 
  one can take cell phones for example . 
  that is not true . 
  one can confiscate cell phones in sweden . 
  i am sorry that you get downvoted . 
  if one says negative things about the eurozone one does get downvoted . 
  even political projects have to adjust to reality . 
  and political projects fail - daily . 
  think of the political project the soviet union for example . 
  or several currency unions before , one in scandinavia for example . 
  there are a gazillions political projects that have failed because they failed the reality test . 
  and the fact is that the euro will fail * just because * it is purely political . 
  how that that help them out of depression ? 
  i have n't seen that solve the unemployment or debt ? 
  and the integration is n't coming . 
  it is n't even in the pipeline . 
  for a proper currency union you need shared debt , huge permanent transfers , financial and political integration etc. 
  when are you going to do that ? 
  are germany going to pay off greece 's debt in 2015 ? 
  do you see finland sending 20 % of their gdp to portugal ? 
  so you see the state giving up the independence at the moment ? 
  no more national states ? 
  that is n't even in the pipeline , and you need that to save the euro . 
  there are only two way to go . 
  integrate , far , far more , or dissolve . 
  since they are not integrating , they will dissolve . 
   radical change of public opinion , although rare , happened all over the human history of course . 
  and germany can for example decide to pay off greece 's debt . 
  as you said , stranger things have happened . 
  not bloody likely though . 
   but gradual changes are predetermined to happen since every kilometer around sweden is gradually turning blue over time . 
  no , not very likely . 
  there are only two way for a currency union to go . 
  close/more integrated , or dissolve . 
  since they are not integrating more ( the rate is so slow that it might as well be non existant ) it will most likely dissolve .
