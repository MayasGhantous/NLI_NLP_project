  but , maybe you do n't want to do that . 
  ok , we give them free housing , health care , schools and welfare benefits . 
  they do not send their children to school and do not work . 
  it is a two way street . 
  what more can we do than that ? 
  and , are n't they responsible for the lack of integration ? 
  what the fuck more do they want ? 
  i have sent you numerous reports . 
  you are just not interested . 
  you are  also , please provide a source , in english , regarding the free education , healthcare , housing and welfare . 
  again , i have - read for example the one about the school . 
  it was in english , and it proves again that you are just out to fight for what ever opinoion you have , not finding out the truth . 
  school is free in sweden , for every single child . 
  period . 
  end . 
  healtcare is free , for every single child , and same price for everyone ( in stockholm it is 1100/year for adults ) . 
  that is our welfare system , which you would have known , had you bothered to inform yourself . 
  if they live here , they receive the same treatment i do . 
  period . 
  end . 
  it is like asking me to prove that sweden is a democracy and that we have the right to vote . 
  you see everything through the eyes that romas are victims , you can not possibly believe that they get treated like everyone else , so you refuse to accept the fact that they behave like assholes , to you they are the perpetual victims . 
  in fact , you are just not interested in finding out that you might be wrong . 
  i have sent you numerous reports , and you do n't even bother to ask if the school system is free . 
  yes it is , for everyone . 
  instead , you claim that i have to prove it . 
  google it - school and health care is free in sweden . 
  just because * you * discriminate , it does n't mean we do . 
  you are the worst advocate for romas i have encountered . 
  in fact , you are the racists , you treat them like perpetual victims . 
  and , yes , i know we have had romas in sweden since 1650 - eight familys to be exact . 
  had you bothered to read some of the other reports , or my answer , you would have seen that i said 95 % ( thus , excluding the few hundred that existed before the 1960 ) and pointing out that 95 % of the romas arrived in sweden after 1960 . 
  not that you care , you are only out to prove falsehoods . 
   one of the links you provided talked about housing and free healthcare . 
  ** everyone in sweden has it ** why do you think our welfare system is famous . 
  do you want me to link to the fact that we are a democracy too , or that we have a king and a parlament ? 
  honestly , the only thing you have managed to do is being the worst advocate for the romas i have seen . 
  not in any way have you even admitted that they are adults that makes their own choices . 
  or , the fact that they are resposible for the lack of intergration . 
  you are in fact a racist , the way you exclude romas from blame , and blame everyone else . 
  and - what blacks are you referring to . 
  finally , some facts in english .

  so , i 'd like you to point out again why romas in sweden are excused from sending their children to school , and contribute to society . 
  also , you are saying we are doing it wrong - do you mean no free health care , housing etc - all the things that you have been complaining about is missing in eastern europe ? 
  well , they have them here , yet , no difference . 
   natura 2000 is emerald network inside eu , if you know what i mean . 
  aha , then i get it . 
  thanks . 
  how is the afd doing in the polls ? 
  true , copenhagen is much closer to you , 700 km south for me . 
  last year ( which was btw a long winter ) we had snow for 125 days in a row , plus that it was rather cold . 
  the only plants that are green during that are coniferous trees ... ivy do not survive that . 
  ca n't one have both the natura 2000 and emerald network sites ? 
  since you like official reports , i have found a few more for you . 
  [ here is an official one about roma and drug abuse ] ( http://www.stat-inst.se/pagefiles/631/annars-far-man-inte-vara-med-missbrukarvard-och-kulturens-t%c3%a4ckelse-exemplet-romet.pdf ) ) [ here is an official report about roma chidren that are taken in byt the state due to the fact that they parents can not , or will not , take care of them ] ( http://www.socialstyrelsen.se/lists/artikelkatalog/attachments/9746/2006-131-36_200613136.pdf ) [ here is a link to a roma female organisation ] ( http://romskakvinnoforum.dinstudio.se/text1_16.html ) . 
  also , you are , i assume agreeing with me about the fact that romas receive free health care , free schools , free housing , welfare just like everyone else - yet you said that sweden did wrong . 
  what should we have done differently ? 
  why are n't the romas grateful and thankful ? 
  well , copenhagen is further south than stockholm ( where i live ) and has a warmer climate . 
  and no , ivy ca n't really grow here , apart from in a few , warm places . 
  it is to cold , at least according to wiki and since we do n't have it , i tend to belive it . 
  we have an absolutely horrible building in stockholm that was supposed to be covered in some sort of ivy , according to the architech that must have had the brain of a peanut . 
  however , it did n't work of course since ivy ca n't really grow here . 
  instead , there are just a few brown branches on the building , and one side ( the south i believe ) gets a few green leaves every now and then . 
  [ here is the original building ] ( http://raddaengelbrekt.se/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/arkitekth%c3%b6gskolan-300x225.png ) ( regularely voted to be the ugliest in stockholm and/or sweden ) . 
  [ here is the side that has `` ivy '' ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-uapedbh1tz4/t7ddzarrx_i/aaaaaaaaaoq/z8_eamzxfay/s400/ett+fult+hus.jpg ) . 
  yes , those little brown branches really makes a difference . 
  i think they even manages with the impossible , to make that ugly house even uglier . 
  yes , i mean , i know stockholm where i live is further north , but we have nothing that grows on houses that can be green all year . 
  pine trees and european spruce are green all year , but they hardly grow on houses . 
   you think or do you have statistical data proving your point it sayus so in the article which is from socialstyrelsen , an department ho ordered a report . 
  of course there is no exact data , since we do n't really have ethnic statistic the way the us does , but we * are * really good at statistics , so yes , around 50 000 . 
   well i do n't know . 
  when someone says `` black people '' who do they generally refer to ? 
  i do not know - that is why i ask . 
  you are the one constantly making the comparison - what are you thinking of . 
   how is this relevant ? 
  do n't blame me for the hundred years of slavery . 
  the romas in sweden are by large people that have chosen to come here . 
  after that they have chosen not to integrate , to live on welfare and not send their children to school . 
   ove it then . 
  statistics , studies etc. 
  you have that in my last answer . 
  have fun . 
   what did i say ? 
  here are some of your excuses for romas . 
   you make it seem like it 's a choice when for most it 's not . 
  of course it is . 
  why are the romas not sending their children to school in sweden and finland when we want them too - * because it is a choice * . 
  you lie when you say that they have no choice . 
  another one of your excuses :  sending their kids to a school that does n't teach about their language , culture and history is understandable . 
  that is the same for every single immigration group in sweden . 
  yet you excuse the romas . 
  they can teach their children themselves . 
  you are just excusing them . 
  another lie . 
   roma operate in tight family units where each member of the group has to contribute something . 
  not in sweden , most of them live on welfare .
