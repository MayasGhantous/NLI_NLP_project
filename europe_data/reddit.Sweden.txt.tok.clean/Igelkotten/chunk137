  they contribute nothing . 
  honestly , you are perfectly capable of using google translate . 
  why do n't you ? 
  it is as if you do not want to  news agencies often distort the truth in order to suit their own needs . 
  if your claims are true it should n't be too hard to find approved studies and statistics . 
  no , of course not . 
  have fun .

  all official reports from various governmental agencies/authorithies . 
  i have plenty more where that comes from , but i figured it would be easier for you to read the articles in google translate . 
  have fun however . 
  tell me when you need more reports . 
   where did i not blame sweden for anything , i pointed out that its handling the situation all wrong . 
  no , so is giving them food , welfare , good schols and housing all wrong ? 
  so the romas are such delicate little flowers that exactly every single thing have to be in complete accordance with * their * wishes ? 
  other immigrant groups adjust and contribute to society ? 
  why ca n't the romas do that ? 
  how can you excuse the fact that they do n't , depsite being given fucking everything ? 
   your refusal to acknowledge the similarities between the struggle of romas and black people is proof enough that your argument stems from ignorance of the roma 's historical and modern plight . 
  you refusal to give the romas any responsibility and excuse despicable behaviour and choose to see them as helpless victims is , apart from being racists , and sure way to make sure that the romas will continue down the path that they have started , stealing , uneducated etc. 
  instead of seeing them as adults that make their life choices , you treat them like poor little victims . 
  also , as i told you that no one , romas or not , in sweden has to steal , or is starving . 
  why do you excuse romas that do that ? 
   just like black people , right ? 
  i have already answered that . 
  are you honestly saying that black people all over the globe are not in any way responsible for their actions or if they choose not to send their children to school , or if they choose to live on welfare , choose to steal ? 
  is that your opinion - really . 
  why is being black an excuse for all that ? 
  why is being roma an excuse for stealing , living on welfare and refusing to go to school, 
   how many romas have permanent residence status and have received welfare benefits including housing ? 
  ca 50 000 romas live in sweden . 
  i think at least 90 % of those live on welfare . 
   secondly , you 're going to have to back up the claim that roma 's are no more poorer than everyone else with some statistics . 
  there are as `` poor '' as anyone else on welfare , which is around 600 000 people . 
  however , their statistic on education is * the * worst . 
  frankly , ca n't you get that we are the top welfare country in the world . 
  no one , and i mean no one in sweden , has to steal . 
  no one , and i mean no one , has to starve . 
   which is not what i 'm doing . 
  yes you are . 
  you have excused the fact that they are not sending their children to school for example . 
   according to me ? 
  really ? 
  because i do n't remember saying that . 
   are black people responsible for the situation they currently find themselves in ? 
  black people in which country ? 
  in nigeria and somalia ? 
  yes . 
  in sweden - yes . 
  in the uk - yes . 
  and , are black people in the us responsible for their actions - yes . 
  are you honestly claiming that black people all over the world are not responsible for their actions because of their * race * ? 
  seriouysly , you are such a racist if you claim that ? 
  explain to me in detail , why a black mother who steals is less responsible than a white mother for her action ? 
  also , remeber that 95 % of the romas in sweden has come in the last 40 years , so they * choose * to come here , they were hardly imported as slaves . 
  well , are they ? 
  are they responsible or not for their actions . 
  [ article about one of the few roma men that has finished school ] ( http://www.vartgoteborg.se/prod/sk/vargotnu.nsf/1/levande_historia,bagir_jobbar_for_att_fa_romska_barn_till_skolan ) he explains that the romas do not * want * to send their children to school . 
  they do not * want * to become part of the swedish society . 
  i think that is rather horrible . 
  it is fine accepting welfare , free health and some place to live , but when it comes to giving back , or being part of something , it is like this man explains - the romas * chooses * to stay outside . 
  they are just using the swedish society , not contributing to it . 
  why do you defend that ? 
  [ here ] ( http://www.svt.se/nyheter/sverige/unga-romer-kampar-i-motvind ) is an article that only every 10th roma graduates from school , something that around 90 % ( at least ) of non roma student does . 
  only half of them , even finishes 9th grade , the * absolute * minimum in sweden . 
  there is no other group with numbers like that , none . 
  and we are talking that people from somalia , and afghanistan are beating them - because they want to go to school and get an education . 
  the romas chooses not to . 
  [ 50 000 romas lives in sweden . 
  less than 10 of them studies at university ] ( http://lundagard.se/2010/12/12/%e2%80%9dfarre-an-tio-romer-studerar-pa-universitet%e2%80%9d/ ) . 
  you do not see numbers that bad , anywhere else , really . 
  oh , and the absolute majority of the romas have arrived in the last 40 years . 
  you can hardly blame us swedes for generations of discrimination . 
  they come here , they choose not to educate , not to participate etc - and you defend that . 
  i think that is so wrong that you do that , and that you treat them like infants . 
  and i have n't even started with the links about crime ... oh , and here is a link about a roma adult school , for romas who have n't finished school and need courses to qualify . 
  the school has a roma profile . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.gp.se/nyheter/goteborg/1.768476-fusk-for-hundratusentals-kronor-pa-folkhogskola ) . that is one of the way the , according to you , the discriminating swedish state is trying to tackle the problem that the poor , poor romas ca n't go to school . 
  the problem is that a lot of the students were never there , although they recived money to study , and the school received money from the state . 
  it is called stealing . 
  why do you excuse that ? 
  i have hundreds of similar links . 
  all of them are from `` normal '' sources btw , not right wing extremists papers or something similar . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.socionomen.nu/text/2012-romernas-ar ) is an article about romas in sweden . 
  all of them say that they have it far better in sweden than anywhere else btw . 
  but , in malm\u00f6 , not even half of the roma children even go to school . 
  why do you defend that ? 
  also , the article mentions that at least 80 % of the romas live on welfare , and that they live unhealthy lives and uses a lot of drugs and are often in prison . 
  also , the article mentions something i find interesting , a swedish researcher about roma history . 
  he mentions that attitudes like the ones you have , are racists too , if all you can see is a victim . 
  he says that the romas are of course responsible how they behave towards other people . 
  it is nice to know that even researchers agrees with me ( and disagrees with you ) . 
  i know that the romas have been victims of the xenophobia , but i think you are so wrong excusing every single behaviour . 
  there is not reason for their behviour in sweden - none . 
  the romas in sweden who has permanent residence receive exactly the same welfare and benefits as everyone else . 
  no one in sweden starves . 
  there is no reason to steal unless you choose to . 
  yet - romas apparently have more reason than anyone else .
