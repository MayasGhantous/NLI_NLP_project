  i imagine that is quite different for an italian . 
  interesting , thanks, 
  whatever they do , euro taxpayers can be 100 % sure that they will carry the cost , but get none of the profits . 
  i do not understand why euro taxpayers think that is ok , i really do not . 
  i wish it would be non antibiotic as well , but i think the eu do not care so much about that . 
  but , had one from the beginning let greece default , they could have been well on their way to recovery . 
  second , it would have been a lot cheaper for each country just to save their own banks . 
  third - how in god 's name can you defend moving greek debt and bank debts over to tax payers in other countries , without even demanding collateral ? 
  who does a bank save without collateral ? 
  the only thing the banks have learned is that the world is risk free . 
  why would an eventual greek default bring down the world economy ? 
  actually i think it is 90 % of the swedes now who are against the euro . 
  we can hardly muster 50 % for our eu membership . 
  yes , in the beginning the purchasing power rose more , but after that it sank more as well . 
  and you are right , devaluating is not in my mind the best way to handle things . 
  however , for countries like spain and greece i am sure it would give some much needed breathing space . 
  i think they are harmed much more by being in the euro , than finland ( or sweden ) . 
  yes , but greece have received more help than any poor south american or african country . 
  they have complained - why is so much recourses going to a relatively small eu country who is very rich in comparison . 
  also , greece have received a better deal ( or less bad perhaps ) than almost all other counties that the imf have helped . 
  why ? 
  what makes them special ? 
  the argument `` think of the children '' is so misused , and overused that i almost ca n't hear it anymore , even when it is relevant . 
  if caneron ( like most other governments ) truly thought of the children i think they should hire more teachers and pay them more . 
  that said - even attempting to ban porn is beyond idiotic . 
  how did that proposal get so far ? 
  i thought that cameron was reasonable intelligent with his ear at least reasonably to the ground i am assuming it will be shot down hard . 
  also , from what i have understood about the tories sex habit , it is them that will suffer the most if one start banning porn , particularly the weird porn a la oranges/stockings/strangulation . 
  yes , i know , so do we , and it annoys me . 
  the imf is really nothing but a tool for the eu . 
  and you do not have to bail out other countries , write down their debt or participate in idiotic bank saves . 
  we will not . 
  apart from the fact that it would be political suicide , i think economists all over the spectrum , in most countries agrees that the euro is most incorrectly constructed currency union . 
  that will need to change , but for that to change one have to change treaties etc. 
  i do not see that happening n the near future , they ca n't even agree to stop sponsoring tobacco . 
  yes , but the should give the correct reason . 
  do n't pretend to care about the oceans/water , we all know spain do not care . 
  say - we are as always pissed off about gibraltar instead so we want to mess with you . 
  yes it has . 
  he claimed that spain was doing this because ( according to the article ) they all of a sudden cared about the oceans and did n't want an illegal reef , plus that it would be harder for the fishermen . 
  since spain is notoriously lax about actually following quotas , jailing their fishermen who fish illegally or with dodgy nets , i call bullshit . 
  if spain truly cared about the oceans and the fishes , they would start in the right end - fighting for lower quotas and making sure their fishermen stayed within their water and fished in the manners they are supposed to . 
  frankly , it is a bit of concrete , it is everywhere . 
  of course it pisses the spanish off , everything about gibraltar pisses them off . 
  however , they should not claim that they all of a sudden care about the oceans . 
  they care about gibraltar . 
  and frankly , considering that spain is notorious for it lax attitude towards spanish fishermen 's illegal fishing and dodgy practises this really , really screams hypocrisy to me . 
  if they cared one tiny bit about fishing or the oceans , they would start fighting their own fishermen 's illegal fishing . 
  frankly , if the concrete make it harder for them to fish - good . 
  spain is doing way to much illegal and dodgy fishing anyway , a bit less fishing will not harm them . 
  seriously , spain is one of the countries in the eu fighting the hardest for higher fishing quotas even though the oceans have less and less fish . 
  furthermore , spanish fishermen are not exactly strangers to fishing outside africa etc. 
  i 'll believe spain 's concern about fishing when i see them fight for lower quotas and the more of their fishermen are thrown in jail and have their boats taken from them for illegal fishing . 
  this is about gibraltar . 
  oh , is n't that dangerous - to have important political figures elected for life ? 
  what is a senator for life ? 
  is it a political position , or is it just a ceremonial position ? 
  i honestly do not think there 's a straight answer to the question of whether gm is bad or not ( but i do not think it might be bad because of the process in which it is created ) . 
  it is , unfortunately a rather complex issue , and while we humans love simple answers and explanations , life is n't always that easy . 
  ** sweden ** one of our biggest miscarriages of justice , ever , came , if not to and end , but to the beginning of the end , if i may paraphrase churchill . 
  the serial killer , formerly known as tomas quick have now been cleared of the last of the ** eight ** murders he was convicted of . 
  now we have a man , sture bergwall , who , despite never killing anyone , somehow managed to get convicted for 8 murders , despite a complete lack of evidence . 
  we also have eight murders , with no known killer , not even knowing if all of these people were murderd . 
  above all - we are all left with the question - * how could this happen ? * . 
  unfortunately , and one of the biggest failures is that no one seem to have a clear cut answer to that question . 
  it seems to have been the perfect storm of fame hungry prosecutors , incompetent lawyers , idiotic police officers , bad system , horrible doctors etc. 
  however , no one has yet been made responsible , or fired . 
  in true swedish fashion we now have a committee of some sort that will look into it . 
  if anyone wants to read more about it there was an excellent and fascinating ( but long ) article in gq about it recently . 
  [ the serial killer has second thoughts - the confessions of tomas quick ] ( http://www.gq.com/news-politics/newsmakers/201308/thomas-quick-serial-killer-august-2013 ) . 
  also - pride week in stockholm apart from that - it rained a lot in the beginning of the week , then it was very very hot - probably the hottest day of the year . 
  above 30 degrees - we do not know how to cope :-), 
  no , but it would have been interesting if she had tried at least a few of those things . 
  i am having a really hard time imaging merkel 's version of bunga bunga parties :-) . 
  ompa , ompa parties in lederhosen with rent boys ? 
  with her fellow ministers ? 
  she and guido westerwelle poring weissbier over a boy ? 
  maybe i should stop now ... 
  sorry , bloody auto spelling . 
  i know it is not ivorian . 
  it would have been rather interesting though , the finnish ivorian language group . 
  wonder how that would have come about . 
  messed up dvorak though . 
  the austrian hungarian empire ( or should i say hungarian austrian perhaps ) obviously . 
  a famous family is the esterhazy 's . 
  the euroasian steppes , the pusta ( ? 
  spelling ) feels like a big part of hungary and i also think the very fact that they have steppes ( as opposed to mountains for example ) have contributed to the fact that they gave been overrun by `` hordes '' from the east several times . 
  i think romans , huns , turks , germans etc have happily invaded hungary a few times ( although it probably was n't hungary at the time ) . 
  had kings called stephen and mathias . 
  the hungarian kingdom shifted in size . 
  i think , if i remember correctly that it was very unequal distribution of wealth , a few very rich , most dirt poor . 
  in wwii on the german side . 
  a lot if jews were killed . 
  the revolution of 1956 obviously . 
  also , for the sports interested , apparently the world 's most hateful water polo match against the ussr . 
  hungarian is not indo european language , but belong to the finnish/ivorian group . 
  famous for their folk music . 
  lizt pops up in my head , and , i believe dvorak . 
  in recent time - imre kertes got the nobel prize of literature . 
  when i think of hungarian food i think of peppers , and the also have quite a lot of creamy stuff , and sweet wine .
