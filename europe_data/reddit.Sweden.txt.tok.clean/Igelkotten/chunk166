  if you get money since 1986 for regional development and still needs it , or for the infrastructure , something is wrong . 
  when are countries standing on their own two feet supporting their own infrastructure etc ? 
  30 years ? 
  40 years ? 
  i mean , countries like korea has dragged themselves to top of the world in that time ? 
  how long are we going to pay for stuff like that ? 
   please look back on the eu budget and see that the money is also the money used in investing in energy infrastructure . 
  the eu is spending the absolute majority and has been ( in the 80 's it was 80 % of the budget ) on agriculture , - far to little is been on r & d. - . 
  edit : btw , the uk spend 3.3 billion pounds per year on research , the eu plans to spend 20 billion euro per year  it 's budget by comparison with other nations is minuscule . 
  you do not seem to realise that the eu and the uk are two different things with two different aims . 
  for one thing , the eu is * not * a nation . 
  it is not in the eu budget for example to stimulate . 
  - therefore they should spend a lot , lot more on r & d - that is long term thinking . 
  the eu do not care about currencies , welfare etc - so they can and should focus on stuff like energy . 
   this is a trade enhancement and integration program , because expanding trade consistently helps economic growth . 
  like the economic growth we are seeing in spain , greece and portugal at the moment ? 
  i mean , that infrastructure lead to - nothing apparently . 
  btw - [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1ibu8z/40_years_after_the_start_of_its_construction/cb33dyq ) are links i gave to another redditor . 
  why should i pay for those airports ? 
  are you saying that this is the best use of my money ? 
  i challenge you on that - and if that is the eu 's opinion , i want my money back . 
  not that it is never ever going to happen , we are talking abut an organisations that subsidies tobacco and alcohol after all .

  for starters ... i have more , much more - just google . 
  why have we been paying for this for decades . 
  is this really the best investment of our money ? 
  yes , but spain is now stuck with a lot of empty airports and roads . 
  is that the absolutely the best way the eu could spend my tax money ? 
  i am not against it , i am just saying we shuld spend less . 
  and - i can understand that the uk is spending money on infrastructure - classic receipie when the economy is not going to well . 
  also , is n't there an election soon ? 
  furthermore , it is not the role of the eu to stimulate the economy in that way , the budget is far more for long time stimulus . 
  however , giving enormous amount of money to agriculture and spending at least to much on infrastructure is not the best use of the taxpayers money in my mind - i personally think r & d and energy should receive far , far more . 
  i honestly do n't begrudge money that goes to infrastructure , but i think the eu spends far , far to much on it . 
  it would be better with other sorts of regional development , research etc. 
  i mean , at some points it seems ridiculous to me , building roads for what . 
  yes , perhaps , but it almost feels like those are made up news just because there is nothing better to write about . 
  can we win the championships btw ( i really do n't know sports ) - perhaps that can be news ? 
  otherwise it is mostly expressen et al giving people advice on how to protect themselves against the sun and which ice cream to eat ... 
  ** sweden ** - nothing , we are on vacation . 
  do you have sources that is not your comments/yourself ? 
  from what i have read , i ca n't find anything about the hundred years . 
  nor is it mentioned on wiki , neither the swedish or danish page . 
  do you learn about the opression and murder of swedes , as in the bloodbath of stockholm , or the invasion of visby ? 
   everyone is looking for their own short-term benefit and as a result the people in the peripheral countries suffer . 
  part of it is the stupid euro , but the other part of it is that you , the greeks , have chosen , for decades , to build up a corrupt system and not pay taxes . 
  you still do n't . 
  what do you expect ? 
   , it 's up to the politicians . 
  change politicians then . 
  you , the greeks , are responsible for them . 
   promises that were made at gunpoint and under threats and are also impossible to keep , should not be kept . 
  greece has been forced to make completely irrational promises the past few years . 
  if they stop delivering , that 's a positive sign in my book . 
  that says a lot about you - you do not care about honestly and promises then i guess . 
  greece have received ** 240 ** billions , and given a haircut of 40 billions , yet you describe it as being forced/gunpoint etc. 
  how many billions or , should i ask , trillions , should the rest of europe hand over to the greeks ? 
  i 'd like a number . 
  answer that please . 
  furthermore , i 'd also like to know exactly how much money you should receive before you can start fixing your own problem . 
  i 'd also like to know in what other cases you think one should just * give * money like that - and the greeks do n't have to promise anything ? 
  are youtruly saying that the money should just have been given to you - no questions asked . 
  why then ? 
  what makes you so unique that the rest of europe should do that for you ? 
   for instance , there 's a new tax that you have to pay based on the real estate you own . 
  a lot of people own their houses instead of renting but that does n't mean they are making a profit out of it . 
  so , that tax in particular is punishing them hard . 
  yes , we have been paying that tax since the 50 's - i know what tax you are talking about . 
  honestly saying it is punishing is frankly idiotic - the rest of europe have been paying that tax for over 40 years . 
  what you should ask is * why * are you only starting to pay it now ? 
  why have you build up a system where you pay less taxes ? 
   just note that this by itself is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition to turn greece into a competitive highly industrialised country like finland . 
  no , only the greeks can turn greece into finland . 
  but to do that you do n't only have to work hard , which i believe you do , but also stop being corrupt . 
  corruption is your biggest obstacle ( apart from being in the euro ) in my mind . 
  yes , then we are number three !!!!, 
  thank you belgium . 
  my aim is to be out of the top five sometime during my lifetime . 
  i do n't have any about the icelanders though . 
  yes , but it have n't been used as a symbol for your country ( who , strictly speaking have n't been an independent nation for a while ) every day since the 14th century . 
  i am not saying it is not old , nor that there are no older symbols than the danish flag . 
  however , the danish flag is the oldest , national flag that has been constantly in use . 
  thanks , did n't think of that . 
  do you know where that expression comes from ( or at least who made it popular ) ? 
  ernst hugo j\u00e4reg\u00e5rd , in the wonderful danish tv show `` riget '' , by lars von trier . 
  he was an evil swedish doctor who used to go up to the roof of '' `` riget '' ( rigshospitalet ) and look at barseb\u00e4ck . 
  he then held this beautiful monologue :-) . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yltuky9fv9y ) . 
  god , i miss ernst hugo . 
  it does in swedish as well . 
  it comes from when you made your own butter , it floated to the surface in little chunks who looked like swimming geese . 
  we do n't use that anymore ... . . sweden wanted to get out of that union pretty quick :-) . 
  ah , thanks . 
  i think it has to be in constant use , and franco sort of killed that for you guys , if i know my spanish history correctly . 
  i think it is a bit weird dining people , but it is good it is not implemented . 
  no , the scandinavian languages are extremely similar . 
  also , the beginning is the same - sm\u00f6r , which means butter . 
  but where would you then go to buy alcohol and food ? 
  what happens if you do not vote ? 
  the danes are always confusing .
