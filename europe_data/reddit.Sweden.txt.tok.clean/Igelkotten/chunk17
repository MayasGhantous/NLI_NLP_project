  edit : mordkommissionen is called unit one in english . 
  yes , but this is apparantly what the eurozone wants . 
  otherwise they would change it . 
  however they refuse to . 
  i find that confusing . 
  i would n't want this . 
  whoever bribes the best . 
  sad but true . 
  so , sorry norway , china will get this one . 
   ide if the law is followed is exactly what courts are for . 
  exactly , but that is not the case if there is some backroom dealing - is there like the person i answered to suspected . 
   consensus building over confrontation is nothing the eu , or this continent has `` come to '' but is part of european culture . 
  in germany it is for sure . 
  one do not build consensus about following the law . 
  either you do , or you do n't . 
  and it was clear that the courts said the bond buying scheme did not follow it . 
   jurisdiction is n't supposed to be democratic . 
  it 's done in courts not by parliaments . 
  the laws that one is suppose to follow is suppose to be accepted in a democratically elected parlament . 
  no they ca n't . 
  we have said no . 
  give me a scientific reason as to why germany ca n't solve their own problems ? 
  it is just political - they should just solve it . 
  ok - again . 
  you honestly do not seem to know the difference between the eu and the ez . 
  i said the * eurozone * . 
  and yes - countries are forced to join if they want to join the eu . 
  so all your arguments are invalid . 
  the fact that you do not know or care to differentiate between the two says a lot about you and how you view things . 
  do you know the difference because you never seem to care ? 
  again - i said being outside of the ** euro ** . 
  and - one does n't have to be a scholar to listen to scholars !, 
  i am not an economic scholar - does that mean i ca n't listen to them ? 
  no of course not , i listen to advice from professionals all the time . 
  as do you i suspect . 
  because the scholars says it is better being outside of the euro . 
  the scholars also says it is a very badly constructed currency union . 
  those are facts . 
  all the advantages you mentioned were inside your head - not factual . 
  if they were factual - why ca n't scholars prove them ? 
  do again - is it better being outside the ** euro ** ( not the eu ) or not ? 
  i would care - a lot . 
  you do n't like being under england - well how would you like to be under a far more ineffective currency union who lacks the most basic tools for a currency union and is heading towards a depressio ? . 
  add to that , that a currency union in order to be effective have to have stuff like shared debt , permanent transfers and common political and fiscal policy . 
  so - are you looking forward to paying off greece 's debt , forever transferring money down south and following germany 's lead when it comes to interest rates ? 
  how is that being independent ? 
  the economist is english . 
  and i remember the article , but if i recall correctly it was about how energy prices was hurting germany . 
  i agree however , the eu need to recruit more climate fighters . 
  i also think one has to continue going for renewables and nuclear instead but i am not sure that alone will solve the competition problem . 
   i just finished it , thank you . 
  yes , it 's not scientifically impossible for sure . 
  but many germans are just afraid of the `` dangerous radiation thingy '' . 
      this sentence from the article sums it up nicely : `` knowledge is the best measure against fear '' ( `` wissen ist das beste mittel gegen die angst '' ) i know , and that is why it is so frustrating to talk to germans about atomm\u00fcll - we have so different backgrounds . 
  i have argued with at least six people in this thread that `` one ca n't take care of the atomm\u00fcll '' . 
  sure one can , maybe not like sweden , but of course a proper scientific solution can be found . 
  however - germany seem to have a political deadlock - everyone just randomly are against it , so no solutions can be found . 
  finland are storing their too for hundred of thousands of years . 
  not like we do , but a finnish solution . 
  i think that germany can get that too - but the politics is somehow paralyzing the science . 
   but many germans are just afraid of the `` dangerous radiation thingy '' . 
  why ? 
  i mean , germans are an educated bunch and i do n't really do n't know any other nuclear country that is so afraid of nuclear . 
  i am aware of that . 
  i am also aware of the fact that you germans voted for them in the last election , and the election before that . 
  so , do not say that germany ca n't . 
  say that you wo n't . 
  germany have n't bothered to solve it , because it is , which sweden and finland are living proofs of - solvable . 
  germany , and the majority of the germans just do n't want to . 
  and - please , do n't even dare to lecture me on atomm\u00fcll again . 
  i live closer to and endlager than you probably ever will . 
  i have cousins living close to it . 
  and we have no shit leaking out in our water . 
  that is all germany . 
   i ca n't do a shit about it because i 'm not a politian or engineer or anything . 
  only thing i know is that there is nuclear waste leaking into the ground , and , i 'll repeate myself , i do n't want that . 
  ** germany 's ** nuclear waste leaks into the ground becasue you are to lazy to fix it . 
  so stop saying that you can not . 
  say that you can - but the germans do n't want to , because the germans do n't want to fix the problem , they want leaking nuclear . 
  do n't say you ca n't - say you wo n't . 
  and stop using excuses that we `` ca n't take care of the nuclear waste '' . 
  say `` we are to fucking lazy to deal with it so we rather use coal and ruin the climate '' . 
  because that is the truth . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.geekosystem.com/coal-oil-nuclear-deaths-chart/ ) and now i have given you links . 
  i want links too - that it is scientifically impossible for germany to take care of nuclear . 
  otherwise it is just germany being whiny . 
  why ca n't you do like finland or sweden - fix it ? 
  it is not solved ** for you don * t want to ** . 
  not because it is impossible . 
  in short - because germany ca n't get their fucking political act together you choose to add to climate change instead of finding a solution . 
  and - all this time arguing with me you said there was none . 
  i proved you wrong -  we ca n't . 
  we just ca n't . 
  you can . 
  you have a political standstill , not a scientific one . 
  so do n't blame science , do n't say there are no solutions . 
  i have showed you one - finland can show you another . 
  so get your fucking act together and fix it . 
  it is the politics that does n't work - the science is sound . 
   you know that approxamately over a million people died longterm ?
