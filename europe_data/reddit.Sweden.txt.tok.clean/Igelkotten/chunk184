  how many species that get extinct every year ? 
  the climate change that you like , and want to contribute to - what sort of person wants to contribute to climate change ? 
  this is what it says in eurostat about police officers . 
  [ link ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/glossary:police_officer ) [ here is the link to the original eurostat page ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/crime_statistics ), 
  and , right after aftonbladet you will have [ expressen ] ( http://www.expressen.se/ ) . 
  the top news on expressen today is about a pregnant swedish singer , princess madeleine 's husband and a missing norwegian woman in greece . 
  things like syria , economics or just well written articles does not exists in expressen/aftonbladet 's universe . 
   while coal is simple . 
  yes it is - it has * confirmed deaths every year * and it is proven * beyond doubt * that it adds to climate change . 
  none of that is the case with nuclear . 
   so shame on you for killing nearly every swede in several nuclear meltdowns next year . 
  thank god no one important will get hurt . 
  shame on you if anyone cared . 
  are you honestly shaming me for what might happen , * in theory * ? 
  you do not know the difference between real life and fantasy , do you ? 
   barsebaek had lots of problems and near melt downs several times . 
  nuclear plants contaminates the surrounding area heavily while pollution from coal is not concentrated . 
  why do you want your children to have tentacles ? 
  are you evil in general or just swedish evil ? 
  this just proves that you are scientificlly ignorant as well as an idiot . 
  nuclear fallot/accidents etc does not make anyone grow tentacles . 
  if you actually had any clue nuclear power you would know that . 
   so shame on you for killing nearly every swede in several nuclear meltdowns next year . 
  thank god no one important will get hurt . 
  shame on you if anyone cared . 
  are you a complete idiot - do you honestly not know the difference between what ** is ** happening , at this very moment and what might happen in ** theory ** ? 
  also , even the worst accident killed 4000 - hardly anything compared to coal . 
  ** you ** are ruining the planet , at this very moment . 
  i am not . 
  ** you ** do not care one bit about the ecosystem . 
  you have no base in reality whatsoever , and is scientifically ignorant as well as an environmental destroyer . 
  yes , that is probably it , thank you . 
  does anyone know why cyprus have such high numbers ? 
  probably as an comparison . 
  it is mostly europe though . 
  the numbers are from eurostat .

  of course wind , sun etc is better - but no country is getting all their power from that , in particular not germany and denmark . 
  and , how is adding to climate change and having far more emissions solving the problem ? 
  do you really need me to tell you everything that is wrong with climate change ? 
  what gives germany and denmark the right to release that much co2 and destroy the climate ? 
  what you want to give to the children is a changed climate , ruined ecosystem , extinct species , melted ice - thank you for that !, 
  how on earth can you say that it is better . 
  why do you want to fuck up the world with that - and for my children too ? 
  and , you are n't even mentioning the deaths from coal - compare that with the fact that there are very few from nuclear and hardly any emissions . 
  you talk about deaths that might possible happen , but ignoring those who die every single day from coal . 
  if you compare solar power to nuclear , of corse solar is better . 
  but we are comparing coal to nuclear and in no way is coal better . 
  this of you who use it destroy the climate , irreversibly for the whole world . 
  shame on you . 
  correct me if i am wrong but is n't berlin one of those provinces that receives money from other `` bundesl\u00e4nder '' ? 
  how do they feel about this ? 
  well , we are taking vare of that . 
  and please , can you explain to me how you are focusing on renewable when you have far less of it than sweden ? 
  i think you have 25 % wind , max . 
  how is that focusing on renewable ? 
  furthermore , i would like for you ( i am an environmentalist ) to extensively explain to me what right you have to release the massive amounts of co2 that you are releasing ? 
  why are you ruining for everybody ? 
  you could do it differently you know . 
  why do not denmark care about the emissions ? 
  also , are you seriously defending coal instead of nuclear ? 
  so , explain what you like with it ? 
  the emissions ? 
  the deaths ? 
  the ruining of the environment ? 
  frankly , that fact that you can defend the danish policy is idiotic . 
  most of you energy comes from coals , which fucks up the environment for everybody . 
  sweden 's is almost emission free , and we have . 
  plan for our nuclear waste ? 
  how is denmark going to take care of its co2 ? 
  how are you going to fix the climate change which you are contributing to ? 
  i 'd like for you to answer me on all on my questions please , with links . 
  i am at the university ( studying environmental issues ) so do n't worry about academic journals . 
  ok , sorry , then i misunderstood . 
  coal miners seems to die like flies in china , unfortunately . 
  however , in eu we have as far as i know zero deaths from cancer from nuclear plants ( it is possible some stupid guy fell , hit his head and died ) . 
  we have at least 22 000 deaths / year and billions of health costs etc from coal ( and possible several deaths in coal mines ) so , my argument still stands . 
  to even consider abandoning nuclear power there has to be more than 22 00 deaths / year due to nuclear . 
  in addition , countries like denmark and germany are adding to the co2 emissions far more than countries like sweden and france , thus adding to climate change . 
  do n't you agree ? 
  i do n't really understand what you want to argue about . 
  do you want more coal and less nuclear ? 
  but these death has nothing to do with cancer , nor are they near 22 000 year . 
  how is this relevant , at all ? 
  nor are they proving zero deaths , which you asked me to prove . 
  a ) are they dying because of radioactivity or because they stumble and hit they their heads b ) it is still not relevant to the discussion of coal vs nuclear c ) how many coal worker die per year ? 
  source for what ? 
  you can not prove a negative . 
  instead prove there has been death ( and , to make it relevant to the debate , several thousands/year ) and prove me wrong . 
  tell the rest of the other danes . 
  first you force us to take it down , then you take us to court and make a majority of the swedes pay more for our electricity . 
  in addition , the danes spew out co2 using coal and adding to climate change and ruining the climate for everybody ( lot more than the swedes ) , while still hating nuclear . 
  seriously , i like danes and have danish family , but when it comes to energy i really wish the danes would really start changing their attitude . 
  i do think most of our energy that we import comes from norway/finland though , so i hope it is not to much coal :-) . 
  yes , i know about tjernobyl . 
  that is also why i wrote the eu , not europe , because i knew someone would bring up tjernobyl . 
  however , 4000 deaths in 1986 is far , far less than + 22000 deaths/year , every single year !, 
  basically , we could have five tjernobyls/year and still come out on top . 
  and then we have n't even considered climate change and the additional costs and deaths associated with that . 
  however , that might even out with the nuclear fallout perhaps .
