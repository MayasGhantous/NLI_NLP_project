  they are supporting non elected officials breaking the law - every day . 
  so , as i see it , why on earth would i want to be part of that . 
  also , your username sounds swedish . 
  if you are , you belong to those 12 % and is probably a fp . 
  it is still failed , which you denied . 
  you also claimed that they were following the treaties , and i would like for you to explain how they are following it . 
  and - giving more power to organisations that outright ignore the will of the people and democratic procedures is extremely dangerous . 
  have we voted about the ecb new way ? 
  they are not elected , they are supposed to follow the law . 
  who gave them the right to ignore the law ? 
  that would hardly improve with more eu , would it ? 
  it would be more non elected people making decisions they are not supposed to . 
  and , my voice , and yours would mean less . 
  yes . 
  we even voted to keep it . 
  it was stupid though , our cars were not left hand sided cars . 
  but , we saw the error if our ways and started being right :-) . 
  it is of course not the left or right side , it is the wrong side and the right side :-) . 
  i ca n't choose one , really , but if i 'd recommend a few books for someone who wished to explore swedish modern literature beyond our crime writers i 'd say for example * [ the visit of a royal physician ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_visit_of_the_royal_physician ) by [ p.o. 
  engqvist ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/per_olov_enquist ) . 
  he has written several good books . 
  it has also been made into a movie recently . 
  * another author that i loved as a teenager was [ marianne fredriksson ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marianne_fredriksson ) . 
  try `` the nightwanderer '' . 
  * oh , perhaps a bit old , but i have always loved the book [ the long ships ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_long_ships ) by frans g bengtsson . 
  it follows the travels and adventures of the viking orm ( snake ) , who is called red snake because of his hair and temper . 
  i personally like [ carsten jensen ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carsten_jensen ) og [ peter hoeg ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peter_h%c3%b8eg ) for example . 
  then you have some crime writers as well , i am just reading jussi adler olsen , he is ok , but not someone i would recommend as the best danish book ever . 
  kirkegaard and hc andersen are always reliable i guess :-) . 
  thank you , it is interesting to hear your input . 
  regarding immigration , the most clashes i see is when their culture clashes with the swedish one . 
  for example , a lot of people , including me , are concerned with some immigration schools because of what they teach , how they look at women , gay , jews etc. 
  you are not allowed to teach against homosexuality and against the armenian genocide , or teach that women are inferior for example . 
  for example , a turkish school in sweden is not allowed to deny the genocide or teach that women are inferior ( not that i know if turkish schools do that , but some muslim schools do ) . 
  then they should not be allowed to have schools - it is actually the law , but they do not always follow it . 
  some people see that as discriminatory that they can not teach what they want - i do n't . 
  just today a high swedish politician , omar mustafa was forced to leave , since his party basically fired him . 
  they did this that after they elected him , they found out that before he had invited and supported famous anti-gay muslims and anti-jewish muslims , islamic preachers . 
  also , his organisations think there should be one law for men , one for women . 
  he said he was being discriminated against because he is a muslim . 
  i ( and everyone t the swedish board ) think it is because he is an ass and if he does n't believe in equality he should leave , he had nothing to do in that party or in politics . 
  that happens a lot . 
  some ass want to keep being an ass , and hides it behind a `` otherwise you are discriminating me '' attitude . 
  and , of course attitudes towards gays , women etc. ... 
  so , if you want to be turkish - fine , but why apply for swedish citizenship and if you want to live here they should respect not only the law , but human rights , like gay rights , women 's right 's etc. 
  some immigrants do not always do that . 
  a lot do though . 
  so , if the netherlands do not follow the budget rules , are they going to pay the fine then , or are we skipping the fines again ? 
  ok , i read it , then i missed it , sorry . 
   t 's a political question now more than discriminatory . 
  i could cite many reasons deniers cite here from semantics to content , but you 'll have to excuse me for not playing the devil 's advocate for this for the third time this month . 
  let 's just stick to the subject of active discrimination towards minorities and immigrants today . 
  well , i think it is enormously discriminating against the aremenians * today * , denying them their history , and rights . 
  and , actively fighting against them , asking other countries to deny them too , as evident by the turkish behaviour when they ask other countries to deny it too . 
  and for the political reasons - it certainly brings turkey no friends abroad . 
  i can not believe that a country that claims to pretend about human rights * denies the genocide they have commited * . 
  how on earth can you defend that ? 
  it is outrageous . 
   there were certainly despicable policies towards kurds and their language in the past , but the government and the official attitude has changed now . 
  why would you blame the current government and policies for the mistakes of the past that were acknowledged and remedied ? 
  honestly , you make it sounds like it is something ancient - it is in my lifetime , it is very recent . 
  and , i am sceptic of turkey trying to fix their past either - as is evident when it comes to the armenian genocide that the turks commited . 
  also , the politicans , active in turkey today , have discriminated actively against the kurds . 
  that does not just change overnight . 
  i have to say though , it does seem that turkey is making progress with regards to kurds , and kudos for that . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,marp,,tur,4562d8b62,469f3add1e,0.html ) are links to prove my point - it is not something ancient . 
  [ link ] ( http://latitude.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/05/kurds-and-the-turkish-way/ ) , [ link ] ( http://www.democracynow.org/2010/8/23/exclusive_us_journalist_deported_from_turkey ) , [ link 2 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_rights_of_kurdish_people_in_turkey ) . 
  according to these links , there is still discrimination , organised such . 
  are you saying there is none ? 
  so , have public turkish officials acknowledged , and officially apologized to the kurds ? 
  when you say remedied - are you saying that there is no more discrimination ? 
  no more economic discrimination at all , every document is in kurdish , there are kurdish univiersities , the turkish state is giving money to end the discrimination etc. 
  specifiy what you mean with remedied , because i honestly do not think the turkish state is quite there yet . 
   yes , there are actually more kurdish-origin mps by ratio than there are in the population at large . 
  we had a kurdish president ( turgut \u00d6zal ) back when pkk was active at its peak with mass civillian killings . 
  kurdish origin is not quite the same really - have all of them always had the oppurtunity to be openly kurdish ? 
  cool however about the president though , did n't know that . 
   he issue the government used to take with kurds was n't with the kurdish origin of anyone , it was with increasing demands for a national identity separate from that of a nation state , and the separatist ambitions . 
  not every kurd wanted a separate state or refused the turkish identity , and those became equal and successful parts of the nation state . 
  allowing kurds to deal with all official matters in kurdish would leave no need for them to learn turkish and ` integrate ' to the nation state , increasing the need for a separate state . 
  this is understandably not desirable , but the policies used to enforce this were ridiculous . 
  that has changed now , and further changes are coming up . 
  other countries , like finland/canada/spain etc manages to deal with this issue . 
  there are no perfect solutions of course , but the turkish solution have been brutal . 
  are you still not allowed to insult attat\u00fcrk btw or deny turkey and stuff like that ( not that it has anything to do with the kurds , just interested  let 's say your pick of a western european country and demands for education in native language , local governance or change of citizenship definition to not involve the nation in question . 
  well , the difference is that the kurds have been in turkey for quite a while , have n't they ? 
  are you even sure that you were first ? 
  i have no problems with turkey denying finns the right to have a finnish university etc , if the finns started to move to turkey * en masse * . 
  however , if there is a finnish school that follow the turkish curriculum , do you have a problem with that ? 
  and , as for your question , i can answer for sweden . 
  every student get a certain sum of money , `` attached '' by the government , and they can then go to a private or government school . 
  if the turks want to start a turkish school they can do that , and have the education in turkish . 
  howver , they have to fulfill the swedish rules for a school as in teaching certain things , equality , learning swedish , math , biology etc. 
  if the turks in sweden have a problem with the curriculum , they have the same rights as everyone else to try to get the parlament to change it . 
  so , basically , the turks in sweden have the same rights as i do . 
  can you honestly say it is completely the same for in turkey , for everyone ? 
  i 'm just calling you out on your bias . 
  which bias ? 
  i think turkey is much more discriminating than we are against minorities , and i think i am right there , do n't you ? 
  i mean , i know turkey is making progress and i think you should have a lot of kudos for that ( kudos !!!!!!!,
