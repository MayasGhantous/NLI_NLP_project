  why is the military a `` better '' department than sida ? 
  do n't you think people can get in trouble for helping them ? 
   is it a problem to make specific laws which are applied to asylum seekers who have worked for sweden in the past ? 
  if any of these people are in danger because they have helped us then it is our moral responsibility to give them protection . 
  afghanistan is special because we are `` peacekeeping '' there . 
  the farmer in albania is not going to be tortured by terrorists because he is albanian and supposedly working for foreign military . 
  this discussion is not about `` immigration policy in general '' ; it 's about helping people who have helped us . 
  yes , he might , although it might not be terrorist ( besides , what is a terririst ? ) . 
  the albania mafia is superstrong , and he might just disappear . 
  just as the brazilian journalist that tried to protect the rainforest with the swedish environmental agency , or why not any chinese , ever , who might end up in `` camp '' for talking to a swede . 
  basically , sweden is active in over 100 countries . 
  most of those countries are very bad , and do not respect human rights . 
  what you are saying that everyone , ever , who has in any way connected with a official swede in all these countries , should stay in sweden - despite the law being different . 
  apart from that you honestly seem extremely naive to the ways of the world , democracy , i ca n't even begin to understand how you would not only write that law , but also get it through riksdagen . 
  that attitude is so naive so no one but mp and v would vote for it . 
   this discussion is not about `` immigration policy in general '' ; it 's about helping people who have helped us . 
  you honestly do not seem to understand , and i do not know if you are young or you are refusing to understand . 
  the laws that we make with regards to asylum policy * are * general . 
  all the laws that we make * are * general . 
  that is even one of the basic rules of the legal system - all are the same in front of the law . 
  otherwise we would make one law for me , one law for you , and a third law for person x. 
  that would not work . 
  you do not seem to get that . 
  the same goes for every asylum seeker . 
  we do * not * make exceptions for people who has worked for sweden , just as we do make other exceptions in the law . 
  we do not say `` oh , you worked for the government ? 
  well , then it is ok to beat up your wife '' - we do not say that , because that would be sick and a travesty of justice . 
  you however want us to say - `` oh , you helped the swedish government , well , then you get a special law '' . 
  we paid these people - that does not entitle them to live in sweden forever . 
  you honestly think the law does not apply to government employees , it is so weird . 
  honestly , you are very frustrating . 
   it 's not ministerstyre , the parliament can reject such a bill . 
  however , the only party whom i believe would reject such a bill are the sweden democrats . 
  i just ca n't see v , s , and mp rejecting such a bill . 
  if the ** only ** persons who could use that law were afghani interpretors , it ** is ** ministerstyre . 
  don ' y you see that ? 
  honestly , is that so hard to understand . 
  the bill that would have to be made , would be a much , much wider one . 
  one , that says for example , that * anyone who has cooperated with any swedish governmental agency and as a consequence of that might be in trouble , is eligeble for asylum . 
  that would mean for example that anyone in contact with sida , who * might * according to themselves , be in trouble for that afterwards , can stay . 
  do you know how many thousands that would be ? 
  houndred of thousands perhaps ? 
  do you think that would work otherwise , can you explain why the interpretors in afghanistan are more in danger than the journalist in brazil ( who cooperated with our environmental agency ) or the doctor in congo ( who worked with sida ) ? 
  i would like you to answer that . 
  second - i would also like you to answer why the military is more important ? 
  do you have any legal precedence why it is so ? 
  otherwise , someone who has worked with any official swede , abroad , might be eligable for asylum . 
  that means that people from + 100 countries are eligeble for asylum in sweden . 
  is that what you mean ? 
  or , explain again , why they interpretors are more special , you have not sufficiently done so . 
  so , for the last time - if the law can only be used by interpretors it is not a law that we should have . 
  it is a stupid law . 
  and , again - it would be ministerstyre and bad governing . 
  so , what you essentially are saying is that anyone , anywhere , who has worked with official swedes , should be eligelbel for asylum - that is the law you want ? 
  and please , at least try to understand how the law work and that you can not write special laws for afghani interpretors . 
  well , you suggest ministerstyre . 
  that is opposed to swedish law . 
  also , if we make a law just for the interpreters , that is also ministerstyre , just so you know . 
  do you want ministerstyre in sweden ? 
   do i need other examples ? 
  these people are at huge risk and a big part of that is because they are helping us . 
  we owe it to them . 
  `` very close '' does n't cut it . 
  a milj\u00f6partist can put a motion about it and they are in opposition . 
  so , apply then like everyone else , but swedish law do not recognise anything `` special '' about them `` helping '' us . 
  we do not have that . 
  if you want the judges in migrationsdomstolen to ignore the law , you must be ok with judges everywhere to ignore the law . 
  so , do you think judges should follow the law or not ? 
   because many of these interpreters are minorities and because they helped us . 
  these people are now at greater risk because of us . 
  i really do n't see why there is a problem at helping people whom have helped us . 
  or do you want to discuss immigration policy in general because i 'm not interested in that discussion ? 
  but that is the mistake you make . 
  the law is made to be applied `` in general '' and then you * have * to be able to motivate why these people are in more danger than for example the farmers who helped the sida personal in congo , or the doctor who aided sida in sudan . 
  just because you do not want to discuss it - well , it again says a lot of how you think you the law should be applied . 
  apperently , you do not understand basic law . 
  so , again , with links and good explanations , why are these people so special compared to the farmer in albania , etc. 
   it does n't take a lot of critical thinking to understand that minorities in afghanistan who are cooperating with swedish or any other foreign military is at grave risk . 
  if we ( or any other western country ) were never in afghanistan then this person could have been at less risk or at no risk at all . 
  if he dies or gets tortured because he was helping us then it 's our fault if we have not offered him ( or rejected ) asylum . 
  sweden is indebted to people who risk their lives to help us . 
  this is why they are special . 
  i think sida is in around 60 countries , and swedish , as a country is active in even more . 
  should everyone , in those countries be eligeble for asylum that cooperates with us ? 
  why is the military special , why afghanistan ? 
  more peopel die in congo , for example . 
   the government still have the power to propose new laws . 
  we even have a minister who is responsible for immigration policy . 
  if they want this to happen then it will happen . 
  the minority government . 
  and , your quote `` if they want this to happen then it will happen '' sounds like your really , really like ministerstyre . 
  is that what you want ? 
  should government base their whole policy , and should swedish law that affects millions be based on this ? 
   what type of reply do you expect when you ask if i think everybody should follow the law ? 
  that you would say whether you think so or not . 
  do you ? 
  mine means `` the hedgehog '' . 
  i had just discussed hedgehodges when i chose my username . 
  i also like hedgehodges . 
  exactly , we have the same .
