  well , if a norweigan asks you about `` forspiel '' , you know now they are not rude , just do not know how to say `` f\u00f6rfest '' :-) . 
   why ca n't there be a law passed in parliament which adds an exemption to foreigners who have worked for the military a permanent residence ? 
  i 'm not an expert on how riksdagen works but is it wrong to assume that members of parliament can propose new laws or motions ? 
  a ) that would not change the situation for the interpretors , at all . 
  a new law does n't change the situation for people who `` sentence '' / decision etc , has already been decided . 
  as in , if i get sentenced to 4 year , and they later on pass a new law that my crime would actually be 14 year , it does not change the fact for me . 
  only `` new '' criminals ( in my example ) would receive 14 year . 
  the law is not retroactive . 
  b ) passing a law ** only ** for afghanistani interpretors would be very close to `` ministerstyre anyway . 
  or , do you have a lot of other examples of interpretors that are seeking asylum ? 
  c ) you would have to motivate why interpretors deserve protection much more than any other profession , for example doctors , females in any profession in some areas , environmentalists , journalists etc d ) it would have to be something that could be applied to the whole world - otherwise it would be very , very close to making a law just for these people , which would be unfair , and ministerstyre . 
  e ) of all the departments/avdelningarna in sweden , why should we take particular care of the ones who work with the military ? 
  i 'd like for you to give me citations and explain , why the military is unique , in comparison to other departements , like sida for example . 
  or , do you mean that anyone who has also worked with sida and migh , according to their own word , be in trouble afterwards , should automatically receive asylum ? 
  should anyone , abroad , who has worked with anyone from the swedish states , automatically receive asylum . 
  why are these people so special ? 
  why are not other peopel special ? 
  i 'd like explanaition and links please . 
   i did n't say that the minister him or herself should hand-pick the interpreters who get asylum . 
  and of course nobody should follow the law ; fuck the system . 
  / s you specifically , in your first answer , referred to the minister . 
  as in `` there are some politicians in sweden who do n't want to give permanent residence to our translators . '', 
   and of course nobody should follow the law ; fuck the system . 
  / s well , that says more about you , than anything . 
  oh , so you do n't know of the `` hattifnattar '' in the mumintrolls . 
  your name sounds a bit like it . 
  [ wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hattifattener ) . 
  [ this is what they look like , and how a lot of finns/swedes probably picture you ] ( http://cdn1.cdnme.se/cdn/9-1/715802/images/2009/hatti_1207491331_3060738_61876435.gif ) :-), 
  haha , good to know , so you do not make any mistakes . 
  i 've had some misunderstandings about the norweigan `` forspiel '' , which means `` pre-party '' in norweigan , and foreplay in swedish . 
  a norweigan guy asked me how the `` forspiel '' was . 
  i got irritated and asked what sort of girl he though i was . 
  i yelled . 
  he got confused . 
  then we laughed . 
  so , same as us , almost . 
  we also say `` kissemiss '' . 
  is n't hezbollah a bit like the former ira and sinn fein ? 
  ( yes , i know i 'll be attacked by angry brits/irish people , but hear me out ) . 
  does n't it have a few different branches , and can it not be of value to have a dialogue with a least some of those branches ? 
  i mean , ultimately what we are striving for is i guess peace in the middle east . 
  is peace in the middle east best served by us putting hezbollah on the terror list ? 
  i listened to a few bbc programs about hezbollah and while israel and the us hated them , i was glad to hear some more nuanced voices about them , as well . 
  here is one program from the bbc about the hezbollah - [ analysis ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b015n05l ) . 
  so , you are saying that , that the minister , should make a law , * to adjust to individual person , and to override what the judges already has decided , in this individual case * . 
  do you want all our ministers to do that ? 
  if the minister for environment do not like the law that the environmental judges passes in this one big case , she just makes a new one , so the company will not be affected ? 
  if beatrice ask does n't like the sentence , in this one case , she orders new laws ? 
  that would mean chaos . 
  i think it will mean corruption . 
  do n't you agree ? 
  do n't you think ministers , as well as * everyone * should respect , and follow swedish laws ? 
  probably . 
  kisse is something one can say `` generically '' for cats , as in `` look , a little `` kisse '' . 
  wonder what the danes/norwegians say . 
  they can not . 
  that would be `` ministerstyre '' . 
  we have chosen that sort of method of governing that our ministers * can not * go in and govern in individual cases , that would be * ministerstyre * . 
  it is decided by migrationsdomstolen . 
  do you think it would be ok if ministers could govern over the court and judges and tell them what to decide ? 
  or , should everyone , ministers included , follow the law ? 
  kisse . 
  it is also what you use for calling for a cat you do not know the name of . 
  `` kisskisskisskisskiss '' ... . . ca n't explain it , ca n't defend it . 
  are you a hattifnatt ? 
  that is what we call them in swedish . 
  did n't tove jansson write them in swedish btw ? 
  i love mumintrollen btw . 
  exactly . 
  your last name is made up from your fathers first name . 
  it is swedish , used now and before for excessive drinking . 
  of course i have . 
  - free from memory , might not be completely correct . 
  since the son might be named eskil sigurjonson , the grandchild might be named eskilson . 
  i wonder if we could start using it again . 
  i can imagine that it is one of those things that will be removed if someone challenged it in court . 
  anyway , an icelander i know did n't do that with his children , they just inherited his last name . 
  i asked him why , but he said it did n't matter that much to him , and they were also half swedish . 
  he speaks icelandic to them though . 
   van den berg ( `` from the mountain '' ) . 
  hmm , if there is one thing i have never thought the netherlands in connection with , it is mountains :-) . 
  thanks . 
  yes . 
  they also have a fairly strict law about it with only a handful of exceptions , as far as i know . 
  source , icelandic friend . 
  so , if you do n't know the father you can use the mothers name ? 
  that is good . 
  how do icelanders do if they change gender ? 
  iceland is rather cool with their surnames . 
  they take the fathers name , and add - son or - daughter to it . 
  so , if your fathers name is sigurjon , your last name becomes sigurjonson or sigurjonsdottir depending on your gender . 
  i imagine that gives them a bit more surnames than it ordinarily would . 
  it is called [ patronymic ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/patronymic ) . 
  btw , icelandic people - how do you do if you a ) do not know who the father is , or b ) change gender ? 
  i do n't know how it is in other countries , but i rarely go to a bathing site when i go swimming or bathing . 
  i mean , we are nine million people , a country the size of germany with over 100 000 lakes and a long coastline . 
  i prefer not being on the beach ( not that we really have that many , it is mostly in sk\u00e5ne / scania ) where it is crowded , but being a bit more `` alone '' . 
  even in the center of stockholm , where i live you can actually accomplish this ( not being completely alone , but not lying next to a gazillion others ) . 
  and , if you get outside the cities , it is not really hard at all . 
  what i mean is that i have never really payed attention to our beaches , since i am rarely there , nor are they of huge importance to our economy , like the tourist beaches for cyprus for example .
