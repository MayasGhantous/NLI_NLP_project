  between those who have to ask for money and those who have to give money . 
  do n't worry though , perhaps more countries in the future will need bailouts , and the divide will be less clear . 
  or , perhaps we should worry about that . 
  it is a well defined concept . 
  it is measured in labour costs per unit . 
  i said between 20-30 % because it is different ( obviously ) between different countries ( i think greece had 30 , spain i think had 20 ) . 
   the unification and same currency were not the reason the former ddr economy collapsed i have never said the economy in the giips countries has collapsed . 
  your word , not mine . 
  nor have i said that the economy in the ddr collapsed . 
  please , read what i wrote . 
  you seem to have all these preconceived notions , that are not correct . 
  again , loss in competititiveness.please , link to where i wrote collapsed . 
  ** i said that there was a loss in internal competitiveness ** . 
  both in the ( former ddr ) and in giips countries ( actually not so sure about ireland ) . 
  and , ** that it was happens in currency unions when the economies are too diverse ** . 
  can you prove me wrong instead ? 
  i have referred to the labour cost/unit between 1999-2008 with portugal/greece/spain and i just had an example for you how ddr agriculture would have suffered a loss in internal competitiveness . 
  can you tell me what is wrong with those examples instead ? 
  you do not seem to be aware of what i am trying to convey , or how one measures competitiveness , you are just hung up about the ddr . 
  please , explain then what what is wrong with my examples . 
  i honestly do not even understand how the ddr could * not * have suffered from loss in internal competitiveness , since * the cost were rising but the output was not * . 
  so , please , explain then for example how the ddr agriculture did not suffer from internal competitiveness . 
  the only thing i can come up with is , that if they , within a year , became just as productive as the brd . 
  however , that is extremely unlikely . 
  i have never written collapse , until now . 
  sigh , i took the ddr economy as an example , because there is a currency union europeans can remember or relate to . 
  the fact is , the theory is the same , even if you take the us , the pound , the euro , the swizz franc , the south african rand etc. 
  once , there was a swedish politician who jokingly suggested that everything north of dal\u00e4lven ( a river in sweden ) were to have its own currency . 
  so , if you join very different economies ( like greece/germany , ddr/brd , economy a and economy b - the * loss in internal competitiveness will happen * . 
  that is what i am trying to say . 
  i was illustrating this with the fact that it also happened in the ddr , * however * , to point out that it does not necessarily have to be lazy , irresponsible southerners that experience a loss in internal competitiveness . 
  however , the ddr was helped , enormously by the trillions they have received from the brd ( west germany ) which is something the south/giips countries can not benefit from ( btw , the ddr still receive about $ 100 billion euros from the brd ) . 
  i was making a parallell , with another currency union . 
  are you saying that there is no theory behind currency unions , and the ddr had absolutely no loss in internal competitiveness when they joined with brd ? 
  of course they are not * exactly * the same , but no currency unions are . 
  if you want * identical stuff * , you have to go to mathemathics , and you can not , ever , have any political or economical theory . 
  the problem is that excessive spending is n't the only reason the giips countries are in the situation they are . 
  it is not only excessive spending that have put them in this situation . 
  when they joined the eurozone , the competetiveness sank with somethings along the line of 20-30 % between 1999-2008 ( eurostat ) . 
  so , their competitiveness is also sinking , and it is not because they are idiots/lazy/crazy spenders , it is what happens when you join too diverse economies , it is economics 101 . 
  normally , apart from the fact that they competitiveness would n't fall so fast , the country would counteract by manipulating the interest rate/currency . 
  however , that way is is closed , they are doing what they can by cutting the costs ( to become more competitive ) , however , this is hard , due to the prices ( which , incidentelly have also risen since 1999 ) . 
  add to that , their unemployment numbers in what can almost be described as a social disaster , and you see that is not just that easy . 
  i am not saying that they should not cut costs , and in particular the greek people seemed to have had really excessive spending habits . 
  however , that was n't always the case with all of them ( spain for example comes to mind ) and it is also a question of how much is it possible to cut the costs . 
  it is also vital to understand that the loss in competitiveness is not due to laziness and corruption ( although i would say that the corruption was and is a serious hindrance , above all to italy and greece , in everything they do ) but something that happens when a currency union is formed . 
  compare it to east/west germany , when they joined in a currency union . 
  the competitiveness in the ddr sank , immediately , while prices etc was rising . 
  this was not because each and ever ddr person was a lazy corrupt person , but because it is what happens when you join a currency . 
  however , the german government offset that by trillions in transfers , to make sure that they had the basic healthcare/school/unemployment benfits/pension etc , + tinvestmetns + they did n't really have to worry about banks and debt . 
  so , for southern europe to have a fighting chance , they need more transfers + a debt reconstruction . 
  however , that is obviously not going down well with the north who ( correctly ) states that they never voted for this . 
  as i see it , either a few countries ( the south or germany ) will leave at some point , or the transfers will become bigger and permanent . 
  however , saying that the reason the south is in the state it is in , just because they have spent to much , is not really grasping the complications behind the euro . 
  they are mainly there , because of the incorrectly constructed euro . 
  add to that , a global credit crises , and in some cases over spending and corruption , and you have a perfect storm . 
  we did n't have much of a choice before , i guess . 
  if it is really cold for a long time , you can not be picky about what you eat , you eat fermented food because it keeps you alive . 
  please do not eat eels , they are very endagered . 
  thank you . 
  it was a bit tough as a celiac when i was in munich , but you can always have wine and sallad , or sausage with sauerkraut :-) . 
  i miss german wurst . 
  haha , i had forgotten it existed . 
  it is really a weird dish , is n't it . 
  actually had it recently , having lunch in a restaurant in stockholm . 
  all the lovely swedish ingridients too , bananas and peanuts . 
   0.892 , so close enough yes , that is close enough . 
   just saw that public health is a bigger problem here than in the other nordics . 
  i thought denmark was the worst , they smoke and drink a bit ... 
  k\u00e5ldolmar is nice . 
  my finnish friend always goes on and on about memma . 
  i am gluten intolerant so i ca n't eat it , but i have been given cabbage dishes ( k\u00e5lrotsl\u00e5da ) . 
  we make them too , but i think they are more of a staple in the finnish kitchen . 
  oh , i am sure we win the disgusting food part :-) disgusting food : [ surstr\u00f6mming ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/surstr%c3%b6mming ) - rotten herring . 
  it smells like - well , it has to be experienced , it ca n't be explained . 
  the late tv chef floyd said it was the most disgusting/vile food he had ever encountered ... . actually tastes better than it smells , which i guess does n't say much . 
  food everyone should try : unless they are vegetarians ( or finns/norweigans who might not find it exotic ) i have found serving people elk , roe deer , reindeer , wild boar , red deer or fallow deer is usually a success ( depending what i can get hold of ) . 
  basically , any form of `` wild '' animals is a bit exotic i guess . 
  preferably served with homepicked mushrooms or something . 
  perhaps some dessert with lingberries or clooudberries . 
  i do want to `` scout '' a bit before i serve reindeer etc. 
  i served my cousins ex ( a brit ) reindeerfil\u00e9 , and he looked liked i had struck him . 
  `` you mean i am eating rudolph ? 
  it was a bit fun , but i do not know if he enjoyed it ... . 
  i thought finland would be dark green too . 
  what happened finland ? 
  is there a mistake in the numbers somehow ? 
  no , things are not being fixed . 
  it do not seem to realise that +10 of the gdp have to go south . 
  that is not happening . 
  you still have n't said how to deal with the with the loss in internal competitiveness . 
  but please , blame it all on sweden . 
  it will solve everything - i am sure . 
  no , it is actually what it says in the treaty , and in the euro convergence criterias . 
  have you read them . 
  all countries but two , have chosen to ignore them . 
  what does that say about respect ? 
  and , if you can not respect the rules , what is the next rule that is going to be ignored . 
   you are part of the problem , not of the solution . 
  you do not seem to understand what a currency union is .
