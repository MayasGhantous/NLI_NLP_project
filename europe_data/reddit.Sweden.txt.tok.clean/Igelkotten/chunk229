  how many % of you gdp are you prepared to permanently send down south ? 
  are you ok with paying of spains debt , and making sure that the welfare payments in portugal comes out of a dutch pocket . 
  personally , i would n't be . 
  not because i hate those countries , or think `` they brought it on themselves '' ( ok , greece a bit perhaps , but they have paid there dues ) . 
  it is in the nature of the currency union , so no one , or everyone is to blame . 
  i am just not prepared to be part of a united states of europe . 
  i do not want to send most of our gdp to brussels . 
  i do not think it makes me a bad person , and above all , if the eu is heading that way , it is of vital importance , that people get to vote - do n't you think ? 
  remember , people voted for a treaty where it said that they would not have to bail anyone else out , where each and every country would be responsible for their debt . 
  saying that one should change that , without voting about it , is not fair , and very un-democratic . 
  i agree , perhaps save some `` system important banks '' , but if you do , demand collateral , as in ownership . 
  do you think it a good idea to bail out banks the way they are doing ? 
  exactly . 
  however , later on they could sell the banks for profit again . 
  it worked in sweden/finland , i do not see why it should n't work here . 
  are the finns happy about more bailouts or are you resigned ? 
  i think some should be saved `` system important '' banks , but doing as the eu is saving every single one is stupid , particularly without demanding anything back . 
  i do not know about the finnish bank guarantee - i know that sweden has one , but we did not join the banking union ( for among other things we did not want to guarantee the savings for several hundred millions of people ) . 
  is finland in the banking union ? 
  i personally think the euro as a currency is wrongly constructed ( and a lot of countries should be better of if they left ) but that is perhaps a side issue . 
  no , i do not think most of the cypriotic banks should be saved , at least not in the manners they are . 
  every bank save since the beginning of the crises have been rather idiotic , instead of saving `` system important '' banks letting some fail , and demanding collateral for saving the banks , they have just handed over money , without collateral , essentially making it risk free for the owners . 
  now they are making the people with the money in the banks pay , which i also find idiotic ( i say go for the owners ) but at least somewhat less idiotic , because i can understand some of the reasoning behind it . 
  i can see that handing over tax payers money to save what is to a large degree shady money will not go down well in germany . 
  also , i might have misunderstood it , but did n't they tell the cypriotic government that they needed to raise money , but not how ? 
   so let me get this straight : you support the deposit levy precedent which could potentially be used against you in the future ? 
  i do n't think so , sweden are not in that banking union . 
  we have refused , among other things that we refuse to stand as a guarantee for 500 million inhabitants , plus that the bank saves never demanded anything back , the rules are to fuzzy etc ( a lot of reasons ) also , we have had bank saves , and a good one to , not asking for any money from anyone else . 
  i recommend you read about it , it is generally seen as a `` good save '' . 
  what is more important , the swedish government did demand a lot of collateral for saving the banks ( unlike the eurozone save ) which means while they know that they will receive help , it will cost them a lot . 
  in the end that actually made money for the tax payers too . 
  can you say the same about this , or the rest of the eurozone bank saves ?

  i honestly do not understand your comment . 
  to be clear , i want a eu wide ban on the pesticides in question . 
  do you want them to be allowed ? 
  you are skillfully avoiuding to answer the fact that 25 states are supposed to follow the rules , but only three have consistently done that ( sweden , finland and estonia ) . 
  i do notice when you do n't answer , so please , do n't use that tactic . 
  so , it is up to the eu to make sure that the rules are being followed , fines are being paid for example . 
  why are they not ? 
  the fact that they are not is a prime example of corruption on the highest level . 
  why are n't the eu acting ? 
   and this crisis is forcing us to address the structural problems in europe . 
  corruption depends on structural vulnerabilities so fixing these problems will have a positive affect on the reduction of corruption . 
  still , not saying * how * it is fixed , no links , nothing . 
  you can also ponder over this , that in italy , someone who did attempt to correct the deep structural issues got voted away . 
  so , no , things are getting worse . 
   because , as i have said , these problems are not with the european project but with the member states no , it is with both . 
  sweden pay money to the eu , and they are supposed to divide those money among the member states , according to * the rules * , that we have all signed . 
  if the rules are not being followed , ** it is up to the eu to deal with that ** . 
  what you are saying/have been saying , is that sweden should complain every time our money is not being used properly etc. 
  that is madness . 
  are yo saying that each of the 27 states should follow each krona/pound/euro that they pay in , track it , and evaluate it . 
  the double , triple , twentyseven work this would lead to is ridiculous , and it is not feasible . 
  so , instead the * eu * takes on that role . 
  and , since they have , they should do it , and do it well . 
  however , they are not . 
  that means that you are wrong saying it is only with the states that the problem lies . 
  the problem lies with the european union . 
  the european union should react , but they are not . 
  or are you saying that sweden should track every krona , uk every pound , poland every zloty ? 
  that would be madness . 
  so , instead of acting , the ** eu ** is doing nothing , being corrupt , ignoring what is happening with our money , ignoring breaking the rules . 
  that is a eu problem , and i am right complaining about that . 
  it is also becoming worse . 
  and , if the eu cared about the european project as you said , they would deal with it . 
  however , as both you and i know , they are not . 
  so , sorry , you are wrong there . 
    if you adopt a european mindset , then this corruption is inconsequential to the goal of european unity . 
  that sentence means nothing . 
  it is against any countries , union , federation , commune , family , tribe etc goal to be corrupt , yet they are . 
  the question is - are you acting against it ? 
   oh , there are many in the european political scene who would love to do this . 
  so , you are admitting to the fact that it is not happening , nor is it ever going to happen . 
  you seem to be writing from what you want the european union to be , not where it is actually at . 
  dreaming is fine , but they are not real arguments you know ? 
   if you adopt a european mindset , this is silly , because you care for all of europe equally . 
  seriously , this is just daydreaming . 
  i could just as well argue that if i adopted a world citizen point of view , it would be silly to just think of europe . 
  you see , i care for all of the world - equally ... . . you do not seem to be rooted in reality . 
  the majority of the money in the banks that are being saved are from outside the eu . 
  i just heard on al-jazeera that the majority was from russia . 
  so where was i wrong ? 
   but as you said before , sweden is not contributing to the bailouts , so the eurozone crisis is not hurting sweden . 
  excuse me , are you saying the recession is n't hurting sweden ? 
  it is hurting the whole world . 
  plus , ** 25 ** of eu : s countries , everybody apart from dk and uk have promised to follow the budget rules , that also includes us . 
  the budget rules , as in 60 % gdp , 3 % deficit etc. 
  and , the fact that almost no one has , is hurting the whole of the eu , not just the eurozone . 
  so , yes , we have every right to feel hurt and betrayed . 
  why is no one following the rules , and why is not one being punished for it ? 
  the fact that the eu does not give one shit about the rules , tells me a lot . 
  also , the finns are feeling rather betrayed , they are not exactly happy about the bailouts . 
   as if the eu disappeared , corruption would melt away , the banks would recover , and we 'd have full employment . 
  this is not the case . 
  where have i said that ? 
  i * correctly * , i might add , blame the eu for not making sure that the treaties they have are not enforced , and the rules that they have are not followed , and that they are not fighting corruption enough . 
  i also blame them for not fighting for the environment enough , and discriminating swedish farmers . 
  are you saying that it is incorrect of me to blame the eu for that ? 
  we have just discussed that the eu have * not * done all the things that i pointed out , so i am right .
