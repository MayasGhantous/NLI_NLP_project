      no one has suggested anything like that . 
  yes , you have . 
  if they involve themselves in other countries politics , why not yours . 
  and , what if you have a big party that is against the eu , would n't it be in the eu 's interest to work as hard as they can against them , and support the other party . 
  particularely if the party wants something the south do n't want - cap reforms and less payments to the eu . 
  what makes denmark so unique that the eu can get involved in all countries but denmark ? 
   by stand outside , do you mean `` doing absolutely nothing '' ? 
  when a majority of the greek population is criticizing something that the eu has control over , the most democratic thing to do is to listen to that demand , surely . 
  no , you are wrong there . 
  syrizia is * not * the ones the greek has voted for , it is in opposition . 
  so what the eu would do is to do what not a majority wants . 
  why ca n't the eu listen to what the * government * say and not get involved in the elections . 
  after the elections the eu can listen to what the government says - then they are after all the majority of the greeks . 
  so - again - why should they be involved in the elections ? 
  why not just talk to the democratically elected government ? 
   did you read the article ? 
  it 's calling for a reform of the troika , leaving the ecb out . 
  i quoted the article - what do you think ? 
  and , read again - it * called * for reforms . 
  you see , in the real world it does n't mean that it has happened , or even that it will . 
  and i can * guarantee * that the ecb ** will ** be in the troika in may - when the elections that * you * want the troika to get involved in will happen in greece . 
  not to mention i would love to hear you explains imf 's involvement . 
  again - why just not let people democratically elect parlaments/government and then let those deal with the eu ? 
  why do you want the eu involved , and also , why do you only want the eu involved in certain countries ? 
  are you honestly this stupid ? 
  or are you just a racist who wants to pick a fight ? 
  have you been to italy . 
  the south is deeply corrupted and yes - they make toxic cheese - that ends up in other places than italy !, 
  and if you think it is just cheese that gets poisoned - then you do not understand , it is also vegetables , tomatoes , oranges etc - all of it . 
  and they take it to other areas of italy and pretend it is from there - just like the olive oil . 
  and then those toxins get sold . 
  and no - the swedish fda can not test every italian product for every batch for every possible sort of cancerous and dangerous toxin the camorra might have dumped . 
  no fda can do that - test every batch for thousand , or hundred of thousands of possible toxins . 
  not in sweden , the us - no country have the recourses for that . 
  and who knows what the mob dumps ? 
  but we do know that people in italy die from their food . 
  and you are enough of a retard to blame it on the swedish fda and demand that they test everything that ever comes out of italy for every possible toxin ? 
  do you know how many toxins there are ? 
  or cancerous elements ? 
  seriously - again i 'd like links to the fda that can do those tests , all of them , all the time on every batch . 
  i 'd even like a link to all toxins that the mob might dump . 
  there are probably a few thousands . 
  still waiting . 
  and - you are a racist . 
  so - no evidence or articles ? 
  how come i knew that . 
  please post links . 
  you are just rambling . 
  the catalan have n't voted ? 
  and - do you want the eu to go for the danish social democrats - yes or no ? 
  should the eu make sure that they win ? 
  yes or no ? 
  and the troijka - are you saying the ecb is democratically elected ? 
  do you think that the ecb should weigh in the general elections ? 
  should the fight the national front or give in to their demands ? 
  why ca n't you just let the eu stand outside and let the democratic process take its course ? 
  what is wrong with that ? 
  please answer that . 
  spain has elected its own parlament . 
  the spanish have not elected the eu . 
  do you think the eu should intervene in national elections ? 
  should they say - to make sure that the danish social democrats win next election , let us do this ? 
  is that what you want ? 
  do n't you want the danes to decide that ? 
   appeasing a critical group by giving them what they want ( eg . 
  forgive debt ) , is not the same as threatening to do x if critics are not kept out of power . 
  so , madrid wants the catalan quiet - should we go for that ? 
  then we give them what they want , do n't we ? 
  if lepen wants france to just pay 0,5 % instead of 1 % - then it is ok ? 
  the national front gets what they want - do n't they ? 
   he former is perfectly democratic , the latter is not semantics , as i 've shown with the examples above . 
  there is a very blurred line , so the eu should stay out of it all together . 
   i seriously doubt that you 're going to see exported cheese containing dangerous toxic waste chemicals in this day and age [ italy told to contain mozzarella containing dioxin ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/consumers/italy-urged-contain-toxic-mozzar-news-219470 ) [ link ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/italys-toxic-waste-crisis-the-mafia-ndash-and-the-scandal-of-europes-mozzarella-799289.html ) you are wrong . 
  you really are uneducated - are n't you . 
  and a racist . 
  i have n't said anything about italians , just about the products , while you complain about swedes the whole time . 
   most of the big food scandals ( i 'm talking about those that would threaten someone 's health vs economical fraud ) involve something that would n't get tested with the current regulations , like the mad cow prions or the `` horse food '' . 
  you did n't even read the links did you ? 
  have you heard about italy ' triangle of death ? 
  well ** read about it ** . 
  people in italy are dying and getting cancer etc , becuase the earth is so toxic . 
  you might not know this , but if the earth is toxic , the water , the vegetables and other things in the earth might be that too ( anyone with an iq over 50 would get that ) . 
  i have articles for you , but if you are not reading , it does n't really help . 
  but , if italians get sick from it - i think swedes might too . 
  and i do not want to . 
  so , read this links .

   vdue to all the above your post is basically like saying that you do n't trust the swedish food regulation agencies to do the most basic of their jobs correclty . 
  off course it is given as a comically obvious attempt to be negative about naples etc. , but deep down that 's what it is . 
  yes i do , but we * have to * let italian groceries into our country , that is the eu . 
  and they ca n't test them all . 
  it is an impossible task , instead of insulting me with idiotic comment , i 'd like you to post scientific serious articles why the above articles are wrong . 
  i 'd like to know why you claim there was no dioxin in the mozzarella , and why the italians are not dying to a larger degree in the `` triangle of death '' . 
  i 'd like you to prove why the camorra do not poison the earth around naples . 
  please , prove that . 
  or are you just going to continue with your insane insulting ramblings , which just proves that you have no idea what you are talking about . 
  so - pleae prove me wrong . 
  i am waiting .
