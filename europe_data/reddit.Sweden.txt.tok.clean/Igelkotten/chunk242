  of course i do not mind a german movie as long as it is in german . 
  i would refuse to watch it in swedish , that would be horrible . 
  and , you know that is what i meant - did n't you ? 
  it takes a few weeks , the you have learned to read the subtitles without noticing . 
  well , the translations are usually ok , and at least the texting will not ruin the connection between the actor and his voice . 
  furthermore , you pick up words from the other language and ( so i 've heard , since i 've been brought up with texted ) it only takes a few weeks to `` learn '' to read without thinking . 
  and , unlike german television , you will not end up thinking bruce willis and tom cruise have the same voice ... that was just an example , but the fact is , if you live in a dubbing country , you realise that they use the same voices over and over again . 
  horrible . 
  i prefer french movies not dubbed as well . 
  or chinese , spanish , russian . 
  you do n't notice that you read after a few weeks with texted tv . 
  go to r/norway , they can help you . 
  i had a friend who did it for a while . 
  really good pay , but first you have to take some course that costs quite a bit . 
  yes , you are right , we swedes are very sneaky . 
  we did this . 
  first , while not being in the eu , we planted the idea of a common currency in everyones head . 
  then , while still outside of the eu , we managed to sneak it in the maastrich treaty in 1992 . 
  then we made sure that it was incorrectly conststructed and held our fingers crossed that no one would notice ( it worked btw , apart from those danes , someone in the south of sweden most have gossiped ) . 
  then , we watched everyone join in , we voted no , and sat back and waited . 
  it took a long time , but we can finally start to see the fruit of our labour . 
  it is a part of our plan to take over europe . 
  it 's a very slow plan , but we figured we will get there in 200-300 years . 
  we can start to buy greece now . 
   no one is suggesting that it was doomed from the start , and that severe austerity exacerbated an already bad situation  . 
  i am glad we are on the same page . 
  of course not , it is perfectly constructed and the way the crises have been handled has n't made it worse at all . 
  i am sure those people in the south are just working less , that is why their competitiveness is still sinking . 
   i guess the next question is , can the entire population of the eurozone fit inside germany ? 
  i guess we will find out soon enough , unfortunately . 
  well , it is not the euros fault , that is for sure . 
  it is not incorretly constructed in a way that affects the whole eurozone , not at all . 
  the euros is perfect , superb . 
  this would have happened anyway , of course ... ... ... just add some fiscal discipline , and it will all be over before summer ... . 
  the data is from 2008 , and it is taken from [ cancerresearch uk ] ( http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-info/cancerstats/types/skin/incidence/uk-skin-cancer-incidence-statistics ), 
  as a swede , i can assure you you that they are not skewed due to extremely effective policing ... ... :-) . 
  however , they seem a bit off . 
  [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crime_in_sweden#homicides ) is crocs link about murders in sweden . 
  you danes are just jelous of our forests ... :-), 
  and retsin and turpentine . 
  not the taste you want in your fish . 
  thanks , i don ' really pay attention to my karma . 
  now , you can have heated smoke in one smokehouse like that , at least ours . 
  normally we have heated smoke , cold smoke is more ( traditionally at least ) used for preserving . 
  we mostly used alder and birch . 
  be sure not to have to much birch bark left too . 
  high quality decidious trees . 
  sometimes we used common juniper , but not really pine tree or fir tree . 
  a fellow nerd !, 
  well , our smokehouse is really small , bigger than [ this ] ( http://www.google.se/imgres?hl=sv&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=mr5&amp;sa=x&amp;rls=org.mozilla:sv-se:official&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=583&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=asdao0frwvpakm:&amp;imgrefurl=http://botkyrkalankarna.se/om-kvarnsand.html&amp;docid=cbuzt1f2pgkcmm&amp;imgurl=http://botkyrkalankarna.se/bilder/kvarnsand/rokeriet.jpg&amp;w=400&amp;h=266&amp;ei=t4akuce9a4mm4asxxocwdq&amp;zoom=1&amp;ved=1t:3588,i:90&amp;iact=rc&amp;dur=337&amp;sig=103551742252498844901&amp;page=1&amp;tbnh=183&amp;tbnw=260&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=14&amp;tx=136&amp;ty=106 ) , but not a lot . 
  so , it is mostly used for what we catch ourselves . 
  if you are going to smoke fish , you get the best results from fat fishes , like salmon , eel ( but please , not european eel , it is protected ) , herring etc. 
  you always `` clean '' the fish beforehand , but if the fish is really big , you can just smoke the fil\u00e9 . 
  we hardly ever did that though , because the skin is good to leave on , it keeps the moisture inside . 
  that also means that the thicker skin , the better . 
  you prepare it first ( clean it , as soon as you catch it ) , and then salt it for at least a few hours . 
  if it 's a slimy fish , you might want to - `` de slime '' it first . 
  then you smoke it . 
  it usually takes something between 2-5 hours . 
  depending on the taste you want , you use different sort of wood , but we usually did not use coniferous trees . 
  obviously , you can also get it more or less smokey , depending if you choose `` smokey '' wood . 
  it is hard to explain , what do you want to know ? 
   long burning pieces of hard wood cut into slim pieces to start the fire at the bottom yes , one prepared those and , at least at my fathers , they were sort of kept seperately . 
  it 's an artform :-) . 
  i wonder how one can be allowed to build nuclear plants without a proper plan how to deal with the waste ? 
  actually , riding is the second largest sport . 
  no , denmark does n't have to , they voted no , so no , one can be pegged to the euro voluntarily . 
  the good thing with not being in the euro is that you still have your own interest rate for example . 
  nor , do you have to be called up for the bail - outs and bank saves , nor will be half forced to join in banking unions etc , who are half assed and badly thought through . 
  furthermore , the euro is the most imperfect of currency unions which have lead to the development that we are seeing currently in the ez . 
  there can be huge advantages to watching it unfold from the side-lines , which it ( unfortunately ) will . 
  so is denmark . 
  does n't mean you have to join . 
  good , i hope you are right . 
  it does n't remove the value of having control of your own currency , and interest rate , rather than joining a very imperfect union . 
  i agree with him ( at least if we talk about the euro in its current form , with all the current member states perhaps a smaller euro can survive ) , but that opinion is not popular around r/europe and both him and i will be downvoted . 
   did he ? 
  i know nothing of this , can you cite that , please ? 
  sorry , only in swedish . 
  i remember it was a long series of articles , several years ago in a series on sweden 's economics in the 90 's , since that was a very turbulent times for us . 
  then there was quotes from tobin saying he was opposed to the implementation in sweden , which you might know , was a spectacular failure . 
  he was also deeply against the fact , that the tobin tax , was hijacked by the the anti-globlisation movement . 
  here is a quote : `` i have absolutely nothing in common with those anti-globalisation rebels . 
  of course i am pleased ; but the loudest applause is coming from the wrong side . 
  look , i am an economist and , like most economists , i support free trade . 
  furthermore , i am in favour of the international monetary fund , the world bank , the world trade organisation . 
  they 've hijacked my name . 
  the tax on foreign exchange transactions was devised to cushion exchange rate fluctuations . 
  [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] ( see last part of quote in the above lead section ) . '', 
  from wiki . 
  i do know what tobin * really * wanted , was deeper financial integration but since he did n't know how to achieve that , he suggested the tax . 
  also , his original proposal was towards foreign exchange only . 
  what you posted was a link to the european union , of course they are going to be positive about it . 
  it is like asking if they think they are doing a good job . 
  are they going to say no ? 
  i was after more neutral research . 
  [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/financial_transaction_tax#effect_on_volatility ) is some ( albeit wiki ) articles why it might not be successful , not all research , and certainly not implementation says so . 
   sure , the original idea is from a dude called tobin . 
  i know of tobin , and i also know that he said no to the tobin tax afterwards.i also know that it in no way calmed anything down in sweden . 
  what i mean , that you in your original statement claimed that it would calm down the financial market .
