  what the fuck do you suggest we do ? 
  stop the budget forever and behave like the childish selfish france/uk . 
  we do not have that power , but we do what we can . 
  second - you said that we only supported it , because we had problem at home . 
  that is not true for us , nor for dk/finland . 
  we are supporting it because we believe it to be right , and in the end , better for everyone . 
  i truly believe if that can be said about france - they know the cap benefits some countries so much more than other , yet they wanted to keep it . 
  i think it is sad that you think that someone just wants to cut the cap because we have a problem at home , not because it is the right thing to do . 
  that indicated , that the cap is perfect , and right , and anyone who wants to cut is is just messing with the french for the sake of messing . 
  is that truly what you think , because that is very far from the truth . 
  semi - wild , a few hundred , on the island of gotland .

  warm weather and swimming , and thinking of staying ... ... well , it can be decent in northern europe in the summer , but long term , for staying - southern europe . 
  northern europe do not have warm weather . 
  it is not the dorner died that really bothers me , i do n't doubt that he was a murdering idiot . 
  it is the way the us police go about such things . 
  it is like they do n't realise that violence breeds violence . 
  i mean , europe have their fair share of idiots as well , but they are not as likely to end up in violent shoot outs , manhunts etc. 
  and , i do n't think most of the police departments would have fired gas grenades that everyone knows can ignite stuff rather easily , into a cabin . 
  they would been much more likely to negotiate , to wait out . 
  and , then perhaps he would have been more likely to not end up in a shoot out as well . 
  also , i mean , for god 's sake , 51 bullets into a truck with 2 asian women ? 
  to call the us police trigger happy is an understatement . 
  it does n't seem to matter though , it is not like it is changing . 
  it is a health concern that you do not know what your food contains , and that it is labelled incorrectly . 
  i mean , are you * sure * that they have n't put anything else in there , and can trace the meat etc. 
  it shows that we need to do more tests , and also strenghten the `` supply '' chain . 
  personally i think it it up to each person if they want to eat horse . 
  i do n't want to eat anything that is labelled incorrectly . 
  it seems to be evenly spread out in the country , is that a correct interpretation ? 
  not like italy where it is more a south/north divide . 
  i also wonder why people vote for them . 
  perhaps people think it is no one else , or think it will work for them . 
  what surprises me is that even when they have cheated , that it 's no vote in the parlament , whatever you call `` vote of mistrust '' . 
  not for sweden , we do n't have holes , or at least not that many . 
  we just dislike overspending , incorrect spending and the cap . 
  i guess it is the same for the netherlands , dk , finland . 
  what holes do you mean that they have ? 
  or sweden ? 
  and , even if the resistance against the cap for example is done for the wrong reasons , ca n't it be both ? 
  i mean , the uk government want to resist the cap because they have trouble at home , and because it is wrong . 
  one thing does n't exclude the other . 
  also , that is also exactly the same reason why france for example want to keep the cap . 
  they are no better , i 'd say worse since the cap has been far to big , and unfair . 
  i do n't like the cuts in research , infrastructure etc either , but that is something one has to live with since certain countries are determined to keep the cap . 
  why are n't they getting the blame ? 
  no , it is n't . 
  overspending , wherever is is , should be attacked . 
  so should spending on wrong things be as well . 
  also , it sends the message , which i find important , that it is not an endless increase , with no ceiling . 
   in the long term , however , it solves nothing . 
  argentina is again considering a devaluation , and without other measures it will not be the last either . 
  the southern european states have a history of repeated devaluation as well . 
  of course , it needs to be done in combination with other things , i totally agree with that . 
  besides , greece could have a free floating currency . 
  you are also forgetting that they , like argentina , then can default on its debt . 
   why do n't you prove that rich argentinians/swedes voluntarily devaluated the part of their assets that they held in foreign currencies and institutions ? 
  what ? 
  first - you made a claim , you prove it . 
  second - what do you mean voluntarily etc ? 
  i meant that they did n't know beforehand that the swedish krona was going to float freely for example , so when it was declared , they just had to get along with it , like everyone else . 
  are you claiming that every rich swede knew beforehand ? 
  second , those time we * did * devaluate in the 80 's - are you claiming that the rich ones knew in advance ? 
  i 'd love to see proof for that . 
  i have never ever even heard a whisper , and i am swedish . 
   http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/6525634/berlin-wall-anniversary-east-germans-now-likely-to-be-as-rich-as-westerners.html yes , a working east german * person * might earn as much , but they are still not as competitive , and former ddr still receiving billions each year ( at least $ 100 billion , according to der spiegel ) . 
  check the unemployment and the productivity . 
  [ here ] ( http://statistik.arbeitsagentur.de/nn_32082/siteglobals/forms/imagemapschnelluebersichten/zeitauswahlschnelluebersicht-form.html?view=processform&amp;resourceid=210328&amp;input_=&amp;pagelocale=de&amp;regionind=b&amp;year_month=201212&amp;year_month.group=1&amp;search=suchen ) are the numbers for january 2013 . 
  put the hand above west/east and the `` ingesamte arbeitslose '' is the number you want . 
  so , no , they are not the same yet . 
  as for productivity - no they are not the same [ link ] ( http://www.voxeu.org/article/half-empty-or-half-full-east-germany-two-decades-later ) , [ link ] ( http://www.econ.jku.at/members/department/files/researchseminar/ss10/fuchs-sch%c3%bcndeln.pdf ) . 
  you only have to read the conclusion , starting at page 36 . 
   they do get help in the form of structural funds and in other forms are you saying the greeks are getting the same sort of help the eastern germans are getting from west germany ? 
  not even close . 
  for the first - eastern germany did n't have the burdensome debt that greece had . 
  then , they got a lot more money . 
  so far , 1,7 trillions - and that is * not * to pay off debt , whereas almost anything greece gets is to pay off debt . 
  second - the structural funds are part of the * european union * , * not * part of the eurozone . 
  they have been receiving those for decades ( to no avail perhaps ) , and they most certainly can not , and should n't be used for problems related to the * euro * . 
  besides , a few of them have actually been cut , due to cheating . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/spiegel/germany-s-eastern-burden-the-price-of-a-failed-reunification-a-373639.html ) is more on the german reunification and its costs . 
  so , in short - 20 years after they are still not competitive enough , despite being helped enormously , to a level greece never , ever will , they never had greece 's debt and have received billions + having their social system sponsored by the west . 
  that is not the case with greece . 
  forst , their enormous debt . 
  second , it is not very politically feasible to argue for `` permanent transfers to greece so that they can pay out unemployment benefits '' or someting similar . 
  third - becoming competitive takes time . 
  even if the greeks work their asses off , it is , as so aptly demonstrated by ddr , not something you do in a few years , apparently hardly even in a few decades . 
   no , they would be on a lowe level . 
  the economical activity they might have gained only thrives at low exchange rates . 
  there 's no reason to assume they will be able to keep up then . 
  they have no competitivness at all now . 
  nothing . 
  of course they have a better chance with their own currency . 
   we have a banking union now , a financial union was already present - just not enforced . 
  we 'll see to which extent permanent fiscal transfers are necessary . 
  first , all of that is half measurement . 
  in no way to we have a banking/financial union to the level of for example the us , or why not canada . 
  permanent transfers between states is my no means permanent . 
  and , to get there , we will have to have a new treaty , after the lisbon treaty . 
  and then people will need to vote on that .
