  to me it is n't , and it is just another prime example of eu 's failures . 
  the democratic deficit is growing every day , and nobody is doing anything . 
  exactly . 
  we are slowly being pushed towards a `` federal states of europe '' , and we do n't even get a say in it . 
  i mean , if that is what people want , fine , but , ** they have to let us vote ** . 
  personally , i am pretty sure my country ( sweden ) would vote no to that , and i am happy about that . 
  i do n't want the swedish budget to be decided in brussel/eu , or them to rule over us . 
  i 'd vote no . 
  however , that is hypothetical . 
  apparently , the people of the eu are not even allowed to vote . 
  sweden . 
  i think there are way to many `` curling parents '' who always put their little darling ( who never does anything wrong ) in the center of the universe . 
  a lot of them are lazy too ( parents and kids ) . 
  to many spoiled brats . 
   i 'm not sure what you 're referring to here ? 
  sorry , it is in the stability pact , but it is referred to in the lisbon treaty , if i am not incorrect . 
  anyway , lot of things , but let us take article 125 for example , the `` no bailout clause '' , that explicity * forbids * that any other country should pay for another countries debt , or article 123 , that forbids ecb to directly buy securities ( v\u00e4rdepapper ) from countries . 
  however , as we all know , that is not happening . 
  in fact , every single minute that is being ignored and broken . 
  i can understand * why * one ignored it , at the beginning . 
  * but * , what i can not understand , or even stand , is that you * do not re-negotiate and let people vote about it * . 
  instead , what they are doing is slowly pushing people towards a federal union , and a transfer union at that ( which is explicitly forbidden btw ) . 
  if that is what people want - i am ok with that . 
  but * we need to vote about it * . 
  besides , one ca n't just go around breaking laws all the time . 
  then you re-write them . 
  imagine how that would look at a national level , in danmark for example . 
  helle thorning schmidt just decided to ignore international treaties and the constituion for a while , and then refuse to let people vote about it . 
  everyone would be outraged . 
   obviously , a fair and non-negotiable basic system for eu contributions must be set in place , well , that is not happening any time soon , due to several reasons . 
  the french for one , are refusing to abandon their cap , who is 44 % of the budget . 
  the cap is anything * but * fair and balanced . 
  second , the eurozone countries have demonstrated , with chilling contempt how little they care about law , rules and regulations . 
  the stability pact , anyone ? 
  the rules of the ecb anyone ? 
  they are breaking them right now . 
  as we speak . 
  so , we * should * have fair rules that everyone should follow , sure . 
  we should also live in peace , no discriminate , save the planet etc , but none of it is very likely to happen . 
   one thing that needs to happen is that europeans need to be able to vote on the same issues , and at the same time . 
  true , but that does n't even help . 
  we have all , one way or another agreed to the lisbon treaty . 
  that is now being completely ignored . 
  i do not understand how this is allowed to go on , and i find it frightening . 
   campaigns in europeans countries always have this strong focus on each nationality -- nobody ever gets to vote for someone who is n't from their country , or gets to vote on issues in a way that clarifies the impact of it on the eu as a whole , and not just locally . 
  well , yes , but you simply can not do that . 
  imagine if we were all to voting on the issue that the finns should pay much more to the eu . 
  of course it would be a yes , because what can five million finns do ? 
  therefore we have politicians , who work out treaties , that we then accept or reject ( with consequences for the country , of course ) . 
  but * then we need to follow said agreement/treaty * . 
  we are not . 
  that is the frightening reality of today . 
   it did n't stop us from waging 3 wars since then . 
  that sounds enormously financial irresponsible to me . 
  waging war is extremely expensive , and you choose to do it when your finances are going downhill ? 
  whatever it will be * the people of europe need to be allowed to vote about it * . 
  we are not . 
  it is an enormous democratic deficiency , and i do not understand how anyone , anywhere can defend it , or how it is even allowed ( it is n't , but no one seem to care ) . 
  israel always plays football , handball , sports , eurovision etc , with europe . 
  many countries in the middle east ( which they should belong to geographically ) does n't even acknowledge their right to exist so to be able to take part in `` normal '' stuff , like olympics , international sports etc , they get added to the european group.i imagine the situation would be quite volatile - the jewish football team in saudi etc. 
  for what it is worth , at least from a sport point of view , it is worse for israel . 
  the european countries are a lot better at almost any sport i can think of , and i think it should be easier to qualify for the world cup against iraq/kuwait/saudi arabia etc , than having to fight , poland , ukraine , italy etc. 
  we also have spr\u00e5kn\u00e4mnden och terminologicentrum . 
  svenska akademin is supposed to work for the swedish language , but spr\u00e5kn\u00e4mnden och terminolgicentrum work much more with translation of foreign words and terminology . 
  it is so weird . 
  our kings never abdicate , they just keep on going until they die ( swedish btw ) . 
  i think most royal houses have it like that , do n't they ? 
  is there any particular reason your queens seem to have come into the habit of abdicating ? 
  do you have any of european female height ? 
  i want to feel tall too ... . 
  true , you got it !, 
  if bing were as popular as google , that expression would be as comon as `` att googla '' . 
  that is translated to `` att googla '' - to google . 
  it is really easy to create vebs in swedish , generally you just add an `` a '' . 
  however , i think even more correct would be to say something like `` i did a websearch '' - `` jag gjorde en webbs\u00f6kning '' or `` i searched on the internet '' , after all , you might want to use bing :-) . 
  it is the same here , but i think most officials ( or just anal people like me ) , try to follow them . 
  it is interesting , because if a new word comes all of a sudden , it can be something like a new species who has no swedish name , a new phenomenon that we have no name for etc - then you can notice the journalists struggling with what to call it . 
  after a while however , they have a recommendation what to say , and all journalists starts to pronounce it the same/call it the same etc. 
  i do n't know if they they are as consistent as the french , but in sweden we have svenska spr\u00e5kn\u00e4mnden and terminologicentrum that both are supposed to translate foreign terminology if possible , or at least bring some `` clarity '' as to what one is supposed to say . 
  i think this is good . 
  more referendums please . 
  above all , i 'd like new referendums of the new realities in the eu , to deal with the democratic deficit . 
  for example , the maastrich and lisbon treaty was very clear on the fact that no countries should be bailed out by other countrie , that it would not be a transfer union , etc ( rule 125 for example ) . 
  however , we all know this is not happening . 
  i think it is ok if people want bail-outs , more permanent transfers , more power to the ecb etc - * but it needs to be voted about by the people of the eu * . 
  as it is now , they are constantly breaking the treaties , or balancing on it . 
  of course they treaties can be re-negotiated , but * the people need to have their say * . 
  so good - more voting in the eu . 
  more democracy for the eu . 
   in germany it 's around the same amount but it 's not that easy since the state is paying for your rent same here , but `` kommunen '' , which is the local government . 
  so , they pay , and you get free housing . 
   i think your estimation of 20-30 % of population being lazy is way too high . 
  i do n't . 
  and i migh add , stupid too . 
  think of the [ normal distribution curve/bell 's curve ] ( http://www.google.se/imgres?hl=sv&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=hxb&amp;sa=x&amp;tbo=d&amp;rls=org.mozilla:sv-se:official&amp;biw=1024&amp;bih=457&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=gejwzg7uowfhnm:&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.mathsisfun.com/data/standard-normal-distribution.html&amp;docid=1kchfs-zq2vy7m&amp;imgurl=http://www.mathsisfun.com/data/images/normal-distrubution-large.gif&amp;w=752&amp;h=383&amp;ei=ai4guflkgoxj4qtbmygqcw&amp;zoom=1&amp;ved=1t:3588,r:1,s:0,i:84&amp;iact=rc&amp;dur=2222&amp;sig=111843630718231043490&amp;page=1&amp;tbnh=160&amp;tbnw=315&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=7&amp;tx=168&amp;ty=71 ) . 
  it is simple statistic , if there are some people ahead of the curve , some are behind . 
  we ca n't all be smarter than average , some have to be more stupid than average . 
  so , mathematically , it is very sound , your suggestion is actually statistically weird . 
  how do you mean - could you explain that to me statistically how it would work ? 
   that 's why i am defintely a big supporter of free education and cash incentitives for people to go to school/university .
