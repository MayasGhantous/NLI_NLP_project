  so , the treaty changes will not happen , nor the necessary changes to the euro . 
  so , the way i see it there are really two alternatives for the euro . 
  a ) go on like this . 
  i do n't know for how many decades , but several . 
  maybe worse , when germany runs into problems , which they will . 
  france is not exactly looking perky either . 
  b ) split somehow . 
  this is really what i wish would happen . 
  not because i particularely enjoy for example greece being bankrupt , but because i truly dislike the euro and in the long term i think it is better for them to leave . 
  they should never have entered , and should have left at the first crises . 
  however , it does n't look like it will happen , so now i am hoping for countries like finland to leave . 
  they will not have the massive increase in currency from the euro that germany would have . 
  it is interesting to discuss with you to . 
  most of the posters here defend the euro - nothing that ca n't be fixed with a pinch of austerity , or that everything will be fine if they just ease up on the austerity . 
  it seems like they do n't want to think about the underlying problem at all . 
  and , of course , non of this is mentioned by our dear leaders , despite it hardly being a secret . 
  i am certainly not one to defend our current political climate but to say it on the verge of dictatorship is rather idiotic . 
  you do have freedom of expression in sweden . 
  you seem to think that i defend the ez , the handling of the crises or the ez . 
  i do not why you think that - i have n't done that . 
  i agree with your criticism . 
  i do not like the euro nor do i like the handling of the crises - i am not even fond of the eu . 
  but to have a currency that is working we need the integration i mentioned before - do n't you agree ? 
  and , the difference between the finns sponsoring germany and forever signing up for the future be responsible for greek pensions and italian debt - and let italians and greeks decide over them , is enormous . 
  ca n't you see that ? 
  why are you so angry ? 
  but honestly - if you think that the europeans in the eu would yes to to a united states of europe which an integrated euro would require and which your suggestions seem to imply as well - then you hang out only with people in and around the european parliament . 
  no , italy and belgium did not meet the criteria . 
  ones debt was/is not supposed to be over 60 % of the gdp . 
  they were well over 100 % , even then . 
  eeeh - i see you are american . 
  let me assure you that northern europe do not want to join debt with the south . 
  nor does finland wish to send 40 % of their gdp to brussels to make sure that the portuguese pensions are secured . 
  we are not the united states of europe just yet . 
  the eu is not the eurozone . 
  why should they act , there are several different currencies in the eu . 
  the eu can stay even if the ez disappears . 
  the ez should deal with their problems themselves . 
  and , besides , the eu do not really care about laws and rules ( which is a huge problem in my mind btw ) . 
  if the eu had the slightest interest in rules and laws they would have cared that basically every single country have broken and are still breaking the growth and stability pact . 
  greece , italy and belgium should n't even had been let in the euro for example since they did n't meet the criteria . 
  everything :-) . 
  i 'd wait with the union for starters since i do not think the nations in the ez are ready , but if i were to advise my imaginary grandchild on currency unions ... first , i would n't have a currency union with only monetary integration . 
  i 'd want financial and political too . 
  and to get that you do not only need new and change treaties , you need the popular support for the idea . 
  people in germany should in other words be ok to be in a political union with the greeks for example ( and the other way around of course ) . 
  that means that they to a larger degree vote together . 
  also , that they share debt , and have huge financial transfers . 
  for example , if greece had problems paying for welfare and schools , germany would transfer money for that . 
  think ddr/west germany , they took over a lot for ddr . 
  and , when joining - do not have as different economies as they have now . 
  and far more flexibility for ecb . 
  in a lot of ways . 
  of course - people in all countries would say no . 
  that is one of the many reasons why the euro is a bad idea . 
  the problem with portugal ? 
  their debt , their unemployment and the effect the austerity has had on them ? 
  their future ? 
  and , i do not understand how portugal could have cut their own interest really . 
  and why should the eu act ? 
  are you referring to the ecb . 
  if so , the ecb has in its statue that they should not defend individual interest rates/countries . 
  not that they cared about the rules when it came to italy . 
  i agree the euro is really a disastrous currency . 
  one hardly needs to be a doctor in economics to realise that greece should n't have the same currency as germany , their economies and needs are to different . 
  and , yes , it has created poverty and problems across the whole continent . 
  what fascinates me is that no one in real power , like draghi or merkel seems to address the real issues , how bad the euro is constructed and the problems it leads to . 
  instead they talk about austerity , ftt etc. 
  it is sad to watch . 
  i know it is not a ( purely ) north vs south issue , but since i am a bit lazy i wrote that :-) the euro as i see it is a very badly constructed currency , with no social , financial and political integration , little transfers are far to diverse economies . 
  i mean , apart from that the whole euroagreement should be re-weitten , countries like greece and portugal should never had entered . 
  i agree with you on the german exit , but i ca n't for the life of me understand why the finns stay . 
  and frankly , same with the south . 
  this recession/depression is long term . 
  and they have no clue how to deal with it . 
  maybe they are heading towards japan territory . 
  it is sad to watch . 
  thanks for the study . 
  i 've heard the same but i ca n't find the studies now . 
  i wonder when northern european voters will grasp this and start asking questions and objecting . 
  i think at least some finns have realised it , but that might just be from my private conversations with finns . 
  it would be very interesting if the north left before the south . 
  it seems like that it is better to be outside if the euro than in it . 
  the only countries with good growth in the ez is those that were really poor from the beginning , like estonia . 
  that is cold . 
  and not fun either , one ca n't really be outside more than necessary when it is that cold . 
  cross country skiing . 
  there is a huge ( for a park ) national park ( and it is small for being a national park ) close to where i live , djurg\u00e5rden . 
  they have 2 tracks , one around 3 km , the other one around two . 
  only one of them is tracks in now though . 
  with the 2 km they have snow cannons too , so as soon as the weather allows , we have snow . 
  it takes me around 5 minutes to walk to the 3 km track , around 10 minutes to walk to the 2 km track with my skies . 
  it is very nice . 
  only photo i could find online of what it looked like this weekend . 
  [ here you can see a map how djurg\u00e5rden looks like in relation to stockholm ] ( http://www.google.se/imgres?client=firefox-a&amp;hs=whz&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3asv-se%3aofficial&amp;biw=1024&amp;bih=457&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=m3yvj3g8xhmrvm%3a&amp;imgrefurl=http%3a%2f%2fsv.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fkungliga_nationalstadsparken&amp;docid=e8b1m92bt0wngm&amp;imgurl=http%3a%2f%2fupload.wikimedia.org%2fwikipedia%2fcommons%2f5%2f54%2fnationalstadsparken_karta_2010.jpg&amp;w=939&amp;h=677&amp;ei=_v3dutjbkqjw4qs0hihycg&amp;zoom=1&amp;ved=0cfkqhbwwaq&amp;iact=rc&amp;dur=287&amp;page=1&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=8 ) . 
  and [ here ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/kakn%c3%a4stornet_g%c3%a4rdet_g%c3%a4rdets_sportf%c3%a4lt_stockholm_sweden_20050812.jpg ) is the field where they have the good taste to have a cross country skiing track in the winter . 
  i am rather annoyed by it myself , as a stockholmer . 
  no , i decimetre of snow do not scare me or even makes life difficult . 
  oh , it would be so great ... however , a few hours at work without showering - i would n't like that smell . 
  i am lucky though , i could , in theory , stop to go skiing to and from uni ... . . but i 'd rather go home in between than running around with skis and skiing clothes.depending where i ski , it takes between five and ten minutes to me go skiing .
