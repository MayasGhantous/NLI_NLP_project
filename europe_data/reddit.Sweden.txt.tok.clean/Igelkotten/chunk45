  think of when west germany took over ddr - they have transferred trillion , took over their pensions and social systems , debt , banks and trillions in investments . 
  that is what needs to happen . 
  however , the people in the north are not about to do this . 
  they do not want to . 
  and frankly , i do not know if the south is so keen on giving up their states as well . 
  we are taking about the end of a lot of national states essentially . 
  if finland has to pay off greece 's debt , portugal pensions and send 30 % of their gdp south - well that will change everything for the finns . 
  and they will say no . 
  so , despite knowing how to fix the euro , it will not happen . 
  they do not want to fix it . 
  as for a union outside of the euro . 
  well , that would be sweden , denmark , uk and eastern europe . 
  i do n't really see great enthusiasm for that from our viewpoint . 
  but you are right about the eu taking in anyone . 
  of course they do , not do they ever care about rules , corruption or anything . 
  if they did , we would not be in the situation we are in . 
  not that the eu cares . 
  how are they strengthened ? 
  i 'd say that your reasoning is much more emotional than mine . 
  you are the one talking about values and fear . 
  not me . 
  and what i pointed out was tangible , and fact based . 
  thank you . 
  no , i am not trolling . 
  i just do n't understand why you think europe and the ez is standing up for values . 
  they are not , and i have you examples of that . 
  give me examples and proof of the opposite . 
  if the eu worked , why does the south feel less democratic than before , less freedom . 
  if the eu cares , why are n't they setting an example ? 
  and , why do n't the ez fix itself ? 
  it is no secret how to do it - it will just cost an enormous amount of money from the north to the south , change of treaties etc. 
  sweden is not more free etc because of the eu , we are less so . 
  it is not in sweden at least , the romas are probably the worst integrated people we have , with the somaliis perhaps . 
  very few romas even finishes school . 
  at first i read it as draghi , and thought mario draghi had said that . 
  i was a bit shocked , thought it was a stupid thing of him to say and to get involved in . 
  glad i was wrong . 
  the world is always changing and there is nothing that says that the eu is better at defending `` our values '' than any other form . 
  and , the eu and/or the eurozone do n't have any ethical values , they are constantly working against things that are good , honest and valuable . 
  if the eurozone have * any * ethical values , why are the ez then constantly breaking the treaties , and the law and statues . 
  what worse , they are not even attempting to change them , or to be democratic , they just ignore them and do n't give a shit . 
  that tells me that the eu in general and the eurozone in particular do not care on bit about the law , and democracy . 
  and what about discrimination . 
  the eu is discriminating sweden ( and finland ) when it comes to the cap , openly . 
  not to mention that the eu refuses to fight for what is right with the cap , but goes for what the south wants , not what could be proper ( like fighting the use of antibiotics , and stop discriminating sweden ) . 
  and do n't even get me started on the lack of science , the blatant throwing away of money or the corruption , oh dear the corruption . 
  i could go on all day on how the eurozone and the eu works against those values , that are not european , but universal . 
  and , if you are afraid of china , a ) deal with it . 
  china is not going anywhere so get over your fears and go with the flow . 
  b ) fix the fucking ez . 
  there is no secret , that can be done but the eurozone refuses to be demcratic , to fix themselves or to follow the law . 
  and , nothing i have said above really have been caused by sweden . 
  it has been caused by the eu and ez . 
  why would we want more of that ? 
  we , and a lot of other people and countries had values , and honoured them before the the eurozone . 
  and we are not the ones endagering them , the eu and the eurozone is . 
  why ? 
  no , not really . 
  a technical opt out perhaps . 
  we have never ratified the agreement erm ii ( i believe that is the name ) so we ca n't join technically . 
  practically sweden is fairly against the eu in general for bring an eu country and dead set against the euro . 
  and , a promise that was made about the euro that we would not join without a popular vote . 
  so in 2003 sweden said no . 
  right now i think we have 13 % who wants the euro which is less people than believe in ghosts and astrology ( do n't really know what that last number says about us , that at least 20 % of us are idiots i guess ) . 
   but nobody seems to know why when you want to say `` 2 weeks '' ( which are 14 days ) you say quince d\u00edas ( which means 15 days ) . 
  it 's the same in italian too : s because if you start counting with a monday , and end with the monday two weeks later it is 15 days ... 
  very true . 
   tl ; dr danish is fucking hard , but not for danes . 
  not true , actually :-) . 
  danish children are later than average since they can not hear what people say , which i find hilarious ... [ danish children learn to speak later than average ] ( http://www.2gocopenhagen.com/2go-blog/expats/did-you-know-danish-children-learn-how-speak-later-average ), 
  what you do not seem to realise , is that i read a lot about terrorism , and a lot more than you , from what i understand when i read your post . 
  i almost feel sorry for you , but then i remember how arrogant you are and the fact that you think you are right despite that all your `` facts '' are made up . 
  perhaps your heart is in the right place though , but you really have no clue what you are talking about . 
   people in sweden are not poor but you ca n't tell me that the people heading to syria are upperclass . 
  that is stupid , now you are changing from poor to uppeclass . 
  decide !, 
  are we poor or not ? 
  define poverty . 
  the most widespread and accepted is the un where you live on less than 1 usd/day . 
  hardly any terrorist have that background , nor are most of the poorest countries breeding grounds for terrorist . 
  and the swedes who go have it good . 
  and those who * choose * from the swedish side to become terrorist , like the suicide bomber , have it better than 99 % of the population in the world . 
  but do not take my world for it , why do n't you read these academic papers instead . 
  [ link 1 ] ( http://www.nber.org/papers/w9074 ) [ link 2 ] ( http://www.nber.org/digest/may05/w10859.html ) [ link 3 ] ( http://money.cnn.com/2007/03/13/magazines/fortune/pluggedin_murphy_terror.fortune/ ) . 
  please not that out of the 50 poorest countries in the world , most of them have little terrorists . 
   yes , osama bin laden was a wealthy man/civil engineer . 
  no , he was not a civil engineer ( but wealthy ) or at least that is not decided . 
  he had however studied business administration . 
  [ link ] ( http://money.cnn.com/2007/03/13/magazines/fortune/pluggedin_murphy_terror.fortune/ ) . 
  you might be confusing him with several of the highjackers who were engineering students . 
   but no , the people flying into wtc were not wealthy . 
  if so : please provide a link/source since you 're the one claiming such and such . 
  now you change it to `` wealthy '' . 
  they were of comfortable middle class background . 
  are you saying that everyone without a private yatch is in the risk of becoming a terrorist ? 
  first you said poor , now you say `` wealthy '' . 
  actually , some of them were wealthy/prominent , link 1 and 5 for example . 
  [ we will start with this link that clearly states that they have middle class background ] ( http://www.historycommons.org/timeline.jsp?timeline=complete_911_timeline&amp;the_alleged_9/11_hijackers=otherhijackers ) then the hijackers . 
  it is all there if you actually had looked up the information . 
  i give you five , check the other 14 yourself .
