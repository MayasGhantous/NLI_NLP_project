  and a leecher . 
  always a drainage on our money , never ever paying . 
  so , still a leecher . 
  still someone who just will not admit that you are costing the eu money , that you are corrupt and not doing a damn thing about it . 
  as long as the greeks are like you you are going to keep on beeing the drainage on europe , the people who always complain , never give , never pay , just corrutp assholes who want money . 
  so , still a leecher with no science behind you that wants the rest of the world fot opay for you . 
  sounds like we are back where we started apart from the fact that we have proven beyond the shadow of a doubt that you can not separate the eu and the eurozone , you do not know what science is , greece is corrupt and you want it to stay that way and blame everyone but the greeks for it and wants everyone to pay for greece for all eternity . 
  you are a leecher . 
  oh , so now you have no answers ? 
  for how long are you going to leech of others ? 
  why are you so corrupt ? 
  is that the greek way - to be corrupt and to make other people pay ? 
  we are not a nation of leechers who make other peopel pay while not fixing the mistakes . 
  you are . 
  for how many decades are the rest of the world paying for you ? 
  looser . 
  so , you are still excusing greece and claiming you have it worse than everyone else . 
  just for interest - in what year are you going to start contributing and stop be a drainage on the eu . 
  and no , you are stupid as well as non scientific . 
  the fact that you * receive * money from the eu - that is not a loan . 
  the eu is not loaning you money , we are giving you . 
  i am sure loosers like you are just referrimng to it as a part of the gdp . 
  my god , you are so fucking stupid that you do n't even know the difference between the eurozone and the eu . 
  to get this straight . 
  the ** eu ** have been ** giving ** you money for 32 years , and you will receive for another seven in the new budget . 
  you are such a fucking loosers . 
  why ca n't you start paying for yourself ? 
  why are you so fucking corrupt . 
  so , you are still expeciting everyone else to pay for you while not paying anything yourself ? 
  you still have no science . 
  you still have no answers as to why we have to pay for you . 
  you are still a corrup country . 
  you still blame everyone but yourself . 
  you are still a looser . 
  come back when you are productive , a net payer , and not corrupt . 
  stop taking other people 's money . 
  stop blaming other people for what you , the greeks have done . 
  no one forced this upon the greeks . 
  it is all you . 
  you choose to be non productive , corrupt and to leech of others . 
  you choose not to pay to the eu since 1981 . 
  more than 30 years - that is your choice . 
  why do you choose being loosers ? 
  look at [ this ] ( http://mapsof.net/uploads/static-maps/baltic_states_map.png ) map and look at a countries that did n't even exist when greece started to receive money . 
  now estonia is fucking paying for them greece joined in 1981 . 
  look where china was then . 
  south korea . 
  india . 
  chile . 
  there is absolutely no scientific reason as to why greece should still be on the receiving end . 
  if there are - give it to me . 
  i want ** scientific articles ** that proves that greece can not develop in over a generation . 
  please , what is the reason as to why greece have to stay corrupt and why they have to stay low productive . 
  chile does n't . estonia does n't . 
  give me the science . 
  you do n't have any - do you . 
   this is always a problem for peripheral regions , be they geographically distant or just hard to make accessible with infrastructure . 
  as a peripheral country , we are far more off than greece , so is finland btw . 
  now you are just making stuff up . 
  i am tired off you lying . 
  if you are going to claim stuff - support it with scientific articles . 
  do you even know what that is ? 
  so , again , why should we pay for greece for decades ? 
  amy god , you are still just making excuses as to why the rest of the eu have to pay for you for decades . 
  do you know , i ** know ** why you have no scientific explanations - there are none . 
  and people like you keep on making excuses . 
  you are actually saying , after a generation of just taking , taking , taking money for more than 33 years , that * the rest of the eu should keep on giving you money just because you have suffered more than anyone in the whole world * . 
  more than poland , who gives you money . 
  more than africa , who gives you money ( through imf ) . 
  more than the baltic states . 
  i think it is impossible to find someone more selfish , with less comptence than you . 
  however , your country is a leecher . 
  you take money from others , and expect us to pay for you . 
  you could of course , choose to fight the corrputions , fight the low producitivty , but you do n't . 
  you just want the rest of us to pay for your . 
  i have asked for you for a reason why we should pay for you for decades , but all you have is whining , whining and whinging . 
  is that who the greeks are . 
  my parents paid for you lot , i am paying for you , and all you are doing is whining and complaining . 
  so , since you are such a fucking looser , my children will have to pay for you . 
  just stop whining and pay for yourself , you looser . 
  stop asking other people to pay your bills . 
  i do n't give a shit what you do , as long as * you * pay your own bills . 
  however , you do n't . 
  nor , if one listen to your whining and refusal to take responsibility you will never . 
  estonia did n't even exist as a country when you started to live off eu money . 
  now they are paying for you . 
  why ca n't you be like that ? 
  why do you choose corruption and leeching ? 
  science - try it . 
  if you did , perhaps greece would n't be on the receiving end . 
  and , you are such a fucking retard for comparing greece to sweden . 
  i did n't , on purpose . 
  i compared you to china , india , estonia , chile etc. 
  why have they had a magnificent growth and you have n't ? 
  scientific reason for that please . 
  estonia did n't fucking exist as a country when you started receiving money from the eu , and now they are fucking bailing you out . 
  why ca n't you fix your fucking country ? 
  chile was a dicatorship when you started using * our money * and now they have a better gdp than you . 
  why the fuck are you not growing ? 
  south korea had been devestated by a war and china is * still * a dictatorship .
