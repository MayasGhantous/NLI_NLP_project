  still they are doing better then you . 
  but your are just such a fucking looses that you are not even attempting to take responsibility for that . 
  you just whine , and want the rest of the world to pay for you . 
  why ? 
  why should anybody pay for you ? 
  give me a fucking ** scientific ** reason why you are worse off than everybody else , including chile , china and estonia , and are entitled to money , and not fucking fixing yourself . 
  it is clear from `` arguing '' with you ( i use the term in the loosest way , since you have no fucking clue what science is you looser ) that you blame everything on someone else . 
  greece is apparently not responsible . 
  looser . 
  you are . 
  i want scientfic reasons . 
  do you know science ? 
  ** science ** . 
  give me science . 
  honestly , do n't you know what science is or are you just refusing to admit that you have none . 
  science . 
  try it . 
  you obviously doens ' t know what science is . 
  i do not care for your drivel . 
  give me ** scientific ** reasons as to why * greece should be a net receiver for over 30 years * greece can not fight its corruption * greece can not become as productive as northern europe . 
  you have had 39 years , and 32 years of eu money . 
  with the new buget -39 !!!!, 
  years . 
  more than a generation . 
  why ? 
  why do we have to pay that long for you ? 
  i do not want your opinions which all steems from `` they stupid corrupt people '' and `` people are mean to us '' the crises which is after 2009 . 
  why have n't you fougt the corruption in 1983 ? 
  why did you choose not to become productive in 1991 ? 
  and ** science ** . 
  not your opinions . 
  link to scientfic journals . 
  if chile can work - why not you ? 
  if estonia ? 
  why not you ? 
  etc or , just admit that it is a choice . 
  and you made the wrong one . 
  i still want a scientfic reason as to why greece have to be corrupt and a net receiver . 
  you have not given me that . 
  why are you still corrupt ? 
  look at chile in 1981 , and you - and look at the development . 
  or india , china , south korea , or why not estonia ? 
  i am not talking about the bailouts . 
  i am talking about the fact that since 1981 you have received money from the eu and you are still fucking corrupt and deep in the shit . 
  that is nobodys fault but greece 's . 
  why ? 
  why ca n't you fix that ? 
  how can you think that it is ok to be corrupt , non productive and always receiving ? 
  why are n't you chaning?why should we pay for you for decades ? 
  why ? 
  no , or people ask themselves the same qustions i do . 
  please , since you seem to have the answers - for how long do i have to pay for greece ? 
  why are you ok with a class of countries being net receivers ? 
  why are you ok with the cap ? 
  why are you ok with the cohesion funds ? 
  if they worked , would n't greece spain etc be working ? 
  i do n't think you will answer because people who defend the eu rarely do answer those questions . 
  * for how fucking long do i have to pay for greece * ? 
  i want a number . 
  and , why ? 
  if you are not a coward you will tell me it is forever , since the eu have no plan . 
  or most likely , you will not answer . 
  just give me an answer instead . 
  how are you ok with the fact that greece will be on the receiving end for * a minimum of * ( probably a lot more ) 39 years , and the same goes for spain and portugal ( -6 years ) . 
  how do you defend a permantent class of countries that are just receivers - never give anything . 
  please - give me a scientific answer . 
  in detail . 
  also , if the fucking cohesion funds work - why do we still have countries that are net receivers ? 
  greece has been on the receiving end of those for + 30 years , and they are still . 
  what sort of union are you building ? 
  scientific answer please . 
  i do not think you will answer , you are just one one of those eu wankers who ignore facts . 
  if you do n't - why do i have to pay for greece and for how long ? 
  i am an eu member - why do n't you give a fuck about the fact that we have permanent receivers that are a drainage on the eu ? 
  for how long are we going to pay for them ? 
  why do n't you have a plan or give a fuck ? 
  if you have a plan - give it to me , in detail my guess is that you will not even aswer because you know that you will have to anser that greece is on the receiving end indefinately and you are to much of a coward to admit to that . 
  oh , you are one of those special people . 
  one of those people that does n't need science . 
  and people who speak to you in a way that suits ** you ** give me a fucking ** scientific ** reason why you prefer fucking greece as a partner before the uk ? 
  why is greece a more contrubuting member ? 
  science , please . 
  links . 
  prove it . 
  also , for how fucking long do i have to pay for them . 
  what is the plan of your brilliant eu . 
  you just said `` ups and downs , just like outside the euro '' . 
  well , guess what , we do not have fucking 32 years of down . 
  greece have been a net receiver since they joined the in 1981 . 
  that is not acceptable outside of the eu , and outside of your head . 
  and , they will be for another 7 years with the budget - minimum the fact that you think it is ** normal ** to have countries to be on the receiving end for over a generation is so fucking sick , and * it is not normal * . 
  look at other countries during that time . 
  look at chile , look at india , china , south korea . 
  give me a scientific reason as to why i should still pay for greece . 
  please , science . 
  what is the reason i should pay for them ? 
  i am swedish - please , give me the scientific answer - and when i say that i mean links to proper science papers which you have n't given me why you prefer greece to the uk ? 
  come on - ** give me the scientific answer why greece is better ** ? 
  you have no science . 
  you are just a pathetic looser .
