  if you have the science and the truth - give me the links . 
  otherwise - go home . 
  and please , pay for the south of eu yourself . 
  how hard can it be - you have over 30 years if data . 
  if they contribute to the eu it will be easy to prove that - please do that . 
  i would like to see that data . 
  or , are you just going to whine , instead of understand data ? 
   this is ridiculous , how the fuck are you getting upvoted ? 
  this is a textbook example of straw-man reasoning . 
  u l no , it is an example how you have no clue and give blow jobs to france when you have nothing better to do . . please , if you like science - ** prove me wrong scientifically ** . 
  please tell me why i should support greece for another 14 years , but hate the uk . 
  why ? 
  science ? 
  i inderstand that you do not know basics , but please , give me the scientific answer why the uk is worde than greece ? 
  science !, 
   some eurozone countries are doing well , some are n't . 
  just like the situation outside the eurozone . 
  liar . 
  and asshole . 
  please , evidence for that . 
  no , sweden is not as bad of as greece . 
  and the fact that you are lying says all about you . . you do not care about basic fact . 
   they are not `` not working . '', 
  some things just need time . 
  asshole . 
  liar . 
  39 years of `` working '' . 
  please - how many generations ? 
  if 39 years is not enough for you - how many ? 
  in detail ? 
  and why ? 
  please explain to me in ** scientific ** detail as to why i , my children and grandchildren should pay for greece . 
  i am a scientisct - why ? 
  ** why is the eu ok with permanent net recipients and why are fuckers like you more woried about those , instead of those countries who are actually a drainage ** . 
  i 'd like answers to all my questions please.all of them . 
  why should i pay for greece ? 
  they have been on the receiving end since 1981 - how the ** fuck ** can you defend that ? 
  do you thing my grandchildren should pay ofr greece ? 
  where is your limit ? 
  h baby - still no facts ? 
  pleae expalin to me how greece is far better to the ez than the uk . 
  you  some eurozone countries are doing well , some are n't . 
  just like the situation outside the eurozone i no . 
  then you do not even understand the basic of economics . 
  but i am not surprised . 
  you are an idiot.the eurozone is bad . 
  that is why it is not working . 
  and if you ae sor stupid so you do not understand baic economics . 
  well - you do not . 
   why are we arguing with the uk ? 
  oh right , because the uk government wants to stick its nose in eurozone business , afraid that deepened integration will erode what little influence they have left after dragging their feet as much as they have . 
  or , becausee the fucking ez is trying to make the rest of us pay . 
  why are you asking us , to participate in the ftt or the bank union i think it is so telling that you have no answers . 
  you are ok with greece becoming a permanent net recipient and that we , and my grandchildren are going to pay for them for eages , is ok . you do not even give a fuck . 
  you just give money away . 
  if not - why are you still giving out money to greece ? 
  in detail please ? 
  i 'd like the ** scientific ** answer as to why they can not pay ** why am i still paying for them ? 
  ** in bloody scientific detail , or are you are liar ? 
  of course you did n't mention the things i pointed out , because they are relevant . 
  how can it not be relevant that the uk is one of the best at implementing laws et al , and greece is n't ? 
  how can it not be relevant that instead of arguing against permanent bet recipients that are draining the recourses , you are ranting against one of the few triple a members still left ? 
  how can it not be relevant that the eurozone are arguing with the uk about stuff that is far outside the treaties and has to be implemented just because the eurozone , not the uk fucked up , like the bank union and ftt ? 
  why is the eurozone the blueprint of success . 
  should n't you be a success then ? 
  why are n't you concerned about permanent drainage , not working cohesion funds etc. 
   britain questions european integration as such source for that . 
  they are not questioning the whole integration , they some conntuniations of it . 
  for example - they are not questioning free trade . 
  nor are they questioning really the cap , but they want it to be a smaller part of the budget and changed , which is hardly `` questioning everything '' . 
  they have however gone against a lot of * new * stuff that in no way has been covered in previous treaties and basically have had to be invented on the spot by the euro countries , since the eurozone has such an enormous messed up economy , bank saves , country bail outs etc - none of that is of course anyone elses fault but the eurozone , but that does n't stop those countries from bitching about the fact that britain do not want the ftt so , they are against stuff that is not in the treaties , that the eurozone wants to cover for their failure . 
  that is not being against the eu . 
  sounds like you have a complete eurozone version of events . 
   britain questions european integration as such . 
  and the fact that we have permanent net recipients countries who fuck up their economy , does n't implement stuff and is a drainage on the eu , will be for generations and forces other countries to pay for them and bail them out is a far bigger threat than a triple a member who questions rathe questionable practises * not * covered in the treaty , like the ftt . 
  the fact that you do not grasp that fact is sad . 
  no , first you argued that all credit rating agencies were useless and i asked if you rather buy greeks bonds than finland . 
  if you are against ratings you rate them as equal . 
  i guess you do if you abhor rating agencies . 
  do you ? 
  and , the fact that you do not see the validity of rating an organisation that handles billions of euros/pounds and have enormous financial influence - that says more about you actually . 
  it is an enormous amount of money . 
  rating agencies do not only rate states , they rate organisations that handles huge amount of money . 
  why should the eu be an exception to that ? 
  you never answered me . 
  if you hate rating agencies - do you think greece is a credit worthy as finland ? 
  and - why should the rating increase and not go down if we keep making financially unsound decisions , adding corrupt countries with low ratings etc. 
  i asked you a lot of questions that you have avoided to answer . 
  please do that . 
  you ca n't say that people do not care , because they do . 
  are you saying that the meetings and strategies are just for fun ? 
  furthermore , if ratings are completely unimportant - then you.should be just as ok with loaning money to greece as to finland . 
  are you ? 
  that said , it should n't be overplayed , not are they 100 % accurate . 
  but , with regards to that the eu rating as tou claim is made up by the member states budgets - well do you think a ) it is then good thing to keep on adding countries like croatia and bulgaria . 
  the are not exactly triple a and will of course affect it negatively . 
  b ) countries like france and italy are not doing well - should be reflected in the rating c ) we have a class of countries that have become permanent net recipients , never giving , only receiving , like spain , portugal and greece . 
  is that good , in particular since nothing is being done ? 
  do you think that reflects well on eu 's future and its ability to deal with problems , to have a permanent class of recipients ? 
  d ) one of eu 's biggest budget post , the cohesion funds are bad and ineffective but no one is touching that .
