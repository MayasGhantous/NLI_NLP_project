  explain now in detail why they ca n't use nuclear !, 
  answer it !, 
  and then , if you do n't have any answer ( which you do n't ) , how it is good to reject a good existing technology that lower emissions and instead choose to fuck up for everyone . 
  and , the fact that finlands rector is more expensive - so ? 
  what does denmark cost the world in climate change and the deaths from coal ? 
  plus , their alternative energy is also later and more expensive . 
  denmark had been talking about their alternative energy since the 1970 's !, 
  that is far far later than finland 's reactor , and far more expensive . 
  so your excuse is wrong and does n't work . 
  and - you do n't seem to understand that we have to act now . 
  waiting fifty years like denmark is doing and then perhaps becoming somewhat less is an asshole is not an option . 
  climate change is now , and they have wilfully decided to add to it , instead of fighting it . 
  that makes them assholes . 
  the fact that you can defend a country that wilfully fight a safe clean technology to spew out emissions and ruin the climate for everyone rather rich . 
  you conpletely avoid the question . 
  they have for + 50 years chosen to ruin the climate for all of us , and you premier them . 
  the fact that they , belatedly have lowered their emissions somewhat does n't make them good , it makes them somewhat less of complete assholes . 
  certainly not on a top ten list , or even worthy of being defended . 
  furthermore you did say that nuclear was worse than coal . 
  i am on my phone but please explain that why you said to my statement that nuclear was better than coal that it is a `` false belief '' . 
  that sound like you disagree with that statement then . 
  back it up scientifically . 
  also , you never did scientifically back up the statement that nuclear have hidden costs that make it worse than coal . 
  sounds like you prefer coal . 
  i want scientific articles please . 
  and , you have completely forgotten that denmark , within 10 years , could stop their emissions completely . 
  they do n't care , so they choose not to . 
  that makes them assholes . 
  i agree , but it is still a win-win . 
  if you want the ftt you can have it , if you do n't , one can stay outside . 
  it is ideal . 
  oh , a nice way not to answer . 
  ** it is not orthodox to folllow a treaty you fucking moron ** . 
  and , prove the causation between maastrich treaty and whatever your government has done . 
  scientifically . 
   it happened a lot less before the bailout agreements so i 've got that going for me . 
  and the rules passed using these undemocratic ways are the very rules that the troika requires for handing out the loans . 
  you can make a legitimate argument that it 's the greek government 's fault primarily but your claim that it has nothing to do with anyone else is laughable . 
  so , * it is still in greece , and your goverment * . 
  ** it has nothing to do with the treaty for god 's sake . 
  the fact that there * might * be a correlation ( which it what it means when it happens more often ) does n't mean that there is a causation . 
  that is basic science btw . 
  correlation does n't equal causation . 
  and , even if it was a causation , there is no proof that cause is the troijka , or the treaty . 
  this is you in a nutshell , and why you blame everything on everyone else . 
  first you take an irritation that you have abourt something in greece , and you make this random correlation with something else that you do n't like in eu/troijka/maastricht . 
  the fact that the correlation might not exists , it is not scientific , etc , is something you do n't really pick up upon . 
  furthermore , you ignore facts . 
  facts like - we are independent states . 
  if your goverment does something you do n't like , it is not very likely that it is the fault of someone else but , ** your goverment ** . 
  the treaty , or the troijka or the rest of europe has nothing to do with how your goverment behaves . 
  you are responsible . 
  no one but you . 
  the fact that you ca n't even grasp that simple fact , which frankly , everyone know , is why you are a whiner and someone who blames everyone else . 
  again !!, 
  if your goverment behaves badly , blame them . 
  do not make up fact , do not make up correlation and causation and take responsibility for your goverments actions . 
  i can make up stuff to . 
  since we signed the maastricht treaty we have been in a house bubble . 
  so , obviously that is the fault of the other 25 countries , forcing us to participate in a housing bubble and threatens us if we try to withdraw ... ... . our governments are not addressing it properly . 
  obviously that is the fault of everyone else but our government . 
  and , i bet i can find more correlating statistic than you have . 
  i also have facts on my side . 
  we have a housing bubble and our government ( s ) are underperforming . 
  but , guess what . 
  that is the fault of my goverment ( s ) and no one has forced them not to act . 
  no one !, 
  also , while there might be around the same date , the housing bubble has nothing to do with maastricht treaty . 
  none . 
  and , since i do n't play the blame game you do , i might add - we have no one to blame but ourselves . 
   also , what about the case of the cancelled referendum ? 
  also a tragic choice on the part of the greek government with no element of coercion at all , right ? 
  again , ** nothing to do with the maastricht treaty , signed by 26 countries who has nothing to do with your fucking referendums ** . 
  wtf would poland and sweden have to do with it . 
  you are so stupid that it hurts !, 
  the fact that you so willingly attribute everything wrong with greece to other countries is sad , so sad . 
  it will never help anything . 
  the fact that, 
   you ca n't imagine how infuriating it is that you still insist that this is all i do . 
  not all perhaps , i have no clue where you argue , but on r/europe for example , the simple fact that you can not grasp that what the * greek goverment does * , even if they * chooses * to override democratic rules , has nothing to do with the maastricht treaty is a sign of this . 
  you see , other countries , even those who has signed the maastrich treaty , have goverments too , and one does not need to be undemocratic because of it . 
  it is a choice . 
  a choice made by the greeks , and their government . 
  again , nothing to do with the other 25 countries , who has n't done this . 
  the simple fact that you can not grasp this , is sad . 
  you honestly think it is because of other countries and big mean treaties the goverment acted like that . 
  you apparently can not fathom that they choose to , and no one asked them too , nor were they forced . 
  thus , * it has no place in a discussion about the maastricht treaty * . 
  it has a place in a discussion in r/greece ... 
  but , you being you , will never graps that fact . 
  perhaps it is my fault ? 
  i thought you promised not to argue more ? 
  now , go away , i am sure there is a discussion where you can go and blame poland for greek spending or something . 
    if you had bothered reading the article and giving my point some thought you 'd understand how it all fits together . 
  however , we 've established that you 're an idiot who likes to create strawmen out of other people 's arguments and carricatures out of other people 's characters.c i have read it , as i have written several times but you seem to be unable to actually take in things you read . 
  have you gone to see someone about that ? 
  strawmen ... ... yeah , that is what you say , when you are a ) out of arguments , b ) do not want to take responsibility . 
  i mean , who else fault could it be but the 25 maastricht countries that the greek government does n't do as they wish . 
  obviously it is that fault of poland , sweden et al , and the troijka of course . 
  it has nothing to do with the greeks , or the greek government .
