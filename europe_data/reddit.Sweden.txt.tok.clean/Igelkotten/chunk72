  the countries do not want improvement . 
  and , italy is doing worse than ever and is becoming a net recipient soon . 
  france is also going down . 
  even so , there is absolutely no reason to give more money to greece , or the south . 
  but as i have proven , the eu and its member countries to a majority do not care about science , nor do they seem to have any moral . 
  they are only interested in more money from us , that is all they want . 
  otherwise , their behaviour would be different , but as we all can see it is not . 
  i fear what the eu is turning into . 
  i see how they have fucked up the cap , fucked up the euro , fucked up almost everything they have laid their hands on , and they , instiutions or countries do n't give a shit , they just want more , more money , more power . 
  we are being vastly outnumbered by people who do n't care about the things we care about , who are far more corrupt , do n't give a shit about science , pay less taxes etc , and it is bad to stay in an environment like that . 
  if we are outside , at least our faith will be in our own hands , and not in the fucking hands of the french agricultural minister . 
  a bit from here and there .

  an article on the bitter fighting in 1999 . 
  the south sided with france , they always do .

  about the fighting in 2002 . . [ link ] ( http://www.economist.com/node/1213328 ) . 
  also , the south always side with france , always . 
   perhaps also about the proposed reforms that the south allegedly votes down permanently ? 
  they have n't done it permanently , finally , in particular this time , we got * some * of it through , but it was against the wishes of the south who fought us every single step of the way . 
  as i have shown you , this have been going on practically since the eu was founded and the south is not letting go . 
  they are going to get our mony !, 
  now , cap is by far the biggest post in the budget ( 44 % at the moment ) it is discriminating , far to big , not environmental friendly enough , adjusted to the south etc. 
  i do n't even understand why i should pay for spain 's agriculture , in particular if they do n't even want to reform . 
  so , for decades we are in a union with countries that outnumber us , and refuse , in every way , to reform . 
  who want to be in a union like that ? 
  was this what you were searching for ? 
  a question i have , and perhaps you can answer - greece has been in the eu since 1981 , spain and portugal since 1986 . 
  for how long are we going to give them money ? 
  clearly it is not working , since they have received billions and are in worse shape than ever . 
  by the looks of it , it seems my non existing grandchild will pay off greece 's debt . 
  how can the eu still support that ? 
  if you have done something for 32 years , and it is worse than when you started , why not stop ? 
  should n't there be a time limit for how long we have to support someone ? 
  all those countries pay less taxes than we do to . 
   the fact is that spain has cut the fleet exactly as agreed . 
  you can think that it should be more . 
  and spain is the country to blame for all the illegal fishing for the whole world . 
  that again . 
  no , you have not done exactly as agreed . 
  and , you are by far the worst one in europe , the fact that other horrible countries exists to is no excuse , none .

  do you want more ? 
  i can do this all day you know . 
  frankly , criscising spain 's fishing industry is like shooting fish in a barrell if you excuse the pun . 
  the fact that you support everything that is criscised above is beyond me . 
  how can anyone who is not a retard ( which you are not ) support illegal fishing , destroying other people 's livelyhood , fish on other countrie 's water , but above all * destroy the livestock , outfish the ocean and make sure there are no more fish in the sea ** ? 
  that is beyond me that you and your country think you have a right to do that . 
  it is so egoistical , so narcissitic , and so spanish centric , that it is disgusting . 
  how can anyone defend that ? 
  brw , we are * certainly * not perfect in that regard , but in the last 10 years our government have really , really made an effort , which is noticeable actually . 
  we still have overcapacity though . 
  but , you can bash us too , which we deserve , however , spain is worse . 
  and , the problem is , you choose to . 
  i mean , all countries that fish have the same problems , but one does n't have to side with the fishing industry , not at all . 
   spain is near the average in gdp per capita . 
  http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;plugin=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tec00114 so why are you receiving money then ? 
  should n't they go to countries like bulgaria etc ? 
  you are going to receive it for the next 7 years , not be a contributor . 
   you should define reforms . 
  spain has supported reforms to the migration policies and the eu parliament cap , the biggest budget post of them all . 
  spain is receiving money from that , not paying . 
  it has been needing reformation for decedes . 
  why fight against it ? 
   edit : sweden is getting more structural funds than netherlands with less population and the same gdp per capita , but you know the rules favour rural areas . 
  actually , they have changed the rules for that , for sweden and finland . 
  if we actually followed the rules , sweden/finland should receive far , far more , since we are so sparsly populated . 
  but , they have special rules for us . 
  i do n't even know if i want the eu to have funds to develop rural areas , i think they could give those money back to the countries , and let them do it for themselves . 
   and spain is going from 500 euros to 40 euros per capita . 
  dates ? 
  why should you receive money at all?also , you surpassed the the threshold , but have still still received money . 
  [ link , page 1 ] ( http://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/wps/wcm/connect/02b184804f0189e093b3f73170baead1/chislett011206newsletter_20.pdf?mod=ajperes&amp;cacheid=02b184804f0189e093b3f73170baead1 ) . why ? 
  so , now you are finally getting less , which you should have had less in 2006 . 
  btw , with that per capita income , you can bloody well pay for your fishermen 's unemployment benefits . 
  also , spain will at least receive money until 2020 . 
  that is 34 bloody years !, 
  how long should we pay for spain ? 
  clearly , since the situation is worse than ever in the south , eu 's strategy is not working . 
  if one has done something for 32 years ( which is the case with greece , 27 for spain and portugal ) and it is not working , then one should stop . 
  if it worked , they would not be on the receiving end any more . 
  so , i do n't even care if the eu spends the money on research etc ( keep them ) , but do not give any more money south until we figuer out why it is n't working . 
   the transfers are n't permanent a country can fall . 
  and spain is going from 500 euros to 40 euros per capita . 
  for some they are . 
  greece is hardly on the way to becoming a net contributor , are they ? 
  how many decades shall we pay for them ? 
   yeah , spain is n't doing reforms : but the number of people working in the primary sector is the 20 % of the ones that we have when we joined the eu . 
  how does that change ? 
  everyone 's markets have changed since 1986 . 
   the energy sector has been privatized , the labour market has been liberalized , collective agreements scrapped , pension system changed , public financial sector privatized . . we too !, 
  germany too ( and a reunion upon that ) !, 
  finland too !, 
  how is that an argument ? 
   what reforms are you talking about ? 
  cap , the single biggest post in the eu budget .
