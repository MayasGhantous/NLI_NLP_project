  big mistake . 
  by the time i was drafted in the conscription army , someone had made it known to the whole district . 
  all openness got me was to be locked in a military kitchen fridge . 
  i am so sorry about that . 
   fat load of good they are . 
  high-class neoliberal snobby pile of shite who do n't even live in cyprus 9 out of 12 months of the year . 
  so , there are no one like you ? 
  that must feel incredibly lonely . 
  please , come to western europe . 
  have you tried talking to someone ? 
  a therapist , a close friend , a gay support group ? 
   actually , both switzerland and norway have the pleasure of paying around $ 60 per year and capita to the eu . 
  that 's 2/3 of what other net-payers cough up , but then again neither norway nor switzerland get an equal seat at the table where the rules are made . 
  but they still do n't have to follow the idiotic rules that the eu makes , nor do they have to fear that the eu will take over more . 
  i mean , the cap is 44 % of the budget , and it is worse than what we had before , we are being discriminated against plus that we have to sponsor idiotic stuff like tobacco . 
  to top that off , we * know * we will be downvoted in important stuff and that the eu is not interested in doing what is right , but the south who is more numerous just want to squeeze money from the north . 
  i mean , if they were interested in doing what is right , why vote against cap changes ? 
  if the eu works , why are spain , portugal and greece still on the reciving end after 27-32 years ? 
  norway and switzerland do n't have to fear that the ep is going to vote for another completely idiotic subsidy , or voting to take over another area and ruin it for them , like the eu has ruined the agricultural policy . 
  we are forced to sponsor that . 
   you 'd be surprised , we exist in a bubble to an extent . 
  in a way it makes me a bit sad , but i have high hopes that the bubble is growing every year . 
  just look at the us , they are legalizing it state by state . 
  oh , now i understand . 
  well , in sweden you are not a social outcast . 
  most people do n't care really , one way or another . 
   why is that so surprising ? 
  it 's not like i have control over the first . 
  i am not suggesting that you should have chosen your sexuality , or for that matters that anyone does . 
  i just dont ' understand why you should view yourself in a negative manner , or any gay people for that matter ? 
  i guess i thought that if you were gay yourself , you would know that gay people are not to be feared , or whatever the anti gay lobby preaches . 
  so , i guess that is why i am asking why you are a homophobe . 
   i am also struggling to overcome my sex-negativity ( thinking that sex in general is not something to be celebrated ) . 
  in theory , i know that being sex-positive is the right path . 
  i do n't know if i should say celebrated perhaps , but yes , it can be very nice :-) . 
  good for you if you are overcoming it . 
  are the cypriots homophobes ? 
  i have no idea actually . 
  i figured malta is conservative as hell , but cyprus ? 
  no tobacco is not off the table . 
  then the article was wrong . 
  sorry , here are new ones . 
  [ link 1 ] ( http://epha.org/5646 ) , [ link 2 ] ( http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/danielhannan/100207002/meps-vote-to-subsidise-tobacco-growing/ ) . 
  so , all my tobacco arguments still stands . 
   unfortunately , as i have said , it is not a commission or eu decision to decide what to do , but a member state government to decide . 
  currently , france benefits enormously from the cap , and it blocks any attempt at reform . 
  so do n't blame the eu , blame france . 
  no , that is idiotic . 
  you are avoiding the fact that you that extremely populous states like italy , spain ( and portugal and greece to a far lesser extent ) are voting with them . 
  it is not just france , not by a longshot . 
  and , as i said , the eu is made up by its member countries . 
  apparently , a majority of the people in those countries are * not * interested in reform , not interested in moving forward , not interested in spending money on something better , or a better cap - ** then they would have voted for it , but they do n't ** . 
  can you imagine what those people will do when they put their hands on more of our money ? 
  it is clear , they just want money from the north , without becoming contributors , without reforms and changes . 
  who the hell wants to be in a union where with people whose only interest is squeezing money from you without chaning ? 
  because that is what they are doing . 
  greece have been in the eu for ** 32 ** years , how come they still are even allowed to receive money . 
  and , tell me again how 9 millions swedes alone can change the cap ? 
   again , you 're not really responding to my points , you 're just repeating yourself . 
  neither are you . 
  answer me for how many more decades we shall sponsor greece ?? 
  if the transfers worked , why are we still paying for them?spain and portugal ? 
  when are they going to contribute ? 
  if the eu works , why are we still payinf for them ? 
  where have all our money gone ? 
   i 'm not sure if it 's repressed since i pretty much accept i 'm gay that ai n't going to change any time soon . 
  are you gay and a homophobe ? 
  how does that work ? 
   the eu is not interested in doing what 's right ? 
  first of all , when you say ` the eu ' you mean ` the 28 countries which comprise the eu ' right ? 
  because the countries are the ones who decide eu policy . 
  if they are - why have they sponsored tobacco for decades ? 
  just one example of how they willfully are doing bad stuff ? 
  i mean , if we know what is right , why is the eu refusing to do that . 
   whatever money has flowed from sweden to another country was agreed to by your national government or representatives . 
  if you do n't like it , blame your national government , no one else . 
  no , my country have fought since we joined to reform the cap for example . 
  however , the rest of the eu do n't give a shit . 
  it is * not * my governments fault that we are sponsoring tobacco , and i have no idea how you can claim that . 
  how on earth can you blame the government reinfeldt for the greeks growing tobacco , and getting paid for it ? 
  he is against it , however , no one care . 
  the eu wants a big cap , because it suits the south . 
  we reformed our agriculture in the 70 's , but since the south of the eu do n't want to reform , we have to pay for them . 
  how is that fair ? 
  they outnumber us , they obviously vote for keeping the money flowing so that they do n't have to do what we did - reform . 
  how can you defend the cap ? 
   also , all the money that was lent to greece and other european countries was a loan . 
  none of it was given away for free . 
  ireland has already paid back all the money it was given . 
  portugal is on the way . 
  spain will be next . 
  greece has worse prospects , but you can bet your ass that germany will do everything in its power to get the money it ( and sweden ) lent to greece . 
  the only way you will not see the money lent to greece is if greece defaults . 
  not the money i am talking about . 
  i am talking about the fact that greece have been a recipient of eu money since the entered the eu , 32 years ago . 
  apparently that is money down the drain . 
  for how long they going to be reciepients ? 
  empires have been founded , won and lost in less time than greece can start becoming a contributor . 
  we are just adding countries , but not contributors . 
  why are n't they contributors .
