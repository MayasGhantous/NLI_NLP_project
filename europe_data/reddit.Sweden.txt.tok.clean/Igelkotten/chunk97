  it is nice i guess , both at skansen and in gamla stan but they are quite small to the ones you see in germany and other countries . 
  i 'd guess that poland would have something big , but maybe i am dreaming . 
  why not ? 
  i warn you , our journalists are pretty dense . 
  do n't keep it up . 
  you are saying that treaties are unimportant and that we should start financial transfers to welfare programs within the union without voting and ignoring current treaties that explicitly says no to that . 
  i think it is sad that you do n't even remotely want to follow the law or democracy . 
  and , you are defending the current cap . 
  sad , really . 
   so democracy should not be proposed until there is a treaty change to get rid of the king/whatever , womans suffrage should not be proposed until they are given the right to vote and unions should not be proposed until they are made legal . 
  petty rules lawyering does not help anyone . 
  petty rules !, 
  are you saying that not wanting to give up sovereignity is * petty ruling * ? 
  do you think * following and respecting treaties * is ** petty ruling ** . 
  if that is * petty ruling * , why should we have any treaties ? 
  should n't just brussels tax us all ? 
  or , shall we foollow any rules - at all . 
  you apparently think it is unimportant to follow treaties . 
  please , explain to me how you are going to build anything worthwhile while not even attempting to respect the law and treaties ? 
  do you want anarchy or dictatorship - because what you ar suggesting is so much against democracy that it is not even funny . !, 
   so democracy should not be proposed until there is a treaty change to get rid of the king/whatever , womans suffrage should not be proposed until they are given the right to vote and unions should not be proposed until they are made legal . 
  petty rules lawyering does not help anyone . 
  what ? 
  44 % of the budget , do n't you get that . 
  and , are you defending the cap in its current form . 
  good , i 'll take you on . 
  whty do you support tobacco and wine subsidies ? 
  why do you discriminate swedes and finns ? 
  why have you refused , for decades to become more competitive . 
  i would like answers , in detail please . 
   also to respond to the other message you posted . 
  yes , the cap needs more reform , and it 's constantly getting it . 
  personally i believe forestry is marginalized right now while luxury goods are given too high priority . 
  but that discussion is different than saying we must scrap the cap , it serves its purpose , and we can afford to buy a bit of resource security . 
  * i never said scrap it * . 
  where did i say that ? 
  i said the cap in its current form is idiotic , plus that you want to use it , against the treaties , against democracy . 
  it is scary how little you respect democracy and treaties . 
  do you even care , remotely . 
  if you want the rest of the eu to sponsor welfare in another country , we are talking about the end of the national state , and a federation on a whole different level . 
  how can you refuse people to vote about that ? 
  how can you support that without going through the proper channels ? 
  no , it was the biggest morning paper , dagens nyheter . 
  they are supposed to be better , or at least know math better than a fifthgrader . 
  there is one thing having a cap and making sure we will not starve do death in case of war . 
  it is a completely different thing spending 44-38 % of the eu budget on the cap and among other things sponsor wine and tobacco . 
  i had no idea they were needed for our food security ... what essential nutrients do they hold for the human body again ? 
  it is not up to the eu to fight unemployment really . 
  that is up to the individual countries , and should not be considered , unless you think the the eu should completely change its treaty and give up in individual states and become a federation . 
  even then , should n't we wait until after we actually have changed the treaty ? 
  i do n't really understand you - you seem to think that the eu should take care of social spending and welfare without it being in the treaty . 
  that is a huge step and i do not understand why you do n't want to wait for a treaty change . 
  furthermore , while no one denies that we should have cap - do you think the 44-38 % we have of the budget is really ok ? 
  it is a good thing then that we still have to spend millions moving between strasbourg and brussels . 
  god forbid we spent that money on research or education . 
  thank you france . 
   i just have the net and what small fraction of it i come across well , that is comforting . 
  are you going to talk about conspiracy theories next ? 
   i hav n't come across any arguments convincing enough to abandon a serious , eu-specific implementation of it . 
  well , i have given you several , that there are no academics involved , that there are no pre studies , you do n't even have any arguments why it should be done - nothing , but you refuse to listen . 
  and , the fact that you ca n't answer any of my questions - do n't think i am not noticing it . 
   in terms of the cost of a study , a handfull of millions ( 10 economists/researchers @ $ 80k/year for a few years , say ) is trivial both on an absolute scale ( eu gdp is 12.9 t euro ; 10m is 8e-5 % of eu gdp ( 0.00008 % ) ) , and when considered against the potential quality of life increase/benefit to society . 
  no , it ** is n't ** . 
  how many projects do we have that are good ? 
  you have no arguments , whatsovever , that * your * study is better than thousands of other studies . 
  do n't you know how many thousands of serious scientists , who are truly trying to improve things , that are applying for money every year . 
  hundred of thousands , in germany alone for god 's sake , and if you take it on an eu wide scale - millions . 
  however , without any science , you are claiming that your project is the best without even having any pre studies . 
  the fact that you think it is just a `` few millions '' means that you have no idea what science costs , or how much research is being done . 
   against the potential quality of life increase/benefit to society . 
  unlike new medicine who does n't improve life ? 
  unlike environmental studies who might help serious environemntal problems . 
  what makes your study better than thousands of others ? 
  and , unlike them , they have serious studies , pre-studies and real problems to point at . 
  you have nothing of that . 
  your argument was that `` the swiss discuss it so it must be good '' . 
   i linked you to an entire journal dedicated to ubi . 
  non academic one , given out by themselves , and political as well . 
  why do n't you link me to serious articles , in serious economical journals ? 
  well , because you seem to have none . 
   the consolation for me is that others will read through this and come to more reasonable conclusions . 
  i am comforted by that the fact that others might read this and see that you have no arguments whatsoever , and no scientific background or backup . 
   why would you say no to that ? 
  because while i love research and science , i still do n't see any need to spend millions of euros upon this project . 
  in fact , the more i communicate with anyone of you guys , the less interested i am in this . 
  your arguments are non existant , and extremely poor , and utterly non academic . 
  what more , none of you seem to have even gone to anything beyond high school , looking at your arguments . 
  i 'd much , much , rather spend those money at genetic studies and stem cell research . 
  sigh , and you still have n't answered my questions . 
  do n't think i have n't noticed . 
   i guess if you 're a social scientist then it 's ok . no , the natural sciences . 
  i like the hard stuff . 
  however , if anyone of you had the slightest inclination to even attempt to answer my questions in any academic way , you would have done so immediately of course . 
  ask me about anything i know and study , and i 'll bombard you with academic articles ( although i generally avoid it here , most other people are not as nerdy as i ) . . now you only * slightly * attemted to do that after me calling you out and asking if you were cowards . 
  had you actually had any arguments beyond `` they are discussing it in switzerland so it must be super duper let us spend millions of euros on it , '' you would immediately , when i asked for it , posted it . 
  so , what you and the other supporters have conviced me off , that none of you , and the initiative have no academic credibility whatsoever , and even if you got the money , you frankly would just waste them . 
  no , thanks , the money is so much better spent on proper research , with real scientist who atually know what they are talking about . 
  * you are still not answering any of my qustions * why are you so afraid to link to the serious acadecemic studies ? 
  why ca n't you answe my questions ? 
  are you afraid to admit it that there are no studies and you guys have no academic credibility , that you have nothing and do not even know basic science , basic studies and that none of you can spell economics ?
