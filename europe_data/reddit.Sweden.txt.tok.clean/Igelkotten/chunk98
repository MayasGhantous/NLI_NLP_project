   if you mentioned switzerland as an example of a good system that does n't need a ubi , then the fact that it 's being discussed gives ubi even more credibility as simply the next step in societal evolution . 
  that is the most idiotic statement ever . 
  no , the fact that something is being discussed , does n't mean that one need it . 
  if so , you admit that european union need torture and death penalty , because sometimes that is being discussed . 
  so , ** please ** start answering my questions . 
  i am tired of you avoiding it !, 
  give me the bloody studies , or i am just going to assume you have no clue what you are talking about - you do n't even seem to know how science works to be honest . 
   i said a tax on luxury goods and services and a raising finance corporation taxes , where most of the money is concentrated . 
  so , how would a basic income be financed in sweden ? 
  explain in detail please . 
  furthermore , for a study of this size , there has to be a lot of pre-studies and academic papers . 
  why ca n't you link to those ? 
   you basically just said ' i want to sign the petition ' , because this is exactly what it is going to do !, 
  what on earth are you talking about . 
   saying ` sweden does n't need it ' , while it might be true , needs to be considered in context . 
  it 's nothing to take personally . 
  it is if any eu money is to be spent . 
  besides , * if * it were to come true it would involve sweden , end of the national state and a change of treaties . 
  i 'd say that concerns us - a lot . 
   by that i mean they 've done preliminary research . 
  good , links and and names and academic credibility . 
  the pre studies one usually does for a study of that size , and the pre study everyone who is a bit serious about academics would demand . 
  seriously , do you really think universities , companies , governments , states , spends billions upon billions of dollars in different forms of projects without pre-studies ? 
  actually , just to get the money from a research fund , or at least the amount of money you are asking , one needs pre-studies . 
  if not , any dolt could just text a message and get milllions of euros - is that the way you think we should hand out research money ? 
  why are n't you more concerned with research money ? 
  why do you think it is ok to just hand out millions of euros without the proper documentations ? 
  what sort of attitude is that ? 
  is that how you want the eu to be run ? 
  seriously , none of my questions have been answered and none of you seem even to have a basic knowledge of how research is done . 
  the more i hear from you , the more i am against not just basic income , but even the study , handing it over to people not out of high school is not a smart move - for an initiative like this i would expect several phd 's in economics . 
  ** oh yes there has been it has been talked about since the 18th century you dolt which you would have known if you had any clue what you were talking about ! ** . 
  oh , and you still have n't answered any of my questions , of course !, 
  all of you you are defending the basic income initivative seems to be complete academic and scientific morons who does n't even know * how * a study is performed . 
  for example , you * conveniently * forgot to answer the question about the pre-studies , that should of course , be all over the place for a study of this size . 
   if you are want a basic income you should have some basics facts - you do n't have anything  not true . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/basic_income#arguments  http://www.basicincome.org/bien/papers.html * if * you had studied at university you should know that wikipedia is not enough . 
  ** why ca n't you give me proper scientific papers from academic journals that answers my questions ? 
  why ? 
  **  here are proposals for financing basic income . 
  explain then in detail how it is going to be financed in sweden please . 
   why do you not want to even find out ? 
  why are you against an initiative that wants to find out ? 
  explain this to me . 
  because it is my country and a suggestion on eu level would affect it , and we would also sponsor it . 
  we ca n't sponsor * everything * , which i hope you understand , so why ca n't you give me * proper academic studies * why basic income is good , why is it better then welofare etc. 
  again , why ca n't you give me scientific studies - proper ones . 
  no , you are just being against more research . 
  as simple as that . 
  why ? 
  fuck you , i am not against more research , but you apparently are . 
  i am a scientist and i have on several occasions said that it is one thing the eu should invest in . 
  ** however ** , if you honestly had a slightest clue about * proper * studies , you should actually know that they are very wel written , and one has , for big initiative like this . 
  proper and very serious `` pre-studies '' . 
  ** if you had any clue what you are talking about you should know that this is how science works ! . 
  why , if it such a serious and good initivative , ca n't you behave like scientists ? 
  why ca n't you do the serious pre-studies ? . 
  how can anyone be trusted with research money that ca n't even remotely behave like a scientists ? 
  what stops you from behaving like scientists ? 
   how do you know basic income will result in higher taxes than the ones you pay right now ? 
  you said you planned to finances it by raising taxes . 
  so i assumed that meant - raised taxes . 
  if not - how are you going to finance it in sweden . 
  in detail please . 
   it is completely possible to prove that something has more drawbacks than benefits well , you have n't even given me an academic study that proves it has benefits in sweden . 
  i want that . 
  if it so easy - do it !, 
  if you are want a basic income you should have some basics facts - you do n't have anything , you frankly do n't even seem to be aware of that it needs a new eu treaty and new constitutions . 
  what do you know ? 
  what can you prove ? 
   i use words like could , but if you show me academic studies disproving the things i said could be true , i wo no , it is up to * you * to prove it , it is not up to me to disprove it . 
  you are asking me basically to prove that `` this will not happen '' . 
  i ca n't prove that , ever , no one can , so it is up to * you * to prove stuff . 
  it is impossible for me to prove a negative you see . 
   i personally like about basic income that it is a potential replacement for a whole elaborate government system providing everyone in need with what they need so , what is lacking in sweden ? 
  what is lacking in switzerland ? 
  what is lacking in norway ? 
  in detail , please . 
   as such it could potentially bring taxes down , not up !, 
  according to what academic study . 
  otherwise , you are just pulling things out of the air , prove that statement !, 
   and there are no conclusive academic studies that i am aware of that either prove or disprove that . 
  again , i am assuming that you have never ever studied anything past high school because you should know then how one proves things and that it is impossible to prove a negative . 
   and the chance for improving many countries ' welfare systems in a real sense , not just by `` rising taxes more until everyone gets a lot '' , is worth the costs from the european union 's budget . 
  no , raising taxes can be very bad , depending on what taxes and what context . 
  furthermore , if you want the eu to raise them , we are talking a * whole * different ballgame . 
  i am sure you are aware that it is illegal , and that it would mean a completely new treaty that needed to be approved by all countries , plus that i think in almost all cases ( i know for sweden is it true ) it would mean changing in the constitutions , since it would essentially mean the end of the individual states . 
  do you want that really ? 
  why ? 
  the fact that you have no academic studies and frankly , are asking me to disapprove things , instead of proving them themselves , which is the correct way , tells me you have no clue what you , or any of those people are talking about , none of you can even have gone to university , then you should no that the burden of proof is on you , not on me . 
  i think the proposal is absolutely madness , and your answers only make me more sure of that . 
  well , some say that , but some not . 
  i have been in several discussions with people saying that the lack of schooling is * only * due to discrimination and the criminality is only due to poverty and discrimination etc. 
  that is bullshit of course . 
  i happen to think that romas , just like other people are responsible for their actions . 
  in fact , it is racism to excuse them the whole time . 
  why is it good to receive more than welfare ? 
  in details , with regards to sweden i would like for you to answer why our welfare is to low and what is wrong with it . 
  in detail !, 
  i do n't see how anything you say is in compliance with sweden you see .
