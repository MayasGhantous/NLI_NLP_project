  did n't know they were into that stuff . 
  dear finland , help us fix the cluster fuck that is our schools . 
  signed , your dear neighbour . 
  ofc not . 
  i do hope they had [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-eqja8ahac ) musical theme . 
  otherwise i , and many other with me i 'm sure , will be very dissapoint . 
  why the hell would you do that you imbecile ? 
  the german government is at fault , not vattenfall . 
  it does in this case . 
  the country was occupied by a foreign power and had a dictatorship imposed on it , that used brutal measures to rule . 
  simple . 
  there is a difference between propaganda and plain empiric of how the situation looked like in countries occupied by the soviet union . 
  [ here , ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/j%c3%b6nk%c3%b6ping ) its a nice city and county though . 
  i 'm going to take the liberty to despise people who goes to fight for a sect of murderers . 
  they ca n't just run of fighting for what is basically a murderous sect and then come crying and regretting their choice when it was n't fun anymore . 
  they are n't the victims here you know , they are the ** perpetrators ** . 
  what do you think these poor innocent lil girls have been doing down there with isis ? 
  there are a lot of reports of the foreign combatant women being as bad as the men . 
  let them be in their islamic paradise . 
  yes , lets remove anything that does n't suit the tali ... radical feminist groups . 
  reminds me of the taliban blowing up the buddha statues . 
  you reap what you sow . 
  they wanted an islamic state , now they should be made to enjoy it permanently . 
  i know , i was actually kinda shocked that those continentals beat us , got ta be some measurement error . 
  i do apologise on behalf of us . 
  in general if you want to have a language in the school curriculum that is viable in europe english is it . 
  i mean russian wo n't get you around anywhere but russia . 
  thts good for you to learn , our language will be nice for you to communicate with us , after you lose in hockey :d, 
  its not a problem . 
  russian is useless in europe anyway . 
  seeing as we do n't use gas its a 100 % of ** nothing ** ... 
  my point is that such a decision wo n't be viable with such a weak minority government . 
  it will hold no legitimacy what-so-ever . 
  you had to have lived under a rock not to know how skilled hackers are in general , and that they will get the stuff they want . 
  these dumb women have themselves to blame . 
  wo n't fly in the riksdag i.e no , wo n't happen . 
  given the havoc the religious right have wrecked in your country the last 34 years it kinda is evidence of the cluster fuck that is religion merged with political interests . 
  stuff like this makes one appreciate france more . 
  finally some common fucking sense . 
  if you are a young hot celeberty woman , why the fuck would you upload nudes to an icloud , ofc someone 's gon na hack it . 
  that 's posturing to keep hard-liners at home happy ( to give of a fuck you west image ) and calm russia down . 
  you got ta understand that his boss , ali khameni , deals in realpolitik , and would not hesitate to sell gas to the west given the opportunity . 
  compared to essentially taking it for the team for 14 years a weak lire could actually do something to restore the viability of italian industries , and the massive italian tourism sector . 
  there is no doable solution to italys problems within the ez . 
  you 're right , i should have phrased it as the only fix . 
  italy has , comparably , been in a [ slump ] ( http://statsneuro.blogspot.se/2013/04/economics-diary-in-euro-area-between.html ) since the introduction of the euro . 
  greece should focus on getting its oligarchs in the shipping industry to pay taxes , by removing their [ tax exemptions ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/taxation_in_greece#tax_exemptions ) ... 
  there is quite the [ easy fix ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/11112293/the-solution-to-italys-woes-is-quite-simple-leave-the-euro.html ) for that . 
  you 'd say then that in the political culture in catalonia is much less acceptable with corruption ? 
  cheers , would be interesting to see how much a catalan state would differ from spain in the general operations of institutions and political culture . 
  would an independent catalonia be less corrupt and clientilist than present day spain ? 
  hah , i had no ide\u00e4 that it was based on a danish show until i looked it up just now , and that it was that similar . 
  got ta check that series out . 
  ca n't really decide , but a few are ; [ j\u00e4garna ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116736/ ) , [ s.o.s en segels\u00e4llskapsresa ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/s.o.s._%e2%80%93_en_segels%c3%a4llskapsresa ) and [ j\u00f6nssonligan ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/j%c3%b6nssonligan ) . 
  in addition to this there are a few good old tv-series . 
  damn , hat of to the czechs . 
  that is impressive . 
  well you 're iranian , and iranians as a group are , as far as i know , one of the most successful immigrant groups in a lot of european counties , my own country included . 
  this due to iranians in europe as a group in general belonging to the educated class that fled iran after the revolution . 
  watching a sequence of baywatch with german dubbing traumatized me for life . 
  so what should the eu do ? 
  send hungary right into the waiting arms of putin ? 
  no , they 're just caring parents . 
  this ai n't rocket surgery . 
  lol , parents organising to keep an eye on teenagers ( we have the same organisation here as well ) is not in any way similar to this morality police . 
  that would be malm\u00f6 . 
  tariffs against cheep chinese crap would be a good thing . 
  that country has gotten a free ride from the west during the last 35 years . 
  because the handling of say teh ez crisis has been such a fucking success right ? 
  lol . 
  of course everyone is offended !, 
  its worse than being run by the french i.e. 
  going down the drain , you should leave it to britain , they 'd handle it in a competent manner . 
  a `` leader '' ca n't hide under the us skirt , still 70 years onwards , and at the same time play king of the eu . 
  germany is a naked king , and putler knows it . 
  do you have trouble reading boy ? 
  as i wrote , to supply the ukraine with materials would be the sensible thing to do . 
  russia will have a war regardless , as we 've seen these last few days , and no it would n't , energy would be the main stimulant , look at the russian economic make up . 
  their military industry is still decimated and by in large produces inferior goods . 
  the only reason for him to use nukes would be an attack against russia , otherwise that is unlikely to happen . 
  yeah , i 'm talking about starting a war against russia . . 
  lets provide subclinical aid to the ukraine , military equipment , intel . 
  that is what would help . 
  and how well is that diplomacy going now then ? 
  what trump cards does europe hold ? 
  putler knows that merkel needs his gas , he does n't care about food shortages in his own country , and as most reputable outlets reports the oligarchs are too scared to do shit . 
  he has an huntington-esque world view and he 's not gon na fold . 
  you know what makes me laugh , that is you god damned dumb gullible germans . 
  german `` leadership '' has been an unbelievable disaster for europe during these last five years , be it this or the cluster fuck that is the ez . 
  you need a source on that he conquered the oligarchs ? 
  that is an [ established fact ] ( http://www.cfr.org/world/putin-oligarchs/p8018 ) . 
  go on then german , tell me the `` smart way '' . 
  edit : seems you wo n't give up the `` smart way '' , lol . 
  he has the oligarchs thoroughly under his thumb . 
  to believe that he 'd use nukes , even tactical ones at this stage is bizarre . 
  i 'm still waiting for you to reveal `` the smart way '' . 
  seems plausible , he seems intent on making the ukraine landlocked . 
  and what is the new revolutionary way of dealing with russia ? 
  ca n't do that !, 
  germany wants its gas , ca n't challenge the energiewende .
