  so what ? 
  the danes are actually capable of running their country and hence are free to spend their money any way they choose , also compared to the south the danish economy and currency looks very attractive . 
  if the people in the south/east are unhappy with their sitaution they can start with actually electing politicians who are n't idiots / corrupt / from a well connected family etc. 
  thank you for a very detailed answer . 
  to create a new identity out of mixed heritage like slovenia is not something that is common . 
  i mean look at serbia and bosnia as an examples of a states that has yet to come to term with their mixed heritage . 
  thses new reports about 0,-whatever - growth in france really did a number on the leaderships confidence it seems . 
  this is a load of relativist bollocks is n't it ? 
  you 're either a man or woman , period . 
  a former habsburg / hre country that returned to its previous sphere and counsequently managed to separate itself from the turbo-folk crowd . 
  it has some nice castles and scenic country side and the few slovenians i 've meet ( mostly women ) have been relaxed , easy going and openminded . 
  @slovenians : how do you look back at the yugoslavian `` heritage '' ? 
  so who is gon na operationalize the `` acceptable '' european norms ? 
  who is gon na interpete , judge and enforce these verdicts ? 
  these are * very * murkey waters . 
  the problems for greece are much more severe than the high unemployment , i mean they had the psi-agreement last year and will likely soon recieve a similar haircut to the troika loans . 
  greece will never get low interest rates again , regerdless of whether the country is the the euro or not . 
  there is simply no way they 'll get the pre 2009 rates again without a full transfer union . 
  spanish unemplyment has been high for a long time , even before the crisis i.e. 
  its nothing new really . 
  rather this is what you get with a absurdly rigid labour market that caters soley to people already on the `` inside '' . 
  i thought you people came here to buy butter ? 
  ah , that explains it . 
  i was suprised since i thought belgium would be like brussels ( wich is very nice in terms of arcitecture ) . 
  uppsala , sweden : [ anders celsius ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anders_celsius ), 
  it kinda depends on were you live , this since our country ( sweden ) is kinda vast in terms of size . 
  in the south and along the coast lines people eat alot of [ salmon ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gravlax ) , herring , eal , trout , shirmps while game such as [ elk ] ( http://www.recept.nu/recept_nu/huvudratt/vilt/jagargryta_pa_alg/ ) , deer and game birds is much more common in the villages in the inlands . 
  in the far north [ reindeer ] ( http://recept.se/content/renskav-med-rotfrukts-och-potatismos-och-rarorda-lingon ) and dried fish are staples . 
  we also eat al lot of fruit and berrys ( since eveyone is free to pick them in forests ) . 
  wtf , is this style common in belgium ? 
  not helping oprah = ! racism ... 
  as said in the introduction finland was a part of my country ( sweden ) for a long time . 
  ( do please come back and help us with policy areas we are n't competent enough to fix ourselfs like immigration , education , defence , energy , et.al ) also , we 're totally better than them in hockey , as we 've shown numerous times  as for food you lot should try `` finsk sommarsoppa '' it 'll grow on you after a few plates :d, 
  yes , i hope they 'll fix our education system , among other things that we ca n't amnage ourselvs . 
  ofc !, 
  ( as long as we do n't have to pay any catholics ) , 
  it seems you 're right as shown below . 
  then its probably the `` regioanl savings banks '' that has been forking out the cash i.e corrupted local/regional poiticians stealing money . 
  * `` 4.2 eu funding in spain ( according to the oscar faber study ) , 1994 to mid-1999 resources ( actual expenditure including structural and cohesion funds as well as eib , and national resources ) focussed on road ( 77 % ) , rail ( 16.5 % ) , ports ( 3.8 % ) , air ( 1.6 % ) , other / mixed modes ( 1.2 % ) . 
  one reason provided for lower expenditure on rail projects is that project design is more demanding and implementation more complicated than for roads . 
  the objective 1 ex post evaluation ( 1994-1999 ) mentions that 19 % of total sf resources ( excluding cf ) are dedicated to roads , 2 % to rail , around 1 % to ports and 1 % to airports . 
  the year 1999 marks an increasing focus on rail , and the strategic reference framework for 2000-2006 introduces a focus on high-speed rail , improved road access to france and portugal and improved port conditions . 
  looking at the cohesion fund allocations during 2002-2004 , it is noteworthy that eu contributions worth 3,333.5 million $ went to rail , followed by 837.6 million $ for maritime transport , and only 430.6 million $ for road transport . 
  4.3 other sources of financing this section gives an overview of other sources of financing for transport infrastructure . 
  '' * * `` eib the eib has provided a substantial number of loans ( more than 200 ) in the period 1994 - 2006 amounting to in total approximately 22.2 bn $ . 
  the overall distribution of loans is : road 28 % , rail 23 % , urban public transport 24 % , aviation 22 % and ports 3 % . 
  the last decade the loans for the rail sector are dominated by the investments done in the high speed rail lines . 
  the urban public transport loans are almost all related to feasibility studies and construction of new metro lines in barcelona , madrid , malaga , seville , valencia and bilbao . 
  it also includes loans for the purchase and lease of rolling stock . 
  part of the recent eib loans is also dedicated to ppp projects , especially in the road sector namely motorways ( santiago brion , de los vinedos ) and in urban public transport for the metro in madrid . 
  '' * - study on strategic evaluation on transport investment priorities under structural and cohesion funds for the programming period 2007-2013, 
  spain aleady got it all ; trains , highways , airports , docks , you name it . 
  to build even more is just a waste of eu tax payer money . 
  also , spanish politicians ( both local , regional and national ) across the spectrum are corrupt to the core . 
  it simply wo n't be worthwhile . 
   also , still waiting for the damn swedes to pay up for plundering , raping and burning down my village a few years earlier . 
  when we get present day vorpommern ( schwedisch-pommern ) and rugen back . 
  otherwise you aint getting jack shit :d, 
  but structural / regional funds will lead to economic convergence and ( nowadays ) end the crisis !!, 
  stuff like this is what the eu should be doing , along with removing ntb : s and such . 
  true . 
  the map does in an easy way illuminate why we have our present allgiences within the eu . 
  over ? 
  i know that the new idea is to fix the crizis through buzzwords but to claim that is is over kinda sounds ridiculous . 
  i mean is the situation in improving in france ? 
  no , spain ? 
  slightly due to tourism but over all no , italy ? 
  not really , rather the government is more likely to collapse due to yesterdays verdict i.e no , it is not over by a long shot . 
  [ these would be your heroes i assume ?

  [ gustav vasa ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gustav_i_of_sweden ), 
  not aiding finland in wwii was/is extremely shameful . 
  that just servs the us right . 
  i hope we 'll continue monitoring american data trafic that crosses our border . 
  there needs to be some balance to us spying . 
  we 've been at war a few times . 
  they 've got good looking women and a couple of nice citys that were rebuilt to match the originals after wwii . 
  we 've got some polish dentists and doctors here and it is fairly common for students who ca n't get accepted to medical programmes ( due to dumb quoatas ) to edcate themselfs in poland . 
  i do n't disagree with the message in general , it 'd be foolish for the uk to leave the eu . 
  it is not an empire anymore and hence ca n't manage alone , also it ca n't develop their `` special relationship '' with the us since that is akain to be a fulltime bitch to the us . 
  i am mearly seeing the hypocracy of a polish official trying to school the uk in a slightly arogant manner while his country is by far the biggest leecher of other peoples money . 
  the messanger does in this case have a very large stake in target audience staying . 
  therefore critizising the messanger is waranted . 
  so the biggest net recipient of eu money ( poland ) wants one of the largest net contributors ( britain ) to stay . 
  why am i not suprized . 
  it is a nice , crime free , clean and safe vacation spot ( if you avoid the casino and the stuff around it due to cruize tourists ) . 
  i 'm not saying that progress has not been made , im simply saiying that greek governments have missed their targets by huge margains and will continue to do so . 
  tax collection has not been improved . 
  i mean yeah , they 've caught some high profile evaders but over all they are still [ behind target ] ( http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite2_1_15/07/2013_509347 ) no , they 've randomly fired local police and school janitors ( lol ) , these were known for being dysfunctional and getting their positions through relatives but the real issue is with incompetent personel within central ministries . 
  that is were they should * sack a lot * of pople , preferably like with ert , that was how is should be done . 
  stuff like a land register has been asked by the eu for about 23 years but still they simply wo n't create one ( because of the summer homes ) and this is mirrored in several reforms so nothing will happen in even a decade . 
  yes they are , the union people at syntagma do n't want to reform , rather they simply want their old privilages back , like bus driver who got bonuses for actually doing their jobs or traindrivers in athens who could earn 8k euro/month , ( fucking ridiculous ) . 
  usually these people manage to get their way . 
  all a greek politician needs to do is to use some greek nationalism and voila someone else is responsible . 
  have they managed to liberalize the closed sectors ? 
  no , to fix tax collection ? 
  no , to trim the civil service of incometent staff who got jobs from relatives ? 
  no , managed to cut red tape ? 
  no , managed to establish a land register yet ? 
  ( not sure about this one , but my gut feeling is no ) .
