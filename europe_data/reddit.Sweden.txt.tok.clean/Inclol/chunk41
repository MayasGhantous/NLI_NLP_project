  glad you enjoy it . 
  our of curiosity , do you do the same thing between you at the iberian peninsula ? 
  are they endangered here ? 
  nope . 
  do we have tightly regulated hunting ? 
  yes are lions endangered ? 
  yes . 
  is hunting of lions well regulated ? 
  nope . 
  there you go . 
  [ corruption is rife in the [ spanish judiciary ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/08/us-spain-corruption-idusbrea070au20140108 ) , as well as [ local government ] ( http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/s0176268012000353 ) . this is common knowledge . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/charlemagne/2009/03/why_is_spain_so_corrupt ) is also a good article that compares our countries , among others . 
  [ nope ] ( http://www.transparency.org/cpi2014/results ) . 
  cold be it , he might be trying to make himself understood , in a danish fashion . 
  no , we 're not a nearly as corrupt as spain . 
  do n't make us send our politicians to you !, 
  which means ? 
  would n't expect anything less from norway . 
  yes , he dislikes gardells ' humor and the weirdos in the pride parade , what is the controversy ? 
  i never claimed it was fabricated . 
  i do however absolutely think they 'll use the worst angle possible . 
  as they did in the article with gardell 's hyperbole . 
  i would say a paper like svd , di or aff\u00e4rdsv\u00e4lden , i.e. 
  not a tabloid like expressen . 
  jonas gardell is a `` character '' , there is nothing offensive in that description . 
  also expressen is hardly a credible source as it colludes with leftist extremists to register political opponents . 
  furthermore , he also is n't really saying anything that 'd be considered extremist outside of the swedish media circle jerk . 
  as for your second claim , it seems to lack a functioning source . 
  do you have any credible sources for your claims ? 
  it 's spain ; you can always bribe someone . 
  not to the extent that nafta absolutely slaughtered manufacturing , steel et.al . 
  that is not the case , you 're over simplifying to make it fit your lill neat view of reality . 
  if we actually look the developments within the us middle class i.e. 
  the economic backbone of any western country it has seen its incomes dwindle , especially the now former middle class in the rustbelt / midwest . 
  just because some fucking fat-cats and/or companies have a much higher worth and can distribute more to its shareholders does n't mean that the country is better of , there is no such correlation . 
  you honestly think that ravaging the middle class , increased concentration of wealth and the financialization us has benefited the average american ? 
  since it hyas `` benefited the whole country '' ? 
  in what way is the country now better of ? 
  you 're the one who should educate yourself , rather than parroting the theoretics of macro a. 
  you 're essentially arguing that gdp is good a measure of how good a society is of . 
  i should have been specific - it ca n't have a conflict with a member state ( and i think other candidate countries ) , hence turkey . 
  as for your examples the ageean one between greece and turkey is indeed a good one , but i 'm not actually sure whether this one is subject to other international laws . 
  come on , the economy was based to a substantial part on money laundering , it was the entry point of russian mob money into the eu all the way until the crash . 
  at that is had/has major issues with human trafficking . 
  man i do not envy the spy that has to note what kinda porn german politicians watch . 
  it is bound to be something degenerated and ungodly enough to send the poor spy to therapy for years . 
  no , i 'm mearly saying that greece blackmailed the eu . 
  if we were to look at the core requirements to join one is that you ca n't have a territorial conflict with neighbours , which cyprus has . 
  also , cyprus was n't ready to join , its economy as an example was a racket . 
  this does n't mean that i do n't think the turks should be driven of the island to put an end to their illegal occupation . 
  ask the average american worker residing in the `` rust belt '' about nafta . 
  ah , another outsourcing agreement . 
  this 'll surely benefit the average eu worker in industries and such . 
  [ here you go , read the whole page 59 to catch up on some of that fine greek `` solidarity '' ] ( https://books.google.se/books?id=bqemagaaqbaj&amp;pg=pa59&amp;lpg=pa59&amp;dq=eastern+enlargement+greece+veto&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ne1iwlihcn&amp;sig=se-qjg8g-iobt1cpyvrd_8dkoay&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ccoq6aewawovchmiwlpfhrbvxgivxa0sch3ieq1b#v=onepage&amp;q=eastern%20enlargement%20greece%20veto&amp;f=false ) . 
  edit : as a bonus , [ here you can read about the time greece blackmailed the eu in connection with the spanish & portugese eu-accession , pages 14-15 . 
  do please note that it is a pdf ] ( http://aei.pitt.edu/43444/1/cunha_eec_3rd_enlargement.pdf ) . 
   or i could even argue that poland and the baltics did benefit of the greek solidarity when we did n't veto their eu membership back in ' 04 , at a time when they were probably behind the european standards wow , really ? 
  greece blackmailed the eu to include cyprus in that enlargement . 
  so much for greek `` solidarity '' . 
  just like when greece blackmailed the eu in teh spanish & portuguese enlargement , that time for a loan . 
  mad has been reliant on second strike capability since the inception on submarine based delivery systems . 
  this missile shield would not upset this balance . 
  i 'm sorry sir , this store is fresh out of spending . 
  however , could i perhaps interest you in a referendum ? 
  are we going down this road again ? 
  the road were we pretend not to understand that these loans are to keep the greek state afloat regarding its financial commitments . 
  they might as well cross out the swedish ones , as they are n't particularly high speed . 
  if they push forward with more federalization i 'd wager that beyond the uk also scandinavian countries will exit the eu . 
  i would love to , we 'd have to change our government first though , since they ca n't cooperate with you or our other neighbours in a good manner . 
  there 'd need to be policy convergence in the sense that we adapt to the rest of you . 
  have fun !, 
  god i 'm happy we 're outside of that cluster fuck that is the ez . 
  in case of paywall ;  the euro might be worse for you than bankruptcy . 
   that , at least , has been the case for finland and the netherlands , which have actually grown less than iceland has since 2007 . 
  iceland , you might recall , basically went bankrupt in 2008 . 
   now , it 's true that finland and the netherlands have had their fair share of economic problems , but those should have been manageable . 
  neither country is a basket case , and both have done what they were supposed to do . 
  in other words , they 've followed the rules , and the results have still been a catastrophe . 
  that 's because the euro itself is . 
  or , if you want to be polite , the common currency is `` imperfect , and being imperfect is fragile , vulnerable , and does n't deliver all the benefits it could . '', 
  that was european central bank chief mario draghi 's verdict on thursday . 
   so what 's happened to them ? 
  well , just your run-of-the-mill bad economic news . 
  it 's only a slight exaggeration to say that apple has kneecapped finland 's economy . 
  its two biggest exports were nokia phones and paper products , but , as the country 's former prime minister alex stubb has said , the iphone killed the former and the ipad killed the latter . 
  now , the normal way to make up for this would be to cut costs by devaluing your currency , except that finland does n't have a currency to devalue anymore . 
  it has the euro . 
  so instead it 's had to cut costs by cutting wages , which not only takes longer , but also causes more economic damage since you have to fire people to convince them to take pay cuts . 
  the result has been a recession longer than anything in finland 's living memory , longer even than its great depression in the early 1990s . 
  it has n't helped , of course , that the rules of the euro zone have forced finland 's government to cut its budget at the same time that all this has been happening . 
   it 's been a different kind of story in the netherlands . 
  its goods are more than competitive abroad -- its trade surplus is an absurd 10 percent of economic output -- but its domestic spending is a problem . 
  the netherlands had a huge housing bubble , fueled , in part , by the fact that interest payments are fully tax deductible , that has since deflated some 20 percent . 
  that 's left dutch households with a bigger debt burden than anyone else in the euro zone . 
  on top of that , there 's been the usual austerity to keep its recovery from being much -- or any -- of one . 
  indeed , the netherlands ' economy was slightly smaller at the end of 2014 than it was at the end of 2007 . 
  that 's a lot better than finland , whose economy has shrunk 5.2 percent during that time , but , as you can see below , it still lags the 1.1 percent growth iceland has eked out . 
   now , it 's hard to do worse than iceland . 
  it basically turned its entire economy into a hedge fund that collapsed in 2008 . 
  its banks defaulted , its government had to be bailed out , and its currency collapsed 60 percent .
