  not only that , but , between 2009 and 2014 , iceland did nearly twice as much austerity as the netherlands and 12 times as much as finland . 
  and if that was n't enough , iceland 's economic jeremiad also includes high household debt and capital controls that have prevented people from moving money out of the country and dissuaded them from moving it in . 
   but despite all this , iceland has still managed to outperform finland and the netherlands . 
  how is that possible ? 
  well , it does n't have the euro . 
  it has its own currency , the krona . 
  and as much as it hurt iceland 's people to lose 60 percent of their purchasing power on imported goods when the krona fell that much , it helped iceland 's economy by making their goods more competitive overseas . 
  that was enough to keep what could have been a depression from turning into anything other than a bad recession . 
   the euro , though , does the opposite . 
  countries ca n't devalue their currencies or cut interest rates or even spend more when they get into trouble , and so they stay in trouble . 
  all they can do is cut wages , cut spending , and then cut wages some more as penance for whatever economic transgressions they may or may not have committed . 
  the euro straitjacket , in other words , turns ordinary problems into extraordinary ones ( finland ) and extraordinary problems into historic ones ( greece ) . 
  and that can happen whether or not you follow the rules . 
   the euro is a capricious god , meting out punishment to sinners and saints alike . 
  pair debt relief with a phased exit from the ez . 
  its the only logical solution by now as the greek gov. 
  has no trust among its peers , has no legitimacy to implement the austerity measures , and still would n't be able grow with in the ez . 
  yes it does . 
  as the your own report states the georgian war was preceded by both russian provocations , military build up and a russian policy to secure its influence in the region . 
  cute . 
  google scholar is there for you , knock yourself out . 
  also , the report spells out the russian agenda to reinforce its influence in the region following te election of putin , it lays bare the russian policy of passportization and illegal nature of the break away republics as well as the military build up . 
  it also touches on the land grab made with russian support . 
  no , go read the academic articles on the subject . 
  also , you really ought to read the stuff you link , as it does n't support your claim . 
  it is semantics , but this is due to semantics being central in public international law regarding war . 
  i do n't agree that this is a civil war , as there is a third party in control of the supposed rebels . 
  regular combatants are those who fight in an army , and who are bound by and protected the convections of war , as opposed to unlawful combatants , such as the russian supported terrorists . 
  a conventional war is war between ** states ** . 
  not as in the ukraine , where the government is clearing out terrorists . 
  france ai n't managing shit . 
  it ca n't even reform itself , hence it is tailing the krauts and has been since the mid 80s . 
  the result we see today with a hegemonic germany . 
  no , they 're not regular combatants . 
  they are not fighting a conventional war . 
  yes , one side has the moral right on its side , that being the ukrainian side . 
  the russians are the bad guys , returning to their old ways as one 'd expect . 
  `` bad stuff '' ; using advanced weapon systems used to shot down a civilian plane , hence killing hundreds , including women and children . 
  the russians are the warmongerers , as we see in georgia , moldova and now the ukraine . 
  these countries did nothing to deserve russia working to destroy them . 
  by declaring their own republic , terrorising and attacking both ukrainian officials and civilians and through aggressive warfare aiming to overthrow the state . 
  their forces also to an extent consist of ** foreign irregular combatants ** . 
  what more do you want ? 
  no , they are state sponsored terrorists created and used by russia to create a new frozen conflict , end of story . 
  i do n't want it to cool down . 
  there is no point in allowing another frozen conflict where russia can chip away at a country at will . 
  i understand your sentiment , but i beg do disagree about having to be better than them . 
  russians ( and their sponsored terrorists ) understand force alone , nothing else . 
  they 're not soldiers in a regular army , they have no just cause . 
  there is no recognized `` donetsk peoples republic '' . 
  these are just state sponsored terrorists funded by russia . 
  but that 's the thing , a buk is a complex weapons system that was operated by someone who knew what he did . 
  there was no mistake . 
  these `` rebels '' ought to be hunted down and just be summarily executed . 
   overegulation is not a problem for the greek economy . 
  that is quite the statement , especially since greece in index after index , such as wef places itself on the bottom among eu member-states . 
  thank you country men , you actually answered correctly , for once . 
  also , dear neighbours , this eu thing ai n't for us in the end . 
  he was an extremely a polarising figure . 
  he was voted out of office and lost several elections . 
  i know he 's popular in greece since he sheltered papandreou during the junta time . 
  i agree with that , he was another kind of socialist though . 
  one who cared for his country . 
  yes , and he as well was thoroughly incompetent . 
  is our incompetent government doing something right ? 
  this has to be a misprint , there is no way those socialists are doing something the proper way . 
  indeed , the fact that greece after five years of supposed reforms still ranks last in the eu speaks volumes of the quality of reforms carried out . 
  thank you for my favourite wines and cheeses . 
   what should the greeks do now ? 
  forget for a moment the economic debate of the last few months , over issues such as the impact of austerity or economic reforms on growth , and ask yourself this simple question : do you really think that an economic reform programme , for which a government has no political mandate , which has been explicitly rejected in a referendum , that has been forced through by sheer political blackmail , can conceivably work ? 
  oh i think the euro should be scrapped as well , and a radically downsized eu and i want control over the borders . 
  what i object to is the notion that the south has the right to a northern standard via subsidies , be it loans , transfers or eu funds , as the greeks seem to believe . 
  i simply do n't think it has the right to have its cake and eat it . 
  you reap what you sow . 
  the spanish people have voted for these corrupt people again and again . 
  just like greece , spain as well will have to modernize , which includes privatizations and changes to labor laws . 
  there never has been any alternative to austerity , it is time to realise this . 
  as for democracy , you ca n't vote to ahve others pay for your debt/welfare state / white elephants or whatnot . 
  i take it you 're a podemos voter ? 
  lol . 
  of course it is , most of these are the reforms that samaras did n't do or dragged his feet doing , hence failing to unlock the final bit of funds . 
  [ see here as an example ] ( http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/ecofin/128075.pdf ) . 
  most of this is stuff that was supposed to be done during the last five years . 
  greece is now trying to get a entire new bailout package for the same reforms that were needed to close the last one . 
  it is a reasonable demand to have these reforms be fast tracked . 
  its not like this is news . 
  [ this a great piece from vanity fair , written in 2010 ] ( http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2010/10/greeks-bearing-bonds-201010 ) . 
  example :  `` the ministry of agriculture had created an off-the-books unit employing 270 people to digitize the photographs of greek public lands , '' the finance minister tells me . 
  `` the trouble was that none of the 270 people had any experience with digital photography . 
  the actual professions of these people were , like , hairdressers . '', 
  so to recap these last two weeks : the greek government spend millions on a referendum they could n't afford , got capital controls in place and have wrecked the economy under the tourist season . 
  this all for ** nothing ** . 
  i guess the people are really proud of their `` oxi '' vote now , they really did stick it to the man !, 
  lol . 
  if that is supposed to resemble the average russian family they man and woman ought to be divorced , or the dad ought to be an alcoholic . 
  whose input has routinely been ignored throughout the process . 
  my guess it that they 'll try to ride along on the french goodwill , but in the end will present something that is unacceptable . 
  hence leaving french officials standing with egg on their face . 
  that brunette can arrest me any day . 
  yeah , ca n't see him winning hearts and minds of europe with this .
