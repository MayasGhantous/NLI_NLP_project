  your wish of a roosevelt also just amounts to wanting fiscal transfers from the rest of the eu . 
  again wanting more money , without strings attached . 
  greek politicians seemingly live in a parallel universe where one can label ones partners terrorists , undemocratic , dictatorial and whatever god damn crap that has come out of the mouths of syriza representatives this last week . 
  it sounds like something that random african dictator would come up with . 
  you think these people are going to be able to return to a negotiation table with the aforementioned people ? 
  syriza has ** zero ** political capital in europe . 
  as a side note its interesting to note that no one speaks of southern prolificacy anymore , the piigs are dead , rather its ** greek ** prolificacy , as the other countries are turning a corner . 
  greece is in a class of its own nowadays . 
  lastly , greece entered the eu in 1981 but is still unbelievably the second largest recipient of eu funds . 
  it is also greece , that yaps on about solidarity , that at every possible turn has ransomed the eu for its demands , such as with ** both ** the spanish and portuguese accession and the eastern enlargement , i.e. 
  whenever it has had the opportunity . 
  when has greece ever expressed solidarity towards the rest of the eu ? 
  its amazing that these clowns honestly think the lenders will sit down and negotiate , should there be a yes , with people who calls them terrorists . 
  so the rest of us should be forced to take all of these `` refugees '' , since poland `` do n't want to '' and at that we have to pay for poland as well , though eu-funds . 
  i 'd like a brexit of our own . 
  greece pays about 18 % of gdp annually for pensions . 
  this is about double that of the rest of the ez and eu , greece ca n't fund this at all . 
  it is that simple . 
  no really , markets have been fine over all . 
  the relevant have gone up today . 
  the greek gambit that markets would balk has failed completely . 
  the greek executive can neither spell not format a letter properly it seems . 
  god almighty . 
  besides that they still ca n't pose feasible alternatives to the troika . 
  which are caused by greek cartels in for example supermarkets , or closed professions that artificially creates high prices , or government subsidies like in teh case of pharmacies . 
  all greek problem that only be corrected by greek politicians , should they actually be capable of doing their jobs . 
  its rather a goldmine for business papers like http://www.di.se/ and http://www.affarsvarlden.se/, 
  this ought to be translated to greek and posted in their main dailys . 
  i always knew that the germans , and to a lesser extent brits , are the japanese of europe . 
  of course they do . 
  this that we 've seen the last few days means that podemos ca n't argue in favour of similar crap in spain , since it 'll get them nowhere . 
  russia is the only one that has threatened the use of nuclear weapons this far , against denmark of all targets . 
  it is also the county that has been vocal about renewing its nuclear stock . 
  the cuban missile crisis was not seen as a draw by anyone not knowing the details , and no one did until after the end of the cold war . 
  as far as people were concerned 1960-1990s the soviets got thir asses handed to them . 
  its impossible to view it as a draw . 
  i 've never defended the cluster-fuck that is the eu and nato in the mena area , and that is also a whole other topic . 
  regarding europe , the topic at hand , one 'd be hard pressed to view the eu / nato side as the one spreading propaganda . 
  i mean come one , just visit sputnik news or rt. 
  dat ass < 3, 
  yes they did . 
  to remove the missiles from turkey was beyond public view . 
  for all intents and purposes the soviets publicly `` lost '' the cuban missile crisis . 
  as for your second statement , this is just hypocracy . 
  you assume in your statement that russia has an inherent right in fucking up its neighbourhood , while crying that the us is excersising its rihts to pursue potential allies . 
  it boils down to that if russia has the right to exercise its interests beyond its borders so has the us and nato , and the eu . 
  these latter organisations and the us , have the ability to attract followers , hence they can pursue their interests . 
  which is fine . 
  russia has nothing but corruption and incompetence to offer , it is not an attractive choice , hence it has lost . 
  again it has to suck it up . 
  the soviets had to suck it up at that time , as weill the russians have to do so this time as well . 
  russia can not in any way , beyond nukes , challenge teh us in military might . 
  so how is operation iraqi freedom working out for your government ( s ) ? 
  i do n't think they 'd do that , as it would just feed into the syriza narrative of an undemocratic eu opressing greece . 
  this is the best thing that could have happened . 
  its now up to the greek electorate to choose their fate . 
  good move from tzipras . 
  i 've been pondering this for a while . 
  turks in / r/europe ; honestly , do n't you people need them generals to step in again soon and clear stuff up ? 
  i mean ataturk 's heritage is going down the drain . 
  greece retuned to growth , albeit low , during late 2014 under the samaras government . 
  then came syriza and fucked it all up , greece is in a recession again , and the minister tasked wih privatizations have scared away any poteential foreign investors . 
  i have to maintain that the imf is not the ones that primarily are responsible in this case . 
  i 'm sadly not as savvy as carl bildt is on twitter , 
  the imf is not responsible for the ineptitude of greek governments . 
  i mean are you saying that the imf should have factored in that greek politicians are incompetent and corrupt in their calculations ? 
  well then stop bitching about nato encouraging on your borders and rather suck it up . 
  since the us and nato has its particular interest in europe , which is fine . 
  yes , there you have an actual enemy . 
  one that wo n't cause sanctions , shooting down civilian airliners et.al . 
  occupy yourself with them instead of making enemies with europe . 
  how can the imf be responsible when successive greek governments have done practically nothing beyond fiscal measures ? 
  there is a reason to why teh lists we see in leaked are so extensive - greek governments have done jack-shit . 
  defaulting does n't make the debts magically go away . 
  a default is followed by a negotiation , a thing we know by now that greeks are bad at . 
  also , no , it wo n't affect italy and spain , their economies are sufficiently protected , and it will certainly not affect their recovery . 
  why woyld italy , the third largest economy in europe crumble ? 
  as for spain , they 're actually improving , which is what the markets care about . 
  and that would be what exactly ? 
  greece has no industries to speak of , and added to that by now simply no fdi at all . 
  if it does n't want to reform , how is the country going to continue with the program ? 
  do n't stand to close to people in general 2 . 
  do n't talk loudly 3 . 
  do n't push to interact with people whom you do n't know 4 . 
  respects the `` personal sphere '' 6 . 
  do n't go on about `` in * random county * we do stuff this/that way '' - no one cares . 
  do n't make a fuzz in public, 
   `` it 's the financial sector that has to pay , not the greek people . '', 
  just goes to show he has no idea what he 's talking about . 
  there already was the psi agreement in 2012 . 
  as i stated it aims to roll back the reforms of the previous government ; everything from privatizations to public sector lay ofs and collective bargaining . 
  of course greece has to implement the reforms that was agreed in the bailout agreements . 
  the discussions were conducted within the frame of those agreements . 
  its not a question about `` digging deeper '' , but rather that normal parts of agreements are viewed as exceptional . 
  the same recepie regarding reforms have been taken throughout the piigs . 
  it is only in greece that few successes may be seen due to dodgy implementation of reforms . 
  i mean there is a reason the current reivew of the program has been going on since last august - that the former greek goverment did not implement enough strucutral reforms , but rather focused on fiscal restraint . 
  fiscal adjustment and institutional reform are different matters . 
  greek governments has , as i 've stated , chosen to rely almost solely on reforms in regards to wages , taxes , in addition to the number of civil servant . 
  additionally , the article is two years old , and the progress that was accomplished under samaras goverment is being undermined by the current goernment .
