  nope , the bailout programmes contained a stubstancial amount of inistutional reforms . 
  greek governments however dragged their feet , due to vested interests , and rather choose to just focus on taxes and slashing of civil servants . 
   what greece now needs desperately is serious , proper reforms . 
  we need a new tax system that helps defeat evasion and curtail political or corporate interference , a corruption-free procurement system , business-friendly licensing procedures , judicial reforms , elimination of scandalous early retirement practices , proper regulation of the media and of political party finances , etc. 
  successive greek governments have had five years to do any of the above , yet have done nothing . 
  the same goes for this greek government . 
  it could have begun with reforms to build the political capital needed to demand leniency , but rather they did the opposite . 
  no , they said they 'd block every budget that would increase immigration . 
  i mean at least try to keep to the truth , its on tape from their press conference ffs . 
  all he did was to state that the jewish and sami have a separate identity from the general swedish identity . 
  of course they 'd need to assimilate to change their identity , what is odd whit this ? 
  its a country of 60-ish million and cry about taking on 50k `` refugees '' i.e. 
  economic migrants . 
  we along with france , britain the netherlands and germany hae dealt with this crap for years and taken in much , much more . 
  they should stop crying and deal with it . 
  alternatively , make them eastern countries take them , about time they do something for them eu-funds they gobble up , especially poland . 
  what does that have to do with anything ? 
  he has explained that stupid crap time and time again . 
  now answer my question , in what way is s\u00f6ders statement on jewish identity different to what the actual law says ? 
  while it does make sd the sole opposition party , the cartell itself is done via contract outside of the riksdag . 
  hence , it is there to put the rules of the game ; the make up of the riksdag out of play . 
  no you dolt , they made an extra-parliamentary cartell with the explicit aim of preserving their parties role in running the country . 
  how the fuck is this to `` used their democratically elected influence '' ? 
  do you think right wing voters voted for their reps. to throw in the towel for the next four years ? 
  are you fucking dumb ? 
  [ bj\u00f6rn s\u00f6der said exactly what the law about the national minorities says ; that these minorities have identities that separate from swedish identity . 
  he was in no way wrong . ], 
  i disagree with most of the stuff he says . 
  his core arguments i.e. 
  that this is a european issue simply is n't true . 
  its a greek issue that is the responsibility of greeks to work towards solving . 
  i have seen that before , i 've seen the brookings talk and most others . 
  it is always the same thing - he tries his best to externalise greek problems to a european context . 
  he ** always ** lays the blame on germany , obscure international banks , the ez , the `` european political class '' , `` history '' or whatever that jumps out of his mouth . 
  he is a good speaker , but nothing more than that . 
  what he never does mention is the facts that greek citizens sought rent from thir elected politicians who in turn from the 1980s onwards delivered rent to their clients until the bitter end . 
  who cares about dijsselbloem ? 
  to his merit though ; at least he can keep his country afloat . 
  this rather than yanis who spends his days getting his ass kicked in exharchia , or doing reportages at his fancy villa . 
  this of course when not being busy insulting/lecturing euro-group colleagues . 
  you 're missing the point . 
  the greek above was making the point about how a certain state was insignificant . 
  my sole point is that in comparison to turkey it is greece that is insignificant . 
  no , its simply to contextualise this fan image that is spread , via pictures such sa the one linked . 
  he is merely an obscure economic who has been part in trashing the small recovery greece was making during 2014 . 
  he has presented few feasible solutions beyond some fantasies of debt forgiveness and mass-investment in greece i.e. 
  stuff that will ** never ** happen . 
  go on then boy , go read http://www.amna.gr// and come back with a different answer regarding whom that is deciding the greek stance . 
  that 's a load of shit . 
  how is that germane to the rest of the ez giving in to greek pressures regarding teh bailouts ? 
  one might say similarly , why should nato intervene to not let greece get re-absorbed into turkey ? 
  it 'd be such as hassle for nothing . 
  no he 's not . 
  tsipras is , which is n't much of an improvement . 
  its not the radical nature of teh ideas , rather that beyond theory they are completely useless . 
  just type him into google scholar , you 'll get a very low number of citations . 
  this means one thing ; he is not reputable . 
  but debt restructuring is completely of the table , as is some kind modern `` mashall aid '' for greece and such , it simply wo n't happen . 
  you ca n't base a discussion on wishes and make belief . 
  varoufaki is n't even well cited , he 's a fringe economic at best . 
  as of yet syriza has done nothing that other governments have not , and they have no incentive to as the greek unions are currently warming up to go on strikes again . 
  there is a clear reason as to why tax collection dropped when syriza won - people thought they 'd be able to get back to the way stuff used to be , even though this is clearly not the case . 
  no you have not answered it . 
  you 've made balant statements that we would win on a transfer union without any sort of proof . 
  what would we in the north win in throwing good money at the black hole that is greece ? 
  so what ? 
  he ca n't find himself a chair or has he pawned it ? 
  he 's a fringe economist and is at that barely cited at all . 
  he 's also such a joke that he even got sacked from the greek negotiation-team , that alone should tell you volumes . 
  its not like the current russian duma can do jack shit about it anyway . 
  russia is the legal successor to the ussr , and if it does stuff like this one may call into question other acts that are still in force today . 
  but then again no-one expected logic from present day russia . 
  so where is the commission on the adverse competition situation this will cause ? 
  this deal 'd give this particular company a extremely large market share . 
  no , he has suggested debt relif and at that investment schemes for greece , this is completely unfeasable outside greece . 
  politicians in other ez member-states ca n't argue in favour of the stuff that amateur suggests without their own parties going down in flames in the next elections , especially in portugal , spain and ireland . 
  it could possibly have been forced to adjust its standard of living via a bankruptcy , but beyond that the immediate and middle range effects would have had massive effect on society . 
  i ca n't disagree about financial insitutions , `` too big too fail '' is a massive problem , as is catering to major member-states financial institutions . 
  as for syriza , it is as in bed with special interests , such as unions , as the old parties where . 
  it also lacks the institutional clout in terms of knowledge to get reforms going . 
  especially after having thrown out the eu task forces . 
  its not that simple . 
  transfers within the frame of the eu , via cap regional funds and such have always been a part of the cooperation , and even these are contested . 
  now image a pure transfer union - it ai n't gon na work , since it would be perceived as illegitimate . 
  also , what would we win in giving money to incompetent administrations ? 
  the eu is not like the us in any way . 
  such comparisons do n't add anything . 
  iceland managed itself fine , and ireland performs well due to having completed its program . 
  additionally , north and south in this context also includes states such as austria , the netherlands , belgium , et.al . 
  these wo n't accept a transfer union , neither will countries such as slovakia and the czech republic . 
  i agree that it should have been restructured in teh first place , though this will never happen so it ca n't be used as a base for discussion . 
  of course , it ca n't just walk away from all of its debt owned by other ez countries . 
  it 'd create a massive moral hazard . 
  this is where you 're wrong , had it not gotten a bailout the crisis would have been much worse , due to the country being unable to finance any commitment at all . 
  greece is also in its current position due to successive governments not being able to tackle entrenched interests , hence limiting the available policy tools . 
  portugal is on its way to recovery , the same goes for spain to a certain extent . 
  of course it was going to be along fall for spain , due to its economy being built on air . 
  these countries have also always had high seasonal and structural unemployment . 
  within the eu as a framework i can tell you that this 'd never fly in the north . 
  we do n't want to pay for southern spending .
