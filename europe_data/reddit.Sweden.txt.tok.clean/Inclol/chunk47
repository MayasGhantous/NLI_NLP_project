  though we do have even worse ; somalians , syrians , bosnians , and `` christian '' iraqis . 
  its all the same though , people from the mena area , bar iranians , - absolutely worthless leaches . 
  i wish they all would go back hungary , bulgaria and romania . 
  imported hate is a central aspect of progressive societies . 
  of course livland should be a part of us . 
  not its not . 
  its an exception in its size and the scope of trade coming through it . 
  this is the sole reason the chinese have such an interest in ; it serves as a gateway for their goods . 
  you ca n't seriously believe that random regional greek port or airport has a similar significance . 
  the pireues port is vastly different from everything else on sale . 
  it ca n't be used as a benchmark for future sales of regional ports and airports . 
  as if they 'd get buyers who has the potential to develop the properties - not a chance . 
  especially as the current minister in charge of privatization is to the left of lenin . 
  [ which has no correlation with migration ] ( http://www.tino.us/2015/04/tillvaxt-och-produktivitet-i-oecd-2006-2014/ ) . 
  yeah , because hordes of people with an `` education '' from a madrassa , alternatively a terrible school system in a mena autocracy would be so hot in eu labour markets in general . 
  this article is nothing but pc crap . 
  furthermore , the social impact is bad enough as it is across europe , such as the segregation in britain or anti-semitism in france and sweden . 
  to think that more immigration would be positive is such a laugh . 
  also , how the does he think the social welfare systems would cope ? 
  they 'd collapse one after another . 
  did n't the ecj strike down this crap ? 
  yeah , that is odd , those as you say tend to be quite civilized . 
  i suppose they attract a differnt type of spanish redditor . 
  this is almost like a balkan thread . 
  will read again . 
  in the end this commission will probably be worse than the santer commission . 
  i hope they win , it 'll have significant impact on overall educational quality in the long run . 
  which is needed , as some of the smaller places , such as the one being sued , are basically rackets . 
  alright , so how would the command structure look like ? ... 
  some people deserve it . 
  its kinda simple ; if you are an entitled anarchist in a western country ( often someone who ravels all over the eu to participate in stuff like this ) , who goes about buring and looting just because , then you deserve a taste of police brutality . 
  however if you are an ordinary citizen who gets pulled over in a traffic stop due to a faulty light you do n't deserve that treatment . 
  yeah , this is one of those times . 
  guaranteed these `` revolutionaries '' still live at home with their parents , even while being grown men . 
  i hope the police caught and beat the shit out of at least a few of them . 
  the survey , avaliable [ here ] ( http://www.ipsos.se/sites/default/files/pdf/dn_ipsos%20attityder%20till%20integration%20och%20invandring%20i%20sverige%20och%20norge%20150312.pdf ) , clearly states that a larger percentage wants ** less ** immigration than tose who wants more . 
  also , this narrative that our country is a country of immigration is a load of shit . 
  that lil survey chief should read some literature on the make up of european nation states , such as the writings of [ tilly ] ( http://eu.wiley.com/wileycda/wileytitle/productcd-1557863687.html ) . 
  sweden along with ireland were to most homogeneous countries in europe until the early 1990s . 
  no , its not how international law works . 
  you simply do n't get to occupy and add parts of other countries to your own . 
  end of story . 
  spending time at work does not equal productivity . 
  that is all , as we can clearly see . 
   dining in exarxhia found the problem . 
  why the fuck would he go there ? 
  lets say these women are about 25 y/o as a median age ( just a guess ) , they 've grown up knowing putin , with a brief period of medvedev , as the leader . 
  they also grown up in a media landscape that 's bombarded them with anti-western propaganda . 
  add to this putin 's approval rating and i say its pretty likely . 
  that 's all fine and dandy . 
  i 'm sure there are nice and good looking women all over russia . 
  this however is not germane to their god damn government annexing and destabilizing sovereign countries . 
  also , if you look at the numbers a majority of those hot chicks probably support putin . 
  this is to say that nice looking girl actually supports him sending nuclear bombers patrolling . 
   in a camp near dresden , a barrel of beer was emptied by the british to celebrate the conclusion of the african campaign . 
  lol , now that 's high level trolling . 
  in that case knock yourselves out :d, 
  they do , but they overcharge . 
  no , only badly fried falafel . 
  no , only uneducated farmers from anatolia . 
  the only real threat he can deliver on is sending more turks as guest workers to germany . 
  you 've incredibly enough managed to outdo yourself in dumbness . 
  denmark being on the doorstep of nazi-germany surely did n't have anything to do with it right ? 
  i would suspect they do it underground . 
  like the [ `` mole people '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_mole_people_%28film%29 ) . 
  i 've always suspected this . 
  its not vague , if you ca n't even bother reading the large amount of reports about red tape ** in general ** being a problem in greece , then you 're beyond my help . 
  like what ? 
  beyond greek authorities not implementing oecd recommendations the factors behind enterprise greece not functioning is still red tape , and with this new government regulatory uncertainty as well . 
  so what is it i have missed during these five years ? 
  what are these major reforms that have been transformed into greek law , that then have been implemented ? 
  i mean they 've yet to even effectivize tax collection , go after tax evaders , amend the law about the shipping magnates , digitalize the land registry , come up with a reasonable plan for energy prices for businesses , do anything about cronyism and corruption in general , the education system being a cluster fuck , the shear amount of 55 + y/o people being retired et.al . 
  yet you seem to claim that major reforms have been made . 
  god almighty . 
  it would seem to be the case . 
  its odd that he 's failed to review the entirety of literature that is available on the subject . 
  our politicians have just that attitude !, 
  and as i 'm sure you are aware , just like in germany , this works without a hitch . 
  its really odd in my view that the primary spreader of freedom ( tm ) in the world ai n't picking up these exceptional and great people . 
  it would be such an asset to teh us . 
  thousands of rocket surgeons who 'll adapt nicely to local society . 
  you are indeed right . 
  but you also know that i mean tangible reforms except for those . 
  such as deregulation of professions , slashing red tape , fast tracks regarding investment in particular , et.al . 
  what they want is besides the point . 
  how about a country like poland , that lives of eu aid like no other member-state actually taking on some of this ? 
  rather than the germans . 
  he writes this , yet his government kicked put the task-forces who 've tried to help greece with institutional reform . 
  also , * `` by contrast , our government believes that this program has failed , leaving the population weary of reform . 
  '' * what fucking reforms ? 
  beyond slashing wages and the number of employees in the public sector what substantial reforms have been made in greece since the onset of the crisis ? 
  but you were to be greeted as liberators , and the war was supposed to be swift . 
  i distinctly remember that streets would be named after dubya . 
  seems that mr game theory has spent too much time looking at theory rather than empiric regarding member-state actions within the eu analysed through rational choice . 
  i.e member-states do not act as rational actors within the eu . 
  national considerations still take precedence , hence he can kiss his `` game theory '' good bye . 
  the amount of turkish butthurt over this is amusing . 
  luckily they have their sultan to speak for them , 
  the only rational conclusion is taht eu ms needs to invest in nuclear energy to a much greater extent . 
  that you as a muslim ca n't keep your culture , since its the opposite of the essance of what is modern europe .
