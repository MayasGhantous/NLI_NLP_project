  just look at what its done to the italian economy as an example , that is is a triple dip recession - this is the fault of teh euro , and italy wo n't get out of its slump within the euro , there is no way for that to happen, 
  do enlighten me . 
  edit : did n't notice , you 're that crackpot who 're basically parroting everything that comes out of tovima , lol . 
  as you write yourself , the us is one country ; shared history , language , values et.al.this aint the case in eruope , we can barely stand each other in many cases . 
  why should they recognise that ? 
  why should finland , a country of about 5 millions , hand over their hard earned ( painful reform in the early 90s ) funds to as a example spain ? 
  - a much larger country , that is run by people & parties as corrupt as afghan warlords . 
  you have to realise how absurd this would be perceived . 
  in my view this is a thing that would kill of the eu . 
  if you were to say in this country ( sweden ) , that ; `` hey , in addition to paying about 50 % taxes you 'll also be paying for italian healthcare '' we 'd be outside the eu in a flash , people will never accept such a thing . 
  i do n't agree honestly , since i want my tax money to be invested in my own country . 
  i want my government to invest in trains running outside uppsala , not outside madrid . 
  as for private companies investing in the south , that is something only southern governments can facilitate . 
  the free movement of goods is a core of the eu though , rather than being a part of teh euro . 
  i rather believe that the euro needs to be scrapped , to restore a economic dynamic reflecting reality within the eu, 
  ofc it has , since greece is a basket case within the ez . 
  its economic make up with a huge part self-employed and a substantial part small inefficient businesses in the service sector calls for drastic measures for the country to survive within teh ez , which it ca n't anyway . 
  no , thats the core of the eu - the completion of the inner market . 
  honestly , if that is a problem these countries should n't be in the eu at all . 
  the free flow of gods , capital and labour is the core of the eu since the maastricht treaty . 
  ca n't accept this ? 
  well then the eu aint for them . 
  yes , they do get to pay for the mistakes of the governments they themselves have elect . 
  and yes , not should not get a second chance . 
  they 've been given funds for every conceivable part of their economies for as long as they 've been in the eu , but the governments are simply to inept to do stuff the way it is suppose to be done . 
  in what way would a better europe emerge if as an example corrupt spanish authorities were given money ? 
  they would n't change their behaviour , which is needed . 
  so what if the north has export driven economies ? 
  this does n't validate these dumb claims akin to a transfer union . 
  the german economy benefits from the reputation of its products . 
  its a strong economy irregardless of the euro due to a host of issues beyond this as well , such as institutional stability , low corruption et.al . 
  - factors simply absent in the south . 
  so what do you think would have happened if greek banks were allowed to tank ? 
  you think the saving of the greeks would ahve been fine . 
  its such fucking nonsense to say that the bailouts were for the banks . 
  if the greek state had been left to dry up , lacking the funds it needed for its daily running , you think it would have been better of ? 
  a bailout does n't mean that someone throws money at people at random - it is to prop up a state that is in rapid decline . 
  what is it you people believe should have been done ? 
  should each greek have been given a deposit or something ? 
  that is not the issue , rather the harsh truth is that a northen standard of living and welfare state is out of teh question for a substantial part of the south . 
  this needs to be faced . 
  though sure , unemployment will rise in the north as a result due to a loss of export opportunities , thats a given . 
  ofc it would be the same principle , though i doubt that will happen . 
  it simply has no legitimacy at all . 
  any politician up here who 'd allow something like that would be committing political suicide for himself and his party . 
  poorer regions of eruope have no legal claim to our money , and besides they 've squandered regional and structural funds for decades , with little success , adding more money to that black hole is a waste . 
  instead they should reconfigure their welfare states to be in line with their funding capabilities - this is the elephant in the room . 
  yeah , we have re-distribution within our own country from rich administrative areas to poorer ones , often ear-market to healthcare et.al . 
  greece however is not a part of our country , hence it ai n't entitled to any money at all . 
   it is a common belief that the greek government is seeking special treatment relative to other stressed eurozone members . 
  we are not ; we are seeking equal treatment . 
  they are getting the same treatment as the other bailed out countries , only consecutive greek governments have demonstrated near unheard of incompetence . 
  they are asking for special treatment . 
  this new finance minister is basically asking to be given other countries surpluses . 
  it is incomprehensible that greek politicians still to this day believe that they are entitled to the fruits of other ez countries fiscal management and economic models . 
  since the onset of the crisis they 've ran this dumb narrative for teh domestic audience as well as for themselves , as a `` social europe '' or some similar bullshit . 
  to actually believe that there is a support among northern tax payers for basically being taxed in favour the south , seemingly just `` because '' , is just astonishing . 
  while the shitty currency that is the euro should be scrapped tomorrow , and german management of the crisis is a joke at best these delusions of what amounts to a transfer union has to stop . 
  it wo n't happen . 
  we ai n't usin that map though . 
  croatia is the key to regional hegemny in the jugo-sphere - teh eu already got this covered . 
  uneducated labour and access to a poor market does not match the money sink that it will be . 
  i 'm well aware of the acquis process . 
  my ppoint is that bosnia is such a inherently dysfunctional state that a membership would be akin to a can of worms for the eu . 
  since the country ca n't even speak with a unified voice . 
  god almighty . 
  cheers for the info though , i should have checked . 
  wtf ? 
  way would the eu want such a dysfunctional state ? 
  it has three separate constitutions , a presidency that rotates based on ethnicity , a part of the country ( republica serbska ) wants to break away , this among other massive issues . 
  why not clear albania if we 're having some kinda clearing bonanza for fucked up states . 
  yes , they should be executed , it is as simple . 
  a bullet in the head . 
  you do n't get to commit ethnic cleansing and preform slave trade and just walk away from it . 
  they are ** war criminals ** , not victims in any sense of the word . 
  no no , they 've had a hand in creating their islamic paradise . 
  now they should be forced to stay . 
  i admit it , we 're the ones controlling the jews ( tm ) . 
  its kinda like inception . 
  this ai n't necessary , just wait for the germans to negotiate with putin . 
  give `` peace '' a chance . . / s, 
  political correctness , it is a plague . 
  i despise swedish hipsters in general and particulary politically active ones . 
  i hate how my fellow countrymen are often a bunch of whiny , naive relativists that go as far as to relativise isis , the charlie hebo shootings et.al . 
  i also hate the tendency of politicians and media to adopt stupid tumblr crap . 
  the whole of exarchia is teaming with psudo-revolutionaries who lives at home with their moms , when they are not throwing stones at the police . 
  when the shit hits the fan , i think blame will go around up-down as well as left-right . 
  while the corrupt elite is responsible for the current situation , there is an unfortunate societal acceptance for corruption and a tendency to seek an external `` other '' to blame for the current crisis . 
  they should leave the euro as it is unsustainable for the country to build a functioning economy within the ez . 
  predictably the germans said no , and the greeks have no legal basis for their claims , and no venue to take them to . 
  this is pre-emptive posturing meant for a domestic audience , probably to take focus from further concessions regarding the bailout programme . 
  how the hell the eu get to this point ? 
  - germany more or less dictates eu-policy , which , as always , ends up being a complete cluster-fuck . 
  going down the drain fast . 
  that 's difficult to do within the current teu , even with the developemnts within the former `` pillar ii '' . 
  also , establisning a clear command strcuture within teh current eu would be a laugh . 
  agreed , europe desperately needs a real british conservative and a french gaullist taking charge . 
  are you stalking me lel ? 
  yes , i am a right wing populist who wants to slash immigration , and who thinks that immigration adds ** nothing ** to our country but costs . 
  how this is germane to a discussion on greek public discourse i have no idea .
