   as to youth unemployment , it 's high all over the west . 
  why do you assume sweden would be different ? 
  because the youth unemployment has gone up . 
  this is a problem overall and not just sweden . 
   alas , the link from svt is only available in sweden . 
  but so far all you have is vague linkages between the topic , you have n't provided any hard causation . 
  use a proxy or something , i looked for other links but there are none . 
  [ here 's the sweddit thread . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/sweden/comments/27yhci/den_osvenska_modellen/ ) [ here 's a 2 year old article ] ( http://www.gp.se/nyheter/debatt/friaord/1.895499-rea-pa-arbetskraft-ger-inte-fler-jobb ) but that 's the best i can do . 
   i think that the fact that there isn \u00b4 t a debate is because there isn \u00b4 t an alternative in the left ... left is so broken as his the right capitalism , and it can \u00b4 t present a credible alternative there are economic problems which i presented in [ these ] ( http://www.svt.se/nyheter/almega-varslar-om-lockout ) [ three ] ( http://www.dn.se/ledare/signerat/manniska-eller-maskin/ ) [ articles ] ( http://www.svtplay.se/video/2097001/den-osvenska-modellen ) ( although in swedish ) . 
  there should be some incentive to speaking about these issues but there is not . 
   well ... first of all is racist , so ... huh ? 
   as to wage dumps , i 've seen no evidence of that [ just like the biggest thing happening in sweden currently . 
  ] ( http://www.svt.se/nyheter/almega-varslar-om-lockout )  and not by immigration it does n't take a genius to comprehend that the competition is tougher , and therefore lower wages if 2 wants the job . 
  as an example , the swedish youth with bad grades got low wage jobs where they are treated like products for instance . 
  [ these are immigrants getting massively reduced wages and are abused by companies . 
  ] ( http://www.dn.se/ledare/signerat/manniska-eller-maskin/ ) [ here is another , more concrete article if you want to know more about the `` unswedish model '' . 
  ] ( http://www.svtplay.se/video/2097001/den-osvenska-modellen ), 
   i think the guy presented in an eloquent way the stupidity of the people who voted in extreme right wing parties in europe ... of course they are stupid , but it 's the only way they can have their voice heard . 
  in sweden the biggest party has to back down over moral , feminist pk media who instantly calls anyone who disagrees with the current immigration policies , racists . 
  meanwhile they provide no support for that immigration is an economic benefit , but instead , show bogus numbers to make it seem like we profit , while in reality , it 's a big loss . 
  it 's always so easy to go with the racist card instead of actually debating . 
  swedish left are proud for not taking the debate . 
  so the housing shortage , wage dumps etc are all normal for a healthy society ? 
  we see a rapid increase in labour which is problematic . 
  wages in bulgaria and sweden are not similar . 
  if a bulgarian truck driver take over the job of the swedish truck driver the swedish truck driver suddenly has no income or has to compete with the wages the bulgarian truck driver gets , which is around half . 
  there is no way to make a living with such a salary . 
  all radical solutions are bad , we should make this process slow so these type of wage gaps can not happen . 
  i 'm all for eu if they become competent in economics , but as of now , it 's not very promising . 
  does he somewhere prove that communism would do equally or greater amount of economic growth ? 
  where are your sources of this claim ? 
   he mentioned it insofar that immigrants were being used as a scapegoat by right wing parties and the ruling class in order to shift attention away from the actual economic issues . 
  which economic issues are n't immigration a part of ? 
  please , go ahead and make your case . 
  what have these reputable economists to say about the matter ? 
   `` killing immigrants and getting out of eu will solve our problems '' exactly . 
  that 's pretty much a reference to nazism . 
  like europe is against all non-white non-christians which obviously is n't true . 
  what did he say then ? 
  he never came with any economic arguments for immigration . 
  [ here 's a source . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/capitalism#economic_growth ), 
   syriza and podemos make major gains , thus opening up the possibility for a major anti-capitalist movement in europe , especially if they translate these gains into national elections . 
  you know that regulated capitalism is good for the society right ? 
  anti-capitalism movements would stagnate a lot of economic growth . 
  a left winged professor says that europe is xenophobic because of right wing . 
  does he really believe the reason why people vote for right winged parties is because they suddenly become nazis ? 
  come on / u/cyridius , you can do better . 
  so tell me , what do you like to do ? 
  experience arts and culture , sunbathe , go out drinking , hiking ... ? 
  it would be so much easier to help you if you tell us what you like . 
   so i guess what we want to know is if anyone has advice on a cheap trip by bus , train , or plane to a city in europe or the surrounding area . 
  as far as cities go you could try capitals . 
  rome is beautiful and so is prague , but it depends on what you like to do . 
  if you like to experience art and culture rome is the choice , but if you like to hit the pubs prague is a better alternative . 
  if you want cities a bit closer i would recommend berlin or amsterdam . 
  if you like to experience nature i suggest sweden/norway . 
  in the summertime sweden is incredibly beautiful . 
  because i 'm swedish , i 'm going to convince you to go to sweden . 
  sorry , it 's on us . 
  we should n't have let oslo handle the peace prize in the first place . 
   our ( ultra ) feminists and the media climate ( aftonbladet , p3 for example ) , basically . 
  heavy left , moralist media climate . 
  it 's difficult to come with facts when they counter with `` but is it moral ? '', 
  about for instance not raising gas taxes . 
  you write like a supremacist . 
   if anything , immigrants need to understand that immigration is a privilege and they can either choose to assimilate or continue life in their less developed countries . 
  why do you think people are annoyed only about mena countries and not most asian , australia , north or south american countries ? 
  have you ever heard people complain about chinese immigrants for instance ? 
   if you were not a discriminating racist you would call them criminals and not gypsies . 
  the article says they 're gypsy gangs . 
  it was n't my opinion but the article 's words of choice . 
   as far as i know it 's the duty of the police to deal with criminals ( and that 's what prisons are for ) and not my duty to explain the difference to you . 
  that does n't mean you should open up your borders for criminals because everything should belong to everyone . 
  part of building a society is shielding it versus those who wish to harm it . 
  why do you think borders exist in the first place ? 
   there is nothing wrong with becoming a federal state . 
  there will be huge implications if that happens in the wrong way . 
   currently your anti-eu crowd is driven by anti-immigration sentiments and the `` fear of losing your jobs '' . 
  it 's mostly driven by corruption , bad policies and ignoring the people . 
   having a free movement of people policy the way the eu does means that companies in the uk can have access to unlimited qualified immigrant work-force , there . 
  [ it also means gypsy gangs can settle and go on a pickpocket spree . 
  ] ( http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/news/upsurge-in-thefts-as-pickpocket-gangs-settle-in-for-tourist-season-30354935.html )  also as a result of this , your wages are stagnating . 
  well duh , no shit people are against this . 
   because of the two points above , as companies balance the cost of investing and operating there as opposed to the cost of relocating tens of thousands of jobs elsewhere , as soon as the balance tips in the other direction you will `` lose your jobs '' regardless . 
  this is n't good for the market . 
  this certainly is n't good for countries like sweden . 
   and there is nothing your racist political parties can do about it . 
  ahh now i get it . 
   who are you , to live a comfortable life while people in the philippines for example live and struggle with poverty beyond your comprehension , on a daily basis . 
  you should try to help them instead of punishing other people . 
  you 're the type of people who makes the world a worse place . 
  you can not see anything from any other perspective than your own . 
  [ here are some ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stockholm_bloodbath ) [ wikipedia sources . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christian_ii_of_denmark ) spoiler : sweden got pissed off . 
  what was the inaccurate info ? 
   if not , sweden , also for obvious reasons . 
  what ? 
  is it because we invaded the british isles during the viking era ?
