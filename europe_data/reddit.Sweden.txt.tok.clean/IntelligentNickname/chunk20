  i guess the india trade companies did n't exist either . 
  you actually believe people would 've gone `` slaves ? 
  nah we do n't need labour '' back then ? 
   or the thousands upon thousands of other industries . 
  or banks . 
  nope , no capitalism . 
  banks use capitalism , and so do businesses . 
  what 's your point ? 
   you know , i 'm not surprised you hold these opinions , because there are a lot of blatantly ignorant people in the world who clearly have no idea , but what 's surprised me is that you 've gotten upvoted while i 've gotten downvoted . 
  because you obviously can not comprehend what i 'm trying to teach you . 
  why are you even surprised that people does n't hold your worldview of the good communism which will save us all from the evil capitalism which will destroy us ? 
   and where 's his evidence for it ? 
  power will be the new commodity . 
  something that i 've brought up numerous times . 
   the absence of capitalism does not lead to authoritarianism at all , but of course a capitalist would say that . 
  the odds are it will . 
  perhaps not in the future but with out current politics it will . 
  pick up a history book sometime . 
  capitalism was n't invented yesterday . 
  joint-stock trading was invented . 
  some merchants had the concept since before but it was at a smaller scale and frankly , without them we would n't start trading eachother . 
  so in reality those are the ones you need to thank for having everything you have today . 
   moderation fallacy . 
  just because i 'm arguing for one side does not mean i am not correct . 
  you however assume you are . 
  the thing is you believe everyone in the world is wrong except for one guy named marx . 
  you do n't even seem to have any economic degrees either . 
   jesus christ , look past the fucking name . 
  the communist party in china is not socialist in nature at all . 
  a cursory look at them tells you they employ state capitalism with very , very large amounts of private ownership . 
  so usa are communists aswell ? 
  it 's gon na be difficult for you to get that one through . 
  china and russia are communist states , and that 's no discussion . 
  china and russia is the result of communism . 
   trying to separate capitalism from politics is the biggest joke in existence . 
  same with communism and politics . 
  how are you going to defend that ? 
   they 're absolutely nothing of socialism . 
  socialism requires worker control . 
  just because a state regulates capital does not mean it is socialist or that it is not in any way capitalist . 
  so you 're claiming every country in the world are purely capitalist ? 
   everyone gets what they need . 
  so if i need a two summer houses and one mansion , do i get them ? 
   that 's something called state capitalism . 
  [ woooooooosh . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/state_capitalism#use_by_socialists ) a tl ; dr on that one is that marxists , anarchists and leninists use `` state capitalism '' . 
   instead of being a condescending ass and replying to everything with `` hurr durr look it up lel '' you should probably know what you 're discussing . 
  just because it has a certain name does n't make it less valid . 
  perhaps ** you ** should look up the meaning of the words before assuming it refers to only capitalism . 
  in reality it 's used as `` anti-capitalism '' . 
   throwing the same wiki page at me over and over again is n't an argument . 
  saying `` capitalism = freedom '' is n't an argument . 
  in fact , many socialists would argue they 're dramatically increasing freedom by ending corporate slavery and bring the democratic control down to the bottom as opposed to keeping it at the top . 
  holy shit just read the 3 sentences which i linked `` the american economist milton friedman argued that under socialism , the absence of a free market economy would inevitably lead to an authoritarian political regime . '' . 
  it 's a biased statement but that does n't make it less valid . 
   that 's not their production value . 
  that does n't matter . 
  even if everyone gets paid what their work is worth , the society is still going to be divided in classes . 
  one of the things the video does n't tell you is that lawmaking and capitalism does n't go hand in hand . 
  saying `` well they pay no taxes '' etc etc is because laws in the us has made it as such . 
  another thing about capitalism is that people invest their money . 
  if they have 100 million they say `` hmm ... 
  i wonder if this is profitable '' and they go invest in a business , and try to make it as much as possible . 
  tons of people get work , tons of material is required . 
  if none would invest the economic growth would be ** terrible ** . 
   oh no , you ca n't own shares , so evil and authoritarian !, 
  you do n't know what stocks are do you ? 
  perhaps you should just try to read up on basics of economics . 
   people argue that the sky is a carpet made by god . 
  power is a function of currency . 
  it is n't . 
  even if we had a democratic system but no economic system people would trade power as a commodity . 
   no it is n't , and i did n't say it was at fault for everything , just the vast majority of the big things . 
  lol . 
   such as colonialism ( and colonial genocide ) , rapid expansion of slavery , most wars , increasing inequality , most crime , and just a whole load of other things . 
  so you 're saying colonialism , something that happend centuries before the birth of capitalism , is somehow the fault of capitalism ? 
  so you 're saying russia and china , two entirely communistic states , do n't war ? 
   what do you care for ? 
  because you 're arguing incredibly hard for capitalism as someone who `` does n't care for capitalism '' . 
  you 're an ignorant person who do n't understand anything about capitalism but somehow criticize it and say `` communism is the al-mighty savior '' like russian proletarians during the revolution . 
  you view everything black and white and that 's what 's really dangerous . 
   oh , sorry , by that definition nothing on the planet is capitalism . 
  china has been ruled by a communist party . 
  saying it 's capitalistic is just beyond being stupid . 
   but seeing as the current version of state monitored capitalism is virtually the only form that has ever existed , ever , on the face of this planet , then yes , russia and china are both absolutely capitalist states . 
  not even . 
  please read up on the differences between capitalism and politics . 
   no it does n't . 
  ok fine , `` true communism '' does n't have pay , but they do share resources inequally . 
  it 's the same thing really . 
   how precisely do you plan on mixing two fundamentally and diametrically opposed ideologies ? 
  how do you mix capitalism with the thing created specifically to destroy it ? 
  both have their setbacks . 
  look at the current nations , they 're all shades of grey , not one or the other . 
   socialism is created under one condition ; worker control of the means of production . 
  this is fundamentally the opposite to capitalism . 
  to a degree , but did you know states can own businesses ? 
  you should try to read up on that . 
  it 's perhaps an entirely new concept for you . 
   limiting the freedom of corporations .
