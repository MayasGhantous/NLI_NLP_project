  i like that you called me a fascist because you just could n't come up with anything wiser . 
  of course you 're radical left , i noticed that right from the start . 
  wake up , the world is n't black and white and it 's you who plant the seeds for nazi scum to flourish . 
  by the way i did n't say ** you ** are a nazi , i said you bring up the nazism in people . 
  as a sidenote i just want to point out that any radical belief is the worst type of belief . 
  read books , study history , go to the univeristy , help contribute to society because all you do now is bring it down . 
  the difference between europe and usa is that europe has a welfare system which usa does n't . 
  in usa it 's more like everyone are on their own while in europe everyone work together . 
   it 's called realism . 
  closing a frontier will only stop law-abiding immigrants . 
  in what world ? 
  everyone will take the legal way but everyone will still get in . 
  automatic citizenship is one of the worst things a country can make and hence why none has such a system . 
  the country with the biggest immigration is usa and it has tremedeous segregation and terrible wealth distribution . 
  can you point out a country which has flourished because of forced immigration ? 
  and usa is even a bad example because it does n't include welfare like the european countries . 
   the criminals are here already , that 's something the right does n't want to understand . 
  and there are more who want to come . 
  there is n't a limitation of criminals . 
   i stop reading here . 
  read the whole thing or you wo n't learn anything . 
   you choose whether that 'd be legal or illegal so basically their will is law ? 
  you need to have restrictions and help them in their own countries . 
  integration is best if done slowly , it 's something that will happen during a long period of time not a few years . 
  forcing people to integrate is the worst thing because you 'll end up with people who really do n't want to . 
  this is also the best way to get the best cultural diversity . 
   it 's shortsighted . 
  no , you 're the one who is shortsighted . 
  the people who create nazism are people like you , who do n't understand social studies , who do n't understand history and who do n't understand economics . 
  something that has helped tremedously is media - games , movies , books etc has been spead all over the world . 
  people are influenced by other cultures and other people by their own choice . 
  something that has devastated the integration is forceful settlements . 
  palestinia and israel will probably fight for a long time over this . 
  wars are caused not by homogony but by people who have very few similarities . 
  it 's a slow process and that is something that should be respected . 
  for half a decade finns were discriminated in sweden and swedish speaking finns were discriminated in finland . 
  it 's still happening today but slowly over time this has diminished and is almost non existant anymore . 
  norwegians dislike swedes because they come and take jobs . 
  this is mostly because of economic reasons and is n't ethnic hate . 
  not all of the hate towards immgrants are ethnic hate either , they 're just annoyed that some people can come and live on their expense and contribute to lower wages and conditions . 
  [ norsk rikskringkasting made a series called `` swedes are humans '' because of this prejudice . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmrynddqipm ), 
  the government has made bad decisions since they were elected . 
  of course they 're not gon na stop now . 
  our minister of foreign affairs is [ carl bildt ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbsfif0qbcs ) by the way . 
  so was churchill , mlk and john kennedy . 
  rhethoric is an important part of getting public opinion . 
  why do you think my analogy was bad ? 
  janne josefsson is as much of an anti-nazi as you can come . 
   the mainstream socialist party got 5.6 % of the votes in 2010 and they have distanced themselves from these groups . 
  v\u00e4nstern is not socialdemokraterna . 
  the mainstream socialist party is definitely s and not v. v has tried to distance themselves from the groups but it 's clear that a lot of v are supporters of theses groups . 
  not only that but many who vote v and are part of unga v\u00e4nstern themselves are part of the autonomous left . 
  so in reality they 've ** tried ** to distance themselves but it 's a bit tricky when themselves are divided regarding the extreme left . 
  jonas sj\u00f6stedt probably dislikes the autonomous left a lot , but jonas is not alone in the party . 
  not really spoiled or upper class but instead middle or upper middle class people . 
  upper class tends to be right winged moderates . 
   very small group of extremists . 
  they are supported by a lot of influential people . 
  [ in case you missed grammisgalan let me remind you . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmpbgfueze4 ), 
  according to public opinion . 
  she 's good at speaking and better than the other politicians when it comes to arguing . 
  her politics , opinions and priorities is what 's keeping her down . 
  the autonomous left has commited no murders but they have been convicted for aggravated assaults , threats , attempted murder and violations towards the armament law , including knives and chemicals . 
  joel got 6.5 years for attempted murder for instance . 
  but yeah they 've balanced on a thin line for some time now . 
  yes . 
  but too much immigration is also bad . 
  can you see why ? 
  like everything else in the world it requires a delicate balance . 
  someone even called the host ( janne josefsson ) a nazi , which is like calling churchill a nazi . 
  the most dangerous people are those who view the world in black and white . 
  the translation is a bit off , just so you know . 
  the left party has tried to distance themselves from the autonomous left but it 's hard to because the youth among the left ( unga v\u00e4nstern ) support the autonomous left a lot . 
  these are people who see the world in black and white . 
  not really , it has been around for ages . 
  it 's a little slang though . 
  i 've seen it in every part of sweden actually . 
  some call them patate fritte . 
  we also call them `` strips '' . 
  so there are alternatives if you feel like you 're anti-france . 
  wow where are you even getting this from ? 
   it has nothing to do with immigrants . 
  they are human beings aswell . 
  no shit they 're humans but that 's beside the point . 
  sweden should prioritize it 's own citizens first . 
  every country should prioritize its own citizens first because why else would we have different countries ? 
  many swedes feel betrayed by the government who let a lot of immigrants in which in turn dumps the salaries . 
   to say that the immigrants are stealing our jobs is an idiotic thin to say . 
  i have n't said that . 
  a lot work in low education jobs , some not at all , very few in higher education jobs . 
  all around its a loss for sweden because of housing and grants . 
  the taxes the people who do work does n't come from immigrants from mena countries , they come from immigrants from germany , finland , norway , denmark , the netherlands etc. 
  to say `` we can either have all immigrants or none '' is stupid because obviously we have hard working immigrants who we need , and people who barely works at all . 
   in about 30-40 years , or when you are going into retirement , we have to rely on immigrants to take care of us because our working population in declining . 
  maybe but those immigrants would come from europe , not mena countries . 
   to answer on your second point , the housing shortage , is only relevant in the big cities ( which sweden has like 2 or 3 of ) . 
  there are shitloads places to live in smaller cities . 
  no way .
