  you do n't even know what you talk about . 
   a solution is to accept the immigrants into sweden and then let them live somewhere else than stockholm . 
  because a lot of illegal immigrants are almost forced to stay in stockholm . 
  this is the most idiotic solution i 've heard . 
  you 're saying instead of regulating immigration we should increase it because people come into the country illegally ? 
  none of the immigrants can afford any place other than the million project homes . 
  we have capitalists housing real refugees ( not relative immigration ) who live in bad conditions . 
   the conclusion is that the immigrants are not the problem . 
  the issue is the govenments indecisiveness when it comes to how to create jobs . 
  you have no idea what you 're talking about and you 're stuck in a dream world . 
  wake up , this is reality . 
  this is n't your imagination where everyone wants to be peaceful and is good and can get along . 
  besides the problem with the current government is that they 're moderates who just prioritize big businesses before anyone else . 
  they 've spent billions on bad projects to get people into jobs and every single one has been not just a loss but a huge loss , both in time and taxes . 
  we have strict laws regarding the building industry . 
  the government hoped investors would invest in building houses but they would profit too little . 
  housing shortage in combination with house bubble is n't very good . 
   but in a way they are , they focus on womens rights only . 
  a lot of their concern is women 's rights , however they do take stand in other questions . 
  for instance they 've extreme views such as `` every person within the borders of sweden is eligible for welfare . 
  '' , which makes their next point of `` a person can not be deported under any circumstances . '', 
  very troubling . 
   he was not merely `` criticizing '' islam , he was committing what the court judged lies and hate speech and got sentenced for it . 
  there is a thin line between hate speech and critique . 
  if he would 've said `` according to studies ... * what he said * '' then he would 've been off the hook . 
  yes they are in their politics . 
  the problem in sweden is that the swedish goverment does n't prioritize its own citizens . 
  we have a lot of unemployment among the youth and their solution is to set people on unpaid work , which will enable a grant for roughly 330 $ per month . 
  this is paid for by tax money . 
  this means the competition for jobs will go up , especially easy jobs where you 'll usually get work experience . 
  at the same time they make tax reductions for employers like mcdonald 's in hope of making new jobs , which did not happend ( surprise surprise ) . 
  mcdonald 's have tons of people lining up to get a job . 
  the swedish public employment service tries to hide statistics by sending people out on unpaid interships , giving people a short education or going to `` job coaches '' . 
  another problem is that the government decides to take in tons more people when we have a housing shortage . 
  anyone trying to say `` well ... we 've a lot of unemployed and moving towards needing higher educated people . 
  perhaps it 's best to regulate the immigration . '', 
  will be met with `` you fucking racist/islamophobic/homophobic / anti-semite/xenophic/afrophobic / asiaphobic/buddophobic/misogynistic / whatever newspeak they come up with '' . 
  a slogan for leftists is `` dare to not take the debate '' when refering to immigration . 
  they are stubborn to admit immigration is a problem . 
  sure there are racists who say the immigrants are the problem but its mostly the government not putting restrictions ( saying we in this country believe in this , this and this etc ) and regulating what is good for the country and thus the population as a whole . 
  the most left parties want to `` save the world '' but that is n't done by taking away the ones who actually can afford to travel to europe ( mainly doctors , engineers and those who can afford to come here ) . 
  all they did was hurt themselves . 
  besides `` immigrant youth '' does n't necessarily mean islamists or muslims . 
  it probably just refers to middle eastern countries , somalia , eritrea , pakistan and afghanistan . 
  5 % muslims in sweden . 
  they are n't going to get anything through . 
  and sweden more than luxembourg , what 's your point ? 
  what is n't true ? 
  i expect a lot of insanity . 
  mainly because f !, 
  stands for stupid things . 
  they 're delusional . 
  their ideology does n't even make any sense but they can not comprehend that ( ignoring their violence ) . 
  they ( revolutionary front/afa , common name autonomous left - an extreme left organisation ) videotaped their violence . 
  they support terrorist organizations such as [ ira ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_republican_army ) , [ red brigades ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/red_brigades ) and [ pkk ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kurdistan_workers%27_party ) . 
  they have influence in a lot of places [ here they are in the background when ume\u00e5 cultural centre inaugurated spring winter . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmsppliq5tm#t=1923 ) the text on their shirts is `` free joel '' and joel is a guy who is arrested on the charge of attempted manslaughter ( he was later convicted - he got 6 1/2 years ) . 
  [ they show themselves in popular music such as kartellens ( the cartel 's ) music video . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvsu9xfn2ow ) they show authentic pictures of revolutionary front 's actions . 
  the singer himself believe revolutionary front is the `` lower class ' vengeance towards injustice '' . 
  [ here they are showned in a famous programme called grammisgalan , which is like the swedish equivalent of the grammy awards . 
  it 's quite big in sweden . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmsppliq5tm#t=3251 ) note that everyone stand up to show their support . 
  [ here is an interview ( english ) with the slovak workers . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmsppliq5tm#t=2696 ) [ here is good summary of the stuff they do and get away with . 
  it includes `` home visits '' , anarchy , tons of violence and offenses against the armament law . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2urzqitmzvs ) take note of the music they use . 
  the reason why these people are so dangerous is because other people support them in the fight of `` good or evil '' ( nazis evil - communists good ) . 
  the whole report i 've linked timestamps to includes footage of the beating of the two slovak workers . 
  [ sweden does that . 
  ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/20130422/47474 ) to quote :  russian fighter planes carried out training missions just outside the swedish border over easter ; ** sweden 's military , however , was too slow to react and had to rely on help from nato , ** the svenska dagbladet newspaper ( svd ) revealed on monday . 
   finnish air force immediately deployed fighters . 
  you see , this is why i like having finland as neighbors , you do n't wait 2 weeks and have a few coffee breaks before checking out what that plane is , you run out of your saunas with your bottle of vodka in one hand and a knife in the other to find out who it is . 
  we have a thing called `` facket '' in sweden which tries to regulate the workmarket so the workers can get good benefits . 
  imported labour is n't something companies do publicly because facket gets upset , which is something you do not want to happen . 
  companies hire people descretely with promises of job here in sweden . 
  jobs that usually just require little to no education to get started . 
   take the interview they are n't interviewed . 
   provide recommendations lower sallary  recommendation  applications being a human is sufficient this is all done behind closed doors and is hushed about greatly . 
  it 's mostly done in fields where they do n't have to interact with anyone . 
  companies preferably get `` outsourced '' workers from another `` company '' outside of the country . 
  the thing about the swedish immigration policy is that anyone who manage to cross the border pretty much can stay . 
   so they 're blaming it on themselfes , would n't that be ludicrous?do they say it 's happened because of politics ' impotence ? 
  if so , they 're basically admitting their profession 's incompetence . 
  they 're blaming the other politicans obviously . 
   this does n't make sense . 
  how are somalis related to swedes in any way?is it a breech in the immigration laws or were there swedes who have been living in somalia , historically ? 
  a few moves here because they study or got a job . 
  the rest follows . 
  companies abuse the fact that they can recieve workers who work for lesser wages this way . 
   all things considered , sweden should have sticked to social conservatism like in australia or japan , instead of bashing on muslim immigrants after they 've been given clear signs they 're wholeheartedly welcome . 
  sd are n't blaming immigrants . 
  they 're blaming the politicans . 
  all they ask of immigrants is to adapt to the swedish society which is frowned upon . 
   on the other hand , it could have gotten it 's extra labour force ( if it so urgently requires it as the liberal gotvt appears to be saying in sweden ) , they could just make it a more attractive place for eu citizens . 
  a lot of immigrants go unemployed because they have a comparatively low education . 
  `` anh\u00f6righetsinvadring '' ( family reuinion immigration ) stands for the majority of the immigration . 
  from somalia we had for instance one who immigrated for work-related things , and around 400 who immigrated because of anh\u00f6righetsinvandring . 
  the reality is they do very little for the society as a whole . 
  we actually have a lot of immigration from eu countries , and the government puts those together with immigration from middle east .
