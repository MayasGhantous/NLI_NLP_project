  ] ( http://wwwc.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/0003/13/dokument.html ) it 's the same newspaper which now tries to deny anything bad about immigration . 
  [ an article from year 2002 . 
  you 're funny . 
   why does this have to make the headlines this many times now , whereas in past years this kind of news was unheard of . 
  not even . 
  sd has been on the rise for a century - when the effects of immigration from the middle eastern countries were starting to show . 
   honestly if you thought it was a bad idea you should have sticked to conservationism , like japan . 
  because people trust that the politicans make good decisions . 
  politicans still want to make it easier for immigrants to immigrate to sweden . 
   i keep hearing the fact that arabs do n't `` integrate '' in the west-european societies , but are westerners getting islamized when living in muslim countries ? 
  for one a lot of people collect support from the swedish government . 
  for two they 're overly represented in the crime statistics and for three they 've invoked a new type of crime - honour killing/honour violence . 
   wake up ; the truth is arabs are europe 's friends . 
  give me anything to prove that the swedish people actually can profit something off this . 
   the americas are energy self sufficient now lol . 
  not even . 
   but europe is running dry on oil and gas in its traditional resource extraction areas like the northern sea . 
  we import from russia or use alternative energy sources . 
  oil will soon become a thing of the past . 
   either you deal with the arabs or with the russians ; i think you already know where this is going . 
  in case you do n't know there are a lot of reserves outside of britain for instance and norway has a ton of reserves . 
  both russiand and the arab nations are entirely dependant on countries to buy their oil , if it suddenly stops ** their ** economy is going to hit the ground , not anyone else 's . 
   middle east is undoubtably the nr .1 oil & gas producer , and the eu comes second only to usa in energy consumption and dependance . 
  middle east produces like half the gas compared to usa or russia . 
   naturally , the relations between europe and arab countries have to be symbiotic . 
  nah , with the oil on decline the arab nations have to give in for a more secularized way of living . 
  dubai is trying to become a tourism paradise but it probably wo n't succeed in the long run . 
  sweden has never been east denmark . 
  actually sweden has a 9-4 record versus denmark . 
  he apparently also said that the swedish general public support the islamic militant organisation [ hezbollah . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hezbollah ), 
  this is just gibberish . 
  none can actually understand what they are saying . 
  but the norwegians were funny though . 
  you can relearn languages . 
  if you have a lot of pros of moving to switzerland then why not ? 
  stop worrying is my advice . 
  what 's stopping you ? 
  [ i agree . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cessrfxqs1q ) however i consider most politicans to be stupid . 
  it was . 
  for politicians it would be like shooting themselves in the foot once for their career and another for their own taxes . 
  she suggested all men pay a higher tax which should go towards violence against women . 
   this is what you initially wrote : this means in practice that a russian guy can come up to me '' pretty singular ? 
  what do you expect ? 
  a whole choir to come up to me ? 
  of course a single person makes a statement , just like the single guy made the statement in the article . 
   my initial point is that your example when you discredit russians in front of a russian is false and would not be included in the law against hate speech . 
  that is backed up by the example when a 16 year old was acquitted for doing a hitler salute . 
  fine , whatever , did you want me to include a group ? 
  do you have a point to all this or do you just want to nitpick ? 
   a insult of miscredit aimed towards a small group of russians or one single isnt enough to be included , at least according to the the professional lawyers of the court but you probably know better right ? 
  name an example of a too little group . 
  what quantifies as a `` large group '' anyhow ? 
  you know the laws are written so they 're up for interpretations . 
  anyhow if you want to just be nitpicky . 
  a russian makes a global statement that says that all swedes are murderers , dumb and love sheep a lot . 
  a swede makes the same statement back saying that all russians are murderers , dumb and love sheep a lot . 
  the swede can get fined and the russian ca n't . 
  do you fancy the example now ? 
   no , one of the sources claims that . 
  are you thick ? 
  ** read and then post . 
   here is a source that says its a culture spread all over the world : source interesting . 
   however , the view of women as property with no rights of their own is deeply rooted in islamic culture well now i know where the politican got one of his sources . 
  anyhow your source does n't even include the origin of honour killings or honour violence . 
  it just states it happens but not by who or for what reason . 
  it does n't state which culture or religion uses it now . 
  fyi abrahamic religions thought honour killings was good , but christianty and judaism removed it when they started to become secular . 
  they believed it was `` mericful '' because of dishonor . 
   no you clearly wrote russian and not russians . 
  are you a troll ? 
  for your own sake i hope you 're trolling . 
  i clearly wrote `` russian ** s ** '' . 
   so no , a small group of people could not be the target hate speech . 
  they can . 
  any ** group ** can . 
   tired of people trying to discredit a law they even do n't fully understand . 
  you 're funny because if you actually read the law it states :  ** upps\u00e5tligen , i uttalande eller ** i annat meddelande som sprids, 
   i discussing the reason for it , countless regions all over the world greatly oppresses females and have done long before islam and span all over the world . 
  can you even read ? 
  if you can read you can clearly see that wikipedia say they 're connected to the arab/kurdish culture . 
   you are not stating your point and what you agues for . 
  the article quotes are just historic statements . 
  seriously ? 
  wow ... next time you try to contribute to something read the sources i give you or provide your own , preferably with quotes from the article/source . 
  saying mine does n't count and that they 're `` historic statements '' does n't cut it because they ** clearly ** are n't . 
  it 's an article made by a muslim to explain islam to the general public . 
  [ do you remember when she burned around 15 thousand dollars in swedish currency ? 
  ( yup , that 's a big bag of 15 dollar notes ( 100 sek notes ) ) ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/gudrun_eldar_hundra_tusen_-_och_hettar_upp_debatten_img_6403.jpg ), 
   how is that not a private discussion ? 
  it could be but you 're assuming things ( in my case no it was n't private ) . 
  also stop nitpicking about details . 
  is it because you do n't understand my all around point or do you just want to pick details appart and say my all around premise was wrong ? 
   and if you say it to one specific person it is not included in the law , even if you are out in the public . 
  not to one specific person perhaps , but if i 'm out with friends and a group of russian guys come and say that , are you happy with the scenario ? 
  [ swedish politicans ] ( http://politikerbloggen.tv4.se/files/2013/09/sya3d8261.jpg ) say [ stupid things ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/20140107/hitler-furious-at-swedish-ministers-satire-mishap ) all the time . 
   oh a link to the wiki-page of what honor killings is ? 
  so for my feebly functioning mind , maybe can get the slightest grasp of the term and get back in the game again with the great thinker and scholar that is yourself ? 
  wow you 're ridiculous .
