  [ here is the wikipedia source which states so much more , including  ( http://www.islamiska.org/s/heder.htm )  i jahiliyyan hade kvinnor mycket l\u00e5gt v\u00e4rde . 
  are you enlightened now perhaps ? 
   but what is your point ? 
  let me guess : its the muslims and arabs !, 
  if you can read i just quoted the article . 
  i never said it was in a private discussion . 
  i said he came up to me . 
  even if he said `` you swedes rape , kill and murder entire towns . '', 
  and i said the same thing back , `` you russians rape , kill and murder entire towns . '', 
  he could report me for `` hets mot folkgrupp '' and i can not report him . 
  it 's not really what you say that is is offensive , but to what you say it to . 
  if it 's an ethnic group ? 
  ( e.g russians ) then it falls under `` hets mot folkgrupp '' for instance . 
   are in my opinion a result of female oppression . 
  perhaps but why should we care about your opinion ? 
  if you want to dispute the grounds your best bet is facts . 
  saying it 's your opinion does n't make it true , and it does n't prove anything either . 
  [ wikipedia is a good first step . 
  ] ( http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/hedersmord )  the problem here is archaic/obsolete behaviors that are not specific to any regions or religions . 
  they 're way more prevalent in certain regions and religions . 
  it 's hate speech and falls under `` hets mot folkgrupp '' because i refer to all russians as such . 
  if i said `` well * you 're * an asshat '' he could n't really report for `` hets mot folkgrupp '' . 
  sure nothing would probably come out of it but the legal framework is there for him to report me but i can not report him . 
  [ this guy agrees , and it 's quite worth the watch . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmuzrhwmkmu ), 
  the name of the law is called `` hets mot folkgrupp '' which means `` baiting towards group '' ( it 's difficult to translate ) . 
  anyhow since the guy 's surname is `` hess '' , the people over at / r/sweden had some fun and called it `` hess mot folkgrupp '' ( hess against groups ) . 
  anyway regarding the hate speech law , people dislike it because it does very little good and it 's made to protect any groups from swedes . 
  it does not protect swedes from any other groups . 
  this means in practice that a russian guy can come up to me and say `` you swedes are arrogant pricks . '', 
  and if i then reply `` well you russians are asshats . '', 
  he can report me for `` hets mot folkgrupp '' but i can not . 
  people are made of carbon . 
  let 's just ban carbon altogether !, 
  i think you 're exaggerating . 
  but just to give you a headache , people also believe sweden is being ruined by matriarchy or feminisim . 
  islam has a bad view towards women , feminists hate to be looked down upon . 
  ironically these groups support eachother a lot .

   apologies for any mistakes , i blame my not being swedish no mistakes , but can i blame you for being a dane ? 
   well , islam feeds into patriarchy , like most other religions ( curious , that , is n't it ) , but rape and abuse are obviously not the norm among muslims , and claiming that it is serves no other purpose than inciting hatred of an already vulnerable minority in sweden . 
  it 's pretty relative . 
  honour killings have roots in preislamic arabia , specifically the honour culture and view towards women . 
  honour violence and oppression are things that happen regularly . 
  for instance brothers who want to `` revenge '' because their sister likes a guy and the guy likes her back . 
  this is n't something unique for islam but general middle east . 
  to quote [ wikipedia  ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/honor_killing#europe )  the issue of honor killings has risen to prominence in europe in recent years , prompting the need to address the occurrence of honor killings . 
   it mainly affects women , who are its most frequent victims , both in europe and the rest of the world , especially in patriarchal and fundamentalist communities and societies . 
  in sweden , there was a case where the father shot his daughter because :  ... she had refused to accept kurdish traditions of arranged marriages and instead chose a relationship with a swedish man , patrick lindesjos . 
  in sweden we 've had six convictions of honour killings , however there is a lot of hidden statistics on this subject mainly because it 's difficult to prove . 
  people do n't want to testify . 
  women are thrown off balconies and then say they fell . 
  2/3 of the interviewed support groups say that women who come there say their parents invites them to commit suicide . 
  1/3 of the support groups heard cover ups of honour killings . 
  exactly my thought process . 
  however this map is a bit confusing . 
  i meant it the other way , as in `` are you sure there are less french immigrants than other immigrants ? 
  ohh right . 
  you 're probably correct . 
  yeah but would n't english be the first second most spoken language ? 
  are there really a lot of french immigrants in the uk compared to other minority groups ? 
  english is the second second most spoken language in united kingdom ? 
  op do you have a source on these statistics ? 
  because it seems ... improbable .

  i would guess it has something to do with which side the countries sympathize with in the israel - palestine conflict . 
  however a thing that struck me as odd was that they included religion in some of the countries questions but not all . 
  in for instance iraq , egypt etc i bet the religion has huge influence on the answers . 
  also i found the way they calculate religion is a bit strange . 
  sk has 60 % christian , 45 % buddhist and 51 none/atheist for instance . 
  #justswedethings . 
   it 's not helping the little guy talking about the about the israel - palestine conflict . 
  israel has done many atrocities which are covered in the news and palestine has perhaps done some but it 's not covered in the news as extensively . 
   if swedes really want to help the little guy , maybe you can take an interest into swedish jews specially the ones in malmo , who live in conditions approaching that of medieval europe . 
  studies show that for instance 39 % of muslims have anti-semitic views . 
  the thing is people are afraid to criticize islam or muslims because people counter the argument by `` well not all are so such as all are n't terrorists '' . 
  we have an extreme party in sweden called swedish democrats who wants to ban burqa and niqab . 
  they want to have a zero tolerance policy towards immigrants basically and are generally very anti-islam . 
  a somewhat controversial statement was made by a sweden democrats politician when he said  raping and abusing women who dislike islam is deeply rooted into the islamic culture . 
  which in turn led to a 32,000 kr fine . 
  wether the statement was true or not did n't matter because it offended muslims . 
  over 70,000 muslims are also part in smf who wants , and i quote :  ... demanding special legislation for muslims in sweden , including the right to specific islamic holidays , special public financing for the building of mosques , that all divorces between muslim couples be approved by an imam , and that imams should be allowed to teach islam to children of muslim parents in public schools . 
  this was met by a lot of criticism ( both inside and outside ) however , but the fact that it had supporters is scary . 
  we recently had a ** state employed ** radiohost who said `` ca n't janne josefsson just come out as a nazi once and for all ? '', 
  when janne josefsson made a report on how much the autonomous left causes anarchy and all around disturbance and violence . 
  i just want to note that this is like saying `` ca n't churchill/gandhi just come out as a nazi once and for all ? '' . 
  also worth noting is that he made a report on nazism a week earlier but the radiohost obviously did n't take that into account . 
  it 's only going to get worse because the `` anti-racists '' ( read as supporters of the autonomous left ) wants to `` dare to not take the discussion '' . 
  sd are growing stronger and people think that pouring gasoline and oxygen on the fire that sd are is going to solve everything magically ... 
  somewhat like our right-winged government . 
  the problem with sweden is that we believe we should stand up and help the little guy - but we can not comprehend the consequences . 
   and how exactly did they make this money with this wedding ? 
  tourism , public relations and souvenirs . 
   then i guess it 's documented somewhere ?
