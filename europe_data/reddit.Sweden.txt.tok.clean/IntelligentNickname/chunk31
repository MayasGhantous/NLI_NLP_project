  so what 's your argument for advanced countries not to use it ? 
   where are our flying cars then ? 
  we have helicopters and aeroplanes . 
  we also have rockets . 
  what 's your point ? 
   which almost nobody predicted . 
  they did predict nuclear-powered vacuum cleaners : where are they ? 
  face it , nuclear did n't deliver on its promises , and it 's more unlikely every day it ever will . 
  time to start betting on other horses . 
  why stop developing a very promising technology ? 
  you can mutually research both nuclear power and solar energy . 
  one does n't exclude another . 
  i really look forward to the age of solar cells but i also believe nuclear energy will be a big part of that world . 
  also `` they predicted '' is n't a valid argument . 
  people in the early 1900s thought fossile fuels was a clean source of energy . 
  you ca n't ask unqualified people about the future , obviously you 'll get skewed answers . 
   imports in peat yes . 
  we have a lot of peat in sweden . 
  imports count for nothing . 
  [ here 's an article ] ( http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/torv#anv.c3.a4ndning ) and no my links are not electricity but energi in general . 
  did you even read them ? 
  the title clearly states `` energy in sweden '' . 
  i do n't know ... we do n't import a lot and we definitely use more peat than gas . 
  [ here 's an article in english . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/electricity_sector_in_sweden ) [ here 's one if you can read swedish . 
   expensive , under control of big state/big corp , slow to build , hard to control , potentially catastrophic , why do you say `` under control of state '' as a con ? 
  that 's stupid . 
  also `` potentially catastrophic '' is n't really catastrophic if you take it seriously . 
  chernobyl was negligence . 
   takes millenia to clean up . 
  clean up what ? 
  the disasters ? 
  yeah they happend some time ago but rarely happends . 
  only fukushima disaster has happend since chernobyl if you count nuclear plants . 
  considering there are over 400 reactors in the world which are operational . 
   if wishes were water , we 'd all drown . 
  i like science fiction too , but that does n't mean i base my policy choices on it . 
  science fiction does n't come from nowhere . 
  fusion powerplants are under construction and we went from computers which were building sized to pocket sized . 
   check any list of imports for sweden and you 'll find it . 
  can you link one ? 
   sweden does use gas , a lot of it , mostly in its industries where it is in rarely replaceable with something else . 
  ehh ... we use a lot of peat . 
  do you have any source that we use gas ? 
   according to this map it 's 100 % . 
  [ here 's a map of what we use . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/sveriges_elproduktion_1900-2008.gif ) we do n't use gas . 
   but not as energy source . 
  why do you think nuclear is bad as a resource ? 
  it seems like the optimal source to me . 
  imagine if we could develop fusion reactors which you could have on cars or aeroplanes . 
  if you 're refering to the chernobyl disaster , their reactors were safe . 
  however they just wanted to `` show off '' just how safe their reactors are , and by doing so they turned on max capacity . 
   plants could be privatized in the future doubt it . 
  sweden likes their left side politics . 
  ** if ** they 're gon na be privatized , it would be in the far future when nuclear power is 100 % safe . 
  jokes aside you made a very valid point . 
  it 's fun to joke if you 're at an even playing field , but joking about someone down or perhaps in some cases up is harsh and cruel . 
  it 's sad that some people can only see the world in black and white and then tell everyone must adapt to their view of the world . 
  [ perhaps ... ] ( http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/multimedia/hq/mab/sweden_08_mab2011.jpg ) [ or maybe ... ] ( http://thevelvetrocket.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/stockholm-archipelago.jpg ) [ why not ... ] ( http://www.naturvardsverket.se/upload/var-natur/skyddad-natur/nationalparker/padjelanta/padjelanta-fjall-73202151-hog.jpg ) [ i know !,

  second one is also an archipegalo in stockholm . 
  third one is norrland because of the fell . 
  fourth one could be anywhere . 
  fifth and sixth ones could also be anywhere since they are meadows . 
   i wo n't even touch the fact that you chose a muslim organization to represent something worse than the sd . 
  yes because my choice of an example of a party who does n't want democracy is proof that i am a moron . 
   your ignorance about what a huge threat to democracy they truly are is staggering . 
  you make a very convincing case . 
   you do n't have a problem with defining them as fascists , but you think that they are not white supremacists and that they have changed their ways since the nineties . 
  you are a moron . 
  the only thing they have changed is their appearance . 
  prove it . 
  besides do you think the 360.000 people who voted for sd into the riksdag are also nazis and white supremacists ? 
  besides are n't you gon na mention i do n't want to label v\u00e4nstern as communists ? 
  no problems with that ? 
   he left party ( v\u00e4nstern ) is by my definition definitely a communist party . 
  they definitely are n't . 
  every party is going more and more towards the centre . 
   i 'm not an economist and neither are you how can you possibly know what i know on the subject ? 
  stop assuming things . 
   a political party ca n't just say that what they did twenty years ago is irrelevant . 
  especially not when they do n't even change their politics accordingly . 
  it pretty much is n't . 
  v\u00e4nstern are n't communists and sd are n't nazist anymore . 
  they have definitely changed their politics accordingly . 
  look at what they say and stop assuming things . 
   i honestly could n't care less about your arguments about the economy you could n't care less about the economy . 
  you obviously does n't know anything . 
   but your insistence on claiming that the sweden democrats are n't nazis is deeply disturbing they have roots in nazism but are fascist now . 
  why do you have a problem with that ? 
   these people do n't want democracy . 
  they use democracy as a tool to gain power . 
  look at their programme . 
  hizb ut-tahrir do n't want democracy if you want a comparison . 
   their goal is white supremacy . 
  you should take off your tin foil hat . 
  this is further away than what people think . 
  it 's a prototype which is n't actually safe . 
  they said they aim for 100 self driving cars in 3 years , which may or may not happen .
