  italy was a fasicst state long time before nazism . 
  the only thing they were liberated from was mussolini . 
  no they were n't . 
  they were liberated from mussolini . 
   i honestly have no idea where you are going with these posts ... 
  i actually put it quite nicely . 
  italy was n't a victim of nazism . 
  what do you mean `` and then what ? '' ? 
  italy was n't a victim of nazism . 
  [ italy was a fascist state before the nazis .

  i like them because they sing in french . 
  i too got austria ... 
  strange . 
   when you 're in a country that is n't yours you should respect its culture . 
  you should hear sweden 's policy on this . 
  quite the opposite . 
  russia reserves their right to use nuclear weapons . 
  if `` we win '' , it 'll be a small consolation . 
  how does [ `` the smart ones rule '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/geniocracy ) sound ? 
   sadly no such system exists yet . 
  well it is n't gon na make up itself . 
  got any ideas ? 
  berlusconi owns some ( most ? ), 
  media . 
  not as much as christanity . 
  churches to mosques ratio is still 1650 - 3 or something . 
  as an agnostic i find all religions ridiculous and quite frankly the only religion i would tolerate to have in sweden is buddhism or a milder version of the current lutheranian church . 
  luckily christanity is n't exactly forced upon you here ( thank ~ ~ god ~ ~ gustav vasa ) . 
  what i 've read though , says islam is more proned of forceful conversion and intolerance towards other religions which i strongly oppose . 
  islam is also more extreme with policies such as wife beating , dehumanising women etc. 
  jews are also receiving a lot of threats and abuse from the muslim immigrants here .

  it was more of a joke , sorry . 
   my point is more towards the fact that this is n't evidence of islam ` taking over ' the uk , as some would like us to believe . 
  sweden has a higher percentage of muslim citizens . 
  we are n't as primitive as you think . 
  i do n't think so . 
  [ these are common in workplaces ] ( http://www.hgmdryckservice.se/media/378475/kaffeautomat_wittenborg_es7100_v3.jpg ) and [ these are common in homes . 
  ] ( http://royaldesign.se/products/149/51012357.jpg ), 
  common . 
   there is a lot of racism towards middle eastern immigrants in the uk . 
  i 've heard both ways . 
  a lot of racism from muslims and a lot of islamophobia from the british . 
   not many reputable sources are covering this story , because it is n't really news , but here 's a less biased article thank you . 
  this actually makes it even worse that subway has supported this practice for 7 years . 
   as for / r/ukpolitics , here 's the article i was referring to , as well as a recent modpost about anti-islam vote brigading from 4chan : thank you . 
  however i think the criticism is valid in this case . 
  animal torture should n't be exempted just because you 're religious and saying people oppress your religious freedom because they prevent you from torturing animals is quite frankly ridiculous . 
   since you live in sweden , you may not know that in the uk there is a vocal anti-islam movement , and articles like this are mostly written for that racist slant . 
  are you saying this article is biased or wrong ? 
  if so can you link to a more neutral page . 
  also you can not be racist against a religion , you can be an islamophobe or anti-semitic . 
  a broader term is antitheist . 
   this article was posted in / r/ukpolitics as an example of how muslims are ` taking over ' and are ` forcing their culture ' upon the rest of britain . 
  can you link the thread ? 
   and then there 's religious exemptions to various health and childcare laws ... 
  it 's just stupid . 
  i know circumcision is legal in usa . 
   that is fucked up . 
  animal torture and abuse is banned . 
  halal and kosher are exempted because they are for religious reasons . 
  it 's ridiculous that religious reason is a valid excuse for torture . 
   does n't seem that big of a deal to me . 
  torturing animals is . 
  in sweden , all religious slaughter is banned . 
  it is considered torture by many because the animals bleed to death which could take up to two minutes . 
  they consider the slaughtered animal to be `` haram '' ( `` dirty '' or `` sinful '' - it means they wo n't eat it ) if the animals are n't concious during the killing . 
  judaism and islam are the two religions which preforms [ shechita ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shechita ) or [ dhabiha ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dhabiha ) . 
  they 're pretty much the same . 
  the jewish community blamed `` anti-semitism '' for criticizing them . 
  partly true during the winter , not even close to the truth in the summer . 
  during the summers a ton of people spend a lot of time in the forests , islands , waters , fields or fika places : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fika_ ( coffee_break ) . 
  during the winters a lot of people go skiing or ice skating for instance . 
  i have n't actually been to portugal , so i can not say if it 's any different , but i travel a lot , and have been to a lot of countries in southern eu . 
  i made friends in every country extremely quickly , but it faded away . 
  i 've been in touch with most of my friends in sweden and i 've only lost connection with a few friends when i was young ( because they moved or we had a massive fallout ) . 
  in my personal experience it has also been incredibly difficult to share feelings or thoughts with people outside of scandinavia . 
  they just are n't interested or consider it petty . 
  i can generally know some things about a lot of people if they are n't scandinavian , but with scandinavians i know them in and out . 
  swedes are actually very sociable , especially in the summer . 
  but it 's a different kind , i can not quite put my finger on it . 
   if im not mistaken ive heard scandinavians are more socially introverted and southern europeans more outgoing . 
  perhaps a little . 
  a general pattern i see for scandinavians is that we want a few very close friends , while others ( us , south eu ) wants a lot of friends but not very close ones . 
  i do n't know how to exactly put it but it 's just different , not better or worse . 
  it sounds like danish without a potato in their mouth . 
  or islandic ... perhaps ... 
  i 'm not sure . 
  is it influenced by fenno-swedish ? 
  danish people loves their p\u00f6lse . 
  dubai is not located in saudi arabia but instead in united arab emirates . 
   the official name is just hydrogen peroxide , the di - part is implied by the peroxide . 
  ohh right . 
   right . 
  e numbers are actually additives approved to be safe yeah , for instance e948 is pure oxygen , e949 pure hydrogen and e260 acetic acid . 
   the whole ` anti-chemicals ' thing is silly . 
  agreed . 
  we need them . 
   this kind of nonsense is why more scientists do n't get involved in politics yeah and this is one of the reasons why we have people who do n't understand anything of what they 're trying to do but still campaign for it .
