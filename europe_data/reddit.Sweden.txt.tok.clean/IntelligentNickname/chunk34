  as an example , the swedish minister for justice , actually does n't even have a degree in anything . 
  she studied economics for a year around 35 years ago . 
  not to say that i 'm for cannabis to be legal , but it 's funny hearing how controversial she is in her statements . 
  she made [ headlines ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/20140107/hitler-furious-at-swedish-ministers-satire-mishap ) when she believed a satirical article was for real . 
  it 's scaring how people without evidence or scientific support and just their beliefs can get into a position of power . 
  in any case one example does n't constitute for everyone . 
  for most people it would cost around 100-110 $ for 1gbps broadband . 
  yeah . 
  in general people are stupid when it comes to what is `` pure '' and not . 
  a chemical or molecule does n't sound very pure because it 's one in the mass . 
  while h ^ 2 o could be dangerous ( drowning , drinking too much etc ) it 's not as toxic as h ^ 2 o ^ 2 ( dihydrogen dioxide or more commonly dihydrogen peroxide ) . 
  they could 've gone with either and people would 've signed because they are chemicals . 
  it 's the same thing with [ e numbers . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/e_number ) you generally assume they 're bad because either one or more are dangerous . 
  same with bacteria . 
  i agree fully . 
  the biggest concern is perhaps nuclear proliferation . 
  tailings could be said about any mineral and is n't unique for any fissible material . 
  waste disposal is also an issue , however as we advance in technology we can overcome this obstacle . 
  it 's a better option than all of the coal we throw into the atmosphere . 
  a common scaring tactic seems to be that the reactors can explode any time and just kill everyone which obviously is n't true . 
  most accidents ( all maybe ? ), 
  have been caused by negligence . 
  in / r/sweden we had a thread about wether the green party ( in sweden ) were extremists , because of extreme views such as a non-violence defence . 
  it 's ridiculous how people are so optimistic and smug about their feelings . 
  i would like to see a green party member who is a true realist and who actually knows stuff in the area they criticize . 
  ironic , is n't it ? 
  they do n't go on evidence which is ridiculous . 
  first of all 100/10 means `` 100mbps broadband '' . 
  10/10 is `` 10mbps broadband '' since down is in most cases used and definitely when playing games . 
  144kr is around 16 $ , not the 5 $ or 9 $ as you stated . 
  if you actually hover your mouse on the star you 'll see their prices showing is n't the actual price , it 's just their price for 3 months . 
  the actual price you 'll pay on month 4 + is double what it states there . 
  it says 100/10 costs 289kr which is around 32 $ . 
  the prices may vary but if we take [ bahnhof ] ( https://www.bahnhof.se/bredband/ ) their 1gbps/100mbps costs around 900-1000kr per month . 
  same with alltele . 
  not sure which isp you have because 3 $ is 27kr and 7 $ is 63kr but i assume you 're just talking out of your ass . 
  yeah same in sweden . 
  a lot of people are becoming annoyed by biased media portraying anyone who does n't agree with them as extremists , racists or misogynic . 
  1gbps internet is available , however it costs around 110 $ per month ... not really worth it i 'm afraid . 
  sweden is so scared to be labelled as racist , and thus is called racist for the most pathetic reasons . 
  same goes for unequality , so we have feminists throwing out stupid comments and then are n't held accountable . 
  it is a blanket statement just like every stereotype ever . 
  the fact that people in sweden walk around in [ this ] ( http://www.roligaprylar.se/media/catalog/product/2/1/21-22100-20120918110957.jpg ) outfit on lucia makes an awkward impression around the world . 
  i 'm not saying dutch persons are racist , but they are portayed as such because of their celebration of zwarte piet . 
  in sweden we speak swe dish . 
   that the men are girly yup . 
   scandinavians do n't eat traditional scandinavian food . 
  my jordgubbst\u00e5rta and k\u00f6ttbullar o potatis would like to have a talk with you . 
   stop being so gullible . 
  beggars would not have the money to travel from romania to sweden ( maybe they walked the whole way ? ) . 
  swedes are so gullable and believe there are three tiers of wealth and prosperity : rich , middle , poor . 
  by poor they just think of starving people living without access to water . 
  it 's always black or white . 
  no perception of reality at all . 
   i did n't include a pun i see your problem . 
  well at least one country think of us as humans ... that 's good ... 
  yup . 
  facebook among other social websites were flooded with people having [ this ] ( http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_losdojp8aw1qdge4zo1_250.png ) or similar profile pictures after the 2011 terrorist attack . 
  does norway like sweden back ? 
  [ not so much . 
  ] ( http://sd.keepcalm-o-matic.co.uk/i/keep-calm-and-hate-sweden.png ), 
  apparently * greece * has 1,244 mbts ... 
  most of any country in europe ... second and third comes romania and poland by 1,098 , 1063 respectively . 
  found that quite amusing . 
  sweden 's per capital spending is 5th , at $ 459 , and as a percent of gdp 1.12 % , which is 17th and beneath eu middle and median . 
  if there is any war with eu , our best hope is gb and france . 
  i 'm working on it . 
  little steps . 
  i 'm joking about sweden 's defensive capability . 
  it 's on the right track now though . 
  so ... can we now hold for 16 days instead of two weeks ? 
  i do n't think there is an english equivalent . 
  there is more hate than reddit but less hate than 4chan . 
  it 's mostly used for practical things such as `` how to do '' or discussions . 
  it 's more like an open type of darknet . 
   ~ ~ racism ~ ~ `` free speech '' hate . 
  i agree , me too . 
  i consider myself also swedish first hand . 
  european comes 5th . 
  as i said economics is extremely complex . 
  it 's a science about a science about a science . 
  it 's all very abstract and thus far none actually understands it . 
  all economics do is looking at history and see what worked and what does n't . 
  if we actually knew what we are doing we would n't have crashes in the markets or recessions . 
  we would n't even have economic rights or left . 
  to answer your question , banks profits from giving out loans on the interest . 
  you 'll notice you 'll receive less interest for placing your money in the bank than borrowing . 
  so essentially they borrow your money at 0.5 % interest or whatever it is at currently , and then lend for 3 % or whatever the rates are . 
  that 's just the idea of a bank in simple terms though , they do more advanced stuff such as stockmarkets , if i 'm not mistaking they also do outsourced jobs for governments ( printing money ) . 
  however investmentbanks usually deal with stockmarkets more than regular ones . 
  if this was a realistic scenario , the interest rate would be at around 100 % . 
  they profit off your interest and when you ca n't pay them . 
  they look for the ackumulative interest profits rather than one where you just pay off your loan , which is difficult to do . 
  in reality we might have 2 % inflation and 3 % interest where they actually make money off that 1 % because you borrow such huge numbers . 
  you can not pay back the entire sum either so they profit as time passes . 
  as i said it 's kind of complicated so take a look at [ wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bank#business_model ) . 
  banks want to keep the rates low and `` affordable '' so more people will borrow money for more things . 
  people might even borrow money for furniture . 
  the ultimate would be any number above 0 ( perhaps being under 5 % is also good ) .
