  the truth is it actually differs . 
  economics is complicated so while 2 % is good for one country , 5 % might be best for another . 
  let 's make a very simple scenario , the country has in total 100million euro and you make 2500 $ per month . 
  you borrow 1,000 $ from me , you only need to pay me back 1,000 $ ( plus interest ) . 
  if we now make an extreme example and say we had 100 % inflation ( this is usually a big problem but let 's assume it 's not ) . 
  inflation is almost always due to an increase of money available , so now it would be 200million euro instead of 100m , as it increased by 100 % . 
  this means all costs increased by 100 % and so are the salaries . 
  you now earn 5000 $ however it has the same purchasing power as it did before . 
  if a loaf of bread used to cost 50 cents it now costs 1 $ , and because your salary went up by the same amount , you can buy the same amount of loaves as you could 've before . 
  however the strange thing is you only owe me 1,000 $ ( plus interest ) , even though it had the same purchasing power as 2000 $ has now . 
  this makes it easier for you to get out of debt and thus contribute more to society . 
  another way to put it would be saying the debt effectively decreases . 
   lower taxes and let the market fix it ? 
  problem is that the market is skewed as i have mentioned in my other posts . 
  so the market does n't build rental apartments . 
  because it 's not profitable . 
  ohh yeah right . 
  i can not see how alliansen are going to be reelected because of this fiasco . 
  some people probably do n't realize this was happening ... 
  some people vote for the party which gives a few extra hundreds in their wallets . 
   current policies from central bank is to worry about indebtness and not unemployment and inflation like their mandate says . 
  they do this because our current governor is a man who experienced the crisis during the 90s . 
  yeah . 
  they have a goal of 2 % inflation . 
  i started to hear problems when they reported a 0.1 % deflation . 
  some people take these reports as good news because they do n't know the implications of it sadly . 
  i ca n't really blame them for focusing on indebtness , but the fact that they ignore the other problems is kind of annoying . 
   here 's a paper . 
  it cites a few more . 
  i think most are available in swedish too . 
  http://larseosvensson.se/files/papers/leaning-against-the-wind-leads-to-higher-household-debt-to-gdp-ratio.pdf thanks !, 
  i 'll give it a read . 
   it 's also sad how passive the ruling party have been in actually doing something about the indebtness and dramatic rise in housing costs that makes the central bank ignore unemployment . 
  not that i belive the opposition would dare to touch the question of reduced interest rate deductions , property tax and actually building rental flats with a ten foot pole . 
   it 's funny how correct lars e o svensson has been yet was pushed out of the central bank board . 
  what are the current swedish policies ? 
  also what did lars say about the problem ? 
  more than what the article states . 
  some things he says are true , such as  or you need to randomly cross a major road loaded with cars on just get get over to the other side where the path continues . 
  this is n't a major problem . 
  just look around and if a car comes you stop , if it decides to slow down and let you pass you pass . 
  otherwise let them pass and wave your fist . 
   or even more annoyingly you need to ride on the side of that major road yes some people bike on the roads because they either bike too fast for the bike lanes , or the bike lanes do n't go where they want to go . 
   our trains stop working all the time  during the winter , too cold or too snowy and so on . 
  we should start betting on what few days the trains work as they should . 
  sj are incompetent , this one is true for the winter . 
  however most of it is bullshit , such as :  it 's like that in every country , the largest cities are perfectly good but as soon as you step out of that city limit it 's like a `` third-world infrastructure '' . 
  the further you get from the 2-3 largest cities/towns in a country the shittier the infrastructure gets . 
  sweden has good infrastructure . 
  we have municipalities who receive money from the state to improve or maintain infrastructure . 
  some are good some are worse . 
  i have n't seen a terribly bad example yet . 
   ... we still have many shitty roads . 
  our roads are fine . 
  mudslides happen sometimes and then we need to fix them , but that can take a while because you need to see when you can afford it . 
  `` many '' here is less than 0.01 % of all roads . 
   during the summer it 's too warm or too rainy . 
  our biggest problem when it comes to transport are the trians on the winter because they do n't `` prepare '' for the winter or the snow and see it as an excuse not to travel because it 's too risky or the rails have snow on them , or are too icy . 
  sj are compared to donald duck for their incompetence for instance . 
  so yes , trains are a major problem a lot of swedes are upset about , especially those who commute by train . 
  the trains works fine in the summer though ( own experience and lack of newspapers yelling ) . 
  his pictures are of extreme examples and i doubt he can actually find many more because they 're very rare . 
  the roads are n't shitty at all . 
  i 've travelled pretty much everywhere in sweden . 
  the thing is it 's difficult to maintain roads so we fix them when they become bad enough so it causes a problem . 
  usually `` bad '' roads look like [ this ] ( http://sverigesradio.se/diverse/appdata/isidor/images/news_images/427/2232727_520_292.jpg ) or [ this ] ( http://www.teknikensvarld.se/global/scaled/585x2000x2/roxenroot-teknikens_varld-nyheter-090528-vagverket-ansvar-asphaltdamaged0022_1_s.jpg ) . 
  throwing out extreme examples where mudslides happend and the press was all over it because it was n't fixed for a month does n't give a fair view of the roadquality we actually have here compared to pretty much every other country . 
   many roads in sweden look like these and worse . 
  where do you even get that from ? 
   http://www.akerioentreprenad.se/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/%c3%85keri-timmerbil-8-head.jpg  http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_txo2dbahhmc/s9mmcidmuwi/aaaaaaaaaew/qpv57_cxlzi/s1600/img_0957-737454.jpg yes sweden has a lot of dirt roads because asphalt roads are expensive to maintain and dirt roads are all around easier and cheaper to maintain . 
  a normal swedish road looks like [ this ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-znlu0itrsqs/ufrz0l6c-7i/aaaaaaaabsm/pa4fy-hog7s/s1600/101+grusv%c3%a4g+1.jpg ) or [ this ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-o1rjotly1fc/tjpxcvknw-i/aaaaaaaabwq/xvinke56_m0/s1600/sam_9319.jpg ) , and we have tons of them . 
   like i said , the further you get from the 2-3 largest cities the shittier the infrastructure gets . 
  not even true . 
  have you actually been to sweden ? 
  i 've been to the ten biggest cities in sweden and the infrastructure may differ , but they are all of good quality , especially compared to other countries . 
   nah , it 's not a bad analogy . 
  either you 're bad at economics or you do n't know what the euro is . 
  [ please read up . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eurozone_crisis )  the important point is that both allow you to do things you could n't without them no , it only disables the need for currency exchanges . 
   it can be the dangerous speed in a car or too cheap loans with the euro . 
  this has nothing to do with the eurozone crisis . 
  you do n't seem to realize the problems . 
  this is n't ireland we 're talking about . 
  ireland does n't even have a problem with government debt , it has a problem with greedy banks . 
  ireland has enough to sustain their debt , unlike greece , unlike south italy , unlike spain . 
   you mean like the cfa-franc-zone or the east carribean dollar ? 
  smaller radius with the same type of gdp/capita . 
  sure then it works , but the eurozone crisis is because of a globalization problem . 
   to be fair , its per-capita monetary contribution is considerably smaller than the one of sweden or denmark . 
  exactly . 
   there is no convincing case to be made for a connection between eurozone-membership and negative consequences for a country 's economy . 
  you 're way wrong . 
  finland regrets being in the eurozone already . 
  sweden will never join because it would be catastrophic for the swedish economy . 
  the fact is the countries with smaller gdp/capital are n't able to sustain themselves in the eurozone and therefore they go under . 
  they need a currency themselves can devalue . 
  do you honestly believe it 's called `` eurozone crisis '' because the euro is ** not ** at fault ? 
   if you did n't like this analogy , adapt it and claim cars are a death trap because they can be hit by other cars on the road whereas travelling by foot is safe because you can just jump aside . 
  that 's also a bad analogy . 
  overall the eurozone is n't like a car going fast .
