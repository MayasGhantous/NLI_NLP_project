  it 's just a plain bad analogy . 
   the point is that the inability to devalue is one of its important features , not some side-effect . 
  important features ? 
  not being able to devalue a currency is bad . 
  in a recession you 'll have a tougher time getting up for instance . 
  the inability to devalue the currency was a reason why it was faught against . 
  why do you think other countries have n't got a similar eurozone ? 
  because in reality it 's bad . 
  look at how gb opted out for instance , same with sweden . 
  norway does n't even wan na get into eu because then it would be just giving away billions per year and get in return bad laws which says they ca n't do snuff anymore . 
  it 's ridiculously bad for carrying countries . 
  the only reason why germany accepts the deal is because they actually profit off greece/italy/spains debts more than they lose . 
   the point of the euro is , however , to create an economic bloc strong enough to be a backbone for a european presence in an increasingly multi-polar world . 
  this wo n't be effective unless every country shares the same policies . 
   thus , one could perhaps argue that the fault was not to have the right stick or other carrots or whatever next to the euro-carrot . 
  the latter is still not at fault , the problem is the missing means to handle asymmetric shocks . 
  it would be more constructive to argue for fixing this mistake . 
  i do n't see your point here . 
  euro is like a big bloc here . 
  saying you want to tear the bloc appart and still keep it intact is silly . 
  besides we can still handle asymmetric shock by having own currencies . 
   saying the euro is at fault for the crisis because it ca n't be devalued is like saying cars are responsible for accidents because they are so fast . 
  not a good analogy because euro is n't responsible for the crash , it 's responsible for not being able to fix it as smoothly as other currencies . 
  crashes are difficult to predict and it 's always easy to be smart in hindsight . 
  therefore a better option is to have a system so you can easily repair the damages . 
   the fixed value across the eurozone is the feature that allows cross-country supply chains to be created , just like the speed of the car makes it a great means of transport . 
  still not a good analogy . 
   the blame lies with the national governments that did n't adapt their policies to the changing circumstances , be it by being responsible in their own nations or by giving the eu the proper authority to regulate the eurozone to counter such crises . 
  governments and banks are selfish . 
  you ca n't give them a carrot and then be surprised they take it . 
  obviously in a democracy the will of the people usually goes , and in the case of greece , the will of the people was to ignore the debt . 
  still , the problem was that greece could not repair its debt , which they could 've if they had their own currency . 
  to be realistic the eurozone is a bad idea because there will always be carriers . 
  in the end germany for instance do n't want to spend billions trying to stabilize greece because they are too lazy to do it themselves . 
  in simple terms , if they had drachma , the crisis would n't be as big as it is today because then greece would go under themselves and then they have to fix it themselves . 
   i fail to see the argument that explains why the euro is at fault . 
  you ca n't devalue it . 
  eurozone made an exception for greece because they thought greece would straighten themselves and work for their membership but the opposite happend . 
  if greece still had drachma they could just devalue it and voala , problem solved . 
  you basically chain yourself together with a common currency like the euro , however spaning the euro too far often leads to implications because of culture and so on . 
   these countries knew they did n't have the ability to devalue any more . 
  greece counts on other countries to help them out , but they basically do nothing themselves . 
  they had the opportunity to make life a little easier by just owning one house etc but they opted out , and thus comes the consequences . 
   if they continued policies that would lead to them having to devalue at some , it is their fault . 
  it is greece 's fault because they 're in debt with a tough return yes . 
   the boundary conditions imposed by the common currency did n't sneak up on anyone and were not a bug but a feature . 
  people assumed greece would take responsibility for their mistakes but no . 
  as i said earlier greece was an exception for the eurozone . 
  a bad one at that which really makes you question the economic brainiacs making the decision . 
  it 's easy to be smart in hindsight . 
  obviously a simple mistake people make is that people are willing to lose money to greece . 
  the thing is , more money is to be made by giving greece bad conditions for loaning . 
  furthermore it 's greeces fault they made bad investments . 
  most greeks had several real estates and they retired earlier than most other countries . 
  also / u/bowgentle is responding to the irish crisis , which is n't as big as the greek . 
  irish crisis is about the real estate bubble and how banks take advantage of it . 
  in the irish crisis the banks are at fault for being greedy , in the greek crisis , the governement is at fault . 
  in any case , having your own currency allows you to devalue it , unlike a common currency like euro . 
  this means in practice that you can sell resources at a lower cost and therefore export more . 
  there is a reason why we have three different kinds of kronor in scandinavia . 
  so in summary , yes the euro is at fault for not being able to deal with the problem . 
  the people are at fault for creating the problem . 
  think of it as chaining yourselves together . 
  if one falls off the cliff , you 're all doomed . 
  i think none who understands economics would want euro now , well ... except the countries falling off the cliff . 
   the euro why ... ?

   no , ** we ** are not . 
  come again ? 
  it 's free , dental care is n't . 
  it 's the same thing with [ these ] ( http://www.sydsvenskan.se/images2/2013/2/10/00252872.jpg ) over here in sweden . 
  people automatically assume it 's racist because usa had some problems , but sweden = / = usa and two different cultures develop different things and meanings . 
  because they do n't know what 's best for themselvs and any choice to go back to their litterally hell former country must be brainwashing or fear from nazis . 
  no , my point is if slovaks and czechs were so similiar , it would be weird if czechoslovaks split from one another . 
  slovakia and the czech republic are different enough to be split . 
  imagine how it is for countries where there are 2 big cultures ? 
  everyone has cultural minorities , and they 're called cultural minorities because they are very small . 
  those does n't really count . 
  sweden has a cultural minority of arabs , but we do n't consider it swedish to be halal and pray . 
  to the most parts it is . 
  a lot of european countries are . 
  why do you think the czech and slovakia split ? 
  mono = one . 
  he 's saying that the czech republic is a single culture country . 
   what was you statement ? 
  that muslims burn down churches ? 
  that was n't my statement , [ but since we 're at it . 
  ] ( http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/2015/april/muslims-burn-69-churches-christians-forgive/ )  people are very religious and there is pressure in society to show it . 
  even the extreme sides of christianity are dull compared to islamic sides . 
  there are no states which are built on christanity that still conserves the values and are letter interpreted . 
  there 's a massive difference in the bible , torah and qu ` ran . 
  the qu ` ran is litterally the last word of god , whatever it says goes , unlike torah and the bible . 
  the abrahamic religions are also the most violent religions there are . 
  other religions usually focus on way of life of individuals and thus do n't include things like killings or stupid pushments . 
  i lie ? 
  in what way is your statement even remotely factually based ? 
  you 're trying to discredit me by saying that i have no experience with these issues and then when i claim i do you just call it a lie without knowing anything . 
  all around stupidity from your side , it 's hilarious but at the same time alarming . 
  so your comment is irrelevant to my statement , am i right ?
