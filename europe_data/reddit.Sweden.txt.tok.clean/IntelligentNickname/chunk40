  also , if you do not have any knowledge of the swedish society , then perhaps you should n't say `` germany is not that very different from sweden i would wager . 
  '' , because it 's just a guess from your part . 
  sweden does not have poverty as other countries have poverty . 
  sweden has a very high safety net and has the world 's highest taxes which enables this . 
  sweden has a high safety net for its citizens , that 's the whole point in having the highest taxes in the world . 
  we do not have `` poor people '' as for instance the us has `` poor people '' . 
  usually the poor people in sweden has some sort of diagnosis , such as depression , alcoholism , drug addiction etc which enables them to not seek help or not get the financial support they need ( since they use their money for example drugs ) . 
   before anyone wants to blame it on immigration , copenhagen has a very high amount of immigrants and the highest in the entire country . 
  what 's your point ? 
  immigrants are still highly overrepresented in for instance violent crimes . 
   that 's huuuuge amount . 
  finnish budget is around ** 55 billion ** euros . 
  do n't you mean million ? 
  the politics behind the electricity production is not what is discussed here . 
  the fact is that around 45 % of sweden 's electricity is produced by hydropower . 
  also what you just said makes no sense . 
  it 's called stupidity . 
  nuclear is n't the only thing they 're opposing . 
  i just want to point out that the way they 're currently trying to do this is basically raise taxes for everything that pollutes , such as trucks , fuel etc. 
  they are n't actually trying to make anything greener , just raising taxes so it 'll become more expensive for everyone . 
  [ your source is wrong ... ] ( http://www.svenskenergi.se/elfakta/elproduktion/ ) sweden has always produced about the same amount of nuclear power as hydro power . 
  trying to be very green myself it 's super annoying . 
  the green party does n't represent a greener planet at all , they 're just a cult who uses the party for their own ideology . 
  counting just electricity production , hydro power and nuclear power both do about 45 % of the country 's production . 
  so those combined is 90 % . 
  nuclear power is good , however if you 're going to include nuclear energy as `` one of the primary '' sources of energy , you need to also include hydro power . 
  the green party wants to close everything nuclear for some stupid `` i * feel * that it 's unsafe '' bullshit reason . 
   my bad on the title , it should be `` $ 1b '' as in 1 billion dollars . 
  bummer . 
  otherwise i 'd definitely order like a thousand of those . 
   happened with aftonbladet are you sure it was n't expressen ? 
  maybe they both did it . 
   no one actually likes you 're exaggerating . 
  for one they 're used in local schools for teaching about arts and history and for two they 're appreciated for those who spend time there since everything is n't the same dull landscape . 
   like overly expensive modernist statues to decorate parks no one actually visits because of their terrible location while i agree unnecessary spending is silly , and your wording could be misinterpreted , i think statues and other culturally signiciant monuments should stay . 
  arts and crafts should not be underestimated , they 're quite important . 
   nothing substantial . 
   they announced that they wo n't be granting permanent residence permits to new asylum seekers , rather now only temporary 3-year permits . 
  this is substantial ... especially going from `` permanent residencies '' to temporary ones . 
   apply for both eu-monetary support the irony is that a lot of parliamentarians said that `` sweden is very rich , we can afford to share our wealth '' and `` sweden is very big , we have space for a lot of people '' . 
   read the article . 
  it 's swedish christians . 
  no , one victim was due to swedish christians . 
  there are very few practicing christians in sweden . 
  there 's a high probability it 's still foreign culture . 
  keep in mind that media usually does n't difference the nationality of being swedish and the ethnicity of being swedish , therefore causing confusion . 
  religion is dumb . 
  keep in mind that there are very few practicing extremist like these people in sweden . 
  it 's generally frowned upon by most swedes . 
  i did n't mention any knife attack . 
  i assumed people would open the article and read `` ikea murders '' the first thing they did . 
  it 's a simple mistake and the mods added a flair . 
  i do n't see the problem , what do you mean the problem is ? 
  how so ? 
  the article was published yesterday . 
   dubbelmordet var en h\u00e4mnd i would say those things also has a lot to do with it . 
  this article was published yesterday and i saw it on / r/sweden . 
  i 'm not misleading , i just forgot to include `` ikea '' in the title . 
  my title does n't represent the full content of the article . 
  would there be a difference if today 's terrorist would 've targeted swedish people instead of the ikea murderer ? 
  the reason why the murderer killed the two seemingly random people is being brought to light . 
  right , my bad . 
  i ca n't do anything now though , the mods have to put a flair . 
  [ google translation . 
  ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=sv&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=sv&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fvlt.se%2fikeamorden%2f1.3213362-mordarens-val-av-offer-de-sag-svenska-ut-&amp;edit-text= ), 
  the thing is , there are a lot of `` non-democracies '' where the demoractic process is flawed . 
  syria is probably one of the worst cases but you ca n't tell people , from anywhere that `` wait for the next election '' is the best thing to do when they feel strongly about something . 
  people felt that the politicans did n't hear them out during the last election . 
  the politicians in sweden are doing very stupid things that probably a majority of the population would n't vote for if they were honest with their intentions . 
  saying that people should `` roll their thumbs '' is quite frankly insulting towards those people who are actually hurting by these deicisions . 
  so you 're saying it 's only ok to have civil unrest in countries without a democracy ? 
  they have elections in syria , so my point still stands . 
  you do n't get civil unrest do you ? 
  would you tell the syrians to `` go wait for the next elections '' ? 
  since the fire attacks never attacked anyone and those doing it believes that society has turned to shit with things like [ the ikea murders ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_ikea_murders ) and [ entitled refugees . 
   if everyone were like them - `` i ca n't get my way , therefore i shall attack people '' - society would turn to shit pretty rapidly . 
  so ... you agree with the people burning down the houses ? 
   burning down a building build with their own tax contributions ; which very well could be turned into something else . 
  do you think the radical left/right care ? 
   now the refugees will be housed somewhere else , likely in much less adequate housing and areas . 
  actually we 've kind of run out of space so badly that we 're building temporary tents , housing refugees in luxurious spas and even cruises . 
  you 're forgetting that people in regeringen are comparing people fighting for is to people who defended finland . 
  are we trusting those type of people to come up with sufficient laws to prevent the support for things like isis ? 
   are you sure that it 's armored ? 
  yes . 
  the way you put it makes it seem that you know better than / u/edmon-dantes when it comes to meaning of english words and sentences . 
  you also must remember that these are writers , they know what they write and do it in a specific purpose to get a message across . 
  not many things are random or left to chance . 
  by his logic it 's impossible to move once you 're on a plane . 
  it 's hilarious . 
  words have meaning . 
  bbc know what they write and what picture they try to portray . 
  no media is completely neutral . 
   police car luckily it was an armoured van . 
   because i 'm a human and i care about other humans doing well . 
  if i were in this position , i would want to be treated well too . 
  you do n't think . 
  it 's obvious that there are only a few percent of the refugees who come here . 
  we have to cut the aid to the countries in favour of taking in a couple of thousands here . 
  * we help fewer people and it costs way more * .
