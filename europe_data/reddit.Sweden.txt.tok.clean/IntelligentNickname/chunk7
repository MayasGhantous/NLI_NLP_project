  we do n't know what this `` deport '' thing is . 
   and swedish media are just a reflection of the swedish society . 
  good one . 
  that 's not even close to the truth . 
  you 're lacking malta which has a higher percentage than sweden , but that 's because they 're a lot smaller than sweden . 
   that 's now what that says . 
  ** now ** or ** not ** ? 
  what does n't make any sense is that she is `` strongly against '' my first comment but advocates the second comment and calling it `` anti-racism '' . 
  very few media outlets has brought up her speech , and meanwhile almost all of them brought up that a sd politican `` lied '' about his criminal past . 
   is that satire ? 
  if so , aimed towards what ? 
  yes , the satire just replaced where she said `` man '' with `` jew '' and it instantly becomes haunting . 
  the actual quote is  in sweden today , 2014 , are men still heavily overly represented in all areas with power and money . 
  meanwhile women in sweden earn 3,6 milljon sek less than the average man during a lifetime . 
   ** and one suspects that when it mostly is white , heterosexual , middle-aged men who have the power , then there is a risk that the society is built from the norm of white , heterosexual , middle-aged men , and that is wrong . 
  because most of us are actually not white , heterosexual , middle-aged men but humans , you know those who have equal worth but are different in many ways . 
  ** and this is n't satire at all . 
  she was dead serious [ when she said this . 
  ] ( http://www.svtplay.se/video/2140384/partiledartal-i-almedalen/partiledartal-asa-romson-mp ) the second line quote is at around 3:35 ( in swedish of course ) . 
   jesus christ , who and when ? 
  \u00c5sa romson , i actually cited the satire one where you replace the word `` male '' with `` jew '' . 
  the actual one says this :  in sweden today , 2014 , are men still heavily overly represented in all areas with power and money . 
  meanwhile women in sweden earn 3,6 milljon sek less than the average man during a lifetime . 
   ** and one suspects that when it mostly is white , heterosexual , middle-aged men who have the power , then there is a risk that the society is built from the norm of white , heterosexual , middle-aged men , and that is wrong .

  ** since you have a swedish flair i 'll link to the [ post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/sweden/comments/29xrbq/%c3%a4r_du_man_eller_m%c3%a4nniska/ ) in / r/sweden . 
  in related news , a green party politican said this during a speech in a big politics conference . 
   in sweden today , 2014 , are jews still heavily overly represented in all areas with power and money . 
  meanwhile swedes in sweden earn 3,6 milljon sek less than the average jew during a lifetime . 
   and one suspects that when it mostly is white , heterosexual , middle-aged jews who have the power , then there is a risk that the society is built from the norm of white , heterosexual , middle-aged jews , and that is wrong .

  perhaps we are racists after all ... 
   it was also menthol cigarettes and all other things they put in cigarettes to make them taste better and nicotine products to make it taste better . 
  it 's to try and prevent people from starting to smoke . 
  sure i can buy that , if it was n't because of the fact that snuff is not smoking . 
  they blend laws into eachother and ban unnecessary products . 
  if they just banned dangerous cigarette products it would be okay , but they never banned cigarettes but just snuff which makes it suspicious . 
  the thing is we could get all of the good things , we should n't have to compromise . 
  what 's the reason for the eu telling sweden that we ca n't have snuff ? 
  no reason , just corruption . 
   what is it that you think are annoying about the eu ? 
  well i 'm all for free market , a united currency and free movement . 
  trade agreements are usually a good thing however its easy for companies to involve themselves to make ridiculous laws for their benefit ( acta etc ) . 
  speaking of ridiculous laws . 
  eu has decided to puppet states like sweden with laws saying `` you can not have a bus station closer than 50m from an airport '' for instance ( not an actual law , but you get the idea ) . 
  while one or two is n't a problem we see hundred if not thousands of these laws which makes it difficult for airports to operate . 
  they must spend a lot of money redoing the airport or bus station and adds extra costs and worrying where there should be none . 
  i can see how this law is good in for the poorer countries where the bus station could cause a problem , but sweden has plenty of nets to make it all secure . 
  if you want a real example of a law , it is that sweden can not have snuff anymore . 
  sweden loves their snuff and why should eu tell sweden that snuff is bad but cigarettes are okay ? 
  sweden has their snuff now as eu has made an exception , but they constantly bug sweden to remove it and its most likely because of lobbying from cigarette companies . 
  speaking of lobbying , the eu is incredibly corrupt compared to denmark and sweden . 
  special laws benefiting companies are made all the time and a lot of the meps are constantly voting in stuff they have no clue what it is . 
  sweden loses a lot of money , and then i mean a lot . 
  we lose about 2bn euro per year on being a eu member , and for what ? 
  bad laws , eu puppetting sweden and telling them they ca n't have snuff and their own laws on the matter are bad ? 
  telling sweden that airports can not be closer than 50m from a bus station ? 
  bringing in more and more corruption and bending more to corporate laws ? 
  i believe eu could work as an economic union , but as of now , it has too many flaws . 
  this is incredibly irresponsible . 
  i would 've thought swedish economists would 've studied this a little further but looking at [ stefan 's expression ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/image/i3vjnn35fmxc.jpg ) it seems like he 's just taking a swing at what 's good . 
   the eu is one of the best things to ever happen to denmark . 
  i think you focus on a few bad things , and forget to look at all the benefits the eu brings with it . 
  please elaborate , what are the good things eu brings and what are the benefits ? 
   we 're already neck deep in the eu . 
  we might as well take the full leap and get more political influence . 
  in a pool of ice . 
  there is nothing saying that you ca n't return or opt out even more . 
  saying `` well we 're half-way in , too late to turn back '' is ridiculous . 
  sweden lose massively on eu and the little we do get back does n't make up for any of it . 
  even if we had double the influence it would n't matter . 
  it 's a big loss for the nordic countries however you look at it . 
   there 's way too many euro sceptics in this country . 
  and for good reason . 
  countries need the same fiscal policies to make the euro work . 
  that 's the idea . 
  alcohol worsen your driving a lot so naturally you should n't be allowed to drive and cause accidents . 
  if you want to go out then you use : public transport , taxi or friends . 
  aaaaaaaand you 're cut off . 
   if he commits a robbery here he will serve his sentence in sweden ( he does not need to throw away his id ) and when his sentence is up they will send him back to his country . 
  he could claim that he fears going back . 
  he would definitely serve the sentince in sweden and then try to be deported but wether he 'll actually be deported is another issue . 
  i take it you understand which case i am refering to . 
   i doubt throwing away his id will work for an american , i 'm pretty sure that they will be able to find put his identity since he is from a developed country . 
  probably , but he could still claim some bullshit about usa being inhumane and going to kill him . 
  they are n't citizens then , and surely should n't be up to norway to take care of but instead their own country . 
  really ? 
  well ... 
  i should move to norway ... 
  being norwegian is n't easy . 
   norway  sweden [ interesting . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmrynddqipm#t=63 ), 
   but anyway , i 'd not think norway is paradise if i was a beggar as it will soon be forbidden to beg . 
  norway has plenty of social security nets to prevent street poverty . 
   i 'd also not think it 's a paradise if i liked warm weather . 
  win some lose some . 
   the import tariffs on food , ** lack of exciting food scene ** etc ( this is true for sweden as well ) simply makes norway quite boring for me . 
  eat laks . 
   in conclusion there is no paradise . 
  * shrug *,
