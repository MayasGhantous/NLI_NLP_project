i not only did i do that ; i also forgot about slovenia . 
  apologies for that . 
  i 've remedied this by adding a surprisingly relevant slovenian band . 
  til the name of that song , and that it is romanian . 
  i was n't even aware that there * is * a greek metal scene until last night . 
  [ this ] ( http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--qow8koa5--/japbcvpavbzau9dbuaxf.jpg ) was basically how i did the southeastern parts of europe . 
  thanks for the tips though . 
  i really liked rotting christ !, 
   checks his metal playlist   * rammstein - engel [ 10 ]  * opeth - demon of the fall [ 11 ]  * erm , that 's about it .

  sorry if i misrepresented your country , managed to dig up your local nazi band , or just generally fucked up in some way . 
  ** edit : ** forgot about slovenia , added slovakia twice . 
  fixed . 
  it 's essentially a combination of high building standards , rent control , and builders wanting to recoup their expenses as soon as possible by selling rather than renting . 
  it 's pretty much a textbook plan for a housing crisis . 
  the obvious solution is for the government to build rental apartments and handle them through their own agency , but for some reason that seems impossible . 
  most cities used to have extensive council owned rental buildings , but these were sold off for short term profits during the last couple of decades . 
  turns out that was maybe a dumb move . 
  who ` da thunk it ? 
  in theory , yes . 
  in practice , it rarely happened . 
  you had to fork out at least 10 % of the sum to get a base loan . 
  you could get what 's called a `` top loan '' for the rest , but those were * really * expensive and had mandatory payments . 
  nowadays you need to put 20-25 % down , no clue about top loans ( doubt they 're around with all the bad press after the us bubble ) . 
  i honestly have no idea . 
  i thought it was still in effect . 
  swedish apartments come in two flavors : * bostadsr\u00e4tt * , which means that you buy a stake in a co-op , and * hyresr\u00e4tt * , which means that you rent . 
  the first case is basically just a matter of being able to fork over the money and pay the ( often fairly low ) monthly fee . 
  there are tons of these available , and the market is booming . 
  buying one in stockholm is considered an investement , as long as the housing bubble does n't burst . 
  the second type is a traditional rental . 
  these are rent controlled ( even the privately owned ones ) . 
  in fact , renting your bostadsr\u00e4tt second-hand as a hyresr\u00e4tt is also subject to rent controls , and it is possible for a tenant who feels that they 've been wrongly treated to get a partial refund if they lodge a formal complaint and the landlord is found to have been overcharging . 
  selling rental contracts , although illegal , is fairly common . 
  this means that new construction is almost exclusively in the form of bostadsr\u00e4tt apartments . 
  simply put , the builders recoup their money faster if they sell the apartments if they sell them , which is very useful for them . 
  iirc there have been some government mandates that you must construct x rental apartments for every y bostadsr\u00e4tt apartments etc , but the ratio is very low since we do n't want the builders to go build somewhere else ( thus causing even more problems ) . 
  the obvious solution would be to remove the rent control , but that would likely disadvantage the people who are n't rich - and that makes it politically difficult ( i.e. 
  career suicide ) . 
  less advantaged people are already largely relegated to the suburbs and longer commutes ( unless they already have an apartment in the city ) and the city is largely populated by well-to-do people . 
  do note , though , that even young professionals ( making $ 3-4k / mo ) will struggle to actually afford an apartment in the city . 
  a one-room apartment ( room , bedroom , kitchen , bathroom ) will set you back about $ 500k in some of the more attractive areas of the city , and while this is doable for a lot of people with the current interest rates ( ~ 1.5 % ) it * will * become a problem once the interest rates start climbing . 
  so if you had unlimited money you could just buy something , but finding a rental could prove very difficult . 
  like i said , it 's a complete and utter clusterfuck . 
  note that this is written from a stockholm perspective , and that apartments and houses are * a lot * cheaper if you live in smaller cities or in the country . 
  but then you also have to find a job there etc. 
  rentals in sweden are often assigned using a queue system . 
  the more days you have , the better your options . 
  in larger cities , for example stockholm , you 'll likely need at least a few years to get a first hand rental , and subletting is extremely common . 
  there 's a shortage of small and affordable apartments , and it had been that way for over a decade . 
  the rental situation is a complete and utter clusterfuck . 
  unfortunately buying is not an option for most young people , since apartments ( even studios ) in stockholm etc are likely to set your back about $ 100k unless your can live with a 1h + commute each way . 
  if you want something in the city in stockholm , prices basically start at $ 250k . 
  they 're all over stockholm , so that 's not much of a treat . 
  the place next to max actually has less shitty burgers , but they 're twice as expensive : /, 
  arlanda is my local airport , and thanks to the eternal construction i still get lost when i try to drive there . 
  and you 're completely right about it being filled with overpriced , shitty , stores . 
  who the hell buys `` gourmet liquorice '' in a god damn airport ?!, 
  also , parking at the drop off zone is like $ 5 for 30 minutes , with a minimum payment of $ 5 so even the damn parking fee is ridiculously overpriced . 
  in 2013 i flew via frankfurt 5 times , and three of those times my bag got lost . 
  the eternal bus rides and walks did nothing to make my stays more enjoyable . 
  also , there 's like one restaurant in the shengen terminal that serves something other than breakfast food , and it does n't have wifi coverage . 
  fiumicino is the only airport where i 've seen mosquitoes in a bathroom . 
  i think that speaks for itself . 
  russia is running [ simulated bombing runs on sweden ] ( http://www.svt.se/nyheter/ff ) , and has tried to scare off our signal intelligence aircraft . 
  that 's a bit more aggressive in my book . 
  according to the ministry of foreign affairs russia is more aggressive and do not admit that they violate our territory , as per the article you linked . 
  this makes it seem like they 're actively provoking us , whereas the us is just negligent . 
  if you 're going to quote that article , you should also make it clear that the russian violations of swedish territories are of a different caliber than most of the others . 
  translation :  -- it 's a different type of behavior from the russian side , a employee at the ministry for foreign affairs told dn . 
    russian aircraft often fly straight towards sweden and turn away at the last moment , or do maneuvers close to the swedish border . 
  as opposed to other countries , russia does not admit the violations of sovereign territories . 
  the article also notes that russian aircraft will fly with their transponders off ( forcing civilian aircraft to take evasive action to avoid collisions ) . 
  now the americans are also being dicks , but mostly because it would be inconvenient for them to not be . 
  the behavior seems less malicious , but we should probably send a strongly worded letter or something . 
  most of the other violations are fuckups . 
  norwegians forgot that the exercise was over , monaco had their regent on board , most of the others seem to be failures of navigation . 
  that happens with our aircraft as well , and is pretty much par for the ocurse . 
  by your reasoning , the us is less safe than syria or iraq , since camden exists . 
  that would be because it is exaggerated to the point that it is utter fucking toss . 
  there are problems , and all the things you have mentioned have occurred . 
  this does not mean that this occurs every time the police show up in those particular areas , or that they have lost the ability to exert influence in those areas . 
  the use of the phrase `` no-go zones '' is a complete and utter misnomer , and the term used in the report is a cognate of `` areas of special concern '' . 
  the report states that the existence of gangs and whatnot are detrimental to police work , which should not come as a surprise to anyone with enough neurons to form a fucking synapse . 
  it does not use the words `` lose control '' or anything to that effect . 
  i 'm swedish and have lived in kista , which is immediately adjacent to husby and sollentuna , for over a damn decade . 
  if anything , things are improving here . 
  to anyone who lives here the notion that all of sollentuna is a no-go zone is patently ridiculous . 
  sollentuna , edsberg , and the like are chock full of $ 500k + houses . 
  hell , a 36sqm studio apartment in kista will set you back about $ 200k nowadays . 
  statistically you 'd be safer here than pretty much anywhere in portugal .
