  the overwhelming majority of voters in any country are economically illiterate . 
  combine that with the anti-intellectualism of the age that we live in and you end up in a very precarious situation . 
  voters do n't know what currency devaluation actually means and anyone capable of explaining the consequences of it to them will be dismissed as a `` smug elitist '' . 
  if le pen wins the french elections liberal democracy is dead . 
  yes , what kind of silly country would have something like that ?!, 
  the frozen food sold in scandinavian countries is of a much higher quality than that generally found elsewhere . 
  we 're absolutely obsessed with the quality and `` healthiness '' of food and the producers ' offerings reflect that . 
  the soviet plans for a [ northern river reversal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_river_reversal ) was a similar proposed mega-project . 
   cash you have sitting around is n't taxed . 
  unless you have a [ wealth tax ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wealth_tax ) . 
  fuck , the pope visit has me all confused :(, 
  pope francis is in sweden today to attend a church service hosted by the church of sweden and lutheran world federation in memory of the events , the culmination of 50 years of negotiations !, 
  supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses , not from some farcical aquatic ceremony !, 
  the swedish royal used to be titled as `` king of the swedes , geats and wends '' until the current king carl xvi gustaf changed the title to `` king of sweden '' upon his accession to the throne in 1973 . 
  you must be blind then , seeing as europe is covered with ugly plattenbaus that are essentially nothing but grey concrete slabs in varying states of decay . 
  the fact that it is both clean and actually has colour automatically disqualifies this building from any `` ugliest building ever '' contest . 
  a vocal group of people do , but far from `` everyone '' . 
  if everyone truly hated modern and post-modern architecture they would n't be the dominant architectural styles of our time . 
  unprofitable businesses do n't usually close suddenly overnight . 
  if you 're thinking about `` german history enthusiasts '' , then you 're thinking about the same thing as me . 
  i thought the `` meme '' against belgium was calling it a fake country or calling for it to be split . 
  clearly a compromise between ad and ce , intended to offend both the religious folk and the science types equally !, 
   how do you meet women in sweden ? 
  by consuming large quantities of alcohol . 
   would they call the police if you 'd start hitting on them at the bus stop ? 
  they would n't call the police , but they 'd think you 're a creep and possibly crazy . 
  talking to people on public transport is a major cultural faux pas . 
  the people who actually wrote the text are not the ones who picked the pictures . 
   i 'd told him multiple times to go elsewhere , but he 's still here . 
  the places where he 'd truly get paid would all come with a big culture shock , regardless of if it was northern europe or north america . 
  i totally get why someone from spain would stay at home , even if he gets robbed by his employer . 
  the decepticons kind of are immigrant terrorists , being from outer space and all . 
  it 's a country with the population of a medium-sized city , which means that the problems of national politics there are merged with the weirdness of local politics . 
  aside from the people playing . 
  yes . 
  because the world championships take place at the same time as the nhl playoffs only european-based players and players from nhl clubs already knocked out of the playoffs take part in the world championship , while the olympics feature all the top players in the world , including nhl players , at least for now . 
   so the olympics is more important than the world cup in hockey ? 
  yes . 
  this is only the third time the `` world cup '' has been held , the last one was 12 years ago , the one before that 20 years ago . 
  well , hockey is n't football . 
  the olympic tournament is the biggest and most prestigious event in the sport . 
  the `` world cup '' is a glorified exhibition event the nhl puts on at irregular intervals whenever they feel like separating foolish canadians from their money . 
  it 's an under-23 team . 
   here in sweden we spent way too much time on ancient greece and rome and way too little on the world wars for example . 
  that 's a priority your school/teacher has made , not something determined by the national curriculum . 
   hence , demographic replacement is not an unthinkable scenario on a long enough time scale . 
  over a long enough time scale immigrants eventually assimilate into the dominant culture . 
  i 've been told by an acquaintance who used to work at the volvo factory here in gothenburg ( where many people with roots in former yugoslavia work ) that the `` balkan '' solution to that is to take a loose buckle and stick it into the fastener . 
  and yes , that one time i put a grocery bag that was slightly too heavy in the passenger seat the constant beeping was absolutely unbearable . 
  mass conversion to lutheranism would work . 
   are there really some people out there that get gas-attack ptsd when they get a whiff of smoke ? 
  people with diminished respiratory function certainly can . 
  i can personally attest to that as i 've had pharyngitis over the weekend , the traces of my neighbours ' smoke blowing in through my window was enough to give me a serious coughing attack . 
  being around smokers must be absolutely unbearable for people with chronic respiratory problems . 
   if he wins this time , hofer would become europe 's first far-right head of state since 1945 after losing by just 31,000 votes in may . 
  til spain and portugal are n't in europe !, 
  the more you know !, 
  the [ `` record years '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/record_years ) coinciding with the [ million programme ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/million_programme ) meant there was a big boom in construction of both private single-family homes as well as rental housing in the 1950-70 time period . 
  the joy of being at the louvre when it is closed to the public . 
  and there 's clearly far more than 23 areas marked out in this map , so they obviously are n't municipalities then . 
  that 's a lot of municipalities for such a small country . 
   the overwhelming majority of european deaths to terrorism during those times were from pira and eta activities i 'd like it if you actually proved that , since i have a hard time believing it seeing as the two deadliest attacks , bologna and lockerbie , were carried out by other groups . 
  as i said before , there were * a lot * of groups active in europe at the time , from left-wing groups like the raf to the neo-fascists that were behind bologna , to arab socialists like the plo and their supporters and both shia and sunni islamists and even state actors like with lockerbie . 
  i ca n't help but sense your focus on eta and the ira is built on your gut-feeling more than facts . 
   with the difference of course that neither ( p ) ira nor eta ever had the strategy of causing as many civilian casualties as possible . 
  there were more groups active in the 70s and 80s who did n't care though . 
  the people behind the [ bologna massacre ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bologna_massacre ) were just as indiscriminate as the paris attackers . 
   edit : fascinating that this comment is now ` controversial ' . 
  i do n't exactly see where i said anything even remotely untrue here ... 
  it 's because you 're passing off all the political violence of the 70 's and 80 's as exclusively the fault of eta and the ira when in reality there was a whole host of factions of various ideologies carrying out attacks all over europe during the time period ( including islamists ) , your post can also be interpreted as apologist towards eta and the ira . 
  budapest competes with prague for the title of `` porn capital of europe '' . 
  basically there 's lots of hungarian and czech porn actresses because that 's where the studios are , same thing with california in the us . 
  typical german , ruining the joke !, 
  there 's a whole series of scandinavian jokes based on german false friends , some examples ; * a man sits down in a german caf\u00e9 and asks for `` ein kopf kaffe '' * a man is driving on the autobahn when the wheel of his car starts to fall off , so he stops by the side of the road and gets out of the car . 
  a policeman comes and asks what 's wrong and the man answers `` das mutter ist los ! '', 
  * a man on a bicycle gets a flat tire , another man comes by and asks the man what 's wrong and the man answers `` die slange ist kaputt ! '', 
  `` theresa may refuses to carry out campaign promises she never made '', 
  a local election being used to make a point about national politics does not paint a very flattering view of the voters . 
   transportation costs ( to usa ) the nissan factories in europe build cars almost exclusively for the european market . 
  cars for the us market are either built in the us itself or in japan . 
  or follow european manufacturers like vw and fiat by moving production to eastern countries like poland or slovakia where the wages are lower . 
   i 'm assuming they are ordinary humans and will find someone to blame apart from themselves . 
  of this we can be certain . 
  should the nissan plant close the majority of locals will blame `` globalism '' / brussels/westminster / `` them sneaky japanese '' and all the other usual scapegoats , not themselves and their neighbours . 
  when the russian comes , he wo n't be coming through the desert . 
   aaaaaaaaaaaaand now i 'm hungry . 
  :( time to go visit grandma again !, 
   any idea what might work better ? 
  buying the sun and make it print lies that are more in your favour . 
  they actually seem half decent for a red-top tabloid . 
  i doubt you 'd ever see a [ front page like this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/daily_mirror#/media/file:the_daily_mirror_-_sorry_we_were_hoaxed.jpg ) from the sun . 
  i think the more important factor in this case though is that they are a paper very strongly aligned with the labour party . 
  this is reddit , nobody ever reads more than just the headline . 
   before they inherit their places [ eton is n't an old boys ' club any more .

   the drug , hidden in bags among a delivery of orange juice concentrate , arrived in a container from south america . 
  sounds like someone in colombia put his coke in the wrong container . 
  cheap , plain tomato sauce tastes like ass and wo n't last nearly as long as a bottle of ketchup . 
  for the thrifty student a 1 kg bottle of heinz bought for 20 kr while on sale will last * months * . 
  a lot of clothing is actually made in europe in countries like spain and portugal , even cheap brands .
