  wiki says red sauce is just ketchup ? 
   but that 's a big decline from 2005 when it was 80 % in favour . 
  i 'd say it has only returned back to normal rather than having faced a real decline . 
  the monarchy was experiencing a huge bump in popularity in 2005 because of how the king responded to the indian ocean tsunami in december 2004 . 
  50-60 minutes by bus and tram . 
  i do n't drink anything to `` get awake '' . 
  i generally drink cold milk or some kind of juice because it goes well with bread . 
  it is very much a niche sport in sweden . 
  football , hockey , bandy , handball and floorball are all ahead of it both in terms of participation and viewership . 
  it 's more popular in the north and in the stockholm suburbs than elsewhere , but even in the most dedicated basketball hotbeds it is at best the 3rd most popular team sport and firmly behind football and hockey . 
  i have one . 
  if you make chips somewhat regularly it is 100 % worth the cost as they turn out much , much better than oven-baked ones . 
  it 's a complete pain in the arse to clean though . 
   we have an overpopulation problem in the world that is a factually incorrect assumption , as hans rosling showed time and time again . 
  on a per player basis you 're basically the best hockey nation in the world already . 
  do n't see many other countries with less than 1000 registered players qualifying for the olympics !, 
  appropriate username !, 
  rudnevs is a decent striker in the bundesliga at least . 
  they won gold in the 1936 olympics with a team entirely made up of canadians . 
  how do you list so many and somehow forget about ** sp\u00e4nn ** ? 
  i 'm sure there 's not a boy in the country who has n't been on the receiving end of that playground joke where someone asked to give you 20 ** sp\u00e4nn ** gives you 20 bicep curls instead of money ... you 're also missing the loan word ** cash ** that gets used a lot . 
  other than that referring to 1000 kr bills as ** stora ** ( `` big ones '' , because it is the bill with the highest value ) is the only common one i think you 've missed . 
  the 20 kr bill was sometimes referred to as a ** selma ** , but i do n't imagine that usage will survive now that selma lagerl\u00f6f is n't on them any more . 
  so 's yours !, 
  you 're missing out !, 
   cause you ca n't use simple olive oil or butter , right ? 
  both inferior culinary experiences to ketchup . 
  ketchup hits all five of the basic tastes , salt , sweet , sour , bitter , and umami . 
  neither butter nor olive oil do that . 
  nobody thinks about them . 
  a nice balsamico turns plain pasta into a gourmet dinner .

  why should someone who is too miserly to pay for membership enjoy the privilege of a church marriage , a christian funeral or any other church services ? 
  the church happily extends charity to non-members and expects nothing in return , something that allows it to aid groups that are excluded from the moralising government-run social programmes like drug addicts who ca n't or do n't want to maintain abstinence or mentally ill people who refuse treatment , people who would have been left outside in the cold otherwise , but i genuinely can not fathom how anyone could expect the church to offer religious services to cheapskates who refuse to pay for those services . 
  expecting the church to conduct your marriage , baptise your children and carry out your funeral service without paying them for it is as stupid as expecting your isp to provide you your internet connection for free . 
  one of the leftover perks the church of sweden has from its days as the official state church is that it can collect membership fees through taxes . 
  other religious denominations can also do this if they fulfil certain criteria and register with the tax authority . 
  employing priests is not free , neither is the maintenance of church buildings , running activities for youth and the elderly , operating crisis counselling , aiding the homeless , giving christmas gifts to the poor or any of the other charitable activities carried out by the church . 
  the church is arguably the most important actor in swedish civil society and does a lot to fill in the gaps and assist those who have fallen between the cracks of the welfare state and i gladly pay the ~ 1 % tax to help fund all those activities , even though i do n't believe and only go to church for funerals . 
  the church is a great force for good in our society and i feel much more certain that the tax i pay them is put to good work than i do with my municipal or county taxes . 
  does n't seem so . 
  yes , about 5-10 % of the swedish population is finnish or has a parent or grandparent who is . 
  some 5-6 % of the population speaks finnish . 
  no bad blood , unless there is a hockey game going on . 
  there used to be a lot of prejudice directed towards finns but that has died down over the years . 
  i take it you have n't seen the banners i saw ? 
   i just guessed from the context that they would be about a new rink or arena ( probably the latter considering they lined the whole motorway from the city centre out to the airport , which presumably takes a big advertising budget ) . 
  not what i expected to see when i went there !, 
   yep . 
  on the other hand , i did n't quite expect the us to beat russia . 
  this us team is the best i can remember them ever sending to the tournament . 
  had the patrick kane rumours been true i would have had them as tournament favourites even . 
  not a bad guess though , was it ? 
  there 's probably more ethnic hungarians in the romanian national team than in the actual hungarian national team , after all . 
  you would n't happen to know what all the banners and billboards with a cartoon boy playing hockey that i saw when i was in bucharest two weeks ago where about , would you ? 
  did a new ice rink open or something ? 
  and speaking of your national team , i think i read that they won their division this year ? 
  you should check out r/nhl _ games if you 'd like to watch more than 3 games a week too !, 
    the world championships are also on our national broadcaster as we speak . 
  well , canada vs finland is , i have the game running in the background  same here . 
  finland are absolutely woeful this year !, 
  i 'm a member of the church of sweden and pay church tax as a result , but no , i do not believe in god or any other higher powers ( aside from carey price , who is clearly not mortal . 
  hockey fan from romania ? 
  are you szekely ? 
  the part of the municipality where i live gets ground water , while the main town gets fresh lake water that is supposedly among the highest quality tap water in the world . 
  true : we genuinely do not like small talk , socialising with strangers or having our extraordinarily large personal space invaded . 
  you will become our mortal enemy if you sit next to us on the bus . 
  false : the idea of sweden as some kind of sexually promiscuous paradise of fetishistic libertines that seems to be floating around abroad . 
  we 're a very puritan society in many ways and even have our own moralising stereotypes of danes , germans and french being crude , overly promiscuous , too open , sexual deviants or perverts . 
  we have four variants of cheerios in sweden ; regular , oat , whole-grain , and honey . 
  probably a question for a stockholmer to answer . 
  sounds like a story i 've heard before though . 
  never mind buses and traffic signs , all the traffic infrastructure would be the wrong way . 
  corners would be banked incorrectly , roundabouts would be in the wrong direction , on and off-ramps on motorways would be the wrong way etc. 
  all of this would need to be rebuilt , something that often ca n't be done at a satisfactory level . 
  it 's been 50 years since our switch over and we 're still dealing with infrastructural problems caused by it in some places , and our traffic infrastructure was a lot less developed than the uk 's is now . 
   i 'm a lifelong teetotaler and it makes some people extremely angry tell them you 're driving . 
  i 'm going to reverse the question on you op , what kind of perverse person eats more than a tablespoon of that vile gunk in a year ? 
  thanks for reminding me there was a game on !, 
  oh , and random observation : the arena music choices in cologne are worse than eurovision . 
  nah , the friend who used to convince me to watch it was n't even aware it was on tv tonight . 
  i love how you listed a group that only numbers about 150 individuals first . 
  when spoken by a beautiful woman sm\u00e5l\u00e4ndska is just wonderful . 
  we have a minority government , so the worst ideas thankfully do n't make it into law . 
  the `` feminist snow clearance '' was a good idea packaged in stupidity . 
  prioritising pedestrians and cyclists who need the snow clearance more than cars is a good enough idea on its own , it never needed the gender argument to justify itself and attaching it to that divisive debate did it a lot more harm than good . 
  it 's not that rare for club teams to face national teams in friendlies in football , but i 've never heard of it happening in hockey before . 
  that said , danish hockey has improved by leaps and bounds since the early 90s . 
  their best players now would be good enough to play for sweden in a best-on-best tournament , that certainly was n't the case even 10 years ago , much less 25 years ago . 
  unless the sporting activity is hockey , because then the talent disparity is too great for either side to care . 
  i understood a surprising amount of written romanian , though the spoken was all just * bar bar bar * to me . 
   that the planet is romania-shaped . 
  you mean to tell me that it is n't ?!? 
  i think i saw a poll from a few years ago saying something like 45 % of romanians would vote for zombie ceausescu if they could ... 
  so raising ceausescu from the dead would still be more popular than the return of the monarchy ? 
  what degree of support would you say reinstating the monarchy has in romania ? 
   in the best case , michael i of course , though we 'd have to modify the succession law as soon as that happens , as when the monarchy was forced out , we still had salic law . 
  i was more thinking of michael i 's descendants . 
  has n't he basically disowned more or less all of them ? 
   roll the lottery for a foreign monarch i 'd suggest prince carl philip , but i doubt romanians would be cool with having a lutheran monarch , even if they did elect a lutheran president .
