  it could also just be something they do to make furnishing the room easier . 
  getting actual double beds in and out of the rooms has to be a major pain in the arse . 
  france has a big hip-hop scene . 
  it 's not really my genre , but i sometimes give [ 1995 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjncxtrjxk0 ) and [ orelsan ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2kvtrprvkk ) a listen . 
   stress during youth as far as i know sweden is the only european country with an exam-free school system , so we definitely win that round . 
  only weirdos from the north actually eat surstr\u00f6mming . 
  if you had restaurants that were open at times when i was actually awake and not a barely functioning , sleep-deprived zombie i would have been very happy to try . 
   nordic customs do not fit well into these southern europe ways of living . . yeah , that definitely seems to be the case . 
  i guess they hate physical contact ? 
  how late do you get up in the morning ? 
  do you take naps during the day ? 
  how late do you eat your lunch ? 
  you would n't want to eat dinner much later than 6 pm if you were on a northern european sleep-pattern or work schedule . 
  when i was in france this summer i did n't eat dinner a single time for that reason . 
  i 'm a pretty serious morning person , i tend to wake up around 4 am and if i 've been doing stuff during the day i 'm ready to clock out by 7-8 pm when the restaurants down there started opening . 
  the `` double '' bed i had in my room in nice this summer was just two singles pushed together . 
  they started sliding apart if you got too close to the middle . 
  i get why hotels do it though . 
  gives them much more flexibility with the rooms . 
  there is n't anyone making any music that i like in the swedish language . 
  most music produced in sweden is in english . 
   our fatality rate per million is 52 , which is the same as austria and lower than france , belgium and luxembourg , vastly lower than all eastern countries and `` only '' ten deaths higher than germany ( 42 ) or ireland ( 43 ) . 
  accidents caused by drunk-driving probably makes up somewhat for your more aggressive driving-style when compared to northern european countries . 
  basically , you have far more drivers who seem to be acting out on a secret desire to die while in traffic , while you have far less of the guys who need half a litre of vodka just to get through the day or those who think a friday night with less than 20 beers is a friday night wasted . 
   is n't this particular infraction the equivalent of that 5 km/h speeding ? 
  i 'll quote my post here :  the highest possible punishment for speeding , day-fines ( dagsb\u00f6ter ) , is also the lowest possible punishment for drunk driving . 
  driving 50 km/h over the limit is the legal equivalent of what she did . 
  the punishment ( p\u00e5f\u00f6ljd in swedish legal terminology ) is the same . 
   you 're allowed to drive with 1 glass of wine , she ended up on the road with 1.1 glass of wine ? 
  you 're not allowed to drive with any glasses of wine . 
  the very reason why our legal limit is so low is to eliminate that sort of thinking . 
  `` oh , it 's okay , it 's only one glass ! '', 
  or `` i 'm fine , i do n't feel drunk ! '', 
  one glass is one glass too many . 
  if you 're drinking , you 're not driving . 
  period . 
  speeding ( fortk\u00f6rning ) would only be legally equivalent to drunk-driving ( rattfylleri ) if it was deemed serious enough to warrant a charge of dangerous driving ( v\u00e5rdsl\u00f6shet i trafik ) . 
  the highest possible punishment for speeding , day-fines ( dagsb\u00f6ter ) , is also the lowest possible punishment for drunk driving , which can give up to 6 months in prison . 
  there is a line between crimes that are resolved on the spot by a ticket issued by a police officer , like all but the most extreme cases of speeding , and those that are a court matter and could lead to a prison sentence , like drunk driving . 
  basically , i would n't expect a politician who is caught driving 5 km/h over the limit to resign , but one caught driving more than 50 km/h over the limit ( which is where it becomes a matter for the courts ) would almost certainly resign . 
   i beg to differ what matters most , actual data , or your gut feeling ? 
  she broke the law . 
  i do n't think it is setting the bar too high to expect that a government minister stays within the law . 
  say what you want about other politicians having done things that look a lot worse and still holding on to their positions , most of them did n't break any laws and those that did were almost universally expected to resign . 
  the guy self-describes as a democratic socialist , which would put him on the far-left even in europe . 
  why seek anecdotal answers here when [ the adl already has an answer to your question ? 
  ] ( http://global100.adl.org ), 
  athletics is the only summer olympic sport that interests me . 
  sprinting in particular . 
   nobody cares about baseball outside the us & japan . 
  the baseball world is a lot bigger than that . 
  cuba is the most famous , but venezuela , south korea , mexico and many of the countries in the carribean and central america are baseball nations . 
  it 's arguably just as international a sport as rugby , which was also made an olympic sport not long ago . 
  you will never get a visa , and even if you could the real world is absolutely nothing like you imagine it . 
  op , by the sounds of it you may have a pretty good shot at acquiring italian citizenship . 
  i suggest you take a look at the wikipedia article on [ italian nationality law ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italian_nationality_law#attribution_of_citizenship_through_jus_sanguinis ) , if you do n't see anything there that you think would disqualify you i suggest you get in touch with someone who specialises in italian nationality law . 
  since this is something pretty common i doubt finding someone like that would give you too much trouble . 
  you 're wrong . 
   italian citizenship is granted by birth through the paternal line , ** with no limit on the number of generations , ** or through the maternal line for individuals born after 1 january 1948 . 
  ... ** there is no generational limit , except in respect to the date of 17 march 1861 . 
  ** from the wikipedia article on [ italian nationality law ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italian_nationality_law#attribution_of_citizenship_through_jus_sanguinis ) . 
  there are a bunch of conditions that may have led to a loss of italian citizenship at some point in op 's lineage , but given that he has two separate lines to make a claim from i 'd say it is highly likely that he qualifies for italian citizenship through descent . 
  he should get in touch with a lawyer who specialises in nationality law to make sure though . 
  you should take your complaint to the people who wrote the italian nationality law instead of being a dick towards the op . 
  your own country does roughly the same thing , by the way . 
  farmers hate wolves , even in places that do n't have any . 
  do n't let yourself be pressured into becoming a sitzpinkler , op !, 
  there 's a very specific sub-culture of mostly rural men known as [ raggare ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/raggare ) , aside from that we do n't really have any words of our own , so the english terms white trash and rednecks are sometimes used as loan words . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.bjurfors.se/sv/tillsalu/vastra-gotaland/goteborg/naset/tjuvdalsliden-5/#bilder ) is apparently the most expensive house on sale in gothenburg at the moment . 
  looking at the listings it seems there 's less of the absolute top-range of houses on sale at the moment than usual though . 
  most expensive i 've ever seen for sale here was [ this mansion ] ( http://www.expressen.se/leva-och-bo/rao-gard-till-salu-for-65-miljoner-kronor/ ) which used to belong to former volvo ceo p. g. gyllenhammar . 
  it was a really hard sell though , not a lot of people here who have that kind of cash and our properties are not nearly as popular with foreign buyers as those in stockholm . 
  bank loans ? 
  that garden looks pretty serious to my eyes as a complete layman . 
   what is your favorite football club ? 
  \u00d6rgryte is . 
   how many games do you go to per year ? 
  would go more often if i lived closer to the stadium and/or was n't as broke . 
   do you have a favorite supporter chant ? 
  [ en enda k\u00e4nsla , started at about 0:20 in this clip by our captain . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h46inr3yzoi ) too long to translate , but one life , one club , one love is the core of it . 
   does your team or fanbase have any unique traditions ? 
  well , playing exciting football , you know the whole `` win by scoring one more than the opposition '' , more important to play the right way that win thing has been a big part of the club identity for a long time , although most clubs claim they are all about that these days . 
  as one of our chants proclaims : `` we play football when others hoof it '' . 
  not so unique today when possession football is king , but back in the 70 's -90 's when swedish football was more british-style it set us apart . 
   how heated is your biggest rivalry ? 
  the disparity in fanbase size and recent success kind of mellows out our rivalry with ifk . 
   would you feel safe wearing your team 's jersey alone in your rival team 's city/territory ? 
  our rivals are from the same city as us , and club rivalries are historically based on class rather than geography , so they do n't really have any territory that 's `` theirs '' , and neither do we . 
  besides , the people who are genuinely dangerous do n't wear club colours and do n't care much for the people who do . 
   what about in their stadium ( outside the designated visiting fan section ) ? 
  their stadium is also our stadium . 
   is football ` hooligan ' culture a big problem in your country ? 
  only if you think lighting a flare is an aggressive and vicious act of violence , like our tabloids do . 
  actual hooligans do exist , but in this country `` football violence '' is more a construction of tabloid media than a real world problem . 
   for those who support mid and low-finishing teams : do you get sick of seeing the same 2-3 teams win your country 's title every year ? 
  swedish football is n't like that . 
  a different club wins almost every year . 
   do fans celebrate things like getting 6th place ( or not getting relegated ) if their team normally does much worse ? 
  it 's hard to describe how narrowly escaping relegation feels to someone who does n't follow a sport where relegation is a thing .
