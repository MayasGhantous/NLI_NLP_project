  toronto . 
  rt , true ? 
  lol !, 
  china has more english speakers than any other country . 
   there is no european country where the overwhelming majority of local bigwigs do n't speak at least one of english , french and german . 
  italy still exists . 
  the way i understand it is that germans strongly prefer doing business in german , even if they speak english . 
  english works for quick deals , but for long-term interactions german becomes essential . 
   what culture ? 
  not trolling , explain to me what swedish `` culture '' is today and why it 's something a country should be proud of . 
  a consensus mentality , weekend binge drinking , dancing around a flowery phallus in the summer and watching donald duck on christmas eve . 
  just as worthy of celebration as any other modern western culture . 
  much better than i thought . 
  because most of them are safe for human consumption . 
  that something is lethally poisonous for insects is in no way an indication that it would be the same for humans . 
  i do n't think the vikings seamanship and prowess at trading are what the people who are making those kinds of comments have in mind . 
  we also smuggled essential war materials like ball-bearings to the allies and housed , trained and armed the norwegian resistance . 
  hell , we even had plans to invade , err , i mean * liberate * denmark !, 
  i 'm from the last age-group to have been called for selection , though i do not believe anyone actually got to serve as conscription was abolished before service began . 
  by the time i was called , so few actually got to serve that the military sent out a questionnaire months in advance to weed out everyone uninterested or otherwise obviously unsuitable , so only people genuinely interested got called for selection . 
  i was called , but i failed the fitness tests . 
  since they felt that i was genuinely interested in military service i got told to go home , get fit and come back in 6 months , but by that time conscription had been abolished . 
  overall i am a bit disappointed that i did n't get to do it , as it was something i really wanted to do at the time , plus it was n't as if i would have missed out on anything else as i ended up spending the time i would have spent doing military service unemployed . 
  i had a look at wikipedia , there 's apparently 7 different police forces in italy , 8 if you count the coast guard . 
   one of our police forces . 
  how many of those do you have again ? 
  they hate us 'cause they ai n't us . 
  since i 'm not a completely blind ideologue , i am perfectly capable of looking beyond my own biases and i 'm not particularly interested in shoving my own thoughts down other people 's throats . 
  judging by the post you made , that 's not something you are capable of , because you made it blindingly obvious that you are a committed sweden democrat . 
  being unbiased usually is n't a strong-point for the people who view jimmie as the second coming . 
  of course he is n't . 
  money they 'll then waste caring for deformed children , such wonderful logic !, 
  real high-quality policework !, 
  move to [ insert region with independence movement here ] !, 
  it totally is n't spain !, 
  i did n't feel anything out here in the ` burbs . 
  your legal gun permit in the us is nothing but toilet paper in the eu . 
  hey op , [ please do n't do this shit !, 
  switzerland offers gun licences for `` protection '' ? 
  no , you will not be allowed to have a gun with you anywhere . 
  the czech republic is the only country in europe sympathetic to the american idea of carrying a handgun for `` protection '' , but i doubt even they would let some random foreigner walk around with one . 
  doing this by percentage in the 2014 election : ** socialdemokraterna ( s ) ( social democratic party ) ** - 31 % the historical giants of swedish politics , historically so successful that sweden virtually functioned as a single-party state for much of the 20th century . 
  very closely linked with [ lo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_trade_union_confederation ) , a confederation of blue-collar trade unions , their dominance has fallen in the post-industrial era but they remain sweden 's largest party . 
  like most large european social democratic parties they are a centre-left party today . 
  ** moderaterna ( m ) ( moderate party ) ** 23.3 % the traditional arch-nemesis of the social democrats , a historically conservative party that has become increasingly liberal over time , particularly during the reinfeldt years . 
  in 2015 it would be difficult for an outside observer to decide if the party is liberal conservative or conservative liberal , it might even be labelled as a social liberal party . 
  either way the centrist shift was successful for the party , sometimes placing ahead of the social democrats in opinion polls and producing their best election results in almost a century but they have struggled in opinion polls since the election . 
  ** sverigedemokraterna ( sd ) ( sweden democrats ) ** 12.9 % once formed out of the white nationalist [ bevara sverige svenskt-movement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bevara_sverige_svenskt ) the party has gone through several changes over the years in an effort to become a serious , accepted political party . 
  while they have historically referred to themselves as nationalists , they have begun styling themselves as * socially conservative * in more recent times , though in practice they are effectively a single-issue anti-immigration party , primarily attracting voters dissatisfied with the immigration policy pursued by the other riksdag parties . 
  anti-eu . 
  ** milj\u00f6partiet de gr\u00f6na ( mp ) ( green party ) ** 6.9 % a generally left-leaning and softly eurosceptic green party , popular with young , urban voters . 
  ** centerpartiet ( c ) ( centre party ) ** 6.1 % an agrarian and liberal party , they are strong proponents of decentralisation and the interests of swedish farmers . 
  traditionally the strongest in rural areas , but in recent years they have made an effort to attract both right-leaning green voters and libertarians from urban areas . 
  centrist on social issues , but furthest to the right along with the liberal people 's party on economic issues . 
  ** v\u00e4nsterpartiet ( v ) ( the left party ) ** 5.7 % once the swedish communist party , they are a democratic socialist party today . 
  furthest to the left of all the riksdag parties , they advocate feminism , a larger public sector , higher taxes and oppose privatisations . 
  anti-eu . 
  ** folkpartiet liberalerna ( fp ) ( liberal people 's party ) ** 5.4 % a mostly social liberal party , though it has a sizeable conservative liberal faction within the party . 
  the most internationalist party in the riksdag , fp are strong supporters of free trade , the free market , the eu and have advocated for swedish nato membership for decades . 
  the party also distinguish themselves by being the strongest supporters of both nuclear power and the armed forces in the riksdag . 
  socially and economically liberal , the party is centrist on social issues and on the right along with the centre party on economic issues relative to the other riksdag parties . 
  typically stronger in urban areas than in the countryside . 
  ** kristdemokraterna ( kd ) ( christian democrats ) ** 4.6 % socially conservative by swedish standards but almost socially liberal compared to foreign christian democratic parties , the christian democrats traditionally draw their support from the pentecostals and free churches and are usually the smallest party in the riksdag . 
  centre-right both economically and socially . 
  as great as they are in real life , grid cities get boring really quickly in the game . 
  esprit de corps is the real term , i believe . 
  makes it a pain in the ass to figure out the parking conditions for a parking spot in advance too . 
  there are actual sports versions of the focus . 
   finland is drinking vodka and fiddling with his lighter , having already disassembled his watch and knife do n't forget about him insisting that he * totally * is n't drunk !, 
  vw has n't been very humble for quite a while . 
  it 's been a mid-range manufacturer since the early 90s at least . 
  definitely . 
  you 're not going to find many small towns in sweden without an authorised volvo dealer . 
  toyota in europe gave up on making cars like the t-sport about 10 years ago though . 
  they did n't have any `` sporty '' option in their entire range for a long time before the gt86 came , and i consider that car an anomaly . 
  if i can muster up the money the new mustang will be my next car . 
   besides , drunk drivers kill lots of innocent people , and alcoholics/smokers are a big strain on our free healthcare . 
  there 's been some suggestions from economic studies that smokers actually end up being cheaper on society overall because they die much earlier than non-smokers . 
  thank you for this entirely irrelevant anecdote about the united states . 
  reliability is not a factor i really consider when buying a car . 
  i 'd die of boredom in a toyota . 
  ford and seat are the only affordable brands that set out to make cars fun across the entire model range . 
  car buyers tend to be nationalistic . 
  historically local brands have been more in line with local preferences as well , it takes a long time for foreign brands to break down generations worth of brand loyalty . 
  ford europe is more or less a british manufacturer . 
  vw has n't been a `` cheap '' brand for about 25 years . 
  they make mid-market cars these days . 
   most of their cars are based on vw-platforms . 
  more like all of them . 
  when you buy a new seat you 're basically getting a rebadged audi from the previous generation . 
  it would presumably have taken them a few years to catch up with foreign brands . 
  but some time in the 1930s seems likely . 
  out of the `` cheap '' brands ford and seat are the only ones i 'd personally consider actually buying a car from . 
   black bmw with tinted glass ( illegal ) . 
  so tinted rear and rear passenger windows , which is a common factory option , is illegal i lithuania ? 
  that 's ridiculous . 
  no , they are being hunted by robert mugabe . 
  on the other hand it also radicalises the middle . 
  more centrist republicans and democrats have to adjust their views to placate to the die-hards to win in the primaries , in pr systems the parties slowly converge towards the middle , in the us the two parties are getting further and further apart . 
  this is the internet , you are allowed to swear .
