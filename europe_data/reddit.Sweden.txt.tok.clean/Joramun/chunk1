or greece . 
  absolutely . 
  greece could and did impose duties , taxes and tariffs on imports , also on such things like financial instruments and investments , but much more importantly could manage its deficit with the drachma and holding on to other countries fx reserves , much like sweden does now with the krona and euro reserves . 
  here 's the [ oecd source ] ( http://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?datasetcode=rev ) , feel free to browse it at your convenience . 
  no problem , let 's not be bitter , we are just exchanging information , right . 
  my point is that greece was n't in terrible shape pre-eurozone even if there are a few salient points that stick out ( much like they do in every country , however ) . 
  i never brought up debt-to-gdp ratios . 
  i mentioned the huge trade deficit , which i view as the prime contributing factor in the crisis . 
  basically , greece has always been a client state of germany and some other countries . 
  it buys everything from them , not having any industry of its own to speak of , which is very much to the benefit of these countries . 
  it buys a few things from sweden , like cars and industrial equipment . 
  this has historically been the case , which is why it 's a different case than germany or the united states or japan . 
  also the size of the economy is a huge difference , that does n't give merit any sort of comparison between these countries and greece . 
  comparisons with ireland and portugal are more like it . 
  for that reason , that it has always been a net importer , its induction in the eurozone was a terrible idea for greece , because it was bound to create these problems . 
  before , greece * could * do things about the trade deficit : it could make money off imports via import taxation , tariffs , or even foreign exchange reserves . 
  now it can do * none * of those things , because of the unified currency and unified trading zone of the eurozone . 
  it must look to europe for balancing out these deficits since europe is in control of the euro , and europe has done absolutely * nothing * to help , except publicly blame greece . 
  i am very much against that . 
  very disappointing . 
  all of those are very spurious comparisons . 
  to begin with : some of your figures are definitively wrong . 
  japan has the highest debt-to-gdp ratio in the world , clocking in at over 200 % . 
  and are you seriously wanting to compare the economies of the united states , japan , and germany to that of greece ? 
  are you aware how many security valves the states for example have on a federal level to prevent financial meltdown ? 
  are you aware that , to prevent a debt crisis in 2008 , the us essentially bought out debt by printing more money , something greece could never in a million years have done after it joined the eurozone because it was n't in control of its currency ? 
  greece did n't start way worse off . 
  it was at 98 % debt to gdp ratio , which is fair for a country that is always been a net importer . 
  the trend is the same , like you mentioned . 
  so how was it way worse off ? 
  it was n't . 
  the problems were there , but they have been magnified and exacerbated a hundredfold because of the eurozone 's poor design . 
  like i said , greece has no access to correcting mechanisms of its economy . 
  they are at the hands of the european central bank , that has shown absolutely no incentive to help out beleaguered countries , which is what the eurozone compact was to begin with . 
  what are those comparisons you made worth ? 
  absolutely nothing . 
  any one country can not be considered * in vacuo * . 
  do you want to completely ignore the economic history of greece in favor of making a worthless comparison with a country a hundred times as large ? 
  that 's absurd , nonsensical , and what 's infinitely worse , it 's a misrepresentation of the worst magnitude . 
  i do n't know that you read your own link . 
  i see a debt-to-dgp ratio of around 98 before the eurozone , which is fairly standard . 
  it 's what countries like belgium , france and britain have . 
  i see an over 40 % increase since 2006 , which is what people ( like myself ) are arguing is the harmful effect of the eurozone on greece . 
  you are completely off . 
  no one benefited as much from the eurozone as the industrial exporting countries of the eurozone , and to pretend otherwise is a huge disservice to the people of europe . 
  trade tariffs gone , no currency exchange loss , no import taxation . 
  since the eurozone 's inception , german exports to greece have risen by 150 % - that is , they have more than doubled . 
  i hope you understand how this is a massive increase in profits . 
  in contrast , greek exports to germany have risen by almost 10 % . 
  that is a massively imbalanced trade deficit , and greece has access to ** none ** of the corrective mechanisms that can be undertaken to fix it ( measures such as fx reserves , import taxation , foreign exchange measures like raising or dropping the exchange rate ) , because the eurozone leaders did not think that far . 
  any kind of corrective and collective mechanism that would attempt to restore parity ( such as a theoretical eurobond ) have been shot down without a second thought by said exporting countries . 
  and to address what you think is a benefit , holding a country that does ** not ** have a german economy 's level sustainability to german standards , in order to access german interest rates , like for example inflation requirements , is definitely not a benefit . 
  in short , greece is held up by germany and co. as a client state whose only role is to buy german products . 
  when they inevitably fail because of these short-sighted policies , the strategy is to blame them to avoid any real examination of the problem . 
  this is an unpopular opinion , i know , and harder to accept , because it wo n't show up in any kind of journalistic media , but i believe it 's the truth . 
  it 's by far not the result of only that . 
  the situation only came to a head because of the trade deficits and fiscal imbalances put in place by an incomplete and poorly-thought out trade and currency union , which is what the eurozone is . 
  western media like to propagate this story , that greece and italy and spain and portugal have reaped what they have sown , while they themselves are completely blameless , and while it 's occasionally easy to see through that bullshit , it 's sad to see that some people still buy wholesale into it . 
  finally , you are deluded if you think your country is free of corruption . 
  if it benefits a bank or a big industrial corporation , it 's simply not called corruption , but something else to disguise it . 
  what a load of bullshit . 
  maybe you want the eiffel tower too since maybe london is visited by more people than paris ? 
  maybe all the world 's museums ? 
  your sense of entitlement is unbelievable . 
  fuck you . 
  that is a good point , and it is exactly what those people asking for `` fiscal transfers '' and `` wealth redistribution '' are asking for . 
  the cost of a new plant is too much for the greeks to undertake ; but if a german company came and opened up a plant in their country , that would mean that a real transfer of wealth took place , and new jobs opened up in greece . 
  that is part of what needs to be done ; however even in that regard greece is screwed because the former eastern bloc countries are more competitive , in terms of lower costs and wages , than greece , so germany would rather open up plants in slovakia , bulgaria , romania than greece . 
  and with the influx of countries that are historically poorer than greece , no matter how much greece becomes poorer , there will always be a poorer former soviet neighbor to expand to for german companies . 
  thank you very much for posting this, 
  letting greece revert to the drachma at this juncture would completely destroy them short-term . 
  since there is no mechanism , and no legal framework to formalize an exit to the currency , it will ( rightly ) be taken to mean that the euro area is n't anything else than a currency pegging mechanism that anyone whose fiscal targets are not met can be expelled from . 
  understandably this will hurt everyone in it and in the future countries such as france and italy might start thinking about exiting , too , since the lofty ideals that created it have gone the way of the dodo and now it 's just a way for germany to be an exporting powerhouse . 
  in short , there is no prosperity for everyone ; there is just prosperity for a few , and poverty in the cards for the rest . 
  as for greece , since all of its debts are pegged to the euro and governed by british law since the first bailout , it will not be able to pay back anything as the drachma would be devalued compared to the euro a second after it was issued . 
  life would be much worse for the average greek than it is now . 
  we are talking absolute misery . 
  starvation , riots , food stamps , medicine and other essential shortages . 
  there is no good way to do any kind of stabilization except one : the only one . 
  debt relief , and promote growth . 
  the combination of additional loans , austerity , and demands for costly reforms are demonstrably killing greece , absolutely and irreconcilably with the supposed good intentions and the visage of the `` caring partner '' all these disasters are foisted on them . 
  you should n't . 
  like i told you above , germany has profited * massively * from using a common currency . 
  if i were a net exporter of the magnitude of germany , my wet dream would be to gather up a bunch of my client countries that i export to , and ask them to use the same currency as mine . 
  of course the euro was sold as much more than that . 
  it was sold as beginning of the federal states of europe . 
  but a currency union , because of these exact problems i 've been explaining , ca n't function without equal fiscal transfers - wealth redistribution . 
  and since that has n't happened except in the capacity of your post , which is far too little compared to what is necessary , essentially the poor can only keep up with the only way left to them : borrowing . 
  it 's not a coincidence all the `` peripheral '' economies of the eurozone have run into borrowing trouble . 
  greece 's is only the most acute because of their systemic problems , but the eurozone nations will keep running into this trouble forever , greece or no , until a fiscal transfer mechanism is implemented . 
  this matter was very well known . 
  godley and others argued it in the 90s to no end , and it 's the exact reason the uk declined to enter the currency union , they argued it in the british parliament for months and months , talking about this exact situation : unequal competitiveness economies forced to join into a common currency , with the inevitable result of the less competitive economy collapsing . 
  greece should never have entered the union if there was going to be no fiscal transfer going its way . 
  it had nothing to gain other than weaken itself . 
  unfortunately it was lured by promises of `` european solidarity '' and `` european prosperity '' which have promptly evaporated when they were needed the most . 
  well , in other products the difference might be much more noticeable . 
  if you have to pay half price for something german , instead of something polish , would you take it ? 
  how about if you were trying to save money in the midst of a crisis ? 
  see , it 's not as simple as telling people to shop `` hip '' . 
  and also you know there are many industries that you simply ca n't start in greece .
