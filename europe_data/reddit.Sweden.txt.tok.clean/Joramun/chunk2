  what greek manufacturer would start a car company in greece ? 
  how would he compete with german manufacturers ? 
  the costs to enter and the efficiency requirement are simply too high . 
  so nobody does it , and the greeks have to buy german ( or other european ) cars . 
  this is an unavoidable purchase for the greeks - what new family does n't buy a car ? 
  - and whereas before they could balance it with currency exchange , now they ca n't . 
  german cars will always be expensive to them . 
  as well as japanese ones - they simply have to use the strong currency ( the euro ) they use at the moment . 
  no currency depreciation relief for them . 
  i think you misunderstood . 
  germany does n't only compete with cars ( and that is no competition , since greek does n't have an auto industry ) . 
  it also competes in things greece produces - and because of manufacturing efficiency , economies of scale , germany produces ( and can sell ) those things more cheaply than greek products - in greece . 
  since the currency is now pegged , and greeks ca n't use the relative values of currency to make their products cheaper and thus more competitive !, 
  see my other comment [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3d2q71/from_1976_to_2013_the_biggest_net_contributor_to/ct1by21 ) for more explanation . 
  it 's not an education problem , it 's purely a competitiveness problem . 
  german milk costs less to produce than greek milk per liter due to economies of scale , and domestic factors ( for example , cow vaccines are made in germany instead of greece ) . 
  in general that means that a carton of german milk can be sold in greece for $ 1 , whereas a carton of greek milk for $ 1.20 . 
  so the greek consumer will naturally tend to buy the german milk , thus increasing the profits of the german farmer , and german government 's tax revenue when he could be helping his own farmers and government . 
  greece ( or portugal , or poland ) simply do n't have the manufacturing efficiency ( and really , no country in the world does ) to compete with germany . 
  that is even more true in areas where they do n't even * have * competitive industries - for example , car manufacturing , or appliances . 
  who do you have in poland that can compete with audi , vw , bosch ? 
  you simply have to buy those products . 
  but before when you could depreciate the drachma or you the zloty and thus gain in competitiveness ( since 1 deutsche mark would be more drachmas , and thus be more expensive ) now you * ca n't * . 
  you have to use the * same * currency - and that means that greece ca n't compete with germany . 
  consuming less what ? 
  less cars ? 
  greek household spending is among the lowest in the eurozone . 
  lower than germany 's and for * all * its years in the eurozone , [ ** lower than the euro area average . 
  ** ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/consumer-credit ) greeks are n't profligate consumers ; they borrow less than the germans to cover their needs on average . 
  they borrow less than the euro average to cover their needs . 
  the problem is that they spend their money buying german products instead of greek . 
  greek products are n't competitive compared to the german ones ; thus the deficit keeps increasing , and the problem forever being perpetuated . 
  that 's one aspect of it . 
  however , the other is how much germany has benefited from being able to export to the countries of europe without having to pay exchange rates and suffering from taxes , tariffs , and other such things . 
  i bet you germany has profited much more than it has paid back . 
  for example , [ german exports to greece have more than doubled since greece 's introduction to the eurozone . 
  ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/germany/exports-to-greece ) going from ~ $ 250 million monthly to about $ 700 and more . 
  pick any other country , like portugal , ireland , spain , and you 'll see the exact same trend , and even more pronounced . 
  german [ exports to spain for example ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/germany/exports-to-spain ) have quadrupled since the eurozone 's inception , from around $ 1 bn monthly to about $ 4 . 
  i hope you understand how that means the net profit has risen by much more than that increase ( i.e. 
  net profit has ** more ** than quadrupled from the exports to spain ) , since the euro means that germany did n't have to suffer from foreign exchange rates which are a natural balancing factor in trade deficits , nor did it have to pay any taxes or tariffs since the eurozone is a unified trading zone . 
  from just one weak country - greece - you can see how it means about $ 100 billion in net increase . 
  if you compare all of the countries that are in the euro , how much has germany benefited ? 
  a lot . 
  more than a lot . 
  tremendously . 
  so while it 's nice that germany pays back some of that money , it 's not out of the goodness of their hearts . 
  it 's because it is ** massively ** to their interest to make it worthwhile for their weaker clients to stay in a single currency ( and a * very * high-value one at that ) which offers them no benefits to their own exports outside of europe . 
  in short , greece has no way of balancing the great trade deficits it has incurred due to the euro . 
  normally the drachma would depreciate , and german products would be more expensive compared to theirs ; thus giving greek ones a competitive edge abroad over german ones . 
  now this does n't happen , and greece , portugal , ireland , and so on , have to finance their trade deficit the only way they can . 
  by borrowing .

  i was challenged by some guy to `` donate money '' out of the blue , and i said i have , and i will in the future . 
  morality never entered my posts about fiscal transfers , only economic necessity as i view it . 
  it 's quite funny how someone can be all of a sudden talking about moral high ground and hypocrisy when they themselves have accused others of not paying taxes , to move to another country because that 's what they have to do to support it , and telling them to `` put their money where their mouth is '' . 
  no wonder the situation in europe resembles a bad morality play . 
  this conversation is at an end , sorry . 
  so the fling about me not paying taxes was part of your nice little tough guy act ? 
  you 're `` basically '' trying to construct a narrative that i want no part of . 
  i 've already said some of what i do personally for greece ( and some more that i have not mentioned ) , and i voice my opinion in the hope that my government ( s ) will follow suit . 
  what do you do ? 
  telling strangers on the internet to put their money where their mouth is ? 
  i suspect that 's the extent of it . 
  that 's not a mechanism . 
  i have a job and a life here already . 
  and i pay taxes in sweden too for business i do there , and property i own . 
  what is this kind of discussion ? 
  i do n't even understand . 
  people rushing to conclusions in order to prove what , exactly ? 
  yes , because i believe that 's europe should operate if it wants to be a fiscal union . 
  the rest of the countries did n't become efficient overnight . 
  and if you think the swiss are n't corrupt or there is n't bureaucracy , you are in for a surprise . 
  there are such things in every country . 
  i 've lived in germany and that 's where i 've seen more bureaucracy than other countries i have lived . 
  i 'm not bragging ? 
  you were the one who came at me saying `` why do n't you donate money '' . 
  i just replied that i have , indeed , donated money . 
  i have n't asked anyone else to donate , and it 's mildly funny being lectured for `` not putting my money where my mouth is '' from someone who has n't . 
  both cutting expenditures and enacting reforms is an almost impossible proposition . 
  healthy states would fail at that . 
  when an unhealthy state had to do it , it caused a severe depression . 
  it ca n't work . 
  give them time and help to have their economy grow , have them reform it in a less-demanding climate , and then you can collect your debts . 
  if you keep forcing them , they 'll collapse , and you wo n't collect anything and will have caused suffering to all the greeks . 
   and the greeks have been committing fraud before that for about a decade . 
  i 'm not sure what you refer to exactly . 
  i 'm guessing it 's about the goldman sachs thing ? 
  [ they entered a complicated scheme with goldman sachs ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-03-06/goldman-secret-greece-loan-shows-two-sinners-as-client-unravels ) to abide by the criteria , but at the same time all the european countries have failed those same criteria at some point or other . 
  in fact , some other countries had done similar deals like the greeks in the past , it was n't exactly illegal :  under eurostat accounting rules , nations were permitted until 2008 to use so-called off-market rates in swaps to manage their debt . 
  greek officials , including sardelis , say they learned that other eu countries such as italy had employed similar methods to shrink their debts , taking advantage of the secrecy of over-the-counter derivatives compared with swaps traded on exchanges . 
  see , that 's where moralizing hurts the discussion . 
  there should not be any moralizing because it detracts from the reality of the situation and it stops us from finding the better solution . 
  if you want greeks to be partners , like you say , then you ca n't be with the same breath accusing them of being fraudsters , populists , cheats , and the like at every turn , and you have to stop thinking `` look at how they demand ! '', 
  because i imagine that 's the exact same way they view the situation : `` look at how they demand we do austerity and reforms while our country is getting destroyed ! '', 
  you can give it any narrative you want . 
  but the economic reality is that if there is n't a large fiscal transfer to greece , it ca n't keep borrowing to pay back older debts while its economy shrinks , because it will inevitably collapse , and then it wo n't be able to pay back anything . 
  all economists i 've read agree with that . 
  that 's all i 'm saying .
