i know you love us germany . 
  i met half your country while hiking in abisko this summer . 
  not every day you run into the prospect of actually capturing a russian submarine in your own territorial waters . 
  it will be very interesting to see what comes to pass if that happens . 
  [ we 're also somewhat afraid of them abducting drunken scientists from inner-city stockholm . 
  ] ( http://youtu.be/cgvklzol0j8?t=52m14s ), 
  just start a war with us and we 'll incorporate you into the swedish realm again . 
   though i dare say you might just win that fight and sweden becomes west estland . 
  worth noting that 501 of those drowned were swedes , so this was and still is a huge deal there . 
  this was one of the single largest loss of swedish lives in modern history . 
  it seemed everyone knew someone affected by the disaster . 
  the death toll per nationality was : 501 swedes 284 estonians 17 latvians 11 russians 10 finns and more of atleast 10 different nationalities . 
  852 lives lost in total . 
  literally means sauna swamp . 
  more like a french hipster vampire-hunter . 
  to summarize : the left has remained pretty much constant while migration * mainly * from alliansen to the sweden democrats have lost alliansen it 's majority . 
  their votes are `` wasted '' , but not quite . 
  they now have enough votes to receive state funding for political campaigning . 
  maybe there are people who are spreading the line and litter myth so they can have preikestolen to themselves !, 
  homosexual illuminati moslem nazi jews ?!?!? 
  seriously . 
  during one of the big , national , military exercises my conscripted grandfather went to in the 50 's , sweden , a whole squad drowned when they accidentally parachuted over a lake . 
  some scout also died crashing his motorcycle . 
  * that * is frontpage worthy . 
   `` in the painting hy\u00f6kk\u00e4ys by eetu isto , the finnish maiden is being attacked by the russian eagle , which is tearing away the law book . 
  it was painted when the russification of finland started 1899 . '', 
  actually most of south sweden and the east coast is quite populated . 
  i live in forest , sweden . 
  this is from my window , but last winter . 
  really forgot poland and germany there . 
  also , [ close-up from the earlier picture on the statue on the parliament ; mother svea .

  [ the guardian has something to say about that : ** `` mh17 and its aftermath : ` ordinary russians are horrified and frightened ' '' ** ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/20/flight-mh17-reaction-moscow-russia-putin-ukraine-conspiracy-theories ), 
  that 's the swedes racial ability . 
  d'uh . 
  the people who are most focused on what 's wrong in a country is the politicians in the opposition . 
  try and ask them !, 
  in gymnasium , our religion teacher ( for the mandatory ` religion ' course ) doubled as both a swedish teacher and society-knowledge teacher ( samh\u00e4llskunskap ? ) . 
  i think they receive a short education about the course for permission to teach it , but do n't quote me on this , then they basically follow the curriculum . 
  we dedicated a couple of weeks each to buddhism , hinduism , judaism , christianity and islam . 
  of course now days , all teachers require a university-level education and they can specialize in specific topics . 
  in elementary school , religion is taught in the same class as geography , history and society ( we call it so ; society-orientated topics or samh\u00e4llsorienterade \u00c4mnen ) and often by the same teacher . 
  sounds like flies buzzing . 
  i feel this thing about heritage less tricky than it seems . 
  as a swede , i sure find it interesting to know where my ancestors came from . 
  i visited a relative who had done some researching into my family and he 'd come over a church text 500 years old in norrland which a distant relative of mine wrote . 
  my fathers father claims there 's some dutch/walloon blood in his side of the family , even though i 'm shining blond and blue-eyed . 
  so with that in mind i can claim to be of norrlandic/svealandic/dutch heritage . 
  the ancestors for americans is even less far removed then so , so i see no problems with an american finding interest in their half swedish , quarter finnish , quarter german heritage . 
  i can see why americans feel it 's more important . 
  i can safely say to have had family ties in sweden for at least 500 years , and humans have populated europe in at least 17 ' 000 years . 
  but an american can have had a relative just three generations ago emigrate from europe . 
  and which part they emigrated from in such a culturally diverse continent can be quite interesting . 
  many feel family and ancestry is important , it 's a basic human feature and is why the middle-ages were so dominated with family legacy and the `` family name '' . 
  of course , if you go back 20 generations i 'm probably related with all ethnic swedes ; 50 generations every ethnic european and probably a lot of the rest of the world . 
  go even further and i 'll find family ties to every living thing on this planet , animals , plants and bacteria . 
  that 's basic biology for ya . 
  so what do i feel about americans claiming heritage ? 
  i say go for it !, 
  i do n't mind in the slightest . 
  just stop . 
  ouch . 
  ** edit : ** for those who do n't know , the sinking of m/s estonia in 1995 is one of the worst maritime disasters in the 20th century , and the worst ever in the baltic , claiming 852 lives . 
  500 of them were swedish , i do n't know about the rest but definitely a majority of finns/estlanders . 
  one of those disasters which will never be forgotten . 
  we just copied it literally and call it * mjukvara * and * h\u00e5rdvara * . 
  though that might translate more directly to uncomfortable . 
  this article is somewhat uninformed and stupid , and i 'm saying that as a swede who wants to see our gripens exported . 
  it has already been posted and torn apart in / r/sweden for not having much intelligent or important to say . 
  now , with its battle-capabilities i would n't know , but i would n't trust reddits opinion on it . 
  however , two reasons for its lousy reputation known to me : 1 . 
  it 's very affordable . 
  people usually equate cheap with crap . 
  it got a lot of flak because of two highly publicized crashes with early prototypes . 
  not a record which stands out among its competitors , it had some major problems with it 's fly-by-wire systems which caused both crashes . 
  the difference though was that both were extremely publicizied and televised ; one crashed in the middle of stockholm ( no causalties ) while showing off maneuvers during the water festival which was witnessed by tens of thousands of spectators . 
  it made headlines for weeks in sweden .

  ) * ** edit : ** cudos for `` chairforce experts '' . 
  simply brilliant . 
  how about using district heating ? 
  you could use the spillheat from industries , garbage incineration and the waste from e.x woodworking to help alleviate the need for gas . 
  is it something commonly used in germany , or would it be undesirable ? 
  in sweden , district/long-distance heating ( fj\u00e4rrv\u00e4rme ) [ stands for about 50 % of all heating . 
  yay , fog of war . 
  or fog of almost war . 
  or whatever . 
  karin enstr\u00f6m is an officer in the swedish amphibious corps and holds the rank of captain . 
  she entered politics in 1994 , but i do believe she still retains her grade . 
  she is married to a lieutenant colonel in the same unit . 
  a guy further up said they had about the space of an a3 paper each . 
  though really fucking tight , it can work if you get some guys to really cram the doors closed . 
  maybe some were lying on top of eachother . 
  some were children . 
  either way , completely horrible . 
  yeah . 
  most people do n't know that saab stands for `` svenska aeroplan aktiebolaget '' , which means `` swedish aeroplane stock company . '', 
  this guy gets it . 
  check out hans roslings talks on ted . 
  * nederl\u00e4nderna * and * holland * is used interchangeably in day-to-day conversation i find .
