really ? 
  i 've never seen anyone wearing new balance ... 
  oh , i 'm not saying it 's wrong , i was just wondering how that conclusion was made as it goes against what i 've seen from other studies . 
  there are quite a few [ * \u00c5 * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%85_\\ ( disambiguation \\ ) #places ) in scandinavia ( there are even more smaller villages that did n't make that list ) . 
  we also have some * \u00d6 * in sweden . 
  yeah , but when ranking stuff you have to apply the same standard for all . 
  just because you apply a new detailed measurement to country a , does n't mean the actual coast longer than country b who just has a less detailed one . 
  every coast is infinitely long if you go into high enough detail , it 's what the entire coastline paradox is about . 
  to rank countries you must apply the same level of detail to all . 
  you can always go into higher detail and make the coast longer , what 's important is consistency in measurement . 
  that 's why i asked about the methodology of the ranking . 
  you 'll be fine . 
  lule\u00e5 's on the coast , a decent size in itself , and not that isolated . 
  i was talking more about the inland . 
  and many like it , it 's just not for me . 
  have fun !, 
   also we have the worlds second longest coastline . 
  by what methodology ? 
  cia 's world factbook and wri both rank you at 7 ( while not counting greenland ) . 
  their lists are a little different though . 
  they both say canada , russia , indonesia , and australia have longer coastline than you guys . 
  then cia has the philippines and japan where wri has the us and chile . 
  while [ it 's difficult to measure coastlines ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coastline_paradox ) , there are surely several countries that that have longer than you guys . 
  who is the only one to beat you in your ranking ? 
  the north , especially inland . 
  i love visiting , but i do n't really want to live there . 
  it 's just a bit too harsh for me and distances up there are too long . 
  i do n't know how this autograph collecting business works , but if it does n't matter if it 's printed , could n't you just google them and print it yourself ? 
  the members of our royal family have a praxis of not writing autographs or sending signed pictures . 
  do n't think the prime minister has any such praxis , but signing stuff probably is n't high on his list of priorities . 
  the northern lights has been observed as far south as the caribbean and sub-saharan africa , during the solar storm of 1859 . 
  i would n't exactly hold my breath for it that to happen anytime soon but we could possibly have had a similar event in 2012 , when there was a mass ejection of similar size but it missed earth by a week or two . 
  we probably do n't want it to happen with todays reliance on electric equipment though . 
  shh ... now people can see i made a ninja-edit . 
  it 's a bicycle brand !, 
  at least there is one here in sweden called that . 
  technically you can see them all over europe , it all depends on the solar activity . 
  the northern lights of the massive solar storm of 1859 was for example observed as far south as in sub-saharan africa . 
  but yeah , typically you have to be in the aptly named auroral zone . 
   routine check-ups are free for people under 21 that varies from county to county . 
  up until , and including , the year one turns 21 is the national minimum 2017 ( used to be 19 , will be 23 in two years iirc ) , but there are regions where it 's already 24 and such . 
  it 's not a perfect paradise , it 's far from a hellhole . 
  what it 's like really depends what you compare it too and in what aspects . 
  personally i think it 's pretty great , but as an outsider you should always be very cautious of `` grass is always greener '' - thinking . 
  it is very safe , there are expansive social security nets , and living standards are high . 
  but that 's hardly exclusive for the nordics , and the nordics are of course not void of problems . 
  no place is . 
  i do n't know where you 're from and what life experiences you have so it 's kind of difficult to paint a picture without something to compare it to . 
  it 's a very broad question you 're asking , it 'd help if you narrowed it down a bit . 
   `` hjemmebr\u00e6ndt '' ( homeburned ) in swedish the ` br\u00e4nt ' in `` hembr\u00e4nt '' really refers to an old word for `` distilled '' , not `` burned '' . 
  as you may have guessed the meaning for distillation came from the one for burning , but `` home-distilled '' would still probably be a more accurate translation . 
  even if most do only know `` br\u00e4nna '' by its burning meaning and would use `` destillera '' for distillation today . 
  now of course i do n't know it 's the same in danish , but i 'd kind of assume so . 
  surely this is the right answer . 
  massive amount of speakers in europe and of which do n't have the highest rates of english and/or spanish knowledge to my knowledge . 
  also offers limited intelligibility with some other slavic languages . 
  op asked for europe , not just eu . 
  counting all of europe i 'm pretty sure russian would have more native speakers who does n't speak neither english nor spanish . 
  not true . 
  all three languages are similar enough to be understood through exposure -- and to not be understood with too little exposure . 
  people of malm\u00f6 do in general understand danish better than norwegian according to [ this study ] ( http://portal.research.lu.se/ws/files/5905032/625654.pdf#page=79 ) among others . 
  it 's a myth that norwegian is `` in-between '' the other two , an thus easy to understand . 
  the other two have similarities norwegian does n't share too . 
  mutual intelligibility depends entirely on exposure . 
  * norwegians * do , in general , outperform us plebs when it comes to mutual intelligibility . 
  but that 's an argument for * not * learning norwegian as they 'll understand you anyway ... their language is not understood by everyone else . 
  in reality you should learn the language you 'd use . 
  if you have no intention of living or frequently visit either country , there 's no point anyway . 
  as a tourist people will speak english to you anyway out of convenience whether you like it or not . 
  if you 're learning the language solely to be able to speak to as many as possible , swedish would indeed be the best choice as it 's spoken by almost as many as the other two combined -- before even looking at foreign intelligibility . 
  but that really is a stupid reason to learn a language in a region where virtually everyone already speak english ...  even the dane if he speaks slowly . 
  i 'll have you know that i and many , * many * other swedes have zero problems understanding danish at full speed . 
  we 're not all stockholmers , mate . 
  man , i have the same experiences as / u/perrrperrr and i 'm far from the border region . 
  most people will speak swedish ( or some weird `` svorsk '' ) unless you speak very fast or inarticulate . 
  but people are conflict-shy and some might rather switch to english than ask you to slow down ? 
  but it 's really , * really * uncommon for people to switch to english in my experience . 
  but there is that instinctive mental efficiency switch where people switch to english to eliminate the teeniest of potential struggle . 
  same reason we have tendencies to switch to english when someone who 's learning , but not yet entirely proficient , at swedish speak . 
  it 's by no means to be rude , it 's just because it takes less effort . 
  but i can add that i 've had people switch to english with me in stockholm * when i spoke swedish * ... : / stockholm is ( on average , obviously does n't apply to everyone ) the worst in sweden when it comes to varieties of the scandinavian languages . 
  those poor souls live in a bubble and struggle with dialects of their own language !, 
  ok , thanks for the correction . 
  i thought that was the case but when i checked the dictionary it said [ * `` kugle af kogt eller stegt k\u00f8dfars '' * ] ( http://ordnet.dk/ddo/ordbog?query=k%c3%b8dboller ) and i did n't want to give any false information . 
  the point still stands , really it 's even more so then . 
  afaik ` frikadeller ' and ` k\u00f8dboller / k\u00f6ttbullar ' can pretty much refer to the opposite things in denmark and sweden . 
  * frikadeller * are boiled meatballs here , regular pan-fried meatballs are called * k\u00f6ttbullar * . 
  in denmark * frikadeller * are pan-fried , while * k\u00f8dboller * is a general term that can also refer to the boiled variety . 
  not sure what that entails , but his bears are cute and cuddly so i 'm just going to assume it 's pleasant . 
  thanks !, 
  i know , it was what op was talking about . 
  of course you have larger stuff than us . 
  sweden is almost four times smaller than alaska alone , what do you expect ? 
  but , hey , * padjelanta-sarek-stora sj\u00f6fallet * is 1,2 % of sweden 's area , * wrangell -- st. 
  elias * is only 0,35 % of the us ' . 
  and it provides 545 square meters per capita , compared to * wrangell -- st. 
  elias ' * measly 104 . 
  we clearly win this one too . 
  yeah i know , everglades was also a bit like that . 
  just fyi , we also have some big stuff .
