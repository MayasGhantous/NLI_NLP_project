it 's there : `` gro\u00dfbritannien '' . 
  the two sources you gave me both stated that you ca n't compare sweden 's reported rapes with other countries . 
  [ there is n't a general consensus about what the rape statistics shows . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crime_in_sweden#sex_crimes ) that is a fact . 
  this is also completely unimportant in this debate . 
  what 's relevant here is that you claim that swedes are subject to a lot of rapes because of immigration . 
  i 'd like to see a source supporting that . 
  you 're saying sweden has a lot of immigrants and a lot of rapes . 
  even if we assume both of those are true , you have n't proved any connection between the two statements . 
  edit : typo, 
   so , you 're saying a woman who is repeatedly raped only counts as one rape ? 
  so merely a stat ? 
  what ? 
  you quoted a source , i quoted parts of your source [ you left out to make it seem like the source completely backs what you 're stating ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cherry_picking_%28fallacy%29 ) . 
   the way you disregard rape and sexual assault is appalling . 
  why ca n't you accept that sweden has a disgusting problem with rape ? 
  i agree with you , we have a problem with rape . 
  every rape is one to much . 
  i am however annoyed by the way you use sources and rhetoric . 
   if we do n't count the swedish national council and apparently your definition of rape , i like this definition of rape , every act is one offence . 
  seems reaonable . 
   sweden still has one of the highest rates of sexual violence in the entire world . 
  how do you know this ? 
  the sources you have provided both says the statistics from sweden ca n't be compared with other countries as sweden reports rapes differently . 
  do you have other sources that confirms your thesis ? 
  i do n't like islam . 
  i do n't like christianity . 
  i do n't like any religion . 
  i will say that out loud and i do . 
  but i wo n't stop immigrants seeking a better life from coming here . 
  depending on how well we are able to integrate them here we should prioritise those in great need . 
  if we are n't able to help them sufficiantly and it 's rather safe to send them back i guess we should . 
  i do n't dislike muslims , i do n't dislike christians . 
  i think they could be as good citizens as any swede if given good education ( which as of now we are n't really providing , unfortunatly , but that 's a question of school politics ) . 
  keep cherry picking from your sources . 
   ** the number of unreported cases seems to be particularly high in finland ** : an estimated 2 -- 10 percent of all rapes are reported , compared to around 25 percent in denmark . 
  also :  the countries ' criminal statistics are not comparable . 
  apart from the differences in the size of their populations , there are also different modes of recording rapes that are reported to the police . 
  in denmark and norway the statistics record ** cases ** ( generally one case for one victim ) , while in sweden the statistics record reported ** acts ** of rape . 
  if , for example , a woman is repeatedly raped by the same man during the course of one day , each rape will be registered as a separate offence . 
  this is also true for cases where a woman is raped by a group of men . 
  hence , crime statistics in denmark and norway show how many people have reported rape , while the swedish statistics show how many acts of rape have been reported . 
  thereby giving credibility to what i quoted before :  the swedish national council for crime prevention claims that it is not `` possible to evaluate and compare the actual levels of violent crimes ... between countries '' , but that in any case the high numbers are explained by a broader legal definition of rape than in other countries , and an effort to register all suspected and repeated rapes . 
  it asserts that comparisons based on victim surveys place sweden at an average level among european nations . 
  `` probably '' . 
  i 've looked inside myself and my opinion on this is that all humans , immigrant or not , could and would contribute to society if they received the help they need . 
  integration is difficult . 
  but i believe it is the right way to go . 
  help as many as we can and help them help themselves contribute . 
  i believe the problems seen in immigrant dense areas is a result of bad planning and integration programs , not because of their culture . 
  the situation would n't be any different if we put swedes in rather isolated areas in denmark , discriminated them and did n't give them jobs because of their ethnical origin . 
  i 'll go to bed now . 
  this discussion has n't changed either of our opinions but i guess that 's the case in most debates on this topic . 
  good night . 
  i do n't feel better . 
  i 'm so sad , seeing all these comments about the `` problem '' with immigration and how the immigrants are supposedly ruining sweden following a post about how 16 000 swedes expressed their opinion on racism . 
  it 's just sad . 
  ok sorry , it is [ islamophobia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamophobia#racism ) . 
  do you feel better ? 
  how about you read your own source ? 
   the swedish national council for crime prevention claims that it is not `` possible to evaluate and compare the actual levels of violent crimes ... between countries '' , but that in any case the high numbers are explained by a broader legal definition of rape than in other countries , and an effort to register all suspected and repeated rapes . 
  it asserts that comparisons based on victim surveys place sweden at an average level among european nations . 
  you can criticise islam all you want , but generalising muslims and wanting them to have lesser rights than the ethnical group of the country is racism . 
  might be a bad source , i was on my phone and just copied the first link i saw with the story . 
  the thing is that it 's really not a matter of sources , him calling immigrants parasites is on tape and a fact . 
  why should i make a difference between what they say and what they do ? 
  i 'd say what they actually do is more important than what they say . 
  i could vote for the idea the party is built on , but in the end it is what they do that matters . 
  so what you are saying is that there 's danish people , and there 's `` danish '' people . 
  i 'd say that 's segregation , and from history we learn that segregation is never good . 
  a perfect example of racism . 
  the muslims immigrating to european countries want to escape this culture and have a better life in their new country . 
  why else would they want to migrate ? 
   please use arguments instead of strawmen , ad hominem and other fallacies . 
   borgarsvin . 
  could you provide a trustworthy source that proves that immigrants costs more than they provide and commit more crimes than ethnical swedes ? 
  even if this would be the case , we dump the immigrants in poor areas outside of the cities and refuses to give them jobs . 
  of course there will be crime . 
  and sure , put the criminals in prison , but do n't draw the conclusion that muslims are ruining europe because of a few peoples crimes . 
  http://expo.se/2013/sds-vice-partiledare-kallade-invandrare-for-parasiter_6266.html this is by the vice president ( correct term ? ) . 
  sure , it was around a decade ago , but the fact that \u00c5kesson have him on such a high position and ekeroth who threatened a immigrants with an iron pipe is still in riksdagen even though \u00c5kesson har proclaimed a `` zero tolerance '' towards racism are prime examples of their real opinions . 
  of course it is n't party policy . 
  they are n't that stupid . 
  there is a audio recording of how they speak of the `` zero tolerance '' within the party . 
  i 'm on my phone so i ca n't provide a link right now , but i think you 'll get a result if you search youtube for `` hur sd talar om nolltoleransen '' . 
  they say that people should n't be stupid and say inappropriate stuff in the media and that they should choose their words carefully . 
  jimmy and sd have numerous times spoken of muslims as parasites and that they are ruining sweden and europe . 
  i do n't understand how this is translated into only wanting to `` limit immigration '' . 
  it is obvious racism . 
   the edward snowden scandal shows us that europe needs its own autonomous security capabilities what ? 
  the whole point of this * scandal * was to make people aware of the us spying so we can try to make them stop , not introduce more spying programs . 
  for fuck 's sake . 
  i detest ( most ) politicians . 
  [ sw\u00c4rje !, 
  the difference is that by simple logic , we can assume a relationship between having little money and crime . 
  the same is not true for having a specific skin colour . 
  white people in poor neighbourhoods are as likely to commit crime as others . 
  there not being as many white people in these neighbourhoods is not caused by the colour of their skin . 
  [ so much crime ... ] ( https://www.bra.se/bra/brott-och-statistik/brottsutvecklingen.html ) poor people do more crime , not very surprising . 
  or you could simply look at an equal-area projection like [ this one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tobler_hyperelliptical_projection#/media/file:tobler_hyperelliptical_projection_sw.jpg ) or [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:goode_homolosine_projection_sw.jpg#/media/file:goode_homolosine_projection_sw.jpg ) .
