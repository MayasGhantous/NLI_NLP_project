  it 's usually used to ironically refer to other people with meme-ish names , so since i 'm swedish someone could respond to my comment with * t. sven svensson * ( a stereotypical swedish sounding name ) , or in typical 4chan fashion * t. ahmed abdullah mohammed * ( a stereotypical arabic name since we 're overun by muslims ) . 
  usually depending on the political leanings of my comment and the person responding . 
   well it 's not like putting troops directly on russia borders is so peaceful . 
  well i certainly would n't call it aggresive , russia has some * very * recent history with their neighbouring countries , they 're the aggressors in todays political climate . 
  if anything , nato troops on the border is defensive , it 's the whole point of the organization . 
  if russia had a better relationship with the rest of europe and did n't pursue such a hostile foreign policy , them having troops on their own border probably would n't be such a big deal . 
  but putin seems very eager to keep walking that route , and so nato should respond accordingly . 
   what peskov meant is that it 's not ` appropriate ' for there to be anti-aggression pacts or alliances with countries that should aim for peace between each other in the modern era . 
  that 's a nice sentiment and all , and in an ideal world russia and the west * should * aim for more cooperation and integration . 
  but as long as russia continues to act aggressively towards europe and putin is stuck in his ussr mindset , that just should n't happen . 
  you 're calling me a child after you left a bunch of ignorant comments about nato , which you quite clearly know very little about . 
   they are still not reaching it , despite promising they would . 
  they did n't promise anything , nato countries signed an agreement that they 'd * try * to up their spending to 2 % ** by ** 2024 . 
   obligation this is false , at least read up a bit on nato before you spout drivel , please . 
  since you 're curious , there are no stats for 2016 yet , but here are the top 10 for 2015 : ** boys ** : 1 . 
  william 2 . 
  liam 4 . 
  elias 6 . 
  hugo 7 . 
  oliver 8 . 
  axel 10 . 
  vincent ** girls ** : 1 . 
  elsa 2 . 
  alice 3 . 
  maja 4 . 
  saga 5 . 
  lilly 7 . 
  olivia 8 . 
  wilma 10 . 
  julia i noticed that boy names in the last 5 or so years have become more and more americanized ( in my opinion ) half of the boy names does n't even work that well in swedish . 
  the girl names are still fairly typical though , many of them have remained popular for 10-20 years , elsa is still at the top since frozen though . 
  i 'm 100 % sure i 'd fit your definition of a swede and i 've actually done this with my friend while drunk , it 's fucking dumb , but it 's not new . 
  i was doing this with my friends 10 years ago , we 're as swedish as they come . 
  if you really think this is something new or unique , or even remotely like fucking baghdad , i do n't know what to tell you . 
   class is also used to refer to an age group . 
  for example , the 3rd grade class can be made up of several smaller individual classes . 
  are you sure that 's the case in france then ? 
  certainly does n't work that way here . 
  remember , not everywhere is the same as the us . 
  i mean , there are churches in every small town/village here as well , but barely anyone is religious . 
  and even if you are n't religious does n't mean you ca n't appreciate churches for their cultural/historical/aesthetic value , i go to church events a couple of times every year but i 'm fairly anti-theism . 
   the so called fake news bogeyman that came to prominence after trump won , but not any time before that . 
  there were plenty of articles debunking whatever ridiculous claim breitbart made every week before the election , or whatever made up statistic from trumps mouth . 
  but some people did n't take it seriously because they assumed that no one else would ever take such absolute drivel seriously to begin with . 
  turns out , plenty of people did , and now trump is president-elect , bannon and breitbart has more power than they ever should have been allowed to get and a bunch of people believe hillary and podesta are literally raping and eating children in pizza parlors . 
  and are willing to fire shots over it as well . 
  it 's obviously a serious issue , when so many fools can be so easily misled . 
  except here in sweden eastern europeans commit about as much crime as muslims do , but i doubt people would claim they feel like there are too many of them here , mostly because they just do n't stick out and the media does n't bombard you with news about them every day . 
  the question asked was `` what do you think of _____ in our country ? '', 
  if it was about the opinion of the government of israel i 'm sure the % would be quite a bit higher here . 
  and if you cut out the suicides and gang violence in europe most countries would see even further decreases as well . 
  many flights do n't allow you to take surstr\u00f6mming with you on board because it 's classified as a potential bio hazard . 
  i already am . 
  i 'm very much in favour of kicking out the eastern european countries and have made this known to my representatives , but the odds of that happening are obviously very small so instead i 'm in favour of us leaving the union . 
   i want these entitled people out of my country . 
  and i want entitled countries out of my union , hopefully we both get what we want . 
  trump fanatics call themselves centipedes because of some stupid trump video released like a year ago . 
   2 % was the agreement by 2020 , so it does n't exactly matter what their spending is right now . 
  ca n't exactly yell at someone for not getting it done when there is still plenty of time left . 
  while i agree that the nordic countries are indeed very good , both in statistics and in reality , just do n't start believing that it 's some sort of perfect utopia . 
  we have plenty of problems , large and small , just like any other country . 
  prescription drug abuse , antidepressants overuse , lack of affordable housing , increasing wealth inequality , increased ghettoization , drug overdoses , lack of nurses/medical professionals , falling school grades and lack of teachers , police corruption etc. 
  of course almost none of these are unique to us , and are certainly larger in scale in some other countries , but it 's still a cause for concern . 
  even just the latest ongoing it scandal here in sweden shows that the government can be just as incompetent as elsewhere . 
  although i have to say that a lot of people here are a bit naive and melodramatic , a lot of our issues are barely issues at all , and some people still act like the apocalypse is near . 
  many of the immigrants i know think swedes are a bit silly getting worked up over issues that are utterly irrelevant . 
  one of our biggest nationwide controversies last year that got people worked up was `` feminist snow plowing '' , that should tell you that people are a bit sheltered about the real issues in the world . 
  either way life here is very good and i 'm incredibly grateful that i was born here and all the things i have access to , hopefully you 'll be able to move here in the future if you have the opportunity to do so , you 're more than welcome . 
   does the polish plumbers have a religion that dictate anti-democratic values , hate speech , racism , etc ? 
  i 'd say yes , although it 's more their polish culture than their religion . 
  even the roman buildings need quite a bit of maintenance , when i was in rome a couple of years ago half the pantheon was covered in scaffolding , and since it 's been in continuous use since its construction it 's ( almost ) always been properly maintained . 
  many ancient constructions like the colosseum or various aqueducts have had extensive restoration work done on them throughout the centuries , continuing to this day . 
  also many ancient structures are fairly simple ; thick walls , large straight cut stones , simple reliefs etc. 
  gothic cathedrals or medieval castles are pretty complex and/or vastly more detailed in comparison . 
  yep , seems everytime i 've visited an old historical building around europe there 's scaffolding and cranes next to them . 
  hardly surprising though , these old buildings need a lot of maintenance , my father 's a carpenter specialized in fixing old castle/church interiors and he 's always busy , i 'd imagine the exterior is even more work . 
  heard the cologne cathedral has some work being done on it every single day to keep it pristine , and that 's `` only '' ~ 130 years old , probably the same for most old cathedrals . 
   the shitstorm that erupted over this is a bit exaggerated . 
  it is , but mostly because the full scope of the information that was ` leaked ' is not yet fully known , so everyone is speculating wildly , and also because it highlights the governments incompetence once again so everyone is jumping on it , either to attack them ( rightfully ) or to defend them . 
  the actual information itself is n't * that * damaging so far . 
  i 've seen articles like `` names and addresses of every swedish citizen leaked !, 
  no one is safe !, 
  '' , which is untrue because nowhere near every swedish citizen was part of the registry , but also because that 's public information here already anyway . 
  the infrastructure information is also easily available , like road dimensions , railway and bridge data or condition etc , and the various military information is n't fully kept in this list either , the army handles the majority of that stuff on their own , putting it out of harms way . 
  the most harmful would probably be any classified police lists , like special forces/s \u00e4po or witness protection , but from what i 've seen it is n't an actual list of their identities but more like very broad information but could be linked to various people with proper investigations . 
  the handling of the aftermath and the ludicrously pathetic `` punishment '' of those responsible is easily the biggest bullshit about this whole thing . 
  we * do * have life sentences in sweden , however you can only be sentenced to a set amount of time like 10-20ish years to begin with . 
  once that 's done you 'll be evaluated and if you 're not fit to reenter society you 'll be kept until that changes , in some cases indefinitely . 
   the data breach exposed the * names , photos and home addresses * of millions of swedish citizen except for photos this is already public information though . 
  the relevant information that was leaked was the police and military related subjects . 
  there are multiple websites in sweden that provides all those in easily searchable databases just via names for free . 
  we even have a couple of ` google-maps-like ' services where you can click a random house and find out the address , who lives there , how old they are , their phone numbers and in some cases their place of work . 
  why should germany care about eastern europe ? 
  it seems ee blames everything wrong with the world these days on big bad germany and f\u00fchrer merkel `` controlling '' the eu . 
  there 's no solidarity , poland and hungary seem more than happy to pull down the iron curtain once again to avoid scary brown people or `` western-liberal-homosex-democracy '' . 
  and i say let them , russia is not a threat to western europe , if they do n't want to be on good terms with the eu , then they can be on good terms with russia instead , they already have more in common anyway . 
  but let me quess you 're against a surveillance state and arresting citizens for pre-crime as well ? 
  huh , i read that article but i must 've missed where it said it was the governments doing ? 
  strange , could you quote that part for me ? 
  \\* yawn * wow , so original ... did you think of that all by yourself ?
