yeah i think serb media fabricated this news story . 
  i did n't hear of this untill i red serbian news . 
  they can closely watch basketball finals , space shuttle launch too . 
  does n't mean they get to do anything of it . 
  there is something called dayton agreement that forbids the separation . 
  \u00c7\u0131f\u0131t, 
  \u00c7\u0131f\u0131t , \u00c7\u0131fut , ( hr . 
  \u0106ifuti ) is a turkish word for jews in turkish . 
  many bosnians / serbs use it to call hercegovina croats or albanians for \u0106ifuti . 
  google the word \u0106ifuti . 
  get tand\u017eara from tavan . 
  what if it was assyrian . 
  title would n't read : christian model , 24 . 
  they had no problems deporting them 20 years ago .

  ** people that advocate that beating your wife is acceptable should be in prison or not in europe . 
  ** so we should deport sean connery ? 
  or maybe just muslim ones since it 's only muslim crime to beat women . 
  this guy is a retired political analyst who is not particularly famous or has any following to begin with , not only is he not a `` kuwaiti official '' but he is also not declaring anything . 
  he is merely arguing in defense of the government 's lack of refugee intake . 
  serbs have a saying `` dark as bulgarian '' meaning you are some kind of african/european tribe . 
  to me as a former refugee this sounds fucked up . 
  there is a milion of refugees in turkish camps and some of them would like to move to europe . 
  but europe is accepting refugges breaking the law and trasspassing in to other countries . 
  why are people accepting law breaking refugges over the one who are fallowing the rules . 
  i know my self that we waited in the camp ga\u0161inci in croatia , we got asylum pappers from sweden and we moved there . 
  i am all for refugee asylum , but do n't give law breakers better deals then law abiding people .

  single bullet cost from $ 1.50 in syria . 
  saudi arabia pays for that . 
  israel turkey saudi arabia are against asad . 
  asad is with iran and russia . 
  your point is stupid and too easy to debate . 
  so if serb from bosnia wins nobel prise then it 's serbian and not bosnian win ? 
  if sulejmani scores for serbia then award goal to albania and not serbia . 
  so tesla is american then ? 
  now if vatican makes 1/4 of a car then they can get the 1th place . 
  bosnia / monte negro . 
  that mountin lake ( trnova\u010dko jezero ) is at the border in monte negro . 
  croatia / bosnia is wrong . 
   what used to be a great country i would rather live in cardboard box in malm\u00f6 then a house in slovenia . 
  they are maybe thinking of french cars .

  usa created the isis . 
  turkey should open 24/7 free flights to usa for syrians , since you started this clusterfuck . 
  or to the ranch of george bush . 
  enjoy that cheep gas . 
  switzerland , what makes a good man go neutral ?

  smat person with a kid would seek no trouble . 
  they ca n't do anything because they are slaves of nationalism and nationalist parties . 
  any anti goverment action is seen as anti national . 
  they paint them as destroyers of republika srpska or separatists . 
  nationalists have a grip on general population and they are winning . 
  do you really want catholic serbs ? 
  you are thinking of monte negro . 
  bosnia will join when the ruling elite finds a way to escape prison time for their coruption . 
  so 25 - 30 years from now when they are dead . 
  there are immigrants and there are refugees . 
  ones are forced to leave their homes , the other ones pay to get to europe . 
  these are refugees we are talking about and they would be happy to live anywhere else . 
  you should not force other countries to make same mistakes as your own country . 
  why should a country take in immigrants if they ca n't handle them ?
