  everyone remembers bosnia now , when it suits them . 
  america did in fact save bosnia and bosnjaks . 
  local drug dealer earns more money then most of the neighbourhood . 
  always fascinated with some arab and turk mentality . 
  why are you turks and arabs in europe when you do not respect country you live in . 
  you live there but foster ideals of your home country and would not move back to your country even if they forced you with a gun .

  fueld by backstabing croats . 
  i heard he called the pie sirnica not burek with cheese .

  nothing to do with the refugees . 
  in 2011 malm\u00f6 was judged to have 16 criminal gangs , many with roots in the balkans , iran , iraq , lebanon and sweden .

  according to iran 's codes of dressing all women , either muslim or non-muslim , of any social rank and from any country , should wear `` hijab '' while staying inside the iranian territories .

  when i was in croatia and i got up everyone else also got up . 
  why are every immigrant crime upvoted so fast ? 
  there is a fireman who raped 2 girls at the same time .

  swedes have alot of kids them selves and kids have a lot of parents . 
  montenegro is quite stable for the region . 
  i doubt they would have accomplished anything . 
  not even if they have sent a train with `` montenegro is serbia '' plostered on in it in 200 different languages also hamo vidi mu glave . 
  there are some people that take politicians seriously . 
  problem is that a lot of serb nationalist will believe this . 
  you can warm up here https://www.reddit.com/r/indianpeoplefacebook/top/,

  montenegrian police is for the people . 
  politicians have their own security . 
  you probably stole that watch . 
  by mentality slovenia is balkan . 
  and she will run away from hungary to germany or norway as soon as she gets the chance . 
  it 's because austria is not that big on wind power too and slovenia likes to copy everything austria . 
  it connected two sides , there was a minor reason . 
  `` central europe '' , where the fuck is central on my compas ? 
  draw the line at germany,

  serbs created republika srpska by ethnic cleansing and killing of muslim and croats . 
  and now even they do n't want to live in that `` republic '' . 
  half of them migrated to europe and serbia . 
  if you go to srpska most houses are empty and at summer time they have cars infront with foringe licence plates and serbian . 
  manjaca , doboj , teslic , prijedor , all of east bosnia all half empty . 
  no wonder muslim make up more then 50 % of bosnia today . 
  soon it will be more . 
  serbs are ok with ruling over sandzak and kosovo but do n't wa n't democracy when they are minority . 
  this is a very important map / s, 
  orange buffoon will fix that soon . 
  must feel good not having to deal with separatists nowdays . 
  in bosnian it 's belaj show . 
  many states would consider a threat a violent offense .

  make them pay . 
  everything . 
  funny how this map an map of people without the soul are same . 
  it 's not just germany . 
  fallow the lead of component makers .
