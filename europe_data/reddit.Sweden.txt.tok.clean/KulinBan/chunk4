  diesel eu regulators are people from those companies .

  kla was largely funded by the albanian diaspora in europe and the united states , [ 27 ] proceeds from narcotics trafficking donated by albanian drug lords nevertheless formed a significant portion of the kla 's income . 
  when the us state department listed the kla as a terrorist organization in 1998 , it noted its links to the heroin trade , [ 28 ] and a briefing paper for the us congress stated : `` we would be remiss to dismiss allegations that between 30 and 50 percent of the kla 's money comes from drugs . 
  '' [ 29 ] by 1999 , western intelligence agencies estimated that over $ 250m of narcotics money had found its way into kla coffers . 
  [ 30 ] after the nato bombing of 1999 , kla-linked heroin traffickers again began using kosovo as a major supply route ; in 2000 , an estimated 80 % of europe 's heroin supply was controlled by kosovar albanians . 
  [ 31 ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kosovo_liberation_army#kosovo_war yep google some more , you might learn something . 
  actually you do n't since you state that kosovo was fighting for independence with foringe aid . 
  if you were fallowing that war you could see kla dressed in all from german uniforms to american . 
  no common wapon or uniform in a group of kla soldiers . 
  albanians from diaspora were buying and sending uniforms and wapons . 
  no heavy wapons , no tanks , mortars . 
  prove me wrong . 
  it was too easy for serbs to fight them . 
  looking at that source above it 's not the case . 
    do you think sheep herders in kosovo suddenly got weapons and money to fight for independence ? 
  you clearly do n't know what you are talking about . 
  i think this is good for bosnia since they could get coridor to the international waters too .

  the conflict rapidly spread and came to involve several balkan states and great powers , which eventually forced the ottomans to cede administration of the country to austria-hungary through the treaty of berlin ( 1878 ) . 
  [ 136 ] after the uprising in herzegovina ( 1875 -- 78 ) the population of bosnian muslims and orthodox christians in bosnia decreased . 
  the orthodox christian population ( 534,000 in 1870 ) decreased by 7 percent while muslims decreased by a third . 
  [ 137 ] the austrian census in 1879 recorded altogether 449,000 muslims and 496,485 orthodox christians in bosnia and herzegovina . 
  the losses were 245,000 muslims and 37,500 orthodox christians .

  the total amount of land taken away by the first agrarian reform in 1918 and 1919 was divided among 249,518 serbian families , among whom were settlers , colonists outside bosnia and herzegovina and especially volunteers of the salonika front . 
  if we consider that every family , on average had four members , we can infer that almost one million serbian inhabitants became land owners and so became significantly wealthy . 
  the agrarian reform of 1918 and 1919 was primarily aimed against members of the islamic faith , due to the revival of the st. sava ideology `` one nation , one religion in one state . '', 
  for this reason , the agrarian reform was conducted in a genocidal manner against muslim land owners in macedonia , kosovo and metohija , sandzak and montenegro . 
  a total of 231,098 hectares of land was taken away from them and divided amongst 48,267 serbian families . 
  if we apply the above methodology that the average family had four members , it can be deduced that almost 200 thousand members of serbian families received land . 
  in this way , the proprietary and ethnic structure of the population was significantly altered . 
  the process of emigration of citizens from this territory and immigration into turkey was parallel with the colonization of serbian citizens from montenegro , bosnia and herzegovina , dalmatia , lika , banija and kordun, 
  only reason serbs had any majoirty was because when kingdom of yugoslavia formed the ruling serbs move people from kosovo and serbia into bosnia and a lot of bosnjaks moved to turkey .
