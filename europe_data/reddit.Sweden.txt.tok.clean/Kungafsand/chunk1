oh no , it is still very much illegal to do it . 
  but people really enjoy that it is being done anyway . 
  what was that ? 
  i could n't hear you over the sound of . . oh.ouh.the toile . . shut up !, 
  i think the law states that if a swede walks over to denmark across the frozen strait , a dane can legally beat the swede with a wooden stick . 
  * `` sweden is selfish impatient and a little insecure . 
  if you ca n't handle sweden at it 's worst you do n't deserve us at our best . 
  '' * - swedish chef, 
  if you came here during summer i 'm not surprised :p considering the long sun hours we have up here . 
  everything in that picture bothers me . 
  they are our sworn enemies . 
  brutal savages . 
  their way of life is a totem to chaos . 
  the world is not big enough for both of us . 
  the moose cavalry is ready and the stars are aligned . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ but ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ secretly ^ ^ ^ ^ love ^ ^ ^ ^ them, 
  do n't forget angeles bermudez-svankvist . 
  [ haunting my dreams ] ( http://isabellestahl.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/1_buka.jpg ), 
  might be because the amount of recycling varies from city to city . 
  where i live now we have two large bins outside to separate everything in . 
  but where my parents live , they do n't have to recycle much at all . 
  other than batteries and glass , they pretty much dump everything in the same bin . 
  so i guess my parents might be the cause of that missing 1 %, 
  we do that . 
  never seen blue though : o, 
  you can have the nice weather back when we are done using it . 
  sounds great !, 
  until you factor in the ridiculous amount of mosquitoes . 
  the clothes are there because it 's lidl , they have all kinds of shit in their stores . 
  it usually rotates so if you come there a few weeks after there might be some toasters next to a lawnmower or something . 
  lidl is a special low price chain . 
  let 's just say you could have picked a better store . 
  believe it or not , that was actually in the script . 
  british . 
  when i was in school tape recorders was still around . 
  we had a book and listened to these sound bits , and everyone on these tapes had the stereotypical british accent . 
  but yeah , not many people actually picked up that accent . 
  i 've sort of done it ( slightly ) in recent years . 
  [ well , this is a classic ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzhombhboeg ), 
  `` thank you and sorry europe '', 
  seems like i have to watch a rerun of this with grahams commentary . 
  good job germany !, 
  nnneeeeejjj, 
  it 's tradition !, 
  listen to fabulous sparkling pop songs . 
  then vote . 
  then listen to the winner . 
  the fedora gives it away, 
  those eyes can end wars, 
  they have spare ones . 
  do n't fool yourself . 
  we all do !, 
  romania 2 . 
  romania 3 . 
  romania 4 . 
  romania, 
  care to share it ? 
  damn, 
  that swiss guy evens out the average age, 
  fabio of iceland, 
  all wars just ended . 
  this is what it 's all about !, 
  they will present the russian votes later . 
  every time the background dancers line up behind the lead singer . 
  my guilty pleasure !, 
  yeah . 
  but there are several ones more . 
  in general , flying within europe is rather cheap . 
  bus tickets are cheaper and takes about the same time as a train , depending on where you go . 
  hell , even flying can be cheaper than taking the train . 
  i have watched that video enough times to be able to sing along . 
  i have no idea what it is i 'm singing but man , i love that woman . 
  i had meatballs , potatoes and lingonberry jam . 
  and today i 'm having the leftovers . 
  surprised ? 
  i do n't think you know what communism/socialism means . 
  if you have an ikea nearby you could buy some there . 
  probably contain some horse but still . 
  soon we will reach the conclusion that there are no other types of meat other than horse meat , and it has been a conspiracy all along . 
  [ party accordingly !,

  i hope to see floorball in one of the coming olympics if all goes right . 
  2024 i 've heard . 
  [ i sure hope so . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_floorball_championships ), 
  hungary get 's my vote for the most creative one . 
  what is that even , a yam or a potato ? 
  we do n't learn to speak danish . 
  it 's very close , and i can understand some of it especially if i 'm reading , but i can only speak it when i 'm really drunk . 
  i would probably do better with norwegian . 
  i think everyone does . 
  that last part is probably one of the best things about going to ikea, 
  there is an episode of top gear when they race in the basement of the * palace of the people *, 
  i may have giggled . 
  that 's why he is making the comparison . 
  of course we have art programs for high school here . 
  the `` estet '' programs in sweden include , dance , art , music , drama and media . 
  the only complaint i really have is the opening hours . 
  if madagascar is as hard to occupy as it is to infect it with a deadly virus , i would n't count on it . 
  i 'm not sure i understand what you are trying to say .
