they are a city-state inside the country of china you 're making an arbitrary disctintion here between country and state . 
  a state is a state . 
  whether it is a city or a large country is irrelevant . 
  taiwan is indeed a state and it conducts its affairs as such . 
   it 'll never join the united nations except it was a founding member of the un . 
  it was kicked out * after * the fact , in 1971 , as part of nixon 's rapproachment to china . 
  but that technicality does n't materially impact taiwan 's efforts to make diplomacy as a sovereign state around the world . 
  it has de facto embassies all over the planet . 
  i 'm not sure how this is new . 
  merkel and the gang have said for months that they wo n't accept refugees from the balkans . 
  i would also argue that the countries selected among the non-eu states are very arbitrary . 
  living in pakistan today is often as dangerous , sometimes more so , than living in iraq and especially afghanistan . 
  eritrea is a military dictatorship but so is belarus . 
  would germany blindly accept people and/or dissidents from belarus ? 
  i do n't see that right now . 
  overall , merkel is trying to massively increase asylum immigration under the pretense of `` showing our humanity '' but her own statistics show that there is no real pattern here . 
  and if you just want to bring in more people to nation that has the [ lowest birth rate ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32929962 ) in the world , it makes a lot more sense to bring them in from culturally close countries . 
  i do n't care what the leftists who hate people from balkans here say , but nobody is going to make the case that serbs or albanians are harder to integrate than eritreans or iraqis and escape massive mockery and derision . 
  well done , meeting facts with ad hominem attacks . 
  are n't you a sight to behold ? 
  i heard the leftists in hungary are basically really unpopular ( i wonder why ? ) . 
  well at least they can count on support from random redditor from latvia . 
   but foreign investment and easy foreign loans are fine , right ? 
  why do people keep bringing up this idiotic argument ? 
  serious question . 
  foreign investment can be taken back just as fast as it has been pouring in . 
  you just stop investing . 
  done !, 
  you ca n't `` take back '' a large 3rd world population once it is settled . 
  just look at my country . 
  these decisions are essentially irreversible unless you 're going for large scale ethnic cleansing , which is n't exactly the democratic europe we want . 
  so again : why do you try to equate these issues when one is temporary and the other is permanent ? 
  it 's an idiotic and incredibly stupid argument from start to finish . 
   do you really think tesla built something the armies of engineers in germany and japan could n't build ? 
  you 're missing the point here . 
  the co-founder of tesla , marc tarpenning , [ has said ] ( https://youtu.be/hf15nmnayxk?t=16m20s ) that in the last 30 years , most of the car companies have outsourced most of their car parts . 
  the only thing that differentiates the car companies is their ice ( internal combustion engine ) . 
  most of those companies have decades of sunk costs in those ices and which is why they are probably going to move a lot slower than even someone in the ev industry like martin estimated , a point which he later makes . 
  you do n't ditch hundreds of billions of euros of business into ices overnight , especially when you have entire engineering teams built around these legacy , 100 + year technologies . 
  further , an ev is more than its engine . 
  think of how tesla continually updates its vehicle . 
  just recently they added piloted automated driving . 
  there 's still no other ev either in production or planned which matches that same ground-up digital-first mentality . 
  why ? 
  because tesla built their model from the ground up , instead of trying to shoe-horn it into an old legacy model . 
  the big car companies from germany and japan do n't have that luxury . 
  if they abandon their old models , they will bankrupt their companies . 
  if they try to fight the ev battle with faulty assumptions , you get the mediocre toasters on wheels that they are currently offering . 
  the only thing stopping tesla from cannibalising them is the fact that tesla is supply-constrained . 
  the model x is sold out all the way to h2 2016 already , and it 's not even launched yet . 
  now think how popular the model 3 would be compared to the crappy prius or half-assed e-golf attempts from vw . 
  that 's why we 're all waiting for the model 3 . 
  i hate to admit it , sometimes you even make me [ jealous ] ( http://ecomento.com/2015/08/06/norway-all-new-cars-electric-by-2025/ ) . 
  kisses , your big brother . 
  well , it 's okay , because like everyone else in sweden i can never understand a word of danish even if you can understand us . 
  that linguistic power differential is real , bro . 
  so which other european countries would you classify as ` southern but not mediterranean ' ? 
  or did you make up a category just now for portugal alone ? 
  oh , do n't blame the polish , anglo man . 
  what they are doing is still better than allowing the wholesale theft of an entire industry like you have . 
  how many of `` your '' car companies are owned by native brits again ? 
  please remind us , 
  and coming faster to market . 
  thanks for free laugh :d, 
  `` protester '' seems a bit too neutral as a description . 
  those jackboots and military gear suggest a fairly far-right gathering . 
  anyone knows that flag on the right ? 
  is it neo-nazi or at least used in those contexts ? 
  but the question was n't about what is news , it 's about country stereotypes . 
  there are plenty about poland , both positive and negative , and which one of the most common ones do you also think is wrong , either entirely wrong or partially wrong ? 
  contribute !, 
  i 've been to belgium twice and it 's basically the only place where i see waffles being sold on the street for ` normal ' people . 
  i 've seen waffles being sold at tourist locations in other countries but not in everyday streets like in belgium . 
  so while you may not eat it as often as people think , i 'm willing to bet you still eat it way more than other countries !, 
  also , i 've noticed people eat mayo with literally * everything * in belgium . 
  is this also something you 've noticed or did i get a niche view ? 
   oh , you are one of those `` the only difference between men and women are penises and vaginas '' muppets nope , i believe in biological differences between sexes , such as difference in testosteron which in terms affect competitiveness . 
  nice wishful thinking , though  also , even if you have a 100 % biological view on differences between sexes , that still does n't explain away the sharp differences between swedish women 's success in the top echelons of their society with that of american women . 
  so your comment changes nothing on this fundamental issue . 
  by the way , is n't it time you talked about your own country instead of turning this thread into a pro/anti-feminist thread ? 
  stay on topic !, 
  oh do n't get me wrong , it is by most measures !, 
  i 'm just questioning the `` we are the bestest ever and everyone else sucks '' hivemind mentality in sweden when it comes to gender equality . 
  feminists often make the point that we as a society have double standards for women and men when it comes to success . 
  men are allowed far more social space to behave like , frankly , assholes , as long as we are successful . 
  we are being called driven , ambitious , `` hardnosed '' . 
  all these have positive connotations . 
  women are instead denigrated as ` bitches ' and unpleasant . 
  not just by men , often by women too . 
  so a society 's test of women 's equality ca n't just be basic stuff like education or superficial access to the job market . 
  it also has to be judged how it handles high-performing women . 
  and my point was , sweden in this regard lags ** far , far behind ** many other supposedly `` right-wing '' and `` backwards '' countries in the world . 
  yet that fact does n't seem to disturb the `` we are the bestest ever on women 's issues '' mentality in sweden . 
  it 's simply not a concept that aligns with the general understanding of where we are as a society . 
  from the article :  although the cars ** wo n't be manufactured in tilburg ** , the battery pack , power train and rear axle will be installed there , ** coming from the firm 's hq in fremont , california ** . 
  the car 's first firmware upload will also be carried out on site , before each car undergoes a rigorous quality control assessment . 
  so it 's more of an assembly plant and a final testing site than an outright factory . 
  still , good news for those of us who are waiting for the model 3 . 
   `` think critically '' is a meaningless statement if you are only going to think critically on things that dont fit your agenda as well . 
  reddit has a problem with thinking saying `` be logical/critical '' and actually doing it are the same thing .
