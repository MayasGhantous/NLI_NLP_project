  i think something similar should be done to media oversight , an institution which is fundamentally removed from government and independent . 
  i 'd even give it powers to appoint their own successors , because there 's always a danger of political interference otherwise to push an agenda . 
  yes , but at the same time , norwegians have not faced the same sickening crimewave of racism that poles have , so it 's understandable why he 'd feel so strongly about it , more so than you or i. 
  still does n't make him right , though . 
  if you had to read daily stories of norwegians racially abused , getting their houses burned up and told they were vermin , i highly doubt you 'd be as removed and sanguine as you are now . 
  neither would i. 
  politicians lecturing others on honesty and accountability is pretty hilarious , though . 
  what social researchers found in the u.s. was that the [ biggest single correlation of support for trump was authoritarianism ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/02/01/how-your-parenting-style-predicts-whether-you-support-donald-trump/ ) . 
  those results seem to be in tandem with what people have found among the brexit demographics . 
  although in the u.s , some have contested [ that ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/03/09/trumps-voters-arent-authoritarians-new-research-says-so-what-are-they/ ) , so it 'll be interesting to see the social science researchers ' response to kaufman . 
  the power of mass media gives these people extra responsibility . 
  that 's why propaganda in dictatorships is so effective in keeping the system going for so long , despite the oppressive reality , because most people are unable to think critically and just blindly accept what they read in the papers as 100 % true . 
  the media ca n't easily escape their responsbility , because of the way mass psychology works . 
  they are exploiting the vacuum in british politics right now . 
  this is far more dangerous than the random slurs hurled at poles , this is orchestrated violence . 
  since the uk leadership is sleeping through the morass , the polish community in the uk needs to step the fuck up asap , because its clear they ca n't depend on anyone else . 
  stay safe , bros. 
  seriously . 
  ** rough translation and summary ** : after the series of sexual attacks across several music festivals , g\u00f6teborgskalaset has put in place a range of safety measures , including a customised safety drill for both volunteers and secruity personell . 
  if that is not enough , however , there 's a plan b , which is to create `` women-only zones '' at the front of the audience space , close to the stage ( that is where most of the groping have taken place ) . 
  the organiser said that this is a last resort , but they have it as a contingecy plan if there are needs . 
  those safety zones would not be forced , but voluntary , so if a woman feels threatened , she would be able to go there , if she feels she has no other choice . 
  i believe germany is now moving more towards the swedish version , which is probably one of the most stringent laws in the world . 
  despite all the hysteria from anti-feminists , from the stats i 've seen by social researchers , there is still * massive * amounts of underreported rapes in any case . 
  most people forget that the overwhelming majority of women are raped by men in their social circles , not infrequently even their boyfriends , and not by strangers . 
  hopefully this can help some of those underreported cases coming to light in germany , too , as the victim will feel she ( or he ! ), 
  has more support in the law . 
   again , the most probable reason is that there are many euroretirees living in spain but not registered . 
  yeah , is n't there like over 1 million brits in spain ? 
  way , way , higher than 122k . 
   romania ( 646k ) holy shit , that 's a * lot * . 
  when did these people come and what kinds of jobs ? 
  building contractors ? 
  given the high unemployment , i wonder how they manage to stay . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/contact_hypothesis i know . 
  you did n't understand my comment , however . 
  you also did n't answer me if milk is good or bad , but i wo n't hold that against you . 
  spain looks to have quite many . 
  i wonder how many of them are sunburned , old brits , in percentage terms out of the total foreign population . 
  also , definitions change . 
  sweden had what was basically a one-drop rule until quite recently , where we counted someone as non-swede even if they only had 1 grandparent who was foreign-born . 
  today , they are counted as swedes when they are native born in the nation with * at least * one parent also born in sweden , which is still quite stingy . 
  i believe sociologists call it `` contact theory '' . 
  although , i 've also read that increased contact with other cultures leads to * lower * social trust , so i do n't know what to think anymore . 
  it 's like : is milk good for you as an adult ? 
  i still do n't know . 
  everyone is saying something different . 
  good stuff . 
  now let 's hope she keeps her fm on a leash as he is sending all the wrong signals to putin . 
  i trust her far more than steinmeier , and even if i know she calls all the shots in the end , for consistency 's sake , it 's better if the entire government speaks in one voice . 
  true , but i would guess we will see a significant decrease in the later part of this year . 
  remember that we saw the truly big increases last year in september/october/november . 
  that is unlikely to be repeated , so my guesstimate is that we 'll end the year with a lower total figure . 
  secondly , a lot of those who came during the spring this year actually wanted to come last year through turkey/greece , but once the balkan route closed , they had to remake their plans and wait for better weather and make a run for either italy or spain . 
  that is now seen in the numbers , i 'm thinking of the african nationals in particular . 
  it 'd also be interesting to see how the new frontex works out in this context . 
   no language , skill or ideology teaching would ever make them more than human refuse . 
  huh ? 
  you 're being overtly dramatic and hysterical . 
  just because someone lacks the skillset required to have a decent chance being in the job market does n't make them ` human refuse ' . 
  immigration should not be a charity . 
  while i support limited refugee migration ( genuine refugees who truly flee war , which there are , let 's not forget ) , today the system , as i 've outlined elsewhere , incentivies human smugglers where 50 % of those who come are not even refugees in the tradtional sense of the word , but economic migrants . 
  therefore , it helps being upfront with the fact that most of the migration coming today should be geared towards helping the economy , it is better for the host nation and the migrant him/herself , because if they can get a job quickly , it raises their sense of self-worth and belonging . 
  that is not something we should be easily dismissing . 
  just insisting , blindly , that we can `` manage '' things better when the people who are coming are in most cases semi-illiterate or worse is nothing else but wishful thinking . 
  that is no substitute for thoughtful policy . 
   i do absolutely believe it be possible . 
  then i invite you to expand on that and explain how you would fit a square into a circle peg , because empty rhetoric is not enough . 
  i 'm skeptical of the bribing strategy as well . 
  i 've looked at some of the literature in migration studies and basically its a crapshoot . 
  it can work short-term , but there are many instances where the money is only pocketed by a rent-seeking corrupt elite and the migration wave may be reduced ( somewhat ) , so as to keep the money going , but never really meaningfully lowered . 
  then there 's the `` we must invest in those countries in the long term so people wo n't go '' . 
  that sounds plausible on the surface , but if you look at eastern european migration , you saw the massive move towards the uk and germany in 2004 . 
  back then , ten years ago , those countries were * much * richer than even the richest sub-saharan african countries are today , with the sole exception of south africa . 
  many of these poor countries in ss africa will be poorer than poland/lithuania/latvia were in 2004 even twenty years from now . 
  constraining asylum policy is also not as easy , because we 've signed the geneva convention . 
  plus , genuine refugees still deserve protection , the problem is that the current system basically incentives people smugglers and that 's why 50 % of all who come , according to ec figures , are economic migrants . 
  fundamentally , i think we will only see a resolution of this once we get a new eu treaty . 
  have you looked at the numbers for germany ? 
  around 2/3 of the people who came last year are either illiterate or semi-illiterate . 
  germany is one of the most skill intensive economies in the world . 
  it 's good at absorbing non-university labour , but you still need a high school education ( something many of them lack ) and be able to communicate in german . 
  most of the people who came to germany last year ca n't even read/write in their own language . 
  if you think that does not provide a massive problem in of itself , and that we can someone `` manage '' it by magic , then you 're probably as clueless as the people running the migration policy in europe atm . 
  you 'd fit right in . 
  i remember reading a few months back that many of the african migrants coming now were preparing in the summer of 2015 as the free-for-all was getting underway , just that it takes a lot longer to get up to the north african coast from where they are due to worse infrastructure . 
  once the balkan route closed and the asylum rules were started to get tightened , many of them were stuck in libya and similar countries . 
  many are now taking their chances across the med to get to italy or spain . 
  yeah , fair point . 
  by that measure , ` murica does even worse than france or sweden . 
   unless my tired eyes deceive me i think we 've found the culprit , my friend . 
  get some sleep and come back tomorrow and see if a new set of fresh eyes ( preferably not ones you 've poked out and stole from someone else ) will help you . 
  i guess it makes sense in a way , since the expectation going forward is that eu migration will fall quite rapidly , it means far less takers . 
  also , the jobs that eastern europeans filled were typically the kinds of jobs that were pretty full of hard work . 
  not saying that brits are lazy ( although i am saying that ) , but rather just that it 's reasonable to assume there will be less willingness to do the same jobs , too . 
  a fairer question has not been asked !, 
   nominal gdp in ** current prices ** is useful as a metric to measure the economic heft or relevance of a country ( broadly speaking ) there we sharply disagree and i 've already outlined why . 
   france has 10 % unemployment unemployment rate in the american context is misleading . 
  a ton of your prime-age workers have dropped out .
