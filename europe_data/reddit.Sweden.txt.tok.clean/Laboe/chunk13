  the `` root causes '' of migration is an increasingly open-border asylum system in europe . 
  but merkel , who runs the show , has already said she wo n't budge on the key issue . 
  and as long as she does n't budge , this is all a chimera which means ** nothing ** . 
  merkel is the obstacle to progress not these africans . 
  i actually think you 're underestimating the ideological underpinnings of this project . 
  nobody is making a killing here . 
  people want to believe these materialistic explanations because they ca n't fathom why their gov would do this against their own people . 
  neither do i , but i 've left the `` the elite benefits on this '' bs a long time ago . 
  this is ideological , not driven by money . 
   sweden will now spend money on refugees who arrive from those countries due to the poor economical and living conditions . 
  that ... does n't makes a lot of sense . 
  the total asylum budget for the next 4 years is 270 billion sek . 
  that only includes * initial * costs . 
  it does n't include the long lead times to get into the employment market ( for those who get in at all ) , the strain on social services etc. 
  to put this in perspective : sweden could fund the ** entire ** un syrian refugee budget for many times over for this sum . 
  please do n't pretend that this has * anything * to do with `` humanitarianism '' . 
  it 's an ideological project . 
  the absolvement of the swedish culture . 
  but you ca n't sell it like that . 
  so instead they use dead kids on a beach as emotional blackmail . 
  nobody does the numbers among the general public and those few who do are demonized . 
  when are people finally going to notice what is going on here ? 
  it has nothing to do with humanitarianism/saving lives at all . 
  nothing . 
  the money spent speaks far louder than all the government propaganda ( and the media lies ) in the world . 
  there used to be an old journalistic saying , maybe we should heed it : ** follow the money ** . 
  i understand your good itentions by the reality is this : this wont be fixed until all parties agree on nationalism . 
  peoples political preferences on economy , energy , social issues etc will always be too different to house under a single party . 
  to achieve this we need metapolitics more than parliamentary politics . 
  your attitude is part of the reason why sweden is such a mess now . 
  too much group think . 
  tell me , who were the * real * crazies ? 
  too many swedes are obsessed by following concensus/what the media tells them . 
  we now see the results of that mentality . 
  wonglik stop fantasizing about sweden . 
  poland will get swedish refugees in the next few decades . 
  do n't worry , it will be the sane ones like me . 
  we 'll bond by making gulasch together and squat in adidas track suits like brothers !, 
  dont talk about stuff you have no fucking clue about . 
  sweden have instituted amazingly generous benefits for refugees in recent years . 
  so much so that even the ( pragmatic ) left has started to slowly , cautiously warn about `` disincentives to work '' . 
  also typical to see the anti-ee patronising tone so common among white lefties . 
  go fuck yourself . 
  yeah those are just the three biggest cities in sweden and whose urban metro population together account for 40 % of the country . 
  nothing to see here , move along . 
  seriously , the amount of self-denial that exists in sweden is off-the-charts huge . 
  as for your white flight tactic , do n't be a whimp . 
  do you love your country or not ? 
  if you are not willing to fight for it , you do n't deserve it . 
  you know sweden could fund the entire un budget for syrian refugees for the amount of money we will spend on just a fraction here at home . 
  it 's time to finally retire the laughable propaganda that asylum immigration has anything to do with `` human rights '' . 
  as for being pro-gay rights etc , i 'm on board on that . 
  but the term `` human rights '' today has become so bloated . 
  the guy 's been saying the same thing for years . 
  has n't stopped the catalan nationalists . 
  i mean , what is he going to do ? 
  send the army ? 
  people have to remember the history here , how the fascist dictator franco brutalised catalonia . 
  it 's even in the lore of f.c. 
  barcelona , how he went into the dressing room and threatened the barca players because they were winning against his beloved real madrid . 
  i think it was in 1944 , but i 'd welcome any corrections if my historical memory needs to be updated . 
  i 'm a federalist and i am naturally inclined against secessionism , but europe 's political system is overwhelmingly democratic and if the catalans * really * want to go at it alone , go ahead . 
  i do n't see how monaco not being part of france is a disaster or luxembourg going at it alone is a problem . 
  it 's not enough to reject his application . 
  they should deport him , too . 
  why allow a dangerous person like that to even roam the country ? 
  i 'm sure israel does n't want him , but [ that 's too bad ] ( http://www.haaretz.com/news/israel/1.567450 ) . 
  would n't it be a version of the eternity machine ? 
  and for some reason they hate central banking and are in love with gold . 
  isis is just the latest example . 
  oh , and check . 
  so basically , the courts and the body of european regulators will decide how to enforce the intentionally vague rules . 
  people who are acting as if this is a done deal have n't done their homework . 
  your stream does n't have english dubs . 
  right now there 's some slavic dude talking in full speed and yeah , fairly useless if there 's no english audio dub if you wan na follow the debate . 
  being central european is probably less of an allure as poland gets richer , and thus the social values of the ce are not nearly as associated with success . 
  also , i 'm not sure if you are the arbiter of being pro-central european , considering your relentless pro-islam/pro-refugee stream of [ `` contributions '' ] ( https://www.reddit.com/user/obeystatusquo/submitted/ ) . 
  20 years from now , we 'll be discussing how to integrate central europe into eastern europe and people like you will be marginalised , as you should be . 
  stereotypes never cease to impress me . 
  now we just need one of those `` sweden loves gaysex '' comics from / r/polandball and we 're all set . 
  ( damn you the netherlands , for stealing our thunder ) . 
   my country sometimes feels like a whore you 've been whoring out to uncle sam for decades . 
  even went into iraq on his command , silly brit . 
  but china , which has no agenda to invade half the world and invite the other half into its country , is somehow off-limits ? 
  what we 're seeing now is a smart rebalancing from the uk to a more balanced foreign policy . 
  this should be celebrated . 
  if anything , the uk is turning into less of a whore ( or a slave if you want to use that analogy ) and becomming more independent , like india . 
  your mindset is weird . 
  no it 's not his point . 
  he was trying to dismiss the findings by using a shit comparison and it blew up in his face . 
  and you missed that . 
  how is it dishonest ? 
  it deals with london , not the uk . 
  just because it does n't fit your narrative ? 
  pathetic . 
   there 's a difference between saying immigrants are causing a rise in tb , which i do n't remember ever having contested and saying tb was eradicated ( i do n't think there is any country in the world that has eradicated tb ) and has been imported immigrants are imported into a country . 
  it 's not hard to understand . 
  unless , of course , you 're unwilling to accept anything badly linked to immigration , which it is obvious you are . 
  it 's also possible to have two thoughts in your head at the same time . 
  the uk could be doing a better job on tb , and immigration could contribute to the spread of tb , and both can be true at the same time .
