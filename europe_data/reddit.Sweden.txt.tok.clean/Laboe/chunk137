  of course nobody serious is denying that colonialism had an effect , but india was also colonised , and china was put through the `` century of humiliation '' . 
  the arab world ca n't keep making excuses for itself forever , but judging by your comments , it will try for as long as it can . 
  go to ukraine or greece . 
  both really need the cash , and both are beautiful countries . 
  ukraine is underexplored and has far less tourists , but it is also `` harder '' for some people . 
  they feel unsafe etc. 
  very cheap , too . 
  it would be an excellent occassion to learn russian . 
  else , maybe he will decide that you are n't a person anymore . 
  i hope you 're right , but looking at the eu conservatives , i do n't really see that . 
  our right-wing parties are far less enthusiastic about green initiatives for instance . 
  they always talk about growth instead ( as if they were in conflict ) . 
  just like in the u.s. 
  it 's the same in the uk , where they have slashed support for renewable energy . 
  the same is in denmark etc. 
  just go down the list . 
  yeah , sorry about jumping down your throat . 
  it 's just that i 've seen * far * too many people resort to materialist arguments in these discussions . 
  some on the left are allergic to cultural explanations , they feel it it is racist etc ( except when they can blame white people , it 's all of a sudden very comfortable then ) . 
  so they resort to purely materialistic arguments . 
  `` oh , unemployment did that . '', 
  or , `` economic hopeless * pushed them * in that direction '' ( my emphasis ) . 
  when something becomes so common , and you start to see the first beginnings of a similar argument , it 's easy assume that it 's what it usually is , even when it is n't , as in your case . 
  hope you do n't mind , 
  i do n't see how there is any change necessary ? 
  there is an open debate on islam today in europe . 
  the fact that afd felt comfortable to include that they do n't feel islam belongs to germany in their party manifesto is a sign of that . 
  what do you think would have happened if they said that people of the jewish religion do not belong in germany ? 
  there 's this myth that people ca n't debate islam . 
  also , this is about a supposed `` anti-islam '' party which is slurring a devout christian . 
  have you forgotten about that ? 
  so it is about race , not religion in this instance . 
  a trigger can not explain the type of reaction which will follow . 
  look at the economic meltdown occuring in brazil right now . 
  and where is the social extremism in brazil ? 
  they have the worst economic crisis in * decades * , yet i do n't see any ultra-fundamentalist christian takeover happening , do you ? 
  economic triggers are weak excuses for reactions people living in a society do n't want to take responsbility of . 
  unemployment and poverty is never an excuse to treat women as chattel and people of other beliefs as sworn enemies . 
  there is * no * link there , only excuses . 
  some people just want to live with a much smaller state , and they will hijack any recent event to push their agenda . 
  you should know that , because every nation has their ideological agenda groups . 
  it 's the same on every topic . 
  feminists also push for their agenda , hijacking news . 
  immigration groups ( both pro and anti ) do the same . 
  i mean , were you born yesterday ? 
  the most important figure you need to know is 50 % . 
  that is the share of british exports which goes to the eu . 
  our export share to them is 10 % , which is still nothing to sniff at , but it is nevertheless far less . 
  the brexit camp of course knows this , so they are saying , quite loudly , that they will get a new trade deal with the eu . 
  the problem is that this is fundamentally disingenious . 
  you see , what they really want is the access to our * internal market * . 
  they could get a b-list trade deal but that would leave them far worse off than they are now . 
  a key component of brexit propaganda is that `` nothing will change economically in the long run , its all short-term volatility '' . 
  well , if that is your pr line , then you better deliver . 
  the problem ? 
  it 's a pack of lies . 
  if they want access to the internal market without being in the eu , well , we already have that model . 
  it 's what the norwegians have . 
  this is what that means : * you pay eu contributions but in the case of the uk , they get ** no ** rebates , which is the case right now * you do n't get to choose your immigration on eu migrants , so what was the point about screaming about eu immigration again ? 
  * you do n't get to have any seat at the table , you have to passively accept the diktats of the eu , which is what norway does right now . 
  in other words , they will get mostly the same as they have now , except they do n't get a seat at the table and they get no rebates . 
  it 's absolutely worthless of a shit deal for them . 
  the only other way is to * not * go into the internal market . 
  here they can choose their laws freely , but the negative downside here is that they get locked out of the internal market which would create ** long-lasting ** economic disadvantages . 
  further , competitive pressures , which mr.posen spoke about in the video , would dissipate . 
  for all the talk about how the eu drags them down , the reality is that the eu has a current account surplus with the uk while they are running a big fat deficit with us . 
  that should indicate which economy is competitive and which is not . 
  further , the uk should compare itself to the nordic countries , nl , germany etc. 
  in all these comparisons , it has a lower gdp per capita , far worse trade balance , higher debt and a less productive work-force . 
  the british economy is not even nearly as competitive as the brexit camp pretends . 
  it would get even worse locked out of the internal market and , in the words of obama , `` put in the back of the queue '' in the eyes of america . 
  good luck , brexiters . 
  good luck . 
  yep , it does n't shock me at all . 
  i wonder how the afd people will spin this one . 
   there are no good measures for unemployment , because there are good and bad reasons for not to be counted into the workforce . 
  but nobody can really decide what reasons are good and what are bad . 
  i think this will be my last comment here , but it is quite obvious your grasp of what the employment-to-population ratio is and what it entails is quite shaky . 
  i would suggest you further study the issue . 
  it 's perfectly fine to be critical of islam , and religion in general . 
  i 've often pointed out the hypocrisy of the western left that is very willing to attack christianity ( because it is overwhelmingly the religion of white people in europe ) but is refusing to do on islam ( seen as the religion of poor , brown people ) . 
  what i am criticising , however , are the knee-jerk defenders of afd who keep claiming that there is no racism in the party , except that we are continually reminded that , in fact , there is . 
  how are you going to explain away this latest episode ? 
  what does it have to do with islam ? 
  it 's all about race , it 's so obvious . 
   the whole notion of human rights , and therefore refugees rights grows out of a kind of moral universalism that western countries agreed to adopt after the atrocities of the fascism in europe and the second world war . 
  this is when many who see themselves in the classical liberal tradition learned from history and adopted a more internationalist view of people 's liberties . 
  sure , but that is not something inherent in classical liberalism . 
  it 's an added extra ( and an important extra , i might add , if done right ! ) . 
  fundamentally , my point about the root arguments of classical liberalism as being grounded in economic terms remains unchanged . 
  many on the far-left want to see high levels of immigration because they want to live in racially/culturally diverse societies in of itself . 
  classical liberals may enjoy such societies on a personal level , but they keep their arguments for open borders primarily based on economic arguments , as they see open borders as a net plus for the world economy . 
  this fundamental difference is there , and it remains . 
  be careful to differentiate from personal preference and political argument . 
  when was the last time you saw a classical liberal attack other people on moralistic terms for not supporting immigration ? 
  they might brand them as economically ignorant ( from their pov ) , but they would n't get outraged because they do n't view immigration policy through the prism of race/moral guilt ( real or imagined ) , but rather as a net gain for the world economy . 
  therein lies the difference . 
  you 're still wrong . 
  the amount of students as a share of the total working-age population 16-64 is very marginal . 
  your point about part-time workers is better , but it still misses the point .
