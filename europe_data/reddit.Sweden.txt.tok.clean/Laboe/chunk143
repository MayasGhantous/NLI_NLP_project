  how that is selected is anybody 's guess , but the two are not the same . 
  by contrast , cbos does a national poll about poland 's neighbours which you can read here in english : http://cbos.pl/pl/publikacje/public_opinion/2015/09_2015.pdf the opinion of germans , while terse in some sense , is certainly relatively positive . 
  czechs and slovaks get high marks . 
  russians , by no surprise , gets a bad rep. 
  i was surprised how lowly many thought of ukrainians . 
  actually both should be banned . 
  the state should control monopoly on violence . 
  it does n't matter if it is a left-wing or a right-wing group which challenges that . 
   if you are wondering why g7 leaders spin this in terms of global economic growth - they represent large parts of the global economy and the british economy is closely tied in with the global one , more so than most others . 
  they are doing this because britain is part of the g7 and they are saying what is in their common interest . 
  i would be saying the same thing , but i would * not * be saying it is a threat to global growth , which is a laughable and silly statement . 
   i was making the point that anyone is currently doing such a cost-benefit analysis and economics plays a major part in it . 
  oh , i agree with you . 
  it 's just that i was saying that fundamentally , they are being fed a pack of lies on economics . 
  some even acknowledge that brexit would be detrimental to british economic growth , but they still back it because of political aims . 
  thus , politics is the supreme driving factor here , economics takes a back seat . 
  others have tried to mask this by pretending that they will join a future anglosphere union ( even as obama has said that they will become a 2nd class nation in terms of economic ties and once again re-iterated america 's need to turn to the pacific ) . 
  others have claimed that britain will be able to continue just as now , but outside the eu . 
  but this is patently not true , because they have to choose between access to the internal market like norway but get none of the political influences ( and as such , freedom of movement will once again be something they ca n't control , so what was the point about ` sovereignity ' again ? ), 
  or they will be outside the external market , which just about every economist agrees would be a total disaster for the uk . 
  something even brexiters implicitly acknowledge , because they all say that they want a trade deal with the eu ( but again , the unfettered access to the internal market is what they should be aiming for , any other trade deal would result in a net economic loss from their current standpoint ) . 
  i could rant a lot more , but my underlining point was that economics takes a back seat for two reasons : either they are fundamentally ignorant about the issues at hand ( which is often faciliated by those who feed them lies on purpose in order to downplay the negative effects and push them into a pro-brexit camp ) . 
  or , even worse , they know about the effects but are spinning pr tales about how britain can become part of an anglosphere or get a special relationship with china etc , even as both of those are out of the question . 
  that 's why i said political concerns are the driving force . 
  i guess i was n't clear enough . 
  i pay about 20 sek for a basket of 400 grammes . 
  so that 's 50 sek per kilo . 
  roughly speaking , that 's 5.4 euros per kilo . 
  think about what you wrote previously . 
   if someone consents to being treated unjustly , that might be a shame , but none of anyone 's business . 
  that statement is na\u00efve , because people in such situations are often heavily pressured to accept the ruling because of communal pressure . 
  what is * de jure * a neutral arbitration is not necessarily a * de facto * neutral arbitration . 
  i also spoke of the fact that the british state is the umbrella of the system , it operates under its apex . 
  as such , the british state has full soverign right to revoke any previously granted access . 
  what you 're proposing is that nothing should be done , you 're washing your hands off the problem . 
  i am saying that continual oversight is necessary and if systematic maltreatment of women is found to be a feature , not a bug , of sharia courts then the british state has not just the right but the duty to intervene , as it rests under liberal jurisprudence . 
  i understand the reasoning behind it . 
  i simply believe there has to be reform . 
  mediation by a third party should not be an excuse to degrade a nation 's standards , or its values . 
  britain is a secular democracy . 
  sharia courts are not secular by their nature . 
  it should be possible to keep the mediation system while still keeping it in sync with britain 's secular traditions . 
   i 'm not saying nothing can be done literally a phrase later  that might be a shame , but none of anyone 's business . 
  i rest my case . 
   why does it miss the point ? 
  it misses the point because it is inaccurate . 
  brexit is not a serious risk to ** global ** growth . 
  it is a risk to britain , as i pointed out . 
  britain = / = the world . 
   the politics play a role in that calculation , but so do the economics of the situation . 
  indeed , but you 've missed my argument . 
  my argument is that the economic case for brexit is a total disaster in the short to medium run . 
  so why is it still popular ? 
  because some people believe paying the economic price is worth it , if it means that the british people through its national parliament regain absolute control . 
  hence it is fundamentally a political vote , because [ no serious case can be made ] ( https://piie.com/blogs/realtime-economic-issues-watch/brexit-scenarios-june-24 ) for brexit from an economic view point . 
  right , except that consent to have this system is n't just between the two parties . 
  it is also based on consent from the state , which is the apex body of the law in any nation . 
  as such , your attempt to try to push out the state of this equation is mistaken and misguided . 
  as long as this continues with the explicit acknowledgement and approval of the state , these people have to accept the fact that what they do is n't just a matter between them . 
  since we live in a democratic nation , where the state is ultimately responsible to its citizens , * all * of its citizens , this then becomes a matter for everyone . 
  it 'd be silly to say that it does n't concern me as a citizen if someone else beats their children . 
  we all have to share the land . 
  if sharia courts do things which are counter to the spirit of equality between genders which is shared by the great majority in a given nation , then it * does * become an issue for everyone , no matter how much you try to deny it . 
  remember that these sharia courts operate under the umbrella of the british state . 
  as such , they should be subject to questioning and introspection . 
  just giving a dismissive comment about how nothing can be done , like you did , entirely misses the point . 
  this is why i ca n't take these organisations like the g7 seriously . 
  nobody in their right mind would say that a brexit would be damaging to global growth . 
  it * would * however be a damage to britain 's growth . 
  but folks [ are n't ] ( https://piie.com/blogs/realtime-economic-issues-watch/brexit-scenarios-june-24 ) voting with their wallet anyway . 
  brexit is a political vote , so all this focus on economics kind of misses the point . 
   you ca n't ban people from sorting out matters themselves . 
  this is a pretty remarkable argument . 
  using the same ` logic ' , you can say the same thing about violence in society , so there 's no point in having a police force . 
  after all , the police in every society is a recognition that the state having a monopoly of violence is a necessary evil , otherwise you have complete anarchy . 
  does that prevent some people from using violence themselves ? 
  of course not , but that does n't mean we should abolish the police force . 
  just because we ca n't have a 100 % outcome every time does n't mean we should just give up on an issue . 
   so , they are in denmark against denmark 's government 's will ? 
  i do n't think the danish government designed their refugee system to house welfare tourists , which is what that guy is . 
  instead , they likely designed it to house genuine refugees - like yazidis and other groups fleeing religious/ethnic persecution - which that guy is * not * . 
  the fact that he got through the cracks is a call to reform . 
  it 's not a call for a passive acceptance , which is what you 're advocating . 
  this discussion is over . 
  well , there 's also a difference between growth and growth . 
  most european nations need more investment . 
  private investment has been * very * weak . 
  so consumption-led growth in 4 % or more per annum might lead to a debt-bubble , but seeing investment take over , especially since you have * big * needs , may not be a major problem . 
  i also agree with you on your point about the lack of inflation . 
  potential gdp is probably higher than 2.5 % . 
   that what i said . 
  they are in denmark because they were allowed to be . 
  no , that 's * not * what you said . 
  you completely dodged the issue of why they were let in the first place . 
  you jumped straight to after they got asylum . 
  this entire discussion is how this happened , and more importantly , how to prevent it from happening again . 
  you are still not wanting to have that debate . 
   ** now , they are alive ** and living in denmark . 
  this is why i asked if you were trolling . 
  are you serious ?
