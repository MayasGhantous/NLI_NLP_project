  a man who is in danger of his life does n't have 3 wives and 20 kids . 
  syria 's tfr is around [ 2.7 ] ( http://www.indexmundi.com/syria/total_fertility_rate.html ) . 
  for someone to have 20 kids means that they are very safe in such an environment . 
  why are you using the language as if his life is in danger ? 
  we do n't even know if he is originally syrian , since a lot of migrants used bought/fake passports . 
  seriously , your mentality is a big reason why we have this crisis in the first place . 
  i 'm amazed at how na\u00efve you are . 
  it 's interesting comparing the v4 between each other , from the end of last year : http://cbos.pl/pl/publikacje/public_opinion/2015/12_2015.pdf go to page 3 out of 4 . 
  you 'll note that poland is * significantly * more liberal in its attitudes to immigration and immigrants than the others . 
  the most hardline country seems to be czechia . 
  you can see the full list here : http://cbos.pl/en/publications/public_opinion.php the april survey has n't been produced yet , but it does n't matter much . 
  they have done plenty of surveys in the last year or so . 
  here is a link to your question : http://cbos.pl/pl/publikacje/public_opinion/2015/11_2015.pdf, 
  welfare tourism . 
  let 's call it what it is . 
  assholes like that ruin it for people who genuinely deserve protection and are not interested in milking the social security system . 
   denmark had to accept them there . 
  denmark did n't `` have '' to accept them . 
  they chose to . 
  these people came in as migrants . 
  there was nothing pre-ordained about this . 
   like they do for the rest of the people who apply for social security and ** fit in the parameters ** . 
  certainly that 's better for the kids and for denmark . 
  pretty sure the vast majority of male danes do n't have 3 wives and 20 kids . 
  i do n't think you 've read my comment properly . 
  europe did n't really need any defence from america in the post-cold war era . 
  yet we continually cut down our defences precisely because despite the rhetoric , america did n't do much . 
  even today , while the threat from russia is rising , we do n't actually need america . 
  we would n't even need to raise our spending on defence . 
  what we need is * coordination * . 
  each army operates as in a silo . 
  if we pooled our resources , there is nobody out there except you and china who could match us , and neither is a military threat to us . 
  as for asia-pacific , i 'm surprised why you only go 60 % . 
  then again , i 'm not sure if it matters . 
  from where i stand , your so-called `` pivot '' has been a disaster . 
  the chinese take-over of the scs is already a done deal . 
  it 's only a question of time before they push you out to the 2nd island chain and then the third . 
  your only hope is india , but they are close buddies with the russians as well and still are in non-alignment . 
  they just want your defense know-how in their manufacturing . 
  he was being sarcastic . 
   i 'm blond ** e ** so you 're lesbian ? 
  it 's frankly shocking why the uk would even allow this in the first place . 
  it 's not too late to shut it down , but the longer you wait , the more entrenched it becomes . 
   many cute blondes i never cease to be amazed how much blonde women are fetishised , even in america , where there are a lot of blonde women . 
  i foresee americans being taken for a ride yet again . 
  the thing is , we 've had a number of american diplomats come to europe , make all the usual speeches about `` sharing the burden '' but then they get seduced by the cocktail circuit . 
  we wine and dine them , show them our culture . 
  they start seeing europe as one big extended vacation . 
  in a word , they go native . 
  fast forward a few years , next enjoy from america comes . 
  starts making the same speeches ... you can see why there has n't been action on this for decades . 
  do you know what percentage manufacturing consists of in polish exports ? 
  it would be interesting to compare between nations . 
  iirc , poland has quite a diversified economy , so i am not sure you would be hit as much as slovenia , which has a much more niched economy . 
  right , which is why it is a good thing why investment as a share of gdp is rising in the coming years , as said in the article , while consumption declines . 
  so i do n't know why that is n't taken into account ? 
   or we 'll send some black helicopters to your home ha !, 
  i am one step ahead of authorities , my entire home has been walled in by tin foil . 
  they will never find me . 
  it was inevitable . 
  it is n't the fault of the finns . 
  i use wp 8.1 on my l1520 . 
  i like it a lot , but it evolved * way * too late . 
  microsoft did n't let the os to be used for free . 
  they arrogantly assumed people would use wp just because they use windows on their desktops . 
  the finnish economy has come some way already . 
  it has done a lot of painful restructuring . 
  it still has a world-class education system . 
  it still has a workforce with world-class skills . 
  it has a very competitive economy . 
  it can surely bounce back , and if anything , this could prove to be beneficial in the long run , because it will free up manpower and resources for more start-ups . 
  now , i only hope that finland will realise what was obvious for a long time : the euro has been a disaster for finland as long as it is not in a fiscal union ( which does n't look like it will be on the cards any time soon ) . 
  even alexander stubb admitted that joining the euro was a mistake . 
  if they get their monetary indepedence back , there 's no reason finland ca n't return to the frontier of europe once again , after slipping in the past 4-5 years . 
  sweden 's per capita gdp is now higher by a non-trivial amount . 
  i do n't view that with glee , or because our policies are so much better , but rather as a result of externally constraining factors for finland ( no independent monetary system ) and bad luck ( destruction of nokia and the paper mills * while at the same time * seeing a massive recession ) . 
  to be frank , if sweden faced what finland has faced these past few years , i 'd be willing to be we would have more social unrest and probably worse economic outcomes . 
  hang in there , bros. 
  trumpism could look very benign in comparison to what we could come up with . 
  europe has always been much more nationalist than america . 
  although , it should be said that the so-called ` melting-pot ' theory is mostly a giant hoax by now . 
  it may have been in effect at some point in the distant past but today , america has * de facto * multiculturalism as a way of life . 
  racial tension is constant , something which is no longer even possible to deny in the wake of blm , the rise of discourse around `` microaggressions '' etc. 
  i 've seen polls from pew and other respectable orgs that show that concerns over race is the highest in decades in america . 
  assimiliation , what ? 
  yeah , but that still does n't explain why * that one guy * had to have his flag taken away but all others got to keep theirs . 
  merkel confirmed dictator . 
  considering how much pushback you get from stating basic facts , i 'd say keep going . 
  i doubt it . 
  you do n't have an explosive bubble anymore , rather you are dealing with the aftermath of a previous bubble . 
  but it should be said your country 's economic performance has been a disaster in the last 5-6 years . 
  well , if you read the article , it says that investment will increase in the coming years and consumption will decrease . 
  so while you may face a bubble , it is more likely an investment-led bubble . 
  of course , i doubt that is overbuilding industrial capacity . 
  more likely it is the same old story : housing construction . 
  genuine question : why is your potential gdp so low ? 
  it should be considerably higher . 
  your per capita growth would be around 2.5 % as well , since you have little to no population growth , if not outright decline ( but even then , per capita income growth would n't be much higher as the declines are quite small year by year ) . 
  for instance , last year , we had a per capita income growth higher than 2.5 % . 
  at that pace you will never converge with the frontier economies of europe .
