  do you know swedish ? 
  i 'm laughing my ass off at your ignorance . 
  do you * seriously * think your delusional rants mean * anything * compared to journalists who work at an institution comparable to the bbc ? 
  hahahaha give us one single good reason . 
  because you do n't like the implication of honor culture ? 
  this is amazing to me . 
  how can someone be so divorced from reality . 
  it 's like some of those socialists visiting the gulag in the 30s or the killing fields of cambodia in the 70s and not even seeing what is in front of their eyes . 
  you , sir , are a human experiment on how to block out and filter things which is n't fitting your own personal narrative . 
  do you understand what you 're doing here ? 
  this is n't my `` opinion '' . 
  it 's what the svt article says . 
  you probably do n't even speak swedish and yet you * still * place yourself at an authority in this situation . 
  it 's amazing how stupid you are . 
  he 'll go as fast as you move to one where not jumping to conclusions about others is norm . 
  how can you be a neofascist party if you do n't even accept that there are ethnic swedes ? 
  you mentioned nationalism as a key tenet . 
  nationalism without ethnicity is n't really nationalism ( which is something sd tries to avoid answering ) . 
  really , your reply show a lack of total knowledge of what fascism really is , in that you incorporate a party which ca n't even be reasonably called nationalist anymore . 
  wow , sweden provided some marginal info !, 
  i 'm sure sweden had a key role in intelligence gathering compared to america 's pathetic nsa/cia operations / s it 's still interesting to see the left shifting from `` they are blowing themselves up because they are poor and desperate ! '', 
  excuses to this . 
  especially after most research has shown that jihadi terrorists tend to be well educated . 
  maybe this guy was also poor and desperate ? 
  or to use your own updated excuse train of thought , if sweden had fucked up iraq with it 's massive/crucial/key intel operation as you pointed out and thus sweden ca n't be surprised to have suicide bombers , what if this man reacted to his school being fucked up by iraqis/somalians and thus these people ca n't be surprised to see their children killed ? 
  of course , you 'd never accept that explanation for a white swede - but you * are * using it for a brown-skinned terrorist . 
  herein lies the hypocrisy on display . 
  neofascists in sd ? 
  this is a party which even denies that there is such a thing as an ethnic swede . 
  if that 's `` neofascism '' i 'd like to know what your definition of nazism is - lowering taxes on corporations ? 
  also , do n't copy & paste your previous comments . 
  your comments may be reflective of an intellectual laziness , but that 's no excuse . 
   there 's no time to talk about swedens role in destroying his home country this is going to be hilarious . 
  please explain further in how sweden in particular has been on this demonic binge . 
  i 'm going to love this :d, 
  it 's not scaring , it 's objective fact . 
  he 's talking about asylum seekers where the 80 % figure is correct . 
  my forecasting abilities are [ amazing ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europemeta/comments/3ofhq8/so_according_to_reddit_metrics_reurope_is_growing/ ) !, 
  seriously , though , yes it 's impressive how fast it grows . 
  as i posted in that thread ; i think we 're the biggest subreddit of all major geographic regions , let alone countries , in the world . 
  federalism may be having a tough time now politically but at least it ai n't dead on the internet !, 
  not so fast . 
  it was mostly arab men sitting in the caf\u00e9 to * keep track on their daughters * , according to svt ( our bbc ) . 
  we 're talking grown fathers sitting and monitoring girls in their low teens so that they can be `` modest '' enough . 
  it 's that kind of school we 're talking about . 
  does n't excuse the violence but this notion that these are just random people having coffee is a total lie , it 's an indication of how radical the culture clash was at that place , which is relevant in trying to understand why this happened . 
  your attitude is destructive to the conversation . 
  radical communist terrorists were also using wanton violence in the 1970s - should we stop speaking about income inequality because of that ? 
  if anyone can fuck off , it 's you . 
  do n't pretend that this did n't happen for no reason . 
  that 'd be dishonest . 
  remember , this * does not * include family reunification , so add 70-100 % on top of this . 
  also , we have a ton of illegal migrants who [ do n't even bother to register ] ( / https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ob8ou/swedish_police_many_refugees_disappear_without/ ) but who go underground right away , which the swedish police estimates to be in a one-for-one ratio . 
  these people are * not * counted either . 
  so the real number is closer to 500,000 once you add everything up . 
  true , most of the family migrants will come in later years but i count that as `` associated with 2015 '' . 
  just like most family asylum migrants who are coming this year are associated with previous waves . 
  the problem with popper 's quote is that the people who define tolerance have the cultural power . 
  his kind of thinking has been used to justified to attack any critic of multiculturalism as ` intolerant ' , after all , if we allow the ` intolerant ' ( i.e. 
  the critics of multiculturalism ) to thrive , we risk destroying the tolerance . 
  so it 's more than ironic you 're now dredging him up . 
  the old man is no authority on democracy and his quotes should be dead and buried . 
  there are far more eloquent people to quote on free speech and tolerance , voltaire for one . 
   apart from a few scandinavian entries , like m\u00e5ns because he was hot ) question : are you a gay man or a woman ? 
  because this does seem like an odd qualifier ( even if it made me chuckle ) . 
  do you live in scandinavia ? 
  aj goldmann of the wsj did a test in different capitals in europe and only found that in berlin and in stockholm he was n't heckled . 
  malm\u00f6 is a different story , but the situation is different in different cities . 
  also :  you can get by as a jew in scandinavia if you do n't share with anyone that you 're jewish this made me laugh . 
  the vast majority of jews in sweden are open about the fact that they are jewish . 
  there are no `` crypto-jews '' in sweden . 
  bearing the kippa might get some in trouble with the arabs to be sure , but among swedes no jew is hiding their identity and to claim that `` as a general '' rule is total bs . 
  no , the solution is clearly to abolish the fence because we ca n't think two steps ahead . 
  it should also be noted that sweden invests a very high percentage of its gdp in r&d . swedes are not magically more innovative than other europeans - we just make the right political choices . 
  and that in turn requires a high tax base . 
  it 's why we 're leading europe in fiber internet right now - our government makes the costly but necessary public investments to do so . 
  these are choices anyone can make , and sweden did them . 
  p.s here is a [ terrible ] ( https://data.oecd.org/rd/gross-domestic-spending-on-r-d.htm ) chart from the oecd . 
  i still post it because it gives the long view of many countries in the oecd . 
  you see ( fourth line from top ) that sweden is the eu country in the oecd which spends most on r&d , together with finland . 
  other innovative economies like israel spend even more so , in fact astronomically much , on r&d . this is clever stuff and i 'm surprised why we do n't have a binding 3 % floor on r&d spending in the eu , makes much more sense than other mandatory spending agreements . 
  r&d is innovation and that 's the lifeblood of productivity which in turn is the underlying driver of economic growth . 
  instead of betting on asylum seekers maybe we should bet on r&d spending and international students ? 
  no , that 'd be smart , so we ca n't do that . 
  the chp is irrelevant . 
  looking at the polls , they ca n't break out of their mid-25 percentage . 
  yes , he 's right about the bribe , but he does n't matter . 
  people have been advancing the `` if we do something , we 'll face backlash '' hypothesis as an excuse for not doing sufficiently for many years now . 
  it has n't worked . 
  to be perfectly honest , i 'm not convinced this approach will work either . 
  in the end , you ca n't * force * cultural change through laws of the government . 
  if the muslim community continues to defend and shield a substantial minority of hardline islamists - many of whom are not violent themselves but who teach intolerant and hateful things - then the government ca n't really do that much in the end . 
  i see this as a desperate and long overdue approach , but one with a limited chance of success . 
  what i * do n't * accept , however , is the notion that the muslim community 's radicalisation problem is somehow the fault of the uk public or its government . 
  the root cause of the problem came from within and nobody can credibly deny that there is a problem here - oh , except the muslim council itself , which continues to do so . 
  do n't see the problem here ? 
  why do you expect things to be solved if the muslim council itself is denying , in its public statements , that there are extremist mosques in the first place - despite countless media investigations showing that 's the case ? 
  it takes two to tango and the uk gov ca n't do miracles , but it * should * do its part . 
  if the other partner does n't want to even accept that the problem exists , that 's not the fault of the uk government . 
  the whole reason why the government was forced into this is because the same groups who are condemning the laws have n't done their fucking job properly .
