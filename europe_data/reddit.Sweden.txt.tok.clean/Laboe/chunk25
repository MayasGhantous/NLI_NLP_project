  and since whites are more spread out over london it makes them seem more numerous . 
  `` london school of hygene '' . 
  no , not getting any eugenic vibes at all . 
  so i feel like romania is now the new poland which was the new estonia and estonia is now almost nordic . 
  i 've never been to romania , shamefully enough , but i certainly want to go before it becomes too developed . 
  you want to see the country with a smidgen of rough individualism before it becomes a carbon-copy of every other western state . 
   many if not most of those who are not actual refugees will be deported not really . 
  most of the deportation laws are for balkan asylum seekers . 
  as a non-pole i would say that it 's not a good sign to see a right-wing party being skeptical of mass immigration and a left-wing ( or `` liberal conservative '' as pis declare themselves ) being pro-asylum immigration . 
  it should n't matter which party you vote for , * both * should be for a national homeland for the polish people . 
  the only disctinction should be on economics and the usual domestic politics . 
  the reality is that most people vote on economic issues . 
  and it 's a terrible loss to permanently lose a credible left-wing alternative on such a fundamental issue . 
  i hope those of you who are more left-leaning do n't give up on pis but make sure that in the next election they do n't betray visegrad - or the polish people . 
  this is just optics . 
  make dramatic changes to asylum policy and then do damage control afterward by doing `` tough headlines . '', 
  people will be fooled by headlines . 
  those of us who read the stats from the relevant sources are not so easily fooled . 
  we see a general trend over the last decades which is increasingly permissive and nothing suggests this will suddenly change . 
  and inviting massive amounts of pakistani/bangladeshi fundamentalists into bradford and east london , too . 
  i do n't get blair . 
  he warns about these things one second but the moment anyone tries to actually deal with the issue he attacks them viciously , accusing them of trying to win over the white working class . 
  this is funny - i thought that was the group labour was supposed to care about ? 
  now it 's suddenly something suspicious ? 
  the guy is intellectually schizophrenic . 
  yeah i 'm aware of the arab slave trade , not just of the arab slave trade of africans but also europeans . 
  i think this more nuanced view of slavery will win out over time . 
  right now , slavery = black people . 
  that kind of ethnocentrism is obviously a lot of blacks want to preserve , so that they can claim sole victimhood of slavery . 
  in a way , it makes sense . 
  the more universal slavery becomes , the less their suffering is ` unique ' , and so their demands become harder to push through . 
  you 're not getting the point . 
  it 's not whether this should be counted as free speech or not . 
  it 's whether it is incitement to violence or not . 
  and i do n't think you 'd be as sanguine if someone tweeted kill all jews/blacks/women . 
  which is of course the point , the social hypocrisy at play here allows a bigot like her to say these things because she knows a bunch of apologists like you will leap to her defence for her racism . 
  again , understand the difference between someone 's right to be a bigot - which i support - and whether or not we should classify them as a bigot , which you do n't even want to do . 
  if someone says that all white men should be killed and you say that is n't incitement to violence then that is absolute idiocy . 
  and it 's a * separate * discussion whether it should be allowed to be said or not ( it should ) , which is what you 're not getting . 
  apologists for racism like yourself is what allows her to be comfortable to spout her bigotry in the first place . 
  so i 'm not surprised i 'm seeing this filth coming from you . 
  also not surprised you 're an american . 
  this kind of cancerous apologetics is an american import , so you 're playing your part in defending the virulent strain of racism that is coming from your shores . 
  apologists for racists are no better than the racists that they are defending . 
  the issue is n't whether she is allowed to say what she said , it 's whether it 's incitement at all . 
  and to deny that is to side with the bigot . 
  taking in 500k is a bad deal . 
  also , the lesson of this summer has been that most of the migrants coming are ** not ** from syria , so this does n't really adress the root causes of the problem , the progressively loosened asylum rules in northern europe in particular . 
  i also doubt whether erdogan is as weak on this as the diplomat states . 
  europe just is n't willing to play hardball . 
  this ultimately rests on turkey being a reliable and trustworthy actor and if the war against isis has proved anything it is that it 's * not * . 
  they have been funneling arms to islamists and turned a blind eye at the border as jihadists have been pouring in from all over the world . 
  when they finally lifted their asses they just went after the kurds . 
  we 'll end up with 500k more refugees and with an incredibly untrustworthy `` partner '' whom we ca n't trust and has shown itself to be unable to be trusted . 
  of course we 'll shower them with cash for their troubles on top of this , too . 
  bad deal . 
  take no extra refugees . 
  play hardball on visa rules , and give concessions only ** after ** you have clear progress . 
  do n't give away the farm before you get anything in return . 
  and change the policies of `` safe third countries '' , as well . 
  since most of the migrants are coming from non-western democracies it 's a joke to be demanding that you need almost that level of stability to send them back in the first place . 
  this would also take away erdogan 's leverage in his wish to whitewash his oppression and anti-democratic policies at home . 
  but the eucrats did n't do that . 
  they caved massively and gave away all leverage before he even had to do anything . 
  the negotiating tactics of this is a disaster . 
   meanwhile turkey ( not erdogan ) has a history of secular islamic society under ataturk ataturk forced secularism onto turkey in the same manner merkel is forcing 3rd world migrants onto germany today . 
  the difference being that ataturk was far more radical even dictatorial at times . 
  the events in turkey over the last decades as genuine democracy and not military rule has prevailed has been a slow but steady rejection of secularism . 
  turkey is still more secular than most other muslim nations but much less so than it used to be in the 60s or 70s . 
  bringing up slave trade in this day and age ? 
  sweden did n't even have black people up until 40-50 years ago , while the slave trade ended centuries ago . 
  how are these even connected ? 
  also , this :  `` a real fear within the communities , especially for young black men , that they could be violently attacked at any time . '' by and large , my experiences with black people have been quite positive in sweden . 
  i would also seriously question this statement . 
  there 's a * lot * of tension between swedes and arabs and muslim arabs in particular but the notion that black men are under threat of violence seems to me to be laughable . 
  i ca n't recall a single instance i 've either seen or witnessed black men and white men fight . 
  in fact one of the things which is quite apparent to me is how integrated most blacks are by comparison to arabs , who often cluster more in their own groups . 
  there 's a massive exception to this rule and it 's called somalis . 
  they are often very hardline muslims and i 've met turks or other more `` moderate '' muslims who often tell me that they are the worst , but i do n't think that 's because of race but rather of extreme religious views . 
  there is latent racism against blacks in sweden , such as in hiring , there 's no point in trying to deny that . 
  but saying young black men face imminent violence or seriously suggesting the slave trade is somehow having an impact today is ridiculous and risks turning people off from the more subtle forms of discrimination that are indeed there . 
  ( yes i know , un reports are often totally bs , but the record needs to be set straight anyway ) . 
  you 're absolutely correct . 
  this is a racist bigot , but also a sexist one . 
  seems bigotry comes rolled into many forms . 
   its not inciting violence at all . 
  no , kill all white people is n't inciting violence . 
  it 's inviting murder onto white people . 
   can you prove she thought people would really go out and kill white people because she said so ? 
  if i said , kill all the jews , can you prove that it 's my intent to kill all the jews because i said so ? 
  go back to srs you fucking piece of trash . 
  except that they are harassing people for their skin color , as this woman demonstrated . 
  it will continue so long as white people will permit it to continue . 
  simple as that . 
   voter turnout for most elections is around 20-25 % which lets fringe idiots like this get into power . 
  which is the problem  i 'm honestly yet to meet someone who actually likes the people running their su , even the people i know from this uni dislike their union and it 's probably the most radical-left in the uk . 
  which is an even greater problem . 
  because if people are apathetic , then these things will happen . 
  people can only blame themselves because their passivity allows bigotry to flourish . 
  it 's not enough to whine in the aftermath ; you have to proactively prevent racist bigots like her to take these positions in the first place .
