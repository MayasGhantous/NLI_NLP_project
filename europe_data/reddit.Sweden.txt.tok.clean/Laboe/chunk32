  disrespect is not a perfect translation but it is in within the ballrange . 
  it 's not at all `` inciting to hatred '' . 
  that 's snokus pushing his propaganda . 
  religious reformation has to come from within , but it can also be catalysed from outside . 
  the catholic church went through the reformation in no small part because of the devasting critiques of the enlightenment philosophers . 
  judaism went through a similar phase with the haskalah , because a lot of jews had absorbed the values of secularism and modernity and mendelsohn , the german jew who was the driving force behind the haskalah , saw judaism as outmoded and in dire need of reform . 
  today , what can be called ` original ' judaism - ultra-orthodox judaism - is very small compared to the mainstream branches of judaism ( reform , conservative/masorti and modern orthodox ) . 
  it 's easy to forget that the so-called ` mainstream ' did n't even exist 150 years ago . 
  talk about a massive religious revolution !, 
  the point is , outside pressure compelled liberal reformers within each religion to change and to modernise . 
  if said outside pressure had n't been there , there would be no change . 
  but it 's * also * important to recognise that the outside world ca n't do everything . 
  there also has to be a core within the religion willing to do what 's needed , and an even larger group who may not agree with their efforts but who are * tolerant * of their experimentation . 
  mendelsohn did n't have a lot of jewish fans but he never seriously had to fear for his life . 
  you may not like how ultra-orthodox jews lead their lives , but you do n't have to worry about them killing you if breach their religious codes . 
  they will shun you , but they will not harm you . 
  but you * do * have to worry for violence if you offend hardline muslims in a far greater frequency than for hardline jews or christians . 
  as important as it is to highlight the deleterious effects of the muslim immigration wave , we must also accept the fact that those who suffer the most are * not * white christians . 
  the rotherham sex abuse scandal may have been suppressed , but eventually it would be uncovered . 
  a british-pakistani journalist made the point after the scandal broke that while it was important to get to the bottom of the scandal , and uncover the reasons why it was hushed down , she also felt that the victims of similar sex abuse but who are brown , and not white , are too often ignored or silenced . 
  ( she later came out and admitted that she had been a victim of sex abuse as a child by men in her own community ) . 
  if you think it 's tough being christian or an atheist in bradford or east london - try being christian or atheist in pakistan . 
  yet we rarely read about those people in the bbc , because they are so conveniently ignored and marginalised . 
  edit : i think [ this ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/12/third-atheist-blogger-killed-in-bangladesh-after-knife-attack ) is a rare exception , where the media does cover it , albeit sporadically . 
  remember , these things do n't happen overnight . 
  first you crush the domestic resistance , then you export the fundamentalism abroad . 
  i know the link has been posted before , but i just wanted to focus on this aspect . 
  spain and france - together with italy - are the tourist supowerpowers in europe . 
  and yet , overnight tourist nights was * higher * in the uk in 2014 than for either france or spain . 
  so how did this happen ? 
  this was even before the uk [ streamlined ] ( http://skift.com/2015/08/17/chinese-tourist-spending-up-45-percent-in-uk-in-response-to-streamlined-european-visas/ ) its visas . 
  3 quick thoughts : 1 . 
  the most impressive gainer is not any ee country . 
  [ ** look at norway !, 
  ** ] ( https://i.imgur.com/8wbb8zx.png ) starting from their high position they have increased a healthy amount . 
  now more productive than u.s. workers by a significant margin . 
  actually norway 's increases are even * more * impressive when you consider how dependent they are on oil/gas exports . 
  many of these countries suffer from so-called `` resource curses '' or the `` dutch disease '' . 
  money is so easy to get , that you lose discipline and productivity falls because the economy becomes so reliant on fossil fuels . 
  this is certainly something canada has been suffering from . 
  looking at the [ original source ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tec00116&amp;plugin=1 ) of data , i was surprised to see japan losing ground . 
  falling population does n't necessarily mean falling productivity . 
  what the hell are you doing , anglos ? 
  it 's amazing to me to see how underappreciated china is in europe . 
  we 're the only major region in the world which has a trade surplus with them . 
  eu/china trade is bigger than eu/us trade . 
  we 're their biggest trade partner . 
  yeah , china is close to russia but honestly , i hope one day russia joins the eu ( which would of course be impossible as long as the u.s. is in nato , but over the long term it makes sense ) . 
  china also is not very likely to start idiotic wars in the middle east , the consequences of which we would then clean up in terms of these massive asylum waves we see now due to the political fallout of the iraq war . 
  they are very pragmatic and realistic in their mindset . 
  yet in survey after survey all i can see is lukewarm support at best or downright hostility at worst . 
  it 's sad . 
  hopefully one day , chinese-eu relations finally get the boost they need , for i often feel the chinese go unappreciated while everyone is often overestimating the contribution of ` murica . 
  if you think the u.s. will go to war against russia over a baltic state then i have a bridge to sell you . 
  why ? 
  i do n't get how some europeans must always find other groups as token examples instead of defending their own group 's interests on its own merits . 
  typical example : `` if we get all these muslim immigrants , jews wo n't be treated well '' . 
  that 's true , look no further than malm\u00f6 , paris , east london etc. 
  but the * vast majority * of people who will be harassed are non-jews , many of them women and gays , most of whom will be white christians ( culturally speaking ) . 
  people assimilate the concept that white christians do n't deserve to be defended , so they instead try to find other groups , whether it is jews or in your case syrians back home . 
  but the reality is : most people in europe are white people whose ancestors have lived in the place for centuries . 
  there 's no point in trying to circumvent that fact by picking the smallest group , the furthest out when everyone knows you 're not * really * concerned about syrians back home when you make this argument and it 's time to own up to that . 
  think of the poisonous effect it has . 
  it reinforces the notion i described earlier , that you somehow must have a minority bonus point in the victim hierarchy pyramid in order to even be heard . 
  and i say that 's bs . 
  and if you keep using arguments like you just did , you just show that you 've assimilated the concept that the people you belong to do n't deserve to be defended and i think that 's a disgusting mindset . 
  tl ; dr : do n't say `` syrians back home '' when you * really * mean `` why is nobody interested in the opinions of the native europeans '' , because let 's be brutually honest , that 's what really is driving your concern . 
  and that is 100 % okay . 
  you did n't describe last week tonight . 
  you 've described literally every talk show ever in the history of tv . 
  when people talk about diversity they often talk about race or gender . 
  i do n't give two shits if all the anchors are white men if they all hold the same opinions . 
  and changing them out for people who are superifically different but who are carbon-copies of them on the inside changes just about * nothing * . 
  borderline yurop stronk thread here . 
  europe does n't have a lot of world-class tech companies * except * when it comes to the backend . 
  ericsson , nokia networks , alcatel-lucent etc. 
  so this makes perfect sense in that respect . 
  iirc the eu also has a close partnership with korea on 5g . 
  tell me again how the turkish deal is all that amazing . 
  the skeptics were right : relying on erdogan was a fool 's errand . 
  the turkish deal was n't even that impactful . 
  a bigger impact was the closing of the balkan route . 
  the next biggest step will be to get the incentive structure in line . 
  merkel is still resisting . 
  she refused to put a formal cap on the numbers at the last meeting in bratislava . 
  until germany yields , and to some extent sweden/nl and the other norther european countries , not much will happen . 
  as far as i understand , the title is slightly incorrect . 
  it 's a museum of the jews in romania generally , which has a subsection dedicated to the shoah . 
  i do n't mind a museum of the shoah , but i hope they emphasise that more people died in the nazi purges than just jews . 
  they often just add a few lines about roma/homosexuals/dissidents / ethnic slavs , but there have been instances where there had to be pressure to release more info because nothing was said about them . 
  even if the museum is dedicated to one group , it is important to have context . 
  germany has stated it will take in 300k asylum seekers over the coming years . 
  while that is still much lower than 1 million , in proportion to the uk it 's is very , very high . 
  hence my scorn of the so-called `` tightening '' . 
   its easier to deport them show me the proof . 
  because germany 's own interior minister does n't exactly seem like he has [ an easy time ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/europe-wants-to-deport-afghan-migrants-but-kabul-is-reluctant-to-accept-them/2016/03/17/8b2d9e6a-e54e-11e5-a9ce-681055c7a05f_story.html ) . 
  now take that story with the afghanis and multiply it by 50 , to states across central asia , middle east and of course ssa . 
  sweden 's interior minister said he was going to deport 80,000 over the coming years . 
  the pace since he said that has been as slow as before . 
  do n't believe the overheated rhetoric .
