  china had perfect excuses to employ from the time mao died , yet they went about reforming their economy . 
  why is it that countries like thailand have stagnated but countries like malaysia have not ? 
  people like to find external excuses to absolve their own countries . 
  i 've had this debate with quite a few italians , as well , they are defensive as * fuck * . 
  in reality , they have grown so poorly because italy did n't do enough structural reforms when times were good . 
  that requires discipline . 
  doing reforms in a crisis is easy , but crisis does n't last forever , or at least the * sense * of crisis . 
  coming for you danskj\u00e4vlar . 
  this is hilarious and speaks to the level of economic ignorance so common on reddit . 
  you 're comparing current prices and * constant * prices ( used by op , correctly ) and think you 've debunked anything . 
  you have not done that , except expose your own ignorance . 
  here is the * real * way you should look at italy . 
  http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.pcap.kd?end=2015&amp;locations=it&amp;start=1996 as you can see , italy has basically gone nowhere . 
  no , it 's a farce . 
  it 's the correct one . 
  credit agencies need to be put down from their pedestal . 
  they have * way * too much power . 
  there 's no oversight . 
  why are all the major important ones based in the anglosphere ? 
  it 's madness that this system has n't been reformed yet . 
  there have been attempts to diversify the list but more needs to be done . 
  turkey should worry about a lot things , but discredited credit agencies is [ at the bottom of that list ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/credit_rating_agencies_and_the_subprime_crisis ) . 
  that would take away the propaganda narrative for intervention . 
  keep spreading your bs about `` moderate rebels '' . 
  people like you pave the way for islamist fundamentalists . 
  useful idiots , is what lenin called you types . 
  it 's useful to always ask the counter-factual : * what are the alternatives * ? 
  do you really buy the propaganda bs about the so-called ` moderate rebels ' ? 
  assad is a total asshole . 
  guess what , so was saddam . 
  was toppling him a great idea ? 
  what about gadaffi ? 
  this is the thing with the people who think `` dictator = bad '' . 
  what they do n't seem to understand is that the alternative is n't necessarily jeffersonian democrats but more akin to al-qaida , as we saw in iraq , or isis in syria . 
  in libya , the islamists are basically cut of the same cloth . 
  `` more '' is a vague term and a meaningless one at that . 
  what matters is not if `` more '' is invested , after all , 5 % , 10 % or even 20 % more is still `` more '' . 
  what matters is whether * sufficient * is being invested for what i am talking about . 
  and the answer is no . 
  there is n't a big city in the west that i am aware of that has gone for a car-free vision and put their money where their mouth is . 
  everything you say is not set in stone . 
  how fast something goes , how often it goes and to what location it goes is a matter of budgetary priorities . 
  just because something is n't viable today does n't mean it wo n't become so tomorrow . 
  with that attitude , renewable energy would never have been built out the way it is in the process right now . 
  it 's a declinist/static mentality which refuses to accept that things can and should change . 
  get rid of the car . 
  you do n't need it , is my point , if you live in big cities and spend your life there for most of the time . 
  at least in modern western countries like france . 
  ca n't speak for less developed countries like cuba where public transit might or might not be as well developed . 
  hell , tgv high-speed trains can take you all around france if you want to . 
  there just is n't a compelling reason to even have cars in paris . 
  if someone lives in rural areas , it 's different , but we 're not talking rural areas . 
  we 're talking giant urban centers . 
  most people just use their car within short distances inside the city . 
  that kind of pollution is incredibly harmful/toxic to our bodies and it 's noisy as well , too . 
   anti-refugee and anti-immigration the two are not the same and it 's important to separate them . 
  i doubt a lot of people would have anything against a sensible immigration policy like that of canada or australia , mostly matched with high-skilled migrants from culturally compatible nations . 
  mixing refugee migration with immigration overall is a big mistake . 
  do n't conflate them . 
  one is a subset of the other , which can form in many different shapes . 
   if anything , it preaches to the choir of / r/europe . 
  look at all the opinion polls across europe . 
  even * sweden * has a 3-1 `` we need less refugees '' concensus according to most opinion polls . 
  germans are also very wary of the current status quo . 
  it 's popular to portray / r/europe as somekind of far-right outlier among some pro-open borders posters here , but in reality , / r/europe reflects the general trend across the continent . 
  if you only hang out among young , urban/cosmopolitan left-wingers , then it 's no wonder some people get a bubble-like effect . 
  read the polls on migration a little bit better next time , and you might come across as more informed . 
   popcorn  morning, 
   ~ ~ as a brit ~ ~ as a `` global citizen '' ftfy, 
  hindus explain indians better than generic `` asians '' , even if it is n't as good as just indians . 
  ( not all indians are from a hindu background ) . 
  literally quoting myself  if there are further needs in terms of buses or metro stations , then invest in those to build it out even more . 
  the bait is real . 
  well done , lads :d, 
  shock !, 
  you 're telling me that after 1 year of non-stop demonisation , there is a public fallout ? 
  his actual policies are , by and large , popular ( except immigration , but most of those voters are n't going to vote labour anyway ) . 
  there has been a relentless campaign of character assassination . 
  we 've been treated to a barrage of smears that paints him as a dangerous jew-hater who may even be an agent of kremlin for having the temerity to suggest that there is a way to actually do some diplomacy before immediately saber-rattling . 
  it 's the same tired smears you see in the american msm , not only of trump but also of jill stein of the green party . 
  if sanders became the nominee in the democrats , he would have faced the same onslaught . 
  anyone not toeing the neoliberal/neocon line will inevitably be tarred and feathered . 
  it 's na\u00efve to think that the mass media has no impact on people 's opinions . 
  chomsky wrote of the phrase `` manufacturing consent '' for this very reason . 
  stop buying into the msm smears . 
  you ca n't forever move to the right and become little else but a prop to neoliberalism . 
  if you actually look at corbyn 's proposals ( nationalisation of railways , increased taxes on the rich , pro-green * real * policies , not empty talk like the tories ) , they are very popular . 
  he has his weaknesses , ( weak on trident . 
  weak on immigration ) , but these are par for the course of every left-winger . 
  the left has to get out of its rut that the only way to get elected is to become neoliberal shills but with prettier rhetoric . 
  furthermore , if you look at the polls , labour is doing about low-30s . 
  if anyone thinks that a clown like smith ( who desperately tried to ape corbyn ) would do better , they are deluding themselves . 
  furthermore , the labour core members are the ones who get out and knock on doors and actually give their time , money and effort . 
  if the people who sit on the sidelines and whine all day would actually get involved , they 'd see a different party : guess what , most core labour members want a real socialist alternative and so does a sizable portion of the country . 
  may intrinsically also understands that hardcore toryism is n't that popular . 
  look at the disaster they 're doing to the nhs . 
  she 's moving to the left economically . 
  british politics is actually moving * leftward * , not rightward . 
  tories only being able to keep in power by moving to the left . 
  ethnic conflict is rising fast in europe .
