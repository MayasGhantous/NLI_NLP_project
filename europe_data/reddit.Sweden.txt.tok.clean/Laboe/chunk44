  the only reason why they have n't completely excluded it is because they know that will get them nothing in return for a burned bridge if they outright say it . 
  all their actions point in that direction , though . 
   he also never really tried to seek a direct confrontation with brussels do you [ even read news ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/52e947/viktor_orb%c3%a1n_vows_life_and_death_battle_with/ ) bro ? 
   he 's basically using kaczy\u0144ski as a `` useful idiot '' to increase his own position in the european structures you keep painting orban as this europhile man who is merely using the poles for unknown ends . 
  well , it is a * very * strange way to get more influence by allying yourself so tightly with someone who is deeply hostile to the liberal-cosmopolitan concensus driven by germany . 
  have you read orban 's speeches the last few years ? 
  maybe you should start . 
  the man genuinely and deeply holds beliefs anti-thetical to the status quo of the current core eu countries . 
  furthermore , he has promised to block any attempts to exclude poland from any eu institutions , meaning that any venice commission is completely toothless to do anything than to issue watered-down statements . 
  i think you live in a fantasy world if you think orban is not genuine . 
  his entire political act in life tells us otherwise . 
  [ did you get the memo ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-britain-germany-weimar-iduskcn1130s7 ) . 
  you 're getting downvoted for facts . 
  it 's true though . 
  bloomberg wrote a recent article just how enornmously dependent on german supply-chain investment [ czechia is ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-06/beach-bound-workers-expose-one-trick-pony-side-of-czech-economy ) , even if other car companies also produce in the nation , germany is the leading light there . 
  that tells me this is less about any cultural clash and more about the fact that the czechs are scared just how dependent on german investment they are ( as are slovakia ) . 
  hungary and poland are also in this nexus , but both countries are not as reliant to the same degree . 
  i 've looked at opinion polls comparing attitudes on for instance refugees in v4 and what surprised me was that the most negative was not poland or hungary , but czechia and slovakia . 
  one should also keep in mind that the slovaks have elected a party that is * literally * a neo-nazi parti in the last election . 
  the governments of both of those states are both social democrats - although fico got kicked out of the social democrat grouping in the european parliament recently for being `` racist '' - but their electorates are if anything even more right-wing than hungary 's or poland 's . 
  i do n't think the v4 is under threat for this reason alone . 
  i do , however , think that this cultural talk is basically just a sham to hide the fact that both czechia and slovakia are extremely dependent on german auto investment . 
  this is [ especially the case ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-06/beach-bound-workers-expose-one-trick-pony-side-of-czech-economy ) in czechia . 
  tl ; dr economic necessity , not cultural values . 
  your former foreign minister basically admitted to giving `` america a blowjob and we got nothing in return '' . 
  meanwhile , poland hosted the most successful nato summit in recent years this past summer . 
  a lot of people who harped on poland 's `` isolation '' ended up with eggs on their faces . 
  to be frank , the polish liberals , whom i assume you are part of , always overestimated the importance of poland , in both ways . 
  to put it another way , no matter how much you licked the boots of the americans ( or gave them blowjobs , as your former fm put it ) , they were never going to help you out unless the geopolitical situation demanded so . 
  so in the aftermath of the russian invasion , no matter who was in power , they were going to get help . 
  remember that the us was * this * close to taiwan when it was a non-democratic dictatorship , because it helped to offset china . 
  taiwan went democratic in no small part because of the rising power of china . 
  they thought that could offset the growing realisation on the part of americans that taiwan just is n't worth defending . 
  it did n't help . 
  sure , the us still sends some missiles to taiwan out of curtesy ( and $ $ $ ) , but nobody seriously expects them to defend taiwan in a war against china today . 
  democratic values or not , in the end , you 're only worth as much as your piece in a larger puzzle . 
  pis actually understands that , many polish liberals do n't . 
  the turkey deal is actually overblown . 
  most of the flows were stopped due to the closing of the balkan route . 
  the v4 did much more to stop this than whatever clusterfuck came from the famed so-called `` franco-german '' axis . 
  merkel 's refugee policies are n't even popular in her own country . 
  you need to get updated . 
  you 're mightily delusional if you think hungary or poland would be replaced by turkey in the v4 , given that turkey has something of a net -85 favourability rating . 
  the uk is an outlier in terms of cigarette usage , though , like the nordics . 
  i am disgusted and shocked every time i go to continental europe that my lungs are filled with toxic smoke on every corner . 
  no offence but what a shitty attitude she displayed . 
  i would have fined her . 
  there are plenty of worse places than the balkans with far lower smoking per capita . 
  you 're just throwing out bs excuses to save face . 
  there are no excuses or rationalisations . 
  there are only fuck-ups with regards to the balkans in this area . 
  fuck that . 
  good on them for enforcing the ban . 
  smoking should be made as uncomfortable as humanely possible . 
  it 's the only way to stamp it out for good . 
   it 's a remnant from the past ( younger people are much more civil and polite ) and that 's why all the examples in the video are crusty old men . 
  that 's hopeful and should put an end to the culturally deterministic lazy smears of greeks as hopelessy corrupt in all eternity no matter what . 
  it 'll improve one funeral at a time . 
  harsh , but true . 
  taiwan is disordered ? 
  it all makes perfect sense now . 
  everytime eu officials come around , the authorities just call in the harry potter train to underline in what desperate need of funds they are . 
  10/10 , would do again . 
   a group of 30 youths attacked two men remember when people used to talk about the british sense of fair play ? 
  yeah , that was * hilarious * . 
  they never saw it coming !, 
  `` greenest government ever '' . 
  i liked the greek ones the most . 
  i thought the italian one was * ridicolously * sophisticated . 
  i still do n't get it , even after the cartoonist 's explanation . 
   the tribes on the left include one we call democratic socialists ( 8 % ) who are very open to immigration and the single market but also want higher taxes on the wealthy and businesses . 
   they are mostly abc1s [ well-eduated middle-class ] , living in urban areas in scotland and wales . 
  then there is the community tribe ( 5 % ) -- mainly working-class voters in northern england and the midlands -- who agree on the need for income redistribution through the tax system but strongly disagree with the democratic socialists about immigration , wanting strict curbs . 
  i was frankly surprised how low the `` community tribe '' grouping got . 
  this would either suggest that the tories and ukip have already largely cannabilised the white-working class vote who are skeptics to multiculturalism or there may be some methodological issues . 
   the left is divided not just from the right , but among its composite parts . 
  this seems to me to be the most salient part of the report . 
  in fact , i would even go to the article itself to point this out , as the author writes :  whether britain should be an ** open ** multicultural society or a ** closed ** , ethnically homogenous one it is telling that those seeking a homogenous state are described as having a `` closed '' vision , which is a negative word ( closed-minded etc ) in the context . 
  this is probably the author 's subconscious bias , but also indicative of the splits on this issue which the report highlights . 
  overall , i kind of like the fact that the british are doing these kinds of in-depth surveys of the voters , not just their political preferences in terms of party politics or given yes/no question on immigration but more deeply-researched efforts to map out the electorate as it stands . 
  my guesstimate is that the findings here are probabl congruent with the electorial situation in a lot of western european countries in terms of the intra-left split on migration . 
  least unexpected announcement ever . 
   there 's no one correct way of dealing with such things . 
  nonsense . 
  russia put stalin 's bust in the red square . 
  germany has tried to purge every last remnant of nazism , and by consequence hitler as well . 
  one approach is clearly better than the other . 
  to pretend otherwise is cowardly . 
  indeed . 
  that guy 's comment is indicative of what happens when a country does n't clean up its past and take full responsibility for it , including in the education system . 
   user stalin1941 is a high school teacher oh boy . 
  hitler and his gang literally saw slavs as subhuman . 
  the level of ignorance coming from you is astounding . 
  go to rinkeby if you want to liven up your life . 
  i can sponsor your trip , so maybe you wo n't say such moronic things in the future . 
  win-win . 
   crime  germans have to go to the ecb wut, 
  you kind of are . 
  i mean that anecdote is useless . 
  germans were occupying the country and caused massive carnage/mass death in the wake of the warsaw uprising .
