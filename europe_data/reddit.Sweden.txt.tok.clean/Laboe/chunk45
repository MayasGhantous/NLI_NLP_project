  they were not genteel by any measure . 
  the russians were n't better , but two wrongs does not make one right . 
  the only people who had a good record on treating civilians well in wwii were the americans and to a lesser extent the brits . 
   germans do n't really do that . 
  i question this . 
  i 've seen quite a few german posters in this sub over the last year which has spewed some pretty bad stuff about slavs in general and on occassion poles in particular . 
  i 'm not going to say that they are the majority , they are not , but they are not a one-off either . 
  also , russia views poland all of eastern europe as part of its hegemony . 
  if nato did n't stand in the way , they 'd invade once again as they know they would face little resistance without nato backing up . 
  germany obviously does n't have that hegemonic ambition , their army is a pittance of what it once was . 
  so , while you 're right in trusting germans far more than russia , that does n't mean a ) that many germans do n't look down on slavs/poles , many do and b ) that germany can be trusted . 
  there have been pew polls showing that most germans are not in favor of defending poland if it were attacked , even if a5 was invoked . 
   i have never seen a group more contrite for the sins not specifically to poles . 
  most of their apologetics have been around jews , roma , homosexuals etc. 
  there is still not a lot of focus on anti-polish genocide in germany . 
  so you 're wrong with specific focus on poland . 
  adam smith institute , a libertarian think-tank funded by big business . 
  fucking fifth column . 
  he 's wrong 2 . 
  he 's a [ russian shill ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/51xh0q/moldova_separatist_leader_says_region_should_join/d7fmzc1 ) . 
  probably an ethnic russian living in ` murica or just a putin admirer from the right ( those are common too ) . 
  yes , and by asking them to be loyal/feel proud ( i.e. 
  what nationalism is about ) to germany is instead . 
  you can weaselword around it , but she 's basically asking for a form of nationalism to germany instead . 
  and steinbird is correct . 
  she 's against german nationalism when it comes to ethnic germans but pro-german nationalism when it comes to minorities . 
  it 's shizophrenic in one sense , but it also makes sense in another . 
  she wants a multicultural society and that necessities that ethnic german nationalistic impulses are repressed while loyalty to the german state by minorities is increased . 
  but that still means that she is , in effect , asking for non-whites to be nationalistic about germany * as a multicultural state * . 
  you see the same thing with the dems in recent months being very pro-military as they trotted out that pakistani-american army captain . 
  i 'd never thought i 'd see the day with self-described liberals being overcome in militaristic jingoism , but as long as something is racially/religiously diverse , even patriotism is not safe . 
   why are the people of vilnius so fucking happy ? 
  the difference at the top is very marginal . 
  iirc the number for stockholm was something like 97 % . 
  i believe vilnius was at 98 % or so . 
  so the difference is negligible . 
  it makes more sense to look at clusters , those with  95 % , the 90-95 % group , 85-90 % , 80-85 % and the < 80 % group.the map is a reminder that higher incomes = / = happiness . 
  paris is a perfect example of that . 
  poor coloring . 
  should be from red  yellow  light green  dark green . 
  not light yellow/green to green . 
  it would also be helpful with a numerical ranking interposed . 
  edit : the coloring is even worse than i initially thought . 
  here [ the source file ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/7602753/1-07092016-ap-en.pdf/ba7aedba-bec3-4ae4-a3c0-8207726ad141 ) . 
  as you can see , the map has no higher category than  95 % , yet the coloring is different for sweden and lithuania/norway ( darker green ) , yet all three capitals are in the 95 % + range . 
  so not only are the colors badly made , the map is inaccurate as well . 
   if they did , they 'd ** consider ** that request now read the headline  british police ** may ** allow nothing you have written has disproved the article . 
  the constable never endorsed the practice but * he also never rejected it * . 
  you are then jumping to a conclusion by assuming it would be rejected . 
  but that is * your * interpretation . 
  desperate attempt to undermine the story . 
  try harder next time . 
  nothing he has said is disproving the article . 
  the constable is simply saying they 'd consider it , not an an endorsement but * not * a rejection either . 
  then gnoxic-blue simply jumps to a conclusion and * assumes * it would be rejected . 
  he has no ground or standing to make that assumption . 
  furthermore , the constable should have outright rejected it . 
  the salty downvotes , hahaha, 
  this is not good . 
  if the belarussians do n't get a grip on the situation , there could be a large , restless population in brest in 5-10 years down the line . 
  then you might get the same kind of problems that the french have with calais and massive leakage into poland . 
  these people should be stopped from entering belarus in the first place . 
  poland should talk to those authorities and come up with some plan . 
  ideally russia would be involved , too , but relations between the two countries are rock bottom right now . 
  would n't surprise me if russia was actively encouraging this below the surface both to a ) get rid of a problem for them and b ) destabilise poland . 
  no offence , but the islamic people from the caucasus do n't have a great track record of assimilation . 
  ask the russians how they fit in a christian state . 
  they should seek asylum among fellow muslims . 
  because russia does n't like them is n't an answer why they seek asylum in a catholic country . 
  turkey is not poor . 
  it 's a fellow muslim state . 
  it 's also * much * closer to chechnia than poland is . 
   it 's just my observation i 'll take the observation of a guy who actually lives in poland over someone who does n't . 
   the lack of a single immigration policy in the eu and let 's not pretend that we do n't know why there is n't any . 
  because any such policy would be dominated by the strongest states and as it happens , the strongest states do n't have a sane policy . 
   applying and when get rejected , reapplying how is this not proving what he said about lack of sincerity ? 
  it just shows you are not really respecting the rules of the country you want to live in . 
  when did our mods become so feisty with their flairs ? 
  some will hate the attitude , i 'm personally enjoying it . 
   ava is the one i ca n't really stand though , probably because it 's a name of a detersive here in italy terrible reason . 
  why should someone care what someone has named a capitalistic product in italy which has lasted only a few decades ? 
  ava is a much older name than that . 
   your average internet user is doing better now . 
  in what way is your average internet user doing better than before with this decision , in your view ? 
  their specialty is in financial services , not understanding the nuances of eastern europe . 
  their news op is just a hobby project in terms of revenues of their company and most of it revolves around financial journalism anyway . 
  just because one company is successful in one area does n't mean that automatically translates to a wildly different one . 
  to think otherwise is to succumb to appeal to authority arguments . 
  i honestly do n't know why you struggle with such a basic concept . 
  not spying on each other , under nsa direction . 
  germany spied on other european countries on behalf of uncle sam . 
  that trojan horse role has often been the sidekick act of the brits . 
  france has typically been far more independent-minded . 
  yet despite merkel 's outward appearances of being angry , the only thing she stopped was her own cellphone being monitored ( supposedly ) , she stopped short of saying other states should n't be monitored . 
  i get that the nsa will want to monitor european states regardless of what they say . 
  what i question is people like merkel actively helping them do so . 
  france should have taken a much tougher line . 
  there was and is space to move away from the burgers on this question . 
  it was n't an opportunity taken , for the reasons i 've outlined earlier in the thread . 
  ah , the predictable `` let 's blame the women '' meme .
