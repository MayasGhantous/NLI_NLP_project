  the * vast * majority of the world are very culturally conservative and sexually conservative to boot . 
  the norm in most countries are pre-arranged marriages and pre-martial sex is deeply taboo . 
  naked breasts is not something celebrated in most cultures today . 
  i do n't think most westerners realise just how much of an outlier they are in relation to most of the rest of the world . ^ 1 ________________________________________________ ^ 1 i 'm aware that sexual openess has been a feature of most cultures in times past , but i 'm talking now , in this day and age . 
  when did french politics become so unintentionally hilarious ? 
   apple paid an effective tax rate of 1 % in 2003 on profits of apple sales international . 
  the rate dropped to 0.005 % in 2014 scumbags . 
  finally . 
  just because you 're a tech company does n't mean you can be a tax cheat . 
  also [ shame on the us ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/24/apple-taxes-european-commission ) for defending tax dodgers like apple just because it is an american company . 
   gamergate the fact that gamergate is even brought up tells you everything you need to know about the alt-right . 
  it 's a bunch of a shitposters on the internet . 
  trump is their natural candidate , they trade in memes all day long and trump is nothing but a walking meme . 
  it 's the logical conclusion . 
  as for ethno-nationalism , yes it has been around forever , which is why i said they are not a real movement and just a fad . 
  old wine in new bottle . 
  nothing they stand for is original . 
   he will scream and help his party create chaos the [ dean scream ] ( https://youtu.be/rwknnmrsx7q?t=39s ) , but in a german accent ? 
  this has to happen . 
  he should change name to dr. no and then he can begin a second illustrious career as a bond villain . 
  is n't that agency mostly doing research stuff on land , so you 're not really launching into space ? 
  esa does significant stuff , but that is a separate agency . 
  it 's very easy to say `` well , we 're so pro-immigrant '' when you literally genocided the native population . 
  maybe * they * did n't want to their homeland to be a nation of immigrants from all over the world , but nobody asked them , instead they were killed off , brutalised and put into reservoirs . 
  i do n't mind nuclear from a technological standpoint . 
  most of the newest reactors are very safe and thorium stuff is very impressive from a purely technical background . 
  the problem is that most of the nuclear projects in the eu have been incredibly expensive . 
  hinckley c in the uk is slated to cost 2x the current electrical price . 
  it 's a bad deal for the uk taxpayer . 
  edf 's plant in finland has seen endless delays . 
  despite all the talk of a `` nuclear renaissance '' , it is simply economically not very compelling anymore . 
  add to this the fact that a lot of nuclear experts are in retirement . 
  very few people are educating themselves to beocme engineers in the field anymore , meaning critical personnel is much harder to find today than 30 years ago . 
  we 've had swedish experts basically saying we could have had a fukushima in sweden given the appalling lack of expertise in the country , but that we were purely lucky that we did n't have a [ nuclear meltdown ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/forsmark_nuclear_power_plant#july_2006_incident ) in 2006 with forsmark . 
  it depends what you classify as right-wing . 
  many people - in the west at least - often subconsciously classify parties on a left/right scale on economic issues . 
  pis is leftists are economic issues . 
  this is because the big cultural arguments have , at least up until recently , been mostly taken care of . 
  look at the uk , where the conservatives are introducing gay marriage . 
  if that is not liberal hegemony , then i do n't know what is . 
  and if the social arena is largely characterised by concensus , then the dividing line becomes economic issues . 
  in countries like poland , where the social concensus is much more conservative , the dividing line becomes economics as well , and as such , pis is seen as a left-wing party . 
  remember , po , the liberals , are also quite socially conservative but economically liberal ( as in * real * economic liberals , not the american butchery of the word , where `` liberal '' is in reality social democrat ) . 
   so that other states again meet us with respect this is pure trump . 
  `` nobody respects us anymore '' . 
  anyone who thinks that austria is a laughing stock is a laughing stock himself . 
  of course it has limited power as a smaller nation , but it is very well-respected . 
  it 's like these people * need * a victimhood complex to revolve their identities around . 
   alt-right to be more specific sorry , but this just makes me laugh . 
  nobody even knew what alt-right was 6 months ago . 
  it 's a fad . 
  pis has been around for many years before that . 
  their brand of social conservatism and economic socialism is not new , either . 
  it 's an old type of recipe , just like social liberalism and economic conservatism ( like the uk tories * de facto * stand for today , introducing gay marriage etc ) . 
  thanks . 
  this is the kind of concrete answer i was looking for . 
  `` sending a message '' always sounds so nebolous . 
  it can mean * anything * , depending on who says it ( and who listens ) . 
  what 's with the casual racism in this thread ? 
   so those jews you made soap out of we 're they jews or germans with german passports ? 
  now * that * escalated quickly . 
   alcal\u00e1 [ which one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alcal%c3%a1 ) ? 
  i 've heard that argument , but i just find it disconnected from reality . 
  people say , `` the politicians must listen ! '' . 
  kern has done just that . 
  his foreign minister is against both turkey joining * and * forced migration quotas . 
  he is working hand-in-hand with hungary now . 
  how is this not listening to and responding to the concerns of the voters ? 
  people keep talking as if there is no change . 
  even in germany , merkel is passing tougher asylum laws . 
  sweden has rammed through the toughest law on asylum we 've had for 30 years . 
  yet the rhetoric of `` they are not listening to us '' keeps re-appearing . 
  i just do n't see it being matched with reality . 
  excuse my ignorance , but i still struggle to see any signficance of the austrian presidency . 
  is n't it mostly for show ? 
  i mean , on paper , the president has * some powers * , but in practice he would n't cross the pm , so whoever wins , the brouhaha over the election is inconsequential . 
  additionally , the kern administration has already turned sharply to the right on migration , so it is n't like we would see any meaningful shift anyway . 
  i am just puzzled by the disproportinate attention given to a subject which will have little to impact , whether on austria or on europe . 
  am i wrong ? 
  the uk or poland . 
  i have relatives in london and i know the language quite well . 
  cons are sky-high prices and the fact that while it is easier to immigrate to as an outsider , it 's also less connected to english culture , so you 'd preferably want to live a bit outside the city center . 
  poland because i 've visited the place a few times and the people are cool . 
  i 'm pretty good at languages so i think i could learn it fairly well , plus the english-speaking skills of young educated people in poland today is high , which would carry me through in the meantime . 
  it 's low-crime , and it seems like a place with a vibrant culture , which can be both hard to integrate into but also makes the challenge more exciting . 
  i 'm not really counting the nordics because that would be cheating , especially a country like norway where i 'd barely even have to learn the language . 
  ( i would n't have to in the uk either , but english is the global lingua franca , so it 's not the same ), 
  ireland 's immigration demographics is pretty good , you 're mostly taking in high-skilled asian migration from non-eu , with the exception of nigerians , who tend to be educated and almost all of them are igbos ( christians , so easier to integrate socially ) . 
  the low-skill migration you get is from ee countries , who pose no problem socially . 
  if you had france 's immigrant demographics , i highly doubt you 'd be as tolerant as you are now . 
  similar to how australia does n't have a significant far-right movement . 
  it 's * almost * as if a good immigration policy actually tends to keep societies cohesive and with less frictions . 
  crazy . 
  tl ; dr please get off your high horse . 
  you 're making a simple mistake . 
  nobody is denying that greece made significant errors prior to the crisis . 
  but that * does not * justify the whoolly destructive austerity doctrine that was imposed on them , and not just on them , but on the whole southern eurozone and on countries like croatia and finland ( finland had other problems , like the fall of nokia , but that only compounded the mess ) . 
  i 'm sorry , but your mind has been brainwashed by the german media where germany is never at fault for having pushed a disastrous dogma on southern europe and where economics is portrayed as a morality play . 
  it 's herbert hoover all over again , but this time with a german accent . 
   it 's become less safe for the gay community of which i 'm a member can you give more specifics ?
