  the assassin 's veto . 
  is there any end to your pro-appeasement line ? 
  if people are willing to kill over pictures like these , then those people need to be put into solitary confinement . 
  not pandered to , which is what you 're ( unsurprisingly ) proposing . 
  [ you 're a man of your word ] ( https://www.reddit.com/user/says_jesus_christ#page=1 ), 
  hold it right there , bob , are you implying heresy , namely that canada * is n't * a world-class integrator/assimilator of cultures ? 
  and if european ethnics still have strong feelings for their ancestral homeland in the 2nd and 3rd generation , despite having it easier to integrate into a country that is majority-european , what does that tell you ? 
   in fact , the politicians created treaties with turkey ( through the ec/eec ) that made getting rid of these people again pretty much impossible . 
  then the question arises if they were ever truthful to the german public in the first place through their rhetoric , and thus all the talk about them `` failing '' to meet their own benchmarks is a pointless exercise if the german elites never planned to have them go back in the first place given the treaties being signed . 
  actions speak louder than words . 
   in part - yes . 
  erdogan rallies in germany really show that something is wrong here . 
  there are subcultures . 
  there are parallel societies . 
  there are people who failed to integrate properly . 
  this does n't apply to all of the turks however . 
  many of them are well-integrated . 
  we cant deny that there are problems however . 
  i see you use many but not most . 
  is that me overreading your comment to suggest a majority are not well-integrated ? 
  germany did n't exist 200 years ago , so america as a country has existed for longer . 
  as other people pointed out , the reason why america is easy to assimiliate into is because the european immigrants wiped out the native americans to a large extent . 
  also , america has largely taken in two kinds of groups . 
  the first are low-skill hispanics who come from semi-western backgrounds with a christian cultural core . 
  the main task is to integrate them * economically * , not really culturally . 
  the second is mostly high-skilled asians . 
  given these two demographics , i am skeptical to the conventional wisdom that america is great at integrating people . 
  give them the demographics of sweden 's immigrants and see how well they do . 
  actually , you can already watch that in a state like minnesota , which has the highest concentration of somali-americans in the country . 
  i do n't see them doing amazingly better there than they are in sweden . 
  i think the myth of the amazing american assimiliation needs to be put down to rest . 
  most of the integration/assimiliaton success or failure happens at the border and the people you bring in . 
  it 's why australia has a very high per capita immigration but no major anti-immigration movement compared to , say , france , sweden , germany or the nl . 
   i hope you realise history is not on your side . 
  history is not on his side ? 
  look at china . 
  do they look like a multicultural hegemon to you ? 
  they are already bigger than america on a ppp basis and will pass them on a nominal basis within 20 years , if not sooner . 
  i think you have an * extremely * narrow western-biased world view . 
   that is a horrible attitude to have as a matter of princicple . 
  it 's a horrible attitude to have as a principle that you want to keep your ethnic culture undiluted ? 
  why ? 
  on the one hand you say nothing has to change , on the other you say people who do n't want to change have horrible attitudes . 
   now that the internet allows people to communicate instantly over long distances ( and also air travel making anywhere accessible within 24h ) , the natural consequence is people widening their in-group even further . 
  there 's a long list of failed predictions based on the utopia of technology . 
  we might laugh now , but people said that the advent of the telegraph , mass media and the radio would also reduce wars because people would be able to understand other parts of the world much better . 
  then wwi and wwii happened . 
  also , there were already multicultural empires like the roman and ottoman empires and many other examples many centuries ago . 
  its more accurate to say that human identity is stretchable . 
  for some duration , we can move into supranational identities but those identities tend to become fragmented over time . 
  that 's also why i do n't really buy the paranoia around `` globalism '' . 
  this is just a phase in world history which is n't different from the cosmopolitianism during the roman empire when it was expanding and citizenship no longer required you to be an ethnic northern italian . 
  sooner or late , that collapsed and so will the current paradigm . 
  history does n't even rhyme , it merely repeats itself . 
   people eventually , one day , far from now , widening that in-group to include all humans . 
  then things can really get done vis a vis space colonization , travel , stuff like that ... 
  the one thing i can see uniting humanity is an external threat , and in fact a lot of people have been saying this for decades . 
  but it would kind of defeat the point if we got peace on earth by virtue of having an intergalactic enemy , especially since we 'd likely be technologically inferior and at risk of being wiped out , which would likely remove all constraints on developing a superhuman ai to match them , which brings with another set of challenges . 
  but that is another discussion , 
   the problem was that there were never any serious attempts to integrate these people when they came here because people assumed that they would go back . 
  that 's a fair point , but it does n't really excuse the failure on the part of the german authorities . 
  you 'd have to be incredibly na\u00efve to think people would just go back to a country that back then had a gdp per capita 5x lower than germany . 
  one can make the same point now with regards to those who peddle the myth of `` temporary resettlement '' , especially when syria is even poorer today compared to germany than turkey was then , but that 's another discussion . 
   germany profited immensely off the turks working here certainly , economically speaking , but what merkel is talking about here is beyond the realm of economics and is directly about belonging , loyalty and identity . 
  while she rejects those who claim all turks in germany are agents of erdogan etc , the fact that she even raises her voice like this indicates that she is worried about lack of assimilation . 
  you know germany far better than i do . 
  do you think her concerns are well-founded ? 
  a lot of respect to you op for taking a lot of photos off the beaten track . 
  i appreciate that , as those places are so rarely visited yet more indicative of the life of their citizens . 
  thanks , 
  it looks hilarious when he is dressed like a dandy . 
  i 'm so accustomed to seeing adidas tracksuits everywhere in those pictures . 
  okay , i get that the president gets a cop-out but those kids sure as hell do n't . 
  get away with your logic and thinking , it has no place here !, 
   a country is n't like a computer game where you can just adjust sliders to `` allocate more resources '' there 's always the console . 
  who says he was joking ? 
  very good answer , except this part :  since 2007 turkey has not had a serious economic growth which is n't true . 
  2010-2011 were both close to 10 % per year for you . 
  since then , however , you 've slowed down a lot . 
  on a per capita basis you 're falling behind eastern europe . 
   its interesting yes  turkey is part of europe no, 
  it depends which ones . 
  north-east asians , south-east asians and hindus largely assimilate . 
  hindus actually vote more conservative than whites ^ 1 . 
  their income levels are also at or above white income levels in the uk . 
  on both cultural to economical indicators , they are largely assimilated . 
  this is why we should avoid talking about large blobs of called `` immigrants '' . 
  the diversity within those groups is often far larger than you can find between individual immigrant groups and the white majority . 
  therefore , it depends * which * groups we are talking about . 
  yes . 
  nea/sea/non-islamic south asia ? 
  latin america ? 
  not that i can see . 
  ______________________________________________________ ^ 1 i 'm not implying that voting conservative is a sign in of itself of assimilation . 
  however , as an ethnic minority , you are often compelled to vote for liberal/left parties since it is in your ethnic interest to do so , since they tend to look after minority interests more often as a rule . 
  if a specific group is voting for the right-wing/conservative party , that typically implies a * very * high degree of cultural comfortability , and hence , assimilation . 
  you ca n't be fearmongered into voting 80-90 % socialist because `` dem racists '' will get you otherwise . 
  if you vote socialist , you do it out of principle , not paranoia . 
  i think you are overestimating the importance of the presidency . 
  obama only got stuff done because the 2008 landslide gave the biggest congressional majority in 40 years .
