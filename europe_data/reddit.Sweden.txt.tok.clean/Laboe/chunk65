  what year did you first visit and what year did you return ? 
   rotterdam , which looks like a clinically insane architect was given absolute power elaborate ... 
  what ? 
   if there 's snow , it often starts to melt to form plain slush , which is dirty and wet . 
  if we get a `` real winter '' , it will often be really cold and the snow will whip your face those are swedish problems in general , unless you live in the far north , ca n't fault sthlm for that   also , the buses are n't on time and our already very poor infrastructure ( roads and high ways in this case , they 're build for the 70 's with few lanes and are n't suited for the amounts of cars we have today , and if they actually build new roads ; they 're adapted for the 70 's ) is even worst . 
  you may be stuck in traffic for quite some time . 
  well , most tourists would not be using a car . 
  i find stockholm 's public infrastructure to be quite good . 
  i use mostly metro , though , and the occassional bus , and they are almost always on time . 
  dude , it was a sarcastic comment  they used that phrase as a cover , which my comment was referring to . 
  do i have to put / s everywhere ? 
  there 's a good piece on ev range by zach strahan , an american who now actually lives in poland and is thinking about doing an ev startup there . 
  you can read it [ here ] ( http://evobsession.com/best-electric-car-for-the-average-american/ ) . 
  the key graph , for those lazy , is this : https://i.sli.mg/xbd5hm.png keep in mind that is for ** americans drivers ** . 
  americans tend to drive longer distances than europeans , because they have a more sparesly populated country than that of most european countries . 
  300 km is 186 miles . 
  so a 300 km distance battery pack means you 're covering 97 % of the * american * market within a single charge . 
  the percentage goes up even higher for europeans , but i do n't have the graph for europeans . 
  now you factor in the improvements in charging . 
  fastned is moving from 150 kw to 300 kw charging . 
  at 300 kw charging , you charge at the speed of 1500 km/h . 
  that means , in plain english , that a 300 km range battery gets charged in 12 minutes . 
  and that is on track to be rolled out within this year . 
  by 2025 , charging should take no more than a few minutes . 
  batteries should also be normally giving around 500 km range or more for mainstream models . 
  there will always be that 3 % of the population who want 1000 km range or more on a single charge . 
  evs will provide that as well , but probably for a premium . 
  nevertheless , for mainstream drivers , the 97 % of them , will be completely covered in their daily drive with evs and the charging infrastructure will be ready for them by 2025 , and probably even earlier , both on density and on recharge speed . 
  the technological shift to evs is happening far faster than most people predicted even 5 years ago . 
  hydrogen cars do n't need to be banned because barely anyone is using them in the first place . 
  if that was ever to be changed , they 'll ban them too , but they wo n't need to . 
  i think most people are aware of the model 3 , so i wo n't delve deeper into that . 
  you have the chevy bolt which has similar range . 
  it will come out next year . 
  it will be sold under a different brand name via opel in europe , but it is the same car . 
  vw will update their electric golf this year , getting to 200 km . 
  they are increasing range 15 % per year at this pace . 
  if that pace is kept , they 'll come out with a 700 + km range car by 2025 . 
  that is unlikely , of course , but it nevertheless underlines that by the year in question , range will not be an issue . 
  battery prices drop around 7 % per annum , so even if you do n't invest more money in increasing the battery , you can still increase the range `` for free '' so to speak . 
  nissan will release their new generation leaf next year , which is rumored to be long range ( 300 km + ) . 
  and then we have the * huge * amounts of chinese ev start-ups . 
  leeco will invest several billions of usd in a gigafactory of their own in china . 
  vw will also likely build one in china , and have already pledged 25 % of their cars being electric within 9 years , as atonement for the diesel scandal . 
  they 're being forced to invest in ev research by the justice dept in the u.s. as part of their settlement . 
  i could go on all night , but the tl ; dr is that there is * massive * movement on all fronts . 
  i 'd say that even by 2020 , we will have significant amount of compelling ev choices , cheap , mainstream and with long range . 
  fastned in the nl and many other similar companies are building out the ev infrastructure at break-neck pace right now . 
  all the stars are aligned . 
  now the politicians need to put aside the lobbying and do what 's right . 
  let 's hope you guys take the lead . 
  gas is the term north americans use for petrol . 
  if i know that , despite not having english as my first language , what excuse do you have ? 
  show us the way , dutchies , show us the way . 
   all in the name of investor confidence ftfy, 
  even obama has [ personally admitted ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-36013703 ) that the 2011 libya invasion was his biggest mistake of his presidency . 
  or , to be a bit more precise about it , `` the failure to plan for an aftermath '' . 
  but that 's a cop-out . 
  when a country is ruled by the same person for decades , there is no other structure . 
  if that person goes , so does the country . 
  we 'll pay for that invasion for years and years to come . 
  i have n't visited it on foot , but i 've went through the city in a car several times , and not just the main arteries . 
  i have to say the city looks incredibly drab . 
  even some of the former communist bloc countries have better looking capitals , and i 'm not even counting budapest or prague because thats cheating . 
  i know the backstory of why berlin is more drab/economically depressed than m\u00fcnchen , hamburg or frankfurt . . but you 'd think almost 30 years after re-unification that they 'd do a bit more about it . 
  very well said . 
  as a metapoint , interesting that london , berlin , paris etc have all been called out , especially paris . 
  yet nobody has yet mentioned rome . 
  i 'm not going to , either , because last i visited i was just a kid , so i do n't have the full impressions . 
  but i wonder why rome is n't mentioned , are they doing something better the others are not ? 
  since rome is very well visited , i doubt everyone just forget about it , right ? 
  copenhagen is more important for links to the rest of europe etc. 
  i would nevertheless strongly argue that stockholm is [ very beautiful ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hxywn4joocy/toq5u3vjh8i/aaaaaaaadjq/3ejhwawrunm/s1600/stockholm%252c-sweden-3.jpg ) . 
  especially during the summer , when all the islands are full in bloom and the boats are everywhere . 
  it 's also tourist-friendly , from what i 've heard from friends and relatives . 
  i came there to visit a relative and i was prepared to face an absolute shithole , given the reputation it has . 
  it was n't bad by any stretch of the imagination , i was positively surprised . 
  the city center was beautiful . 
  maybe it was because my expectations were so low , but i agree with you that it does n't have a glorious reputation , in fact quite the opposite . 
  let 's hope not . 
  if it does , then the city will be teeming with tourists . 
  as someone who ( tried ) to move around central prague this summer , it was basically impossible to even hear the majority of people talk czech in many areas , and not just in the city center . 
  sure , tourism season peaks in summer etc , but still . 
  less tourism means more livable cities , with a stronger local culture . 
  there are tradeoffs for everything . 
  edit : i 'm aware of the * massive * hypocrisy of me whining about tourists - even as i was one . 
  i 'm not anti-tourists per se , but all i 'm saying is . . everything in moderation . 
   the damage done to urban fabric of the city by atrocious commie planning was so extensive , that it 's simply impossible to `` rebuild more of the old city '' without spending hundreds of billions on buying out commieblocks littering the center and demolishing them , which is obviously unaffordable indeed , which is why i indicated that what i wanted would be too expensive , but it is practically doable . 
  of course , if the state uses its brutal power , the cost can go down , but there will be a lot of butthurt nimbyism , and for what ? 
  architecture ? 
  most people are not aesthetic . 
   the best thing we can do is to at least make it modern and like most other globopolises , which will still be a huge improvement over the sad state warsaw was in 1989 . 
  given the constraints , i agree . 
  if we believe that architecture is a reflection of a society 's values , then that says everything you need to know about communism . 
  speaking to eastern europeans , i 'm of course preaching to the choir , but still . 
  i know . 
  which is why i wrote :  maybe it would have been more expensive , but i 'd preferred if they tried to ** rebuild **, 
  which is reasonable , because it is based on the same principle as the new law in turkey . 
  what is n't reasonable is turkey 's reaction . 
  this was just a news-ticker .
