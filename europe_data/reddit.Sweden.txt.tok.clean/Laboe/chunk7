  and they 'll be laughing at us for a long time to come , and with good reason . 
  [ from this article . 
  ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-15/how-merkel-went-from-greek-crisis-pariah-to-refugee-crisis-hero ) killer quote :  merkel sees chance to change germany 's image in the world so this is ideological - and deliberate . 
  not `` pragmatic '' , not `` she was dealt this hand '' . 
  she chose it . 
   10,112 of the 33,447 asylum applications that were first filed in august 2015 came ~ ~ ** from people claiming to be ** ~ ~ from syrians . 
  fixed it for you . 
  he needs new friends and acquaintances . 
   tbh , nyt has no reason to slam east europe i 'm more curious about their morbid obsession with eastern europe . 
  why do they care so much ? 
  this is n't the first editorial attacking ee . 
  if they devoted even 10 % of the time they spend on attacking ee to instead asking why the rich gulf arab states do n't take a single one , would n't that be a more sane approach ? 
  but expecting sanity from these people is increasingly , i understand , a pipe dream . 
  they have this obsession with 3rd world immigration to white majority countries . 
  been happening for a long time . 
  just accelerating recently . 
  there are mostly links in german so i figured , why not go with the swedish source that summarised the issue . 
  basically : 1 . 
  anette kahane was an agent for stasi for 8 years . 
  she regularily informed on other german citizens for the communist authority . 
  now she is a professional `` anti-racist '' activist , pushing mass immigration from the 3rd world to europe . 
  the german government does n't like free speech , or criticism to its asylum policy so they have tasked her together with other far left groups to `` monitor facebook '' for `` illegal speech '' . 
  basically this means any dissent against mass immigration from muslim countries is now a criminal offence . 
  of course , this is all done under the guise of `` anti-racism '' , but we all know that the definiton of `` racism '' can stretch a massive amount if the need arises to crush anyone who disagrees . 
  final point . 
  is n't it time we got a 1st amendment in europe , too ? 
   and take in refugees directly from there everything you wrote except this made sense . 
  people have got to look at the numbers . 
  refugee asylum immigration is * extremely * inefficient . 
  so europe loses on both counts : monetary and culturally . 
  there is zero reason to bring any in . 
  if anything , we need deportation programs and yesterday . 
   solidarity only matters in eu when it benefits the older and wealthier states . 
  the arab wave coming now benefits nobody , but unfortunately the wealther western states hold the upper hand , for now . 
  was n't it obvious from the beginning ? 
   it was strongly amplified and distorted by foreign media stop your nonsense . 
  look , we 're all a bit defensive about our respective countries , but the notion that it 's all a bunch of evil foreign media distortions is bs . 
  merkel 's encouragement of asylum immigration was and is real . 
  the comment was shit , it was badly spelled and even worse thought out . 
  do n't use logic on the internet . 
  you still are . 
  you 're pushing this more than any other country and you 're not listening to eastern europe . 
  the irony is that merkel is willing to sacrifice european unity and cohesion for a bunch of arab asylum seekers . 
  she has shown where her loyalty lies . 
  history will judge her harshly . 
   once again ** forced into a crisis ** til : merkel in the eyes of / r/europe simply can do no wrong . 
  even when she fucks up , it 's `` forced upon '' her . 
  no , nothing was forced . 
  she unilaterally took a bunch of idiotic decisions without going for concensus * first * . 
  and it blew up in her face , predictably , and now she 's left cleaning the mess . 
  and what does she do ? 
  she lashes out and she blames everyone but herself . 
  the sign a real leader . 
   reads it through foreign ( non-german ) media outlets that heavily distort everything . 
  said the guy who linked to the guardian a comment ago . 
  really , sometimes the internet gives me so much joy . 
   i have a sneaking suspicion we will soon hear the parties suggest funding for huge refugee zones in southern europe . 
  that we help fund those , - and prepare the public consciousness for letting go of the guilt by sticking to that solution . 
  you may be right but what i do n't get is why these people do n't put up cash in the conflict zone ? 
  or pressure the gulf states . 
  it just seems defeatist to set up refugee zones in southern europe . 
  it 's a pull factor . 
  learn from australia . 
  the myth that these waves ca n't be stopped is just that : total bs . 
   but it is very possible to repatriate the bulk of refugees if the state commits to it . 
  people say that but show me successful examples . 
  the reality is , it 's * very * difficult . 
  even if you get an order ready to deport , a lot of these people just go underground . 
  happens in sweden all the time . 
   you 're giving them too much agency . 
  you give them too little . 
   denmark has a policy of integrating the migrants . 
  policy has n't been very successful , though , has it ? 
  considering that the last election was basically a competition between who could distance themselves the most from mass immigration and multiculturalism . 
  so given that he knows that , is n't his quote kind of stupid ? 
  or at least desperate by most measures . 
  for someone who accuses others of having a eurocentric world view , your view is remarkably eurocentric . 
  everything that muslims do which is fucked up is determined by european actions . 
  they have no agency of their own . 
  whenever there is a fuck-up , invariably it 's europe 's fault . 
  you 're very conventionally leftist in your thinking . 
  nothing original at all . 
  and like a lot of leftists , you have a very eurocentric world view of history , where the actions of europeans is far higher up the hierachy than the actions of non-europeans . 
  which is why you can write stuff like this :  until the europeans came along in the 20th century and drew up their borders , the ` millennia of shia vs sunni wars ' did not really exist take a step back and be amazed at how eurocentric you really are . 
  you let other people get under your skin way too easily , boy . 
  he 's a slanted left-wing guy who thinks the current concensus is `` fact '' when `` history '' - or our current understanding of the past - has always changed depending upon political preferences of the day . 
  today is no different and he 's naive and stupid to think that it is . 
  you could have said that . 
  instead you went into a rage-filled fury and now you 're writing two comments in response which reek of approval-seeking . 
  you got work to do on yourself . 
   your outlook on history is ripped straight off late 19th century treatises and your outlook is ripped straight out of left-wing/marxist viewpoints . 
   it is extremely frowned upon in modern academic history circles hah !, 
  really , what you are doing here is appeal to authority-type of arguments . 
  are you really so stupid as to think that contemporary biases are facts ? 
  that people wo n't look back in 100 years and laugh ? 
  well , you do n't have to wait that long ; i 'm laughing at you * now * . 
  btw : history is not science . 
  views on history changes all the time , even with similar source material . 
  i get why you 'd want to pretend that you 're doing scientific work , except that you 're not . 
  you 're presenting contemporary left-wing biases as fact .
