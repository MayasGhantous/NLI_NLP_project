  it 's not just hungary and poland . 
  even austria 's foreign minister has strongly come out against these quotas . 
  the only thing this proves is how utterly isolated germany is on the migration question . 
  even their own public disaproves of germany 's current refugee policy by over 60 % in the latest poll . 
  these clowns do n't even have their own people on their side . 
   against a russo-turkish powerhouse is this a joke ? 
  the major co-operation that could happen between turkey and russia is not in europe . 
  it is in the middle east . 
  do you * seriously * think the turkish public have any appetite to send their soldiers to die and bleed for some adventurism in an obscure eastern european country ? 
  you have to be utterly delusional . 
  furthermore , russia will carry the pants in any russian/turkish relationship . 
  with regards to the middle east , i do n't see that as a bad thing as russia 's policies have been 100x better than turkey 's pro-islamist stance . 
  europe would benefit if turkey turned into russia 's stooge in the middle east . 
  islamists and jihadists would find it that much harder to go abroad and get training as turkey would no longer close an eye and wink them through . 
  the `` moderate opposition '' would get annihilated . 
  the only two choices in most middle eastern countries is either that the islamists take power or the secular dictator does . 
  neither is pretty , but one sure as hell is uglier than the other . 
  to the mods : i realise this may be an edge case , but my motivation for submitting it lies in the backdrop of the debate about radicalisation in europe . 
  whether we like it or not , the diaspora links outside of europe matters for what happens inside europe , and we have to understand that the communities in our countries are not sealed off to outside influence . 
  in short , what matters * over there * , will affect us * over here * , as the british are now starting to understand and the french , too . 
  surprised it is so low for northern italy . 
  also interesting to see france doing so poorly , given that its gdp per capita is on par with the uk . 
  repping eastern europe , someone has to do it . 
   however , i will say , if their neighbors did not want to loose land they should not have all planned on attacking concurrently and razing israel to the ground . 
  and who is razing whose homes to the ground ? 
  the level of ignorance in this thread is astounding . 
   just because we wimped out over terrorism does n't mean israel has . 
  israel has a terrorism problem for the same reason the british had a terrorism problem in ireland . 
  occupation . 
  europe 's terrorism problem is imported . 
  israelis are very keen on trying to conflate the two so as to build sympathy . 
  you obviously fell for it . 
  the source is filled to the brim with quotes from many other institutions . 
  go to * any * think tank 's website in the uk and search their archives during the brexit campaign and look what they had to say about it . 
  you 'll quickly find the answer very monotone and repetive . 
  if you 're * seriously * going to re-litigate the exposed 350 million lie then all i can do is laugh at you . 
  you 're beyond saving . 
  the article does n't outright mention it , but an underlying question is if the rate is increasing ( on a per capita basis ) or if the authorities are less na\u00efve / better at finding this stuff out in recent years . 
  the statements in the article hints at the latter . 
  in england , they have started to get much better at uncovering cases of fgm , which has led to a rise in the reported statistics , but it is still hard to say whether it was a rise in absolute terms since the data quality decades back is that much poorer . 
  either way , i am glad this is being treated as the crime it is and is being dealt with . 
   it was a possibility of what could be done with the money that is currently paying for eu membership except ** it was n't ** . 
  that 's the whole point . 
  it was never possible . 
  ever . 
  it * does n't * matter if it was an election or a referendum . 
  the entire line was a massive lie from beginning to end . 
  get a modicum of an understanding of how economics work before spouting off stuff you have no grasp of . 
  you [ can do everyone a favor and start here ] ( http://www.nhscampaign.org/nhs-reforms/brexit-and-nhs-funding.html ) . 
   we 're clearly not wanted of course you 're wanted . 
  everyone loves the british ( okay , maybe not the french and their stooges , like juncker ) . 
  but basically europe really likes britain . 
  that is incontestible . 
  the brexit anti-eu smears have gotten to you . 
   if we stayed we are holding back the eu form further integration which it seems is what everyone wants most of the ee nations want a vision closer to the uk . 
  people used to dismiss them , but they won the argument on migration quotas . 
  merkel said borders should be open . 
  now she speaks of protecting the borders from the artic to the mediterreanan . 
  there are more friends in the eu for the uk than you think , and they are not as inconsequential as many believe , as the last year has shown . 
  further , many nordic countries are also close to the uk in your vision of a reformed eu , like denmark and increasingly sweden . 
   boris johnson said we can put # 350m in to the nhs . 
  one person yes , but he was n't corrected by the brexit camp . 
  i 'm sorry , but when their own * campaign bus * is literally painted over with a massive and huge lie , and nobody from that campaign makes a concerted effort to correct that , that speaks ill of the entire campaign , not just `` one person '' . 
   both sides were full of shit . 
  sorry , but that is moral equivalence . 
  sure , cameron made a few hysterical statements about war , but he was quickly shot down by the other remainers and then piped down . 
  you had a much stronger internal bullshit correction within the remain camp , which was totally missing from the leave camp . 
  this reminds me of people trying to equate the gop and the dems , just because being equal makes people get along better . 
  but they are not equal . 
  one side just lies a lot more than the other , and is more dishonest . 
  just because remain were not perfect - nobody is claiming they were - does n't mean we should debase ourselves to moral equivalency for the sake of agreement , when there is no moral equivalency . 
  fundamentally , the decision to leave is regrettable , but i am comfortable with whatever outcome . 
  the world will not come crashing down . 
  whatever poison the brexiteers are trying to fill your brain with , we do n't hate you , we like you . 
  always have , always will . 
  and whatever comes in the coming years , you can count on us and we can count on you if the chips are really down . 
  that 's all that matters , when all is said and done . 
  sorry for the low yearly range , bloomberg does not [ show more than five years ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/quote/gspg10yr:ind ) . 
  however , the headline can be controlled by looking at historical data from spanish statistical sources . 
  i do n't have an ideological boner for or against nuclear , but it is unambigious that nuclear power is getting increasingly pricey . 
  liebreich [ runs down the arguments ] ( http://www.cityam.com/246336/case-hinkley-point-c-has-collapsed-its-time-scrap ) . 
   seemingly unnecessarily a lot of the time it is only brought up in the context above , namely `` europe wants us to fail '' which was - and is - a bullshit smear . 
  you should know that . 
  do n't you think that kind of bs is tiring for * us * to hear ? 
   it 's frustrating for me join the club  at this point it really is flogging a dead horse for you , yes , but this is n't for you . 
  it 's for those who keep insisting on repeating the discredited paranoia/false fantasy of the world is against us . 
  as long as that false meme is repeated , it will need to be corrected . 
  i understand it 's tiresome for you to see , but believe me , i 'm * beyond tired * of seeing this sub smeared as somehow wanting to see the uk fail . 
  it 's nonsensical and utter garbage . 
  whining to me about it will not change it . 
  why do n't you lecture the people perpetuating the myth ? 
  you 'd stop the people spreading the bs and you wo n't see people needing to correct it . 
  it 's a win-win . 
   most of poles earns between 1600 pln and 2600pln ** net ** it does n't make sense to compare gross wages to net wages . 
  everyone 's net wages are smaller than gross wages . 
  the fact remains that the gross average wage in poland is around 1000 euros . 
  how that is distributed is a political question for the polish society , but the point is that the * starting point * is quite high today . 
  net wages are just an indication of a society 's choices ( taxes etc ) , that is why it makes less sense to compare than gross wages . 
   for this major part of society everything is expensive . 
  starting with food , tickets , fuel etc.
