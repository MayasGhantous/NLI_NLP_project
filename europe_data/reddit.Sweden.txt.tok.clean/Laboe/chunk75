  we would degrade their contribution to this world by excusing a mass-murderer like the brother of this athele . 
  he and people like him can not be excused for their life choices , no matter their background . 
  once you choose to murder innocent people , i have zero tolerance for excuses . 
  i hope other people will as well . 
  i wish him the best of luck . 
  we do n't choose our family , it is chosen before our birth . 
  why should he be tarred by the actions of a man who is only linked to him by the accident of genetics ? 
  i 'm aware , but i was n't commenting on turks who came to germany in the 70s , i was commenting on your use of the willkommenskultur as `` a sentiment ** from last year ** '' , heavily implying a break in the current one . 
  hence my surprised tone . 
  for one thing , the g\u00fclenists are islamist fundamentalists which make erdogan look like thomas jefferson . 
  the wiemar republic was a ( decadent/incompetent ) liberal regime which got toppled by a dictatorial far-right movement . 
  you can make a strong case that erdogan is a de facto dictator of turkey , i wo n't argue on that point , but this is the far-right of the islamists trying to toppling the center-right of the islamists . 
  it 's a broken/halting comparison . 
  of course , for secularists , it is a lose-lose , but a g\u00fclen takeover would have been worse in the long run . 
  only reason why some freak out is that a ) g\u00fclen was seen as more pliable to western interests ( just like erdogan used to be seen , remember how that turned out ? ), 
  and b ) it will give erdogan the domestic capital to push through his re-orientation of the presidency and as such give himself formal powers to rule turkey as his little personal fiefdom even more , making him impervious to western pressure . 
   she still has the support of the german people , so her position is secure . 
  in the last poll , 63 % of the people were against her migration/refugee stance . 
  but most people are not one-issue voters . 
  germany 's economy has never been stronger in terms of employment , its current account surplus in * absolute * terms is higher than even china 's , an economy which is 3 times as large . 
  also , she has basically backed down from her policies of last year ( not in rhetoric , but in practice ) . 
  by next year , the amount of refugees who will come will go down to around 300k and likely even less over the longer-term as most germans will find it is difficult to integrate them in the economy . 
  it pays to be cautious . 
   the willlkommenskultur you are refering to is a sentiment from last year . 
  implying it is already dead ? 
  what is this heresy ? 
   why do redditors write about tourette syndrome so much i must have missed that train . 
  i thought that autism was all the rage these days . 
   are you implying that all neo-nazis in germany have tourette syndrome ? 
  why do you say that ? 
  if you are trolling , this is some of the best effort i 've seen in a few hours , i 'll give you that . 
   ... and here are the top 10 reasons why ftfy, 
  it 's misleading to portray it as that , though . 
  most of the left-wing criticism has been around enforcement/numbers . 
  merkel did try to strengthen the law on refugees/asylum earlier this year , but had to water it down after the greens gathered a lot of mps in opposition . 
  it still passed , but in a weakened state . 
  anyway , the article was pretty good and it confirms that merkel will most likely continue being the leader after 2017 , albeit with a weaker base * in europe * , whereas domestically she is still fairly untouchable . 
  first initial impression seems to be that this is not terrorism . 
  either way , either this sub has an extreme interest in germany or the country has a lot of crazy shit happening , or both . 
  nazi tourettes is a common disease in germany . 
  au contraire , danskj\u00e4vel , i have seen the destruction of americanisation of a national culture and i am here to warn the rest of you if you throw away your own and ( try to ) replace it with a foreign culture and import its pathologies . 
  blm is just another step along that way . 
   in college to work with chinese students you were their classmate ? 
  or ta ? 
   brexit and how many of those people 's parents immigrated from the eu ? 
   that 's simply a white invention to profit from minorities where are all these secret schemes i keep hearing about being created ? 
  i want an invite to the ** big white secret world domination convention ** . 
  guys , do n't leave me out of it !, 
  i 've underutilised my white privilege card for far too many years . 
  it 's time to regain lost time . 
  white people in america account for 62 % of the population . 
  that 77 % figure includes hispanics . 
  most of the hispanics are * mestizos * , a term that is unfortunately far too uncommon in america but not in latin america , as it accuarely describes the ethnic background of the vast majority of mexicans and other hisapnics . 
  and even in that 62 % figure , you have people like arabs , central asians like kazakhstanis , turks and others also counted as white . 
  they are going to introduce a new ethnic category for middle easterners in 2020 with the new census , so the real number of european-americans , which i view as the best definition of being white , will be more accurate in the next census . 
   if the same amount of minority populations were transported to europe , europe would be much more racist . 
  doubt it . 
  the british abolished slavery far earlier than the yanks did , for instance . 
  also , life in sweden as a minority is not perfect , but we do n't have the systematic violence you have , especially with police . 
  calm down on the burger patriotism . 
  https://twitter.com/novaramedia/status/761525904464048128 2 minute report from a far-left agitator . 
  interesting inside look . 
  ca n't we have all these nice people on this sub telling us about our mystical `` influence '' we have on turkey , and how for that reason , it 's good if they stay on an eu accession path ? 
  face the fact , there is no influence and they are just milking it to gain legitimacy . 
  cut them loose . 
  say it together folks : americanisation is degeneration . 
  for context : the folks over at / r/ukpolitics have said that only two people have died from police violence in the uk as of this year . 
  guess which race they were :d, 
  if you want to watch something hilarious , here 's a video from our radical feminist party + blm with english subs https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9tzvxxjxpq, 
  savagery . 
  or perhaps the [ management of it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/management_of_savagery ) .

  and even if you would not pay anything on the headline number , you 'd still pay it via taxes . 
  so its a misnomer to begin with . 
  true , but still interesting that germany was more anti-american back then than russia was . 
  the recent decline in russia is a temporary factor . 
  while the anti-americanism in germany is likely more structural . 
  thanks turkey . 
   you seem to think that 30-40 years of aid and consistency in policy did not left their toll on the following 10 years . 
  that 's interesting . 
  most of us aid was concentrated in the 50s to 70s . 
  from the 80s onwards , it was no longer a major factor . 
  just because someone gets aid does not mean they are successful . 
  egypt has gotten billions in us aid for decades . 
  where is egypt today ? 
  it 's na\u00efve to assume aid guarantees success . 
  as for policy consistency , of course that is of a much greater importance , but that is thanks to the korean leadership , not any outside forces . 
  in fact , the us pressured koreans to open up far more than they did , but they went the protectionist route in the early days to protect their industries . 
  neoliberal economics says this is a big no-no . 
  you know what happened ? 
  hyundai happened , because they wanted their own car industry . 
  poland 's biggest mistake was to listen to what it was being told , instead of looking at those developing countries who actually had a track record of doing well . 
   so , using constant dollars , we actually went down ~ 9 % indeed , but ukraine and russia went down even more . 
  even czechia ( ! ), 
  barely moved in the 90s . 
  it was just a horrible decade for most eastern european economies except for a few countries . 
  that 's why we should look at the imf/washington concensus with skeptical eyes instead of blaming it all on those countries . 
  you can blame the countries if it is one or two , but when the entire region is barely walking , a more systematic approach is needed . 
  anything less is to shirk one 's responsibility . 
  i do n't think anyone is denying that poland 's position in 1990 was precarious .
