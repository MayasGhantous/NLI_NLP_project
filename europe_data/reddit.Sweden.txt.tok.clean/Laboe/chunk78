  the neoliberal doctrine imposed on greece has been suffocating and disastrous . 
  / u/shoryukenist is alright , but he has a track record of anti-german , anti-swedish bias . 
  his comment should be put in that context . 
  except norway is n't part of the eu . 
  but who cares about logic ? 
  what happened with ` yobs ' ? 
  the tabloids used to be enamored with that term . 
  that 's good weather for my body . 
  i get fried if i go above 25 for any duration longer than a couple of weeks . 
  the problem is n't summer in northern europe , its our winters . 
  and not even the coldness , but the fucking ** darkness ** . 
  endless , mordor-like darkness . 
  the little sunshine that comes during the day is almost always when you are inside a building ( uni or work ) . 
  ok , maybe things like that are worse in scandinavia than the nl , but still . 
  you take karmawhoring to the next level !, 
  have you visited oslo recently ? 
  do n't see how you 're doing amazingly better . 
  i just do n't get this hysteria over how muslim women are dressing themselves . 
  if a woman wants to have a niqab or whatever , let her . 
  at the * same * time , let her know that if she gets discriminated in the workplace for dressing like a ghost , she has to be prepared for that . 
  she has to bear the consequences of her choice . 
  if she is willing to do that , then she should be treated like an adult . 
  its the same with the hijab . 
  if you actually listen to muslim women , they will tell you , wearing the hijab requires more discipline than not wearing one . 
  a woman who wears one is doing so after a lot of calculation . 
  another myth is that they are all forced by their husbands . 
  in many instances , it is the woman who thinks of it and pushes it through . 
  i 'm less concerned about how muslim women are dressing , than what their beliefs are . 
  they can dress however they want , as long as their fundamental principles are in line with that of the nation at large . 
  if that is true , i do n't see why we should hunt their headscarves . 
  it becomes a convenient foil for those who just want to bash muslims but do n't have any substantative proposal to improve the situation . 
  this should be the top comment . 
  if you pay the money , as long as you do n't do anything overtly illegal , you should be able to dress however you want and hang out with whoever you want at the disclosed location . 
   we still do n't know the motives, 
   but likewise , a staggering amount of people will hold ** equally horrific views ** on just about anything you can imagine you claim you 're not engaged in moral equivalence , repeatedly invoking trump . 
  i have no love lost for him and his ilk , but it is silly to even mention trump fans in the same sentence as people who condone stoning people to death . 
  but reddit told me all refugees in turkey are fake and under no need of protection . 
  i ca n't make someone find something if they are intent in not seeing it because it clashes with their ideology . 
  statistics do beat a oneliner with zero sources and a butthurt tone , though . 
  a very typical mistake ( liberal ) americans make is to believe every system can be replicated . 
  in fact , a swedish economist has spent a lot of time debunking this myth , showing that national culture is much more important . 
  interesting read : http://tino.us/2016/07/exciting-new-book-brother-debunking-utopia-exposing-myth-nordic-socialism/ p.s. 
  is n't it interesting that denmark is now held up as the example to follow ? 
  it used to be sweden 10-15 years ago . 
  the reason for this is that denmark has had far tighter immigration policies than sweden , but i doubt liberal americans want to broach that subject . 
  sweden is the country with the fastest rising inequality in the oecd , in large part because of this very fact . 
  i would n't go that far . 
  sweden had a openly hateful pm between 2006 and 2014 . 
  when i say openly hateful , i 'm talking about a guy who says that `` swedish culture is barbarism '' and similar stuff . 
  he was basically seething with contempt and hatred of swedish national culture . 
  ( in the defence of the swedish people , he did not display those things until 2011 and so ) the point is that in the same year , he drastically loosened asylum rules . 
  he did that for no other reason than that sd came into the riksdag . 
  he explicitly said it was a punishment to their voters . 
  it usually takes a full year for any new changes to truly materialise so from 2013-2015 , we had ever-increasing asylum seekers . 
  now , the government has merely gone back to the pre-2011 legislation . 
  that is n't really a u-turn as much as a normalisation . 
  and even the new rules are only temporary for 3 years . 
  if swedish immigration/integration policy was wildly successful in the pre-2011 era , then i did n't get that memo and i would be grateful if anyone could point me towards a serious analyst who would make that claim . 
  gib time . 
  i 've never been to greece and i do n't know any greeks . 
  i have no special feelings towards the people or the nation . 
  i 'm not being kind , generous or polite . 
  i 'm just calling it as i see it . 
   people voting for the likes of trump , and i 'm equally scared of them i think most of us can agree that trump supporters are not the moral equivalence of people who agree that stoning adulturers is a good thing or that suicide attacks against civilians in the `` defence of islam '' is justified . 
  exactly my thought process as well , which is why i was careful not to categorise this as a terrorist attack either . 
  we still do n't know the motives , or if there was any at all . 
  a better solution would be to promote innovation and support companies like impossible foods and others who make meat out of plants . 
  people are often far too quick to tax/ban things when a better path is to out-innovate your way out of the problem . 
  the problem with gasoline cars will be solved with evs and the problem of animal-based meat will be solved by plant-based meat . 
  far from all who leave syria are economic migrants . 
  sure , many carry false passports and are not even syrian , but it is purposefully misleading to make those kind of blanket statements you make . 
   temporary resettlement while i accept your argument as legitmate , i think its useful to stop spreading the myth of `` temporary resettlement '' . 
  there 's no evidence that most temporary resettlements are anything but permanent if you look back on those instances into western europe since the end of wwii . 
  sure , some always go back , but the vast majority nearly always stay . 
  people employ the term ` temporary ' because it is cost-free , if the national electorate were told its a permanent resettlement , it would making the selling of the deal that much harder . 
  but it would also be more in keeping with the historical record . 
  if most western european countries went through what greece has gone through in the last decade , i highly doubt most of us would come out of it as well as they did . 
  golden dawn-esque parties would probably be far higher in the polls than they currently are in greece . 
  it * is * more peaceful than ever , but that does n't mean we should stop worrying about certain sub-categories getting worse . 
  terrorism as a whole is worsening/deterioating in western europe , even as life in general is getting better . 
  so its important to have those two thoughts in your head at the same time , understand that the media hyperbole is out of touch with reality but * also * deal with a specific problem instead of sweeping it under the carpet . 
  we still do n't know if this was terrorism , so i 'm not making a claim this attack was a terrorist act , i 'm referencing the last year or so re : terrorism . 
  any id of the attacker yet ? 
   no israeli party , including the most right wing , suppors the ethnic cleansing of arabs israel has already had two large-scale ethnic cleansing events . 
  one in '48 and another was in ' 67 . 
  likud has a point when they say that the israeli left are hypocrites , because both of those mass ethnic cleansing events happened under labor , not the right-wing . 
  so whether they are stating that they support it or not is irrelevant . 
  what is relevant is that it has already been carried out - twice . 
   you 're just wrong the poll is accurate . 
  reuvin rivlin takes it seriously , so should you . 
  i 'm sorry if i burst a bubble you had of the average israeli voter . 
  i 'll try to clarify what i mean by ethnocracy . 
  ethnicity is not the same as race . 
  i 'm fully aware that most jews come in all colors , but that is racial groups . 
  so you have arab jews , indian jews , african jews , european jews etc. 
  but all of these disparate groups share a common ethnicity , a common culture and a common religion ^ 1 . 
  israel is built around the premise of a single nation for the jews , an ethnicity . 
  in that sense it is an ethnocracy , like korea or poland . 
  the difference is that you have a big non-jewish minority , but they are there because they lived in the lands before israel was created , not because they were invited in . 
   i just searched up the national front and strongly disagree with your premise .
