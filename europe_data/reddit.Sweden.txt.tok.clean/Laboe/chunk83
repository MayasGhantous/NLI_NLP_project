  people cover for all kinds of things and people . 
  a small minority of those on the left have been covering for islamists because they see them as victims of white supremacy or whatever , even if those islamists hate gay people , women etc. 
  does that mean those leftists also hate gay people/women ? 
  it simply means they are covering for something/someone out of other political considerations . 
  why are you covering for a pro-erdogan shill ? 
  only you can answer that question , but my guess would be turkish nationalism and national pride . 
  right , but let 's put it another way . 
  assume that turkey was run by a chp pm and that there was a pro-islamist coup under way . 
  do you think the western forces would have stood by passively as the pro-islamist coup jets would have landed and taken off during the night ? 
  the irony underlying this entire clownshow is that g\u00fclen is even * more * of a fundamentalist than erdogan . 
  in his foreign policy he is seen as more pliant , however , which is all that matters . 
  the u.s. has already shown itself willing to support incredibly islamist/repressive regimes at home so long as they align with the foreign policy goals of the beltway establishment ( saudi arabia , pakistan after the increasing islamisation of the 1980s etc ) . 
   several of the aircraft used by coup forces during the failed uprising flew out of the incirlik air base , which then had its power supply cut off for several weeks is n't this a direct indictment of america as a co-conspirator of the plot ? 
  i mean , i guess it depends for how long this transpired . 
  you can excuse it during the early phases of the coup , by claiming the people at the base were ignorant . 
  but if this carried on throughout the night then it 's impossible to escape the conclusion of them being accomplices . 
  why ? 
  do n't be so sure . 
  sweden did not have a white vs nonwhite debate as recently as a few years ago . 
  now the identity politics left has fullscale imported the discourse from america . 
  kind of like blm in london even if there 's only been two deaths by police in the uk and both of them were white . 
  a better solution would be to ban pro-erdogan trolls like him and their turkish apologists , like you . 
   if a sharia court decrees a judgement that is contrary to uk law then uk law , to my knowledge , trumps that exactly , which is a sign of a secular society . 
  hence his uk example is bullshit . 
  can we swap folks like you for them ? 
  secular on paper but islamist in practice is what turkey is today . 
  the fact that the coup was fought between islamist lite and islamist hardline says everything that needs to be said about ` modern ' turkey . 
  and yes , life for religious minorities is far better in norway than in turkey . 
  butthurt turk is butthurt . 
   no religious courts unlike uk this is a silly talking point . 
  the uk uses common law and civil arbitration is acceptable where both parties agree to it . 
  you 're making it sound as if religion is built into the system , whereas its only used by consent for a small minority . 
   no official religion unlike norway which does n't mean anything . 
  life for religious minorities is far better in norway than it is in turkey . 
  because people sometimes live in places they do n't respect/like culturally for material benefits . 
  we just had a thread with pro-erdogan turks in germany staging a 30k rally . 
  it 's the same mentality . 
  where you 'd live is not necessarily about values as much as material standard . 
  by which you mean accepted ir theory ? 
  oh wait , let 's turn this into an ethnic joke instead . 
  what `` racist rallies '' are you referring to ? 
  it 'd be amusing if you can provide any specifics or are you just smearing hungary to make your own country ( and its diaspora ) look better ? 
   turkey is still a secular democracy heh, 
  it 's the current year , folks . 
  never forget . 
   and if it 's a sign of a booming economy , more like uncontrolled neoliberalism . 
  poland went full shock doctrine in the 90s and this was one of those consequences . 
  happily enough , as it has gotten richer , it has also gotten more confident in recognising that not * everything * they were told was right . 
  ( in fact a lot of it was n't ) . 
  this is just one example . 
  disagree . 
  many fossil-fuel dominated economies have not promoted environmentalism at home . 
  just look at saudi arabia and the gulf states . 
  norway 's economy is of course more diversified , but they could be lazy/complacement and live off their wealth and their massive pension fund . 
  yet they did n't , because they are smart folks who are leading the way on renewable energy and even more importantly , renewable transport . 
  i wish the eu would get its act together instead of constantly watering down these kinds of initiatives . 
  you do n't need * that * much money to start building out more renewable energy more aggressively . 
  the subsidies to evs can be compensated by the many subsidies which are given to fossil fuel interests across the eu . 
   you mention that 300,000 people came there last year , are you referring to total immigration or just refugees , because that graph indicates under 200,000 refugees total asylum applications were 163k . 
  the swedish police has estimated that an equal number of people came in illegally but never registered . 
  that 's slightly over 320k but i 'm cutting it down to 300k to be a bit more conservative . 
  also , please remember that family reunion migration is not counted in asylum claims . 
  so even if only 50 % get their applications accepted , you have to add 2 more people for every one of those people , minimum , for their family . 
  typically the spouse always gets the greenlight and at * least * one child . 
   why do you think they will be unable to deport 80,000 people , sweden has a small population , it should be relatively easier to locate and deport these people , no ? 
  sweden already has a large shadow population living illegally . 
  the police has tried to enforce these deportations but the media went beserk . 
  it 's a very hostile environment to be a law officer in . 
  so , my base case is that sweden maybe will deport 1/5th of those people . 
  the rest will likely stay one way or another . 
  remember , there 's an entire infrastructure built up around this shadow economy . 
  many big business people use them for construction work and similar stuff . 
  it will not be easy to shut down at this point , simply because of the scale . 
   do you live in sweden ? 
  yes . 
   our ability for self-deprecation this i agree with . 
  any society that does not have this is fundamentally unhealthy . 
   our utter lack of national pride this i ** do n't ** agree with . 
  it 's possible to like and be proud of your nation and still not descend into jingoism . 
  for instance , for americans to be proud of a man like norman borlaug instead of being proud of how many millions they killed in whatever war . 
  every country can find meaningful contributions to humanity , and belgium has [ a pretty good record on that , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_belgian_nobel_laureates ) on a per capita basis . 
  i 've noticed that in many swedish supermarkets they quite recently phased out old-style plastic bags altogether . 
  instead they only sell thin `` plastic '' bags which have significant amount of sugar or other biomass in them . 
  this was a change from just a year ago . 
  it was forced , and i do n't mind at all . 
  actually , thinking about it , it did seem to coincide with cop21 , which makes sense . 
  i 'd be willing to go even further . 
  even these ` environmental ' bags are a strain on the environment . 
  just sell normal bags made out of clothing and let people buy a single one and then reuse them . 
  the eu should be more aggressive on this . 
   i 'm okay with taking in large numbers of refugees ** if we actually make sure they are in fact fleeing from war and oppression ** this is the key point . 
  the ec estimated last year that 48 % of all those who applied were not genuine refugees but were economic migrants . 
  this should n't be a surprise . 
  paying the human smugglers is quite costly if you live in syria , mali , pakistan or afghanistan . 
  the most vulnerable are never those who can make the journey . 
  the most pernicious effect is that by so badly mishandling the situation , the general public will associate refugee migration with these large-scale waves where at least half are not genuine refugees . 
  that poisons the word ` refugee ' , and people become cynical . 
  genuine refugees in need of help get to bear the brunt of the backlash that they have not had a role in creating in the first place . 
  what we could end up with is that we swing from one extreme to another , from far too generous/open to extremely closed . 
  still , we might not have much choice since refugee distribution seems to be dead in the water and concentrating all who come into 4-5 countries is a recipe for social unrest .
