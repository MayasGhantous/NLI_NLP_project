  east asians do n't have our skin color and do n't have our religion ( except koreans ) . 
  yet it still works . 
  the same is even more true for hindu indians . 
  radically different skin color/looks , almost no christians in india . 
  yet it 's not an issue . 
  the point is that skin color matters a lot less than culture to integration . 
  i say that not as an `` ideal '' , i say that * as a matter of fact * . 
   that is not true at all . 
  the largest group of legal immigrants to the us are from asia and they integrate very well and very quickly . 
  you 're forgetting something . 
  we 're not talking about now , back in the past . 
  and historically , the waves of european immigration far surpasses any asian immigration by a landslide . 
  the reason why asian immigration even happens in the first place is because anglo-america managed to integrate the irish , jews , italians , germans , greeks , spanish , duth , poles etc. 
  if they did n't , there would be no asian immigration . 
  the us today would look like a bigger europe where an ethnicity would dominate each state . 
  colonised *, 
  people often forget why european states were so ethnically homogenous for so long . 
  well , it 's because we tried the multiculti approach before . 
  austro-hungarian empire , the polish-lithuanian commonwealth . 
  remember yugoslavia ? 
  nationalism exists because it is effective . 
  yeah it can be taken too far , but so can any ideology . 
  that 's not unique to nationalism . 
  but what gets me is how people try to present multiculti as this `` new solution '' when in reality it 's an old concept which has failed repeatedly . 
   civil wars are definitely something to expect in a 100 years that 's optimistic . 
  i give it 30 years max . 
  will happen in our lifetimes . 
  that 's the point . 
  the interests of the individual minority community is sometimes at odds with the interests of the nation . 
  this is often glossed over by people who think everything can be solved just if we get them to a certain level of economic development `` the social stuff will take care of itself '' . 
  it wo n't work like that . 
  also , integrating christian europeans into a white christian country ( which the usa overwhelminly was back then ) is far easier than taking people who are ultra-religious , who come from socially illiberal socities and expecting they will all just melt away their differences so long as they got a job . 
  and that 's basically the extent of the plan for europe 's current elites . 
  europe in 2025 is going to be much , much more nationalistic . 
   huge uncontrolled movement that already existed not so fast . 
  you 're peddling the propaganda that this is all inevitable , that germany was merely reacting to events etc. 
  ** that 's 100 % false ** . 
  the people are coming in waves because of so-called pull factors . 
  even * before * merkel massively loosened the standards upon which you could get asylum , germany had an increasingly soft stance on asylum . 
  these are the better-offs of their societies . 
  they are smart people who make calculated risks on where to go for asylum . 
  they know the rules better than you or i in many cases . 
  none of these refugees are going into rich arab countries , even if it is * far closer * , because they know they ca n't get asylum there . 
  so ** stop peddling lies ** and bs about `` uncontrolled movements '' . 
  they are coming because of magnets , because of `` pull factors '' . 
  european pols are trying to play stupid about this , by presenting this as `` inevitable '' and something `` we ca n't control '' . 
  and so are you . 
  still puzzles me why karl xii is celebrated as a hero not just by nationalists but even among broader segments of the population . 
  he was a massive failure who bankrupted the state and lost sweden 's semi-imperial standing in europe . 
  karl x was a much better king , modernised the entire country , the school system , the economy , the army . 
  introduced tons of democratic reforms . 
  but nobody remembers kings who are brilliant intellectuals , no , let 's remember the guy who shot a bunch of people and got shot in the process !, 
  much better . 
  brits , dont sell out the continent . 
  we just tried to invade you twice in the last two centuries ( napoleon , hitler ) . 
  you ca n't trust the rest of the anglo family of nations . 
  only thing they are good for is massively support you when you 're in war and having weird special relationships with the world 's superpower . 
  how can that compete with the french ? 
  or a german chancellor more in love with arab asylum seekers than she is with brits ? 
  you know the right choice . 
  reject the anglosphere . 
  can you upload it to dailymotion or another site which does n't require account to bypass age limit ? 
   what about west europeans that do n't want poles in their country ? 
  who ? 
  the british ? 
  that was always a ruse . 
  they are just bashing the east europeans because you ca n't attack non-eu immigration in the uk and survive politically ( raciss ! ) . 
  so let 's attack the easterners , as a ruse , meanwhile we cut what we always wanted to cut in reality : non-eu immigration ( which is precisely what has happened ) . 
  the media rhetoric is completely disconnected from reality . 
  i 'm surprised you did n't see through it . 
  how dare the poles not bend to german dictates about transforming themselves into a non-polish state ? 
  * how dare they * ? 
  they must be re-educated !, 
  listen to yourself , boy . 
  speaking of delusion , you say that svt is n't left-wing , yet 90 % of its journalists vote left according to kent asp ( media professor ) . 
  you say that having massively loosened asylum policies is `` not lowering standards '' . 
  basically everything that you say is the opposite of reality . 
  it 's not hard to see why you 're so preoccupied with reality and delusion , because you ca n't find it at all times . 
  you 're useful , though . 
  every opinion you have is bascially the mirror opposite of what is happening . 
  so there 's a usefulness to your idiocy . 
  that 's about the sole thing about your existance that matters . 
  you 're hiding from reality , that 's the only thing that is happening . 
  yeah , svt is totally politically neutral . 
  like the fact that 90 % of their journalists vote left-wing according to kent asp ( media professor who does extensive studies ) . 
  so in your view : 90 % left-wing = neutral . 
  how am i not surprised !, 
  you are completely disconnected from reality . 
  this is empty posturing by russia . 
  nevertheless , the scaremongering around russia/putin is absolutely off the charts in sweden . 
  no , sweden , you are not under threat of an invasion . 
  if there ever was a time to invade you , it was during the cold war . 
  secret agreements count a lot less than official policy . 
  just because the ` murican gubmint says something ( in private ) does n't mean they 'll act when the shit hits the fan . 
  and * precisely * because he is a politician , can he be counted on to change his tune according to how the wind changes . 
  cameron denounced ukip as a bunch of racists and lunatics - then proceeded to adopt large parts of their policy programme with breathless hypocrisy while maintaining a straight face . 
  ukip rose because of deep resentment with how the political class bungled questions like these : immigration , massive eu interference in uk 's national sovereignty etc. 
  it depends what concessions cameron will get from merkel but if he walks away with little to show for it - which is what i expect to happen - and the creation of an eu army + the massive asylum wave continues i would n't bet against the british to vote for exit in the eu . 
  corbyn actually voted against closer eu integration in 1975 and has said that he wo n't recommend voting staying in if cameron does n't get a lot of economic left-wing concessions . 
  which is extremely unlikely - which corbyn of course knows - which in turn leads me to think corbyn is a closet euroskeptic .
