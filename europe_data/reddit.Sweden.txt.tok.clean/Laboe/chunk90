  mediterranean peoples also include people in the levant and north africa , people often forget that . 
  and anyway , even if you only look at europe , people in southern italy are quite dark/brown anyway . 
  your point about the genetics is a misnomer . 
  no average white skinhead will know that . 
  they will look at a guy like that shooter and think to themselves , he 's a foreigner . 
  racism is just colorism in most instances . 
   i guess we should cut welfare and healthcare even more to push even more people over the border \\ #let ` stakebackcontrol, 
  wow , cs : go . 
  shocking !, 
  can we get a morally hysterical debate about the demoralising effect that violent video games have on our youth now ? 
  can someone tell me what the russian name means ? 
  the irony of him being pretty aryan-looking , too . 
  well , is he vegetarian ? 
  we all know that vegetarians are prone to being mass murderers , like hitler or mao . 
  i guess a '' / s '' should n't be needed here , but there are still shocking amount of people who believe those lies , so / s just in case . 
  hitler had an estimated iq of 140 . 
  he was anything but a moron , which is why he was so incredibly dangerous . 
  * evil * is the appropriate word here . 
   i doubt there ever would have been an israeli state without the holocaust not true . 
  by the 1930s , the jewish settler-colonialists already had a proto-state in the making . 
  they were many things , but they were not foolish or na\u00efve . 
  without the influx post-shoah , the creation would have taken a little longer , but the seeds were essentially already in place . 
   as a person living on former native american land , i 'm not going to sit here and lecture israelis on the existence of their state that 's a non-sensical argument . 
  you could use the same deflection strategy to shield apartheid south africa in the 80s from the american direction . 
  the difference between the american situation and the israeli one is that the displaced population of the former are a tiny fraction , whereas in the case of the latter , they are around 50 % of the greater israel ( which is what the current policies are * de facto * going toward ) . 
  they are one and the same . 
  the mythology of america must be put to rest . 
  canada does n't count because canada has a mostly-skilled immigration policy which is the ** exact opposite ** of what europe has . 
  as for america , the vast majority of its immigrants are either christians or buddhists/hindus . 
  their muslim immigrants are typically highly educated , urban middle-class types whereas ours are poorly educated and coming from a more culturally regressive background . 
  most of the low-skill migrants that the us gets are christian hispanics who are already coming from countries which are semi-westernised . 
  their culture is already very close to the american one , since the founders of their ( modern ) nations were european settlers . 
  if you do n't understand this fundamental difference , then you 'll never understand the reason for the difference . 
  i honestly do not understand why people think integration policy is a substitute for immigration policy . 
  tabula rasa is a myth . 
  i remember i got massive heat in the original thread for stating that some iranians believe in the so-called aryan theory and that him having breivik as his profile pic was a dead giveaway . 
  specifically targeting ( sunni ) foreigners . 
  shouting `` i 'm german '' and all the rest of it . 
  honestly , it was n't even close . 
  it had all the signs . 
  dunno why people were so adamant about denying it . 
  for those wanting to see the full ranking : https://www.tuc.org.uk/economic-issues/labour-market/uk-workers-experienced-sharpest-wage-fall-any-leading-economy-tuc, 
  it 's a world of difference between saying their socio-economic benefit is marginal and calling them ** poison ** , which is straight-up de-humanisation . 
  swedish isps are today not de jure obligated to be 100 % neutral , however they are * de facto * under the the current regime . 
  here 's a swedish resource : https://www.iis.se/lar-dig-mer/guider/sparrar-och-graddfiler/ the current status quo could change since the net neutrality consultation was passed last november . 
  further changes are expected in august as the final consultations are winded down . 
  https://www.pts.se/sv/bransch/internet/oppenhet-till-internet/ ( scroll down ) the proposed changes are not better than what we have now , they are solidifying the room to make further discrimination in traffic . 
  yeah this sub needs a cheering up . 
  too much apocalyptic doom and gloom lately . 
   in fact the new eu regulation that the `` save the internet '' opposes will force isps to guarantee minimum internet speed that 's not good enough . 
  there should be equal speeds to everything , without discrimination . 
  that 's how we have it in sweden right now and the new ( proposed ) eu regulation is a regression . 
   my parents could n't stop me no , but they knew you were doing stuff they did n't like . 
  therein lies the difference . 
  while there are cases where the parents were genuinely in the dark , i find it very questionable that this is true for all the times it is said . 
  i remember the father of the orlando shooter saying his son could n't have done this etc. 
  then it turns out the dad was a pro-taliban media promoter . 
  or the wife of the orlando shooter , who played innocent until she fled because she knew her cover was blown . 
  this is what makes it difficult to discern the innocent from the guilty , because * all * family members will always claim they did not know , only that there 's always a segment of them who are lying . 
  finding out who those are can be tricky . 
  believing all the statements at face value , like you do , is pretty daft though . 
   get them out of their family to resolve that underlying puberty issue yes , this is just a puberty issue . 
  okay , austria , you get a dispensation . 
  the statement holds true for * most * we nations though . 
   since google do n't even run a real development shop in the uk where are their main development centers in europe , if they have any ? 
  i see . 
  thank you for giving me some of your valuable time , nothing like learning from a local , 
   lithuania is today independent and free as it has not been in centuries i think this is an overlooked fact that many of us in western europe often struggle with . 
  sweden has not had a war for over 200 years and has been a nation for close to a thousand . 
  even those western european nations which have seen war , their borders have not changed * that * much ( france , uk , spain , etc ) when you look and compare to a country like lithuania over the last 200 years . 
  the relative tranquility they have achieved in the last 25 years is not to be taken for granted , which is why it is so very easy to dismiss their concerns from afar . 
  to rome itself , not the vatican . 
  the vatican itself has still not done this . 
  nice find , though . 
   but luckily we have already banned those just a week or two ago i saw a lot of them in prague , so i assume the ban did not take immediate effect ? 
  anyway , what was the official argument in favor of banning them ? 
   but screaming internally at a huge group of asian tourists to get out of my way does n't count , right ? 
  right ? 
  of course not   some people will walk on the red line when there 's no cars going though , so there you have it , there 's some slavic rebelliousness in us . 
  best of both worlds !, 
   there were a lot of germans living here as well , almost 3 million of them before ww2 . 
  yeah , although i did not notice so many germanic accents/languages on the streets . 
  for some reason i saw/heard tons of australians , americans and other anglos . 
  asians are in their own category . 
  another thing i noted is a very strong romantic attachment to medieval culture . 
  there was a suprisingly large selection of medieval bars/restaurants , which would never happen in stockholm unless you went to somekind of niche roleplaying hangout where you 'd drink mead or similar stuff . 
   ireland was lucky i 'm of the napoleon school when it comes to luck ; people who are frequently lucky tend to make their own luck . 
  you are modest , but ireland 's fortunes were not inevitable or even probable . 
  it is the result of the work ethic and the discipline of the irish people . 
   the irish also were able to see the national front in action in the uk long before they were subject to immigration . 
  they 'd see the uk football hooliganism on the news . 
  they even witnessed totally unprovoked destruction from english football fans in 1995 in their home city . 
  to me , irish unilateral liberalism has been the peaceful opportunity to `` one up '' the british on the global stage . 
  interesting . 
   the open mindedness came from questioning its own culture , from realising its own culture was a bit sick , a bit twisted , a bit dark and immigration only started when ireland had just grown up i 'm not sure if i 'd call irish culture sick , twisted or dark . 
  it comes across as very attractive to me . 
  then again , i 'm seeing the cosmopolitan ireland . 
  i was n't an adult in the 70s-90s , so i presume my viewpoint would be different if i had that longer arc of time available . 
  i agree with everything you just said . 
  well written .
