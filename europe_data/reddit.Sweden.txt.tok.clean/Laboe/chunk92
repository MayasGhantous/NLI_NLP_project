  given the small size of the vatican , a hundred would be sufficient , or even just a dozen . 
  pope francis should take the lead and take in the people he orders others to do . 
  nice attacker was in the country for 10-15 years . 
  he is welcome to tear them down at any moment . 
  i 'm serious . 
  if he is so against them , why not do it ? 
  his actions should match his words . 
  or change the vatican 's extreme immigration policies . 
  they could take a few refugees per year , for instance . 
  it 's a small nation , but it is n't * that * small that they ca n't take 100 refugees to house or so in total . 
  he 's a hypocrite . 
   poland seems like the catholic version of what erdogan dreams about . 
  this is incredibly idiotic statement written by someone who knows next to nothing about poland . 
  it is n't just terrorism . 
  it 's also views on women , of apostates , gays and many other issues . 
  it 's na\u00efve and foolish to think the only issue at bay here is about terrorism . 
   i do n't think that 's a dishonest comparison at all it is . 
  btw , it is n't just terrorism . 
  sam harris makes a good point about the `` concentric circles '' of radicalism . 
  namely , a very small number are willing to use violence * themselves * , but a much greater percentage are willing to tolerate it in the name of islam . 
  look at the pew polls on the amount of people agreeing with the statement that anyone who leaves islam should be punished by death . 
  it is huge across the muslim world . 
  yes , it 's lower in europe , but it is still much higher here than among christians , jews , hindus or buddhists etc. 
  give it a decade and that difference will disappear . 
  actually a decent mag . 
  he has moved the church in a more progressive way towards , if not accepting , then at least coming to terms with gay marriage . 
  he has also been skeptical of abortion extremism . 
  then there are his immigration rants , which are a whole other can of worms . 
  it 's kind of ironic when he blasts a wall on the u.s / mexico border but he himself lives in a state surrounded by a massive wall from all sides . 
  he 'll get what he wants . 
  the eu has caved every time there has been a showdown , i do n't see why that would change now . 
  oi , do n't steal [ our thunder ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unfzfe8f9ni ) . 
   a show of force wo n't deter them since they 're pretty much ok with dying then do less showing off and more killing , make their wish come true . 
  that 's not the relevant part . 
  the relevant part is this :  it is similar to the arabic words ` daes ' , ` one who crushes something underfoot ' and ` dahes ' , translated as ` one who sows discord ' . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/what-daesh-mean-isis-threatens-6841468 ) . 
  that 's the real reason they hate it . 
  which is why it sounds strange why someone would scream it if they committed terror , unless of course it is in affiliation to another terrorist outfit merely in opposition to isis . 
   wannabe terrorists all terrorists are wannabes until the act is done . 
  good news . 
  does anyone know how today 's luftwaffe stands ? 
  obviously russia 's airforce is better , but any ballpark estimate of what kind of fight it could potentially put up ? ^ 1 _____________________________________________________________ ^ 1 i 'm aware that germany is n't putting its entire airforce in estonia , i 'm just making a general inquiry in the state of things from those who follow military matters more closely than me . 
   good guy discount this should be a thing . 
   i do n't rememeber many terrorist attacks to happen 10 years ago true , but overall deaths from all causes have come down . 
  just look at the improvement in traffic deaths . 
  pollution alone prematurely kills ** 400,000 ** ^ 1 every year in europe . 
  it 's important to seperate the overall trend line - which is positive - from specific * areas * where there can be regressions . 
  terrorism is one such area where we have seen regressions , but it is also a headline grabber . 
  400,000 premature deaths from pollution per year is just a statistic to most people . 
  if that is cut down to 300,000 , we barely feel it , but 300 people die from terrorism and the world is literally coming to an end . ^ 2 __________________________________________________________ ^ 1 http://www.eea.europa.eu/media/newsreleases/many-europeans-still-exposed-to-air-pollution-2015/premature-deaths-attributable-to-air-pollution ^ 2 note : i 'm not doing whataboutism here . 
  terrorism is a significant problem and should be dealt with , harshly , but i * am * saying that we are really bad long-term thinkers . 
  it 's why climate change is such a big problem for us to solve , whereas terrorism is much more immediate and near-term , even if , in the grand scheme of things , it 's utterly irrelevant to our survival as a species . 
  this kind of cognitive bias also informs the excessive and irrational doom mongering i 've seen lately on this board . 
  ad hominem attacks without any substative criticism . 
  yeah , you * showed * him !, 
  adress his point without descending into personal insults or pipe down since you have no real arguments . 
  while i am someone who cares deeply about the environment , i am more optimistic than you . 
  i remember growing up hearing how the ozone layer was never going to get good again and it would doom us . 
  today we 're not singing that tune . 
  reforestation is a fact in large parts of the world . 
  overfishing is a problem still , but it has been real progress there too in many areas of the world . 
  people did n't think china would peak their coal emissions until the 2030s at the earliest even as late as 4 years ago , yet it peaked in 2013 , * much * faster than anyone else thought . 
  and have we forgotten the malthusian scares of the 1960s , how overpopulation combined with too much soil erosion would cause mass famine ? 
  then the green revolution happened . 
  now we 're on the cusp of a new one , with gmos . 
  i 'm not saying the world is a perfect place , but doom mongers should be a * little * humbled by their disastrous track record the last few centuries . 
  human beings are amazingly capable at solving problems in a very rapid fashion once we put our minds to it . 
  who says we ca n't find a way to invent a method to convert co ^ 2 in the air into some other material that we could use for an environmentally friendly way . 
  i realise the submission is slightly meta , but there 's been a lot of `` 2016 worst year '' , `` the world could be approaching wwiii '' type of commentary here recently . 
  this could serve as a reality check for some folks . 
  uhm , is it really impossible to do a free trade deal with services included ? 
  i know china and australia have been in talks over it . 
  the video makes it sound as if all free trade deals are only about goods . 
  while that is the dominant theme , it is n't theoretically impossible to include services and more and more countries are doing this . 
  i mean , the eu insists on free movement along with free movement of trade , but is n't that an artificial demand so to speak , in that it is a political requirement rather than economic one ? 
  since most of the uk 's services exports are high-productivity , the people they 'd want to come in are mostly highly educated anyway for the labour requirements in their exports sector , so total free movement does n't make much sense for them . 
  the problem with `` eu economies '' is that the term includes countries like greece , italy and portugal . 
  france is also doing quite badly . 
  eastern europe is growing faster because they are poorer . 
  if you compare the uk against its natural peer competitors , northern economies like the benelux , germany or the nordic countries , the uk is doing worse on just about every indicator . 
  it 'd be like comparing a rich us state like new hampshire with the whole of eu , when it should compare itself with a country like ireland or switzerland . 
  it never made sense to be compared to a large continent for the uk , it kind of reminds me of the indian media macro which i follow quite a bit . 
  they typically want to compare their economy to the uk economy on a ppp-adjusted total gdp basis , because that 's how india comes out best . 
  you never see a nominal gdp per capita comparison  countries are similar in that way . 
  pride before fall and all that . 
  does n't matter , the jobs still went to them . 
  almost a million visas for a country of 38 million is pretty significant . 
   this topic was removed twice previously i honestly think everyone , mod or not , is a bit tired of the constant barrage of bad news . 
  it 's a human reaction . 
  see the whole `` i wish you a boring week '' thread today . 
  it speaks to the same impulse . 
  people can only take this constant negativity for so long until they need a change . 
  i wo n't speak for mods on this , but i think that is how a lot of us feel right now . 
  we just need a * break * from this . 
  yeah , the last few weeks have been terrible . 
  what i want to say , however , is that we as a union are doomed if we think we can seal off the fate of our neighbours from ourselves and pretend like nothing is going on . 
  if germany suffers , then so does the rest of europe . 
  i hope people in poland remember that and do n't turn their back on the rest of the eu as it struggles with these problems , just as i hope western europe does n't turn its back on eastern europe ( esp baltics ) with regards to russian aggression and threats . 
   if you send them back , they 'll just sneak back in with the rest of the illegal migrants , over and over and over again with the greatest of respect , that 's because america 's border is a joke . 
  people focus too much on the wall ( or lack thereof ) .
