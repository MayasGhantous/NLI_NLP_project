  it 's not that shocking . 
  the same can be said about china 's transition from the madness of mao 's reign to the relative stability of the reform era . 
  there are many other examples . 
  countries can change very rapidly if there is the political will required . 
   work ethics , access to the health system could you expand on this ? 
  most of breivik 's victims were ethnic norwegians . 
  [ here 's the crime graph ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/number_of_crimes_reported_per_100%2c000_population_in_sweden%2c_1993-2013.svg ) for sweden . 
  the red line at the bottom is intentional homicide . 
  could we have done better ? 
  sure . 
  is the rhetoric on reddit congruent with reality of the last 20 years ? 
  munich police says : no indications of islamic terror https://twitter.com/sz_muenchen/status/756576315373916164, 
  actually the world has been getting better than ever . 
  the amount of people in absolute poverty has been dropping to record lows , the amount of people dying in wars is at all-time lows etc. 
  the media 's long-time `` if it bleeds , it leads '' mantra is getting to people . 
  but it is n't reality , because you never read about the good stuff that is happening in the background , incrementally accruing dividends for humanity . 
  except all indications we have is that this guy ( or group ) are ethnic germans . 
  and they could be inspired by breivik considering that it is exactly 5 years ago on this day he massmurdered people . 
  with attitudes like that , what a shock that yugoslavia descended into a bloodbath . 
  yeah , they do n't count because they are muslims . 
  take the aggregate of balkan states and compare it to an aggregate of the major western european nations . 
  you 'll find what i told you from the beginning : you 're * not * safer in the region as a whole . 
  if you want to cherry-pick only croatia then i can play that game too and only cherry-pick the country in western europe which has the lowest homicide rate as well . 
  you 'll lose in that instance too . 
  any fair comparison involves the * whole * region and in any such comparison , the balkans are less safe than western europe . 
  it 's not even that close . 
   i do n't know why this video does n't seem like a terrorist attack , there 's no evidence against that fair point . 
  that 's why i prefaced it with islamic , because so many wanted it to be a brown guy going kamikaze . 
  still , terrorism is often laced with a political aim and/or ideological color . 
  breivik certainly had his , so did the attackers in paris and bruessels . 
  by contrast , was columbine a terrorist attack ? 
  did they have any ideology ? 
  the unabomber was a terrorist , because he had a political aim . 
  so , the jury is still out whether this will be classified as terrorism or not depending upon what their motive is . 
  could be another breivik-type of terrorist . 
   chavs [ working-class hating ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jun/08/chavs-demonization-owen-jones-review ) liberal . 
   belgrade and sarajevo is a must you been there before ? 
  asking because it sounds like you speak from experience . 
  croatia has a homicide rate of 0.8 while sweden is at 0.9 . 
  not exactly a huge difference . 
  also , croatia is the most prosperous part of the balkans , did you forget what i wrote ? 
   life in the balkans , certainly the poorer parts for the vast majority of people in the balkans , life is ** not ** safer than in western europe . 
  knock yourself out and see if you think what i wrote is incorrect : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate, 
  someone mirror this before twitter takes it down : https://twitter.com/montymetzger/status/756540722510237697/video/1 does * not * seem like an islamic terrorist ( the far-right will weep ) , rather a planned rampage . 
  two points . 
  human smuggling chains often have many links , like all chains . 
  the balkan mafia take the `` last mile ( s ) '' responsibility . 
  the local policing will get those in their vincinity . 
  the calais police does not have jurisidiction in mali or afghanistan or nigeria . 
  if the police in those places was as effective as the french , then we 'd see a lot more arrests on location . 
  as i said , not the source , but complicit at the very end of the trip . 
  curious , how did you like it and were were you in the country , aside from the adriatic coast ? 
  top bants , scotbro , 
  doubt it . 
  terrorism brings with it a lot of headlines , but everyday murderers kills far more people . 
  life in the balkans , certainly the poorer parts , is far less safe for the average citizen than what life is in western europe . 
   it 's also well known that smugglers from balkans mafia are the main source of the massive illegal immigration and human traffic . 
  not true . 
  the most important smugglers are based outside the eu , that 's how they give a way into the continent to begin with . 
  the networks from places like pakistan , syria , mali and other nations are run and controlled by groups based in those nations . 
  the balkan mafia are merely the endpoint for the network , not the source . 
  they are complicit , yes , but not the main drivers . 
  what you said about guns is true , though . 
  every single one of them . 
  of course he is allowed to form his opinions . 
  but when his country has drained hundreds of billions of ** bailouts ** , which are non-productive unlike investment in infrastructure in ee , then you should be humble , is my humble suggestion ( pun unintended ) . 
  i do n't see that as an unreasonable demand . 
  to top it all off , he slurs them as a bunch of freeriders/leeches which is the most tiresome and oldest attack made on ee countries whenever they speak up . 
  the message could n't be clearer : the eu is * not * an equal club and you need to shut the fuck up and do what you 're told . 
  that approach wo n't fly much longer . 
  also , as a final word , i do want people to reflect for just one moment that 0.1 % of their nation 's gni is spent on development aid in the eu . 
  whenever you hear populist nonsense about billions , remember that the eu economy is in the many trillions and that the roi on those billions is many times repaid . 
  it 's not a static gift , western companies profit greatly from that development from increased trade and higher development . 
  plus we have n't even talked about the massive demographic loss that ee nations have suffered the last 20 years , which benefitted western european economies . 
  those costs dwarf any development aid * easily * . 
  it 's time to admit these people have more than a rightful say in the eu and end the baseless attacks , the slurs and the misleading bullshit that is only aimed at silencing them and delegitimising their voices by scapegoating them as leeches uninterested in the european project . 
  it 's a slur and it needs to be called out . 
  either we are a union of equals or we are not . 
  it 's that simple . 
   ireland is on top of the list of places i want to give my life , my devotion honest question : why not poland ? 
  is it only about the money ? 
  do you honestly think even 10 % will leave ? 
  may is n't dumb . 
  she knows keeping them in the uk is good for the economy . 
  if she had her way , the uk would even keep membership in the single market with some adjustments to free movement . 
  either way , i expect the vast majority of poles to stay . 
  at this stage , erdogan and putin must be trump 's biggest fanboys . 
  the only question is how many maga hats they have ordered . 
  do n't play stupid . 
  by overtly suggesting they are only in it for the money , you are directly sending the message that they do n't care about the eu in of itself - and who would want leeches to have a say ? 
  it 's a slur and you know it . 
  stand by your attack on them instead of trying to worm yourself out . 
   what has what you said got to do with anything i said ? 
  try this :  poor eu states are ** only in the eu for the free money ** which is fundamentally bullshit . 
  i already addressed this when i wrote :  for too long we 've considered the poorer states as basically people who do n't have a say . 
  if they believe another direction of the eu should be taken , we should listen to them , instead of dismissing them as beggars . 
  pay attention . 
  fair points . 
   this is also a reason why i do n't understand the ignorance of so many right wing parties at this moment for forbidding dual citizenship as they can use it to their benefit . 
  because they are stupid .
