  i am not angry at you for eating bad , but i 'll shame you if you do . 
  remember , if you are at a hospital waiting room when outside of the eu , people are laughing merrily . 
  if you are at a hospital waiting room when inside the eu , people are sickly and in pain . 
  [ when the winged hussars arrived !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pad2uteecqe ), 
  in sweden we had a sudden spy-novel story about false flag warfare . 
  put [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xayhnhhxn0a ) on and read ahead !, 
  * on the 22 of august an opinion piece was published in a swedish newspaper , aftonbladet , which stated that refugees and asylum seekers should get voting rights . 
  the author of the article was a man called tobias lagerfeldt , with a picture too . 
  the article has since been removed , but it can be found [ here ] ( http://archive.is/xrkx3 ) . 
  naturally the sentiment caused an outrage among anti-immigration movements and a series of snappy opinion pieces were published to counter-argument the idea that refugees should get voting rights . 
  * earlier this week it was revealed that tobias lagerfeldt is a made-up person , and the picture used belongs to [ alex semyonov ] ( https://ru.linkedin.com/in/alex-semyonov-21680229 ) a digital communication expert from russia . 
  the person who wrote the article is in reality a man of many names , among them egor putilov and most commonly alexander fridback . 
  alexander fridback is russian immigrant ( now swedish citizen ) journalist who is currently employed at the parliament for the sweden democrat party , a party which has won fame and popularity due to their anti eu and anti-immigration stances . 
  * while alexander/egor denies the accusations and claims he will sue the newspaper , the newspaper claim that their sources are strong . 
  people are wondering if alexander took the initiative on his own to do this ... or did he get instructed ? 
  was he paid to spread disinformation , undermining the opposition with weak arguments while pretending to represent them ? 
  are the other people who do this too ? 
  and if he did get instructed , was it the sweden democrats who instructed him ... or a foreign power who he still has loyalties too ? 
  get your tinfoil hats right here !, 
  [ they already did .

  they exist still today , although today they are quite peaceful and do n't deal in drugs anymore . 
  and a pretty good show , at least the first few seasons of boardwalk empire was gold !, 
  the freedom party wants to outlaw mosques and the koran . 
  satire writes itself these days . 
  i want pictures !, 
  russia technically legalized all the gay stuff during the first years of the soviet union , but stalin got rid of that soon after coming into power . 
   how on earth he 's still in politics ? 
  because he is incredibly popular with rank and file members of the party ? 
  damn . 
  that one might be even better !,

  but / u/quinlanjoe told me it would happen in [ 2017 at the latest !, 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4xcg5y/may_and_putin_to_improve_ties_between_uk_and/d6eepdc?context=3 ) was i lied to ?!, 
  what 's quite sad about the whole thing is that aida could 've been the success story that we so badly need right now in europe : a young girl who sat in a refugee shelter as a child in sweden who thanks to her own talents , merits and hard work manage to get a position as a minister . 
  as said by others before me , she was/is quite competent and it 's a damn shame . 
  normalise their relationship ? 
  is it time for operation unthinkable ? 
  let the tower be . 
  it can barely stand on its own as it is !, 
  no , that 's not what i meant . 
  i just mean that i am pissed , then i can hardly imagine how angry someone would be who actually has a spiritual connection to the cemetery . 
  not particularly religious , but i 'd still be pissed if someone camped in a cemetery where i lived . 
  amazing clean-up work though . 
  someone is jealous that they do n't have a whole album of sabaton-songs underlying how epic it was .

  shooting her face off . 
  but i do n't know . 
  just hypothetical non-threats over here !, 
  i do n't think `` conservative muslims '' will force their women to wear burkas from the very start . 
  you are pretty damn extreme if you think it 's viable to do that in a western country . 
  with that said , i think it 's a very small group of people that will be affected by this law , like ... not even 1 % of all muslims will be affected by it . 
  it 's not common-practice . 
  upvote for calling me a racist though , very nice . 
  that is true , definitely . 
  and who finds out if they keep them there or not ? 
  i mean in theory yes , but it is not likely that the woman is going to report it , and definitely not the man . 
  i doubt that will be the effect . 
  more likely , it 'll make the men who enforce this upon their women simply have their wives/daughters/sisters never leave the house , and then that will be that . 
  out of sight out of mind . 
  the baltic states are getting ready for the inevitable `` invite '' from russia . 
  username checks out !, 
  i salute you ana and i wish you best of luck . 
  one day in the future , there wo n't even need to be an article whether a minister is gay or not . 
  thank you for paving the way . 
  your family moved to canada to flee from the oppression of swedish feminism ? 
  i am starting to believe you are high off something . 
  whatever it is , i want it !, 
  i do n't recognize any sin other than explaining that their slogan is n't inherently racist or even aggressive . 
  like i said before , i do n't support the actions that their members have taken , in europe or in the us . 
  so i am not sure what else brought forth your ire , really . 
  just eat an ice cream tomorrow . 
  people explaining the english language make people vote for trump ? 
  in europe ? 
  o.o i knew trump voters were a bit off balance but this takes the cake !, 
  close down all english schools before the election in the us is lost !, 
   now everyone is forced to be working and are at the mercy of the government yep , if you are unemployed in sweden and do n't have a job , the government will literally come to your home with a gun , drag you out in the streets and shoot you unless you go and work at the glue factory . 
  it 's hard time in sweden , and it 's all because of those stupid women and their stupid feminist movements :(, 
  you seem very , very upset and angry . 
  i am not sure i can offer an absolute cure to your wroth , but once the sun is out tomorrow , consider heading down to your local town square and buying yourself a big ice cream . 
  as little as i would force all men to work , i would n't force all women to work . 
  i would however ask that if you want a good pension you should really consider working . 
  forcing everyone to work is a little bit too ... soviet union for my taste . 
   but then again , i 'm not american , what do i know ? 
  that it 's unhealthy to eat [ the bacanator ] ( http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4905/209921-baconator.jpg ) ? 
  you could read it as divisive , sure , and it stems from a very divisive issue . 
  the numbers of how many commit what crime i ca n't be sure off as i have not followed the movement very closely , but i do n't think their issue is with whether police-officers can shoot someone holding a gun pointed at them . 
  to me it seems like their issue lies with that police officers can shoot someone [ who is not holding a gun or may even have surrendered ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/police-shoot-autistic-mans-caretaker-as-he-lies-in-street/2016/07/21/8e044f4e-4f34-11e6-bf27-405106836f96_story.html ) and there will generally be no legal action taken against the police officer despite this . 
  the issue is n't whether these people were good or bad , the issue is if the law applies equally to every citizen . 
  do you want it to be legal for police officers to shoot people and then not be investigated themselves afterwards ? 
  then everything is fine in the us . 
  ( as a side note , i think the issue is more of a class than a race issue , even if there are racial issues in there as well . 
  i think a rich , well-dressed black person is much more unlikely to be gunned down by cops than a white , poor-looking person in shitty clothing ) thankfully , in my experience at least ( as a swede ) police officers here go through extensive investigation after using their firearms to make sure they did n't shoot without justification . 
  fair enough !, 
  for the third time , i do n't support the movement . 
  but since i understand the english language it means that i also understand what words generally mean .
