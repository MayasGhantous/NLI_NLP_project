  the members of the movement may act racist or not , but the slogan is not racist . 
  not sure what the american phenomena of race-riots and police brutality has to do with sweden , but i am sure you 'll figure out a way . 
  i do n't remember saying i supported blm or the like . 
  i explained why the slogan was n't racist . 
   ** a lot ** of women choose to be a housewife and that 's ok . mhm ... you are free to do whatever you will with your life , but there are few problems that will arise with this situation , especially if it becomes widespread . 
  let 's pretend , just for the case of this example , that 40 % of all women tomorrow , in any western european country , decided that they 'll become housewives . 
  it 's a high number i know , but bear with me . 
  let 's also assume that they become housewives because they want to stay home with their children ( which is the traditional idea at least ) . 
  now to the problems . 
  - one day , their children will have grown up , and suddenly you are a 45 year old woman with no employment history at all . 
  how do you figure you 'll go find a job in the market of today without having worked a single day for the last 18 years ? 
  - one day , these house-wives will become pensioners . 
  how much pension do you think they 'll have earned , having been house-wives ( unemployed ) for more than half of their adult , working life ? 
  they 'll have to rely on social services unless their husband has a strong pension enough to cover for both of them ... 
  which brings us to the next point . 
  - if their husband is still their husband that is . 
  we 're divorcing each other more than ever before in european history . 
  what the hell do you intend to do if you are 38 , worked for two years at mcdonalds in your youth and suddenly you are standing without a home ? 
  or what happens if your husband dies before you do ( which is statistically highly likely ) . 
  that 's right ... social services !, 
  more weight on the welfare system !, 
  - be completely reliant on your husbands good will and his inherent sense of justice to share money equally in between you ( although in reality you are dependent on asking him for money ) - set a pressure on men to get a high-paying job or gtfo . 
  you think the house-wife only has a negative impact on women ? 
  if a guy ca n't pay for house and home , then what kind of man is he really ? 
  - you 're also setting a precedent for women to 1 ) not bother with education , since you might as well be a home wife 2 ) not bother with getting a job , since you might as well live off your husband . 
  ------------------------------------ now , i would prefer a more extended maternity and paternity leave system in all european states , but if a woman does n't want to , i 'd like to underline that ** this is fine . 
  ** but it needs to be spelled out by society that if you go through with this , you 'll have to be prepared that one day , you might have to head over to your nearest social services center and ask them for cash , because if for some reason your husband ca n't supply , you are fucked . 
  and i do n't know if society in all honesty should just give hand-outs to people who does n't want to work , but that is another question entirely i guess . 
  so yeah , back to the example . 
  how well do you think the french or the british economy would handle if all these women one day needed all this economic support ? 
  what would the long-term consequences be if a large percent of our future 's leaders , scientists and bureaucrats were instead encouraged to not get an education or a job and instead stay home ? 
  do n't keep your parents in the roof . 
  that 's messed up kids . 
  no , it 's not . 
  saying `` black lives matter '' is equal to saying `` save the whale '' . 
  it does n't mean `` fuck seals '' just like `` save the rainforest '' does n't mean mean `` fuck the bia\u0142owie\u017ca forest '' . 
  it does on reddit !, 
  pretty sure the swimming pool owners would n't want to let you rent it !, 
  * false-flag operation fully successful !, 
  well done team !, 
  which is exactly why you need female soldiers . 
  to show the local women that women are n't helpless victims . 
  that they are n't an excluded part , destined for submission . 
  additionally , [ men also get raped in war . 
  ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/jul/17/the-rape-of-men ) so with that logic , men do n't belong in the front-line either . 
  i see a lot of people here arguing that a ban on female soldiers is good , because * generally * women are weaker than men . 
  while i do n't disagree with the statement , that they are * generally * weaker than men , i do n't see why this would exclude anyone who is not . 
  if a woman manages the same test as a man ( no special rules for either of them ) , then she should naturally be taken in like any other soldier . 
  i understand a legit fear of some sort of `` of all soldiers 50 % must be women '' , because unless they are more physically capable , then this would n't be an issue . 
  but i mean , come on !, 
  men are generally stronger ? 
  okay , black people are [ generally more fit ] ( http://atlantablackstar.com/2014/12/23/8-incredible-things-about-black-genetics-that-will-amaze-you/4/ ) than white people !, 
  no more white people in our armies ? 
  someone mentioned how all the best male sprinters would beat all the best female sprinters . 
  okay , all the best ** black ** sprinters would beat the best white sprinters . 
  sounds dumb as shit ? 
  that 's because the statement is dumb as shit . 
  take anyone in , white , black , woman , man , if they meet the pre-set requirements , which should be the same for every applicant . 
  my guess is that armies which adopt accepting women into their ranks will find that a majority are still men , sweden for instance have 13 % women in their defense ( 12 % as grunts , 5.5 % as officers/specialist officers and 38 % in civilian defense ) . 
  the requirements at application in the swedish defense are , to my knowledge , the same for men and women . 
   but we should not lower standards just to appear political correct and progressive . 
  i think literally not a single person has said that we should have different tests for men and women . 
  same tests , both sexes . 
  you pass , you 're in . 
  you do n't , you 're out . 
  no point in barring anything from anyone . 
  and if one of those women who match a strong fit male want to join the army , they should n't be allowed , despite being equally physically fit ? 
  strange logic . 
  it 's strange that sweden and israel both have female combat operatives and do n't read reports about how they are suffering from the prince harry syndrome ? 
  actually , i remember reading somewhere that israel has one of the most effective armies in the world ? 
   9/10 men will get through the training while only 1/10 women ( and that 's being generous to women ) . 
  source that 90 of all male applicants succeed military training while only 10 % female do . 
  please . 
  edit : a generous 10 % even , so i 'm expecting the source to say 5-7 % now . 
  yeah of course but unless you can grab those majority votes in a district , if you end up getting say ... 22 % in every district in england , you 'll still hold 0 % of the seats in parliament . 
  as a non-brit with a little insight in the uk politics i 'd say that this initially feels like a good thing . 
  it would allow labor to be labor and it would allow conservatives to be conservative and not just have both of them waddle towards the middle in order to win votes . 
  the problem is that the uk voting system is hilariously broken ( winner takes it all ) so anyone who 's `` the third '' party will have a hard time getting in power . 
  yes , that is quite click-baity . 
  but it seems like it was quite a lot going down still , almost 2000 police officers is no little squad they put up . 
  as a german ( assuming so from your flag ) could you tell me a little bit more indepth than the article does about what is going on and what a suspected outcome is of it all ? 
  edit : thanks for all the well-written answers !, 
  a swede abandon their booze on midsummer ? 
  fool of a took !, 
  i can only imagine the amount of overwhelming work you suddenly got into your hands . 
  keep it up !, 
  the welsh !, 
  who would 've thought that a populist said populist things that he could n't fulfill ? 
   then again gym class should n't be about competition but about building a healthy relationship to excercise . 
  and to each other as students . 
  and group dynamics . 
  and socializing . 
  and everything else you can learn together in group . 
  the closest i got to a gender split in swedish schools was when we got to choose if we wanted tr\u00e4sl\u00f6jd or sysl\u00f6jd ... 
   i mean you are swedish pm so do something about it . 
  like what ? 
  call the police and tell them to go arrest the head master ? 
  the pm of sweden does not have that authority . 
  or take a decision on the spot , without looking into what possible consequences may be ? 
   or is someone else ruling sweden ?
