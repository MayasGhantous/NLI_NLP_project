  the parliament ? 
  or the ministers responsible for integration or schools & education ? 
  ---------------------- i 've seen a lot of people howling at the pm for saying that it 's bad , but what else do you guys want him to do within hours of hearing of this happening ? 
  force a law-change ? 
  of what ? 
  they are already breaking the school law when they separate the male and female students . 
  get more investigators working on private school cases ? 
  that 'll take time . 
  or forbid private schools all together ? 
  that will anger a lot of big businesses in sweden , and voters who have children in those schools . 
  or just religious schools ? 
  that will anger the christian democrats , and their voters , and people with children in religious schools ... and leave the kids with a schooling broken mid semester . 
  ------------------ not saying he should n't do anything , as a swede i hope they fight tooth and claw over this . 
  it 's absolutely absurd that something like this should happen in sweden , or any european country . 
  but to demand of him to hear of something and then just throw out a plan in fifteen minutes is crazy . 
  call it what you will , the action is the same . 
  you are killing the ( theoretical ) baby , even if the baby did n't do anything wrong . 
  termination or murder , they mean the same thing . 
  is it still not a murder though ? 
  * if * you think that abortion is murder , then abortion for for an unwanted pregnancy is essentially a death penalty , aimed at the person who did nothing wrong . 
  what 's your stance on if say ... 
  the woman got raped ? 
  you 're still , technically , terminating a life , no matter why she got pregnant after all . 
  or so the religious argue from time to time . 
  that is absolutely correct . 
  some people will rob , rape and do all kinds of things even if there are laws . 
  the difference is that you do n't see large groups of people wandering down to city hall saying `` we should be allowed to rob , murder , '' etc. 
  and because we are , thankfully , living in democratic nations , that means our laws can be changed based upon the wishes of the people . 
   but the nonchalance that abortion is talked about rubs me the wrong way . 
  if you think the average abortion comes from ` nonchalance ' , i can only assume you are not a woman who has gone through one , nor do you have a friend or close family member who has had one . 
  people wanting an abortion will do them anyway , that 's a reality we need to accept in the discussion . 
  now , if they 'll do them either way , why not : 1 ) give proper sexual education and easy access to condoms , pills and what not . 
  2 ) make it legal to get a safe , clean abortion . 
  that way you wo n't get unserious practitioners .

  i ca n't read danish , but i would assume ... 1 : danish radio people have a freelancer who works in the area . 
  2 : danish radio happened to work with another thing in the area . 
  3 : a person who works for the danish radio has a contact among the people who got approach/relatives of the people who got approached . 
  seems you summarized my thoughts quite well too .

  a russian tv-team is claimed to have offered teenagers from rinkeby money to start a fight in front of their camera . 
  this is according to a report from the danish radio-channel radio24syv . 
  - they approached us and said that they wanted a little ` action ' . 
  they wanted to pay us 400 kronors , says the rinkey-citizen mohamed to the channel . 
  --------------------- a team from a russian tv-channel have allegedly visited the stockholm suburbs of rinkeby . 
  on the scene the team reportedly tried to bribe a group of people to start a fight in exchange for money . 
  this according to danish radio24syv . 
  two from each other independent sources confirm that the russian tv-team is to have said that they were ready to pay 400 kronors if the teenagers offered some ` action ' . 
  ` while we were talking to them the police approached us . 
  we did n't want to do anything of what they said , but when the police came to us the russian journalists said that we were the one who had offered them to start a fight for 400 kronors ' , says the rinkeyby citizen mohamed to the channel . 
  --------------- mohammed , who wants to remain anonymous , says he does not know what channel the russians came from , but some russian medias have reported from swedish suburbs recently , among them the tv-channel ntv . 
  in a coverage from ntv , where sweden democrat groupleader in the parliament mattias karlsson participates , the viewers are told that migration have ` gone too far ' . 
  the police officer peter springare and the right wing extreme organization ` soldiers of odin ' are portrayed as heroes in the coverage . 
  further on they also report that the american president donald trump is considered a hero by many swedes . 
  ------- the police in v\u00e4sterort have heard of the incident with the russians . 
  ` but we can not confirm what has actually happened ' , says mats eriksson , press responsible on the stockholm police , to aftonbladet . 
  rinkeby has lately been covered a lot in media . 
  first donald trump critizised the swedish refugee politics and cited a documentary of the stockholm suburbs . 
  shortly after riots broke out in rinkeby with burning cars and thrown stones against police officers . 
  the american freelancer tim pool was also in rinkeby , and drew up an image of the area as very unsafe . 
  ` masked men shouted after us , ' he said to svt news . 
  mats eriksson with the stockholm police says that tim pools image of rinkeby was heavily overblown . 
  ` he was quite provocative when he was there and wanted to create his image ' , says eriksson . 
  -------------- the russian expert jan leijonhielm , earlier chief of russia studies on the defence research facility foi , is not surprised . 
  he claims that media often brought forth similar reports during the soviet era . 
  ` you often got this image in the propaganda in the soviet union . 
  that is to say , everything is orderly at home , while at the same time it was disorderly and dangerous in the west . ', 
  ` sweden has earlier played a more positive role in russian media , but lately it is often trash talking and derisions . 
  often sweden is described as a russio-phobic , paranoid state , says jan leijonhielm . 
  ---------- mikael tofvesson , chief of the unit for the surrounding world and readiness in the agency for protection of society and readiness , msb , agrees . 
  ` we see a pattern where there is a negative narrative regarding sweden ' , he says . 
  tofvesson claims the report could get negative consequences . 
  ` partly maybe no one will want to come here , and partly it influences our foreign policies . 
  you dampen our freedom of action by questioning [ sweden ] ' , he says . 
  ------------- aftonbladet reaches mikhail vyshnikov , editor for ntv , to ask them questions about the coverage on rinkeby . 
  the editor does not want to discuss the contents of the coverage when it is clear which coverage it is about . 
  ` you have to get back to me tomorrow and i 'll give you the number to the publisher , and you can bring up all your complaints directly to him ' , vyshnikov says to aftonbladet .

  karelian bear dogs do n't fuck around ... 
  i saw a documentary on those . 
  if half of what they said was true , they seem pretty hardcore . 
  first day `` aaah , this is so nice and warm , i love it here ! '', 
  rest of their 10 day stay . 
  `` i will remain in-doors , in front of this fan , and cry . 
  a lot . '', 
  are you a troll , very young or just plain stupid ? 
  you want tanks and soldiers to deal with police duties because people threw stones ? 
  what do you suggest for events such as [ this one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_g20_toronto_summit_protests ) i wonder ? 
   who said they were civil ? 
   [ no one . 
  ] ( http://www.wikidiff.com/civilian/civil ), 
  even if that statement was true ( it is not ) then a stronger military would not help . 
  a democratic nation 's armed forces should never be used against civilians . 
  it is destined to end [ bad ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzlqoc-b0ys ) .
