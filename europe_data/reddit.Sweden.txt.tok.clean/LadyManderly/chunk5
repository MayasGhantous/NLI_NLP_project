  awh snap . 
  i am growing old and weak of mind . 
  probably the first time you 'll ever hear me say it , but snyggkille has the right of it . 
  my cousin was very physically fit when we had conscription , had studied at a ` uniform ' - gymnasium ( think late high-school/college ) and wanted to enlist ... and still had to reapply three times before he could get it . 
  i think the chance of the military calling someone up who really did not want to spend 9-12 months in military training in sweden is very , very small . 
  ** zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz **, 
  zzzzzzzzzz, 
  you begin to bore me , as you intentionally misinterpret what i write . 
  try convincing the 300 something people that upvoted the same comment . 
  that it is n't fear-mongering . 
   just because you do n't understand it i think i have made it abundantly clear i understand idioms and how to use them . 
  this was n't an idiom , this was fear-mongering . 
  and thankfully , [ more people than i recognize that . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5wfeq5/theresa_may_to_end_eu_citizens_rights_to_live_in/de9ow8w/ ), 
  alright , i will try and explain it as plainly as i could , but i am very near believing that i could write anything , and you would not care . 
  it is as if you do n't understand your own language , like there 's a barrier in between us . 
  anyway , here goes nothing . 
  an idiom is a great thing to use from time to time , even if they do n't ** literally ** mean what they suggest . 
  however , idioms are not okay when talking about when talking about figures , in politics or economy . 
  with your logic , what stops someone from saying ... `` the costs for staying in the eu is half of our nation 's budget ! '', 
  when the reality is just around a percent so ? 
  would that be okay because `` it 's just an idiom lol '' ? 
  no , because it 's bloody idiotic . 
  back to the drawing board , and time to realize that brexit is not the best thing since sliced bread . 
  i get it , it is a hot potato , and right now , may is putting all her eggs in one basket with the way she negotiates . 
  it makes one wonder whether or not she plays with a full deck however , as the negotiations are going far from smoothly . 
  still , i 'll wait with passing judgment until i hear it straight from the horse 's mouth , this was after all just a quote from some unnamed random person . 
  insults are easy , grasping communication is hard !, 
   we were talking among ourselves , we understand our own idioms . 
  if you do n't understand them , unfortunately that is your problem . 
  you were not the intended audience of the comment . 
  fixed your sentences for you . 
  languages are hard !, 
  i 'd say i understand the english language quite well . 
  i also understand fear mongering , and use of propaganda to push populist agendas . 
  if i say `` it costs us half of our yearly budget to be in the eu '' , i ca n't go back later and say `` well , of course i only meant two percent of it . '', 
  if i do , i am a spineless populist , who is trying to get cheap political messages across without caring whether i lie or not . 
  like boris johnson . 
  then do n't say half of romania . 
  say `` we suspect roughly 100 k will come here . '', 
  i mean , i know that populism is never meant to be literal but ... that would be roughly 23 million people . 
  so the thought is that the population of the uk would increase by roughly a quarter of its current population , over night , in case they do n't block it all . 
  wow . 
  i like that sweden and norway are two ladies gossiping about what all the others are getting up to . 
   we should join our efforts around the baltic sea and booth have a fat tuesday and a fat thursday . 
  a semla that is filled with a p\u0105czki . 
   tell everyone you 're getting jail time for insulting the crown and not for glorifying terrorism and asking people to kill eachother . 
  it 's literally in the headline though . 
   burundi : electroral process and pluralism -0.33 but ... but how ? 
  how do you into * negative * ? 
  my interest in history started from reading my elder brother 's asterix comics . 
  my jam detected . 
  ring the alarm !, 
  an austrian just agreed with the german who said something about the fault being with the jews !, 
  alright , so to clarify . 
  this proposition would make countries recognize the adoptions made in other eu countries . 
  so , let 's say , a same-sex couple in sweden adopts , and then moves to poland . 
  then the polish authorities ca n't legally harass them , as the child is recognized as theirs in the eu . 
  it does not force poland to accept same-sex adoptions in poland . 
  i can only assume you only read the headline , and not the article ? 
  splitter !, 
  any interesting stances on specific issues ? 
  as someone who has very little insight in german politics ... what kind of guy is schulz ? 
  moderate labor ? 
  left social democrat ? 
  experienced ? 
  new guy ? 
  4:18 actually , when europeans did it , they did it with the intent to economically , socially and politically establish themselves as a ruling class in order to gain resources or locations of strategic value . 
  when the europeans did it , it was backed by a strong , central state who sponsored the people moving with military material , to subdue local opponents . 
  you ca n't in one breath heckle people who compare the refugee crisis to the holocaust as something over the top , and then compare refugees/migrants with european colonialism . 
  you seem to be a close associate of him , knowing not only what he stands for but what his personality , indeed , very soul is like !, 
  oh i did n't say powerless , i said hard . 
  greece , by example , was far worse off ... and there at least are examples of very influential roman women , most notably fulvia . 
  either way , thank you for a very neat read :3, 
  i just figured in a world where freedom/influence is hard to come by as a woman , it would be of interest to try and come across as a man . 
  then again , much like the greeks , there was a bit more of a nudity culture , which would 've made that hard . 
  just to add to your roman dick-obsession ... one of the kings of italy , umberto the i , was known to have sported a roman , phallic-symbol-necklace , to provide luck and strength . 
  edit : also , i know that the coverage of it is probably extremely small considering the perceived importance of their gender but ... any sources on female-to-male crossdressing ? 
  syria is one of the safest places ever . 
  edit : judging from the comments i received on [ that ... ] ( http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/992/401/e37.png ), 
  [ yeah yeah ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bixm77tvd8 ), 
  oh yeah , definitely wo n't argue with you on those ones . 
  i just do n't think the american people , or many people , mind someone who grabs a lot of executive power if they `` use it for good '' . 
   ** in an atmosphere of world war ii hysteria ** , president roosevelt , ** encouraged by officials at all levels of the federal government ** , authorized the internment of tens of thousands of american citizens of japanese ancestry and resident aliens from japan . 
  i think that part sums it up pretty well . 
   he 's considered so great because of the new deal and for reviving the democratic party , and for fighting to include people of color and women into us society , among other things . 
  but yes , primarily the new deal . 
  i 'd say fdr was pretty socialist in some of his ideas , and he is regarded as one of the us 's [ greatest presidents ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/historical_rankings_of_presidents_of_the_united_states ) . 
  that ukraine/belarus/russian guy ... 
  i swear it 's the same guy . 
  i do not recall claiming they are a feminist utopia either . 
  strange . 
  here i thought the pkk were against gender mutilation ... 
  it was more aimed to the extremists in the region rather than the european populace . 
  apparently the internet is n't very good at interpreting messages ... 
   women should be grateful to be beaten and ya 'll wonder why kurdish women [ do this .

  if the turkey is not to your delight : step seven : blame the gulenists . 
  the law was dissolved in 1975 , but the `` prime time '' of activity was during the mid thirties to the mid fifties . 
  sami people and romani people were both targets , but not specifically targeted because of their ethnic group , but rather their social class .
