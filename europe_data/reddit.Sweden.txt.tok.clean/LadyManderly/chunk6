  the primary target was women from the lower classes , often on pretty loose grounds such as that they were of `` weak mental strength '' , `` promiscuous '' or `` unsavory '' , for example . 
  the idea was that by eradicating them from the genepool , our society would be free of these bad influences . 
  it was pretty fucked up . 
  some 27.000 people were sterilized against their will . 
  one method they used was to trick the woman that she was going to go to surgery for removing her appendicitis , and once she was under they simply sterilized her . 
  in total , around 60.000 people were sterilized . 
  that is very true !, 
  you have to go to the `` altright '' people to find people who are honest with their racism . 
  i think you misunderstood . 
  i did n't say it was you , as in the person you are szkwarek . 
  try re-reading my post as if it was meant to anyone in general and not you in particular . 
  no need to insult or be upset . 
  christmas is less than a week away . 
  smile and wish the best to your loved ones , 
   if that makes me the buzzword `` racist '' , i accept this word has changed meaning and is now a positive conotation of a sane person . 
  too bad it 's not up to you to define words , that 's up to people to write dictionaries . 
  if one of your big worries is that people of another skin color than your own live in the same country as you , then chances are pretty good that you are a racist . 
  in the traditional sense of the word . 
  not to say , we should n't discuss all aspects of migration , immigration , racial tensions , etc , but i 'm sure you understand that . 
   people were honest . 
  they were racist . 
  it 's okay to say that you do n't want unskilled laborers , it 's not okay to say that we do n't want blacks ... or as former american president truman himself said : * `` i think one man is as good as another so long as he 's honest and decent and not a nigger or a chinaman . 
  uncle will says that the lord made a white man of dust , a nigger from mud , then threw up what was left and it came down a chinaman . 
  he does hate chinese and japs . 
  so do i. 
  it is race prejudice i guess . 
  but i am strongly of the opinion that negroes ought to be in africa , yellow men in asia , and white men in europe and america . 
  '' * not honest . 
  just racist . 
  too late . 
  we have . 
  and now italy is pissed as fu -- ... 
  happy cakeday !, 
  have south tyrol as a gift !, 
   but the timing of the comments are very indelicate and some viewed it as legitimizing the attacks . 
  agreed . 
  what the f. . . ? 
  i 'm confused . 
  i said the state of sweden deserves recognition and an apology from the israel state . 
  when did i say that you personally were responsible ? 
  or any single individual in israel today ? 
  imagine if the german state and nation did nothing to remind their people of what happened and feel any shame for it ? 
  feeling shame for what they did during those terrible years has become a national sport in europe . 
  in sweden , we have a whole week focused on the holocaust only when we go in our equivalent of high school . 
  i do not hold the germans alive today accountable for what happened . 
  but i would be upset if they shut down all their museums and stopped teaching it in school , yes . 
   you swedes are the biggest hypocrites . 
  sweeping generalizations , the way to do internet discussions !, 
   besides , hopelessness does not justify terrorism or other such violence . 
  it does not , i agree . 
  it does ** explain ** though . 
  explaining why something happens is not agreeing to it . 
  hopeless people being given hope can be an extremely volatile power , see any terrorist movement , see germans after ww1 , etc. 
  but i said that . 
  there 's no public veneration of lucia ** in the way we do it ** . 
  france is no longer a western country ? 
  we had best call brussels and inform them of their new status in the european union !, 
   which directly opposed recognition of jewish also , no . 
  it was pro all abrahamic religions . 
  the jewish religion is part of that . 
  hostility against jews in general ... wow . 
  she voted the frikkin eu line and that makes her an antisemite o.o a line which said that all religions should have access to a holy site , not just the jewish people . 
  how antisemite of them !, 
  this is sort of the problem . 
  criticize the state of israel , and you are an antisemite . 
  either you agree nonstop with whatever the knesset calls for , or you hate jews . 
  there is no middle-ground , and it comes off quite clearly . 
  wallstr\u00f6ms biggest crime was to recognize palestine as a state . 
  that will haunt her , and everything she ever says will ** always ** be interpreted as if she was literally hitler . 
  the net is already overflowing with `` hilarious '' satire such as [ this ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/82/58/b6/8258b65ad85c5603cc683fca9c0e23ef.jpg ) . 
  no , she is not antisemite . 
  no , the socialdemocratic labour party is not antisemite . 
  they recognized the state of palestine , and recognized that abused and hopeless people turn to terrorism . 
  the latter which is more or less an universal truth , the former which should 've been done some fifty years ago . 
  you can put a dead person to trial , just to find out whether they are guilty or not . 
  one famous example of this is [ martin bormann ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/martin_bormann#tried_at_nuremberg_in_absentia ) . 
  it 's not about punishment , it 's about admitting to what happened . 
  nor do people who are in a [ old ] ( http://www.npr.org/2016/02/11/466376936/elderly-former-nazi-death-camps-guard-to-go-on-trial-in-germany ) end up immune to the crimes they committed in the past . 
  of course , you could put the organization behind it to trial instead , if you prefer something which is living and existing ... one show of good will would be to stop [ handing out medals named after the terror organization ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lehi_ ( group ) which murdered a un-official , for example . 
  imagine if , for example , the us would start handing out military decorations named ` the kkk ribbon ' or if northern ireland started handing out ` ulster defense ribbons ' . 
  but fuck it , i wo n't even ask for that . 
  it would be enough to say `` yes , we did it . 
  yes it was wrong . 
  [ we are sorry . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ypuz1wyens ) '', 
  no , back in the day it was pingstbrud . 
  today we have p\u00e5skk\u00e4rringar , yes , but they are another thing . 
  the quote about the paris attacks are intentionally misinterpreted to make an ` enemy ' seem worse than they are . 
  the quote about the paris attacks are intentionally misinterpreted to make an ` enemy ' seem worse than they are . 
  if it 's so easy to get over , how about a public apology , or maybe a trial ? 
  the quote about the paris attacks are intentionally misinterpreted to make an ` enemy ' seem worse than they are . 
  you read one article , a single article , written in an israeli newspaper and you presume not only that the foreign minister is ' a complete nutcase ' , but also that the whole country is now going towards ruin ? 
  wow . 
  just wow . 
  https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/15/guardian-view-sweden-foreign-policy-margot-wallstrom the whole conflict started with sweden recognizing palestine as a state . 
  the quote about the paris attacks are intentionally misinterpreted to make an ` enemy ' seem worse than they are . 
  i do n't read that as her blaming israel for the paris attacks at all . 
  she gives an example of where hopelessness leads to radicalization . 
  the people performing the paris attacks were n't even palestinian . 
  you are really looking for straws in that statement if you want it to seem as if she 's accusing israel for those attacks .
