  no , it 's almost completely nordic in the way we celebrate it . 
  from my understanding , there 's no public veneration of lucia in for example italy in the way we do it . 
  there she comes riding on a donkey and gives coal to bad kids and gifts to kind kids . 
  if you 're trying to have a sneak-peek when she delivers the gifts , she throws ashes in your eyes and blinds you . 
  she a thug in italy . 
  edit : to clarify . 
  it was peasant traditions and student feasts which were mixed with st : lucia in sweden , hence why it is so different . 
  this has to be one of the most one-sided articles i 've seen on the `` frontpage '' of / r/europe being critical of some of the state of israel 's policies = hostile . 
  saying that terrorism is born out of suffering = hostile . 
  saying that both sides need to respect international law and un treaties in a conflict = hostile . 
  is this the israel version of rt or what ? 
   it 's not like swedens opinions on the conflict matter or are particularly well informed . 
  when you say that swedes are n't well-informed , do you mean `` are n't aligned fully to support the state of israel '' or is there something else we do n't know ? 
  like [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/folke_bernadotte#assassination ) ? 
  because it 's based around a catholic saint . 
  the swedish church was against sweden celebrating it too all the way up until the seventies . 
  i made some posts about its history [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5i3xqi/swedish_saint_lucia/db5fnhf/?context=3 ), 
   haha sounds completely different from what is now , with choirs of seraphic girls dressed in white signing soothing songs . 
  yeah , there was a mocking title called `` lussebrud '' ( roughly translated lucia-bride ) which was ` bestowed ' upon women of ill reputation , like women who had mothered bastards etc , and was basically all the girls got . 
  we had midsummerbrides and easterbrides too . 
  we did n't . 
  the church wanted to ban it for many , many years ... and it was n't officially recognized as a celebration by the church until the 70 : s !, 
  the way we celebrate it today was `` invented '' and widespread in the 1920 : s , with upper class families having pretty girls dress up and sing . 
  previous to that , it was a student get together thing ( although also practiced sometime on the countryside ) , ever since the 17 : th century , and since women were n't allowed to be students ... well , all our lucia 's were male . 
  that has been a common tradition in most societies though , like peasant fairs and carnivals of medieval europe . 
  as you can imagine , these festivities back in the day could become quite wild , and as i said before , were not popular with the church . 
  lucia has a very long and interesting history , a truly european history . 
  your opinion on him seems extremely balanced and nuanced . 
  haha !, 
  how do you mean ? 
  i find them good at quipping insults at each other . 
  i find corbyn to be quite savage too . 
  then again , it is easy when you have [ two sassy black women ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65zyh6e6e04&amp;list=plmleccwytgofd4ajfgxjbjhu2bicor2im&amp;index=12 ) flanking you .

  eu behind it all ? '', 
  shit girlfriend , that is soooo haram !, 
  that moment when you realize that the nation names in game of thrones and avatar are all reasonable . 
  avoid eye-contact and speed up so that you move past them quickly . 
  hope you do n't encounter them in the store-queue , although if you do , pretend to be reading something on your cellphone . 
  i do n't care what party you support ; if you are in any way celebrating the murder of a person who was elected to be a representative of her people - you are an enemy by democracy , and by that definition , and enemy of the western world . 
  no better than isis .

  no birthdays , national days , holidays and stuff either ? 
  you jehovah 's witness or something ? 
  :p come on , at least celebrate nameday ... best reason to get a cake ever . 
   except the part where even that period had the old party leads distancing the party from the skinheads openly on television and how the members voted in a new leader in '95 with the express intent of getting rid of them . 
  is n't that literally what i said ? 
  `` so yeah , the party was an open neo-nazi party , trying to reconstruct itself into a `` patriotic/nationalistic '' party , and just recently re-framed themselves to a `` social conservative '' party . 
  allegedly , jimmie joined because he heard that they had started reconstructing themselves into a nationalistic party . '', 
   women get one day , do men get 364 ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_men's_day  from what i 've understood , and i could definitely be wrong , is that they are under the impression that teenagers and young women use abortion as a contraceptive . 
  yeah , they are . 
  it 's not overtly religious reasons which drives them to their stand-point . 
   very much disagree with this . 
  they went too easy on mona sahlin for everything she 's ever done , including the scandal with the bodyguard . 
  i 'd say they got played by mona . 
  she somehow managed to turn spending taxpayers money for private flights , hotels etc. 
  and make it seem like all she did was buy chocolate . 
  i agree they were way soft on her over that . 
   i 've missed this . 
  do you have any sources i could read ? 
  remember , https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/j%c3%a4rnr%c3%b6rsskandalen ? 
   they get a lot of shit because they are n't feminists and whatever [ ... ] that is really oversimplifying things . 
  they take a lot of shit because the party is littered with racists who get expelled on a weekly basis for shitting on jews , immigrants , refugees and muslims . 
  core members of the party leadership has people in it who compare homosexuality to pedophilia and bestiality . 
  that they also shit on women is just a bonus . 
  their women 's party has two things on their top agenda : first of all to remove the international women 's day ( which was also their first statement . 
  literally the first idea they put forward was that , could n't make this this up ) , the second is to reduce the availability of abortions in sweden . 
   but they 're not even half as evil as the media wants swedes to think . 
  media in sweden is actually quite soft on them . 
  when a swedish conservative party pr-guy gets caught on camera calling a minister of sweden a whore , he gets fired within hours and basically every top member of the party officially denounces him ** and ** is going to investigate the team working with him . 
  when a sweden democrat does the same thing , he stays in the party and gets a high paying job . 
  you are right in saying however that their policies not as far right wing as their fraternal parties in europe are , even if they gladly associate with them and hang out with them . 
  they recently changed their party tag to `` social conservative '' which i think is fair enough to call them . 
  they want a decently strong welfare state but they also do n't mind running the errands for big businesses . 
  [ literally the same year as \u00c5kesson joined . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vaouqwr_ha ) uniforms and the like on party meetings were forbidden one year ** after ** jimmie joined , in 1996 . 
  this happened because [ photos leaked ] ( http://gfx.aftonbladet-cdn.se/image/12480853/800/normal/c76044e920543/2an ) of a party meeting where they gathered and threw books and writings about the holocaust into a big pyre and later held speeches in front of a fucking swastika-flag . 
  so yeah , the party was an open neo-nazi party , trying to reconstruct itself into a `` patriotic/nationalistic '' party , and just recently re-framed themselves to a `` social conservative '' party . 
  allegedly , jimmie joined because he heard that they had started reconstructing themselves into a nationalistic party . 
  that said , their policies today are n't nazi-policies , although from time to time things from the past will bubble up , like when a member tried to propose that jews should n't be allowed to control swedish media earlier this fall ... and local members of their party will from time to time be caught with their pants down , using in particular social medias to spread false news as truth , in particular those with racist undertones or overtones . 
  game of thrones is such a good book though . 
  if you disagree , you are a gulenist . 
  yeah but she specifically mentioned the bonnier family as the issue . 
  well , she also said that women who are beaten by their husbands only have themselves to blame for not leaving him so ... 
  i do n't think she 'll say things of great substance . 
  roughly 26 % of media is owned by the bonnier-group , which is run by the bonnier family . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bonnier_family these are the people she was talking of . 
  she actually , but yes . 
  i do n't know how she was thinking with the whole swedish as an ethnicity . 
  on a extra side note , a member of parliament for the sweden democrats proposed a new law which made it illegal for any single `` ethnic group '' to own more than 5 % of the media , after ( wrongfully ) claiming that jews own at least 80 % of all swedish media . 
  so yeah , good times . 
  slight clarification needed for you who only read the headline : it 's a hotline set up for a single week as part of a campaign run by a union . 
  it 's not state sponsored , it 's not run by a university or a charity organization . 
  it 's a private union and their idea is to spotlight [ master suppression techniques . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/master_suppression_techniques ) naturally you do n't `` report '' the occurrence of ` mansplaining ' to anyone , rather you call and talk about it and get some advice . 
  no one is going to jot down in a note that `` on this work-place erik is doing mansplaining ! '',
