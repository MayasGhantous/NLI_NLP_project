  one of the biggest example of eu dysfunction and uselessness and none of the eurosceptic parties are talking about it . 
  one of the biggest arguments for `` taking back control '' if you ask me . 
  do you even know what the word practically means ? 
  it means that in practice they were the same disregarding their underlying motives and isis is exactly that , conquerors , robbers and settlers . 
  yeah , they target houses in the country side in smaller cities and communities where the police have less resources to be able to deal with them . 
  it 's so funny how people have gotten to glorify the vikings , they were practically what isis is today lol . 
  do n't forget the fact that they 're a tax haven as well . 
  a north american conservative in / r/europe , that explains why you have a -17 next to your name from me , lol . 
  you 're a parasite on the eu and one of the main reason why people detest it , you do n't contribute anything but furthering the goals of eurosceptics . 
  you 're a fucking tax haven . 
  most people would rather not have you inside the eu at all . 
  it 's so ... perfect . 
  religious schools should n't exist at all . 
  well [ the ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/devil's_tower_\\ ( gibraltar \\ ) ) wikipedia article put 's it right next to the rock and clearly south of the airport . 
  the current frontier is the illegal one , and though there 's no reference of any `` el molino '' available online there are for devil 's tower and it 's clearly located south of the airport . 
  the british position part in your wiki link even references that their position is basically `` it does n't matter what the treaty says since we own it now '', 
  but those fortifications were all located south of the airport , the airport and the contested area is located on flat ground that would not have contained any forts or fortification as it would be indefensible . 
  [ the forts at the current border were spanish ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fortifications_of_gibraltar ) , built after the they gave away gibraltar . 
  has n't britain been occupying spanish land illegally since the spanish civil war ? 
  where is the hypocrisy you 're mentioning ? 
  who says a law has to target everyone equally ? 
  if the purpose of the law was to target the ultras then it is within the power of the legislature to do just that . 
  no one is having any issues with muslim women in football matches , they 're not the ones fucking everything up why do they have to become collateral damage ? 
  our interior minister looks to be taking it rather humorously though , i ca n't wait to see how it develops . 
  edit : ~ ~ love the downvotes , who cares what a swede has to say when r/europe has another chance to circlejerk to news about sweden ? ~ ~ seem 's like i 've been resurrected from the dead . 
  how do nutjobs like you find your way to r/europe ? 
  i 'm curious . 
  i disagree . 
  well they 're under funding the nhs and the public keeps voting conservative so why is this news ? 
  if turks had the ability to spot a train wreck they would n't be in the situation they 're in . 
  whatever the circumstances of the succession would be spain would still hold a veto over catalonia 's entrance to the single market . 
  how do catalonians believe they will fair outside the single market ? 
  what does gun laws in slovenia matter at all if someone can just ignore them outside the country and walk in without the obstruction border controls ? 
  gun control is something that has to be solved on the european level for this exact reason . 
  and how are you going to ensure that every gun is going to be used in that exact scenario 100 % of the times ? 
  it 's easy to illustrate how one thing can be used one time 100 % effectively but unless you can ensure that 's the only way it 's going to be used then your argument is worth very little . 
  and how are you going to ensure that every gun is going to be used in that exact scenario 100 % of the times ? 
  it 's easy to illustrate how one thing can be used one time 100 % effectively but unless you can ensure that 's the only way it 's going to be used then your argument is worth very little . 
  your arbitrary and baseless distinction is nothing but your subjective opinion . 
  and your north american buddies upvoting you in a thread about guns in the middle of the night in europe does n't make it less so . 
  the point of laws are to dissuade , the punishment is to ensure that it can dissuade people from braking said law effectively . 
  * it is * meant to stop murder . 
  the main base of our navy and marines as well as the navy 's own training school and a tech college i would assume . 
  it 's not optimistic , any extension would have to be approved by every other member , this coupled with the fact that the eu has been adamant that the negotiation is only for the divorce and not a trade deal means it 's in the uk 's interest to stick to the 2 year target if it want 's to start trade negotiations as soon as possible . 
  they never wanted to hold one mid brexit negotiations . 
  the date they mentioned would have been after the negotiations had been concluded . 
  brexit has everything you 'd find in a greek tragedy i swear ... 
  how arrogant do you have to be to think your opinion is more relevant than a company that has as it 's specific purpose to enact the same kinds of laws as those being proposed ? 
  your opinion is n't worth anything because you know next to nothing about the subject compared to systembolaget . 
  no , that would have happened when he was being imprisoned by the catholic church for proving heliocentrism . 
  the uk is certainly going to demand something for that and so we lose something in the negotiating process . 
  they should have thought of this when article 50 was being written not now when it can cost us a lot . 
  forcing a country outside of the eu to comply with what we want ca n't come cheap . 
  the eu parliament should not pursue this empty idealism and accept that it 's our own fault for not having written a more comprehensive treaty . 
  that was probably the point . 
  i 'm just stating the truth no country can `` have their way '' and expect 27 other countries to accept it that 's not how the eu works . 
  pursuing ideals while everyone else is apathetic is so typically swedish . 
  thanks for keeping us company though . 
  ireland has the same right as the uk to trigger article 50 and leave if that is what they wish . 
  that is the same link i gave that they used as a reference when claiming the avarage per capita use in all the nordic countries combined . 
  they never cite a specific number for finland once in their commentary . 
  can you link the report you think they 're citing or are you just going to make up claims ? 
  [ this ] ( http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/160680/e96457.pdf ) one from 2012 is another one they cited but i still do n't see the report you claim in their commentary . 
  it 's one of if not the most appropriate authorities on the subject as swedish and finnish alcohol laws are nearly identical , and it so happens that systembolaget actually came to the same conclusions as finnish alko when they made their own commentary of the laws proposed . 
  an americans opinion on alcohol laws in the nordic * is * irrelevant though . 
  http://www.who.int/substance_abuse/publications/global_alcohol_report/en/ it 's from 2014 , how long are the decades where you 're from ? 
  their government let 's them ... it 's part of the consultation process for making new laws . 
  the finnish government like any democratic government consults the appropriate authorities on the subject they are legislating for . 
  they cite your laws where you 've legislated that the point of the alcohol laws is to `` prevent the societal , social and medicinal harmful effects of alcoholic substances '' then they cite [ this who report ] ( http://www.who.int/substance_abuse/publications/global_alcohol_report/msb_gsr_2014_2.pdf ) showing finnish drinking habits and compare them to other nordic countries then they are claiming that the proposed laws would be counter to your own aims with your alcohol laws . 
  why they are giving their opinion ? 
  because your government lets them , it 's part of the process of making new laws where different authorities on a subject sign in and give their opinion on their relevant field . 
  nothing in the report comes close to claiming the law is going to turn every finn into an alcoholic and absolutely no one is saying finns are binge-drinking baboons . 
  i do n't know what kind of misleading article they have linked but nothing you 've written is applicable to the actual report . 
  the report is under the companies name and both the chairman of the board and her signature as the ceo is there . 
  where are you finding her personal comments ? 
   according to them flat out untrue , they cite the laws where * you * have written down that the point of * your * alcohol laws are to `` prevent the societal , social and medicinal harmful effects of alcoholic substances '' * then * they cite [ this ] ( http://www.who.int/substance_abuse/publications/global_alcohol_report/msb_gsr_2014_2.pdf ) report where it does show that finland not only drinks more but also that more people binge drink more than other nordic countries . 
  * then * they go on to argue that the new proposed laws would be counter to the aims stipulated by * your * own laws . 
  you need a lot more proof of someone harboring imperialistic sentiment other than `` they have an opinion of us '' , everyone 's allowed an opinion now i do n't speak finnish so i ca n't read this but what has she said that made you think that she wants to control finnish laws or make them comply with swedish ? 
   mistakenly believes that the former colonial power could still dictate our legislation lol , where does this come from ? 
  do finnish people think swedes see themselves as `` former colonial overlords '' ? 
  those are n't global cities , their significance comes from their domestic importance not global . 
  ny , london , paris , hong kong and singapore are good examples of global cities . 
  the problem should have been stomped out a long time ago . 
  the eu is too dependent on goodwill and understanding to function . 
  what is it supposed to do when it 's confronted with these nationalist demagogues with veto power ? 
  was n't it the whole point of the eu to stop exactly the situation we have with poland and hungary ? 
  what do you know about swedish politics . 
  it 's well known here that the ruling politicians of sd were neo-nazis before they got into parliament and their controversies since as well as their insistence to keep the controversial politicians more than earns them that epithet . 
  too bad their senior politicians are literally nazis then , it sort of takes away from the trust one can give a politician to keep his word and act rationally . 
  you 're already getting free money for literally nothing in return , you 're already the winners here and you 're asking us to accept a much less effective ema just so you can keep sponging more from the eu ? 
  same in sweden but also less regular nationalism . 
  but were they complicit ? 
  https://www.nafta-sec-alena.org/home/dispute-settlement/overview-of-the-dispute-settlement-provisions#chapter11 and the uk was never required to follow anything they always had the option to leave . 
  0 % of malta and cyprus is inside europe and a majority of turks live closer to europe than cypriots does . 
  try telling car manufacturers that , nafta certainly acts like a single market in a lot of ways . 
  it was built for other conditions than flat, 
  i did n't know fyrom had fjords . 
  it 's arguable in a sense that yes you could argue for the sake of arguing but you 'd still be completely off the mark . 
  there is an unsure option right now and the people that choose that option matter just as much as those that picked yes or no when they cast their final vote . 
  you can read it because it 's ** swedish ** , and totally not german we stole , say it with me ** swedish ** .
