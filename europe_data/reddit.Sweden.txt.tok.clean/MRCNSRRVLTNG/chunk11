  it 's a sustained flow of immigrants into sweden , many of whom have not contributed much to society other than to become another face in your highly segregated yet , somehow sweden went from nothing to everything . 
   by the 1970s the economies of the rest of western europe , particularly that of west germany were prosperous and growing rapidly , while the swedish economy stagnated . 
  many economists blamed its large tax funded public sector . 
   highly segregated `` vulnerable areas '' which number a laughably high amount but that you wo n't address . 
  uhm , i 'm talking about them right now . 
  so is the police by releasing the reports . 
  what is laughable exactly ? 
  do you even know what the criminal deviance is in the area ? 
  you do n't have any idea what you 're talking about , obviously . 
  honest answer , first and foremost acknowledge that serbs did not go from 98 % to < 10 % through birth rates exclusively , which people seem to try to argue . 
  you 'd have to have some retarded birth rates to go from 50 % ~ in 1900 to 90 % ~ in 2000 . 
  there was extreme amounts of violence in the region , pushing the serbs upward . 
  that 's how you 've ended up with so many serbs in bosnia and croatia , because they migrated to austro-hungary and got to live there in exchange for joining the military frontier ( krajina ) which was basically a human wall protecting austro-hungary from the ottoman empire . 
  an example of this violence would be the reprisals in the 2004 uprising , where 50 ' 000 albanians participated . 
   it was the largest violent incident in the region since the kosovo war of 1998-99 . 
  according to reports by news sources in serbia , during the unrest , civilians were killed , thousands of serbs were forced to leave their homes , 935 serb houses , 10 public facilities ( schools , health care centers and post offices ) and 35 serbian orthodox church buildings were desecrated , damaged or destroyed , and six towns and nine villages were ethnically cleansed . 
   the events were also called the `` kristallnacht of kosovo '' and in serbia , the `` march pogrom '' . 
   more than 164,000 members of kosovo 's minorities had fled the province in the immediate aftermath of the war . 
  this is especially true in the case of serbs and romani . 
  the notion that `` serbs were trying to kill all albanians '' has always been extremely ironic to me when , by taking a simple look at the numbers , will show you who has been killing who . 
  [ kosovo ethnic demographics 1981 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/srb_-_kim_-_es_n_1981.gif/800px-srb_-_kim_-_es_n_1981.gif ) [ kosovo ethnic demographics 2011 boycotted by serbs in the north ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/kosovo_ethnic_map_2011_census.gif/800px-kosovo_ethnic_map_2011_census.gif ) the settlements are disappearing and serbs are only safe in the enclaves . 
  while the international forces did a shitty job defending the minorities , there would be no serbs , or romani left if they were n't there . 
  serbs did n't have the means of returning and still do n't , since you mentioned that . 
  during ottoman times albanians were treated far better because most of them converted to islam and they were far more loyal to the ottomans and an example of this would be the [ 1901 massacres of serbs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1901_massacres_of_serbs ) where the ottomans turned a blind eye and forced russia to intervene to stop the killings . 
  [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_ottoman_grand_viziers ) is also the list of grand viziers in the ottoman empire and ethnicity is included . 
  look at how many of them were albanian . 
  out of 9 serbian , only two were voluntary , 6 were with the ottomans because of blood tax ( devshirme ) which means they were kidnapped as boys to be brainwashed and join the janissaries , and the last one was a descendant of a janissary , so basically the same situation . 
  under the ottomans , serbs could n't return because they were systematically pushed upward through mass killings , ethnic cleansing . 
  up until 1912 , kosovo was still ottoman while serbia was independent from 1878 ( autonomous from 1830 ) and thus there was no way for serbs to return or live peacefully in the region in that period . 
  the violence was extreme at this point following the first serbian uprising in 1804 , where they gained independence for 9 years until reoccupied in 1813 . 
  the second serbian uprising started 1814 and ended 1817 with an agreement with the ottomans and serbia gradually became autonomous . 
  by 1830 serbia was fully autonomous and by 1878 serbia was officially independent because of the treaty of berlin . 
  this obviously spawned a lot of terror for the serbs remaining in ottoman-occupied kosovo . 
  during the 2nd world war , it was occupied by italians and put under albanian power . 
  the italians , even more so than the ottomans , did n't mind the albanians committing genocide against the serbs . 
  in fact , that 's what they wanted . 
   `` the kosovars are 850,000 albanians , strong of body , firm in spirit , and enthusiastic about the idea of a union with their homeland . 
  apparently , the serbians are terrified of them . 
  today one must ... chloroform the yugoslavians . 
  but later on one must adopt a politics of deep interest in kosovo . 
  ** this will help to keep alive in the balkans an irredentist problem which will polarize the attention of the albanians themselves and be a knife at the back of yugoslavia ... ** '' - galeazzo ciano , mussolini 's son-in-law , the italian minister of foreign affairs , speaking of albanian claims to kosovo as valuable to italy 's objectives . 
  it worked out just as they had planned it . 
   `` we should endeavor to ensure that the serb population of kosovo should be removed as soon as possible ... all indigenous serbs who have been living here for centuries should be termed colonialists and as such , via the albanian and italian governments , should be sent to concentration camps in albania . 
  serbian settlers should be killed . '', 
  - mustafa kruja , the then prime minister of albania , june 1942 . 
  after the 2nd world war , kosovo is liberated , but this time it 's under yugoslav control . 
  the yugoslav government did not allow serb refugees who had fled the region during ww2 to return to avoid strife , instead all of the houses , all possessions which the serbs left behind were taken over by albanians , just like when they 'd cleanse the serbs under ottoman rule . 
  any kind of uproar was quelled , talking about any ww2 crimes committed by people of yugoslavia could get you jailed or even worse . 
  there was outrage and people documenting the reality of serbs in kosovo , but all of that information was banned from the public . 
  while this documentary is not the best in my opinion , i 'm linking it for the sake of these clips : [ 3-4 ~ minutes . 
  200 houses to 5 houses , serbs ca n't live there but they ca n't sell their estates either as everyone else is moving away to escape the terror . 
  albanians are getting their land for extremely cheap since they have no choice , or if you 're unlucky , they just take it by force or destroy it . 
  ( 1982 ) ] ( https://youtu.be/z1dtoagd0pk?t=630 ) this was how milosevic gained support from the general public . 
  after the fall of yugoslavia , the state for serbs still has n't really changed . 
  while the '99 war was fucking retarded from the serbian government , it was counter-terrorism against a [ terrorist group according to more countries than just yugoslavia ( kla ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kosovo_liberation_army#status_as_a_terrorist_group ) with a shitty ass government , which is why it went so wrong , this together with the propaganda of nazi-like concentration camps and 100 ' 000 + dead albanians among other lies the western world was spreading ( rudolf scharping , minister of defense of germany at the time in this case ) sealed the deal . 
  now , serbs are in the exact same position , they ca n't go back because , 1 ) they fear for their lives and at the same time , 2 ) they ca n't go back because what is not destroyed is stolen . 
  [ watch these 3 ~ minutes on the topic ] ( https://youtu.be/z1dtoagd0pk?t=2453 ) last but not least to answer this question :  should they be ruled by serbs against their will ? 
  it 's not that simple . 
  there is `` self-determination '' but that does not mean you can just say `` i 'm independent '' and you 're done . 
  for someone to actually secede like that , it 'd require international recognition ( so far only 110 countries , russia had veto power ) and at the same time you need the country you 're seceding from to agree ... where 's that agreement from serbia ? 
  serbia was bombed into submission . 
  the bombing campaign was terrible and undoubtedly targeted civilians , with bombings of hospitals , bridges , trains , buses , civilian areas . 
  they also broke international law , but 1 ) starting the bombing without un approval , russia would veto it otherwise , 2 ) [ they used cluster bombs ] ( https://youtu.be/jrvnpyfdag8 ) to maximize devastation which is a war crime . 
  catalonia for example has a pretty big secessionist movement , which is why spain has not recognized kosovo 's independence for example , they do n't want people to just be able to up and leave like that , it would be chaotic for the integrity of countries . 
  what was the point of this huge post ? 
  to answer your questions regarding serbs living there , returning to live there ; they have n't been able to do this for the last 700 ~ years since the ottoman occupation started . 
  also to touch on the question of self-determination . 
  the response probably leaves a lot of questions unanswered , so be free to ask . 
  i do n't really want to spend all that much of my free time writing essays on reddit , 
  that 's an actual quote though , you can look up his speeches on youtube , there 's several of them . 
   unsustainable is what you keep calling it . 
  just like in the 90s with yugoslav migrants , there was a huge migrant scare and , sheesh , sweden is a hellhole now aint it . 
  no , what makes you think that ? 
   the refugee crisis which was prior to the bombing minimal , is now catastrophic - ron paul there 's a reason 600k ~ had to leave to start with . 
   0 points  posted a minute ago `` i do n't downvote you , stop lying ''  all you can say , it seems  what do you expect me to say ? 
  do you think i care about who you idolize ? 
   yeah but 117 years is a lot longer than 8 . 
  foul play was used to screw poland out of the east of their country . 
  foul play was used to take quite a lot of territory from mexico for the us . 
  that 's exactly why you fix it now so it does n't have to break out in fighting later on . 
  there is no way , in my opinion , kosovo can be anything but serbian . 
  the next time there 's war like in ww1 and ww2 , kosovo will be a huge bloodbath once again . 
   0 points  posted a minute ago `` i do n't downvote you , stop lying ''  i think the systematic persecution of serb civilians during wwii was abhorrent , and you wo n't find me praising those who did it or denying that it took place , unlike serbs do with mladic , karadzic and srebrenica . 
  so when are serbs going to regain territory in croatia , bosnia that was repopulated by bosniaks/croats after 1,5 + million serbs died in ww1 and ww2 ? 
  1,5 million serbs died in total , bosnia was under austria and the ndh and took part in the genocides . 
  end of story . 
  there 's a reason why the nazis created the handschar division , saying that you were loyal to them in ww1 . 
  i guess my comments just downvote themselves , alrighty . 
  i was looking for two that are the same , but could n't find 'em . 
  you 're free to look it up yourself . 
  60 ' 000-70 ' 000 ~ bosniaks and 20 ' 000 ~ serbs died in the whole country , it 's not going to change the entire demographics of the country . 
  you downvote me , i downvote you , just like you and your buddies were doing when you brigaded that thread the other day . 
  and no . 
  you edited `` radovan '' out of your reply ... sad . 
  i already know all of this , what 's the point ? 
  lol xd, 
  lmao +1, 
   there are now , so genocide deniers like him and you can put that argument to rest . 
  lulz, 
  well , obviously , typing his name into the search bar took me about two months .
