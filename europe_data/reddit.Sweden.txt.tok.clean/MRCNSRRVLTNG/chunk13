  i 'll let [ general mckenzie talk for me on this one ] ( https://youtu.be/iy1jzwpj9ec ) the bombing was n't even approved by the un . 
  it 's literally a crime . 
  and [ before ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_massacres_in_kosovo ) there is not a single recorded serb on albanian massacre in peacetime here , all albanian on serb . 
  [ for anyone who cares ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5u5yrl/today_serbia_celebrates_its_statehood_day/dds5h2e/?context=3 ) 76 --  81 ** ding ding ** record breaker you get called albanian over on / r/greece as well , no wonder . 
  look at the [ demographic history of kosovo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographic_history_of_kosovo ) . 
  albanians became the majority in early 20th century under ottomans . 
   it says in the constitution of republika srpska that it is exclusively for the serb people and that the only language is serbian . 
  what more ` self-determination ' do you need ? 
  you are free to point at the part of the constitution you are referring to . 
  self-determination as in independence , a state of their own . 
   kosovo is n't created on the mass graves of 40000 civilians . 
  how many serbs died in ww1 and ww2 ? 
  homework for you . 
  serbia was independent from 1804-1813 as a results of the first serbian uprising , then reoccupied . 
  the second serbian uprising in 1814 ended with an agreement in 1817 and the process of independence started once again and by 1830 serbia was autonomous . 
  in 1835 they had their own constitution which called them an independent state , a parliamentary principality . 
  1878 is the official year since it was then the treaty of berlin was signed . 
  then in 1913 they defeated the ottomans with the balkan league and liberated your sorry country . 
  i wish i could , but finding the numbers online is very hard it seems . 
  also , the vast majority of refugees returned with months . 
  exclusively for their ethnicity ? 
  in what way are bosniaks not welcome there ? 
  lol kosovo was autonomous , now most countries claim they 're independent . 
  rs could do the same , but the world would n't let them . 
  the average person is n't too educated about the subject . 
  looking at pre-ww1 and ww2 numbers will probably shock them : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographic_history_of_bosnia_and_herzegovina#1910, 
   you could argue that yugoslavia was the same like if sweden , denmark and norway became a country called nordgermania allies were victorious in ww1 , croatia , slovenia and bosnia were liberated from austria-hungary and incorporated into shs , in 1929 it became kingdom of yugoslavia and in 1941 the axis attacked . 
  people of all ethnicities came together to create the biggest resistance force in europe , which numbered up to 800k by the end of the war . 
  the leader of this resistance naturally took over since the royals abandoned yugo before ww2 . 
  as for the language :  the vienna literary agreement ( serbo-croatian latin : be\u010dki knji\u017eevni dogovor , cyrillic : \u0411\u0435\u0447\u043a\u0438 \u043a\u045a\u0438\u0436\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0438 \u0434\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440 ) was the result of a meeting held in march 1850 , when writers from croatia , serbia and one from slovenia met to discuss the extent to which their literatures could be conjoined and united , and to standardize the serbo-croatian language . 
  no one forced you to speak any language either , i really do n't know what you 're talking about . 
  [ republic of ok ] ( http://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/cache/e5/bd/e5bdbf44895df0074f236efd9d19ee67.png ), 
  kosovo in general , for a very long time , has had immunity against criticism because of the massive propaganda ( personal opinion ) . 
   and yes withholding information from the public is a coverup ... not really lol , why would organizers be forced to disclose this ? 
  they are not forced to , simply . 
  it 's just piqued peoples ' interests now that the ebil syrians are coming . 
  slovenia $ 71,700,000,000 external debt ( 78 % of gdp ) croatia : $ 62,387,000,000 external debt ( 78 % of gdp ) serbia : $ 32,600,000,000 external debt ( 80 % of gdp ) bosnia & herzegovina : # 9,051,000,000 external debt ( 48 % of gdp ) macedonia : $ 6,740,000,000 external debt ( 60 % of gdp ) montenegro : $ 1,200,000,000 external debt ( 24 % of gdp ), 
  the demographics switched with albanians becoming the majority around the beginning of the 20th century , after that the biggest problems were oppression and birth rates . 
  it was during the ottoman occupation where things got fucky , serbs being pushed upward and until the liberation and annexation to serbia from the ottomans in 1912 , [ all the massacres recorded were albanian on serb ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_massacres_in_kosovo#ottoman_period ) a great example of this would be [ the 1901 massacres of serbs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1901_massacres_of_serbs ) , where albanians used weapons they had kept from assisting the ottomans in the greek war of independence . 
  it got so bad that russia had to intervene as the ottomans were turning a blind eye . 
  after the liberation in 1912 , severe reprisals followed . 
  it also did n't help that the yugoslav government did not allow serbian refugees from the second world war to return to their homes in kosovo and their estates were taken over by albanians . 
  any kind of objections were quelled . 
  then we have the post-war persecution in '99 where romani and serbs were systematically removed , like [ the 2004 unrest ] ( https://youtu.be/-mcqxnj-vuu ) , also called the march pogroms and the kristallnacht of kosovo where 50 ' 000 albanians participated . 
  200 ' 000 ~ serbs , romani and other minorities fled the region almost immediately after the war had ended . 
   kosovo was n't majority serb for a lot longer than 8 years , so serbia basically only lost control of an area they ruled over . 
  [ it was around 1900 that demographics changed in favor of albanians , before that , the majority were serbs for a very long time ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographic_history_of_kosovo#1321.e2.80.9331 ) and foul play was used to make these demographic changes . 
   also , by accepting an independence movement in kosovo , it will spread to other independence movements which serbia might or might not have , as in `` why could they have independence and we ca n't ? '' . 
  the funny part about this is how serbs do n't have the same rights of self-determination . 
  30 % of bosnia 's population are serbs , most of whom would * love * to separate from bosnia . 
   the thing is , you do n't really lose your history . 
  sure , but historical buildings and monuments are very important and can be destroyed . 
  many of those destroyed had stood without problems for hundreds of years , from the 1300s , yet could not survive this . 
   [ in total , 155 serbian orthodox churches and monasteries were destroyed between 11 june 1999 and 19 march 2004 , after the end of the kosovo war and including the 2004 unrest in kosovo . 
  many of the churches and monasteries dated back to the 12th , 13th and 14th centuries . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/destroyed_serbian_heritage_in_kosovo ), 
  thanks for linking that , it 's a great documentary . 
  edit : alexandre del valle had a [ really interesting speech on french tv ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj-ka4qo0iu ) , the quality is shit though . 
  worth watching . 
   ( albania received 500k refugees in a single day ) you ca n't actually believe this yourself , right ? 
  last i checked , the total numbers of kosovo refugees abroad was 600k , most of whom went to macedonia . 
  it 's called an economic crisis . 
  yugoslavia had the 2nd fastest average growth in the world after japan for a * long * time . 
  not to mention all the albanians fleeing albania to live in yugoslavia . 
  yugoslavia at the time had like 30 usd billion in debts , which was like 20 % of its gdp . 
  luxembourg today : $ 3,472,282,000,000 external debt ( 3443 % of gdp ), 
  the seat of the serbian orthodox church was in pe\u0107 from when it was created in the 1300s until it was abolished by the turks in the 1700s . 
  pe\u0107 is in kosovo . 
  religion is a huge deal over there . 
  jesus christ , are you able to read the whole sentence ? 
  we are sthlm have had issues with sexual assault since the beginning , ** in 2000 ** , but organizers withheld the information to not harm the reputation of the event . 
  in 2000 there was no mass immigration , refugee crisis , boogeyman syrians . 
  also withholding information is n't the same thing as covering up either lol, 
  i clearly said that they had their own constitution where they proclaimed independence already in 1835 and talked about the last troops leaving in 1868 . 
  i said in my other comment that they were independent by 1830 . 
  you 're so fucking butt hurt because you were the most loyal to the ottomans . 
   in connection to the 2015 festival , sveriges radio reported that sexual harassment had occurred that year and that festival had been plagued by the same problems for several years . 
  according to dagens nyheter this had been a problem since the festival started in 2000 , but that the information was withheld due to concern for the reputation of the event . 
  that 's from the first link regarding the 2014 and 2015 events . 
  the only reason people like you care is so that people like you can cry about ebil migrants . 
  question : do you think it was covered up ? 
  answer : no , in my opinion we have not , if we 're talking about an active cover up . 
  we have not talked about it however , like many others also have n't . 
  another one :  varg gyllander , head of communications for stockholm police , admitted the force `` should have communicated '' details about the alleged sexual assaults . 
  `` i actually do not know why it did not happen , '' mr gyllander told radio sweden . 
  not a single one of your links prove any cover up , just that there was controversy after what happened in germany and that they had an investigation , which resulted in literally nothing . 
  again , you really ca n't be bothered doing actual reading . 
   1835  1868  1904  1913  1917 . ca n't figure out i was tired and they were mistakes definitely albanian, 
  i googled it and from what i found there sex-related crime but nothing about any cover up except accusations . 
  of course you did n't question it . 
  everyone already knows that immigrants are over represented , people are not retarded . 
  immigration will subside and it already has . 
  it 's called a refugee crisis for a reason . 
  sweden accepted 30 ' 000 asylum requests in 2016 , the vast majority from syria , afghanistan , iraq . 
  uk speaking ? 
  lol dont make me laugh, 
  except there 's no clearer picture because of ethnic data , there 's only additional costs and useless information the far right will jerk off to . 
  america sure did n't solve their problem of being the most violent western nation . 
   no data is useful if you choose to ignore it that 's for sure . 
  that does n't mean collecting it is useless per se .
