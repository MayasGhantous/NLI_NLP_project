  her wikipedia page does say her father worked in belgrade . 
  i 'll have you know it 's not just this sub , it 's a much bigger phenomenon . 
  example :  in late october 2012 , during a book signing in the prague bookstore pal\u00e1c knih luxor , albright was visited by a group of activists from the czech organization `` p\u0159\u00e1tel\u00e9 srb\u016f na kosovu '' . 
  she was filmed saying `` disgusting serbs , get out ! '', 
  to the czech group , which had brought war photos to the signing , some of which showed serbian victims of the kosovo war in 1999 . 
  the protesters were expelled from the event when police arrived . 
  two videos of the incident were later posted by the group on their youtube channel . 
  filmmaker emir kusturica expressed thanks to czech director v\u00e1clav dvo\u0159\u00e1k for organizing and participating in the demonstration . 
  together with other protesters , dvo\u0159\u00e1k also reported albright to the police , stating that she was spreading ethnic hatred and disrespect to the victims of the war . 
   albright 's involvement in the nato bombing of serbia was the main cause of the demonstration -- a sensitive topic which became even more controversial when it was revealed that her investment firm , albright capital management , was preparing to bid in the proposed privatization of kosovo 's state-owned telecom and postal company , post and telecom of kosovo . 
  in an article published by the new york-based magazine bloomberg businessweek , it was estimated that the deal could be as large as $ 600 million . 
  serbia opposed the sale , and intended to file a lawsuit to block it , alleging that the rights of former serbian employees were not respected . 
  they 've made 2 more threads since , one about scenes from kosovo and one about bosnia and herzegovina ( posted by the guy above you ) where he uses these pictures and 3 more he added . 
  also brigaded using bosnian discord :d, 
  - chronological order / u/crnaruka posted a `` pictures of republika srpska '' or something like that , which triggered a lot of voters/commenters . 
  bosnian discord ( / u/lectarian ) went on to make this thread and brigade it , in retaliation . 
  ** edit : since the brigaders are now claiming that im lying , [ here 's the proof i posted yesterday ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5u3dqn/scenes_from_kosovo/ddr25sb/ ) ** croatian guy , also in retaliation , went on to make another one , but ( iirc ) used the same 7 pictures as / u/crnaruka used but added 3 more then called it `` pictures from bosnia & herzegovina '' or something along those lines . 
  that 's sad . 
  why are you banning users from the discord ? 
  and why are you downvoting my comments ? 
  you shared the imgur album before it was even up on / r/europe  `` napravit cu beatufiul of kosovo '' = `` i will make beautiful pictures of kosovo , '' minutes before this is posted . 
  you 're the op of this post . 
  how comes ? 
  yeah , so sad . 
  how ? 
  who are we talking about right now ? 
  your comment confused me so much lol . 
  [ i did not mean to come off as offensive , sufijski svetac ] ( http://prntscr.com/e8u362 ) nice brigade though . 
  oh wow , i did not know this mosque even existed !, 
  apparently it was desecrated as retaliation to the 2004 unrest in kosovo ... retaliation is never the way to go . 
  : /  violent unrest in kosovo broke out on 17 march 2004 . 
  kosovo albanians , numbering over 50,000 , took part in wide-ranging attacks on the kosovo serb minority , compared by the then serbian prime minister vojislav ko\u0161tunica to ethnic cleansing . 
  it was the largest violent incident in the region since the kosovo war of 1998-99 . 
  according to reports by news sources in serbia , during the unrest , civilians were killed , thousands of serbs were forced to leave their homes , 935 serb houses , 10 public facilities ( schools , health care centers and post offices ) and 35 serbian orthodox church buildings were desecrated , damaged or destroyed , and six towns and nine villages were ethnically cleansed . 
   the events were also called the `` kristallnacht of kosovo '' and in serbia , the `` march pogrom '' . 
  i understood from the beginning . 
  why so hostile friendo ? 
  well , yes , history pertaining to the region of kosovo . 
  i meant that he was a serbian king and thus part of serbian history . 
  sorry for not being clear enough :d e : wow thats rude man, 
  do n't start , it 's not worth it . 
  just weather the storm and be nice , 
  e : five bosnian comments within seven minutes of posting , hmm xd e2 : nvm they used the bosnian discord server to brigade it , makes sense : http://prntscr.com/e8u362 e3 : aw y u kick me boys wow , i love the last one . 
  stefan de\u010danski ( named after the church ) , who built the church , is a notable person in serbian history . 
  beautiful . 
  it still remains a place of interest today , which is interesting :  the monastic treasure was exhibited in the rebuilt medieval refectory in 1987 . 
  the monastery 's monks sheltered refugees of all ethnicities during the kosovo war , which lasted from march 1998 to june 1999 . 
  on 7 may 1998 , the corpses of two elderly albanians were found 400 metres ( 1,300 ft ) from the monastery . 
  they were reportedly killed by the kosovo liberation army ( kla ) for allegedly collaborating with serb forces . 
  the kla staged an attack not far from the monastery on 8 may , killing one person and wounding four others . 
  that evening , de\u010dani 's 300 remaining serbs came to the monastery to seek shelter . 
   albanian civilians seeking refuge in the monastery returned to their homes following the withdrawal of serbian military from kosovo in june 1999 . 
  an italian unit of the kosovo force ( kfor ) was subsequently assigned to guard the monastery , which was attacked on several occasions . 
  dozens of romanis sought sanctuary in the monastery over the next several months , fearing retaliatory attacks by their albanian neighbours , who accused them of collaborating with the serbs and looting albanian homes . 
   joe biden , vice president of the united states on a tour of the visoki de\u010dani in 2009 during the violent unrest in kosovo on 17 march 2004 , kfor defended the monastery from an albanian mob trying to throw molotov cocktails at it . 
  several albanians were shot and wounded in the clash . 
  on 2 july 2004 , the monastery was declared a world heritage site by the united nations educational , scientific and cultural organization ( unesco ) . 
  unesco cited it as `` an irreplaceable treasure , a place where traditions of romanesque architecture meet artistic patterns of the byzantine world . '', 
  the monastery , along with all other serbian medieval monuments in kosovo , was added to the unesco list of endangered world heritage sites in 2006 . 
   suspected kosovo albanian insurgents hurled hand grenades at the monastery on 30 march 2007 , but caused little damage . 
  e : forgot this notable piece of history , picture 4 , on the left . 
  i have no idea what this even means . 
  so the icty does not fulfill its duties ? 
  do you prefer the sharia solution \u00e0 la izetbegovic ? 
   in his book , izetbegovi\u0107 praised pakistan as a model for bosnian society and declared that `` there can be no peace or co-existence between the islamic faith and non-islamic societies and political institutions '', 
  lol, 
  til the icty is not a thing . 
  yeah , 99 % upvotes and a few `` wow much love from croatia/bosnia/america / rest of the world '' and a few provocative comments directed toward serbs with 200 upvotes . 
  his name could be heil_hitler_1488 , how does that affect the post ? 
  why would you downvote the post for that reason ? 
  this post is 100 % legitimate . 
  this would elicit such a response in any case , which is the stupid part . 
  may as well name it `` pictures from earth , '' huh . 
  how is the 2nd one provocation ? 
  he should change `` serbian victims '' to yugoslavs . 
  you know they will make a magarac out of a komarac . 
  wow , are you implying [ herzegovina is independent ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bosnia_ ( region ) ? ), 
  holy shit have my downvote . 
  how typical of croats to claim herzegovina , so provocative . 
  stop propagating false statehood . 
  bosnia ** and herzegovina ** is a nice country . 
  that 's not it , and you know it 's not  no one would mind if he wrote `` silesia '' or `` sicily '' or `` slavonia . '', 
  this is a whole different thing . 
  just do n't even try . 
  there 's no point . 
  because even just writing `` republika srpska '' triggers about 20 % of this subreddit . 
  you know when nationalism surfaces your finger is all over that downvote button . 
  fuck that looks interesting, 
  serbian lies and propaganda ? 
  i argued with some people about operation storm that caused 250 ' 000 refugees and the ethics of it . 
  what lies and propaganda was i spreading again ? 
  is n't that kind of what you just did about 1,24 million / r/europe subs ? 
  comments = / = upvotes it has about the same % of upvotes as your post , says something about your overly dramatic post . 
   i also suspect it will be downvoted by plenty of serbs , but what can you do . 
  it gets downvoted because you 're overly dramatic and no one cares . 
  everyone who read the comments knows pretty much no one believed it was the insignia of any army . 
  lol op was croatian , you could simply go and check it yourself . 
  and the rest is just cringe . 
  that source does n't disprove what i said , quite contrary it supports my claim that croats were the majority after the fall of italy . 
  it literally says that due to the bozidar magovac joining forces w / the partisans and the fall of italy , croats made up the majority of partisans in croatia in * october * 1943 .
