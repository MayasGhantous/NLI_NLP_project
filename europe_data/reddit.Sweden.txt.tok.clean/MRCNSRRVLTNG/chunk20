  sweden has a higher `` totally agree '' percentage than the netherlands according to the other post . . ? 
  is n't this the `` tend to agree '' percentages ? 
   ow about the rape statistics though ? 
  if i remember correctly , during new year 's eve in germany , there were mass numbers of migrants who took part in some sort of ritual where they slowly surrounded the victim and raped women en masse ? 
  some women were groped , but there were no rapes . 
  it was no `` ritual '' , it was just a combination of very many people , some backward people and a lot of alcohol . 
  singapore is one of the safest countries , but traveling to germany or any european country really should be no problem , as it 's the safest continent in the world . 
  background story please , its all freeeeeench, 
  ahh , good old slovankia , the country that used to be a sovjet satellite st8 which nowadays borders checkia and australia and * hrwatska * . 
  i love your pivo ( beer ;d ) fests like oktomberfest and your crazy '' `` siestas '' '' ahha !, 
  i really like you and all , but you should give up kiev already , everyone knows its historical russian land btw milena trump is the best first lady ever ;p, 
   slovakian you just look dumber with every comment ... 
  i assume that 's a corpse underneath the rug thingy . 
  blood on the right aswell ? 
  us played a major role with their exports , not so much with their fighting . 
  they just sped up the process and made sure the soviets would n't have too much influence , which would be devastating for them . 
  i do n't see your point . 
  yugoslavia had some amazing partizans , but it was a small and poor country regardless . 
  the russians lost a majority of their adult males , you seriously think they would be in a position to conquer europe ( with whom they had co-operated and suffered massive losses alongside ) ? 
  the red scare is too real . 
   you 'd all be speaking german . 
  typical american retard . 
   the us also liberated western europe and let the soviets out . 
  xd let them out :p soviets were viewed very differently from today , because [ propaganda is one hell of a drug ] ( http://www.les-crises.fr/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/sondage-nation-contribue-defaite-nazis-1.jpg )  you might not like american hegemony today , but i 'm willing to bet most prefer it to being a soviet satellite . 
  soviet satellite ? 
  you realize there were countries who were assisted by the red army , like yugoslavia , which did not end up as satellite states , right ? 
  yugoslavia broke contact with stalin in 1948 . 
  i like how americans actually dismiss all their fuckups like iraq , vietnam etc , yet in situations like these pretend like if they would n't have intervened , the whole world would be speaking german/russian . 
  get over yourselves . 
  / r/cringeanarchy to you my friend one q tho , is your food spicier than trumps wall ? 
  pce, 
  go to mexico then ? 
  problem solved . 
  i really do n't get how this can somehow `` disgust '' people or make them this angry ... lol . 
  i do n't necessarily agree or disagree , but why are people getting so triggered ? 
  do n't mind this retard . 
  you 're disgusting lol, 
  lol, 
  i 'm pretty sure that 's subjective . 
  the humans would n't have to be detailed or look different last part was kewl tho e : apparently its this easy to trigger people , nice, 
  it just bothers me so much that the characters are rabbits ... 
  i ca n't really take it seriously , but i fucking loved the short film etc , i 'd just prefer more human beings . 
  gdp per capita, 
  op is n't russian . 
  does n't look that different to me because of color blindness i guess . 
  i thought it was referring to how it looks like the first square is white , like with the ustashe . 
  when you have no arguments and you 're 12 . 
  [ lel ] ( https://goodcountry.org/index/overall-rankings ), 
   croatia according to mainstream sources , not really . 
  the weaponry it used however was mostly smuggled , which matters when we 're discussing armies . 
   slovenia 10 day war ... if they wanted to continue it , they could , but they had no reason to do so with slovenia . 
  if you want to see that as a defeat , then sure . 
   bosnia bombing by the biggest army in the world is basically nothing . 
   kosovo self-explanatory . 
  just wait till they do in greece what they did in serbia and attempted doing in macedonia . 
  [ beautiful . 
   it 's not disputed territory except on the head of servian ultra nationalists that do n't have any qualms about shedding blood . 
  half of the world , 5 eu countries , the un . 
   dude every single country in balkan has lost parts of their territory.and none of that is going to be given back . 
  the sooner you accept this , the better for everyone that 's why they are n't ** asking ** for it . 
  they 're holding onto it , and when they get it back , you should follow your own advice and accept it , 
  do albanians get paid to spread propaganda 24/7 ? 
  lost every single war to foreign intervention . 
  you know you 're a retard when you get offended by normal facts . 
  talks shit , gets offended . 
  cute . 
   nah i 'm not hiding behind any flag , i have europes flag because my family represents europe . 
  it 's very simple . 
  why are you `` hiding '' behind your swedish flag ? 
  you seem to love any thread about internal serbian politics and threads regarding russia . 
  xd what threads regarding russia ? 
  what am i a kremlin shill now ? 
  xdd  you point out someone is commenting in every serb related thread , but fail to point out that there are way more serbs doing that in all threads regarding neighbouring countries . 
  nothing i 've noticed at all :p, 
   largely funded by the albanian diaspora in europe and the united states , [ 27 ] proceeds from narcotics trafficking donated by albanian drug lords nevertheless formed a significant portion of the kla 's income . 
  when the us state department listed the kla as a terrorist organization in 1998 , it noted its links to the heroin trade , [ 28 ] and a briefing paper for the us congress stated : `` we would be remiss to dismiss allegations that between 30 and 50 percent of the kla 's money comes from drugs . 
  '' [ 29 ] by 1999 , western intelligence agencies estimated that over $ 250m of narcotics money had found its way into kla coffers . 
  [ 30 ] after the nato bombing of 1999 , kla-linked heroin traffickers again began using kosovo as a major supply route ; in 2000 , an estimated 80 % of europe 's heroin supply was controlled by kosovar albanians . 
  [ 31 ] yep drugs sell, 
  obviously , but it 's still not a fair comparison . 
  ... you 're comparing ** wartime ** destruction of mosques , churches in bosnia , kosovo and croatia , to ** peacetime ** destruction of churches in kosovo . 
  there 's bound to be more desecration in wartime . 
  none of those regions have seen the same grade of desecration since the wars as is being exercised within the region of kosovo . 
  bosnian war and kosovo war were both wars . 
  did i say that ? 
  there 's naturally going to be more destruction during wartime than peacetime . 
  it 's an unfair comparison and you know it . 
  i see you in every serb-related thread aswell , hiding behind that eu flag , 
  lol, 
  because posting related content in serbian-related threads is `` propaganda '' . 
  how about talking about the article instead of going the typical off-topic propaganda route to undermine everything ? 
  do you have an obsession with serbia ? 
  i see you in every thread about serbia . 
   after the nato bombing of 1999 , kla-linked heroin traffickers again began using kosovo as a major supply route ; in 2000 , an estimated 80 % of europe 's heroin supply was controlled by kosovar albanians . 
  [ 31 ] tfw, 
   ww2 nazi collaborators be like, 
  comparing wartime with peacetime ... okidoki friendo, 
  stopped reading at `` albanian flag '' . 
  not worth my time . 
  you 're free to get educated on the subject .
