  slobodan * you 're welcome also nice meme hah xd, 
  a train full of medieval inscriptions from 700 years ago sure sounds like a nightmare !, 
  and serbs are the ones playing victims ? 
  lol, 
  you have difficulties with differing opinions ? 
  man , you paid for that last time . 
  others can play dirty too , 
  lmao, 
  i mean if you seriously ca n't see what 's wrong in circumcising a baby there has to be something wrong with you . 
  triggered, 
  they probably would though , at the moment at least . 
  absolutely full of shit lmao, 
  source ? 
  afaik it was basically a mass deportation sponsored by the west . 
  and retards gon na upvote ofc, 
  lol thats so sad actually, 
  the ones crying about `` heads on swords '' and all the other ones whining . 
  1 . no 2 . this thread, 
   kerdogistan, 
  no one cares about turkey except for now when we have to because you 're electing a madman . 
   you know quite well that we are n't offended that people fought against us in history . 
  really does n't seem like it here . 
  typical, 
  cry, 
  boohoo , my imperialism . 
  cry me a fucking river . 
  way to miss my point . 
  the swords and heads are referring to the ottoman empire and their fight against it , why are turks so offended by the fact people fought them off after they enslaved them for hundreds of years ? 
  there 's probably a lot of similar remnants from the time periods you mentioned which i could n't give a shit about because they obviously symbolize their resistance against the swedes . 
  turks need to stop mourning their empire that relied on the suffering on others , thanks . 
  post did n't get 100 % upvotes ? 
  wow now i 'm really offended, 
   turks ' heads on swords ? 
  who thought hundreds of years of occupation would result in `` offensive '' illustrations like that . 
  as if it is n't already with what 's going on in turkey and the fact that it 's a russian ambassador . 
  no idea what you 're trying to say , his question was who gets them mixed up and the balkans was my answer . 
  happens in the balkans quite a bit . 
  kex ( cracker ) is sometimes pronounced `` kex '' , sometimes `` sheks '' . 
   czechs . 
  they pronounce it `` sheks '' actually . 
  finland got attacked though lol , it 's not like they willingly went to battle with the ussr . 
  again , sweden probably made the right choice . 
  easier said than done . 
  monkey mentality to think fighting has to be the best choice . 
  not sure if sarcastic , but my point is that sweden was so powerless that the [ germans would have access to whichever swedish resources they wanted , by the use force or without it . 
  ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/fe/5b/d6/fe5bd60af9296339b79757a09fad6821.jpg ) the way sweden played it out made it possible to defend the targeted populace within the country . 
  in case you did n't know , norwegian and danish jews were fleeing occupation and coming to sweden , so sweden had a fair bit of jews within the country . 
  yes , because discontinuing trade sure would have made things better , especially for the jews taking refuge in sweden , 
   wait , so infibulation is circumcision but subincision is not . 
  do you know what circumcision means ? 
  it means to cut around ; the world only applies technically to one procedure ; the destruction of the male prepuce and frenulum . 
  `` female '' circumcision , is not only a misnomer the word itself has no precise clinical meaning aside form one . 
  now that 's just straight up untrue lol sad  this objection is one of the most ridiculous i 've ever heard , not only for being outright wrong but because of . 
  it 's desperate attempts to move the goalposts . 
  i 've provided you with all the arguments but you 're obviously just being a retarded contrarian . 
  who and most governments do n't have anything on / u/eryemil . 
  grow up, 
   subincision is a form of mgm . 
   infibulation is a form of fgm . 
   we 're comparing all types of male genital mutilation against all kinds of female genital mutilation ; not just the ones that are convenient for your argument . 
  last time i checked this post is about circumcision and the comment we 're responding to is about the legal status of circumcision in males and females  subincision does not count as circumcision , while the different types of fgm do . 
   if we were n't , we 'd have to compare the destruction of the prepuce and frenulum against the destruction of the clitoral hood . 
  that would n't serve your argument either . 
  again , wrong , you 're talking so much shit because you 're willfully ignorant . 
  do you have any statistics that show how common the fgm types are ? 
  no , you have n't provided a single one . 
  the who says 10 % of circumcised women have gone through stage 3 aka infibulation and the other 90 % have gone through stage 1 or stage 2 , which are defined as partial or total removal of the clitoris for stage 1 and for stage 2 , it 's the same thing as infibulation sans the sewing . 
  they also clearly state that the removal of the clitoral hood only is a very ** uncommon practice ** since you 're being an annoying contrarian moron and love ignoring facts , i 've decided to paste the definitions below . 
  * type 1 : often referred to as clitoridectomy , this is the partial or total removal of the clitoris ( a small , sensitive and erectile part of the female genitals ) , ** and in very rare cases , only the prepuce ** ( the fold of skin surrounding the clitoris ) . 
  * type 2 : often referred to as excision , this is the partial or total removal of the clitoris and the labia minora ( the inner folds of the vulva ) , with or without excision of the labia majora ( the outer folds of skin of the vulva ) . 
  * type 3 : often referred to as infibulation , this is the narrowing of the vaginal opening through the creation of a covering seal . 
  the seal is formed by cutting and repositioning the labia minora , or labia majora , sometimes through stitching , with or without removal of the clitoris ( clitoridectomy ) . 
  i hope you 're kidding . 
  moroccans = salafists amirite xd, 
   what 's your point here , exactly ? 
  infibulation is a type of genital mutilation ; so is pricking the clitoris with a needle to draw a drop of blood . 
  obviously not , there are different types of fgm and infibulation is one of them . 
   the argument at hand is about your claim that fgm is somehow `` worse and different '' than mgm . 
  cutting off someone 's glans or even more of the penis does not count as mgm , while higher stages of fgm like infibulation do count as fgm , so yes , it 's worse . 
   so far you 've failed to form a coherent argument as to why fgm is worse . 
  not really , you 're just ignoring everything i 've saying and pretending that fgm is not an umbrella term comprised of more plentiful and dangerous procedures than mgm , which is very defined . 
   if you cite infibulation , i can just say `` subincision '' . 
  if you say , well , subincision is rare , all i have to say is that so is fgm as a whole , compared to mgm . 
  you 've got no grounds . 
  subincision = / = circumcision infibulation = circumcision murder is less more common than robbery . 
  how does it matter ? 
   `` does exist '' does not equal it being the most prevalent form . 
  less invasive procedures are also practised in countries where infibulation is the norm -- they 're just less common . 
  let me quote you :  so , they do n't practise fgm at all in indonesia then ? 
  you implied infibulation does not happen in indonesia , 
  there 's 8 million women who have gone through infibulation ( 10 % of circumsized women ) worldwide , which is problematic since it 's counted as a fgm type , meaning as long as fgm is not outlawed , infibulation most likely wo n't be either . 
  type 1 and type 2 fgm make up 90 % of cases and type 2 is essentially type 3 ( infibulation ) sans the sewing part . 
   female genital mutilation type i and iv is prevalent in indonesia . 
  judging by wiki , infibulation ** does ** exist in indonesia . 
   procedures differ according to the country or ethnic group . 
  they include removal of the clitoral hood and clitoral glans ; removal of the inner labia ; and removal of the inner and outer labia and closure of the vulva . 
  in this last procedure ( known as infibulation ) , a small hole is left for the passage of urine and menstrual fluid ; the vagina is opened for intercourse and opened further for childbirth . 
  because typically males have their foreskins cut off , while females have a lot bigger procedures , cutting all of the clitoris , the outer parts ( equivalent of male 's glans ) and then they sew their vaginas shut with a tiny hole for pissing/menstruation . 
  if someone discovers the stitches have been torn/opened it 's a sign of premarital sex and they very often get killed in the name of honor . 
  yes they are .
