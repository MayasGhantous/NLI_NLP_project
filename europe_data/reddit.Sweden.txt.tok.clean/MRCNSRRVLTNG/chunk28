  pretty sure that was just a deus vult meme, 
   genex tower ( serbian : \u041a\u0443\u043b\u0430 \u0413\u0435\u043d\u0435\u043a\u0441 , kula geneks ; \u0417\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0434\u043d\u0430 \u041a\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u0411\u0435\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0430 , zapadna kapija beograda ) , is a 35-storey skyscraper in belgrade , serbia , which was designed in 1977 by mihajlo mitrovi\u0107 ( fr ) in the brutalist style . 
  it is formed by two towers connected with a two-storey bridge and revolving restaurant at the top . 
  it is 115 metres tall ( with restaurant 135 -- 140 metres ) and is the second-tallest high-rise in belgrade after u\u0161\u0107e tower . 
  the building is designed to resemble a high-rise gate greeting people arriving in the city from the west ( the road from belgrade nikola tesla airport to the city centre leads this way ) . 
   one of the towers was occupied by the genex group . 
  the tower got its popular name `` genex '' after this group , while its official title remains western city gate . 
  the second , taller tower , is residential . 
  [ the * actual * tallest building is n't much better at all ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/u%c5%a1%c4%87e.jpg/1280px-u%c5%a1%c4%87e.jpg ), 
  every time i see hungarian i think i 'm having a stroke . 
  how is it even effective ? 
  seems so full of unnecessary letters and diacritics . 
  lol, 
  it 's not , clearly , considering albania is red . 
  you forgot to go to history class , apparently . 
  eastern bloc is what i meant . 
  serbia , macedonia , bosnia , montenegro , bosnia , turkey were not part of the eastern bloc and it 's illegal there as well . 
  czechia , hungary and estonia were , yet they recognize it . 
  do n't try too hard to link everything to russia . 
  yes , because clearly not having it legalized must have something to do with russia . 
   in many ways traditional europe is far more conservative than conservative america . 
  please do tell me in what ways . 
  not to mention that this `` diversity '' stems to a massive degree from the fact that you imported massive amounts of slaves and colonized already inhabited lands causing involuntary diversity . 
  sounds like liberal policies to me xd, 
  is there no better picture ? 
  there 's a tree blocking my view xd, 
  that was a very pretty synagogue , rip : /, 
  i am a serb , i just doubt many serbs will have anecdotes from the early to mid 20th century . 
   it 's not about legality of guns but guns traditions were the factor . 
  well , legality is what you used as reference for poland . 
  as i mentioned , the kingdom of yugoslavia was not a bastion of liberty either and i would assume they had gun control for the exact same reason : rebellion . 
  the will was definitely there , just look at what happened in croatia during the war . 
  i 'll try looking for sources on arms in yugoslavia pre-ww2 later since i 'm currently at work . 
  i know that albanian partisans liberated albania , but did n't they receive massive assistance in form of deserting italians etc ? 
  iirc there was like 100 ' 000 italian deserters fighting against the axis following italian capitulation . 
  perhaps i 'm wrong . 
   guns were much more common in balkan countries . 
  do you have any sources on gun laws in serbia prior to ww2 ? 
  the kingdom was quite totalitarian as far as i know and probably had strict gun laws like poland i would assume . 
   one of two objectives of the movement , which was the military arm of the unitary national liberation front ( unof ) coalition , led by the communist party of yugoslavia ( kpj ) and represented by the anti-fascist council for the national liberation of yugoslavia ( avnoj ) , the yugoslav wartime deliberative assembly , was to fight the occupying forces . 
  ** until british supplies began to arrive in appreciable quantities in 1944 , the occupiers were the only source of arms . 
  ** basil davidson : partizan picture , 2016  the first small arms for the partisans were acquired from the defeated royal yugoslav army , like the m24 mauser rifle . 
  throughout the war the partisans used any weapons they could find , mostly weapons captured from the germans , italians , army of the ndh , usta\u0161e and the chetniks , such as the karabiner 98k rifle , mp 40 submachine gun , mg 34 machine gun , carcano rifles and carbines and beretta submachine guns . 
  the other way that the partisans acquired weapons was from supplies given to them by the soviet union and the united kingdom , including the ppsh-41 and the sten mkii submachine guns respectively . 
  additionally , partisan workshops created their own weapons modelled on factory-made weapons already in use , including the so-called `` partisan rifle '' and the anti-tank `` partisan mortar '' . 
  no source for this one , but from what i know it sounds accurate . 
   being armed was surely helpful for countries attacked by germans . 
  for example balcans were armed as hell so they can free themself from germany without help of ussr and become independent . 
  i think they were n't that armed , but ended up scavenging a lot of weapons from the germans . 
  as for the balkans freeing themselves and gaining independence , that was only yugoslavia . 
  no , i mean the fact that her party is doing better than they ever have before . 
  self determination for bosnia , croatia is a given , just do n't mention it in context with the 1 + million serbs who live there without self determination . 
  it does n't affect the votes ? 
  then explain le pen 's performance . 
  yes , it does . 
  his name means `` big pussy '' . 
   edit : serbians = serbs living in serbia proper serbians = anyone who lives in serbia , also serbia proper refers to only part of serbian territory ( without provinces ) . 
  znam , but still . 
  did n't imagine to be over poland etc. 
  serbia usually is n't included in these types of things because no eu membership . 
  serbia surprised me . 
  i linked the `` sju '' pronounciation above , just add the `` an '' from juan to it . 
  it 's quite similar to juan , but the u is much more emphasized in the swedish word . 
  sjuan means `` the ( number ) seven '' https://sv.wiktionary.org/wiki/fil:sv-sju.ogg < -- pronounciation of sju, 
  thats super confusing . 
  never heard them be called that : o only bubamara . 
   what are you talking about here ? 
  you are not the victims of the war ... there 's plenty of footage to prove that . 
   yes lots of people died and were forced to move from all the countries involved but to try to blame anyone else but yourself is ridiculous . 
  thousands of killed serb civilians were not victims ? 
  interesting . 
   this is about a law in bosnia and herzegovina , not serbia and people need to learn to integrate into the society as a nation . 
  why should someone * need * to integrate ? 
  that 's called forced integration . 
  why did n't albanians need to integrate in kosovo instead ? 
  i do n't see a republika kosovska anywhere in serbia . 
  do you think catalans * need * to integrate ? 
  what about basque country ? 
  what about any place with a sizeable separatist movements ? 
  someone above said it 's austrian , but i 'm unsure . 
  it piqued my interest as well , but i have n't bothered looking it up . 
  please share the information if you find it . 
  you could go to the wikipedia page and check the footnotes . 
   judging by your comment about alt-right trolls i am assuming this is supposed to debunk the `` explosion in violence due to immigration '' claim . 
  while it does that , it does n't debunk the more subtle point about many immigrant groups being heavily over-represented in certain crimes . 
  this over-representation does have an impact on the crime rate but it 's effects are most likely obscured by other larger trends such as changes in how crimes are recorded/counted . 
  immigrants are probably overrepresented , but that 's just assumptions . 
  my point was just to debunk that immigrants `` are killing sweden '' and the other shit they like to say . 
  sweden 's population has grown by almost 2 millions since 1977 , yet the amount of annual homicides has stayed stable around 100 . 
  they 're a very strong emerging region , but i would also not really call them the capital just yet . 
  they have , however , dominated league of legends for the last four years . 
  capital of starcraft and league of legends ( for now ) . 
  i wish i could answer your question but i have n't seen it nor has anyone i know xd, 
  looking at 2015 statistics for homicide , it does not look bad at all , with several western european countries behind sweden , but it does seem to rank under average , which took me by surprise actually . 
  i also found this while skimming through wikipedia :  studies of lethal violence in sweden have shown that more than half the reported cases were not actually cases of murder or manslaughter . 
  this is because the swedish crime statistics show all events with a lethal outcome that the police investigate . 
  many of these reported crimes turn out to be , in reality , suicides , accidents or natural deaths . 
  also , for the inevitable alt-right trolls , a short but important excerpt :  the number of cases of lethal violence in sweden has remained at a relatively constant level over the period of 1977 to 2007 -- around 100 cases per year -- in spite of the population increase over the same period, 
  rip, 
  do you * really * believe your own words ?
