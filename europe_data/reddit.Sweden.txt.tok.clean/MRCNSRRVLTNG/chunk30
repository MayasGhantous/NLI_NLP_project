  by not doing it to a selective group of teachers , you are showing disrespect swiss people can shake hands all they want , just like they show respect in that manner , others do n't . 
   you can take it further , some of the more fundamentalist wo n't even talk to female teachers . 
  should that be respected as `` religious freedom '' too ? 
  where is the line to draw , is it the high amount of punitive damage or the principle of it ? 
  not shaking hands with a teach and not talking to teachers is quite a difference , but even then , it 's not illegal to refuse to talk to a teacher . 
   you said you never disrespected your teachers , what does that even mean in your case ? 
  would it be disrespectful if they greet you , but you do n't greet back ? 
  reasonable expectations , we all know what it means . 
  not greeting back is disrespectful everywhere , so yeah , you know exactly what i mean . 
  downvotes incoming . 
  yes , i never disrespected my teachers . 
  my teachers had a reasonable definition of respect . 
  i came to their classes and they did their job . 
  i tried my best to be a good student . 
  never shook their hands , also never paid any 5000 usd fines . 
  sounds reasonable to me . 
  ah , yes , disrespect is illegal . 
  this is totally reasonable as long as you get to upset some muslim . 
   because their culture is important they can shake hands all they want , why make it a law ? 
  it 's fucking stupid . 
   you got a screwed sense of gender equality and therefore wo n't shake hands ? 
  bye . . not even about that , why would someone be legally bound to shake hands with someone at all ? 
   because their culture is important , and it 's up to them what exceptions can/should be made . 
  did you get angry when merkel refused to wear the veil in saudi arabia ? 
  of course not . 
  nowadays people get hard by the thought of denying muslims anything , to the point where they do n't even care about the circumstances . 
  why should someone face a 5000 usd fine for not shaking their teachers ' hands ? 
  ridiculous . 
  nope , the red army helped oust the nazis in the belgrade offensive , but yugoslavia effectively freed itself . 
  serbia was a part of yugoslavia , so it 's interesting you should mention serbia and not yugoslavia . 
  serbia was merely a republic . 
  no one was sold either . 
   i did n't expect you to feel sorry about german slave laborers or hundreds of thousands of dead during the expulsion . 
  but i 'm glad you learned something new . 
  nothing that i did n't know , just wanted to see the part where `` serbia sold germans as slaves '' , which obviously did n't happen . 
   serbia was a major part of yugoslavia . 
  do n't split hairs . 
  yup , one of six republics . 
   and i do n't trust those official soviet numbers . 
  there were way more than 12000 individuals transported to russia . 
  a lot of people simply disappeared in the chaos after the war . 
  it 's a miracle some made it back thanks to adenauer . 
  yugoslavia was n't `` serbia '' 2 . 
  according to that page , about 12 ' 000 germans were deported to the ussr for labor , no one was `` sold '' . 
  almost all of the surviving prisoners were released in 1950 . 
  source ? 
   people with foreign background is counted as people born abroad or with both parents born abroad of those 25 percent half are from outside the eu . 
  * half * from outside the eu . 
  do you want me to remind you which is , by far , the biggest religion in the eu ? 
   returning `` swedes '' give me a break . 
  statistics never take breaks . 
   meaning 12.5 percent of the population is from outside the eu of those 12.5 about 2-3 percent are african and most likely muslim and the rest except for a miniscule amount are muslims too . 
  looks like i 'll have to go through african countries as well  let me remind you which are the three biggest african immigrant groups in sweden : somalia ( 99.8 % muslim ) ethiopia ( 63 % * christian * ) eritrea ( 50 % * christian * ) those are the only three african countries that are in the top 31 immigrant groups in sweden . 
  people of african origin make up < 200 ' 000 of sweden 's population , many of whom are christian . 
   andel personer med utl\u00e4ndsk bakgrund : 26,8 % foreign background is another thing . 
   andelen utrikesf\u00f6dda : 17,9 % you just said foreign-born people make up 25 % yet now it 's 17,9 % ? 
  interesting . 
   andel personer med utl\u00e4ndsk bakgrund d\u00e4r andelen personer som har en inrikes f\u00f6dd f\u00f6r\u00e4lder och en utrikes f\u00f6dd f\u00f6r\u00e4lder \u00e4r medr\u00e4knad : 30,6 % still highly irrelevant considering the highest amount of foreign-born people before 2015 were returning swedes . 
  how does the amount of foreign-born matter in calculating the muslim population when  om vi vet om att 800 thousand come from countries with a almost 100 muslim background than it is safe to assume they are muslim . 
  the muslim population is about 8-10 percent . 
  stop lying . 
  except we do n't know that 800 ' 000 people are muslims , what a stupid fucking assumption . 
  i am a second-generation immigrant and i 'm not a muslim nor are my parents . 
  let me remind you which the biggest immigrant nationalities in sweden are , starting from the biggest to smallest of the top 10 : finland ( vast majority christian ) syria ( 74 % muslim ) iraq ( 86 % muslim ) poland ( vast majority christian ) iran ( 99.4 % muslim ) former yugoslavia ( big majority christian ) somalia ( 99.8 % muslim ) bosnia & herzegovina ( 51 % muslim ) germany ( vast majority christian ) turkey ( 96.5 % muslim ) you 're the only one lying , face it . 
  shitty statistics and blatant lying . 
  what i 'm saying is that assuming trends will continue like this is stupid . 
  just look at the last 100 years of demographic history i posted above . 
  serbia will not have a population of 5.3 million by 2100 . 
  there was huge emigration because of recent events . 
  16 % are foreign-born and only since 2015 are those people non-swedes . 
  prior to 2015 the biggest group of migrants were returning swedes . 
  as for muslims , there are no statistics on this and thus you have no way of knowing , since the last time sweden surveyed religion in sweden was 1930 . 
  it 's estimated to be 5-7 % . 
  do you have any actual statistics to support these claims ? 
  serbia 's population has decreased by 800 ' 000 ~ or so over the last 26 ~ years , which is expected following three wars and the third worst hyper-inflation ever , but thinking trends will continue the same way for 83 years in the future is naive . 
  1895 : 2,5 million ~ inhabitants 1991 : 7,8 ~ million inhabitants 2017 : 7,1 ~ million inhabitants ( excluding kosovo for the sake of the topic ), 
  beautiful, 
   unfortunately did n't last for very long unfortunately . 
  you can tell its unfortunate by the way it is, 
  yes , he 's very much a leftist . 
  it started earlier than that . 
  and apparently that 's a huge issue , to the point where `` politics is a bitch '' ... interesting . 
  this song is great . 
  are you inbred or something ? 
  do you not think every country has areas with higher crime ? 
  i 've been to a fuckton of claimed `` no-go zones '' , including the one where the reporter got punched , and nothing fucking happened to me . 
  there are no `` no-go zones '' . 
  a no-go zone for me is what the definition tells me it is . 
  google is your friend . 
  wait ... are you serious ? 
  what the fuck are you talking about ? 
  lmao what nobility ? 
  holy shit have you ever left your country ? 
  this is not the 1500s, 
  fair enough , no such area exists in sweden . 
  ctrl + f `` utanf\u00f6rskapsomr\u00e5de '' gives three hits , but they 're never used interchangeably with high risk areas . 
  they 're just stating that they need to combat `` utanf\u00f6rskap '' in `` utanf\u00f6rskapsomr\u00e5den '' , but they do n't refer to the 53 ~ high risk areas as utanf\u00f6rskapsomr\u00e5den . 
  the first part is not true . 
  they have not lost control of any area , if you were to read the report by the police , you 'd see they deal with the problems in those areas by having continuous police presence . 
  no-go zone ** has ** a definition , and thus it 's ** not ** a no-go zone for women .
