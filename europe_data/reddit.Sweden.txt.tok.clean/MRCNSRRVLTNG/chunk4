  no , croat is an ethnicity and so is serb . 
  he was an ethnic serb , not croat . 
  ah , no source then ? 
  unexpected . 
  [ here you are ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nikola_tesla#early_years ) in case you want to actually study his origin . 
  some other guy responded to my comment and he obviously does believe that . 
  it was a part of the austrian empire at the time . 
  except he never did write that in any diary and it 's propaganda made up by your beloved ljubica stefan who claims she read it in a diary in a visit to his museum in belgrade . 
  unsurprisingly , no one else has ever read that and it 's spread on obscure websites by people with no sense of source criticism . 
  great source . 
   americans ca n't really expect european levels of healthcare and social safety nets if they are solo-carrying an alliance . 
  [ it 's called inefficiency ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/oecd_health_expenditure_per_capita_by_country.svg/740px-oecd_health_expenditure_per_capita_by_country.svg.png )  i just really wish european folk would understand how much most americans care for them , or view them as friends , but that 's not a sentiment really reciprocated online . . sure did n't care when they forced europe to take care of their refugees from the iraq war etc. 
  rightclick on the video and there 's a button :p, 
  i want to know where you copied that from . 
  again , what even is this source ? 
   serbian nationalists you need to be a serbian nationalist to realize tesla was serbian ? 
  lol, 
  born in austrian empire , modern day croatia and thus some people want to/actually believe he was a croat . 
  [ you can link timestamps ] ( https://youtu.be/ok5lmqoromi?t=470 ), 
  that 's a weird way to group them up . 
  is there any data on them separately ? 
  i see . 
  i 'm trying to find data on the ethnicities of ex-yugoslavia separately , but it seems impossible . 
  sweden did hit 10 mil , but you have to take into consideration the migrants that have arrived . 
  is this an old study or why are they including yugoslavia ? 
  i see , thanks for the information . 
  i find that really weird actually . 
  hundreds or a couple of thousand civilians did end up dying because of certain yugoslav partisans , but is n't that just the hell that is war ? 
  i imagine they 'd understand there 'd be ( unjustifiable ) backlash considering what was happening during the war . 
   you 're applying the modern day concept of ethnicity to the medieval period ? 
  lol !, 
  uhm yes , just like tvrtko referred to his people as bo\u0161njani . 
  crazy , huh ? 
   i 've seen it mentioned on here tens of times ... well , everyone came from the slavs , the problem here is knowing when they broke off and from whom they broke off . 
  bosnia was founded much later than serbia and croatia and from what i can gather , probably did either break off from either `` croats '' and `` serbs '' which were the two identities present at the time , in the same sense that `` croats '' and `` serbs '' broke off from their initial slav identity . 
  no identity was the `` first '' since all people who exist today have the same ancestry originating in africa , so it does n't really matter . 
   you 're right , my `` swedish '' friend , calling his father , the king of bosnia , who declared himself as a bosnian , is incredibly `` interesting '' . 
  okay my `` french '' friend , but he was the ruler of bosnia because he [ inherited the title from his father ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hereditary_title ) , not because he was 100 % ethnically bosnian . 
   i 'm not denying that tvrtko had a claim to the serbian throne through his grandmother , what i 'm denying is that people use this as proof that bosnians are muslim serbs and other such crap . 
  i 'm sure no one here believes that . 
  mental gymnastics 4 life eh  the idea of restoring the serbian empire nevertheless persisted ; george discussed it in one of his charters , but the serbian regional lords were not considered suitable . 
  they only recently rose to prominence and lacked illustrious family background , as well as formal titles to their lands - they were merely `` lords '' . 
  tvrtko , on the other hand , not only controlled a significant portion of serbia , but was a member of the dynasty which had ruled as bans of bosnia since time immemorial and -- most importantly -- could boast descent from the nemanji\u0107 dynasty . 
  a genealogy assembled in his newly conquered serbian land emphasized his nemanji\u0107 ancestry , derived from his paternal grandmother , elizabeth , daughter of king dragutin . 
  a serbian logothete named blagoje , having found refuge at tvrtko 's court , attributed to tvrtko the right to a `` double crown '' : one for bosnia , the country which his dynasty had ruled since its foundation , and the other for the serbian lands of his nemanji\u0107 ancestors , who had `` left the earthly realm for the heavenly kingdom '' . 
  arguing that serbia had been `` left without its pastor '' , tvrtko set out to be crowned as its king . 
   tvrtko i 's signature , identifying him as `` king of the serbs and of bosnia '' tvrtko 's coronation as king of bosnia and serbia was held in the fall of 1377 ( probably 26 october feast day of saint demetrius ) , but there is no consensus as to where . 
  the ragusan chronicler mavro orbini wrote in 1601 that the coronation was performed in the serbian monastery of mile\u0161eva by its orthodox metropolitan , an opinion accepted today only in serbian historiography . 
  citing more recent archaeological and historical research , however , croatian and bosnian historians agree that the coronation more likely took place in the franciscan church of saint nicholas in the bosnian town of mile , which is the undisputed place of coronation of tvrtko i 's successors . 
  writing to ragusa shortly after the coronation , tvrtko successfully claimed saint demetrius income , which had been paid to the kings of serbia since the 13th century . 
   although he presented himself as heir to the nemanji\u0107 crown , tvrtko decided to assume the royal title of his great-grandfather rather than continue du\u0161an 's unpopular claim to imperial style , thus becoming `` by the grace of god king of the serbs , bosnia , pomorje and the western areas '' . 
  in addition to the royal title , tvrtko also adopted the symbolical name stephen in order to associate himself with the nemanji\u0107 kings ; his successors followed suit . 
  tvrtko , in fact , at times completely omitted his birth name and used only the honorific . 
  tvrtko 's right to kingship was derived from serbia 's , and was likely recognized by lazar hrebljanovi\u0107 and vuk brankovi\u0107 , but he never established authority over the regional lords of serbia . 
  tvrtko 's new title was also approved by louis , by his daughter and successor mary , and eventually by her husband sigismund . 
  venice and ragusa consistently referred to tvrtko as king of rascia , the latter even complaining in 1378 about tvrtko 's preoccupation with his new kingdom . 
  crowned as king of serbia 2 . 
  controls only part of serbia 3 . 
  cooperated with the serbian lords of what was left of the serbian empire against the ottoman empire . 
  yet apparently serbia did not continue its statehood . 
  ps tvrtko 's father 's mother was a serb , so calling his father `` bosnian '' is interesting . 
   are you serious ? 
  he says that serbs continued their statehood with the kotromanic dynasty . 
  the way you play ignorant to obvious facts never ceases to amaze . 
  exactly how does that imply that the kotromanic dynasty were serbs ? 
  you just try your hardest to be offended by everything . 
  the serbs did continue their statehood with the kotromanic dynasty , more precisely , they continued statehood with tvrtko i , also known as stefan tvrtko , a honorary title he adopted in light of his serbian nemanjic dynasty ancestry . 
  a new king does not mean serbia disappeared . 
  he was the king of bosnia and serbia and had close relations with the serbian regional lords . 
   coincidentally , 15 june 1389 was also the day when the ottoman army met a coalition of serbian states at the battle of kosovo . 
  tvrtko , feeling it his duty as king of serbia , ordered his army to leave dalmatia and assist the lords lazar hrebljanovi\u0107 and vuk brankovi\u0107 . 
  what exactly does this prove ? 
  [ serbia in 1374 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/central_balkans_1373_1395.png/1024px-central_balkans_1373_1395.png ) , serbia did n't lose its statehood and collaborated with tvrtko a bunch . 
  where does he claim the dynasty as serbian ? 
  yes, 
  i do n't see where he implies it is . 
   yes , and i agreed with you from the start that he is dynastically tied to the nemanjic through his grandmother ... 
  yet you were obviously denying that he 's ( part ) serb ? 
  you said he had a `` bosnian father and croatian mother '' ? 
   then tvrtko was a croat , since 25 % bosnian 25 % serb and 50 % croatian , making him twice as much croat as he was serb or bosnian :p i would n't know nor would i mind . 
  i could n't find information about all his grandparents . 
   ... and ? 
  how does his bosnian half count but not his serbian ? 
   does english do ? 
  im dying idk whats wrong with my brain atm  because his immediate parents were not serbs . 
  his mother was a croat and his father was bosnian , only one of his grandmothers was a serb . 
  but if his grandmother was serbian , that would make his father half serb , half bosnian , which means he 's part serbian . 
   no , he absolutely is part serb , just not serb . 
  i am part serb , also like tvrtko 1/4th serb because my grandfather married a serb woman , but i am croat , because 3/4th of my other bloodline is croat . 
  it goes a lot further back than just grandmother etc , that 's why it 's impossible to debate . 
  that 's what i said from the start , part serb . 
  you 're saying his father was `` bosnian '' yet he was just as much serbian , if his mother was a serb . 
   how ? 
   his father was bosnian and his mother a croat . 
  his father had a serbian mother , does that not count ? 
  lol  you mean descendant . 
  yeah lol  to which he had a connection skipped by two generations . 
  what do you mean ? 
  his grandmother was the daughter of stefan dragutin . 
  how is anything `` skipped '' here ?
