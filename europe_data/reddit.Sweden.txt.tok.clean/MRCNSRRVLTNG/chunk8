  the eu has made deals with the countries on how many refugees they will have to accept and it has nothing to do with sweden . 
  it 's not like we can tell them to just come over to europe and chill in a country of their choice . 
  if they are n't accepted , they have to go back . 
  even funnier , can you explain how sweden is to blame for turkey 's situation ? 
  do you actually think sweden is the reason there are migrants in turkey ? 
  you 're in for a shocker when you realize turkey shares borders with syria and iraq , my friend . 
  sweden ca n't invite migrants to turkey . 
  turkey is n't even in the eu lol . 
  spoiler alert : swedes speak english for the same reason americans do ; the british . 
  another spoiler : american pop culture is global because they 're the biggest and thus richest western country by a huge margin and their official language happens to be the lingua franca . 
  responding to this caused a lot of cringe , please do n't do this to yourself . 
  please get educated on basic politics . 
  someone really has filled your head with propaganda , congratulations . 
   so you 'd cut down military support then ? 
  lol  you ca n't have your cake & eat it too buddy . 
  i obviously said they would increase support , we would just not be as retarded as the us and fucking butcher civilians and focus on our interests over the safety of the people . 
  no , we 're not americans . 
  theocracy though . 
  like , have you finished elementary school ? 
  they 'd still have over 3000 nato troops and eu would undoubtedly increase support . 
  serbia is very pro-eu , what rock have you been living under ? 
  theocracy ... how uneducated and/or brainwashed do you have to be . 
   do you not know that international law as such did n't really exist in the 19th century ? 
  except serbs made up about half of kosovo 's population 100 years ago , now they make up less than 10 % or so . 
  it 's not a problem of the 19th century whatsoever . 
  just between 1999 and 2004 , 200 ' 000 people had to flee to serbia , most serbs or romani . 
   i 'd argue i 'm more informed than you . 
  your anecdotal evidence means nothing . 
  is n't it kind of funny that americans still outrape norwegians ? 
  like , these scary ayrabs from third world countries ca n't even outrape americans ... damn . 
  what does this have to do with sweden , france or germany again ? 
   you ca n't employ them without making government jobs for them lol im sure if you moved to europe without knowing a lick of the language or customs ( lol americans and customs ) you 'd find a job right away , eh ? 
  please . 
  look at iranians and yugoslav who have been here for 20-40 years and you 'll be shocked . 
   you ca n't keep them from throwing fucking grenades in public places and you ca n't keep them from raping people . 
  well , sweden would have hundreds of thousands of rape if that were true , eh ? 
  we 've got laws here , rape or kill and you will be dealt with like any other swede . 
   did n't one of your courts just rule a 14 year old girl 's marriage to a 21 year old man is legit ? 
  are you people insane ? 
  no idea , i do n't read breitbart . 
   what ? 
  every top comment in this thread are people cheering this . 
  it may or may not have slightly changed since , you know , 6 hours ago when i posted my comment . 
  it 's still gone far right . 
  edit : the comments are not positive whatsoever , what are you talking about ? 
   people are turning far right because this is a fucking disaster . 
  france is still in perpetual riot mode , you ca n't go to a pool in sweden without being molested and you ca n't shop at a market in germany without being run over . 
  at this point i ca n't even tell if you 're trolling or not , but i can definitely tell you 're american . 
  no one gives a shit about your uninformed opinion . 
  for your info , i 've been to a pool many times , and i 've seen many females at these pools who are not getting molested . 
   serbia even tried to rile up serbs in montenegro and aided russia in this coup attempt . 
  source ? 
  is this a fact now because the sunday telegraph claims so or is there anything to back it up ? 
  even then , what do two serbian nationalists have to do with the serbian state ? 
   montenegro managed to surpass all its neighbors , serbia included in progress of all kinds . 
  what kind of progress ? 
   meanwhile serbia is a de facto chirch state ran by religious fundamentalists and fanatics interesting . 
  because not being pro-eu and pro-nato makes one a serbian subject ... interesting , especially since serbia is very pro-eu . 
  since when does serbia have that kind of influence ? 
  i could mention about a million things , but i 'll go with 1 ) the massive amount of crimes during the cold war period that no one even talks about or takes responsibility for , 2 ) they 're currently bombing 5 countries or so , and have military influence in 130 ~ training troops etc. 
  america is far from being akin to europe in my opinion . 
   the data also revealed that the employment rate was 56.1 % for non-eu citizens , compared with 68.9 % for citizens of the reporting country . 
  yes , because learning the language and customs of the country is not a thing . 
  as i mentioned before , iranians and bosnians who have now lived here for 20-40 years mainly are some of the most educated people in the country . 
   mate , you 've admitted imprecission : and i 've already explain a title can be deemed imprecise until it 's literally the same thing as the article , because a title will never be as descriptive as the whole article . 
   since you do n't seem to grasp this : precision is exactness in the sense of exactly depicting everything ( as close as humanly possible ) . 
  accuracy is exactness in the sense of `` not presenting wrong information '' . 
  so yeah , the title is technically correct . 
  but it 's by no means displaying the protest precisely enough . 
  oh , so so it 's like that because you think so or what ? 
  let 's take a look at the oxford dictionary : ** precise ** : marked by exactness and ** accuracy ** of expression or detail . 
  ** accuracy ** : the quality or state of being correct or ** precise . 
  ** it 's just glaringly obvious that you 're whining because you do n't agree with the migration policies . 
  your arrogance makes me cringe . 
   i 'm not in a bubble said every person in a bubble ever . 
   `` accurate '' and `` precise '' is not the same , mate . 
  try again . 
  you could argue it is not , but you could argue a title is imprecise until the point where the title is the exact same as the article . 
  beside all of that , oxford would like a word with you : `` imprecise adjective lacking exactness and accuracy of expression or detail . 
  ` the witness could give only vague and imprecise descriptions ' ''  you are naive to think people will read more than the title if the title already sets this kind of tone for the whole article . 
  --  `` keep living in dreamland . 
  it 's nice there , i hear '' . 
  it draws more readers for the simply fact that it sounds more interesting and uses more every day language . 
   soooo you 're saying it 's clickbait ? 
  cause that what this sounds like to me . 
  `` baiting people in with inaccurate , imprecise , or untrue statements . '', 
  again , you could argue that anything that is not precisely the same as the article is clickbait because it 's not descriptive enough . 
  no point going down this rabbit hole because in my opinion it 's a decent title describing the situation . 
   the burden the media is supposed to lighten off the people is to accurately , precisely , impartially , and truthfully inform the public . 
  by neglecting one of these modifiers , you are effectively rendering the service null , since if even of of them is missing the entire act of reporting becomes unreliable as a way to gain information . 
  except spreading propaganda has always been easy , just look at wars . 
  you ca n't take anything `` media '' says for granted . 
  not to mention that this description better fits the scientific sources the papers use than the paper/author themselves , so point proven . 
   really ? 
  cause i can potentially see three , as it is omitting important information :  enrage people that spain wants to take in more refugees  guilt people into taking in more refugees  shift public opinion towards refugees by pointing out people want more refugees . 
   some of those are mutually exclusive of course , and it will depend on the average readership which goal the publication likely wanted to achieve , but i think we can guess based on the overall article which of those it was . 
  anything can be `` pushing an agenda '' if you so will it , i 've explained above why i do n't criticize the title and i personally think their title is better than yours , since it actually implies that the protesters want more immigration , as opposed to yours which can be interpreted as both for and against , and considering today 's political climate , it would be mostly wrongly interpreted ( opinion ) . 
   then the media should n't have special protections , such as `` freedom of the press '' , as the reason for this freedom is based on the public service ( `` informing the public accurately , truthfully , precisely and impartially '' ) it provides . 
  except freedom of the press is most often just stopping government from interfering . 
  there 's freedom of speech for individuals as well , which does not mean everyone does or is obliged to speak the truth .
