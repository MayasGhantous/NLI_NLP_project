yes , that is the law , but in practice most employers sign kollektivavtal ( collective agreement ) that regulates that kind of things for their employees . 
  in some branches in particular it is impossible to not sign the collective agreement , since if you are n't your company will be put in blockade . 
  image trying to run a restaurant without anyone picking up your garbage . 
  you will be quite quick to sign a collective agreement that guarantees your waitresses a minimum wage . 
  since you read it you might have noticed that it was meant as a brief comment to [ this article by simon wren-lewis ] ( http://mainlymacro.blogspot.se/2013/08/the-centre-cannot-hold.html ) which talks more about the netherlands . 
  it 's a blog post . 
  not a treatise . 
  also , the argument is not that unemployment increased less in belgium implies that they spent more . 
  the argument is that the netherlands which did everything right according to the austerians have had a worse development than a very similar country that has n't done everything right . 
  this is part of the growing evidence that maybe the austerity policy wo n't solve our problems . 
  germany and spain are n't particularly similar . 
  anyway , krugman writes about two blog posts per day . 
  if you want rigor , i suggest you read his academic papers or textbooks . 
  i do n't think this is very complicated . 
  of course policy influences the economic development . 
  that does n't mean that you ca n't say things like `` policy a will have effect b while policy c will have effect d '' and be perfectly correct while being quite bad in predicting if policy a or c will be chosen . 
  the predictions about the effects will be valuable independently of if the predictions of which policy will be chosen are correct . 
  then we all hope that correct predictions of the outcomes will affect the policy makers . 
  this is why krugman over and over again repeats his same arguments in an often simplified form . 
  very few read the academic papers . 
  if you have the chance to repeat your message twice a week in one of the most read papers in the world , you do have a chance to actually influence policy . 
  unfortunately there is n't much room for complex explanations in that kind of media . 
  there is nothing in the analysis that denies reality . 
  he is saying that `` if your interest is b , then you should chose policy a. 
  policy c that you have chosen now will lead to d that is contrary to your stated interest . '', 
  of course he knows that they likely will chose policy c anyway . 
  but i actually think that the reason why austerity is losing popularity in europe and elsewhere is because people are realising that there is something behind what he is saying . 
  unfortunately european policy makers are too heavily invested in the austerity policy to back down now . 
  i just wish there was a faster way that we voters could get them replaced . 
  i linked you the article in another post , figuring you would be able to find/read it if so inclined . 
  no , you did n't . 
  you linked to a summary that did n't provide any details about the arguments against krugman . 
   it is . 
  because the actual causes have nothing to do with just `` austerity '' , as krugman likes to point out . 
  `` cherry picking '' implies that there is other more relevant data that contradicts the presented data . 
  of course there might be other arguments against krugman , but do n't accuse krugman of cherry picking if you ca n't back it up . 
   the main problems plaguing dutch economy is a housing market hitting rock bottom , ... and these are the exact conditions where austerity is the worst possible medicin !, 
  when the consumers decrease consumption because of debt overhang after e.g. 
  a collapsed housing market or because of a loss of consumer confidence then aggregate demand decreases and the whole economy contracts . 
  in this situation the sensible thing for a government to do is to increase its own spending to compensate for the loss of aggregate demand among consumers . 
  make sure that the unemployed have some money so their hair dressers and mechanics do n't also lose their jobs . 
  employ people in infrastructure projects to avoid getting people trapped in long time unemployment and to make sure that subcontractors do n't have to fire more people . 
  in this way the economy has a chance to recover in a reasonable time . 
  if the government instead chooses to decrease its own spending , then of course aggregate demand will decrease even more . 
  people who might have been employed by the government are now unemployed . 
  the unemployed let their hairs grow and neglect the maintenance of their cars , and then suddenly their hairdressers and mechanics are soon unemployed too . 
  and this is of course what has happened in the whole eurozone and continue to happen . 
  and predictably , soon six years after the start of the crisis there is n't any recovery in sight . 
  krugman is n't advancing austerity no matter what . 
  he is advancing austerity under the precise conditions you describe . 
  they are n't unrelated . 
  it is precisely because the debt overhang and because the lack of consumer confidence that austerity is such disastrous policy . 
  the original krugman piece [ was very easy to find ] ( http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/13/a-tale-of-two-flat-countries/ ) . 
  looking for the other piece i found [ this ] ( http://www.ftm.nl/column/van-wijnbergen-door-jaloezie-verblind/ ) , which is n't very kind to the professor that wrote the one you referred to . 
  since you ca n't provide the original criticism , maybe you can repeat some of the arguments . 
  which data was cherry picked and what data would better represent the situation ? 
  i have found that [ this site is very useful to visualize data ] ( http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=z8o7pt6rd5uqa6_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=unemployment_rate&amp;fdim_y=seasonality:sa&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country_group&amp;idim=country_group:non-eu&amp;idim=country:be:nl&amp;ifdim=country_group&amp;tstart=1168556400000&amp;tend=1378936800000&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ) . 
  so the unemployment in netherlands did increase 3 % while the one in belgium increased about 1 % . 
  that is of course just cherry picking ? 
  anyway , i think you can use the tools i just linked to and show me the metrics that you think matters and is n't cherry picked . 
  this is like most critics of krugman i hear . 
  someone read someone who claimed that krugman was wrong . 
  this is not how to argue . 
  tell me exactly what krugman said and in what way it was contrary to evidence . 
  in this case it would be sufficient to link to krugman 's original piece and to the article you refer to . 
  google can probably produce a comprehensible translation if it is n't in english . 
  and finally , did you yourself even read the original krugman piece or do you only rely on his critics representation of it ? 
  his blog posts sometimes contain deeper reasoning for those who want to understand him better . 
  it interesting that the only prediction he got wrong was a political one and not an economic . 
  the economy has panned out very much like krugman predicted . 
  his mistake was to underestimate the political will to hold the eurozone together , as well as how much suffering the people were willing to tolerate . 
  i think this is krugman in a nutshell . 
  his economical analysis is usually spot on , and his prediction are usually very good . 
  the economical development in the eurozone is still as miserable as he predicted five years ago it would be with this policy . 
  on the other hand , his political analyses are usually not as spot on , even though he usually hits home more often than most pundits . 
  yes , * historically * it was a very apt term . 
  somewhere here . 
  i think you have to collect your forces and clear up how to use the terminology also within your ranks then . 
   well for the first one , are you claiming that some nonsense said by ( of all people ) sharon osborne and some shitty daytime tv show are indicative of what women as a whole think ? 
  they all sat around her and laughed . 
  the audience was laughing . 
  where was the backlash ? 
  all those women who afterwards stood up and demanded a boycott of everything osborne ? 
  compare that with the outcry if the sexes had been reversed and a man would have talked about the mutilation of a woman as something amusing . 
   as for the second , who controls the vast majority of society ? 
  which gender has pretty much always coveted the top spots in politics , industry , entertainment , and so on ? 
  which gender is also ten times as likely to end up in jail and about four times as likely to feel that they have to kill themselves ? 
  considering that men are more likely to be found in the absolute bottom than in the top , is it hard to claim that society is weighted in favour of men in general . 
   do you really think women have the power necessary to teach generations of kids to laugh at the misfortune of men ? 
  who takes care and shapes the childrens worldview during their most sensitive years ? 
   if they did , do n't you think they 'd be running things a little more directly ? 
  no , because obviously they do n't . 
   it 's easier to educate people about the new meaning of words , rather than make people stop using contemporary meanings that words inevitably acquire . 
  in this case feminists are trying to give a new meaning to a word with already very strong connotations , and outside feminist circles the word still has it 's old meaning . 
  if feminists have honests intentions to communicate with people outside their own circles , is it a really crappy word to use . 
  egalitarianism is a much better word , but my guess is that for the lit crits it is repulsive to use words that is clear with their original meanings . 
  i do know that modern feminists use the word differently than its original meaning . 
  [ see this comment of mine ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1okqnd/sweden_men_as_likely_as_women_to_suffer_spousal/cct5g7z ) . 
  also , the meaning of the feminists `` patriarchy '' is very elusive . 
  it seems to mean `` those structures in society that make women have less power than men and make less money '' .
