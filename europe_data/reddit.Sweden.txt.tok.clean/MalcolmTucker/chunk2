  sounds like denmark all right . 
  / / sweden, 
  i know which country i 'd rather be born in . 
  wtf macedonia ? 
  is this finlands new defence policy against russin ? 
  these figures reflects 6-9 months ago . 
  probably just a swedish mink . 
  it is probably more of finlands dependence on russia than on greece that is the problem . 
  this is just a story about euro-weakness . 
  also , this would be a line graph and not a bar chart . 
  * eur / usd jan 1 2015 1.21 * eur / usd apr 13 2015 1.05 difference : - 12.66 % difference in op 's graph : 17.10 % - 2.41 % = 14.69 % euro stoxx outpeformance in usd ~ 2 % * * good enough relative approximation, 
  best way to stop isis is to support the guy who ignored the problem and indirectly supported them ? 
  worrying that all our neighbours have such a weak outlook . 
  are they back at pre-crisis levels yet ? 
  look up optimum currency area for an answer to your question . 
  nordic unions are centralized/collective bargaining on the industry level . 
  not like the stuff in the us where single factories negotiate for wages . 
  move to sweden . 
  how far right are these guys on a european scale ? 
  laughing at denmark is a duty . 
  it 's what we do before going to the mosque to cash in our weekly br\u00e4nnvin-allowance . 
  i thought you were high on that horse belittling sweden ? 
  come on . 
  do n't give up !, 
  maybe conformist . 
  there are many people who ca n't handle two things at the same time `` racism is wrong '' and `` muslims can be bad '' . 
  goes for the entire spectrum of politics though . 
  just look at this sub . 
  would you call your police leftist in the uk ? 
  i do n't think we would in sweden . 
  maybe the uk is different . 
  that `` certain branch '' consists of 12 people with twitter accounts . 
  it 's the `` certain branch of the left '' in sweden that conducted the study and that are doing all the social work relating to these problems . 
  but go on and live in your bubble . 
  does n't matter , had leftist-rage . 
  the people who have been fighting for gender equality have been secretly fighting for oppression of muslim women in swedish suburbs ? 
  when you feel better you should ask yourself why the study was initiated by ( v ) , not by ( sd ) , and why it 's published on aftonbladet and not fria tider or whatever the preferred news site is for the far right . 
  i 'm as far away from a shock as is possible . 
  the article is published in the largest leftist newspaper . 
  funny how that works , huh ? 
  the people screaming the loudest about women 's right in muslim dominated areas do n't give a single fuck about women 's rights . 
  they never cared and rather openly mock the same people who conducted the study . 
  now they act like they care when it fits the general anti-immigration agenda . 
  regressive muslims are threatening their monopoly of bigotry . 
  simple as that . 
  see you at poltava , suckers !, 
  if you want a strong defense you need to spend money . 
  there 's no way around it , conscription or not . 
  the state of the swedish military during conscription is severely over-hyped . 
  i do n't know about finland but in sweden we do n't spend any money and thus the strength of our military is low . 
  even though we have a lot of shiny and advanced hardware . 
  yes . 
  [ so tight belts ] ( http://www.ekonomifakta.se/fakta/ekonomi/hushallens-ekonomi/hushallens-inkomster/ ), 
  it 's incredible that you have to defend this . 
  but that 's the state of the world these days i guess . 
  like that needs to be spelled out ? 
  my lifestyle has been incredible enriched by immigrants . 
  just the fact that pretty much every restaurant and convenience stora and other service establishments is run by hard working immigrants who keep great opening hours . 
  this did n't exist 10 to 20 years ago . 
  i have many colleagues and friends who are immigrants . 
  as far as culture goes i think it will be incredibly important to stand up for our humanistic-inspired ( rationalism , empiricism ) policy and culture . 
  i see the threat of the right wing ( lex poland ) as larger than that from for example islamic values even though both need to be dealt with . 
  the chance of getting an islamic government is 0 % but the chance of a backwards and regressive far-right wing government is real . 
  yes , it 's an incredible challenge . 
  but there is no ned to be hysterical about it . 
  from 163 000 to 200 000 to 1 000 000 . 
  incredible . 
  despite that likely half would be denied asylum making the original figure 80 000 . 
  i have already replied to your copy-paste in that exact thread . 
   last year 163000 , or precisely 10 times the number from 2000 . 
  is it going to be easier or harder with 10 times the number , no housing available , etc ? 
  but of course it 's going to be harder . 
  not a single official has denied this . 
  but your claim about bankruptcy and the end of sweden is just pathetic . 
  here is some info in swedish that includes a graph over disposable income over time . 
  http://www.ekonomifakta.se/fakta/ekonomi/hushallens-ekonomi/hushallens-inkomster/ as you can see , despite the rhetoric around here , the situation from a household perspective was never that great in the good old days since disposable income was very stagnant during the 80s and 90s . 
  [ bankruptcy according to / u/longdonglasse ] ( http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=ds22a34krhq5p_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=gd_pc_gdp&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country_group&amp;idim=country_group:eu:non-eu&amp;idim=country:se:de:hu:fi:el:dk:it&amp;ifdim=country_group&amp;ind=false ), 
  no one is denying that getting refugees into employment is n't a major challenge . 
  but the hysterical level of discourse is embarassing . 
  it will be interesting to see what can come out of the database that the blog refers to ( new since 2010 ) . 
  since you mentioned 2000 we can take a look at [ gdp/capita for sweden since 2001 . 
  you ask about finland and then act like a twat ? 
  nice . 
  here are some older figures : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_employment_rate it does n't use the same denominator as the . se figures which uses ages 15-74 and not 15-64 . 
  employment rate for immigrants is 59.8 % which is similar to hungary but better than spain and greece . 
  it 's much lower than for swedes though with one of the biggest gaps in europe . 
  however , these are refugees and not just immigrants . 
  it 's probably reasonable to expect a much lower employment rate than for the general immigrant group if something is not done . 
  we have tons of people from syria already in sweden but i have n't seen any figures for that group . 
  would be interesting . 
  this is the exact same background as sweden . 
  i do n't see why it would n't work for finland with their own currency . 
  maybe finland should adopt the swedish krona ? 
  * runs away *, 
  norway can afford to adopt in a controlled way if they wish . 
  it 's much harder for finland . 
  they have already `` lost '' 7-8 years of growth . 
  compared to norway sweden is pretty much an anarcho-capitalist society . 
  support for the euro is at an abysmal 15 % . 
  used to be almost 50 % .
