  you got steamrolled by both the turks and mongols , and you think we should kiss your asses for doing nothing ? 
  literally anyone who fought any battle against any turk or mongol are claiming they saved europe , often because of the lack of anything else in their nations uninteresting history . 
   i guess then we should have just let them through to rape your grand grand grand mother and then i could call your people `` quasi-turkish '' tribe . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/magyar_tribes  the hungarian social structure was of turkic origin ; moreover the hungarian language was affected by turkic linguistic influence . 
  `` quasi-turkic '' would not be inaccurate . 
  it 's clear that you really do n't want to admit that europe has in * any * way been influenced by islam , even though that is wrong . 
  `` middle east '' refers to , well , the middle east . 
  avicenna was born in central asia , and was like so many other scholars , active in that area . 
  so no , you ca n't deny that the islamic world exists . 
  the only word you could use to replace it would be literally defining geography after religion and culture . 
   firstly the turks themselves are not native european people . 
  they settled in anatolia after arriving from central asia and invading and killing many of the greeks and ethnically european peoples who lived there . 
  [ nope , you 're wrong . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/genetic_history_of_the_turkish_people ) it 's always funny to catch people literally talking out of their asses . 
   as a result , several studies have concluded that the indigenous peoples of anatolia are the primary source of the present-day turkish population ,, 
  easy , let 's just deny all conservatives applying for asylum , and let 's deport all of our own conservatives and far right wingers to antarctica . 
  or wait , is being a dumb conservative/right winger only bad if the person is middle eastern ? 
  edit : it seems so . 
  was islam ? 
  it was never forced upon anyone . 
  entire families didi n't get converted and the ones who did were the first born sons taken and they were all raised in turkey . 
  any modern islam in the balkans is purely voluntary/for benefits . 
  i do n't see what the problem is . 
  can someone explain why this is `` controversial '' ? 
  and pagan before the romans came . 
  and no religion before humans arrived . 
  your point ? 
  likely because [ only about 12 % support sharia laws . 
  ] ( http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-beliefs-about-sharia/ ) i do n't see how it could grow to majority in time . 
   edit : only 87 % of swedes are christian , and only 18 % actually believe in god . 
  compare that to the other nations ... you must mean that 87 % of swedes are baptised ? 
  because there is no way that many would answer that they 're christian . 
  man , i almost cut myself on that edge . 
  be careful !, 
  oh no , it 's dr. dane !, 
  eat what ? 
  this definition includes germany and russia . 
  it 's literally just the northern half of europe . 
  by that definition , you might aswell consider the baltics to be north-eastern europe . 
  northern europe implies nordics , baltic states are obviously eastern european . 
  being in nato does n't make you nordic , the difference between us are huge . 
  the estonians happen to have a similar language to finnish , that 's it . 
  i made a claim that the starvation in the middle east was n't big enough to justify calling middle easterners `` starving '' , not that there was no starvation , there is starvation everywhere . 
  let 's not discuss this further . 
  you are not getting it . 
  just because iraq was in danger of starvation and this was from what i understand averted does n't mean anyone actually starved . 
  or that saying that kids are starving in the middle east is n't an inaccurate statement , since you can only come up with ** one single country ** that was ** close to starvation ** . 
  this has happened in the recent century in europe too , but we do n't go around saying `` oh poor european kids '' do we ? 
  i do n't get why you are taking this so aggressively either . 
  i didi n't call your mother ignorant , some other guy did . 
  if you ca n't read usernames then please get off reddit , i said that she in no way said what you claimed she said . 
   i also ask you to say that you are ignorant as you said about my passed away mother . 
  bonus points for trying to make me feel bad for you , it kind of almost worked . 
  rip pekka 's mom . 
  turkey sure as hell is a muslim country . 
  you are changing the goalposts when the data does n't fit you . 
   i did n't suggest it . 
  i suggested to poll muslims who are against sharia in the host country about acceptable punishment for apostasy ( or premarital sex or adultery or burning a copy of koran ) which only makes sense given sharia law , so i think you are trying to arouse suspicion against even the non-islamist muslims because the statistics are against you . 
   furthermore , comparing them to men of the native population , they still commit far , far , far more crime , particularly of the violent kind as i said . 
  source ? 
  did you find anything to support your claims other than wartime shortages in one country ? 
  then this conversation is finished . 
  now just photoshop a turban , and you 've got the new thereligionofpeace top story . 
  is that you ? 
  also soviet union . 
  poland will catch up , do n't worry . 
   `` my mom taught me that i have to eat everything - `` think the children who live in africa/middle-east '' . 
  i took issue with this , and you challanged me . 
  therefore you agree . 
  perhaps communication breaks down on reddit or something . 
  aha , so iraq has some local malnutrition during wartimes . 
  tell me why this makes the entire middle east starving ? 
  you do n't seem to get it do you ? 
  if you took in people of different ages and sexes so that the migrant population matched the natives , the difference would n't be that large . 
  i 'm sorry but if you seriously do n't get it by now , i 'm probably going to give up , what a waste of time . 
  you made a positive claim , you are the one that has to prove it , or more like defend you mothers statement , if she actually made it . 
  i 'm finding nothing on starvation in the middle east . 
  show me that there is wide scale starvation in the middle east that justifies such a statement first . 
  i suspect that your mother said no such thing . 
  i didi n't ask you about the food in the middle east , i asked you if people were starving there ? 
  turns out the answer is no . 
  yes , i did ask you about the starving . 
  so , are they starving ? 
  as in starving ? 
  so your answer is no ? 
  til that people in the middle east starve ? 
  so you are from a couple of islands between jutland and scandinavia ? 
  still not scandinavia . 
  nope , they are n't really scandinavian anyways , they 're attached to germany !, 
  i love the mediterranean , i 've been to turkey like 20 times !, 
   nevertheless apostasy is heavily punished ( usually by death ) in about every muslim country out there . 
  number of muslim countries : 51 number of muslim countries that execute for apostasy : 10 number of muslim countries that fine or jail for apostasy : 7 https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/apostasy_laws_in_2013.svg it 's funny that you 're still lying and making shit up on the spot . 
  and what 's even more funny is that you try and suggest things in our blind spot , like :  it 's a pity those stats do n't include views of muslims who do n't think sharia should be law of the land . 
  are you suggesting people who are against sharia want to enact sharia law punishment ? 
  because that is laughably wrong . 
  young men commit most of the crimes , if most of immigrants are proportionally young men , it 's obvious that they would commit proportionally more crime , its really not that hard to understand . 
  alright , we ca n't all agree can we ? 
  thank you for maintaining a civil tone . 
  that one is from a far-right israeli website , and it 's also debunked , sorry : http://www.loonwatch.com/2011/12/gil-ronens-fabricated-statistics-about-oslo-rapists-being-all-muslim/, 
  eh , what the hell are you reading ?
