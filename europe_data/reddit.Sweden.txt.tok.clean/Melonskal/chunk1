`` i dare say with confidence that , had us europeans not been around , it would 've been eastern asia that had come to lead the world for a significant period of time '' no shit ... 
  it is really amazing actually how a few european nations were able to completely dominate pretty much the entire world with a fraction of its population . 
  we call the ground floor the first in sweden too , danskj\u00e4vel . 
  you greatly overestimate russias military prowess compared to that of the eu which has three times the population , has more than 7 times larger gdp , has nukes and overall more advanced technology and not to mention would be defending . 
  it is also pretty much guaranteed that the us would intervene and aid the eu to sink every russian ship in the baltic , bombing all nearby military forces to oblivion and then stopping at russias border to avoid nuclear war . 
  the vietnamese population were also very poor and had little to lose by fighting . 
  the terrain where 95 % of sweden 's tiny population lives is also far less defensive than vietnam 's dense jungles . 
  if half the neo nazis live in russia that is extremely high per capita . 
  difference in total gdp . 
  please do !, 
  could we throw finland and the baltics on too ? 
  it seems like it , the parties of the former goverment seem butt hurt and do n't want to co operate for some idiotic reason . 
  `` collapse of the greens '', 
  i just voted for the left-center social democrats , i really hope we win . 
  that 's islam . 
  is n't russias economy mainly based on natural resources though which are abundant in the east and centre ? 
  by the way , would n't large parts of the russian forces be stationed in the east and to some extent the south to defend just in the same way large parts of us forces would remain in the americas ? 
  should n't this even out the odds ? 
  russia has more landmass to defend but fewer troops and much poorer power projection . 
  all right , you seem knowledgeable . 
  still , russia would n't attack a nato country unless they all become absolutely batshit insane and then they might use nukes and everyone is fucked anyway . 
  yes , it 's kind of insane really . 
  is n't a lot of russia 's military hardware old and their regular army just 100-200k troops though ? 
  would n't a highly technologically superiour force of 100 000 entrenched soldiers be able to halt the russians ? 
  if russia had problems invading chechnya how on earth would they attack the most powerful military power to ever exist ? 
  you would n't need half a million soldiers in eastern europe . 
  station 100 000 soldiers there with good air support and the russians would never get through unless they used nukes . 
  for perapective , the us already has 60 000 soldiers in europe . 
  ukraine is in neither the eu or nato , you ca n't determine how the west would act if poland or the baltics were attacked based on ukraine . 
  the us has ~ 60k troops in europe of which 40k are stationed in europe . 
  adding the military and aerial power of certain other nato contries poland could probably be held . 
  britain was far more powerful . 
  in some ways . 
  i would n't really call 1700 's china dominant , i would go a bit earlier than that , 1600 's maybe , before europe became so dominating . 
  they do not come close in any way to the power projection of the us , neither do they desire it . 
  excuse me ? 
  they did n't `` invade '' mali , they deployed a few hundred soldiers by request from the government to repel the brutal islamic fanatics trying to take over the country . 
  nah i got it , i just wanted to tell you guys how awful our army is . 
  you would probably win , no need to surrender , our army is a complete joke . 
  sorry , i misread . 
  azerbaijan is more than twice as large and has more than three times as many inhabitants ... 
  no , it is illegal to protest in many western countries . 
  the funny thing is that a popular demonstration demanding more freedom , tax cuts or something could be described in the exact same way in many western countries . 
  re-read my comment but substitute byzantine with eastern roman . 
  because those areas were truly part of the byzantine heartland . 
  why not both ? 
  9 % of the us gdp is n't exactly minor in any situation . 
  i would n't call canadas gdp a `` small number ... 
  they have the eleventh highest gdp in the world , just under russia . 
  better trade , lol . 
  you will further distance yourselves from the largest economic entity in the world . 
  i 'm not saying in large scale . 
  but since norway i right on the border to sweden it 's not wrong to assume that at least a few thousand people born there have moved to sweden the last few decades . 
  i know i was wrong but i 'm just saying the amount of african/arab/middle eastern is n't as high as people think . 
  the fact that there 's just 5 % muslims is quite telling . 
  that 's not a huge amount really , a decent amount of the non eu born people are norwegian too . 
  no it is n't , a large part of those are finns and people from the balkans which have integrated really well . 
  for reference , there are roughly 5 % muslims in sweden . 
  the vast majority . 
  only a small part of those 20 % have come recently from syria and somalia as refugees , most are either finns or from the balkans . 
  i literally could not are less about the joke you did . 
  i honestly think almost every possible combination of words would offend me more . 
  joking about you being part of the ottoman empire is not worse than spitting on someones parents grave for fucks sake . 
  you can joke about anything . 
  i hope you are trolling . 
  modern macedonia has ** nothing ** to do with historical macedonia . 
  i was clearly talking about the growth during the industrial revolution , not the larger period including the time before and after . 
  i said `` just look at the difference between 1820 and 1913 . '', 
  you are right about africa but european growth was exceptional . 
  just look at the difference between 1820 and 1913 . https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_population_estimates, 
  lol ? 
  they have the perfect climate . 
  europe surpassed africa in population during the industrial revolution . 
  `` it 's true that a recent report by three u.n. agencies said nearly 239 million in africa are hungry , a figure some 20 million higher than four years ago . 
  and recent crises in the horn of africa and sahel certainly highlight the desperate uncertainties of food supply for millions -- malnutrition still cuts deep scars into progress on health and education . 
  but the africa progress panel and many others believe that africa has the potential not only to feed itself , but also to become a major food supplier for the rest of the world consider , for example , africa 's agricultural land . 
  according to an influential recent analysis , africa has around 600 million hectares of uncultivated arable land , roughly 60 percent of the global total . '', 
  ** slams **, 
  studying some histology before i play laserdome with a few friends . 
  what do you mean ? 
  get some cute little ducks , 
  thank you , your comment both warms and saddens my heart . 
  you sound intelligent too , if you intend to move from poland i would be honored if you moved here . 
  that 's a nice reply . 
  i do n't agree with you completely but you make some good points . 
  sorry for being rude . 
  oh right , i thought it was all refugees . 
  sorry if i sounded judgemental . 
  moldavia has just 3 million inhabitants and is the poorest country in europe by quite a bit . 
  christianity is the largest religion and the estonian culture and values is in many ways connected to christianity since it has been present in their history for centuries . 
  it 's the same with all cultures really . 
  indian culture is affected by hinduism and japanese by shinto . 
  no one is asking you to take in an unlimited number of imigrants ... stop being so fucking sensationalistic and scared just because a tiny amount of people settle in your country . 
  it 's not like 200 poor people imigrating to a country of millions a year is going to have an affect on the country , just admit that you are a racist and do n't want dirty syrians in your country . 
  8000 people over three years ... ? 
  that is almost as pathetically low . 
  you could literally do that more than 1875 years and still only reach norway current population . 
  i 'm not advocating taking in as many as we do ( it 's a bit too many honestly ) but we really should be splitting the ones coming to europe more evenly for better integration . 
  the richer countries could even subsidise with some money . 
  why the hell would fourth generation immigrants feel alienated and torn between two cultures ... ?
