  would you rather fight 50 chechenya sized rusias or one russia sized chechenya ? 
  almost everything you said is true but they are ** definitely ** nationalists . 
  being a nationalist is n't automatically bad though so i 'm not saying they are evil although i 'm not too fond of their somewhat unsettling party members . 
  is n't 1101 1 +2 +8 since the first position represents 1 , the second 2 , the third 4 and the fourth 8 ? 
  edit : i think i just understood . 
  do you write binary `` backwards '' ? 
  but we truly do not need one , there is absolutely no chance anyone will attack us honestly . 
  but if we join nato it would be nice if we contributed a bit at least in peacekeeping , logistics and other actions, 
  we honestly do n't need a strong army no one is ever going to attack us this century , not even russia . 
  lol ? 
  we would bring zero risk of getting attacked and at least contribute some small amount of military force . 
  it 's not like the rest of nato has to give us equipment or anything . 
  if sweden joins nato there is zero chance of russia attacking us and the only difference would be a slightly strengthened nato . 
  you do now that 's there 's only a handful countries in nato which spends the required amount right ? 
  the vast majority in nato spend less than they are supposed to . 
  no it wo n't , barely any of the nato countries spend the required amount on their militaries . 
  yes , it would be amazing if we wasted 1 % more of our gdp on a basically useless defence !, 
  if we join nato we would n't need to spend more money on our defence and if we do n't it wo n't matter how much we spend on defence . 
  it would be idiotic to base such asumptions on the simplistic information in the article . 
  experience , logistics , technology and power projection are extremely important . 
  it also completely avoids arguably more important factors such as experience , logistics ( which the us is ** extremely ** far ahead in ) , power projection and so on . 
  it 's honestly completely pointless without factoring in those . 
  did n't erdogan say he would activate the rules of engagement if russia violated turkeys airspace again ? 
  god you are stupid ... ( i 'm swedish ), 
  german industry and commerce is far superior than that of france/french africa , that 's arguably more important than french culture . 
  you wa n't censorship ? 
  because that 's how you get censorship . 
  not really , 1984 is pretty common knowledge . 
  and how exactly would they do that ? 
  the soviets already had millions of soldiers occupying the lands and there was no way in hell they would simply give them back since it was them who did the vast majority of the fighting against the germans . 
  do you not realize how incredibly many people would have died in a war between the allies and soviets ? ', 
  the number would doubtlessly reach several million . 
  perhaps even more than the soviets lost on the east front in cause the allies fight fiercely enough . 
  traitorous piece of shit . 
  were they supposed to continue fighting and get steamrolled by the enormous soviet army while japan still had not surrendered ... ? 
  i 'm also trying to think this way . 
  if we ditch the uk and us , heavily reduce immigration ( after trump guts all us climate deals there will be countless millions of climate refugees in the comming decades ) and focus on european nationalism we might live through this . 
  the country as a whole does not have particularly cold winters , specific areas are irrelevant . 
  my point is that it 's a bit silly to write `` cold winters '' when they actually just have `` winters '' . 
  `` cold '', 
  lol do you honestly believe russia are capable of occupying norway by just driving south along the coast ... ? 
  their supply lines would be extremely vulnerable , bridges and tunnels would be destroyed and the defenders would have a tremendous advantage . 
  you think china is going to move millions of soldiers and tens of thousands of vehicles across siberia ? 
  poland, 
  you should re read what i wrote , you missed a pretty importnat part . 
  my point was that if all the money was distributed equally and there was some parallel universe with an economy just like ours ( before the money was redistributed ) where we could spend our money we would on average be better of . 
  this is probably a really shitty explanation of what i meant tough . 
  not really , everyone would be reltively well of if all the money was distributed equally . 
  edit : of course the economy would collapse but if the wealth everyone got was able to be used in our current uncollapsed economy everyone would be well off because there is such a big concentration in the top percent . 
  dude , ukraine is n't going to perform some massive offensive in donbass with these weapons , they are almost certainly meant to dissuade further offensives by the rebels/russia towards kharkiv/mariupol . 
  lol, 
  except this will create less war since russia will be less likely to invade . 
  i also agree france would be a better choice , italy could be nice as well . 
  they hit a base which the saa had just retaken , the us thought isis still held it . 
  isis but the saa recently took control of the area they were planning to bomb . 
  the us even informed russia beforehand that they would bomb the area but apparently there was som miscommunication which understandably happens from time to time ( russia has even bombed the saa several times ) . 
  it 's a deterrent , of course we ca n't defeat the entire russian army . 
  `` if russia wanted to invade one of the baltic states they would need to control gotland because of its location . '', 
  that 's not even remotely true , they could take them in a ground invasion in a day or two . 
  no he would probably like that . 
  forever . 
  they have always been greek and will always be greek . 
  are you trolling or are you just competely unaware of what constitutes a superpower ? 
  most are economic refugees from africa and other parts of the middle east . 
  this is a real pizza . 
  except turkey is saying they are going to attack the ypg and have already shelled them ... 
  no they did n't . 
  i guess we got used to winning all the time . 
  do you really think germany cares ? 
  https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/4a/66/cc/4a66cca3cd01e3b2e597056bc6d61181.jpg those guys were pretty badass , but i guess it 's just a matter of taste who you prefer . 
  the middle easts hatred for russia is growing each time they bomb a hospital in syria or burn residental houses with incendiary bombs . 
  `` remember , when you invite us in we 're there for the long haul and we will use your nation as a resource for our foreign interventions . '', 
  regular hussars are badass as well , they do n't need that fancy metal armor . 
  why do you think so ? 
  it was recognised as a minority language a long time ago ( along with yiddish , finnish , sami and me\u00e4nkieli ) to preserve its cultural heritage . 
  would it be better if languages simply disappeared ? 
  because it 's correct ? 
  i would be just as bothered if russia suddenly claimed they were in fact decendants from the gauls and started builing monuments depicting vercingetorix in moscow . 
  why do you have to lie ? 
  they are not occupied , they want us soldiers to be there and they are free to change the constitutuion if they wish . 
  and that explains why the coup was launched at 21:30 on a friday when everyone was awake , why only a single tv station was shut down while the rest kept talking about the coup and why erdogan lied about almost getting killed by a rebel plane when the greek airforce says there was n't any planes at all near erdogans plane ? 
  the coup is abaolutely perfect for erdogan to consilidate power and getting closer to his newfound friend putin which he is doing very rapidly right now . 
  soon he will probably force the other nato assets away from incirlik airbase and let russia operate there instead . 
  are you joking ? 
  turkey has interacted far more with europe than kazakbstan historically . 
  if they claimed otherwise they would be jailed like the rest ... 
  he said lie . 
  stop posting this garbage , it is n't any proof at all . 
  for your own sake stop believing regime propaganda . 
  easier in some ways since it 's pretty hard to do amphibious invasions , a few missiles can do tremendous damage . 
  it 's much easier to blitzkrieg tons of tanks by land . 
  source ? 
  skulls, 
  it doese n't sounds as bad in swedish . 
  chineese threats are laughable as well . 
  yes i am sure germany would do nothing if russia invaded their neighbor and close trading partner and risk having russian tanks on their border in case the poles lost . 
  no it did n't , they are not part of nato or the eu . 
  if russia tried the same thing in let 's say poland they would be curb stomped . 
  nice whataboutism m8 . 
  shit are you sure ?
