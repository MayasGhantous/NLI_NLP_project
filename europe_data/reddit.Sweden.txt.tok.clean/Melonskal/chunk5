  i really thought his post would bring them back !, 
  also , afganistan is n't in the middle east either . 
  they are mostly fighting fsa/nusra . 
  finland was an essential part of the swedish heartland for centuries and has hundreds of thousands swedish speakers while it was only part of russia roughly a century and was quite autonomous . 
  the far eastern parts may be more influenced but the more populated southwest definitely is far more `` swedish '' . 
  sweden also modernised and prospered mostly in the post war era and finland is n't very russian influenced at all , they are far more like us swedes . 
  i hope you keep your word , i will remind you if it turns out they are n't muslim . 
  finland is pretty similar to us and they have recieved much less immigrants . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate sweden : 0.9 finland :1.6, 
  `` obama 's campaign rhetoric changed over night after us generals gave him a dose of reality . '', 
  and why he is completely unqualified to be the leader of the most powerful country in the world . 
  yes they would unless they want to instantly lose their influence and hegemony over most of the earth . 
  trump doese n't seem like the kind of guy that changes his mind when presented with advice though . 
  except they had lancers and plenty of `` europeans '' had horse archers as well . 
  if they are attacked you really should unless you want taiwan to be occupied within weeks . 
  hungarians are not related to huns . 
  no shit , still doese n't make him even a bit french juat like caesar isnt italian and hanibal is n't tunisian . 
  he also is n't french ... 
  erdogans islamic militia will keep the military in check . 
  this is not about `` offending '' anyone , it 's about being correct . 
  with your logic you might as well say he is a member of the knights templar . 
  except isis is n't involved in these attacks , the people doing these attacks are just sympathizing with them and isis claims responsibility to appear strong and attract more jihadists . 
  they did n't work 18 hours a day on the fields . 
  donbass is n't worth much anymore since it has been bombed and neglected to a mess . 
  there is plenty of oppurtunity to invest in kiev and the western regions of ukraine that are safe from russia . 
  it 's our ripped and rich friend which has our back even though he has some strange views . 
  probably a better answer . 
  because prussia . 
  there is more to being a superpower than just conquering a bunch of land quickly . 
  superpowers have extensive power projection across the entire world and usually have a robust and powerful economy which the germans completely lacked since it was constantly on the verge of collapsing , only fueled by their conquests and pillaging . 
  yes it was , it 's pretty obvious . 
  though i am not denying that the majority probably supports hillary anyway . 
  nazi germany wasnt a superpower , they could n't really project power abroad that well . 
  the british empire is arguably the first real superpower . 
  the democratic vote was rigged though , millions of people in pro bernie areas who had recently registered were mysteriously wiped . 
  denmark/norway perhaps . 
  of course it will take time but as time goes their larger population will give them tbe edge . 
  just like india will surpass the us sometime in the future . 
  they have far more people and are bound to surpass the uk sometime . 
  gdp per capita . 
  just gdp shows how economically powerful the country is . 
  the us would launch a tremendous amount of nukes within a few minutes after russia launched theirs . 
  in what way des that support that they were under 18 and lived in an asylum home ? 
  source ? 
  i would love if all eu countries paid some money for a proper coast guard in the mediterranean . 
  priceless, 
  literally no one is suggesting that there should be a crimea style referendum . 
  if you agree that they can have another referendum with the approval of westminster i honestly do n't understand why we are still debating . 
  they agreed to be part of the uk when it was in the eu , a large reason stated to remain was that spain would veto them joining the eu . 
  now they voted with a large majority to remain in the eu but england and wales pulled them away from it . 
  the situation is completely different compared to the last referendum and there is absolutely no violation of democracy if they get the express their will again . 
  the uk they voted to remain a part of doese n't exist anymore . 
  why would it be unlawful ... ? 
  i never once claimed they would just hastily perform a crimea style referendum and then leave in a few days while they and the eu laughs maniacally . 
  also why would the other voters matter in any way ? 
  it 's the scottish people who decide if they want to be independent . 
  the english , welsh and northern irish who voted on the eu membership are irrelevant to scotlands independence . 
  i ca n't comprehend why you would accuse me of not liking democracy when i wa n't the scottish people to have another chance to reconsider after there has been such a massive change to the circumstances and they obviously greatly prefered to stay in the eu . 
  wut , how the hell has n't it changed when the last referendum was when britain was n't going to leave the eu and this next one will be when britain has left the eu ? 
  the scottish people voted with a very large margin to remain in the eu . 
  how the hell is another referendum not democratic ? 
  the situation now is completely different from when the last scottish referendum was and it 's completely fair for the scottish people to get a say again . 
  why do you assume the only other option is to let them drown ? 
  if they are transported back to libyia ( similarly to how australia does things ) they are going to stop trying to cross eventually . 
   they also decided to remain in the uk , on a much higher turnout . 
  that 's abolutely irrelevant since that was when they were part of the eu ... 
  what a relevant argument ... 
  what the fuck ? 
  what ? 
  to me it seems like he would be representing the malteese people better if the listeners understood what he said . 
  but if there is n't any translator avalible it just seems silly . 
  you are catalonian right ? 
  wikipedia claims that the catalan language has 4.1 million speakers and 5.1 million secondary speakers . 
  if you go by native speakers it 's not bigger than any scandinavian country ( also smaller than finnish ) and would be smaller than czech , greek , slovakian , bulgarian etc. 
  and of course the larger languages . 
  even if you include the secondary speakers swedish , czech , greek , romanian and the major languages is till larger than catalan . 
  i agree that the catalan language should be regarded higher in the eu though . 
  it 's not bigger than most recognized languages . 
  why ... ? 
  i am deeply ashamed to be part of the eu right now . 
  it 's not `` solely for feelgood reasons '' you idiot ... 
  ** partly ** based on finnish . 
  honestly i am very surprised a beautiful girl like her was bullied to such an extent . 
  your appearance is extremely important for how people act towards you . 
  can you disrespectful pieces of shits shut the fuck up with this rethoric all the time ? 
  my countrymen died and were torn apart by a psychopath show some fucking respect . 
  i 'm a very calm person but you really piss me of . 
  sweden is far from flat . 
  sure it is n't full of mountains like norway but there are lots of hills and also mountains further north . 
  to be more specific , the specific region between the lakes is called skaraborg , my birthplace , 
  well briefly it could yeah but it would not be able to hold out very long in a total war scenario . 
   bare in mind that ireland back in the 1840s was half the population of england source ? 
  the greek genocide was perpretated by muslim slavers ? 
  he is talking about the 20th century idiot . 
  did i say otherwise ? 
  i am just enlighening you that you have to be english to defend `` their '' language . 
  you are talking about making esperanto the language of the eu , that would have to mean people stop learning english since two languages of that dignity ca n't coexist at the same status . 
  except english is ** the ** language that most people on the continent can speak and does a fantastic job of uniting us . 
  it 's absolutely incredible to be able to speak to so many people when traveling around europe . 
  english is a very european language .
