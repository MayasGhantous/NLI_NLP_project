  there are plenty of non english people who are defensive . 
  i am hugely in favor of english rather than esperanto and i frankly get pissed of that some idiots want to throw away this wonderful language that unites so many and has made such huge contributions to trade and science just because they do n't want a country to have an `` advantage '' . 
  correction , it has an ** extremely ** small cultural pull compared to all other languages on earth except for those spoken by isolated indian tribes in the jungles of south america . 
  `` anglo crowd '' ? 
  i am swedish and it 's absolute ridiculous to try and make esperanto take over from english when english is already so extremely established and influential across europe and the world . 
  no that 's the greatest strength of democracy and is the most important foundation of it . 
  the problem is uninformed/stupid voters who do n't know what is best for them . 
  why would a putin shill mock wilders ... 
  uh that describes me pretty well , i guess i do n't exist then . 
  i absolutely blame swedes who hate finns , there just is n't as many as you make it seem like . 
  and one man born in 1836 is representative of all swedes ? 
  should jews still hate germany because they used to exterminate them ? 
  i agree that it 's a bit weird to express their opinion about it . 
   that might be true , but nowadays you regard us drunken violent hicks , like the bunch of arrogant racists you are sure , keep believeing that . 
  it 's your decision if you want to make up reasons to hate us baselessly . 
  i feel a strong kinship with the other fennoscandian peoples and especially the finns because of our shared history . 
  i 'm saddened by people like you who spread hate between us . 
  yes that a horrible and wasteful practice that definitely deserves critique . 
  well that 's a huge exageration , why exactly do you hate sweden so much ? 
  `` colonial overlord '' , really ? 
  finland was an integral part of sweden and we regarded you as citizens not just some backwater colony . 
  and there is absolute a a difference in swedish and finnish drinking culture , it 's incredibly ridiculous that you would deny it like it would be some thing bad . 
  to a very small extent but he is bullshitting and exagerating massively . 
  doctors do it because they are in hospitals where patients may have contagious diseases and some patients may have a bad immune system for several reason and thereby get infected when in contact with the doctor . 
  sure it might decrease the chance of getting an infection by 0.1 % but it 's not exactly vital to wash your hands after just peeing if you are healthy . 
  you are not forced to be religious though so i do n't quite agree . 
  no whats bothering me is that you make it seem like europe as a whole wants to get out of nato which is incredibly far from the truth . 
   the opposite of religion is individual liberty wut ? 
  what the actual fuck is wrong with those psychopaths . 
  this genuinely makes me furious , the disrespect is palpable . 
  yeah hitler was a fun dude . 
  `` near future '' , immigrated muslims have only ** slightly ** higher birth rates on average , this is a very common myth that people use . 
  also the number of muslims in europe gets heavily skewed by countries like russia , bosnia , albania and bulgaria where they have lived several hundred years already . 
  the sun ( literally ) doese n't set on the brittish empire . 
  \u00c5bo . 
  ftfy, 
  completely irrelevant . 
  rekt . 
  the problem is that the turks are allowed to campaign here . 
  try doing the same with christianty then . 
  that 's the shittiest argument i have ever seen . 
  i sure am glad i live in sweden ... 
  if the police hurt you without reason there is something very rotten in your country . 
  there is no reason whatsoever for an ordinary citizen to be afraid of the police . 
  it 's incredibly important that there is trust and respect between the police and the citizens . 
  so the only thing stopping you from throwing rocks at the police is fear of them killing you ? 
  no wonder turkey is in such a state . 
  the fuck ? 
  why would it he good to be afraid of the police ? 
  lol, 
  it is n't , the russians must have forgotten that the french unlike them do n't hate gays . 
  they have tried to make it seem like he is gay . 
  what 's wrong with the caucasus ? 
  http://www.mrwallpaper.com/wallpapers/landscape-georgia.jpg the grand canyon is n't automatically the most beautiful piece of nature in the world just because it 's unique , i just do n't like it that much and find it incredibly overated . 
  aurora borealis , many norwegian fjords , the wide wyoming landscape , the caucasus , african savanah etc. 
  there are many things i find ore beautiful than the grand canyon and i know it 's subjective so you do n't have to agree . 
  your nature ? 
  your contributions to science ? 
  the fact you were one of the first democracies ? 
  the enormous output of culture like books and movies which have impacted the entire world massively ? 
  he certainly is . 
  you think the us is more free than western europe ? 
  kek . 
  well yeah , plenty of stuff is more beautiful . 
  til ukraine is in nato and the eu . 
  macron is a copy of hollande ... ? 
  that 's exactly what they do as members of nato . 
  but trump never claimed this he just misremembered what he saw on fox and made it seem like there had been a specific incident the night before . 
  well of course there were fewer people but `` major towns were what we would consider mere villages today ... '' is not true at all for some places , at least with my definition of `` village '' . 
  for example even londinium ( modern day london ) in the backwater province of britain had a decent population of around 50 000 people in 200 ad . 
  sure thats not a lot but i would not call it a village . 
  no not really , that depends on which part of the world you are reffering to . 
  uh no ? 
  mississippi reminds you of the rh\u00f4ne , 
  if france leaves the eu we should reboot it with germany , benelux , the nordics poland , the baltics and czechia . 
  we are the greatest already . 
  holy shit this is one of the worst maps i have ever seen . 
  the finnish culture is not closer to fucking sami than it is to swedish and bretagne is not closer to scotland and ireland than they are to the rest of france for the love of god . 
  thanks dude , i needed a good laugh today . 
  it was the fact that the us were able to completely and utterly defeat a country so far away so incredibly fast and with very low losses . 
  it really shows the immense power projection capabilites they have . 
  i 'm asking why we should have shut them down a long time ago . 
  the us is and has been extremely important for europes defense and them having a few bases here has done literally no harm . 
  it would be foolish to throw out a nato partner like that . 
  uh why ? 
  assume you mean 1800 and 1900 since neither italy nor nationalism existed in 800 . 
  grad, 
  he actually succeeded but the loss of moscow did n't really impact the russians who had burnt or taken away all the supplies there . 
  it 's completely irrelevant if 0.001 % of the european population was black back then . 
  you mean the aggressively cold russian winter ? 
  i ca n't stop laughing at your comment , i 'm way too tired to respond to anything you just wrote though . 
  that is tribalism . 
  i 'm sorry but there 's something very pretentious about brit 's claiming they are n't european even though have been just as involved and active in it 's history as spain and france . 
  i really do n't get why you so passionately want to distance yourselves from the rest of us ? 
  we are family . 
  literally nobody has evented hinted that it would be wrong . 
  not most of it 's history , nationalism is relatively new . 
  huh ? 
  it was independent before gaul was conquered . 
   i have no idea what this is referencing .
