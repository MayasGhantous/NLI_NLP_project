  when launching the hubble space telescope the engineers forgot to compensate for the shape change in the lense due to the 0 g environment . 
  tvey had to bring up another lens to the telescope . 
  the space based infrared system went $ 10000000000 over budget and one of the satellites shut down completely 7 seconds after reaching orbit rendering it useless . 
  all space agencies constantly have to face problems and failures . 
  but that does n't mean they 're not useful or not doing a good job . 
  failures are expected since we 're literally talking about rocket science . 
  what ? 
  of course nasa accomplishes more if they 've got a budget 3x the size of the esa . 
  this is exactly what i 'm saying . 
  how can you compare nasa and the esa in the way you 're doing while completely ignoring that one of them has way more resources and experience to work with than the other ? 
  nasa having more successful missions under its belt might have something to do with it being older and having a budget 3x that of esa ? 
  then why are you complaining ? 
  you 're still free to use them . 
  this is so unlucky . 
  i really hope that germany can make renewable resources work really well . 
  because depending on how the interview goes that 's the next step . 
  it 's rifles for hunting . 
  it 's not uncommon for hunters to have a few . 
  why would it be better if the conscripts had their weapons at home ? 
  it would prevent the army from using these weapons while the conscripted are not there . 
  it would also make it harder to organize them in case of war as you have to find the people with the right weapons for each task instead of just distributing the weapons in the army where they 're needed . 
  and in case of war it 's not like people/conscripts with guns can just rush to the frontlines with their guns to duke it out with the russian army . 
  they still have to be called in and assigned . 
  then they get weaponry depending on their assignment . 
   allegedly sweden could not grant any extradition guarantees since it would have to come from the government . 
  the government is not allowed to get involved in the justice system which is why it could n't give any guarantees on how the court would rule ** if ** an extradition request were to come from the us . 
  the prosecutor tried coming to london to meet assange but could n't because there was no agreement between equador and sweden iirc . 
  once they had an agreement the agreement said that all questions had to be asked by an equadorian lawyer . 
  the swedes could watch but not participate . 
  and they could n't do * anything * without assange consenting to it . 
  including formally charging him . 
  handing them out to who ? 
  civilians ? 
  you do not understand what access to the single market means in this context . 
  what ? 
  just by reading the headline you can see this is not the case . 
  i can not fathom how you 'd come to this conclusion . 
  the eu will restrict visas for the citizens of the countries that refuse to take back ** their own ** citizens after they 've been denied asylum in europe . 
  we 're talking about countries such as nigeria and afghanistan if you still do n't get it . 
  what ? 
  explain how this is holding people hostage . 
  minimum wage is negotiated between the unions and the employers in each profession . 
   why is the eu trying to force an economic meltown over spite ? 
  this is news to me . 
  source please . 
  we had the same thing here in \u00d6rebro , sweden for a couple of months earlier in the summer due to our water reservoirs being at historically low levels . 
   heightened focus on security and defence spending . 
  do you honestly think this is because of the refugee crisis ? 
  what unelected bureaucrats are you talking about ? 
  the parliament is directly elected by the people . 
  the president of the european commission is elected by the parliament and the commissioners can be denied by parliament . 
  the council of europe is is made up of different ministers from the me member states . 
  so we 've got the parliament which would be the us congress , the commission which would be the executive branch and the council which is closest to the senate . 
  in what way is this completely undemocratic ? 
   the better part of scandinavia . 
  you 're not even part of the scandinavian peninsula !, 
  we even built a pity bridge to connect you lot . 
  yes in retrospect i 'll have to agree . 
  i just thought it was weird how they used the word `` uppvaktat '' instead of `` jagat '' or `` n\u00e4rmat '' in the original article and so i decided to keep it weird . 
  that 's the word used in the statement . 
  ** swedish surveillance aircraft courted by russian fighter ** during a flight in international airspace above the baltic sea a swedish surveillance aircraft of the type 102b was courted by a russian fighter of the type su-27 . 
  it 's not uncommon for russian aircraft to go up and identify swedish surveillance missions . 
  this time however the russian aircraft acted in a way that has to be seen as remarkable . 
  among other things the distance between the 2 aircrafts was very short at some moments . 
  f\u00f6rsvarsmakten has reported the incident to the government offices . 
  the department of foreign affairs will be calling the russian ambassador . 
   they \u00b4 re capacity  bellow  braging  pretensious . 
   i say hi and they just ignore me all the time . 
  yeah we just do n't talk to people . 
   kiruna , sweden is the largest city in the world by area . 
  it was the largest municipality in the world until it was overtaken by 2 australian once because they merged . 
  how would we find out what country has paperwork on their citizenship ? 
  lol wtf are you on about ? 
  different countries has different laws . 
  any member state can enact whatever law it wants to as long as it 's not condratictory to any eu law . 
  the eu laws being above the national laws is an obvious necessity . 
  the eu has said that they want to make the euro attractive enough so that the remaining members will join by their own free will in 2025 . 
  they 've explicitly stated that they 're not looking to force anyone into the euro . 
  ~ ~ \u00d8resund bridge ~ ~ ** \u00d6resund bridge ** ftfy, 
  they can say what they would like the eu to do as a block . 
  if the uk joined the other nations in the eea would lose a lot of say in their common stance as the uk is so much bigger than any of the current members . 
  lol you 've not read the article . 
  seriously . 
  point out when labour was ahead in the last [ few weeks . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_polling_for_the_united_kingdom_general_election,_2017 ), 
  where was labour shown as ahead in the last few weeks ? 
  where will all the dutch 30-0 year olds go ? 
  din sol, 
  would n't you technically pay less if you joined as you 'd get more money back from the eu ? 
  ~ ~ expands ~ ~ ** expanderar ** fd\u00c5d, 
  stormaktstid intensifieras, 
  there are 500 million people in the eu . 
  if the refugee situation had been handled better by all countries europe could 've easily taken 1/500th of it 's population in refugees . 
  who are these `` worst polluters '' that are n't in on the agreement ? 
  the only big polluter that 's not in is the us . 
  being royal does n't have anything to do with power though . 
  if you 're a king , queen , prince or princess you 're royalty . 
  afaik donald trump is in no way royalty . 
  it 's currently about 25 degrees in \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland . 
  his comment history is mostly english with a few swedish comments .
