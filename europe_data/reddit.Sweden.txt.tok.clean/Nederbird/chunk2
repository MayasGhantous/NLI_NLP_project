  i hate it whenever they ( the jews , at least in this case ) are harassed due to their heritage or attacked for something they did n't do ; they 've already had enough of that already , as a people . 
  i hate it whenever somebody thinks they can bring with them the conflict they escaped and live out their hatreds here . 
  i also hate it when those same idiots are treated as if they 're some statistic representative of their group , to the detriment of everyone else in that group . 
  i just wish it 'd all stop , but i know it wo n't and that just makes me so frustrated . 
  while that might be a possible explanation for the small number of actual cases , it still does n't explain why the guy in the shawarma joint was targeted by only one guy and not a whole lot of other arab muslims ( assuming they frequent such restaurants ) along with him , or how he was even served in the first place , assuming that the ones running the place were muslims as well . 
  really , most muslims , like most people in general , have way better/more important things to do than harassing random jewish people . 
  in that case , thanks for clarifying that . 
  did n't know they were concentrated in different cities . 
  i never said it did . 
  while i 'm entirely about this , i get the feeling that this is n't as much of a problem with muslim immigrants as with palestinian ones specifically . 
  my reasoning is that had this been a problem with muslims in general , we 'd probably see ** a lot more ** than just 37 cases of harassment , while the guy in the shawarma restaurant would probably have faced half-a-dozen raging people instead of merely one , single guy pulling the star from his neck . 
  also , aside from openly rabid islamists , nazis and possibly far-leftists ( which are neither that many nor that brazen ) , the only ones i 'd imagine getting pissed off by jewish/israeli symbols to that degree would be palestinians , due to them associating it with israel and its palestine policy and thus everything bad that goes with it . 
  do you have any article about the subject ? 
  i 'd very much like to read it if there is . 
  ** finland : ** korpiklaani and finntroll . 
  ** estonia : ** metsat\u00f6ll . 
  ** germany : ** equilibrium . 
  ** uk : ** alestorm . 
  ** russia : ** arkona and the red army choir . 
  ** france : ** yann tiersen . 
  do n't know if i can say ** hungary ** , but if i can , then i 'll also add thy catafalque to that list . 
  does n't surprise me . 
  with 68 years of social democratic government , it feels like a given that such views would become mainstream . 
  there 's a marked pro-palestinian bias in sweden , though the degree of strength varies a lot depending on where you look . 
  also , does n't mean everybody blindly support palestine , most do n't , even if you 'll find many who do . 
  like the article says , it 's not as much due to any dislike of jews as much as the policy of the state of israel , especially its colonialist tendencies . 
  the thing about russia does n't surprise me either . 
  aside from being historical enemies ( which would be the least of any reason ) , there 's the government , crime rate , corruption and the pervasive nationalism . 
  that more people like the us than however the eu , however , is mightily surprising . 
  hell , i did n't think any of them would get over 50 % . 
  still , this is a very red country ( red as in socialist , not conservative ) mentality-wise . 
  even the right wing parties have adopted a number of red policies to varying degrees . 
  you 'll have to look and look really hard to find somebody who 's actually against the welfare state , which is why you wo n't find any party opposing it , as doing so would be tantamount to political suicide . 
  haha , awesome !, 
  that 's how i memorized the countries and capitals as well , though in my case it was superpower 1 . 
  ^ ^ 45/45 btw . 
  yeah , i think the definition for obesity is pretty exaggerated too . 
  i mean , i 've met a few pretty fat people down there , but the vast majority of the people i see are n't very different from the ones i see here or anywhere else in europe . 
  my mother , who 's from budapest , seems to think that obesity in hungary might be rural thing . 
  could there be any truth to that ? 
  haha , lots of times . 
  i 'm part hungarian myself , on my maternal side , and i always lots of food whenever i 'm down there visiting my relatives , but yeah , i know what you mean . 
  xd though that 's what the pickles are for , the acids balance out all the fat in the food , or at the very least , they make you feel better . 
  just wanted to thank everybody for the informative replies . 
  i know this is what upvotes are for , but i just wanted to convey gratitude in words as well . 
  no idea . 
  last time i was in hungary , i did n't notice ** that ** many fat people . 
  then again , i was mostly in and around budapest . 
  then again , depends on what people call obesity . 
  when i hear obesity , i think of the sort people who can barely walk on their own . 
  we get ours from lebanon . 
  pretty much all middle eastern produce to be found here is from lebanon . 
  either that or it 's pakistan or turkey , though i do n't usually class those as middle eastern . 
  if you 've never heard of it before , then le mont-saint-michel in northern france is truly a must-see : it looks just like you 'd imagine one of those fairy tale castles to look , except this one 's authentic . 
  be sure to bring some sunscreen as well in case it 's still hot down there or you 're planning on going in the summer , i got quite burnt last time i was there . 
  it 's in northern france , roughly on the border between normandy and brittany . 
  rouen in upper normandy is also a really cozy place , with lots of medieval buildings left in the city centre , as well as holding one of the very few remaining non-religious buildings built in the gothic style : the local palace of justice . 
  there are a some really beautiful churches and cathedrals as well , france is full of them !, 
  unfortunately , i have n't been that much to germany , but n\u00fcrnberg was a rather cozy place , and the cathedral of k\u00f6ln ( cologne ) is something well worth seeing imo . 
  if you 're going in the near future , you might be able to get to the oktoberfest in m\u00fcnchen ( munich ) in time . 
  if you do get time over , i recommend trekking a bit farther east as well , like gda\u0144sk in poland , budapest in hungary and salzburg and wien ( vienna ) in austria . 
  some of the post-communist countries might be a bit shabby , but the old cities still retain their charm , and with all the restoration work going on over there , most of them have already regained much of their former beauty . 
  do bring some phrase books though , people with appreciate it a lot if you at least try to speak their language , at least outside germania . 
  nice !, 
  austria seemed pretty clever too , though to me it always looked like a humpbacked old man curled up and sleeping ... 
  i see your point and it 's a good one . 
  thanks !, 
  the point e 's trying to make , if i 've understood this correctly , is that a law like this would likely cause more harm than it would prevent , since the practice would go underground , which will most likely just cause more suffering in the form of botched operations in contrast to the regulated ones we have today . 
  now i 'm not at all in favour of pre-adult circumcision , or any other sort of body modification requested by the parent for eir child ( unless it 's on medical grounds ) , and i am in favour of the ban , but there is some merit to that argument . 
  if it causes more harm than it prevents and the perpetrators can not be apprehended and prosecuted , or at least not effectively enough to remedy the situation for which the law was created , then would n't legalization and strict regulation be the lesser evil ? 
  that 's true too . 
  the south swedish dialects of today were essentially east danish dialects of yesterday . 
  they 've then gradually been assimilated into what they are today , with only the bornholm dialect staying east danish . 
  the perceived ugliness of scanian swedish , however , i believe , is more attributed to r being realized as a voiced uvular fricative [ \u0281 ] rather than an alveolar flap [ \u027e ] as in the stockholm dialect and in standard swedish . 
  r is otherwise ( i think ) the single most variable phoneme in the entire swedish language . 
  there 's most likely some truth in that as well , though i 'd believe the question one of perspective . 
  if there is one thing i 've observed that seems constant in every language , it 's that people from capitals will usually look down upon other dialect , while everybody else will be bothered by the capital dialect . 
  like here , many stockholmers think we southern swedes sound ugly , many of us think they sound arrogant and condescending , thus we dislike each others dialects . 
  if seen the same thing hold true in countries ranging from britain in the west to japan in the east . 
  xd haha , well , we do n't exactly switch them in that manner ( we still say `` szeged '' instead of `` sz\u00f6ged '' ) , but we do switch them in some words yet , like `` f\u00f6l\u00f6sleger '' instead of `` felesleges '' , `` f\u00f6l '' in place of `` fel '' and `` sz\u00f6g '' in lieu of `` szeg '' . 
  as of yet , i have n't been able to discern or learn of a pattern to it , but i intend to find out . 
  i feel the same way , but the other way around . 
  we have an old szekler lady from sf\u00e2ntu gheorghe living downtown that we sometimes visit , and i was really confused the first time we visited her , like saying `` n\u00e9kem '' instead of `` nekem '' etc. 
  and yeah , the vegetables are the most confusing . 
  the one i best remember is `` paszuj '' for `` z\u00f6ldbab '' , could n't understand what it meant until i asked my parents who understood it from other languages , mom from russian `` fasol ' '' and dad from arabic `` fasuuliya '' . 
  haha , only with the family . 
  we substitute some hungarian words for swedish one , like `` soffa '' for `` kanap\u00e9 '' , `` saft '' instead of `` sz\u00f6rp '' and the like . 
  sounds very interesting !, 
  can you tell me more about the sounds ? 
  what does the \u00cb sound like , is it similar to any sound found in any other language ? 
  could you perhaps try and render it in ipa ? 
   usually , the only hungarian one gets to hear is what 's on television , and that 's the same as in the capital . 
  it 's fun to actually somebody who speaks differently !, 
  might also be that it fell out of use and was subsequently reintroduced by viking settlers . 
  i 'm from s\u00f6lvesborg , a small town in southern sweden in the province of blekinge , close to scania 's eastern border . 
  thus i speak west blekingian , which is characterized by : omitting the r sound after vowels , instead elongating the preceding vowel ; guttural rs when pronounced ; o is pronounced more like [ \u026au ] rather than [ u ] ; more danish and low german and/or high german words in our vocabulary ; [ e ] sometimes turns into [ i ] ; melody is a bit different , much more similar to english and german than to swedish proper ( sveam\u00e5l ) . 
  people from northernmore parts sometimes have trouble understanding us . 
  my hungarian ( my other native tongue ) is mostly similar to what 's spoken in budapest , i guess , with the difference that i sometimes substitute e for \u00d6 . 
  apparently , my mother was taught in school that they should do that in some words because \u00d6 supposedly sounds more beautiful than e. though i would n't claim that i sound like a typical budapester , at least not of my generation . 
  my hungarian is based more on that of my mother and maternal grandparents , rather than what 's heard on tv .
