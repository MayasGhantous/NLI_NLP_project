ah well atleast you do n't live in sweden where one of your ministers use the `` cry for the camera '' act to * maybe * change everyones mind on something . 
  really , my countrys politics and politicans , is insane and pathetic , the frustation of it has no roof it only goes up and up and up . 
  allah not ahkbar ? 
  man must be kinda great to live in a warm country like portugal , you get rich culture and old history ( roman ruins etc ) and you do n't have to worry about cold weather . 
  the bigger picture leans more toward support for isis than not . 
  your point being ? 
  look , erdogan is without a doubt supporting isis , together with saudi arabia , they ofcourse do n't want isis near them since isis is basicly a ball that is covered with sharp spikes , but they do want to steer isis to places where they get cake and advantage . 
  saudi arabia funds the wahabism that is needed for isis to recruit and come about , erdogan supports saudi arabia ( saudi royales ) and gets a slice of the cake too for that . 
  then there 's the useal fact that isis sells oil that they have taken over , to erdogan , for cheap . 
  honestly ? 
  yeah , kinda . 
  sweden the nation , took huge advantage of the war , we sold iron and wood , to every side , but stayed `` neutral '' . 
  lucky for us , the war ended just a few months before the rumored plan of hitler to take over sweden was going to start ( im not sure if it 's true , the plan i mean . ), 
  i would say that we were kind of like a northern version of italy . 
  germany then had `` allies '' to south and north . 
  they have n't spoken out against any of their connections with isis . 
  so i conclude that erdogan is okay with supporting them , i think he just wants more land from syria and a contineous stream of oil . 
  ofcourse erdogan would never publicly go out and say `` i support isis '' , that would n't look good would it ? 
  and he still hates the kurds and iraq . 
  `` indirectly '' not at all directly , 
  this is supporting them . 
  let 's move to australia . 
  bet they just saw public sex porno vids from czech , ca n't really blame their logic there . 
  i mean czech is basically porn-pro . 
  no russians = no dota/cs sad times ahead my friends, 
  let them suffer . 
  leftist retards and tumblr feminazis has sickened europe . 
  what the fucking fuck did you just say about my *** glorious *** europe ? 
  you . 
  you are funny hamburger . 
  i like that . 
  come my shildren !, 
  asumptions asumptions asumptions, 
  absolutely haram, 
  yes we can !, 
  fuck off , a fully whole europe is impossible . 
  europe is the continent that is the birthplace of great civilizations , whom are birthed from single nations . 
  and nations in europe will live on for a verry long time , beyond your death . 
  i hope eu stays as it 's supposed to be - a coorperation `` pact '' of many great nations that together aim to influence the rest of the world in econimic intressent , the good and the bad and the selfish and the manipulative way . 
  eu is not a failure , it 's just corrupted with impossible buerocrazy that makes anything practical a verry long process . 
  it needs to be more effective with a stronger voice , but right now it ca n't be . 
  no i fucking wouldnt . 
  they are muslim upperclass what do you think ? 
  its going to end with globalist vs nationalist , and the nationalist are always the greater and more in numbers . 
  i hope the current swedish extreme left gets crushed completely and nationalism secures swedens future . 
  i mean for fuck sake , the nations people first and foremost , not fucking `` refugees '' because your leftist ass ** feels ** its the right thing and calling it a human right . 
  it 's not a human fucking right to get to choose which country you can live off with the most welfare in it . 
  haha very recently as in 2years back ? 
  `` refugee salary '', 
  yes . 
  yes . 
  the majority isnt pro-immigrant , the majority doesnt have a say either . 
  seriously ? 
  no they really are n't, 
  `` child '' as in arabs that say that they are under 18 years old . 
  war . 
  gang wars . 
  it 's gona happen . 
  swedish intelligence s\u00c4po say that the situation is really bad because they really do n't know which of these immigrants could be a terrorist from isis , a sleeper agent or not . 
  all because people can ** lie ** . 
  typical brit bong . 
  inne-bandy f\u00f6r fan . 
  oh im sorry , i thought this was ` murica !, 
  for all we know , the survey could 've been done on aquintances of only about 100 people in each country , or facebook groups . 
  ugh it 's all a shity really messy situation !, 
  does n't look so bad honestly . 
  i expected bad , and worse . 
  how many people were surveyed ? 
  how was the survey done ? 
  telephone calls or online poll on hotmail ? 
  instructions unclear , i made pizza and pasta as a result . 
  if money should be spent on people in need in/from other countrys , it should be sent from country x to country z , ** basically helping the refugees on the spot ** instead of the refugees and immigrants that are enough fortunate and rich enough to travel through eu ( and on the way there , throw away their id papers ) and claim refugee status in selective country just because of welfare . 
  that is , in my opinion , much more humane . 
   why am i supposed to care more about `` my country and my countries people '' than about people in general ? 
  because you live in it ? 
  because you pay taxes . 
  your grandparents worked to make your country a better place , your parents probably the same , though it depends , where and when your parents and grandparents lived/live . 
  either way , the generous germany as we know today exists because of the people that worked for it . 
  and ofcourse as you are german , you too should work for a even better future for your children and childrens children in your country . 
  do you not like to work ? 
  i quite enjoy my work , i like to think that my taxes go to the beneficial of every swede in my country and my countrys infrastructure and well being . 
  but now it 's being used on people who have never worked or contributed to my country before , and they may never work back that welfare . 
  i am asumeing ofcourse that you , your parents , your grandparents , your grandparents parents are all german or have lived their majority of life in germany thereby contributeing to germany through taxes and work . 
  his naivity is what will make his future and his grandparents lives shit , why ? 
  because he wants to willingy give away his countrys money to the leechers of society that is the lieing illegal immigrants ( or as some call them `` refugees '' ) , all because it makes his morale bubble grow and.glow pink so he feels better in the stomach . 
  this shity humantarian attitude is playing with money that is meant for the country and that countrys people !, 
  and now its being given away to people who havent worked a day to deserve it !, 
  they are meant to stay in the first safe country they get to , not choose where they want to be so they can get a fat refugee salary as they call it . 
  morale should not go above the law , these refugees are illegal immigrants . 
  i dont agree with you at all . 
  sounds good, 
  no no !, 
  that would be racist and.nationalistisk !, 
  i do n't know , what was the last christian war ? 
  putin got balls compared to everyone else . 
  i wish we had politicians with balls in eu . 
  time for usa to use all that war money and save europe ( again ) . 
  well if you think about it , the cost of flying down the refugees in planes , would certainly still be smaller than the costs of welfare that they cost if they stay . 
  christianity is like 600 years older bro , ofcourse we have went through more war than islam . 
  christianity also has jewish and roman influence as it 's background , christians already knew about things like monarchys and democratics when it was being formed due to romans and greeks .
