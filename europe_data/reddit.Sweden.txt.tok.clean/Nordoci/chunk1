stuff grown locally will also need to be transported into the city with trucks . 
  heavy trucks are already restricted in most city centers . 
  but how would you transport wares without any trucks ? 
  * pizza afrikana * : banana , curry , peanuts , chicken toppings vary slightly depending on pizza place , but that 's the one my local one has . 
  never tried it myself due to those pesky pseudo-nuts and allergies , but it 's not entirely unpopular . 
  nowhere near as popular as kebab pizza though . 
  ( p.s. 
  do n't tell the italians about any of this d.s. ), 
  as op said , it 's the best map of * central/eastern europe * and * parts of asia * . 
  it 's clearly not the best map of northern europe , denmark 's on there . 
  to be pedantic they 've used the name since april 5th 1908 . 
  they could n't agree on a name and were known as svartb\u00e4ckens ik and ik spurt the first eight months before finally settling on sirius . 
  not like it changes anything you 've said , i 'm just a pedant . 
   in ice hockey both malm\u00f6 redhawks and fr\u00f6lunda indians are teams with that kind of name malm\u00f6 does , fr\u00f6lunda 's proper name is * fr\u00f6lunda hc * . 
  before they changed to that in 2004 it was * v\u00e4stra fr\u00f6lunda hc * . 
  * fr\u00f6lunda indians * is the official nickname they do use extensively , but technically it 's not their name . 
   i do n't follow soccer but it seems all the teams in europe are called `` city name - football club '' or generic sounding names like `` united '' good thing you have n't followed swedish football . 
  we had a team named ** athletic football club united ** ... last fall they did change to * afc eskilstuna * , which i suppose is a little better . 
   bk h\u00e4cken when i was young and immature we called them * rumporna * ( `` the butts '' ) and * r\u00f6varna * ( `` the arses '' / `` the robbers '' ) when we played them . 
  * beating * them in particular was of course also always a favorite . 
  for non-swedish speakers : `` h\u00e4cken '' ( `` the hedge '' ) is also a slang term for the buttocks and it did n't help that [ their logo looked like this ] ( http://svensktspel.nu/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/bk-h%c3%a4cken-logo.jpg ) . 
  i must admit i still only think of butts when i see their name mentioned . 
  it 's the same for swedish . 
  it 's just that * middag * was also used for the meal eaten at that time , the day 's * most important meal * . 
  when industrialization happened ( and our daily schedules ended up changing ) the evening meal usually ended up being the most important one and kept the name . 
  our `` middag '' can fall whenever you 're having the big meal , including the actual middle of the day , but for the most part that is in the evening . 
  it 's a bit confusing . 
  [ s\u00e1pmi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/s%c3%a1pmi ) is their cultural region . 
  no group advocates secession . 
  i 've never heard of anyone wanting independence , but there have been calls for increased cultural autonomy . 
  there are sami parliaments in sweden , norway and finland . 
  but their concerns are for preservation of sami culture and recognition of the sami people , not about independence or such . 
   was there ever some country like that in history ? 
  not really . 
  prior to the scandinavian countries expansions north people lived of the land without geopolitics or such . 
  but as we all now from history , the final solution is not the right answer . 
  also that union was shit . 
  it was essentially intended to be nato with a common foreign policy and the same elected figurehead . 
  only issue was that there were n't really any elections , we more often than not had different kings and occasionally went to war * against * each other . 
  what a disaster . 
  it was really just that kid bogus\u0142aw from poland we could agree on . 
  sweden-norway was on the other hand very successful . 
  we did n't go to war even once , not even when they felt like spreading their own wings . 
  would you be willing to change your alphabet and accept their proper names then ? 
  if yes , go ahead . 
  losing them is a sacrifice i 'd be willing to make to remove danish letters from the earth . 
  if no , there is [ another solution ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/norge-sverige-sildesalaten.svg/768px-norge-sverige-sildesalaten.svg.png ) . 
  [ of course ] ( https://youtu.be/fqgrc5sfcaq?t=23s ), 
  `` john smith '' is a better comparison of what a `` svensson '' is , than `` john doe '' . 
  even if doe sometimes encroaches on smith 's territory . 
  `` smith '' is a pretty common last name . 
  our placeholder name for unknown people or protected identities and such ( which `` john doe '' originally was intended for ) is `` n.n. 
  no different from any other . 
  interesting , i did not know that . 
  i 've never heard of an anglophone sven . 
  hmm , that sounds believable . 
  oh , i do n't know anything about that stuff . 
  i was n't super serious in my proposal ... :p but are you sure ? 
  they do have words like * svelte * . 
  and i mean svalbard is still svalbard . 
  you 're absolutely right , that is why . 
  it came to english from middle dutch through scots . 
  but since english pronounces v and w as it does , they should 've just changed it to v !, 
  i mean , they could 've called it `` sveden '' . 
  why would they put a ` w ' when we do n't have that ? 
  that 's like how the word for ` lisp ' always contains an s , just rude . 
  ca n't you be in a committed relationship without living together ? 
  and shacked up sounds less serious . 
  i do n't know , but they do n't really feel the same as ` sambo ' to me . 
  a ` sambo ' has additional legal rights and such , you 've just not signed a piece of paper . 
  but i do n't know . 
  pretty indifferent i guess . 
  honestly i do n't really see the difference between being married and just `` sambo '' ( people in a committed relationship who live together but are n't married ( what 's that called in english ? ) ) . 
  i know very few people of my parents and mine generation who are married . 
  to me it 's kind of something my grandparents generation and beyond did . 
  it was a neutral term when it was named , it being seen as a racist is a fairly recent development . 
  `` negerboll '' was the only term the swedish academy had for it until * chokladboll * was added in 2006 , and it was removed from saol only three years ago . 
  but yeah , calling it that today is a bit stupid . 
  technically it does n't qualify as chocolate so that name is a little weird too . 
  `` cocoa balls '' or something would probably be better . 
  i have not . 
   - `` tease the frenchman '' ( reta fransosen ) : to masturbate  - `` prussian order/discipline '' ( preussisk ordning/disciplin ) : perfect , strict order/discipline are those common where you 're from ? 
  i have literally never heard either in my life . 
  the nordics . 
  what is it ? 
  [ darth welder ] ( https://gfycat.com/graciousdirtyfossa ) . 
  i 'm not the biggest fan , but he 's * ok * . 
  he sometimes feels like a bit of a goof and i sometimes struggle with taking him seriously . 
  but he 's not malicious or anything , so it 's fine . 
  could be much worse . 
  sorry for the vague answer , i just listen to a lot of stuff i do n't understand and do n't really have any favorites . 
  i love finding new music and only speak three languages , so it 's not difficult to find stuff in other than those . 
   what i listen too mostly depends on my mood at that time . 
  sometimes i feel for finnish reggae like raappana , other times slow down with some icelandic fjallabr\u00e6\u00f0ur . 
  currently my spotify is playing hong jin young , a south korean trot singer . 
  yes . 
  plenty . 
  tomorrow : fancy with family , easter feast thing . 
  at least i think so , but i 'm not the host , so who knows ... ? 
  sunday : regular dinner , eric carmen style .
