  beautiful , made me think of `` absolute beginners '' ( the book , not the horrendous film ) . 
  am i the only one thinking about the positive currency effect on beer purchases in prague ? 
  i am really glad and a little proud that sweden has become the most generous country in europe when it comes to accepting refugees . 
  we are seeing the worst refugee situation in the world since the second world war . 
  today people here wish that sweden could have done more during wwii and looking back 50 years from now it will be great to know that sweden stod up and tried to ease the suffering of people fleeing for their lives , when most of europe turned to anti-immigration policies . 
  then again , we also have bigots and racists gaining foothold in parliament . 
  one of the soldiers in front is holding what looks like the swedish version of the german assault rifle heckler and koch g3 . 
  these were retired from the swedish armed forces in 1986 and later donated to estonia in the early 1990 's . 
  i guess they still work . 
  very, 
  hear , hear !, 
  bonfires are universal , all kinds of people come out to see them here in the stockholm suburbs and i do n't see how muslims would react any differently . 
  about 5 % of the population are muslims and i expect that most of them drink ( kurds , turks , bosnians etc ) . 
  that is the kind of european solidarity that i can get behind . 
  great pictures of the past . 
  the liz noonan campaign posters are from 1981 or 1982 , however . 
  family feuds here in sweden have been known to be started by mushroom pickers moving in on each others favorite spots . 
  the most popular mushroom is [ the chantarelle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chanterelle ) , it goes really well with wild game dishes . 
  it had plenty of rural charm . 
  [ related ?

  most state owned museums are in stockholm , but there are also a few ones in g\u00f6teborg , malm\u00f6 , link\u00f6ping , karlskrona and uppsala . 
  that is a good selling point . 
  you do have nice museums in the czech republic ( czechia ? 
  ) , only just last summer i visited [ the glorious bohumil hrabal museum in nymburk ] ( http://www.hrabal-nymburk.cz/index.php?stranka=muzeum ) and it was beautiful . 
  that is the downside , schools bring hordes of kids to museums and just dump them there for free entertainment and learning . 
  and all you old people should go to stockholm instead , where [ all state owned museums are admission free ] ( http://www.visitstockholm.com/en/see--do/guides/museums-with-free-entry/ ) . 
  not all swedes , i 'm leaving the city for the duration . 
  sweden dropped a few positions , mainly because of more threats being made against journalists . 
  most of these threats are made by right-wingers who think that media is too liberal . 
  sweden is the least anti-semitic country in the world according to the [ anti-defamation league ] ( http://global100.adl.org/#map/weurope ) . 
  a handful of incidents involving jews and palestinian immigrants in recent years have been used by those who want to describe sweden as a muslim state on the brink of failing . 
  israel has also played into this , in retaliation for sweden recognizing palestine . 
  it is a big deal to hate jews , not that i know that kaplan does . 
  it is not babysitting if it is your daughter , it is parenting . 
  i 'm sure you did n't mean it that way but too many fathers call it babysitting when they take care of their own kids while the wife is out . 
  i think most of them can be found [ here ] ( http://www.eriksberg.nu/en ) , the private wildlife park eriksberg near karlshamn . 
  kent brockman [ said it best ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5leydw2lsm ) . 
  the acting is better than in that other eagle 's nest film i saw . 
  the text states that the breed originated in the 1940 's , almost exactly 300 years after [ the treaty of br\u00f6msebro ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_treaty_of_br%c3%b6msebro_%281645%29 ) . 
  perhaps you mean the j\u00e4mthund , or the `` swedish elkhound '' ? 
  edit : funny when you think about it , denmark loses a war , norway loses a breed of dog . 
  [ complete bilingual ( swedish/english ) guide to the native swedish breeds of dogs ] ( http://www.skk.se/global/dokument/hundrasguiden/svenska-raser.pdf?epslanguage=sv ) . 
  almost all native breeds are hunting dogs . 
  i think the [ swedish vallhund ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_vallhund ) is the `` most swedish '' breed of dog , it has been around since the vikings . 
  these numbers are not particularly alarming , obesity levels range between about 15-25 % of the population in most european countries . 
  lithuania is at about the same level as germany . 
  the world 's only remaining lard-superpower beats us all with an impressive 35 % of the population obese . 
  what you propose is not rationality , it is dogmatism . 
  you do not want to understand the other perspective because it gets in the way of what you already know , or think you know . 
  it hinders you from `` doing the right thing '' , the thing that you already know is right . 
  i will , since you asked so nicely , explain empathic reasoning for you yet one more time , it is obviously needed . 
  empathic analysis is a scientific method , but in humanities , not physics . 
  we can both agree that physics have little to with human behavior ? 
  empathic analysis is , in short , a method in which you read a text , a letter let 's say , and try to put yourself in the place of the author . 
  there is nothing in the method that says that you need to like the author or that it is not ok to hurt his or her feelings . 
  ok , so reasoning becomes more rational for not understanding the point of view of the other ? 
  i would have sworn that rational arguments benefited from understanding both sides of an issue . 
  you still do not understand the word empathy , it has nothing to do with morals , it is about seeing things from the perspective of someone else . 
  no , and `` empathic '' is also not the same as `` nice '' , `` kind '' or `` timid '' . 
  being empathic means that you can read and understand the feelings and mindset of someone else , regardless of whether you like the person in question or not . 
  i 'm glad to see someone still capable of empathic reasoning around here . 
  those swedes suffer from the magic spells of a night on the finland-ferry . 
  i am sure you two will get along just fine . 
  in good viking tradition : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blood_eagle, 
  sweden almost passed a law like this but about horses , it ended up being just a firm recommendation from the swedish board of agriculture . 
  i taugth at a hochschule in bavaria and it was great , i did not have to teach on holidays and i also did not have to re-schedule . 
  different courses therefore had different number of classes , depending on which days in the week their classes were . 
  it was like a lottery . 
  welcome to / r/europe, 
  not true , the nordic countries have the largest civil societies in the world , measured in number of organizations , number of memberships and in the proportion of the population that participate in civil society organizations . 
  up to a point , yes . 
  sweden is the only country in the world where a single decision by a social worker can land you in forced addiction treatment for up to 6 months , even if you are only harming yourself ( tv\u00e5ngsv\u00e5rd ) . 
  finland used to be the only other country that did this , following the swedish model . 
  funny to think that not that long ago ( ok , 50-65 years ) , swedish women went to poland to get abortions . 
  the swedish association for sexuality education ( rfsu ) organized trips to poland for women who wanted an abortion without questions asked . 
  i notice you made it in the colors of the polish flag ... 
  that should go on a t-shirt . 
  ahh , a rt report about sweden , that must be accurate . 
  i thought frenchmen avoided being tourists in countries that are not france . 
  the parents know best in 99 percent of the cases , child protection agencies are for the remainder . 
  many , many parents care less for their children than the social workers do and even more care but can not handle the responsibility . 
  scandinavian countries award civil rights to individuals , not to families , marriages , clans or tribes . 
  children are identified as right bearing individuals and those rights are defended by the state . 
  it is not easy to watch over rights of individuals who do not know their rights ( like children ) , which is why there usually is a thorough process to decide what is best for the child , which might not be what is best for the parents . 
  that country needs to grow up . 
  drive-in bingo ? 
  the horror !, 
  i expected a picture of the viking line ferry . 
  amazing how little that has changed ... 
  german benefits are actually often more generous than in sweden and public services are less streamlined . 
  the main difference is that the german welfare state is more family-oriented , while the swedish cater to individuals . 
  yes , but they do offer good compensation when it happens , like 350 euros for the inconvenience of having to fly two hours later from stockholm to helsinki . 
  ryanair would not have done that . 
  i fly both long ( japan ) and short ( helsinki ) distance and they are great in many ways , although they have a nasty habit of overbooking their flights , in order to not have any empty seats due to late cancellations . 
  let 's see , could that be the same sjunnesson who is a spokesperson for the sweden democrats ? 
  who runs xenophobic websites ? 
  funny it should be him that is the `` journalist '' involved . 
  i go to rinkeby all the time and have never had any unpleasant experiences there .
