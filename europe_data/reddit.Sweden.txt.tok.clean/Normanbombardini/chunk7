  the thing is that the girls thought that was great and i am sure they feel the same about the bus , partly because boys are annoying and partly because they think it is natural for boys and girls to be separated ( like with the gym class ) . 
  this is the tricky part , should and could you convince them that they are wrong ? 
  they say that the introduction of bicycles to the most rural parts of northern sweden in the early 1900 's greatly reduced the problem with inbreeding . 
  it is snowing in stockholm ... 
  neither swedish nor german , although i believe that tom of finland-land is located somewhere on martin-luther-stra\u00dfe in berlin . 
  i agree , i grew up with tom of finland too , this is horrible . 
  you dodged a bullet there , old man . 
   it 's not unreasonable for the country to want something back from you . 
  it is if 96 % of all young adults the same age does not have to contribute . 
  then all citizens serve . 
  back in the 1990 's we had people able and wanting to serve in the armed forces who were not allowed ( put in the `` reserve '' ) and other people serving time in prison for refusing to carry arms . 
  hopefully they will do it better this time . 
  i guess they do not need that many , or that there is not room in the budget for them . 
  i suppose a larger number will be called in to do all the tests . 
  the plan seems to be to kidnap 4000 young people into service since conditions in the armed forces are not attractive enough to make people sign up voluntarily . 
  it will be a lottery where a small minority is forced to serve while the rest is allowed to keep a year of their youth to themselves . 
  this is nothing like that , the whole point back then was that everyone did it . 
  i did my year in the late 1990 's , when about 20-30 % was actually called in and i just felt like someone stole a year of my life while others got to go with theirs . 
  i did learn to polish my boots and walk in a straight line , though . 
  that is a grouse , a lagopus . 
  sure , everyone loves rovaniemi , but kiruna is bigger : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kiruna_municipality, 
  what is your point , that dn is wrong and the paid trolls in macedonia are right ? 
  is it not a problem if sd is gaining ground based on lies like the one about the church in kristianstad ? 
  also : dn a `` leftist '' media outlet ? 
  swedish socialists would like a word with you about that . 
  oh yes !, 
  there is a distinctly polish one on motzstra\u00dfe ( where else ? 
  ) , and another one up by sch\u00f6nhauser allee , if i remember correctly . 
  there are several polish gay bars in berlin . 
  agreed , it was entirely paternalistic . 
  married women did not get a ration of their own and unmarried men or women rarely got any rations . 
  the limitations initially did n't cover wine since consumtion of wine was not considered problematic ( guess which class of people that drank wine in sweden in the 1920 's ) . 
  sweden also introduced the [ bratt system ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bratt_system ) , which limited the amount of alcohol you could buy in accordance with how much of an upstanding citizen you were . 
  good and decent ( rich ) people got to buy more than labourers and peasants ( not rich ) . 
  the nuclear power referendum of 1980 also decided to retire all reactors by 2010 and six out of nine of them are still up and running today . 
  i 've heard people in j\u00e4mtland ( sweden , sort of ) talk about `` tr\u00f8nder-b\u00f8nder '' , seems to check out . 
  i had a professor from croatia who claimed that there were streets named after rene ( not gorden kaye ) in his homeland , a claim i have not been able to verify . 
  `` allo allo '' was popular here in sweden too , but why the particular fascination with it in yugoslavia and former yugoslavia ? 
  it has a really nice italo-disco feeling to it . 
  in good [ scandinavian tradition ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%84ttestupa ) ? 
  how ? 
  public hospitals and public health insurance , it is all coming from the same tax payers . 
  ok , no problem : it can also be a sign of an underdeveloped or inefficient health care sector . 
  sweden has the lowest number in the developed world and most of the developing world . 
  this is due to extreme npm pratices , where patients are in and out of the hospital really quick , if they are admitted at all . 
  the reasoning is that hospitals should provide only the very most advanced types of health care , long-term care can just as well be carried out in the home , by relatives and/or publically funded home care services . 
  i think it makes sense at some level but it is a fact that many people are sent home too soon , after surgery for instance . 
  i know of a case where a 90 year old lady was sent home the same day after surgery and died the same night . 
  another one of their slogans goes `` do not give everything for sweden - become a part-time soldier '' . 
  i saw a fine icelandic film tonight , [ \u00d3r\u00f3i or `` jitters '' ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1634524/ ) , a well-made coming-of-age-story . 
  i remember being booked for a flight to ber in 2013 , later changed to tegel . 
  i should have kept the ticket as a souvenir . 
  it is not a `` state media '' it is a public broadcaster that is independent from the state , like the bbc . 
  i am very happy with the choice of wood anemone ( vitsippa ) , the first sign of life after each horrible scandinavian winter . 
  those quaint little beauties grow in large fields of white , covering otherwise dead and dirty ground in wooded areas . 
  they do n't really grow in the north of sweden , though . 
  i guess most of the rest of europe have them too . 
  and at least 17 people hiding someone in their basement . 
  very nice , i took [ this picture ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gah4j48.jpg ) from my hotel window in siena a couple of years ago . 
  this [ picture from st james 's park in london ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rorzv8y.jpg ) turned out pretty well considering it was taken with a phone ( sony z3 ) . 
  i later realized it looks a lot like [ the picture in the wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/st_james%27s_park ) . 
  this is incorrect , `` checks '' is a west-sweden thing , people in sm\u00e5land ( for example ) say `` keks '' . 
  you should split the `` checks '' area along the lake v\u00e4ttern or so . 
  also , people who say `` checks '' should all be dragged out into the street and shot . 
  most swedish school children hate it too , it is just something you have to endure . 
  [ stockholm city hall ] ( http://international.stockholm.se/the-city-hall/ ), 
  reminds me of [ this solution ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paw4mntpm-w ) to a dead whale problem . 
  could we at least get credit for inventing fire ? 
  i 've actually been to kerkrade but i did not know this , i knew it was close to germany but i did n't know it was that close . 
  it is not all quantity , quality is important too . 
  many happy childhoods will create many civic taxpayers , while many poor childhoods will create many unproductive or destructive citizens . 
  childcare , paid parental leave and education are great social investments . 
  to just have more children by limiting contraceptives and abortions ( like in romania in the 80 's ) , without the investments in good childhoods only cause problems ( not saying that is what france and ireland are doing ) . 
  i would guess that wring-the-neck-of is nacka . 
  sd is on the benefit-of-the few-side , they want to keep allowing large corporations make enormous profits from tax-funded welfare services . 
  they are more like the swedish equivalent of the kkk , although now slightly reformed , with new haircuts and in suits . 
  they originate in the white supremacy and neo-nazi movements of teh early 1990 's . 
  they do not favor the social democratic model in practice , only in rhetoric . 
  they have actually cozied up to organized business in sweden and they have blocked the reversal of the former ( liberal-conservative ) government 's neo-liberal reforms . 
  sd has proven to be very pro-market even in welfare areas like health and eldercare . 
  i assume they took the ferry from ystad or trelleborg to swinoujscie in poland . 
  the swedish national association for sex education ( rfsu ) even organized bus trips to poland before 1975 . 
  it is not , it is an independent public broadcaster ( like the bbc ) , it is not a mouthpiece for the government ( like rt in russia ) just because it has public funding . 
  public funding is often seen as a way to guarantee independence of media in europe , it removes the influence of ( private ) special interests . 
  there is of course no political control of the journalistic content , that would defeat the purpose of the arrangement . 
  i 'm guessing he was picking up on the latest political trends from the usa . 
  denmark and the angry inch . 
  [ kebnekaise ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kebnekaise ) in sweden used to be 2111 meters high but it has lost 12 meters due to ice melting , the highest peak is actually just 2099 meters . 
  if it continues at this pace we will soon hit danish levels . 
  greater voter turnout would typically mean more blue collar votes , which in the case of poland means stronger support for `` traditional values '' and empty nationalistic slogans typical for pis . 
  perhaps greater youth voter turnout could counter this though . 
  this is a common misconception , the scandinavian countries are staunchly individualist for various historical reasons ( low population density , free peasantry , late industrialisation ) . 
  the large welfare states work to free individuals from dependence on other people , especially family . 
  the social policies are aimed at freeing women from dependence on their husbands , children from ( total ) dependence on their parents and men from the demand to be the breadwinner of the family . 
  scandinavians engage in collectivist arrangements ( including marriage ) only after individual autonomy and independence is established . 
  this is sometimes called `` state individualism '' . 
  i 'm disappointed it does n't play the national anthem as it rises from below . 
  i actually think this is annual daytime hours of sunshine , where sunshine after six o'clock or so does n't count . 
  this is a huge issue among northeners in sweden , they complain that their late night sunshine is not included in the official statistics . 
  this list is consistent with the ... field work i 've been doing in 8 of the countries on the list .
