  the czech republic ( or prague ) is more or less like germany while lithuania is not . 
  i met a greek exchange-student in kaunas who took the bus to the only gay bar in the country , in vilnius . 
  i incidently also saw said bar and it was a both sweet and sad affair , a bit like a closely chaperoned high school dance . 
  ahh , the classic `` it starts with gay rights and then they will allow pedophiles '' along with the equally classic `` people can be gay as long as they shut up about it '' ( as if straight people shut up about being straight ) . 
  i know you are right but just judging from the fact that the czech republic is a gay porn superpower , people in other countries may think that czechs are more than just lenient . 
  there is still time . 
  sadly , we would not . 
  i think i am offended but it could just be my anasarca acting up . 
  oh brave new world that has such people in it !, 
  the germans started two world wars and committed genocide , what recent crime against humanity is sweden responsible for ? 
  other than abba ? 
  we 're adults . 
  the statue is actually from 1916 , i guess the poster and the statue were both inspired by some other painting or drawing . 
  that was almost exactly one year ago , i arrived in vilnius for the first time ever that day and wondered what the riot was about . 
  i took a taxi from the airport and the driver wanted to go round the mayhem but i insisted on us passing by the store to observe it . 
  i think we all know him better as the father of the former us ambassador to sweden , mark brzezinski . 
  well , there is no federal level i sweden , but yes , the state owned or national ones . 
  you must have visited a private or a county/city museum . 
  they changed it back about a year ago , it has free and not free depending on governments for years . 
  there are also many private museums with entrance fees . 
  all state-owned museums in sweden are always free , although i guess they do not span quite as much of history as museums in greece . 
  they seem to have left out some types of private employers , caritas has about 617000 employees : https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/deutscher_caritasverband, 
  i believe [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy_yf4zz-yo ) is the most accurate, 
  the nihilists from the big lebowski are spot on !, 
  they are of course portrayed by a german , a swede and a bass player from red hot chili peppers . 
  fairly important i guess but the digs are not as rich as in countries like italy or the uk , there are usually fewer cultural layers here in scandinavia . 
  the job market is small but better than it has been right now , due to a lot of building and infrastructure projects . 
  i have studied a tiny bit of archaeology at uppsala university but i would rather recommend [ lund university ] ( http://www.ark.lu.se/en/ ) . 
  both lund and uppsala have research projects in turkey . 
  sweden is more centralized politically and administratively . 
  the swedish post-war economy was in large part organized according to the [ rehn-meidner model ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rehn%e2%80%93meidner_model ) , a model for full employment and low inflation based on bargaining between industry and the unions . 
  one aspect of this model was that government would allow or even encourage unprofitable and inefficient industries to go under , but instead take an active part in transfering the employees of these industries to other , more profitable parts of the economy using active labor market policies ( re-education etc. ) . 
  this lead to a lot of old industry out in the country going under and people being led to urban areas and the new jobs there , through different economic incentives . 
  this is one reason why the countryside is more lively and the regional level is more important in national politics in norway . 
  the norwegians still protect some of its domestic products from imports , like cheese and meat , which accounts for some of the price difference between sweden and norway . 
  we have none , the public discourse in sweden is increadibly trivial and petty . 
  perhaps it is the consensus culture , perhaps the [ law of jante ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/law_of_jante ) . 
  the former permanent secretary of the swedish academy horace engdahl once said he liked germany because it was `` like sweden for grown-ups '' , referring to the level of political and cultural discourse . 
  you do hear people say that they are `` going down to europe '' for vacation etc , as if europe is some other place , a bit like the british do . 
  [ silvia sommerlath ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/queen_silvia_of_sweden ) has managed to make a pretty good name for herself through her work as the longest-serving queen of sweden ever . 
  perhaps [ the procession of the dead body of karl the 12th ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/gustaf_cederstr%c3%b6m_-_bringing_home_the_body_of_king_karl_xii_of_sweden_-_google_art_project.jpg ) ( karl den tolftes likf\u00e4rd ) , symbolizing the end of the authoritarian carolean regime , adventurous and costly wars with european neighbors , but also of sweden as a great european power . 
  some consider the paintings of [ carl larsson ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/carl_larsson#/media/file:frukost_under_stora_bj%c3%b6rken_av_carl_larsson_1896.jpg ) or [ anders zorn ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/anders_zorn#/media/file:midsommardans_av_anders_zorn_1897.jpg ) to be quintessentially swedish . 
  as for films , i think [ the virgin spring ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053976/ ) by ingmar bergman is one of the most swedish/scandinavian films ever made . 
  disappointing click ... 
  no surprise there . 
  swedish with an adorable norwegian accent , if i remember correctly . 
  sipping a glas right now , excellent stuff . 
  swedish tv4 had a popular norwegian weather presenter named tone bekkestad for many years . 
  but no , i guess it is not very common . 
  [ `` the lady of the lake , her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite , held aloft excalibur from the bosom of the water , signifying by divine providence that i , arthur , was to carry excalibur . 
  that is why i am your king . 
  '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exmwk2-r2dy ), 
  because the usa is an exception that has exported its system to several countries , `` one of its most dangerous exports '' ( source : [ the west wing ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gloio0z6jlw ) ), 
  i worked a couple of months for a public university in germany and i had to sign a standard form stating i had no affiliation with the scientology movement/cult . 
  this was a formality that all new employees had to go through ( one of many , the bavarian state leaves nothing to chance ) . 
  the german accent is of course the choice of swedish royalty , both in the past and [ present times ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgy82wgvfua ) . 
  there is a great restaurant for raclette on scheelegatan 3 , if you live in or anywhere near stockholm . 
  they also have a great store with high quality cheese for reasonable prices on bergsgatan . 
  thank you for the reply . 
  i once met someone in a bar in vilnius who had gone there from kaunas just to have a drink , i imagined everyone commuted from every part of the country . 
  you can ride a bus for 8 hours in lithuania ? 
  going in circles ? 
  it would take a majority win by the sweden democrats for me to move . 
  i would move to germany , it is like sweden for grown-ups . 
  i am very pleased that he is now on our [ bank notes ] ( http://www.riksbank.se/en/notes--coins/banknotes/new-banknotes/200-krona-banknote/ ) . 
  there are many great books written on the gradual change of germany in the 1930 's . 
  eric larson 's `` in the garden of beasts : love , terror , and an american family in hitler 's berlin '' is a very well researched book about william dodd , the american ambassador to germany , and his family . 
  `` berlin diary '' by the legendary cbs-reporter william l. shirer is another great first hand account of the transformation of germany and the rise of hitlerism . 
  i would , above all , recommend christopher isherwoods `` the berlin stories '' or , better yet , his autobiographical `` christopher and his kind '' , both set in berlin in the early 1930 's . 
  i learned that europeans and americans are both ignorant about the other but that the americans know and admit that they are ignorant . 
  europeans think they know everything about life in america from watching films and tv , which leads them to act stupid and insensitive while thinking they are really smooth . 
  an example would be the use of language , if you think people talk like in american films and you try to imitate it , you will sound vulgar or offensive ( and a foreign accent do n't help ) . 
  my countrymen often believe they speak perfect english because they have been told by polite americans that they `` speak great '' ( meaning that they are relatively understandable under perfect conditions ) , while in fact they often sound adolescent and blunt . 
  another thing is that europeans feel intitled to have opinions about everything american , because they feel part of the `` american world '' through popular culture . 
  in the real world they ( we ) are foreigners who should be a bit modest about who is and who is n't an idiot in american politics , not least since we have our own politicians to worry about . 
  the usa is , in conclusion , both a real place and a fantasy place projected on the rest of the world through media , and europeans often relate to the latter , not the former . 
  do n't forget `` finska rycket '' , or the `` finnish pull '' , for the practice of last second withdraw from ongoing intercourse in order to avoid pregnancy . 
  it is possibly the least reliable means of contraceptive ever invented . 
  on my last visit to the us i visited [ four peaks brewing company ] ( http://www.fourpeaks.com/ ) in tempe , az , in between checking out of my hotel and going to the airport . 
  how i made my flight i will never know . 
  excellent beers all around . 
  well , no , i guess i did not really do the math . 
  a carlsberg is 1.2 euros and the heiniken cost 1.4 at the ( state ) store ( why anyone would be drinking either one of these two is beyond me but that is a different matter ) . 
  8 euros in a bar would be considered rather normal in sweden , although you might find bars where a beer is as little as 4-5 euros . 
  a nice ipa could easily cost 12-13 . 
  in conclusion : i am moving to romania . 
  poland has produced a disproportional amount of brilliant and original authors . 
  witold gombrowicz is a personal favorite . 
  ok , thanks . 
  that means that the store price is actually about the same in romania and sweden , while the bar price is 3-4 times higher up here ( i do not know if that helps the polish turist ) . 
  are those beer prices at bars or stores , or is there no great difference ? 
  it is the real life derp that worries me . 
  anyone who says yes can have ours . 
  france gave us beautiful films like [ themroc ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy2konsfgfo ) and [ le grand bouffe ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lcjhss8lj8 ) . 
  i really like films by austrian director ulrich seidl . 
  [ this film ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssdj6h-qeeu ) made me reconsider what i thought i knew about austria and the austrians . 
  bergman is one of very few swedish cultural exports that i can get wholeheartedly behind . 
  easily the best : [ wild strawberries ( smultronst\u00e4llet ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3n4txneapg ), 
  that terminology was never used in europe because here we recognize that all of europe is the same age . 
  eastern europe existed before the cold war , it is not new at all .
