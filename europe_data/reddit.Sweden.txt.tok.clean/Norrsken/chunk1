there are many slaves still around actually , they 've abolished it but not eradicated it.i remember reading somewhere that there is around 27 million slaves today .

  interesting topic . 
  may i ask where you are from ? 
  i know it is sometimes being discussed in sweden , which has around 1500 people who takes their own life every year . 
  it is more than 10 times as many who get murdered , 4 -5 times as many who dies on the road etc. 
  still , it not getting half of the attention . 
  in sweden it typically get talked about , once a year , they interview a parent/partner on tv , got through statistic etc , and then it does n't really get talked about . 
  i just recently picked up a ( new ) book about this in the bookstore ( did n't buy it ) and the organisation against suicide came out with a book with advice what the swedes could do as a society to prevent suicides . 
  with the princess being baptised , our own serial killer and the crises in europe , it has n't been getting a lot of attention though ( just a tad cynical here ) . 
  i think the reasons are a several : first , there 's a lot of shame around suicide . 
  even as progressive as we are supposed to be , the survivors/families talk about the guilt and shame that they feel . 
  i am not saying it 's right , but i think a lot of people do feel that way . 
  guilt and shame are tough feelings , both to carry , but also to talk about as a friend/colleguet etc. 
  thus , we prefer not to mention it . 
  second - a lot of the people who kills themselves have psychiatric problems . 
  there is , unfortunately , al lot of stigma attached to attached to that thus we prefer not to talk about it . 
  it so much easier to feel sorry for someone with cancer than to deal with the messiness that is manic depression for example . 
  third-sometimes it 's failure from hospitals/doctors . 
  it has become better , at least here , since they are able to `` report '' themselves without being charged ( in a `` what went wrong way '' ) , but it 's also not in their interest to have their failure written across the front page of the newspapers . 
  fourth - i think it would take some investement that you ca n't immediately see the benefits of . 
  we all know that those investements can be notoriously difficult to do for the politicians , since we as voters rarely demand them , and who cares what happens 10 year down the line if one wants to get re-elected . 
  fifth - some of the of the countries in the top seem to be in the vodka belt , some seem to be to have a notoriously high `` pressure '' / honour ( japan , south korea ) . 
  i think there might be a lot of cultural factors that are at play that and that is so difficult to deal with . 
  to critisize your own culture and then to try to distangle what in it makes people kill themselves is not very popular , and difficult . 
  i also see a lot of people citing the lack of sun , and there 's nothing to do about that . 
  i honestly think that is just a minor problem , if you look at that list sweden , norway , canada should be way higher on the list , particularely compared to croatia , japan etc. 
  even someone have studies about that i would like to see it . 
  i think it might be a factor , but a minor one . 
  the thing that made the most difference in sweden is the new anti-depressants that came in the 90 's ( which we can see in the statistic , god , swedes really love statistics ) and i think new behavouir/attention from medical personnel etc : ** tl : dr suiciedes are messy and complicated , and a lot of factors weigh in why we kill ourselves . 
  thus , we rather stay away and let it slide ** edit : spelling, 
  i also think that we * only * send female delegates/ministers/ambassadors to meet with people of their sort . 
  edit : and gays , lesbians , transgender persons and crossdressers . 
  we have a rather hopeless politician who could finally be useful . 
  fredrik federley , gay and a crossdresser with the alter ego name of ursula . 
  i wonder if they would consider him female when he is dressed as ursula ? 
  it 's rather stupid of him to alienate more people . 
  he is supposed to be an ambassador for israel , not his form of judaism . 
  but i guess that is the problem with the super religious , religion comes before common sense . 
  all i 've heard about is a small chip where our information * could * possibly be stored like fingerprints . 
  i recently got a new passport and i talked about it with the police . 
  i do n't think it 's ready and implemented though , although i did have to leave my fingerprints ( have n't done that before ) , and at least sweden is `` preparing '' for it . 
  i think we are going to have that on our id cards too . 
  i guess one could store other information there as well . 
  it seems like he is trying to get as many downvotes as possible . 
  not even trying to discuss anything , just make up stuff and insult people . 
  he is a rather good troll though . 
   then , if we agree that this is a good system well , yes , but one need other systems as well . 
  what i reacted to , was that it seemed unusual to you . 
  also , that only concerns the income tax , not all the other taxes one pays , like vat , taxes on houses , employment , capital etc. 
   where does the perception that nobody pays taxes in the south come from ? 
  first , i do n't think they have been doing that everywhere ( until possibly recently ) . 
  the perception that people do n't pay taxes in the south comes among other things from : * [ transparency international corruption index ] ( http://cpi.transparency.org/cpi2011/results/ ) . 
  spain is 31 , portugal 32 , italy 69 and greece 80 . 
  compare that to denmark/finland ( 2 ) , sweden ( 5 ) , netherlands ( 7 ) , germany ( 14 ) , uk/austria ( 16 ) , belgium/ireland ( 19 ) .

   every pay-check is taxed !, 
  when my pay-check is deposited in my bank account , the taxes are already deducted . 
  i honestly did n't know one could do it differently . 
  of course it should be done that way , otherwise people cheat . 
  thanks , at least he did n't get away with it . 
  did he get sentenced for it ? 
  you should be , he seemed to be a very courageous man . 
  did they ever get the ones who murdered him ? 
  several of those ( at least in sweden ) are also abusing the system . 
  they might live on social security , but then in addition to that hold down an illegal job . 
  also , they employ ( and treat ) illegal immigrants and that is bad in several ways . 
  they treat them like shit and sometimes they pay them next to nothing . 
  also , particularely in construction they do n't comply with the necessary safety laws . 
  apart from that , those immigrants are here illegaly , and thus , should not be employed . 
  i 've read that the shadow economy of greece is around 25 % and i that has to be a problem . 
  we have a shadow economy of 6-7 % , and that is a problem for us . 
  as the case with finland , it 's mainly in construction , restaurants and simpler `` labour jobs '' , like cleaning . 
  the problem is of course , not paying taxes , unfair competition , avoiding labour/safety laws , abusing the system ( living on welfare and working at the same time ) , employing illegal immigrants etc. ... 
  i forgot not ... 
   if we start enforcing this rule to let 's say germany , suddenly we would all be `` why us and not the rest ? '', 
  then they need to fine other countries , too . 
  the fine will never be payed because they already are in a deficit . 
  even if they fine them they would be unbelievably patient when waiting for that money . 
  well , we got to start somewhere . 
  say , in three years then - and mean it . 
  also , we who actually do things right should get a bonus , get out of paying fees or something until they get their act together . 
  one can not do this and get away with it . 
  how is that in any way fair ? 
   is it all hypocrite bs ? 
  yes , yes it is . 
  i agree with you :-) . 
   biggest ` political ' risks here are non-eu countries that would lose eu funds and might not join the eu some day because of that or because they do n't meet the standards no , i do not agree with you there . 
  biggest political risk is that i , and a lot of people like me have lost all faith in the eu , and is turning more and more against it . 
  it is not democratic , it blatantly supports corruption and behaviour that completely against the rules and then punishes those who actually behaves ( we voted against the euro , why on earth are you trying to force stupid ftt on us ) . 
  that is a far bigger risk than possible future states . 
   and use all our democratic given rights to try to steer this out of control truck called eu . 
  it 's not working . 
  they are promising funds i do n't think they have to right to promise , they politicians do not seem to know how to vaguely balance a budget ( a lot of them at least ) and no one , as far as i know , has been punished or held accountable for their crimes/wrong decisions . 
   right now they slow down by not enforcing the rules . 
  i do n't think they are slowing down by enforcing . 
  we saw what happened with the euro when they just forged ahead , without regards to rules or democracy . 
  when you build a house , you start with the foundation . 
  the eu/eurozone has to go back and fix that first , otherwise they ca n't go forward at all .
