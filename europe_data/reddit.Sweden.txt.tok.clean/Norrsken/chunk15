   where in my comments do i say that the main culprits are foreigners ? 
  you keep bringing this up , but nowhere in my comment do i make that assertion . 
  i answered the comment of tagami ( above my forst post of course ) , quoted him , like this  greece 's corruption was facilitated mainly by siemens and other western europe corporations , who found a blind man and led him to the cliff 's edge . 
  and then my links and my arguments were toward * his * statement , that * greece 's corruption was facilitated mainly by siemens . 
  * * that * what was my original disagreement , and i provided links to respectable sources , to prove that the greeks were mainly to blame , not the foreigners which , his post said . 
  then you started to argue with me claiming :  the number from your first link does not address corruption . 
  furthermore , it sounds like bullshit because the only source everyone on the internet is citing for this information , is the same shitty cnn article that has no citations . 
   your second link does not go counter to what the above commenter said . 
  you are clearly disagreeing with me ( you wrote more , but that is an excerpt ) so , therefore i have , repeatedly asked you to provide me with links where i am proven wrong , and that most of the debacle that greece is in , in because of the * greeks * , not because of non-greeks . 
  you have , repeatedly failed to do so , the only thing you have said is that siemen 's is corrupt . 
  i have never ever disputed that , i just do not think that they are the cause ( together with other western european companies )  i asked for a reliable source other than that cnn article , i have provided you with several links to greece 's tax evasion and tax corruption , but * if * you had actually bothered to read the article , you could have seen that it was from a * greek * source , from 2008 ( * before * all hell broke loose i might add , even though it probably was n't fun then ) . 
  here , it is in the first paragraph . 
   more than 5 million greeks did not pay income taxes for 2008 , according to public documents released by the struggling nation 's finance ministry . 
   i 'm doing you a favor replying to your mess of a comment as it is . 
  your convoluted logic makes answering very difficult and ultimately pointless . 
  no , you are very weird . 
  the only thing you have is opinion , and when someone * proves * you wrong , you disagree and start to talk about something else . 
  you do not like that people do not have the same * opinion * as you have - therefore the * facts * must be wrong . 
  please , start using facts !, 
  a ) you still have n't adressed you * enormous * shadow economy . 
  please answer why you have that if the main culprits are foreigners . 
  i am swedish , and i 'll happily provide you with links . 
  you can take a look at sweden , norway , denmark , finland , switzerland , austria , the netherlands , uk for example at the previous links ( transparency international ) and take a look at where we are . 
  then i suppose you know we have siemens and other firms that we have ( or just check on their web pages ) . 
  see , same firms as greece but we are * way * higher on the * non - corruption * scale . 
  about siemens , i never said that they were not bad , but i did point out that the * main reason * why greece is where it 's at is the fault of the * greeks * , not of the foreigners . 
  are you saying that siemens are the cause of your enormous foreign debt ? 
  you huge budget deficit ? 
  or , perhaps , the fact that you are number 80 on the corruption scale ? 
  you do not even seem willing to take responsibility for your tax evasion - no surprise you are where you are . 
   and since you 're so link happy , you might want to include a better source than cnn for that 6 out of 10 number , as well as a link for the 8 out of 10 number for your country , whilst explaining what you mean my `` in some form '' . 
  i 'm pretty sure we 'll find that 10 out of 10 people in greece pay taxes `` in some form '' . 
  i am link happy because it 's evidence , not just completely unrealistic comments like * 10 out of 10 * . 
  please , you are now not just arguing against me , you are also arguing against cnn - i 'd like to see you provide me with proof/links that they are wrong , not just an anonymous voice on the internets * opinion * . 
  just because you do not like it , does n't mean that they are wrong , ust that * you * do n't like them . 
  i have linked to a respectable news source . 
  you might not like it , but disapprove it with links to other respectable news sources , not * opinions * . 
  how old are you , really ? 
  second , there is no country in the world where 10 out of 10 people pay taxes , perhaps you can find that sort of taxation in the official norht korean statistic . 
  oh , i doubt that you 'll read 163 pages in swedish , but go ahead , here is where i found the information about the swedish taxes . 
  yes it does . 
  in my country that supports greece , 8 out of 10 pays taxes , in some form . 
  7-8 out of 10 is normal in a tax paying country in europe . 
  perhaps you did n't know that . 
  but since you do not believe me - here are more links about * tax corruption of the greek people * [ link 1 ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financialcrisis/8585593/greece-loses-15bn-a-year-to-tax-evasion.html ) [ link 2 ] ( http://www.newyorker.com/talk/financial/2011/07/11/110711ta_talk_surowiecki ) [ link3 ] ( http://www.grreporter.info/en/greece_looses_%e2%82%ac_13_billion_year_tax_evasion/5591 )  your second link does not go counter to what the above commenter said . 
  yes , it does . 
  he said :  greece 's corruption was facilitated mainly by siemens and other western europe corporations . 
  the key word is mainly . 
  basically he says most of the fault lies outside of greece . 
  you do not get to * number 80 * on the list without massive corruption , all through the society , not among `` the foreign firms ''  if they are not innocent , why not blame them for their part ? 
  he put * most of the blame * on them . 
  perhaps you should notice that a lot of other countries have siemens and other western european firms without being corrupt . 
  please , if you are going to argue that the most of the blame falls on other but the greeks , provide links why * the main culprits * are westen european firms . 
  so far you have not provided any links or reliable sources , just argued about things you did n't like . 
  besides , you did n't mention the shadow economy , is that the fault of western european firms as well ? 
   greece 's corruption was facilitated mainly by siemens and other western europe corporations , who found a blind man and led him to the cliff 's edge . 
  [ 6 out of 10 greeks do not pay any taxes ] ( http://articles.cnn.com/2010-12-31/world/greece.taxes_1_income-taxes-greek-press-tax-evasion?_s=pm:world ) [ greece on transparency international list ] ( http://www.transparency.org/publications/publications/other/corruption_perceptions_index_2011 ) [ greece shadow economy , over 25 % ] ( http://www.econ.jku.at/members/schneider/files/publications/2011/shadecon31.pdf ) there are * a lot more * links like that . 
  greece 's corruption was mainly facilitated by the greeks . 
  you do not get that level of corruption otherwise . 
  other parties are not innocent , but do not blame it on anyone else . 
  i do understand however that most greeks do not support this sort of cartoons . 
   we were the first for a lot of very progressive ideas : women voting , industry sorry to be picky , but new zeeland for women and the industrial revolution in britain ... not saying you did n't do them though , but you were not the first . 
  i found what you wrote otherwise interesting . 
  one thing i do n't quite agree with is that  with the glasses of the 1950 & 60 's , then you see the mistakes that it seems you 're angry at . 
  i 'm angry at iraq , not vietnam , angry at not accepting climate change , the blind support of israel without helping the palestinians to get a state of their own too etc - things that are happening now . 
  sure , what you did before has had an effect and influences what people think ( like in iran ) but i do n't really have a problem with your current government for the `` before '' things . 
  sorry , will stop nitpicking now :-) . 
  i think you are right in a lot of ways . 
  most people ( which also includes americans ) that travel quickly learn that they need to know `` other countries stuff '' . 
  it is more common/easier to do that in europe . 
   another point is that if it 's 8hrs of travel to go anywhere of importance outside the united states then people are n't going to be wanting to waste 2 of their vacation days just in the air . 
  true , you need more vacation days !, 
  also one thing that work to your disadvante is that you speak english , then it 's not as necessary to learn another language , thus discovering the culture . 
   we as americans should know more about geography , i know , at it frightens me that you do n't , particularely when you vote . 
  how do you think one can go about changing that ? 
  the only things i can think of right now are two , rather different things . 
  you turn massively to the left , invest more in schools etc , essentially canada , which means more traveling , but also different focus of the schools.super unlikely . 
  the other one is that as you `` fall '' on the international importance ladder ( you will eventually , every country does and other countries rises ) you realise that you have to change your focus of and invest more in schools/education etc. 
  also , as you fall you automatically become more dependent on others , thus needs to know more about them.could happen eventually i suppose interesting post , thanks . 
   my voting record i meant you , as in you americans , not you chudley . 
  i am sorry if you though it was you personally i meant . 
  i have no clue who you are voting for , nor do i personally hold you responsible for the wars . 
  since you are on reddit , i 'd say it 's a larger likelyhood of you being a democrat i suppose . 
  i also think i 'd be a democrat if i was as us citzen . 
   knowing the capital of cyprus does n't matter in world affairs . 
  true , but it does n't mean one should n't know it . 
   knowing where in the world iraq is ; yea , that 's an important fact that americans should know . 
  ( and i wont get into that ) but that is my issue and while it 's certainly your prerogative not to discuss it , to me it is of importance , since i think it affects your foreign policy . 
  i do n't understand why it 's so sensitive to saying you ( again , as a county ) suck at geography . 
  i have absolutely no problem blasting swedes math knowledge , and how it negatively affects us in competition with other countries . 
  i do n't hate the us , but i do wish you 'd ( as a country ) invest more in learning about other countries , because i think both the world and the us would benefit from it . 
  i am swedish and you still have n't provided me with links why the studies ( who were americans btw ) are wrong and you really * are * good at geography . 
  also , not all nato countries went to iraq , most notably france ( freedom fries , when they said that saddam did n't have the weapons you claimed that he had ) . 
  sweden is not in nato , and what you could blame us for is that we sell weapons perhaps . 
  i do n't hate the us but i do not see why you are defending * geography * knowledge that does n't seem to be there . 
  our schools certainly are n't perfect either , why not just admit to that then , and say that it 's something you wish would change . 
   second , do n't infer who i vote for . 
   third , i do n't go to war . 
  rich powerful white men go to war and drag everyone else in with them . 
  your country elects them .
