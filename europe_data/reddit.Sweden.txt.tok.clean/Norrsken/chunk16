  you , as a country , elected and re-elected g w bush , and you currently have presidential candidates blasting against iran . 
  are you saying that americans are not responsible for the war in iraq ? 
  then who is ? 
  please , italians are responsible for berlusconi , greeks for their mess , of course you are responsible for the wars you go to and the countries you invade . 
   my offence stems from the misleading title of ` americans ' instead of ` cnn ' . 
  well , if you had read the studies i linked to , you would see that it is proven that americans * are * worse at geography . 
  perhaps not * you * as an individual , but as whole , you are . 
  or are you saying that the studies are wrong ? 
  then please , link to some counterevidence . 
  i have access to all major scientific journals . 
  otherwise , the title is a bit correct , although i can see why you do not like it . 
   but americans were called out for not knowing what the capital of cyprus is , and i argue that most europeans could n't name new york 's capital city probably not , but we do learn it in school . 
  i also dare to venture on the fact that neither can most americans . 
  you are making a lot of assumptions in this thread about our education , none of them true i might add . 
  also , you are basing you whole reasoning on the size of the gdp . 
  well , then we should all ignore israel , should n't we , but that is not very likely . 
  economy is n't the only thing in the world , and i honestly feel sad for you if that is how you base things . 
  there are a lot of wonderful things that are not finance based or on a top ten . 
   to re-re-iterate , my argument is n't against you , i 'm sorry for the blunt , arrogant offense towards cyprus . 
  the misleading title enraged me and i needed to draw a strong parallel . 
  apology accepted , and that did piss me off , although i am not from cyprus :-) . 
  i have been there though and it was lovely . 
  part of the argument is also that one is supposed to know the capitals of countries in europe , just like you are very uneducated if you only speak one language ( or old ) . 
  i know cyprus is a small country and more people would know paris or berlin . 
  i know it 's not the same in the us , and that is a cultural divide i think you have against the rest of the world . 
  i understand part if it , given that you are a huge country , with lots of provinces/states but so is russia , india and china for example , and they good at geography-it must be about the importance you place on it . 
  another reason i reacted is that i honestly find it frightening that you are/were at war with a country most people ca n't find on the map . 
  it does not bode well for the future , neither for europe or the us ( or iran ) . 
  how is the reasoning behind your wars and interventions ? 
  if most people do not know the country , they do not care to stop it either . 
  it * is * affecting your foreign policy , that is why i react . 
   how is it a problem ? 
  what does cyprus do ? 
   shitty cyprus you 've clearly showed your disdain for cyprus there . 
  it is apparent that you * only * care about countries economy , nothing else . 
  for the rest of us , we might care about it 's people , rich history , strategic importance etc. 
   i think that it 's a problem that you do n't know any of our states and that 's deplorable . 
   california is the 8th largest economy in the world i did learn your states and the state capitals at school , and i also knew that california was the 8th largest economy in the world . 
  you are making a lot of assumptions , all of them completely incorrect i might add . 
   how is it a problem ? 
  the subject of geography is n't just capitals and rivers . 
  as you pointed out in your example about california , it also contains information about history , economy etc. 
  the fact that your population knows little of what happens and the countries outside of it 's borders is a huge problem because : when the us , deals , interfers and * goes to war * with other countries , it affects us , the non-us people . 
  you have been at war and invaded iraq , still 63 % ( !!! ), 
  of your population ca n't find that on a map . 
  how many of it millions of refugees have you taken in for example ? 
  you vote for people who routinely interfer with other countries ( or invade them ) yet , when you vote , you place little importance of what your government does outside of your country . 
  you might go to war with iran now . 
  can most americans find it on a map ? 
  do most americans now that * one * of the reasons that they hate you is that you deposed of a * democratic * elected president to replace him with a corrupt shah ? 
  you learn those things in geography . 
  do any of you care ? 
  it affects * me * how you vote , so your ignorance affects me . 
  i do n't care half as much about your backward thinking ( although i think it 's wrong ) when it comes to your attitudes towards gay people , abortions , health care , because that is * within * your country . 
  however , when you keep on electing people who invades at whims , it * does * affect me . 
  but , since the only thing you care about is finances , you * might * know that iran has oil ' - well , let 's go to war then . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.economywatch.com/economies-in-top/?page=full ) is a list over the 10 biggest economys in the world . 
  iran is not on it , so i guess you can invade then ? 
  the countries in europe that you can visit are germany , france , uk , italy , and russia . 
  i must say , i am very happy that my small unimportant country will not get visit from you , we are not even interesting enough to invade . 
   actually , my point is that why would i , or any americans care about the capitol of cyprus . 
  for us that is a ) general knowledge to learn all the capitals b ) you are `` supposed '' to know things like that , so if you don ' , one apologises or one is stupid ( not saying that you personally are ) the fact that you do not think it 's a problem , tells me a lot of how the us is compared to the rest of the world ( if you read the studies i linked to before ) , and how you and your countrymen value georaphy . 
  there are several studies that show that the people of the us and , according to the second study i link to , the people of north america ( in general of course ) are worse at geography than other countries . 
  apparently that spills over to the networks as well here are two studies : [ link 1 ] ( http://www.nationalgeographic.com/roper2006/pdf/finalreport2006geoglitsurvey.pdf ) and [ link 2 ] ( http://www.nationalgeographic.com/geosurvey2002/download/ropersurvey.pdf ) to me , and to a lot of people in this thread i think is normal / average knowing the capitals of the world . 
  nothing special , just normal . 
  and for a * network * not to know ... 
  what , are they a nordic country now ? 
  sorry , i might be a bit slow . 
   there are what , 190 countries or so ? 
  i sincerely doubt you know the capitals of all of them . 
  good on you for realizing iqaluit ai n't a country , but the amount of obviously false superiority you 're projecting is kind of embarrassing . 
  eeeh , you are kind of angry and weird and you are calling me things that i am not , so i think you should stop now . 
  also , no , i do not know the capitals of all the countries in the world , but probably more than the average us citizen ( you used american , but i thought you were canadian ) which is n't really to difficult . 
  obviously i 'll provide you with links , so the * false * superiority you sense on this thread is n't really false , it is rather real . 
   but i guess i should have known better than to interrupt a ` europe is so much smarter than america ' circle-jerk , so i guess i should just stop trying . 
  i do n't know if we are smarter as in more intelligent , but we are better at geography than people in the united states , according to this [ this ] ( http://www.nationalgeographic.com/roper2006/pdf/finalreport2006geoglitsurvey.pdf ) study , among other things . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.nationalgeographic.com/geosurvey2002/download/ropersurvey.pdf ) is another study , from 2002 where all the european countries in the study scored better than the north american countries ( us , canada , mexico ) . 
  personally i think we teach more geography , and it 's valued more in our countries , which you answers and attitude clearly show ... 
   this seems sort of like a canadian getting upset that you do n't know the capital of iqaluit , or an african getting upset you do n't know the capital of botswana i know the capital of botswana , i do think one should learn the capitals of countries , and i think most europeans agree with me . 
  iqaluit is not a country as far as i know . 
  another thing is that cnn should know better . 
  when you think of stockholm you could think of the capital of sweden * or * stockholm in saskatchewan , but i do hope that cnn can tell the difference . 
  what i have encountered is that some of people on this board seem to think ** europe = eu = eurozone ** . 
  a lot of the time i read things like `` europe should help its members '' , `` the european currency '' . 
  i am happy to notice that a lot of people seem to know the difference between scandinavia ( sweden , norway , denmark ) and the nordic countries ( sweden , norway , denmark , iceland and finland ) . 
  because you learn capitals in schools ( at least i did ) and nicosia is the capital of cyprus . 
  when did the danes help the germans during the war ? 
   where exactly did you get your numbers ? 
  6 out of 10 do n't pay at all ? 
  [ from cnn ] ( http://articles.cnn.com/2010-12-31/world/greece.taxes_1_income-taxes-greek-press-tax-evasion/2?_s=pm:world ) . 
  i 'd also like to add that my countries income bracket start around $ 1800 ( yours at 12 000 ) , and i do not see why you should start later ( apart from the fact that your taxes are lower , were you to pay them ) as long as we contribute to the rescue fund . 
   so many old people with pensions ( even fraudulent ! ), 
  + a gigantic public sector . 
  all of these guys pay at least their salary/pension taxes i do not consider it brilliant that employees and retired people pay taxes , i consider it normal . 
  besides , all the employees and pensioneers do not , [ link 1 ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financialcrisis/8585593/greece-loses-15bn-a-year-to-tax-evasion.html ) in the article they estimate that those who pay the most taxes are the 2 million privately employed , not the public employees . 
  only 2 million , out of 12 ? 
  ( and they probably cheat too , sigh ) you also [ have a shadow economy of 27 % that pays no taxes and greek taxpayers owe as much as the budget deficit ] ( http://www.newyorker.com/talk/financial/2011/07/11/110711ta_talk_surowiecki ) . 
  you do not have that big of a shadow economy without a lot of normal people cheating . 
  basically , i hate cheats , and i hate even more giving money to thieves and cheaters . 
  you have a golden opportunity to punish them - please go after them with all you 've got .
