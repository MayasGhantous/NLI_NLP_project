  well , so then we all should stop following rules then ? 
  no use making them if no one follows them ? 
  that would n't work either . 
  i 'd like to receive a list of which rules are ok and which are not . 
  hypocrasy , that is what it is , and as long as they do n't deal with it , they are going to have problem with legimatecy , or doing anything actually . 
   that are not in line with their own rules , there would n't even be eu funds fine with me , we pay more than we get anyway . 
  should serve them right . 
  perhaps * that * could teach them something , since nothing else seems too ... 
  i read in the eu observer that only four countries actually lives up to the rules are , finland , sweden , luxemburg and estonia ... [ link ] ( http://euobserver.com/19/116156 ) the countries not in line are supposed to be punished , and/or have their eu funds suspended . 
  i find that very interesting , that the eu seems to pick and choose what sort of rules to follow , sort of like very religious people who just focus on parts of the bible/koran etc. . if the eu wants me to have faith in them or even begin to believe that they are halfway honest , or at least attempt to be democratic , they should start punishing themselves . 
  otherwise , it 's just hypocracy . 
  oh - they wanted sweden to contribute more money to the eu as well . 
  i wonder why and where those money are going . 
  so , only four countries have access to some of the funds . 
  that is brilliant for us !, 
  what ? 
  it 's a the front page every day of svd/dn , di , the news shows , p1 morgon , aktuellt , agenda etc. 
  what do you read and listen too ? 
  yes , sorry about that , it was a bit old . 
  i posted a newer one , from eurostat . 
  here you go : [ link ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/pressreleasesaction.do?reference=stat/12/77&amp;format=html&amp;aged=0&amp;language=en&amp;guilanguage=en ), 
  you are so strange . 
  it is as if you are not reading the links . 
  here is the latest tax information from eurostat . 
  [ link ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/pressreleasesaction.do?reference=stat/12/77&amp;format=html&amp;aged=0&amp;language=en&amp;guilanguage=en ) sweden/denmark/germany / belgium pay more taxes than greece , italy etc. 
  the country with the highest taxes in the world , in total , is denmark , followed by sweden . 
  that is true - please show me the data that say it is n't . 
  generally , looking at that list ( or the wiki list , or any other links ) , northern europe pay more taxes than southern europe . 
  are you claiming that is not the case ? 
  originally it was that a portugese person doubted that a dane paid more taxes . 
  i said that they did , and , as a general rule , northern europeans paid more . 
   you made another statement `` we do not cheat on our taxes '' - which is neither true nor false , it is just pointless when you are trying to discuss data . 
  i mean , that in addition to paying more taxes ( in percentage ) we have less of a shadow econonomy and less tax evasion . 
  that is not pointless - you see , if the greeks actually paid all their taxes , they would not have a budget deficit . 
  we do not have that sort of massive tax evasion that greece has , or southern italy . 
  as the link showed , italy looses billions - money i am sure they could put to better use . 
  it feels like you really do not want to read my links , which i suppose is ok , but do not say i do n't back it up . 
  i had no problem with the ausl\u00e4nderbeh\u00f6rden when i lived in germany . 
  it went very fast . 
  the most embarrassing thing was when i waited for to be let in i waited in a special queue for eu/ees citizens which consisted of four people . 
  the other 200 were non - eu , in the other queue . 
  maybe we have the same , but i 've never applied for recidency in sweden , obviously . 
  cool !, 
  that is very impressive !, 
  i think at least greece have seen a rather sudden increase in vat , and from what i 've understood , a lot of southern europe has been forced to raise taxes , so the divide is not as big as it used to be as well . 
  i have n't really thought about west/east , but of course you are right there . 
  i suppose part of the problem is that if you are integrating , you have to pay ( around ) as much in taxes , both in % , and `` as populations '' ( i mean , not evade taxes ) . 
  also , i can understand that only raising taxes while not cutting down on spending or having extra programs is n't very popular . 
  well , i have no problem supporting them actually . 
  [ here ] ( http://cpi.transparency.org/cpi2011/results/ ) is a link to transparency international corruption index , you can download the whole report . 
  as you 'll notice , northern europe is generally less corrupt than southern europe . 
  greece for example is number 80 , very low . 
  here are some articles as well about tax evasion in southern europe . 
  [ italy ] ( http://articles.businessinsider.com/2011-11-28/europe/30449393_1_tax-evasion-tax-burden-labour ) [ greece ] ( http://online.wsj.com/article/sb10001424052748704182004575055473233674214.html ) . 
  are you honestly trying to convince me that greeks are as diligent in paying their taxes as the finns ? 
  i am not saying that individual greeks are not honest , but as a nation they have a shadow economy of 25 % and massive tax evasion ( i 'll happily back that up too ) . 
  do you think it 's the other way around ? 
  here is new information from eurostat [ link ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/pressreleasesaction.do?reference=stat/12/77&amp;format=html&amp;aged=0&amp;language=en&amp;guilanguage=en ) . 
  northern europe is on top ( unfortunately ) . 
  yes , i said most , but you tend to forget the vat , 25 % , read the whole article , just not the graph . 
  i never said in the first place just to look at the graph - and look at the other links . 
  if you look at the other links , danmark and sweden are in top . 
  also , we do not cheat as much on our taxes , which means we do actually pay what we have to . 
  the green one is the personal tax . 
  spain , greece , portugal etc are well below ( most ) northern countries . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.worldtaxpayers.org/statpres.htm ) is another one , albeit a bit old . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.cnbc.com/id/42192653/world_s_highest_tax_rates?slide=2 ) is one more . 
  i 'd also like to point out , that we are much more likely to pay or taxes as well , if you compare us to some countries . 
  i do n't agree with that article . 
  there are endless reports from mang 's trial , ( as it should be ) . 
  there * is * also racism in a ) sweden b ) malm\u00f6 , but i do n't think it 's being ignored . 
  also , daniel pool is working for expo , and is only speaking in his own interest - they are * only * watching the far right , and need the attention . 
  i am not very fond of expo , daniel poohl or the late stieg larsson for that matter . 
  they tend to have decided beforehand what to think , and , at least with regards to stieg larsson , people tend to forget he was a raving communist , left of the left . 
   i doubt that . 
  25-35 % of my income goes directly to the state , 40-50 % of my father 's income goes to the state and i bet we earn less than we would in your country . 
  then again we are lucky to have a job . 
  you are wrong . 
  take a look at [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_tax_rates ) link . 
  the highest taxes country is denmark , followed by sweden . 
  northern europeans pay more taxes than southern europeans . 
  so where are you going to get the money from , to pay for spain , portugal and the other countries ? 
  ah , thank you, 
  i have never said that i want to go back to what was before - you said that . 
  i disagree with that since the ez - country the try to force us ( non ez countries ) to impose a tax that we never wanted . 
  it is very undemocratic . 
  i disagree with the fact that you entered a monetary union without political integration . 
  then you put up rules that almost no one followed ( sorry finland ) and basically messed up because of that , we are suppose to aid you , but apparently not have a say in how/what/when ? 
  what if we think the euro is daft , or think grexit is a good thing . 
  on top of that the eu wants more money . 
  i do n't want to go back , but i want the ez to get their act together and put the blame where it 's supposed to be - at your feet , certainly not britain . 
  also , if you could stop trying to get non-ez countries to impose ( really bad and stupid ) taxes to save the ez , it would be a step in the right direction . 
  i disagree . 
  sweden has sided a lot with britain lately , and it 's basically because we are outside of the euro . 
  we voted * against * the euro , in other words , the swedish people said no . 
  that has n't stopped the * euro - states * to try to supeimpose as tax we never wanted on us ( which we , incidententally actually tried , as the only country in the world btw ) we voted against the euro , since we did n't want other countries to do that . 
  in addition , they euro countries need extra money , and the eu is as well asking for more money , for their failed projects . 
  i do n't find it very democratic what it 's being done , we voted against all of this and asked to be left outside . 
  we are not just trying to take advantage , we , as well as britain has imposed eu rules , eu laws etc , and has paid netto since we joined . 
  but we have asked not to implement * euro * stuff , which has been almost forced on us .
