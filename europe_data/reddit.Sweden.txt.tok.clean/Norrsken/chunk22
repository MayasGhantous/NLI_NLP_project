  very few countries do * not * have a bad history . 
  one has to look forward , not backwards and stop blaming everyone else . 
  the estonians do not behave like you do . 
  neither does the belgians , the poles etc. 
  other countries have been constructed too , or have definately suffered more ( i think every 6th pole died in wwii ) , not to mention countries like south korea etc. 
  the only one who can fix greece is the greeks , and you will never do it until you accept more blame than you are letting on . 
  and - you are still not answering why greeks are cheating on their taxes . 
  because a you did n't like what happened in 1821 you use that as an excuse to behave immoral almost 200 years later . 
  it sounds to me like the sort of reasoning that is used in the middle east , and it always ends up with both sides being loosers and no one is the winner . 
  and yes , i did read the comment . 
  have you read all my links ? 
  do you want me to give you more articles from more countries , or are you still determined to accept none of the blame , and to keep saying that everything is germanys fault ? 
  and , please - again. , why do n't you have to build a sustainable pension system ? 
  are you saying because you have a bad history ( which is apparently the worst in the world , belgian , estonian and finnish ta payers have to sustain you ? 
   wow slow down there sport . 
  that 's a lot of hate . 
  the truth is uncomfortable ? 
  it hurts ? 
  what is this teenage talk ? 
  are you 16 ? 
  that is rich coming from someone who asked if i was german ? 
  i am not , but what does that has to do with statistic from oecd ( which i noticed you have n't countered ) or articles from the economist . 
  who hands out links to threads like this , to discuss greeks burning flags ? 
  what infantile person burn flags , or admires it ? 
   greece was constructed at the start of the 19th century , like belgium , italy and germany as well by the way . 
  portugal , military dictature until 1974 . 
  and do n't get me started on eastern europe , under sovjet rule until 1989 . 
  that is no reason , nor is an excuse to lie and cheat . 
  so , because you have been under foreign rule , you do not have to construct a sustainable pension system ? 
  is that really your argument ? 
  what countries in europe has n't been under foreign rule . 
  not many , but i do n't see finns , estonians , hungarians , irish , or anyone else blaming that . 
  i have to ask you how old you are ? 
  so any country , that has anything bad , or even a lot of things bad happen to them , do not have a responsiblity , for all time ? 
  do you think you are the only country in the world with problems ? 
  you still have n't countered my arguments that the greeks themselves contributed to the downfall by being very ineffective , by cheating and retire early ( and raising salaries much more than they could afford ) . 
  the only argument you have had is `` history has n't always been nice to us , therefore we are allowed to behave bad '' . 
  * every * country has shit in their history , you just choose how to deal with it . 
  oh , here are links from spanish and dutch papers , so you see that is not just the germans . 
  [ [ link ] ( http://www.presseurop.eu/en/content/article/1491631-grexit-taboo-has-been-broken ) [ link ] ( http://www.presseurop.eu/en/content/article/1487851-why-we-ve-had-enough-greece ), 
  swede here . 
  i can understand and speak ( and read ) with norweigans and danish people . 
  the weirdest langueage ( for me though ) is icelandic . 
  it feels like i am on the verge of understanding it the whole time , a word here and there , and all of a sudden , there comes a senctence i understand completely . 
  then it goes back to being frustrating . 
  your admission has bven removed from europe , does n't that tell you something ? 
  also , you have to expalin the statistic to me - why are you cheating on your taxes ? 
  why do you have a shadow economy that is so enormous ? 
  is your history the reason why you built up an unsustainable pension system ? 
  are you are incapable of reading statistics - why do n't you have a functioning tax and data collection , why are you so low on the corruption list ? 
  no , i am not german and if you think that the only ones who object to the way greece is managed you are dillusional . 
  i think you refuse to accept the truth , because the truth is uncomfortable and would force you to look at yourself , and that hurts . 
  you are seriously ignoring my links . 
  did germany force you to build up a shadow ecenomy ? 
  did the french force you to have tax cheating on a massive scale ? 
  did the banks force you to build up a completely unsustainable pension system ? 
  for god 's sake , take responsiblity at least for your part . 
  well , if you want stats i would like to know why you such incredibly low inefficiency among you public employees . 
  700 000 of them and apparently , accordin to [ this oecd report ] ( http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/53/40/49264921.pdf ) you hardly have a functioning state . 
  you also lack the ability to collect taxes , data and make budgets . 
  is that the work of 1 % ? 
  another thing i 'd like to question is how you can [ have a shadow economy that is estimated to 27 % of the economy ] ( http://www.newyorker.com/talk/financial/2011/07/11/110711ta_talk_surowiecki ) if only 1 % are the bad guys ? 
  more statistic : [ 6 out of 10 greeks do not pay taxes ] ( http://articles.cnn.com/2010-12-31/world/greece.taxes_1_income-taxes-greek-press-tax-evasion?_s=pm:world ) . 
  [ how the greeks retired earlier and with more pension than other countries ] ( http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90777/90853/7167301.html ) . 
  yes . 
  i know that is beginning to change , but you still [ have one pensioneer to every 1.7 worker ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-06-17/greek-pension-time-bomb-may-be-difficult-to-defuse-for-unwed-daughters.html ) . 
  [ another link on pensions ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/charlemagne/2010/02/greeces_generous_pensions ) . 
  yes , i know that you are starting to reform it , but after how many years ? 
  [ where greece is on the corruption list ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corruption_perceptions_index ) . 
  you do not get that low without it penetrating every aspect of society . 
  this is not the working of 1 % . 
  this is systematic failure by the society as a whole , and yes , the average greek did contribute to it . 
  perhaps they did n't think it would lead to this , perhaps they did n't think it was so bad , but to say the average greek did n't know , or never did anything is like saying a 200 kg chainsmoking man is taken by surprise when he has heart problem . 
  this might be the moral attitude someone was talking about in an earlier thread , but it does pisses me off when someone blatantly ignores fact and make themselves out to be completely innocent . 
  no , * a lot * of greeks contributed to bring greece down , and what is worse , if you continue to believe that this was the work of 1 % i do not think the situation in greece will ever improve , it takes soul searching and honesty for that . 
  we are not in the eurozone ( scandinavia ) . 
  in the oecd report it said that those who wished to reform the departments usually got shot down from within , so the change has to come from there . 
  i just do n't think the eu know how to pick the `` good guys '' , but i heard on our morning news that apparently greece had asked for outside help with the deparment reforms , but then you are villified as `` zee german '' / `` the dutch '' etc  nd while in spain they 'd only have to go through five or six different organizations to able to do it , in greece the number ended up close to thirty . 
  so everyone gets their cuts i assume and the public employees can multiply ? 
  i do n't see how anyone * but * the greeks can change that . 
  i do wish you good luck though , and hope it gets better . 
  you guys are having elections in april ... become a candidate :-), 
   i guess the tax system is very different . 
  the point i m trying to make is that the impact that has to everyday life is really catastrophic for the middle and low class . 
  well , it 's because you have been on a really , really low level . 
  although , i understand that it is not fun to get everything at once , particularely for the lower classes , i do think it reasonable to ask that you pay as much as everyone else . 
  i think you should be allowed to vote on the drachma/euro of course , but i think one problem you might not count on is that the rest of eu is getting tired too , and people are questioning why they should pay . 
  it might backpaddle in a ways you did n't imagine , germans demanding to vote on whether they should keep paying ... 
  honestly , i am not envious of you guys , but i do think the only ones who can fix it are the greeks themselves . 
  in the best of worlds a crises brings people together , and i think that is what you need . 
   the tax system is stupid and hostile and creates an antagonistic relationship between a business and the state . 
  well , reform it then , it 's not like the rest of europe are sitting on perfect systems either , and it is still no reason to cheat . 
  i do n't like our system all the time , it does n't make me cheat , it makes me complain :-) . 
   i hope i 'm wrong , that europe is more concerned with punishing those lazy greeks than with helping greece not suck as a european country . 
  it is hard not go get annoyed when i see protest against things we 've been having for ages , so why do people complain about things that the rest of europe have ( like starting paying taxes at $ 12 000 , i 'd love that , retire at 65 when we have 67 and counting , raising your vat to our level , etc ) ? 
  personally i do get irritated when i see that and honestly , why are you guys complaining about that ? 
  might be a `` moral view '' but do n't people have a right to question why you receive money , but not have our level of taxation ? 
  one things that also baffles me , and i think contributes to a `` moral superior '' view is that greece has n't protested these things before , when they benefited from a broken tax system , when the pension was based on the last five years etc. 
  that said , does it matter at this point ? 
  no , not really ( although i will argue to death if someone complains or says greece did n't do anything ) , and as you say , it starting to be besides the point .
