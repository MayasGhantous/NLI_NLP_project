  a ) the eurozone implement the ftt , and the traders will stay within the eurozone ( paris/frankfurt ) , even if they can move and avoid the tax elsewhere , like london/stockholm . the eurozone politely ask other countries if they want to join , and they are ok if no one else wants to join . 
  b ) we ( the world ) implement the ftt all across the world simultaniuosly , and everyone benefits from the ftt . 
  everyone has seen the value of the ftt , and are doing it to help europe 's failing economies . 
  i believe in : c ) the eurozone implements it , the trade will move , they will lose money and more lose of prestige and remove the tax . 
  before that though , they will bully ( or as you say , be diplomatic about it ) other countries to implement it to . 
  maybe small countries like mine have to obey , maybe not . 
  they will not get london , china , us , canada , australia , russia , japan , brazil along , no way . 
  if i got it wrong with a and b , please enlighten me to what you think will happen when you implement the ftt then . 
  have a nice evening . 
  well , you do n't have to , and if you do n't feel like it , the french one is the shortest . 
  it is just that you asked about the science behind my opposition towards the ftt . 
  do you have any science articles for me , being pro ftt ? 
  do you have any science articles about implementing a global tax , like you want to with china , japan , us ? 
  i really have n't found any about implementing global taxes , particularely while including dictatures so i am a bit curious how you plan to go about it . 
  ok , i thought about fogh rasmussen saying that you were going to vote on it again in 2007 , but you never did that , now that i think about it . 
  thanks, 
  did n't you vote yes to the euro ( swede here ) ? 
  are you going to vote again on the euro , or just on the additional deal ? 
  yes , each got to choose their favourite slide !, 
  here are some of the links you asked for , arguments against the ftt . 
  in case you do not have access at the moment to databases , i have chosen articles where you can just copy and paste it to google scholar . 
  [ finacial transitions tax .

  to say the least , it was even hard to find positive articles about the tobin tax , even when i tried to find any . 
  basically almost all of the articles i found were against it . 
  i am looking forward to your articles and papers including examples of what sweden did wrong , how china/us is going to bow to diplomatic pressure , how the scientist are wrong about the ftt and more issues that i am sure i have forgotten to mention . 
  have a nice evening . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/in-pictures-16090055 ) is a slide that illustrates what your professor what talking about ( the real exchange rate and export , the last one in the slideshow ) . 
  while i agree with that , i really do see this as only a part of the problem . 
  beggar thy neighbour did n't force greek corruption and low productivity , or the fact that almost no eurozone country lives up to * their own * rules , french banks etc. 
  it is one issue , yes , but certainly not the single cause of the crises . 
  you did bring up an interesting point though , thank you for the video . 
  i know , that is one of the many reasons that i do not want those taxes . 
   sweden has pledged to join the euro eventually and has participated and profited from the eu for decades . 
  sure , you were n't at the core of the problem , but we 're supposed to be in this together , right ? 
  if not , sweden can leave . 
  some of sweden 's politicians have already indicated that the parliament may well not give their approval to this agreement . 
  that is not what you said before you are changing the argument . 
  i quote `` the fact of the matter is that everyone fucked up , when we decided to open up our economies so much without providing some more integration '' . 
  we did not fuck up , and i have asked you to provide example of where sweden did that . 
  also , we have been paying netto since we joined , * while * battling a financial crises of our own , reforming a our pension system etc. 
  we did not receive any money from the eu then , which is perhaps better in the long run because we were forced to change . 
  second , we are in the ** eu ** together , not the ** euro ** . 
  and yes , we might not ever join the euro , but saying that we have to leave the eu , because we are not joining in with the euro , is plain bullying . 
  why ? 
  you have to separate those two . 
  and , sidenote , there is no way sweden is going near the euro at the moment . 
  a poll published today said a whopping 10 % of the population wants to join . . we have more people believing in martians . 
  third , we have not yet joined the euro , so we have not integrated the way you imply or the way eurozone countries have . 
  why do we then have to pay for the * eurozone 's * mistakes , not ours . 
  and , why do we have to pay in a way * you * decide ? 
  ( taxes not decided by us ) if the eurozone countries decide not to obey the rules they themselves set up , decide to rush into a fiscal union without solving the political problems first , to ignore underlying structural problems , to ignore incompatible economies , to ignore rampant corruption in some parts , the fact that they increase spending without any real growth etc - we did n't do that to you . 
  you did that . 
  you did not create our crises in the 90 's , we did not create yours now . 
  i am ok with transfers has to be done , but i am not ok with a single krona going towards corruption or so other countries do n't have to deal with their issues . 
  also , i am not ok with paying more than we already are . 
  that is what the eu want !, 
  and the money is going to cover for the deficit they were n't supposed to have in the first place !, 
  we are providing plasters to a patient who has cancer ...  they who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety , deserve neither liberty nor safety that is correct but i find it unrelated to the point . 
  good - then you are not forcing us in any way to implement ftt then ? 
  because doing that is would be clearly undemocratic , would n't it and forcing us to give up our freedom . 
  so , let us then pay what we currently pay and leave us alone then . 
  forcing issues upon us that has been caused by eurozone mismanagement is not very democratic , is it and i am glad you are agreeing with me on that . 
  what more , i do not believe china , japan , us * et al. 
  * is going to follow the eurozones lead , why should they . 
  you ca n't even get sweden , hungary etc to agree with you . 
  also , our finances is a lot better managed than the avarage eu/eurozone country and we do not want to hand over more power to you , or more money . 
  are you saying sarkozy is better at managing the finances than anders borg ? 
  i have never proposed to dismantle the eu , which you seem to imply but maybe the euro . 
  that is however , up to the euro-countries . 
  just ignore us , while you solve your problems.i do not see why i should pay for the saving of a currency i do not believe in . 
  it will affect us too , greatly , but it is better than throwing billions down the drain for decedes , which is what essentially has been done . 
  let the recession come then , perhaps that will force the necessary reforms . 
  last , long post , but of course i will provide you with links , i 'll just do that in next answer . 
  while i agree with you that economics is not the most reliable of sciences ( while i have read some economics , i am more of a science scientist myself ) i do tend to believe a lse professor more than some `` unknown '' ( in the nicest way possible ) arguing on the internet . 
  i 'd like you to provide me with scientific links too , as a base for your belief that china/us will join in and that the ftt will help . 
  have a nice evening, 
   it 's hard to have papers available that tell you stuff about large scale economics , simply because it 's hard to create meaningful experiments that deal with these complexities . 
  well , that 's why we have scientist , since everyone ca n't be an expert on everything . 
  i 's say that most economics scientist are against , it , but the eurozone is arguing for . 
  would you do that with other scientists ? 
  claiming that doctors are wrong , chemists do n't know what they are talking about . 
  admittedly , social sciences are more difficult to predict but that does n't mean we ca n't . 
  so , basically you and the eurozone are ignoring what science say because of faith . 
  and , yes , experiments has been done and they did n't turn out well . 
   also , how on earth , are you going to get china , japan , us , canada etc to obey , and not make money out of it ? 
  that 's a good point . 
  obviously , if everyone plays greedily in this scenario you end up with europe losing money and the others profiting from it . 
  but that 's like saying that if one country unilaterally outlaws slavery , then all others will profit from the extra workforce while that country 's economy suffers . 
  clearly , sometimes it is possible to get countries to cooperate for some joint good . 
  second , you ca n't ignore the fact that china , canada , etc are not playing with merkozy . 
  you have to solve that first , or the trading will just move . 
  china is not lying awake thinking of the greater good of europe you are saying taxes = good . 
  that is simply not true , not at all . 
  there are a million scenarios when this does n't hold true , more often than not i 'd say . 
  you are also saying that all of a sudden that all of the eurozone , that up until know have behaved irresponsibly , all of a sudden would turn around and act like selfless , good people , just wanting to help . 
  that is the most unlikely scenario i 've ever heard about . 
  so , italy is going to be free from corruption from now on . 
  no more billions down the drain ? 
   we did not fuck up the fact of the matter is that everyone fucked up , when we decided to open up our economies so much without providing some more integration .
