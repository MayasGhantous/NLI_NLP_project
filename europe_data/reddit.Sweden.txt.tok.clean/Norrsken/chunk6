  you have been defending the euro the whole time . 
  as long as you do , you * do * have to defend their support of corruption , and their bullying , and the fact that non - eurozone countries have to contribute towards the euro . 
  oh , and that they are using the ep to rally support for their causes . 
   all the latest models failed to predict the crisis . 
  there is no scientific base for any economic claim today . 
  there is only economic intuition . 
  no , not really . 
  one of the top argument in sweden against the euro was that the countries were to different , that it would lead to huge problems . 
  also , those who looked at the countries individually could see that the way the greeks go about it ca n't go on forever , it does crash at some point . 
  i do agree with you that economics is a tricky science . 
  there is however also the old `` common sense '' . 
  do n't borrow money yo ca n't pay back . 
  do overspend etc. 
   i think i can agree with you that we should n't be asking today for money of the whole of the eu . 
  well you are - that makes you corrupt assholes . 
  i am sorry to say it , but you are . 
  so , you ca n't claim/ask/do anything before you stop , but you will not , you will just keep asking us to pay for your corruption . 
  yet you want more . 
  why ? 
  why ca n't you stop ? 
  please explain why you are doing this ? 
  is n't the whle of the eu a failure if you are ruining it with taking our money , undemocratically , to save corrupt people ? 
   but letting it collapse is a even a worse solution than helping it on the short term you have absolutely no evidence for this , but i * do * have evidence for the fact that if we support them , we do support corruption and their early retirenment . 
  your argument is not valid , scientifically - sorry . 
   i study economic sciences in ghent and most of the professors here think we should save the euro today , most of the economics professors in sweden , uk and the us are saying godbye to greece . 
  does * anyone * of your professors defend greece , financially . 
  your professors are biased . 
  i can give you professors in sweden that says differently . 
  do you have any professors that defends the fact that you take eu money for the eurozone ? 
  how do you defend that ? 
  but you have n't answered this - you are using swedens money , for your failed currency . 
  how can you look yourself in the mirror - how can you be so corrupt . 
  why ? 
  please , answer that . 
  you might save your currency , but you have failed as countries and as humans if you have used money you are not allowed to in the process . 
  that alone disqualifies the euro , it is undemocratic and corrupt.answer this . 
   i think this is really the main point in the discussion . 
  i 'm not willing to sacrifice the euro indeed that is really what it comes down to . 
  you agree with me that greece is a real mess , corrupt , no industry , not willing to change etc ( you mentionend that htey have implemented * some * reforms , but failed to mention that it 's because of the immense pressure that they are under and b ) they have n't implemented most of the reforms they promised ) . 
  despite of that you want to keep on throwing money at them . 
  i think doing that is stupid , reckless , and not saving anything in the long run . 
  * but * , if you want to do it - please go ahead . 
  sponsor greek tax evaders to your dying days if that is what you want , run your economy in the ground because you ca n't control italy . 
  just do it . 
  everyone goes to hell in their own way i suppose . 
  what you are * not * allowed to do , but keep on doing anyway is putting pressure on us to participate . 
  claiming eu money for helping the * eurozone * . 
  you , and * a lot * of other people have been doing that . 
  there 's immensense pressure that we * should help out * - why . 
  the only reason is to save a completely ill thought of pet project of some countries who are willing to sacrifise sense and finances and sponsor corruption just not to loose face or actually go back and redesign it so it works . 
  that is beyond stupid . 
  the imf wants more money , the eu wants more money ( the ep had the audacity to suggest we should pay more , since they need more ) , you keep on claiming that we have to help out . 
  the * eu * is creating projets to help out on situations caused by the * eurozone * . 
  you have no right to do it - it 's not only financially reckless ( they way you are doing this have actually manage to get a lot of swedes not only to question the euro , but the eu ) , but undemocratic and * corrupt * . 
  the money were n't given to the eu to be used by the eurozone . 
  you are corrupting the whole of the eu , just because * you * have a pet project and want to pay for greece for the forseeable future . 
  the eurozone is corrupting the eu more . 
  you have no right to do it , yet , you are dragging us down with you . 
  i am rather willing at the moment , to leave the eu . 
  no use hanging around corruption , handing over money to non - democratic projects.no one , can even offer a half assed solution to anything , as long as you keep on demanding to save the euro . 
  oh , and honestly , go to r/economics , read check out wall street journal , ft , economist or other newspaper . 
  everyone is agreeing that saving greece is financially stupid , the euro is ill thought through and the only reason to save it is so it does n't spread . 
  i say - let it . 
  the euro is stupid and it 's corrupting the eu . 
   does 50 % of the greeks evade taxes ? 
  yes , of course . 
  i have links of course to the dire situation , here are some : [ 6 out of 10 greeks do n't pay taxes ] ( http://articles.cnn.com/2010-12-31/world/greece.taxes_1_income-taxes-greek-press-tax-evasion?_s=pm:world ) . 
  [ link 1 ] ( http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_gb/features/setimes/features/2012/02/04/feature-02 ) [ link 2 ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financialcrisis/8585593/greece-loses-15bn-a-year-to-tax-evasion.html ) , [ link 3 ] ( http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/story/2012-01-29/tax-evaders-greece-spain-italy/52822942/1 ) . 
  honestly , i can sit and give you links all day about the rampant corruption , but i hope you notice that they also mentions spain , portugal and italy . 
  i have n't even started about that everyone writes down their income ( so they do n't have to pay ) , when they retiered ( after 30 years , or at 60 , with 95 % of the salary of the last 5 years ) . 
  it is * everywhere * so no one is doing anything about it . 
  so , again , why should my money go there ? 
  you ca n't give me proof that they have changed , bcause they have not . 
   i do n't want greece to get the money to be able to keep paying way too high pensions to 62 year olds . 
  maybe not as high anymore , but pensions - yes , you pay for that . 
  while 25 % of the greek economy is a shadow economy ( and not taxed of course ) . 
  that number has increased btw , so i think they are actually doing the opposite , they are digging themselves deeper into the hole . 
   i want europe to help greece set up a stimulus plan . 
  job creation via infrastructure and labour subsidies . 
  europe have been doing that since the joined in the 80 's . 
  who the xxx do you think paid for the ( before it was basically free , no one ever checked ) subway in athens ? 
  who has paid for their generous benefits . 
  they have four times as many school teachers as finland ( but just double the poplation ) , yet , most children need extra teaching to pass . 
  how ? 
  honestly , do you think they have n't received all that before ? 
  if they receive a simulus plan , do you think they will go - oh , now i 'd love to start paying taxes . 
  it 's a cultural thing , they do not do that . 
  as i said - change first . 
  again , throwing good money after bad ... . .  they need to get their economy back on track . 
  i do n't know if it ever were on track really . 
  what companies do they have ? 
  they have their shipping industry ( down 27 % in last 10 years ) , tourism ( down as well ) , and then what ? 
  a lot of super small businesses . 
  yet , they have increased their salaries with 40 % in the last 10-15 years , compare that to germany . 
  they should have been building up industries , but did n't . 
  they are not going to do it now . 
   not giving it away but lending it , at a decent interest rate that is higher than the inflation ( maybe 4 % , max 5 % ) . 
  you do that . 
  our finance minister has said no , they are not even doing the things they promised to do in the * first * bailout . 
  we would rather invest ours/pay off our own debt etc.
