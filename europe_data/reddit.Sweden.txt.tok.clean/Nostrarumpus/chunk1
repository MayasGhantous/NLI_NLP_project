yeah , i remember back when i went to high school we were way over 10 % but we studied music so that * might * have had something to do with it, 
  it really is , it literally is n't worth it, 
  iceland is just canada in disguise ... 
  pfft , southerners ... 
  run . 
  luckily we are n't very religious so we do n't have to love the bastards , 
  you are now a moderator of / r/sweden, 
  good for them !, 
  ouch, 
  except that we have to hear about it every damn day on both the television and internet ... 
  `` lego is dumb '', 
  that 's a great reply , thanks for clearing some shit up mate !, 
  it not over until the anti-corruption law is put back right ? 
  westside fo lyfe, 
  a drop of sweat, 
  good kitty ? 
  i vote to kick / r/uk off reddit and that the united states pays for a paywall so between the uk and europe !, 
  / s but seriously , neat map, 
  `` it 's unnatural , i read it on the internet ! '', 
  because facebook grows on trees ... 
  give it some time and it 'll get better , estonia has evolved amazingly quick since you guys separated from russia !, 
  same thing in sweden , especially on raw meat, 
  the things we do for europe ... 
  love me some blue cheese on digestives with wine hnngh i 'm starting to crave !, 
  i 'm glad you guys got your independence and do n't have to suffer through that again , jesus fucking hell man, 
  i 'm not bummed about losing when we are doing a good job !, 
  good on you netherlands , and i hear canada is doing good as well !,

  disclaimer : i 'm not responsible for any sexual thoughts about culinary arts you may experience, 
  do n't forget the fries edit : seriously , a `` skrov '' is a double-hamburger with fries and soda , this meal is called a `` calskrove '' as kind of a pun on calzone since it 's a fused calzone and skrov, 
  sera approves, 
  [ the special ] ( http://cdn08.dayviews.com/31/_u9/_u7/_u0/_u9/u97091/50407_1226110450.jpg ) in my hometown, 
  it 's something to take great * pride * in , 
  that 's fucked up, 
  heh , suck it denmark !, 
  probably because we are n't very religious i bet , but even most religious people do n't care, 
  it 's not what hans would have wanted, 
  right ? 
  i remember it being mentioned several times in school in the same sentence as `` barbaric '' , / u/z1atan should go to denmark and eat p\u00f8lse, 
  that 's a whole lot more than one would suspect it 's fucked up is what it is, 
  that 's a bummer , but at least the flag is a big plus, 
  huh , i suppose that 's fair, 
  i feel i 'm too intrigued not to, 
  not again ... 
  that 's pretty cool , it 's fun that the japanese are helping, 
  estonia , finland and norway . 
  that 's some pretty solid countries to merge with, 
  what about assault ? 
  huh , i did n't know about that !, 
  any specific art pieces or cool artifacts to look up ? 
  the food is good and they mention that they do n't like sweden in their national anthem also cheap vodka, 
   denmark  austria  france  sweden satan i helvetet ... 
  their hands are normal , it 's great , trust me, 
  that 's true , idk why then . 
  but the eastern countries does have slightly higher numbers than the more western, 
  i 'm guessing the question was made to sound like we were fighting an invading country we do n't want none of that shit, 
  the soviet union was a big scare and nobody wanted to be a part that so i guess that would be a big reason, 
  i was gon na say `` hope this does n't come to sweden '' but i 've only been to one place that gives free refills lol, 
  hopefully before that , uk was a big player in the eu and it would probably do both unions good to get back together, 
  good to know , thanks neighbour !, 
  where are you going estonia ? 
  `` abortugal '' is the best lol, 
  country ? 
  czech . 
  name ? 
  czech . 
  you could always come back ... jk , estonia seems to be doing pretty darn well compared to the rest of europe so do n't worry about it friend !, 
  i remember eating grilled meat and bread that was absolutely delicious when i was in poland , that was 8 years ago though so i do n't remember too much food was good anyway, 
  i mean , this is a post about how many citizens sweden has , so i 'd say it 's the former, 
  i remember not too long ago when finland was on top, 
  started to worry for a minute there ... 
  definitely , i do n't really think much of beauty pageants but she probably does and it must 've been fun to win . 
  good on her . 
  i personally prefer 7 & 9 though lol, 
  i wish, 
  [ this one ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/bandiera_dello_stato_della_sicilia_%2828.04.1848_-_15.05.1849%29.png ) is my favorite, 
  too few people do that though , in every country :(, 
  you know something 's odd when the internet is the most trusted media, 
  i did n't even know about this so i had to look it up  we 'll cross the vistula and the warta , we shall be polish . 
   bonaparte has given us the example , of how we should prevail . 
   march , march ...  like czarniecki to pozna\u0144 , after the swedish occupation ,  to save our homeland , we shall return across the sea . 
  they do n't seem to like us very much ... 
  well anyway , the biggest party is the social democrats , then the moderate party , sweden democrats , environmental party , center party , leftist party , liberal peoples party , christ democrats and lastly the feminist initiative . 
  [ votes in the last election ] ( http://www.val.se/val/val2014/slutresultat/r/rike/ ), 
  and it ended way before 2010, 
  hey man , it 's just a joke slogan do n't worry about it, 
  on second thought i might just stay with the non-judgemental blonde women !, 
  and portugal here i come !, 
  at least iceland will go to prom with us !, 
  1 . it is a place 2 . it exists ( i think , it might be `` a fucking fairytale '' ), 
  and that = large nipples ? 
  very good analysis ( i think , idk lol ) . 
  in my anecdotal experience the areolas have tended to be smaller though that might be coincidence lol anyway , we 're wondering about irish ones since that seems to be a prejudice latvians have about irish men and women . 
  thanks !, 
  you 're kidding right ? 
  same here buddy ^ ^ suck ^ ^ it ^ ^ finland, 
  they are n't ?
