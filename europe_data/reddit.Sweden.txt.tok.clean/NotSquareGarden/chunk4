  who 's gon na force women to pop out more babies , because it does n't seem like we 're too interested in doing it volontarily . 
  [ here 's the full text .

  yes , we should return to `` natural '' gender roles . 
  so called because they were true between 1890 and 1960 in the upper middle class . 
  second wave feminists were struggling to break into the workplace and out of the home , and they looked down on people who did n't . 
  remnants of that still remain , even if the third wave has made feminism a lot more inclusive . 
  iceland elected an anti-eu government and the talks have been suspended . 
  they 're not gon na join in the forseeable future . 
  i was reading the youtube comments on the video . 
  most of them seem to be americans attacking the us government . 
  it really is amazing how many americans seem to be buying this bullshit . 
  they really do have a hardon for hating every single thing their government does to the point where they 're willing to support any government called not-the united states . 
  not today , but on the 20th we did . 
  by drinking alcohol and dancing around a maypole and us girls putting flowers in our hair . 
  it 's a nice holiday . 
  you want a return of the warsaw pact ? 
  seriously ? 
  go tell that to the poles . 
  i 'm sure they 'll love the idea of russia returning to take away all of their civil rights , again . 
  what the fuck is even the point of that argument ? 
  all borders are artificial , there was someone who drew them at one point or another . 
  it 's funny how a majority of these anti-americans are willing to use chelsea manning in their hate but do n't even have the common decency of using her actual name or her preferred pronouns . 
  yes , all of us who view the us in a positive way are shills . 
  i for example get paid in pure gold shekels for believing that the us ' military presence here in europe is a good thing for peace . 
  how big is the chance that the spanish royal family will survive this whole crisis ? 
  hopefully we 'll be able to integrate the roma better than other european countries , since there have n't been a lot of roma here historically so there 's not as much racism and cultural division as in other places . 
  the roma in america are doing perfectly fine , so it 's not like it 's an impossible task , either . 
  that 's not what 's being discussed here . 
  the * reason * for why our laws are the way they ard is what we are talking about . 
  alcohol is taxed to all hell because it 's an absolutely massive cost to society . 
  we also do not have an alcohol problem right now ; but before the monopoly , we were some of the heaviest drinkers in the world , and that was of course an issue . 
  the intention of the gender free preschools was to allow kids to find their own identity and not force something down their throats , which preschools have a long history of doing . 
  what the hell is neo-marxism ? 
  our system is n't exactly going closer to workers controlling the means of production , so it can not possibly be anything related to marxism . 
  a tiny percentage of the norse population , even in the viking age were actually vikings . 
  oh , and , swedish men do n't live up to your ideals of masculinity ? 
  sweden democrats are n't being harassed left right and center if you believe so . 
  there are a few limited cases of bad things happening to them , yes , and that 's really sad . 
  but you have to remember that they 're a party who 's leadership thought it was a wonderful idea to run around the streets with iron pipes . 
  lastly , you want our government to arrest people for quoting internet comments ? 
  that sounds a bit weird . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  [ the referendum ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_prohibition_referendum,_1922 ) on prohibition failed by about 30 000 votes back in the day . 
  the alcohol monopoly and almost ridiculous taxation ( which still does n't pay for the cost of alcohol to society ) has certainly helped , though . 
  i disagree . 
  as i said , previous inquiries had found that sex trade does n't involve two equal parties as is the case in the imaginary fairytale of the pro-prostitution camp but it 's a market that exploits the seller . 
  literally no one has ever said that when arguing for the current law . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.regeringen.se/content/1/c6/11/66/01/6b8150e3.pdf ) the actual reasoning for it , from the government itself . 
  the basics of it is : sex trade is unacceptable since it 's incompatible with freedom and gender equality . 
  it puts the seller , often a woman , in a position where she is being exploited by mostly men . 
  that view is based on earlier government studies on the issue . 
  the previous studies also found that prostitution often led to other crimes being commited . 
  the main concern for them seems to be human trafficking . 
  so , because of this , prostitution must be reduced and then eliminated . 
  they want to hit the demand side of sex trade since they view it as a form of exploitation while they do n't view the selling of sex as a crime . 
  lastly , they report that sex trade has shrunk by 50 % since the ban was introduced in 1999 and that public support for the current law is at around 70 % . 
  so no , it has fuck all to do with sexual purity . 
  we 're a very sex positive people and i think you know this . 
  to several people they are n't morally innocent . 
  morality is really not as simple as you portray it here . 
  they would 've built more schools with marshall aid . 
  but what happened to that ? 
  oh , right , the soviets denied it . 
  i would assume that that 's easier with an erect dick ? 
  easier to aim , plus you can control it a bit more without using hands . 
  i do n't know though , since i do n't have a dick . 
  having to use two hands to point a dick would actually be terrible . 
  that shit would probably be really painful . 
  anyway , what do you do with the other hand ? 
  send text messages ? 
  i always thought guys kinda used both hands when they stood up and peed . 
  perhaps lenin was a revolutionary in terms of standing pissing as well ? 
  america ? 
  socialism ? 
  what the hell are you smoking , dude ?

  are you fucking kidding me ? 
  the us gave up its dictator supporting sphere building 30 years ago or so . 
  as you can see , when the us intervenes nowadays , they set up democracies . 
  if the us accepted totalitarian regimes in eastern europe to nato , then they would of course join the totalitarian regimes of ... of ... nothing . 
  there 's no precendence for your accusations . 
  besides , i would imagine that joining nato requires more than the us say-so . 
  [ here , all you had to do was google for like 5 seconds . 
  ] ( http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/03/01/284345466/russias-parliament-prepared-to-authorize-crimea-intervention ), 
  russia has no right to its sphere of influence . 
  besides , it 's not like nato will make you a puppet of anyone . 
  it 's a military alliance , nothing else . 
  you do know that the russian duma authorized the use of military force in crimea , right ? 
  it was n't exactly a secret thing . 
  \u00c5land , we 're coming for you . 
  finland gib now !, 
  when did students start paying education taxes ? 
  when did the sick start paying sick taxes ? 
  also , road taxes probably do n't cover nearly all road spending in any country . 
  i 'd be really surprised if they did . 
  well , how is it ? 
  if you could argue that that 's oppression then all taxing is oppression . 
  `` when motorists vote to increase highway spending and taxes because of it , does the constitution protect the ones who do n't use roads ? '', 
  taxes to increase healthcare spending is oppression of the healthy , taxes to increase education spending is oppression of adults etc.
