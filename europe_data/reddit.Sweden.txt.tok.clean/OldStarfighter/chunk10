  so some random lithuanian says he know sweden better than a swede . 
   oh sorry for being post-communist country , my fault . 
   there is literally no country in europe outside russia and it 's slaves that would want european army instead of nato . 
  however , the same lithuanian had an audacity to claim ** his ** opinion is the one of his entire country and even eu while being one of the most insignificant of all countries in it . 
  alrighty then . 
  sweden says hello . 
  if i might ask . 
  what is the actual picture ? 
  aka which flavor of propaganda do you prefer ? 
  because unless you 're obama \\ putin \\ merkel \\ erdogan \\ etc. 
  you ca n't possibly know a thing about the `` actual picture '' . 
  except when it 's russians we call them putinbots . 
  when it 's serbs - they 're nazi \\ puting lovers . 
  with turks and ukrainians it 's all fine , it 's just their perspective . 
  brigading is very clear in this subreddit and it 's coming from many sources . 
   su-24s do n't come cheap , you know . 
  actually they do . 
  an aircraft at the end of its life-cycle with a limited combat application . 
  it 's a heavy clumsy bomber with virtually no anti-air defenses , nowadays suited for nothing but fighting desert dwellers with no or limited aa capability like unguided aaa or manpads . 
  easy kill for any jet or sam . 
  it 's amazing how many turks we suddenly have in / r/europe and / r/worldnews , is n't it ? 
  they have appeared all over the place somewhere around november . 
  interesting coincidence . 
  still bold while hiding behind nato skirt , i see . 
  well yea . 
  i mean , the best example would be north korea , food shortages they had not so long ago were in most cases a direct consequence of sanctions . 
  sanctions are literally made to force people to overthrow their government , never worked though . 
  if it did n't work with cuba and nk , then it will do nothing for russia . 
  a few people will be pissed , some will suffer , some will profit but it wont affect politicians in a bit . 
  attempting to `` force a democracy '' will only cause people to reject it as something imposed on them by a foreign entity rather than their own social achievement . 
  [ congratulations ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgdpuxubbye ), 
   for instance let 's look at mh17 . 
  russian media flat out rejects the dutch investigation . 
  it chooses to instead spout insane theories with zero backing . 
  one of my favorites is blaming it on the jews . 
  rt literally blamed an israeli missile . 
  and not a surface to air missile that could be explained away as a weapons sale fallen into the wrong hands , but an air to air missile . 
  rt blamed an israeli fighter pilot for shooting down mh17 . 
  when in doubt blame the jews i guess . 
  can you link those articles ? 
  because even rt is n't that stupid . 
  or is it just something you heard from someone ? 
   let 's look at the chemical attacks in syria . 
  many of the russian posters on here still think it was the rebels . 
  you may wonder why given the un findings . 
  it might surprise you to know the un findings did not really make it into russian media . 
  to this day russian media refutes the findings by the un by running conspiratorial stories not backed by anything but conjecture . 
  except [ the un report ] ( http://www.un.org/disarmament/content/slideshow/secretary_general_report_of_cw_investigation.pdf ) is n't pointing on government forces directly . 
  they only say that the one who did it had access to the stockpiles of the said chemical weapons . 
  considering the fact how many of those fell into `` opposition '' hands they abstained from formally blaming either side . 
  but ofc the official propaganda media in eu only says that attacks were conducted by using sarin from saa stockpiles while at the same time rt is pressing the matter of the gas stockpiles falling into `` opposition '' hands . 
  and neither is lying really . 
  so basically [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/s0dneed.jpg ) . 
  and whose pawn are you ? 
  ... or wait . 
  surely you are the individual with his own thoughts , totally not brainwashed by any propaganda , yours and yours only worldview is the right and true . 
  everyone else out there is just a brainwashed zombie . 
  / s i wonder if you ever considered a possibility that people are down-voting an outright bs rather than supporting russia ? 
  hivemindish , simplistic worldviews which can be categorized as `` us vs them '' or `` good vs bad '' are as false as they 're widespread . 
  i see / r/conspiracy is leaking again, 
  it makes perfect sense since turkey is blackmailing us with refugees . 
  it 's literally `` comply or we 'll flood you with poor and hungry '' . 
   it 's only normal for a military ship to fire a warning shot . 
  standard procedure really . 
  especially after what happened with [ uss cole ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uss_cole_bombing ), 
  i guess you do it regularly . 
  i heard you have plenty of cheap oil around . 
  dat cheap oil does wonders to economy !, 
  new blockbuster : poland can into space !, 
  yet we managed to stay out of all questionable military alliances . 
  before uneducated rednecks twisted the meaning of term `` the third world '' we were considered a third world country , non aligned with either the us or soviets . 
  of course political neutrality is hard to achieve but not military . 
  though , unfortunately , it 's changing rapidly in the recent years . 
  50 years of propaganda are finally affecting peoples perception of the world . 
  i dread the day we will be dragged into nato . 
  that will make us 100 % accountable for all its squabbling and reckless schemes . 
  most of the conflicts you mentioned are either internal russian matter or ex-soviet wars usually triggered by ethnic animosity with which russia has little to do in the first place . 
  it 's not even close to invading , taking over and turning into rubble entire countries . 
   but what do you swedes know , you dont know anything how it was to live under russian rule or how it is when they attack you , go and ask finns about how '' peaceful '' russians are to their neighbors . 
  bringing up the winter war ? 
  remember germans from the same time period ? 
  they 're now your allies . 
  i hate to break it to you but compared to nato , russians are peaceful people . 
  your alliance is constantly engaged in some action . 
  not to mention nato is inherently anti-russian alliance since it was formed against ussr . 
  not to mention every time russians want to to work with you guys , [ they 're being told to gtfo ] ( http://www.eurodialogue.eu/osce/nato-rejects-russian-missile-defense-proposal ) . 
  do you , honestly believe that nato is here and always was not against ussr \\ russia ? 
  how can you accept your enemy ? 
  and this is why i hope swedish politicians will never go full retard and join nato . 
  say what ? 
  what does they have to do with anything ? 
  poland and romania are parts of nato and eu . 
  my point is that every side is retarded . 
   they still act like 18th century tsarist russia , there is no justification for that fox news ( c ) version, 
  i do believe this practice of `` keeping russia under control '' is root of the problem . 
  we `` keep them under control '' , they see what we 're doing and responding in the same demented manner . 
  after the fall of ussr one hoped that we 'll finally be able to see a normal relations with russia . 
  and yet over the course of 25 years i heard nothing but `` russian barbarians '' type of nonsense . 
  i remember their first president , drunkard foll he was but he was friendly fool . 
  we laughed at him and always gave russians short end of the stick .
