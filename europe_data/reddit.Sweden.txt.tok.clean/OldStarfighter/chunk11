  i do believe in sweden we still have lots of people noticed in war crimes during chechen war but the general narrative back then was that chechens are good , russians bad and never gave them away to russians . 
  putin has been exploiting our own attitude towards russian for the last 15 years . 
  as any tyrant he promises to protect his citizens against aggressors , nato as military threat and the us as economic . 
  and it 's really easy to believe because if you keep giving someone a short end of the stick do n't expect much love in return . 
   but i 'm optimistic about ukraine . 
  i 'm not . 
  as long as they 're blaming each and every of their failings on russia , they will stay locked in this perpetual state of keeping appearances and when something bad inevitably would come out they routinely proclaim `` russia did it '' and continue in the same manner till next time . 
  i mean seriously . 
  anti-corruption reforms ? 
  they have placed [ one of the most corrupt politicians of our time ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mikheil_saakashvili#legal_prosecution ) on a position of governor . 
  no , thank you . 
  seriously . 
  stop trying to drag sweden in your alliances . 
  200 hundred years and people still unable to understand what `` neutral '' means . 
  nothing like politically sensetive articles in [ ukrainian wikipedia ] ( https://uk.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%d0%92%d0%be%d0%bb%d0%b8%d0%bd%d1%81%d1%8c%d0%ba%d0%b0_%d1%82%d1%80%d0%b0%d0%b3%d0%b5%d0%b4%d1%96%d1%8f&amp;action=history ) , right ? 
  i somehow doubt it 's real or actual full story . 
  if they 'll start doing it en masse , they 'd get a major public disturbance and you ca n't have that before elections . 
  if it 's one soldier only , the amount of money they 'd save is negligible compared to the entirety of their spendings . 
  i wonder if in 30 years it will be revealed that all of this was just another plot to bring russia down . 
  just like they did with oil prices in 80s to break ussr economy . 
  and then they ask why swedes are such a passive , whiny bunch . 
  it 's not only that . 
  if you 're the one who controls this centralized system , you control news and information . 
  no more independent news sites . 
  so i guess the biggest and the 2nd largest armies in the world are not enough to defeat a bunch of armed thugs . 
   russia is n't soviet union . 
  only one that have the ability to do that now is usa . 
  i 'm sure they still have enough nukes to obliterate everything . 
  maybe not 10 times over as ussr but still enough . 
   turkish army is the second most powerful armed force in nato turkey is n't even in top 5 in armed forces strength . 
  ofc no one can compete with the us but turkey is not the us . 
  if turkey will continue to act in the same manner then i would n't be sure the us will rush to the rescue . 
  then again . 
  turkey knows well that such a war would be an economic disaster for all involved sides no matter who 'd win . 
  so [ this picture ] ( http://i.imgur.com/d2okjuj.gif ) is a perfect representation of russia - turkey relations at the moment . 
  except one is a megalomaniac with ability to turn the world into ash and another is just a delusional megalomaniac hiding behind nato skirt . 
  eu bent over in front of turkish blackmail . 
  we ; re giving them money and all lots of political support in return for them keeping their border closed . 
  they 're practically extorting us and if we wo n't play along they 'll keep sending refugees until we 'll agree to their terms . 
  our politicians turned out to be completely useless in solving any complex issues . 
  iraq can ask russians to help in taking out garbage as well . 
  link to an article which is politically significant in ukrainian wikipedia ? 
  article which is seemingly under constant [ editing lately ] ( https://uk.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%d0%92%d0%be%d0%bb%d0%b8%d0%bd%d1%81%d1%8c%d0%ba%d0%b0_%d1%82%d1%80%d0%b0%d0%b3%d0%b5%d0%b4%d1%96%d1%8f&amp;action=history ) . 
  seriously ? 
  and we 're not talking about `` poland regularly did really bad stuff '' , we 're talking about one particular person . 
  the person which collaborated with nazis willingly , massacred civilian non-combatants , was leader of the organization responsible for what today we 'd call ethnic cleansing . 
  and especially this [ part ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/massacres_of_poles_in_volhynia_and_eastern_galicia ) . 
  sasquatch is also a `` common knowledge '' . 
  or maybe because he failed to provide any source to this claim . 
  just like any respectable ghetto resident . 
   and those nations have n't had strife against each other in living memory . 
  erm ... first and second world wars ? 
  70 years in historic perspective is practically yesterday . 
  great question . 
  i noticed a while ago how seemingly every busted gangster from the cis countries suddenly becomes a `` politically oppressed '' opposition demanding an asylum in sweden or other eu countries . 
  and at least in case of sweden , bureaucracy of granting or denying asylum is so slow that person can stay here for years awaiting for decision . 
  totally putinbots and not because his opinion is a bloody nonsense . 
   according to article , they never entered polish territory so ** it 's irrelevant for the initial topic ** . 
  wow , that 's hardcore trolling . 
  it 's war games . 
  according to article , they never entered polish territory so it 's irrelevant for the initial topic . 
  every war game has an enemy with distinct territory and features , military simply using imaginary names most of the time to avoid those situations . 
  but it again proves the fact that russians do n't give a shit ... and love to troll those who 're crying wolf all the time for 25 years . 
   simulating fucking nuclear attacks on warsaw . 
  u wot m8 ? 
  it 's [ fsa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/free_syrian_army ) . 
  it 's their flag . 
  i 'm pretty sure there are no more fools left to fly a passenger plane over a war zone . 
   consider if the us would send its troops to ukraine to fight with the so called rebels and downs a russian warplane that 's violating ukraines airspace briefly . 
  that would be a huge issue . 
  no it would n't ( i mean it would ofc but no different from syria-russia-turkey incident ) as long as ukrainian government officially asked for assistance . 
  they most likely wo n't . 
  especially after the whole mh17 disaster but it can still be a political chip in the game . 
  syria is still a sovereign state . 
  russia is there legally so ... 
  i do n't see any difference . 
  plus russians can just gift a few s-400 to syrians . 
  full version oh his interview is much more interesting . 
  [ this part especially ] ( https://youtu.be/2tz1knk5v38?t=297 ) - basically he says that if russian s-400 will down a turkish plane in syrian airspace it will be an act of aggression . 
  hypocrisy is strong with this one . 
   yes neutrality means handing real war refugees back to opressive totalitarian state where they died in work camps . 
  again . 
  why should it concern us ? 
  if you 'll go into `` evil orks enslaved poor estonian elves '' then you probably need to revise history books . 
  in addition , being neutral also means not attempting to pass judgement who 's `` good '' and who 's `` bad '' . 
   i 've been to sweden multiple times over the last few years , luckily you are the minority among swedes . 
  most swedes are normal people . 
  i 'm pretty sure you 've been socializing with either brainwashed by propaganda or very young swedes . 
  and those are minority . 
  especially if you 'll get out of stockholm , it tends to attract bleeding heart `` humanists '' for some reason . 
  i 'm not defending russia . 
  i 'm saying that trusting turkey while erdogan still in power is not only foolish but also dangerous . 
  turkey is part of nato . 
  if other nato members would openly disagree on this with turkey the whole alliance would fall apart starting with turkey . 
  by whom ? 
  russians ? 
  this cold war nonsense that certain countries are keep pushing down our throats for the last 50 years is nothing but fear mongering to drag us in nato to participate in your petty conflicts . 
   would n't be the first time finnish blood has been shed to protect the king of sweden . 
  do n't flatter yourself . 
  unless people will go full retard we 'll keep doing things the way we do them for the last 200 years .
