  but i can also understand their weariness towards nato . 
   russia is a nation , that uses its military as a tool of aggression , to invade , annex and destabilize neighbouring countries and nato do n't ? 
  ( maybe except annexation ), 
  nato is an organization which is inherently anti-russian as it was created `` to contain the soviet threat '' , soviets are gone , nato is still here . 
  russians are the closest thing to soviets we have now . 
  and let 's be realistic , russians are the only real thorn in the side of our certain `` allies '' . 
   most swedes do n't want anything to do with nato membership ? 
  unfortunately decades of fear-mongering and propaganda ( like the show they managed to put in while searching that imaginary `` russian sub '' which then turned out to be some fishing boat on a blurry photo ) are finally taking its toll and some swedes want to ditch our traditional neutrality . 
  i do n't think it 'll piss russia off either way . 
  what would it be for them ? 
  nothing but another prearranged target in a missile barrage in case something would go wrong ? 
  at this point it does n't matter anyway . 
  conventionally nato already can overwhelm russia if it 'll want to . 
  it will cost a lot for nato countries but it 's silly to think russia can stand against the entirety of nato therefore at any conflict it can end only one way - nukes , and i 'm talking about big ones . 
  but our politicians seems to like `` to piss russia off '' even if russia does n't care . 
  makes them feel important . 
  it always fascinated me how poland seems to know russia better than the russia itself . 
  they always sound so sure about their conclusions . 
  it 's about pissing off russia , not common sense or military strategy . 
   yes . 
  amazing . 
  all the dutch people apparently think they 're a politician as a side job . 
  yes . 
  amazing . 
  people think about politics as their day job . 
  that 's why we have too many career politicians and ca n't have good things . 
  edit : word, 
  ok . let 's imagine for a second there is no veto right in the security counsel . 
  and a few countries which are historically having an outright hostile relationship with russia decided that russia is guilty . 
  then what ? 
  veto or no veto it 's a delusion of the highest order to think russia , or any other country at that , will give a damn about some political rhetoric or decision made by some foreign entities pushing for their own political agendas . 
  what are you going to do ? 
  go to war with russia ? 
  you 're welcome to try but do n't expect many to stand with you . 
  this is unfortunate that most people do n't seem to realize or care about what 's going on around . 
  same tricks as 80 years ago to manipulate and form public opinion on everything . 
  i believe it 's mostly due to the state of modern education system and especially the way history is being taught , it 's twisted in the way suited for the current political situation with no end goal of teaching facts about past events objectively . 
  those who do n't know history are destined to repeat it - a very simple and know principle is all but forgotten nowadays . 
  remind me again . 
  why are we allowing refugees ? 
  why do we care anyway ? 
  people who instead of solving their problems are running away in hopes of leaching of some other countries welfare system . 
  i see the future !, 
  it will be a report stating the obvious with lots of vague conclusions which will be bent and twisted by every politician in the world . 
  yes ~ ~ comrade ~ ~ , ut is the only true source of unbiased news and opinions . 
  it 's exactly about who to blame . 
  there is no other explanation why it was cooked for over a year if `` everything is so obvious '' . 
   when a word is ` misused ' a lot , it becomes the meaning of it . 
  it 's merely a sign of a poor education system . 
  i know . 
  but it 's still not fascism . 
  the word is widely misused nowadays . 
   fascism [ eugenics ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eugenics ) , it 's called eugenics . 
  anti-gay does n't mean fascist . 
   there are three kinds of lies : lies , damned lies , and statistics . 
  i love how often we 're getting polls portraying people in the countries * we do n't like today * as animals . 
  [ atrocity propaganda ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/atrocity_propaganda ) at its best , joseph goebbels would be proud . 
   likely really ? 
  is it the best you can do ? 
  `` likely '' ? 
   if people will try to out putin he will lose his position and will be replaced by someone else . 
  i somehow seriously doubt it . 
  especially considering the fact that russian government tends to brand everyone who do n't agree a foreign agent and any real opposition is driven away and choked . 
  and yet . 
  in many cases immigrants live in their little communities . 
  even here we have russian stores , chinese communities , etc. 
  so i believe that in most cases it 's rather economical reasons than cultural . 
  it does n't matter if he 's loved right now . 
  [ dictator ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dictator ) - ** a dictator is a ruler who wields absolute authority . 
  ** ... ** in modern usage , the term `` dictator '' is generally used to describe a leader who holds and/or abuses an extraordinary amount of personal power , especially the power to make laws without effective restraint by a legislative assembly . 
  ** dictatorships are often characterized by some of the following traits : suspension of elections and of civil liberties ; proclamation of a state of emergency ; rule by decree ; ** repression of political opponents without abiding by rule of law procedures ; these include single-party state , and cult of personality . 
  are you saying he 's not a dictator ? 
  hmm . 
  really ? 
  i had no idea . 
  i knew notch is a swede but for some reason thought mojang is based in the us . 
   western europe is just so much more cool than the rest of the world . 
  * for europeans . 
  many benefits of the `` western '' society are very much heritable and it 's quiet unlikely that an immigrant will ever stand on the same step of the social ladder or will be able to enjoy the same quality of life as locals . 
  even his children in the first generation are unlikely to fare any better . 
  breaking news !, 
   alexander lukashenko ** ` europe 's last dictator ' ** what about putin ? 
  russia is in europe too . 
  it 's not only germany though . 
  yet estonian politicians are constantly trying to play the ukraine 2.0 card in order to get some leverage and money . 
  why minecraft ? 
  til : the media lies, 
   russia :   is russia part of europe   is russia in europe   is russia in asia or europe   is russia part of europe or asia it 's amazing how hard it is for people to comprehend that russia is both europe and asia . 
   is sweden in the euro zone / ** a model of sustainable development ** ? 
  sure . 
  asking in any social media is incorrect place . 
  they 're discussing nothing . 
  they 're spilling plain propaganda on each other . 
  it 's not even funny anymore . 
  i 'd love to see the comparison in % of an average salaries in eu countries . 
  absolute numbers rarely represent the actual price for local population . 
  there is / r/ukraine for that . 
  i 'd personally want both ukrainians and russians with their problems out of this subreddit . 
  tired of of them pushing their agendas on every corner . 
   associate member of the eu there is no such thing .
