  turkey is merely a recognized candidate for membership , alongside with albania , iceland , macedonia , montenegro and serbia . 
  anything else is nothing but a trade agreement which have absolutely nothing to do with membership in eu ( even though certain governments outside of eu like to say otherwise to fool their citizens ) . 
   is a member of the eu wat ? 
  with napalm !, 
  depends what resolution says exactly . 
  if it 's something like `` stop barrel bombs !, 
  ( + arm terrorists with manpads ) '' i 'm sure russians will veto that . 
  in many cases those resolution headlines do n't reflect the actual text or simply way to vague . 
  like the one about no-fly zone above libya , in the end it was twisted into `` we can bomb libya as much as we want '' resolution . 
   russian is incredibly soft and melodic . 
  really ? 
  for me it always sounds harsh . 
  a lot of hard sounds . 
   eastern europeans ukrainians i guess ? 
  how about no one ? 
  i mean this exact mindset that we `` must '' arm someone leads to nothing but prolonging the conflict . 
   verhofstadt likes to bring up international law in every discussion about migrants/refugees , but when international law gets in the way of his ideology , he suddenly turns on a plat that 's a fairly universal description in to which all modern politicians can easily fit . 
  those were definitely not transports . 
  the only reason i can think of is additional gunfire and aa \\ radar support for latakia . 
  no you would n't . 
  finns are crazy . 
  norway in other hand is fine place to live . 
  what the point of sending fleet to syria ? 
  terrorists do n't have ships and located a bit too far for naval bombardment . 
  it 's called nationalist , not racist . 
  there is a significant difference . 
  light ordnance shower . 
  well that 's explaining why erdogan is so pissed with russia lately . 
  so much money wasted . 
  ah ... fresh propaganda war . 
  that 's going to be fun to watch . 
   a turkish security official said turkish radar locked onto the russian aircraft as it was bombing early friday in al yamdiyyah , a syrian village directly on the turkish border . 
  he said turkish fighter jets would have attacked had it crossed into turkish airspace . 
  so pretty much nothing has happened but erdogan is blowing it out of proportion . 
  and i especially like the photoshopped image in the head of this article . 
  wait a second . 
  there is no border control ? 
  russia does n't give money , housing and welfare for free to every random immigrant . 
  so it 's out of the options . 
  i suspect this `` first airstrike '' is n't really the first one . 
  russians were deployed in syria at least a month ago . 
  most likely it 's the first publicly announced strike . 
  `` rebels '' . 
  you mean terrorists funded by foreign powers . 
  much like terrorists in ukraine . 
  double standards are going full retard lately . 
  russians have more than 300 military ships ? 
  i find it hard to believe unless you 're taking an inflatable boats into account . 
  it would 've ended years ago if not the opportunists in the gulf , iran , turkey , the us . 
  well ... he 's not wrong . 
  i wonder what 's her endgame ? 
  at this moment only a blind fool wo n't see this is not going to end well . 
  immigration and refuge is two very different things . 
  it 's really hard to legally immigrate to any eu country and become resident \\ citizen . 
  at best most people wo n't be able to get anything but a blue card . 
  yet at the same time refugees in here are enjoying many benefits and can even naturalize later . 
  this is retarded . 
  this kind of policy will bite us all in the collective ass in the nearby future . 
  we 're not allowing highly educated professionals in properly but welcome all of those `` refugees '' who will never work , will live off welfare and the 2nd generation will hate us all because of the inequality which will be apparent to everyone . 
  french did the same mistake not so long ago . 
  we are repeating it and on a much grander scale at that . 
  it is / r/europe , therefore yes . 
  those who 're making decisions are living in a fenced rich communities and do n't care about about the rest while preaching how all should help the poor refugees . 
  same as sweden really . 
  better murders on the streets than revolutionaries at the parliament !, 
  so basically pulling the same nonsense russians did with `` russian-speakers '' ? 
  i dunno if it makes it any better really . 
  it is for the members . 
  no one will accept ukraine in eu as its current state . 
  oh look ... a blimp !, 
  what year is this ?

  so ... why are you surprised again ? 
  but jet fuel ca n't melt steel beams !, 
  he probably likes to stick out of the window of his car like a dog while speeding . 
  brics ? 
  i though it was never taken seriously by anyone . 
   care to tell me how much violence has been caused by eastern orthodox people in the past 100 years ? 
  not much . 
  was under the thumb of soviets . 
   or how much violence is there in highly catholic places like poland or austria ? 
  you do know poland is ranked among the most peaceful places in the world , with some of the lowest violent crime rates and murders , right ? 
  yeah . 
  wrong angle . 
  they do n't have migrants there . 
  nothing to do with the religion . 
   care to explain how many jewish extremists are there in the us - the largest jewish community in the world ? 
  how much violence have they caused in the past 100 years ? 
  [ there is a place with a larger jewish population ] ( http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/12/151224-israel-jewish-terrorism-arson-christian-church-multiplication/ ), 
  you do realize that marxism , nazism , ect . 
  are political ideologies actively shunned everywhere except a few countries which are mostly isolated from everyone else , right ?
