  those ideologies are violent , corrupt and lead to misery , it 's a generally accepted fact . 
  i ca n't walk around for example promoting racial purity through violence against other races . 
  and now for some reason , religions which are leading to violence , corruption and misery are allowed to exist because some feeble minded want to believe in fairy tales . 
  actually in my youth i got in trouble for a t-shirt with che guevara on it , because he was a questionable person at best . 
  however wearing a t-shirt with a torture and execution device on it - cross , is a-ok !, 
   religion is the set of ideas as to how we should live our lives , and is very , very deeply rooted in basic societal philosophy , with mysticism sprinkled on top of it . 
  the basis of religion is how we should live our lives and treat eachother , so not much different from politics . 
  have you read the old testament ? 
  quran ? 
  i recommend you to do that . 
  religions promote in-group \\ out-group mentality . 
  believers , meaning in-group are ok and deserve love , salvation , etc. 
  out-group , however , deserve nothing but death if refusing to convert . 
  this is the basis for all abrahamic religions . 
  i have said nothing of the sort , do n't put words in my mouth . 
  i 'm only talking about the fact that our media is constantly shit talking about russia . 
  remember their olympics and how much made up nonsense was spewed about it back then ? 
  it happened before the ukraine . 
  most of the russians probably do n't even have any idea about that since they 're most certainly not watching swedish tv and probably any english speaking channels either . 
  i 'm not justifying their action , just saying that our media is indeed constantly portraying them as good for nothing barbarians . 
   let me ask you - do you have a political ideology ? 
  well , shame on you !, 
  how many people have died believing in political ideologies ? 
  communism ? 
  imperialism ? 
  how many more must die before we reject all political ideologies and believing in politics at all ? 
  do you know what 's the difference between politics and religion ? 
  politics represent desires and will of the real people , right or wrong , they are real people . 
  religion in other hand is the will of a made up deity . 
   there was n't much good to report about , imo . 
  i will never believe that nothing `` good '' has happened in russia since then . 
  but even in this case . 
  notice how our media tend to jump on any , significant or not , opportunity to bash russia for whatever reason . 
  it was always like that - according to the media narrative ( this subreddit included ) russia is a backwards hellhole , filled with uneducated rednecks in a state of perpetual drunken rage , dreaming about taking over the world . 
  this never bothered me much since little bit shit talk is a norm but recently it had became some obsession . 
  and it 's worrying because this constant public belittling and dehumanization of the entire nation ca n't go unnoticed , it will end badly one way or another . 
  this actually is not only happening towards russia . 
  turkey the same , it 's insane how everyone was cheering the the coup over here . 
  all of mid.eastern countries , some might deserve it , sure , but the way it is done is atrocious and will only lead to further fuel their resent towards us . 
  are you saying religion is a good thing ? 
  especially the ones based on superstitions of some desert dwellers who are all dead for thousands of years ? 
  how many people will have to die in the name of some deity before people finally accept that religion is nothing but a corruption , a tool to influence masses , a way to drain masses out of their money . 
   funny , my view is exactly the opposite . 
  can you tell me more about why you think the west has started an information war against russia ? 
  what role do russia 's invasions in its neighbouring countries play here ? 
  check back the narrative in newspapers and tv news from 90s concerning the chechen incursion . 
  it all started back then . 
  i remember bbc and swedish tv channels heralding `` chechen freedom fighters '' nonsense while in reality they were much like isis nowadays . 
  i have hardly heard anything good about russia since then . 
  should 've went to saudi arabia for that . 
  and then we 'd have a whole lot of other problems due to parents unable to provide enough for all of their kids . 
  raising a kid is a very expensive enterprise . 
   the time spent with dicking around , `` finding ourselves '' etc. 
  has been increasing steadily i 'm not sure it 's happening as often as many seems to portray . 
  there were plenty of `` alternative '' people at all times . 
  i think nowadays they became much more noticeable . 
  i 'm not sure japan is the right example , too much influence from the us , they were never independent since ww2 . 
  but yea , most of the asian countries are moving forward in political and social sense , russia at the same time seems like standing in place an ca n't decide where it should go . 
  i wonder if it 's the influence of the older generation born and raised in ussr affecting their politics so much or there is something else . 
  probably not to the the same extent . 
  never underestimate the power of personality cult in politics . 
  this is the problem with political systems similar to russia , venezuela , cuba . 
  as long as you have the leader ( feared/revered/respected ) everything is holding together more or less but when you lose this leader , everything collapses . 
  it happened before so many times , even in russian history and it will happen again as long as there are people whose ego is bigger than their sense of reality . 
  [ apparently they 're the 2nd largest ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federal_assembly_ ( russia ) ) but it does n't seem like they can overwhelm the reset . 
  but this is insane : government ** ( 238 ) ** ur ( 238 ) opposition ** ( 212 ) ** cprf ( 92 ) jr ( 64 ) ldpr ( 56 ) what 's the point of the parliament if the entire opposition , even united , ca n't influence politics at all ? 
  yea . 
  it 's just over here we call it pr department . 
  why are you even contacting with a bus driver anyway ? 
  i wonder what will happen after putin is no more . 
  suspect it 's going to be similar to venezuela after hugo chavez , absolute and total disaster . 
   we have a lot of asian mentality , so we 'll never change something by ourself without the vital necessity south korea begs to differ . 
  also china , albeit much slower . 
  it 's just you stuck in some social limbo . 
  i ca n't even imagine what would happen in case of a revolution in russia . 
  too many hawks around . 
  that would be an absolute disaster for both russia itself and all around it . 
  religion , religion never changes . 
  a bunch of backwards buffoons preying on fools and troubled , proclaiming peace and love but only for the in-group . 
   one advice for you - study history , it 's worth it . 
  same for you . 
  antisemitism was on the rise in poland even before the arrival of germans . 
  plus , again , this :  as german forces implemented the killing , they drew upon some polish agencies , such as polish police forces and railroad personnel , in the guarding of ghettos and the deportation of jews to the killing centers . 
  it 's a big deal . 
  poles actively collaborated in this . 
  you might say they had no choice but it was a trade of like `` better them then me '' , understandable from a personal point of view but in no manner this should be used to downplay their role in it . 
  so sensitive . 
  let 's deny history , shall we ? 
  [ link ] ( https://www.ushmm.org/information/press/press-releases/collaboration-and-complicity-during-the-holocaust )  as german forces implemented the killing , they drew upon some polish agencies , such as polish police forces and railroad personnel , in the guarding of ghettos and the deportation of jews to the killing centers.individual poles often helped in the identification , denunciation , and hunting down of jews in hiding , often profiting from the associated blackmail , and actively participated in the plunder of jewish property . 
   there were incidents , particularly in the small towns of eastern poland , where local polish residents -- acutely aware of the germans ' presence and their antisemitic policies -- carried out or participated in pogroms and murdered their jewish neighbors . 
  the pogrom in the town of jedwabne in 1941 is one of the best-documented cases . 
   by the end of the war , three million polish jews -- 90 percent of the prewar population -- had been murdered , one of the highest percentages in europe . 
  it was a joint enterprise . 
  got ta look convincing during that asylum interview . 
  and in this subreddit people for some reason believe in his infinite ability influence eu . 
  ok . you 're rated as a guest . 
  but what if you do n't have a rating when you 're using it the very first time ? 
  genuinely curios because i 'm planning a trip to the us this winter and wonder if can cut my costs a bit . 
  can someone please invest this `` nothing '' into sweden , thank you !, 
  i do n't understand how people are just letting some random strangers to live in their houses .
