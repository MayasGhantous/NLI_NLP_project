   we are told that we irrational , fearmongering and warmongering , victim-playing , anti-semites , backward , european money-sink , euro-mexico . 
  amazing , really , from where this complex might come ? 
  you 're getting called that according to your actions . 
  if you act according to the presented list then you 'll get what you deserve . 
   who demands money ? 
  we demands what we were promised to be paid for opening our markets toward giants who could swallow us easilly . 
  that money is recompense for that . 
  were you promised to become the country receiving more donations from the eu budget than anyone else ? 
  can i see a link to that agreement ? 
   second , we could n't wash away our hands from that war as you did . 
  yeah yeah . 
  your pm already told us all that were were all nazi collaborators and therefore ca n't criticize you . 
  actually your long tongue and constant clinging to the past are the reasons why people resent you . 
   also our current politics are our politics , enjoy your waves of immigrants while we enjoy our stable society , nobody forces you to live here or even think about poland . 
  we are fine thank you very much . 
  no they are not you 're own politics as long as you have a say in eu parliament . 
  plus i 'm not even talking about your xenophobia but about how your politicians are blocking any attempt to even negotiate with russians . 
  because clearly antagonizing them further is a such smart strategy . 
   also russia is anexing piece by piece lands close to its borders , trying spin around how they were saviors of europe at the same time washing their hands off their own crimes during wwii , that 's not unhealthy obsession , that 's just saying how things are . 
  funny how poles are forgetting about [ the pretext of ww2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_poland_ ( 1918 -- 39 ) ) . 
  bff with nazis and openly hostile to ussr . 
  genius policy which resulted in a total mess . 
  stop pretending to be a nation of a pacifist hippies prior to ww2 . 
   lastly we can play victim card because we were victims , murdered , raped , gassed , burned and shot to death . 
  when was it ? 
  how many decades ago ? 
   we are a free country hardly a generation , trying to build our own future and some people are having nerve to tell us what we should do . 
  we are tired of being told what we should and should n't do so do n't ever bother . 
  is n't it because you 're telling everyone else what they should do ? 
  i suggest you to look at the behavior of polish representatives when dealing with any internal or external eu issues . 
  amazingly self-centered nation . 
  plus even in this post there is such a clear inferiority complex its amazing really . 
  i do n't care about israel . 
  it 's not israel which is running all over the eu demanding money and if refused starting to either play an eternal victim card or accuse everyone around them in being nazis . 
  and do n't forget the constant attempts to remind to * everyone * around them how terribly poland has suffered in ww2 and under soviet regime as justification of any soft of bs in its current politics . 
  oh and constant calls to starting a 3rd world war and its generally unhealthy obsession with russia also are not encouraging . 
  yeah yeah . 
  please fix your tinfoil hat and proceed to / r/conspiracy . 
  what else did you expect when your entire country 's foreign politics is based on blaming others and playing perpetual victim . 
  [ because russia refused to sell gas to ukraine ] ( https://www.yahoo.com/news/ukraine-taps-russia-gas-132605095.html ), 
  will eastern europeans stop crying wolf in hopes of getting more money and leverage in foreign politics ? 
  truly insane are incapable to understand they 're insane . 
  i do n't care about the article . 
  i 'm pointing out the eternal hypocrisy of / r/europe mods , and many users . 
  they smear shit all over rt because it 's a russian state propaganda , but at the same time qatar , the islamic shit hole of the country , state propaganda is just ok !, 
  there is no such thing as multiculturalism in reality . 
  people either assimilate or live in isolation . 
  stop repeating regressive multiculturalism fairy-tale . 
  you can always come to sweden and see those awesome representative of multiculturalism . 
  they 're living in their own communities , using their own language and largely not interacting with people outside of the said communities . 
  the us is forcing people to assimilate , it 's not multiculturalism . 
  despite some squabbling , saudi arabia and qatar are close political allies and always represent the same position in their foreign politics . 
  do n't project your ignorance on others . 
  rt nonsense is rightfully banned here , then why is n't aljazeera ? 
  is [ qatari \\ saudi propaganda ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/al_jazeera#editorial_independence ) better than russian ? 
  edit : heh , downvotes . 
  so / r/europe likes qatari state propaganda after all . 
  interesting . 
   even better , germany 's favorite dish ( doener kebab ) is due to turkish multi-culturalism . 
  the uk sure as hell did n't invent curry either . 
  if multiculturalism is so bad , why is the food alone so good ? 
  are you really ridiculing the concept and reality of multiculturalism to the level of some turkish dish ? 
  multiculturalism is when you have walking-taking trash bags around living by their own rules and laws . 
  unlike eu where in most countries you can find functioning , though illegal , sharia courts there is no such thing in the us . 
  in the us you either assimilate or gtfo . 
  there is significant difference between people who managed to assimilate while maybe retaining some of the original cultural traits and people who come to your country , refuse to assimilate at all and demand from everyone around to respect their `` culture '' . 
  you do realize that diplomatic appeal is n't a simple phone call , right ? 
  and you really ca n't deny receiving a diplomatic appeal . 
   multicultural ones usa the us is n't a `` multi-culture society '' ... except maybe los angeles which is an illegal immigration and leftists heaven . 
  no use . 
  this insane `` us vs them '' mentality was always prominent in many eastern europeans . 
  and [ `` them '' do n't deserve any consideration ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-11470379 ) . 
  and after this people wonder why the right-wing hardliners are on the rise all over the eu . 
  simple soldiers do what they 're told to do . 
  even if staged , though unlikely , most would n't be able or even try to make sense of the orders they received . 
   the us did that to their foreign enemies how is it better ? 
  basically [ the third human centipede movie ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1883367/?ref_=nv_sr_3 ) . 
   are you sure that you know where europe is or where istanbul is ? 
  [ are you ? 
  ] ( http://www.mapsofworld.com/asia/ ) half of it located in europe . 
  ok then ... half of istanbul is in europe . 
  hence , not the biggest city in ** europe ** . 
  what ? 
  is n't it blocked in russia ? 
  [ over weed reference no less ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/russia-wikipedia-page-block-cannabis_us_55db6c65e4b0a40aa3abb871 ) . 
  poland ? 
  are you serious ? 
  your gov will kiss boots of whomever offering them more money . 
  it 's actually the case with most eastern european countries . 
  i mean look at czech republic , they 're welcoming their new chinese overlords with open arms right now . 
   i do n't , i have zero faith that they 'll change into a lawful , dependable pro-eu country in at least a century . 
  a couple of generations might be enough . 
   he was fighting russian nkvd secret police , which is precisely why he is so hated in russia . 
  i thought wikipedia is only blocked in russia . 
  because if [ ethnic cleansing practices ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stepan_bandera#views_towards_other_ethnic_groups ) is ok by your standards then i do n't know what to say . 
   istanbul [ is not in europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europe ), 
  wait a second . 
  are you saying eu is an equal union ? 
   the european union 's current overreaching and meddling in poland 's legal affairs oh , uh . 
  maybe then poland should stop [ draining money from eu ] ( http://www.msp.gov.pl/en/polish-economy/economic-news/4015,dok.html ) , eh ?
