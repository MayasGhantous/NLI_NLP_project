  it found weimar republic . 
  without ussr assistance weimar republic would have never managed to rebuild its heavy industry so fast . 
  would be nice to see a poll about how many russians know about the pretext of ww2 and how ussr was instrumental in restoration and modernization of heavy industry in weimar republic which in turn led to the increased pace of german rearmament in preparation to war . 
  and how shortsighted soviet politicians were to allow someone with a deep hate towards communism to get in power in germany . 
  they like to celebrate the victory day but i wonder how many of them realize it was the enemy they helped to create in the first place . 
  provoke russians ? 
  that 's the only thing poles can realistically do in syria , aggravate russians . 
   but still russia is still 4th not second haha oh yea . 
  you 're right . 
  for some reason i was under impression they 're the 2nd one . 
  ah well , still more than turkey can possibly muster on its own . 
  i 'm talking about russia . 
  russians are n't all to happy with turks . 
  sure . 
  but i do n't think you can count it as an easy way in . 
  as i said . 
  till the end of days . 
  because crimea will never become part of ukraine ever again , no politician on either side will do anything about it because it 's ether a political suicide in case of russia or a literal suicide in case of ukraine . 
  i wonder if russians realize they will have to pay 100 times over for a small useless piece of land in black sea . 
  atheist hating , lgbt hating regime promoting fundamentalist islam while on the verge of coming to blows with the 2nd biggest military force in the world . 
  wonderful place indeed . 
  surprising . 
  corporations and their stockholders in the us wo n't be happy . 
  what kind of nonsense is that ? 
  looking for an easy way in the eu , eh ? 
  can it be because you 're heavily biased and looking at everything through us-vs-them lenses ? 
  ofc they support the remain camp . 
  in case of eu dissolution poland will stop getting dozens of billions of euro every year . 
   he has a really good degree from one of the best universities in the world he has a degree from one of the most expensive universities in the world . 
  getting there and finishing end has nothing to do with how bright or exceptional you are . 
  it only means you had a wealthy parents . 
  do you know it for sure ? 
  have any sort of education on african and mid.east history , politics and sociology ? 
  are you libyan maybe ? 
  or are you simply parroting cnn propaganda ? 
   also , does n't he hold a economics degree from oxford ? 
  he 's clearly smarter than your average joe it only means that his parents were wealthy enough to send him to study there and he was social enough to acquire enough useful connections while there . 
  it 's not any ism . 
  it 's reality . 
  it 's sickening how all of the eu and nato politicians trying to act as they have any sort of moral high ground while waging wars on smaller countries regularly . 
  this whole ordeal started with ukraine-eu trade agreement which then turned into revolution supported by all of the prominent eu and us politicians . 
  there is a clear interest we have in ukraine . 
  40 million people , it 's a huge market . 
  by our , i mean eu . 
  you do realize our politicians are waging wars as often or more often than russia , right ? 
  they even managed to drag sweden into libya . 
  the only reason russia got sanctioned this time is because they started to mess in the matters which are directly involving us . 
  it has nothing to do with morality or `` bad behavior '' of russia . 
  why bother reviewing them every half a year ? 
  sanctions will be renewed till the end of days anyway . 
  or until either eu or russia seize to exist . 
  it 's not / r/syriancivilwar, 
  [ russia is in europe though . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/europe_orthographic_caucasus_urals_boundary_%28with_borders%29.svg ) in fact it takes more space in europe than any other european state . 
   georgia they never denied it though . 
  [ pretext to the invasion is what ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/timeline_of_the_russo-georgian_war#august_1_.e2.80.93_august_6 ) matters in case of georgia . 
  what the hell ? 
  why did n't they ban him from entering eu ever again right after his arrest ? 
  because david cameron is so much brighter than `` the average voter '' . 
  if everyone knows there is a `` secret cia prison '' then it 's not a secret anymore , is n't it ? 
  why are they even trying to hide it ? 
  they 're not breaking any legal agreements by using cluster munitions and i doubt russia cares about public opinion . 
  they really need a better pr department . 
  it was obvious this exact thing would happen . 
  ethnic criminal groups will always form during mass influx of a foreign people . 
  because ukraine is neither nato or eu therefore not a part of any mutual defense agreements . 
  most are coming from eastern europe i suspect . 
  they 're dependent on eu and must be afraid of its possible dissolution . 
   and that region holds a lot of resources , material , factories etc. 
  resources like ... coal ? 
  if we 're lucky those mines are beyond restoration by now . 
  we really do n't need more coal burning . 
  and soviet era factories ? 
  those are basically worth as much as their scrap . 
   well when russia troops invade your country supported by local proxies you let me know . 
  it 's pretty clear from your comment that you do n't understand how debilitating war is for a country who is fighting on it 's soil . 
  russians done well for themselves during 2 chechen wars . 
  and they were fighting them for 15 years . 
  with foreign mercenaries , ukrainians included btw , and all . 
   unhappy about ? 
  complain to someone who actually cares and has power . 
  vote . 
  well . 
  i actually do . 
  a few more years of this nonsense and we 'll finally get government which will hold sweden over others problems . 
  too far away and not so interesting because , let 's be honest , most in the eu and us does n't give a damn about syria . 
  while ukraine and russia are close , propaganda is active and everyone has an opinion . 
  because it 's a hot topic which is very entertaining for passing time at work due to very strong polar opinions in this sub on the matter . 
  except germany is immeasurably stronger in political , social and economical sense compared to russia . 
  ukraine in other hand is much weaker . 
  but even germany can succumb to russian corruption , [ gerhard schroeder is a prime example ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gerhard_schr%c3%b6der#gazprom ) . 
  born and raised in sweden . 
  why ? 
  questionable . 
  they need to distance themselves from russia to at least attempt to break the endless circle of corruption . 
  russia is corrupt beyond measure and any close ties with ti will corrupt any weaker country as well . 
  step one towards improvement for ukraine is getting rid of corruption and it 's not possible while russia is heavily present in its economy . 
  and [ kazakhstan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kazakhstan_famine_of_1932-1933 ) .

  was it also about slaughtering ukrainians ?
