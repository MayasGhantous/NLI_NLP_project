  in 6 years there will be a new government . 
  not sure on the election cycle in poland but it 's enough time to change 2 governments completely . 
   notice how ukraine possibly joining the eu after 30 years is a current issue now . 
  political statement nothing more , basically means `` maybe in 30 years '' , they ca n't say `` no because your country is so corrupt you have no place in eu '' . 
  `` in 30 years '' it 's not even a promise or a plan . 
  for those in power right now it basically means that in 30 years it 's going to be someones else problem . 
  what bothers me the most is how `` clean '' solar panels are really ? 
  production is n't [ that clean ] ( http://www.solarindustrymag.com/online/issues/si1309/feat_05_hazardous_materials_used_in_silicon_pv_cell_production_a_primer.html ) , they 're mostly non-recyclable and has to be replaced every now and then . 
  [ praise him ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkyw39kud3a ) !, 
  is it even possible for a non-citizen to request any welfare at all ? 
  should n't you to be able to use english well enough for others to understand you to work in the uk right now anyway ? 
  are you really comparing a total war with a local squabbling between a 2nd army in the world and something which is [ rated even lower than sweden in military might ] ( http://www.globalfirepower.com/countries-listing.asp ) ? 
   refugee migration should be seperated from jobs migration this !, 
  somehow it became a given fact that those `` refugees '' are never going to leave . 
  they 're refugees , not legal immigrants . 
  even right now syria is not as terrible as it was 2 years ago . 
  most of the major high populated areas are under government control , or controlled by sdf which according to the official narrative are totally not insurgent terrorists . 
  then why the hell are we accepting more and not sending those who are here already back home ? 
  it 's a natural desire . 
  it just they make it look like it 's happening tomorrow . 
  many things can change in 6 years . 
  many news websites nowadays are nothing more than a glorified blogging platforms . 
  plus it 's easy when you 're dealing with a website instead of a printing press because if people are starting to notice a complete nonsense you can easily erase it . 
  and who 's going to decide what is hate speech exactly ? 
  i mean it 's one thing when we 're taking about twitter posts stating something like `` kill all % group of people % '' but most of the time what people mean by hate speech is that someone has a different opinion . 
   in 2022 right . 
  6 years is a lot of time so can make any bold political statements as much as you like right now . 
  mentality like nationalism ? 
  shhh ... stop breaking the circlejerk . 
  bitter fruits of the fearmongering tree . 
   its called a revolution and is not free license for another country to move unmarked military into the country . 
  [ totally ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siberian_intervention ) ( [ or a bit more modern example ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yemeni_civil_war_%282015%e2%80%93present%29 ) ) you can call it whataboutism or but there is that . 
  it does n't . 
  my point is that the whole thing was in a state of political \\ legal limbo for 25 years therefore `` exhausting democratic process '' does n't work in this particular part of the world . 
   through a long and exhausting democratic process at the moment when ukraine was willing and able to let them go in a way both sides would be satisfied . 
  they tried it . 
  twice in fact . 
  did n't work . 
  so are you supporting ukrainians in their refusal to allow crimeans to exercise their right of [ self-determination ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/self-determination ) through referendum which was held in full accordance to international and ukrainian laws first in [ 1991 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean_sovereignty_referendum,_1991 ) and then in [ 1994 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean_referendum,_1994 ) ? 
  edit : funny how this comment is downvoted even though it presents nothing more than relevant facts . 
  welp . 
  that was expected to happen . 
  especially since wp is now below 1 % of the total smartphones used . 
  it 's sad really , i like live tiles on my lumia 930 , very useful feature but other than that i do n't think there is any point to get a wp device . 
  intensify forward fearpower !, 
  smart fighter ? 
  can i control it with my iphone ? 
  statements like this are not about not having actual organized cells but rather to make you afraid of any refugee , muslim , arab , ect . 
  plus maybe attempt to push unstable people into some retarded actions . 
  fearmongering continues . 
  but it has nothing to do with the size of russia 's population . 
   there 's a reason we fundamentally differ from both the russians and the chinese . 
  say what you will about the us military , or it 's 70 year history of flight over the worlds international airspace , but they follow the damn standards , conventions , and procedures . 
  [ o rly ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_aerial_reconnaissance_of_the_soviet_union ), 
  [ yes it is . 
  ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-04-30/russia-defends-intercept-of-us-plane-over-baltic-sea/7373348 ), 
  what ? 
  you 're talking about countries attacking their neighbors . 
  french did just that with libya . 
  or is it ok because reasons ? 
  and do n't forget you 're part of nato , the most active military alliance in modern history . 
  what exactly would it achieve ? 
  russians are minority on reddit in general and in this subreddit specifically yet everyone seems to be talking about them . 
   russia being mentioned the most can easily be explained by the fact that it has a higher population than any other country on the map . 
  flawed logic . 
  there are not that many russians on reddit . 
  you mean [ french ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_military_intervention_in_libya ) ? 
  also funny how everyone forgot about serbia and what nato did to it . 
  russia is a political arch-nemesis . 
  mostly promoted to this position by our own politicians . 
  [ great video making a point about it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wiqtpqrey8 ) . 
  yeah . 
  and this is why they keep pouring this propaganda on our heads for 50 years , to drag us in nato . 
  ofc we do . 
  especially nowadays when we have so many migrants , those are the ones burning down refugee housings . 
  well . 
  that 's even better . 
  wonder how russian government is planning to get out of that hole . 
  or it 's going to be as usual in such cases , failed government would tell people * everything is ok , no need to worry * while funneling the last bits of the funds left in the country to their private accounts somewhere else and then run to london . 
  yeah . 
  it 's either a plain trolling or you have no clue how language works when throwing a clearly passive aggressive remarks like you did . 
  both ignorant and incapable of standing by your own statements therefore making them so you can bail at any moment . 
  sadly , typical representative of the younger swedish generation . 
   i never relayed my opinion , i was encouraging someone to read the headline as it might answer their question . 
  let 's go through the conversation again . 
   - [ people who might change things for the better ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4jq9ni/russian_opposition_leader_navalny_five_others/d38mxt4 )  - [ whom are you talking about ? 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4jq9ni/russian_opposition_leader_navalny_five_others/d38n6cb )  - [ hint : read the headline . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4jq9ni/russian_opposition_leader_navalny_five_others/d38n9ab ) the headline : `` russian opposition leader navalny , five others attacked by cossacks '' so it 's clear that you either mean navalny or cossacks . 
  yes it 's important but not for judging if it 's ok or not . 
  a bunch of thugs imagining themselves to be a medieval paramilitary are physically attacking someone with an opposing political views . 
  it 's a hate crime . 
  are you an expert in russian internal politics ? 
  do you even know who 's nvalny and what he trying to achieve ? 
  or your knowledge ends with * `` he 's against putin '' * ? 
  [ meanwhile in russia ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/russia/gdp-growth ) . 
  it 's controversial if you 're a fanatic . 
  hint : do n't make assumptions about foreign politics when you have no idea about it . 
   they are descendants of cossacks who think that they are cossacks while they are not so basically clowns like `` vikings '' in sweden nowadays who are usually either drunkards or plain nazis . 
  it 's funny how people tend to twist the words of others if it suits the narrative .
