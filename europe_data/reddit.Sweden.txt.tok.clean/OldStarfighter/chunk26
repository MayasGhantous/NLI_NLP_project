  a russian redditor says that the said `` opposition leader '' is not going to change anything then a polish redditor assumes that the russian redditor approves of physical violence against the said politician . 
   europe has started electing populist anti-immigrant candidates a few years ago , actually or maybe people are voting for politicians who are promising to solve a very real problem instead of making the problem even worse ? 
  ever thought about it ? 
  it 's not populism , it 's democracy . 
   germany is known for it 's sex tourism . 
  oh , like no one else is doing it , right ? 
  it became a problem long ago . 
  zika is not the worst disease you can bring from a certain parts of the world after a close encounters with locals . 
  a `` joke '' like this clearly shows who 's in power in turkey . 
  not diplomats or highly educated people but a common thugs . 
  we do n't have money, 
  why ? 
  not even related example . 
  the eu is a union , not federation of states . 
   so aside from not pissing people of , is n't it enough ? 
  i mean , look around . 
  there are so many people at each others throats all the time . 
  constantly demanding , bitching or threatening someone . 
  yet we stay relatively out of it all . 
  what happened there ? 
  formally no . 
  plus crimea takeover was bloodless . 
  plus even ukraine is calling this shitstorm going on in the eastern part of it a `` counter-terrorist operation '' . 
  russian military ca n't be a terrorist group by definition . 
  so no , they 're not at war . 
  trolling level is over 9000 !, 
  then declare war on them and stop all relations whatsoever . 
  do n't want to ? 
  then shut up and deal with it . 
  last time i checked neither side declared war on the other . 
  * `` we all know russians did it '' * is not war . 
   `` ukraine may refuse to participate in eurovision 2017 in case russia will be the host '' . 
  it makes it better how exactly ? 
   the only excuse that it was just a facebook comment just a facebook post from director general of the national television company of ukraine . 
  surprising . 
  well , as i said in a nearby post it probably differs from region to region . 
  i live in a region deeply affected by the eu policies in not a good way at all . 
  a lot of low wage migrations from the eastern eu countries willing to work for a slave wage , so much that management on the local factories decided there it 's more profitable even despite the fact they 'd have to deal with the union . 
  refugee housings in the area and as a consequence an enormous amount of `` refugees '' around . 
  just in case : [ utilize ] ( http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/utilize ) - to use ( something ) for a particular purpose . 
  according to merriam-webster . 
  the word you 're looking for is [ dispose ] ( http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dispose ) . 
  why would / r/europe hate it ? 
  this is a clear attempt to compare incomparable , in this case ussr-gdr and russia-the us ( in in case of trump victory ) . 
  despite the fact [ it 's trump who 's threatening to shoot down russian planes ] ( http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/trump-says-us-has-gotta-shoot-russian-planes-performing-barrel-rolls-if-democracy-fails-1558024 ) ( there is an actual recording of him saying that ) . 
  the `` new '' / r/europe is in constant circlejerk mode hating on russia without any understanding of geopolitics , so it is going to be upvoted . 
   we had to ** utilize ** 60k pigs for what ? 
  what are you doing with a plague infected pigs ? 
  everyone loves sweden !, 
  yay !, 
  guess it depends on the region . 
  in my area most people are working on a couple of factories we have around and though union is resisting , management is trying to hire more and more eastern europeans which are happy to work for a slave wage . 
  plus we got a couple of fancy refugee housings . 
   she 's a very famous ( in sweden ) comedian . 
  local `` star '' . 
  nothing more . 
  and not way too popular one either . 
  too much agenda pushing . 
  they 're going to win because of that though . 
  in 2014 it was trans agenda pushing , this year its ukraine . 
  the key is to pick the right trendy thing people would feel obliged to vote for . 
  i would n't say so . 
  amount of people who are pro-eu have diminished even further . 
  i think you overestimate it . 
  or alternatively live in stockholm . 
  i live in a bit more rural part of the country and the general consensus is `` damn with eu and its policies '' . 
  * australia . 
  look at the sidebar . 
   you can have opinions about things outside of your own country . 
  althought trump may not have much influence on us lithuanians right now , if he ever were to become president of us he would have influence in europe and world affairs by default . 
  i do n't think anything needs to be said about putler  yep . 
  12 years old mentality right there . 
  reducing geopolitics to the level of `` we are good , they are evil '' propaganda . 
  a bit too much agenda pushing and politics for a song contest . 
  i 'd love to see a similar referendum to be held today , questioning how happy people are about being part of the eu . 
  i suspect results would be not in the eu favor . 
  `` we '' are the ones following the current official narrative . 
  in this case `` russia is the source of all evil '' . 
   i hear that argument , but i really do n't believe it , simply because russian icbms delivering nuclear warheads to the usa would certainly not be flying anywhere near romania icmbs can only be stopped reliably at the moment of their launch . 
  so your missile defense should be as close as possible to the launch site to intercept the missile during the early stages of its flight . 
  i suspect russia believes in `` we 'll take you all with us '' rather than a victory . 
   believe they are only intended to be used for defense . 
  or like suppress russian ability to retaliate . 
  in case of a possible preemptive strike which certain nato countries are calling for , for the last 15 years . 
  you know , just in case . 
  ca n't take chances with those pesky russians . 
   the central bank is not the government ; most central banks in the western world are independent , meaning they do not set monetary policy based on populist politics . 
  yeah , [ right ] ( http://www.cnbc.com/2016/04/27/forget-june-the-fed-isnt-likely-to-hike-interest-rates-until-december-commentary.html ) . 
  and it 's not about to change any time soon . 
  it 's like a death spiral for countries . 
  you have an economic issues and in a desperate need of investment but investors wo n't invest because you have an economic issues . 
  as the latest events on the oil marked had shown opec no longer has any real power over the market . 
  good luck with that . 
  if the story of charles de gaulle had taught us anything at all is that you 're not going against the us economic ambitions unpunished . 
  in case of sweden it 's social regressivenes because according to them swedes are the ones who should bend over and create a safe space for immigrants and the believes , no matter how uncivilized and barbaric they are . 
  those danes , they had ruined sweden !, 
  * slow clap *, 
  how are they unforeseeable if everyone is talking about it ? 
  send migrants to siberia , [ rent them as work force to russians ] ( http://www.vice.com/video/north-korean-labor-camps-part-1 ) . 
   sweden : why to visit ?
