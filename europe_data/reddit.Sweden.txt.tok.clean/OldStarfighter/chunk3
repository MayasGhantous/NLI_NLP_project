  i 'm not suggesting anything but : [ malaysia protests against pm najib razak draw thousands ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-34093338 ), 
  yeah . 
  like greece is part of eu while ukraine is and will not be one in any foreseeable future . 
  `` war '' i do n't remember ukraine declaring war on russia . 
  [ isis is n't the only problem there ] ( http://time.com/3979906/syria-safe-zones/ ) . 
  insurgents are as dangerous as isis . 
  this is a bit silly to hear coming from your country . 
  i still remember refugees coming in scores to sweden from balkans 20-15 years ago . 
  i doubt they 're going to stay there , just passing by . 
  the final destination is usually somewhere in northern europe . 
  i always found such predictions a bit silly . 
  they 're always assuming the current trend wo n't change for at least a few decades while in reality too many variables are simply unpredictable . 
  maybe poland would be better state if it was n't obsessing itself with russians ? 
  it 's sad today kalashnikov rifle is associated with terrorist . 
  it 's a fine weapon , created to defend but today it 's a symbol of terrorism . 
   [ i created a weapon to defend the borders of my motherland . 
  it 's not my fault that it 's being used where it should n't be . 
  the politicians are more to blame for this . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mikhail_kalashnikov#quotes ), 
  the point is that on reddit the most vocal `` troll population '' concerned about russian \\ ukrainian politics and dealings are the ukrainians themselves . 
  otherwise `` russian trolls '' are doing a fairly shitty job since , for example , while rt is constantly downovoted to hell no matter the topic , ut is always up in the top no matter what kind of nonsense it 's spewing . 
   putin 's support in russia is 88 % . 
  russia is a authoritarian regime . 
  because people living under a dictatorship will tell openly what they truly think about they government to any random guy with a questionnaire . 
  i wonder if the same 80 % supported the latest operation in libya disregarding all of the consequences ? 
  what exactly you want them to do ? 
  honest question : how many people actually want or trying to migrate to slovakia ? 
  i mean , what 's the point ? 
  shhhh ... quiet , you know how * they * are . 
  we do n't want to start a war , do we ? 
  exactly the people we need right now !, 
  just like there are no ukrainian trolls ... waaaait a second !, 
   i mean , we all know that russia wants mariopol . 
  doubt it . 
  if they 'd want it they 'd have it already . 
  mariopol is a staging point ( genius idea of housing a military targets within a civilian area ) for the ukrainian army so naturally it 's caught on the line of fire . 
  both sides are interested in keeping heat on at the moment , ukraine wants more sanctions and blame russia for everything while russia is bleeding ukraine dry through military expenses . 
   professional journalists extinct specie . 
  surstr\u00f6mming , no ? 
  neither you should trust people which prefer a rotten fish to a duck breast ... wait , what ? 
  jokes and political rhetoric aside from many points of view ukraine is in a perfect state as it is if we 're talking about geopolitics . 
  this conflict will continue to economically cripple russia for a long time plus it existence greatly diminishes its political weight since any statement and action if we wo n't like it will be disregarded . 
  it 's a great way to form public opinion and allow the us to move russia away from eu in order to [ take over the market ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/11563761/us-to-launch-blitz-of-gas-exports-eyes-global-energy-dominance.html ) . 
   we can cut of them from swift or do something like that and this will achieve what exactly ? 
  i keep seeing it suggested in this subreddit but ca n't understand why would russians care and why would it make them change their policy . 
   peoples lifes are n't cheaper than money . 
  hate to break it but yes , people lives worth nothing . 
  welcome to the real world . 
  plus in this video it 's clear both sides have a very vague , if any , understanding of basic tactics . 
  either not military personnel or alternatively a poorly trained military personnel . 
  untrained combatants tend to panic and `` go nuts '' shooting in a random direction which in many occasions might result in friendly fire amongst other things . 
  when something like this happens every day it becomes a norm . 
  i remember sleeping in a barrack in kosovo every night and every night someone would shoot in our general direction . 
  every morning we 'd cont a few dozen new 7.62 holes in the concrete wall of our barrack and a couple of new mortar holes in the road . 
  after a couple of weeks of that i would n't even wake up to explosions and paint falling from the ceiling at night . 
   imagine how many ** toilets ** died needlessly because of these actions . 
  i do n't believe putin is the source of all evil in russia . 
  it 's no longer a time when a single person is able to keep absolute power over his subjects . 
  there have to be layers upon layers of people who are willingly following this path due to greed or ignorance . 
  but i believe that in every country majority of people are decent but passive . 
  it does n't matter if there is a `` functional democracy '' in your country . 
  this can change if only more people would start asking questions . 
  they have plenty of opposition parties in russia , join them , support them . 
  i 'm not proposing a violent uprising since those never lead to anything good . 
  and democracy is a right and rights are n't granted , they have to be taken . 
  but of course again it 's so much easier to sit and do nothing . 
   so no , it 's not something that 's been spoken about at length in poland this is surprising since lately i saw plenty of tv shows in sweden discussing those events . 
  granted , it 's mostly our usual fear mongering towards russians but still . 
   that 's because this state is killing them again . 
  `` this state '' . 
  sounds silly coming from russian . 
  it 's not `` this state '' , it 's your state . 
  i see this silly phrasing all over the place when russians are discussing their own country . 
  it 's like you 're trying consciously or subconsciously to convince others or even yourself that you have nothing to do with it directly or indirectly . 
  i do n't believe in holding every citizen of the country accountable for the things their government did but this mentality russians have is quiet annoying . 
  it 's your country and it 's your responsibility to deal with your government , unless of course if you want others to deal with it but i do n't think you 'll like results of that . 
  but of course it 's much easier to sit and pretend it 's not your business and do nothing . 
  only a moron would deny history which happened decades ago . 
  the question is : how relevant those events today ? 
  i 'm not talking about forgetting it but rather pressing it non stop all the time everywhere . 
  if they have [ dpi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deep_packet_inspection ) in russia , they can simply block this particular subreddit . 
  but the question is how many russians know english on a sufficient level to properly understand if at all contents of the said subreddit or reddit in general ? 
  why would their government be so concerned about anything beyond russian sites ? 
   i 'm as much ` lol russia ' as the next guy but it 's funny how people are afraid to say anything positive about russia without reaffirming their general distaste of it . 
  they also made [ vangers ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/264080/ ) , i stumbled upon a cd with the game back in 99 and it was one of the most entertaining and psychedelic games i played . 
  t-50 fighters are not an `` all out war '' weapon but rather a tactical tool . 
  massive wars were always waged with a bulk of simpler and cheaper weapons which can be mass produced and replaced quickly . 
  translation from ukrainian : `` gief more moneyz plox ! '', 
  i think we should instead concentrate on our own problems instead of russian ones . 
  can they grow apples ? 
  the only ones we have here are from poland and those are terrible . 
  i 'm pretty sure russians are in the exactly same mindset . 
  some cold war propaganda war victim holding his hand on the `` kill em ' all '' button . 
  because we all know how easy it is for some nato countries to find a reason to start a war . 
  this bullshit will continue to spin forever it seems . 
  all thanks for career politicians on both sides who will do and say whatever to wind a bit more political points before the next elections and it 's so easy to turn population against some enemy rather than impress them with a diplomatic will to ** solve ** disagreements instead of entering into another spin of endless confrontation . 
  this is a very hard thing for people to grasp unfortunately . 
  no one wants to see the simple reason why russians are so wary about nato and this shield . 
  if i would be on their place i 'd also constantly have this question in my head : how long will it take until some mad man in nato will decide that it 's time to remove a potential threat from the east and will launch a preemptive strike ? 
  because `` we 're good guys and can do no wrong '' .
