  which makes it nothing more than [ wwii style of propaganda ] ( http://i.imgur.com/n0mbrva.jpg ) . 
  why would i do that ? 
  i 'm not russian . 
  it 's not my business what their government do . 
  it 's their own problem . 
   ** ukrainians ** share revealing stories about the ** russian ** government my guess this part is the problem . 
  if i 'll start to share `` revealing stories '' about norwegian government i 'll be laughed at . 
  maybe even prosecuted . 
   other than that , good luck pushing your russian agenda elsewhere . 
  really ? 
  when you see comment you do n't like you 're instantly marking it as a russian propaganda attempt . 
  this attitude will never make people to take you seriously . 
  other than that , good luck pushing your ukrainian agenda elsewhere . 
   russian paid poor made propoganda making glory of stalin , soviet union and russian nation as the superior genetically . 
  ironically enough stalin was n't russian . 
  [ he 's georgian , ioseb besarionis dze jughashvili ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/joseph_stalin ) . 
  also . 
  any links to those masterpieces of propaganda ? 
   uatoday.tv * sigh * such a reliable news source . 
  almost as reliable as rt , right next to fox . 
  imo the only way eu can survive in a long term is by becoming a federation . 
  unified economy , laws and military . 
  never listen those who say that surstr\u00f6mming is the national swedish delicacy and you should try it . 
  what you really want is to stay as far away as possible from the thing . 
   five entrepreneurial places in europe where hub things are happening that 's the actual title . 
  and out of the 5 countries they 're listing lithuania is n't even the first one . 
  yeah . 
  he opened a wound in ukraine , figuratively speaking . 
  and you 're eagerly keeping this wound open , bleeding your own country . 
  more than a year has passed and i yet to see any real attempt to negotiate and stick to agreements from any side . 
   russians are distracted from their everyday misery when they are focused on outer ` enemy this might be true . 
  but this work both ways . 
  ukrainians are distracted from their everyday misery when they are focused on outer ` enemy ' . 
  why are you posting this piece of blatant propaganda here ? 
  i 'm an ex-military who served in nato forces for almost 10 years and participated in a few conflicts yet i can tell you this kind of ridiculing of any weapon is disgusting . 
  is it all fun and games for you ? 
  i saw nutjobs thinking they 're playing some video game in kosovo . 
  dehumanization of the enemy is a common trick used by politicians and you definitely bought it , congratulations . 
  yeah ... 
  i can already see putin sitting there and thinking `` good , good , just give me an excuse ! '' . 
  nato wo n't help you in cases when you 're an aggressor . 
  no need to post the same thing in every thread . 
  it 's always either this or moronic reference from the civilization video game . 
  i like how you decided to look through my posting history and did n't even realize the difference between mocking the article and [ generic irrelevant joke ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3adim7/russia_angered_by_freezing_of_accounts_in_belgium/csbnwjf?context=3 ) . 
  everyone laugh !, 
  it 's this joke which no one ever heard before . 
  it 's so original , new and funny !, 
  the one who wrote it have such a great sense of humor !, 
  it 's because it 's all based on bullshit rather than real economics . 
  that 's what you get for this whole campaign against greece in every major media outlet in eu while the same media outlets are elevating germany as the main driver of eu economy and politics . 
  it 's like in big families , if you 're a favorite child you can get away with more than rest . 
   short-term military campaign such as the one currently being planned by eu foreign and defense ministers to target migrant smugglers in libya another military operation in libya , that 's exactly what we need right now because the last one worked so well !, 
  business is business . 
  what is the affiliation of this site ? 
  i live in sweden and never heard about it . 
  this is simply sad . 
  fear-mongering and constant speculations on immigrants in every media outlet are finally working . 
  breaking news !, 
  russia is n't happy about freezing of their assets . 
   dna says senegal , it means senegal and we have all the proof we need . 
  send him to senegal with a paper explaining test results and that 's it . 
  that 's harsh . 
  my parents are from pakistan , both of them . 
  yet i was born and grew up in sweden . 
  i even served in one of the nato countries armed forces ( moved to another eu country for a while , got resident status while studying and enlisted later , if you wonder how swede can serve in nato ) . 
  and yet nowadays every now and then i 'm having encounters with police when they check my identity to verify that i 'm not some illegal immigrant walking around since i do n't look like a typical european at all . 
  now let 's imagine a situation when i ca n't verify my id . 
  which is not that improbable , i have a close friend with which we used to serve together and at least once every 2 years he 's having those episodes of temporary memory loss and disorientation as the result of certain injury in service . 
  now imagine that it 's me , i have no idea who i am , i have no id and my dna clearly says i 'm from pakistan . 
  will it be right to simply deport me to pakistan ? 
   if we want immigrants to stop coming we need to help them build a world like the one we have , instead of the current faffing about back and forward with no actual long term solution for these people and their plight . 
  or alternatively we should stop [ trashing their own countries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_military_intervention_in_libya ) . 
  why are you mixing a few unrelated issues in one ? 
  we understand you are die hard civilization video games fans but can you stop using the same joke in every thread ? 
  it 's not funny , it 's stupid at this point . 
  but again . 
  war is not the only reason to get asylum . 
  religious , racial or any other type of persecution can get you that . 
  just say you 're gay for example , we all know how gays are treated in most african countries . 
  edit :  just for the record , human migration can be tracked via dna . 
  each group of people have mutations specific to that group of people . 
  that 's not accurate to say the least . 
  immigration is not uncommon , especially to neighbor countries . 
  what evidence ? 
  refugees are sailing from a war torn country . 
  no documents and no databases . 
  there is no way to track them to their point of origin . 
  it 's simpler in case of ukraine , russia and pretty much all other ex-soviet countries since there are ways to identify people and there are lots of data exchange agreements which is not the case with most african countries . 
  that 's because they wo n't tell from which country the really are and pretend to flee the war . 
  and here you really have only 2 chooses : deport everyone or accept everyone . 
  we chose the latter . 
  i think lots of people forget how ass backwards most countries were not so long ago . 
  racism , segregation , eugenics , intolerance used to be a norm but a few decades ago . 
  progress is n't some universal thing which is instantly kicking in everywhere . 
  while in service i saw countries which are on the same level of development as europe was 150 years ago . 
  i also saw russia as i was stationed there for joined exercises at some point and from what i managed to gather russians are tend to be well educated people but it 's like they 're stuck in some mental shell . 
  it 's some twisted mix of feeling own greatness ( which i guess a remnant of the empire and then decades of ussr propaganda ) and at the same time a shame of themselves with bits of inferiority complex . 
  people who at the same time fear and unconditionally trust their government , because in ussr you did n't question your government . 
  25 years is n't enough time for people to change especially if we 're talking about whole generations of people raised in soviet and cold war type of propaganda `` everyone is against us '' . 
  at least that is my impression .
