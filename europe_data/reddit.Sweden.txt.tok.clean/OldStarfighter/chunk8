   and he assumed the responsibility by taking his life , very noble . 
  we 'd live in a much better world if ceos and politicians of today had the same notion of honor . 
   mechanically separated leftovers from the bone ground with trimmings and mixed into a paste , then formed into a bacon like substance with meat glue wow . 
  yeah , not sure if we have this around but i definitely never saw anything like this in any of the local stores . 
  does n't matter . 
  can dip in it nutella and enjoy !, 
  exactly . 
  plus in all honesty i think even russians would provide people in a genuine distress with some basics . 
  however i doubt they 'd be all to kind to impostors . 
  except russians would n't give a shit . 
  they 'd either deport them in some random country or jail them for breaking visa laws . 
  or alternatively they can offer them a comfortable tent camp somewhere in siberia . 
  what a waste of bacon . 
   if you do n't give a shit about it , then why comment ? 
  for the same reason why i come on reddit in general . 
  to discuss random topics . 
   why take a stance as you probably have very little knowledge on the whole geopolitical issue . 
  did i miss something . 
  are you are a diplomat in the eu foreign affairs agency ? 
  because if not you 're as qualified as i am . 
  we 're most likely watching the same tv even . 
   we have a fucking good reason to hate russia and ** so do you ** . 
  that 's a bold one . 
  seriously , as i said before , this is the exact reason why so many people were in opposition to ex-soviets joining eu in the first place . 
  too soon for you . 
  you 're spreading hate everywhere you go it 's like the whole point of your existence is to spite russia . 
   the fact that the ussr draw their borders violently so that you got away is your pure luck . 
  ** russian imperialism is still a threat to all of us in europe ** , you are fucking gullible to blame it on ex-communist nations , who did n't want to be communist in the first place . 
  riiiight ... 
  i think your sense of self importance is deceiving you . 
  what would russia want your country anyway ? 
  give me at least one good reason . 
  at least in case of ukraine i can sort of accept semi-importance of eastern ukrainian military factories for russia but even that is outdated leftovers from ussr . 
  crimea , the act of taking it over was hardly violent , most of the ukrainian army has either defected or packed and left . 
  the way they did it is fucked up , but whatever , not a problem of sweden . 
  and it was obvious russians would never let any nato installations on the island . 
  way too close to their `` underbelly '' . 
   why ? 
  before it attacked georgia folks like you were yelling that `` idea of russia attacking any neighboring country is retarded '' . 
  why are you projecting the georgian situation to sweden again ? 
  it 's again , a very complex issue . 
  they had wars around the place a couple of times before after the fall of ussr . 
  surprising it was n't more often since apparently those responsible for drawing new borders after ussr did a shitty job . 
   oh great , a blog-like youtube video ... 
  i can find you same kind of videos about jet fuel not being able to melt steel beams , you know ... 
  except this particular video shows people mixing molotov cocktails outside . 
  if this is not evidence , i do n't know what . 
   you think that all russians want to live under this shitty dictatorship . 
  i do n't think about it at all . 
  i do n't give a shit . 
  it 's their issues , not mine . 
   and you think that their dictatorship does n't affect you - that you can continue living in your lala-land , where nothing bad happens . 
  do you think the same when your neighbors in the east are invaded and occupied by russia ? 
  do you think the same when they invade gotland to deny nato 's supply to the baltic ? 
  and this is why i was always against accepting ex-communist states in eu . 
  you hate russians and try do drag us all the same way . 
  idea of russia attacking any eu country is retarded and can only be used to persuade gullible voters like yourself . 
   it is still not certain who orchestrated the odessa trade unions house fire . 
  it is known that once the militants were forced into the building , they threw petrol bombs at the protesters from the roof and snipers on the roof were targeting pro-ukrainians below . 
  most likely the pro-ukrainian forces threw petrol bombs back at the building . 
  whether the building caught on fire due to pro-ukrainians throwing petrol bombs in or due to pro-russian forces throwing petrol bombs down [ and accidentally setting the building on fire ] , is still not known . 
  yep . 
  [ totally accident . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4djrni-x8q )  and how can you really be so fucking gullible to the dictatorship in russia ??? 
  because i do n't give a damn about russia , russians and their problems . 
  if they like to live under the iron fist , power to them . 
  in the same way i do n't give a damn about ukrainians except the times they come here and demand money . 
  odessa is not in crimea and there were no sightings of russian troops there . 
  i understand that you guys in eastern eu hold a grudge against russia but this is ridiculous . 
  are you really truing to justify actions of the extreme right-wingers because those who suffered from their actions were voicing their opinions in favor of russia ? 
  edit : nvm . 
  i 've checked your posting history . 
  nothing but anti-russian rhetoric . 
  no point to continue this discussion . 
  it 's funny how you think about ukrainians disagreeing with the new gov to be some sort of a mindless drones controlled by putin himself . 
  regardless of who was right or wrong in their believes during this particular incident , what happened is completely fucked up . 
  police stood there watching right-wnigers throwing molotov cocktails into administrative building with people locked inside . 
  most likely scenario is that the situation is used by both sides by opportunist politicians . 
  i believe russian gov had some interest at the start of the eastern ukraine `` rebellion '' but it seems to me they lost their interest fairly fast . 
  unlikely . 
  that would be too stupid . 
  if anything the new ukrainian gov would benefit from it the most since they can blame everything on `` the war '' , pass any laws , demand more money , etc. 
   it was a choice between guaranteed misery and bleak future under russians or a chance to get something better , eventually it 's retarded statement . 
  painting everything black and white is ridiculous . 
  it was a eu \\ us \\ russia power play , everyone is involved . 
  it 's retarded to pull the blame on one side only . 
   russia is fully responsible for the following war . 
  sure they 're involved but even if they tricked rednecks from the eastern ukraine to `` fight for independence '' it was still their own doing . 
  i still do n't believe in full out russian deployment in ukraine , syria showed that even a small russian task force can obliterate everyone they do n't like in a matter of weeks while this shitshow in ukraine is dragging for years now with no real prospects of victory for separatists . 
  typical priest right there . 
  trying to argue with someone who 's using nyt as a source of information on which he 's building his worldview ? 
  you mean $ 2 million for the low ranking bureaucrats to steal and nothing to pelbs . 
  1/7th actually , $ 150kk per unit . 
  wow . 
  they 'll be able to afford 1/3 of an f-22 !, 
  not really . 
  they 're withdrawing the bulk of their forces but those bases are still there and those few planes staying there will continue to support saa . 
  people are confusing immigrants and refugees \\ illegal aliens as usual . 
  why would eu accept refugees from ukraine while the most of it is safe ? 
  well .
