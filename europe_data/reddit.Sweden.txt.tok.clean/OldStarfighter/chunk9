  at least one european country had seized the initiative , the us does n't seem to happy about that . 
  * implying that the one who wrote that article is n't another ignorant fool who can see a difference between europe and european union . 
  swedish tradition is to stay away from conflicts which do n't concern us . 
  i suggest you to read a bit about the last 200 years of swedish history . 
  the fact that too many people are finally crumbling beneath the decades of fear-mongering and cold war propaganda means nothing . 
  the us and co. are trying hard to drag us into their petty conflicts but there is absolutely no reason to do so . 
  there are a bit more than `` a few thousandths '' . 
  plus do n't forget we 're a small country with roughly 10kk people living in it , basically almost as many as in nyc alone . 
   you directly benefit from our strength and violence . 
  ok then . 
  thank you for all of the refugees . 
  we are not part of your nato . 
  and we 're neutral , it 's our way . 
  depends where you are . 
  in stockholm people are more inclined to be tolerant . 
  a bit away from it the situation might be different . 
  i worked on a factory in a smallish town and people there were terribly racist but only `` behind closed doors '' . 
  understand one thing , sweden in general is very concerned about its image and rarely people will tell you in person what they really think . 
  plus , back in 90s and early 2000s we got a lot of immigrants from balkans . 
  before that point we were a very quiet country where nothing ever happened . 
  refugees disrupted that ( not saying they were bad but people which spent time living in war torn country will have certain clear marks ) . 
  but it was n't too bad . 
  nowadays we 're swamped with people of a such drastically different culture and worldview we have no idea what to do with them . 
  however saying anything bad about the whole situation is a big no no and not socially acceptable thing . 
  if he 's so great , why come here and qq ? 
  suck it up and work towards better future for yourself . 
  instead , again , he openly hated on every single one russian but himself and blamed everything on putin . 
  i 'm not incapable of empathy but when people ca n't take responsibility for their own actions they deserve nothing . 
  [ his thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/47kn17/my_daily_life_in_russia/ )  corruption everywhere and imperator pu supports this . 
  ** people angry and awful . 
  destroyed economy , designed for oil export . 
  despair . 
  i am ashamed to be russian . 
   but i also see that people are basically talking about putin . 
  just a while ago a russian redditor uploaded a picture of his paycheck in rubles ( and how worthless it 's becoming ) and the guy got nothing but support . 
  i also saw that and i think the guy is a failure . 
  i met plenty of russians who come to sweden to learn how to use a specific industrial electric tools the company i 'm working for is producing and those are well paid engineers . 
  so one failure which decided to come on reddit and whine about his life means nothing . 
  however , that thread fits perfectly in the narrative of how terrible russia is . 
  also . 
  after 20 years of service in army i had hard time finding a job in sweden as well . 
  my expenses were greater than what i was earning even with welfare . 
  i do n't remember accusing the king in my own failures unlike the guy who 's pretty much calling all other russians ( but not him ) mean and dumb and blames everything on putin . 
  yep . 
  that sums up sweden , especially outside of stockholm , very well . 
   despite the us being full of awful people ( as you colorfully point out ) many black and brown educated swedes move there to escape the clearly unjustified perceived racism they faced in sweden . 
  it 's more like a passive-aggressive attitude rather than an open persecution though . 
  it might be news for you but this subreddit is strongly anti-russian . 
  not a day passes by without a few new `` omg russia is terrible \\ russians are barbarians \\ putin is literally hitler '' threads . 
  so i ca n't see a problem here . 
  hm last time i checked the general consensus in / r/europe was that all russians are backwards barbarians , it 's funny to hear a lecture about `` not generalizing people '' here . 
  it 's funny how you only mentioned the us bashing but not russia . 
  both suffering from intense imperialism , hippocricy , megalomania , have will to dominate everyone around them and capability to do so by force while not exercising this ability too often . 
  both are loud , obnoxious and feeling entitled everywhere they go . 
  so i 'd say - yes . 
  except , you know , ukrainians are the ones who tend to grab to every straw in the argument against russia , however ridiculous that may be . 
  it 's ukrainians who are constantly attempting to push my government to participation in the conflict which does n't concern us whatsoever . 
  and good job comparing my view of sweden with that of nazi germany . 
  you have it in common with poland and russia at least , if you want something just accuse the ones who do n't want to follow your wishes in being nazi . 
  yes . 
  i 'm saying the person is not qualified to do any judgement or make conclusions outside of his blog and the fact that his blog is quoted as a legitimate source only shows the sad state of the modern news media industry . 
  why not start using reddit comments as a source for news ? 
  we 'd have so many wonderful stories and political decisions , breaking news every second . 
  edit : ok . only now i noticed your flair `` ukrainianswede '' . 
  that explains everything . 
  keep making those straw mans . 
  no point in any further discussion . 
  sure . 
  also you can ask some hobo to perform an open heart surgery on yourself . 
  i mean , who said that a random hobo with no knowledge , training or experience in medicine ca n't perform a surgery ? 
  so how this bullshit written by an unemployed random brit is credible ? 
  how is it different from millions pro \\ against russian \\ us \\ israeli \\ etc. 
  blogs out there ? 
  do enlighten me . 
  is n't it because his nonsense fits your mindset and general narrative ? 
  what 's so positive about it ? 
  gathering info from twitter is not journalism . 
  [ eliot higgins ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eliot_higgins ) aka bellingcat . 
  while there is little doubt about russian action leading to mh17 incident but it 's ridiculous how everyone is willingly eating bullshit produced by a random brit . 
  edit : ok . downvotes . 
  keep thinking that a random british blogger is even a slightly legitimate source . 
  just do n't forget that he was a completely unknown random brit until this whole mh17 debacle and only became popular because tv channels stated to quote his blog in absence of any other proper sources on the incident . 
  and `` open source journalism '' is not journalism because his entire picture of the world is build around stuff he found on facebook and twitter . 
  from wiki :  occupation blogger , ** weapons analyst ** , citizen journalist  eliot higgins was born in 1979 . 
  [ 1 ] in 2012 , when higgins began blogging the syrian civil war , he was an unemployed finance and admin worker who spent his days taking care of his child at home . 
   ... ** higgins has no background or training in weapons ** seriously ? 
  like ... seriously ? 
  not going to happen . 
  right before the time to make this decision we 'll see some awesome performance in ukraine designed to sway public opinion against it for a while , effectively forcing politicians from making this decision . 
  no , you really should try to listen what their politicians say . 
  even after whitewashing on local tv it 's ridiculous . 
  what ukraine is doing is playing a victim card . 
  their relations with the eu atm can be summarized as : `` russia is evil , give moneyz plox !, 
  well yea . 
  if you 're claiming that some other nation took a potion of your land illegally and you do n't agree with that then you either taking it back or shut up and moving on . 
   what ukrainians are doing is something completely different , but its hard to blame them for wanting stick it to their aggressor everywhere they can . 
  i 've said it before and i 'll say it again . 
  if russia is an aggressor then ukraine should declare war on it and stop all diplomatic relations . 
  otherwise ukraine is acting like a spoiled child who had his candy taken away . 
   you say hello , not sweden .
