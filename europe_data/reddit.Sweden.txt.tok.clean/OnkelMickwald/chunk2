  go back 70 years , do you think most people in the netherlands would want public displays of homosexual love ? 
  what would give the majority 70 years ago the right to diminish the individual freedoms of homosexuals ? 
  or , if you want an analogy that does n't deal with sexuality , go back 70 years and go to germany , how many would agree with socialist propaganda being shown in the streets ? 
  chances are that the majority would n't want that , giving the nazi government the moral capital to censor uncomfortable opinions . 
   the thing is that we are very democratic , but we also have a government can actually do and enforce shit . 
  i really do n't understand that logic , why would the government enforcing not showing isis banners be democratic ? 
  to me it 's about as counter-democratic as it gets . 
  you 're being downvoted to oblivion , but you have my support . 
  banning display of isis flags is a ) not going to diminish support of isis whatsoever . 
  b ) is against the principle of free speech . 
  yes , free speech means that whatever idiots and terrible people can express their opinions also . 
  yeah , i do n't either understand people 's fascination with banning external displays of opinions . 
  it 's nothing but cosmetic , and also a bit contradicting to the principle of free speech . 
  how about a simple `` excuse me ? '', 
  i do n't know why people over-complicate . 
  i speak english when i 'm abroad all the time and i never apologize for not speaking the native language . 
  nor do i expect any tourist to learn friggin swedish for coming here , that 's just ridiculous . 
  yup , it was a stupid-as-fuck comment . 
  read my edit please :(, 
  you 're absolutely right , of course . 
  i 'm sorry about the stupid and offensive nature of my comment . 
  i 've edited it now . 
  good point , but i 'm constantly thinking they will collapse sooner or later . 
  i have n't heard of them building any lasting or good relationships with locals or even other islamist militias , they just make more enemies by the minute . 
  solution : ~ ~ encourage ~ ~ let the isis supporters to join isis and travel to syria and iraq and then forbid them to return since they 're a member of a dangerous organization and a danger to european states , and let them die in combat down there . 
  ** edit : ** when i had written this comment i realized how inconsiderate it is for middle easterners who have to suffer isis 's rule of terror . 
  let this comment stand , however , as a testimony to my stupidity . 
  i no longer stand for it . 
  this has to be the creepiest comment in the thread . 
  `` stabbing where it hurts ... '' any diplomat and politician worth their salt are n't moved by such childishness , and it seems like brazil thought the same thing . 
  they did n't even dignify the infantile insult with any reference to it in their response . 
  democracy is overrated ? 
  i definitely do n't support israel and what they 've decided to do recently , but democratic rigor is an ideal i hold higher than my personal opinions on israel 's lack of humanity in their treatment of palestinians . 
  no ass-beating of a swedish pro-israeli is ever gon na revive any palestinian children anyway , nor will his continuing to express his opinions kill anyone down there . 
  they downvote you because they probably , just like me , thought you meant that he deserved having his ass beat for expressing his opinions . 
  i 'm definitely not pro-israel in this question , but i 'm not retarded enough to think that is even remotely relevant when you 're discussing someone who got beaten by steel rods for their opinions . 
  heck , he could 've been a nazi or jihadist for all i care , i still would find assault of him disgusting . 
  is that really relevant ? 
  someone got beaten down for expressing their opinions . 
  `` free speech does n't apply to people who are * wrong !!!!!!, 
  why ? 
  he 's obviously an israel supporter . 
  the violence in israel/palestine did n't happen in sweden , but in israel/palestine  those were the news i was talking about . 
  probably to show support for israel during [ the last days ' intensified violence in the region . 
  ] ( http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/israel-strikes-gaza-militant-sites-in-response-to-rocket-attacks-1.2691096 ) do n't people read the news ? 
  ** edit : ** the `` do n't people read the news '' part was n't aimed at / u/jasmck specifically , but everyone here are completely baffled as to why anyone would fly an israeli flag right now . 
  i do n't know if the recent intensifying of the conflict between israel and hamas is the reason for the flag-flying , but it 's definitely the guess that sounds most probable and no one has brought it up yet . 
  imo , the european union should remain a political entity whose primary concern is intra-european trade , mobility and to some extent , to encourage democratic and transparent governments , nothing more . 
  i do n't know why people are so fascinated with the thought of a grand , powerful country . 
  i do n't want to live in a powerful country , i 'm happy to live in sweden ( which to me is a perfectly sized country ) . 
  a `` united states of europe '' just sounds too imperialistic to me , and i fear that that 's exactly what a unified europe ( which undoubtably would sail up to become one of the - if not the most - powerful country in the world ) will become : an empire . 
  well most swedes are n't religious on paper , i.e. 
  if you ask anyone they 'll probably answer agnostic or atheist or that they just do n't bother . 
  that 's not to say there are n't large christian portions of society as well , the most devote of them being different protestant churches that are n't tied to the church of sweden . 
  however , i personally think that lutheran ideals have largely and sneakily transformed into the current swedish mentality . 
  there 's still quite some idealism when it comes to relationships , speaking loudly or in general ` taking up a lot of space ' , exaggeration , bragging etc. 
  not all of these are bad though , but sometimes it can be a little suffocating for me personally . 
  of course there are assimilated people of roma origin , i worked with a dude who was descendant from swedish romas . 
  there is n't one ethnicity in the world which is 100 % rotten apples , and that 's why we constantly have the discussion of battling racism . 
  i could just as easy say that the successful african americans are overshadowed by the number of african american criminals ( and many do ) . 
  the problem with this reasoning is that you do n't take into account social problems that african americans face that , say , white americans do n't face to the same extent . 
  the problems are originally the same with social exclusion and a caste-like system that sorts certain groups at the bottom . 
  the problem with roma are similar to that of african americans , but more severe , and that is reflected in a culture that focuses heavily on surviving by means that most others do n't think are moral . 
  the reason why this culture is prevalent in the first hand is that many many generations ago , this became one of few ways in which romas could survive , so the one who became successful at stealing for instance , became successful within the bounds of what romas had access to do . 
  there never was prohibition in sweden ... 
  that would be like legalizing child prostitution and child pornography because the market is already there . 
  i do n't know why you 're being downvoted , but i feel like there 's a lot of luther hidden in our modern swedish minds . 
  dude , you 're in the non-serious part of the thread . 
  head back up if you have troubles detecting obvious self-parody . 
  the reasoning behind the law is n't just `` prostitution is filthy and bad '' , the reasoning goes that it 's immoral to buy sexual services , and that prostitutes are victims of a degrading system where the buyers are the benefactors of said system . 
  legalizing prostitution creates a market for people to become `` sex objects for money '' . 
  i do n't understand how it 's more hypocritical than punishing the buyers ... 
  [ yeah yeah ... ] ( http://static.fjcdn.com/large/pictures/6c/26/6c2664_4984723.jpg ), 
  exactly . 
  antiziganism is just a blind spot for many i guess . 
  why is punishing the prostitutes better than punishing the buyers ? 
  everyone loves to blame every single flaw in the swedish society on `` rampant feminism '' ( or immigrants , but that has nothing to do with this discussion ) , but just look at our drug laws . 
  i do n't think it 's feminism that is the driving force , it 's a general attitude towards what is perceived as `` degenerate '' activities in one way or the other . 
  prostitution is at odds with a perception of the pure intercourse where all individuals are equal . 
  prostitution is not just a hetero-normative `` men buy women '' - thing either . 
  when it comes to drugs , i personally could stand behind a relaxation of some laws , when it comes to prostitution , i 'm happy with the current legislation . 
  ** edit : ** heavy emphasis on the * i think * s , there is a more down-to-earth motivation in the actual law . 
  i 'm kinda zoning out into an attempt to understand some kind of `` volksgeist '' or something . 
  i actually do n't know if i 'd label it as purely feminist , there 's an idea up here about the pure and respectful and genuine intercourse . 
  prostitution is kinda at odds with it . 
  i 'd rather call it a sexual idealist view . 
  sweden is a pretty moralist country , has always been . 
  moralist does n't always equal religious . 
  it 's illegal to buy because the idea is that selling sex for money is a kind of `` sexual self-harm '' . 
  according to this logic , prostitutes are harming themselves/letting others harm them ( or being harmed by being forced into prostitution ) and should therefor not be prosecuted . 
  me neither . 
  i have no problems discussing organized crime , or even the issues with the prevalence of crime in roma and traveller communities , but as soon as i point out that people should chill a little with the racisms and generalizations , i 'm a pc idiot who just `` does n't understand '' or `` have n't seen it with my own eyes '' . 
  the only one i did n't find racist was the first one . 
  the second one implies that you 're not racist if you say roma are bad because only `` bad roma '' call themselves roma ( which is something i 've never heard before . 
  roma is the ethnicity of people descending from north indian travellers that reach europe in medieval times . 
  that 's the definition . 
  period . ), 
  the third one implies that discrimination against roma is n't `` discrimination '' as i read it . 
  perhaps because `` all roma are criminals '' ( btw a lot = / = all ) . 
  the last one : all roma are thieves .
