  try britain !, 
  and carried out by the poor . 
  the people at the top are wealthy and educated , the henchmen usually are n't . 
  everyone points out that ghettos like molenbeek are hotbeds for extremism -- and the people that live there are poor , marginalised and are n't able to join the society . 
  how does that fit in with the view that most terrorists are middle class ? 
  it fits because the view is false . 
  most * important terrorists * that we get to read about are middle class , but they 're the minority . 
  the media focuses on them precisely because they break the norm !, 
  wrong . 
  what they 're doing is a way to circumvent regulations for * the rest of their car fleet * , meaning that all their other cars emit more carbon dioxide than they should . 
  the electric cars are n't the problem , they 're just the means to fool the system . 
  yes . 
  what they 're doing is a scam , and immoral , and legal . 
  and a problem , since climate change is n't a joke . 
  i was referring to this article , and what kia is currently doing . 
  if you do n't speak german , op [ translated the important parts ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3uef0n/abusing_eu_loopholes_kia_in_germany_is_selling/cxe59fk ) . 
  the reason that kia is doing it is because this is the only way they can go below the average limit set on their car fleet . 
  thus , since they do n't actually sell as many electric cars as they claim , the * rest * of their cars are actually emitting more than they 're allowed to . 
   if they buy the diesel instead they 're paying perhaps the same or less than the electric car no , the point is that the diesel is extremely inefficient for short distances , so electric is cheaper as a `` day-to-day '' car . 
  yes , the regulations are clearly rather toothless if they 're that easy to bypass . 
  it should n't be a matter of what cars are in the fleet , but rather how many cars are in use , or sold to customers ( but then there 's the problem of disqualifying everyone working for a car dealer as a customer , as this article shows ) . 
  ultimately , of course , the regulations are good of they 're followed , but a manufacturer 's emission rating needs to be based on how much its cars actually emit on the roads . 
  obvious to everyone , but they just need to bend the rules . 
  well . 
  it 's true , they * have * a worse emission profile than what we need them to have . 
  demonstrations ? 
  that 's the only time that it 's illegal to hide your face in sweden !, 
  okay , but now you 're using the word in a different manner than the intended . 
  the reason that people on this sub ( and lawmakers in switzerland ) says that `` radical islam must be curbed '' is because they put an equality sign between * radical * and * murdering terrorist * . 
  so , is every woman with a niqab about to bomb innocent civilians ? 
  at least they 're honest racists !, 
  it has n't been sold as a security matter , they always try to sell it as freedom for women . 
  is france trying to rid themselves of motorcyclists or something ? 
  well , in some countries ( and i 'm looking across the atlantic now ) doing that would probably be explicitly written in the guard 's job description . 
  technically he said `` god is great , '' which says nothing about his religion . 
  a christian would also say `` allahu akbar '' if he wanted to say `` god is great '' in arabic . 
  i would actually like a big damn reddit election , to see where sympathies lie . 
  probably just going to look like the general population , but still . 
  to add to that , i 'd say that terrorism is the act of holding the population as a sort of hostage through fear , generally in order to put pressure on the government . 
  so it 's related to blackmail . 
  exactly !, 
  [ relevant ] ( http://www.pri.org/stories/2014-09-29/world-actually-becoming-more-peaceful-believe-it-or-not ) . 
  german ? 
  is it intentional that your username is a swedish word ? 
  what do you mean ? 
  can you quote the parts you have a problem with for me ? 
  of course it 's resentment , a minority resenting the majority and the whole system , wanting to change it . 
  * exactly what the pro-isis terrorists want * . 
  there 's more to resentment than poverty though , and all your examples have resentment against the society in common . 
  the majority are n't . 
  the reason you often see it reported in the news is that it 's such a surprise -- it breaks the trend . 
  yes , isis actually have recruited some people with middle class backgrounds . 
  not a notable amount , it 's the fact that it has happened at all that is notable . 
  okay ? 
  and how do you explain the fact that other nations ( or cities ) with a large percentage of pro-isis individuals have n't experienced the same ? 
  just yesterday i read a post on this subreddit saying that gothenburg in sweden have [ one of the largest fractions of people travelling to syria to fight for isis ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3t1toy/swedish_city_of_gothenburg_largest_incubator_of ) , out of all european cities . 
  and yet gothenburg has n't been hit by terrorists , ** yet ** . 
  it may be attacked one day , it 's even probable that it happens , but just the fact that no attacks have happened does n't mean that they never will . 
  let 's think about the possibility that terrorists are planning an attack in gothenburg tomorrow . 
  if we look at our data today , and draw the conclusion `` all major attacks lately have been in france , i suppose we 're safe then '' our analysis would be faulty . 
  this is statistics , the art of drawing conclusions about the future by looking at the past . 
  and that 's why i 'm so `` concerned about statistics '' that you seem to scoff at . 
   and that 's the i 'm going to play dumb strategy , dismiss any reasoning with illustrative examples as `` just data points '' , and copy paste some saved links for canned answers to make me sound smart . 
  if you had n't been so fucking anti-intellectual ( a fancy word to describe people who actively avoid reason ) you might have read those links and actually learnt something . 
  you say that you are reasoning with illustrative examples ? 
  okay , this is how it works : reasoning built up by many examples are useful , reasoning built on few examples are useless . 
  though catching them gives the possibility of getting information . 
  name a terrorist that was caught , tried and convicted to anything less than life . 
  manhunt ? 
  he was on a small island and he called the police himself to surrender to them . 
   only the former has trouble with terrorism . 
  yet . 
  one can analyse these things over and over afterwards , but at some point people will start assigning reasons to things that does n't necessarily have any reason . 
  this is called [ hindsight bias ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hindsight_bias ) and is related to another bias called the [ historian 's fallacy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/historian%27s_fallacy ) . 
  it may well be the case that there are a lot of reasons that france has suffered two major terrorist attacks in paris in less than a year -- and it might be coincidence . 
  two data points does n't make a trend . 
  maybe portugal will be next , or maybe not . 
   i do n't understand the terrorist logic no need to feel bad on that count !, 
  not if they do n't speak swedish , which most people here ca n't -- as you very well know . 
  you are n't lying outright , but you are taking a quote out of context in order to hide the truth . 
  i suggest you further your agenda with real arguments instead , if you have any . 
  because of his interpretation of the policy , and of his job . 
  now he 's been told to fix that . 
  your `` translation '' make it sound like the problem still exists . 
  well , that description is n't representative of the text . 
  the article clearly shows that ( a ) it 's just that guy being an idiot , and ( b ) when the people in charge had a day to think it through they realised what a stupid thing it was to say , and changed gears . 
  the last part is rather obvious attempts to defuse the situation and squirming out of a bad spot . 
  what ? 
  the reason that the birth rate is low is because that 's evidently the number of kids that people * actually * want to have . 
  for the first time ^ 1 in history , people have the freedom to choose for real , and this is the choice they made . 
  1 : due to extremely low child mortality ( which means that people do n't have to sire four or five children if they want three ) . 
  a modern system of social security which is n't dependent on relatives to take care of the old . 
  a modern sense of workforce and employment , where children are n't required in order to work at the farm . 
  contraceptives . 
  allowing women to be educated and join the workforce , loosening the old view that their entire purpose in life is to be mothers . 
  no , actually . 
  maybe it is n't clear , now that i reread it it does look messy . 
  but he was quoting a quote , so the first paragraph of `` normal text '' is n't his words , but the ones he is answering to ( and disagreeing with ) . 
  only the last paragraph is written by the one you responded to . 
  he 's wondering why a suspected jihadi should be treated in a certain way , and rhetorically asks how someone suspected of another crime is treated .
