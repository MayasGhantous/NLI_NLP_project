  there will be other crises of course , but there will also be times of respite so we can catch our breath . 
  thanks  it was recently estimated that these numbers of refugees will cost sweden about 1 % of bnp . 
  that 's okay with me . 
  well , saying that it has nothing in all caps to do with it seems a bit much , do n't you think ? 
  as i said , forcefully deporting people from their homes is considered a crime against humanity under international law , serious business . 
  that 's of course only a factor when the refugees have settled down , so the challenge is to spread them out in a `` benevolent '' manner ( remember , resentment is bad for integration ) immediately when they arrive . 
  yes , that 's obviously a surprising lack of diplomacy . 
  i 'm not saying her methods are perfect , but the end result of spreading these refugees around a bit should n't be talked about like some doomsday scenario , it 's actually beneficial for everyone . 
  let 's be honest , there are n't that many refugees , the day to day life of you and me wo n't change in the slightest . 
  that poll is bogus though , probably a one time statistical fluke or something . 
  source : i 'm swedish and pretty much every poll ever ( except that one ) puts the sweden democrats squarely in third place behind the social democrats and the moderates . 
  they do * not * have 25 % of the voters behind them . 
  what they do have , however , is one piece of questionable statistics which they toot around for all they 're worth , to try to inflate themselves in the eyes of the world . 
  this does n't work well in sweden , because most people know that their grand claims are n't representative of reality , but i suppose i ca n't blame foreign media like the guardian for getting fooled . 
  ** edit ** i 'll add some more explanation of the issue , since i see i got a bit of downvote . 
  putting questionable sources to the question clearly does n't fit someone 's agenda . 
  we had an election just under a year ago , sd got 13 % . 
  they made a really impressive surge for the election , they worked hard and it paid off , 13 % is a lot . 
  since then their momentum has really slowed down , they are n't seen in the media very often anymore ( compared to what we usually see from them ) . 
  somehow , they are supposed to have * doubled * their number of voters ? 
  what ? 
  no-one did a reality check there ? 
  it 's completely unreasonable , especially since their beloved , charismatic leader has been out of action for the better part of the year due to stress . 
  besides , they are currently embroiled in an ( unrelated ) crisis of leadership which threatens to split the party in two , making it possible that they 'll lose a big chunk of their base . 
  again , 25 % of the voters is a complete fairytale . 
  of the * serious * polls made , the one that gave them the highest number said 17 % , though that might be a little much . 
  so serious polls puts them somewhere between 11 % and 17 % , personally i would be very surprised at anything above 15 % since their momentum after the election has been wobbly . 
  and that assumes they get out from their current crisis smelling of roses . 
  excellent . 
  there are n't that many refugees , if they spread out a bit you wo n't even notice them . 
  if all of them tries to live in the same patch of the country it will turn into a ghetto of course , that would be bad . 
  agreed , but the problem is getting them to decide to separate . 
  i mean that we need to make sure there are * incentives * to spread out , it looks very totalitarian if we were to rip them all away from each other to spread them out over europe according to quotas on a grid . 
  feels too much like stalin 's deportations and forced population transfers ( which is considered a crime against humanity by the icc , by the way ) . 
  nudging the refugees to take the `` right '' decision is less effective in the short run than deportations , but more effective in the long run . 
  their first experience in their new country should n't be something that builds resentment against the state , * that * would kill integration . 
  are you drunk ? 
  how have you `` invalidated '' my point with `` evidence ? '', 
  please , i 'm really curious now . 
  to invalidate my point ( which was that i 've seen several different kinds of sprinklers/showers/fountains to choose from ) you 'd need to show that only this kind and no other ones exist . 
  you told me that these are used by universal studios . 
  well , unless you are proposing that universal studios make up the whole of the known world your information simply is n't a relevant answer to my post . 
  yes , sure , and so are other kinds of sprinklers , showers , fountains or water dispensers and so on . 
  how common these are is irrelevant , my point was only that there are others ( as evidenced by the fact that i 've seen others ) . 
  they do n't have some monopoly on the market , no matter how many people write to me to say that they have actually seen these before . 
  i just added an afterword to my post to hopefully make my point a bit clearer . 
  yes , yes , i 'm sure . 
  and it 's completely beside the point . 
  i just added an afterword to my post to explain myself . 
  okay ? 
  i 'm completely uninterested in how widespread they might or might not be . 
  i wrote that ** i 've seen other solutions ** as a proof that , i dunno , there exists other solutions . 
  the person i answered seemed to think that this solution was the only thinkable one , i disagreed ( and got downvoted , because there can clearly not be more than one way to solve a problem ) . 
  you should do two things : * read my post again . 
  you missed my point completely , my point was that there are many , many solutions to this problem . 
  i questioned the use if this particular solution , when there are so many others . 
  * go read something about psychology before making statements about it . 
  makes you look slightly more serious . 
  yup . 
  because being born in a country means that i have spent 100 % of my time in it , right ? 
  no wait , it does n't . 
  maybe , but how is that important to the discussion ? 
  i just pointed out that they are not the only kind , and so there are other alternatives , which could have been chosen instead . 
  i have never before seen water sprinklers in heat waves that look anything like these . 
  ** it 's pretty clear that you could come up with any number of different solutions to the problem ** , and different designs too . 
  and , perhaps , not choose the one that is completely tasteless . 
  i 'm not easily offended , that 's not what this is about . 
  i mean , the holocaust was more than seventy years ago , and i could laugh at some joke about the gas chambers if well made , but i would n't do so in front of a holocaust survivor , or when visiting auschwitz , because that would be rather disgusting . 
  there 's such a thing as a time and a place , and there 's such a thing as taste . 
  ** edit ** this has probably been the most misunderstood post of my life , so i 'll highlight the important part above in bold , for those who find my meaning hard to grasp . 
  for some reason , people have been telling me that they have indeed seen these sprinklers in other places . 
  well , * no shit * , i was n't implying that this is some kind of custom job for auschwitz ( because that would be strange indeed ) . 
  i wrote that i have seen sprinklers used in heatwaves before , but not this particular kind , as a way to point out that ** there are many sprinklers in this world ** and they do n't all look the same . 
  all of them do n't draw the mind to gas chambers , and so i found it unnecessary to use thus particular design in this particular place . 
  i 'm not sure how to explain this in simpler terms , so i 'm done now . 
  that 's very true . 
  a perfect description of lund , a university town in southern sweden where i live . 
  everybody takes the bike here since students ca n't afford cars , but no-one really wants to pay for bikes ( or proper locks ) either so people just use the closest bike . 
  i 'd have thought that the netherlands would be at the world top in tolerance of homosexuals . 
  * beat * after all , you 're famous for your dykes . 
  exactly !, 
  i speak swedish and english , and i understand some german , and written dutch is surprisingly managable . 
  spoken dutch is like something from another planet though . 
  much like danish now that i think about it . 
  the second biggest conspiracy theory in sweden is that all the beggars are part of some big , nefarious organisation . 
  somehow this organisation makes a lot of money , and every beggar drives a bmw in his spare time . 
  there are for warships ' hulls , at least . 
  did they win any money ? 
  that 's a common myth . 
  as i said earlier , automation replaces some jobs , but creates other jobs ( which ends up being more numerous than the ones that disappeared ) . 
  someone has to design robots , program them , build them , sell them , service them or repair them . 
  also , since automation is more effective than human labour it helps the production/economy as a whole , which both creates jobs and raises salaries . 
  then , finally , we have the scientific breakthroughs that are facilitated more rapidly , all scientific breakthroughs obviously create new jobs on the `` cutting edge '' of things , jobs that might have been completely unknown just a decade earlier . 
  well , you forgot to factor in all the bribes to everyone involved ... 
  the point is that romanians have never been given the chances that greece has been offered , nor will they be . 
  / u/mynsc wanted to point out a double standard -- that the further east a country is , the less people care . 
  robots and new technology create jobs . 
  they remove some jobs , those with the lowest qualifications , but they give more jobs than they take . 
  and they also like to retire 5-10 years earlier than we do where i come from . 
  no-one forces them to accept any agreements .
