  your numbers are lower than wikipedia 's , and i know which one i 'd rather trust . 
  even if your numbers were correct and there was n't any more arabs than jews * today * the large difference in birth rates would change that in a generation or two . 
  palestinians on average have a much higher birth rate than israeli jews have on average , mainly because of the difference in education levels ( especially for women ) . 
  the orthodox jews make up too small a part of israel 's demographics to have an impact on that . 
  and why are you so obsessed with what 's allowed , i hope you know that people sometimes do things that are n't allowed ? 
  such as cross a border . 
  as i said , those borders have already been crossed once ( and are in fact still crossed every day ) , it 's obviously very possible . 
  first of all , the israeli borders are fairly well guarded compared to many other countries ' borders , but it 's not watertight . 
  it 's not the demilitarized zone between north and south korea with a thick area of landmines , it 's very possible to get through , as evidenced by the fact that people are getting through . 
  second , it 's a moot point . 
  it does n't matter how well the israeli guard their borders as i 'm not talking about israeli borders -- i 'm talking about palestinians in jordan going back into palestine , before palestine is incorporated into israel . 
  do you think the two countries will turn into one state in a single day , with no advance notice like a bolt of lightning from a clear blue sky ? 
  pretty much anyone who wants to move will have time to move . 
  third , you 're bringing up palestinian passports ? 
  well , if those are the papers you want to use you already have a bigger problem than even i predicted , because the palestinians in jordan ( yes , the 2-3 million that you choose to ignore ) already have palestinian passports !, 
  and there 's also a special deal between palestine and jordan that let 's * jordanian * authorities issue palestine passports to the ones that do n't have any . 
  this deal came about because jordan does n't want to take care of all those people indefinitely , so they do n't want them to get jordanian passports , and at the same time they ca n't be stateless . 
  if it looks like the one-state solution could ever be close to reality jordan would see to it that the bureaucracy is well oiled when it comes to making sure that every palestinian in jordan has a passport , and then they could even cross the border legally !, 
  you 're denying the reality here in favour of wishful thinking . 
  consider that maybe the one-state solution is n't all that good ? 
  which is why i counted out almost all of them . 
  i did n't include the palestinians living abroad and overseas . 
  did you read it ? 
  i included the ones in the immediate vicinity , those who are basically still in and around palestine , except that they have fled over a border to be a bit safer . 
  they are going to cross back over that border again if palestinians * en masse * are incorporated into the state of israel and given citizenship , as that would work hugely in their favour . 
  they passed the border by sneaking past it once , it 's not as if it 's a watertight seal . 
  even if we do n't include a single palestinian living outside today 's palestinian and israeli borders ( which is a pipe dream ) , the number is still 4.75 + 1.75 = 6.5 million , more than 6 million !, 
  the jews would be a minority in a one-state israel , however you look at it . 
  considering that the * taliban * were the authorities i 'm surprised they did n't just shoot the both of them to stop their whining . 
  [ i worked out the numbers ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5xsfme/jews_in_europe_in_1933_and_today/dekns3t ) of how many palestinians and other arabs israel would have to accommodate if they pursue their one-state policy . 
  at least 10 million non-jews to their 6 million jews , with the clear implication being that such a state could either be a jewish state or a democratic one , but not both . 
  not at all . 
  as he said , * if * the one-state solution is pursued , so you have to count the palestinians . 
  the [ number of palestinians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/palestinians ) in the world is approximately 12 million , twice the number of jews in israel . 
  if we do n't count those who have moved overseas and only count the ones in israel , in palestine , or in the immediate vicinity we get 4.75 million in palestine + 1.75 million in israel + 2-3 million in jordan and an unknown number in syria ( it was half a million in 2001 ) and some hundred thousands in lebanon . 
  apart from the palestinians , we might want to count other arabs and muslims as well , that are n't ethnic palestinians . 
  and do n't go talking about orthodox jews ' birth numbers , the birth numbers in palestine is just as high , and the orthodox are a comparatively small group of the jews . 
  even with a conservative estimate we arrive at a number of 10 million non-jews , to 6 million jews . 
  that 's the problem with their one-state policy , the resulting state would be either a jewish state or a democracy , they can only pick one . 
  i did n't say i was n't jealous :'(, 
  you have more beer and chips you need to burn . 
  have n't seen many ski tracks in denmark . 
  romania : `` joke 's on you , we do n't get 2.5 hours of leisure time a week ! '', 
   however , female couples have more parental rights than male couples , ** given that ** a law allowing equal access to in vitro fertilization ( ivf ) and artificial insemination was legalized in 2006 . 
  [ ... ] i can write it like this too . 
  he listed the ways to have children . 
  1 , adoption is legal for both men and women , heterosexual and homosexual . 
  2 , ivf is possible for women , not for men . 
  3 , surrogacy is illegal for everyone . 
  if you go through that list carefully and compare it point by point you 'll notice that the only part that might be construed as an inequality is that ivf is open to women and not men . 
  and it 's obvious that this is what he was referring to , as he said * `` given that '' * in his comment , the part i underlined . 
  you cut that part out because the original quote did n't work for you , you needed to misrepresent it . 
  and ivf being possible for women and not men is n't in fact an inequality , as it is not the law 's fault . 
  the problem lies with biology/technology , we do n't currently have the technology to have a man carry a child , but i 'm sure it will come . 
  if it had been possible then having ivf closed to men would indeed have been an inequality , and i would have been pissed about it , but today ivf is simply not applicable to men . 
  the world is larger than the one country you 're in . 
  marriages here are n't expensive/difficult/time-consuming to end . 
  it does n't have to be any harder than dissolving a civil union . 
  good thing that he did n't frame the surrogacy question as an equal rights question then . 
  it was just a note describing the ways to have children artificially , ending with the reminder that surrogacy is illegal for everyone , regardless of gender or orientation . 
  he did n't say that gay men should have the right to surrogacy , so i do n't see the point of your comment . 
  what he did note is that ivf is an option open to women and not to men , but this is because of biology and not because the law excludes men . 
  if it had been possible to insert a fertilised egg into a gay man who wants a child i 'm sure it would have been just as legal , the law is n't the problem . 
  that 's because it has nothing to do with adoption , and that was never claimed either . 
  he only said that two women have more options to become mothers compared to two men who want to become fathers , as they can use ivf . 
  and that is not a legal problem but a biological one , so it 's not the law being skewed in favour of women . 
  guess they have to do better next year !, 
  we know it in sweden at least , but then we are n't far from germany . 
  i 'm not surprised that it 's not well known outside of europe , in all the movies people see ss troops with black uniforms instead . 
  oh germans < 3 who would ever call you boring !, 
  exactly !, 
  i love political cartoons , it would be nice if there 's some website collecting them ... and then they could be from all over the spectrum too , the problem with getting all cartoons from the same source it 's that it 's not really dialogue . 
   a very unbiased comparison between cologne and d\u00fcsseldorf , probably . 
  of course it is , a d\u00fcsseldorfer told me so !, 
  sure , i think -- like the guy you seemed like you disagreed with above -- that it is members of the elite ( s ) that shape and define our narrative . 
  and the pro-remain elite is one comprised of mainstream politicians and the pro-brexit elite is one of bankers and foreign businessmen , and non-mainstream politicians . 
  none of them are the working class , but i think it 's more likely that the former elite might give the working class a thought every once in a while -- i know for a fact that the bankers wo n't . 
  i think we agree , but we are focusing on different parts of it . 
   this is the core of it . 
  ** whether or not it was wise ** , people felt this was the only way they could say `` fuck you . '', 
  and * that * is the con , this is where people were fooled . 
  the mistake lies in believing that this was a reasonable way of protesting against the `` elite . '', 
  i 'm all for protesting if you feel like you need it , but you do n't have to shoot yourself in the foot . 
  brexit only helps shady bankers and others in the `` elite . '', 
  we ca n't try to argue like everyone voting for brexit wants the same thing , because they do n't . 
  of course there 's a hard core of euroskeptics like there always has been , and of course there 's a movement against globalisation , and all of those guys would always have been for a british exit and against joining eu in the first place . 
  even if their numbers have grown some since the uk voted to join the eu they are still not enough to force a brexit . 
  they are n't  50 % . 
  it 's influencing the swing vote that matters , the guys that are n't really sure what they think . 
  and of course i 'm not claiming that the entire stupid populace was conned , but enough of them were to affect the swing vote and thus the result of the referendum . 
  it 's a fact that there 's a significant number of brits who voted for brexit to say `` fuck you '' to some poorly defined `` elite , '' apparently without considering that they 're playing into another ( and shadier ) elite 's hands . 
  okej anders . 
  yes , but it does n't make his point any less true . 
  is it elitist to say that people 's opinions are fabricated ? 
  i suppose , but they are still fabricated . 
  but then it 's the same with trump . 
  a lot of working class people voted for him and thinks he 'll be the one to listen to them and their problems . 
  a * billionaire * , really ? 
  very anti-elitist there , good job . 
  it 's a circle , the extreme left and the extreme right are often indistinguishable .
