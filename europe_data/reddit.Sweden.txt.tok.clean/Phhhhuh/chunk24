  the empire collapsed , as in the order of society , the * people * of the empire survived . 
  they were n't destroyed by barbarians , their government was . 
  i think it would be practically impossible for you to have less than 50 % italian dna in you , simply due to the vast number of italians alive in italy even after the migrations . 
  but if you by `` roman stock '' only mean the guys from the actual city of rome then sure , maybe it 's lower depending on what part of italy you 're from . 
  something like 25-30 generations ago . 
  the [ most recent common ancestor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/most_recent_common_ancestor ) of all europeans is thought to have lived around the 1300s . 
  but that 's the * single * closest common ancestor , if we go further back in time a larger and larger percentage of the population are going to be ancestors of all of us ( because they , living in the 1100s for instance , are ancestors of that mrca guy of the 1300s ) . 
  eventually we reach a point in time where * everyone * whose descendants were n't wiped out became the ancestor of us all . 
  this is true of everyone living around the year 800 ( and before , naturally ! ), 
  including charlemagne . 
  so by this we can say with a certainty that we are descendants of charlemagne , ( he had 18 children , all of their lines ca n't have been wiped out ) but not of julius caesar ( he had one daughter , who died in childbirth along with her child , and possibly also a son by cleopatra who was killed by augustus ) . 
  of course , but the area known as finland on this map has invaded poland . 
  so if we are to follow this map 's partitioning of countries , then the joint country of sweden and finland has invaded poland . 
  but finland is n't coloured , even though it was a part of sweden at the time . 
  so technically poland was invaded by sweden-finland . 
  that 's a very serious problem , but it 's also rooted in the fact that people watch things they agree with . 
  the fact that liberals in the west only follow liberal news and that conservatives only follow conservative news is another part of the the same problem . 
  one does n't invalidate the other . 
  so the wrong side won the american civil war ? 
  something -- and it 's not due to trump personally because he 's just a symptom of it -- has made almost every kind of political discussion turn out this way in recent years . 
  ten years ago i often had intense political discussions with people disagreeing with me , on all kinds of issues , but they were still `` serious '' debates and not just shouting matches and straw men . 
  now it 's all like kids in a sandbox . 
   terrorist supporters what . 
  source ? 
  no , there are tons of therapy to help you get to terms with who you are . 
  cognitive behavioural therapy , classic psychotherapy , you name it . 
  just not , y' know , fake shit that tells you that you can change the sexuality you 've got , because that 's a lie . 
  we 're on ineverreddit.com , did n't you get the memo ? 
  while that fallacy is very important to be aware of , i do n't think it 's relevant to what he said . 
  he just said that you should n't take anything to extremes , which is sensible advice . 
  extremists have , so far in history , never been the right choice once . 
  they are the worst . 
  why ? 
  honest question here , i 'm not sure about the connotations . 
  kebab pizza is the king of drunk foods !, 
   maybe you should stop attacking turks in r/k \u00fcrdistan and r/syriancivilwar . 
  there have been no attacks in this thread . 
  how thin skin have you ? 
  i could n't find any attacks in this user 's comment history either , so it looks like you 're just making this up . 
   pkk is not related with this thread . 
  yes , a little bit , because erdogan sometimes pushes `` crazy '' decisions with the motivation that it 's for the `` safety of the realm '' or so . 
  impopular decisions can be pushed through ** if ** they 're phrased as a part of , say , fighting pkk or any other enemy . 
  in this case it 's not applicable , which is why / u/cengiz _ han 's [ comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5dlmxi/turkeys_ruling_akp_proposes_rapists_be_released/da5ixcd ) is interpreted as tongue-in-cheek by anyone who does n't have so thin skin . 
  he means that maybe the ratio of unreported to reported crime changed . 
  i agree , and treating nazis ( or people with similar beliefs ) is used as a standard case in medical ethics . 
  depends on where you are of course , but the salute is illegal in germany . 
  if a police officer had been there that guy would have been arrested and charged with a crime ( which is exactly what happened to two chinese tourists at brandenburger tor the other week -- they face up to 2 years in prison ) . 
  trying to detain someone who has n't broken the law is of course weird and pointless . 
  but your scenario is a no-win . 
  if you assume that germany could take on everyone and succeed , going so far as to occupy britain , then it 's game over . 
  does n't matter one whit what sweden chose to do in a scenario like that , barring the development of nuclear weapons perhaps . 
  i fully agree that the military access is n't something we 're proud of , that was horrible . 
  but it was obviously not an easy situation , saying no and getting invaded is n't great either . 
  in any case it 's easy for us to be armchair generals today , the men and women making these decisions back in the day had it far worse than we could imagine . 
  they rarely go really * bad * , as in rotten , but they taste better the fresher they are . 
  in sweden eggs are never ( or rarely , at least ) sold from a refridgerator , but i and many others keep our eggs in the fridge . 
  it 's not necessary of course , but they stay fresher a little bit longer . 
  when i run out of space in my fridge it 's the eggs that go first !, 
  the fridges sold in scandinavia are often sold with a little egg space at the top of the door , holes to put them in . 
  snapphane and proud !, 
  you spelled `` poor student '' wrong . 
  yeah , and that makes perfect sense to me . 
  in sk\u00e5ne we are far from `` our '' capital and less than an hour from the danish one . 
  copenhagen has the largest airport in scandinavia which makes sense for hosting a eu agency , and it 's all around closer to the continent . 
  having the agency in copenhagen creates jobs not only in denmark but on the swedish side as well , but the guys in stockholm has never understood this . 
  politicians in sk\u00e5ne tried to lobby the government into backing the danish bid because a two-country joint bid would be stronger than two separate bids , but of course they did n't listen . 
  separation of powers does mean that none of the three branches can be fully controlled by one of the others . 
  you 're right that it looks slightly different in each country , the details are n't the same , but no branch can be fully subservient to the others . 
  if it was then it would n't be a branch in its own right , it would just be a part of another branch , that would indeed be game changing . 
  this is how separation works , and that 's why i made the jib about your school -- they should have covered this . 
  just because there are elections involved it 's not automatically democracy , in that case china would be a democracy !, 
  it 's not that simple . 
   that 's not what the polish bill allows wrong . 
  it would allow the justice minister to sack any judge of the supreme court . 
   now , my point was that the separation of power doesnt mean that the parliament , for instance , cant ** control ** or even appoint some people in the supreme court . 
  so how is that different from the polish bill ? 
  separation definitely means that parliament , or government , ca n't be allowed to control the courts . 
  appointing judges is alright , but combining this with the power to sack any judge at any time is not , that changes the game completely . 
  okay , let 's explain this to you then , there are several things you do n't understand . 
  you say :  you 're supreme court is appointed/controlled by the government/parliament and right there you have two huge errors . 
  appointing someone to the supreme court and ** controlling ** the supreme court are two wildly different things . 
  the main thing here is that the executive branch appoints justices , but that does n't mean that they can arbitrarily toss judges out again if they are n't happy with court rulings , and this gives the court independence . 
  this is the notion of * tenure * , and it 's the same privilege that professors at universities across the world enjoy , which means that they are able to express their opinions on even controversial matters without fear of upsetting someone who could fire them . 
  tenure of some kind , either for life ( or until voluntary retirement ) as many professors have , or for a predetermined time period , is a hallmark of courts around the world . 
  with the proposed reforms in poland , justices of the supreme court could be fired at will by the justice minister , meaning that they need to follow his orders or be replaced with someone who does . 
  the second thing you do n't understand is the difference between the executive and the legislative branches ( i hope i do n't have to tell you that the supreme court and its lower courts make up the judiciary branch ) . 
  you mix up `` government/parliament '' like they 're the same thing , when the whole point is that they 're not . 
  the government , the leader of state plus his/her ministers , are the executive branch and they are held accountable to the legislative ( law-making ) branch , which is the parliament , who in turn are held accountable to the people . 
  again , separation of powers . 
  i suppose you do n't care about , or do n't understand , the difference of who is held accountable to who , when you do n't care about whether members of the judiciary is appointed by the executive or the legislative . 
  it is in fact normal for the executive branch to be the one to * appoint * judges to the supreme court , but * without * the ability to control it or be able to replace judges at will once they 're appointed . 
  it works the same in the us for instance , the president ( head of executive ) appoints justices to the supreme court when there 's a vacancy , but once appointed they 're independent because they serve for life -- they have tenure . 
  if you had read the link you sent me you 'd notice that there 's nothing strange about sweden in this regard . 
  i quote from the wikipedia article :  the supreme court consists of 16 justices ( swedish : * justitier\u00e5d * ) who are appointed by the government , but the court as an institution is independent of the * riksdag * [ parliament ] , and the government is not able to interfere with the decisions of the court . 
  separation of powers is n't violated . 
  do you understand this now , or do you need another bout in school ? 
  but it 's not `` rule of law '' if someone is above the law , so it would have to be a dictatorship where the dictator is constrained by the laws . 
  in theory we could imagine it , but i do n't think it has ever happened ( except with the legally appointed temporary dictators during the roman republic , but that 's a rather different use of the term dictator than today 's -- that 's more akin to a commander-in-chief during a state of emergency ) . 
  because democracy rests on a separation of powers , a separation which is thrown out the window with these reforms ... ? 
  do n't they have schools where you come from ?
