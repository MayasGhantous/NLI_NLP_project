  the total number of convictions for sexual offences , which includes rape but also less severe crimes such as buying sexual services , was 1160 . 
   sweden also applies a system of expansive offence counts [ ... ] for example , if a woman says she has been raped by her husband every day during a month , the swedish police may record more than 30 cases of rape . 
  in many other countries only a single offence would be counted in such a situation . 
   in sweden , the definition of rape has been successively widened over the years , leading to an ever larger number of sexual assaults being classified as rape . 
  for example , in 1992 a legislative change came into force which shifted the dividing line between sexual assault and rape . 
  this legislative change resulted in about a 25 % increase in the level of registered rape offences . 
   changes in the legal process has also affected the number of reports . 
  until 1984 , rape was only prosecuted in cases where the victim was prepared to press charges , with an additional restriction of a six months time limit . 
  this resulted in numerous cases of rape and sexual assault going unreported .

  the guy i replied to said that homosexuals do n't get killed in christian countries . 
  that 's a blatant lie , and i pointed that out . 
  christian religion in a country does n't save anyone from violent oppression and discrimination , like he implied . 
  christianity is n't the root of africa 's problems ( and i never said so ) , but neither is it the root of european tolerance -- secularism and the belief in universal human rights are . 
  those values stem from the enlightenment movement , not from christianity . 
   have fun in your no go neighborhoods have fun believing fox news . 
  did i say that ? 
  angola . 
  central african republic . 
  all christian countries , all places where you 're likely to get killed if anyone finds out you 're homosexual . 
  tories had a majority ,  50 % of the seats in parliament , then theresa may decided to be greedy and call a premature election because apparently a majority is n't enough . 
  now they lost their majority . 
  they were already in a tough spot for brexit negotiations , and now it 's even worse . 
  so calling him jeb bush instead of just jeb is like saying atm machine or pin number , got it . 
  it 's uncertainty all the way down . 
  what would marx himself be then ? 
  a marxist presumably , so would a marxist extremist then be something more radical than the inventor ? 
  what ? 
  soon you 'll tell me that their mission is n't to explore strange new worlds . 
  yep . 
  we have the verb , but not the word for the substantive ( the stick ) used to perform the verb . 
  he pretends like it has n't happened . 
  politicians in free democracies are n't in the habit of idolising someone while admitting that the idol 's prisons were full of political prisoners . 
  it 's bad for polling numbers . 
  hey , i 'm not denying that castro did * some * good things for cubans , but then you ca n't deny that he was an oppressive dictator who imprisoned , tortured and killed those who disagreed with him . 
  because he did all of those things , the good and the bad . 
  in swedish * ficka * is pocket , that 's why i asked , and `` pocket pr\u00fcgel '' for dick would make sense too . 
  `` fick - '' means pocket ? 
   a few, 
  yep , but i 'd say he was n't 100 % serious . 
  the joke is of course that we 're in / r/europe now . 
  i would have preferred to live under castro , but having different political ideas than the leader ended no differently in cuba than in germany . 
  imprisonment , torture and execution for peaceful political opposition , and any `` undesirable '' really . 
  what makes hitler worse is that he extended the definition of undesirable to people who had done nothing at all , not even disagreed with him once , if they were unlucky enough to be born to parents of the wrong ethnicity . 
  but both castro and hitler oppressed and killed their people . 
  isis has been feeling the `` crusade '' for quite some time now , and they 've lost most of their conquests . 
  still , fighting ( and being fought by ) the `` crusader '' gives them their identity and so gives new recruits who want to join something bigger than themselves . 
  it 'll burn itself out eventually as finally even their fans become disillusioned by how they 're getting their asses kicked down in syria and iraq . 
  but that 's just isis , not islamism more broadly . 
  the problem is that it 's an idea , or an ideology . 
  in a war you 're fighting someone with a specific nationality which makes it easy , here you 'd be fighting anyone with a specific conviction . 
  even if you kill every single person ever born in the middle east your neighbour might become muslim next week , reading about it on the internet and getting enamored . 
  read on the cold war for the dangers of fighting an ideology , read about things like [ kim philby ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kim_philby ) -- there are many books on him , * a spy among friends * being fairly new , and many documentaries . 
  the tl ; dr is that he was a brit from a fairly upper class family who went to cambridge and did well for himself . 
  what no one knew was that he read a bit too much of marx and became a zealous communist . 
  he was found and recruited by the kgb , and they nudged him to get in touch with the mi6 which he ended up joining . 
  he rose through the ranks until he was very , very highly placed , and remained in place for decades . 
  it 's impossible to determine how many british ( and allied ) agents was found and killed because of his leaks compromising their cover . 
  well , it sounds good when you say that but i do n't know . 
  i mean , everyone always claim that `` now we 're doing all we can , '' or putting in extra resources , after a terrorist attack . 
  it 's probably even true . 
  so what would be different this time ? 
  how would the terrorists suddenly know that this time it 's not bluster , and the police did n't just get lucky when arresting some guys last week , * this * time it 's for real . 
  this time the police will really find them within the next couple of weeks so they better act right now . 
  i just think it 's a quite detailed assessment of the police 's operational capabilities , something the public do n't have . 
  sure . 
  and i hear that hitler built the autobahn , so that 's great , i 've been using that myself . 
  _ \\* crickets \\* _, 
  yup , that 's what isis hopes for anyway . 
  they 've come right out and said it in their propaganda newspaper dabiq . 
  this from cnn on it :  isis ' goal is to divide the world into two camps : `` the crusaders '' and `` the caliphate . '', 
  no christians living in muslim lands ; no muslims living in christian countries . 
  its message to western muslims : you do n't belong there . 
  come to the caliphate where you can live as a true muslim . 
   * `` this revival of the khil\u0101fah gave each individual muslim a concrete and tangible entity to satisfy his natural desire for belonging to something greater , '' * isis said in a recent edition of its online magazine dabiq . 
   in the same edition -- alongside interviews with isis fighters , articles praising `` martyrs '' and gruesome photos of its beheaded and burned victims -- isis argued that muslims in the west are living in a `` grayzone . '', 
   `` grayzones '' are areas where muslims practice their religion peacefully in non-muslim countries . 
  isis wants to eliminate these zones , in part by turning non-muslims against their muslim neighbors . 
  each terrorist attack chips away a little more grayzone , as westerners marginalize muslims , pushing them , isis hopes , into the caliphate 's open arms . 
   * `` muslims in the crusader countries will find themselves driven to abandon their homes for a place to live in the [ caliphate ] , as the crusaders increase persecution against muslims living in western lands . 
  [ ... ] '' * -- http://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/31/us/islamerica-excerpt-grayzones/ isis and the hardliners in europe ( and in this thread ) who want to stop terrorism `` by any means necessary '' are in perfect agreement : both want western countries to kick out muslims and persecute the ones that remain . 
  for this reason alone i ca n't agree with the `` hardline '' crew . 
  source ? 
  i think socialism have some very good answers to certain questions ( looking at you , healthcare ) , but i wish fewer actual socialists said such crazy shit . 
  surely there 's a way to work for a strong welfare state while acknowledging that hamas are scum and castro was an oppressive dictator ? 
  can i have socialism without the socialists ? 
  now * that * would actually be nice , a light at the end of the tunnel ? 
  seems a bit too rational though , does n't it , it kind of supposes that the terrorists have very good intel about what the police are up to and capable of . 
  there * is * a copycat factor , there 's no denying that . 
  there almost always are with heavily publicised crimes , and terrorism never fails to make the front page ... 
  the perps were n't born radical , they were radicalised through propaganda , and propaganda takes money to produce . 
  even if they bought the knives in a standard uk hardware store , there 's a money trail somewhere . 
  and at the end of that trail , more likely than not , sits a qatari businessman or a saudi prince , rich as fuck on oil exports to europe and america . 
  saudis are bankrolling so many terrorist cells it 's ridiculous . 
  if the saudis did n't have it so fat they could n't sponsor so many terrorists . 
  that 's not appeasement , that 's going on the offensive . 
  why could n't x change too ? 
  it has n't been static over time . 
  jihadists are a real fucking problem , but nothing is gained by being dishonest about it . 
  yes , it definitely is .
