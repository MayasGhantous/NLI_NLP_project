  too bad the majority of the people disagrees with you . 
  it 's definitely a sliding scale , with more legitimacy the more democratic ( i.e. 
  when the elections are closer representation of the people ) it is , if your political system is based on democracy of course . 
  but i had to disagree when you said the polish-lithuanian king was n't democratically elected , even though we both agree that this does n't mean that the election process for those kings were somehow equal to modern democracies . 
  the word `` democracy '' does n't mean a single thing , there are various interpretations of it . 
  yours is n't necessarily the universal one . 
  if the king is elected by the aristocracy that 's still a democratic process , it 's just not * as * democratic as if the whole people elected him . 
  the roman republic was a democracy , even though not every man had the right to vote , and some men had more votes than others . 
  before women had the right to vote we were still living in democracies here in europe -- less democratical , sure , but democracies nonetheless . 
  our democracies today still are n't a `` perfect '' representation of the people , we typically have age limits for instance , and many countries take away the right to vote for convicted criminals ( either for the duration of their prison sentence or even for the rest of their lives ) . 
  we are unlikely to ever end up with a `` perfect '' democracy . 
  your ignorance of this shows that you do n't fully grasp the concept of democracy , you seem to believe it only applies to the specific system you live in . 
  and so it 's obvious to us all that you have n't in fact read every piece of literature on the subject , because then you 'd know that yours is the opinion that 's contradicted in said literature . 
  yes , of course it 's not a perfect example . 
  for one thing , there 's the difference in time , descendants of european settlers have been living in sa for a lot longer . 
  you 're not wrong , they * are * , but it 's like saying that the white population of south africa should all go away . 
  it 's hard to argue that those that are born there should be held responsible for what the previous generations have done . 
  i mean . 
  it would be great if no russians had settled estonia , and it would be great if no white colonists had come to south africa , so we agree with the result -- it 's just hard to enforce . 
  i know , and sweden had a bicameral house until 1971 , i ( personally ) just do n't see a point in two chambers in a non-federation . 
  in a federation the second chamber has some justification because different regions might require representation in this way . 
  in a non-federation the second chamber is usually there to represent different social classes , as some feudal vestige ( the way they do it in the uk , and the way we did it in sweden while we had a bicameral house ) . 
  mmm , okay . 
  we do n't have states so we have a one-chamber parliament . 
   seriously , this is why the us requires a 2/3 super majority to change the constitution . 
  there 's a lot of devastating changes being enacted in europe on marginal majorities . 
  that 's a good rule . 
  and especially since that 's 2/3 of * parliament * ( or congress , as you 'd say ) , which is a lot different than 50 % or 2/3 of the general public 's vote in a referendum . 
  members of parliament are at least suppose to know something about politics , and they should be a little harder to dupe . 
  in sweden we have the rule that the constitution can only be changed if it 's voted through parliament twice , with a general election in between . 
  so if some insane change is somehow voted through we have the opportunity to get rid of those mps until the next round . 
  it really depends on what `` dissolving the parliament '' means . 
  does it just mean calling for a new election ahead of time ? 
  that 's fair , that 's possible in almost any democracy as you said ( the brits just did it ) . 
  but i take it to mean that erdogan keeps his seat and * only * parliament is dissolved , since he is the president and his seat is determined by a presidential election ( i.e. 
  not the same election in which parliament is chosen ) . 
  if you allow me to nitpick , a slippery slope is a logical fallacy but that does n't make it an incorrect argument . 
  it can still be used in a perfectly correct manner . 
  what that means , being a logical fallacy , is only that it ca n't be used as a rule to prove or generalise what * must * happen . 
  let 's say someone tries to make the following argument : `` we ca n't have lower prison sentences than we have today , because where will it end , are criminals to get away scot free ? '', 
  that argument does n't work because of the logical fallacy . 
  there 's nothing that says the shortening of prison sentences * must * continue , and so the result ca n't be assumed , it may very well be that there 's some point where the trend stops ( or is stopped ) . 
  if people agree on such a threshold that they 'll never cross beforehand they wo n't have to worry about the slippery slope , because then the trend will come to an end at an acceptable point . 
  * however * , and here 's the important part , one may raise very valid concerns as to where that threshold is going to be , who is going to set such a threshold ( and have the power to enforce it ) , or even if it 's too late for such a threshold . 
  those are issues that are very valid to talk about , and unless they are resolved there 's a real danger that the slippery slope actually ends up around the extreme end result !, 
  i think that 's what / u/exclamation11 wanted to say : a slippery slope is a slippery slope , and that is something to be watchful of . 
  it 's a trend in the wrong direction and that means it needs to be checked * at some * point , and that 's something worth discussing . 
  the situation has truly grown dire ... 
  i feel for you !, 
  really ? 
  i have always understood it as demagoguery simply being a fancier word for populism , that they are synonyms . 
  you 're correct that i did use populism as a synonym for demagoguery in my explanation just there , but i may be mistaken . 
  what would you say the difference is then ? 
  edit : from wikipedia 's page on demagogues , with my emphasis added . 
   ** demagogues appealed directly to the emotions of the poor and uninformed ** , pursuing power , telling ** lies to stir up hysteria , exploiting crises ** to intensify popular support for their calls to immediate action and increased authority , and accusing moderate opponents of weakness or disloyalty to the nation . 
  while many politicians in a democracy make occasional small sacrifices of truth , subtlety , or long-term concerns to maintain popular support , ** demagogues do these things relentlessly ** and without self-restraint . 
   what distinguishes a demagogue is * how * he or she gains or holds democratic power : by ** exciting the passions of the lower classes and less-educated people in a democracy ** toward rash or violent action , breaking established democratic institutions such as the rule of law . 
  james fenimore cooper in 1838 identified four fundamental characteristics of demagogues :  1 . 
  they fashion themselves as ** a man or woman of the common people ** , opposed to the elites . 
  their politics depends on a visceral connection with the people , which greatly exceeds ordinary political popularity . 
  they manipulate this connection , and the raging popularity it affords , for their own benefit and ambition . 
  they threaten or outright break established rules of conduct , institutions , and even the law . 
   the central feature of the practice of demagoguery is ** persuasion by means of passion , shutting down reasoned deliberation and consideration of alternatives . 
  demagogues `` pander to passion , prejudice , bigotry , and ignorance , rather than reason . 
  '' ** to me , this sounds like a good description of a populist , but perhaps it 's my view of what a populist is that is flawed ? 
  or perhaps all demagogues are automatically populists , but all populists are n't necessarily demogogues ? 
  in that case i 'd love to see an example of a non-demagogic populist , to see what they look like !, 
  i agree that creating hostiligy in that manner would make the populism * even worse * , but it 's not good to begin with either . 
  it 's bad by definition because populism means making sweet promises the voters without any intention to keep them . 
  empty words , generally designed to appeal to as many voters as possible wherever they stand politically ( * `` we need less crime !, 
  '' * ) , and no plan . 
  good thing that every single country in the western world is in that middle ground then . 
  it 's called social liberalism , and it 's in fact what everyone means when they say `` liberalism '' today , because * true * 100 % liberalism without a drop of socialism in it would be libertarianism instead . 
  social liberalism is the basis of both swedish and american politics , even though the former is signicantly to the left of the latter . 
   actually india was on it 's way to being a very progressive area , that 's got to be a firm no , there is no evidence that india was on its way to become `` very progressive '' before 1200 ad . 
  besides , what year are you even shooting for here ? 
  i 'm assuming around 1200 ad , the founding of the delhi sultanate , but muslim sultanates were created in northern india as early as 700 ad , and some parts of southern india was n't controlled by muslim rulers until 1500 ad . 
  when was this golden age of liberalism ? 
  you do n't have to answer , i already know you 're just talking out of your ass . 
   and then the muslim empire came and destroyed all that and consolidated the caste system in order to better control the population . 
  the caste system has existed since ancient times , and then changed under various rulers . 
  the mughal emperors did nothing to abolish it , and created new laws based on it , so that 's true , but it 's generally considered to have been truly solidified in the period when the british took over from the mughals . 
   * the caste system as it exists today is thought to be the result of developments during the collapse of the mughal era and the british colonial regime in india . 
  [ ... ] *  * the british raj furthered this development , making rigid caste organisation a central mechanism of administration . 
  between 1860 and 1920 , the british segregated indians by caste , granting administrative jobs and senior appointments only to the upper castes . 
  social unrest during the 1920s led to a change in this policy . 
  * you seem obsessed with assigning blame here , which i generally do n't , but you should know that the blame for the modern caste system is often laid on the british . 
  not that it matters for my argument , but it seems to interfere with your agenda to blame everything that has ever gone wrong in the world on islam . 
   and there are cultures even farther ( from the enlightenment ) than ( turkey 's for example , who 's half in europe ) like china 's and japan 's who i hope you would n't call backwards just because they 're different than yours . 
  i would definitely call many parts of china backwards , and i have done so several times so far . 
  as you 're not reading my comments before answering you confirm my suspicions that you 're not debating but just spewing propaganda . 
  china is notorious for their oppression of women , expecting them to behave traditionally and marry who their father chooses , and failure to comply damages the `` family honour . '', 
  sound familiar ? 
  it 's really only possible to escape this view in the large cities that are thankfully a bit more modern . 
  japan has of course had the same mentality historically ( as europe has had , historically ) but they have left it behind . 
  that 's not so strange , because the cultural distance between us and japan is in fact rather short . 
  as japan modernised as quickly as possible after ww2 they adopted european customs and ideals as well , japan 's culture changed immensely after ww2 . 
  again , geographical distance is not the same as cultural distance . 
  consider this my last comment , listening to your agenda/conspiracies bore me . 
  islam is to blame for a lot of problems , especially in the middle east , and i have agreed to that several times now .
