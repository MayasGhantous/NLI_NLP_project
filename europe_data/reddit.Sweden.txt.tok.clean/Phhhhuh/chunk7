  wikipedia 's [ article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arabs_in_sweden ) on `` arabs in sweden '' cited the real number as 159 ' 400 in october 2014 ( which you can see from the revision history ) , using [ this ] ( https://joshuaproject.net/countries/sw ) site as a source . 
  that amounts to 1.64 % of the population . 
  sure , that was in 2014 , and we 've gotten a number of syrian refugees since , but we clearly have n't received 840 ' 000 of them . 
  during 2015 , we received a grand total of about 160 ' 000 immigrants ( almost twice the normal number , which has been about 85 ' 000 a year for several years ) , but not all of them are arabs . 
  50 ' 000 of them are syrians , and 20 ' 000 are iraqis ( [ source ] ( http://www.migrationsverket.se/download/18.7c00d8e6143101d166d1aab/1451894593595/inkomna+ans\u00f6kningar+om+asyl+2015+-+applications+for+asylum+received+2015.pdf ) ) , so we have 230 ' 000 arabs that we know about . 
  let 's be really charitable and throw in 20 ' 000 in hiding ( though that 's a grossly inflated number ) , and it becomes 250 ' 000 arabs . 
  that 's about 2.5 % of the population ( or 1 in 40 ) , since we 're closing in on the 10 million people mark . 
  i love england < 3 for many reasons though . 
  could anyone translate the lyrics of the polish anthem ? 
  on the contrary , if it had been a case of islamistic terrorism and `` christian values under attack '' this sub would have been exploding with coverage . 
  now it 's just some loser who wants to get back together with his ex , there 's no politics in that . 
  that 's the sequel . 
  yes . 
  after invading ukraine . 
  that 's really not how liberties work . 
  with that logic , it should n't be scary that this imam is preaching that jews should be killed and children can be beaten . 
  i 'm neither a jew nor a child , so why should i care right ? 
  that 's not how it works . 
   this goes against our values and is probably a victory for the extremists . 
  yes !, 
  nothing probable about it , it 's a certainty . 
  agreed . 
  a party putting a motion forward is essentially making a suggestion , that 's far from something about to become written into law . 
  while it might be a good idea to get abu bilal ismail out of the country , i do n't agree with their choice of charge . 
  * `` preaching a view contrary to danish morals '' * is exactly the type of criminal charge that can be very easily abused , which is why we have free speech . 
  it 's strange too that they feel a need to criminalise certain opinions , because it 's already illegal to incite or agitate for violence , or to make preparations to commit a crime . 
  they say that this imam is calling for the killing of jews , which is a hate crime , and that 's also already illegal . 
  i ca n't imagine why you bring up martin luther , as he had nothing to do with the kind of progress and `` reformation '' i 'm talking about . 
  i was talking about the enlightenment , the philosophy of valuing reason , liberty , tolerance and constitutional rights over absolute monarchy or the church 's dogma . 
  or , as [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/age_of_enlightenment ) puts it  the enlightenment included a range of ideas centered on reason as the primary source of authority and legitimacy , and came to advance ideals such as liberty , progress , tolerance , fraternity , constitutional government and ending the abuses of the church and state . 
  in france , the central doctrines of the * lumi\u00e8res * were individual liberty and religious tolerance , in opposition to the principle of absolute monarchy and the fixed dogmas of the roman catholic church . 
  if you want to look for important figures here , you should forget luther and think about descartes , rousseau , voltaire , francis bacon , john locke and david hume . 
   science and the church are n't at odds they are as long as the church teaches that truth comes not from critical thinking , but from mindlessly accepting the preachings of an authority figure . 
  if the church drops this there would be no conflict , but then they would n't be a church . 
   the middle east kept pace up to and during the victorian age . . did they suddenly trip and fall back four centuries if you think that the countries of the middle east have ever been a bastion of tolerance you are sadly misinformed . 
  the only country in the middle east that can make such a claim is the ottoman empire , and they were simply tolerant of minorities because they pursued a decentralised approach to ruling their vast empire . 
  this policy was very unequally enforced by different sultans besides , and the empire became more and more authoritarian as its power waned . 
  the middle east did not `` keep up '' when it comes to civil rights or reason , though perhaps they kept up in prosperity . 
  whyever that would be important . 
   as you said , much of it is not to be taken literally , the sad fact is , that millions of muslim 's do to take the quran very seriously and take out actions in line to that . 
  i absolutely agree that muslims ( today ) are a bigger threat than christians . 
  but this is n't due to islam or christianity , or what the quran or the bible says , it 's due to different cultures in different parts of the world . 
  it 's due to secularisation and the lack of it . 
   the catholic church does not argue that all secular nations are heathens who should be destroyed , true . 
   and never has . 
  false . 
  good points . 
   the bible does n't incite violence , it does n't tell you that those of the faith are inferior , it simply tells you to save them . 
  through reform and good measures christianity as a whole does this through peaceful means and charitable acts , no matter what view you have on the different sects . 
  you clearly have n't read the bible then . 
  if you cherry-pick out all the `` good parts '' and leave all the bad stuff you 'll end up with something like you describe . 
  if you had actually read all of it you would have found tons of parts inciting violence . 
  and the problem with fundamentalists is that they do n't cherry-pick , they believe in all of it , even when it 's contradicting itself . 
  should you believe the bible when it tells you to love everyone , or when it says that you should * beat your own son to death with stones * if he does n't obey you ( [ deuteronomy 21:18 -21 ] ( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=deuteronomy+21%3a18-21&amp;amp;amp;amp;version=kjv ) ) ? 
  a fundamentalist is brainwashed enough that he does n't even see the contradiction . 
  or what should we do with unbelievers ? 
  [ 2 chronicles 15:12 -13 ] ( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+chronicles+15%3a12-13&amp;amp;amp;amp;version=kjv ) tells us this : ** 12 and they entered into a covenant to seek the lord god of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul ; ** ** 13 that whosoever would not seek the lord god of israel should be put to death , whether small or great , whether man or woman . 
  ** the great difference between the bible and the quran is n't that one is less violent than the other , it is that a larger percentage of muslims today take their book seriously . 
  incidentally , both muslims and christians describe their religion as a `` religion of love . '', 
  you would n't believe this lie from a muslim , why would you believe a lying christian ? 
   islam on the other hand is brewed out of hatred for others , and time and time again we see in the modern age they act out of that , forceful conversions and mass executions are seen all around the world today because of islam . 
  completely right , except for the * `` on the other hand '' * you put in there . 
  christianity comes from the same source , with the same values . 
  today we have been fairly successful at rooting out the more violent and fundamentalist christians from our society , so * today 's * christianity is n't as big a problem as islam , but a problem it remains . 
  and we would have been victims of just as much violence at the hands of christians if science and secularisation had n't won the battle in europe . 
   christian values have arguably brought the western world it 's moral footing and they have prospered alongside it , your views are allowed because of advances made in christian countries . 
  nice attempt at revisionism of history there , but it 's utter bullshit . 
  my views are allowed because of advances made * in spite of * christianity !, 
  it 's a direct consequence of the enlightenment , a process that incited a whole lot of secularism to take the teeth out of an oppressive religion . 
  this process started in northern europe , and we still see the traces of this today : northern european nations like scandinavia , the united kingdom and germany are generally ahead of the rest of the world in the race for secularisation and individual rights . 
  looking at southern europe , like italy and spain , you 'll find them fairly secularised today , but they still have n't caught up . 
  i 'd say italy are 25-50 years behind scandinavia . 
  looking at the colonies we see the same pattern , the us is less secular than england for instance , but they 'll get there at some point . 
   if you lived in an islamic country you might be under threat of arrest or worse for even saying such things . 
  yes . 
  and if i had lived right here a couple of centuries ago the same would have happened . 
   islam ca n't be trusted , and ca n't be reformed . 
  christianity could n't be reformed either , until it was . 
  islam ( or most of it ) will conform to our modern world at some point , just like the majority of christianity has given up their fundamentalism . 
  islam is simply a number of centuries ( approximately four ) behind . 
  of course , now that we have internet and globalisation we may hope for faster progress . 
  it will go even faster if we stop defending religion . 
  i clearly overestimated the ratio of christians-to-atheists in here when i wrote that . 
  one can make a good argument that the quran ( and the bible too ) should be banned for inciting violence , along with mein kampf and similar books . 
  but i 'm of the opinion that it probably was for the best that mein kampf 's copyright expired when it did , giving the opportunity to print versions annotated by serious historians , pointing out errors . 
  this means that it can be used to educate . 
  banning * books * in themself is probably not the answer , it only leads to people becoming more interested in getting their hands on the book , the key is to ban people teaching a violent book 's content as truth . 
  if someone stands with a copy of mein kampf in his hand , preaching how jews are destroying society , he should be arrested . 
  and if someone stands in a mosque preaching from the quran , or in a church preaching from the bible , they should be arrested as well . 
  idiotic lefties ? 
  the morons ( neo-conservatives and fascists ) who keep saying that we should start revoking citizenships are * the same people * who keep saying that our politicians take away our freedoms and ca n't be trusted . 
  with no self-awareness at all . 
   not about actual refugees . 
  most hating in this thread seems to be aimed at somalis . 
  i respectfully disagree . 
  in my experience , it 's not tolerated to give left-wing extremists screen time either , people dismiss that just as fast . 
  the agenda has become pretty strong here . 
  most of those that does n't subscribe to the ideology has moved from the sub . 
  i thought it said ireland beat china and india in population growth . 
  as * you * can see for yourself , it does n't vary * that * wildly .
