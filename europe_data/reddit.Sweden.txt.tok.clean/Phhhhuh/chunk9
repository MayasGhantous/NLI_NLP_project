  obviously , if someone is delusional their opinion would n't count as much as a sane person 's , but people with another sexual identity than heterosexuality are n't in fact delusional . 
   harassing being disagreeing , in this case at least . 
  nope . 
  i still do n't consider someone an asshole for disagreeing , only for trying to change someone into something they 're not . 
  the type of harassment i 'm talking about is walking up to a transperson and saying * `` you are fucked in the head , i 'm right about you and you are n't . 
  '' * also known as not accepting someone 's identity . 
  keeping those opinions to yourself would not constitute harassment , and it would n't make someone an asshole . 
  it feels like we might have had this discussion before ? 
  maybe you did n't read my reply last time ? 
   au contraire , you liar . 
  the comments are there for all to see so i do n't know what good it 'll do you to deny it , but i 'll show it to you again if you need it . 
  yes , well , you misunderstood me the first time and then you 've just kept assuming that your original interpretation was correct . 
  i have repeatedly explained that you did n't understand what i meant , but i 'm beginning to see that explanations does n't help , since you clearly are n't even reading my posts . 
   so because your standpoint is weak it means i 'm arguing a straw man ? 
  you are arguing a straw man because you , even after several explanations , keep aiming your replies at your original faulty interpretation of what i said . 
  this is arguing against a misrepresentation of my view , hence a straw man . 
   but he did n't keep it to myself , he shared his opinion here in this very thread so you admit to calling him an asshole . 
  ... at this point this starts to feel like a farce . 
  i get it . 
  you do n't read what i 'm writing . 
  whatever . 
   mentally ill people commit more suicide in general . 
  sounds like an appeal to emotions . 
  it 's an appeal to people to stop behaving maliciously towards one another . 
  sexual identities other than heterosexuality are n't mental illnesses . 
  that belief is , in your own words , easily disproved . 
  delusional patients , or patients with other mental illnesses , have something wrong with them , which can be fixed in some cases . 
  sexualities ca n't be `` cured '' because there 's nothing to cure . 
  nothing is wrong with them , and there 's ample evidence that so-called `` conversion therapy '' does n't work . 
  hence why it 's frowned upon by all major medical organisations . 
  i wrote a bit more on that in [ a reply ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/49i88j/danish_girl_accused_of_plotting_attack_against/d0sff39 ) to another guy , with a few sources , if you 're interested . 
  though as i said , it 's pretty wide-spread knowledge at this point , should n't be too hard to find sources . 
  the lack of well-being , the suicides , et c. among people with other sexual identities are n't due to faulty signalling in their brains ( as with the serotonin pathway in depressed or bipolar patients ) , it 's simply a direct cause of people attacking them and questioning them their entire lives . 
  that 's why i brought up the suicide statistic , to show the damage your way of thinking actually does . 
  thanks for the support , 
   `` a woman trapped in a man 's body '' is a statement that is not based in reality . 
  there is no soul , you are your body and it is that simple . 
  there is no soul . 
  but there is a brain , and in it we have self-awareness and identity . 
  your identity is a lot of things , one of them is sexuality , i hope you agree with me so far . 
   for you to suggest the entire rest of the body and dna are off but the person 's feelings are right is lunacy . 
  this amounts to saying schizophrenics do n't have delusions , they 're just stuck in the wrong reality . 
  it does n't look like lunacy to me . 
  the difference between sexuality and schizophrenia is that one thing is a disease ( that can be ~ ~ cured ~ ~ treated * edit : i was careless in my wording * ) , and the other is not . 
  there 's nothing wrong with someone who is n't heterosexual , and there 's nothing to cure . 
  there 's an abundance of scientific evidence for this , i gave you some links in [ the other post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/49i88j/danish_girl_accused_of_plotting_attack_against/d0sff39 ) . 
   before you counter with some nonsense about `` the medical community '' i 'll remind you that 1 ) ` transgender ' people make them money i 'll absolutely bring up the medical community . 
  foremost because i 'm a proud member of it . 
  and i decided to become a doctor in order to help people , not primarily in order to make money ( i know , i know , it must be hard for you to understand that people can be nice to each other ) . 
  concerning money , transpeople are one of the groups that cost us a lot of money , and take a lot of our resources . 
  that 's right , they cost money , they are n't a cash cow . 
  with [ 41 % of transgenders attempting suicide ] ( http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/afsp-williams-suicide-report-final.pdf ) at least once , their mental well-being actually takes a toll on society as a whole . 
  if they could all be made to feel good and at home in their bodies , we 'd win a lot . 
  then again , since you refer to the medical community as `` nonsense , '' i doubt we 'll be able to have a reasonable discussion . 
   and 2 ) less than 5 centuries ago doctors were in agreement that the only way to cure mental illness was to drill holes in people 's skull . 
  medicine have been evidence-based ( scientific ) for less than a century , and there was a long transition period as well ( when a lot of old junk lived on because people assumed it was right , when it had n't actually proven itself ) . 
  what was known as `` medicine '' five centuries ago have no relation to today 's medicine , it 's two completely different fields . 
  you ca n't look at old medicine and use that as an argument that medicine today is bad . 
  but you probably do n't really believe that anyway , otherwise you 'd avoid the hospital when you 're sick . 
  if your kid decides he wants to jump off a roof i 'd stop him too . 
  however , you ca n't `` stop '' a transwoman from thinking of herself as a woman , even if she is considered by many to be a man . 
  what you 're talking about is called conversion therapy , and it does n't work . 
  every major medical organisation in the world ( such as who or american psychiatric association ) agree that sexual identity ca n't be changed , and trying to do it is generally only more harmful . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/conversion_therapy http://www.nclrights.org/bornperfect-the-facts-about-conversion-therapy/ http://www.hrc.org/resources/the-lies-and-dangers-of-reparative-therapy http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/reparative_therapy  you do n't want to help these people that are suffering from identity crises and delusions , you want to ignore them so you can keep feeling good about yourself . 
  i do n't want to ignore them , that 's what you want . 
  you want to pretend like people ca n't be different from you . 
  i want to help them live the lives they want to , and help them feel good about themselves . 
  and if i can make people healthier , you 're damn right that i 'll feel good about myself . 
   not all opinions are equal , no matter how much you would like to think so  just because there are two conflicting statements does not give equal gredance to both . 
  yes , this is the part we agree on !, 
  if you argue with a transperson about what sex that person really is , one of you would obviously be right and one of you would be wrong . 
  just as if you and i disagreed on where i live , or where i work . 
  hint : the one making claims about * themself * is the one whose opinion counts . 
   i guess people in the past should not have questioned the church or old thinking . 
  just kept their thoughts to themselves and i 'm sure we would be better off . 
  you really like drawing strange conclusions from what i 've written , do n't you ? 
  i do n't know how you think this has anything to do with questioning doctrines , it 's not remotely related . 
  i said that you should n't harass people -- if you think they 're `` weird , '' it 's nicer to keep it to yourself . 
  it 's politeness , it 's common decency . 
   instead of calling the guy an asshole for not accepting your point of view why not argue for it ? 
  surely if you 're right you would have a valid reason for thinking so . 
  i still have n't called him an asshole for disagreeing with me , so you might stop bringing it up . 
  reread my post perhaps ? 
  it looks like reading comprehension is a bit of an issue for you , unless you 're just misrepresenting what i 'm saying on purpose , because you prefer arguing with a [ straw man ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/straw_man ) . 
  i did say that one would be an asshole to try to convince someone else that their identity is n't valid . 
  and one would not be an asshole if one kept those views to oneself , to make a nod back to what i said above . 
  in what other manner should i argue for my views ? 
  should i say that transsexuals are among those groups that are [ most likely to committ suicide ] ( http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/afsp-williams-suicide-report-final.pdf ) , as a result of not being accepted by society ? 
  what do you want here ? 
  i have tried to explain the intention of my posts , i hope you are satisfied . 
  olaf is mainly a danish and norwegian name , 
  that was n't at all what i said though . 
  you can however be a prick by telling others that your opinion of them is worth more than their own . 
  if someone considers themself a woman , and you harass them by insisting that they 're a man , you 'd be an asshole . 
  if you keep your opinions to yourself you can think whatever you damn well please , i do n't take offence to disagreements , only actions . 
  it 's not much of a whoosh . 
  i understood what he meant , i just think it was a silly generalisation . 
  yeah , maybe . 
  i guess i 'll take that as a compliment , 
  i have to disagree .
