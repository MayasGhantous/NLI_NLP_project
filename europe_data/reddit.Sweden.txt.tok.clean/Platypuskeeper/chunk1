in sweden , 85 % in the last national elections ( local , regional and parliament are all voted on at the same time , so the turnout is essentially the same ) . 
  in these eu parliament elections it was 50 % , which is higher than last time , but it 's always far lower than the ` real ' elections . 
  the vote distribution is also very different ; and you 're seeing that with the uk and other countries as well . 
  people do n't care as much and are more prepared to take a chance on new and populist parties . 
  must have thought he was voting [ in sweden ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/donald_duck_party ) , where those count . 
  that 's such total bullshit . 
  first : they were n't polling as the fifth-largest party at all , [ either back in january or more recently ] ( http://sverigesradio.se/sida/gruppsida.aspx?programid=4657&amp;grupp=12794&amp;artikel=5871293 ) . 
  second : the libertarian falkvinge is complaining his party is not getting more attention from etc , a radical-left newspaper - _ seriously ? _ they did n't feature the feminist initiative party either , and at least they 'd have more reason to complain , being nothing if not on the left . 
  there 's no ` stonewalling ' . 
  in 2004 , the newly-formed june list party got a lot of attention , won three seats , and then dropped off the radar in the next election . 
  not because of a media conspiracy but simply because the novelty was gone . 
  the party itself was not news anymore . 
  in that election the pirate party had the spotlight and got voted in . 
  then _ their _ novelty wore off , as plenty of people predicted it would . 
  this year , the feminist initiative people got voted in . 
  there 's no media ` stonewalling ' of small , non-traditional parties . 
  it 's silly to even try to claim that when four new parties won their first eu parliament seats in the last three elections . 
  by the very statistics there the feminists were being just as ` stonewalled ' if that was the case , but they still won a seat . 
  it 's just that the voters are fickle and trendy because they just do n't care that much about the eu elections . 
  blaming the media for conspiring against you just because you do n't get the same amount of attention you used to is immature . 
  all these small parties are playing by the same rules , and the sweden democrats are easily more disliked than the pirate party . 
  if all falkvinge can do is blame the media for what 's just being bad at politics , then they do n't deserve attention either . 
  and what do you think of when i say `` the june list '' ? 
  probably nothing . 
  they 're a swedish euroskeptic party that came out of nowhere , won 3 seats in the european pariament ( more than the pp did ) , and then dropped off the radar in the next election where the pp got voted in . 
  this year the pp lost their seat and the new feminist initiative party gained their first seat ever . 
  see a trend ? 
  they 're very disproportionately represented on reddit ( and sweden is as well ) , but the pirate party is n't really a significant force in swedish politics ; they only won that one mep seat in the context of the swedish electorate being extremely fickle when it comes to the eu elections . 
  the german party is more successful by comparison . 
  the priest spoke some passable swedish . 
  he was n't that much fun though . 
  in swedish there 's the double pun : `` det \u00e4r inte l\u00e4tt att vara est , men ballt '' translated : `` it 's not ( easy/latvian ) to be estonian , but it 's ( awesome/baltic ) '' . 
  it 's a play on the swedish saying `` stor i orden , liten p\u00e5 jorden '' , so no , it 's intended to be sardonic . 
  true story : i speak no finnish beyond a few basic phrases , so when i once had to sit through a few hours-long wedding banquet in finland i did nothing but pretend to listen while nodding and occasionally saying ` kyll\u00e4 . ', 
  afterwards i was told i 'd made a favorable impression !, 
  anyone can speak finnish : you just shut the hell up . 
  expecting foreigners to understand it is a bit much , no ? 
  work began on the chimney in recent days ? 
  they [ finished two weeks ago ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/chernobyl/comments/1qpy0s/gallery_of_the_chimney_dismantling/ ) . 
  bbc 's not quite up to date here . 
  it 's not ( necessarily ) illegal in sweden either . 
  to count as theft ( st\u00f6ld ) , they have to suffer some actual economic damage , and above a certain amount too . 
  which is n't really the case here . 
  the person who threw the thing out is n't losing any money , and the garbage collectors are probably getting paid the same regardless of whether that pot is in there . 
  but you ca n't take stuff out of them if they 're in some private area , and naturally not break into them and so on . 
  but what halonen 's doing here would not be illegal . 
  / r/dumpsterdiving, 
  just for the record though , `` st\u00e4ngda '' does look like `` st\u00e6ngede '' , which is the related danish word . 
  it 's just uncommon and so not the proper translation . 
  ( and in reverse , the relative of danish `` lukket '' in swedish is `` lyckt '' and is relatively uncommon there ), 
  you guys just want to get a chance to put magic spells on people 's hats again . 
  that 's not true . 
  germany , and many other countries , have extradition treaties that do not _ obligate _ them to extradite their own citizens . 
  which does _ not _ mean that they do n't do it , just that it 's at the discretion of the government whether they do so or not . 
  if a german murders someone in the usa and goes home , and the us demands him back and shows evidence , he 's probably going to be sent back . 
   basicly the word in most scandinavian languages comes from the old-norse language berg no , ` borg ' was ` borg ' in old norse and could mean both a fortification or fortified city already then . 
  ( e.g. 
  a viking age name for jersualem was ` jorsalaborg ' ) the common origin to ` berg ' is significantly farther removed in time , way back around proto-germanic . 
  which is also why ` burgh ' , ` borough ' and such cognate city-related names exist in other germanic languages .

  not quite as fancy , but if you 're a shopping norwegian or need an aluminum foundry , there are worse places to be . 
  yeah , amsterdam is the official capital as defined by the dutch , even though the hague is where the government and monarch resides on a day-to-day basis . 
  ( which is how most define what the capital is ), 
  expensive ? 
  it depends on how much you use of course , but it 's cheaper than smoking in terms of the average amount . 
  or in terms of nicotine for your money . 
  i recently made a big grin when looking at a swedish 19th century book of woodworking patterns ( back when _ snickargl\u00e4dje _ was all the rage ) . 
  it suggested the projects in it would be good work for the idle farm workers during the long winter evenings that `` might otherwise be used for a lot of unnecessary talk . '', 
  most nordic thing ever , and i like it . 
  not that people should n't be allowed to be social , but just the set of values that respects _ doing _ stuff over idle talk . 
  i do n't really understand why they give such a fuck . 
  they should really be complaing that english does n't have a good term that 's equivalent to the ones we actually use ( _ norden _ et al ) , except for the rather cumbersome ` nordic countries ' . 
  besides , a sizable chunk of finland is on the scandinavian peninsula and none of denmark is . . :p ( otoh the word does come from the same source as scania , which is basically danish ), 
  sucks for them . 
  but you know , when they shut down a subway line for maintenance here or in any other _ single city _ , and commuters have to take half an hour longer to get to work , you do n't see the eu commission getting involved . 
  the scale of this inconvenience is not any larger . 
   brussels is studying the legality of the actions , including new swedish measures requiring travellers between denmark and sweden to show their id cards for the first time since the late 1950s , when a nordic agreement on passport-free travel came into force . 
  why do the always have to make stuff up to over-dramatize ? 
  citizens and residents of nordic countries can visit other nordic countries without a passport and still can . 
  in fact , i 'm flying from finland back to sweden later tonight without a passport !, 
  but you have ** always ** been required ( in principle ) to be able to show that you are a citizen/resident , and schengen is no different there . 
  there have been checks all along since the 1950s , just not all the time and not at every border crossing , and schengen is no different . 
  the only difference is that they 're now checking _ everybody _ . 
  which schengen rules also allow for , temporarily . 
  well the rules are n't permanent and have n't even been in force 100 hours yet . 
  the eu commission should stfu and concentrate on breaking the deadlock on what to do about this crisis instead . 
  ** update : ** and i 'm back in sweden . 
  guess what ? 
  absolutely nothing was different from last time i flew the same route . 
  i showed id on check-in , and that was it . 
  ( probably would n't even have to do that much if the airport had automated check-in ) no ` real ' passport or id checks , which presumably applied to everyone else arriving at the inside-schengen part of terminal 5 , arlanda . 
  reports of the death of the schengen treaty have been greatly exaggerated . 
  not to mention that the neighbor in question has a conscript army themselves ... 
  so at worst you 'd think it 'd cancel out . 
  unless you had an exemption , all adult males 18-47 were eligible for military conscription . 
  ( and 15-65 for civil duties ) since mandatory service was only abolished in 2009 , and close to everybody had to do national service during the cold war . 
  so a majority of older men have served , and that 's also the group that 's most positive . 
  your insinuation that only people who ca n't / wo n't serve want this is false . 
  american whiskey is also whiskey .
