  although i suppose the less said about _ that _ stuff the better . 
  sounds like a north rhine-westphalian plan to get themselves a coastline . 
  the american one should be spelled ` taffey ' . 
  that way it 'd be consistent with whiskey/whisky . 
  _ i bless the rains down in laaaatviaaaa ... _ yeah , i guess that works . 
  according to that map , i think the biggest province is `` doggerland '' which seems to imply the dutch will be turning the dogger bank into a polder . 
  manchester-upon-tyne !, 
  a polish friend told me that with the same monotone for everyone , you often ca n't even tell which character is talking if it 's offscreen . 
  major news outlets like new york times , guardian and others had no problems publishing the snowden leaks , and they 've been publishing that kind of stuff since before assange was even born . 
  wikileaks has n't released shit of significance that the ` mainstream media ' would n't , unless you count the doxxing of thousands of completely innocent third-parties by refusing to redact their personal info . 
  and unlike wikileaks , media does n't use that ifnormation to try to settle personal scores like assange does , nor are they openly receiving money from the kremlin 's tv channel like assange did , or buddying with ecuador - both of which are countries with _ far _ , _ far _ worse records on freedom of the press and government transparency than the us has . 
  but since wikileaks is assange 's personal power toy and ** not ** in fact about furthering honesty and transparency in government , that fact does n't matter to him or the useful idiots who excuse this bullshit . 
  and speaking of transparency , wikileaks also has _ zero _ transparency into how they 're actually organized and how donations are used . 
  assange is plainly guilty of all the things accuses media of , and yet his accusations are untrue or at best half-truths . 
  the nyt is not , in fact , run by the cia . 
  but it _ is _ a fact assange worked with rt , for instance . 
  even then it 's still mostly clickbait uk tabloid stories rather than the quality outlets like say the economist . 
  you rarely ever see the non-uk european news sources that do exist in english , like [ dw ] ( http://www.dw.com ) or the english-edition of [ monde diplomatique ] ( http://mondediplo.com/ ) ,, 
  conscripting 4k a year , they wo n't _ need _ to choose anyone who does n't want to . 
  hell , they conscripted 25k , about half , of the people my age and i did n't know anyone who was dead-set against it that had to do it . 
  [ and according to dn ] ( http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/okand-bildt-pa-fox-news/ ) , he 's a convicted criminal as well . 
  yeah , the former think the the problem is that middle east did n't have the enlightenment , the latter think the problem is that france _ did . _, 
  the part west of the bosporus is geographically europe . 
  this is n't that part though . 
  surpluses are sane , and what you should have , when the economy is going fine . 
  surpluses in good times should pay for deficits in bad times , so you can keep social services and help stimulate the economy . 
  run deficits in good times and you risk ending up in a negative spiral of a shrinking economy and cutbacks/austerity when things go bad . 
  guess that 's why you guys are buying up worthless marshland here in sweden . 
  as i told a colleague of mine the other day though , to the dutchman it 's not a swamp : it 's a project !, 
  but also because of space in general - you need it , we 've got it . 
  for a quarter-million euros , you can have your own square kilometer to sit and be asocial on . 
   calling us holland `` holland '' is the swedish name for the netherlands . 
  just as dutch `` zweden '' refers to the kingdom of the swedes , goths and wends . 
  sweden proper being only [ svealand ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/svealand ) . 
  what do i care what nato does ? 
  albert ii , it seems . 
  apparently foreign heads of state need to ask permission before entering swedish airspace if they have n't been invited , even if they 're just passing through . 
  and monaco did n't . 
  ( i 'm guessing it 's a similar story for the gulf states there too ), 
  well , they were strategically important at the time of the \u00c5land treaty . 
  they 're not as important now when fixed coastal fortifications are generally considered obsolete . 
  [ i doubt croatia 's mosquito problem is worse than this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4xcwopo4q8 ) . 
  correct . 
  \u00c5land is a demilitarized zone . 
  [ sweden had more than 35 in just the last 3-4 years ] ( http://imgur.com/a/ndftd ) ( wtf monaco ?! ), 
  worse though is russia using armed fighter jets to harass our unarmed spy planes over international airspace . 
  [ one incident a few years ago ] ( https://www.svtstatic.se/image-cms/svtse/1498037650/svts/article14198180.svt/alternates/extralarge/sdlszf7df0e-nh-1-jpg ) and [ one from earlier this year ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/thgjmt3p9ea/hq720.jpg ) . 
  anyway . 
  i may be a swede but i still know enough finnish to know we do n't need to apologize for any meripelastushelikopterit . 
   it 's impressive for europe but for the really major countries it 's pretty terrible . 
  major countries has nothing to do with it . 
  emerging economies grow faster than mature ones , and china is less developed than western europe . 
   us is calling their 2.6 % growth this quarter `` modest '' you do n't understand the numbers here . 
  the us grew 2.6 % in this quarter compared to the same quarter the year earlier . 
  the swedish gdp grew 1.7 % _ during the second quarter alone _ . 
  the growth compared to the same quarter during the last year was over 4 % . 
  the us has not had gdp growth above 4 % since the 90 's . 
  you 're just completely wrong here . 
   which kind of does n't ` work ' because veps were never under swedish dominance and would and still use russian calendar yet they call it ` hay month ' as well . 
  political control does n't matter , many words in finnish were borrowed from norse and even proto-norse , centuries before finland became part of sweden . 
  ( also there was norse influence eastwards on slavic languages too , so why not veps ? ), 
  anyway . 
  among the month names that are the same in swedish and finnish , you also have _ joulukuu/julm \u00e5nad _ - yule month . 
  the obvious explanation for why finnish would have a month named after a germanic custom is that they borrowed it from a germanic language . 
  for the record , dogsleds are _ not _ part of traditional swedish or sami culture . 
  they 're only around up north because tourists expect them , because we 're apparently inuits . 
  i 'm not really a fan of it . 
  many finnish month names , including _ hein\u00e4kuu _ ( hay month ) for july are the same ( and likely derive from ) the norse calendar names . 
  the older name for july in swedish/norwegian is _ h\u00f6m\u00e5nad / h\u00f8ym\u00e5ned _ ( hay month ) and was in common use among the peasantry well into the 19th century before the latin ( - derived ) name educated people had been using came to dominate . 
  that 's bullshit . 
  first off , in every situation where he bet against a currency he was only a tiny fraction of the total amount of investors doing so . 
  second , his largest currency bets were against the pound and swedish krona in the early 90 's . 
  i was there in sweden and he did n't ` destabilize the country ' , neither was england on its way to collapse . 
  in both cases , both countries governments set artificial pegs on their exchange rates which they could n't defend . 
  it 's literally as if the government would say that bakers have to sell their bread at $ 100 a loaf , and then blaming one specific guy who started making money off importing cheap foreign bread for the failure of that scheme . 
  the failure is creating a situation with an artificial valuation that was wrong - not the market forces that changed it , much less one specific investor . 
  the there 's a broad political consensus here in sweden , including the prime minister and finance ministers of that era , that the fixed-exchange-rate policy was a huge mistake . 
  they do n't blame soros . 
  nobody blames soros in economic circles . 
  the people claiming soros did some huge horrible thing are mainly people who do n't understand economics and want to find fault with soros for other reasons . 
  because it 's simply counter to the facts to pretend he was the only one making currency bets or stood for most of the betting , and it 's naive to think markets are just going to sit around and not make money when an asset is undervalued or overvalued . 
  wow that second one is really creating a lot of wind . 
  even crazier thing is that for the last year of his life after the accident they decided to let him continue to believe he was in power even though he 'd been unseated . 
  a real-world `` goodbye lenin ! '', 
  situation . 
  in sweden we had upwards of 90 % literacy rate even in the 18th century . 
  by law the church mandated that people could read ( if nothing else ) the bible and luther 's small catechism , and would visit households and test everybody annually . 
  proficiency in _ writing _ was much lower though . 
  the church had no interest in people learning that . 
  surely `` quentaqu\u00ed '' or something . 
  ca n't have ` k 's messing up your french . 
  i wonder why they went with latin letters for ` pizza ' when ` planeta ' is in cyrillic . 
  otoh the way they usually transliterate that word is even weirder : '' \u041f\u0438\u0446\u0446\u0430 '' - pitstsa , wtf ? 
  in our swedish high school , they unromantically described it as more or less `` that time we used religion as a pretense to go loot the continent . '', 
  we picked up many of our national treasures in prague 's mal\u00e1 strana in 1648 . 
  it 's kind of insensitive to say but it was a huge success from the swedish pov . 
  [ 10 years after the war ] ( http://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.timetoast.com/public/uploads/photos/2187561/sk%c3%a4rmavbild_2012-02-07_kl._13.42.46.png?1473974173 ) sweden was at its greatest extent . 
  sooo close to the eternal goal of turning the baltic into an inlet of sweden ... oh well . 
  do n't give him ideas . 
  swedes already hold their language in far too low esteem .
