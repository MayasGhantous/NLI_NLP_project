  well we 'd be more than happy with a pride festival on victory day . 
  nice way to promote acceptance and love imo . 
  would piss of the russians but who cares at this point . . 
  english *, 
  who can tell these days with all those dancing negroes on tanks and legions of nato !, 
  not us !, 
  apparently nemtsov defended the free speech . 
  kadyrov having somewhat opposite views disagreed . 
  had his bodyguard kill nemtsov . 
  that 's the theory at least . 
  280 % now . 
  they 're going to salvate the shit out of you . 
  construct wonder : fehrmarn tunnel +20 % oversea invasion movement speed . 
  but they sanctioned european cheese and other food stuff ? 
  yup . 
  my religion class was actually very interesting . 
  we got to learn about the 5 world religions , the myths that were ground for traditions and celebrations . 
  and some modern day problematisation of old school traditions in modern society . 
  for example the ramadan fast and problems with functioning in a work environment ( imagine to your surgeon or bus driver not eating the whole day ) or the caste system of hinduism . 
  would study again . 
  well i would n't claim myself as historically literate but i am of ukrainian birth . 
  what is now west ukraine has been a contested territoriy and swapped hands many times . 
  lviv changed hands as late as ~ 1945 ish . 
  so there were some national tentions between minorities on both sides . 
  not excusing banderas actions in any way . 
  i think he was a disgraceful person . 
  never heard of it . 
  eu should call out their citizens on being greedy cunts who buy the cheapest possible clothing that gets ruined once you wash it anyway . 
   but for its time it was even the `` modern '' technology of administration serfdom was dropped as a practice in the nordics like almost 1000 years before russia and was abolished at least 500 years before it was abolished in russia . 
  remember , the nordics were pretty much the backwater of europe back then ... `` modern '' . 
  i guess you think walking around like [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/antoine-fran%c3%a7ois_callet_-_louis_xvi%2c_roi_de_france_et_de_navarre_%281754-1793%29%2c_rev%c3%aatu_du_grand_costume_royal_en_1779_-_google_art_project.jpg ) is modern too ? 
   and the last but not least , serfdom is n't slavery . 
  it is actually an european idea that was borrowed by catherine the great from her homeland germany . 
  so again , not russias fault , eventhough it totally is . 
  serfdom is n't slavery in what way exactly ... 
  i was n't the one making any claims which piece of land belongs where ? 
  you on the other hand were certain that a majority decides to whom who belongs . 
  interestingly enough , the majority of donbass region are * not * russians . 
  so donbass is ukraine according to your logic . 
  crimea , well , why not ask crimeans themselves , in internationally recognized elections not held under gunpoint ? 
  you know , like the one in scotland . 
  it was so funny watching the russian media supporting scottish independence , as if it would make crimean annexation any more legitimate ... 
  that is all very interesting an all , but why is all that relevant ( if it were relevant , or even historically correct , but lets pretend for a second that it is ) ? 
  your initial comment says  founded by russians , inhabited by russians , speaks russian , feel russian and is a historical part of russia , then it 's russia . 
  which is according to your later comment , is simply not true ? 
  because apparently there ** were ** people living there , having their own civilization before russia annexed it ? 
  and the same `` slavery '' argument which you are using to diminish the tatar civilization can be made with the glorious russian serfdom system . 
  if you were annexed , you were a surf . 
  crimea was annexed for the first time by russian empire in 1783 , serfdom was abolished much later . 
   tatars are a minority , they ca n't decide for the majority . 
  interesting line of thought . 
  never crossed my mind . 
  lets apply the same logic to donbass then , / u/9a4172 , shall we ? 
   [ according to the 2001 census , ethnic ukrainians form 58 % of the population of luhansk oblast and 56.9 % of donetsk oblast . 
  ethnic russians form the largest minority , accounting for 39 % and 38.2 % of the two oblasts respectively . 
  [ 36 ] ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/donbass#demographics_and_politics ), 
   founded by russians , inhabited by russians , speaks russian , feel russian and is a historical part of russia , then it 's russia let 's ask the tatar population now , shall we ? 
  i 'm sorry , not that into tennis , care to elaborate ? 
  good time to invest now !, 
  they 'll only get more pricey when everyone wants them !, 
  some of us are more equal than others even !, 
  i 'd say it 's more popular than smoking , yes . 
  none of the `` iconic '' swedish brands pay corp tax in sweden . . ikea , volvo etc. 
  extra funny considering volvo cars has a full on pr offensive where they 're pushing it that they 're from sweden . 
  if we had a 5 % corp tax there are still places with lower tax and where the companies would register . 
  do you think a major company 's board will think `` oooh we can increase our profit by 5 % but we 're not gon na bother '' ? 
  the only way we could compete with tax havens is by having zero corporate tax . 
  it 's a race to the bottom and i 'm not buying that . 
   why ca n't you just be happy these problems are being paid attention ? 
  because when mr. ek raises these questions he has an agenda . 
  also because he 's a hypocrite . 
  and you are welcome to kindly fuck off with the personal insults . 
  have a good day . 
   they did n't move it to luxembourg , i 'm pretty sure it was always there but why ? 
  is his mom from there ? 
  his dog ? 
  why not poland , or any other country ? 
  luxembourg is not an arbitrary choice if you think that . . 
  so when he 's bitching about lack of education in programming , i 'm sure he can convince his talent from spotify to hold seminars and workshops for free for kids . 
  you know , leading by example and all that . 
   hey are warning the government that the housing crisis and regressive tax system negatively affects it companies in europe wow , i need an it nerd to tell me about the housing market . 
  what 's next ? 
  a gardener telling me which car to buy ? 
  on a more serious note : yes we all knew that the housing market is fucked up . 
  but i am not sure he 's the person with the right competence to speak on these matters . 
  so why move it to luxembourg in the first place then ? 
  if they feel like they want more programming teaching in schools and universities they are free contribute . 
  i simply do n't understand the whining from mr. ek et . 
  he of all guys should value the swedish school system since he 's a drop-out himself . 
  in the states this would 've set him back a few hundred sek to start with . . before he could dream of funding any company . 
  that 's because of your housing market and cuz not enough it experts and also because taxes . . 
  you do n't pay taxes on loss . 
  so what 's the point in moving to luxembourg ? 
  sure they might not make a profit , but expanding ( and thus increasing market value of your shares ) is not to be neglected . . 
  the points made by the spotify team may be valid . 
  it is however a bit hard to take them seriously since spotify operates from taxhavens like luxembourg . 
  if a swedish company that actually pays tax here and contributes to the education etc via the tax bill would say the same , it 'd be much easier to take it seriously . 
  spotify is not the biggest it employer in sweden . 
  those few hundred people will easily find jobs on one of the world 's hottest it markets that is stockholm . 
  got any reading recommendations in english ?
