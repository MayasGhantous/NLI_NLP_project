  it makes it harder to avoid prosecution for dissident views . 
  i was offended . 
   in the end putin knows that most russians wo n't bother fighting or revolting and will just suffer for a few more years until ( hopefully ) the price of oil somehow increases again . 
  nice progressive economic policy from chess grandmaster putin . 
  i wo n't even bother to answer the rest of the uninformed bullshit . . 
  consult a map . 
   danishevsky was going to market the book in the `` 18 + '' category , so that on the face of it , the book would not violate the ban . 
  but the face of it has little to do with actual law enforcement , so his lawyer ( who declined to speak to me ) was adamant : the very subject of the book , lgbt teenagers , had no right to exist under russian law . 
  this really is heartbreaking . 
  if it can be figured out how the language barriers are to be overcome , i smell a business opportunity for the romanian prosecutors . 
  would be cool with a anti-corruption task force that travels through eu and solves crimes . 
  infinite possibilities to make this into cool films too . 
  because stronk men only die for glorious motherland and do n't do homosex . 
  it really makes little sense to refer to a country by its full formal name . 
  would you say people 's republic of china each time ? 
  nobody says united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland when speaking about uk either . 
  my point being it would really be convenient to have a single word for czech republic or an abbreviation like `` uk '' . . 
  i do n't think cr is a commonly known abbreviation for czech republic . 
  how do you guys pronounce your country in czech ? 
  because `` czech republic '' * is * somewhat inconvenient . 
  that 's like asking sweden to be called `` kingdom of sweden '' in each sentence . 
  in swedish , it 's called tjeckien ( checkien is how you would pronounce it ) . 
  i want to remind you that i did not do any strawmen . 
  i just question your blatant ad hominem . 
  this is the 3rd time as you simply dismissed my opinion due to my heritage . 
  that used to be popular in germany in the 30ies too . 
  nice !, 
  really ? 
  instead of ad hominem you * could * critique his work . 
  why not do that ? 
  he 's open with his sources etc. 
  then at very least further sanctions ( and loss of foreign capital ) will severely limit russian abilities to act aggressively . 
  that alone is reason enough to sanction the current russian regime . 
   they all will be fine and can simply blame the sanctions on the us and its puppets in the eu . 
  they already do . 
  the russian government has put up such a large amount of shit in the news that the average ivan is confused about who sanctioned who and with what . 
  many russians believe the food prices increased because the eu banned food exports . . 
   they did n't intend to shoot down an airliner . 
  it does n't really matter does it ? 
  since they 're avoiding any responsibility for it anyway . 
  in 5 years russia will react thusly http://i.imgur.com/kdj7zer.png and they will keep telling us how strong they are that they could avoid any responsibility . 
  russia is like a drunk driver that hit a pregnant mother and got away , and then on the next party russia is bragging about getting away . 
   if a child is circumcised despite it being illegal , the parents or legal guardian should be prosecuted and imprisoned for permanently scarring a minor . 
  this sounds so fucking good . 
  i want this in sweden too !, 
  there is a reason why `` mocha '' in russian means piss i suppose . 
  [ in sweden our social democrats do n't have a box . 
  they have a monkey and a man in a funny hat . 
  ] ( http://www.socialdemokraterna.se/upload/central/loggor/rosen/rosen_rgb.jpg ), 
  never heard of anyone being butthurt of ** lacking ** the xenophobic asshole that is zhyrik . 
  but what do i know . . 
  the best part is that their group is named in english . 
  the block between the plug and the monitor connector should be able to handle that . 
  it 's a converter and if you read its inputs should be 110-230v 50/60hz . 
  you mean the sanctions that the russian government has put in place ? 
  like food bans etc that actually strike against the general population of russia ? 
  or you mean the european sanctions where 200 rich dudes can not visit their daughters in paris ? 
  all other names were taken . 
  damn , there are a few people in the world that i respect as much as the chechens and ingushetians . 
  you 'd just bitch about it on facebook like the rest of us . 
  because high risk also leads to possibly high earnings . 
  that 's why people invest in china too . 
  the communist party can seize everything tomorrow for all we know . 
  not an expert on the case but i saw some explanaition offered was that it is such a rare poison that it would n't be looked for . 
  and it almost worked , iirc , the poison was discovered by luck/accident . 
   people should pay less attention wonder in what normal country a minister could say those words and still be in office . 
  nor do 99.99 % of the men . 
  what 's your point ? 
  when i first heard my friend tell that she met this really neat girl named `` she-vonne '' that i should meet , i assumed it was an black us national : s, 
  and even if they 're not a part of some organised crime group begging is not a sustainable way of earning money . 
  meaning that even if they get money today there is no guarantee they will survive tomorrow . 
  in short , there is no need to encourage the behaviour in first place . 
  must be why russian economy is doing so tremendously well . 
  yeah but he ca n't resign can he ? 
  he cant flaunt his wealth etc. 
  that 's basically being a rich man in a prison . 
  good old putin outsmarted everybody !, 
  does this mean blatter is can not run for the next president of fifa ? 
  ah the good old brother nation doing brotherly things . 
  yeah , except the whole national identity is different . 
  ukraine never was a major power . 
   you implied , sarcastically , that ukraine received no concrete material benefits from its relationship with russia , and i pointed out that that 's bullshit i pointed out that ukraine is not having any russian `` freebies '' right now . 
   ( i did n't even mention the millions of ukrainians working in russia and whose annual remittances account for as much as 3 % of gdp so what ? 
  they work ( ed ) in russia and contribute ( d ) to russian econonmy with competence , growth and taxes . 
  i 'm not sure how this is `` ukraine leeching off russia '' . 
  if i go to germany to work , is sweden `` leeching '' of germany then ? 
   , the 3 to 4 b$ gazprom pays in transit fees annually , as they should , it 's not a freebie . 
   or the fact that most of the industry in the east is to a large extent useless if severed from the russian economy ) . 
  how is that a `` freebie '' again ? 
  most of eu technologies are useless without bought & licensed products from the us , does this mean that eu is having `` freebies '' from the us ? 
  no it 's not . 
  between 1991 and 2013/2014 ukraine payed lower gas prices in cash and compensated for the discount with such things as : * hosting the russian black sea fleet on their soil . 
  * various political promises ( basically being a puppet of russia ) once ukraine said ** no ** to the second part , the `` brother nation '' of russia decided to invade . 
  so i 'm not quite sure how you can consider ukraine being in any moral debt before russia . 
  but i 'll gladly see what you have to offer . 
  that discount came with strings attached . 
  now that ukraine did n't want those strings , they pay the highest prices . 
  so i do n't see how that is relevant . 
  well he already shown that he does n't speak any russian . 
  there is still time for some christmas presents . .
