  this is the fundamental problem of russia , there is no alternative and those who are close to putin are scary as hell too . 
  i habe facebook but at least i can block some of its tracking features if i 'm on a desktop . 
  the phone apps scan my messages , photos , my location all the time . 
  that is much more invasive than the website . 
  you 're really keen on seeing what the kremlins cellars look like ? 
  i 'm sorry but i do n't understand how concrete gives better soundproofing . 
  it 's a denser material that can transmit sound waves better . 
  wood is a soft porous material that does not transmit sound waves as efficiently . 
  omg you 're such a nut case . 
  if finland invaded lappland and occupied our iron ore , south sweden 's economy would plummet too . 
  why should it be different in ukraine ? 
  i speak neither danish nor norwegian . 
  i do however understand spoken and written norwegian . 
  edit :  ( norwegian and swedish fall into this category . ), 
  whatever man , i 'm not that into norway so i cant tell about their cultural output but if you think sweden has small cultural output you do n't know what you 're talking about . 
  sweden has some of the most read modern time writers , some of the most read children book authors of all time , we have crazy music export to just mention a few things . 
   most foreign media is made available through english anyway . 
  through translations and subtitles . 
  no it 's not . 
   and most people from the developed world use english when communicating online anyway . 
  so fucking what ? 
  i could come by with english only in sweden . 
  i would just be shut off from ** all ** everyday conversations , news etc. 
  i would be like those foreigners that do n't learn swedish for 8 years cause they do n't need to . 
  technically it 's correct but in order to function on a social level you really need to . 
  you really seem to be pushing hardcore the `` english is awesome , everyone who does n't speak it is barbarian '' - line . 
  i do n't understand why though ? 
  sure , on a functional level it might be true . 
  what happened to expanding your own knowledge ? 
  should everyone just drop dead after highschool and watch re-runs of 2 1/2 men , because it 's so great ? 
  and who 's gon na determine if a research of say development of some arbitrary product can have a military application ? 
  pretty much everything can be used . 
  from research of organisation theory , logistics , laser research or whatever . 
  trust me as a guy knowing 5 languages - your cultural supply becomes infinitely bigger just by knowing one additional language . 
  imagine if you did n't speak english , you would be cut off from reddit and all other wonderful things . 
  now if you know some spanish/croatian/whatever , you can watch their movies , read their papers etc. 
  languages are not that heavy to carry around , 
   i doubt too that the russian security services have the expertise to understand even a fraction of the papers that they are demanding to see . 
  you do realize the scale of the apparatus needed if you want the fsb to have an actual competent review ? 
  in my field i could probably judge a fairly narrow set of publications , 2-3 at most . 
  this will be done in usual russian fashion - without thinking first . 
  not this again ... but if you are going to start again you know where you can buy premium iron . 
  regards sweden, 
  not really . 
  germany actually has quite a lot of renewables . 
  which means that they have production peaks where they just dump the markets with cheap electricity . 
  at other times when renewables do n't produce germany has to import from less than desirable sources now that they down sized their conventional generating facilities ( nuclear most and foremost ) . 
  a bit simplified - generally bringing renewables into the energy mix leads to higher volatility on the market . 
  but in total over the year they might ( and do ) export more than they import . 
  i think solar is a better choice for them . 
  yes they are . 
  i hate that you 're right :(, 
   merkel and hollande flying to moscow to acquire a truce ( notice to moscow , not even a neutral country ) . 
   also the way merkel let herself be treated . 
  she was often left alone waiting for hours on putin , and one time putin even let his dog in while he knew merkel feared dogs . 
   he also paraded her through an exhibition of stolen german art on a state visit . 
  sure , but what do you expect eu to do ? 
  send troops ? 
  you must judge the situation from how it was percieved then . 
  putin had requested and was granted the right to send troops to ukraine and an official war was actually very likely . 
  merkel and holland did the only reasonable pragmatic thing and shoved pride into their asses and went to deal with the devil . 
   what to say more , russia has crimea , ukraine is incapacitated by a frozen conflict , ** the sanctions have hurt europe just as much as they 've hurt russia ** , and as the bang on the fireworks , they are currently outmaneuvered in syria , where instead of removing assad as europe 's leaders want , russia is propping him up , and europeans do n't even dare to bomb isis in syria , let alone mingle in the war . 
  that is a blatant lie . 
  only a few fruit farmers were severely hit . 
  most of russian economic crisis is a perfect storm of incompetent leadership and oil price break-in . 
  sure they will keep their little toy dictator in power now and commit another grozny style genoside , do you want to compete ? 
  should we send bigger bombers than russia or what do you suggest ? 
   it was already apparent europe was militarily weak , but even it 's financial and economic ` power ' could n't provide any substantial counterweight , basically we 're checkmate currently . 
  the european doctrine was never to crush russia economically but just squeeze the power elite . 
  if you do n't know they 've whined quite a lot that they can not access their precious yachts and mansions in the riviera . 
  they made such a circus out of the fact that matvyenko could n't go unrestricted to new york or that kobzon could n't go to germany to world class doctors cuz he does n't trust russian medcine . 
  or that clown kiselev and [ his epic whine ? 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/10/russia-west-trading-places-freedom-of-speech-sanction-eu-dmitry-kiselev-putin )  i had expected that under pressure they would be forced to act decisive , and perhaps the americans thought the same , but at the moment they where more or less left alone by obama , this was not the case . 
   and they managed to turn europe into possibly the worst situation ever since the 1920s/30s , with the post-war order seriously being tested . 
  what is really being tested ? 
  honestly , the vw affair is a bigger economic challenge to eu than russia . 
  if you consider the almost 50 % drop in currency worth , increasing food prices and increased government control of things such as media , as well as hostile take overs of private companies and dead soldiers in undisclosed conflicts an improvement , all power to you . 
  edit : this is only things the government has admitted to . 
  i could go on and count stuff that is highly probable to have occurred too , such as russian involvement in mh17 . 
  please define `` weak '' . 
  because you ca n't really be surprised by eus indecisive behaviour . 
  if we could can and export indecisiveness we 'd be better of than norway . 
  i would n't say russia is better of right now compared to 2013 . . 
  years in power of leaders of former soviet union https://twitter.com/maxseddon/status/655704576033751040/photo/1, 
  i agree , the dutch are victims of russian funded terrorism , they are not a neutral party . 
  well i was banned without notice . 
  had to log out to see that my comments were n't visible . 
  so i contacted the mods about the issue with no reply . 
  then i registered another account that got banned quite quickly on the ground that it 's not allowed to register a new account to circumvent a ban . 
  oh my god . 
  are you arguing russia is a neutral party in this whole ordeal ? 
  welp i guess i should make embrace my identity and get myself one of those epa-traktors before i go to sture-p . 
  europe - a place that has an objective border exactly where * i * want . 
  as a swedish exchange student i 'm very happy with the quality of german technology faculties but the hierarchy along with the different departments of secretaries that do one specific thing is really bad . 
  extremely inflexible bureaucracy . 
  sigh , `` everybody outside of stockholm is a redneck '' . 
  you got ta be a sad sad person . 
   thats cute because he commented in his study of profession you know , it 's still possible to comment with agenda * even * if you are educated in a field . 
  arms is basically the only thing russia still can manufacture and export ... and of course ikea drinking cups . 
  and with the help of modern plastic surgery it can become 30 fabulous years !,
