  basically damage control from putler 's side . 
  putler would never go further than the current conflict zone as his puny economy could never handle such an aggression . 
  on vacation . 
  with buks . 
  poor polan :(, 
  how does it feel , denmark ? 
  but seriously though , considering the public debate climate being all about the environment nowadays i 'm seriously surprised . 
  `` too neutral '', 
  what are they gon na do , request a fighter jet escort because russia hands out buks to random people ? 
  for international flights , not domestic . 
  check out scotland , i think you can study without tuition there if to are an eu citizen . 
  this is pretty much spot on . 
  as you said in point nr 2 , in the russosphere , there is russia , and russia 's cousins from the countryside - ukraine and belarus . 
  two countries without very strong national identities ( unlike those of for example poland ) . 
  so from a russian point of view , these countries are basically an extension of russia . 
  imagine if your retarded cousin from the countryside ( ukraine ) suddenly revolted against you and now has the chance of passing you in wealth/power and all that . 
  that would be a ** huge ** blow to the russian mindset where ukraine just ca n't be a partner on the same eye height with russia . 
  what has the us todo with this ? 
  just like conscription then ? 
  just like you germans in the 40ies i suppose ? 
   exactly . 
  since 1992 , they 've poured $ 5.1 billion dollars into democracy building-programs in ukraine . 
  how criminal . 
  in the laundry, 
   to a point where lost child can bother random pedestrian and ask it to be walked home . 
  good point . 
  i forgot the kids . 
  drunks and kids get a freecard on the talking bit . 
  mentally challanged too . 
  that said , we 're actually quite helpful in everyday situations . 
  if you need directions and so on , we 'll gladly help . 
   there was nothing inbetween . 
  you mean everyone was on vacation abroad ? 
  how much is your day to day native language influenced by english ? 
  i 'm sorry i 'm totally oblivious to india and it 's regions , but i once saw a documentary about two indian girls who when spoke their native language seemed to have many english words in it . 
  and i do n't mean words like `` iphone '' and `` computer '' , but rather `` pants '' and the like . 
  aww , litte brother !, 
  i think it 's universal in northern countries to be a little more reserved to strangers . 
  unlike southern countries , there never was a crowded cities and anything like that . 
  so either you were `` one of us '' or a `` stranger '' . 
  once `` one of us '' swedes are among the very best friends , but it 's very hard for an outsider to come in under that shell of `` leave me alone '' . 
  actually i spoke once to an american girl who 's living in sweden about this . 
  she said that americans are very forward going and are going to talk to you about a lot and without hesitation , but you wo n't necessarily are great frends for that reason , once you move away you may never hear of your once oh so talkative neighbour . 
  unlike in sweden we tend to keep our friendships tight and are n't afraid to cross great distances to hook up . 
  can someone finally ban this dude ? 
  it 's okay being pro russia , but being a dick is n't . 
  do n't talk to me unless we 're drunk or know each other . 
  ( being facebook friends does n't necessary mean you can come up and talk to me btw . ), 
  [ respect my private space . 
  ] ( http://static.fjcdn.com/large/pictures/0a/da/0adae2_3614209.jpg ) [ respect my private space !, 
  ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qmcx7cachky/tz5jxagmnui/aaaaaaaaakm/340_gyzpomk/s1600/waiting%2bfor%2bthe%2bbus%252c%2blike%2ba%2bswede%2b-%2bimgur.jpg ), 
  obviously the separatists were intended to play a different role from what eventually played out . 
  russia counted on either no confrontation or that it would be easily repelled by the separatists and force ukraine in a position where they basically would take any peace deal thrown at them from moscow . 
  but now we see that it is now not if but when uaf clears the east . 
  so for russia there are two options : full scale intervention which we all know russian economy would n't manage , not to mention the diplomatic blow . 
  or try saving face and make some deal where they at least get some trophy to brag about on national tv . 
  if they do n't get a trophy , it will be very hard to save face domestically for putin considered the tone and reports in russia media . 
  so ukraine needs ( pragmatically speaking ) to offer a `` win '' of some kind that does n't cripple ukraine itself from going west . 
   the whole point of nuclear weapons is defensive use , and seeing as using them essentially means killing yourself , they 're kind of redundant are n't they ? 
  except russia has stated that if they feel that the existence of russia is threatened , they will retaliate with nukes . 
  with poutine at the driving wheel , `` threatened existence '' could mean `` he fears he 'll lose power '' . 
  i 'm positively surprised by poland , howcome this high proficiency ? 
  anyone with insight ? 
  sweden  norway  denmark . 
  i can sleep tight . 
   bosnian guy you mean de facto * people 's king * . 
  follow . 
  every . 
  instruction . 
  they will rip you off for the smallest mistake , that 's where they make the money . 
  who knows , those pesky aids researchers quite certainly had evil homosex propaganda aboard and were about to enter russian airspace . 
  we all know that it 's prohibited in russia . 
  only recent history , further back in time , poland was one of the major powers of europe . 
  [ relevant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rl-kv_iudq ), 
  so , i lied to mom once that i did not drink . 
  is every statement of my life further lies ? 
  dude !, 
  you 'll offend russia with such `` offensive '' weapons !, 
  studying a masters in engineering in sweden . 
  there are many general benefits with this , such as more competitive foreign students can study . 
  most stem research is done in english anyway and so on . 
  and the leading eu politicians are deeply concerned . 
  freedom fries *, 
  it 's so big on my tiny screen that i had to scroll . 
  now drooling , thanks alot !, 
  buckwheat is coming through in sweden as a healthy alternative food . 
  basically the equivalent would be if i go to a city hall , and go and buy shoes from store x because the clerk from store y is a huylo , the clerk from y can go and stab me in the back because he now felt i was driving him out of business ? 
  so you really think they 'd fire the nukes because we decided not to buy their goods ? 
  is that how it works now ? 
  yeah i 'm mad . 
  with that reason used by russia , half o siberia should return to china , karelia return to finland and so on . 
  let 's apply your solid logic the other way , shall we ? 
  nah , it 's not retarded to call the only country 's leader since ww2 annexing other countrie 's territory putler , huylo or hutler . 
  because , you know , it 's kind of a dick move ... 
  last time russia dealt with that they slaughtered half a population . 
  `` how to run a country '' . 
  but do they beat us in * snus * consumption ? 
  you know , the important stuff ? 
  you forgot a `` not '', 
  look at ukraine - no money but bucketloads of old soviet weapons .
