  or ukraine . 
  imagine the russian press . . 
  so why you post if you yourself do n't believe it ? 
  i liked pol pot , he did n't care what the people thought of him either . 
  he was a true * leader * ... edit : if you do n't see the sarcasm above , you never will . . 
  but if russia collapsed tomorrow . 
  it would only be a regional crisis . 
  if india collapsed it would be a global . 
  so by this logic we should kick out russia and invite india into sc . 
  india has more than enough to blow up all major cities and change life on the planet as we know it . 
  not sure what your point is . 
  so do pakistan and india . 
   i can only assume he was of no stranger to being able to get girls number . 
  he 's got the power of fsb on his side . 
  he does n't even need to ask the girl . 
  considering this , all african states and kingdoms are more democratic than [ norway ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/democracy_index#democracy_index_by_country_.282014.29 ) . 
  i 'm not sure norway has ever had an black general . 
  we 've specced that skill so it 's instant cast and costs no mana . 
  the downside is that it 's totally pointless . 
  yeah do n't try to avoid now . 
  you said anyone who is not anti muslim is a traitor trying to facilitate rape culture and should be punished . 
  no , try reading an article once in a while instead of commenting without reading . 
  you might learn something . 
  yeah , come at me bro . 
  is it typical for sd people like you to want to punish someone who disagrees ? 
  or are you just another of those `` enstaka r\u00f6t\u00e4gg '' ( few foul eggs ) ? 
  but muh muslim rape train !, 
  are you saying all comments i 've been reading about sweden the past two weeks on / r/europe are wrong ? 
  excuse : none of us can afford it there . 
  would be really funny . 
  i answered that i could consider moving to greece too . 
  i can really consider moving there . 
  however , i would barely consider moving anywhere if i did n't have a job offer , even ** within ** my country . 
   could you help me ? 
  no one can . 
  you 've made a discussion about a kid being kicked into a discussion about your quality of life . 
  i would rather argue that innovation and services are especially hard to outsource . 
  services are highly dependant on mutual understanding between customer and provider . 
  if your asian it consultant does n't understand what you want/expect you might as well go for an expensive european one . 
  hell , there is even huge difference between eu and us on this front not to mention intra-eu differences . 
  there is a reason why the whole `` outsource it to india '' - thing has n't really proved fruitful . 
  and it 's not because indians are worse programmers or whatever . 
   on industrial level , the future seems rather bright for nordics . 
  more and more production is being automatized and that requires less , but more educated workforce ( which is also expensive , exactly those which nordics have ) and much more energy - which happens to be very cheap in nordics . 
  if i 'm not wrong , nordics have the lowest electricity prices in europe , thanks to norway 's mountains , denmark 's windmills and swedish-finnish nuclear power plants . 
  our electricity prices are very low , yes . 
  but in sweden we have a combination of a lot of nuclear and actually quite a lot of water power plants too . 
  approx 40 % . 
  this is our actual weak spot as a lot of our heavy industry relies on cheap energy , and the common eu electricity market that is coming will certainly ruin that . 
  so that 's actually a challenge there . 
   the service sector is a bit more vulnerable , but all in all , sweden has shown excellent innovation , and high wages lure more talents , improving the situation even more . 
  i would say quite the opposite , that our service sector is the one with actual growth and vitality . 
  there is no real growth in the heavy industry in terms of jobs , on the other hand our engineering and computer service industries continue to grow . 
   haha , if you say so . 
  i actually was n't taking you seriously and replied as such . 
  i do n't see why my initial reply is not to be taken seriously ? 
   the intent behind i 'm sure was to trip , and as i said , nobody gets a leg sweep right all the time , especially someone who actually does n't really do it very often or at all . 
  what is your motivation that her intent was a trip ? 
  because she actually charged the kid and kicked it , a normal trip or sweep is not done with someone charging a person . 
  especially if they 're inexperienced at any sort of fighting . 
   but here we go , i guess my definition of a kick differs vastly from yours . 
  no , your definition differs from * everone else 's * . 
   it certainly is not some feeble attempt by some woman whose only experience at kicking something is most likely a ball . 
  at least , in my opinion . 
  so far in this thread you 're pretty much alone with excusing this as `` not an intent to kick '' . 
  even people who defend her rather take the approach of `` it 's her right to kick '' or whatever . 
   however , please do continue to completely take what i said and am saying out of context . 
  i now quoted your full reply , nothing without context . 
  well swedish national anthem is mostly sung on ice hockey events . 
  so it brings fond memories . 
  especially when finnish people are around . 
  interestingly , ukraine 's national anthem has a similar fatalistic approach https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shche_ne_vmerla_ukraina  shche ne vmerla ukraina ( ukrainian : \u0429\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u0432\u043c\u0435\u0440\u043b\u0430 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0430 , ** ukraine has not yet died ** ), 
  instead of arguing about what you said before you deflect the discussion to martial arts ? 
  very well then . 
  i 'll gladly show you that a round house kick is not necessarily a high kick . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roundhouse_kick if you see closely , a roundhouse kick is a style of kick , not where it lands . 
  got any more deflections or are you ready to argue on the point we were discussing from start ? 
   still looks to me like she was trying to trip the girl . 
  if my definition of fun is to beat you up , are you ok with that ? 
  if your definition of a trip is a round house kick chuck norris style , then i guess we can call it that ... http://i.imgur.com/vugffwl.jpg, 
  i 'm sure the kid getting kicked will lead to a better future of germany . . why do n't you follow your advise and / u/stopbeingaloser ? 
  i think we 'll succeed in keeping the general structure of our model with a few adjustments . 
  sweden and its workers should n't and indeed ca n't compete on price on the world market . 
  we have to compete on being a niche partner which can compete on quality . 
  and i think in general even our traditional working class workforce is highly trained and skilled . 
  you make it sound like it 's a common thing . 
  it is an act of terrorism and should be prosecuted as such . 
  they guy is in custody and a process has started . 
  what would russia do ? 
  if you hoover my flair , 
  but think of all the immigrants that wont steal the jobs anymore !, 
   ukrainian - bizhenets ( this is probably wrong , as there are two letters we do n't have in macedonian cyrillic ) . 
  it 's correct !, 
  that last letter indicates a soft `` ts '', 
  most of the time they actually deserve it though . 
  [ we 're doing fine , thanks for asking . 
  good job , little brother !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christer_fuglesang ), 
  i 'm sure you 'll be able to keep it . 
  norway and sweden have an open boarder too .
