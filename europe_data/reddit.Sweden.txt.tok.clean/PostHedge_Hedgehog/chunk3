  oh , i was just being sarcastic and using different names for the same people . 
  latins , as in , you know , the equivalent of `` germanic people '' but for the french , italians , spanish and romanians ? 
  i thought it was called latin people ? 
  you know , it 's kind of how italy has latin , mediterranean , white and caucasian people all at the same time . 
  and what country is this for ? 
  online dating must be the most comfortable thing ever , especially if it 's a service which accomodates for people simply wanting to hook up right away :p, 
  and to be honest , some degree incest can be kinda hot in that forbidden way . 
  finnic people such as the finns and the sapmi look a lot more asian than the north germanic icelanders !, 
  you meet for a coffee , and move it to the bedroom if you get along . 
  after some time of being exclusive fuck buddies , you 're in a relationship . 
  and to add : if we with all our modern technology can not consider ourselves wealthy enough to provide art , the most essentially human thing there is , for everyone , are we really prioritizing right ? 
  it 's based on humanism and a socialist-flavoured `` solidarity with the international worker '' , and that every person `` has the right to not live in a horrible country such as somalia '' . 
  in a sense it 's quite a nice thought , and it would be great if all countries of the world accepted immigrants and refugees as freely as sweden . 
  the main problem is that only 60 % of the immigrants ( in 2012 ) has the equivilant of a high school education , which makes them eligible for only 2.5 % of the jobs available on the swedish market ... 
  this combined with offering them social welfare which is unavailable for swedes is what has made a lot of people kinda tired of the current immigration levels . 
  ugh , people get this wrong all the time , you got ta think about the blahbbity blah . 
  nay , we like to imagine that russia does n't exist and that norway , sweden and finland is an island . 
  it 's pretty common to refer to denmark and the rest down there as `` down on the continent '' . 
  we have increased the amount of unskilled and illiterate people who immigrate to our country !, 
  that should take care of it , no ? 
  damn how cheap food is down on the continent !, 
  well , if you did n't want to hear that danish is a silly language , you should keep your mouth shut . 
  interesting that only 5 % of the swedes were concered about the immigration but 43 % about the social welfare . 
  those two tends to be linked ( `` darn good for nothin ' immigrants takin mah money !, 
  congratulations , you 're a smug bastard !, 
  i do understand the difference between the extreme left and the right , and even know the fine differences between plenty of subsystems of each kind . 
  what i was employing was basic rhetoric regarding the rights to not be killed that ** every ** human has , even if they 're a fascist !, 
  even if you say that fascists would n't accept your lifestyle , insinuating that you would n't care at all ( and even enjoy ) if fascists are killed or seriously harmed does n't make you that much different than them , for obviously you share the same ideas of there being proper humans and subhumans with different mindsets worth less !, 
  well , the same thing could be said about extreme left activists ( has n't there even been more human `` cleansing '' projects done by extreme left govt than fascist ones ? 
  ) , and with that logic , fascists and other extreme rights could `` legitimately '' kill them . 
  for otherwise , they would be killed by them . 
  it 's a circular logic which just fuels more violence on the other side , and therefor it 's unacceptable for any side to do it . 
  everyone has the basic right to live , no matter their political leaning . 
  besides , what if it 's just some poor sod who was peer pressured into becoming a nazi ? 
  good that he was `` killed for the cause of freedom '' then ? 
   what 's wrong with killing people who i do n't politically agree with ? 
  it would n't be the same if it was legal and planned . 
  now , it 's this thrilling and relatively permitted but still highly illegal act to burn in christmas !, 
  it seems like there are about 15-16 million jews in the world , according to this [ wikipedia list . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_religious_populations#jews ) it 's difficult to know how many of these are practicing , and how many non-practicing and `` undeclared '' jews there are out there though . 
  * he failed . 
  [ and this is the reason why we consume more wine than anything else . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2pmvwfryv8 ) btw , south koreans drink a crazy amount of spirits !, 
  i thought they could n't handle it due to their lower amount of alcohol dehydrogenase ? 
   the germans had aspirations of being the greatest continental power since napoleon and having their `` place in the sun '' internationally . 
  of course , which major european powers did n't ? 
  i only meant that they did n't have any direct interests in the war , i.e. 
  no territories to conquer or enemies to disarm . 
   no , germany declared war on france first . 
  ok , i did some googling and you 're right , france did n't declare war on germany before they entered belgium , though it was pretty clear that they would step in to fight with russia . 
  if anything , germany should 've simply focused on defending the western front instead of trying to remove it completely . 
  yes , norway , we know you 're richer than they are . 
  if the finger of blame should be pointed at anyone , a particular set of austrians caused the world wars . 
  ironic how the habsburger legacy culminated with a tiny little landlocked country . 
  what about if the netherlands decide to attack , i do n't know , the central african republic because they are allied with a country which attacked the netherlands due to a competition of resources for their industries , and in the process forcibly move their troops through cameroon ( who has n't given the netherlands permission for this ) ? 
  would it be right for germany to attack the netherlands then because they 're old pals with cameroon , and also have sensitive naval bases there ? 
  by `` the elite '' , i think it 's being referred to that the wars happen because of interests held by rich capitalists and dusty military connections . 
  only times `` the people '' scream for war is when there 's a food shortage . 
   britian entered the war in response to the invasion of friendly democracies by a major power . 
  first of all , did n't france technically declare war on germany through its alliance with russia , which attacked austria-hungary after it sought to annex serbia ? 
  the uk entered because it was guaranteeing the independence of belgium , which germany entered as a transit zone to bypass the extremely fortified alsace borders . 
  secondly , these democracies with all their freedom systematically abused people in the colonies , and suppress independence movements in order to maintain their power ( those people in ireland did n't appreciate their british freedom that much ) . 
  in the end , it was just about political domination . 
  the uk felt threatened by the `` new '' german empire and did n't want this highly industrialized country to impose on its hegemony , and france had already been in and out with them ( they lost the previous time ) and wanted another shot at showing how glorious they are . 
  austria-hungary wanted to expand into serbia , since they were already a struggling empire of countless nationalities , so why not ? 
  `` they '' already disgraced them . 
  if there is one side which really would n't gain anything by a new war , it was germany . 
  but its society with its prussian values were all fetishy for the military , so why would n't they honor their alliance with the austro-hungarians ? 
  the only people fighting for the `` cause of freedom '' would probably be the reds over in russia , who the uk and france intervened against and tried to smash down just after ww1 . 
   1994 nothing happened . 
  the goat followed the swedish national hockey team to italy for the world championship in hockey . 
  bad goat !, 
  considering that it would have to be in a country where you 'll be living and working for quite a few years , i 'd recommend it to be somewhere you like . 
  so i suppose this rule does n't really affect the already present immigration stream from maghreb africa ? 
  both finland and estonia were considered natural parts of sweden , i can imagine that that was pretty bonding for both of people . 
  latvia and lithuania on the other hand , were n't . 
  my maternal granddad 's family also came from and fled k\u00f6ningsberg ( and neukirsch , nowadays known as slavsk ) . 
  crazy journey first to berlin , then ending up in sweden . 
  and you ca n't measure atoms without \u00c5 . 
  kinda old data , but even if that graph was correct in showing the current trend , the total amount of reported crimes could still increase even though it decreases per capita . 
  sweden does have a relatively high population growth compared to many other european states . 
  what happened to croatianpride , except for the 90s ? 
  will there have to be a majority of the scottish population voting yes for it to suceced , or only among those who vote ? 
  will vote absentees count as unionists ? 
  mayo and sauerkraut ? 
  that 's about as representative of kebab pizzas as [ icelanders eating piss shark ] ( http://imgur.com/gallery/ok04t ) for breakfast !, 
  ok , wait , that 's actually a bad comparison . 
  we do n't put saurkraut or mayo on our pizzas . 
  food preferences and techniques is an easy way of being nationalistically superiour to others . 
  since there 's no right or wrong way but only customs , it 's all about who can scream ( type ) the loudest . 
  however much i love turkish food ( especially dolmas < 3 ) tzatsiki 's pretty overrated !, 
  shh , let the greeks and italians feel good about something , they do n't have much else to be proud about . 
  silly livonia , we are fatherland !, 
  ok , kinda irrelevant , but serbia definitely can not into the eu until you explain ** [ this ] ( http://www.google.com/trends/explore?q=gore#q=gore&amp;cmpt=q ) ** !, 
  * serbia , the home of the rich , gay and emo of the european union . 
  i 'm not sure how the case is in the rest of europe , but here in sweden practically all of this new and rising antisemitism comes from out-of-europe immigrants who have grown up with an almost borat-like distrust and mockery of jews . 
  it 's not as if germany 's done anything to get greece back on it 's feet . 
  if anything , most of southern europe 's problems can be blamed on germany !, 
  did you know that it 's a proven fact that literally all economic and societal problems in europe are direct results from what germany did 70 years ago ? 
  the question was whether the statue was inflammatory against another ethnicity , which would 've been the russians in this case .
