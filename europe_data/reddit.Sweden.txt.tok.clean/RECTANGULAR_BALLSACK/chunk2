  as a matter of fact , when things have been dubbed over here , people have complained about it -- a lot . 
  that 's why we generally do n't do that , and that 's why it 's limited to children 's movies and shows . 
  we actually prefer hearing the real voices , when given a choice !, 
  i do n't know why this is so hard for you to believe . 
  we do n't dub french or chinese movies either . 
  people like you have been saying that for quite a while now . 
  meanwhile , we live in one of the best governed countries in the world , with one of europe 's best economies . 
  you 're the ones living in a shithole . 
  i like maps where [ europe 's sixth largest lake ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/v%c3%a4ttern ) has n't been turned into land . 
  you 're out of your mind and delusional if you think you 're safer from rape and murder in india than sweden or the usa . 
  that sort of thinking is probably what killed this guy . 
  terrible , but i ca n't understand why any european would travel to a country lacking proper plumbing or toilet paper , where the air reeks of manure , rape is rampant and large parts of the population are literally treated worse than cattle ... 
  [ cherry blossoms at kungstr\u00e4dg\u00e5rden in stockholm ] ( https://imgur.com/a/lz7sh ), 
  not really . 
  this system has [ been ] ( http://www.kristianstadsbladet.se/opinion/huvudledare/article2017963/kvitta-ut-skolkande-politiker.html ) [ abused ] ( http://www.dn.se/nyheter/politik/kvittningskaoset-i-riksdagen-over/ ) , and the established political parties have still not included the sweden democrats in this agreement , so calling us `` more civilized '' is just plain wrong . 
  ( there 's an `` unwritten '' agreement between the parliamentary parties in which members voluntarily refrain from voting , when someone representing the opposing view is missing . ), 
  `` serious deflation '' ? 
  that 's alarmist , and i have yet to see anyone arguing for qe in sweden . 
  no one is worried about a serious problem with deflation . 
  the deflation is caused by a drop in prices of clothes , and the riksbank 's unwillingness to drop the interest rates , because the board is overly paranoid about the housing market , when there 's no proof of any speculation or `` asset bubbles '' happening . 
  everyone seem to agree this could be corrected in a heartbeat , if the man in charge of the riksbank was n't such a paranoid mongoloid ... we have a housing shortage , and if the politicians got off their asses , and made it easier to build new homes then we would n't have this problem with high household debt either . 
  it takes about 10 years just to get an approval to build a new house in sweden . 
  no wonder the prices are high . 
  no incentive ? 
  the incentive is a lower fare for the customer , and no taxes for the driver . 
   as-is traditional cabs evade taxes constantly and many will tell you about it if you ask them why they prefer cash . 
  maybe in the us , but not so much in sweden for licensed taxicabs ... 
  if the customer broaches the subject of traveling further or says that he changed his mind about the destination , offering cash , the rating of the driver would n't be affected negatively one bit . 
  but the driver can still change the destination and negotiate a new cash price without uber knowing anything about it , right ? 
  also , i was writing about how it works in sweden . 
  i 'm not against services like uber , i just do n't think there 's a legitimate reason for them not wanting to use a taximeter here in sweden . 
  the taximeter records an astounding amount of information , and it 's kept and sealed for 3-10 years here . 
  if a driver is caught in a flying checkpoint or tax audit , and the data records show a discrepancy with your handwritten notes you 'll get fined , will loose your taxi license and face possible prison time . 
  it 's a good way to keep the business free from tax dodgers . 
  uber can be used as like a central booking service , or act as middleman , for black market drivers to get in contact with new customers . 
  the driver and customer can negotiate for a new price and change their ride destination once they get in contact with each other , without uber not * officially * knowing anything about it ( or looking the other way , depending on which version you believe ) . 
  the tax dodging drivers would be impossible to spot in a police checkpoint or tax audit , since the cars are n't equipped with a taximeter . 
  btw , i 'm not a taxi driver , but i do have a valid taxi drivers license , so i 'm probably more informed about this than the average person . 
  interesting . 
  however , the problem of this service enabling drivers to escape taxation , thus undermining legitimate taxi services , still stands . 
  if uber sweden only was interested in delivering the best possible services , i do n't see why they would be against using a taximeter ... 
  i do n't expect the general public or tech writers to understand or support a ban , as taxi companies are n't generally that popular , and the public only care about the possibility of cheap fares , but i can see how a service like uber will cause several problems . 
  most important is the safety aspect , with drivers lacking formal training using shoddy vehicles , and the fact that the black market economy could thrive from it . 
  in sweden , any driver receiving monetary ( or other compensation ) for the transportation of goods or persons needs a valid taxi license and possibly an additional permit to operate a taxi service . 
  someone with a criminal history , medical problems , or a person with a history of bad business practices is generally not granted these permissions . 
  from what i 've understood , they do operate in sweden , but only as a private limousine service , in oder to escape the requirement to use a taximeter and having to post prices on the windows , resulting in ( official ) prices being approximately 50 % higher than regular taxis . 
  the government is however investigating the possibilities to close this `` loophole '' , requiring a taximeter in all cars that are being used commercially , which would make it harder for the uber drivers to cheat the government out of vat and other taxes . 
  i do n't think you can call it `` astroturfing '' though . 
  it 's the regular crowd of extreme leftists , that always want defend everything opposing the us , no matter what . 
  some of these people are the same type that praised lenin and stalin back in the day . 
  to them the world is still black and white . 
   several eu countries , including france , germany , italy , and spain , have voiced concern about taking steps that might antagonise russia . 
  what ? 
  that includes helping them restore law and order ? 
  goddamn , what a bunch of pussies !, 
  a murder or two happened . 
  the map appears to show murders per 100,000 population , and since the murder rates are low in some sparsely populated areas , a single case can pop out . 
  makes it quite useless , imo ... -- ** edit : ** i checked the stats for v\u00e4sternorrland and j\u00e4mtland county , and there were * zero homicides * in the area , according to the [ national council for crime prevention . 
  ] ( http://www.bra.se/dodligt-vald ) but the map says 5,5-9 ,2 homicides . 
  ( i mistook the shade of blue , and there were 368 k people living there in 2012 . ), 
  that sounds awfully high , considering how rural the area is , and the fact that there was only 68 murders in the entire country in 2012 . 
  i suspect they mixed up the numbers somehow ... 
  anyway , `` useless '' might have been a bit harsh , but what i meant was it would have been more interesting to see the average over more than one year , because limiting it only to one year can be very misleading if there 's an unusual event , like a family drama or a school shooting , resulting a couple of murders in one single occasion . 
  i can understand a general feeling of uneasiness in the baltics , but i 'm beginning to get tired of the speculation about a possible russian invasion , because it is silly for two very important reasons : * these countries are all members of the eu and nato * many eu member states have big business interests in the region ( sweden is by far the biggest foreign investor in the baltic region , but this is true also for finland , denmark , germany and lately poland ) this is why any russian aggression would most likely be met with a total ( more or less ) world-wide boycott of their economy and a military response from a number of nations . 
  russia would suffer badly ... and for what ? 
  sorry if i hurt some feelings here , but the baltic states does n't hold any significant amount of valuable natural resources or is a strategic landmass worth all that trouble . 
  putin may be an asshole , but he 's not dumb . 
  that being said , i think it 's important that the eu member states stop being so naive about their energy policies and increase military spending , because russia is clearly moving in the wrong direction , and its shameful that we still expect the us to bail us out whenever there is trouble . 
  haha !, 
  that 's fucking hilarious . 
  who said the germans have no sense of humor ? 
  eu member states trade balance with russia , 2012 - a negative figure shows more imports than exports . 
  russia is the third trading partner of the eu , and the eu is the first trading partner of russia . 
  eu exports to russia are dominated by machinery and transport equipment , chemicals , medecines and agricultural products . 
  eu imports from russia are dominated by raw materials , in particular , oil and gas . 
  source : bbc/eurostat [ 1 ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26436291 ) & [ 2 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/countries-and-regions/countries/russia/ ) energy dependence % - all energy products , 2012 - shows the extent to which an economy relies upon imports in order to meet its energy needs . 
  the indicator is calculated as net imports divided by the sum of gross inland energy consumption plus bunkers . 
  more than half of the eu-27 's energy comes from countries outside the eu -- and this proportion has been generally rising over the last decade . 
  much of this energy comes from russia , whose disputes with transit countries have threatened to disrupt supplies in recent years -- for example , between 6 and 20 january 2009 , gas flows from russia via ukraine were interrupted .

  whoop-de-fucking-do !, 
  it 's worth noting that it is an online poll , and on one of the papers owned by murdoch . 
  the people who read that paper are brainwashed . 
  this is something rupert murdoch has worked on [ since the 90 's ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jun/12/rupert-murdoch-john-major ) , and a lot of britons , especially the ones reading the sun , have been spoon-fed euroscepticism and outright lies about the eu since birth . 
  i 'm not saying the eu is perfect , far from it . 
  but we need to stick together , and if it does n't work you do n't abandon it , you change it -- and favoring russia above the eu is moronic . 
  i know the rules are pretty strict in sweden , despite what most people say . 
  but the amount of hyperbole and speculation about sigint on the intenet is just out of this world . 
  how many of you people who protest and bitch about this have actually read the legal framework governing sigint in our member countries ? 
  the european parliament should just stay out of things relating to national security , because they have very little insight or knowledge about it . 
  unlike most people , i have actually also read the report from libe , and the amount of speculation and biased choice of words about fra in that report was * embarrassing . 
  * the actually let a guy well known in sweden for opposing the fra ( mark klamberg ) to `` inform '' them about the fra . 
  what the hell ? 
  but whatever . 
  let 's just continue on with the hyperbole , stop all sigint , call it a day , stumble in the dark , and let the russians do whatever they wish ... 
  what ? 
  is that even an issue ? 
  it 's [ not like they are a big exporter ] ( http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d1eada38-521b-11df-8b09-00144feab49a.html#axzz2vev0g5uk ) of gas or oil to europe ( [ graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tyyrvuy.gif ) ) anyway . 
  seriously , why does some asshole always have to make everything a usa vs something issue ?
