   there is no such thing in sweden either which is a pity, 
  treason usually carries a death penalty in most countries , from what i 've understood . 
  i 'll admit that might be a bit rash , but in sweden a person like her could most definitely be sentenced to six years in prison for the lesser crime of `` betrayal of country '' , because she is partaking in foreign propaganda . 
  ukraine might have similar laws . 
  ugh , what a disgusting human being , if true . 
  people like her should be shot for treason , imo . 
  basically everything on the road : persons driving or riding any motorized vehicle or bicycle . 
  including person riding or herding an animal , passengers , pedestrians , and deaths within 30 days of the road accident . 
  confirmed suicide and natural death not included though ... [ glossary pdf ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/transport/road_safety/pdf/statistics/cadas_glossary.pdf ), 
  not sure why they are n't on the 2012 map . 
  but according to the [ datasheet ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/transport/road_safety/specialist/statistics/index_en.htm ) , they had 26 deaths per million inhabitants in 2012 . 
  also , cyprus had 133 in 2002 , and 59 in 2012 . 
  how much did romania , or any other nation , just give away then ? 
  swedish taxpayers have given greece loans of up to [ 11.3 billion eur , at an an annual interest of only 0.1 % ] ( http://www.friatider.se/patetisk-ranta-pa-svenskt-greklandslan ) ( when 30 % is the norm ) , among other things ... 
  so you clearly do n't seem to know what you are talking about . 
  so for the ukraine [ not to be completely invaded ] ( http://i.imgur.com/chcvswm.jpg ) , ashton and sikorski needs to do nothing , and bildt needs to hold a powerpoint presentation . 
  we can do this , europe !, 
  what are you even talking about ? 
  you 're not making any sense . 
  why should i have to explain that ? 
  why on earth do you think i support the us invasion of panama ? 
  you do realize that someone can condemn russia , and still be against some of the actions taken by the us government , right ? 
  i swear , some of you are fucking retarded ... 
  sigh . 
  did i say they should n't have the right to self-determination ? 
  no , i did n't ... do you feel the russians have the right to preemptively invade , and occupy crimea , because some ethnic russians in ukraine wish to secede ? 
  whatever gave you that idea ? 
  russian propaganda , perhaps ? 
  most of them probably did n't care prior to this , and a lot of them probably do n't want to be in the periphery of an undemocratic russian empire . 
  however things may be , it still does n't give russia the rights to invade crimea . 
  no , it 's not * fucking * ok !, 
  if a country thinks it has a legitimate claim on some other sovereign country 's land , you 're supposed to let the un decide . 
  you 're not allowed to invade and annex parts of another country , simply because you think you are right . 
  it sets a bad precedent , and brings us back to pre-world-war conditions . 
  not a bad idea to stop granting visas , etc. 
  however , far too many european countries are dependent on russian gas and oil . 
  if the russians retaliate , the european economy will take a huge hit . 
  i 'd be surprised if the eu did anything . 
  this whole conflict should be a wake-up call to all politicians in europe , to increase defense spending and start working for true energy independence . 
   i guess that 's why russians wanted the airports blocked to avoid further escalation . 
  you guess ? 
  it sounds like you 've bought into the russian propaganda hook , line , and sinker . 
  i have a hard time believing anyone is that naive though . 
  my guess is that you 're one of those left-wingers so intently focused on battling the horrible extreme right-wingers , that you are willingly disregarding everybody else ( i.e. 
  the majority ) protesting against the ukrainian regime and russia , because of that one small fraction of people ... 
  on an international perspective the nordic market is incredibly small though , and using that as an excuse to stop a merger that would have allowed for a global expansion of a combined volvo-scania was pretty much bullshit . 
  nothing would have stopped vw-man or daimler to expand their operations in the nordic market , and the eu could have set some conditions to the merger that would have addressed the situation , without stopping the merger completely . 
  but germany is pretty much running the eu , so i guess that 's ok . 
   caspar david friedrich i 'm not german , but [ this is one of my favorite paintings ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:caspar_david_friedrich_006.jpg ) -- so yes . 
  one internationally famous swedish present-day artist is [ oscar reutersv\u00e4rd ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oscar_reutersv%c3%a4rd ) , known for his various [ impossible figures . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fved1mj.jpg ) there are a lot of iconic paintings depicting historical events , [ like this one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gustaf_cederstr%c3%b6m ) or [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/valdemar_atterdag_holding_visby_to_ransom,_1361 ) , but it would be hard to pick one over the other , and artistically they are n't that well regarded . 
  but if i had to pick * one * , it would be [ anders zorn 's ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anders_zorn ) [ `` midsummer dance '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:midsommardans_av_anders_zorn_1897,_sharp.jpg ) and [ carl larsson 's ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carl_larsson ) [ `` flowers on the windowsill '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:blomsterf%c3%b6nstret_av_carl_larsson_1894.jpg ) would be a close second . 
  * recently : [ h\u00e5kan hellstr\u00f6m - det kommer aldrig va \u00f6ver f\u00f6r mig ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upx_t4yr3x8 ) * last decade : [ rebecka th\u00f6rnqvist - till och med en kung ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahdvy5dhabm ), 
  i was referring to the recovery , which is quicker in sweden . 
  and the polish gdp , while higher than the world average , is pretty much trudging along it ... 
  i 'm glad poland is doing well , but it [ does n't look as impressive when you compare it with other countries and the world , on a smaller scale . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wszeuis.png ) ( btw , i wonder what my country did in 2009 , that made the gdp jump that much ... ) edit : linking to an image , because i ca n't get the stats to stick , but [ here 's the page ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.pcap.cd/countries/1w-gr-se-de-pl-gb-ua?display=graph ) if you want to play around with it yourself . 
  i do n't think we need to worry about `` immigrants '' incurring any costs on other countries in the eu when they can shell out this kind of money . 
  for me it 's a matter of principle , and the fact that you now can buy a citizenship to gain access to business opportunities , and other things that would otherwise not be allowed for a non-eu citizen , only because we have one country that is corrupt . 
  sounds painfully familiar to the situation in sweden . 
  our minister represents a party that is traditionally hawkish . 
  i guess they all dance to a different tune when they actually have to govern ... but it 's kind of embarrassing when a country that `` officially '' is supposed to be self-reliant have to get help from lithuania . 
  regarding the british journalists last question about the french pm 's affair : why would it make france look like an `` international joke '' ? 
  the man had an affair with a lady , not unlike former british pm john major , and very unlike some other british mps who have been caught paying for `` rentboys '' , soliciting anonymous gay sex in parks , etc. . . afaik , most people do n't care , except maybe some sexually repressed brits . 
  of course not , but they are the ones that have been most vocal about criticizing the us for their spying ... all while spying and co-operating with the nsa on their own . 
  sweden and the uk have , on the other hand , pretty much said the same thing all along : information exchange is the norm , and the eu should stay out of matters relating to national security . 
  more silly posturing from our european politicians , this time from a different angle . 
  why not just say who these countries are : france and germany . 
  you ca n't pretend to be a tough lady and at the same time shy away from offending someone ... 
  here 's where i agree with the british : letting the eu handle our national security would be ludicrous , as they have shown themselves to be incompetent and a lot more corrupt and less transparent than our domestic institutions and politicians . 
  the headline is a little bit misleading . 
  the eu usually designate [ several cities each year ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_capital_of_culture ) as `` european capital of culture '' , and this year riga is sharing it with ume\u00e5 . 
  have the british gone completely mad ? 
  this was the whole point of the eu : freedom of movement of goods and people . 
  sorry , but you ca n't change your mind just like that . 
  if you do n't like it , fuck off then.the rest of europe better not give them a sweet deal . 
  cut them off completely . 
  that 's probably it . 
  i kind of get that , but those people are overlooking the fact that we 've had a net surplus in immigration every year since 1943 , with peaks in almost every decade . 
  so we 've been `` handling this shit '' for a long time . 
  if you look back , the current levels are n't that exceptional , and if this would have been a detriment to our society we would n't have let people in . 
  the majority of us are pragmatic like that . 
  fact is we 're doing better than most , and you could argue it 's * because * we 've historically been less nationalistic and more open than the rest of europe . 
  that being said , i do n't think you can have a welfare state with open immigration , so the levels have to regulated . 
  i think we 're at the levels of what we can manage right now . 
  sweden has one of the most diverse export-oriented economies in europe . 
  there are programs in place to retrain people to become skilled workers in two years , matching industry demand . 
  you also do n't need much skill to work in a factory , take care of the elderly , drive a bus , or whatever ... 
  so i have question to you people : why do you care so much ? 
  i always get a little bit puzzled as to why someone not living in sweden would care about this topic . 
  some facts about sweden : * in 2012 , sweden has the [ third highest gdp per person ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2014/01/european-economy-guide ) in europe . 
  the economy is growing and has been [ among the best ] ( http://imgur.com/fzqwgve ) in europe for a long time . 
  * sweden 's public finances are well managed , with one of the lowest public debts in europe . 
  sweden has in fact run a [ budget surplus for almost every year since 1998 . 
  ] ( http://www.economonitor.com/dolanecon/2011/07/31/how-smart-fiscal-rules-keep-swedens-budget-in-balance/ ) * in 2013 , the economist declared that the nordic countries `` are probably the best-governed in the world , '' with [ sweden in first place ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21570835-nordic-countries-are-probably-best-governed-world-secret-their ) * in 2012 , the world economic forum ranked sweden as the [ fourth-most competitive country in the world . 
  ] ( http://www.weforum.org/issues/global-competitiveness ) * in 2010 , sweden also had one of the lowest gini coefficients of all developed countries , making sweden [ one of the world 's most equal countries in terms of income . 
  ] ( http://hdr.undp.org/en/reports/global/hdr2010/chapters/ ) * [ public spending , as a percentage of the gdp , have also gone down since the 90s , facilitating lowered taxes . 
  ] ( http://www.economist.com/node/18805503 ) * the unemployment rate has [ consistently been below eu average 2001-2012 . 
  ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/images/2/20/unemployment_rate%2c_2001-2012_%28%25%29.png ) * sweden is the [ fifth happiest country in the world , ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2013/09/09/business/earth-institute-world-happiness-rankings/ ) according to columbia university 's earth institute . 
  is sweden perfect ?
