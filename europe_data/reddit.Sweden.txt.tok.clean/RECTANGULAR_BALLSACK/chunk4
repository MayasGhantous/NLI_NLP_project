  absolutely not , but we 're evidently doing just fine , as the figures and stats above show . 
  in general , sweden is an awesome place to live in , so maybe you people should stop worrying about us and think about what * you 're * doing wrong instead . 
  here 's my take on immigration : after the second world war , sweden became a land of immigration , with peaks happening in the early '70s , late '80s and middle '90s . 
  myself , i went to school with refugees from the balkans , and remember vividly all the anti-immigration sentiments that flourished among some parts of the population . 
  as it turned out , most people from the balkans are contributing to our economy just fine . 
  so although i can see the need to reduce the currently high immigration levels ( even though there are n't more asylum seekers arriving today than during the 90s ) , i do n't generally have much problem with immigration in itself . 
  it is a fact that we do need a net surplus in immigration , to take care of our aging population and to prevent labor shortages , if we want to maintain the same standard of living . 
  yeah , you 're not making much sense , got your facts wrong ... and certainly nothing of it is in any way related to this video , so maybe you should just not comment at all . 
   he does n't know why it is called the swedish solution , because it is not what they really did actually , [ we did nationalize the banks during the banking crisis in the '90s , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_banking_rescue ) which is why it 's called the swedish solution i guess , but the current government did n't do it during this latest round of banking fuck-ups ... 
  against what ? 
  rape and/or creepy behavior ? 
   everyone 's blaming each other for declining results . 
  the thing is that everyone * is * to blame for it . 
  the social democrats implemented the current system in the '90s , and the current cabinet have done little to change it , even though they 've had 8 years ... 
  unfortunately , the minister of education is one of the biggest idiots we 've ever had in office . 
  his modus operandi is talking a lot and doing nothing . 
  no wonder the liberals are hovering around the 4 % mark . 
  everything is relative , but our [ health-care ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/20131204/swedens-health-system-worst-in-the-nordics ) and [ school system ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/20131203/sweden-slides-in-global-education-rank-pisa-students-schools ) just is n't working very well , which recent international comparisons have confirmed . 
  my favorite from sweden is [ staffanstorp 's municipal arms ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/staffanstorps_kommunvapen ) , which has a lion with the head separated from the trunk . 
  for a pretty lame reason , apparently . 
  quoting wikipedia :  this has no deeper symbolic meaning . 
  heraldic coat of arms symbolizes the owner of the weapon , in this case the municipality , and the image does not have to mean more than the owner chooses to interpret into it . 
  * the lion is so common in heraldry that you often want to do some small change to be able to distinguish different coat or arms from each other , and here they simply separated the head from the body . 
  * it dates back to 1524 , fwiw . 
   130 prostitutes working in stockholm in a city with 2.1 m people , that number sounds like pr-bullshit to me . 
  the swedish law have been successful in curbing street prostitution , so maybe they are only counting that . 
  but i 'd say that around 80 % of all thai massage parlors in stockholm is a covert brothel . 
  there are about 260 of them [ according to this site ] ( http://www.thaimassageguiden.se/index.php?sobi2search=stockholm&amp;search=s%c3%b6k&amp;searchphrase=any&amp;option=com_sobi2&amp;sobicid=0&amp;sobi2task=search&amp;reset=2&amp;itemid=54 ) , that would mean 200 prostitutes alone -- if it was one person working there -- but most are usually staffed by on average 3 women , which would mean 600 prostitutes alone ... and that 's not counting all of the women who advertise their services online . 
  150 people on the extreme fringe are demonstrating , with no popular support whatsoever . 
  what a complete non-story ... 
  i went to school with a baron ( in an affluent part of the city that i grew up in ) . 
  he was a great friend of mine , and our families became friendly as well . 
  i 'm not going to mention his last name , but it 's one of the oldest and most well-known noble families in sweden . 
  anyway , his family was n't extremely rich , but they were definitely well off . 
  i did n't think of it much back then , as we were equals in school . 
  it was n't until later in life when i realized they did n't seem to have to work as hard to get ahead in life , as my family have had to . 
  having a well known family name apparently does wonders for your career . 
  ( not just thinking about my friend , but about his brother too . ), 
  also , it 's obvious to me now that they had inherited lots of nice properties all over sweden . 
  they had several summer houses , and there 's no way they could have bought all of that stuff from the relatively normal jobs they all had . 
  it 's strange , but people * still * give you the benefit of doubt , and treat you way better , * if * you come from a noble family in sweden . 
  i 'm not that well informed about the situation in canada , or the other countries cited in the article , but high house prices is in itself not an indication of a housing bubble , regardless of what most people seem to think . 
  if it 's expensive to build , coupled with a housing shortage and a high demand , prices will naturally go up . 
  that 's the current situation in sweden . 
  as long as the prices are n't artificially inflated by speculation , you ca n't automatically say there 's a housing bubble , just from looking at the house prices -- which is what many of these economists and sensationalist journalists appear to be doing . 
  various government agencies in sweden have studied the situation closely , and most have come to the same conclusion : there is no housing bubble . 
  studies show that most people can comfortably handle a price-drop in about 20 % and people are repaying their loans ; there 's also no indication people are overextending their loans . 
  it is in fact almost impossible to do that , due to a 2010 change in the law , which makes it illegal for the banks to grant loans at more than 85 % of the market value . 
  nevertheless , there are talks about implementing laws requiring people to amortize , to further reduce the risk of a housing bubble . 
  but what they need to do though is to make it easier and more inexpensive to build new homes ... that 's the main problem in sweden . 
  the problem is the school reform we had in the late 90 's , which privatized schools and implemented school vouchers , that pretty much guaranteed a completely corrupt system , with grade inflation and all . 
  there 's absolutely no incentive for the teachers and schools to teach , the whole system is geared towards keeping the pupils happy , and if that means handing out top grades to children who deserves an f -- so be it . 
  also , there are a lot of strange notions that have formed the curriculum , like kids are supposed to learn stuff on their own in groups , * without * their teacher -- which obviously does n't work either . 
  do n't get me wrong , i 'm not against free choice , but the way it 's done now , it just does n't work ... 
   first of all , check out [ this graph . 
  ] ( http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:anm%c3%a4lda_brott_1950-2005.svg ) that graph has been posted below . 
  so you might want to check out what 's already been said about it ... you 're looking at the number of * reported * crimes , which does n't tell the whole story ( as [ explained on br\u00c5 's website ] ( http://www.bra.se/bra/brott--statistik/brottsutvecklingen-i-sverige.html ) ) . 
  the increase in number of reported crimes can be explained by the fact that people 's wealth have increased , their propensity to report crime for insurance reasons have gone up , etc. . . 
  it 's true that the number of actual crime committed per capita has gone up since the 50 's , but not as dramatic as that graph might lead you to believe , and crime rates have actually stayed relatively even over the last decade , despite the fact that our population has increased . 
  you can actually see it on the graph that you posted , it ends at 2005 , and a decrease of total crimes starts at 2003 . 
  what exactly is your problem ? 
  first you post a misleading graph , and when someone corrects you , you strangely pull another graph out of your ass that * confirms * a fall in crime and simultaneously downplay it by saying , `` sweden 's no different than other countries . '', 
  actually , if you read the article , we are . 
  the re-offending rate is half of that in the uk and we are closing our prisons , you bloody jackass ... 
  but you 're looking at the number of * reported * crimes , which does n't tell the whole story . 
  the number of reported crimes will almost always increase as new laws are being passed , it 's also dependent people 's increased wealth , propensity to report crime ( for insurance reasons ) , etc. . . 
  it 's true that the number of actual crime committed per capita has gone up since the 50 's , but not as dramatic as that graph might lead you to believe , and crime rates have actually stayed relatively even over the last decade , despite the fact that our population has increased . 
  like the article says , i think us being able to close some prisons have been made possible by the fact that more criminals are sentenced to probation and with the increased use of electronic tagging . 
  what this will entail for the future is hard to say , but if it reduces the re-offending rate i 'm all for it . 
  seems like a great bushiness opportunity for f-secure then , or whoever ... 
  nothing is stopping these people to launch an alternative to dropbox today . 
  it 's just the press reporting on the latest statistics . 
  there 's been a widespread belief that immigrants have a harder time getting jobs , which apparently is n't true . 
  so nobody is saying this is a bad thing . 
  sweden is [ traditionally ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alcoholic_beverages_in_sweden ) included in the [ vodka belt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vodka_belt#vodka_belt ) ; not without merit , with internationally well known brands like [ absolut vodka ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/absolut_vodka ) and traditional spirits like [ akvavit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/akvavit ) ( locally known as [ `` br\u00e4nnvin '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/br%c3%a4nnvin ) ) , combined with the fact that swedish people were drinking tremendous amounts of vodka in the 1800s , which prompted stricter government regulations and the [ state run monopoly on the sales of alcoholic beverages . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/systembolaget ) the image of the binge-drinking swede is slowly changing though . 
  our drinking habits have changed , especially after we joined the european union in 1995 . 
  we started drinking cider in the 90 's , and today [ kopparbergs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kopparbergs_brewery ) and rekorderlig are sold in many other countries . 
  and the consumption of wine actually surpassed the total sales of spirits already back in the 70 's . 
  there 's even some popular swedish whiskey distilleries like [ mackmyra ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aik6gscgozk ) , that now produce over 1.8 m bottles of whiskey a year . 
  but we drink beer more than anything , like the rest of northern europe . 
  ( speaking of beer , there 's been an explosion of micro-breweries here recently , just like in northern america . ), 
  also , during this time of year we traditionally drink lots of christmas beers ( my favorite is nils oscar ) , akvavit and [ mulled wine called `` gl\u00f6gg '' . 
  i 'll give them a pass , considering the capital beijing and 9 of their top 10 biggest cities is in the right timezone . 
  argentina , on the other hand , has no part in the right timezone . 
  does anyone know why ? 
  i googled it , but have n't found an explanation . 
  argentina 's choice just does n't make any sense . 
  some of these scores are dubious , such as `` abortion rates '' . 
  sweden scores low , apparently because our abortion rates are high . 
  true , it may not be desirable using abortion as a form of contraceptive , but how does women more freely using the morning-after pill mean our health-care is in any way worse off because of it ? 
  something tells me the rankings would have been different if this organization was lead by a woman , instead of a man , who is a [ former conservative deputy mayor ] ( http://se.linkedin.com/pub/johan-hjertqvist/4/7a4/751 ) and member of a [ right-wing think tank ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/timbro ), 
  [ here 's the list . 
  ] ( http://www.standardandpoors.com/ratings/sovereigns/ratings-list/en/eu/?subsectorcode=39&amp;start=0&amp;range=50 ) the following european countries have the highest rating across-the-board : denmark , finland , germany , liechtenstein , luxembourg , norway , united kingdom , sweden and switzerland . 
  i have no idea why they would claim only germany and luxembourg score higher ... 
   mumble-mumble-mumble-fack-u-mann wait -- did he speak english ? 
  skill and qualifications do n't matter ? 
  so you 're saying that any old retard can study in the leading business schools and become business leaders ? 
  here 's a fun fact for you : 38 % of the students at sweden 's top business school are women . 
  is that because women are discriminated against in one of the world 's most gender equal countries in the world , or is it because women simply are n't as interested in business as men ?
