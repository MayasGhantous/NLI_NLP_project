  the reason why there 's not as many women in the boardrooms as men is simple : men like earning lots of money , they do n't get pregnant , and a lot of them are prepared to devote 100 % of their life to their job . 
  there 's a lot of businessmen that would * love * to see more women in the boardrooms , but the fact is that there are n't as many women out there prepared work as much as men , and that 's a fact that wo n't change even though you legislate against `` the glass ceiling '' , or whatever you may call it ... 
  legislating is stupid , imo . 
  getting young women more interested in business leadership , and providing free or affordable childcare makes more sense . 
  thanks . 
  it suddenly makes sense now . 
  this would explain the sense of exasperation i get from the title . 
  til you [ finns love your swastikas ] ( http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/fi_xfree.html ) so much you make delicious pastries out of them . 
  nice sensational title , but they are n't really * accusing * anyone , are they ? 
  they are * reporting * that some people in social media thought it looked like a swastika , which to be fair , it kind of does . 
  the general tone is one of amusement , if anything . 
  also , traditional to who ? 
  i 've never seen this type of pastry before ... 
  one way to counter them is to stop ignoring the people , and actually do what they want , which is halt or decrease immigration , but that 's apparently `` racist '' according to many social democrats and greens in europe . 
  realistically , in any election there 's always going to be two dominate parties even in a multi-party system . 
  the advantage is that the smaller parties can influence and change how the bigger ones govern , because they usually have to rely on them to get majority in parliament . 
  it 's also way easier for the public to abandon a party that have lost its appeal ( for whatever reason that may be , e.g. 
  a change in leadership or ideologies ) . 
  sure , for the last two decades the moderate and social democrats have been dominating , but things can change quickly in a multi-party system . 
  continuing using sweden as an example , we 've also had four governments lead by the center-party and the liberal party was the biggest `` conservative '' party for 30 years , between 1940 and 1970 . 
  and right now , our third biggest party ( according to recent opinion polls ) , the sweden democrats did n't even have a seat in parliament 4 years ago . 
  ok , so it takes 5,000 years to melt all that ice ... 
  but have they thought about the lift-up of land in the nordic region ? 
  the coastline has [ risen 300 meters since the ice age ended ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/sweden-the-land-of-the-rising-coastline-8373787.html ) 10,000 years ago in some parts of northern sweden . 
  that could mean a net gain of 85 meters in 5,000 years , even if the sea level is rising 65 meters . 
  does n't look like that map is taking this into account . 
  if you think that 's uninspired , you should see their party symbol , which looks like the westinghouse logo ... 
  similar suggestions have been made by members from the moderate party , so it 's not only the `` far-right '' sweden democrats ( sd ) that supports this . 
  but i do n't think it will be passed as a law , since we have to many bleeding-heart leftists in this country that does n't want to risk being associated with the sd . 
  a couple of years ago i too would have balked at the idea , but not today . 
  these people are professional beggars bussed to sweden during the summer ( from other european countries , that shall remain nameless ) , and they destroy the image of this country for tourists , thinking we 've got some kind of problem with poverty over here , when in fact no one in sweden needs to beg to survive . 
  i 've always liked [ thor heyerdahl 's english ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxpecr4ox34 ), 
  i 've always felt dutch sounds like the perfect mix between scandinavian and english . 
  i bet that i could learn it well enough to understand most of it after only a couple of months or so . 
  what a great idea !, 
  letting a bunch of bureaucrats do our spying for us in brussels , even further away from prying eyes , especially considering how transparent and well run the eu is ... this solves so many problems . 
  these federalists needs to get their heads out of their asses . 
  this is not so much about technical prowess , it 's a choice that several other countries also could have done , but have n't for many reasons . 
  electronic identification schemes are easy to implement , and they work fairly well in many countries . 
  most of us probably already use something like it when we do our banking at home , and it would n't be that hard to modify it to allow for e-voting . 
  it 's pretty obvious that estonia wants to market itself as a leading it-nation , which is fine i guess , and that 's probably why they have implemented e-voting so early ; but i personally do n't see many advantages to it . 
  in fact , what i do see is a number of disadvantages and problems you 'd have to overcome in order for me to trust it : * all of the numerous it-related security issues * other technical problems , such as timed-out internet connections or power failures * in elections held by secret ballot , e-voting is making anonymity difficult to guarantee * difficult or impossible to verify the identity of a voter remotely * difficult or impossible to do an election recount without paper ballots * difficult or impossible for independent election observers to monitor the election process * coercion and manipulation of voters made easier and impossible to spot when remote e-voting is allowed ( i.e. 
  if people do n't have to visit a polling station anymore ) people often like e-voting because it 's convenient , but rarely think about all of these issues . 
  this is probably why sweden will go ahead and test remote e-voting in a limited number of counties in the next election , even though none of the above problems have been properly addressed or fixed yet . 
  the question is : have the estonian government managed to solve all of these problems adequately ? 
  or maybe they do n't care and have gone ahead anyway , like the swedish government appears to be doing ? 
  no , i 'm saying they * are * most likely using supercomputers to analyze all traffic coming in and out of sweden already . 
  that 's why it * needs * to be warrantless , since you could n't possibly ask for a warrant to read each email , instant message , telephone call , etc. . .   and see all of his communications ( dating back several months ) , possibly leading to further arrests ? 
   there are plenty of other ways to do this . 
  laws could require data retention by telecoms that require a court order to retrieve . 
  but a while ago you argued against collecting everyone 's information , and if law enforcement needs to act quickly , there might not be any time for warrants . 
    if the swedish military intelligence had no reason to monitor your grandma before this law , it probably has no interest doing so now either . 
  implying that they are is fictitious and frankly over the top silly ...  its not that they are , its that they could . 
  i find it incredibly troubling the legal framework exists in any country that allows this type of monitoring without much legal oversight . 
  the swedish police also carry service pistols . 
  they * could * kill innocent people , but very seldom do , and if they did there are legal repercussions . 
  same thing here . 
  as long as this new tool is not abused and is handled responsibly , i see no problem with it . 
  then let 's pretend there 's another suicide bombing in europe today . 
  this guy somehow avoided the intelligence community radar , and they * did n't * have him on their watchlists . 
  would n't it be a good thing to be able to go back look at who that person is , and see all of his communications ( dating back several months ) , possibly leading to further arrests ? 
  i do n't agree with you that simply collecting information is a bad thing ; as long as that information is not abused , and is handled responsibly . 
  if you look at it objectively , it 's simply just another tool for law enforcement to stop crime , and i 've yet to find any proof or indication that it has been misused in sweden . 
  in sweden , this law was [ most likely put in place to facilitate automated monitoring , done by supercomputers ] ( http://nicolaiwadstrom.com/blog/2007/06/07/sweden-gets-second-most-powerful-super-computer-for-surveillance/ ) listening for trigger phrases and or suspicious behavior patterns . 
  monitoring all calls without any kind of filtering would an be extreme waste of time and resources . 
  if the swedish military intelligence had no reason to monitor your grandma before this law , it probably has no interest doing so now either . 
  implying that they are is fictitious and frankly over the top silly ... 
  eh , in what way have they been abusing it ? 
  i do n't think its fair to call it `` abuse '' , if they are following the law -- which they have , if i have n't missed something ... 
  the original law proposal in sweden openly said , `` warrantless wiretapping of all telephone and internet traffic that crosses sweden 's borders is permissible '' , only traffic * within * sweden would be exempt . 
  this was highly debated at the time it was proposed , and we even had elections in-between . 
  one thing is sure : any swede acting surprised about this is either a posturing fool or a naive dumbass . 
  personally , i think they did the right call . 
  we 're having a lot of problems with muslim extremists in europe , and this is probably needed to stop acts of terrorism , like the [ 2010 stockholm bombings . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_stockholm_bombings ), 
  oh , this is in `` violation of international law '' is it ? 
  he did n't seem to care that much about the law when he stole the personal records of over 10 000 swedes , and tried to empty the bank accounts of those people . 
  what a fucking jackass . 
  it 's part of the copenhagen region https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/capital_region_of_denmark, 
  i hear you . 
  in a country that often gets mixed up with another county that starts with an `` s '' , i figure this would be a silly thing to get worked up about ...
