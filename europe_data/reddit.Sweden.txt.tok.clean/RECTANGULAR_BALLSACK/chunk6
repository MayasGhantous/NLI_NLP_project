  if you 're a `` foodie '' and love meat especially , i would recommend [ restaurant ag ] ( http://www.restaurangag.se/ ) in stockholm . 
  it was at one point as secret as can be , with no sings on the street whatsoever . 
  fuck the nsa , man !, 
  why ca n't they just build rockets like they used to ? 
  what you do n't seem to get is that apanage covers * everything * . 
  that 's not only the queens `` living wage . '', 
  far from it !, 
  it covers maintenance of all buildings , administration , travel expenses and representation on state visits , etc. 
  you 're also overlooking the fact that denmark is in fact a democracy , and that the danish people can reduce the apanage , if they so wish . 
  but they do n't think it 's `` a bit much '' , and that 's what matters -- not what * you * think , or some bureaucrat in the eu . 
  come to think of it , i think it 's very * arrogant * of you , or anyone else not danish , telling them their form of government is somehow the wrong form of government . 
  if anything , from what i can tell , it seems to be working very well . 
  denmark has a hdi-value and gdp per capita that is among the highest in the world -- higher than that of the usa . 
  fascinating . 
  i wonder how one becomes like you ... something must have gone terribly wrong . 
  you 're not very self-aware , are you ? 
  the palaces would n't magically go away if denmark became a republic . 
  you do know that , right ? 
  they would still have to be maintained by the danish government , and i would assume that any president would have go and live there instead , just as lavishly as the monarch . 
  most modern monarchs in europe have a pretty busy schedule , and are doing actual work for the state , just like any president would . 
  edit : what 's up with the insults ? 
  i suppose you 're mad because i 'm making you look like a fool here ... ? 
  i do n't think you could be more of an ass even if you tried ... and i do n't think you can be more daft either . 
  my point is this : even if someone answered your question , you would still only have * one * part of the equation . 
  unless you * know * how much the danish government would spend on maintaining a presidency you ca n't possibly make a judgement about cost-efficiency , or know if it would be an economic advantage to abandon monarchy . 
  you would still just assume shit . 
  it could go either way , and that 's why any discussion about cost is not relevant in a debate about monarchy as a form of government . 
   i presume a parliamentary constitutional republic is the cheapest . 
  but it 's still a * presumption * , is n't it ? 
  feel free to back your statements up with actual facts , showing us that a republican form of government is cheaper than a monarchy , mr. 
  political science . 
  until you do that , you 're nothing but a presumptuous blowhard . 
  but what are you saying ? 
  is obama , and his administration working for free ? 
  your question is not very relevant . 
  with it you 're inferring that maintaining a republic is somehow cheaper , and there 's nothing supporting that assumption . 
  you could actually argue that monarchy is more cost-effective when compared to the expense of maintaining a presidency . 
  what 's the cost of maintaining a republic ? 
  here are the prices in euro , without vat : s - 73,08 ( 25 % ) dk - 50,18 ( 25 % ) fin - 68,32 ( 24 % ) n/b - 63,16 ( 21 % ) a - 63,96 ( 20 % ) d - 56.65 ( 19 % ) maybe it 's just marketed differently , and sold in more upscale stores in sweden , and sometimes domestic brands are sold cheaper at home than abroad ( due to logistics and transport ) . 
  so it might be a danish brand ? 
  this is hardly going to destabilize the eu . 
  right now , i 'd say corruption is a bigger problem in eastern europe , and we would n't be in the problems we are in today if pigs had managed their economies as well as the baltic states are managing theirs . 
  i really do n't see what the big deal is here . 
  like it says in the article , they are still going to have talks about prism and data privacy . 
  beyond that , i really do n't think the eu has any business talking about matters relating to national security and intelligence gathering , especially since they would n't fully know what the individual member-states are up to . 
  i curious to know : why would * anyone * think that would be a good idea ? 
  do we want to expose our own secrets , and the secrets of our neighbors and allies ? 
  and if you think it 's a good idea , i suppose you 're in favor of letting the eu run our intelligence gathering and defense too ? 
  because that would be the only logical conclusion if you support `` spy talks '' on the eu level ... 
  care to give us some actual details then , instead of obnoxious and puerile troll-bait such as `` swedish sounds dumb and the buildings are boring '' and '' [ danish ] history is cooler '' ... ? 
  btw , why have you deleted your comment history ? 
  do you have something to hide ? 
  no , but you would have to visit stockholm to `` get '' it , something i doubt you 've ever done . 
  if you ca n't have fun in stockholm and had a miserable time , i would have to assume that you are a very miserable person ... 
  just a word of caution , this subreddit is somewhat plagued by right-wing extremists , and so lot of the criticism against stockholm has to be seen in that light , as it is the most cosmopolitan city of the two , and sweden is quite frequently slandered as a country full of immigrant-loving feminazis in here . 
  with that out of the way , as a person currently living in stockholm , and having had visited copenhagen several times , i ca n't really say that any one city is better than the other -- as both cities are great . 
  be sure to visit during the summer though , and i would especially recommend a trip in the [ stockholm archipelago ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9htgonmcjwg ) , and a [ visit to the old town ] ( http://youtu.be/ugedieadszw?t=3m35s ) . 
   typical feminized swede suffering from white guilt and whining about racism and this comment comes from someone who calls black people [ `` niggers '' ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1hbhs2/til_a_teenager_who_couldnt_swim_was_drowning_so_5/cat3kil ) and likens them to [ `` chimps '' ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1hbhs2/til_a_teenager_who_couldnt_swim_was_drowning_so_5/cat3phv ) . 
   this is not a good way how to persuade people that your country is great . 
  do n't worry , we do n't want your racist ass here anyway ... 
   computers have to pay television license in other news , computers have become self-aware in sweden . 
  i love how the feminists in this country are insisting that everyone should use gender-neutral pronouns ... \u0ca0_\u0ca0, 
  yeah , it 's pretty cool that they use [ snowmobiles in some places . 
  ] ( http://goo.gl/maps/cuqwl ) no one can complain about privacy issues over there , i guess . 
  at the same time , you 've got to wonder about how useful it is . 
  that 's the most important part for me . 
  i 'd rather not have another elected official , with all the bickering and conflict that comes with it . 
  it 's also part of our history and tradition . 
  sweden have had a monarch in one way or other since the very beginning , all the way back to the viking era . 
  the monarch might not matter that much now , effectively only acting as symbols , but in times of war all of that become more important . 
  i see no advantages of ending it . 
  as expected . 
  we allready knew you greeks just do as you wish anyway ... 
  sweden is on top in both of these . 
  obviously , the world would be a better place if everyone was a swede ... this would explain our generous immigration policies . 
  i bet it 's the bbc 's top gear budget cocking up things for you . 
  these fucking banks . 
  this has been a problem since the '90s . 
  at this point , it 's hard to name any country that * has n't * been struck by bank lending or speculation spiraling out of control . 
  laissez-faire banking obviously does n't work , we have ample empirical evidence of this now , and we need stronger regulations on banks world wide . 
  you 're overlooking the fact that the russian government is very corrupt , and its politicians are n't necessarily always doing what 's best for the majority of russians . 
  yes , everyone hates greece !, 
  including the [ american journalist ] ( https://twitter.com/angeloyoung_/status/315289435925250048 ) that made this info-graphic . 
  it 's all a big conspiracy !, 
  ( \u256f \u00b0 \u25a1 \u00b0 \uff09 \u256f \u253b \u2501 \u253b \u2533 \u2501 \u2533 ^ do n't ^ let ^ the ^ fact ^ that ^ it ^ could ^ have ^ been ^ an ^ honest ^ mistake ^ ruin ^ your ^ crazed ^ narrative . 
  i see some schadenfreude in here , but it was mostly tongue in cheek ... 
  the greek situation is not unique though . 
  both sweden and germany have gone through crises as well . 
  estonia have recently gone though one . 
  afaik neither one of us * demanded * to be rescued by some other european country , and put the blame on someone else , like they are doing . 
  i kind of agree . 
  i ca n't say that was a wise move either . 
  it 's absolutely important to keep an eye on this , but i do n't think there 's any reason to throw a party celebrating sweden 's demise just yet . 
  some economists have been warning about this supposed housing bubble for a quite a while now . 
  as a response to these concerns , the government put a cap on how much a household could lend back in 2010 . 
  ( like it says in the article . ), 
  and nothing has happened . 
  the prices have been relatively stable , and it seems they are pretty much just a product of supply and demand . 
  there 's no speculating going on . 
  there 's just a shortage of housing , especially in metropolitan stockholm .
