  if you look at mortgages in relation to disposable income then sweden 's still only about half of , for example , denmark 's level . 
  there was also decreased levels of lending last year . 
  yes , the levels have been increasing lately , but at a [ very slow pace . 
  ] ( http://www.di.se/artiklar/2013/3/18/svenskarna-lanar-i-langsam-takt/ ) public finances are good , and sweden 's economy is predicted to grow 1.2 percent this year despite the problems in southern europe . 
  even if the prices do fall the macroeconomic effects will most likely be small . 
  of natural causes ? 
  sure . 
  that would be great . 
  he 's an old man . 
  he 'll die soon enough ... 
  you 're right about that . 
  insulting the germans like that is not very productive , and will only cause detriment to the cypriot and greek economies of the future . 
  but maybe we should n't expect anything less , they are after all adept in the art of doing their future economies a disservice . 
  fuck you too , buddy . 
  honestly , you sound like a crazed conspiracy theorist . 
  but i 'm going to reply anyway . 
  i can understand that people are pissed off , but blaming the eu and the germans is wrong , to say the least . 
  painting a hitler mustache on merkel 's face ? 
  that * is * disgraceful . 
  the eu have slashed greece 's debt by more than $ 40 bn , and given you about $ 130 bn in bailout money and aid , just recently . 
  throughout the years - for several decades even - you have received several billions of euros in regional aid , and benefited immensely from the increased trade . 
  greece have never been a net contributor as far as i know , unlike germany . 
  they have always shelled out money to you !, 
  but your politicians have squandered it all , and you people did nothing about it . 
  tell me again how that is any of * our * fault ? 
  your politicians fucked up , man . 
  how about blaming your own damned politicians for once , and start taking some responsibility for yourself ? 
  the people holding these placards should be ashamed of themselves . 
  i bet none of them complained before the bubble burst , and now when their economy is in tatters they want to put the blame on germany and the eu taxpayers up north . 
  or worse , in greece , the feeble immigrants . 
  the lack responsibility and the audacity of the greeks and cypriots have been nothing short of astounding to watch . 
  greece leaving the eu ? 
  honestly , at this point : good riddance !, 
  i hope your wish come true . 
  strange how none of you complained before the bubble burst ... we 've had `` wealth transfers '' for * decades * . 
  greece have benefited immensely throughout the years . 
  not just with increased trade , but direct investment and projects funded by the eu . 
  greece have never been a net contributor afaik ? 
  and during this crisis alone the eu have slashed greece 's debt by more than $ 40 bn , and given you about $ 130 bn in bailout money and aid . 
  not to mention the imf loans of more than $ 240 bn . 
  you might not like it , but the problem lies not with the eu or germany . 
  you have failed managing your economies , and now you 're trying to pin the responsibility of the cleanup on the taxpayers up north . 
  and you ca n't honestly think that it 's our responsibility to fix your corruption as well ? 
  the lack responsibility on your part and the audacity is astounding . 
  but the monetary union is n't working very well , is it ? 
  sweden is smart for staying out , imo . 
  you might think it 's dickish , but still ... it 's the smart move to make . 
  and regarding `` slapping sweden on the wrist '' : yeah , good luck with that . 
  that will not swing the popular opinion of the euro in a more positive direction , and since we now have the option of leaving the eu altogether you 'd just risk loosing a net contributor . 
  you 're better off leaving it be , and this is something the commission is well aware of . 
  if you want sweden to adopt the euro , listen to the germans and finns and reform the euro to prevent future calmaties , like the ones piigs has caused . 
  what the hell are you talking about ? 
  `` harsh conditions ? '', 
  sounds familiar . 
  why are n't the cypriots out on the streets waving signs of stalin and shouting `` to hell with putin '' then ? 
  i can imagine . 
  this blame game by the cypriots and greeks have been quite pathetic . 
  i ca n't wait for murdoch to die . 
  he 's been hurting the entire world with his neocon politics for far too long now . 
  in what way have the eu `` taken advantage of the situation '' ? 
  greece 's economy is not in the top quarter . 
  it 's squarely in the [ middle of the eu ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_the_european_union#economic_variation ) , and even if you look at gdp per capita , which is pretty irrelevant to this discussion , it 's still in the [ lower half of the whole of europe ] ( http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/eco_eur_cou_by_gdp_per_cap_gdp_per_cap-european-countries-gdp-per-capita ) , including russia . 
  cyprus is even smaller . 
  i would n't expect anything less from medvedev since russia has a strategic interest in keeping the eu weak . 
  you 'd be better off in one of the baltic states . 
  they have better infrastructure , less corruption , are members in the eu and also have a relatively low flat tax . 
  why is it a finnish company again ? 
  it 's based in switzerland , founded and run by timchenko , a russian with finnish citizenship ; and t\u00f6rnqvist , a swede . 
  from what i 've read the company is entirely based in switzerland , almost all of the assets are in russia ( some in estonia ) and some tax havens like lichtenstein and bahamas are also mentioned . 
  nothing about finland though . 
  thus making the argentinians look even more retarded . 
  i did n't think it was possible . 
  you have to keep in mind that many of the companies that invest in r&d today were also founded several decades ago , some even a hundred years ago . 
  so it 's really not that surprising that norway is far down , because it was a part of sweden during the industrial revolution . 
  it has never had the same strong industrial and engineering tradition that can be found in swedish or finnish universities and companies . 
  the stats are from 2005 . 
  he killed * one * person in the '90s . 
  and what `` pals '' are you referring to ? 
  probably not , but there was never a `` killing spree against immigrants '' in 2005 that could have `` skewed the stats '' as claimed . 
  white hate crime against immigrants is hardly existent in sweden . 
  in fact , if there ever was a problem with hate crime in sweden , then anti-semitic and homophobic hate crime by immigrants is just as much of a problem as islamophobic attacks . 
  get a clue , will you ? 
  his first shooting was in 2009 . 
  the stats are from 2005 only . 
  you 're talking out of your ass . 
  but suicide is generally not considered as a homicide . 
  stats from just one year can be very misleading . 
  i wonder why the homicide rate is relatively high in south eastern sweden , for example . 
  i know there 's a suspected serial killer on the loose there , with the first murders happening in 2005 . 
  it 's certainly newsworthy if you work in the it-industry , and especially so for a norwegian it paper , but maybe not something i 'd post in / r/europe, 
   only country where the clouds are interesting [ the stranglers - sweden ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btjviqcplyg ), 
  [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6fupq-294 ) will always be * my * personal favorite french anthem, 
  one obvious choice would be [ ulf lundell 's '' \u00d6ppna landskap '' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbvngv5cz-k ) ( english translation ), 
  that would be fine , if that was what really was going on . 
  but it 's not , just like the reporter says . 
  in hungary , greece , ireland and malta you do n't need to invest in actual companies , according to a group of [ baltic investigating journalists . 
  ] ( http://www.dn.se/ekonomi/rika-ryssar-koper-gyllene-visum-i-vasteuropa/ ) in these countries buying state treasury bonds count as a form of investment , and in malta ( and some other countries ) you can get away with buying just some real-estate . 
  malta is also one of the [ most corrupt countries in europe . 
  ] ( http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2014-12-22/local-news/malta-moves-up-two-ranks-in-corruption-perception-index-despite-obtaining-slightly-lower-score-6736127752 ) that 's not a good combination , if we want to keep people with a criminal record out of the schengen area . 
  you mention belgium as another example , but neglect to say that you also need to form a company and provide employment to gain citizenship there -- which again is n't the case in malta .
