they 're pretty much complaining about shit we deal with on a daily basis . 
  `` we can walk a kilometer now with a bit of rain , but what about when it snows ? '', 
  you walk mate . 
  like everybody else does . 
  i do n't know how our goverment are planning to deal with this . 
  i can only dream that they 'll just tell 'em something like : `` this is shit we deal with . 
  if you want to stay here you 'll have to deal with it as well . 
  be happy it 's only 1km '' but they 'll likely just get on their knees and beg them not to become upset . 
  ... god i hope our goverment grows a fucking spine already . 
  not sure how nato works exactly , but i would n't be suprised if you need to maintan a certain level of military to be allowed in nato . 
  if that is more or less than we 're doing right now though i have no clue . 
  sd is not sane imo . 
  they hardly know anything about politics and high schoolers would do a better job at running a country ( and i 'm not exaggerating one bit ) . 
  one example was when the party leader jimmie \u00c5kersson wanted to reduce the tax on the really big banks in sweden so the ceos will earn billions more . 
  when one of our left leaning parties challenged that he could n't defend his claim as to why they want to do that . 
  i 'm going to do a rough translation of how the last bit of the debate went down :  jonas sj\u00f6stedt ( the left party ) : you portray your party as one that prioritize the elders , schools and health care . 
  but when it comes down to allocating the big lumps of money you choose the big banks , [ insert list of said banks here ] , and that 's hypocrisy . 
  how does this help the economy ? 
  how many extra jobs does jimmie \u00c5kersson ( they always refer to each other in third person ) estimate this extra money to the banks is going to generate ? 
  and as a response :  jimmie \u00c5kesson ( sd ) : i do n't get it . 
  that 's a strange comparison . 
  should one vote against everything that benefits banks , just because it 's a bank ? 
  even if it 's beneficial in several other ways ( does n't mention a single one ) , you 're not allowed to vote for something that benefits a bank ? 
  because this is what jonas sj\u00f6stedt is saying , and i mean he 's allowed to think that , but i do n't think that . 
  sd is pretty much the only party that dares to bring up the immigration question , and that is good . 
  there 's a definite problem there but nobody is discussing it so sd forces that discussion . 
  they do n't display any signs of being capable of leading a country . 
  they ca n't even convert currency correctly for pete 's sake ... maybe there 's bit of much of my own opinion in here , but the quotes are legit and it 's not the first time they 've done stuff like that . 
  that 's an airsoft gun btw, 
  i second this . 
  i 've only ever been in the blue-grey zones according to the map , but this is n't too far off from what i 've experienced so i can see something like this possible in the black zones . 
  i think just this year we got a hotline specifically for men that have been raped . 
  something that pretty much no other country have , and something , globally , a lot of countries claim is impossible ( males being raped that is ), 
  heavy drinking late into the night does n't go away by morning . 
  if i recall correctly : most drunk drivers are caught on monday mornings . 
  i would n't use the swedish church at least as a source . 
  anyone born before 96 ( somewhere between 96-99 at least ) were automatically included in the church . 
  since then , this has been removed , but pretty much every single person over the age of 18 is a member of the church . 
  leaving the church is just a huge hassle so no one bothers . 
  the number does n't reflect how many actually are religious . 
  bring it tough guy !, 
   muslim women have no choice but to wear face coverings in a country like switzerland i highly disagree . 
  the koran tells women to put on a type of veil `` to cover all that is not apparent '' . 
  stuff like burqas are n't technically mentioned . 
  frankly , a lot of shit in islam is straight up illegal and should not be tollerated , but for some reason is because `` religion '' . 
  been planing to . 
  i 'm not 100 % qualified for signing up yet but i 'm working on it . 
  they were n't fucking kidding when he said they were at war . 
  all i 've been hearing on the news all week is new raids and attacks in and around paris . 
  wish i could be boots on ground and help them . 
  ^ ^ gign ^ ^ that ^ ^ is ... ^ ^ not ^ ^ the ^ ^ dilly ^ ^ dallying ^ ^ cunts ^ ^ that ^ ^ have ^ ^ a ^ ^ fetish ^ ^ from ^ ^ removing ^ ^ their ^ ^ legs ^ ^ for ^ ^ their ^ ^ body . 
  speak for yourself !, 
  have you ever played dota or cs : go in europe ? 
  yeah , number 7 has style . 
  makes it feel important . 
  this reminds me of the old log driving that we had right where i live . 
  if i 'm not mistaken it was probably the biggest in the world at the time it the mills around here were in use . 
  it 's the oldest log-driving river in sweden at least . 
  from googling i found [ this picture ] ( http://www.arkivcentrumnord.se/skogensarkiv/bilder_lff/01_1024.jpg ) which is a pretty good representation of how it used to look like . 
  it was n't uncommon for the river to be so filled with logs you could walk across it . 
  i 'll have to pay a visit to my grandparents . 
  they 're sure to have more photos than google can produce . 
  so yeah , sitation 1 . then . 
  that 'll in turn give sd ( the swedish democrats ) more votes . 
  although they are the only ones who dare bring up the migration question , i fear everything else they want to change . 
  they are quite far right and want to remove taxes on big billion dollar companies and such . 
  for being the `` swedish party '' their politics have quite the american traits . 
  meanwhile , we 're gon na put them in tents since we literally have no other place to put them . 
  i 'm just waiting for the political catastrophy that is coming when the heating in one tent stops working and 20-30 people die from hypothermia . 
  i foresee this causing one of two things : 1 . 
  swedish people will be put on an even lower priority for housing . 
  students especially will be affected . 
  we 'll have to stop taking in more refugees . 
  we 'll pull through . 
  we always have . 
  `` percentage believing in god '' sweden : 50 % no . 
  not even with the current immigration politic . 
  the problem is our society is built around exactly that . 
  asking for help . 
  people lose their jobs and might not be able to pay their bills , so we have unemployment benefits . 
  shit , you could be a crack whore and you 'll be able to get all the help you 'll need to get back on your feet . 
  free rehab and minimum living `` salary '' . 
  no situation will leave you so helpless that you * have to * beg here . 
  that is for swedish citizens at least . 
  although i do believe helping others is the right thing to do , letting romanians beg on our streets certainly is n't helping anyone . 
  they might get food for the day , but ultimately it 's not going to solve the reason they have to be out on the streets in the first place . 
  banning begging is n't stopping people from getting help . 
  it 's rather forcing them to actually seek help . 
  needless to say , i do not believe in charity . 
  and do n't even get me started on the whole ** business ** behind much of the begging . 
  it 's just been proposed . 
  nothing really being voted on or anything , at least not yet . 
  the whole idea here is that our social security is ( should be ) strong enough that * no one * has to sit on the streets and beg . 
  no citizen of this country * have * to beg . 
  from what i understand , most people feel sorry for them and such , but at the same time does n't really want them around . 
  there are talks of banning begging now . 
  seems like people are tired of them . 
  wow ... that `` can not into nordic '' joke just got a bit too real for me . 
  then it would be mirrored , not upside down . 
  flags usually have 2 holes on one side ( italy 's flag would have them on the green side ) with which you attach the rope the raise the flag with .
