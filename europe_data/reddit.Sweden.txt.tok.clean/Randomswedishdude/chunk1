they 're much more effective than boiling water on the stove since the heating element is placed * in * the water . 
  less energy go to waste as you heat * just * the water , and neither the pot nor the stove itself . 
  if you only boil water for tea once every third month , then yes ... in that case it would be wasteful to get a kettle . 
  but if it 's something that 's part of your daily routine ( at multiple occasions ) , then it 's the opposite of wasteful . 
  it 's like the american mentality of having a huge gas guzzling pick-up truck . 
  `` it 's versatile , and you can use it for many things '' ... sure if you 're hauling lumber or furniture like you perhaps do every sixth month or so , then it 's useful . 
  but it 's at the same time wasteful to use it for simpler tasks , like morning commute where you could use a smaller and more economic car ... or even a bike or moped . 
  why would you want to heat up the energy inefficient stove * just * for boiling teawater , when it 's also * slower * than an electric kettle ? 
  it 's also useful while cooking , as it brings water to a boil much faster . 
  i usually turn on the stove and put a pot with just a few cm of water in it , and then turn on the kettle at the side . 
  just as the minuscule amount of water in the pot is about to simmer , the kettle is done , and i can pour the already boiling hot water into the pot ... and then throw in the pasta , or whatever . 
  clicked `` show images '' ( res-feature ) and scrolled down the thread . 
  after a few images i just pressed page down a few times , and randomly stopped at [ this ] ( http://www.silodam.org/silodam.nl/gx/zmoqecejc.jpeg ) image . 
  though to myself `` this just * has * to be the damn potsmoking dutch '' , and lo and behold !, 
  i like it though . 
  i * despise * the functionalism architecture norm here in sweden . 
  mostly bland concrete boxes everywhere . 
  yes ... 
  there are beaches even in norway . 
  not anymore ... 
  but while an old name for sweden was * svitjod/sv \u00ed\u00fej\u00f3\u00f0 * ( * sw\u0113o\u00f0\u0113od * in old english ) , *** greater *** * sv\u00ed\u00fej\u00f3\u00f0 * usually refered to the area encompassing a large part of today 's russia and the baltic states , around * holmg\u00e5rd * ( novgorod ) . 
  also , greater sweden could also refer to the swedish empire in the mid/late 1600s - early 1700s . 
  it 's not something you have to think about in your daily life , * unless you have your own firm * ... or is about to sell real estate or large amounts of shares . 
  everything else is done pretty much automatically . 
  your employer will take care of calculating and paying all you income taxes , and all sales tax is included in the price tags . 
  -- when filing your taxes , [ you get a form with pre-filled numbers ] ( http://media.24files.se/24kalmar/uploads/2015/05/deklaration-2015-pappersblanketten-e1483882252164-1024x540.jpg ) of all ( most of ) your income ( s ) , loans and interests , shareholding information , total income tax paid ( by your employer ) , etc. 
  ... and a calculation whether `` you '' have paid too much or too little , and how much you 're expected to get in return ( or have to pay in back taxes ) . 
  if everything seem reasonable , you just login to the tax authorities website and sign `` ok '' with your e-id . 
  ... or sign `` ok '' with a mobile text message , using confirmation codes on the form . 
  there are of course some cases where you can file for tax deduction ... one typical example is expenses for work-related travels ( if the total sum is over a certain threshold ) , or if you 've done some major renovations of your home . 
  in case you 're correcting some minor error in the pre-filled information , have some minor deductions to file , or have anything to add , you just enter the numbers in the form on-line before signing it ... 
  if there are major changes or deductions to do , then you will still have to snail-mail it in together with copies of receipts and relevant attachment forms ... for * most * people it 's just a quick glance at the numbers , a slight nod , signing `` ok '' , and then update your facebook-status with some meaningless comment ... [ like for example quoting friar tuck from disney 's robin hood ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3fl8buaf7a ), 
  some places in sweden would be impossible , or very unlikely , to be pronounced right even by swedes . 
  let 's say for example ... [ you know what , i wont even try ] ( http://obj.fotosidan.se/obj/docpart/7f/7f2030ca362d5918e702b64294575188.jpg ), 
  there are a few regional flags that you see now and then . 
  [ scania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_scania ) - the `` totally not swedes and yet not either half-danes '' . 
  a region with a lot of local patriotism . 
  [ the republic of j\u00e4mtland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_the_republic_of_jamtland ) - a region squeezed between sweden and norway , and has changed ownership back and forth numerous times over the centuries . 
  a lot of * tongue-in-cheek * local patriotism there , with serious undertones which originated in discontent with the concentration of power to the stockholm region . 
  [ s\u00e1pmi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sami_flag ) - the indigenous peoples of northernmost fenno-scandia ... together with the [ tornedalians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tornedalians ) on the western side of the swedish/finnish border . 
  finns who have a lot in common in mentality with both j\u00e4mtland and scania . 
  -- there are also a few unofficial cross-flags for a few regions and provinces . 
  some more frequently used than others . 
  as well as various flags with the official heraldic shields both counties and municipalities . 
  * besides swedish , ** english ** is mandatory from 1st grade ( i * think * ) . 
  it was from 4th grade in my days . 
  * in the northern region : a few optional courses of ** finnish ** or * north sami * in elementary school , * if * it 's a language that 's spoken in your family . 
  ( finnish is very common . 
  sami , not so much . ), 
  * from 7th grade ( maybe earlier nowadays ) you get to choose a 3rd and/or 4th language . 
  the choice used to stand between ** german ** or ** french ** . 
  ** spanish ** also gained popularity a few decades ago , and is tied in popularity with german and french today , but i do n't know if it 's yet available in * every * town . 
  some rare few schools offer more options , and there have been some discussions lately about offering more languages nationwide , like for example mandarin and japanese , but the biggest obstacle is of course availability of teachers . 
  -- * ^ ( 1st and 2nd generation immigrants are usually also offered to study a few courses of their native language in elementary school , depending on municipal school budget and local availability of teachers in that language . 
  turkish , kurdish , serbian , croatian , arabic , farsi , etc. . . ) -- in secondary school , you often get more options ... 
  but it also varies * greatly * depending on school . 
  a quarter northern , a quarter western ... and half of britons act like you 're an isolated island in the ocean , completely separated from the rest of europe . 
  meanwhile , telia in sweden want [ $ 34 for unlimited calls/sms and ** 6 ** gb of surf ... or $ 44 for 20gb of surf . 
  ] ( https://www.telia.se/privat/telefoni/abonnemang-kontantkort/produkt/mobilabonnemang ) ^ ( the exchange rate between sek and eur is * roughly * 10 < -  1 ) i pay ~ $ 31 for unlimited calls/sms and 15gb of surf , with dual sim-cards ( split between phone and usb-dongle ) ... and that 's a pretty * good * deal . 
  as a matter of fact , we did ... * numerous * times , between pre-history and the 18th century . 
  although for the majority of that time window , ukraine did n't exist yet ( and neither did sweden ) . 
  but legends also say that it was scandinavian vangarians ( = vikings ) that * founded * the kingdom ( s ) that were the predecessors of today 's ukraine , russia and belarus ... back in the mid-800s , more than a century before \u00d3lafr skotkonungr ( olof sk\u00f6tkonung ) 's time . 
  interestingly enough , blue and yellow has been common colors for the ruling dynasties in what today is ukraine for at least as long as it has in sweden ... but that 's probably just a coincident . 
  in terms of following professional leagues , definitely ice hockey . 
  however ... 
  in terms of active players , it 's [ floorball ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/floorball ) ( * innebandy * ) . 
  does danny wallace count ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/how_to_start_your_own_country https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syujtp5m5vk -- or the guys behind [ sealand ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/principality_of_sealand ) ? 
   and the christian idea of a god is to hypocritical and illogical to me . 
  he 's supposed to be this loving fatherly figure but then also does a lot of bad shit and somehow all the bad shit that happens is totally god 's plan . 
   people say french cars are shit . 
  people often think of cheap renaults and peugeots from the '70s . 
  or the 2cv ... french cars have often been seen as a bit `` eccentric '' , with very different design and weird innovative mechanical solutions , like for example the citro\u00ebn ds with its pneumatic suspension and turning headlights . 
  french cars overall have unfortunately often had a reputation of not being that reliable , and often difficult to work with since they 've had so many odd mechanical solutions , differing from most other car makes . 
  between the 90s and today , citro\u00ebn , renault and peugeot are seen as quite average cars ( it 's mostly their smaller compact cars that are marketed in scandinavia , as well as their minivans ) ... but there are still a few models with very eccentric design . 
  i 've always found peugeot 's concept cars very extreme , but i have not much personal experience of their actual cars . 
  breda as in ansaldobreda ? 
  \\* shivers \\*, 
  not eastern european , but i ended up in a discussion about peanut butter a while ago , and noticed that skippy peanut butter only contained 72-79 % peanuts in sweden , but 90 % in the us ... the remaining 21-28 % being oil and dextrose ( and a pinch of salt ) . 
  they did however change their recipe here for the better a couple of years ago . 
  but at 90 % they 're still one of the brands with the most cheap fillers on the market , where most brands here have between 96 and 99.7 % peanuts . 
  s\u00e1mi roadsigns are very common in the northernmost parts of sweden also . 
  [ sometimes quite difficult to read or pronounce ] ( http://www.fotosidan.se/cldocpart/241394.jpg?m=1 ) occasionally also trilingual signs for some towns and villages . 
  for example [ svappavaara ] ( https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-umui3hf8fm8/vs9hm9emy4i/aaaaaaaaayw/qget_j3cm9w/s1600/svappavaara.jpg ) and [ jokkmokk ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/jokkmokk_table.jpg/440px-jokkmokk_table.jpg ) swedish has only been commonly spoken for the last 100-150 years in these regions . 
  the northeastern parts are traditionally finnish-speaking , and the northwestern parts are traditionally speaking several different s\u00e1mi languages . 
  many northern municipalities have 2 or 3 official languages today , and two municipalities even have 4 . 
  the languages have absolutely no mutual intelligibility with swedish or norwegian ( except a rare few loanwords ) ... 
  they are further distanced from the norse/scandinavian languages than let 's say english < -  russian , or even english < -  arabic . 
  sweden : - same as above , but replace kven with [ me\u00e4nkieli ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/me%c3%a4nkieli_dialects ) , and scratch skolt sami . 
  also add [ elfdalian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elfdalian ) , and various [ westrobothnian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/westrobothnian ) dialects like [ kalixm\u00e5l ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kalix_dialect ) . 
  sports , or rather * watching * sports ( * any * kind of sport ) . 
  participating oneself is something completely different . 
  reality shows celebrity gossip and celebrity worship various social media trends nightclubs and excessive drinking culture political `` debates '' , that consist of constant shit-flinging . 
  basically hooligan mentality . 
  mostly focusing of what 's negative about the opposing ~ ~ sports team ~ ~ * party * instead of trying to explaining the positive effects of their own suggestions ... and also lack of insight of own shortcomings and inability to admit mistakes . 
  as some have pointed put already , try driving an inland route through sweden or finland north < -  south . 
  i 'd suggest the [ e45 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_route_e45 ) through sweden . 
  some regions in the northern half have less than 0.5 person per km ^ 2 , meaning you could round off to zero . 
  -- edit : although it 's perhaps more reminiscent of alaska than kansas ... not all flat , and also dominated by endless conifer forests . 
  coffee with a side of coffee , and also a cup of coffee ...
