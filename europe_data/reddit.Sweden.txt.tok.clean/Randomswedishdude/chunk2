  occasionally i 'll also have some coffee to that . 
  and a banana ... 
  i 'm not that serious with breakfast . 
  very rarely do i make some oatmeal with various seeds , nuts and frozen berries and/or shredded coconut ; a couple of open-face sandwiches with ham and cheese ; a couple of boiled eggs ... and some tea . 
  150 bags per person per year sounds *** insanely *** much . 
  pretty much one bag every other day ... in * average * , not taking into account how many who people who * never * or * almost never * buy a bag . 
  the only thing i can assume is that there 's a lot of surplus waste , from various parties and events . 
  i agree with werkstadt . 
  there 's a definite difference between food ( * mat * ) and snacks/candy/treats / desserts / `` fikabr\u00f6d '' / etc in swedish . 
  * chocolate is n't food ; it 's candy . 
  * chips/crisps is n't food ; it 's snacks . 
  * fries/chips * is * food ; although most often associated with fast food / junk food . 
  * ice cream is n't food ; it 's a dessert , or its own thing if not eaten after a meal . 
  * deep fried pork rinds is n't food ; it 's an abomination . 
  * chewing gum is n't food ; its their own thing . 
  * bread in many different shapes and sizes are considered food ; but sweet baked goods like e.g. 
  cookies , cinnamon buns , or danishes are not . 
  * pancakes belongs to a greyzone . 
  they can be considered either food or a dessert , depending on * how * you serve them and what you serve them * with * ... ( or just some extra `` non-food '' treat if you have them with wipped cream and strawberries at a caf\u00e9 ) . 
  food is anything you normally find as part of proper meals that you eat for nutrition and energy . 
  and no , even if i would eat let 's say a bowl of ice cream or a bag of crisps for lunch , i still would n't call it food . 
  i would say i had a bowl of ice cream * instead * of food . 
  same with energy bars , etc. . . 
  they 're not considered food , but something you eat * instead * of food . 
  no joke , you actually * do * have polar bears in the streets ... occasionally . 
  growing up in the far north , i could pinpoint at least 10 local dialects of swedish in my hometown ( municipality ) alone . 
  and that 's less than 20 ' 000 people . 
  there 's also a few local dialects of finnish / me\u00e4nkieli and also sami ( but i would n't personally be able to distinguish between the dialects since i speak neither language ) . 
  in the norrbotten county , you could easily pick out 5 dialects of swedish that were so far removed from your own that they were n't even mutually intelligible ( without intense practice ) ... even neighboring municipalities . 
  many of the most extreme dialects are dying though , and have been in steady decline for the last century . 
  same ... 
  the rare few people i 've ever met who have been brewing their own beer have n't exactly been cheapskates either . 
  rather connoisseurs and extreme hobbyists who have spent * lots * of money on expensive ingredients for small batches . 
  home-brewing beer and wine is perfectly legal . 
  home-distilling liquor is however illegal . 
  no one * ever * suggests malmberget . 
  https://www.google.se/search?q=malmberget&amp;tbm=isch ^ ( me neither ), 
  i ca n't come up with * any * swedish proverb , idiom or saying that uses grams , kilos , meters , liters , etc. . . 
  the only even * remotely * related expression i could come up with is : '' * lunga ner dig ett par hekto !, 
  * '' ~ `` chill yourself 200g ! '', 
  some slang expression , telling someone to * calm ( the f ) down * . 
  nah , not in stockholm ... you 'd have to go much further north . 
  * but * , it will most likely be a huge difference in length of the days compared to what you 're used to , depending on which latitude you live at . 
  in stockholm during summer , the sun will set late and rise early ... and it will not get * completely * pitch-black dark at night , but it wo n't be daylight . 
  -- examples : [ stockholm ] ( https://www.timeanddate.com/sun/sweden/stockholm?month=5&amp;year=2017 ) [ kiruna , in northernmost sweden ] ( https://www.timeanddate.com/sun/sweden/kiruna?month=5&amp;year=2017 ) [ malm\u00f6 , in southernmost sweden ] ( https://www.timeanddate.com/sun/sweden/malmo?month=5&amp;year=2017 ), 
  of course i * knew * that we were the odd ones , but i still have to say that it felt absurdly strange the first time i traveled far enough south from the arctic to experienced that it actually got * dark * at night during summer . 
  i grew up in `` here-be-dragons '' territory , and was used to daylight 24/7 at the peak of summer ( and polar-night during december ) ... 
  sorry ... 13 % or roughly 1 / ** 8 **, 
  well , dental is another chapter . 
   unfortunately not quite as heavily subsided . 
  there are several stages of subsidies , so extensive surgery etc are reduced cost , but there 's no maximum cost ceiling ... 
  i removed my wisdom teeth a few years ago , and i think i paid around 800sek for the first , and maybe second , then the remaining were 50 % off . 
  dental including corrective surgery and braces is free up to the age of low 20-something ; plus/minus a year depending on region , iirc . 
  ^ ( it was up to your 19th birthday when i was that age . ), 
  -- one is also granted a `` dental check '' of 300sek either every or every other year , depending on age ... one can have up to two unused check , then they 're lost . 
  this amount 300sek ( or in total 600sek with an unused grant from the previous years ) can be deducted from your cost whenever you feel like you need a check-up , some polishing or anything . 
  answered a similar question the other day . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/66c1lk/ -- copy-paste :   does your country have universal healthcare ? 
   is it single payer ? 
   single payer  ^ ( there are however also a number of small private clinics and practitioners , but they 're not that common . 
  many of those clinics and practitioners , but not all , also have contracts with the counties / government regions , and those will thus offer care the same cost as the public network of clinics and hospitals . ), 
    how much does it cost you per month ? 
   nothing ... or rather an undisclosed amount of taxes . 
  ( edit : googled it , and it 's apparently 13 % or 1/8th of the taxes in total . ), 
   * a doctor appointment to your local health clinic cost something like 100sek ( ~ $ 12 ) . 
  * a nurse appointment at your local health clinic cost something like 50sek ( ~ $ 6 ) . 
  * seeing a physiotherapist is something like 80-100sek ( ~ $ 9-12 ) * seeing a psychiatrist is something like 100sek ( ~ $ 12 ) * a doctor appointment at a hospital or a clinic other than the one where you 're registered cost something like 300sek ( ~ $ 36 ) . 
   * if you 're during the same day is cross-referred by the doctor to some other department for let 's say various tests , an x-ray , or seeing some specialist , there 's no extra charge . 
  in other words , you pay the same no matter if you 're sent home with a prescription for antibiotics , or are rushed for emergency surgery . 
   * hospitalization for observation / iv antibiotics / post-surgery recovery / or whatever reason is ( iirc ) 100sek per day , including meals . 
   * maximum cost for a 12-month period is 1200sek ( ~ $ 135 ) , counting from your initial appointment ... no matter if they 're completely unrelated cases . 
  if you experience a series of unfortunate events starting today , with several different injuries/infections spread over the following months , perhaps also combined with psychiatric counseling and/or physical rehabilitation following an injury ... 
  whenever you 've paid 1200sek in total since today , every following appointment , surgery or hospital stay for the remaining 12-month period , until april 19th 2018 , is free . 
  ^ ( although if you miss an appointment , you have to pay the usual fee . ), 
   --  * prescribed medicine is subsidized at several stages . 
  after paying 1100sek during a 12-month period , you get 50 % off . 
  after paying 1600sek in total , you get 75 % off . 
  after paying 2050sek in total , you get 90 % off . 
  ... and after paying 2200sek ( ~ $ 245 ) in total , you get 100 % off for the remainder of the 12-month period since first purchase . 
   * all health-care ( including regular checkups and vaccinations ) and prescription medications are free for children and youths up to 20 ... and elderly over 85 . 
   * cab rides to/from hospitals are subsided / reduced cost , if arranged in advanced . 
    what do you like and dislike about it ? 
   i like that it 's nothing i ever have to think about . 
  it 's there if i need it . 
   although it 's a minor inconvenience that you sometimes have to wait , anything from a week up to a few months , for some non-urgent specialist examinations or treatments . 
    do you have a doctor shortage ? 
   well ... 
  it depends . 
   * there 's no shortage on gps . 
  but there might sometimes be a local shortage on certain specific specialists . 
   * in several regions there 's a currently a shortage of nurses , and specialist nurses in particular . 
   * in many regions there 's also a general shortage of psychiatrists , various specialized therapists , and doctors with psychiatric specialization ... within the public system ... 
  there are a number of * private * psychiatrists , therapists , etc. 
  some of them have deals with the to take a certain number of clients covered by the subsidized fees , when specifically referred from the public care ; but usually subsidies do n't apply . 
    does it have enough government funding or too much ( unsustainable ) ? 
   there 's currently a noticeable lack of funding in several regions . 
   * part caused by the system having lagged behind being upscaled in line with the increased population since the turn of the millennium . 
   * part caused by an increase of negative stress-related health effects in society as a whole over the last couple of decades . 
   --  as a side note : many ( most ? ), 
  large companies and authorities has for decades sponsored gym memberships for their employees ; or offered company gyms and saunas ; as well as provided reduced-cost massage appointments , free stop-smoking courses , and various other health-related offers ... as a healthy staff is both more efficient and cheaper in the long run .
