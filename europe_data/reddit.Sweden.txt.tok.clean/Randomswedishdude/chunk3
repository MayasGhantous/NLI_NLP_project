   * some * few employers have lately begun offering private health insurance to their staff ... but it 's not too common . 
  the worst i 've ever seen was frozen salmon at the supermarket : `` farmed in norway - packeted in chile '' talk about unnecessary transports . 
  i have only seen maybe a handful korean films ; a few dramas and a few comedies . 
  one of my favorites films is * castaway on the moon * ... 
  though it 's perhaps more a romantic drama-comedy than a drama . 
  it 's a movie i can recommend either way . 
   i do n't think i 've ever seen a temperature below -5 \u00b0 c though i visited my dad in the north a while ago , and [ i immediately remembered why i moved south ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yguhqjf.jpg ) . 
  it usually dips down about 15 degrees below * that * too , for at least a few days every winter . 
  volvo has experimented with electric cars for a while ( edit : their first electric prototype was built in 1976 ) , but have yet to put something out on the regular market ... 
  they have several hybrid available , but no all-electric ones commercially available ( for normal everyday people ) as of yet . 
  there are a few fully-electric c30e prototypes available as rentals in my city , by a car pool partially owned by volvo themselves . 
  i 've been eager to try one just for the heck of it , but so far i have n't gotten around to doing so , as their range unfortunately prohibits longer journeys . 
  -- there 's also nevs ( national electric vehicle sweden ab ) , who bought up the remnants of saab automobiles a few years ago and aim to develop electric cars . 
  their first model is supposed to be an electric version of the saab 9-3 . 
  as i googled them when writing this comment , it seems like they just now have signed some kind of development agreement with chinese iconiq motors . 
  maybe leonard in big bang theory . 
  socially awkward nerd , even though not * as * awkward as sheldon \\* . 
  somewhat diplomatic attitude . 
  faily successful in his field , even though not dominating the field , and somehow ended up with a faily good looking girlfriend . 
  ^ \\* ^ ( speaking of nothing , there 's an episode where sheldon tried to ) [ ^ learn ^ finnish . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/5jyi3xt-mhu ), 
  the sport specifically is [ orientierungslauf ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/orientierungslauf ) in german , since the german version of the word with the original meaning , ` orienterung ' , was very similar . 
  on the other hand , in swedish ` orientering ' can mean * both * the sport and the same as ` orienterung ' - orientation/inclination/position . 
  they 're most * modern * swedish words that have found their way into english , and many other languages . 
  there are a shitload of words that has entered english from old norse , and also medieval swedish ( as well as the other scandinavian languages ; but what encompasses a dialect or a language is a grey area , especially when talking about as closely related languages as the scandinavian ones ) . 
  then there are words that has been borrowed into other languages than english . 
  most notably finnish , but also german and other languages spoken around the baltic sea ... 
  in rare cases also completely unrelated languages , but then often via another language . 
  for example , * ombudsman * and a few of the words that has found their way to english has then found their way to as unrelated languages as japanese and other asian languages . 
  yes , it 's available but it 's still somewhat niche ... like how the only time we swedes encounter any type of corn bread is when eating tortillas ( and even then , wheat tortillas are more common ) . 
  but you could look in basically any swede 's pantry , and you 'll * at least * find a package of rye crisp bread ... 
  well , i was speaking about rye bread in general ... as soon as you fry it in oil it would probably be more palatable for americans . 
  and they would probably * still * consider it a healthy alternative to what they usually eat . 
  to also make northern europe more complicated ; greenland ( which is geographically north america ) is most often included in the umbrella term `` nordic countries '' , and by association with denmark also `` northern europe '' . 
  -- sidenote : in english the terms * scandinavia * and * nordic countries * are often ( incorrectly ! ), 
  used interchangeably . 
  * the scandinavian peninsula consists of sweden and norway , plus a small part of northern finland ; but not denmark . 
  * scandinavia consists of norway , sweden and denmark ; but not finland . 
  * fennoscandia consists of norway , sweden , finland , and often including some of the westernmost/north-westernmost parts of russia ( the kola peninsula , russian karelia , etc ) . 
  * the nordic countries consists of sweden , norway , denmark , finland , iceland , and greenland . 
  ... and belonging to the nordics are also svalbard and jan mayen , faroe islands , \u00c5land islands , and a shitload of norwegian islands and territories around the antarctica . 
  the eu is still just 28 out of 50 + european countries ... 
  soon 27 ... 
  judging from reddit threads and the internet in general , ryebread is n't really popular in the us ... and probably wo n't be for a while . 
  i 've seen too many comments in reddit threads where germans , finns , danes , etc living in the us commenting on how difficult it is to find good bread , and good rye bread in particular ... and that how 90 % of all bread is fluffy white bread without either taste or substance ... rye bread has too much taste in itself , but it * might * become popular with health trends . 
  -- heck , i 've read comments on english-translated recipes for things like swedish chocolate balls \\* , where commenters have expressed joy over finding a '' * healthy * '' snack recipe for their children , since it contained some oats . 
  ^ \\* ^ ( previously known under a `` somewhat less politically correct '' name ) wtf ?!, 
  * healthy * ? 
  they 're mostly butter and sugar !, 
  they only contain rolled oats to give them some texture and act as a binder , and some shredded coconut on the surface so that your hands do n't get all greasy from the butter when you hold them . 
  i do n't want to think of what the commenters usually give their kids , when [ butter/sugar-balls like these ] ( http://www.swedishfood.com/swedish-food-recipes-desserts/216-chocolate-balls ) could be considered `` healthy '' . 
  a compact and heavy loaf of slightly sour tasting rye bread ( bread that you actually might have to * chew * ) could be outright incomprehensible as a food item for people like that . 
  it 's true for any media in any country . 
  the trick is to ( just like op ) look at a broad spectrum of different sources ; and not listen to * just * one . 
  no news source will report a complete picture of * anything * ; no matter if it 's a large or small event , foreign or domestic , local or national , national or international ... 
   does your country have universal healthcare ? 
   is it single payer ? 
  single payer ^ ( there are however also a number of small private clinics and practitioners , but they 're not that common . 
  many of those clinics and practitioners , but not all , also have contracts with the counties / government regions , and those will thus offer care the same cost as the public network of clinics and hospitals . ), 
   how much does it cost you per month ? 
  nothing ... or rather an undisclosed amount of taxes . 
  ( edit : googled it , and it 's apparently 13 % or 1/6th of the taxes in total . ), 
  * a doctor appointment to your local health clinic cost something like 100sek ( ~ $ 12 ) . 
  * a nurse appointment at your local health clinic cost something like 50sek ( ~ $ 6 ) . 
  * seeing a physiotherapist is something like 80-100sek ( ~ $ 9-12 ) * seeing a psychiatrist is something like 100sek ( ~ $ 12 ) * a doctor appointment at a hospital or a clinic other than the one where you 're registered cost something like 300sek ( ~ $ 36 ) . 
  * if you 're during the same day is cross-referred by the doctor to some other department for let 's say various tests , an x-ray , or seeing some specialist , there 's no extra charge . 
  in other words , you pay the same no matter if you 're sent home with a prescription for antibiotics , or are rushed for emergency surgery . 
  * hospitalization for observation / iv antibiotics / post-surgery recovery / or whatever reason is ( iirc ) 100sek per day , including meals . 
  * maximum cost for a 12-month period is 1200sek ( ~ $ 135 ) , counting from your initial appointment ... no matter if they 're completely unrelated cases . 
  if you experience a series of unfortunate events starting today , with several different injuries/infections spread over the following months , perhaps also combined with psychiatric counseling and/or physical rehabilitation following an injury ... 
  whenever you 've paid 1200sek in total since today , every following appointment , surgery or hospital stay for the remaining 12-month period , until april 19th 2018 , is free . 
  ^ ( although if you miss an appointment , you have to pay the usual fee . ), 
  -- * prescribed medicine is subsidized at several stages . 
  after paying 1100sek during a 12-month period , you get 50 % off . 
  after paying 1600sek in total , you get 75 % off . 
  after paying 2050sek in total , you get 90 % off . 
  ... and after paying 2200sek ( ~ $ 245 ) in total , you get 100 % off for the remainder of the 12-month period since first purchase . 
  * all health-care ( including regular checkups and vaccinations ) and prescription medications is free for children , and youths up to 20 ... and elderly over 85 . 
  * cab rides to/from hospitals are subsided / reduced cost , if arranged in advanced . 
   what do you like and dislike about it ? 
  i like that it 's nothing i ever have to think about . 
  it 's there if i need it . 
  although it 's a minor inconvenience that you sometimes have to wait , anything from a week up to a few months , for some non-urgent specialist examinations or treatments . 
   do you have a doctor shortage ? 
  well ... 
  it depends . 
  * there 's no shortage on gps . 
  but there might sometimes be a local shortage on certain specific specialists . 
  * in several regions there 's a currently a shortage of nurses , and specialist nurses in particular . 
  * in many regions there 's also a general shortage of psychiatrists , various specialized therapists , and doctors with psychiatric specialization ... within the public system ... 
  there are a number of * private * psychiatrists , therapists , etc. 
  some of them have deals with the to take a certain number of clients covered by the subsidized fees , when specifically referred from the public care ; but usually subsidies do n't apply . 
   does it have enough government funding or too much ( unsustainable ) ? 
  there 's currently a noticeable lack of funding in several regions . 
  * part caused by the system having lagged behind being upscaled in line with the increased population since the turn of the millennium . 
  * part caused by an increase of negative stress-related health effects in society as a whole over the last couple of decades . 
  -- as a side note : many ( most ? ), 
  large companies and authorities has for decades sponsored gym memberships for their employees ; or offered company gyms and saunas ; as well as provided reduced-cost massage appointments , free stop-smoking courses , and various other health-related offers ... as a healthy staff is both more efficient and cheaper in the long run . 
  * some * few employers have lately begun offering private health insurance to their staff ... but it 's not too common . 
  outside europe : just once backpacking in southeast asia for a month ...
