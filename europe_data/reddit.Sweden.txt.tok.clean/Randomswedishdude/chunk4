  unless also counting svalbard which is somewhat a special case , ~ 1000km north of mainland europe 's northernmost tip . 
  i had planned a longer vacation trip to south korea , hong kong and japan ( + probably a few more destinations over a couple of months ) some years ago ... but things got unusually busy at work , so i postponed the vacation for career reasons ( in hindsight a terrible move ) ... then my friend i was going to travel with passed away . 
  -- however , i still ca n't really grasp how ** easy ** it is to travel , as i did n't really grow up with it being talked about . 
  when i grew up i had only norway and finland within reasonably distance for traveling `` internationally '' . 
  ^ ( well , also northern russia , which at the time was the soviet union , so that was out of the question . 
  even long after the su fell apart ... 
  besides , northern russia is mostly just mining communities and protected military complexes ; not exactly tourist destinations either way . ), 
  airfares were prohibitively expensive back then , compared to the last couple of decades ( no competing low fare airlines back then ) . 
  and as a northerner , traveling abroad was a lot more expensive than for southerners since i would have to get to an international airport first , which would in many cases add 40-100 % to the cost ... and also add a lot on travel time . 
  looking at a map ; the distance from my hometown to southernmost sweden , not to mention neighboring counties in the south , like denmark and ( west ) germany , was roughly the same as ontario - florida or southeastern alaska - california . 
  here a clip from the day after : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfa-h6yhzog ( interview in swedish ; but the clip also shows the hungover moose recovering in the garden ... before being strong enough to leave . ), 
  well , could n't it possibly be that the made statement actually had a point ? 
  economic desperation leads to desperate actions , and while not everyone crippled by unbearable medical bills necessarily becomes murderous international drug lords , it * does * evidently lead to increased crime rates ... that might affect anyone . 
  besides ; the us still spends * more * taxdollars per capita on healthcare than pretty much any other country , but the cost of use for average mundane care is * still * crippling for many people , * even * with insurance . 
  it 's a mess where costs are inflated due to hunt for profit maximization by several parties in the supply chain . 
  what 's the reason behind letting police services , fire & rescue services , public roads , public schools , libraries , national parks , etc being free at the point of usage ... but not health care ? 
  you can call for the cops , fire brigade , sea/mountain rescue , etc , without being billed ( assuming the calls were warranted , and not deliberate misused or `` prank calls '' ) ... 
  but you * ca n't * call for an ambulance by the same terms . 
  what 's the differences between a fireman , a cop and a paramedic ? 
  or rather what 's the difference that leads to one of them being considered an `` optional luxury '' as opposed to the other two ? 
  -- if i plan to buy a new tv , i can compare prices between stores and ** choose ** whatever i want ... but if i do n't find any interesting deal , i can also choose ** not ** to buy one . 
  life still goes on . 
  i can still live perfectly fine without a new tv . 
  but if i get hit by a drunk driver and is unconsciously taken to a hospital , and spend a couple of weeks in a coma , it 's not a business deal i 'm actively choosing . 
  it 's not a `` free market '' if the `` customer '' has no choice ... ... then also consider the possibility that drunk driver perhaps * being * a drunk because of self-medicated depression ; after loosing a kid to cancer . 
  he could n't afford cancer treatment for his kid , but is still financially screwed just for * diagnosing * the cancer ; and he also could n't afford psychiatric counseling after the kid died . 
  i admit there are a few benefits with your system . 
  for example , it gave us the premise of breaking bad , one of top 10 best tv-series i 've seen ... 
  the plot would have been ridiculous in any other developed country . 
  you can * live * without owning a ferrari . 
  what 's the point of having the `` best care available '' , if it 's at the same time not * realistically * available due to prohibitive costs ? 
  `` oh , you have this rare type of cancer , making you unable to work due to inconceivable pain ? . 
  lucky for you there 's this treatment that wi ... oh , wait ... you 're unemployed and broke since you 're unable to work due to pain ? 
  then you unfortunately do n't belong to our target group ... 
  some years ago , the prison guards at a high security facility * forgot * to lock in a few inmates at night . 
  6 prisoners escaped ... ... to the kitchen . 
  where they then spent the night baking chocolate mud cake . 
  and cozied it up in a pillow fort , watching tv . 
  one news article also stated that when the huge blunder was discovered , there was nothing left of the cake , and * the embarrassed night staff had n't been offered any of it . 
  not a single piece * . 
   even the swedish !, 
  they just do n't use a special word for it . 
  ** mys ** ^ noun ; ** mysa ** ^ verb ; ** mysig / mysigt ** ^ ( adjective and adverb ) carrying pretty much exactly the same meaning as the danish words , as well as the norwegian , * kose * ; * koselig * . 
  there 's also ** hygglig/hyggligt ** , which is related to the danish word , but means more * decent * , * ok * , * reasonably * , * nice-or-pleasant-but-not-fantastic * . 
  and there 's also the ( excessively formal and oldfashioned ) ** gemytlig/gemytligt ** , which is obviously a loan from german . 
  i once looked at a jar of marshmallow fluff at the american corner of the international section of my local store . 
  i laughed when i read on the back of the jar : `` spread on sandwiches , as part of a healthy and nutritional breakfast '' . 
  seriously ... * part of a healthy and nutritional breakfast * ? 
  it 's 98 % sugar and hfcs ... with the remaining part being a minuscule amount of artificial flavorings and egg whites . 
  it 's possibly one of the ** least ** healthy and nutritional thing you could even imagine putting on a sandwich ... 
  zero nutritional value , and will just cause an insulin crash ; making you feel dizzy and fatigued about an hour later . 
  eating a wax candle would supply you with the same amount of minerals and vitamins ( if not * more * ) , but without making your blood glucose levels go on a rollercoaster . 
  -- edit : i also find nutella , which is `` only '' 50 % sugar , repulsive as a sandwich spread . 
  it 's * candy * , not * food * ... 
  i always * prefer * taking a train over flying , for distances under let 's say 1000km . 
  both more convenient and cheaper , and also better from an emissions standpoint . 
  with a train you usually do n't have any restrictive luggage limits ; no transfers , just go directly from city center to city center ; no queuing for luggage check-ins , no queuing in security checks ; no long waits before boarding the plane , etc. . . just board the train , read a book , have a meal , have a nap , and you 're there ... 
  but * over * 1000km , i feel the opposite . 
  i have a 1600km domestic train trip booked the next week . 
  i 'm not really looking forward to spending ( in best case ) 21 hours on the train , each way . 
  the trip itself is usually ok , and i often meet some fun person to chat with during the trip , but it 's the * uncertainty * and unreliability that gets me ... 
  i mean , severe delays are n't too uncommon during this time of year ; anything from a couple of hours to several days . 
  last time i was delayed * over a week * on my way home . 
  a combination of canceled trains due to reindeer collisions , and canceled trains due to `` extreme weather '' , i.e regular ordinary swedish winter time . 
  i had a look at wikipedia : https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/gamla_svenska_m%c3%a5tt hardly any of the old units are actually used nowadays , except the ones already mentioned . 
  a few not - * too * - old-fashioned ones are : * * aln * ( ell ) - distance between elbow and tip of middle finger ~ 59cm * * famn * ( fathom ) - the distance between a man 's outstretched arms = 6 * fot * = 1.78 m * * rast * ( rest ) - walking distance in forests before having a break ~ 5km * * steg * ( pace ) - a long step = 1/2 * famn * or 85-90cm * * tunnland * ( barrel of land ) - the area used to sow a barrel of grains ~ 1/2 hectare = 5000m \u00b2 * * tv\u00e4rhand * ( handbreadth/palm ) - the width of a hand ~ 4 * tum * or 8-10 cm * * kanna * ( pitcher ) * * fat * ( keg ) * * tunna * ( barrel ) few of the above are used as actual units today , but * may * in some cases be heard in fixed phrases and expressions . 
  -- one interesting one i ca n't say i had heard before was * * yxkast * - the distance you 'd throw an axe . 
  was apparently an occasionally used unit in legal documents during the middle ages . 
  [ relevant satw ] ( http://satwcomic.com/doctor-strange ) mads mikkelsen is however a great actor . 
  jagten / `` the hunt '' was * intense * , and i also like his characters in somewhat older films like flickering lights . 
  -- edit : [ a scene from flickering lights ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xe4zbck01hu ) . 
  ( unfortunately no subtitles ), 
   coincidentally , 
  satw is actually pretty accurate . 
  that said ; finland has been *** very *** important throughout swedish history ... from the middle ages up until 1809 ( edit : and then also keeping both the soviets * and * the nazis occupied during wwii . ), 
  without finland , who knows what sweden would have been today . 
  probably would n't even exist as an independent country ; being squeezed between historically warmongering denmark , poland and russia ... 
  i 'm not saying sweden was n't equally ( or more ) warmongering back then ... but it was easy/easier being cocky when you had the determined kamikaze finns on your side . 
  northern sweden : finland western sweden : norway southern sweden : denmark stockholm : whichever country happened to be perceived as trendy and fashionable at the era . 
   the formal name here is ` storbritannien ' ( great britain ) , and the colloquial name is just ` england ' . 
  well , the actual formal name in swedish is '' * f\u00f6renade konungariket storbritannien och nordirland * '' , but you rarely hear it ... mostly just `` storbritannien '' . 
  ... or very casually : `` england '' , but it * most * cases `` england '' refer to just england proper . 
  ( although , to some people it just just means * london * ) . 
  - far , f\u00e5r f\u00e5r f\u00e5r ? 
  [ another swedish-german misunderstanding ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2kceop4jpa ) - sehr sch\u00f6n !, 
  ( very beautiful ) - ja , jag ser sj\u00f6n . 
  ( yeah , i see the lake ), 
  speaking of junk food for drunk people . 
  in the north of sweden a [ parisare ] ( https://ohmansmatovin.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/parisare.jpg?w=630 ) is a grilled crosscut of a huge sausage . 
  served in a hamburger bun with ketchup , mustard , and either ' [ bostongurka ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bostongurka ) ' or ` gurksallad ' ( bostongurka mixed with mayonnaise ) . 
  -- the parisergrill-sausage itself has a very finely ground texture , contains lots of fillers like potato starch and water ( ~ 50-55 % meat ) , and hardly any noticeable spices at all ( * trace amounts * of nutmeg , ginger , onions , salt , pepper ) . 
  it 's basically a jumbo-sized falukorv . 
  i 'm in my mid 30s , and i know exactly * two * persons , my age or younger , who are religious ( and conforming to a major religion ) ; both christians . 
  they also happen to be the only religious people i know who are younger than 85 . 
  although there are some religious folks out there , i just do n't personally know that many ... or rather , i do n't know * if * someone else i know is religious . 
  most people who have any kind of religious beliefs are very casual and laid back about it , and does n't care much about the church/mosque/etc ... 
  religion and spirituality is mostly a personal opinion , and seldom a conversational topic . 
  i mean , i can sometimes go about with my life for up to maybe a year without hearing * anyone * talk about personal religious beliefs . 
  -- the vast majority of people i meet in my daily life are atheist , or * are percieved * as atheists . 
  religion is simply not very noticeable at all .
