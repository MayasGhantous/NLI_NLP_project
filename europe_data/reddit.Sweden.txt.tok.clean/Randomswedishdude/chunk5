  besides the few elderly casual christians one bump into now and then , i 've had jehovah 's witnesses knocking on my door occasionally , but it has been a few years since last time . 
  i have some muslim neighbors , but they 're not particularly religious . 
  i 've only met two muslims who talked about religion as a spiritual thing , otherwise it 's mostly casual cultural traditions/heritage . 
  i 've met exactly one religious jew . 
  then maybe a handful of people identifying as `` buddhists '' ... more or less convincingly . 
  and the occasional spiritual new-age hippie , goth witch , satanist or `` norse viking '' , etc. . . ( 98 % teenagers going through a phase while exploring/developing their identity . ), 
  -- not even the * church * is very religious nowadays . 
  i visited the church on a whim the other year , after seeing i had seen an intriguing poster regarding a discourse about mysticism ( and lack thereof ) in politics , past and present . 
  it was also held by none else than the former archbishop of the church of sweden , who i knew was a good speaker ... 
  i knew of him partly because he , since retirement , has made a few guest appearances on lighthearted humorous panel shows on tv . 
  but mostly because he occasionally used to write jokingly snarky ( but also thought-provoking and on point ) replies on the debate pages in various papers . 
  it was two well spent hours . 
  an interesting session where he spoke about the topics from a very floating open-ended philosophical perspective . 
  he had the perfect balance of seriousness and humor , factual history and interesting reflections . 
  interestingly enough , i do n't think he even * once * mentioned or talked about `` god '' directly . 
  maybe once or twice during the discourse did he mention '' * ... the thought or concept which we traditionally refer to as god ... * '' it felt more like an open lecture at a university than a church . 
  like i said , i 'm on my phone ... fredrik lindstr\u00f6m 's svenska dialektmysterier can act as an introduction , but far from complete analysis . 
  https://youtu.be/qjsndhwrd58 to me , it could might as well be yiddish or afrikaans . 
  that 's the thing , they * differ * from swedish and norwegian , and even differ from old norse . 
  -- and yes , they have the nominative / dative cases , just like \u00c4lvdalska , etc. . . 
  the oldeat roots ( i believe ) are some traces from proto-norse in the form of differences in diphtongs and vole sounds , that evolved elsewhere between proto - and old norse ... and some odd few very old fashioned words ( or word roots ) then there some verb cases that has been preserved from that time . 
  accusative / dative , like in icelandic ... and other small stuff . 
  there are influences from both east and west norse , as well as both semi-modern and modern swedish and norwegian ... but there are a lot of old fashioned vocabulary , and vocabulary that has been developed in isolation ... as well as some preserved grammatical curiosities in a few of the bonschka dialects go a far way back ... ca n't look it up at the moment , as i 'm on my phone , but \u00d6verkalixm\u00e5l and kalixm\u00e5l may be worth looking up as they 're considered to be the most extreme out of the bunch . 
  in declining order : swedish \\* , me\u00e4nkieli and finnish , north sami , and perhaps to a very small extent lule sami ... and the occasional norwegians and danes . 
  then english , and later on also german/french/spanish in schools . 
  english was used a lot with foreign workers and tourists . 
  to lesser extent also german and french . 
  then you also * heard * a few other languages being spoken once in a while ( after the cold war was over ) among groups of either temporary workers or tourists ... polish , latvian , lithuanian , thai , vietnamese , mandarin , japanese ... etc. . . 
  lately i guess also a bunch of languages among refugees and asylum seekers ... arabic , farsi , pashto ... etc. . . maybe russian and turkish once in a while . 
  in the '90s perhaps also serbian , croatian , albanian , etc. . . for brief period of time . 
  -- ( \\* edit - including some bonschka dialects which are remnants of a nordic language seperate from old norse . 
  with some rare traces or * proto * - norse ... 
  some dialects in that spectrum are more difficult to understand than both norwegian and danish . ), 
  well ... ( pre - ) historically , was n't a sauna usually the first building built in a new settlement of nomadic/semi-nomadic tribes of proto-finns ? 
  i mean , if you even built * anything * other than a simple shelter . 
  a sauna was a multi-purpose facility used for washing up ( both yourself an your clothes ) , for smoking/drying meat and fish ( as well as for cooking , baking , etc ) , for keeping healthy and curing diseases , for having a sterile environment for giving birth , a `` holy '' place for relaxation and meditation , etc. . . etc. . . having a sauna in connection with the house is seen as a kind of splurging luxury in most of the western world ( outside the nordic region ) . 
  but historically in the fenno-baltic region ( including karelia , etc ) , it was the compete opposite : having a * house for living * , *** separate *** from the * sauna * was seen as a luxury and wealth . 
  a sauna was simply one of the most basic and necessary things there was ... 
  for whatever reason , i said `` things '' , but changed it to `` foodstuffs '' , then changed it again to `` stuffs '' since i did n't have just food in mind after all . 
  either way , stuff * can * be pluralised when speaking of several different categories of things . 
  it may sound a bit odd for some reason , but it 's actually correct in certain situations . 
  water is usually uncountable , but you can still talk about water * s * if there 's an implied countable unit . 
  e.g fishing water * s * ... -- though my sentence structure and punctuation is horrendous , despite ( and in part * due to * ) having edited the comment a couple of times already . 
  the inconsistent line breaks are an eyesore , resulting from pretty much unnecessary changes , moving bits and pieces around ... 
  if i were fully awake , i would have worded basically the whole comment differently . 
  i 'm pretty much incapable of keeping my trail of thoughts straight at the moment . 
  ( edit : regardless of language . ), 
  my family 's summer home is only a few minutes walk from the torne\u00e5 / tornio river , i.e the border between sweden and finland ... 
  although the nearest bridge is located 20km upstream . 
  it 's easy to cross anywhere during winter when it 's frozen , but i 've personally never been in the area at that time of year . 
  the neighbor 's dog has been caught on the other side of the river several times , when running after some bitch in heat . 
  we usually split our grocery shopping between two neighboring towns on each side of the border . 
  in almost any store on both sides , everything is listed in two languages and two currencies . 
  some stuffs are cheaper/better on one side , and some stuffs are cheaper/better on the other . 
  some brands or flavors are only available on one side , some on the other . 
  it 's * almost * like they 're just different districts of one town . 
  the main thing one notices is that the design of road signs differ , newspaper posters are in different languages ... and the towns are in different time zones ( where the finnish side is one hour ahead ) . 
  ^ ( also , talking/surfing on your cellphone could get * very * expensive if it , for whatever reason , lost contact with its home network and switched to international roaming . 
  luckily , the roaming fees have been greatly reduced the last few years . ), 
  -- i 've also used to live 3 minutes walk from a ferry terminal to denmark ( but it takes several hours to cross ) . 
  i only did it about once per year , most often just to visit other pubs than the usual ... once just because i enjoyed the food on-board . 
  ca n't blame them though ... a cheap lager at a rural pub in sweden or norway would cost more than a full 24 case of comparable beers at a gas station in germany . 
  ~ ~ maybe two cases even . ~ ~, 
  as a swede who grew up in the far north : every summer ... german families with caravans or campervans * everywhere * along the roads . 
  germans , germans , germans ... maybe a polish couple in a fiat , a lone czech on a motorcycle , and a french couple pedaling on heavily laden touring bikes ... then more german campers ... as foreign tourists in northern sweden , they 're seemingly outnumbered only by speeding norwegians . 
  if i 'd end up behind a camper with german license plates along the e10 or e45 , then i 've been conditioned throughout my life to always keep a generous distance , as they may step on the brake at any time if the happen to spot a moose/elk or a herd of reindeer in the surrounding terrain ... only to gaze upon them for several minutes . 
  ( panic braking outside actual life threatening situations does n't happen * too * often , but * when * it happens ; it 's `` always '' a german tourist . ), 
  a common stereotype about germans is that they 'll buy any kind of souvenirs if it has anything to do with mooses ... 
  even moose feces in glass jars ( edit : or , i shit you not , moose shit earrings ) ... 
  although i guess all `` normal '' germans , who ** are n't ** obsessively interested in ruminant mammals with large antlers , generally choose other travel destinations ... , 
  yes , we 're like brothers who `` hate '' each other . 
  we repeatedly beat the crap out each other while growing up , and might still have some grudges ( and differing opinions ) ... 
  but hell if * someone else * is going to pick a fight with our brother !, 
  yeah , it may be very much a stretch ... but sweden and poland was once ( very briefly ) unified under one king . 
  although that led to a war ... and there have been many wars since . 
  in fact , was probably far from `` best friends '' . 
  finland as the unquestionable number one . 
  then norway and perhaps germany . 
  very complicated relationship with denmark , although culturally very close . 
  historically france as number one , followed by various historic predecessor states of today 's germany ... 
  periodically also england , scotland and the netherlands . 
  and for a very brief period of time , a few centuries ago , poland ... 
  finnish is a very common language in the north of sweden ( and an official minority language ) . 
  i grew up hearing it on a nearly daily basis , even though i do n't speak it myself . 
  in some regions , the majority of the rural villages , rivers , creeks , mountains , mires , etc have finnish names ... ending in - vaara , - joki , - j\u00e4rvi , - oja , - p\u00e4\u00e4 , - niemi , etc. . . 
  on the contrary , * do * watch : * ** the man without a past ** / * mies vailla menneisyytt\u00e4 * ( 2002 ) . 
  ^ ( rotten tomatoes approval : 98 % critic , 90 % audience ) i 've only seen something like 12 finnish movies . 
  of which the majority were made by either aki kaurism\u00e4ki , or his brother mika kaurism\u00e4ki . 
  * the man without a past * belongs to my top 10 list of absolute favorite movies , all categories . 
  -- sidenote : the only finnish movies i can remember i 've seen , that was * not * made by either of the kaurism\u00e4ki brothers , are : the winter war / talvisota ( 1989 ) , h\u00e4jyt ( 1999 ) , sauna ( 2008 ) , lapland odyssey / napapiirin sankarit ( 2010 ) , rare exports ( 2010 ) and iron sky ( 2012 ) ... so there 's that . 
  * * rare exports * and * iron sky * are both worth watching if one like quirky comedies . 
  though the latter had some difficulties living up to the hype imo . 
  * * sauna * was an interesting horror movie . 
  been a few years since i saw it though , so i do n't remember too much . 
  it did however strike me with its beautifully cinematography and eerie atmosphere ... but i 'm not really sure what to make out of the experience as a whole . 
  i just could n't take it all in since i actually * hate * horror movies ... 
  i may however consider watching it again ; * some * day ... * * lapland odyssey * was all-in-all an ok or decent road movie with a few laughs here and there ... perhaps not worth tracking down in the immense world of international cinema ... 
  however , the prologue in first couple of minutes had me literally * crying * with laughter . 
  the [ nordic passport union ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordic_passport_union ) predates schengen , by several decades ... schengen made no particular difference while traveling between the scandinavian countries + finland , as the borders were open long before . 
  in the north of sweden and finland it was quite common to live on one side of a border and work at the other ; leave one kid at pre-school on one side , and the other kid at school on the other side ; football practice on one side , floorball practice on the other ; buy some groceries on one side , and some groceries on the other side ... even before schengen .
