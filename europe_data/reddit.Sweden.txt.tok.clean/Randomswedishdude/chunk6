  i know there were custom booths near the bridges across the torne\u00e5 / tornio-river ( which is also the border between sweden and finland ) , but they were unmanned most of the time ... cars were never stopped for any reason ; trucks * maybe * . 
  i assume the same could be said about sweden/norway and the northern norway/finland border ... an older colleague told me he had been stopped for a control at the border * once * , and that was when because they were looking for a fugitive who were believed to have gone in that direction . 
  work-commuting etc across the border between denmark and sweden was n't that common before the bridge was built by the turn of millennium , but it was theoretically possible ... just impractical because of the long travel times with ferries . 
  people still casually traveled the border for whatever reasons ; shopping trips , concerts , pub crawls , etc. . . -- traveling to the baltic countries , poland and germany ( * both * germanies ) used to be a bit more complicated than today ... but that was of course also in part for other reasons than schengen . 
  i.e before 1989-1991 ^ ( though i believe it was * almost easier * for a `` neutral swede '' to travel to either germany ; then for an east-germany traveling to west-germany , or vice versa . ), 
   teabag ... for a nation of ( supposed ) tea-lovers , you 're surprisingly easily satisfied with the dusty leftovers swept up from the floors . 
  sure , i 'm certain there are at least a few brands of fairly high-quality bagged tea , but still ... ^ ( edit : not that i personally scoff at bags , even though i prefer loose ... but then i 'm not a tea connoisseur either . ), 
  anything imported from the us at the time . 
  compare it with a cadillac , oldsmobile , buick or chevrolet from the late '70s ... 
  it 's also smaller than some mainland european cars of the time , e.g. 
  opel admiral etc. . . 
  it 's ( today ) somewhere between midsized and large , depending on who you ask . 
  though the average car in sweden , especially outside the cities , is a bit on the larger side , so many would see the 240 as being roughly average/mainstream size, 
  kebab or falafel . 
  often burgers - though preferably burgers small independent burger joints rather than the big international chains . 
  sometimes pizza - and ocassionally kebab pizza ( and if i 'm up north : * reindeer * kebab pizza ), 
  well , i would n't know . 
  i 'm only a swede who casually takes the ferry over to denmark for some variety a couple of times per year . . 
  a finn ordering a beer in tallin is perhaps not the best example , since the finnish and estonian languages are very closely related to each other ; while at the same time they 're only distantly related to a rare few languages * at all * on this planet . 
  they could get around rater fine by just speaking finnish and estonian respectively to each other ... * especially * for something requiring as few words as ordering a beer . 
  just like how swedes and danes usually understand the gist of each other in basic everyday conversations without too much struggle . 
  ^ ( at least as long as neither of them has any obscure isolated dialect that even forces * fellow countrymen * to stupidly nod and smile , while carefully looking for a discrete escape route . ), 
  almost every time this subject is brought up , it 's rather obvious that what is hate speech is completely misunderstood . 
  are let 's say * death threats * legal in the us ? 
  no , of course not . 
  it 's not the words that matter there , but the intention * action * behind the words . 
  with the ` death threat ' parable ; i could say '' * i 'm going to kill you with a rusty spoon , imjustabagofhammers * '' as long as i make sure it 's in a joking/sarcastic manner or it 's contextually understood that i do n't actually mean it , and that 's just words ... it 's nothing ... 
  but if i would say it and actually mean it , then it 's a threat and a whole different ballpark ; it 's not the words that is being legislated against , it 's the intention of a violent action * behind * the words . 
  is conspiring/planing a murder or a violent robbery legal ? 
  `` it 's just words being expressed between individuals '' no , of course not . 
  it 's not the words that 's illegal , it 's the intended action . 
  -- with hate speech it 's exactly the same . 
  hate speech is n't just `` being offensive '' hate speech ** is n't ** saying something like  '' * i hate all god damn niggers , and those greedy jews and lazy mexicans too , ya hear ... * '' ... that 's expressing a personal opinion and perfectly legal . 
  perhaps offensive ( and moronic ) , but not illegal . 
  hate speech ** is ** publicly spurring hate , inciting violence and effectively rallying up people into lynching mobs , and creating * actually * threatening situations . 
  hate speech is something like long public monologues in the style of  '' * we have to unite against the non-human [ jews/niggers/muslims / op 's mom/whatever ] . 
  grab your pitchforks and unite !, 
  it 's time to rebuild the gas chambers and start holocaust 2.0 !, 
  * '' ... but without the sarcastic humor , and instead being dead serious , with the actual intention of creating tensions , disparagement , violence or even eventually escalating into full-blown genocide . 
  ** it 's the intention of creating ** *** violent action *** ** that 's the reason for the law , not `` people being offended '' ** . 
  the words do n't matter , it 's the intention * behind * the words . 
  you could express the worst imaginable example of hate speech , hitler times infinity , and present it as satire or a piece of art . 
  as long as it clear the intention is n't actually spreading hate , it would be all fine according to those laws ... well , at least not illegal according to * those * laws , but perhaps not according to * other * laws or regulations . 
  i ca n't imagine , for example , the american fcc being fine with you broadcasting a 30 minute `` comedy '' skit about ranting reasons for rounding up [ choose your ethnicity ] for extermination if was played out too seriously ( without canned laughter ) ... 
  hate speech laws are ** not ** intended to , nor will be able to , stop people from being `` offensive '' . 
  the laws are intended to prevent * violence * , not * words * . 
  never been there myself , but [ rovaniemi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rovaniemi ) near the arctic circle in northern finland might be a somewhat different destination . 
  snow , snow , snow , nature , lots and lots of reindeer , forests , [ santa clauses ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/santa_park ) , and as an added bonus also fairly high chances of seeing the northern lights . 
  it crossed my mind that there were something about the hansa and riga for 1201 , but it was one of many uncoordinated thoughts ... and to get from there to the * founding * of riga ; for some reason i thought that it was older than that . 
  for 1873 i was absolutely clueless . 
  1918 independence from russia 1940 - 1945 occupation by the soviet union / war between the soviet union and germany ; germany occupies latvia for a while / the war ends with soviet occupation . 
  1991 independence again 2004 joining eu ? 
  1809 russia conquers everything east of the tornio river from sweden , and incorporates the grand duchy of finland into the russian empire . 
  1917 breaking free from russia and gaining independence ( 6th december ) 1918 civil war , `` red '' vs `` white '' ( with soviet russia aiding the red side , germany aiding the white side ) 1939 winter war , against the soviet union 1941 continuation war , against the soviet union 1958 ~ ~ helsinki olympics ? ~ ~ edit : no idea ( the olympics was 1952 ) 1961 no idea , but i 'd guess it has something to do with politics and kekkonen 1969 no idea 1995 finland 's first world championship gold in ice-hockey 2002 adopting the euro, 
  i thought * rosbif * was british stereotype about the french , like it 's a joking stereotype in the u.k that the french refer to brits as * rosbif * . 
  ^ ( ... all while wearing a betet and a black n ' white striped shirt , smoking a cigarette , carrying a baguette and randomly blurting out '' * sacrebleu * '' ) did n't know that the expression was actually used , but i 've unfortunately consumed waaaay more british tv/movies/books than french ... ... though now that i think of it , i think i 've heard it being uttered * once * , in one of the taxi movies ... in a scene where the police commissioner * tried * not sound offensive in front of a group of foreign politicians , but there was a long exchange of lines where he accidentally blurted out several slurs about various nationalities . 
  aw , fuck ...  it \\*, 
  i was mainly a joke . 
   do you understand its working ? 
  of course , what is it too not understand ?

  ... says the dane . 
  well aware of the history , and i could have worded it better . 
  wrote on my phone while on the go ... 
  it began with an invasion , and was n't voluntary from the norwegian side . 
  i 'd argue it was probably a desperate move of swedish nationalistic pride : both as a result of the defeat 5 years earlier ; losing finland to russia ; and a chance to slap the danes in their faces . 
  the name of the union was * united kingdoms of sweden and norway * , and they were 2 separate countries under one monarch . 
  the union was later peacefully dissolved in 1905 after less than a century . 
  sweden and denmark has been at war with each other on and off for 1000 years ... more wars and rivalry than between england and france , who also `` hate '' each other to this day . 
  the hate is mostly tongue in cheek nowadays , just like the u.k and france . 
  norway has been stuck in between during these wars . 
  for centuries it was either in union , occupied , or a part of denmark ; and for about a century in a union with sweden . 
  all three \\* countries were also in an union during mediaeval times , and a lot of the subsequent wars have been over sour feelings from that time . 
  edit : \\* back then also including finland and iceland , at the time parts of sweden and norway respectively . 
  in swedish , * j\u00e4nkare * is an old expression for us-americans , without any distinction between northern/southern states . 
  edit : in many cases the term contextually implies american * cars * ( often , but not necessarily , from the '50s to '70s period ) but might as well refer to a person . 
  coffe : 70 % of the time it 's arvid nordquist 's from any supermarket . 
  my favourite among the common brands , but i 'm not exacly loyal . 
  often depends on current sales/offers , but then i would n't buy * whatever crap * just because it 's cheap either ; i have my limits . 
  only rarely something fancier , but it happens 2-3 times per year . 
  tea : 90 % of the time loose tea , bought loose by weight from some specialized tea store , but sometimes something simple from the supermarket or convenience store . 
  currently alternating between some expensive saffron tea ( no brand ) , and cheap lemon/lime tea from kobbs . 
  not that much street food in sweden over all . 
  in my city there 's a couple of hotdog vendors along the party ( pub/nightclub ) streets ; a couple of kebab/falafel vendors in caravans ; and also a couple of ( expensive ) organic hipster burger places , * disguised * as trashy makeshift hobo-kitchens in shipping containers . 
  the only place that 's noteworthy imo is a caravan from where they 're selling different variations of fried herring and mashed potatoes , with lingonberries and some other condiments . 
  ( edit : i absolutely * loved * the street food in south-east asia . ), 
  has * brunost * yet been banned due to the [ firehazard ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brunost#accidents ) ? 
  what pisses me off the most is the greens anti-nuclear stance ... we 've built up lots of nuclear waste over the last half-century , and just `` quitting '' now and leaving all the waste is actually irresponsible . 
  what we need is more research in the nuclear field , and generators that can use the current waste which would cut down on the required storage time . 
  if we just close down the current powerplants , we still have the waste . 
  if we 'd figure out how to use the current waste for energy generation , we 'd have fuel for centuries to come in or current waste repositories , and at the same time concentrate the waste . 
  100,000 years of safe storage is impossible to guarantee , but that 's what 's required for our current waste . 
  it we 'd transmute the waste to more highly active waste , it be more dangerous , but for a * much shorter time * . 
  we 'd still have to keep it safe for generations and generations , but ** not ** * 10 times longer than the current history of human civilization * . 
  ... though i agree that * current generation * nuclear powerplants where we only can use 0.7 % of the uranium is n't a sustainable source of energy . 
  i 'm not against wind , solar and hydro , quite the opposite , but far from all regions of the world have suitable conditions for them to work effectively ... and they are n't without environmental drawbacks ; no energy source is . 
  and most importantly , i would very much like to treat our current waste properly * before * phasing out fission ( sometime in the future ) . 
  ... and by then , we 've probably figured out how to make fusion feasible . 
  -- ( and i ca n't understand germany 's decision to close down their nuclear plants prematurely , only to replace it fucking ** coal ** . ), 
  in gothenburg , sweden ; not a chance you 'd find a house .
