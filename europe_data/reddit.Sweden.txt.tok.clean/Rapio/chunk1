by reasonable tax policy then i do n't see why you are complaining . 
  what would stop luxembourg ( and/or other tax-havens ) to lower theirs further in this ` race to the bottom ' scenario of yours ? 
  xubuntu, 
  denmark is the ejaculate of scandinavia . 
  germany is the receiver . 
  so it 's a eurasian saying . 
   maybe in the literal sense of violent thieves and pirates i think you mean glorious adventurers and traders :p, 
  that 's how all danes look . 
  the dutch navy is on a exercise tour in the baltic , i think hms gotland had to abort a day early to look for the ( totally not russian ) sub . 
  how would a separate scottish state solve this and what makes it impossible to solve it in the current system ? 
  [ well it is a big part of valios brand ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ne5up.jpg ), 
  afaik there was an ice plug on denmark letting the sea level of the ` baltic ' rise much higher than what would be realistic for the oceans to rise in total . 
  methane is a stronger greenhouse gas than the corresponding amount of co2, 
  svalbard ? 
  why would you want a state that has a larger population than all the other states put together ? 
  would n't that state pretty much control the house of representatives ? 
  it 's yoghurt-based . 
  you take a [ kebabtallrik ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=kebabtallrik&amp;client=ubuntu&amp;hs=ulg&amp;channel=fs&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=6zatuuwnomhayqpu7ogwcg&amp;ved=0cakq_auoaq&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=915 ) and put it on a pizza . 
  iceland has [ puffin pizza ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9xzq53cidi ) , just saying ... as for the kebab pizza try to order one without the salad ( and fries ) ( most places has all combos on the menu ) . 
   aftonbladet a terrible mix of gossip and leftist/communist political views . 
   ** aftonbladet ** ... leftist/communist political views . 
   ** aftonbladet ** ... ** communist ** ... ** communist ** i do n't think you know what that word means . 
  and your prints will come back in a while ... 
   and let 's not forget that muslims believe quran is the absolute last word of allah , and it can not be altered in any way . 
  i have never understood how this can be such a central theme and yet the hadith exists . 
  adding rules is also a form of alteration , if it 's not included in the quran is n't that a conscious choice of allah ? 
  its not like allah can forget to add something . 
  if a couple of percent of kidnapped brits and irish did n't ruin our culture i do n't see how anything else could . 
  and in tunisia the people ousted their dictator and seems to be progressing towards a more democratic state . 
  no one objected afaik ... 
  there was in egypt ? 
  you forgot tunisia ... oh wait . 
  sure you are ... `` ireland '', 
  libya 1 or libya 2 or maybe the deserted anarchistic wasteland surrounding them ?

  not being for something is not being opposed to it . 
  many swedes probably have a very meh relationship to the whole question . 
  had a fried from iraq who said almost exactly the same thing . 
  new rich depression and communication issues with his former employees if i understood everything correctly . 
  did they pay the fine ? 
  in sweden : government is going to increase various environmental taxes , the opposition is upset that this includes taxes on e85 . 
  chinese company has made an offer to build a high speed rail network for way less than the relevant governmental agency predicted it would cost . 
  notch is sad . 
  it 's a comparison . 
  claiming that the money needed for the shelter of 70 persons is relevant to the budget of any nation do n't really make sense either . 
  i 'm the one posting statistics not you . 
  i for one compare fruit all the time , both apples and oranges can fill the same spot in your diet especially in the aspect of fibre but i do n't see how that 's relevant . 
  yes i too believe that the peoples of syria and libya are fleeing from the imminent lead poisoning of their fields and not at all from the hail of bullets . 
  no i said that considering that many western nation at one point or another took in many times more than 70 refugees without causing any problem what ever . 
  i do n't see any moral defence for the czech not doing so . 
  especially as you used this hospitality in your times of need and now claim to be a part of the west . 
  have you seen the conditions in turkey ? 
  you could also host 500k in a refugee camp it 's not that expensive per capita . 
  but that is not what we are talking about . 
  you think that they should sit in the closest country rotting for ten years waiting for enough retards to kill each other so that some one sane can project enough power to control the area ? 
  11k of the czechoslovakians went to canada and speaking from swedish experiences from hungary i would guess that many fully integrated in society and had children whos children are almost completely assimilated . 
  was that wrong , should these people been interned instead ? 
  but canada 1968 ca n't have been 157 times wealthier than you are now ? 
  as far as the handicapped thing . 
  yes ? 
  canada suposedly took in 11k over night . 
  if you see it as a zero sum game then someone must have lost . 
  then why argue against letting a minuscule number stay ? 
  70 is * nothing * . 
  maybe you should because the same courtesy was extended to your people not that long ago ? 
  should the west have shot the people fleeing the soviet reaction to the prague spring ? 
  maybe returned them like sweden did to the baltic resistance after the war ? 
  how is building a too long tunnel cheaper than a too long bridge ?

  he said [ north africa ] ( http://www.indexmundi.com/g/g.aspx?v=31&amp;c=ag&amp;c=eg&amp;c=ly&amp;c=mo&amp;c=ts&amp;l=en ) which also has a decreasing fertility number . 
  i do n't feel like checking the data for the whole of africa as i find looking at the same trend over and over really boring . 
  what you and others seem to forget or miss is that both statements can be true . 
  the fertility in africa can be going down at the same time as the population is sky rocketing . 
  it 's not the number of young that are going to increase massively in africa it 's the amount of people who survive till their 60s or older . 
  if you watch a talk or two from hans rosling you can notice how he is n't worried about africa he 's worried about congo . 
  [ apparently you can only compare five nations ] ( http://www.indexmundi.com/g/g.aspx?v=31&amp;c=eg&amp;c=ir&amp;c=iz&amp;c=jo&amp;c=le&amp;c=qa&amp;c=sa&amp;c=sy&amp;c=tc&amp;c=ym&amp;l=en ) but they are all going down in a high rate . 
  africa is lagging behind ( as usual ) but the middle east is mostly on track in decreasing fertility . 
  [ no it wo n't ] ( http://www.indexmundi.com/g/g.aspx?c=sy&amp;v=31 ) the fertility is going down worldwide including the middle east . 
  i 'm much more ashamed of giving up baltic resistance fighters to soviet after the war than our assistance to finland . 
  our assistance to finland was very close to the biggest amount possible without joining the war . 
  turning the balts over to soviet was just pointless and horrible . 
  pommern is rightful swedish clay !, 
  dominium maris baltici and all that .

  i still wonder if he 'll leave in five years or if he 'll live there forever . 
  you plan things as an exercise in planning . 
  there is a zombie apocalypse plan for the us . 
  afaik they learnt a lot about asymmetric struggles and planing for them . 
  why would whistleblowers be protected from justice for the rapes they commit ? 
  he is in voluntary prison that seems worse than swedish ones and has to stay for another five years to gain anything . 
  but where is here ? 
  you think that you are living in ` finland ' but what is that really ? 
  are your seas even salty ? 
  are you sure that you are n't just by a big lake like v\u00e4nern or something ? 
  bureaucrats , the stupid lizards ca n't remember the leap years system .
