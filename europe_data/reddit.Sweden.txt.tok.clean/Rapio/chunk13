  in may 2015 stopped mohamed yasmin and amin least twice by turkish border police . 
  they were chased by police on the greek island of kos , but managed to enter turkey for a third time and finally reached his goal : syria . 
  during his trip to syria spring and summer of 2015 continued mohamed qadar to photograph and post images on @ thunder gullan account . 
  friends , family and sapo could follow online \u00f6rebro devices attempt to come to war . 
  an image of a boat with greek flag . 
  a photo of the back board of a young man standing on some mountains in the distance , with a mohamed 's comment : '' #thedream '' . 
  and so , when they finally reached syria : an evening image of young men with backpacks move forward in the terrain . 
  in august reached mohamed qadars parents of the news that their eldest son had been killed . 
  once they had fled somalia to avoid a war . 
  now the war had taken both liban mohamed , even though they grew up in the peaceful sweden . 
  four of their sons had gone to fight . 
  only two of them survived . 
  - the parents have worked so hard to get their children not to go . 
  how do they do it anyway , says mahdi warsama from the compound of the horn of africa where many somali swedes are members . 
  mahdi warsama remember mohamed qadar was angry at him after liban killed . 
  he did not like the mahdi warsama spoke out in the media , and uttered criticism of is and vivalla residents who went to war .

  how are scotcheggs stopped ? 
  when i think about it they wo n't become chickens so that 's kinda foiled . 
  the eu is also funding the restoration of rivers in norrland ( repairing damage caused by the woodcutting industry a hundred years ago ) . 
  i think you underestimate the will to maintain the status quo in the general public . 
   yes . . it is ? 
  that article said nothing about the level of utilisation of the hydro power as far as i could see . 
  i have read reports from svk or maybe stattnet or entso-e ( baltic sea region probably ) about the price separation of different zones in the nordic grid you could clearly see that regions in norway separated with lower price ( [ as you can see that they are right now ( 09:30 11.05.2016 ) ] ( http://www.statnett.no/en/market-and-operations/data-from-the-power-system/nordic-power-flow/ ) ) . 
  as the grid in the nordics is a free market the only way to get a lower price in one area than the others is to have restrictions in the grid . 
  [ here you have a graph over the reservoir levels of different years ] ( http://wwwdynamic.nordpoolspot.com/marketinfo/rescontent/area/rescontent.cgi ) [ here is the same on nordpool ] ( http://nordpoolspot.com/market-data1/power-system-data/hydro-reservoir1/all/hourly/?view=chart ) as hydro stands for 95 % of norways electricity production and 50 % of swedens i would say that there is production at all time . 
  how much of it that could have been stored to a later time is a harder question to answer but looking at that graph i would guessed at much after the melt of in spring . 
  as for offsetting of base load , sweden and norway is together aiming for 26twh/yr in new renewable production before 2020 with the current subsidy scheme and it seems to be working as in sweden currently ~ 500mw of wind power is built every year . 
  the point is n't that scandinavia can power the whole of eu with it 's hydro the point is that we have a battery corresponding to something like [ 3100 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/d/d9/net_electricity_generation%2c_1990%e2%80%932013_%28thousand_gwh%29_yb15.png ) / [ 80 ] ( http://wwwdynamic.nordpoolspot.com/marketinfo/rescontent/area/rescontent.cgi ) \u2243 9days of the european grids average operation ? 
  and turkey has similar capacity and the alps is n't total shit . 
  i 'm not the one arguing for a monolithic grid built on one energy-source , you at least seem to . 
  i 'm mostly arguing that the pan-european grid we are building will alleviate most of the problems of intermittency . 
  no it is n't . 
  the grid improvements and international cables that norway is building is partly to decrease the need of letting water go to not overflow the dams . 
  and secondly today it 's used as base power not top power that means that there is a big unutilised capacity to balance dips in wind or sun . 
  2000km is something like 2 hours in longitude but more importantly its enough in latitude to avoid the seasonal day length difference in the north . 
  but most importantly 2000km is enough to span several different climate zones which is very relevant for wind generation . 
  the non-east is a bit sensitive on the whole semi-secret concentration camps where we are supposed to store ( hundreds ? 
  of ) thousands of people . 
  i 'm too mostly for some kind of solution with camps at the boarders where you can seek asylum and every country gets to set most of their rules . 
  however i think that we should also let people file for asylum at embassies so we do n't get as many economic migrants mixed in with the refugees .

  the vaalserberg is 323 m. ** above ** sea level . 
   you are living in a pure wishful world and have no knowledge of how interconnections work . 
    it 's crazily inefficient to send electricity over thousands of kilometers [ 7 % loss for moving 6gw 2000km ] ( http://new.abb.com/systems/hvdc/references/xiangjiaba---shanghai ) does n't seem `` crazily inefficient '' to me . 
  for the record that 's the distance between madrid and berlin or stockholm and rome . 
  europe has one of the best storage situations in the world with the amount of hydro available in scandinavia . 
  with the addition of the alps and eastern turkey it looks great for us . 
  you should really check the tynd-plan developed by entso-e , the paneuropean grid is already a fact and it 's strengthening continuously . 
  harmonisation of refugee management is in my opinion the only way to have freedom of movement within the union and having passport checks [ here ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/baarle-nassau_fronti%c3%a8re_caf%c3%a9.jpg ) feels counter productive to me . 
  the population of sweden at least voted for eu . 
  i have never seen any coherent proposals as to what to change to make eu ` right ' . 
  it usually ends with `` make it more democratic '' and `` give the nations more veto rights '' which are two mostly opposing concepts imho .
