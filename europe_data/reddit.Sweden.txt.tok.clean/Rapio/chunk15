  and the eu are the unreasonable ones here ? 
  what kind of engineer ? 
  xenophobia is wider than racism as it also covers people who are bigoted against other religions or cultural customs . 
  ethnic discrimination includes more cultural aspects than racism does . 
  that 's my interpretation of the nuances in the nomenclature to describe bigotry . 
  eastern europeans know how working plumbing looks . 
   fairly short life expectancy 20 years with no real maintenance is short ? 
  and afaik most panels that have reached their ` end of life ' still produce a significant amount of energy compared to what they produced when new . 
  what is the function of these regions ? 
  in sweden our counties are only responsible for medical care and public transport . 
  is it the same in norway ? 
  so the two brown ones surrounding oslo are n't touching currently ? 
  according to swedish wiki the gains from having higher temperatures is countered by the lower density so having high pressure steam is a net loss . 
  you also get less of your energy production in the form of electricity if you take it out as steam , as it 's hotter . 
  so i would still guess that this is superheated water as is the rest of the system . 
  the homepage of tekniskaverken is not very helpful = /, 
  they use something similar to [ einstein refridgerators ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/einstein_refrigerator ) to generate cooling from the heat of the system closer to the end user . 
  i think the area they are building for the expo this summer is getting district cooling that is generated that way . 
  it 's not steam anywhere in sweden afaik . 
  we use hot water pipes to transport heat ~ 30km ( from link\u00f6ping to mj\u00f6lby ) so close is a relative term . 
  in this case relative to the insulation of your pipes . 
  the 2 % could be accelerationists , there are people who want trump in power so that he can fuck everything up , implode the republican party and thus lead to some form of progressive domination of us politics for a couple of decades . 
  or they just really really hate free trade . 
   there is nothing the world can do besides maintain sanctions . 
  but how long will we do that before we give up and acknowledge reality ? 
  forever ? 
  70 years seems like a good start at least . 
  what happened to the nation that did n't recognize the soviets illegal occupation of the baltics ? 
  if russia is n't willing to play by the rules there is no reason to engage with them . 
  i hope the eu will reach a point where we can start to sanction their gas as well . 
  well ... 
  it would solve the problem of connecting azerbaijani gas to the eu gasgrid without external unreliable partners . 
  i added the statistics form [ entso-e ] ( https://www.entsoe.eu/db-query/production/monthly-production-for-all-countries ) for 2015 ( last complete yearly dataset ( wth ) ) and got : 836twh of nuclear , 1360twh of fossils , 545twh of renewable and a separate post for 569twh of hydro . 
  that would be something like 1/6 of the total production from renewables - hydro . 
  i have to look at the other document to see if hydro was separate there too without me noticing . 
   this data may not be used without mentioning the source : ` data provided by entso-e ' i wonder if this applies to internet forums ... 
  give albion back to the albino diaspora !!, 
  china is moving faster than the eu . 
  i think that 25 % renewable and 12 % nuclear and an increase of renewable with 2 % every year is pretty ok , especially considering that some nations are doing all they can to stop the expansion . 
  [ `` data provided by entso-e '' ] ( https://www.entsoe.eu/data/data-portal/production/pages/default.aspx ), 
  production capacity of the eu is ish 994gw if the installed renewable capacity last year was 21 gw that was 2 % . 
  in one year . 
  there is data on this on entso-es site, 
  i do n't see why that would n't be possible but afaik they use completely different cable standards for hvdc and ac . 
  ac wires being bare and hvdc being insulated even when hung overhead . 
  but there is a project in germany where they are going to hang a hvdc cable in existing pylons right along an existing ac cable , so that will be interesting . 
  something like 30-40 % of swedens electricity production is in norrland and most of the consumption is in svealand and g\u00f6taland . 
  the distance from the [ largest hydro plant in sweden ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/harspr%c3%a5nget_hydroelectric_power_station ) to stockholm is about 850km , about the same as the distance from paris to berlin . 
  i ca n't remember any sources for that from the top of my head . 
  [ soon ] ( https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/pci_2_7_en_2015.pdf ), 
  [ it seems to have been 6 % in 2014 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/synchronous_grid_of_continental_europe#electricity_island_networks ) i think it was in the ` ten year network development plan ' from entso-e from last year that they said that the uk was not expected to reach the goal by 2020 . 
  i think all members ( including the uk if projects do n't get cancelled ) will reach the 2020 goal by 2025 . 
  the opposition to projects of strategic importance for aesthetic reasons is something only undertaken by fools and cunts . 
  putting the interests of the people in some village somewhere above the interests of the nation and the union is not a sane way of following the law . 
  if you can expand and improve your highways you should be able to do the same with the grid . 
  the existing ac lines are already used to their max in most locations . 
  germany have been hanging extra cables in existing corridors to try to mitigate issues . 
  it works but it 's not enough . 
  cyprus will reach its interconnection goal . 
  they are building a cable from israel via cyprus via crete to greece . 
  [ pci paper ] ( https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/pci_3_10_1_en_2015.pdf ) the israel-cyprus and greece-crete will be done before 2020 . 
  it 's not like having more wind power would make you import even more energy from sweden either way ... 
  most people do n't care that much . 
  we are building grids at a very high rate in most of europe right now and outside germany most are able to reach their goals . 
  as for how to motivate other countries ? 
  i do n't understand why people needs to be convinced to get cheaper energy and local infrastructure improved by external financing . 
  but if they do n't want it then it 's feasible to just lay the cable on the bottom of the adriatic all the way up to venice at least . 
  the problem for germany is not cost or effort in maintenance it 's nimbyism . 
  they have tried for a decade now to build those hvdc lines from north germany to south . 
  they are considered projects of common interest for the eu because better integrating the grids of europe would enable a integrated market . 
  that would massively lower the costs for the consumers . 
  but germans seems to be scared of electro magnetism so they keep appealing the projects and bogging them down in courts and stuff . 
  the eu is already financing the building of a fully interconnected grid in europe . 
  all * nations of the eu will have over 10 % interconnection with its neighbours before 2020 . 
  \\* except spain and maybe the uk now, 
  that is not a technology issue . 
  you do n't have a energy transfer issue in germany you have a nimby issue . 
  the problem is that your transfer projects do n't get built because they get bogged down in endless appeals . 
  the losses of transferring electricity with hvdc such relatively short distances as southern italy to berlin is less than the loss of the lower solar irradiation at the higher latitude . 
  source : [ here ] ( http://pvshop.eu/public/assets/images/sun_irradiation_europe.jpg ) or [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fq6gf3z.png ) you can see that the difference between southern italy and the middle of germany is about a factor of two . 
  [ here ] ( http://new.abb.com/systems/hvdc/references/xiangjiaba---shanghai ) you can see a reference of a project that transfers 6.5 gw continuously with a loss of about 7 % for a distance that is ~ 1.5 of what i discussed above and it was commissioned in 2010 so losses should be lower on a newer system . 
  distance between southern italy and berlin is [ 1300km ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=distance+neaples+berlin ) btw . 
  hepa-filter backpacks for the rich and face-masks for the poor , 
   democratic plight i hope you mean duty . 
  yeah like when people boycotted your stupid vote on ukrainian relations with the eu ... 
   as if we live in sweden or somewhere wut ? 
  we do n't boycott any election ever . 
  that is not a thing . 
  finland would have been integrated into novgorod before it was a part of russia . 
  yeah who did start the [ great northern war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_northern_war ) ... no one is innocent in history . 
  you do n't just find an empire lying around and pick it up . 
   can your nation finally forget poltava and shit ? 
  it has never been about poltava for us . 
  that 's your thing . 
  for us it was about finland and to a lesser extent estonia . 
  but the real problem of your vision of two centuries of peace is that we have during these received constant reaffirmation that it 's just temporary , that the russians has in no way given up on the idea of controlling the baltic sea . 
  the downing of a swedish dc-3 spy plane over international waters and whiskey on the rocks are just two very public and obvious cold war examples of this . 
  so after two decades of a weakened russia with no major incidents with the west in general or sweden in particular , the culture of suspicion was starting to diminish in sweden but then georgia happened , and then the gas wars with ukraine and eastern eu , and then crimea , and the ukraine . 
  why should sweden not expect the baltic sea to be the focus of conflict again ? 
  why would a resurgent , aggressive , and neighbour annexing russia ignore sweden for the first time in both of their histories ?
