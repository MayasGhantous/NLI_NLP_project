  the same can be said of the european military industrial complex . 
  i think that the emu should create its own transfer system that is above and beyond the cohesion funds , but an usian policy seems neither applicable or wanted . 
  and for the eu it 's what 50 ? 
  [ romania will be allocated ish 23 billion $ between 2014 and 2020 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/information/cohesion-policy-achievement-and-future-investment/factsheet/romania_en.pdf ) . 
  their annual budget is 225 billion lei ( according to wiki ) so if i did n't google convert wrong they get something like half an annual budget extra over six years , mostly in infrastructure investment . 
  that is in no fucking way nothing . 
  hasuteras made a post containing one false claim . 
  i pointed out that that claim was false . 
  that does not in any way mean that i do n't think the emu needs a bigger transfer system . 
  did anything in your post have anything to do with mine ? 
  i cant agree that investing 1/3 of 1.1 % of the total gdp of the eu in the poorest ish 1/3 ( by area ( yeah i know by area is dumb ) ) is practically nothing . 
   the eu does not have that . 
  `` the regional policy of the european union ( eu ) , also referred as cohesion policy , is a policy with the stated aim of improving the economic well-being of regions in the eu and also to avoid regional disparities . 
  more than one third of the eu 's budget is devoted to this policy , which aims to remove economic , social and territorial disparities across the eu , restructure declining industrial areas and diversify rural areas which have declining agriculture . 
  in doing so , eu regional policy is geared towards making regions more competitive , fostering economic growth and creating new jobs . 
  '' [ -- wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regional_policy_of_the_european_union ) it 's not enough but claiming there is no redistribution is just false . 
   why would medical ngo participate in a political process exactly ? 
  try to convince politicians to treat the sufferers of hiv maybe ? 
  because the central government prioritises their interconnection more than the pan-european one ? 
  you can see in short how the funds are allocated on [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/structural_funds_and_cohesion_fund#funds_management ) also that map is from 2014 [ from wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:europe_completed_motorways.png ) . 
  the highway network that the eu wants is something like [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:international_e_road_network_green.png ) ( but on a modern map and probably a few more ) and the current status in romania is [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:romania_motorways_de.svg ) . 
  and as you can see that connections between the capital and the western border is under construction . 
  one of those is not like the others ... 
   a blue flag gold star sparks a brand new empire wth ... 
  i assumed that they were left out and did n't count the number of countries that are included as it 's a common problem on these kinds of maps . 
  denmark seems to be rebuilding their whole network right now . 
  i might be able to go to spain with a nice layover/weekend in marseilles in just five years or so !, 
  they might build that tunnel to estonia . 
  but no i was n't suggesting replacing all track in finland , rather that not including the baltics was extra unfair as finland was included . 
  after the turin-lyon line is completed [ it will take 4h from paris to milano . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turin%e2%80%93lyon_high-speed_railway#the_new_line ) it takes at least 2h and 48 min from milano to rome today . 
  thus paris to rome would take ish 6h 48min . 
  pretty close to half of 11:30 ( much closer than i thought after looking at [ this map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/high_speed_railroad_map_of_europe.svg ) . 
  eight years is n't long in eu-time . 
  the eu generally works on a different time scale than most other systems . 
  the decision to ban halogen spotlights from 2018 and onwards was taken 2009/2012 ( depending on your view of the world ) . 
  so for something much more complex like banking reforms to take a decade or one and a half does n't feel surprising . 
  shh shh shh , there there , everything is fine . 
  it was all just a bad dream . 
  we would never abandon you to the ruskies , there there . 
  if denmark just fixed its shitty rails i could get to barcelona from sweden in less then a day . 
  but nooo it was totally unreasonable to start the improvement of the lines to the mainland before they started building fehrmanbelt . 
  finland also has shit gauge . 
   plus the counter part kind of hints at something , wonder what it is ? 
  propaganda maybe ? 
  if you look at them they are obviously designed to cause as much annoyance among the russian population as possible while harming the weakest parts of the european economy . 
  if you do know what the sanctions are and do then why do you want to end them ? 
  what do you gain from a bunch of oligarchs getting to go to the eu for their vacations again ? 
  the eu ending it 's sanctions does in no way guarantee that your government will end the sanctions that harm you as they seem to be an effective tool for internal control . 
  the sanctions that are hurting you are the russian counter sanctions . 
  so apparently you do n't know who imposed the sanctions . 
  the lawyers duty is to his client not society . 
   what does the govt do for the suicide problem ? 
  i do n't know about finland , but based on what they are doing in sweden i would guess a lot . 
  much effort over the years has been put into decreasing the stigma of having mental issues . 
  lots of resources is being spent on preventing suicide among teenagers with time spent talking about it in school and free mental care available for youths . 
  they are also slowly suicide proofing all infrastructure , all major rail lines have new fences in urban areas and bridges are being tackled depending on their respective statistics . 
  it was pushed by a lot of people . 
  scandinavia was quite happy when it closed . 
  the baltics are a special case as the eu forced them to close their old rotting soviet nuclear plant . 
  we ` owed ' them compensation so that 's why eu has paid for large parts of the electricity interconnections between lithuania and sweden/poland . 
  [ here ] ( http://tyndp.entsoe.eu/reference/#map ) is an interactive map of all coming eu ( at least part ) financed projects for the electricity grid . 
  entso - ** g ** have a much shittier web presence so i have n't found any concise resource on that part . 
  you do know that the union is working on a energy union right ? 
  many if not all of the energy infrastructure projects right now in the baltics are at least partly funded by the eu . 
  tell that to entso-e . 
  the german nimby plague is real =(, 
  it 's really nice when you are there , the wood frames makes it feel more alive than most glass cubes . 
  the express-way that is buried between it and the berlaymont really ruins the feel of the area though . 
  and the trench surrounding the berlaymont gives a weird vibe . 
  ehh stop being so fatalistic . 
  i think it would do the british good to have a standard eu deal with the normal amounts of * s. oh you should rejoin and make the same deal denmark has for the faroes but for scotland . 
  it would be hilarious . 
  you can get it again when you are candidates , 
  firstly stopping something that has been going on for decades is creating change no matter if you reverse the previous change or not . 
  my town has gotten waves of immigration every decade now since the war and stopping that would be a big change even if you did n't deport the third generation greeks or the ones who were children when they fled the balkans in the 90s . 
  my cultural group is used to infusions of a mix of new poor and people with basic medical skills . 
  stopping this would change my life considerably . 
  secondly when did the goalpost shift to ` non-indigeneus to europe ' last time i checked here the ` right ' was a against all immigration from outside the nordics and people from the balkans are especially not welcome . 
  my ethnically half-french half-swedish so is according to some not swedish and should probably be deported . 
  if you already live in a hetrogenic place ( like many cities in the west ) the arguments you are using are against the status quo . 
  it sounds like you want to change the cities into something they have n't been for between 50 and 200 years ( depending on place ) . 
  my point is what you see as rational protecting your way of life can from the other side be seen as meddling in theirs . 
  they did n't even have a milk option either =(, 
  which do you prefer on a pizza with fries and garlic/chilli-sauce on top ? 
   on electricity , blackouts are almost unheard of , and the electrical socket output is reliable and regular . 
  [ the united states endures more blackouts than any other developed nation as the number of u.s. power outages lasting more than an hour have increased steadily for the past decade , according to federal databases at the department of energy ( doe ) and the north american electric reliability corp. 
  ( nerc ) . 
  ] ( http://www.ibtimes.com/aging-us-power-grid-blacks-out-more-any-other-developed-nation-1631086 ) i agree with most of your other points , but your national grid is quite shit . 
  the pan-eu grid will be better by 2020 and that 's quite sad considering your head start and clearer motives . 
  should n't there be protest from within the movement if this is a fringe opinion ? 
  i at least try to avoid assigning myself labels that stand for things that i 'm against . 
  did you just triple a number in a rounding ? 
  relevant user name ? 
  expensive and slow to build . 
  in the time it takes to build a nukeplant you will have half of your money back already from investing in wind . 
  it 's 10 % in 10 years as the current goal is 20 % by 2020 and afaik that goal is reached/going to be reached . 
  it 's very possible that most of the last bit is expected to be reached by the same methods that gave us the first 20 . 
  banning of the last light bulbs and putting up energy-rating shame posters on every new building . 
  it 's energy use so the source or type of end usage is irrelevant .
