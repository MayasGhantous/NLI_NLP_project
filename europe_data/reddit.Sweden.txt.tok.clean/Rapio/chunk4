  is n't that weird with the whole [ sigismund ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sigismund_iii_vasa ) happening tying our countries and all ? 
  with that said i learnt about the commonwealth from games . 
  they would n't shut up about sigismund but neglected to explain anything about lithuanias relationship with poland ... 
  you say that now but then after four years it 's all [ `` you are too high maintenance !, 
  when will you pay your rent !? 
  '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/skirmish_at_bender ) . 
  naah probably fishing and aluminium . 
  is n't that the flag of palau ? 
  and if were going to change flag it 's definitely to [ sillsallad 2 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/union_mark_of_norway_and_sweden ) scandinavic boogaloo . 
  in polandball : yes in reality : no,

   abba every one likes [ pickled herring ] ( https://static.mathem.se/shared/images/products/large/inlagd-sill-240g-abba-1578909153.jpg ), 
  yes that is the meaning of the word . 
  three times more expensive than coal sounds rather good for a form of energy that has barely left the lab . 
  and you are not including the unincluded externalities inherent to coal . 
  what in that quote makes it infeasible ? 
  all i read was :  potential . 
  could , if not monitored . 
  vary greatly . 
   can , can , and may . 
  as with all danish inventions you can already buy a [ superior swedish alternative ] ( http://www.seabased.com/en/ ) !, 
  well obviously canada is alfred ... 
  does that make eu the teen titans ? 
  [ the assassination of olof palme ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/assassination_of_olof_palme#murder_theories ) has many conspiracy theories surrounding it . 
  i personally think loop troop did it . 
  the famous gratitude of right wing finns , it warms my heart ... 
  i apologise for the iloyalty of my forefathers government who only saw fit to give one flight regiment to a nation they had no alliance with . 
   those few who went against the mainstream in sweden at the time and came to help us wut ? 
  8260 volunteer men who bought weapons from the swedish army with funds that they collected by mass donations from the public was against the mainstream ? 
  have you tried it ? 
  a cliff in the netherlands ? 
  looks like some kind of tropicana or maybe honolulu , the cheese usually is on top i think . 
  i think that the kebabpizza evolved from putting a [ kebabtallrik ] ( http://cdn1.cdnme.se/cdn/7-2/1025826/images/2010/img_0600_116647046.jpg ) on top of a normal vesuvio pizza so the meat , fries , sauce and salad goes on top of the ham and cheese . 
  you really should try to do that to a kebabpizza, 
  it sounds like it since the fbi seems to be involved . 
  it 's probably ricin not sarin . 
  people are saying it 's probably ricin . 
  it is on the chemical weapons level of poisons , so it 's pretty serious . 
  in the press release from the police they said it was one of the chemicals on [ list 1 in this document ] ( http://www.isp.se/documents/regelverk/cwc/cwc_bilaga1.pdf ), 
  i never thought i would say this but is pasta more expensive in hungary than elsewhere ( specifically sweden ) ? 
  the cheapest shitpasta you can get here is somewhere in the area of .5 to 1 $ / kg, 
  the pan-european dictators suck day . 
  if you click on the names you can see how it was calculated . 
  i have actually had the discussion `` no not that shitty title about subject x !, 
  the much worse one bellow ! '', 
  posts tend to come in clumps as news of world events reach different media . 
  you can tell your coworkers/spouse/stranger to read the post without having to send them a link . 
  `` hey , greger look at the comments to post 23 on europe !, 
  it 's a total shit show ! '', 
   our central bank suggested forcing bank offices to handle cash by law , even . 
  the banks were furious . 
  that is happening one way or another , there was some sort of eu-directive about it if i remember correctly . 
  it 's supposed to go into effect in autumn . 
   the most important reason : ever tried paying with a card at the bakery ? 
  yes , it works excellently . 
  also works at many stands in farmers markets and such . 
  sweden had a system of debit cards before visa and master card came here so the plastic has never really gotten the credit stigma . 
  the traceability of cards also makes tax avoidance much harder . 
  how was belgium safer 2011 than now ? 
   on 13 december 2011 , a murder -- suicide attack took place in the city of li\u00e8ge in the wallonia region of belgium.the attacker , 33-year-old nordine amrani , threw grenades and fired an fn fal rifle at civilians on saint-lambert square . 
  the attack killed six and left 125 others injured ; seven of whom suffered serious injuries . 
  amrani then committed suicide by shooting himself with a revolver . 
  earlier that day , he had also murdered a woman in his house . 
  he had a grudge against society . 
  it 's a british architecture show about people who renovating or building new interesting homes . 
  most of it is on youtube . 
  have you seen grand designs ? 
  it 's hilarious sometimes , they talk about triple pane windows like it 's some / r/futurology post . 
  ** ` one day we will all have access to this new technology these house builders are importing from the continent !, 
  but that 's the greatest thing that has come out of eurovision !, 
  it 's the strongest ( and the only needed ) argument for ukrainian eu-membership . 
  the english do n't believe in insulation so it 's probably extra heaters and shit .

  [ here ] ( http://nordpoolspot.com/market-data1/#/nordic/map ) is a map with the spot-price for electricity tomorrow for nordics , baltics and gb without direct taxes . 
  this price is generally quite a bit higher for gb than most countries . 
  he has at least expressed repentance and has joined exit an anti-extremist organisation for former extremists but there seems to be quite a while before he gets out as his application to get a timed sentence until 2026 was denied a while ago . 
  drug dealers do n't get life and i hope that you are n't arguing containment until euthanasia for all drug dealers ? 
  i was talking about people like [ leif axmyr ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leif_axmyr ), 
  most psychopaths have been taught a working cost analysis and are able to stay out of trouble i see no reason for the criminal ones to not be able to do that . 
  why have a different system for the worst couple of criminals per million in population ? 
  it 's not worth it some of them will get better some wont . 
  i think you ca n't know whos going to recover and whos not . 
  it 's not that hard to tell when a nazi of one sort or the other is getting better , breivik is obviously not there yet and he might never get there . 
  and more to the point the system saves money as the reoffending rate is lower . 
  treating prisoners like they are sick with a mental condition works . 
  punishing them does n't . 
  i for one find it more satisfying to see them repent than being shot . 
  he could at the earliest be released in 17 years that does n't mean that it will happen . 
  abortion is n't seen as something horrible here so it 's a rather meh name . 
  judicial suicide feels kinda gothy though . 
  she is called holy in swedish too not saint . 
  if you look at entso-e tyndp report for the south-west continental grid you can see that another hvdc project is planned to connect spain and france over biscay in 2023 and other projects will improve the interconnection before that . 
  after 2020 it gets a bit more scetchy but they are looking at an interconnection between spain france and england and/or spain france italy and another bunch of stuff in the pyrenees . 
  france was blocking any interconnection for a long time but that has changed with the new eu goal . 
  if the price in iberia is lower than that of france every time the wind blows they will continue to build new power lines until that effect is n't relevant any more . 
  that 's at least what 's happening in scandinavia and the continent . 
  they are building the interconnections right now . 
  i do n't remember if portugal is going to pass the goal of 10 % interconnection before 2020 or if it was just after . 
  spain wont but there are planned projects for after 2020 i think .
