  and hopefully ( and probably ) we will get a higher goal looking forwards . 
  tl ; dr : the common grid is coming . 
  well it 's not illegal to marry your first cousin in sweden so ... what ? 
  to be fair norway already was a member of the nordic customs union before joining eea and as such already had some free movement . 
   [ advocaat ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/advokat ) seems a bit dry to me, 
  eastern poland is a ripe investment opportunity . 
  i mostly agree with you but a tree farm is n't a forest . 
  the lack of woods older than 90 years is very detrimental to our ecology . 
  well the last word is obviously tortilla so i guess finland is going to open a taco bell in support of the battle against daesh . 
  it 's not really possible to fix that issue within representative democracy and changing the system to a more direct democratic one seems like a pipe dream . 
  those rivers are in the northern ~ 2/3 of the country no one lives there . 
  there is no gigantic nimby movement that can dump loads of shit in the streets of the capital or other things that happens when you ignore the century old rape wounds on nature in populated parts of the countryside . 
  the only party that would 've prioritised fixing this problem does n't get that many voters in the affected areas as they want to end subsidies of fossil fuels and such . 
  so yes the problem is a problem with our democratic system and sure we could fix it with some sort of more directdemocratic system but i do n't find that solution probable and thus i enjoy the rightful undermining of our democracy by the eu . 
  i too agree ... 
  i see the supportive investments in infrastructure in the eastern part of the eu as a important and neccisary part . 
  eu invests in lots of stuff where the host nation is n't capable or interested in investing . 
  in sweden eu-funded projects reconstruct rivers that were destroyed by the logging industry a century ago , sweden would never have prioritized those projects . 
  i 'm pretty convinced that us paying eu who pays us to do it is the only reason it 's getting done at all . 
  lithuania would n't have afforded to rebuild their grid without support but it was necessary , both for them but also for their neighbours . 
  the infrastructure goals are great , not perfect but great . 
  i find the idea that the southern suburbs of gothenburg would leave sweden without it hilarious . 
  / u/vonadler teller of history and creator of content . 
  no homes for esti, 
  my memory of documentaries about it is that the captain said that he and to officers still on board had clear orders to destroy the sub including nuclear armaments in case of any swedish attempts to take the sub . 
  they choose to let it go rather than best case have the equivalent of a dirty bomb go of outside of karlskrona . 
  saying that discrimination based on race takes a second or third chair to discrimination based on faith and cultural ties in europe , especially southern europe , is n't saying that racism does n't exist . 
  and g\u00f6tar are not svear , sk\u00e5ne is n't g\u00f6tar , v\u00e4rml\u00e4nningar definently are n't svear ! . . 
  do n't get me started on the inclusion of gotland in g\u00f6taland !, 
  you are exaggerating . 
  there are lots of discrimination in europe that 's based on race . 
  it 's just on top of a gigantic system of discrimination by ethnicity . 
  especially blacks are faced with a lot classic racism and ethnicity is often not taken into account , at least at first . 
  or that is at least my experience in these parts , i have n't been to southern europe for a decade or so . 
  the post you answered to was n't about racism . 
  the lobstering is red and leads to cancer , there is no need to wait for the blood . 
  i was referring to all brits that turn into lobsters as soon as they see the sun . 
  does n't the english have a more direct connection between the sun and red ? 
  afaik the ypj/g ca n't cross the euphrates without being bombed by turkey and the rest of the sdf is n't even close to being able to pull of something like that without their support . 
   try jihadist light !, 
  it 's all of that gulf backed fanaticism without any of that harsh daeshy taste !, 
   she is basically enemy of the turks in people 's mind now that you have a common enemy will greeks and turks stop bickering ? 
  ahh the good old days when i could n't go to the netherlands to consult on an italian machine sold to a dutch company by a swedish one without piles of paperwork . 
  you guys have a very negative view of eu , if eu wanted to do something eu would be very efficient at getting it done . 
  you are talking about a massive infrastructure project after all ... 
  it would be right up it 's favourite alley . 
  comity meetings for standardisations on concrete walls . 
  private-public partnerships with shady backscratchy deals . 
  they could build a wall that would make israel jealous . 
  ** if ** they wanted to . 
  then they will have to stop voting for politicians who want them to ? 
  where they right on the sausages ? 
  or the limiting of poles right to work in the whole of eu when they joined ? 
  that they are right on one thing or two does n't make the constant and perpetual whining any less annoying . 
  it 's the same level of noise when they rightly complain about the euro being unstable with the current system and when they are n't allowed to call the pork things they have for breakfast sausages any more . 
  that it 's a non-news ? 
  * ** ukraine is poor !, 
  ** * read all about it !, 
  they are not subject to as much political pressure and change of funding as many of the other space agencies so they can actually plan things in advance . 
  trade , plunder , colonize . 
  it 's all good . 
   they were trading peacefully . 
  source ? 
  my understanding is that they settled and got in to conflicts with the locals and left/died because of it . 
  but i 'm not a historian .

   globalism by the left liberals the liberals are n't left and the left is n't ` pushing ' globalism . 
  https://diem25.org/manifesto-long/#1455748561092-7b8f1d50-a8c2  * eu council , ecofin , ftt and eurogroup meetings to be live-streamed  * minutes of european central bank governing council meetings to be published a few weeks after the meetings have taken place  * all documents pertinent to crucial negotiations ( e.g. 
  trade-ttip , ` bailout ' loans , britain 's status ) affecting every facet of european citizens ' future to be uploaded on the web  * a compulsory register for lobbyists that includes their clients ' names , their remuneration , and a record of meetings with officials ( both elected and unelected ) the first three would render the eu and all institutions unable to handle anything more sensitive than the curvature of bananas . 
  the fourth is already implemented as a voluntary system . 
  yes it should be mandatory but it keeps getting lobbied into the ground ( for some reason ) . 
  that whole site seems like a civil version of ukip . 
  and why is there a pic of assange there , he 's australian ( right ? 
  centrism and populism are not opposites . 
  they are just rarely combined . 
  v4 should do the same . 
  it 's not about the actual council but i would asume that france ( and morocco ? 
  ) would be observing members . 
  one of the more important missions of the nordic council is that all differences between legislation in the nordics should be deliberate . 
  so many laws are identical except for things that are different in that nation . 
  is n't the compelling case against le pen that she is a corrupt foreign financed asshole ? 
  it would be building further on the structure that ` neo-libs ' ( as you choose to view them ) constructed . 
  if creating a market for something is the most pragmatic solution so be it . 
  if it 's not try to homogenize the rules between as many nations as possible , is there a nordic council of iberia ? 
  a true ` radical ' centrist movement would ( in my very leftwing view of everything ) cut trough the bullshit of how or why and try to see what people want and then try to achieve it in the most efficient way possible . 
  i would say the most populist centric policy is a aggressive eu anti corruption agency . 
  but most of it is probably public/private partnerships on infrastructure as that is what eu seems to be best at . 
  pragmatic centrism of doing that which we have in common seem radical in most peoples views . 
  i hope the cooperation moves forward , i do . 
  there was quite a big deal of optimism about this project in sweden at the time . 
  i 'm just saying that that optimism died with the gripen and archer deals . 
  when the prime and defence ministers talk about nordic cooperation they talk about finland nowadays not norway . 
  from a swedish perspective the biggest lesson of ww2 was that we have to make our own materials because when we need it the most no one will sell , and the things we do manage to buy will be stolen and used to invade france . 
  this mentality is still very present in how swedish politicians and media talks about defence , so when one of our neighbours reject our materials in favour of materials made outside of the nordics ( or worse europe ) it is partly seen as a undermining of our defence doctrine . 
  this view is mostly not valid any more especially for projects like fighter jets which we could n't build without access to the international market anyhow but the idea lingers . 
  afaik it was norway that stalled the archer project . 
  demanding a cheap system built with parts of the shelf that remains nbc protected while firing is a bit much . 
  as for the trucks that was an obvious shit show as a project ( in hindsight ) sweden and norway both wanted trucks but beyond that had not a single demand in common .
