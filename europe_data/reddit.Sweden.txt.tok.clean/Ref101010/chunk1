sometimes the lower tuition fees are residency based rather than citizenship based . 
  yes , good point . 
  a citizenship might help with residency though . 
   you do n't start magically not eating once you go to university . 
  that 's why i said `` in many of those countries you 'd also be eligible for universal financial aid covering your living costs while studying '' . 
  personally saved up college funds are pretty much unheard of in many parts of europe ^ ( edit : though many students also have * some * money saved from earlier in life ; for emergencies and unforeseen expenses )  ... going to university an ocean away from all your friends and family may not be the right choice for a lot of people . 
  that 's very true . 
   that money could be a contribution toward a college fund with a eu citizenship , you would n't necessarily * need * a college fund as education on all levels are free in many parts of eu ... and on top of access to tuition free universities , in many of those countries you 'd also be eligible for universal financial aid covering your living costs while studying ( ~ 30 % subsidized `` student allowance '' , ~ 70 % student loan ) . 
  -- edit : the downside is of course that you have to move to a country outside the us to study then . 
  though it 's also not without benefit , as some years abroad gives you * a lot * of interesting experiences and widened perspectives . 
  i went on a 340km taxi ride ( 4-5 hours ) in thailand . 
  it was half the price of a 10km taxi ride in sweden . 
  ok , i 'm exaggerating . 
  we did split the cost over 4 people that time , so it was actually * double * the cost , not half ... but yeah , ridiculously cheap either way . 
  edit : grammar, 
  not , i 'm * not * sure , that 's why i asked . 
   there were a couple of interesting links i the reply i got though . 
  ^ ( i never said that it would be * impossible * . 
  i just meant that i 've heard it to be difficult and cumbersome , as opposed to for many other citizenships . ), 
  interesting links . 
  thanks !, 
  hopefully , sweden will beat them to it .

  speaking of ... 
  i 've heard someone say that it 's often difficult to * get rid of * one 's us citizenship , and that you 're e.g `` expected '' to pay us taxes even if you 've acquire another citizenship ( i.e double citizenship ) and never intend to set your foot in the us again . 
  know anything about that , or is it bullshit ? 
   the danish language is kinda like a rite of passage we use to weed out the inferior members of our tribes before they grow up and become a nuisance . 
  i honestly have to say that i often found danish speaking immigrants in copenhagen to be * easier * to understand than some of the natives when i was visiting , since non-native danish speakers often are less prone to swallow all the consonants . 
   ... in danish wednesday is `` onsdag '' , which is short for `` odins day '' that 's actually the case in english too . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/week-day_names#germanic_tradition  old english w\u014ddnesd\u00e6g ( pronounced [ wo\u02d0d.nes.d\u00e6j ) meaning the day of the germanic god wodan ( known as \u00d3\u00f0inn among the north germanic peoples ) , and a prominent god of the anglo-saxons ( and other germanic peoples ) in england until about the seventh century . 
  nope , nope , nope !, 
  i find eddie izzard 's bit in french at the end of one of his older shows ( dressed to kill ? ), 
  hilarious , but i 've never studied or made any effort to speak or understand french . 
  it 's * exactly * on that level though ( that 's the whole joke ) . 
  but i believe the show was recorded in the u.s , and i 'd guess their french is even worse . 
  * iceland * however : http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/banana_production_in_iceland, 
  i 've heard the star-ratings could be read as : \\* an exceptionally good restaurant in its class . 
  \\*\\* a restaurant worth a longer detour while traveling . 
  \\*\\*\\* a restaurant worthy of being the sole reason for traveling ; a travel destination of its own . 
  it depends on the context . 
  personally , i * enjoy * surstr\u00f6mming once in a while , so for me the stereotype is true . 
  i just * hate * abba ... 
  i guess ikea and [ volvo ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nwy1gc3.jpg ) are ok , but jokes are waaay too overused , and most often no other punchline than a simple reference '' * something , something , umlaut , ikea , ahahahah * '' ... 
  - `` ikea , abba , volvo ... blah , blah , blah ... '' well , 80-90 % of my furnitures and kitchen utensils are from ikea , but seriously ... do you * really * consider than an original and/or interesting conversation topic ? 
  yup ... 
  it * looks * chaotic , but it 's taken at the * exact moment * when the switch was made . 
  all ( private ) motor traffic was forbidden after a set pre-announced time ( 1am ) that day ; then the switch was made early in the morning ( 5am ) , switching sides of all parked cars by the roadsides . 
  instructions were given over national radio , and with lots of observing/instructing functionaries in the larger towns/cities . 
  traffic was then slowly being allowed again after 6am ; though speed-limits were temporarily lowered for a couple of days . 
  i bought it ( translated edition ) for reddit secret santa , plus some other stuff ... 
  i have n't read it myself yet , even though i actually have * two * copies of it laying around , as a friend ( not sure who ) forgot his/her copy at my place a couple of years ago . 
  same here ... 
  i thought they all were from much further south-east , but now i 'm in doubt . 
   snowmobiling on glaciers yes well , to some extent . 
  most glaciers are in restricted national parks, 
  s\u00e1mi presence is not really that prevalent in the southern end of the region today \\* , and the region also covers other ( more or less serious ) unrelated separatist regions , like for example republic of j\u00e4mtland . 
  the population within the s\u00e1pmi region is very mixed , and the s\u00e1mis themselves are a minority . 
  i 'm from further north , so i do n't know really . ), 
   the melody of the swedish spoken in gothenburg sounds slightly norwegian , at least superficially . 
  even more so further north from gothenburg , e.g bohusl\u00e4n and v\u00e4rmland . 
  not to mention h\u00e4rjedalen and j\u00e4mtland , but then j\u00e4mtska and h\u00e4rjedalska are more like bastardized/swedified norwegian dialects originally . 
  skotta = to shovel/scoop/shunt , also etymologically related to skjuta = to push/shove/shoot . 
  skotte ( noun ) = scottish person ; and skotsk ( adj. ), 
  = scottish ; are both unrelated . 
  one of my favorites : alkol\u00e4sk -  rusbrus . 
  well , i ca n't answer for how correct those numbers are ... 
  but let 's have a look at some examples : there are for example 85,700 people with somali * ancestry * , going back to the 1920s living in the us , but at the same time there are 115,000 somalian * born * people in the u.k ( total population 63m ) , and 40,000 somalian * born * people in sweden ( total population < 10m , or the size of michigan ) . 
  the town of s\u00f6dert\u00e4lje in sweden is often said to have accepted [ more iraqi refugees than the united states and canada combined ] ( http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2054&amp;artikel=5389357 ) . 
  edit : [ syrian refugees ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/refugees_of_the_syrian_civil_war ) : sweden 14,700 ; germany 5000-8000 ; the united states 100,

   why do we need so much gas anyway ? 
  ca n't we use other sources of energy ? 
  we do n't , and most of us do ... gas is usually just a small percentage of the total energy consumption . 
  the graphs here shown `` percentage of russian gas among the total * gas * usage '' . 
  they do ** not ** show `` percentage of russian gas among the total * energy * usage '' . 
  hrmmpf ... 
  i find this gibberish immensely profane and offensive to my religious conviction . 
  * everyone * knows that we were all conceived through the aurora boralis when it peaked over the star constellation `` the moose '' . 
  we shall once return to the stars , but until then , the mighty moose is our muse and the bear is our guardian ... our purpose here is however uncertain , as our minds have been clouded by firewater introduced by the ruthless `` norths '' ( which ironically came from the south ) . 
  it would however explain the subconscious understanding everyone shares with a simple nod and an inhaled * schjo * ,, 
  well ... jokkmokk municipality is roughly the size of slovenia , but has a population density of 0.27 inhabitants per km ^ 2 , which could be rounded off to zero . 
  however , the other municipalities up there has a population density slightly above that , i.e * at minimum * 1 per km ^ 2 when rounded off . 
  ( edit : on the swedish side at least ), 
  that 's just the last few decades . 
  traditionally , we 're a vodka country . 
  one could say there 's a reason * renat br\u00e4nnvin * has item number 1 in systembolaget 's inventory . 
  ( but centuries before that , we were also a beer country . ), 
  scandinavia should have been split in half in that map . 
  northern parts of sweden/norway - populated by manly men \\* , who are able to fix * anything * ; mostly due to necessity , since the nearest plumber/electrician/etc resides in a town 200km away . 
  \\* ^ ( female count is rather low , since many escape to the cities as soon as they 've finished school . ), 
  southern parts of sweden/norway - spoiled city-dwellers who would be unable to jump-start a car in a raging snow storm when the car battery has frozen solid , you 're out of cellphone range , and there is a herd of reindeer in the way . 
   ... and , more distantly , persian . 
  true , but 99 % all european languages are related within the proto-indo-european tree , so with swedish it goes without saying . 
  it 's however often described as a germanic language , with close relations with norwegian and danish , and also icelandic through the common root in old norse . 
  finnish , estonian , s\u00e1mi and hungarian are exception in that regard in that they * are n't * related to persian , czech , turkish , french , german , swedish , greek or any languages on the european continent , also including west - and central south asia ... ( besides a few loans ) hungarian however has a large vocabulary of loanwords , non-related to the finnish and estonian vocabularies , due to other influences over time , so the relationship is probably quite distant for anyone except theoretical linguistics . 
  -- -- with all said , i wish i spoke or at least understood finnish since it always has been a fairly common language in my surroundings ( including half of my family ) , but i unfortunately do n't . 
  there are [ many languages ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/lenguas_finop%c3%a9rmicas.png ) that are more closely related to finnish than hungarian . 
  of course , the easternmost of the ones on the map are probably much more distant , but the other ones like karelian etc are probably also ( erroneously ) vaguely included in the generalization `` siberian '' . 
  edit : or perhaps [ this map ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/uralic-yukaghir.png ) is more relevant for the relations within the family ...
