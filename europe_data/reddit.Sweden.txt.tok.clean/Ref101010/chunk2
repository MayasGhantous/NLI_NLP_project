  i was biking all year round a few years when i was living up north in sweden . 
  ( same latitude as sodankyl\u00e4 or kittil\u00e4 in finland ) my town was n't exactly * mountainous * , but there was elevation variations of about 200-300m between the two town centers . 
  the temperatures was the biggest discouragement in the winters ( down to -40 ) , but in the summers i usually did 60km \u00e0 day as an average . 
  here in the south ( swedish west coast ) , i would n't * dare * to bike in the winters as the weather is very fluctuating , and there 's a frequent melting/re-freezing cycle , covering the roads in ice . 
  most often with a layer of water or powdered snow on top , making it impossible to see . 
  it 's actually really depressing looking at old images of the town , and seeing how most of it has disappeared . 
  much has been replaced with functionalist concrete buildings elsewhere .

  [ i tried answering a similar question a while ago ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/shoestring/comments/1lmsuf/just_bought_a_ticket_to_europe_for_3_months/cc10yux?context=3 ) , not really related to the actual * move * though . 
  the neighboring mining town malmberget ( 120km south of kiruna ) has been on the move in stages since the the '70s , but kiruna takes the spotlight . 
  the difference however may be that in kiruna they 're trying to do the whole move once and for all , building a whole new town center , instead of shutting down and moving parts gradually when larger and larger areas of the underlying bedrock is deemed unstable . 
  [ some terrible documentary ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpc9sbjkmq4 ) about moving a few houses in malmberget .

  ah , thanks for correcting me ...  tried to google around at first , but one of my first search results was a forum thread filled with incompetent idiots who apparently had no idea what they were talking about . 
  now that you 've said it , i 'm pretty sure i 've heard the name before , but i would n't be able to remember it with 10,000,000 kr on stake . 
  for sweden , one of the most iconic must be [ * grindslanten * ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/grindslanten.jpg/1280px-grindslanten.jpg ) by august malmstr\u00f6m ( 1829-1901 ) and various portraits of [ crying children ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_esdu_lo7pg8/tp6hsvtxooi/aaaaaaaahik/xunebwmucny/s400/gr%25c3%25a5tande%2bbarn_rgb.jpg ) are super common ( especially among people in their 70s or older ) .

  yes , no doubt . 
  above 30 % ? 
  probably not . 
  above 40 % ? 
  it 's a very common third language to study in school , for 3-6 years . 
  very few swedes are * fluent * in german , but many are definitely able to have a basic conversation . 
  i.e asking for directions , skimming through a newspaper and picking up most of the basic information , or ordering food at a restaurant and afterwards compliment the chef . 
  grammatically the average german-speaking swedes are awful , but still able to make themselves understood in a basic conversation since the languages are closely related . 
  it 's easier than french or spanish in that regard . 
  i grew up in a smaller town , and spanish was n't available in 7th-9th grade there ; only german and french . 
  spanish was only an option at `` gymnasium '' - level ... -- edit : it 's also not * that * unusual to bump into germans in the swedish tech-industry . 
  however , i looked up the immigration numbers , and there are only 50,000 germans in sweden , which only account for 0.5 % of the population . 
  edit2 : not counting austrians , swiss , etc. . . and i have no idea how many german-speakers there are among other immigrants from * near * the germanosphere .

  i 'm still bitter that i was forced to decline an offer for a tiny part in * arn : riket vid v\u00e4gens slut * ( the sequel or second part of * arn : tempelriddaren * ) . 
  i 've been an extra in various swedish movies ( mostly cop-thrillers and silly comedies ) but i got the phone-call about arn when i was backpacking in thailand . 
  : / it was then the biggest and most expensive movie ever made in scandinavia , so it could have been fun/interesting . 
   not without a visa ah , you are of course correct ... 
  but it 's still easier to get a visa as a swede than as an american ( or south korean ) . 
  sweden is also one of very few western countries that have an embassy in nk . 
  you also have a much easier time if you 'd like to visit , let 's say , cuba or iran . 
   switzerland , ukraine and belarus ( russia and turkey too , but it 's debatable whether they 're `` in europe '' or not ) are the only european countries you 'll need a passport for as a union citizen . 
  the uk also is n't part of schengen , but still permits passport free travel with most of the eu/eea . 
  * however * some countries do n't recognize this , and a passport is required when flying between the u.k and sweden . 
  i do n't think it 's required if traveling by train or boat , just flying . 
   my swedish id card works fine in denmark . 
  even before the eu , there were ( and still is ) the nordic passport union . 
  you have practically citizen rights in all of the nordic countries and can move and work as you wish . 
  there are only a few restrictions ( i.e military service and voting in national elections ) . 
  yeah , there are ~ ~ many ~ ~ * some * countries and territories where a us passport is a * disadvantage * . 
  with a swedish passport you have eu and schengen , plus practically citizen rights in all of the nordic countries ( same for all nordic citizens ) ; and visa-free travel in lots of countries all over the world where a visa may be required from many other nationalities ... 
  including some countries the us have grudges with , and may not be able to visit * at all * without special prerequisites . 
  you can even visit north korea if you want ( edit : not visa-free though ) . 
  of course a swedish passport is far from unique in that regard , but it 's the * combination * of a wide array of countries that adds up ; from east to west , north to south . 
  a u.k passport has lots of advantages in the anglosphere and the commonwealth , and former colonies ; in addition to the eu , even if they 're not part of schengen . 
  i can imagine a french passport also would have some advantages in certain french overseas territories all over the world ; while at the same time not really having that many disadvantages . 
  you 're probably right . 
  i have only been in copenhagen and frederikshavn , but there are apparently also views like [ this ] ( http://obj.fotosidan.se/obj/docpart/3b/3b0dc29b342f8a70ea25c3a8f307b740.jpg ) in denmark . 
  though you 're not going to find too many places that look like [ this ] ( http://www.riksgransen.se/media/931/bigimage2.jpg ) or [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/sarvesvagge-25.jpg ) in either sk\u00e5ne or denmark ... or in sweden * south * of stockholm . 
   sk\u00e5ne is n't any flatter than the rest of sweden . 
   ... hills higher than anything you 'll find in denmark . 
  `` scania 's highest point : 212 m above sea level . '', 
  meh ... 212m is barely a road bump ; but yes , it 's slightly higher than * denmark 's * highest point . 
   danish -- ^ ( edit : i 'm not saying it is n't an * amazing * film , or that mads is n't an amazing actor ... 
  though he has been in * a lot * of danish movies . ), 
  yeah , i 've heard it 's fairly common on the british isles too ... 
  it 's a manageable condition in everyday life , but it 's somewhat interesting that there often seem to be somewhat elevated risks for symptoms to occur when spending a vacation abroad . 
  unfortunately , it may easily ( at first glance ) be confused with the similar , but unrelated disorder , * dickheaditis * . 
  so ... / r/britishproblems would be the more relevant subreddit in this case ? 
  do n't blame the danes ( or the similarly behaving swedes and norwegians ) for going on drunken rampages . 
  it 's a genetic disorder called * vikingus berzerkitis * . 
  it 's somewhat like a type of high-functioning autism , and most affected people are generally able to live ( almost ) normal lives .

  [ long list of various swedish ( and some neighboring scandinavian ) beer festivals ] ( http://www.svenskaolframjandet.se/taxonomy/term/33 ) i 've read some mixed but mostly positive reviews regarding [ stockholm beer and whiskey festival ] ( http://www.stockholmbeer.se/english/ ) and the much smaller [ gothenburg 's porterfestival ] ( http://porterfestival.se/in-english/ ) , but i 've never ~ ~ beer ~ ~ been at either . 
  iirc , there 's a myth about some aftermath of a war between sweden and denmark some centuries ago ( which war ? 
  i do n't know , [ pick one ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dano-swedish_war ) ) where there was a heated debate where to draw the new borders . 
  after hour ( days ? ), 
  of arguing , everyone could finally `` agree '' on the new borders , and a treaty was signed . 
  ... but there was one island that was forgotten . 
  someone had placed a mug of ale on the map that was covering the table , and ( accidentally or deliberately , depends on who 's telling the story ) covered the island , thus it was forgotten in the negotiations and never changed ownership while all the nearby areas did . 
  not sure if it was ven or bornholm , or some completely other island altogether ... 
  probably some really insignificant one , but still worth childishly bickering about for centuries to come , `` just as a matter of * principle * '' . 
  i lived there for 22 years , then moved to the southern parts 10 years ago ... coldest i ever experienced was below -50 , but that was once in a lifetime . 
  right now it 's [ `` only '' a bit below -40 ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=sv&amp;sl=sv&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fnsd.se%2fnyheter%2frekordkyla-i-norr-minus-42-8196925.aspx ) [ here are some ( low quality cellphone ) pics from my last visit ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/sweden/comments/182o1z/do_you_call_that_snow_post_your_best_swedish_snow/c8bissw ) , about one year ago . 
  temperatures then were oscillating back and forth between -15 and -35 ( in certain valleys down to -44 ) during the two weeks i was there . 
  is n't 1-3 % below , or at least in the ballpark of , normal inflation ? 
  also , * the hunt * was an intense movie . 
  really difficult/uncomfortable to watch ... definitely the best ( new ) film i saw last year .

  yup , but even if its short in a global comparison , it needs longer strips than the old viggen .
