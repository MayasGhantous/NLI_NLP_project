  [ here 's a bus driver in southern sweden who gives zero fucks ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbxditaki2s ), 
  apparently , it was a misquotation . 
  yeah , i realized . 
  just thought quotation-marks were important . 
  let 's ... not talk about that ... , 
  everything in sweden is either `` racist '' or `` sexist '' . 
  so ... matooshka ? 
  [ browar-witnica ] ( http://browar-witnica.pl/ ) seems to be a nice polish brewery . 
  at least i like their black boss porter ... ^ ( edit : the only one i remember by name , as i was kinda drunk ) ... but i 've had to pay $ 10 for it in a swedish pub . 
  on the other hand , i have to pay $ 6 for shitty standard lagers in swedish pubs . 
   i 'll keep my eyes open for pinta . 
  i think the biggest problem is eu 's guidelines for public procurement biddings , as you do n't seem to be allowed \\* to disregard a winning bid . 
  it just seems like ansaldobreda gets a lot of contracts , even though they have extremely bad reputation and ca n't deliver what they promise . 
  \\* disclaimer - i 'm not a lawyer , and have no idea what i 'm talking about . 
  yeah , we have trams from ansaldobreda in gothenburg , and they have * not * been without flaws . 
  they were to be delivered between 2003 and 2005 . 
  the first came in late 2005 and the last in 2011 , and today half of them are out-of-service because of rust in the framework and various other problems . 
  earlier complaints have been extremely annoying noises , extensive wear on both wheels and rails , malfunctioning air-conditioning , malfunctioning doors , various software bugs , and at least one of the trams spontaneously caught fire . 
  ... and i 've head the danes are n't too happy about their trains either . 
  your choices for england , ireland , finland , sweden , belgium and hungary are n't bad . 
  not * necessarily * my personal first-hand choices , but still ... ( scotland for whisky of course , but ireland for whisk ** e ** y ) --  some of this is satire , some of it is not . 
  it is up to you to decide which is which ... italy for trains is just about the sickest and most perverted joke i 've heard in my life . 
   weird , since they actually know * cars * ... 
  though i 'd still choose germany over italy even if we 're talking cars , at least for quality . 
  heck , the germans even own lamborghini nowadays ; as well as bentley , bugatti and rolls-royce . 
  beer : 1 : belgium 2 : belguim 3 : belgium 4 : ~ ~ england ~ ~ * scotland * - almost deserves the high ranking for brewdog tokyo \\* alone . 
  ^ ( argh !, 
  i 've made a huge mistake . 
  brewdog is scottish ! ), 
  5 : germany - hefeweizen , hefeweizen , hefeweizen , and occasionally a rauchbier ( and did i mention hefeweizen ? ), 
  6 : netherlands - much like belgium , but smaller selection . 
  7 : denmark - just stay away from carlsberg , tuborg and harboe , and go for the micros . 
  8 : sweden - bad rep for macros ( and deservingly so ) , but has a very nice ( and still growing ) micro scene . 
  9 : czech republic - pilsners , of course . 
  have n't had the chance to try anything * except * pilsner . 
  10 : poland - has some killer porters . 
  have n't had the chance to try anything * except * porters . 
  11 : austria - have only tried a very few seasonals , and i 'm not sure the `` low '' ranking is deserved . 
  well , they 're still above ~ 40 other european countries . 
  12 : norway - nice micros ( * very * nice ) , but low availability . 
  13 : ~ ~ scotland ~ ~ * england * - generally much like ~ ~ england ~ ~ * scotland * on the traditional scene ( please do n't kill me ) , ~ ~ but smaller selection ~ ~ . 
  solid beers , but have n't tried anything really extraordinary . 
  14 : ireland 14-50 : * meeeeh ... *, 
  it even became international news . 
  the s\u00e1mi have been protesting for a long time about these new mines . 
  there are some who stand on the other side also , and welcome new jobs , but i believe the negative part is a majority . 
  neither the s\u00e1mi or other landowners are being compensated much whenever a mine opens . 
  landowners only get minuscule fractions of a percent of the profit when a mining company tears up open wounds in nature , and the mineral laws are written so that a landowner does n't have much say in the question . 
  you only own the * surface * , not what 's found beneath . 
  -- edit : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hr13wv7ukga, 
  well , for starters there 's definitely 2 flags missing in the north : [ j\u00e4mtland ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/unofficial_flag_of_jamtland.svg/800px-unofficial_flag_of_jamtland.svg.png ) and [ norrland ] ( http://www.freewebs.com/norrlandsite/img/norrland_flag.gif ) . 
  though the border between norrland and sapmi would be difficult to draw in the area around lappland and norrbotten . 
  where s\u00e1mi is a language group with several different languages . 
  ha has done a few ted-talks . 
  [ this one ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftzneizrklg ) is also pretty entertaining . 
  is it just me or did he have even more of an accent in the video you linked ? 
  if someone would ask what a swedish accent sounds like , i 'd link to some ted-talk with [ hans rosling ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvimvzgtd6w ) . 
  yes , it 's potatis , but there are many dialectal variants ... pot\u00e4ter , etc. . . variants like * p\u00e4ra , peron , p\u00e4ron , p\u00e4rer * are very common locally , and often explained as a short form of `` jordp\u00e4ron '' / earth-pears . 
  yup , and * both * stem from two different pronunciations of the chinese symbol \u8336 . 
  * the dutch ( and also other european ) traders first came in contact with the product through mandarin speaking parts of china ( t\u00ea ) , and were the ones who spread it in most of western europe . 
  therefor te/t \u00e9 / t\u00e8 / the/teh/tea / etc * the portuguese traders first came in contact with the product through cantonese speaking parts of china ( ch\u00e0h ) . 
  they were also the ones who also introduced tea in india through trade . 
  therefor cha/chai/etc . 
  * ... and large parts of eastern europe got their words for the product through trade along land routes , with persia as a main hub . 
  and then african languages got their words from a broad mix of the above . 
  i 'd say the opposite . 
  with busses and trains , you usually go from big city to big city , but while biking you get to see the things that normal tourists usually do n't . 
  i.e instead of just seeing the usual tourist streaks in every city ( which , honestly , are more or less the same everywhere ) , you get to see the countryside and many smaller towns ; and you 'll meet locals along your way in a whole different manner than while walking around said tourist streaks . 
  though one should of course plan one 's route realistically , and select a specific scenic route instead of trying to cross `` all of europe '' and expect to see `` everything '' . 
  i tried biking from the north to the south of sweden when i was 17 . 
  i gave up after one month and 1030km , with about 600km left to my goal in gothenburg . 
  i had stayed about a couple of weeks in a town along the way , and was averaging 100km a day when i was actually biking . 
  170km in a day at the most . 
  the last few years i 've been dreaming about doing a similar trip , but begin in gothenburg , take the ferry to denmark and then bike to southern spain . 
  unfortunately , i do n't have the money for investing in the necessary equipment at the moment . 
  i do n't even own a bike at the moment . 
  :| edit : anyhow , yes ... 
  it can definitely be done , but try to concentrate on a handful of countries and plan a specific concentrated route , instead of trying to do `` europe '' . 
  once every few years there 's headlines where fishermen have caught `` something strange '' in their nets around my city . 
  ... though then it 's usually a wwi or wwii naval mine ... 
   that 's journalism ladies and gents !, 
  to be fair , it 's a small local newspaper . 
  well ... denmark * did * get a single immigrated elk once , a couple of years ago . 
  it had swam across the sound , and became a big headline in all newspapers . 
  it instantly became a praised celebrity in denmark ... ... then it got hit by a train a couple of weeks later . 
  -- jokes aside though , the original comment is just tragic . 
  apparently [ a moose died ] ( http://www.gp.se/nyheter/sverige/1.2158652-alg-foll-offer-for-stormen ) . 
  i 'd say that [ this scene ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whdbu4g3_oe ) from nilecity 105,6 \\* would be more relevant . 
  ^ ( * an , in the '90s , immensely popular swedish tv-series with only vaguely coherent sketches . ), 
  the swedish church has had a growing percentage of atheist/agnostic members for at least half a century . 
  most people were born into membership ; as you up until the turn of the millennium * automatically * were listed as a member at birth , if at least one parent was a member ; and are too lazy or simply do n't care enough to leave . 
  in my experience , almost all outspoken christians are part of some `` free church '' , of which there are many different branches . 
  i 've heard that there 's a finnish saying that `` in the sauna , you behave like in the church ! '', 
  i.e behave !, 
  no flirting , no unnecessary talking , etc. . . 
  it makes me wonder if drinking koff , karhu , or lapin kulta is allowed in the churches in finland .

  have you ever * seen * a [ chicken ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zf2e8z7eof8 ) ? 
  one of the swedish words to enter the english language would also be the name of the swedish superhero : ** ombudsman ** . 
  * his superpower would be an eye for legal situations where the need for a proxy spokesperson is apparent .
