  * also the dual-edged strenght/flaw of being able to create public rage via ( mis ) interpreting journalists .

  yes , but while systembolaget surely has its disadvantages , it also has a few advantages . 
  as systembolaget is a governmental monopoly , they do n't have any aim for maximized profits . 
  they * do * have an obligation to turn some * specific amount * in profit for the state ( dedicated for addiction treatment , anti-alcohol ads , etc ) , but it 's such low sum that it 's about what they sell in a tuesday ... what this gives you , both as a consumer and a producer , is a nationwide network of stores , which adds practically nothing \\* to the price of the products . 
  stores are not pushed from above to turn bigger profits , they 're only pushed to improve quality and consumer satisfaction on service . 
  ^ \\* ^ ( alcohol-taxes are counted separately , which is the reason alcohol still is expensive in sweden . ), 
  their routines and rules have also been eased up a bit over the years , for both producers and consumers . 
  there are many things done in the background , that consumers do n't see , making it easier for small scale brewers . 
  everyone of their stores in every small village share a logistic network and supply database . 
  if a certain limited-edition beer is sold out in every store in your city , you can just ask any clerk , and they 'll check the database . 
  if there 's just a handful bottles left * in the other end of the country * , they 'll grab them for you and ship them to your store within a couple of days ... today you can even check the inventory and pick your special order yourself over the internet . 
  which brings me to my main-point : they always have a thick order catalogue . 
  as a brewer , you ca n't sell directly to customers , just systembolaget and restaurants with permits ... 
  but even if you can get into the regular assortment on systembolaget ( due to lack of shelf space , etc ) , they * will * still sell your beer . 
  if you spread the word over the internet , your beer will sell though their catalogue . 
  you 'd of course be confined to a niche-market at first , but if your products are good enough , they will join the regular range sooner or later ... and as the interest for craft beer is high , consumers are actively scanning blogs and forums for new breweries/products . 
  on the anecdotal side : some friends of friends started a brewery a while ago , but i still have n't been able to try any of their beers . 
  they just sell through restaurants ( in the other end of the country ) and through systembolaget 's order catalogue ... but all their beers have been * sold out * every time i 've tried to order . 
  from what i read on facebook , they lack capacity to fill the demand , even though they just go by word-of-mouth ( and word-of-internet ) . 
  my vote goes to tt ( three towns ) ... 
  i 'd never buy pripps bl\u00e5 voluntarily , and i know no one who would , but it 's sometimes the only one offered ( e.g plastic cups in beer tents at certain events ) ... 
  it 's really bland and watery , but it gets you drunk . 
  tt on the other hand is almost as bland , but in addition also has some really off-putting metallic aftertaste . 
  now that i think of it , pripps bl\u00e5 might also have that odd aftertaste , but tt is worse . 
  -- back in the early '90s , before we joined the eu , beer over 6 % was prohibited , meaning you could n't buy e.g an imported orval , duvel or rochefort , and the rigid alcohol-laws really made it difficult to start up a brewery . 
  the domestic market consisted of a handful of macro-breweries who had bought up practically all other breweries in the country over the last half-century . 
  all of them offered just about * only * light lagers . 
  there were also some * very few * regional breweries who were able to sell to restaurants after a law-change in the '70s , but they are mostly just a side-note in the history of swedish beer . 
  almost everything was in the style of pripps bl\u00e5 , spendrups and tt . 
  on the `` darker side '' of the beer scale there were only beers like falcon bayersk , where there was just a * hint * of color to an otherwise equally bland beer . 
  i 'd say that [ carnegie porter ] ( http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/carnegie-stark-porter/4503/ ) was the sole exception to the rule of a country of tasteless lagers ; and it also was the oldest brand on the market , even though the original brewery has been closed down . 
  ^ ( if anyone know of any other noteworthy swedish beer that existed before the '90s , please tell me . ), 
  laws and rules were lifted slightly when we joined the eu in 1994 , and after a slow start , we now ( 20 years later ) have about 100 interesting microbreweries . 
  of course , 100 breweries does n't * sound * like much , but it 's a growth of 1100 % in just a couple of decades from a previously slumbering beer-nation , and we 're a very small country population-wise . 
  the rate of growth is still increasing ... 
  please denmark , belgium , england , scotland , germany , poland and basically everyone else ... please do n't laugh at us , we 're * trying * to wake up as a beer nation . 
  that 's actually fairly common ( or at least not completely unheard of ) here also . 
  though almost exclusively in the northernmost parts of sweden , where all places end with - vaara , - joki , - j\u00e4rvi , - vuoma , etc. 
  * hmmm * , i * wonder * if we have some finnish heritage up here ... , 
  5 randomly selected unusual saunas from the interwebs : [ ski-lift gondola sauna ] ( http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/travel/pix/pictures/2008/09/25/saunagondola4.jpg ) [ phone booth sauna ] ( http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5063/5888095152_25c4b34602_z.jpg ) [ military tracked all-terrain sauna ] ( http://www-tc.pbs.org/pov/film-images/img_120055_photo_file_22_1.jpg ) [ saab sauna ] ( http://saabworld.net/attachments/f85/365d1281725512-sauna-saab-sale-finland-saunasaab3.jpg ) [ combined harvester sauna ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/08/09/article-1301464-0abacdbd000005dc-293_634x376.jpg ) seriously , i 'd ** never ** underestimate a finn 's ingenious ability to turn *** anything with walls *** into a sauna . 
  who else would even * think * of going to greenland , iceland and helluland ? 
  first snow of the year fell several weeks ago in sweden . 
  ... though it has been unusually warm in the south . 
  i think there 's a slight difference in how many boys vs girls are born . 
  some quick googling : `` boys vs girls born '' : [ sex ratio ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sex_ratio ) @ wikipedia :  the cia estimates that the current world wide sex ratio at birth is 107 boys to 100 girls , [ 2 ] though during the late 1990s there was concern that the ratio of males to females was declining too rapidly . 
  [ 3 ] in 2010 , the global adult sex ratio was 986 females per 1,000 males and trended to reduce to 984 in 2011 . 
  not by far as extreme , but a popular swedish phrase demonstrating the tonal aspects of the language : - * far , f\u00e5r f\u00e5r f\u00e5r * ? 
  [ dad , ( do ) sheep get sheep ? ], 
  [ no , sheep get lambs . ], 
  without the right intonation , the first sentence is just gibberish .

  there 's a similar thread about this on / r/sweden where people are kinda upset ( and whining in the typical anti-eu lingo , as mentioned in this thread ) . 
  and vice versa for malm\u00f6 . 
  serious warning for people in the region : a friend recently discovered the hard way that while you surprisingly enough * do * get splendid cellphone reception on the sea , on the ships between gothenburg and frederikshavn , *** it 's not cheap *** . 
  it 's a local ( on ship ) roaming service , routed through a satellite network , and it did cost something like 230sek ( 200dkk / $ 25 ) just for * receiving * a just-a-few-minutes short call . 
  they do n't have any network in norway . 
  from wikipedia :  3 is a brand name under which several umts-based mobile phone networks and broadband internet providers are operated in australia , austria , denmark , hong kong , macau , indonesia , ireland , italy , sweden , and the united kingdom . 
  i 've had 3 ( sweden ) since 2004 and i 've heard about this deal for a few years , but terms have varied between countries . 
  they * cancelled * it in sweden and the u.k a while ago ... but at least the networks of sweden and denmark count as one single network , so there 's no roaming in denmark for me . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hutchison_3g#3_like_home  in february 2007 3 introduced ' 3 like home ' : a service that in theory allows subscribers to use any 3-branded network with the exception of 3 indonesia without having to pay additional roaming charges , instead paying the same amount for voice , data , and messaging services as they would do on their home network . 
  this also allows users to use their free or inclusive bundles and allowances while abroad . 
  however , pre-pay customers do not benefit fully , as they can not yet use each 3 branded network for ' 3 like home ' . 
   3 australia confirm that calls made using ' 3 like home ' are not included in any `` cap '' plan or inclusive bundles . 
   this arrangement is possible because of the roaming agreements between the networks . 
  each of the networks provides service to other partners networks free of internal roaming charges . 
  this means that the marginal cost of a roaming call is much the same as a call on the home network . 
   at the end of april 2009 , 3 uk announced that ' 3 like home ' would no longer be available to customers of the 3 uk network from 30 june 2009 . 
  on 7 april 2010 , 3 sweden announced that ' 3 like home ' would be discontinued on 23 may 2010 . 
  no cancellation announcements have yet been made for customers of other 3 networks . 
   on 19 august 2013 , 3 austria announced at a press conference that ' 3 like home ' would no longer be available for new customers , following their acquisition of orange austria . 
  existing plans are unaffected . 
  -- and now they 're bringing it back in the uk ? 
  wtf ?!, 
  make up your minds !, 
  and bring it back for swedish customers !, 
  bad research from svt in that short video clip . 
  during the first 5 seconds they mention another fire in the kristineberg zink/copper mine , 15 years ago , but at the same time show a crude cutaway view over the lkab iron ore mine in malmberget/koskullskulle . 
  nothing , -25 is child 's play ... 
  it 's when it drops down to around -40 ( or even below * -50 * ) that you begin to look for one-way flights to thailand . 
  your skin becomes kinda fragile below -40 and the snow crystals begin to behave like powdered glass . 
  as a result , your legs and underarms are usually covered in shallow cuts when you 've been rolling naked in the snow during a sauna session . 
  do n't take me wrong , it usually does n't hinder me ... 
  snow bathing is refreshing . 
   holy shit i do n't care if you have the strongest safety net in the world , that is a dealbreaker !!!, 
  haha , it 's not that extreme really ... 80 + % of the population lives in the southern half where the climate is more forgiving . 
  those extremes i 've described is mostly relevant for the most extreme * arctic * northern tip of the country , i.e corresponding to about 300mi north of fairbanks , alaska . 
  the climate down here is not * that much * more extreme than the u.k and northern continental europe . 
  edit : perhaps somewhat similar to the coastal climate of north-eastern u.s , despite scandinavia being located much further north . 
  * sometimes * i want to curse those masochistic neolithic humans who wandered up here in pre-historic times , instead of staying in the more temperate zones , but what can you do ... over the significant number of millenniums since then , we 've lost our permanent sunblock . 
    have you ever thought about moving ?
