  yes , i 'm being tortured by the thought ever fall/winter , but so far i 've never been close to realize those thoughts . 
   is the weather worth all the other benefits of living in sweden ? 
  pretty much , though many people * do * move permanently to e.g thailand or spain when they retire . 
  salaries and vacation times also allow many people to leave the country for the tropics during the darkest weeks of december . 
   i 'm sure the arctic summers are wonderful though . 
  are the mosquitoes bad ? 
  they 're awesome !, 
  the winters are also [ truly awesome ] ( http://flickrhivemind.net/tags/kiruna ) , * they 're just to darn * *** long *** . 
  the mosquitoes up north are infamous , and dreaded , but i have to say that in more recent years they 've been declining . 
  it 's a cycle which depends on certain factors , e.g precipitation during the `` right '' ( or wrong ) times of the year , temperatures during early spring , etc. . . 
  they 're not a problem in the cities/towns , but if you go fishing/hiking/golfing a late summer evening ( or even night , as the sun never sets ) , prepare to be eaten !, 
  over the years you 'll learn to appreciate the impregnated strong `` aroma '' of your fishing gear with years of accumulated pitch/tar-based mosquito repellents , jungle oil , etc. . . but you 'll also get hardened over time and do n't notice the high pitched noise emitting bloodsuckers as much ( except for when trying to sleep in a tent or cabin close to a bog or wet and mushy river valley ) . 
  they 're rare in the south . 
  again , where 80 + % of the population resides . 
   born and raised southerner . 
  always wondered if i could survive a nordic winter . 
  i can say with 100 % accuracy that based on this description , i could not . 
  pffft ... do n't knock it 'til you try it . 
  up north , no problems at all . 
  snow gets plowed frequently , and the remaining layer gets heavily packed and reminds of a compacted dirt road . 
  above a certain latitude they do n't salt the roads as it does n't give any effects at those low temperatures anyway , but at certain times of ambivalent weather by early winter and early/late spring , they might use sand . 
  when * driving * up there you need studded tires , as the roads might get packed too heavily and sometimes resemble ice , especially approaching intersections where all breaking vehicles have polished the snowy surface over time ... but there 's no problem walking . 
  heck , some years i even used my mountainbike with regular tires all year round , no matter the temperature . 
  in the middle and the south , they do salt the roads . 
  the winters are much shorter , and along the west coast there 's very little snow ... 
  there 's a higher risk of slippery surfaces though , since the little snow that we actually get down here often melts and then freezes as thin ice ... 
  i would n't * dare * to bike during winter down here without studded tires . 
  that road salt might be effective to remove snow and ice at some weather condition , but it also results in a more frequent melting/freezing cycle . 
  drivers are however discouraged to use studded tires on their cars down here , as they only have an advantage over non-studded m+s tires for a week or two per year , instead they just wear down the road surfaces . 
  but regarding walking , i use regular sneakers all year round . 
  there 's only a few days a year when you have to be careful . 
  especially at early spring , when the melting/freezing cycle can result in some thin ice overnight and they have n't yet managed to sand/salt the sidewalks . 
  it 's especially troublesome it there 's undercooled rain on top of that , but you also learn to tell what parts of the sidewalks to avoid . 
  i imagine that the winters here down south are rather similar to winters in the uk , just a * little * bit longer . 
   i know , just being snarky . 
  no worries . 
  i picked up on that , but my full-duplex anti-humor spectralgenerator is just turned to 11 . 
  it 's unfortunately a level where funky quantum effects comes into play , and odd things begin happening . 
  more specifically , humor disintegrates in a cloud of uncertainty and i lose track of even my own intents with counter-snarky replies ... ( i.e * i `` can not into humor '' * . ), 
  as for your question , i do n't know really . 
  i just noticed that dried food ( pasta , rice , beans , etc ) and canned food is priced on an more relatable level . 
  it 's still * slightly * more expensive than even sweden , but the difference is hardly noticeable . 
  i guess that type of wares is bought more in bulk , resulting in more reasonable prices . 
  i 've also read something about how they 've recently opened up some storage facilities for potatoes and similar food items in climate controlled spaces down in old mines , to allow more optimal storage conditions . 
  iirc , potatoes did cost something like $ 5-6 / kg when i was there . 
  local cuisine in restaurants included cod , arctic char , coalfish , ptarmigan , reindeer , seal , whale , etc. . . but i mostly cooked my own food . 
  i followed a very improvised diet of spaghetti with onions and either goat cheese ( found on sale ) or canned mackerel . 
  no , refrigeration is n't a problem . 
  it 's just the shipping and handling of products with short shelftime , fresh produce , dairy products , etc. . . 
  many products have to be * flown * there . 
  especially in the winter , when all harbors are closed due to ice . 
  it 's a very remote region and with extremely low population , pushing the low volume transport costs very high per unit . 
  to make it even worse : the coldest i 've ever experienced was -54 \u00b0 c ( -65 \u00b0 f ) , but that was only for a couple of days , and temperatures statistically only drop * that * low twice in a century . 
  that 's cold enough to turn diesel fuel into a thick syrupy slush ... needless to say , i did n't spend much time outside those days , except for walking to/from school . 
  when the temperature later rose to -20 \u00b0 c a couple of days later , you were basically sweating under all your clothes . 
  -- yeah , i moved to southern sweden and it 's very different down here . 
  i now live 1000km/600mi south of the arctic circle , instead of 100km/60mi * above * it . 
  here summer temperatures oscillates around 20-25 \u00b0 c , with a few rare days above 30 \u00b0 c every year . 
  during the * much shorter * winter temperatures usually hover between +5 \u00b0 c and -5 \u00b0 c , only occasionally down to -15 \u00b0 c during short cold snaps . 
  coastal climate gives us very little snow compared to just 30-40km inland , but on the other hand very high humidity which makes the cold able to penetrate your clothes more effectively . 
  it 's actually much easier to dress for the extremely cold dry winters up north than for rainy and stormy 0 \u00b0 c winter days down here , but it 's an easy trade for me since the winters are much shorter here and we get more evenly spread sunlight over the year . 
  i do miss the summers up north , when the sun never sets . 
  temperatures then are almost the same as down here , just for a couple of months shorter time ... 
  it 's not really the winter cold that gets you up there ; it 's the length of the winters and , more significantly , the darkness of the polar night . 
  another ( formerly northern ) swede chiming in . 
  the winters are bad when temperatures drop below -45 \u00b0 c ( -50 \u00b0 f ) , you get no sunlight , meters of snow , all public transportation break down ( not from the snow , but from the * cold * ) , and you 're * missing * a cuddle buddy . 
  bitching cold polar nights with glimmering waist-deep razorsharp crystallized snow , under the occasional aurora borealis , are magical and considered very exotic by many . 
  but after * months * of the same , every single year , you just want to kill yourself . 
  i saw a short clip about homeless slum childs somewhere in south america ( ca n't remember which country ) , making a living by scavenging garbage dumps . 
  they interviewed a pre-teen kid , asking about how he felt about his life . 
  all-in-all he was rather happy , as he had nice friends and thought he had n't been through as much tragedy as many others . 
  on the question if there was * anything * he would wish for , he thought for a moment , then said : `` a football '' . 
  and he almost sounded guilty for admitting that he felt jealous of that other kid who had one . 
  true , but it 's difficult to appreciate your semi-central apartment with 40 '' flatscreen tv , 100mbit internet fiber and your $ 1000-1500 / month when your friends makes double . 
  you do n't compare yourself with poor people in other parts of the world , but with all the people surrounding you in your everyday life . 
  you feel like an outcast , a worthless loser , a reject . 
  you ca n't socialize with your friends on equal terms , as you ca n't afford going out as often , ca n't afford shopping as often , ca n't afford traveling as often , etc. . . you have to stay home and cook your lentils while you see your friends instagraming pictures from all over the world , from various music festivals , etc. . . you feel like you 'd never meet someone special since you 're such a loser and you live in a small studioapartment equivalent to , or just a tiny step up from , a student apartment . 
  you hate just about everything about your life that was n't part of the image you had of your future self when you were a kid . 
  ** yes , we 're spoiled ** , *** very *** ** spoiled ** , but that 's the way it is . 
  it 's often all too easy to loathe your life for what you * do n't * have , instead of appreciating what you actually got . 
  norway would be my obvious answer too . 
  also , the nature is a bit more extreme , with more well-defined mountains ( not to say that the swedish mountains are dull , but there 's a bigger contrast in norway ) , [ but the winter temperatures are also more forgiving ] ( http://i.imgur.com/caaqm.jpg ) . 
  i went there , semi-actively looking for a job a couple of years ago ... 
  but i spent most of my time either drinking beer , hiking or photographing . 
  ^ ( edit : beer was literally cheaper than milk !, 
  not that the beer was * cheap * by any non-scandinavian standards , but anything with an expiration date was expensive as fuck . 
  hell , * cigarettes * were cheaper than milk at the supermarket ! ), 
  it 's [ extremely beautiful ] ( http://imgur.com/a/sia77 ) , but it 's also a very unforgiving environment . 
  usually very cold , no matter of time of year . 
  when i was there , there was a heatwave where the temperature went as high as +12 \u00b0 c. . . that 's actually rather unusual , as the mean temperature in july ( the warmest month of the year ) is +4 \u00b0 c. . . at least -20 \u00b0 c in winter , with cold snaps down to -40 \u00b0 c , which on the other hand is * rather mild * considering the location . 
  i briefly bumped into a few brits at the campsite where i was staying . 
  they wandered off north shortly after . 
  my last day there , [ a polar bear wandered in at the campsite ] ( https://ssl.panoramio.com/photo_explorer#view=photo&amp;position=0&amp;with_photo_id=61697552&amp;order=date_desc&amp;user=304811 ) ( not my photo , but [ here 's a short video i shot . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a65q81k0exq ) ) one week after i had went back home , i heard that [ the group of brits had been attacked , and one of them had been killed ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_svalbard_polar_bear_attack ) . 
  sweden : 40hour/week . 
  holidays varies from year to year ( depending on if holidays occurs on weekends or not ) . 
  20-25 vacation days . 
  sickdays ? 
  well , 365 in a row i think ... 
  if i 've been sick for a year , then compensation is lowered , and i * may * be forced to look for some other job .
