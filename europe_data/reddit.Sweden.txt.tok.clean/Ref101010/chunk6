  if i go back to work , and work for a few months , the 1 year limit resets . 
  the first 2 weeks of sick leave is paid by the employer ( 80 % of salary ) . 
  after 2 weeks , the government pays ( 80 % , up to a certain limit ) , while some employers might still continue to pay 10 % . 
  edit : the first day of sick leave is a `` karensdag '' ( ~ qualifying day of sickness ) and is always unpaid . 
  you 'd go by boat from stockholm , and enjoy tax-free shopping on board . 
  gothenburg ordered 40 trams from italian ansaldobreda in 2001 , to be delivered between 2003 and 2005 . 
  by 2006 , three had been delivered and the last one was put into traffic in 2011 .

  but late carts are the smallest problem . 
  there is a shortage of spare parts , wheel wear is extensive , doors and wheelchair ramps are malfunctioning . 
   willy nicklasson has nearly ten years been part of the project for the italian trams , he has been at the factory in italy dozens of times and was for many years chief engineer at gothenburg tramways . 
  he believes that the cause of the problems are largely the attitude of the employees at ansoldobreda . 
   - it is completely different to work with swedes or germans than with the italians , he says . 
  you have to nag for a couple of years before the italians realize that a problem is a problem . 
  only now they begin to understand that we do not like it when things do not work . 
  privatization is a very complex question , and i 'm currently not really awake and focused enough to comment on that , but in short i agree with you as the current situation with several chopped up companies with different responsibilities is just a clusterfuck of madness . 
  i completely agree with the second part . 
  it 's great to not having to deal with buses to/from airports , weight limits for luggage , airport security , trying to eat your breakfast while sitting in an unnatural cramped pose and trying not to elbow your neighbor , etc. . . 
  instead just go straight from city center to city center , while reading a book or chatting with strangers , and also be able to walk around and stretch your legs . 
  i do however still prefer to fly when i 'm going up north , unless i have unlimited time , simply because of the distance involved . 
  train from gothenburg to kiruna takes ~ 21 hours , making weekend trips virtually impossible . 
  it 's 1200km by air , meaning slightly longer than from copenhagen to e.g milano , zagreb or st. petersburg . 
  same with malm\u00f6 - berlin . 
  ~ 10 years ago , one could take the train from gothenburg/stockholm -  lule\u00e5 / boden/kiruna/narvik for less than * 300kr * . 
  then they swapped train operator ( from t\u00e5gkompaniet to connex , and from connex to sj ) , and the prices skyrocketed . 
  today it 's usually much cheaper to fly those routes , which is kinda absurd . 
  '' * yeah , i 'd happily pay * *** almost double *** * for a boring 24 hour train-ride than for a convenient couple-of-hours flight * . '', 
  yes , the trains were heavily subsidized back then , but removing the subsidies * completely * still does n't does n't make sense . 
  especially not in today 's climate conscious society . 
  the current train operator ( sj ) is owned by the government , have outrageous prices , and is still burdened with heavy losses . 
  it has one of the lowest consumer-satisfaction-scores in the country , for many different reasons . 
  400kr ( x2 ) is what it currently costs to go gothenburg < -  copenhagen with train , and it takes almost 4 hours . 
  at first i thought you had a latvian flag , which for a brief moment led me to believe you were a complete idiot . 
  turns out * i * was the idiot .

   we need a / r/europe meme generator . 
  / r/polandball ? 
  though most of russia lies in asia , 75 % of the russian population lives on the european side of the country ( west of the ural mountains ) , and russia has been closely linked with europe throughout history . 
  the huge ( * huuuuuge * ) central and eastern parts of russia are very sparsely populated . 
  gothenburg , sweden 1 : 7 or 8/10 high-ranked compared to every other city i 've personally seen , but not really * that * good compared to many european cities further south ( in e.g denmark and the netherlands , from what i 've heard ) . 
  fairly good bike lanes in large parts of the city , but it can certainly improve . 
  i like that we have convenient [ pump-stations ] ( http://www.vartgoteborg.se/prod/sk/vargotnu.nsf/1/b883be459a2ddba4c125763800342020/fldimage/0.84?openelement&amp;fieldelemformat=jpg ) here-and-there along the major routes , and also on most of the [ ferries ] ( http://www.styrsobolaget.se/commonresources/files/www.styrsobolaget.se/%c3%84%204%20l%20b%20erik%20ahlquist.jpg ) ... * some * roads are either scary or confusing though .

  have n't been able to replace it yet . 
  4 : yes , and ... well yes , i live in the outskirts , but there are some places more central . 
  5 : technically , yes ... 
  but some people commute 2 \\* 50km or more , so train + walking would be most convenient for them ( only * some * regional commuter-trains allow bikes ) . 
  still lots of people who prefer car for convenience , even though they have shorter commuting distance than me ( < 10km one-way ) . 
  we 've recently implemented a [ congestion-charge system ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gothenburg_congestion_tax ) for motorised traffic , with control points all around the central city , so we 'll see what happens in the near future . 
  6 : yes 7 : [ yes ] ( http://sverigesradio.se/diverse/appdata/isidor/images/news_images/94/2899046_520_292.jpg ) ... but not sure about the coverage , as i 've never really looked into it . 
  an expansion is on its way either way .

  you 're just not allowed to * sell * it within the eu . 
  on the topic though , i 've heard rumors ( true or not ? ), 
  that it 's classified as an * illegal drug / narcotic * on iceland . 
  luckily , eu is n't that harsh .

  if i recall correctly , portugal at least supported sweden in the [ finnish war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_war ) . 
  ^ ( russia vs. sweden ( which * up until then * included finland ) ^ ) ... but it might have had more to do with * russia being supported by both the napoleonic empire and spain * , than you guys being close friends of sweden . 
  southern swedes go to denmark , while northern ( and middle ) swedes go to finland . 
  in haparanda-tornio , swedes go to the finnish side of the city to buy booze on alko ( since it 's cheaper than on systembolaget ) , and the finns go to the swedish side of the city to buy beer on systembolaget ( since it 's cheaper than on alko ) . 
  w * is * a vowel in welsh .

  * one * of the days has instead been dedicated to a *** roman *** god , namely saturn , instead of its norse origin . 
  some people say that it was because the vikings habit of washing themselves *** as often *** as * once a week * was totally outrageous and something completely foreign to the rest of europe at the time , or sometime along the way since . 
  depends on the pace , your bike , how much you have packed , how much you want to see/do along the way , etc. . . 
  i did a long tour as a teenager , through roughly half the country ( edit : north -  south ) ... all in all i was out for two weeks . 
  did 100-180km of biking per day , but also spent a few days in a couple of places along the way ( getting shitfaced drunk , then recovering in my tent for a couple of days before continuing ) . 
  one week of actual biking got me about 2/3 of the way to my final goal , but i then gave up after a little more than 1000km ( out of 1600km planned ) ... 
  doing * the whole * country would be about 2000km , and would [ according to google ] ( https://www.google.se/maps/dir/kummavuopio/ystad/@68.9008237,20.801926,11.43z/data=!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x45d0099e51334f6b:0x64a23dd8eb0c4506!2m2!1d20.865802!2d68.906414!1m5!1m1!1s0x46547d520ab5491d:0x59127c22a563b89d!2m2!1d13.8200308!2d55.4295051!3e1 ) take ~ 110 hours of constant non-stop pedaling . 
  based upon my own experience , doing the whole country in two weeks is manageable ... 
  but you would n't spend much time at places along the way ... ( excluding cooking , eating , sleeping , etc ),

  may however rise again with the success of some new female stars . 
  and for winter-olympics , curling has become a phenomenon the last 10-15 years, 
   as a swede , all countries with multiple official languages are extremely weird to me . 
   i ca n't imagine going to the next town over and have them speak an entirely different language ( not even in the same language family ! ), 
  and yet have them also be swedes . 
  have you ever been in the north of sweden ? 
  many municipalities in the north have two or three official languages ( kiruna and g\u00e4llivare have four ) , and the majority language may vary between villages or districts within the municipalities . 
  northern sweden : * [ palt ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/palt ) black & white i.e 50/50 mix of potato dumplings and [ reindeer blood dumplings ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blodpalt ) , served with fried `` sidfl\u00e4sk '' ( i.e thick bacon ) , butter and lingonberry jam . 
  * [ saut\u00e9ed reindeer ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saut%c3%a9ed_reindeer ) with wild mushrooms , mashed potatoes and lingonberries . 
  * reindeer kebab ; reindeer pizza , cured reindeer ; smoked reindeer ; and moose burgers . 
  * breaded arctic char fil\u00e9ts with potatoes and a lemon wedge . 
  * ptarmigan in whatever form , if you can find i served somewhere . 
  * finish off a meal with vanilla icecream and warm cloudberries .

  i start off with a side-track , just to get it out of the way : if one would consult wikipedia , [ gun related deaths ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate ) the us is behind only honduras , venezuela , swaziland , jamaica , guatemala , el salvador , colombia , brazil , panama , mexico , and uruguay . 
  i.e mostly ( with a few exceptions ) countries you would n't call stable . 
  the firearms deathrate in the us is about 2 1/2 , or almost 3 , times higher than serbia and finland , which are the second and third highest european countries in the statistics . 
  ( montenegro stands * exceptionally high * in the statistics , and is not far behind the us ) ... or more than ** 46 ** times higher than e.g the uk . 
  -- that said ; no , we 're not exactly scared `` shitless '' of guns , but we usually ** do n't see any point whatsoever ** of ** carrying ** a gun in populated areas .
