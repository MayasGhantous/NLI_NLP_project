  it 's not that we do n't own guns ; looking at registered gun ownership , * half * of the top 10 countries are european ; but it 's mostly hunting rifles and shotguns . 
  competitive shooting with handguns is also not * completely * unheard of , but it 's not super-common . 
  other than that , there are very few reasons for owning guns ( the exception is collecting guns with a historic context ) ... and * carrying * guns outside gun ranges or hunting grounds ; no reason at all . 
  the `` personal protection '' reason is completely ridiculous to us . 
  what would we have to protect ourselves from ? 
  * harsh words * ? 
  old thread , but i recently discovered a swedish country band that i actually enjoy : [ bourbon boys ] ( http://open.spotify.com/artist/2ubeusjwhwzu2ul4qa2jft ) what might a swedish country band sing about , you may ask ? 
  well , besides 4x4 trucks , guns , whisky and moonshine : high taxes and public spendings of course !, 
  recommended song : [ taxman ] ( http://open.spotify.com/track/1w09je6jxcrhmfsfku9zdq ), 
   this is the top 100 from sweden yeez , it 's in the comments in the above thread . 
  i made that image from an excel file , previously available from systembolaget 's webpage . 
  here 's the top 50 from last year : http://i.imgur.com/f0ebfbw.png ( more or less the same ) [ source ] ( http://www.systembolaget.se/imagelibrary/publishedmedia/r5it0z1gjmopo80vr100/2014-forsaljning-per-artikel.xlsx ), 
  most * popular * in sweden : https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1ysjgx/most_sold_beers_by_category_in_sweden_2013_at_the/ * best * is a whole other discussion . 
  a few good ones : https://www.reddit.com/r/sweden/comments/1k59l9/whats_the_best_swedish_beer/cblkbyv?context=3, 
  general tips : * try to limit your travels to at most 2 cities per week , though you * could * occasionally cheap out on hostels and other sleeping accommodations and instead sleep on night trains . 
  but generally spent * at least * 3 days in each city . 
  the first day will usually be chaotic , and you will be tired after traveling and the day will be spent acclimatizing and seeing some of the most common tourist attractions . 
  the third day is when you begin to experience the * real * city . 
  * spend up to 10 days or 2 weeks in each country . 
  do n't expect to see `` everything '' in `` every country '' . 
  * buy local pre-paid sim-cards for your phone . 
  just make sure it 's not a cdma phone ( if you 're american ) as those are n't used in europe , and that it 's not carrier locked . 
  there are * very few * operators that will work outside their countries without expensive roaming fees . 
  * buy a cellphone/laptop charger with [ europlug ] ( http://rendezveny.alioth.hu/hapscongress2013/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/euro-plug.jpg ) for 240 v , or 220-240 v , 50hz . 
  it will work in * almost * all of europe , with the exception for u.k , ireland and malta and a rare few more . 
  [ the voltage is the same ] ( http://www.allabroaduk.com/public/admin/power_voltage_around_the_world.png ) there , but you 'll need a cheap plug adapter , as the connector wont fit in the wall sockets . 
  * eastern europe ( e.g baltic countries , poland , romania ) , and parts of central europe ( e.g the czech republic and hungary ) are cheaper than the west and have just as much impressive architecture , cultural heritage , hospitable people and things to do . 
  also the balkan countries . 
  * if you want to camp in the wild and experience nature and solitude for a while i 'd suggest scotland , northern norway and northern sweden for a week or two . 
  also austria and switzerland . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_to_roam * do n't focus solely on the biggest cites . 
  try to visit some smaller cities too , to experience the countries for real . 
  the main centers of the biggest cities are somewhat alike in most countries . 
  * check out www.couchsurfing.org and / r/couchsurfing it 's a great way to meet great hospitable people who can show you around in the cities to find the more hidden gems , and not just the main tourist attractions . 
  * ** and read up on www.wikivoyage.com !!!, 
  ** begin with checking up general areas : balkans , western europe , eastern europe , central europe , scandinavia , etc , and then click around for ** hours ** ... 
  i 'll promise you 'll find * lots * of inspiration . 
   * also / r/travel edit : like many already have stated , general questions like yours wo n't give you many answers . 
  read up , then ask more specific questions . 
  [ way out west ] ( http://wayoutwest.se/lineup ) in gothenburg , sweden [ 7th-9th of august ] some hipster festival followed by : kulturkalaset in gothenburg , sweden [ 12th-17th of august ] a one-week city-festival with all kinds of events : outdoor cinemas , art , lots and lots of street food , performance art , and concerts all the way from classic opera to death metal ... and it 's ** free ** ( edit : kulturkalaset , not way out west ) . 
  the program for 2014 is unfortunately not released yet , but will be availabe at http://kulturkalaset.goteborg.com/ somewhere around mid/late june . 
  top gear , q.i , sherlock , black mirror and red dwarf [ all uk ] all well known series and shows , i assume . 
  dag [ norway ] probably one of the best comedy series i 've ever seen !, 
  the life of a cynical therapeutist who * hates * human interactions , but is surrounded by dysfunctional oddball characters . 
  riget [ denmark ] only 2x4 episodes ( 1994/1997 ) . 
  have n't seen it in ages , so i do n't know if i 'd still like it , but i was very fascinated by it back in the days and bought it on vhs . 
  it 's somewhat ... * unique * ... surreal horror/comedy/drama in an almost indescribable genre of its own . 
  bron/broen [ sweden/denmark ] it 's been extremely hyped ( and already remade several times ) , but it 's a great show which does n't need any further presentation . 
  tusenbr\u00f6der [ sweden ] only two 5-episode seasons ( 2002 and 2005 ) , followed by a movie , which was also shown in an extended version as a 2-episode 3rd season ( 2007 ) . 
  drama series about three childhood friends dreaming about a fancier life and the freedom of becoming their own bosses . 
  they start a small company , painting houses . 
  it works out just fine at first , but after a while their economy drops down the drain and they end up in debt ... and from there things spin out of control ... 
  i really liked it since the characters felt fairly realistic ( well , at least the first season ) , even if they 're doing stupid choices , as opposed to most other tv-series ... 
  it depends greatly on which countries we 're talking about . 
  every country has their own rail companies and bus companies , so it 's difficult to suggest any specific ones . 
  ( unless you go for a eurorail pass ) however , for longer travels than between neighboring countries , you might want to have a look at some of the low cost airlines ' routes , e.g norwegian , ryanair , wizzair , easyjet , etc. . . 
  if you 're planing ahead and look at a wide array of dates some time in the future , and are a bit lucky , you can find flights across europe for basically less cost than a fancier lunch . 
  i was just-for-fun looking at some flights from sweden myself earlier today , and i found a few flights to a few destinations around europe for about $ 15-25 . 
  the catch with those kind of airlines is that they may try to make up for the low prices by overcharching you for luggage , and various weird stuff like `` credit-card fee $ 10 '' , etc. . . just google around for tips and tricks for each of those airlines , on review sites etc , to get an idea how to dodge most of those extra fees . 
  if you 're setting up a `` base '' somewhere where you can store most of your luggage , and just have a light carry-on , you can sometimes get a cheap-as-dirt weekend trip to some other country . 
  just make sure to go through the right channels when booking your flight , to dodge those extra fees . 
  it 's been years since i bought anything bigger than a frying pan from ikea . 
  not aware if there are any similar deals here too , but it may very well be the case . 
  when moving or helping friends moving , we 've always rented transporter vans from gas stations . 
  for alcohol , usually denmark or finland , depending on where in sweden you live . 
  people in the south also go to germany or poland . 
  it 's also fairly common to go to germany to import cars . 
  otherwise , pretty much anywhere ( except norway ) . 
  thailand have the most popular vacation destination for a couple of decades , and people do a lot of shopping while there . 
  i 'm 32 and have never had a driving licence . 
  i currently live in gothenburg , sweden , and i barely know anyone in this city who owns a car , or at least who drives daily . 
  i 'm always amazed by the traffic queues along certain sections of the e6 road , which on certain days can extend for several km . 
  buses , trams and trains are most often more convenient , for all purposes except furniture shopping , but if furniture shopping would be the only real need for a car , it 's cheaper to order home delivery than to rent a truck or car + trailer . 
  however , as soon as you leave the bigger cities/towns , the need for a car becomes more and more apparent . 
  also , without a driving licence , i do miss the freedom to get around in the more rural parts of the country . 
  i once tried biking sweden north to south ; almost the equivalent of biking denmark -  greece ; but i gave up after a little bit over 2/3 of the way due to bad planning ( i was 17 and perhaps a bit naive ) . 
  try looking for older threads in / r/sweden , / r/stockholm , / r/hungary and / r/budapest search for keywords like ` travel ' , ` visit ' or similar . 
  you may of course post an own thread , but there are also many older threads in those subreddits . 
  you * may * be downvoted if your questions are too generic , as they may have been asked many times before . 
  unfortunately , i do n't have any suggestions of my own as i rarely have visited stockholm ( and i 've also never visited budapest , yet ) . 
  whether it 's allowed to camp freely varies greatly between countries . 
  it 's illegal in most of europe afaik . 
  though there are exceptions in northern europe ( norway , sweden , finland , estonia ) and central europe ( austria , switzerland , czech republic ) , and also scotland and belarus . 
  * norway ; just as sweden , but more extreme nature , milder winters and better economy . 
  * denmark ; similar to sweden , but more `` relaxed and liberal '' and closer to continental \\* europe . 
  though very flat and not as easily accessed nature . 
  ^ \\* ^ ( yes , we often see the scandinavian peninsula as an island separate from the rest of europe . ), 
  also : * france , though i do n't get the language * scotland `` though i do n't get the language '' * the netherlands . 
  similar to denmark , but even more relaxed . 
  * most of the germanosphere . 
  not really , but still ... 
  the us * is * in some aspects somewhat like a rebellious teenager , still looking to to develop its identity , and with strong opinions about everything regardless of actual knowledge about the subject or not . 
  somewhat arguing like a stubborn teenager : `` i 'm right and you 're wrong ; lalalalala talk to the hand ! '', 
  sometimes overreacts due to lack of perspective , still being young . 
  that said , it 's also a hard working teenager , that * wants * to do the right thing . 
  excluding swedish films [ the man without a past ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0311519/ ) `` mies vailla menneisyytt\u00e4 '' ( 2002 ) [ the hunt ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2106476/ ) `` jagten '' ( 2012 ) [ the lives of others ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0405094 ) `` das leben der anderen '' ( 2006 ) [ enter the void ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1191111/ ) ( 2009 ) [ taxi ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0152930/ ) ( 1998 ) [ lock , stock and two smoking barrels ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120735/ ) ( 1998 ) [ hot fuzz ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0425112/ ) ( 2007 ) [ l\u00e9on ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110413 ) ( 1994 ) ( well , it 's technically french ), 
  one of my hometowns is actually [ more than 8 times bigger by area ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=area+of+kiruna+%2f+area+of+luxembourg ) ... but then it was once also * the largest city in the world * ( only by area ) , until it was surpassed by some rural town in australia . 
   and yeah , it was a joke though i was also * half * - serious . 
  a high caliber hunting rifle should be assumed to have a safety range of up to 10km ( or even more ) if fired in a high angle ; which you of course never should do ; and from looking at a map i 'd guess that luxembourg less than 40km across in many areas . 
  at least in the east-west direction .
