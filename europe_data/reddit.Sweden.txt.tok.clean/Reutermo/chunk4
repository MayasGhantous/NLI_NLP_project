  every thread about sweden ever is brigaded by mini-trumpers saying that we live in a war zone . 
  i do n't understand what they mean , [ this is the view outside my window ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/78/3a/00/783a0017ea82cd29a4819ccfb4219a22.jpg ), 
  they are yours for the taking . 
  wait , is his name sigmar ? 
  is that a common german name ? 
  i have never heard it outside of warhammer . 
  the norwegians earn more than we do , but everything is more expensive there . 
  a burger can be more than double the cost than it is here . 
  that not really the definition we use here , but it is totally chill if you see it that way . 
  personally i see it as drawing clear definition between `` them '' and `` us '' and being proud of people that did things hundred or thousand years ago , probably ages before the notion of nationalism ever existed . 
  [ you 'll be back ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=21wgwkzdrki ) from hamilton . 
  the whole musical is on spotify , i very much recommend it even if you usually is n't into musicals , it is fantastic . 
  so kind of like all nationalism then ? 
  oceans rise , empires fall and we have seen each other through it all and when push comes to shove i will send a fully armed battalion to remind you of my love, 
  so any other swede wonder what is up with the bluer part up north ? 
  is it because so few people love there that the statics gets weird ? 
  you are free to take it anytime . 
  do we really want terrorists living on airports ? 
  i seriously wonder why it always is the southern accent that is ridiculed . 
  i , with out thinking about it , does a southern sweden accent when i play dumb , and in usa i have understood that the same thing is rather common . 
  that is intresting . 
  i do n't know enough history to argue against that , but it sounds like a quiet simplistic take on the whole situation . 
  but that was the whole thing ataturk was critical of , right ? 
  he thought turkey could be a secular muslim country . 
  i lived in perth in australia a couple of years back . 
  when some pals back home visited we went backpacking . 
  after a few days we come across a little little village name [ pemberton . ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/pemberton,_western_australia ) . 
  according to wikipedia it have a population of around 700 . 
  in the central park they had a statue . 
  [ we did n't get it at first , but on it was everyone from this little backwater town that fought in the wars . ] ( http://media.gettyimages.com/photos/war-memorial-in-pemberton-western-australia-australia-picture-id549517833 ) . 
  this microscopic city sent so many of their sons and husband across the whole world to die in another continent in another world . 
  i think that was the first time i really understood how big the world wars was . 
  and why anzac day is such a big deal in australia . 
  okay , but just start with that the next time !, 
  do n't say that you have science behind your statements when the science says the opposite or that logic dictates something when you ca n't give any proof of it . 
  just say that you think gay people are icky and that they are `` broken '' , that is more truthful . 
  cool . 
  give me a scientific source that says it is a diseases . 
  i have used logic in my previous reply why it is n't a disease because it impair everyday life like a the definition said it would and that the most important thing in today society is n't to reproduce . 
  be kind to point out the flaw in the logic . 
  also , my orginal point was that this was a moral stand by the government , it was you that said that it is up for everyone to decide if something is a disease or not , now it is up to science . 
  do you back on your previous statement ? 
  edit , [ here is a source from american psychology association that says homosexuality is n't a disease ] ( http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/therapeutic-response.pdf ) [ here is a statement from the world health organization that homosexuality is n't a sickness ] ( http://www.salon.com/2014/09/05/a_reminder_from_the_world_health_organization_lgbt_people_are_not_sick/ ) from the last source '' `` [ it ] does n't make sense to put something in a book and say , ` this is a disease , ' when there 's no proof that it is a disease , '' cochran said . '', 
  susan cochran is a psychologist and epidemiologist at the ucla . 
  i know gay couple that have children . 
  and we are n't really animals anymore , our most important thing is n't to reproduce anymore but we have climber higher on that hierarchy of needs . 
  if anything we are to many on this earth so if roughly 5 % of the world population ( the amount that is n't straight according to a quick google search ) decides not to reproduce ( even though they still have the choice in today 's world ) that is n't really a problem . 
  so i stand firm on to say that class homosexuality as a disease is absurd and borderline offensive . 
  according to [ this definition ] ( https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/disease ) a disease must `` impair normal functioning '' . 
  i would argue that being left handed would impair more on everyday life than being attracted to a specific gender , and i still would find it absurd to call that a disease . 
  i do n't know if i agree with you there . 
  can i tomorrow decide that people that are left handed is a disease and they should be treatments for that . 
  or that black haired people are a disease ? 
  this is n't stuff you can simply decide on . 
  i see where you are coming from , but allowing this sort of says that sexuality is something that can be cured , like a disease . 
  which it is n't . 
  i see this more like they are taking a stand than anything else . 
  great . 
  give me a source then . 
  so where is the statistics that this happen ? 
  the sources trump have cited have proved to be false ? 
  so take tot conspiracy theory ass and give me some concrete evidence that this happens . 
  are you stuck on repeat ? 
  they do n't have id laws , but your name stand on a list and you must repeat a number , right ? 
  so how do 11 millions trick that system ? 
  [ and no studies that have been done says that voter fraud is common ] ( http://fortune.com/2016/10/18/studies-contradict-trump-claim-that-voter-fraud-is-very-very-common/ ), 
  because now a leader will govern that a majority of the country did n't vote for . 
  that is common here i sweden , but we do n't have a two party system ( something that i also found absurd that you have in the states ) and coalitions are formed between parties , so atleast a majority of the people will have their representative in the government . 
  that will not happen in the states and i found that absurd . 
  i agree , that is a problem . 
  we have had voices about that here in sweden that the lowly populated is ignored for the bigger cities . 
  i do n't know how the american election is but here we also vote in more local election , which party we want to govern our `` state '' and so on . 
  still do n't fix problems and i agree that the concern is legitimate . 
  still , the person/party that gets the majority of the votes should govern , or atleast form a coalition with another person/party and govern together . 
  that is one of the central things in a democracy . 
  that is way a bigger problem in my eyes . 
  atleast do n't do the whole `` winner takes it all '' in the states can be a nice first step . 
  [ according to this article a study found that 31 out of 1 billions vote was cast by a person that impersonated another ] ( http://fortune.com/2016/10/18/studies-contradict-trump-claim-that-voter-fraud-is-very-very-common/ ) [ here is another article on the same issue . 
  ] ( http://www.factcheck.org/2016/10/trumps-bogus-voter-fraud-claims/ ), 
  and how did 11 million illegal immigrants vote ? 
  i have not a perfect understanding of the american election but do n't everyone who is eligible to vote get a number and a district and than they cross out your name out of a list ? 
  do you say that 11 million played that system ? 
  this is my problem . 
  be racists and afraid on non-white people , hate on universal healthcare all you want and despise gender equality . 
  that is a political position , even is n't it is a stupid one . 
  but why , please why , do you need to be such conspiracy theorists upon that and afraid of facts ? 
  why do you need to think that the rest of the world is conspiring against you and that is the reason for all of your setbacks ? 
  edit : also you completely change your tune . 
  first it was that trump would change his campaign plan so he would win the popular vote , now he lost it because if illegal immigrants . 
  which one is it ? 
  hahahaha , okay . 
  i did n't know your future god-emperor also had the ability to see into other dimensions and see that he would receive more than 2 millions votes more if americas voting system looked differently , but sure . 
  1 , that is the definition of baseless speculation . 
  we literally have no idea what would happen if we live in that alternate dimension where america was a democracy . 
  2 , i am not american so really no of your candidates was mine . 
  i know the reason behind it , it still is absurd . 
  if the entirety of eu was a country and used a similar system i would still think the same thing . 
  yea !, 
  they just want to keep europe white , fight against feminist , think muslims and jews are a diseases , want to deny hbtq people their human right and have a hard-on when they think about totalitarian states , but they will get really cross if you call them racists . 
  i am so relaxed that i would be a liquid if i was more relaxed .
