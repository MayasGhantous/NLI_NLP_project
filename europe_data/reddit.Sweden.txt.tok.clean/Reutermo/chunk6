  i mean , yes . 
  i pay for a lot of roads i never drive on , or for welfare that i never take part of or parents leave for others despite that i do n't have children . 
  that is how the system works . 
  these maps , especially the last , makes it very easy to tell where the majority lives in sweden . 
  what do you mean with bbc ? 
  as a swede i have always felt that they are extremely impartial and are a reliable source often . 
  is n't that the consensus in the uk ? 
  plz no steal wordz :(, 
  do you know how languages work ? 
  i guess that the majority of the words you use are originally from other places . 
  you can make a case for cultural appropriation when a elvis takes a song from a black band , do n't credit them and suddenly makes that sort of music `` cool '' among white people , not when language works like language do . 
  hell , if we shall play that game , `` egg '' , `` cow '' and `` hen '' are norse word originally so we swedes would like to ask you to not use them any more . 
  [ there is some real art nuveo feel over the whole thing ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/0d/8d/01/0d8d0153a2970dd688ddce140e57ae55.jpg ), 
  what is the language in the north of sweden ? 
  is it sami ? 
  and is the west part of finland pink because of the finland-swedes ? 
  i thought many of them also lived in the south western part of finland but that is n't pink !, 
  i sure love good museums !!, 
  i am also planning to bring a couple of great books so would love some nice parks or caf\u00e9s to hang around in when i get tired of all the walking !, 
  all these tips are helping my trip profoundly , 
  mohamed is already now top 35 in the most common given name here . 
  if you are gon na be a bigot try to be up to date at least . 
  i think you are mixing up ethnicites then . 
  niqab really is n't that common in turkey as far as i understand . 
  it is mostly used in saudi arabia and other countries on the peninsula . 
  the last time i visited just walked around and used the trains . 
  really walk friendly town !, 
  you do n't know any good restaurant that is n't to expensive ? 
  i am visiting copenhagen in a couple of weeks , you have any tips of where i should go/what i should see/where i should eat ? 
  i am pretty sure you mix up [ burqas with something else ] ( http://1v1d1e1lmiki1lgcvx32p49h8fe.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/0812-burqa-niqab-hijab-800x325.jpg ), 
  i live in sweden and as all the internet know we are currently being attacked by savages muslim that burn down our land etc etc etc. \u00b4 i work in a library in the outskirt of a city with a big muslim population . 
  many girls wear hijab ( and many muslim girls do n't ) . 
  i think i have seen one girl here in sweden wearing a [ niqab ] ( http://d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_large/public/images/15/09/shutterstock_269101841.jpg?itok=rgnvaf5c ) but i may be mixing up my memories from living in australia where there was quite a lot of saudis . 
  have never ever in my life seen a [ burqa ] ( http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2013/06/14/1226663/736298-burqa.jpg ) here in sweden . 
  did it hurt the piece ? 
  looks like it could easily be removed . 
  i always viewed it as theater . 
  with a lot more homoerotiscm and yelling than usual . 
  i do n't know . 
  maybe it is a version of the [ social democratic party 's logo ] ( http://static-cdn.sr.se/sida/images/493/3395925_2005_2048.jpg?preset=article-slider ) . 
  beneath it is a bust of a old social democratic pm and it looks like a rose next to it , which is the party 's symbol . 
  as a swede i always think it is a bit weird to see other countries having their flags all over the place . 
  i would say that it is quite uncommon to see the swedish flag anywhere else but on a flagpole . 
  why do you assume that ? 
  and i guess that it made the news , that is why people know about it . 
  that is a reason for immigration , right ? 
  why would n't we let them come here if they would be prosecuted that way where they come from ? 
  having no border control at all is having open border . 
  refugees have nothing to do with that . 
  i am from sweden , the country with the lowest age to move out according to the map , and i know no one that have ever been kicked out of their home . 
  after high school people either start working , and soon after get enough money to move out , or they move to another city and starts studying at university , and get money from the government to do that . 
  i think i was the last of my friends to move out from my parents and i was 21 . 
  no one was kicked out . 
  still call my parents every week and travel home every summer/christmas . 
  i do n't speak german , but i would guess by the words that two of those are `` national economy '' and `` social economy '' . 
  pretty sure that the other terms also exist in english , they just is n't one singular word . 
  i see what you are saying , but i think `` preserve '' is the wrong phrase/action . 
  no one was trying to preserve swedish culture when kebab and pizza was getting common here in sweden and now it is as swedish as surstr\u00f6mming . 
  and i think you can be interested culture , you own or anyone else 's , without being nationalistic . 
  like i said , i have a background in cultural anthropology and have worked in/studied museums , libraries and heritage sites . 
  nearly all my colleagues and classmates are very into cultural history and preservation of heritage sites , that is why we work with what we do , but i would guess that extremely few of us would identify us as nationalists . 
  that have always been intresting to me , why it is so uncommon that those who claim to they want to defend the swedish cultures and so actually goes out and gets the education in the necessary field and does just that . 
  i will try not to insult anyone and just reflect my views . 
  the idea of nationalism is very very new and i just think it is something that the rulers prior to the world wars used to create a `` us vs them '' narrative . 
  i find it a bit funny that i as a person who grew up a couple of miles from the norwegian border would have less in common with them on the other side and more in common with someone in sk\u00e5ne which i have never met which is 100 of miles from me . 
  and in this modern globalized world it makes even less sense . 
  why would i have more in common with my neighbor than i would with say a brazilian dude or gal that is into the same stuff that i am ? 
  the whole idea of a `` us vs them '' is very common among nationalist here in sweden , and as a student of cultural anthropology it is extra funny that the try to present culture as something that needs to be preserved and defended and could be threatened by other cultures with cultural exchange . 
  that is not how that works at all ; many hallmarks of swedish cultures comes from other places originally . 
  cultures do n't work in isolation , you ca n't say `` here , but no longer '' and try to preserve something that never really existed . 
  i think that mostly encompasses it ; the `` us vs them '' mentality , the focus on borders and the notion that culture is something that need to be preserved and defended . 
  not when you write on the phone and accidently hold down the a and do n't notice it , 
  that is actually the reason i like the most about eu . 
  it is f\u00e5r from perfect and have a bunch of problems , but it sort of feel like anti-nationalism which i really like . 
  hahahaha , your name sure checks out . 
  i have never met people with bigger inflated egos than americans . 
  and i do n't speak because of `` propaganda '' , i lived in the states for nearly two years way back . 
  lots of nice people . 
  do n't make the country less shit though . 
  some day you will leave too and realize what kind place the states is . 
  but until then , please continue to talk about your country in the same hyper way that a kindergartner talk about his favorite football team . 
  that will sure prove that the rest of the world is living in a `` intellectual vacuum '' . 
  i do n't need a special occasion to bash america . 
  it is fun every day if the week . 
  and yes , rich people give to charities in america to get tax benefits , that is well known . 
  also really intresting to see that all those charities are connected to corporations . 
  even in your charities the capitalism shines through . 
  and i am not saying that every american are selfish or see each other as the enemies , that would be absurd to think that 300 + million people are the same way . 
  but if you do n't think that america is built on individualism where it is every man for them self you really hav n't seen much of the world . 
  as far as i understand it is a cultural thing . 
  the individualistic nature is so ingrained in america . 
  every man and woman for them self , everyone else is an enemy . 
  i am also not a native speaker , but does n't some of these `` corrections '' change the meaning of the sentence ? 
  like changing `` with interest '' to `` carefully '' . 
  right now they really is n't that diffrent from a rich family . 
  they are born into wealth , just as poeple are all over the globe . 
  and democracy is also important here and more want them there than the want them gone . 
  pretty simple really . 
  they are n't really chosen though . 
  they are like our mascot .
