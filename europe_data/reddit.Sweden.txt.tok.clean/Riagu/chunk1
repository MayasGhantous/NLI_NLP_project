there were tons of christian vikings . 
  most runestones are christian gravestones , for instance . 
  i had no idea varg is a married woman . 
  or , alternatively , a staunch socialist who worked tirelessly to oppose both us and soviet imperialism , opposed apartheid and expanded worker 's rights and welfare . 
  the support for the social democrats barely changed during his reign : http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/sv/timeline/f2296ad551502a269d330d35b2e4f0d2.png you might still attribute their later fall to him , but that 's rather subjective . 
  yeah , it 's sort of hilarious when someone does n't consider a country literally named after rome to be `` western '' . 
  albanian would actually have much more merit since it 's a lot more unique than dutch . 
  hey , do n't forget about uppsala !, 
  the city itself is larger than reykjavik proper . 
  there 's kind of a huge difference between 20,000 native speakers ( north sami , the largest sami language ) and 20 ( pite and ume sami ) . 
  ter sami , traditionally spoken on kola , only has 2 left . 
  you probably know more about it than the article writer -- she claims that pite sami is spoken in four countries !, 
  that 's north sami , not pite . 
  what is this supposed mentality ? 
  something that you learned from a / pol / comic ? 
  yeah , mixed economy liberal conservatism is super far left . 
  do you think the only countries outside europe are the us and israel ? 
  as a fairly leftist person who has read up a bit on both sd and ukip , i do n't think it 's fair to compare them like that at all . 
  ukip are at their core an extremely populist party who throw pretty much throw whatever issues that are popular in their party program just to appeal to voters , whereas sd are a much more ideologically based social conservative nationalist party . 
  that 's not an `` invasion '' , then . 
  it 's not `` self-defense '' when there is no actual harm intended , which makes the whole justification for having a gun in the first place moot . 
  it is the exact same thing legally and technologically , you are downloading a video file to your hard drive . 
  that 's really only true for vocabulary , where modern icelandic * is * innovative in creating new words from old roots . 
  this is n't true for morphology and syntax , however , which is where icelandic is commonly cited as exceptionally conservative . 
  it 's complete coincidence that they are similar , romani comes from * \u0159om * , probably originally from sanskrit * doma * , while romania as you notes stems from * r\u014dm\u0101nus * < * r\u014dma * , possibly from etruscan * ruma * . 
  not really ? 
  the copenhagen dialect is actually one of the hardest for swedes in general to understand because it 's a lot more innovative phonologically , personally i find jutlandish a lot easier . 
  japanese has no / si / , / a : / , / l / or / v / . 
  < kuushi para kuutashi para parabana  could be japanese phonologically and phonotactically ( but nonsense on any higher level , of course ) . 
  most ideas of a modern scandinavian/nordic union i have seen would dissolve the modern nation-states and have smaller regions either based on the counties or things like g\u00f6taland , norrland , vestlandet etc , so i do n't think anyone would have `` more power '' . 
  okay , but the conversation was about how important it is to know where things are . 
  serbia is relevant to the us because of recent history , whereas as far as i know montana has not been involved in important international happenings lately . 
  i would consider it fairly important to at least know the approximate location of chicago as well . 
  well , yes , montana has not had much wars within the last century . 
  serbia also has 7 times the population of montana . 
  i would consider it important for every educated citizen to know the locations of their country 's recent military operations . 
  i think germany and russia have `` larger roles in the world '' than california , because that 's what you should be comparing with . 
  that 's like saying `` all countries have murder '' . 
  the degree of difference is tremendous . 
  if you try to bribe a police officer in colombia you 'll probably get rid of your speeding ticket ( if they happen to like you ) , do the same in finland and you 're looking at several years in prison . 
  you might not know this since you 're from the uk , but inside the schengen area all passports are functionally equivalent ( not to mention unecessary , since you can just use your national id ) . 
  it 's really annoying having to bring your passport when you go to britain . 
  no , that is directly descended from proto-indo-european to modern english . 
  frisian is just part of the ingvaeonic languages together with low german and english , more specifically the subgrouping anglo-frisian . 
   it is appearantly the oldest germanic language in the world that they speak . 
  what is this even supposed to mean ? 
  i guess it 's a really silly way of saying it 's conservative , but that is n't really true , it 's just rather similar to english and seems conservative to speakers of english and perhaps dutch because it has less loanwords . 
  the most conservative living germanic languages would be north germanic varieties like elfdalian and icelandic , and even then this is only true according to specific criteria . 
   catalonia never been a kingdom catalonia belongs to the kingdom of aragon catalonia was a county . 
  catalonia is faking our history catalonia is stealing the history of the kingdom of aragon catalans politicians are lying and cheating on his people history catalonia never been a kingdom catalonia alwaais was part of the kingdom of aragon . 
  aragon kingdom free !, 
  remove catalonia, 
  yeah , although i 've gotten the impression that it 's mostly limited to the bergen area , but it would n't surprise me if it 's spread recently , what with traditional smaller dialects dying out . 
  yeah , but phonetically i represented it with some sort of pseudo-bergensk ( the [ \u0281 ] is a voiced uvular fricative , or `` guttural / r / '' in layman terms ) , which is n't really thought of as a dialect close to nynorsk as far as i know . 
  it 's just the second largest standard dialect , so it 's easier to find information about . 
  you could replace [ \u0281 ] with [ r ] to get a more `` standard '' west norwegian , i suppose . 
  edit : other fun phonetic facts : the [ \u00b4 ] and [ \\ ` ] ( which i got wrong at first , edited now ) are called acute and grave accent in swedish or tone ( * tonelag * ) 1 and 2 in norwegian , and sometimes give rise to difference in mening , as in sider/cider / ` si :d \u025br / ( cider ) and sider/sidor / \u00b4 si :d \u025br / ( pages ) . 
  in danish the acute accent/tone 1 instead corresponds to the * st\u00f6d * , a sort of combined glottal stop ( as in * uh-oh * / ' \u028c\u0294o\u028a / in english ) , represented with [ \u02c0 ] as seen above . 
  standardized spelling would n't really make sense for the danes , as it would be even further from their current pronunciation . 
  you could definitely say frisian ( i assume ? ), 
  and dutch are as separate as central swedish and east norwegian , possibly more . 
  my point was to show how swedish and dano-norwegian are separated by lexical differences , whereas danish and swedo-norwegian by phonological ( and that norway is very dialectally diverse ) . 
  scandinavia is definitely dialectally diverse enough to divide it into several languages by most criteria , the issue is rather where to draw the boundaries . 
  there 's a reason linguists prefer to sidestep the issue entirely and work with concepts like dialect continuums , as `` language '' is mostly a matter of political and traditional definition . 
  yes . 
  i guess you 're being more positive ( subverting common stereotypes ) ? 
  no , like , in swedish it 's like `` fornicate '' or something , we joke about * pule * actually being a dirty word in norwegian pretty often . 
  < kk  should be a giveaway . 
  it 's like estonian having \u00f5 and whatnot . 
  i do n't really think so , i think it 's mostly low german influence . 
  the spellings were used interchangeably during the late old swedish period . 
  anti-danish sentiment might have been a factor , but it 's not like with the introduction of < \u00e5  where gustav vasa just wanted to be unique . 
  you 're gravely misrepresenting history . 
  the notion of nationality and an official language did n't exist when sweden ruled what became finland . 
  there were many different peoples living in this area at the time , and they would probably be appalled at the concept of being grouped together with each other in some sort of standardization process , which is essentially what happened all over europe in the 19th century , when we decided to remove local differences because of `` progress '' . 
  of course the finns were wronged against in many ways , but they were still an integral part of the country , no different than the conquest of norrland . 
  we lost finland to russia because we were too weak to fight back , not because we wanted to . 
  the other post is newer than the one you posted and uses a direct source from this month , whereas you 're essentially citing a guy on wikipedia from last month . 
  [ where did you get that impression ? 
  ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php?title=file:distribution_of_young_people_ ( 15 % e2 % 80 % 9329 \\ ) _ as_a_share_of_total_population , _ by_age_group , _ 1.01.2007 _ ( % 25 \\ ) . png & filetimestamp = 20101209133102 ), 
  if you think [ all of these ] ( https://www.google.se/search?q= `` how + do + you + think '' + `` will + look + like '' ) are non-native , then i would disagree ( i do n't think there 's a lot of non-natives discussing the nba on yahoo !, 
  answers , for instance ... ) . 
  and no , you ca n't rearrange the sentence in this case , since it 's a fixed phrase . 
  the discourse particle * like * is semantically and historically unrelated to the lexical verb * look like * ( which originated from * look * + the subordinating conjunction * like * , as in * it looks like europe is on the decline * , cf. 
  * it looks as if europe is on the decline * ) . 
  it 's correct that the construction originated as a mix of * how do you think x will look * and * what do you think x will look like * , but it 's evidently used by some native speakers and is as such acceptable in their speech communities . 
  this is the internet where a lot of different speech communities intersect , so you have to be lenient with regards to sociolectal and dialectal differences . 
  ops title is clearly a lot more grammatical than \\* * what do you think europe will look in 2020 ? 
  * , for instance . 
  according to whom ? 
  the construction seems to have millions of hits on google , so it certainly seems grammatical . 
  there 's a very interesting mini-documentary of sorts on this [ here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn1feagd8sk ) , if anyone is interested . 
  this was news months ago , no idea why the bbc is picking it up now . 
  he does n't seem very violent apart from the murder . 
  euronymous was n't exactly a nice person either , he basically drove another guy ( dead ) to suicide and then used pictures of the corpse for publicity . 
  it 's likely that varg was n't the initial aggressor considering how much of a nutter euronymous was , although the story he uses nowadays is probably not what actually happened . 
  yeah , the only church burning that has any sort of proven connection to varg is fantoft ( which he was n't even convicted for !, 
  ) , due to him having it as a cover on aske . 
  he might still have just been an accomplice or instigated it rather than doing it directly himself , though . 
  not to mention that he is n't a `` neo-nazi '' .
