it was horrible getting through traffic yesterday . 
  i took the bus to school and what should 've taken 20 minutes took 90 minutes . 
  the bus did n't have a grip on the road at times and started sliding . 
  at the end of my trip a bus infront of us slided so it stood oblong on the freeway . 
  not a single car or bus could pass , so we litterally had to walk on the freeway . 
  i 'm pretty sure corbyn did n't want to remain anyway . 
  they do . 
  i 'm not really sure you can say the same about minorities in turkey though ... 
  scandaniva has some beautiful environments . 
  i 'm happy to live here !, 
  and unfortunately alive and well in some areas of the world . 
  would it still be racism and xenophobia if it was it was christian extremists , or maybe left/right wing extremists ? 
  good !, 
  radical practice of any religion has no place in a secular society . 
  i laughed more at that than i should . 
  what does that make turkey , then ? 
  finally he says something right . 
  [ jack did n't have to die !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c1dgm2b0vk ), 
  who knows ? 
  some mp 's may be so ideologically driven and so pro-eu that they 'll vote against it , take the hit , be praised by the eu-loving part of the public and continue their public service in an area where their support of the eu will be a merit . 
  could be a lobby organization , within their party , maybe even the eu or some organization connected to it . 
  i 'm not saying it 's likely , but it 's not impossible . 
   mp 's would be insane to go against it . 
  so your telling me mp 's have to be mp 's to go against it ? 
  [ the medal looks like this . 
  i 'm not really sure i 'd agree with that . 
  our police force is n't in great shape , yes , but they have prevented terrorist attacks from happening . 
  i love the way he started to smile before he said it . 
  hey , i 'm at least happy that the police is still capable of doing their job and arrest them . 
   her lawyer told the bbc he believed the case was politically motivated . 
  no shit . 
  in sweden it 's glenn , because everyone 's called glenn in gothenburg . 
  we had our first snow in stockholm today as well . 
  it turned into slush pretty quickly though . 
  then , in contrast to amnesty international , you say one thing and do another . 
  amnesty actually has done things regarding human rights , which you do not do if you go around punching dogs . 
  left wing or not -- their main focus is still human rights . 
  `` russia is so great , we do n't need human rights organizations ! '', 
   a russian law adopted in 2012 requires any nongovernmental organization that receives funding from abroad and engages in political activity to formally register as a `` foreign agent . '', 
  pretty easy to find enemies of the state with that logic . 
  most definitely !, 
  in a globalized world i believe that we should help as many people as possible . 
  accpeting refugees might not be the most effective way though -- at least at this point . 
  i would rather see more humanitarian aid in the area . 
  i ca n't really say i disagree with him in question ; we should integrate everyone who comes . 
  the problem is that countries , like my own , accepts too many to integrate . 
  it 's essential that they can actually integrate and feel like swedes . 
  currently it seems as most of them kind of live `` next to the society '' ; like an enclave in the country . 
  so he becomes a moldovan citizen just to vote in the second round of their presidential election ? 
  i wish i could 've done that in the u.s. primary . 
  what 's there to tell ? 
  it 's believed that the origin to why christians celebrate `` all saints day '' is in pagan tradition . 
  the equivalent of what 's displayed in op 's picture . 
  [ the building in question . 
  ] ( http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/660/cpsprodpb/bd34/production/_92163484_townhall.png ), 
  yup !, 
  i 'm swedish and we were [ neutral but not really neutral , ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-alyxqodstk ) in world war i , so we did n't really have `` a horse in the race '' so to speak . 
  i do believe ww1 is kind of overlooked in swedish schools . 
  instead of focusing on the conflict itself we look at it as the inevitably outcome of the power struggle between the european powers as well as the prelude to ww2 . 
  that means most of the focus when talking ww1 is on the imperialist period , the 1800 's and the time between the two wars . 
  but we do also learn about the war and the horrible parts of it ; just not as in-depth as other parts of history . 
  oh yeah , that 's right !, 
  now that you mention it , i remember learning that in school . 
  [ this is from stockholm . 
  ] ( http://stockholmourwa.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/sv/files/2015/10/skogskyrkogarden.jpg ) we may not be religious , but we still remember and mourn our deceased relatives . 
  [ when you meet your literal god . 
  the same goes for sweden , but there 's a different between energy and sugar drinks . 
  it 's my understanding that the ottoman empire was pretty tolerant towards other religions . 
  perhaps not tolerant from today 's viewpoint , but tolerant compared some of the things we see today in the same region . 
  there are horrible exceptions of course , like the armenian genocide . 
  anyone wondering why the nordic countries are n't up there it 's because we do n't have a minimum wage . 
  the labour market 's partners ( union and employer ) settle for a certain wage in a certain area of work . 
  waiting for the obligatory black market where pre-16 year olds will buy soda underground from their `` sugar dealer '' . 
  ** edit : ** or their parents , which would make their fathers `` sugar daddies '' . 
  `` no , they could n't possibly ! '', 
  czech republic is probably the most atheist , but according [ this study ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_341_en.pdf ) ( go to page 381 ) ; a higher percentage of swedes than estonians do not believe in a god or any other spiritual force . 
  it was conducted in 2010 though , so it could 've changed . 
  it fills my cold , dark , northern heart with some joy . 
  i love berlin . 
  it 's my favorite city to go to . 
  my thoughts and condolences go out to the victims , their families and the citizens of berlin . 
  / r/sweden declares neutral , while we provide precious memes to the side we think are currently winning . 
  when he finally says something right , he 's criticized ... ? 
  that watermark though ... 
  i fear that shit too . 
  someone needs to put russia in its place . 
  otherwise they 'll most likely do whatever they want . 
  that 's expected in my opinion . 
  if you live somewhere and have established a life there you would probably be pretty keen to keep that . 
  with the risk of having to go back home , you apply for a citizenship to stay the eu country . 
  hey !, 
  people should be able to do gay porn if they want . 
  the christmas bonus is universal thing that should be applied to everyone . 
  it 's not good to treat any group different just because of religion . 
  i bet they do n't have a bonus for muslim holidays . 
  if muslim workers do n't want to use their bonus for christmas shopping that 's fine , but they should still get the bonus . 
  no , they were born in the 19th century . 
  [ the 1800s is a period between the years of 1800-1899 . 
  yes .
