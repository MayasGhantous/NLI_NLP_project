  very sad . 
  she does n't have a birth certificate that can prove her age . 
  she has pretty much just said when she when she was born , and no one could disprove it . 
  that means she ca n't prove it either . 
  her age is n't verified and her daughter has even said that sara 's identification papers belong to someone else . 
  she moved to sweden in 1982 , and has not yet proved her aged . 
  the authorities here have , on numerous occasions , asked her to return to turkey to determine her age , which she has not done . 
  it 's believed that she 's around 30 years younger than what she claims . 
  it should also be noted that her daughter was born in 1969 , when sara was supposed to be ~ 70 years old , which seems highly unlikely . 
  it 's supposed to be the last person born in the 1800s who 's still alive . 
  my mistake . 
  it should obviously be that she was the last person born in the 1800s who 's still alive , not that she was the last person born in the 1800s . 
  my mistake . 
  [ here 's her wikipedia page , if anyone should be interested . 
  i 've never understood why you danes a have a ripped , shirtless santa claus on your coat of arms . 
  to each their own i guess . 
  [ we have 4 .

  wait ... have n't we been through this already ? 
  or is sharia police actually ** this ** common in germany ? 
  a yes or no referendum will always result in a `` tyranny of the majority '' . 
  there will always be one side that will be pissed since they did n't win . 
  watching `` the crown '' really confirms that he truly is the prince of banter . 
   other parties need to create an attractive alternative to it . 
  the only issue is that le pen 's policy on immigration is already very popular amongst the populace . 
  good for them !, 
  a smaller influx of immigrants will certainly facilitate integration and reduce some pressure put on the danish welfare state . 
  however , their defintion of harassment is really soft compared to ours . 
  there you can rape your wife and it would be considered legal . 
  if they do n't like how things are in the west and how people behave , why do n't they move elsewhere ? 
  i 've heard saudi arabia would be in there taste . 
  or it could be because people are rejecting the system and do n't want it anymore . 
  they do n't feel as if the eu is actually doing anything for them . 
  it 's the exclusive kind of marxism . 
  til luxembourg is a marxist paradise with no class divisions . 
  funny that poland was pretty early , now when they try to ban it again and all . 
  there are stories here in sweden that it was `` common '' that women went to poland to get an abortion when it was illegal/strictly limited here . 
  wonder if it 'll be the other way around , if they ban it . 
  i was going to write this . 
  the party has had problems with pro-russian members . 
  so much so that they 've actually went on an [ anti-russian counteroffensive ] ( http://www.sydsvenskan.se/2016-09-28/sd-pa-antirysk-motoffensiv-i-putilovaffaren ) ( article in swedish ) to persude members not to sympathize with putin . 
  `` i 'm with her '' ? 
  okay poland ... keep doing you ... i guess . . ? 
  what ? 
  or it could be their inability to actual listen to people 's concern without giving them labels . 
  i completely agree . 
  this will also most likely do the opposite to what they wish to achieve . 
  it 's just a senseless and horrible act by a bunch of messed up people . 
  one step closer to becoming a full blown theocratic state with religion pretty much dictating everything . 
  i feel truly bad for the turkish people . 
  ... and britain . 
  however , he is a europhile who was involved in the making of the lisbon treaty -- an eu treaty . 
  he 's also the former secretary general of the european convention and was the uk 's permanent representative to the european communities/european union in brussels from 1990 until 1995 . 
  in other word , he has ** a lot ** to do with the eu . 
  people connect him to the union , since he 's actively worked for it for several years . 
  even if he 's not involved anymore , his statement does n't bring any good press to an organization which some brits and other european 's lost faith to . 
  i 'm sure calling britions stupid will make them regret their decision to leave . 
  it 's not like it would fuel further resentment towards the eu or anything . 
  please ; direct me to the law that says that it 's illegal for some people to ** apply ** for asylum . 
  everyone may apply for asylum , but most people wo n't be granted . 
  who 's been convicted in a court for seeking asylum ? 
  edit : clarification edit 2 : what 's illegal is to lie to the authorities about your origin or to stay in a country even though your application has been denied . 
   the thing is who wants sharia law ? 
  [ 10 years ago 40 % of british muslims wanted sharia law . 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1510866/poll-reveals-40pc-of-muslims-want-sharia-law-in-uk.html ) i do , unfortunately , not think the number is any lower today , but feel free disprove me . 
  robbing a bank is illegal , trying to cross the mediterranean to apply for asylum is n't . 
  ** edit : ** let me clarify . 
  the act of applying for asylum is not illegal . 
  i can do that in any country ? 
  will it be granted ? 
  lying to the authorities however , is illegal . 
  sure , but you ca n't blame them for wanting to come . 
  this !, 
  the unnecessary loss of a human life is always saddening . 
  we should n't blame people for coming and seeking a better life . 
  most people want to live in the west since our living standard are higher and things are , in general , better here . 
  it 's human nature to seek that . 
  however , that does n't mean that we ca n't put demands on people who are coming here ; like that they have to integrate etc. 
  and if you want to blame anyone , i 'd blame the politicians for allowing this crisis to happen , instead of dealing with it in a better way . 
  that 's the real issue here . 
  considering how good some of the european parties ' success would be for russia , i 'm not surprised . 
  it was wrong of me to say that someone said it was weird , but i 'm used to people saying : `` look !, 
  britions do n't want to live in britain because of brexit . '', 
  what i meant by it was that chance is that they do n't want to live in britian in the first place . 
  is n't really that weird to be honest . 
  if you live in another eu-country you most likely do so because you like it there . 
  applying for citizenship would then be the obvious action if you want to stay . 
  this is really sad and i feel as if our politicians do n't really deal with it . 
  they say that they 'll will , but nothing happens . 
  i have jewish friends who used to be fairly open about their jewish faith , but now they just remain silent . 
  some of them are afraid that physical harm will be caused upon them . 
  there have also been occasions where jews walked through some of the `` ghettos '' here in sweden and had eggs thrown at them . 
  several people also chant that they should go back to the gas chambers and `` hitler did nothing wrong '' . 
  this problem truly is a clash of cultures that more people need to recognize and do something about . 
  kind of childish that so many people actually want britian to do bad just because they do n't agree with their decision to leave . 
  is n't it just the individual banks that offer that in denmark ? 
  here it would be instituted by the central bank . 
  it 's actually the biggest union in sweden . 
  no , but we 're the only one who actually make it into an issue . 
  it 's accurate , but it is n't publicly funded .
