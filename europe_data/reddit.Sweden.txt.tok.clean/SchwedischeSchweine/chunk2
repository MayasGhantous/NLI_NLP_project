  i know you were n't irrelevant , it 's a light-hearted joke !, 
   as for the iberian thing , it could be so i suppose ... i mean portugal was even ruled by a spanish king for like 80 years in the late 1500s and early 1600s so people might have seen them as united, 
  well it would be interesting to know . 
  especially considering the swedes and the danish were more or less constantly at each other 's throats . 
  and then there was russia ... not saying it would have been more than france , austria or england but i feel like we would have been up there ( not that that 's a good thing really ) strange that he did n't provide any definition for what he considers `` major '', 
  [ we still have n't forgiven you !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_warship_mars ), 
  i mean we did [ defeat the russians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_svensksund ) that does n't really say much though ... 
  yeah that and the little thing called the viking age . 
  people might have thought we were still like that . 
  also , sweden just loooved seafood . 
  more likely though it 's just a cheeky jab at us for failing to build the vasa properly , yes , 
  ah yes , bold claim from someone who is not relevant enough to be included ;d, 
  what 's counted as a `` major war '' under this definition ? 
  undaunted is better tbh :p fear nothing but fear itself !, 
  true . 
  5ft10in person here :( that 's 1.78 m in real numbers, 
  * norway in some things they all beat us , but norway and sweden tend to be top , in that order, 
  strong belief of superiority ?!!, 
  you clearly have n't heard of [ jantelagen !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/law_of_jante ) big monopoly ? 
  [ 90 % of all companies and resources are privately owned !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_sweden ) i ca n't tell if you 're trolling/joking/whatever or if you 're ignorant , but that 's ok . 
  the point of this is to state what you think , and that it may be wrong . 
  however , do n't say that things are true when you clearly do n't know that they are !, 
  ( and they 're not ), 
  i can vouch for this too . 
  i do n't know why , we 're just reserved towards people we do n't know . 
  well , most of us anyway, 
  good thing global warming is n't real , right mr. trump ? 
  i played with all of these at some point in my childhood ... and i 'm only 20 !, 
  so they obviously stuck around for a while , longer than any fidget spinners will, 
  i buy from [ norrmejerier ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/norrmejerier ) because it 's locally produced  i 'm sure you danes are not too bad at it, 
  yeah , mars_needs_socks explained it well . 
  it 's a very gamey taste , not at all like pork or beef . 
  dry moose is n't very good ... very rubbery , imo, 
  arla is danish !!!!!, 
  :d * ehem * sorry i may have spent too long at r/swarje :p, 
  umm ... yes ? 
  it does n't take like beef , so i do n't see why you 're saying this, 
  that 's where ikea is based !!!, 
  yay !, 
  xd apparently it 's too much to ask of them to stay in sweden * sigh *, 
  i 'm guessing you were in a city ... there are no windmills in the city mate !, 
  also , it was said tongue-in-cheek . 
  i am well aware that these are stereotypes . 
  but every stereotype has some truth to it, 
  it tastes ... meaty . 
  i do n't know xd i ca n't think of anything to compare it to . 
  and it 's been a while since i last had it ask r/sweden why dont ` cha ? 
  if you 're really curious . 
  they might be better than me at comparing it, 
  i did n't imply sweden has shit cheese . 
  i did n't really know if we had any cheese . 
  which is dumb because i eat v\u00e4sterbottensost all the time * facepalm * and how dare you ?!, 
  the gripen is sacred !!, 
  maybe , i 'm hardly a cheese expert . 
  but we 're certainly not up there with the surrender monkeys and the stoners ;d, 
  haha , i will !, 
   but it 's not that close ... by northern swedish standards maybe , but it 's still about 170 km :d, 
  that 's northern sweden , where i live ... strange i did n't know of this !, 
  we eat a lot of moose - and reindeer meat , but i 've never had cheese from them before, 
  wish sweden had cheese ;(, 
  people already use proxies , like the source here states . 
  as usual nothing will change, 
  ah , the netherlands . 
  land of the tulips and windmills . 
  you really captured what everyone associates with the netherlands in this photo !, 
  well , apart from the wooden shoes and the drugs :d, 
  let 's hope so . 
  brexit was silly to begin with, 
  this assumes that the eu can get along . 
  in my experience , that is highly unlikely even for the smallest of things . 
  why bully anyone ? 
  i do think it 's reasonable to expect everyone to do their fair share . 
  but how would `` bullying '' help ? 
  exactly this . 
  sanctions will only mean these corrupt governments embezzle more of the revenue from their countries ' productions themselves to compensate . 
  people will get even poorer and will be even more keen on leaving . 
  if anything , helping them where they are is the best solution . 
  you know what else wo n't be tolerated ? 
  shooting innocent unarmed people ^ ^, 
  then explain what you 're saying . 
  you 're clearly saying they `` have to go back '' regardless ... that either means drowning or death upon arrival back home , most likely, 
  i am obviously speaking from a swedish perspective , why would i speak from the perspective of someone else ? 
  and secondly , what is `` meat shield country '' supposed to mean ? 
  `` most militarily competent nation in europe '' would be more accurate , during the late 1600s and early 1700s . 
  and swedish vikings founded the rurikid imperial dynasty and named russia , they should be more grateful, 
  in sweden too . 
  i do n't think it 's unreasonable in some situations that immigrants should adapt to us . 
  why should it be ?!, 
  they 're coming to us !, 
  dude , it 's time to let go of living 75 years in the past, 
  russia will never join the eu . 
  they will never be allowed , and more importantly still i really do n't think they 're interested, 
  russia has never been a friend and neighbour . 
  not ever . 
  not in the 1600s , and not now . 
  i do n't see why new leadership would be different, 
  how about you use real english words next time ?
