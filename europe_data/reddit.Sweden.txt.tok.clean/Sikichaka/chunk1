pff ... licorice is like popcorn . 
  sure , you * can * eat it unsalted , but why would you ? 
  it does n't live up to its potential if you do . 
  it resonates pretty poorly here too . 
  not terribly unsurprising when you consider what our national day celebrates . 
   i doubt even a fraction of those wanting to join eu would be for a new kalmar union . 
  i 'm not sure those two groups would have much overlap . 
  they 're two quite different ideas , with different goals , and do n't really work that well together . 
  in the eu you really have more power apart than you would together . 
  pro-eu people generally favor the type of nordic cooperation we have through the nordic council and such , but not a nordic union . 
   nordic council ( nordiska r\u00e5det ) and the nordic council of ministers ( nordisk ministerr\u00e5d ) are steadily integrating the region more and more they 're not really though , are they ? 
  they certainly did a lot in the '60s and '70s , but ever since three of us joined the eu they 're significance has lessened and they 're for the most part just playing upkeep . 
  i 'm pretty sure you 're supposed to throw salt over the shoulder here too when breaking mirrors and such . 
  the spitting thing is only for black cats as far as i know . 
  i assume it comes from that seeing black cats crossing paths only really happens when you 're outside and may not have salt as readily available . 
  bad luck is seemingly considerate to such things . 
  but i do n't know , i 'm not an expert on these matters . 
  keeping up with proper superstition etiquette seems like hard work . 
  bad luck . 
  but you can negate it by immediately spitting three times over your shoulder iirc . 
   i thought `` dude you are not on an island '' effectively we have been throughout history , it was in fact believed we were for the longest time . 
  in germanic philology the scandinavian peninsula was never considered part of the continent . 
  the fact it technically connects in haparanda was unknown for a long time and means nothing in practice . 
  and i mean , even the channel tunnel is older than the \u00d8\u0308resund bridge . 
  but as others have said i too have never heard anyone using ` continentals ' , ` down on the continent ' is pretty common though . 
  i 'm pretty sure there are about as many different definitions as there are countries ... 
  personally i 've found northern europe to usually refer to the nordic - and baltic countries , and the netherlands as western european . 
  but it can too can be considered northern . 
  no definition is unanimous . 
  though i 'm not sure i 've ever heard the netherlands being central european . 
  i mean , i would n't categorize those people as * `` a foreigner wants to learn more about your country '' * . 
  i 've at least never met a person who expresses themselves like that who 've actually been interested in learning anything . 
  i honestly have no clue where that comes from . 
  i 've lived in a lot of sweden , and i have never in my life seen a home without venetian blinds in the windows . 
  most also have curtains for decoration . 
  and , in addition to those , there are plenty of blackout roller blinds too , especially in bedrooms and the further north you go . 
  try living in areas with midnight sun without having something to keep the damn thing out . 
  i 've got all three for my bedroom window and the former two in all other windows . 
  i do n't use them much except when the sun is disrupting my sleep , but i do have them . 
  and just for the record i do keep my underpants on . 
  i think it 's pretty much v\u00e4stmanland , gotland and the coastal provinces north of \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland that 'd say finland . 
  n\u00e4rke and \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland may also to a smaller extent . 
  scania ( and to a smaller extent blekinge , halland and southern sm\u00e5land ) can be a little split between denmark and norway in my experience . 
  everything else would probably say norway is the closest . 
  i think . 
  but this is of course purely based on personal experiences and anecdotal evidence . 
  i have no clue about reality . 
  you can divide sweden in half . 
  the eastern half is more likely to go with finland , the western half norway . 
  in some of the southernmost areas you 'd get a fair share of votes for denmark too . 
  people from places like the bothnian coast , uppsala , and stockholm will generally say finland , which is where i 'd wager / u/ercarret is from . 
  where i live the plurality would say norway , i assure you . 
  but this is like forcing a mother to pick a favorite child . 
  we love you both . 
  our national anthem is n't official , so ... that ? 
  otherwise i 'd nominate the drinking song [ * helan g\u00e5r * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/helan_g%c3%a5r ) :  when sweden 's ice hockey team won the 1957 world ice hockey championships in moscow , not all of the swedish players knew the lyrics to * du gamla , du fria * , the de facto swedish national anthem , so the players sang * helan g\u00e5r * instead . 
  not sure if it 's a simple as the very next person on the list or something else , but it is from the party . 
  i suppose , yes . 
  ministers are relieved of their duties to the parliament and have a substitute hold their mandate while serving in the cabinet . 
  it 's not required to be a member of parliament to become a minister . 
  yeah , i agree , it 's such a shame . 
  it 's not their fault they were born to such an awful name . 
  but one of them did manage to become a pretty decent hockey goalie . 
   svedupelle do you have ` sve ... ' words for things relating to sweden too ? 
  it 's not just ` ruots ... ' ? 
  they 're not common , but there are a few . 
  for example ( number of people according to the national bureau of statistics scb ) : 2582 * norrman * ( `` norwegian '' ) 1062 * svensk * ( `` swede '' ) 379 * nordman * ( `` norseman '' ) 374 * tysk * ( `` german '' ) 118 * grek * ( `` greek '' ) 98 * finne * ( `` finn '' ) 55 * dansk * ( `` dane '' ), 
  they 're certainly frist names , but you ca n't really say they 're surnames , can you ? 
  we have a bunch of `` finn-jokes '' . 
  names that are perceived as sounding finnish , but mean something in swedish . 
  like :  * `` who 's finland 's worst berry picker ? 
  '' * -- * `` maski hallonen '' * in swedish * ` mask i hallonen ' * means `` worms in the raspberries '', 
  the rule is actually true . 
  native words with a ` k ' followed by a soft vowel like ` e ' , should really have a soft ` k ' . 
  only issue with him using that argument to make his point is that ` kex ' * is * a loan word ... 
  not if my etymological dictionaries are anything to go by , according to them we have it referred to 100 years before you guys . 
  in both languages it 's described as a loan word from the english ` cakes ' . 
  ` cake ' itself interestingly having originated in the old norse ` kaka ' , which also still exists in the modern nordic languages . 
  i do n't . 
  not close enough relatives for me to know about anyhow . 
  * i * used to , but i 've since moved back . 
  i 'm not entirely sure what a summer camp entails , but when i was in the scouts we had such camps during summer . 
  there 's really no shortage of areas here , even in the south . 
  even if it 's mostly because of the empty north , sweden does have 33 % lower population density than the us . 
  can unfortunately not say i was , i was n't out drinking when i was there . 
  there 's not exactly a shortage of swedes going to the tricity . 
  poland 's been increasing in popularity in general and the ferry does go straight to gdynia . 
   i am still flabbergasted why norwegians would want to come here they were a sovereign kingdom that ended up in a union that lasted from the 16th century to ~ 1800 . 
  you were a sovereign kingdom that ended up in a union that lasted from the 16th century to ~ 1800 . 
  we were in a personal union with you , we were in a personal union with them . 
  their future was determined by a treaty between the danes and us , followed by a swedish invasion . 
  your future was determined by a pact between the nazis and soviets , followed by a nazi invasion . 
  you were occupied by nazis after an invasion , they were occupied by nazis after an invasion . 
  of course they like you , you 're quite clearly the norway of central europe . 
  now go out and find your oil . 
   but i mean , why would n't you go to poland ? 
  not only is it a nice country in general , but it 's a good country to study social sciences , history and stuff . 
  i mean , the swedish paycheck [ is n't that much lower ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/median_income#gallup_gross_median_household_income ) , but my school still did n't send us down to you guys ... :'( and we were a fair bit closer than anyone in norway could possibly have been . 
  maybe they were afraid we 'd go all charles x gustav at the sight of poland , i do n't know . 
  :( but you know , i did eventually find my way to poland on my own !,
