   you can not run a country with no money . 
  and would it really be that bad if politicians no longer had unlimited power to `` run '' a country ? 
   who and what builds your infrastructure ? 
  maybe those who wants a road from a to b ? 
  who builds the houses ? 
  the people who wan na live in it . 
  if people can build a house , why ca n't they build a road ? 
   the government needs to pay it 's workers as well you know so not paying tax means government workers do n't get payed maybe i do n't think that the government `` need '' to have any employees . 
   so you are doing the complete opposite . 
  no , i am being totally rational from my value system . 
  i really do n't want to support the greek goverment . 
  if the greek people do n't want to pay taxes to their goverment i not gon na come as an outside an try to force them to pay taxes to their own government . 
  if the governments services are so awesome people would pay for them voluntarily . 
  just like people choose to pay for everything else . 
  i rather give my money to the greek people than to greek taxes so i will ask them not to give me a receipt . 
  wow . 
  that 's a pretty cool idea . 
  i guess you are blind to what the economic research says about euro and hope that the euro will work even if it is designed to not to work ( kinda like hoping a boat with a big hole wo n't sink )  who knows , maybe all research is wrong and the euro is a great idea , 
  well , first of all you can still export without the euro . 
   second of all you do n't need to go back to your old currencies but there could be smaller currency areas with countries similar to each other like your close neighbors . 
  there are rule but no one has followed them , no one is following them and they will not follow them in the future because they ca n't be enforced . 
  even france keeps breaking the rules over and over again . 
  the way the euro zone is designed today you will keep paying and paying forever for the mistakes of other countries but i guess if you think its worth keep paying for others and for having less good economies than they could be without the euro i guess your fine . 
  but the thing is that if you want to keep the euro you will end up with either 1 ) crises resulting from a ) overspending by countries like greece because other members must bail out them to preserve the euro b ) over or understimulation of the countries that have the lowest and higest growth ( the current situation is bad for greece and germany because greece should probably have less interest rate to stimulate the economy and germany needs a higher interest rate to avoid building bubbles in germany ) or 2 ) the countries need to give up their sovereignty over fiscal matters too and have a parliament in eu that decides taxes and spending for all europeans . 
  you ca n't keep it like it is now without getting a lot of more crises . 
  is it really worth all that human suffering just to be able to go on vacation without exchanging your currency ? 
  that 's why i hope greece does something radical ( like just printing 10 trillion euros with their printing presses ) and leaves the euro so that other countries in the euro see they can also leave and this whole project will be dismantled . 
  eu is a great project but the euro was just a big bet by politicians in the 80s that eu would be a united states of europe by the time the euro was implemented . 
  they were wrong and i do n't think most europeans actually want to give up their national sovereignty and become one big country so its better to just go back to national currencies or smaller currencies ( i 'm sure we can all survive exchanging our money when going to vaccation ), 
  yes , but they are still more integrated than germany and greece for example . 
  people trade and move between california and wisconsin to a larger extent than between germany and greece . 
  both california and wisconsin share the same federal polices and laws too while the same ca n't be said of germany and greece ( eu is still pretty small in its scope , still the national govt that have most of the power ), 
  yea , you can even prove that the euro is a bad idea . 
  the optimal currency area allows for calculating if its a good idea . 
  a common currency is only a good idea if there members of the currency has economies that are very similar to each other ( like the states in us ) . 
  it does n't work when the economies have different needs . 
  if greece needs low interest rates and germany high interest rates its going to be a problem with having a common currency with just one interest rate set by the ecb . 
  they adopted the euro because they thought it would make all the econonies in the eu very similar . 
  they were wrong and now we are paying the price . 
  well , considering that you made the statement `` it 's only the former that is happening . '', 
  which is clearly false . 
  is it really condescending to call out out someone for making untrue statements ? 
  i hope you are aware there there are thousands and thousands people writing new tech laws at this moment . 
  the eu commission is filled with techie eurocrats writting tech laws . 
  i do n't know if you think that cameron is the only person in the entire europe writting laws ... ( besides `` he '' is n't writing the laws . 
  they are made by committees of bureaucrats probably including many technicians ), 
  cameron is 1 of millions of lawyers . 
  there are millions of technicians who would love to make laws that would be terrible . 
  i fully agree that its harmful with a lawyer that does n't understand tech making tech laws and harmful with a technician making tech laws without understanding law . 
  no one should make laws unless they understand what they are making laws about . 
  the words used by swedish redditors . 
   greek greece want sweden country why money eu right state europe point the ** greeks ** in ** greece ** wants ** sweden ** , another ** country ** , as their accomplice in a heist . 
  ** why ** ? 
  because of the ** money ** in ** eu ** can be stolen if you just hit the ** right ** ** state ** in ** europe ** . 
  ** point ** taken and sweden accept the invitation . 
  they invented it after all so they can always reinvent it . 
   to illustrate my point , i will pick-up a really recent example : how come a lawyer could debate on internet regulation without knowing shit about everything involved here ? 
  to be fair there is a lot of lawyers with a computer/programmer background . 
   there is a problem though when you have technicians debating regulation without fully understanding how the law works ( and how it does n't work ) . 
  if he believes in intelligent design , how does he explain the danish language ? 
  that can hardly be the result of intelligent design . 
  we just crave attention ... see us ... we cut ourselfs so that someone will care ... love us ... 
  yehhh we are famous, 
  and he is n't really right wing like sd . 
  he is liberterian and sd is socialconservatives . 
  sick :( not suprised but still sick, 
  i would be pretty bummed out by a civil war breaking out anyday . 
   would n't it be ironic if all of this led to a civil war in europe . 
  how would that be ironic ? 
   you know the common points between rapes in germany , women groped in morocco , rapes in india and rapes in tahrir square ? 
  different cultures valueing women lower than men . 
  the what ? 
  wow , i thought it was only a swedish tradition !, 
   better than surstromming anyway ahhh ... but we do n't really eat that ... we just give it to tourists as a joke ... 
   ( asides fae the shite weather and everyone having fucked off ) : and haggis . 
  that probably contributes to the overall miserableness in scotland . 
   warsaw to kutaisi for as low as like $ 30 . 
  awesome . 
  visit now . 
  i wanted to visit geogia for a time but been put of by the high prices to fly there ( 800 eur last time i checked to fly to geogria from sthlm and back ), 
  the same country that sold supplys to the allies at the same time . 
  the sneaky sweds who look so innocent and always stay out of the conflicts to profit from them , 
  nooooooo !, 
  we are your friends . 
  i do n't know which side you are on but we are your friends .
