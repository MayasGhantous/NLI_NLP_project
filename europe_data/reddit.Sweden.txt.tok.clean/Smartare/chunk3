  that is awesome . 
  had no idea they had so varying traditions within poland . 
  i mostly know polish ppl in warsawa so thought everyone else had the same traditions . 
  sure , i guess the german guy/girl dont wan na take the national socialist denial discussion today ... although i doubt the rest of europe think its `` just a stupied discussion '' that we should forget ... europe will never forget what the german national socialists did ... 
  of course  is it good that the swedish press is kept under control by the state to a certain degree ? 
  just because sweden is n't perfect does n't mean that other countries in europe should strive to make the mistakes sweden has made , right ? 
  sure the national socialist were n't socialist ... . 
  state control of media is bad . 
  you are right . 
  a member of the warsawa pact, 
  i promise i am not stefan l\u00f6fven ( the swedish pm ) . 
  just because i am swedish does n't mean i agree with the socialist government . 
   do you agree with every polish politican ? 
   right-wing governments communist parties are n't much better . 
   so maybe not everything is lost yet . 
  except the swedish welfare state will be broken permantely within 2 years according to a leftish economist ( so no bias here since he supports the current government ) if the current trends continue . 
  so i think we are pretty screwed . 
  yup , i believe in you guys . 
  i think polish people wo n't tolare this for too long . 
  still many former sovjet states that did n't embrace liberty and a market based system to the same extent as poland did . 
  umm ... what ? 
  i was talking about poland and not sweden . 
  do i think that the socialist goverment in sweden is awesome ? 
  does it have anything to do with poland ? 
   at this point probably more so than even the hungarian government . 
  in what way ? 
  hey ... not every swede supports the crazy socialists policies ... heck thats why i am sad because poland seems like a perfect country to move to when sweden collapses . 
  compared to other former sovjet countries . 
  is poland a better place today than in 1989 ? 
  yes . 
  is it perfect ? 
  no , but it has moved in the right direction . 
  out of all former parts of sovjet poland is one of the ones that made most progress . 
  nah , do n't be too sad . 
  all of europe is going crazy . 
  all you have to do is being less crazy than everyone else and you will be fine . 
  poland into space ? 
   nazis come on . 
  they are not national socialists . 
  they might be a bit nationalistic but they are hardly hardcore national socialist \u00e1 la german style . 
  too be fair uk and polands history is pretty different . 
  poland always ends up getting screwed by everyone else to the west and the east while uk ( excluding your weird colonies ) has never been occupied in modern time . 
  so its not that weird they have some trust issues . 
  come on poland :( you were heading is such a great direction . 
  1 ) exactly which eu instrument are you refering to ? 
  2 ) it 's totally irrelevant . 
  sweden can say : `` we give zero benefits to immigrants '' . 
  there is no need to provide them with anything ( above perhaps the most basic food initially ) at all according to international agreements ( including eu legislation ) . 
  there is no right to stay after the conflict in the country is over and you no longer count as a refugee . 
  if sweden implemented those rules we would have the same amount of immigrants as poland ( no benefits there etc so no refugees go there ), 
   the government has already used most of the options it reasonably has available at this point in time at a national level . 
  no , they have n't . 
  if sweden changed it laws to say that refugees that have right according to the un treaties can stay here ( excludes anyone who has lived in a un refugee camp ) until the conflicts are over and then they are sent back but they have no right to welfare benefits . 
  then the flow would stop . 
  there is a reason they choose sweden and germany instead of slovenia , slovakia , etc : because there welfare is higher here . 
  there is no war in any other european conflict so if all they want is peace they would go to other countries that are closer . 
   anyway i 'm fairly convinced we 'll see quite a bit lower but still high numbers during 2016 . 
  guess we will see and i guess it depends if the left goverment goes through and actually tries to decrease immigration . 
  guess we will see whether you will be right or not  the biggest change is though that eu politicans ( including swedish ) are now employing the help of the not so democratic leader of turkey and giving him money to make sure no refugees can leave his country . 
  this week . 
  it was a couple of weeks ago . 
  do you think it will be more or less when it gets warm again in the spring ? 
  at least then it was n't really volentary, 
   would be very politically `` brave '' yea , and thats why it wo n't happen . 
  sorry , was 2 years and not 1.5 years . 
  and bear in mind that it is an economist that has earlier agrued for a generaous immigration policy . 
   that 's really not enough reason for a billion euro project . 
  but the bulk of the cost isnt paid by the us . 
  its paid by the eu . 
  of course the us wants to be able to use it too . 
   ban the use of gps and galileo for ` security reasons ' , china ca n't `` ban '' the use of it for the us or eu . 
  they can try to jam it or fake the signals ( which is why you want to have a reserve system like galileo if they jam gps ), 
   prc which country ? 
  they could easily change the laws letting them work . 
  probably . 
  there is a reason they walk all the way from turkey that is secure and they have more in common with . 
  its basic economics . 
  if there is no reward for coming to the north they wo n't come : why leave muslim , warm turkey for the secular cold nordic if you dont benefit economically ? 
  they will have to do it . 
  according to projections the swedish welfare state will collapse ** permanently ** if the current rates of immigration is sustained for 1.5 years more . 
  the swedish priminister recently said after the paris attacks '' ** we ** have been naive '' . 
  of course he is n't going to say that he has been naive but that `` we '' as a people have been . 
  probably if someone destorys/damges/hacks the gps system they can switch to galilio, 
   why treat refugees differently ? 
  eu laws demand that they give fingerprints , and there is nothing wrong with that . 
  because politicans are scared of coming across as `` inhumane '' and rather let people break the law than being acused of being racist . 
   homework right because the illiterate syrian farmers are probably going to do a great job with that haha =p, 
  the law can always be changed . 
  and stop tempting them with promises of welfare etc. 
  if we said : `` sure , come here but you wo n't get any welfare at all so that if you do n't get a job you will starv to death '' there would be a big decrease . 
  do you boycott everything from marocco ? 
  true . 
  it 's simple . 
  just ask : what would either side do if they had the military capacity to exterminate the other side ? 
  israel : they have that capacity already . 
  they could kill every palestinian within days if they wanted . 
  they restrict their use of a violence though . 
  hamas : they have said they would kill every jew in israel and around the world if they could . 
  it 's even in their rules that all jews shall be killed . 
  if they had the capacity to kill all jews they would .
