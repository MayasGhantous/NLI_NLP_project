  a protest forms outside the guys place of residence . 
  protesting what he wrote . 
  police disperses the crowd . 
  how is any of this `` mob justice '' ? 
  the mob forced exactly ** no one ** to do exactly ** nothing ** . 
  to add to that none in the crowd commited any crime , a few said they would want to hurt him but that is n't a crime any more that what he the guy wrote on facebook said . 
  why is it you feel you can presume the crowd commited a crime when they used their rights of free speech and right of association and protest but he in your mind has no reason to be blamed ? 
  please give me some examples of this then . 
  you hear it all the time but there is never a clear instance of it . 
  haha you got me, 
  is n't this a slippery slope fallacy ? 
  could n't the exact same thing be stated about the right of ownership ? 
  `` if we let the government hold the power to forcibly take land from the populace the government could effectively seize all the forms of productions . 
  that togheter with limiting the freedom of movement and the government could very easily reinstate serfdom '' i get arguing for gun ownership to protect against tyranny since its a direct tool to force down governments . 
  i just fail to see how freedom of speech is more essentiall than for example freedom of association . 
  historically restricting the freedom of association have been much more effetive against stopping revolt than have restricting the freedom of speech . 
  should n't then freedom of association be of a higher priority to protect than speech ? 
   when the guy literally was put to mob justice for breaking the political correctness . 
  what ? 
  who was put to mob justice ? 
  if that 's what you got from the article that 's not at all what happened . 
  i can see a lot of words in there that could be questionably translated though so please share the part which say that he was put to `` mob justice '' . 
  anything can go to court . 
  and the prosecutor could have all ranges of reasons for why to go to court . 
  maybe he wanted to set a precedent of what is hate speech , maybe he wanted a precedent of what is n't hate speech , maybe he midjuged the circumstances . 
  * maybe he 's just fucking incomptent * . 
  what i 'm stating here in my comments is litterally what i 've been taugh , do n't try to justify your skewed sense of reality with your preconceptions of my competens . 
  especially when your only argument is a magazine clipping of a case being thrown out . 
  fucks sake man , get a hobby or something . 
  yes , he was cleared of all charges . 
  anything else ? 
  many , most are small things like someone walking around with a swastica on some article of clothing and audibly talking down to jews or something like that . 
  those cases rarely gets media attention as its usually just followed with a fine . 
  there is a somewhat known case of an artist getting jail time ( 5 months ) for commiting `` hets mot folkgrupp '' . 
  you can read * some * about it on wikipedia and in their sources : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dan_park its the only case i personally know of that has lead to a prison sentence . 
  there is probably a few more but it * very * rarely occurs . 
  the issue forms when the majority holds ( and spread ) the opinion that the minoty should n't hold the rights of the majority . 
  effectively suspressing the speech of the minority . 
  hate speech regulations are in place to prevent the majority from doing exactly what mill argued against . 
  well done , you just presented a argument for hate speech regulations . 
  no , in no way would that be considered `` hate speech '' ( in swedish it doesnt actually say `` hate speech ( hat-tal ) but instead it says `` hets mot folkgrupp '' . 
  ( something i fail to properly translate but it holds no correlation to the concept of `` hate '' ) please , just please , read some of my other comments . 
  im pretty tired of all the comments from people that are sure that any criticism against minorities is stricly illegal because they 've formed the picture that sweden is a pc-dictatorship . 
  well i mean beeing stubbornly against compromising somwhat when it comes to free speech can come off as a bit `` brainwashed '' aswell . 
  most rights ( if not every right ) have some sort of restriction and promoting the opposite would be found ridiculous and i simply do n't see what makes free speech more sacred than the right of association , right of protest , right of ownership or right of religion . 
  none of these are absolute in any sense of the word yet everyone is alright with that in america . 
  when proposing that free spech shouldnt be discriminated positively against everyone flips their shit . 
  do n't take this wrong , its fine to think that free speech should be absolute but i find it somewhat ridiculous that the right that * one personally * finds most importent is the one that should be absolute and the argument for it is that `` its a right and therefore its natural that it should be absolute '' . 
  i mean thats the case for every right , yet the state quite often buys of land from private owners without their backing and yet there is no `` shit flipping '' of the right of ownership beeing restricted . 
  i mean a good portion of people in america look with disgust upon the fundamentalist right which always cries out about the restricion of their freedom of religion and that it should be absolute since its a human right . 
  yet the same people whom view the fundamentalists as idiots fail to see the same reasoning being used within their own ranks . 
   i also find it rather strange that this law appears to see hate speech as a variation of treason . 
  it does n't , `` hate speech '' is simply listed in the same kategory as treson since they 're both some of the few limitations of free speech . 
  the list is basically a list of restrictions of free speech . 
  this is also not acutally the `` penal regulation '' . 
  the real regulation can be found in the `` penal code '' and this entry is simply a referment of one of the restrictions of free speech . 
  in the `` penal code '' `` hate speech '' and treason is placed in completely different `` categories '' . 
  ( just to clarify ) about the translation . 
  yes you could absolutely translate the term to `` disrespect '' but the way its used in this context is nowhere close to the implications that the swedish term warrants . 
  i 'd say there is n't any english term that * exactly * correlates with the swedish term . 
  this is probably pretty usual in judiciary comparisons unfortunately . 
  i have explained it somewhat in a comment-chain 3 comment from the top . 
  it would be a rest for my fingers if you read what i wrote there . 
  ofcourse i 'll answer if you have any other questions or need me to clarify . 
  ok , like this . 
  ( sorry for being ranty ) in swedish law , we have something thats called * f\u00f6rarbeten * . 
  this can roughly be translated to `` fore-works '' or `` preparation-works '' . 
  these concists of every commite ruling , every lobbying opinion ( lobbyists do n't have the same power or function as in the eu or us but thats a story for another time ) , every parliamentary dissenting opinion , aswell as the opinion of the `` constitutional comittee ( not really a good translation but cant be bothered about it right now ) . 
  in these you can often find what the lawmaker intended when making the law , as in they might have provided examples , they might have gotten a opinion from a particular source ( comittee or lobbyist group or other ) and subsequently changed the proposed text of the law or intention of making the law . 
  ** all of this is basically to understand the `` sprit of the law '' ** ( as an american would put it ) in an effort to apply it as closely to the will of the people as possibly ( as in the people voted for the parliament that wrote the law and by following the intent of the lawmaker the court is following the intent of the people . 
  this is somewhat a summary of the swedish `` principle of the sovreignity of the people '' , as in the people is the sovreign of the nation . ), 
  i guess the closes comparison to `` f\u00f6rarbetena '' would be the supreme court in the us reading the federalist papers and writing of the forefahters to understand the intent of the constitution . 
  so that is one `` sources of law '' that the courts follow when `` reading '' the law . 
  some others are praxis , judiciary litterature and general principles . 
  all of these weigh in when judging any particular paragraph or requisite . 
  i could list and go over all for you if you wish but it would take a while and i doubt i woould to the facts justice , especielly when i have to present them in a second language . 
  so when all of these are weighed in , the circumstances scrutinized and the individuals intent judged you come up with a pretty defined application of the law . 
  the issue lies in that they `` defined application '' is basically only good for that one case . 
  since two circumstances are never the same you ca n't in generall come up with a perfectly definition of the paragraph ** since every case is different ** and you have to , in every individual case , judge every individual `` source of law '' and weigh them in relation with the situation at hand . 
  ** and this is whitout having a jury system !, 
  ** imagine having all of this aswell as general members of the public trying to apply them to complex judiciary cases . 
  law is n't easy . 
  i simply can not provide you with a clearly defined english term since the implication and application in the swedish sphere is just basically understood and always in flux . 
  this is the way of the law unfortunately , one clear aspect of one case cane never be extrapolated to another . 
  ** and this is the case of all law !!, 
  ** this is in no way just the case for just this regulation , its the case for every regulation . 
  the swedish regulation against assualt ( misshandel ) states that the damage have to be `` varaktig '' . 
  that would strictly translate to `` lasting '' , but unfortunately that does n't tell half of the story . 
  basically `` lasting '' is a much more `` heavy '' ( the best way i can put it ) term than `` varaktig '' . 
  and , as i said , that is just the issue of translating the paragraph , its actual implication in the swedish courts varies from case to case and there is never a set definiton . 
  the actual only thing i could tell you about the requisite of `` varaktig '' would be that `` it would have to be worse than a slap '' . 
  now i could provide you with hundreds of similarly encroaching `` its not this '' statements about the implications of the swedish regulations against hate speech but i would still never be able to precisely define what the paragraph says . 
  tl : dr * just read the last paragraph i wrote , it sums it up somewhat . 
   then why are you talking about hate in your other comment ? 
  because its the only way i could think of to define the * actual * word which is `` missaktning '' . 
  `` missaktning '' could easily be translated to `` disrespect '' but that is n't close to its implication . 
  if you were to place a line with `` disrespect '' on one end and `` hate '' on the other , you would place missaktning much closer to `` hate '' than to `` disrespect '' . 
  * thats * why i used hate , because its a easy tool to explain the implications of the swedish term . 
  it 's all semantics though and an actuall translation ( with all relevant implications ) would be much harder to perform without losing much in the process i 'm sorry to say . 
  we 've had this law since the early bit of the last century .
