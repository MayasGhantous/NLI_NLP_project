   because one wants to enforce regulated asylum versus completely open borders ? 
  look out mister false dichotomy . 
  you realise people are arguing for the entrance of more refugees , ** not open borders ** , right ? 
  good man !, 
  ( or woman ), 
  so they 're distributing themselves ? 
  how does that prove they 'd be against we helping them in that endevour ? 
  how does that in any way prove , or even hint , that they would be against being distributed throughout the union ? 
  if i were a refugee and i heard a country provided carte blanche asylum i would want to get there as fast as possible awell . 
  ** how is that in any way indicative for the notion that the would would n't agree to a process were they were distrubuted throughout the eu as long as they got asylum ?!, 
  ** its like your just throwing stuff at the wall , assuming it will stick . 
  ** the video is on the syrian refugee crisis !!, 
  ** i asked if you could provide conflicting sources to the one used in the video and what you 're now saying is that the facts about syrian refugees in the video is not generally applicable to general immigrants ? 
  well , ** no shit sherlock !, 
  comeon now you 're not even trying !, 
  your source is `` the news within the last few weeks '' ? 
  your source that ** every refugee ** is against collective burdening of humanitarian asylum is ** the news i watched this week ** ?!, 
  well fuck me i just watched a lot of fox this week and all i now know is that hillary is litteraly the devil . 
  huh , did n't know you were allowed to make assumptions like that . 
  well since they 're overrepresented in the unemploymentstatistic aswell that does n't really point the fact now does it ? 
  and secondly the video is talking stricly about syrian ** refugees ** . 
  you 're talking about statistics about immigrants from all corners of the world . 
  you 'll have to present a fact actually showing ** syrian refugees ** being overrepresented in the swedish crime stats before your point is relevant and not totally arbitrary . 
  so i ask for factual inconsitencies in the video and you respond with stats regarding poverty in the eu ? 
  did you really think that through ? 
  because it kinda seem like you 're trying to derail the conversation and make it seem the video is wrong without actually proving it . 
  please , actually show me where the video is ** factually wrong ** , not just `` wrong in your opinion '' . 
  could it be this ? 
  http://www.turkeyagenda.com/crime-rate-among-syrian-refugees-remain-way-lower-than-expected-1199.html had to search for it at the site . 
  sourcing the guardian is like sourcing breibart ? 
  are you for real ? 
  so i guess sourcing die spiegel is like quoting communist daily too ? 
  just because a source has an opinion does n't mean its facts are incorrect . 
  so please , show me the actual ** factual falsities ** instead of just rejecting the facts outright because you do n't agree with the person relaying them . 
  edit : for fucks sake , the economist is one of their sources . 
  i guess they have a leftist agenda aswell ? 
  because its alright to generalise when talking about brown people . 
  how and when ? 
  they 're barely allowed into any country except the border countries , germany and my own . 
  where is this ` collective sharing of refugees initative ' that you say the syrians have outright rejected ? 
  or are you just assuming based on non factual sources ? 
   they make an assumption that the majority of these migrants will get work no they did n't  and they are also leading people to the conclusion that the current refugee influx is only a temporary thing . 
  can you prove that it is n't ? 
  because they have the sources to back up their facts , its right in under the video . 
   and the sources , wikipedia , a bunch of news outlets , the majority of those sources are heavily biased towards mass immigration , if you could actually show me the incorrect facts the sources are presenting that would be great . 
  you ca n't just say : `` oh the sources are ** all biased ** , obviously the video is wrong . '', 
  show me the correct facts then if you find these `` biased '' . 
  if you do n't find any you do n't really have any basis to stand on when you call these sources incorrect . 
  edit : you cant just reject whats being said based just on who is saying it . 
  a fact is a fact even if an idiot is relaying it . 
   somehow he forgot to mention how could there be isis members disguised as ` refugees ' can you show me one credible source , * that is not isis * , that proves this to be the case ? 
  so far this has been only hear say and fear mongering with no substance . 
  yeah , * wonder why * the video did n't mention that . 
  once again the sources is under the video , please show me the incorrect source then we can discuss . 
  the easiest way ( except housing a refugee yourself ) is probably to donate to some organisation . 
  there is a donationlink under the video . 
  ** and make sure to vote !, 
  ** populists always get higher voter turnout because , well , theyre populists . 
  next election make sure to show were you stand as a humanitarian . 
  damn , i was just gon na post it . 
  the video actually posts its sources in the bar below so if you could point out the source that 's incorrect in its assesment i 'd be grateful . 
  kurzgesagt are usually on their game , do n't see a reason they should be wrong on this . 
  but if you can , please point out the factual inconsitensies you see in their sources . 
  and you 're accusing anyone not agreeing with you for being `` leftists '' . 
  ad hominem is flying everywhere , do n't pretend your camp is innocent . 
  yes because individual cases is totally indicative to a greater trend . 
  i 'm a leftist , i know dozens of leftists and none of them would argue for asylum for someone that commits a crime like that . 
  keep it up with the straw men why dont you . 
   victims in denmark have no right ... to speak at criminal proceedings what kind of mob justice procedings are you looking for ? 
  justice without emotion is * the * fundamental ideal of a modern , judiciary state . 
  so essentially the parliament have to change the constitution before passing a law that goes against it ? 
  atleast if they want it to actually function ? 
  well 10 of the american times occurred simultaneously so i find it a bit disingenuous to count them separately . 
  do it 17 times vs 5 times with the same calculations and youll find that the difference is a lot closer . 
  also do n't forget that finland basically had a functional constitution to mirror before it 's independence whilst america had to make it from scratch which undoubtedly creates greater need for changes . 
  honestly i feel like the best comparison would be a comparison of the last 50 years or so . 
  that would more accurately judge each nations willingness to change the constitution in modern society . 
  i can only speak for sweden but the finnish system is pretty similar so it might bear some fruit . 
  over here courts ca n't rule laws unconstitutional but if they find that different laws goes against each other they can choose to not execute the law `` with the lower standing '' . 
  there 's different doctrines on this but with constitutions the relevant one would be `` lex superior '' which basically means the constitution would always win out . 
  so tl : dr : if the parliament were to pass a law which would go against the constitution the courts would most likely choose not to `` use '' that law . 
  it would still be in the book , just not in effect . 
  does finlands system have any same or similar room for flexibility in place ? 
  finland had been independent a much shorter time aswell . 
  thats not really the point, 
  good example, 
  yeah , its not like your total lack of trying to propose counter arguments is indicative of something else . 
   and you 're just babbling nonsense to try to feel better . 
  maybe i 'm too brainwashed ? 
  you never know with those barin washers , just 30 seconds to long on `` medium rare '' and all of a sudden you 're all coo-coo . 
  i should propably ask the leftist media to service them a bit . 
  absolutely , i never claimed otherwize . 
  i reacted to the notion that just because we have a change of heart we have an inherent right to change every treaty to totaly conform to our current opinion . 
  it would make for a rather fickle dimplomatic situation . 
  aaaaaand here 's another perfectly good example of trying to dehumanize people that do n't come to the same conclusion as you . 
  great man , thanks !, 
  i 'm thinking about taking it as a compliment since what i wrote garnered enough irritation from you to motivate you to respond but obviously you could n't think of even one competent counter-argument so i guess i won this one . 
  carry on . 
  which is n't anything i 've ever said anything about . 
  the funny thing is i 'm not even an atheist but were only making an absurd example .
