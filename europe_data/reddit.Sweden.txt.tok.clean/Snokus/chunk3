  awfully stereotypical of you as a redditor to use that particular ad hominen though . 
  and you * do * realise that you started by calling me brainwashed ? 
  how do you expect people to respond to that treatment ? 
   `` i am right and if you do n't agree you 're brainwashed ! '', 
  does n't seem like a great start to a possibly constructive discussion , does it ? 
  i 'm not saying that those incidences are indicative of anything . 
  i 'm saying they present a view of germany as more hostile than sweden . 
  wheter its true or not is besides the point . 
  same with the rape , the view the occurence presents is in no way indicative of a wider picture . 
  hahah what ? 
  when in recent times have it been common practice to just adhere to treaties when you feel like it ? 
  i mean it , source that statement . 
  actually non-adherence to treaties have been the starting points of some of the most tense diplomatic crisises in recent time . 
  wish i could say the same , unfortunately i dont really like being called brainwashed just because i dont agree with ones argument . 
  good luck with the ad hominem in the future . 
  still not relevant to the topic at hand nor something i 've posted . 
  you ca n't counter `` sweden is more welcoming '' with `` sweden is afraid of right wing policies '' . 
  its not even part of the same discussion . 
  what ? 
  distorting reality ? 
  have i missed something or are the news just taking pictures at children ? 
  they 're not lying about the existence of the children since they are , in fact , there . 
  nor are they trying to hide the fact males are there to . 
  so the only thing they 're doing is photoing children , women ** and ** men . 
  they 've choosing to put an empaphis on the children but that is hardly suprising in a crisis . 
  and you 're calling it ** brainwashing ** ?!, 
  its like someone dropped you on your head and out fell your sense of proportionality . 
  next you 're going to tell me that me being atheist is infringing on your religious rights . 
  oh for fucks sake , its no more propagande than a reporter zooming in on fish to counter the popular opinion that there are barely any , if any at all , fish left in the mediteranian . 
  atleast have some perspective . 
  great work , i 've never seen such an effective derailing before . 
  how cool of you to keep to the relevant discussion . 
  `` racists are throwing molotovs ! '', 
  `` well so what , the media is biased any way . '', 
  its like you 're aiming to becoming stereotypes . 
  maybe they 're doing it because people like you claim there barely are any children or women . 
  maybe they 're trying to point out that actually vhildren and women are benifiting aswell , not just males . 
   if eu changed its opinion , it could also change the treaties . 
  that would make for a great precedence . 
  `` europe '' , `` the place that only honors its treaties when they feel like it '' . 
  should do wonders for our foreign policies . 
  well we have n't thrown molotovs at refugee homes yet . 
  nor have we held big rallies outside refugee centers shouting at them that they are sub-human . 
  do n't worry though , its probably coming . 
  the far right rarely lets an oppurtunity slip by . 
  oh come on , in all of the general pictures of the crowd you can see plenty of chuldren and women . 
  is it really so impossible to see the reasoning why traveling across war ravaged lands and half a continent is dangerous bussines for children and by extenstion one parent ( often the mother i 'd wager ) stays put with the children to care for them ? 
  you realise there are degrees of danger ? 
  is more than possible that an extended family traveling together makes for a much more dangerous situation than staying put , eventhough staying also provides a constant danger . 
  one person traveling alone makes the journey both swifter and more flexible . 
  you really have to shut your mind to not see that as a possible rationale . 
  oh for fucks sake read up on your history . 
  one of the primary reasons for the shitfest that is the middle east right now is the british ambition to control the suez canal bye playing different muslim states and isreal against each other , they later on got support from france . 
  another prime reason is that the us wanted a firm hold on the region as a buffer to the soviets , which they achieced by allying primarily the saudis while at the same time toppling any government looking anything like a socialist reformer . 
  read all about it , its documented history now : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suez_crisis the middle east with irak and egypt as de facto region leaders was doing pretty well immideately after the second world war but the super powers on the rise and the colonial powers on the decline majorly fucked up the region since none of the held any firm influence there . 
  the reason that states like syria , egypt , saudi arabia and iraq all have or untill recently had dictators or monarchs was literaly because the three states of france , uk and usa supported these forms of governments because they did n't favour socialist or anti-colonialist movements , while at the same time they ** literally ** toppled governments that managed to reform into democracy simply because their ambitions was often both anti-colonial and socialist to some degree . 
  sure many factors is always at play but the responsibility for the middle easts fall into religios fundamentalism lies firmly on the shoulders of the uk and the us . 
  which would n't be representative of the people since an even smaller amount of the populace would hold the majority power . 
  s\u00e5 sant, 
  japp , men \u00e4ven seasonal depressive disorder . 
  well the first action they took in their feminist foreign policy was to denounce saudi arabias treatment of women . 
  and our government were hailed for it , so so far its done pretty alright . 
  god i hate mindless patriotism . 
   the classic reddit armchair fallacy . 
  my * favorite * fallacy, 
  well atleast source that poll then . 
  if you 're thinking of sd being the biggest party then keep in mind that they 're not even close to a third of the popular support . 
  '' * delusional * '' so because i do n't agree with you i must be delusional . 
  i live next to one of the biggest mosques in sweden an i really am serious when i say the only issues i 've had with it is nazis vandalising it , its members have never bothered me . 
  i mean , the biggest issues we 've had is nazis burning down and or vandalizing mosques . 
  i mean sure you could dislike the amount we take in but the country is n't about to collapse on itself and the biggest problem seem to be that the damn trains never seem to be able to make it on time . 
  honestly i have no real issues with it other than i 'd like us to be more active with eu wide immigration policy . 
  i think i might love you, 
  you sure ? 
  i 'm not saying people are against it across the board but that a good portion hold the opinion that abortions should only be made when result of rape or of healt reasons . 
  i mean you have republicans whom hold the view that abortions after rapes are wrong even then and even some that say that `` legitimate rape '' ( whatever that is ) prevents the woman from getting pregnant . 
  when the rightist party openly support these extreme opinions is it really that far of a leap to say that the center is at least moderately conservative on their view on abortion ? 
  is n't the current abortion policy in ireland just a remnant of a catholic legacy ? 
  i mean they just recently got rid of blasphemy laws and latest i checked the popular opinion widely supported liberalisation of the abortion policy so a law change could be due any day now . 
  the laws in place means nothing when gauging popular opinion and while not knowing the particular parties exact stances im fairly sure that keeping abortion policy as is in ireland does n't hold moderate support but is rather a pretty right wing opinion . 
  well i meant abortion but my phone must have changed it . 
  does n't really matter tought as this fits just aswell . 
  they do n't like that homosexual couples adopt . 
  opposing adoption is not a centre policy by any western standard outside of the us . 
  no they are n't * allowed * in . 
  if we illegally penetrated their borders we would be no better than the smugglers . 
  i know , i know , godwins law but come on , there exist a pretty blaring example of populist regimes gone wrong . 
  ( hitler and the nazi regime for those who do n't get it ), 
  i 'm pretty sure no one is opposed to cracking down on traffickers . 
  chill it with the strawmen would you . 
  definition of sentient :  being able to perceive or feel things . 
  honestly it 's pretty common opinion that plants are sentient since they react to stimuli . 
   semi-sentient creatures . 
  all animal life is sentient , i think you meant semi-self aware . 
  or something along that line . 
  i 'm pretty sure people have been saying this since the origin of democracy . 
  more likely politicians with principles are only noticed when their principles all of a sudden goes against the populist opinions . 
  for someone to be steadfast some others have to first become reactionaries . 
  are you quoting kissinger to provide an argument ? 
  that 's like quoting nixon when discussing ethics .
