  im not arguing that . 
  i never argued that . 
  all i 'm saying is that free speech in america is n't absolute . 
  a point you seem to have conceded by now . 
   you 're being prosecuted for the panic you caused , not for your speech . 
  with this reasoning there is nothing that stops you from making hate speech illegal . 
  you simply place the sanction the the incitement of hate , rather than the speech itself . 
  great !, 
  now you can still say whatever the hell you want and just get punished because you used your speech to incite hatred . 
  cool little loophole you 've found !, 
  its still a limit of free speech . 
  absolute has one meaning . 
  namely * absolute * . 
  its definition is exactly that , `` without limits '' . 
  i do agree with the fact that you shouldnt be able to use speech to cause a panic . 
  it might be a reasonable limit , but its still a limit . 
  if some ways or some reasons for speaking is placed under sanction , then speech is limited . 
  then , by definition , its not abolute . 
  claiming that your limits doesnt exist and your freedom is infact avsolute is just a trick so you can criticise others limits thats a bit stricter with the argument : `` your freedom should be absolute , like ours '' . 
  this is exactly what i 'm talking about . 
  i ** in no way ** defend , sympathise or rationalise their behaviour . 
  all i 'm saying is that it was inevitable that a group like this would form in the aftermath of everything that has happened in the middle east . 
  there is a reason why power vacuums is seen as something you really want to aviod . 
  especially in such a poor region as the middle east since that provides an excelent breeding ground for fundamentalists that can easily fill that vacuum . 
  to draw a parallel to ira ( the terrorist organisation ) : it was inevitable that with of the british were treating the irish a `` resistance '' would form . 
  i 'm simply pointing out the materialistic situation that lead to the current development . 
  what im not doing is saying that because the british treated the irish badly that means the ira gets a pass when they bomb a populated pub . 
  now your just arguing my own point . 
  rights and freedoms cant be absolute since that would be absurd . 
  immideate harm is one instance which argues exactly that point . 
  i mean , i 've argued that the establishment of organisations like isis was inescapeable as a result of the total decimation of the middle east and how the people there see themselves as unfairly treated by ( among others ) the western world . 
  people i 've proposed this argument to have sometimes taken it as i 'm somehow defending isis for their actions . 
  its not impossible that simmilar instances happen pretty regularly . 
  does n't matter . 
  its still a limit on freedom of speech . 
  ergo : the freedom isnt absolute . 
  considering that , i actually think he is doing alright . 
  could be ** a lot ** worse, 
  except out pm was literaly a welder . 
  i guess that does n't fit in to your worldview though , does it ? 
   no , but calling yourself left-wing usually does . 
  you realise this is just one of the media outlets in sweden right ? 
  here you go , actuall media categorised by ideology . 
  you can easily see that right wing ideas far outnumber left win : https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/lista_%c3%b6ver_svenska_tidningar_ordnade_efter_ideologi, 
   the public does not deserve to witch-hunt people with different opinions and get them fired or worse . 
  no one has lost their job `` or worse '' as a result of this . 
  i do n't know what youre banging on about . 
   every person has a right to keep his opinion to himself and to not disclose to anyone whom he votes for or what he thinks . 
  that you think that the mob `` has a right '' to witch-hunt is deeply worrying and telling of the current debate climate in sweden . 
  the fact is that while government involvement in witch-hunts certainly make them worse , it does not change the basic consequences for those targeted , which is ostracization and losing their jobs . 
  a witchhunt is characterised because of the uncertainty that the targets ar actually guilty . 
  in this case its clear that the exposed individuals have spread a lot of racism on the interwebs . 
  you 're gon na have to find another buzzword than witchhunt . 
   do you honestly think that is okay ? 
  are doctors not allowed to have personal opinions ? 
  you do n't find it worrying that doctors that are supposed to treat everyones health no matter the look of their skin hold the opinion that some people does n't deserve to live ? 
  i would think that worry would take priority over the doctors privacy . 
   even the press ombudsman , the person that is supposed to defend consumer rights in the media , is pushing the same agenda and warning swedish citizens that freedom of speech `` should not be taken for granted '' . 
  the pressombudsman is n't an official position its a private organisation . 
  why the hell are you blaming all of sweden because a private organisation does n't comform to your perspective ? 
   swedish media is a clique of left-wing journalists that ruthlessly attack opinions and people critical of official state policy on immigration . 
  you can spout this all you wish , the facts are that the majoruty of swedish media is owned by organisations with clear right wing biases . 
  no , not right wing as in absolutely against immigration but right wing as in neo-liberal and/or conservative . 
  opposing the rethoric of the anti-immigration/racist/sd-group does n't automatically define you as left wing . 
  its ridiculous how you manage to create this false dichotomy in which everyone that does n't hate immigration just as much as you do are obviously a bleeding heart left winger which are undoubtedly out to get you . 
  there are immigration debates every day in sweden and yet the only violence perturbing to this issue is the anti-immigration folk setting fire to asylum-homes and mosques . 
  i have yet to see any evidence of this left wing prosecution / r/europe is so sure exists . 
   so you would support if the same is done with communists or left-wing radicals ? 
  if they sit in government , work in a head department or serve a critical socieital function while claiming not to be any of this then absolutely . 
   house un-american activities committee and mccarthyism was a great idea . 
  i actually found that abborhent but thats because they tried to 1 . unconstitutionally fire public officials and private workers because of their political affiliations , and 2 . 
  tried to pin political affiliations on individuals who did n't have those political affiliations . 
  none of these things is even close to having the media scrutinize public officials for hlding racist opinions in spite of their public appearence . 
  also keep in mind that the red scare was abbhorent because its was litterally governmentally sanctioned witchhunting . 
  this instance we 're talking about was neither governmentally sanctioned nor a witchhunt . 
  the people beeing publicised as racist is evidently racists even though they belong to parties and orgnaisations claiming to opposing racism . 
  the public very much deserve to know which officials and politicians that hold extreme opinions that contradict their public persona and i find it worrying that you can compare private media scrutiny to a governmental withchunt . 
  first of all they exposed people of all parties . 
  i remember a particular green mp that got exposed . 
  secondly they did n't expose people that was anti-immigration . 
  they exposed people that were actively rasist ** and ** in important positions . 
  there was the sd mp that had written in forums that child refugees would just die . 
  and the eu-lawyer that spouted a bunch of rasist bullshit . 
  i have no problem with the media exposing our elected and non elected officials non-public opinions . 
  especially when it 's racist opinions ( no being anti-immigration is not racist ) . 
  it 's kinda what the media is supposed to do , scrutinize the establishment . 
  illegal as in they do n't pay taxes . 
  not if you work illegaly . 
  its pretty common for poles to work `` black '' ( illegaly ) in sweden . 
  i 'm pretty sure there is some muslims simply consulting non muslims to just visit the mosque some times . 
  and i 'm sure that there are christians going around in nigeria that murden any non christian they see . 
  how is this whatabaoutism ? 
  i simply said that is the koran should be prosecuted for what it says then so should the bible . 
  and the torah too . 
  the word `` f\u00e5 '' can both translated to `` get '' or `` few '' depending of the context and in a complex situation as a court of law an accurate translation would be even harder ro give . 
  yes , stricly speaking , it can be translated to `` disrespekt '' . 
  the thing is that we already have a word that ** exactly ** corresponds to `` disrespect '' . 
  the term is '' ** respektl\u00f6shet ** '' . 
  subsequently the term `` missaktning '' does n't really hold a corresponding english term and `` disrespect '' is simply the closes one to it . 
  the real issue lies in that while `` disrespect '' might work for everyday use , in the context of law it expresses a completely different regulation than what it is in swedish .
