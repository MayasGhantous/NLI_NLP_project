yes . 
  because one car bomb that kills eight people = to that of 578 car bombs between 2003-2006 , in iraq *** alone *** . 
  do n't try to tell me that car bombs are more of a fad for radical right-wingers than muslims the past sixteen years . 
  and did i claim no car bombs have been used by far-right extremists ? 
  do proceed and quote me were i wrote that or admit you just tried to make one of the worst straw men . 
  that was 16 years ago . 
  that fad has been much more popular with another group for more than sixteen years . 
  and i reepeat . 
  you only need to cover a small area on the south side of norway to stop the water way imigration . 
  lol . 
  waiting 4 hours every once in a few whiles  less safety against criminals and illegal immigrants . 
  to get into norway illegally you have to take a boat . 
  compare the area which is a realistic option to cross to with a boat ( veeeeery smal ) to the rest . 
  the giant border to sweden and finland does n't have to be guarded as much as the south `` border '' since both sweden and finland now has border controlls towards the rest of europe already . 
  yeah . 
  there 's a smal chance that a white or red burned person is sitting in a car . 
  migrating from the middle east to european countries compared to that of darker coloured persons . 
  especially being drove by white person when exactly that scenario has played out as people trying to smuggle illegal migrants into european countries . 
  not just once , but loads of times . 
  you sure ? 
  could have sworn it was sweden . 
  i still remember the horrible 9/11 3d rendering they showed on swedish public tv news . 
  really sticks with ya . 
  and god , those damn * sexy * finish voices !, 
  bruh . 
  you 're making me look bad . 
  me and my father too . 
  difference is that he loves ships , water , darkness and the horror that comes with it . 
  in his job he gets to dive from time to time . 
  he told me one of the creepiest was standing on the little piece sticking out bellow the giant proppelers on one of these cruise ships in pitch black seeing nothing bellow him or to the sides . 
  just him , a little nub of steel and a giant , black , proppeller . 
  if you want to , check out some gameplay videos of the `` silent hunter '' games . 
  ww2 submarine games . 
  and the sinking ships is * the * worst . 
  complete with people , debrise and the sickening sounds of metal getting torn and a giant ship just dissapearing into pitch black water . 
  or the beginning of `` the life of pi '' movie . 
  were he swims out of a sinking oil tanker . 
  turns around , and the light shuts off . 
   clinging to a pillar , two tables from the port doors , she begged him to leave her and continue by himself . 
  she told him that she did n't have any more strength . 
  he shouted at her in vain to continue . 
  at this time , water was coming in from the outside to where they had been sitting earlier , and pictures on the wall appeared to be hanging at a 45-degree angle . 
  there 's not a single person above the age of 20 in scandinavia ( finland and estonia too ) that does n't remember this . 
  whut ? 
  sweden has 10 million citizens and a major housing crisis . 
  yet we have much trees . 
  do you know of any sawmills that are abandoned or up for sale ? 
  yes please . 
   this is utterly false here 's a piece of what you said . 
  you *** never *** said `` that was n't the whole story '' . 
   this is utterly false and absolutely ridiculous . 
  i ca n't believe this actually even seems reasonable to you . 
  n no one ever stated this . 
  quote whoever said that in this comment chain or admit you 're fighting a straw man . 
   no you did n't . 
  you might not want to participate in something you know nothing about . 
  i did though . 
  you said that him raping her by removing/destroying his condom was false . 
   this is utterly false and absolutely ridiculous . 
  i ca n't believe this actually even seems reasonable to you . 
  n do you not remember what you wrote ? 
  i gave you an example on why you were wrong . 
  then you backed me up with even more examples . 
  you just proved your other comment wrong . 
   this is utterly false and absolutely ridiculous . 
  i ca n't believe this actually even seems reasonable to you . 
  it 's not false . 
  that 's why he 's suspected of rape in sweden . 
  he told the girl he was having sexual relations with that he was wearing a condom . 
  only to remove it without notifying her or even asking her when she clearly stated that she wanted him to wear a condom . 
  that is , as it should be , a definition of rape . 
  that 's the ammount sweden took in last year . 
  such an edgy owner . 
  should black and gay people also be banned from eating there ? 
  except the germans * did * invent auswitch and they * did * own it . 
  oh yeah lots of it . 
  if any , that was just good since it showed a more human , imperfect side of them . 
  a more * reletable * side to the family . 
  yes ? 
   dating stripers , etc. 
  you should watch a documentary or video report on the swedish antifa/afa . 
  they 're heavily criminal and literally thugs . 
  they 've been branded terrorist many times . 
  no absolutley , i just forgot the `` innocent '' part before mother and daughter . 
  they had nothing to dow ith nazism . 
  just like the migrant worker . 
  yup . 
  they even filmed the whole ordeal for one of his fucking music videos . 
  a disgusting little shit that ca n't return to finland because he knows they want nothing off him . 
  because they are facist . 
  that 's literally why they are so disliked and mocked . 
  they are fachists claiming to be anti fachist . 
  difference is that they 're more communist than `` nationalist '' socialist ( even though they say shit like `` our fathers built this country with their hands , we shall have it '' and so on ) . 
  indeed he is . 
  he should be put to jail for this . 
  we actually have a rapidly growing party here called `` direct democrats '' which has an agenda to push voting into electronics . 
  something to vote about ? 
  shows up in cellphone or whatever . 
  cool concept . 
  but yes .
