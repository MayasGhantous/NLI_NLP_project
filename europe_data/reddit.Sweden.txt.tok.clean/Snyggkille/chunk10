  he told how when he hesitated and gave the knife away the head rebel omar was disturbed by his lack of faith and took away his grenade launcher , aka his retirement fund . 
  after around one month in prision , tamerlane hasaeva ` died ' . 
  ( no surprises there ) also captured was 35-year-old arby dandan , who , according to the russian courts , personally cut the throat of the senior lieutenant vasily taskin . 
  he was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment in a special regime , and in this photo he looks pretty happy for a guy about to meet a prison full of russian criminals who would enjoy cutting his head off , probably with food as the main motivator in mind . 
   the russian troops killed in this video are all seen as national heroes with schools and monuments named after them , the video only made russians more aware and angry at the chechens and putin vowed to kill them , as he would barehanded anyway if he had the chance . 
  the guy wrestles bears for fucks sake . '', 
  yes , indeed it is . 
  and you need to realize that . 
  if you think right wingers in europe is a problem , then it 'll just be easier for you to move . 
  conservatism has always existed in europe and always will . 
  and now it 's on the fast uprise again . 
  lol , speak for yourself . 
  i 'm thinking about moving to the u.s.a. 
  yeah , students leave their homes when it 's pitch black outside , and then leave school when it 's pitch black . 
  the moon sucks cock . 
  exactly , but this picture has too much hdr . 
  wtf is up with aussies opening up resturant shacks and pubs in the nordic ? 
  that house is really beautiful even without the plant . 
  it 's funny how you do n't want him to compare the eu to nk and directly after trying to bribe him quiet . 
  *** snap ***, 
  yeah you 're very uneducated with assumptions like those . 
  i 'm a virginia . 
  seriously , the leaders of france should get their head out of their asses . 
  post that to / r/computerwargames, 
  no it 's not . 
  you do n't understand the meaning of proxy war . 
  because the nordics have a long history of sending volunteers to warzones . 
  we took in huge ammounts of german merceneris during the napolianic wars and during ww2 we were seeing loads of people joing the ss . 
  so as dumb as it is , we did n't outlaw it due to the principle . 
  and the blue eyed swedes that would raise chaos if it was forbidden due to muslims etc. 
  but iirc it became illegal this year . 
  but the french foreign legion is a-okay still . 
  ** e ** ; heck , we even have swedes in ukraine . 
  because they did n't assault him because they were neo-nazis . 
  it 'd be like protesting against alcohol because two guys who drank alcohol last week assaulted a third guy who also drank alcohol a week before . 
  racism had nothing to do with the assault so saying the protest is because of neo nazis racism leading to a death is pointless since it does n't have a connection with racism . 
   if it was n't for the rally there 'd be no assault . 
  you 're really grasping at straws now mate . 
  the man was n't assaulted due to race , the end . 
  did i say that ? 
  i did n't know i said that , how great is it that you know what i said that i did n't know i said ? ` maybe you could help me and quote me were i said that ? 
  because if he was a white finnish national . 
  i suspect race might not have played a role in the assualt . 
  wait , was n't the assualt victim white ? 
   prison officer with someone who unlawfully imprisons innocent people in their basement ? 
  a prison officer does n't go around executing racist thugs . 
  then what will be the difference between you and them ? 
  eh , what ? 
  very true . 
  i was surprised the titel was n't just  italian police cook elderly couple, 
  so were 's the diplomat fucked up section ? 
  did n't find it . 
  a diplomat can do his job and still have his country go to war . 
  the diplomat can not control the invading country 's will to invade . 
  example ; if russia decides to invade ukraine , then russia will invade ukraine . 
  and that is not the fault of a ukrainian diplomat since there was nothing he could do to change that outcome . 
  yeah . 
  sweden is , against expectations , quite culturally militarized in the sense of families due to the conscription that ended in 2010 after nearly a hundred years . 
  well , it is modernization in the meaning that politicans all over europe used that argument which resulted in a bigger budget for other things while effectivley screwing over thousands of people and ... even if they said a volunteer army would be more professional and effective turned out to be very ineffective . 
  you still have 166000 post cold war era ?? 
  shiet , i envy you . 
  sweden has around 22000 . 
  during the cold war we had 600 000 . 
  no it does n't you know nothing about the matter of how war is waged or even started . 
  a country invading you is a result of your country 's big banks and business ? 
  there is no way this is actually true . 
  no way in hell that even half of sweden trusts the police anymore . 
  then do n't hint at me claiming i said that . 
  european anarchists does n't even know what anarchism actually is . 
  did i claim that ? 
  health reasons ? 
  there 's not a single documented instance of death or cancer directly caused by snus since the dawn of its existence . 
  yet , the eu does n't put a ban on cigarettes , alcohol and coffee in the eu . 
  oh , and they tried stop our coffee bean roasters in sweden . 
   i do n't speak swedish so that is n't much use to me , i do n't give a crap . 
  they 're sources . 
  you have received them . 
   though i 'm not sure i 'll trust you not to be biased . 
  all of those sources varies heavily both for and against the eu . 
  the majority of them are actually pro eu . 
  so do n't even try to ball that idea at me . 
  i 'm actually thinking about . 
  although the cost of living is lower here than there unfortunatley . 
  so i 'm not decided yet . 
   how ? 
  the eu 's motto is `` united in diversity '' that does n't mean a singel shit . 
  the democratic people 's republic of korea is n't democratic . 
   it still has over 20 official languages   still gee , twenty languages , again , that does n't mean jack shit . 
  a culture is n't only language . 
   despite how impractical that is and what does politicians like to do ? 
  make things effective for themselves , no matter the cost . 
  https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/24/europa-english-official-language-eu  they 've already tried and keeps trying to remove swedish food culture   how ? 
  http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/hot-mot-julmusten-efter-eu-direktiv/ http://www.aftonbladet.se/halsa/article12102658.ab  tobacco culture   how ? 
  http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/eu-vill-forbjuda-snuset/ due to the eu we ca n't sell snus outside sweden in europe , which means that the snus culture in norway , denmark and finland ( which is huge ) takes serious damage and slow evolving in the population . 
  the snus culture is hard to get into due to this . 
   weapon culture   how ? 
  &  hunting culture   how ?

  that 's a matter of economics and politics and like all of your examples a policy swedish politicians are perfectly capable of adopting and enacting . 
  frankly , i think you 're equating your own political beliefs with `` swedish culture '' .
