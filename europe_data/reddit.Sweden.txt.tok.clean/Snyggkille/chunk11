  agriculture , farming , farmers , farms , family run farms , local farms , animal care and respect ... ** is ** . 
  ** culture ** . 
  sweden having local farmers in a majority is because of culture . 
  there 's a reason we have the `` st\u00f6d svenskt lokal producerat '' motto . 
  and that 's due to economy and culture . 
  get your head out of your ass dude . 
  keyword is  trending on 9gag, 
  that 's a load of bullshit . 
  cultures can die out due to supression of it and a decline in the cultures population . 
  same culture almost went extinct in sweden due to the government and kings supressing it . 
  that does n't meant that people did n't want the culture to live on . 
  national identity is for the corrupt leaders of nations and the eu to choose . 
  lol . 
  as if it was that simple . 
  the fact that you think a country can have too much national identity proofs that the eu harms that picture . 
  the eu activley tries to push down culture and national identity . 
  they 've already tried and keeps trying to remove swedish food culture , tobacco culture , weapon culture , hunting culture , growth culture ( one example is the fact that they have limits of how much potato a farmer can sell or even give away , and that swedish local family farmers are closing down due to not reviecing aid while french corporate farms gets nearly 26 % of the eu agricultural aid ) . 
  the eu sucks . 
  wow , possible one of the worst attempts at a joke i 've ever seen . 
  that 's what happens when the justice system does n't work in europe . 
  people turn agressive . 
  correction ; why it *** was *** a bad idea . 
  the fact that there are problems now due to the removals and worsened by the removals makes it a bad idea . 
  that 's not debatable . 
   i 'm just explaining why they where torn up . 
  did any one ask for that input ? 
  i never even talked about why the railroads were torn up . 
  get over yourself man . 
  do you want me to go to your home and tell you through speech ? 
   most of those old rails go to villages that would never support the cost of a modern railroad . 
  * keyword * ; *** most *** not *** all *** . 
  i 'm not . 
  i 'm telling this railroad engineer *** why *** the removal of railroads was a bad idea and why new ones should be put up . 
  do you have a problem with me telling him that ? 
  wrong conversation dude . 
  we 're talking about sweden here . 
  it 's only in the three largest cities here that the busses come regularly . 
  outside of them the busses come once every hour . 
  in *** 50 % *** of sweden , the busses only come a very few times a day . 
  some cities does n't even get busses every day and owning a car here in sweden , let alone driving it or even buying it costs a damn fortune . 
  i 'm not trying to change history . 
  i 'm arguing for why i want more railways . 
  and why taking them away was a bad misstake . 
  do you need me to translate it into swedish for you to understand ? 
  s  eventually , cars , lorries are expensive to drive over long distances and taxes for gas is always strived for by politicans to raise . 
  a car and lorrie is also expensive to buy and cost insurances and will need repairing and maintinance . 
  it 's also more dangerous to drive or be driven by one rather than be in a train . 
  a train is also better for the enviroment . 
   busses became more available busses takes to long and just kilometers outside swedens largest cities they will rarely come once an hour . 
  ** e ** ; inb4 , people getting salty because i explaine why the removal of railroads was dumb . 
  i 'm not arguing against why the railroads was removed but the consequences of doing so and why new ones should be put up . 
  learn to read . 
  because a lot of people would need those railroads . 
  give the people what they need , not what they think they want . 
  i could have used a fuck load of those railroads instead of driving a damn car . 
  many people in one train is better for the enviroment than many people distributed into a car each . 
  oh that just pisses me off . 
  as is tradition hahaha . 
  erdogan knows that a actual coup will be performed and to minimize the power of it or trust for the military when it happens , he removed the soldiers , now any members of `` the deep state '' ( judges etc ) and set this act in motion to try and weed out the weak ones . 
  there 's a reason why all generals ( including the secular and anti erdogan ) condemned this coup . 
  i think it 's because they knew erdogan would try this to get a reason to weed them out . 
   either erdogan literally had an `` enemies '' list just lying around oh definitely , he 's not incompetent . 
  personally i believe he sat it all in motion since the foot soldiers claims they were told they were on a `` exercise '' and that the top dogs did n't support it as soon as they heard what was happening . 
  i think the top dogs knew that it would happen and what was happening so they stayed low since all other coupes has been lead by the generals themselves and that includes a coupe all over turkey . 
  not just in two cities . 
  sweden was by no means a `` rich '' country before the 90 's and saying that conscripts have it better by having a `` rich '' country is utterly false . 
  conscripts made barley a handfull of coins for a years service and had very limited privleges that came with the job . 
  more countries were cosncription was and is sucessfull in such a mannor ; finland , norway , russia , germany ( although , `` rich '' ) , switzerland , heck . 
  even * turkey * . 
   those few who do n't want to are still forced to do it against their will no they 're not . 
  in sweden during the hundred years of conscription , barely 9000 people went against and said no when they were conscripted , they were released . 
   and , if most conscripts were `` in on it themselves '' , you would n't need conscription , people would be volunteering . 
  that 's not how or why it works . 
  conscription is put in place to give the young men a small `` put '' into the military life . 
  a life they are willing to live for a year but would n't be actively seek there unless they actually had to . 
  in other words , they need encouragement to actually do something they would be okay with since it 's so different from day to day life . 
  yes it makes sense . 
  it was staged and the top dogs of the military knew that , that 's why they did n't support the coup . 
  it was staged so that erdogan would have a reason to purge the country organs from publicly know anti erdogans, 
   the u.s. military is not . 
  ehhhhh ... 
  look up the turkish term `` deep state '' . 
  it is said that the top officials ( not politicians ) are very secular and live by the ideology of attaturk . 
  in other words , these judges , generals , soldiers , state officials are all anti erdogan . 
  and they have a lot of power . 
  erdogan most likely staged this coup to have a reason to clean them out . 
   government they voted into power , for example lol , you think putin was democratically elected too ? 
   no one elected the soldiers to take power by your logic , they did . 
  they voted for the first president of turkey do put the military in such position and give them the standing order to coup every government that goes to far away from democracy and secularism . 
  except they 've done it more than five times before . 
  because it 's needed and almost all conscripts are in on it themselves . 
  i 've been a conscript myself and study military politics and get paid to do so , so i know . 
  conscription is not an awful thing . 
  using conscripts for the wrong purpose is . 
  almost all of turkeys military is strongly against what erdogan stands for . 
   elected governments lol you think putin , hitler and stalin was elected too ? 
  wo n't happen . 
  eu is 100 % assisting greece with military since greece is a part of the eu battle groups . 
  there 's laws that says all eu members have to help . 
  greece is a member of nato and a memeber of the european battle groups .
