  because nato has far more influence over countries than the eu . 
  you 're lying . 
  that 's called a `` conservative socialist '' here in sweden . 
  yeah that 's the most likely in my opinion . 
  people act is this is the end of the world . 
  it 's just the end of the european union . 
  oh you 're one of those people . 
  yeah whatever . 
  hitler this hitler that . 
  the difference between you , and me . 
  is that i wish these people , no matter if they voted stay or leave , the best of luck . 
  you 're a terrible human being for wishing bad upon people simply because they do n't want to cater to the demands of countries that means absolutely fuck all to them and your political views . 
  and as far as i can tell . 
  you 're pissed of that something did n't go the way you liked it . 
  that is democracy . 
  you *** have *** to respect it . 
  no matter how hitler you think democracy is . 
  lol . 
  conflicts in both ireland will occur before that happens . 
  those people are celebrating because they want independence for * their * country . 
  britain leaving can increase the chance of their countries leaving . 
  that 's something you have to respect and accept . 
  that sounds so weird to me . 
  he did what he promised . 
  no matter if he is pro or against . 
  he did it . 
  they will gain citizenship or move to were they came from . 
  or amnesty . 
  dude , do n't even try that crap . 
  poland gets treated like crap with what privileges the eu gives corporations . 
  yup , this will just lead to more exits . 
  such harsh words for leaving an organisation . 
  yes !, 
  antifa was *** not *** founded with good intentions . 
  it was a soviet organization to begin with . 
  ah , thanks !, 
  what are you even on about . 
  nothing you say can match the volume of which the studies and reports show . 
  you 're wrong and you have extremely limited knowledge of swedish military culture . 
  cognitive dissonance ? 
  http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article22064773.ab literally almost the entire swedish population wants conscription . 
  there are already studies that says exactly what i said . 
  kids wants to do military service but they do n't do it because of small reasons like getting their butts off to the recruitment center . 
  you have now proved you know absolutley nothing about the militarized culture in sweden . 
  you go to the military police ? 
  military police are very often part time and works the rest as regular police officers . 
  they 're a one of a kind who does what their profession demands . 
  sweden is not romania . 
  great argument . 
  that 's what makes debates on / r/europe concerning conscription so hard . 
  conscription around the world varies heavily . 
  in sweden , it 's illegal to use military personel to build/repair houses etc. 
  having a conscript shopping for a general ? 
  what the matter with all the main land europeans and americans here saying that no one in sweden wants to do military service ? 
  majority wants to , it 's just that they opt out when it comes down to the pencil . 
  cosnciption has always worked as a `` push '' . 
   i would like to see better salaries to make it more attractive to pursue a career in the military that 's already been the main debate around the armed forces for seven years . 
  it 's not happening . 
  the sallary is going up for the careeer soldiers that continue after conscription like it did before they paused conscription . 
   probably the first time you 'll ever hear me say it , but snyggkille has the right of it . 
  you 've said it once before !, 
  but yeah , what you said . 
  the swedish armed forces have access to your health records . 
  it 's not questions like `` write an essay saying why you do n't want to server your nation when it needs you the most '' . 
  it 's ( have you had surgery on your knee ? 
  how long did it take for you to regain movement ? ), 
  the testing was paused with the actuall cosncription . 
  although , the personal traits and physical self evaluation online is still in use . 
  this right here . 
  that 's what conscription since 2000 in sweden has been . 
  but as soon as the parliment says `` large army , now '' it turns into a cinscription that reddit is more familiar with . 
  english is not my first languege . 
  but to me , eighteen year olds are kids . 
  by the time they have served in uniform , they 're still kids . 
  it 's important to remember that it 's kids and young men that fight wars . 
  sweden has always had a different military doctrine than the rest of mainland europe . 
  so the `` delay and destroy '' is still the main objective . 
  but equipment , training and everything about the soldier and his tools has been modernized . 
  ** e ** : here 's an example ; http://2static.fjcdn.com/large/pictures/fe/7a/fe7a76_5812711.jpg https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uy1vmspu13o/maxresdefault.jpg but it 's important to note that since sweden has been so militarized , it 's always had a `` modern '' armed forces thanks to a self sufficient arms industry and the conscription . 
  there 's a reason the politicians did n't remove conscription . 
  they only `` paused '' it . 
  and now it 's being resumed . 
  and there 's a reason no party has ever touched the arms industry in sweden . 
  hahaha !, 
  reddit leftists wants equality , but some to get more equality . 
  swedish conscripts has always and still are compensated . 
  every one who turns 18 in sweden are , by law , needed to fill out an internet paper expressing personal traits and basic physical info . 
  last , they fill out if they are negative , kind of negative , kind of positive or very positive to conscription . 
  only 13 000 kids who has filled out the `` very '' or `` kinda '' positive option will be called . 
   conscription should entail either everyone or no one if you are building an armed forces from ground up , that 's not possible . 
  first , you can only train a few , whom will train the massive numbers that comes after them . 
  if sweden takes in 50 000 a year like they did during the late cold war ( armed forces made out of a total of 800 000 service members ) in modern days , then there would n't be enough mp to keep them in check if something happened . 
  by taking in only a few in the beginning , they build a good reputation with their friends and family . 
  opening up for more kidz being positive about conscription . 
   social service such as cleaning up , or helping in a hospice , kindergarten , senior home with the `` alternative '' being military , where service either pays better , is shorter or both . 
  that already existed here in sweden , it was called `` total defense duty '' and was one of the worlds only and most effective and organised systems in the world . 
  up until the 2000 's when the socialis democrats and moderates thrased it in favour of saving money . 
  and now they have to put out a lot to rebuild it . 
  ** e ** : about the remarks on me using the term `` kids '' . 
  they are kids , young men .
