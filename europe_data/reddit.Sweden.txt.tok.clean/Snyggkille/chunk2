  direct democracy feels like the best . 
  however , with people in this country spread out so much and not at all dense . 
  staging a dircet democracy ( unless a flawless electronic system ) is very * very * hard . 
  no there would n't . 
  the reason nothing has happened is because it literally came out sunday evening . 
  people are just waking up as we are writing these right now . 
  shitstorm will ensue . 
  no matter if the perpetrators are brown or white or if the victims are poor or rich . 
  the ones this happened to are middle class . 
   there 's a big difference between assault , sexual assault and rape . 
  mate , sweden has more definitions of rape than most western world countries has . 
  what you define as sexual harassment can very well be rape . 
  and even if no one was `` raped '' in the sense of an american traditional view of it . 
  there were still girls , as young as twelve that got sexually harassed . 
  and / u/visiblysane tried to excuse that . 
  either that or he missenterperated this whole ordeal . 
  which i think is more likely . 
  my bad then . 
  i thought you meant that it was okay what was happening because it 's what `` always '' happens . 
  i agree with you . 
  he has a political agenda . 
  if he gets the sweden he wants through his acts . 
  he 'll do it . 
  do your fact checking fuck nut . 
  the article op linked to was svt and that 's * their * wording . 
  but the article that svt *** reported *** about and `` rewrote '' . 
  says what op said . 
  in other words . 
  svt rewrote the original thing with their political agenda like they always do . 
  partially . 
  this happens . 
  but certainly not to every one . 
  we have a terrorist group here that our safety police ( s\u00c4po kinda like fbi ) deemed to be one of swedens biggest threats . 
  that is called `` afa '' . 
  `` anti fachist action '' . 
  those were also the guys that beat that migrant worker . 
  they beat every one right of the socialist democrats . 
  but this is just in `` protests '' . 
  sometimes though they attack individualls . 
  like when our swedish local whiteboy rapper `` sebbe staxx '' ( hates cops , carries pistols , gets arrested etc ) decided to `` fuck up '' a `` nazi '' . 
  him and afa thugs decided to * axe * a door down and throw molotov coctails into a house . 
  containing , not a nazi . 
  but a * mother and a daughter * . 
  they are bathshit insane and behave and talk just like * real * nazis . 
  but luckely they are on the decline in population . 
  nope . 
  it 's just gotten out . 
  it 's sunday night . 
  it 's still a mess . 
  i 'm looking forward to this week . 
  people are in for some extra strong coffee when they wake up in four hours . 
  they just hired the chief of a strong leftist newspaper to be their tv program director ( pics what to air on tv ) . 
  they need to appear neutral . 
  that 's the point . 
  the one that said `` it 's been out there '' is trying to save his ass . 
  then what was the point in your comment ? 
  no it 's not . 
  what the *** fuck *** do you mean it 's '' * just * politics '' . 
  they are the *** police *** . 
  they are covering up rape and sexual harrasment to push a political agenda . 
  that 's illegal . 
  it happened to regular swedish teenage girls . 
  and you 're trying to excuse it . 
  nope . 
  he 's not . 
  and the reason why is to prevent people with a political agenda to reach the position . 
  *** which failed *** . 
  what facts ? 
  the chief was *** not *** afraid of the media . 
  he is publicly a leftist and when he worked as chief of migrations office he even tweeted about how jimmie \u00c5kesson makes him puke . 
  the dude is trying to alter sweden because of his political views . 
  not because he is afraid of what the media would think of him . 
  shameful ? 
  that 's downright *** corruption *** and it 's *** illegal *** . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/sweden/comments/40ciqb/%c3%b6vergreppen_p%c3%a5_festivalen_i_stockholm/cyt7a7p their chief , [ dan eliasson ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/dan_eliasson ) , got the job as national police chief because when he was head of the social insurance agency tweeted '' [ usually i keep to the social insurance agency . 
  but jimmie \u00c5kesson ( party leader of the swedish democrats ) in debate makes me puke ] ( http://www.svd.se/myndighetschef-kraks-over-akesson ) ! '', 
  he has also been the chief of the migrations office and been a state secretary ( as in *** the *** state and not a `` state '' as the american meaning ) for thomas bodstr\u00f6m . 
  when he was chief of the migrations office he was accused of `` detail controlling '' . 
  also known as `` tampering with facts '' or as police say ; `` spoilation of evidence '' and to fire personel that criticized the leading . 
  he has also admitted to `` encouraging '' an employee to censor a [ wikipedia article from an `` agency/authority '' computer ] ( http://www.dn.se/ekonomi/myndigheter-censurerar-wikipediatexter/ ) . 
  seems like the land of corruption is the land to claim to have the least . 
  sweden is such a fucked up country . 
  you know those counter battery radars have a very limited range and are amongst the easely spotted radars in combat ? 
  [ have em here in sweden too ] ( https://www.google.se/search?q=kustartilleri&amp;safe=off&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1258&amp;bih=606&amp;site=webhp&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewi_9kouiz7kahxf8hikhcb2b7mq_auibigb ) . 
  stop playing dumb . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3zdqk7/recent_survey_72_of_swedes_want_to_reintroduce/cynzuts there is the explanation of why you are wrong . 
   i give you several reasons for why majority vote does not make right no all you do is say that `` the majority does n't get to decide what to do or what is right '' . 
  over and over again telling me i 'm not explaining why they are . 
   if the majority is always right , why is gangrape wrong ? 
  because the majority has decided that it is wrong . 
  the rapers and the victim are still in a nation . 
  and in this case , sweden , the majority has decided that gang rape is wrong and voted for it to be illegal . 
  stop playing dumb . 
  i have answered all of your points and questions . 
  i have provided you with sources and facts to back up my claims . 
  does n't matter if what the majority thinks is right is absurd . 
  it 's * still * right . 
  and i do n't care what / r/askphilosophy thinks . 
  why would i care what they think when we 're about to un pause swedish conscription ? 
   i 'm wrong without telling me why or how i 'm wrong .
