  i have just explained to you why and how you are wrong . 
   this means it 's impossible to argue with you . 
  you can argue with me . 
  it 's just that your claim that '' the majority do n't decide '' is wrong . 
  it 's the reason we have representative elections . 
  do you not understand how a democracy works ? 
  people vote about something . 
  let 's say . 
  one nation will vote wether or not to build a highway . 
  the minority of the nation votes no . 
  the majority votes yes on wether or not they should build it . 
  the majority has decided for the entire population to build it . 
  therefor it 's built . 
  the minority voted no . 
  so they have n't decided to not built it . 
  the majority decides . 
  the majority decides what 's right . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/conscription_in_finland https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/conscription_in_russia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/norwegian_armed_forces http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/europe/dk-conscription.htm https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonia_defence_forces http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-31607930 http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27247428 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/conscription_in_israel#military_service_obligation which are just to name a * few * . 
   sigh . 
  no , they will tell you that right is not up to majority vote . 
  whether they tell you what you ask is up to whether they agree with conscription or not . 
  which shows you that the / r/philosophy sub does n't understand how the world works . 
  in almost al of america . 
  the majority has voted that the age of consent is 18 . 
  in sweden , norway , finland and denmark . 
  the majority has voted for it to be 15 . 
  which means that the majority decides and votes on what is wrong or right . 
  if is ask them . 
  conscription would be bad ( or good , i do n't know what they think ) . 
  but they 're not the population of sweden . 
  which means that they ca n't decide what is right or wrong in this society . 
  what is good or bad in their respective societies is up the majorities in them . 
  do you understand how it works now ? 
  what is bad or good in a nation is up to the majority of the society of a nation . 
  what should be done or not done in a nation is up to the majority in said country . 
   it tells you they disagree with you . 
  yup . 
  and if the majority if philosophy thinks that conscription would be bad for nation of / r/philosophy . 
  then it would be bad . 
  do you understand or do you want to keep playing dumb to avoid admitting i 'm right ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/majority_rule http://www.eu-upplysningen.se/faq/fragor-och-svar/sverige-och-eu/hur-manga-i-sverige-rostade-ja-till-eu/ the majority of sweden wanted the eu . 
  which mean that it was the right thing . 
  now the majority wants out of it which means it 's a bad thing to be in it . 
  and that will be enforced when we vote about it . 
  the majority of sweden thinks rape is bad . 
  which means it 's bad . 
  the majority of sweden has voted for it to be illegal . 
  which means it 's illegal . 
  so this is why you are so damned wrong . 
  you do n't know what the world looks like nor how it works . 
  if you are put in a room with nine strangers . 
  you think conscription is wrong . 
  they think conscription is right . 
  you are in the wrong . 
  that 's how the world works in western countries democracies . 
  wether or not you want it to work that way , it 's how it works . 
  and you ca n't deny that no matter how much you want it to be wrong . 
  seriously , you need to grow up if you think the world does n't work that way just because you do n't want it to work hat way . 
  tell me , does the majority of / r/askphilosophy believe that philosophically the minority that are against conscription are right ? 
  if the answer is yes , that should tell you a lot about that sub . 
  if the sub / r/sweden and / r/philosophy were to be the total population of one nation . 
  conscription would be right . 
  wether or not the population of / r/philosophy would think it was wrong or not . 
  it would be right . 
  the majority would be for conscription and therefor it would be right . 
  what makes you think / r/philosophy gets to decide who is right or wrong ? 
  is it because of their feelings ? 
  it 's not . 
  the majority decides what is wrong or right . 
  that 's how humans work . 
  and because of democracy , that is how society in the western world works . 
  you ca n't deny that . 
  there 's literally living proof of that . 
  the entire of europe is proof of that . 
  because if the majority of sweden wants id checks and border control to be implemented they will get that . 
  here 's proof of that ; http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/lugnt-vid-inforandet-av-id-kontrollerna/ no matter what the minority thinks ( which thought it was wrong and that it should n't be implemented because it 's facist ) . 
  you need to grow up and stop thinking the world works like / r/philosphy thinks it works just because you ant it to work that way . 
  yes . 
  it was . 
  the majority thought it was right so therefore it was right . 
  the majority no longer thinks it 's right . 
  therefor it 's wrong . 
   no comparison . 
  if you think that 's a comparison i feel sorry for your intellect . 
  what i did was apply the logic to another case where the same logic comes to a ridiculous conclusion : that slavery is right . 
  this is basic rational thinking . 
  are you even reading comprehensible ? 
  quote me were i said it was a comparison . 
   please think about what your statements mean in reality . 
  what ? 
  what does that even mean ? 
  that it would n't work ? 
  that it would ` enslave the entire population of sweden and torture them !! 11 ' ? 
   no , it is not . 
  it is . 
  what part of representative politics do n't you understand ? 
  how young are you not to understand how the majority of western countries work ? 
  if the majority wants something they get it . 
  that 's one of the basic concepts of western democracy . 
   offs ... ca n't even find a proper argument now that you realize you 're wrong ?
