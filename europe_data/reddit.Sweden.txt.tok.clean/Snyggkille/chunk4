   i do n't even know where to begin with you . 
  my god , man . 
    offs ... 
  i 'd be happy with just a simple comment stating that you are wrong . 
  it 's obvious that you ca n't counter my arguments and facts any more . 
  seriously , you know you are wrong . 
  and you 're making it obvious . 
  if you get mentally ill you can leave and will receive help . 
  do you also have this much problems with al laws that are forced on you ? 
  do you think school is bad too since it 's forced ? 
  do you think your own life is bad since it 's forced on you ? 
  that 's pretty cool . 
  zif you accept then that slavery was ever right , i shall agree with you . 
  but no , might does not make right . 
  slavery was right at the time . 
  times change and so does our opinions and values . 
  slavery is not right now . 
  and comparing the suffering of slaves in e.g south america to that of soldiers that only has to go through education , get free food , friends , no actual working `` labour '' a salary , housing and so on , is just wrong . 
  do you also compare a an honest working job as slavery ? 
  without it you 'll die . 
  you wo n't be able to buy food or live indoors . 
   no , you 're saying that had you had your way you would make it a crime to refuse . 
  no i 'm saying that if i have my way conscription would be put on play and unpaused . 
   `` will work '' . 
  so you 're doing exactly what i said you did and then claim that you do n't . 
  i do n't understand what you mean in this sentence . 
   so what happens if someone refuses ? 
  hardly any one actually refuses once they 're there . 
  if they still insist they 're being tortured with free housing , food , education and friends they are let go . 
   it 's not up for either of them or you to decide it . 
  yes , weather or not you ** think ** it should be up to us . 
  ** it is ** up to us . 
  that 's how democracy works in sweden . 
  the majority gets to decide what is wrong or right and what should be legal or illegal . 
  and if conscription should be un paused or not . 
   oh and i can guarantee you that if you have forced conscription of all swedish male citizens , people will get hazed . 
  no they wo n't . 
  that shit sopped a few generations ago . 
  there 's zero tolerance for that and people who are caught getting physical with others for absolutely no reason are thrown out . 
  we had conscription for all swedish male citizens as short as five years ago . 
  no hazing there . 
  there 's a reason the swedish armed forces , let alone the conscription has such good reputation of giving you life friends and great connection . 
  there 's not a reputation of hazing . 
  and you obviously do n't know anything about our societies moral standpoints . 
  hazing is long forgotten in such fields and it 's almost completely eradicated from school . 
  this right here . 
  i had and still have a hard time believing hazing is even accepted in the finnish army . 
  and yes , back in the day when our dads did it . 
  my grandpa almost got beaten up for going on leave with the uniform to dance in the next town nearby . 
  but such is old time nordics . 
  still is a bit . 
  they still send the letters to the `` m\u00f6nstring '' were they check were you fit and how fit you are . 
  the swedish army still can and will call you in in a potential war . 
  however the letter to call you into conscription ( as in the one year training ) is no longer sent out . 
  have n't been for quite a while as they usually mailed you near the end of the conscription . 
  swedish , tall and handsome . 
  does that work ? 
  and if a country with the same ideals as slovenia has on same sex marriage were to try and tell the gay people of * your * country what to do or even try to get `` rid '' of them . 
  would you just stand by ? 
  conscription in sweden insures gays rights to marry and fuck whoever they want . 
  but yes , if you want to get philosophical and practical . 
  the majority decides what 's wrong or right . 
  weather or not you agree . 
  and you ca n't say that 's wrong . 
  because that 's how it works since every body follows that . 
  if you want to change that then you have to change that . 
  if some on want to change you you have to defend yourself . 
  wether it be diplomatic or physical . 
  the majority decides what is wrong or right . 
  no matter your individual opinion on it . 
  and if another country majority wants to change your countries majority . 
  you will have to defend what your majority say is right if you are so much for `` what 's right '' . 
  yeah , a freedom that you , in my eyes , have to pay back for . 
  it 's not the same agressiveness . 
  my `` agressivness '' is defensive . 
  i do n't promote killing people unless you really have to . 
  i do n't promote invading countries or making threats to them . 
  russia , as one does however threaten us and our neighbor with `` nuking us '' , even if they will most likely use manpower instead of nukes , we have to defend us from that . 
  and those `` some '' does n't realize what defending and attacking means . 
  do those `` some '' also see no difference , in a hyperbolic statement , defending yourself against a rapist , or drive burglar out of your home or actually breaking in or raping ? 
  those 28 % , and the others that does n't do the conscription , which only 70 000 does every year out of nearly ten million people . 
  they do what they want to do . 
  if they really feel that it 's horrendous and painful to do military service once they get to it , then they are allowed to walk their way . 
  it 's always been like that in the swedish conscription . 
  are you telling me that sweden , out of all countries , should rather start focusing on diplomatic solutions that instead of military ? 
  out of all countries , saying that sweden should do that is quite ironic . 
  and for that matter . 
  all military conflicts in modern days with one european member are always tried to be solved with diplomatic solutions . 
  military action is never used unless it 's quickly needed or all else has failed . 
  every bomb dropped is bomb dropped with purpose . 
  every bullet shot is shot with purpose . 
  weather it is to practice aim or stop an invader . 
  and resources along with money itself is no problem for us . 
  we have one of the worlds best economies and we can , if we prioritize right . 
  have one of the best militaries to ( we have that but i mean a larger one ) . 
  sweden , already takes care of it 's citizens . 
  and taking care also means protecting . 
  and sacrificing one year of your life to train yourself to protect . 
  regardless of how little that border means to you . 
  it means the world to others .
