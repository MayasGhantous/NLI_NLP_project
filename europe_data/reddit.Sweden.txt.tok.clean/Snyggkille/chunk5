  and without that border . 
  we would n't be able to be the great welfare and humanist society we are today . 
  '' * if you want peace , prepare for war * '', 
  i 've already explained it for you . 
  when people get that letter home telling them to do it . 
  they do it . 
  it just takes a little push . 
  and the very few that thinks it 's horrible can walk their way and do theirs . 
  the `` forced '' conscription is there to give that `` push '' . 
  and no , i agree with you . 
  that phenomenon is called `` the majority tyranny '' and is spoken off as one of democracies dilemma . 
  but , we 're speaking of a majority making up 72 % of swedens population . 
   oh , you idiot . 
  laws do not make anything right or wrong , they make things lawful or unlawful . 
  we do n't have any such responsibilites . 
  get out of your head and reason like a reasonable person . 
  no you 're right . 
  but the *** majority *** deems what is right and wrong and right now , and through the history back to 1900 . 
  the majority thinks that should be a responsibility . 
   the point is you ca n't add arbitrary responsibilities . 
  you must justify why i should have a responsibility to die for my country . 
  you ca n't . 
  oh no , do n't get me wrong . 
  i 'm trying to tell you why you should be willing to go to war for ** my ** country if you decide to nurture off of it for 18 years . 
   you 're just making a claim and saying `` that is how it works '' . 
  you are as lazy a debater as you are a thinker . 
  you 're missing my point . 
  that is literally how it has worked and will work . 
  you payed back to your country through conscription until five years ago . 
  and according to public opinion . 
  you shall do it in the near future too . 
   you mean a gun to their head ? 
  what gun ? 
  did you really just compare swedish conscription to getting forced to do something or get shot ? 
  that 's not how conscription works here . 
  never has and never will . 
  the ones that think conscription is so damn horrible , which always turns out to be as few as les than 500 people . 
  can leave if they want to . 
   with the way you 're arguing i 'm surprised you can find your shoes to tie your shoe-laces when you go out . 
  you see , i learned to tie my shoes when i was four and polish them when i was 15 . 
  many do n't even learn that last one until they join the army . 
   but do n't force others just because you have crazy ideas of how the world works . 
  you got it all wrong . 
  ** me ** and the ** majority ** of sweden thinks , knows and wants the world to work that way . 
  i can get you a nice spot in my conscription bed . 
  those 1 % will usually get dismissed if they really are in pain from getting housing , food , education , activity and friends . 
  which has happened in sweden and will happen again once conscription is back . 
  you 're talking as if conscription is some great slave driving torture horror show . 
  and yes , if the majority wants it . 
  they should do it . 
  that 's how democracy works . 
  do n't you like democracy ? 
  i can agree with you , sometimes it 's bad but i find it to be good most of the time . 
  you 're missing the fact that in sweden . 
  if you 're so pathetic that you find free housing , food , education , friends and physical training similar to that of rape . 
  you can get dismissed if you want to . 
  hardly any one complains when they actually do it . 
   it 's not so black and white , some people in the service make `` friends for life '' , others get hazed and commit suicide . 
  in finland suicide levels among conscripts are higher than the average population . 
  what the . 
  swedish conscripts in todays time does not get hazed . 
  and finland is not sweden . 
  let alone that finland itself is much mor conservative than sweden is which may be why hazing is still popular in their army . 
   i 'm not saying conscription is good or bad , but it does have a dark side and all of the things that are n't directly related to military activity such as handling assault weapons can be learned elsewhere in the civilian world . 
  you 're absolutely right . 
  point is just that if people learn how to use those assault weapons with other people . 
  they will be better prepared if a large number of other people with assault rifles wants to harm them . 
   you have no such responsibilites no . 
  this is just adding extra responsibilities arbitrarily . 
  with conscription you will . 
   that 's like you walking into my corner shop and buying some candy only for me to expect you to defend the store from a robbery . 
  that 's not how it works . 
  you just explained it yourself . 
  except the concept would be that my payment of that candy would be the conscription . 
  conscription does n't come after i pay you and get what i want . 
  in other words . 
  i 'll get some candy form you ( in this case water and bread to stay alive ) if i defend your store for two days . 
   you saying that does n't make it so . 
  and what does that even mean `` that 's not how it works '' ? 
  how does it work ? 
  i 'm not being funny here , i literally do not know what that means . 
  for as long as sweden has had even a minor form of welfare or human rights . 
  the ones that got it got it through conscription or wealth . 
  that is how it works . 
  if you want to live in sweden and get all the good things like all of the human rights we have . 
  the tasty welfare . 
  you have to give something back . 
  only for the last five years has it not worked that way . 
  and it 's about to work that way soon again . 
   as i said , maybe you and them can go volunteer if you believe so . 
  hahaha . 
  do n't you think i 've already done that ? 
  my brothers did that . 
  my friends did that . 
  my father did that . 
  my grandfathers did that and their fathers did that . 
  difference is . 
  i volunteered since it was n't mandatory for me . 
  so did pretty many other too . 
  and so will almost all of swedens youth do to if democracy is going to work the way it should .
