  the people , especially the youth wants the conscription to be mandatory . 
  so shall it be . 
   and again , if someone believes those things are important they can volunteer . 
  many do , even more would if it was n't so hard to get into the gmu training since it 's hard to get a spot . 
  which would change if it was the conscription model . 
  and even more people would if it was mandatory , since all they need to do this , is to get a little `` push '' and some one to tell them to do that . 
  in an accident . 
  no one feels that they do n't want to help the wounded , right ? 
  every one wants to help . 
  but no one does it . 
  that 's why you go through cpr get taught to point at some one specifically and tell them what to do . 
  humans are a flock animal and they love the nature of order . 
  history has shown that and it can be pulled if as something great . 
  all people need is just a little `` push '' . 
  no you have n't understood the numbers at all . 
  72 % of swedes wants conscription . 
  the largest support came from the youth . 
  and it 's the youth that will do the conscription . 
  which means that the `` 72 % '' migh be even bigger if you ask the kids . 
  those `` 28 % '' might be sixty year olds . 
  what i 'm trying to say is that the study is a representative of * all * swedes . 
  not just the ones going to do the conscription . 
   as far a i know , sweden has n't been at war for a 100 years . 
  but in loads of conflicts . 
  let alone the fact that we had heaps of volunteers for just about every damn side in wwii . 
  just trust me . 
  we have the money . 
  we have the technology . 
  `` we can rebuild him '' . ^ ^ ^ ha ^ ^ ^ ^ ha ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ha all we need to to relocate tax payers money , and re implement conscription . 
  it really is that simple . 
  well ... it 's not * that * simple . 
  but you get my point . 
  yeah , that 's how it should be . 
  you 're absolutely right . 
  but that 's not how it works . 
  if you have the stomach to nurture and prosper from free healthcare , friendliness , hospitality , free education , free money and so much much more . 
  you shall fight for it too . 
  i do n't accept and wo n't accept anybody , unless disabled or unfit for action to leave this country or sit in a couch watching as everything that helped this person through life get wiped off into the ocean . 
  i do n't accept that and 72 % of sweden does n't either . 
  and as said before . 
  every one i 've talked to , even if i know them or not deem military training in sweden to be an honor / `` proudness '' for a better word . 
  all i 've talked to also agrees with me on the last point you made . 
  maybe / u/shamrockathens should stop trying to act as if sweden has no history of conflict or war . 
  nor any experience of it or even any knowledge about it . 
  which , even if it 's incredibly dumb to state that and if it even was right , somehow means that conscription is a bad thing for sweden just because he himself would n't defend his country . 
  go abolish conscription in your own country . 
  of course . 
  because if we get invaded it 's the rich people of swedens fault ? 
  what were you thinking when your wrote that comment ? 
   because most of that army is an `` on paper '' tiger in the sense that it 's a guy with a gun , but the second the fighting start half of them are dead . 
  yet again , you know nothing about war . 
   can it also take out the 50 others alongside it ? 
  ammunition is cheaper than your manpower . 
  yes , rbs systems are among the worlds best and cheapest . 
  we export it all around the world . 
  all we need is trained , armed and many young men to operate them . 
   field radar designed and operated by the americans i 'd imagine ? 
  so , without nato what are you ? 
  ... we invented the field radar that detects artillery . 
  we sell it to nato countries like loads of our technology . 
  so no . 
  and why would we need nato personel if we have our own conscript army ? 
   because calling me 8 times a retard in the span of 30 minutes was n't / s yeah you 're right . 
  that was bad of me . 
   i 'll damn ask you if i damn want . 
  of course if the answer is classified you are unlikely to answer , but that 's another thing they 've seen combat in every single one of these countries . 
  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/swedish_armed_forces_in_the_world.svg/940px-swedish_armed_forces_in_the_world.svg.png some more bloody like kongo . 
  were entire books about it are filled with pages of horror to less combat filled zones like http://www.zettby.se/hasse/images/forsvars_bilder/karta1.jpg liberia . 
   joke apart , imagine one of them is neutral and refuse your gear & manpower to pass , and the second one withdraw all their strategic assets from your country and suddenly you have no radar and overenight no spare parts for your grippens . 
  plan for the worst ? 
  no way in hell that norway and denmark are going to be neutral . 
  they 're a part of nato . 
  which means that they will either assist us completely or entirely leave us on our own . 
  neither i have a problem with . 
  but the gripen was made for such a war were we are unprepared . 
  it 's literally the basic concept of it . 
  and that 's why it 's such a big chance of finnland buying the new gripen ng in the coming few years and why denmark wants to buy it if we develop a sea carrier capable version with them . 
   contingency plans is what 's going to save your arse in the worst circumstances no ? 
  if not , why are the americans doing so many of them ? 
  are their own base strategy wrong ? 
  one countries strategy does not fit in with anothers . 
  india traines completely different than we do . 
  becuase they are under different circumstances . 
  we are under such circumstances were we need conscription . 
   here 's the big issue : what happends when the next war is n't just a repeat of the same cold war you plan for ? 
  it wo n't be . 
  that 's the point . 
  that 's why we have changed doctrines . 
  changed our way of educating and training . 
  that 's why whe have aquired new vehicles and why we train with the nato and russia . 
  but we will always need a large fighting force . 
   i doubt highly it 's conscription & military service that 's going to change anything on that . 
  one hundred terrorists will kill more police than ten will . 
  one hundred soldiers will kill more invaders than ten will . 
  one hundred doctors and nurses will save more people than ten will . 
  numbers are not everything . 
  but they 're a very important part . 
  that is actually pretty smart . 
  let 's try that out . 
  - all kids of a country train martial arts/physical training / or some other for of combat training .
