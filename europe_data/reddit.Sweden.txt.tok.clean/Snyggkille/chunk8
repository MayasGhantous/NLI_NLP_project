  those who reads this sees exactly what you 're doing and realizes exactly just how uneducated you are . 
  a tradition that has hold on until 2010 . 
  meaning it works , people are in favor of it and now 72 % of swedes want it back . 
  so yes , we should do it and will do it in the coming two years . 
   and nowaday one well placed strike kill thousands of soldiers . 
  large numbers are n't what they used to be . 
  there 's a reason modern armies became career armies . 
  what ... no it does n't . 
  seriously what is it with the dumb people in this thread that has no idea how war work . 
  do you even have any idea how hard it is to get a `` well placed strike '' . 
  let alone how hard it is to bomb that well placed `` marker '' . 
  do you have any idea how hard it is to perform air support in a conventional combat zone ? 
   and nowaday one well placed strike kill thousands of soldiers . 
  this is just a very bad statement overall . 
  no modern fighting force . 
  conscription or not places one thousand soldiers right next to each other in the middle of an open field without any kind of defense for that matter . 
   large numbers are n't what they used to be . 
  yes they are . 
  rules of engagement in modern armies are to have three times more soldiers than the other side when engaging as a standard `` point of view '' . 
  but if you even dare to be foolish enough to claim `` numbers are n't what they used to be '' . 
  then explain why russia can field up to a million soldiers . 
  why america has over a million combat ready personal and finland can field 300 000 soldiers thanks to conscription . 
  out of those 700 000 i was talking about . 
  they perform different roles . 
  since you know nothing about war . 
  let me give you a very brief non complex explanation . 
  many do logistics . 
  many are soldiers . 
  many drive the tanks . 
  many fly the planes . 
  many are military police . 
  many are defense . 
  many are evacuation personel . 
  many are anti air . 
  many are driving the submarines . 
  many are laying out sea mines . 
  many are hunting submarines . 
  many are escorting . 
  many are performing guerilla warfare . 
  which the entire swedish army has been trained for since the beginning of our armed forces . 
  many are going to perform `` buzz warfare '' . 
  many are going to be reconing . 
  many are going to be working for the public . 
  many are medical personel . 
  many fly the helicopters . 
  and so , *** so *** much more . 
  large numbers are always needed . 
  wether or not you understand that . 
  every one i have talked to thinks that . 
  old or young . 
  the only ones that have n't talked about it that way are very young women . 
  but they are willing to try it out . 
  yeah okay . 
  that comment is how i know you know nothing about war nor how it 's performed . 
  the swedish conscription model is cheaper , more effective and much more trained and has bigger morale than our current system . 
  for one hundred and ten years conscription worked perfectly . 
  even during our month long testing exercises every year . 
  it works and you have no idea how war is performed , nor how tactics actually works . 
  sweden has loads of resources , in todays situation , we just has to reposition them . 
  our past has proven that . 
  there is no way that wwiii wo n't start if russia even so touches norway . 
  but if even so . 
  sweden will go to war if russia even tries to get far into finland . 
  logistically ? 
  russia ca n't handle that . 
  no super power can meet two war ready countries with hundreds of thousands of troops on home ground without massive casualty , expense and public misstrust . 
  and that 's the point of a nordic defensive war . 
  to make it so expensive , casualty heavy and public turnaround in the invading country 's population that it 's not going to be worth it . 
  totally not . 
  hundreds of police quit their job , lack of nurses . 
  soldiers do n't always get their paycheck . 
  the elderly send in daily reports that they 're getting subpar food , care and so on . 
  immigrants literally sleep on the streets . 
  kids stop having dreams of moving out early , since they ca n't move anywhere . 
  swedish farmers quit their job and sell their farms every day because it 's not sustainable for them . 
  ffs , the police even protested in the hundreds right outside the nobel dinner . 
  people like you make me and a majority of the voting swedes sick to our stomach . 
  they ended conscription because the people wanted it to end when they were high on a `` we vote for rich politicians so we can feel rich and act rich '' binge . 
  almost the entire population regrets many things done since the 90 's and many think the country has only gone for the worse . 
  boy you have no idea what you 're talking about . 
  but swedes are n't sent to kill , never has and never will . 
  our conscription ( 1900-2010 ) was defensive and the coming conscription ( this year ) is going to be too . 
  yeah , it does work . 
  and they will just like he will . 
  did you miss the fact that he did the same thing that he wants others to do ? 
  ten years after the conscription is over for that person . 
  including he who you responded to . 
  the army can still call you in and will call you in incase of war . 
  he 's not putting anybody `` infront '' of him to do something instead of him . 
  we had conscription from 1900 to 2010 . 
  so did *** many *** european countries . 
  conscription does n't mean that you learn tactics , weapons , get the cothes of wwi . 
  you 'd be a retard to actually believe that . 
  you have no idea who the people raised during the cold war in sweden was nor what they were like . 
  you have absolutely no clue what swedish conscription is if you compare it to easter european `` humiliation and abuse '' . 
  are you forgetting that the youth did it every year since 1900 ? 
  they helped make up a total of 700 000 combat ready personel during the cold war . 
  the logic behind this is that if the system was in use , they would do it . 
  but with the current system , not all want to work for the army . 
  the logic is , `` a little push is all you need to get the machinery working '' .
