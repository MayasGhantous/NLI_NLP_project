  people are willing to do it . 
  but that 's only if it 's a mandatory thing that will `` push '' them to actually doing it instead of talking . 
  it 's like talking about going to the gym . 
  people will do it if they get a push to the entrence and get a taste of it . 
  then they stay . 
  but all agree that would do it . 
  it 's also easier of others do it too . 
  no it 's the truth . 
  the armed forces wants it . 
  how many people , of the young ones are willing to learn that by themselves when they have - iphone - social net - no clue what so ever what a war is or how it 's performed , increasing the chanse of it ever happening, 
  are you fucking retarded ? 
  sweden had among one of the worlds best defensive armies during the cold war . 
  just becuase you have something personal against conscription does n't mean it 's bad . 
  in sweden it 's good . 
  it 's cheap , it 's reliable and they get the same training as any other soldier . 
  many longer than usual to adapt to their specific role . 
  you should really watch a documentary on the swedish conscription . 
  in sweden ? 
  socialistic liberalism has existed since the very beginning we got representative elections . 
  you 'd be surprised . 
  conscriptions is tradition and honor here in sweden . 
  no do n't get me wrong . 
  finnish soldiers are good . 
  but they have committed war crimes too . 
  says the finnish guy . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_of_dagestan war of dagestan was a part of the chechen war . 
  and the fact that these dagestan men were a part of the chechen force makes them chechen militias . 
  that 's actually normal and actually fine . 
  you do n't know those people . 
  they 're miles away from you . 
  they 're dressed in clothes you 're not familiar with . 
  they sound different than what you usually hear and so on . 
  do n't be sorry for not being moved . 
  it 's human nature . 
  if it was your son . 
  you 'd be moved . 
  but it is not . 
  it may give you a bit of shock or simply disgust . 
  but that 's natural too . 
  humans do n't die fast . 
  the human body , an extraordinary tool for our brains , soul and feelings . 
  can endure much . 
  the scientific reason behind their `` survival '' or ... well . 
  prolonged death as it 's technical term is . 
  is that the body does n't start `` shutting '' down until after around 3-5 minutes of lack of oxygen to the body . 
  when the largest blood providers gets , cut off . 
  liters off blood pours in minutes . 
  with it , the chance to give the body the `` air '' it needs . 
  so , unfortunately , it takes a while to die when fatally injured this gruesome way . 
  it 's back . 
  they 're both very beautiful . 
  it 's in my edit . 
  it was actually broadcasted on news and passed around on the internet like leapfire i remember . 
  there 's quite a few people in their 40 's . 
  usually in uniform works that knows about this . 
  it 's also used to teach people in uniform to cover their faces in some jobs and etc. 
  reason is that every single one of the chechens was chased down after and during the war by russia and they 're all dead now . 
  simply because they all showed their face on camera . 
  it 's actually one of the first instances were such a `` chase '' phenomenon occurred with the tool of a digital video . 
  the reason people in , eg . 
  isis wears face cover during executions infront of video is for the very same reason that those chechens got chased down . 
  identification . 
  any one else remember that infamous video of chechen militias cutting the throats of captured young russian conscripts ? 
  gruesome and tragic war that was . 
  real filthy . 
  ** e ** : found [ it ] ( http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=173_1367845544 ) . 
  [ nsfl ] [ nsfw ] it 's up to you if you want to watch it . 
  it 's a piece of history and look at it as a representation of how brutal the war was . 
  but i 'm telling you not to do it . 
  ** e ** : ** the background ** ;  `` i could not watch this again , but here is a little background to it all . 
   in early september 1999 around two hundred chechen fighters crossed the border into dagestan , obviously looking for shit to fuck up . 
  a large group lead by one emir omar karpinski attacked on the outskirts of the village tuhchar where a group of dagestani policemen were stationed along with 13 russian internal troops and a bmp-2 at a checkpoint . 
  they attacked from the rear , surrounded and inflicted huge damage on the russians by shelling them . 
  the bmp was entrenched and took down many chechen fighters . 
  russian lt. vasily taskin ordered the armored vehicle to drive out of the trench and open fire across the river on a car full of rebels fast approaching them . 
  this was a huge mistake : a shot from a rocket-propelled grenade at the bmp obliterated it . 
  the gunner was killed and the driver wounded . 
   the defensive was over and it was time to go . 
  many of the russians and dagestani police either hid in the village in attics , basements , even under corn or managed to evade the chechens who now owned the area . 
  five young russian troops staged a firefight from a house and managed to last until they ran out of ammo . 
  machine gun fire and a shot from a grenade launcher convinced them to surrender . 
  a sixth was turned in by villagers who obviously didnt think much of russians . 
   by order of the emir omar the prisoners were taken to a clearing near the outpost . 
  the event was meticulously recorded by the camera operator islanu mukaeva . 
  emir omar was pissed at the amount of his own men that had been blown away by the bmp and ordered the prisoners execution , and called all the men in to watch . 
  emir omar then ordered his men to cut the heads off the soldiers . 
  five of the men including lt taskin had there throats half cut ( so they suffered more ) or were virtually beheaded , except for private alexey lipatov who was shot after he managed to slip away and escape . 
  the militant chasing lipatov grew tired of that shit quicky and just shot him instead . 
  the final man killed in the video ( and possibly the most gruesome angle in the vid ) was done by emir omar karpinski himself . 
  this would be the end of the video , and the matter for now . 
   in the year 2000 the russian fsb tracked down islanu mukaeva and his video collection . 
  he can be heard as the cameraman on the video encouraging the men with the knives . 
  he was charged with terrorism and being a member of an illegal group and given 25 years in prison . 
   his video now helped identify the others . 
  they have since been killed by special forces operations , captured or remain wanted . 
  during his caputure police also seized weapons , ammunition and another videotape execution of russian servicemen ( this one is unknown ) . 
  tamerlane hasaeva was captured next . 
  well , he was already in prison for kidnapping , so captured is a useless word . 
  he explained he was reluctant to cut the head off anyone , and in the video he only jabbed the guy in the neck and then handed the knife over ( blue shirt , black pants in the video ) . 
  he was there for salvaged weapons according to his story , he could sell them and make money .
