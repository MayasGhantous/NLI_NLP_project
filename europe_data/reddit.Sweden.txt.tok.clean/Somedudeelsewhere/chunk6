  spoiler alert , the secret is a refrigerator inside the sauna lol, 
  he did not state it as a fact but more of a question and my comment was a general view point i had so do n't take me for his '' wrongdoing '' . 
  you ask what does it say about me ? 
  that i have my personal opinion . 
  and now what does it say about you ? 
  that you do n't like others to have opinions just like marx , lenin , stalin and your other idols . 
  i like my coffee how i like my death stars : gigantic , on the dark side and powerful enough to destroy a planet . 
  vikings and romans unite !, 
  it happen over night , no big deal . 
  most be a confused world to live in 2016 for left wings , their head must hurt so much trying to make sense of things . 
  yeah i think it is more of being jealous to call irland a tax haven , '' real tax havens '' such as the uk have are 0 % tax but hey look at how well irland do it must be the those low taxes !, 
  ( tax haven bastards ), 
  poland can into wall street . 
  there is a reason we got koenigsegg sport cars and you do n't denmark lol . 
  i feel bad for normal turks over this guy , he really trying to sound like a muppet all the time . 
  we have some muppet wannabe over here in sweden too so i know how you feel its embarrassing :p, 
  maybe italy can learn from irland in cutting its taxes for more growth ? 
  my country have been there having one of the highest tax in eu some 10-15year ago but we kept cutting the tax heavy before and during the 2008 crisis so we got over it quit well . 
  i also heard about the huge difference from south to north in italy where north is more productive like countries such as germany eg and south which is more laidback . 
  maybe that is a culture gap that ca n't be adapt fast enough to a fast phased global competitive world for the south which is a bit of a problem ? 
  and yeah you need to get ride of the bureaucracy together with some corruption for more inter global connected growth agree on that . 
  as european i hope italy can get on its feet again so we can compete with china , india and the world together . 
  average chocolate and beer , 
  why did italy stop growing for such long time ? 
  i know about 2008/dept crisis but there most be more to it right ? 
  maybe english is already a language most learn in school when young . 
  i sucked at pingpong anyway . 
  you are now banned from / r/pyongyang, 
   our whole system is based on the notion that people will do as they are told . 
  this naive system have to change right away it totally does not work in our time anymore . 
  seriously countries who refuse to get their citizens back who overstay their refugees status/visa should be imposed sanctions by sweden/eu . 
  we give away like 1,5 % of gdp each year in foreign aid to 3rd world countries so lets cut that to whoever treating us like this and if that not help then cut trade with that country . 
  edit . 
  most countries who refuse get back its citizen are often authoritarian dictatorship shitholes and not care about their citizens but they sure care about their own privileges like luxury imports from europe and offshore banking . 
  it is almost as we should control our intake of refugees to match our resources ... 
  before i was clicking the link to get bigger picture i was like '' shit on fire yo '' .

  the only way to invest in china is to place your money in properties which drive price up like crazy and it spills over to anglo countries with high living standards pretty much . 
  i stay in shenzhen which has the most crazy apartment prices in all of china . 
  some of the new construction needs to sell apartments above 200k yuan/sqm to break even today .

  canada and australia good affordable housing market .

   wto rules . 
  eu countries are part of a single wto bloc which uk needs to leave if it want 's out of the single market btw . 
  negotiate new wto deals can take years/decades and the trend is that newer wto members get worse deals then orders ( russia/china e.g. 
  damn it looks like the 90s . 
  something seems fishy with that island . 
  im sure ecb would be happy having argentine joining the euro :d,

  the music was perfect but it would have been good to have subtitle on what the balaclava flag gimp actually says .

  sweden and finland source https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ice_hockey_world_championships, 
  yeah we better get our shit together before helping others . 
   the peasants can not stand trees . 
  emailious, 
  i live in china and people tell me we got good chocolates . 
  even people from china , korea and japan mix up sweden and switzerland . 
   does anyone claim this ? 
  i think a lot of people ( me included ) recently feels that many americans comparing high crime areas / '' no-go zone 's '' in sweden or france/germany with 3rd world countries rather then with us cities and that is what piss people off a lot as if europe have massive problems that us do n't have . 
  and so instead of talking about the problems and how to make things better people will ignore it and defend them self . 
  for example when the us president spoke about making america great and then gave an example of the huge problems over in sweden many swedes was fast to point out that the homicide national average was 4 times higher in us instead of talking about the problems we have in sweden . 
  edit . 
  if more americans just like you talk about crime areas and segregation in the us and then bring up same/similar problems in europe many europeans will adress their opinion and talk about how to deal with problems in europe much more easy . 
  op you should have made the sandwich picture to have chicken in it would have been golden [ talk about lost opportunity ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/subway-chicken-dna-soy-fillers-strips-fast-food-sandwich-chain-cbc-report-a7605291.html ), 
   though i hate the idea that some must serve and others not . 
  imagine you are one if the 4.000 who has to serve , but sure as fucking hell does n't want to in the old system in sweden you had to talk to an psychologist and i told my psychologist that i did not want to join the military and the psychologist would simply '' fail '' my test by writing down that i did not have the motivation . 
  if the intake is small as 4000 probably only people who are well fit , strong psychology and will can join which is good for everyone .
