  he was talking about florida relax . 
  un elected body ( house of lords ) rejecting a bill and give it back to house of commons where elected parties such as ukip ( 12.6 % of national vote but only 1/650 seats ) are going to vote on the bill again . 
  sounds super democratic you must be happy that you will leave the un elected eu soon , this for sure will boost the popularity of brexit . 
  expanding our galactic imperial, 
   europ\u00e4ische wehrmacht that sounds terrifying , good for our enemies . 
  would have been better if we got ride of nato in the end of the soviet and had our eu military already , could probably have had better relation with russia too . 
  look it on the good side like you said , uk wont be hindering the progress and could rejoin latter on . 
  also lets hope both sides get a good negotiating so we can get along in the meantime . 
   '' this new structure will likely be headed by finnish general esa pulkkinen , already the chief of the european union military staff . '', 
  checkmate russia . 
  we have already been dublin ' the population !, 
  now we need dublin ' it again to 2.700,000, 
  my my, 
  our nordic union would outdrink your union at a party . 
  it is satire and we are shitting on everyone not just america but go ahead and be the most butthurt one . 
  the independent source is a government source told to the telegraph so yeah it is not a official statement but i said it was a arrogant statement . 
  edit . 
  i have overall a feel that may work towards a hard brexit and chill relations with the eu which i feel is sad given the obvious outcome for both uk and eu . 
  im not british but it feels unfair for the small margin of voters who really wanted to distance them self away from europe and just wanted to leave the eu ( before the vote efta was an option and an argument to leave eu but after the vote it was all hard brexit that matter ) and i am sad over the political land cape that become more populist around europe and the western world . 
   government source claiming that otherwise `` half of romania and bulgaria '' might come to the uk before brexit . 
  not arrogant statement at all ... 
  i have a feeling that the uk are creating a very chill relationship with rest of europe . 
  it says on wiki that it is based on nokia x platform an modified android jelly bean 4.1.2 version but you are right . 
  i guess the media call nokia 6 the first android version to hype it but im still getting it and i think it is a finnish company behind it so thats good right ? 
  im thinking of getting the first android version of [ nokia ] ( http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/139935-nokia-s-first-android-phone-is-the-nokia-6-but-there-s-a-catch ), 
  trump imposes tariffs and being countered by china and eu , then china and eu remove trade barrier between them self = huge lose for us for sure . 
  better as in your personal opinion ? 
  i was talking about number on subscribers . 
  apple went in on competition with spotify on the music streaming market and have less subscribers so an example of a good startup company being able to survive and compete with a already huge multi billion company . 
  edit btw a lot of patents in the iphone are owned by ericsson so apple 's success is ericssons success . 
  if ericsson would stop licensing out bluetooth and shit the iphone without phone jacks would be pretty useless . 
  wall street aside sweden invest more on average in the stock market per capital then in the us by far . 
  we also have a few successful statups like spotify that apple ca n't beat . 
  sweden is also 1/33th of us population so you could as well compare michigan with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/silicon_valley and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wall_street and say new york/san francisco have better opportunities . 
  im not sure if 29 % more money is that good if you pay 67 % more healthcare and so for the average person but america will always be great for the rich . 
  [ footage of the attack ] ( https://youtu.be/f5sh1qugnym?t=25 ) 2017-02-18 never forget . 
   but you do have these places where emergency personel do n't go without a police escort , right ? 
  so if you have a criminal and a house on fire you do n't send the police together with firetrucks and ambulances in your country ? 
  ofc police escort will be needed in some situations but it does not declare an area lost . 
  how many germans does it take to change a light bulb ? 
  right answer : one , it take one german to change a light bulb . 
  i rather have stockholm syndrome then forever pay debt syndrome ( sorry bad joke ) / s, 
  by your argument such zones exist in finland or any other country too ... well it is hard to know what you define '' somewhere in the middle between a no-go zone and a normal area '' as but i am pretty sure i will succeed in being rubbed or beaten in finland too walking somewhere shady without common sense . 
  my guess is that trump was probably talking about how great and smart he is and how great he will make murica again without mention canada in a positive way just like he did with the france phone call . 
  yep i know just being funny , 
  or 2 trillion zimbabwe dollar . 
  this is why i watched was nervous haha, 
   and given permission for the intelligence agencies to break into any computer and demand backdoors to be installed for any software or online service used in the uk why the fuck would anyone operate a uk based website/app business after this ? 
  and will this backdoor spyware shit come into my pc by visiting some uk website even if i am not a uk citizen ? 
  do n't worry your loans are top aaa + quality . 
  you are not yourself when you 're hungrish grab a snicker . 
  good post i agree on being jealous towards norway thing and the siblings/ice hockey fighting . 
  i showed the youtube comments because i found it odd/funny . 
  haha the youtube comments are golden . 
  first finn : '' i just want norwegians who see this to know , finns living in finland do n't hate you . '', 
  next finn : ` im from finland and i hate norway . 
  theyre not going to give us that ** mountain ** and their population is growing faster than our , soon they will have a bigger population than finland and we will be the smallest nordic country ( iceland not included ) + they get mentioned more in tv series than finland like its already a bigger country . 
  so i prefer russia , sweden and estonia over norgay . '' edit . 
  bacon give you super cancer 2050, 
  national security in the us is saying that poland is no threat for belarus but the trump administration says so wtf is happening ? 
  is the national security also fake news and oppositions to the dear leader president now ? 
   `` our opponents , the media and the whole world will soon see as we begin to take further actions , that the powers of ** our dear leader ** to protect our country are very substantial and will not be questioned . '' maybe the only think i could think of but man so scary . 
  [ venezuela ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfone31mq7s ) and [ egypt ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgvao6zubls ), 
  im too busy eating my french fries drinking my german beer then having some swiss chocolate to piss you off right now , maybe another time ? 
  i come up with one for russia : wodka ~ ~ vodka ~ ~ comes from poland right ? 
  we could split denmark in two parts of southern sweden/northern germany , it would be very efficient in pissing off the danes . 
  what do you say my german friend ? 
  was not me that come up with it but go ahead and trademark it  let me know how it goes i believe you can do it i mean if [ king ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonykosner/2014/01/20/candy-crush-saga-has-trademarked-candy-and-apples-app-store-is-helping-enforce-it/#be16b3c16ee7 ) could trademark the word candy for the video games industry then im sure you could trademark this for your thing . 
  edit . 
  you probably could trademark it for clothes and coffee cups sounds like an good idea, 
  i like my coffee how i like my death stars : gigantic , on the dark side and powerful enough to destroy a planet . 
  you are 3 to 4 times less likely to die in a traffic related accident in countries like uk/scandinavia then in the usa btw . 
  whats wrong being the state of the sun & bath salts ? 
  [ mandatory frog dance ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqaipkgtpy4 ) at lest once a year . 
  not the brexit putin wanted . 
  whats the point on fight for his right to have babies when he ca n't have babies ? 
  i have this bad pun but nether ~ ~ land ~ ~ mind, 
  yeah i remember that , it was not fitting their agenda which is so obviously . 
  you lady boy you lady boy ? 
  lost all my respect for wikileaks when it was criticising icij for releasing the panama papers controlled and slowly ( the same strategy wikileaks have to maximise the length of media coverage of their leaks ) and wanted icij to dump it all at once because so little americans was on it . 
  what a complete disaster that website is very unprofessional very sad . 
  #fakenews / s, 
  alright bad example but there is a lot of unofficial currencies in use around the world . 
  the foreign exchange market exchange 5.3 trillion dollar a day in which gbp stands for 12.8 of 200 % pair volume . 
  technically speaking it could happen over night with a huge dip in gbp price but give it an average selling on 10year and you have a very smooth exchange that also can price in the fundamentals of scotland leaving gbp . 
  most eu citizens live in london which is competing with nyc on being a global hotspot for trade . 
  nyc and london have about 36-40 % foreign born each and both is growing 26-27 % faster then the rest of their country on average . 
  more british live abroad then most eu countries so that argument could be used to other eu nations too . 
  instead of swapping like most countries did to the euro back in 2001 people need to exchange their old currency to the new currency . 
  you are right that there is no currency to destroy but two currencies can be used at the same time ( one unofficial and one official ) for a very long time to not cause instability on the gbp exchanges . 
  so according to you the scottish are in favour of having a hard brexit instead of a soft brexit ? 
  or in favour of having an brexit at all ? 
  not sure f you understand what the single market is ? 
  movements of people along with goods and services is the single market . 
  but you have a point in that uk can have a say in reforming after all it is a democracy of member states but do n't expect demanding things your way only . 
  currently everyone but uk is happy with free movements so pick and choose to stay or leave creating your own none free market . 
  yeah but having a single market also cost money does it not ? 
  should others pay for uk 's part you mean ? 
  is that not what she want ? 
  it is in scotland 's interest that uk get a hard time in negotiations then do a u turn saying screw this .
