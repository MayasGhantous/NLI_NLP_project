it 's not . 
  maybe a small one in per capita statistics of sovereign entities , but online bragging rights is a silly reason to not do things . 
  if that 's what you wanted , almost all capitals would have an upgrade in living standards and wages if they just left the rest of the country behind . 
  in op you can see how it 'd benefit . 
  a unified nordics would have a stronger voice in global matters and it 'd create a more attractive market . 
  i 'm not saying it 's a good idea for norwegians and there are other issues one may have , but a unification would n't be any downgrade in living standards and wages . 
  the issue is with that is how it can become democratically lopsided , since i 'm assuming we 'd want to stay a democracy . 
  it would n't be the first union where there was contempt between the most powerful ( in terms of voting power ) country and others . 
  sweden would get 37 % of the votes alone , while icelanders only account for 1,3 % . 
  to get around it you could weigh the votes differently , but then you then you end up giving individual icelanders a lot more voting power and swedes notably less . 
  and by weighing votes differently you may end up with a trump situation where the most voted for alternative does n't win , which also brings contempt . 
  it 's difficult to find a good balance when the population distribution is uneven . 
  it 's not the biggest issue in forming a union , but it 's not inadmissible . 
  yeah , i was n't sure where the schleswig stuff border went . 
  and iirc shetland and orkney became scottish during the kalmar union so i do n't know if that 'd count . 
   do not think anyone considered living on svalbard this far back . 
  i mean there were settlements up there for whaling purposes pretty far back , but that started after the kalmar union in the 1600s . 
  pretty unlikely . 
  the population distribution is pretty uneven . 
  denmark , norway and finland have fairly similar population numbers , but sweden is almost twice as big and iceland less than a tenth of the three . 
  finland is n't too keen on being one with sweden again afaik , and iceland and norway literally `` broke free '' from being in unions the remaining two not * too * long ago . 
  there 's he 3-2 split on the question of eu . 
  another 3-2 split on the question of nato . 
  a third 3-2 split on forms of government . 
  our military has seen better days , ok ? 
  yes . 
  if you actually wanted the land covered by the kalmar union you 'd probably want to replace a fair share of the northern areas of sweden and finland , and svalbard with schleswig , shetland , and orkney . 
  or something . 
  i ca n't remember exactly where the borders went . 
  sure , greenland is technically an autonomous , constituent country without it , but i meant the sovereign states . 
  to me it looks bad how the left part of the horizontal bar is in a bold kufic script and the right in a much lighter thuluth . 
  it looks odd . 
  i mean , i get they copy-pasted the parts from the saudi and iranian flags respectively , but it 'd look so much better if both sides had the same calligraphy or were at least somewhat similar weight . 
  iirc it was made to make fun of t_d . 
   scotland is still represented by the white `` x '' or saltire is still on the flag representing scotland it 's not . 
  those are just fimbriations you need in heraldry and vexillology to abide the rule of tincture . 
  it 's what most of the white stuff on the union flag is and it 's why there 's white on the outside of st. patrick 's saltire too . 
  [ all the yellow here are fimbrations ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rgvnmle.png ) , st. andrew 's cross is just the white part . 
  the flag in op is n't asymmetrical as the current one as st. andrew 's cross is gone . 
  scandinavian cross = nordic cross . 
  they 're synonyms . 
  its use spread from scandinavia -- hence scandinavian . 
  it 's used across the nordics -- hence nordic . 
  both are right . 
  `` nordic '' is generally preferred as the non-scandinavian nordic countries also have it , but that does n't make it `` not scandinavian '' . 
  it is also called a scandinavian cross , so you would n't have been wrong even if you had said that . 
  but nordic is used more nowadays since the non-scandinavian nordic countries also have it . 
  oh , i thought you meant that you wrote it in english , so yes . 
  but how are you writing * `` how do i '' * in swedish ... ? 
  but yeah , google does n't just customize result based on the country level . 
  a lot of stuff affects your number one , that 's not `` the first one for sweden '' . 
  when i tried it in a private window i got `` how do i live '' , which makes sense as according to google trends it 's ranked 2nd worldwide on related queries to `` how do i '' . 
  but yes , this is with 99 % certainty utter bullshit . 
  yeah ... 
  pretty sure it 's utter bullshit , nothing about making friends is anywhere on the list of related queries on google trends for sweden . 
  even if you tried to do it properly i do n't really understand how you 'd even compile this . 
  either you do it in english in all countries , which wo n't really give good results for natives of most countries , or differences in language are going to come in the way to be accurate . 
  you ca n't say `` how do i [ verb ] ... '' in swedish for example , you say `` how [ verb ] i. . . '' , which is n't as limited . 
   the rule for a region to be included , is that the country is in europe , it has an iso 3166 code , it has an actual flag ( not a coat of arms ) and somebody has requested it . 
  does that mean we can get the flags of the swedish counties ? 
  i mean , in a perfect world i 'd prefer the elongated variant that is n't so square , but i assume you 're going by what 's on paper with stuff like that . 
  well , to be honest , in a perfect world i 'd want the [ flag of sm\u00e5land ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/flag_of_sm%c3%a5land.svg/640px-flag_of_sm%c3%a5land.svg.png ) but that 's both unofficial and not of a administrative region , so i assume that 's already off the table . 
  but for that lion : - sweden 's undoubtedly in europe . 
  - [ iso code ] ( https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:code:3166:se ) for kronoberg is ` se-g ` / ` se-07 ` . 
  - it 's the officially declared flag . 
  - i am hereby requesting it . 
   castrate the floppy dick that is sweden russia did that in 1809, 
  the swedish selection contest , * melodifestivalen * , is larger than * esc * in sweden by numbers of viewers . 
  it is the more important contest of the two here . 
  that 's true , i am wooshing pretty hard on where the humor is . 
  for the record i still am , i do n't get it . 
  but i must admit my reply has more to do with it amusing me to respond to moronic shit with needlessly exhaustive replies . 
  it 's a character flaw . 
   probably wrote the last names wrong . 
  skarsg\u00e5rd has an * \u00e5 * . 
  but ... if required for international purposes the * \u00e5 * would typically be replaced with an * a * . 
  i ca n't quite merit you an a , but i 'll give you a b. , 
  0.08779 % of men are called mohamed in sweden . 
  0.35 % if you include all spelling variations . 
  it 's not in the top 50 . 
  if you 're interested in common men 's names in sweden , the top 10 ( incl . 
  spelling variations ) are in order : * karl , erik , lars , anders , per , mikael , johan , olof , nils * , and * jan * .

   kanken do you mean k\u00e5nken , as in the backpack ? 
  is that well known in poland ? 
   ( napoleon times and so on ) yeah , jean-baptiste was a marshal of france under napoleon . 
  the two had a pretty turbulent relationship . 
  if you look close you 'll find napoleon 's imperial eagle on the coat of arms of sweden . 
  i swear i stared at it forever trying to place it , but could n't come up with anything . 
  sounded like an ngo or charity or something . 
  thought it was weird that i 'd never even heard of it if it was that well-known in bulgaria ... 
  i 'm dumb . 
  haha, 
  what 's idea ? 
  sweden did n't invent finland . 
  when that area was swedish , it was simply the eastern part of the sweden proper , a part like any other . 
  the only `` finland '' we had was the eponymous province in the southwest . 
  the thing we now call finland came to be when the russians conquered * \u00d6sterland * and part of * norrland * . 
  that sure was n't a swedish choice . 
  finland sprung to existence after the russians chopped sweden in half and the finns eventually made it theirs .
