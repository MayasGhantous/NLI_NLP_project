[ #soon ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_coffee_consumption_per_capita ), 
  a bit eerie to see , mikael is the father of one of my childhood friends . 
  there was a lot of ruckus about the accident in school . 
  then no , it 's divided based on the % of votes they got . 
  any party that did n't get 4 % will be left out/wasted . 
  so the % is a little higher than the actual votes because the seats that would be `` wasted '' due to insufficent votes are divided between the rest of the parties . 
  i find it disgusting that 17 % of the eligble voters wasted their right . 
  it 's a stain on our democracy , they could 've atleast done a blank vote to show discontent . 
  minister posts ? 
  it 's the statsminister 's to give out minister posts as ( s ) he fits . 
  most will be given to the socialdemocrats , but some might be handed out to mp/v after negotiations . 
  not quite right . 
  s vows to do anything in it 's power to form a strong government and `` reach out a hand towards other parties '' . 
  they also vow to not give sd any power . 
  it should also be said that sweden have had a minority government many times before with s as leader . 
  nazi/facist ? 
  no , that 'd be if you voted for svenskarnas parti . 
  lots of people call sd voters racist . 
  but it 's starting to shift towards `` you 're voting for racists '' ( as opposed to `` you 're racist '' and that 's what i think will be the thing moving forward . 
  that would never happen . 
  he would lose face with every single ( m ) voter . 
  [ the one on the right is a newer model . 
  ] ( http://www.skimaskcity.com/black-ski-mask/ ) they 're very good in cold winds and keep your cheeks from falling off . 
  to me it just looks like standard-issue skimasks ? 
  nice work !, 
  they 're very well trained and do n't get scared of gun shots etc. 
  many see it as animal abuse because the training is quite tough on the horses . 
  [ scb - the statistical central bureau ] ( http://www.scb.se/en_/ ) have all the info available for the public . 
  there are articles like [ this ] ( http://www.scb.se/sv_/hitta-statistik/statistik-efter-amne/miljo/markanvandning/tatorter-arealer-befolkning/12994/13001/behallare-for-press/tatorter-2010-arealer-befolkning-korrigerat-2011-06-20/ ) and [ this ] ( http://www.scb.se/sv_/hitta-statistik/artiklar/enslighetens-geografi/ ) and much more . 
  why sweden shows up as `` not available '' is very odd indeed , because all the info is right there . 
  even a similar [ image ] ( http://www.scb.se/grupp/artiklar/valfard-4-2012/enslighetens-geografi/storre-delen-av-landet-ar-glest-befolkat.png ) is found in one of the articles . 
  we call it `` hets mot folkgrupp '' , which translates to something like `` incitement against ethnic group '' . 
  the law ( s ) have always used `` hets mot folkgrupp '' as the crime , now the actual law will just not mention race . 
  but it will mention religion , ethnicity and what not . 
  occupation is this month 's hot subject . 
  the flag is for [ turkish republic of northern cyprus ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_northern_cyprus ) . 
  more on the [ subject ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_invasion_of_cyprus ), 
  nothing about how the extreme-right gets 10 % ? 
  really ? 
  i have a card at fitness 24 seven . 
  they are more numerous than member24 and iirc they had options for foreign bank accounts . 
  though you might need a swedish id . 
  i 've hosted 3 people over 40 , 
  we love ourselves . 
  * e : / s, 
  sverigedemokraterna is certainly strongly tied to nationalism in my opinion . 
  it 's what they call themselves . 
   '' ... in light of this sverigedemokraterna views the nationalism as a natural part of conservatism and a central part of the party 's politics . 
  i think `` hen '' is a good addition to the swedish language . 
  but those two just sound nuts , it 's people like them who give the word a bad rep imo . 
  well , you got proof ? 
  we put them in rural areas where noone will find them . 
  yes . 
  we love speaking english , you covered your bases well . 
  it is . 
  most of the pictures seemed to be from stockholm or smaller towns . 
  you 'd find most immigrants in the suburbs , which is n't well represented in the album . 
  still , i 'd say 9 of the pictures have non-swedes in them . 
  being from stockholm i feel it does a lot of the everyday life justice , even though 33 pictures is n't nearly enough . 
  this is fairly common in smaller towns or in rural areas , not so much in the bigger cities . 
  sadly many of these people have nationalist and/or racist tendencies . 
  sverigedemokraterna ( nationalist party ) have been on the rise lately with ~ 5 % in the last election . 
  very common in sweden aswell , just not as common as in copenhagen/netherlands . 
  did n't know that , thanks for the info . 
  this , however , does n't make it right . 
  i 've never had much love for the us anyway , quite the contrary and this certainly wo n't help . 
  true , but we 're still talking about ethnic cleansing and mass murder . 
  there was n't consent for unprotected sex , no . 
  well , yes . 
  in the assange case , even though there is a lot unknown , the thing the he 's accused for is having unprotected sex . 
  the woman had ( allegedly ) stated that sex would only proceed if he used protection , he proceeded anyway . 
  thus in sweden : rape . 
  we also have record of being more strict about what you would call phys/sexual harrasment . 
  yeah , we have one of the highest rapes per capita or whatever you would call it . 
  but we also have a really high ( speculated since you can \u00b4 t really know ) report rate . 
  we also count a lot more things as rape than most other countries . 
  surstr\u00f6mming , tasty and putrid . 
  in actual communism there isn \u00b4 t a state . 
  marx wanted to disolve the state , it was merely a necessary evil until everything was set in place . 
  when a state is in what you would call a communism era the next step would be to disolve the state and achieve true communism , corruption prevents that . 
  there is a lot of english on the swedish radio , almost all songs actually . 
  but that 's because most swedish artists sing in english . 
  i 'd say it 's about 50/50 foreign/local . 
  could 've been worded better , but i \u00b4 m not a native speaker . 
  what i mean is that it 's a massive amount of `` important '' history behind the european states . 
  i.e the areas behind the states where they originate from have a lot of very `` important '' history . 
  speaking out of a eurocentric perspective . 
  i would 've thought more knew sweden tbh . 
  it is a huge stretch . 
  european states have long history . 
  most have been great powers and many wars have been fought between them . 
  american states does n't matter when it comes to history , there is no need to learn them and you never `` pick it up '' in your studies . 
  have seen it happen in sweden . 
  not sure how common it is . 
  i 've always liked the british flag . 
  also like the croatian , albanian and of course the glorious swedish one . 
  yeah , because we 're hot . 
  there is a major difference between mexican and texmex food . 
  atleast in sweden it 's also a old swedish surname . 
  do n't know the why you got downvoted because it 's true .
