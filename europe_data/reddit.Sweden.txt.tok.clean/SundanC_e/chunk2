  we write time in the same way . 
  we both use [ iso 8601 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iso_8601 ) . 
  even though it 's different versions the time stuff is the same . 
  prague is so nice . 
  but sadly all the scribble on the walls ruins the feel in my opinion , there seems to be no actions from the authorities to clean it away . 
  i personally prefer stockholm , copenhagen or berlin . 
  very esthetically pleasing and beautiful architecture . 
  and in contrast to prague there is beautiful street art to be found in place of the scribbled tags . 
  it 's not for the park in and of itself . 
  it 's about the corrupt government , and this was the last drop . 
  yeah , haven \u00b4 t seen a single article on reddit that was n't completely off . 
  a handful comments is all there is . 
  thanks , my google skills failed me . 
  you \u00b4 re wrong . 
  deny many to come in to sweden , and to send some home . 
  basically . 
  iit : people not from sweden trying to explain the situation and failing . 
  it really is n't as bad as media is showing , far from . 
  it \u00b4 s all relative . 
  the socio-economic state is horrible in several of the suburbs in sweden . 
  just because it \u00b4 s worse in other western countries does n't mean they 're not suffering . 
  really ? 
  any pictures or media ? 
  this is the first time within customs ( tullarna ) ? 
  dat joke , so good . 
  but you \u00b4 re wrong . 
  if anything it \u00b4 d be canada and maybe sweden , finland , czech and russia to contend them . 
  still you continue to say otherwise even after people come at you with facts . 
  uk higher than scandinavian countries ? 
  smells like a / r/conspiracy !, 
  all the `` scenic '' stuff is more inland in sweden , closer to the norweigan border . 
  you \u00b4 re really clueless , almost every single thing in your original post is either missspelled or false . 
  do you mind linking anything that explores the causation ? 
  * why * are they overly represented ? 
  the 2005 study of br\u00c5 ( the council of crime prevention ) concludes that immigrants are 2,5 times more likely than ethnic swedes to commit crimes . 
  but they also mention that people who have at anytime been dependent on state hand-outs are 6,1 times more likely to commit crimes regardless of ethnicity . 
  further , people without high-school education are 5,7 times more likely to commit crimes . 
  we need to help people integrate better and to not let people in need slip through the safety nets in place . 
  we need to validate people 's education from more foreign universities ( iran have some of the greatest doctors in the world , in sweden they have to drive taxi or clean toilets ) and we need to keep more kids in school . 
  here is a [ link with article and references ] ( http://www.migrationsinfo.se/valfard/kriminalitet/ ) , i will disable notifications since most likely i will be hated on by some hate-brigade as usual in this sub . 
  [ the report does not mention it ] ( https://polisen.se/global/www%20och%20intrapolis/rapporter-utredningar/01%20polisen%20nationellt/ovriga%20rapporter-utredningar/kriminella%20natverk%20med%20stor%20paverkan%20i%20lokalsamhallet%20sekretesspr%2014.pdf ) , infact maybe you should read it . 
  [ here is the thread with outtakes  ( https://www.reddit.com/r/sweden/comments/2kphqz/55_no_gozoner_i_sverige/ )  `` bodde d\u00e4r f\u00f6r inte s\u00e5 l\u00e4nge sen. den h\u00e4r ledaren \u00f6verdriver lite . 
  i 'm fully aware that organized crime exists in certain suburbs , my own included , but you do n't see it as a civilian and it 's not dangerous for the police . 
  i believe we must have a look at what creates these situations where people from low socio-economic areas are forced into crime . 
  and bear in mind that even though it 's a immigrant-dense area , most organized crime is headed by people from sweden and balkan ( who came here in the 90s ) , not from the middle-east . 
  been there , only place you could find sriracha before it was common . 
  far from a ghetto . 
  you should visit the outskirts of paris or a favella , that 's [ ghetto ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slum ) . 
  i 'm serious and i do n't live under a rock , i live in alby - stockholm . 
  one of the areas mentioned in the article , it is a very nice and quiet place to live . 
  everyone you meet are friendly , i ca n't take that article seriously . 
  the ~ ~ article ~ ~ editorial ( you need to know what difference that is ) mentions that the police do * not * call it a `` no-go '' zone . 
  one journalist personally calls it that . 
  when this article surfaced in / r/sweden it was dismissed as sensational and should be now aswell . 
  til we have ghettos in sweden . 
  thanks . 
  it is deemed unfit because of the high mercury levels , not for taste . 
  if you read the wiki article throughly you will know a few things : * they are considered in need of help from international agreements to ensure growth . 
  * they have been deemed unfit for human consumption since 2008 . 
  thus making any hunting of them odd and unjustified . 
  * the population counts are made hard because of their short-finned relatives who are far more numerous . 
  the count of 780.000 specimen in the north atlantic includes both variants . 
  * since it have been hard to reliably count the population they are deemed to be in a decline . 
  there are homeless and beggars of swedish descent/citizenships aswell . 
  they 're not all that many and are far out-numbered by the romani , but they do exist . 
  the gist of it is about morals . 
  `` no one should ever be criminalized for asking for help * in a tough situation for any reason '' . 
  it 's largely considered a human right . 
  this is what i 've gathered from politicians and seminars , to me it makes a lot of sense . 
  but it does create problematic scenarios , such as the one we 're facing right now . 
  many of the philosophic cross-roads in sweden comes from this line of thinking . 
  the swedish political climate and way of thinking is very much influenced by it 's social democratic history . 
  basically no one should be denied help in any situation and the problems that might arise is considered an okay price to pay . 
  a large part of the swedish people are clearly tired of paying this price and something will likely change but what direction sweden will go is still unclear . 
  \\* for example begging edit : [ here g\u00f6ran lambertz , supreme court judge , talk about begging and human rights ] ( http://www.cd-n.org/index.php?begging-human-rights-and-international-law ), 
  so funny seeing the `` greece '' flair on some of the most ignorant and passive aggresive comments in here . 
  biker gangs have been blowing shit up since way before we started with high amounts of immigration . 
  still waiting eagerly for you to source a single comment you 've been typing out , 
  luckily we have laws regulating such things . 
  first of all i 'm actually telling you i 'm centric ( liberal ) but leaning to the left . 
  second of all calling social democracy `` extreme left '' just displays your ignorance . 
  most adults coming from places like iran and syria are actually highly skilled in their field and more educated than their swedish counterparts . 
  but due to stupid bureaucracy their education is invalid and we put them to work as cleaners and taxidrivers instead . 
  this is what i 'm talking about . 
  we need to fix the segregation problem , not reduce immigration . 
  reducing immigration does nothing . 
  very likely , you 're simply taking it one step further back than my very simple answer . 
  thanks for the recommendation and some of the few comments in this thread that are n't ignorant non-sense . 
  i 'm watching the international at the moment but i 'd be happy to watch the video and breakdown your nonsense ( again ) tommorow . 
  i do however have to comment on this one thing . 
  even though sweden is very secular it 's still very christian . 
  our whole law-system is based upon christian beliefs and most importantly forgiveness . 
  all our holidays aswell . 
  there 's also more actively believing christians in sweden than you might think . 
  you 're delusional and probably young , try to get some meat on your bones before you spew more non-sense . 
  as always ... correlation does not imply causation . 
  everytime the surveys are analyzed people are happy to neglect that many immigrants are in bad socio-economic situations . 
  also as most swedes ( yours truely included ) and swedish parties agree there are problems with segregation in sweden , but stopping immigration does n't remove those issues and those who will arrive later will still be segregated . 
  every party except the nationalistic one want to solve the causation and not the correlation . 
  you can read a lot about different possible correlations [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/statistical_correlations_of_criminal_behaviour ) and then following the sources .
