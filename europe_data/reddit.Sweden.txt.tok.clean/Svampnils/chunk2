  ofc , i was simply adding to the discussion . 
  it wasnt meant to discredit you . 
  that was pretty much the biggest reasoning among politicians in sweden at that time , that and humanitarian reasons . 
  nobody seems to have known that much of the worlds education isnt recognized in sweden , thus they wont be able to get jobs or be eligible for university . 
   dutch brance of the akp in parliament do you have more information about this ? 
  sounds worrying . 
  stop it , just stop . 
  we get it , you dont like the social democrats in sweden . 
  but stop linking stuff that has nothing to do with your claim that she 's an anti-semite . 
  `` she has sold out our values '' , give me a break . 
  yes , we should not be meddling in affairs that will never change , it 's just idiotic . 
   that 's nonsense . 
  it has a bias , but it 's not any worse than the swedish media . 
  soo . . not nonsense . 
  both countries media have a bias . 
   he also did the impossible to satisfy my curiosity , what was thought to be impossible ? 
  haha omg . . this could be true . 
  in this day and age nothing would surprise me anymore . 
  also ; this whole brexit thing might actually start to make sense . 
  probably the trickle down part . 
   because with less restrictions the risk for the landlord goes down . 
  he can kick someone out easier so he may be fine with getting a lower rent ,  in your case with employment contract the cost for the employee and risk goes down so he will hire more people . 
  its ok , what i dont find to be worth knowing , i tend to forget . 
  like religion and stuff like that . 
  this time my curiosity got the better of me :d, 
  one for any given moment :d, 
  raw eggs and stay single !, 
  in my experience , yes . 
  i wasnt sure at first if they were elected for life , then i googled . 
  the older they are the shorter the time to be popes are , right ? 
  you have to be in europe to see us !, 
  otherwise we simply blend in with the crowd and you will tore your hair out trying to find us . 
  they can negotiate trade deals with a third country if they follow efta framework , meaning ; they can make trade deals with countries outside eu ** if they follow eu rules ** ( efta ) . 
  yes , but what does that have to do with `` the brexit effect '' ? 
  demand is demand . 
  unless uk citizens rush to the store before the uncertainty of brexit happens and possible price increases . 
  i did n't say they were good , i said what their role was . 
   and iran ? 
  how about russia ? 
  those players are there to cancel out stupidity across the war torn middle east . 
  i get to see daylight during weekends , which is nice . 
  oh i agree . 
  we should just stop using the term here in europe , or simply call it `` regressive politics '' . 
  thing is , it 's not exclusive to the left in sweden . 
  sounds a lot like sweden ... . . but also less . 
  some of our politicians also want to hand them jobs and place them first in housing queues . 
  populist . . yeah that too . 
  no immigration at all is as extrem as full-on-open-borders-immigration . 
  extreme , meaning at the absolut end of a scale/spectrum or whatever word you choose to go with . 
  why me ? 
  the migration board does that . 
  in this case , since both pakistan an the uk are considered safe countries by the swedish government , people from either country would be immigrants . 
   because sweden ca n't get enough pakistani refugees . 
  funny , considering we take in more brits than pakistanis , 
  how can swedens asylum policy and the similarities that you find between pakistan and the uk be funny ? 
  okej , never mind . 
  pakistan is basically like the uk , i see that now . 
  are you seriously comparing semi-integrated countries and allies in europe to countries like pakistan and india that are 5 minutes away from war with each other ? 
  or japan and china who have never been cooperative or in an economic union with each other and have large territorial disputes ? 
  neither would ours . 
  none that i can hear at least . 
  perhaps not . 
  yet , nigel and ukip have been vocal about europeans entering the uk , taking jobs that locals should have . 
  i 'm not usually one to tell others whats extreme or not , but not even wanting your neighbours to immigrate is pretty extreme to me . 
  edit : usually edit2 : can the downvoters please explain how it isnt an extrem stance on immigration when you want to close the borders for ** everyone ** that wants to immigrate ? 
  i feel like russia must have some sort of ` flying teachers ' or home schooling via radio and such , like they do in australia . 
  better have a cold toilet seat than non at all , like in france for me this summer , 10/10 public toilets had no toilet seat . 
  is it like this generally in france or did i have the greatest misfortune of all ? 
  i 'm not certain of this , but i believe this started on the internet . 
  i for one would like to read that folklore if it existed . 
   so ... things can and do change sometimes . 
   in europe perhaps . 
  not in america . 
  they are to set in their ways to change :(, 
   strange results considering that sweden does punch above its weight in eu foreign policy . 
  you just answered your own confusion . 
  why would we want to lower ourselfes to a common eu policy , that we know would be below our own ? 
  yes , and while they think it over they get put in a cozy prison , much better than the calais camp , with hot food and a bed . 
  and now they will never tell you . 
  this problem needs to be dealt with long before it reaches europe . 
  i never thought i was going to type this , but here we are , knee deep in trouble . 
  oh , i 'm not proud that sweden invaded and killed people in other countries , hence the '' ? '', 
  after ` ouch ' . 
  a more interesting question would be ; what kind of hardware , from what country do we use ? 
  funding would most likely be controlled by the eu , paid by all . 
  ouch ? 
  we meassure it in how far we can see ... , 
  it can be hell regardless of latitud . 
  northern v\u00e4stmanland , which arguably has it the worst in all of sweden , is located in the southern part of the country . 
  alternative facts really is a thing in america !, 
  nostalgia , my friend . 
  wtf is wrong with you , britain ? 
  no wonder your people are divided , propaganda wherever you look . 
   i see communes which to me looks like 80-90 % of the area is yellow but when i hover over them it 's still  50 % macron that 's because you correlate land area with population numbers . 
  edit : besides . 
  ''  50 % macron '' means that something else is of a bigger portion than `` 50 % macron '' , and therefore the color yellow would be accurate . 
  he 's are not comparing it with fn . 
  he 's comparing it with crazy . 
  nothing of what you posted has anything to do with limitations on `` freedom of the press '', 
  what 's not bad as being as bad as italy ?
