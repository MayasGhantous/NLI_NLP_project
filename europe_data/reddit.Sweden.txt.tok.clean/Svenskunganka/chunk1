i feel like we would see the majority of eu members ramping up their military spending quite drastically if the us would leave nato .

  thank you france for sticking up for the rest of us euros when our own governments are being retarded . 
  lots of love from sweden, 
   but even more astounding is that you think you are entitled to goods and services produced in the usa for free . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  when did i ever say i think i am entitled to `` goods and services produced in the usa for free '' ? 
  i 've got a netflix premium subscription plan , but when your dear hollywood applies shitty geo-restriction and geo-blocking practices for individual shows/movies , i start torrenting them . 
  i 'm still paying for the content , i 'm just not standing for your country 's fucked up reasoning about restricting me just because i 'm not a us citizen . 
  and you should be happy that i am one of those paying customers , since i am contributing to the health of * your * economy . 
  the problem is that hollywood wants to be on the european market , but expects europeans to stand for their reasoning about restricting access to content for non-us citizens . 
  either you 're in the market , or you 're out . 
  simple as that . 
  we 're also having a eu vote soon to ban geo-restriction and geo-blocking for media entertainment , and it may very well happen that hollywood-based producers are getting banned from the european entertainment market ( if they keep up with their geo-restriction and geo-blocking practices ) , which is drastically going to hurt the us economy . 
  you do n't see the swedish-invented spotify platform restricting access to their music library to you just because you 're not a swedish citizen , do you ? 
  i 'm going off at the us laws and how they handle these kind of cases , not you personally . 
  i apologize if i came off as doing that . 
  but that 's the problem really , those are * your laws * , not ours . 
  the only thing that the us should be able to do is to take down those servers , collaborate with ukraine ; e.g handing over information to help the ukrainian government arrest and prosecute the individual in question . 
  but the us should not be able to steal the individual , prosecute him in the us and put the guy in a us prison ( if it comes to that ) . 
  this is outrageous . 
  it 's really like non-us citizens are treated as second class citizens in the world . 
  there 's never been a case where a us citizen has been extradicted , prosecuted and put in prison in another country . 
  surfing counts as exercise , yes . 
  savage, 
  i do n't know if you 've seen the show , but brother & sister lannister practice incest and has kids with eachother . 
  i do n't think you actually mean that ... 
  with the danes ? 
  over my dead body !, 
  ah , nothing like the cries of a salty finn , except for the cries of a salty dane . 
  how can you call our taxes inhumane when the people living in scandinavia has been reported to be both [ happier & healthier ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_happiness_report#2016_ranking.5b4.5d ) than the rest of the world ? 
  if anything , that should be proof that our system is the most humane there currently is , but of course there is room for improvement , there always is . 
  i do n't believe in that . 
  everyone should have the right to privacy , even during work hours . 
  surely background checks on politicians should be a requirement , but round-the-clock surveillance * just because * they are politicians is not ok . 
  there are other ways to go about handling corruption that is way more effective . 
  holy shit . 
  looks like it 's going to break apart and implode any minute . 
  is that the worst case or is it average ? 
  / r/dota2 is leaking again, 
  i disagree with your view that europe has always lacked innovation in the tech field . 
  i 'll take my own country as an example , which at the time these companies were started had around an 8 million population . 
  skype , spotify and mojang ( minecraft ) are 3 pretty good examples , two of which were bought by microsoft . 
  king ( candy crush & other mobile games ) , dice ( battlefield-series ) and paradox ( lots of popular games ) are other successful examples . 
  then there 's also linux , ( linus tovalds is finno-swedish ) which powers pretty much the entire internet and has led to our awesome open-source culture that we share . 
  to say europe `` has n't got off the starting line to begin with '' is not very true if you look at it . 
  i think there are lots of innovation in the tech field in europe , maybe not as much as in the us , but it definitely is there . 
  a big problem we have is that european tech companies either ca n't or wo n't compete with us salaries , which naturally leads to europe losing its top talent . 
  that is a problem we have to address if we want to grow our economy alongside the us in this era of technology . 
  do n't get me wrong , i 'm not saying `` the us is bad '' like this sub so often does say . 
  rather , i think the exact opposite - i love that the us & the eu has had a close relationship the last few decades , and that we 're able to connect with you guys across the pond , especially in the tech field since that 's my line of work . 
  a big reason the us is home to big tech companies is beacuse they have what i call a `` bird 's view '' over the european ( and american of course ) tech startups . 
  the same minute a european tech startup grows even the slightest bit more popular , the giants like google , facebook , etc - * will know * . 
  often times buying the startup and the individual talent with it , even if it 's just a competitor . 
  how ? 
  well , google and facebook knows because they track the browsing habits and history of people . 
  last week , 20,000 people used `` european startup x '' . 
  this week , 200,000 people use it . 
  there was a very detailed comment about this with lots of examples on another sub a few months back , i 'll see if i can find it . 
   you can not seriously believe that only europe does subcontracting and outsourcing . 
  he never said that , and how does it matter for europe what other regions do ? 
  we should focus on ourselves , not `` look , canada does it , so it 's ok if we do too '' . 
   how 's that relevant ? 
  has a a tech talent ever said darn i wan na go to europe but the refugee thing ... meh , guess i 'll skip . 
  that 's not how i interpreted it , and i think he meant that the migrants overall does not have the education or skills to fill a tech position . 
  imagine coming in at work and the boss goes * `` where the fuck have you been ? 
  '' * , and your glorious response * `` i was taking a piss '' * . 
  unfortunately i do n't have a playlist dedicated to metal , since i listen to a wide range of music types . 
  i have one big , fat ( ~ 800 tracks or so ) playlist with pretty much everything from metal , pop , emo , electronic and some good ` ol 80 's & 90 's tracks . 
  you can find it here : https://open.spotify.com/user/svenskung/playlist/3ocn8iygqobjv9dyqoskub, 
  let me recommend you sonic syndicate if you like in flames . 
  at least their first two albums , only inhuman and eden fire , since they 've now gotten a complete member change and seems to be doing pop-like music . 
  the original members formed a new band called the unguided which is pretty good as well !, 
  hey , you 're the ones that has swedish people 's party . 
  we 're already in your government , so all your base are belong to us . 
  spotify is swedish at least, 
  zero rating is a slippery slope . 
  it goes against a competing market and creates a monopoly for the already established services like spotify , making it extremely hard for other companies to even try to compete . 
  and as we all know , competition is good for the consumers . 
  lastly , these x amount of gb per month plans are also * extremely bad * for innovation and competition . 
  they discourage carriers to innovate to create the highest quality , fastest and most reliable network among its competitors . 
  instead they just put an artificial limit and pretty much call it a day . 
  nobody today looks at how good the network of their carrier actually is ( bandwidth throughput ( mbit/sec ) , latencies and packet routing ) , and instead looks at the artificial limit that is how many gb/month they can use before they 're being throttled .

  well we have the [ cheese slicer ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/osthyvel_20050723_001.jpg/220px-osthyvel_20050723_001.jpg ) which is fairly common throughout europe , but not in the us . 
  as for mobile apps , we have something called [ swish ] ( https://www.getswish.se/ ) which you can use to transfer money to other people between banks , and have them process immediately . 
  you connect your phone number to your bank account , and then your friend can pay half the tab by just selecting you in their phone book as the recipient , input the amount and send it , and it should transfer immediately . 
  normal inter-bank transfers usually takes a day to process , which swish solves very conveniently . 
  it 's also completely free . 
  i do n't think sweden has any limit on how much wattage you can use , at least not a limit set by the government ( our main power company is partially government owned ) . 
  there may be a limit for certain industrial business that 's negotiated between the business and the power company of choice , but nothing that affects typical households - but then again , i 'm not sure and i could n't find any information about it online . 
  my electricity has never been cut off due to overconsumption though .
