  is it pepper spray ? 
   q : can pepper spray be orange ? 
   a : concentrated pepper sprays will look orange or even red . 
  weaker sprays will have a yellow or orange-yellow color . 
  the coloring comes from the pepper particles . 
  the finer they are ground , the more surface area is exposed - and theoretically , the more oil is released . 
  actually the video is from a dutch tv show . 
  from the linked article : `` an audience member offered him some milk she had expressed but host paul de leeuw told her he would rather take it from its source and suckled both her breasts on live tv . 
  a huge social media row followed quickly , although the network did point out that the act had not been sexual . '', 
  sure , sounds perfectly normal for the host to do it on live tv .

  how does it compare to the previous eu parliament elections ? 
  why does n't this and other embedded vimeo videos work with flashblock enabled in chrome ( ium ) . 
  it is a pain in the ass . 
  and the video can not be played on the vimeo site either : http://player.vimeo.com/video/67060555, 
  being a part of the european economic area ( eea ) has implications on the norwegian legislations despite not being an eu member . 
  and that without representation in the european parliament and the european commission . 
  do you like being a `` fax democracy '' ? 
  it is not free . 
  you pay with paypal , the same amount as with other methods . 
  all five nordic countries are qualified for the finals , nice . 
  summary from the document :  russia  institutional discrimination against lgbti people and the social climate remains of serious  concern . 
  the most worrying development was the spread of laws banning ` homosexual  propaganda ' which were adopted in six more regions and a similar proposal was launched  at the federal level . 
  these laws were strongly condemned by european institutions and  found to breach the international covenant on civil and political rights by the un 's human  rights committee . 
  you do n't see that kind of road marking in sweden . 
  it should have been a double solid line in the middle of the road instead of a single line in this case . 
  black death , or the more recent [ famine of 1866 -- 68 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/famine_of_1866%e2%80%9368 ), 
  i would add north europe as well . 
  i speak the language of \u00c5land , finland ( which happens to be swedish ) 100 % fluently . 
  and i have a harder time with some dialects in sweden than standard norwegian . 
  not the first time , norway did it last year ( for a limited period ) . 
  [ anni-frid lyngstad ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anni-frid_lyngstad ) who was a member of abba was born in norway . 
  [ queen silvia of sweden ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/queen_silvia_of_sweden ) was born in germany . 
  [ markoolio ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/markoolio ) was born in finland . 
  i know his wood chopping book has sold many copies in norway and sweden . 
  it 's even translated into english : http://www.amazon.com/norwegian-wood-chopping-stacking-scandinavian/dp/1419717987/, 
  thanks, 
  the following video clip is from the jeremy kyle show mentioned in the image link , but are they speaking english ? 
  it 's not enough to be the largest party if a majority of the parliament is against them . 
  they need 51 % of the votes to really win . 
  yes polls have in the past often showed lower sd support than the actual election result . 
  sentio has been closest and in their recent poll sd became the third largest party at 22.1 % . 
  the hand grenades do n't grow on trees , but are added as a bonus in other weapon deals in serbia according to gunnar appelgren , head of the reconnaissance section of the regional investigation unit in stockholm . 
  serbia is n't part of schengen , which means the weapons need to cross the schengen border . 
  and dark in the winter , and on the map . 
  alcohol advertisements are allowed in papers and magazines in sweden and have been for ten years but only ads for beverages with less than 15 % abv . 
  the swedish is alplandskap i ( alpine landscape i ) by august strindberg ( 1894 ) . 
  banking in the modern sense in fact originated from italy . 
  and the oldest bank still in existence is [ monte dei paschi di siena ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/banca_monte_dei_paschi_di_siena ) established 1472 , headquartered in siena , italy . 
  which means the bank was founded 20 years before christopher columbus discovered america !, 
  what do welsh people think when their country is painted with the english painting ? 
  dalecarlian to be more precise according to the description : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dalecarlian, 
  `` d '' is n't a big problem , but i hate when people write m ( milli ) when they mean m ( mega ) . 
  it 's `` dl '' not `` dl '' . 
  prefixes less than one are all written in lower case . 
  i think dl , cl and ml all have their uses . 
   and when we speak german we say ja and nein . 
  and `` doch '' . 
  swedish has a three-form system : ja , jo , nej https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yes_and_no, 
  it was meant to be an answer to the question . 
  i updated the post to clarify that . 
  i 'll tolerate fahrenheit today since it 's the independence day . 
  it 's around 300 kelvin . 
  ( 27 degrees c ) edit : where i live , in sweden . 
  1050 ron is 234 eur , or 107 big macs ( http://www.romania-insider.com/the-big-max-index-how-many-burgers-can-a-romanian-afford/140948/ ), 
  a coach maybe ? 
  people living in sweden are n't required to own any passport or id . 
  but one is required to use many services . 
  you do n't need to carry an id as swedish resident , but if you are the suspect of a crime then the police may lock you in until your identity is established . 
  wikipedia has an lengthy page about different countries https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/identity_document, 
  [ max hamburgers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/max_hamburgers ) and [ sibylla ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sibylla_%28fast_food%29 ) are two of the largest . 
  max is the oldest hamburger chain in sweden . 
  their first restaurant opened in 1968 . 
   e : nevermind , just googled it that 's nice of you . 
  i think celebrating name days are still quite popular in sweden . 
  it must be one remnant from when sweden were catholic then . 
  ( the protestant reformation in sweden is generally regarded as having begun in 1527 during the reign of king gustav i of sweden . ), 
  or saying `` your swedish is really good '' to a finland swede ? 
  ( of course it is , swedish is their mother tongue . ), 
  does n't look that way since some people bring middle east conflict ( s ) with them when they migrate . 
   they still get free trade which there are some exceptions , most notable food . 
  yes , explicitly illegal since mars 15 1979 . 
  and explicitly allowed until 1966 . 
  i 'm unsure about 1967-1978 . 
  let 's see if anybody can match tage erlander which served as pm of sweden for 23 years ( 1946 to 1969 ) . 
  where are iceland and the faroe islands ? 
  it 's bigger than that . 
  seams to handle mostly about the eu and not the whole europe as the title suggests ? 
  a chain is n't stronger than its weakest link . 
  ( not answering the question . ), 
  people with lower iq are more likely to be racist , people with lower education are more likely to be rasist ... 
  cult as in a `` particular system of religious belief '' ? 
  in the netherlands , they used another image , and i ca n't say if it 's a gay or heterosexual couple . 
  we should keep the swedish flag . 
  but i could accept a flag with gold/yellow crowns on blue , as an alternative . 
  ( it 's the lesses coat of arms of the kingdom of sweden . ), 
  similar to the flag of munster , ireland . 
  the main cost is in handling the sewage . 
  sweden : an average detached house uses 150000 liters each year .
