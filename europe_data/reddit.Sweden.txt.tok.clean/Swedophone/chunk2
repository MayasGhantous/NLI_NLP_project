  yes , `` manna - '' is used in several languages , but i wonder if it is used to describe semolina from any crop or only wheat semolina as in swedish ? 
  i had n't heard about `` semolinagryn '' before . 
  wheat semolina is called `` mannagryn '' in swedish , and wheat semolina porridge is quite popular as a snack . 
  you can buy it in small packages ready to eat in the supermarkets . 
  it 's called mannafrutti ( by risifrutti ) : http://www.risifrutti.se/?page_id=75, 
  interesting , but i expected a reference to norn . 
   norn , an extinct north germanic language , was spoken in the northern isles ( orkney and shetland ) off the north coast of mainland scotland and in caithness in the far north of the scottish mainland . 
  varpa  varpa is an old outdoor game . 
  the game dates back to the viking age and survived in gotland together with several other medieval or viking games . 
   it is similar to boules but played with a flat and heavy thrower known as `` varpa '' instead of balls . 
  these used to be well-shaped stones , but nowadays aluminium is more popular . 
  varpa is an old word which simply means `` to throw '' . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/varpa varpa is played in several countries but probably reached its largest international audience in 1972 when it was a non-competition game during paralympics in heidelberg , west germany . 
  `` silence is golden '' the swedish proverb is `` tala \u00e4r silver , tiga \u00e4r guld '' ( speaking is silver , silence/not speaking is golden ) . 
  `` more and more swedes ditch the old nordic names like erik and johan . '', 
  erik is nordic ( meaning sole ruler ) , but johan ( variant of johannes ) has hebrew roots .

  i do n't use week numbers , my calendar does n't have them .

   a regular trashcan for the republika srpska government cost the citizen 1.733,76 km ( ~ 866 $ ) . 
  if you pay 866 $ you should at least get the name of the city and its heraldic weapon on the trashcan . 
  like these in trollh\u00e4ttan sweden ( where the movie `` fucking \u00c5m\u00e5l '' was filmed ) . 
  25 trashcans cost 21420 $ ( 857 $ each ) . 
   we call it ` g\u00e1lgah\u00famor ' in iceland , or ` gallows humour ' . 
  it 's very typical of scandinavia . '' the wikipedia page about gallows humour does n't name iceland or other nordic countries , but it mentions other countries :  gallows humor is a natural human instinct and examples of it can be found in stories from antiquity . 
  its use was widespread in middle europe , from where it was imported to the united states as part of jewish humor . 
  [ 3 ] it is rendered with the german expression galgenhumor . 
  the concept of gallows humor is comparable to the french expression rire jaune , [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] which also has a germanic equivalent in the belgian dutch expression groen lachen ( lit . 
  green laughing ) .

   scots is the same language as english . 
  are you sure you are n't confusing scots with scottish english ?

  at least that is the case when you search for names ( [ namns\u00f6k ] ( http://scb.se/sv_/hitta-statistik/statistik-efter-amne/befolkning/amnesovergripande-statistik/namnstatistik/30903/namnsok/ ) ) . 
  erik is about 10 times more common than eric ( 300614 vs 33465 ) . 
  sweden : karl is number one according to [ scb ] ( http://scb.se/sv_/hitta-statistik/statistik-efter-amne/befolkning/amnesovergripande-statistik/namnstatistik/30898/30905/samtliga-folkbokforda--fornamn-och-tilltalsnamn-topplistor/286715/ ) , both 2013 and 2014 . 
  and erik is second most common given name amongst men in sweden . 
  57.6 % turnout in 1828 meant less than 10 % of the population voted , but 54.9 % turnout in 2012 meant more than 40 % of the population .

  buying a hand grenade is cheaper than ice cream :  \\ - last year we saw a party of 64 grenades and 16 automatic weapons that cost around 1,000 euros to buy in the balkans , says appelgren for swedish television news . 
   but it 's only the weapons that cost money . 
  the 64 hand grenades were free of charge , or they cost one or two euros apiece - between ten and twenty swedish kronor . 
  the low price is probably because they are not in demand in the balkans because they are consumed rapidly and is dangerous to have in custody in his home .

   well , most of the russian population does n't live that far north though . 
  saint petersburg , the second largest city of russia is farther north and has a larger population than stockholm , and estonia , just to mention two areas celebrating midsummer or st john 's day . 
  looks almost like the [ swedish empire ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_empire ) , except for catalonia . 
   is it really ? 
  just realized i have to check that is it a schengen country or if it is a nordic country ...  in 1954 , the agreement was extended to allow citizens to reside and work in any nordic country without a residence or work permit . 
   have n't they tried that already ? 
  yes with the kalmar union from 1397 to 1523 . 
  electing gustav vasa as the king of sweden on 6 june 1523 marked the end of the kalmar union , which is celebrated on 6 june , the national day of sweden , each year . 
   there is a real fear of a loss of control and to a lot of average americans .
