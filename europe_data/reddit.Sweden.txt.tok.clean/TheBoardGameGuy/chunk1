i disagree . 
  we _ currently _ remember olof palme as the greatest prime minister we ever had , but if we look at who was the most popular during his time as prime minister , the answer has to be tage erlander . 
  he was elected prime minister _ seven _ times in a row , and only in one of those seven elections did his party get a worse voting result than olof palme 's _ best _ election . 
  he was prime minister for 23 years . 
  this issue is more important than it seems . 
  it 's about transparency and democracy . 
  when a public institution allows a private company to make it dependent on a privately owned product ( like a drug addict ) when there are good , open and free alternatives , something is seriously wrong . 
   it also records details about visits to a popular internet journal for linux operating system users called `` the linux journal - the original magazine of the linux community '' , and calls it an `` extremist forum '' . 
  believing in an alternative to shitty , closed-source software is apparently extremist . 
  i guess the american government consider anyone who does n't believe in profit-maximization to be a terrorist threat . 
  i understand that it might be annoying that cyprus as a member-state in the eu is never in statistics about europe , but cyprus is n't geographically in europe . 
  if it had said _ homicides _ _ in _ _ the _ _ eu _ , you would be right in being upset . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/semla ) most people only eat it on and around shrove tuesday . 
  it 's made with cardamom wheat buns , almond paste and whipped cream . 
  i believe that all morality is subjective ( i consider morality and point-of-view to be synonymous concepts ) . 
  what makes an action unforgivable , to me , is that i would not forgive _ any _ person who performed such an action . 
  my instincts and my upbringing tell me that those things are unforgivable . 
  i do not claim that this is true for all people . 
  i only claim that i would not wish to associate myself with anyone who does n't think that violations of human rights are unforgivable . 
  any violation of basic human rights , i suppose . 
  so primarily imprisonment without due process ( kidnapping ) , torture , murder , rape and death threats . 
  are you being sarcastic or are you just retarded ? 
  no , reich does not mean empire . 
  we have that word in sweden too ( rike ) . 
  as rithe740 pointed out , a better translation of the word _ reich _ would be _ realm _ . 
  do you really think that there 's nothing inherently unforgivable about forcing people away from their homes into a prison , despite them not being given any kind of trial ? 
  in my view , that is an unforgivable crime on its own , regardless of how much worse genocide is . 
  austria is called \u00d6sterreich in german . 
  it means ` eastern country ' . 
  it is east of switzerland . 
  we have proper heating and winter clothing , so that 's not a problem . 
  but the darkness and isolation is seriously depressing . 
  the only good thing about scandinavian winters is christmas . 
  i 'm serious as cancer when i say [ rhythm is a dancer ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhmyrlh8oze ) . 
  governments ( in europe ) are usually appointed by a parliament . 
  the choice is this : people -  national parliament -  national government -  commission president people -  european parliament -  commission president i prefer the route where the decision is based on how the people voted in the _ european _ elections , rather than based on what governments , appointed because of their views on _ national _ issues , have to say . 
  i may not be a fan of juncker , but his party is still the largest party in the ep . 
  the only way i would accept him _ not _ becoming commission president is if the european parliament agrees on schultz , keller , verhofstadt or tsipras instead . 
  because it is in percent of the total population . 
  whenever i point out that the sd were heiling openly as late as 1995 , and that their current party leader joined the party in 1995 , people claim that i am just delusional for suggesting that they are nazis . 
  common arguments :  they are not nazis _ nowadays _ . 
   they are just anti-immigration ... and anti-multiculturalism ... and anti-muslim . 
   the sd _ members _ _ of _ _ the _ _ swedish _ _ parliament _ that threatened immigrants with iron pipes are no longer in the party . 
  yeah , they 're _ totally _ not nazis . 
  people do n't vote , then they complain that no-one listens to them . 
  i call that whining . 
  i expected things to go well for the left and less well for the right , but i was very surprised by the fact that the environment party ( greens ) got more votes than the moderates ( epp ) . 
  that feminist initiative ( probably gue/ngl ) got a seat was also a surprise . 
  i did not know that . 
  what an asshole !, 
  the environment party has essentially the same views as the pirate party when it comes to it and integrity . 
  they are more vocal about the environment than about the issues the pp care about , but they have cooperated with the pp in the european parliament for several years now . 
  yes , it 's an american stereotype . 
  thanks !, 
  oh , here we go again . 
  do you have a link to those polls ? 
  ( i 'm not saying you are wrong , i just want to see it for myself ), 
  sweden : the social democrats ( s&d ) will get the largest share of the votes ( ~ 26 % ) . 
  the moderates ( epp ) will most likely get second place ( ~ 16 % ) , but the polls show that the environment party ( greens/efa ) is not far behind ( ~ 15 % ) . 
  after them comes the people 's party ( alde ) and the left party ( gue/ngl ) . 
  different polls show very different results for the smaller parties . 
  then comes the sweden democrats ( nazis ) , the center party ( alde , i think ) and the christian democrats ( epp ) . 
  there are some more parties , like the feminist initiative ( ? ), 
  and the pirate party ( greens/efa ) , but they are not likely to get any seats . 
  edit : the sweden democrats _ are _ nazis . 
  the most obviously nazi sympathizing people have left the party in favour of the party of the swedes . 
  but it 's not a change of heart . 
  it 's a change of appearance . 
  keep down-voting me all you want . 
  facts are facts . 
  i fully support this , but it is n't the only thing that matters in an election . 
  the only swedish candidate who signed this and is n't from the pirate party ( a party that wo n't get any seats in the ep no matter how i vote ) is eurosceptic , and i do n't want to vote for a eurosceptic candidate . 
  greens in blue ? 
  their colour is literally their name !, 
  i wholeheartedly agree . 
  while we are on the subject : public institutions should use exclusively open source software . 
  private companies can pick whatever software they want , but public institutions have a responsibility towards the people to be transparent and democratic . 
  using closed source software made by a for-profit organization when there are good alternatives out there sends the wrong message . 
  you seem to be a very confused individual . 
  in my country , owning land does not mean being able to limit where people may or may not move through . 
  we have a thing called `` allemansr\u00e4tten '' , which safeguards people 's right to trespass . 
  it 's a typically american notion that because you have the privilege to use something to make money , you have the right to limit other people in their actions . 
  when website after website is being taken down and people are being thrown in prison for sharing information , that 's censorship . 
  i know how copyright works . 
  it is a _ monopoly _ on distribution . 
  someone who farms land has a monopoly on selling his commodities , because they are scarce , physical resources that are limited whether you like it or not . 
  information is only artificially scarce . 
  it should not be limited . 
  the big corporations are the ones who benefit , whatever you say about the matter . 
  if a poor but hardworking author tries to sue a big corporation , it does n't matter who is right . 
  the corporation wins . 
  quoting the laws i was criticizing does n't amount to an argument , since i am against said laws . 
  `` information '' is not bullshit rhetoric . 
  we have seen in past years how copyright has been used as an excuse to silence dissent . 
  but i want to point out the thing that people always use as an argument , even though there is no conflict there : i do n't have a problem with people making money !, 
  i have a problem with people infringing on the most basic human right ( the right to a free flow of information ) , _ in _ _ order _ _ to _ _ make _ _ money _ . 
  i buy things all the time . 
  i would actually say that i buy more books , movies and dvd-boxes than most people . 
  i just do n't respect intellectual monopoly as a concept . 
  so stop with your low fucking smear campaign about things i do n't actually represent !,
