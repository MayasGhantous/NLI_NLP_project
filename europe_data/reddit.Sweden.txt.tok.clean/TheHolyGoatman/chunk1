the green part is n't exactly left-wing though . 
  more center-left than anything , definitly more to the right than the social democrats and the left party . 
  that is incredibly incorrect . 
  the korean war , the vietnam war , the war in afghanistan and the second congo war all take place after world war ii , and all of them has an etimate of more than 1,000,000 civilian casualties . 
  so you claim that the law is not enforced there , even though the article in question proves that the police just tried to enforced the law there . 
  shut it !, 
  90 % of the men can read , 77 % of the women . 
  ** people above the age of 15 who can read and write . 
  ** syria : 84,1 % sweden : 99,0 %, 
  the literal translation : north sea coast artillery air reconnaissance simulation facilities materiel maintenence monitoring system discussion contribution preparation work . 
  there 's a greater strain on the police and healthcare in some areas of sweden , but it 's definitly not as bad as / u/europe makes it out to be . 
  life goes on as normal , and people live their lives as they used to , aside from the few who through work come in direct contact with recent immigrants . 
  we could do with a less political correctness ( in all areas , not just immigration ) . 
  i did watch it . 
  and while it is clear there are problematic individuals and ideas amongst the muslim community ( as with all communities ) and that police should deal with such things as harshly as they deal with all inappropriate behavior , i ca n't say i recognize the general picture he is trying to paint for the audience , nor the conclusions he draws . 
  granted , i do not live in in the united kingdom so it 's possible that the reality there is diametrically opposite of the one in sweden ( though i doubt it ) . 
  he brings few statistics , few realiable sources , mainly anecdotes . 
  it 's a good thing he was allowed to speak though . 
  all voices should be heard , one just do n't have to agree with them . 
  thank you . 
  do you have a link ? 
  i will probably not agree with him , but it could be interesting to listen to nontheless . 
  seems like something of an asshole . 
  does n't mean the swedes of sweden do n't consider them a swedish minority . 
  the swedish-speaking finns are either folks who for some reason decided to live on the wrong side of the border or got left behind when the sensible folks decided to get the fuck out of suomi . 
  that or the invasion force nobody is suspecting . 
  it depends on the mood , really . 
  the norwegians are esentially swedes who are in denial and speak a funny dialect . 
  we 'll get you one day norwegians , just you wait ... you and that precious oil of yours ... want nothing to do with danskj\u00e4vlarna though . 
  they and the scanians ca n't be trusted . 
  they are like the little brothers who constantly gives you wedgies when you are n't looking , and one of them have bad habit of constanly mooching of you and sleeping on your couch . 
  in all seriousness , the only expatriates we care about are the ones who move back , and the only swedish minority in another nation who we actually might consider ethnically swedish are the \u00c5landers of finland . 
  the other swedish-speakers in finland might be more finnis than swedish by now . 
  does n't really matter though . 
  we have great relations with everyone amongst the nordic countries . 
  looks light brown to me . 
  only the tips appear blond-ish . 
  why the roman empire ? 
  did you just write that people with blonde hair can only have blue or green eyes ? 
  because ... that 's wrong ... very , very wrong . 
  and then you write that you have var dark blonde hair , which is almost pure black ? 
  [ what ] ( http://memesvault.com/wp-content/uploads/what-meme-13.jpg ) ? 
  the fear mongering did not lead it being avoided . 
  raising concerns did . 
  the two are not the same , since one is done in a rational manner while the other is irrational . 
  do n't pretend that fear mongering had a positive benefit to justify and excuse the actions of the ignorant . 
  and when did i ever state that migration is n't a serious issue that do n't need to be managed properly ? 
  also , how is the realization that things will work out disingenous when it 's the simple truth ? 
  [ here you go . 
  ] ( http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/ett-fatal-brott-i-sverige-kopplas-till-flyktingar/ ) not that i expect you to care for anything that does n't fit your miniscule worldview . 
  now , who could that have been ? 
  either he 's talking out of his ass or he 's never been to one of our beloved crayfish parties . 
  i 'd wager the former . 
  there is no generally accepted truth amongst swedes that everything good comes from elsewhere , or any `` propaganda '' spewing such untruths . 
  swedes are just aware that good things can come from other places as well , not just sweden . 
  do n't believe everything you see here . 
  tis true . 
  if you eat them on any other day you spontaneously combust . 
  `` we all know '' ... that a very odd turn of phrase , considering tht 60 % of the swedish population thinks we can handle the amount of refugees we take in now , or can even take in more . 
  the nay-sayers are in a minority . 
  a very , very small part of all crime our police are called on to deal with involve refugees , and not all of those crimes have the refugee as the perpetrator ... so yeah ... the increase in crime is hardly significant . 
  that 's the spirit !, 
  i 've already gathered up a ton of them myself !, 
  thank you for enlightening me . 
  there is no particular change . 
  everyone essentially do what they have always done with no major problems . 
  some people will always be drama queens however . 
  nice to see someone rational who actually knows history here . 
  makes me hungry just looking at them . 
  gon na eat a [ * semla * ] ( http://cdn.rdb.arla.com/files/arla-se/3914682901/471d7ee5-2cc0-43df-945a-3908b84c7e03.jpg?preset=main ) instead . 
  there is reason to be worried , i agree with you on that point . 
  i just do n't like some of the fear mongering ( i love those words ) going around , or some of the open racism i so frequently see . 
  it 's alright to disagree about what to do in a given situation , but i 'd prefer some facts and actual common sense to be involved ( which is where you come in , kudos to you ) . 
  well , something must be done to increase the employment rate for them that i absolutely agree , but as i 'm no expert at getting people to work i ca n't say what . 
  i do not think the people who have a 65 % employment rate are anywhere close to actually upsetting the status quo however . 
  also , increasing the employment rate is mot the only thing to do to avoid such a situation ( though it would be a good start ) . 
  entire systems may need to be overlooked and overhauled . 
  while i would prefer to have ethnicity documented as well , i do not doubt them . 
  damn you finns and your strange language , ca n't read that article and i do n't see any option to change language ... that said , the difference is significantly lower in sweden according to br\u00e5 ( the swedish national council for crime prevention ) . 
  about 1.4 times higher when adjusted some for socioeconomic factors , if i recall correctly . 
  most crimes where they stand out are crimes against other people ( violence , robbery , sex crimes ) . 
  indigenous swedes without foreign ancestry stand out in monetary crimes and drunk driving and stuff . 
  well , everyone do deserve a better life , i just prefer to focus on the issues closer to home before i take on the task of saving the world . 
  it 's not as if sweden is actually lacking the resources to deal with things as they are now - just the political will and desire to do so . 
  such logic is rare here . 
  i salute you . 
  no problem . 
  just standing what i believe to be right . 
  have a great day , mate . 
  i just wanted to point out why there is n't much available statistics to differentiate refugee from foreign-born , which is why i use the latter term . 
  indeed , finnish is the biggest . 
  non-europeans almost always have lower employment rates . 
  your sources does n't change the fact that the `` more than half of refugees do n't have an employment five years after coming to sweden '' argument is dubious , which was the argument i was countering . 
  not saying the current employment rates are optimal , just pointing out that about 50 % of the refugees ** are ** employed , espceially when most spend their first year ( s ) studying rather than working . 
  it should also be noted that these individuals comprise a quite small part of the swedish population , so while your claim that the welfare state ca n't handle an employment rate of 65 % might be true , 65 % is n't the employment rate of our population , just a fraction of it . 
  statistics from the swedish national council for crime prevention shows that while crime rates certainly are higher amongst those with foreign roots the , differences are not that great and are clearly influenced by socioeconomic factors - and the foreign-born individuals are infact less likely to be found guilty of crime than our own beloved politicians . 
  it 's also proven that migration can boosts the economy in the long run , so whether you consider it a waste or not it really depends on how short-sighted you are . 
  so i do n't really see why we would have to ** justify ** this stance . 
  i care very little for what goes on in africa and personally would prefer to diminish the amount of foreign aid we spend , refocusing it on issues closer at home , at least in times like these . 
  so i do n't really see why you would think i want to make the world a better place or why that video would be relevant , when i mainly care about helping and integrating the individuals who come to europe and sweden .
