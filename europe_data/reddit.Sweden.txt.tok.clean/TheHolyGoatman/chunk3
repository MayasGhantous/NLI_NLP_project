  none of that makes him/her and apologist , nor could he/she be called `` regressive '' by any sane individual . 
  that you seem incapable of comprehending that and instead jump to farfetched conclusions makes you come of as far more `` regressive '' . 
  suddenly got the urge to fly to guatemala or east timor so i can feel like a giant . 
  yes , i live in sweden . 
  no , i do not read right wing blogs , since most of them are full of shit . 
  what lies have i told ? 
  better than considering it as a glass half empty , i 've always thought . 
  never claimed one should ignore it . 
  just thinking that the title is disingenuous/incorrect , since violence has always been a factor in human history , even in recent european history , whether through common crime , terrorism or warfare . 
  does n't mean the violence in our communities should be accepted as a fact of life , just pointing out that long-term we seem to be going in the right direction , statistically speaking . 
  number of casualties from terrorism in europe is far lower today than when compared to casualties from terrorism in the 70 's -90 's . 
  i 'd wager that one of the the reasons terrorattacks recieve so much attention today is because they have become so rare , relatively speaking . 
  even terrorism is n't as bad nowadays as it once was , even though islamic terrorism recieves a lot of spotlight in the news ( as it should , not saying otherwise ) . 
  more died each year during the 70 's -90 's than they do each year now . 
  i think that even for the green party she is a bit on the extreme side . 
  though that may just be my impressions . 
  she has fortunately resigned from her position in the goverment . 
  good riddance i say . 
  the polarization between both sides of the spectrum is just one of many points for why i 'm averse to picking far-right or far-left parties . 
  nothing good ever comes from wholeheartedly emracing one side of the debate without so much as trying to listen to the other side . 
  yet that is far to often what happens when dealing with the far-right and far-left . 
  better to try and incorporate the positives from both right and left , which is what centrism stands for . 
  i 'd vote for the swedish parties of the alde because they are generally socially liberal , economically centrist and pro-european . 
  one seldom sees the isolationism or extremism of the far-right or far-left there , and they are n't as averse to change as the more moderate right and left are . 
  thos are some reasons . 
  i 'm generally quite averse to the polarization caused by the left and right and try to take a middle road . 
  sweden 's got two parties represented there . 
  not sure which of the two i 'd choose , but i know it would most likely be one of them . 
  there is technically warfare going on in pakistan . 
  whether that is enough to warrant asylum is another matter . 
  nor do i see why beung a nuclear country would exempt pakistani 's from becoming refugees , since having nuclear weapons does n't mean an automatic end to persecution for religious , political or sexual reasons . 
  most folks completely shat on that article though . 
  so do n't worry , we have n't all lost our marbles just yet . 
  does n't mean the anti-union sentiments wo n't increase . 
  i doubt it will lead to a referendum though . 
  where do you see that they did n't observe regular mealtimes ? 
  would be very strange if they did n't , imo , especially since the article explicitly says `` a late evening meal was introduced for muslims observing ramadan '' . 
  `` for muslims '' suggests it was a meal exlusively for the muslims , no ? 
  but they were n't forced to do that . 
  the late evening meal was for the muslims , not the non-muslims . 
  the non-muslims presumably had the regular mealtimes . 
   ** a late evening meal was introduced for muslims observing ramadan ** and one group of men not taking part in the fast complained that their meals were not big enough . 
  `` we 're looking at this as the motive , '' an investigator said . 
  but nowhere does it say non-muslims had to participate in muslum customs and celebrations . 
  the article suggests that the non-muslims disgruntled response to recieving smaller portions compared to the ramadan celebrators was what caused the conflict . 
   a late evening meal was introduced ** for muslims observing ramadan ** and ** one group of men not taking part in the fast complained ** that their meals were not big enough . 
  '' ** we 're looking at this as the motive ** , '' an investigator said . 
  noone was forced to participate in ramadan celebrations against their will . 
  where does it say non-muslims were forced to celebrate muslim customs ? 
  killing most people is fucking horrible . 
  and yet public service comes off as far more impartial than the rest of swedish media - at least public service is obligated by law to include more opinions than their own and content directed towards people with different preferences . 
  i have : http://www.jmg.gu.se/digitalassets/1369/1369226_journalist-2011-journalistboken-kap-13.pdf and http://jmg.gu.se/digitalassets/1284/1284227_nr38.pdf . 
  it 's quite fascinating , but does n't detract from the fact that public service comes off as far more impartial than the rest of swedish media - at least public service is obligated by law to include more opinions than their own and content directed towards people with different preferences . 
  it 's in the law and has been for a long time . 
  does n't get much more factual than that . 
  examples of fake news from fria tider ? 
  well , there are some clear examples who 've been debunked . 
  http://www.metro.se/artikel/h%c3%a4r-%c3%a4r-historien-bakom-skolans-censur-av-nu-t%c3%a4ndas-tusen-juleljus http://www.metro.se/artikel/nej-invandrare-f%c3%a5r-inte-gratisl%c3%a5n-av-csn-xr http://www.metro.se/artikel/nej-muhammed-fick-inte-h%c3%b6jt-skadest%c3%a5nd-f%c3%b6r-att-han-var-asyls%c3%b6kande-xr http://www.metro.se/artikel/r%c3%a4kneexempel-om-invandrares-bidrag-ett-hopkok-xr all in all , the site is n't one to be trusted . 
  the swedish media council lists fria tider as being part of the radical right-wing and containing content that is obviously racist , xenophobic and islamophobic : http://www.regeringen.se/contentassets/c6460146d8de486eabf7f209b3a9093a/valdsbejakande-och-antidemokratiska-budskap-pa-internet furthermore , fria tider is not sworn to uphold the same standards as public service like sr , svt or ur who are independent and impartial and required to contain diverse content - instead fria tider is clearly biased in their reporting with a clear agenda . 
  fria tider is notorius for spreading false information though , so one ca n't exactly call it trustworthy . 
  `` fake news '' to put it simply . 
  shame my ma and pa do n't have facebook then . 
  could 've saved my sister and me some worry today . 
  it 's not , it 's simply common sense , yet some people seem to believe the right-wing is the place where common sense primarily resides ( i disagree , most right-wingers are backwards as fuck ) . 
  considering how much support the moderate party lost in the polls after they approached sd , i think the social democrats and all other parties will be extremely wary about approaching sd . 
  as in it will never happen in the foreseeable future . 
  it does n't fit their narrow worldview . 
  fine compared to most of the world it seems to me . 
  the difference between 0.6 and 0.9 is miniscule compared to countries like 6.5 for sudan or 10.3 for nigeria . 
  even if the number of murder in sweden has rises to 110 in 2016 , the murder rate would still just be 1.1 , which is still far less than most of the world , and in line with the rest of europe . 
  all in all these murder rates are well within the expected , and there is nothing to suggest the recent wave of immigrants has impacted the numbers in any major way . 
  that you can not fathom it does n't change the fact that sweden is doing fine . 
  if anything it just proves your lack of perspective , insight and knowledge on the topic . 
  how is it false ? 
  sweden has 0.9 murders per capita , denmark 1.0 , finland 1.6 . 
  statistics are from 2014 . 
  source : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate . 
  when ? 
  there has been major waves of immigration to sweden since the 70 's . 
  swedish police disagrees with the term `` no-go zones '' though , and it 's clearly not an accurate term . 
  actually , according to the most recent data ( 2014 ) , both finland and denmark had more murders per capita than sweden . 
  how does that prove they are lying ? 
  the regular folk of rinkeby probably want to get rid of them more than anyone else since it 's their shops that are broken into and their cars that are lit up whenever this shit happens . 
  sweden has never been homogenous . 
  the sami has been living in the north for a ** very ** long while , and recently waves of largescale immigration from finland , latin america and iran had occured during the 60 's , 70 's and 80 's . 
  then , around 30 years ago we had the balkan wars which caused a massive wave of refugees from former yugoslavia to settle here . 
  no , the most common and most widespread use of the term `` no-go zones '' refers to areas where law enforcement are unable to operate and retain control , or areas where law enforcement has explicitly forbidden the public to be . 
  that 's how the terms are used when used accurately, 
  why would the oslo police keep such statistics ? 
  ah , the good old times when swedish bikers gangs broke into military bases , stole rpg 's and fired at each others clubhouses . 
  i 'd take anything posted on friatider or flashback with a heavy grain of salt though . 
  both are full of shit , and prone to lying ( though the friatider link is actually trueish this time ) . 
  to idiots , maybe . 
  you 're utterly delusional if you think that . 
  that picture is from bangladesh though . 
  you actually want me to put my faith in speisa , a blogg known for conspiracy theories , fake news , outright lies , and propaganda ? 
  said article does n't even list any actual sources , just claims that it has some . 
  because internet stories and youtube are more reliable than statistics and expert opinion . 
  if you actually knew abything about our country you would n't have posted such stupid shit as `` it will not survive the demographic shift '' . 
  that 's just blatant ignorance of facts and statistics , as well as ignorance of past trends in our country and that of others .
