the swedish version would be grisbestigare, 
  pig-climber perhaps ? 
  meanwhile in sweden ... 
  is there such a thing as a * most phonetic * language ? 
  i 'm learning japanese and there are very few irregular exceptions . 
  i can pronounce every new word phonetically correctly by looking at it 's spelling while i get it right maybe 80 % of the time for swedish words , and that 's my native language . . finnish is nice too , 
  feels like [ home ] ( / r/sweden ), 
  i 'm going to aikia tomorrow . 
  it 's a mix of villages , towns , suburbs , and ... well , sheds . 
  swedish lesson !, 
  finn in swedish is `` finne '' pimple in swedish is `` finne '', 
  no , they grow from the faces of swedes and float across the sea to finland . 
  basically we reproduce by planting the skulls of our deceased in nice fertile soil . 
  exactly . 
  the majority of nazis did not run concentration camps . 
  actually that 's greek beta ... 
  it should be : baraq o\u00dfama, 
  same here, 
  it was an accident !, 
  unfortunately i 'd never heard of it ( i 'm under 20 ) . 
  are you saying the refugees have infiltrated the german government ? 
  ps are rs , \u0418s are i ( ee ) s , \u0421s are ss , \u0412s are vs , \u0417s are zs ... 
  the feds are controlling our minds , man . 
  wake up sheeple !, 
  \u5927 is greatest . 
  literally . 
  it 's not hard on windows or mac either, 
  used to go to one ( in sweden ) each summer until it sank ... 
  sorry for being a racist dickhole and whatever, 
  * f\u00f6ld * does n't only mean * land * though , and * country * does n't only mean * orsz\u00e1g * . 
  because of this you have to base the translation on context , and this context happens to be as a suffix to geonyms , for which * land * is used in english . 
  yes , thank you . 
  i 've corrected it, 
  land is a better translation because it 's the suffix used in english names . 
  ( e.g england , not engcountry ) and means roughly the same thing . 
  orsak in swedish . 
  ( cause as in reason ), 
  [ i wasted an hour making something similar for swedish ] ( http://i.imgur.com/e0cxe1g.png ) i did three things very similarly unintentionally : 1 . 
  placement of the map key 2 . 
  coloring of bosnia-herzegovina 3 . 
  the outline appears to be the same, 
  same in swedish . 
  it 's just `` wales '' pronounced the same as in english . 
  dania gazember - `` danmark skurk '' swears and insults are rarely easy to translate . 
  what about * d\u00e1n rohad\u00e9k * ? 
  now you 're making it too complicated , we do n't need to divide muslims into smaller groups , they 're all the same / s, 
  fuck manliness , i do n't want pee all over my shirt . 
  eating with your hands is not strange if you wash them properly before and after , especially dry foods like bread and fruit . 
  i always eat sushi with my hands if there 's water and soap nearby . 
  this is sweden . 
  catastrophe is the right word . 
  pick a side or they 'll do it for you . 
  lots of fun in wales . 
  / r/yesfap, 
  it 's bizarre . 
  i 'm all for letting people into the country ; but when a politician claims we need more immigrants and care more about getting a high-score of immigrants imported than helping those in need , there 's a problem . 
  bein ' scottish and a ', 
  he used two crayons for one line and a brush for the other, 
  i like wet and windy ; not to mention cloudy !, 
  i like the weather too \u4e41 | \uff65 \uff65 | \u310f, 
  [ scotland ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hxbr1tl.png ) the guy who drew this was clearly drunk . 
  vast majority could be every hospital . 
  since i do n't know all hospitals i did n't exclude the possibility . 
  if men wanted help before they went to a non-female clinic . 
  the article says this is the first department specifically for men , not the first to treat men . 
  the vast majority of hospitals are open to both sexes . 
  the physical and to some extent mental effects of rape on men and women differs , unlike races , and they may want specialized help, 
  it 's not fully achieved since there is n't a single goal of feminism . 
  you could for example say your feminist goal is to make sure there are no laws that are disfavourable to women . 
  even in that case they have n't succeeded . 
  i do agree they 're nowhere near as relevant as 50 years ago . 
  typical swedish feminazis saying male rape victims are n't important enough to go to a normal clinic, 
  but if we help refugees they will blow up our skools, 
  what is that supposed to mean ? 
  that was uploaded nov 29 last year [ oh look ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jarcnbh7xsy/maxresdefault.jpg ) [ sweden has it too ] ( http://www.sydsvenskan.se/images/d8rdtehpji013-cn1wzywcjgfsw.jpg ), 
  on some roads . 
  this looks more like they just did n't see the snow comming and could n't be bothered taking their bikes inside . 
  every single time sweden is mentioned . . 
  [ meanwhile , elsewhere in sweden ] ( https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e35/14606976_109184149563458_1908464517499584512_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=mtm3nzq5ode3otu3mdu0mdyxmw%3d%3d.2 ) [ extra ] ( https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e35/14736262_193423397778825_562161607879163904_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=mtm3otawntuzmdixmdg1ndk1mq%3d%3d.2 ) ( not my pictures ), 
  japanese : \u30f4\u30ed\u30c4\u30ef\u30d5 ( vurotsuwafu/burotsuwafu ) , which is a very close phonetic transcription of wroc\u0142aw, 
  more in this sense : 1 . 
  acquire sugar 2 . 
  burn sugar 3 . 
  there is no sugar left . 
  the sugar `` disappeared '', 
  that 's the problem right there . 
  `` correct '' opinions . 
   is carrying a strong religious and political message , and that 's why it should be banned let 's ban all politcal activity . 
   germany has a hardon for doktors ftfy, 
  it 's like koreans and gimchi ... 
   90 % of the world speaks english pidgin , yet claims native speaker proficiency . 
  that 's a relatively extreme claim . 
  your comment is exactly the kind of thing that 's posted on / r/shittylinguistics , so i linked to it . 
  / r/poeslawinaction, 
  / r/shittylinguistics, 
  english : compendium -  compendiums bacterium -  bacteria status -  statuses genus -  genera cactus -  cacti man -  men tooth -  teeth ox -  oxen not saying german is n't hard to learn , but most languages require learning a lot of irregular grammar . 
  that was sort of the point of my comment, 
  germanic \u2260 german, 
  the difference really is that english is more expected to be broken . 
  everyone i know personally see them as a joke .
