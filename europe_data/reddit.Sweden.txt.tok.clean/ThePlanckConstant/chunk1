yeah , they 're doing something immoral which they should be blamed for , but legally going after the companies will practically make no difference . 
  it 's the politicians that we actually have a possibility and responsibility to control . 
  are you saying it 's the company 's fault that politicians are corrupt ? 
  i would not agree , that 's also the systems fault . 
  you should not be able to do that . 
  do n't blame the company , fix your system . 
  corruption is not a universal problem , it 's been largely eliminated in many places and can be in your country too if you have the will . 
  corruption is not that bad in luxembourg , so i do n't think it 's been a factor in this case . 
  i actually support it . 
  it 's our responsibility not to have loopholes . 
  if we have loopholes , it 's not morally wrong to use them . 
  if we know of the loophole and still keep it open , then it 's not a loophole but a intended function of the system . 
  in some countries in europe people feel like they do n't need to learn english . 
  the only point of his writing in french is to help those retards who are contributing to upholding the language barriers in europe . 
  in some parts of italy they have the same problem . 
  british humor is the best . 
  at least all of scandinavia loves it . 
  oh , now i understand . 
  well , it 's simply wrong . 
  i do n't get the point . 
  i do n't get it . 
  are you joking ? 
  [ those countries have about the same gni per capita , with sweden being slightly higher than australia .

  and they only started improve when they got away from the planned economy . 
  they where miserable under the communist times , now they 're more capitalists than anything else . 
  this looks like the receiving countries , right ? 
  the phrase `` for the greater good '' just have a bad historical connotation . 
  it 's used to justify doing something horrible . 
   for the greater good you 're begging to be called a communist ... 
  but i think everyone would agree with you on point . 
  to provide the money , for a regulated minimum of healthcare , does not even go against free market capitalism . 
  no , the `` large piece of land '' that would become inhospitable is so due to caesium-137 which has a half time of about 30 years . 
  at the chernobyl site for example , there remains only 1 % of the original radiation http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:totalexternaldoseratecher.png due to that the most dangerous substances already have decayed . 
  if you 'd be careful you might close the site for two or three centuries , not a millenia . 
  so to say , people can very much spend time in chernobyl right now , and every 30 years radiation levels fall by half . 
  it would though take many millennia before you theoretically could safely stand inside the reactor . 
  the reactor and the substances with longer halftime would probably have been moved away and buried by that time though . 
  then stop being conservative !, 
  yes , if you 'd apologize to the people you 're hurting that 'd be appreciated . 
  culture is not an excuse to treat gays badly . 
  discussion was had both before and after the ban . 
  and after many years it was allowed under regulated circumstances . 
  both sides need not necessarily agree . 
  sometimes you must simply adjust to the law once something has been decided to be in our collective interest . 
  i know some foreigners have a hard time understanding this concept but it works really well . 
  this is scandinavia . 
  healthcare does n't work like that . 
  and the main reason professional boxing was prohibited is because it 's viewed violent and dangerous . 
  we have a low acceptance of violence in the nordics . 
  because it 's free and effective , compared to banning cigarettes and alcohol . 
   the scandinavian country already gets two-thirds of its electricity from non-fossil fuel energy sources - predominately hydroelectric and nuclear this part of the article is plain wrong . 
  correct values would be two thirds renewable and one third nuclear . 
  or maybe they mean two thirds of our total energy ( not just electricity ) comes from renewable and nuclear sources . 
   quite effective even in lapland ( half a year of course ) that is the main problem . 
  our electricity consumption is much higher at the winter half of the year . 
  we need production capacity to meet the peek demand and that is in winter when solar is close to worthless in sweden . 
  if we use solar during the summer , what are we to use during winter ? 
  our dams ca n't cope with the demand themselves . 
  finland is correctly not included . 
  is n't australia doing just that ? 
  they have a non-aggression pact with the regime , and the regime has rewarded the kurds with greater autonomy . 
  russian troops ca n't fight kurds since the regime does n't define them as enemies . 
   i said number of births fell during crisis . 
  in a few countries there was a small fall . 
  in others there was an increase . 
  the general reason is low use of birth control in post soviet countries . 
  that this is rapidly changing is a fact i 've already brought up . 
  there was no increase in abortions during the crisis . 
  russia for example has had a falling abortion rate every single year for the past 20 years , even during the crisis : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_russia#after_wwii the high amount of abortions can absolutely be attributed to a low prevalence of birth control since soviet times : [  in the 1980s only 8 % to 10 % of married russian women of reproductive age used hormonal and intrauterine contraception methods , compared to 20 % to 40 % in developed countries . 
  this led to much higher abortion rates in russia compared to developed countries : in the 1980s russia had a figure of 120 abortions per 1,000 women of reproductive age compared with only 20 per 1,000 in western countries . 
  however , after the dissolution of the soviet union in 1991 many changes took place , such as the demonopolization of the market for contraceptive drugs and media liberalization , which led to a rapid conversion to more efficient pregnancy-control practices . 
  abortion rates fell in the first half of the 1990s for the first time in russia 's history , even despite declining fertility rates . 
  from the early 1990s to 2006 , the number of expected abortions per woman during her lifetime fell by nearly 2.5 times , from 3.4 to 1.2 . 
  as of 2004 , the share of women of reproductive age using hormonal or intrauterine birth control methods was about 46 % ( 29 % intrauterine , 17 % hormonal ) .

  it 's a fight against being overtaken by both a foreign government and by a foreign people . 
   and no perception among people of being responsible for any invasion in a middle east . 
  they also have feuds with central asian and caucasus islamists . 
  i 'd expect more jihadists to come if us went in with ground forces . 
  but i 'm not sure russia would be seen the same way . 
  it 's great , one of my favourite bad movies . 
  then iceland would also have to be included . 
  well , it was nice talking again . 
   species that habit old or rotting trees . 
  trees are left to rot at regular intervals . 
   some of it will die , as a lot of species require old growth forests with abundance of aging and rotting wood to survive . 
  that is why some wood are left to rot . 
  mainly some insects require this and we , at least in sweden , have managed to greatly increase their numbers . 
   my sources are in finnish , but here you go : you must see how that is of no value to me . 
  the pulls only consider what you call yourself , not what others call you . 
  you 'd have to view your self exclusively allied with a single religion to not fall under the definition of secularism . 
   according to cultural anthropologists such as jack david eller , secularity is best understood , not as being `` anti-religious '' , but as being `` religiously neutral '' since many activities in religious bodies are secular themselves and most versions of secularity do not lead to irreligiosity . 
  our earlier archbishop nathan s\u00f6derblom in 1925 expressed that there are many ways to god . 
  that the swedish church thereafter acted according to this could very well be argued makes our whole church a secular institution . 
  since sd is considered to be racist fascist extremists in sweden , you would then also be called such . 
  the general climate between the two sides is very hostile , not to say violent . 
  hello, 
  i remember you . 
  we were going for an unending reply chain fight a month ago .
