that is also a factor but it is kind of high risk game to stage a kidnapping of a foreign agent on foreign soil in order to free an agent just because it is good for morale i 'm especially sceptical since russia has a tendency to let spies serve their time in jail becuase they do n't want to admit to anything . 
  there is probably more that they are interested in and if you look up the guy they traded him for it was probably worth it . 
   circlejerking and outright pretending other countries arent involved is as stupid as you imply i am . 
  claiming that other countries is involved without solid evidence is stupid . 
  and useful idiot is n't an implication about your intelligence level it states that you are doing russian intelligence work for free . 
   i am just sick and tired of people sucking each other off over russia and fail to have the capacity to reflect on the point that it is a two-way system . 
  did i somehow miss the giant western invasion of ukraine or is it not really a two way system ? 
  you might not care for propaganda but you 're definitely part of the russian slew of useful idiots if you 're going to make the argument that the west is just as bad as russia . 
  100 % compartmentalisation is something that is only found in movies ( look at the snowden operation - they have released documents from all over the place not all related to the nsa and/or mass surveillance ) and besides dressen was an officer pretty high up in the organisation who was also working for the russians . 
  it 's pretty safe to assume that he was n't an involuntary recruit but rather was working for ideological reasons . 
  and being pretty high up in the hierarchy means he will have insights that might be damaging to the russians should he be turned by the estonians or vice versa he might have information that is important to the russians . 
  it is even possible that the reason this negotiation has taken so long might be because the estonians have been stalling in order to prepare his release by running damage control on whatever he might have had access to . 
  russian propaganda has been on baghdad bob level of retarded but still there are these useful idiots who really want to believe . 
  now you 're apparantly using the crazy ramblings of [ a separatist ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oleg_tsaryov ) as an unbiased source and a [ misquoted phone call ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/05/ukraine-bugged-call-catherine-ashton-urmas-paet ) that says that the shooters were probably not from yanukovich ( does n't prove were they were from just speculates that they might have been from a new coalition ) . 
  and all this disproves the russian invasion how ? 
  the putin pillowbiters rhetoric is truly shit tier . 
  he 's an intelligence operative he might have information in his head that is best not to be released to the west or maybe the russians suddenly realised that this information is very valuable to them . 
  is this like that picture from russia that showed black water in the ukraine that with a simple reverse image search showed that it was actually taken in the us ? 
  or is it like the m1 abrams that had a poorly photoshoped [ ukrainian armed forces shield on the side ] ( http://gyllenhaals.blogspot.se/2015/04/orovackande-oproffsig-rysk-propaganda.html ) ( which a reverse image search showed to be taken in you guessed it : the us ) ? 
  it 's a conspiracy nut channel so do n't expect quality or logical reasoning behind their videos . 
  just smile and wave then back away sloooowly . 
  the estonians confirmed that their security officer was armed ? 
  [ shocking revelation ] ( http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/512/216/f9b.jpg ) . 
  also are n't you that russian troll that has been skulking around here for the past year ? 
  i seem to remember an orion back during discussions about the russian war in ukraine earlier this year . 
  this is important because you never use someone with a public image as a covert spy . 
  that would be really stupid and does n't even work in james bond movies . 
  and kohver had a public image before the incident due to him being publicly decorated in 2010 by the estonian president . 
  this is sort of one of the reasons why we westerners have a hard time understanding muslims and probably why we have a hard time integrating them into our societies . 
  you guys just compared muslims to western europeans in a way that is logical to a person who has a humanistic outlook on life because to a humanist religion does n't matter and culture is just a social construct that is relative . 
  sort of like `` they are humans just like me so obviously they think like me '' but that completely glosses over the fact that they are from a culture that has over a thousand years of traditions that are very dissimilar from our traditions , our way of thinking , or our culture . 
  in fact in some instances it is completely opposite to our culture . 
  for example in sweden it is completely [ ok to be gay ] ( http://www.valorebooks.com/campus-life/wp-content/uploads/number-1-may-30.jpg ) . 
  you come out as gay and people react with `` oh that 's nice . 
  [ listen i 'm gon na need these tps reports filled out asap . 
  ] ( http://memecrunch.com/meme/2dczs/tps-reports/image.jpg ) '' what has happened in the past decade is that people from a different country were they grew up in a different culture , with a different history , with different values , etc. 
  have come here and they are n't assimilating to our values so we now have areas in sweden were it suddenly is n't so ok to be gay and if you 're a woman who shows off her hair she 's called `` slut '' or `` whore '' . 
  and women who walk around without a male relative escorting them can be harassed by little shits playing religious police . 
  think about your christian friends how many of them would work on a sunday ? 
  how many of them [ would eat pork ] ( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=deuteronomy+14%3a8&amp;version=kjv ) ? 
  do they look at the [ composition of the cloths before they purchase them to find out if they are allowed to wear them ] ( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=leviticus+19%3a19&amp;version=kjv ) ? 
  most likely most of your christian friends do n't really care about those parts of the bible but if you have any muslim friends you can be sure that they will check for pork before they eat something , even if they are a moderate muslim . 
  out of all the muslim acquaintances that i 've known only two would say things like `` well i do n't really care about that stuff '' . 
  the reason we ca n't understand muslims is because unlike us even moderate muslims actually belive in their holy scriptures and even if they are n't good muslims they will make an effort to follow the qur ` an . 
  god wills it !, 
   i should not have let it cloud my mind of contemporary sweden . 
  more like you should n't confuse different subjects . 
  5 years ago is not that long ago but the people behind this initiative are not the same people who wrote the law about gender discrimination back in the 90s . 
  and on that note you probably should n't judge an entire nation based on a very narrow view . 
  i 'm more suprised by the stuff i read about swedish radical feminists because half of it seems to be made up and the other half seems to be things blown out of proportions . 
  like that time one movie theatre , which caters to a rather special crowd , started to grade the movies they were showing based on the bechdel test . 
  most people reacted with a `` ok who cares '' but you would n't know it from the headlines around the world the guardians headline was : `` swedish cinemas take aim at gender bias with bechdel test rating '' and jezebel : `` sweden introduces new movie rating system based on the bechdel test '' . 
   maybe i just had too many glances at the men 's right subreddit . 
  :p i do n't know what they 've been saying since i do n't go there but you 're not really that far off the mark . 
  positive discrimination was never really legal to begin with but it was an accepted practice in university acceptance quotas until 2008 when a group of women took legal action against a university because they did n't get in to the veterinary program and after a few more legal tussles were female plainitffs sued universities it was abolished in 2010 . 
  this quota system mainly favoured men since there are more top scoring female student than male student applying for certain university programs . 
  the reasoning behind not allowing positive discrimination was to quote the then minister of education :  utbildningssystemet ska \u00f6ppna d\u00f6rrar -- inte sl\u00e5 igen dem i ansiktet p\u00e5 studiemotiverade unga kvinnor in english :  the educational system is supposed to open doors - not slam them in the face of study motivated young women, 
  i think the [ british invasion was the last successful invasion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_invasion ) . 
  oh you just wait outside of mcdonalds ... eventually they 'll starve out there . 
  well we found that submarine years before the submarine hunt last year so that would be very efficient if you are suggsting some sort of connection . 
  that whole media circus around the ocean x team and their `` recently '' found wreck was just a bunch of guys whoring for attention since that whole ufo story has fallen out of memory . 
  if you do n't remember the ufo story from the same company who `` found '' the pre ww1 era submarine som : http://www.livescience.com/22846-mysterious-baltic-sea-object-is-a-glacial-deposit.html, 
  claimed denmark instead of estonia 0/10, 
  yeah it is kind of interesting and i always try to remember stats like these during election cycles because polls are interesting but not necessarily a good predictor of the final result . 
  the feminist party ( fi ) for example were looking really popular there for a while but once election day came they did n't even get one seat in parliament . 
  actually sentios pre election poll gave the sd a slightly lower result ( 12,7 % ) than they eventually got in the election ( 12,9 % ) but they were the closest to sds actual electionday result . 
  out of all the pre election polls only one poll gave them a higher result than they actually got but i do n't remember which poll that was . 
   sentios polls are often considered flawed as they use web votes . 
  sentio is a serious research group that offers a wide varitey of services and they are actually really good . 
  as far as i 'm concerned if your results consistently agree with reality then your method of aquiring those results does n't really matter because obviously it works . 
  this is a diagram of pre election polls and election results : http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lksyrmz5xzc/vhlw9lkbhyi/aaaaaaaacc8/sztfkwrhmj4/s1600/sd.png the broken line at the top is their election day result and the various dots are their results in polls prior to the election . 
  and a similar diagram that presents all the major parties that took part in the previous election : http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6qtzzmttkum/vfeqdccmdni/aaaaaaaabys/rkkgkyjhbke/s1600/val.png * left stack is election results * middle stack is a poll where participants were selected at random * right stack is a poll were participants were not recruited but rather had to look up the poll themselves and volunteer to take part ( self recruiting polls ) . 
  you 're not answering the question correctly though . 
  the poll that showed the sd as the second largest party was the latest poll ( you can tell from the dates on your diagram ) . 
  what / u/frankeh was asking for was a comparison between their results in the polls prior to the election and their actual election results . 
  this is an analysis of how they performed at the polls vs how they performed in the last election : http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lksyrmz5xzc/vhlw9lkbhyi/aaaaaaaacc8/sztfkwrhmj4/s1600/sd.png the broken line at the top is their election day result and the various dots are their results in polls prior to the election . 
  do n't worry i get that i was just making the point that even we who speak the language ca n't really draw any conclusions of what is being shouted because of the poor quality . 
  because the phone mic is n't picking it up properly you ca n't clearly hear what is being shouted and because human brains like to see patterns and fill in blanks with their own information people are going to hear what they want to hear . 
  just like the guys who clearly heard the charlie hebdo shooters speak in russian ( some even claimed specifically russian with an chechnyan accent ) . 
  i 'm not saying that he is not shouting allah akbar i 'm just saying that it is too muddled to hear it because our sensory organs and our brains are not as perfect as our sensory organs and our brain would like us to believe . 
  did n't you hear ? 
  the source was a knowledgeable person . 
  he 's like the best source in the world . 
  how can you be the little brother to your kid ? 
  i 'm no doctor but that ai n't normal norway . 
   people say you can hear him screaming allahu akbar no you ca n't really hear that in this clip . 
  do n't make the same mistake that those guys who heard the charli hebdo shooters shouting in russian made ... 
  the first guy wanted it to be russians so then everyone , from people who were native speakers to non russian speakers , `` heard '' that they were shouting in russian . 
  then it turned out that the perpetrators were french algerians and not russians special forces . 
   many swedes said stuff like `` nobody really cares because the bombs wo n't hurt anyone '' . 
  correction . 
  rich swedes who do n't have to live in these shitholes say that . 
  i 've heard it before and i 'm not buying it . 
  ok then . 
  the truce of altmark gives all estonian and latvian clay to us russian occupation of swedish territories was illegal which makes your independence illegal . 
  not our finest moment and it seems no one really knows why it was done because the people involved were very quiet about the process around this decision . 
  i 'm just glad that at least civilian refugees were not extradited . 
   but sweden , really - being oppressed by russians and happy about it rather makes you eurasian not baltic . 
  you read that the wrong way around mate . 
  he 's talking about sweden using russian pows as labour thereby oppressing russians .
