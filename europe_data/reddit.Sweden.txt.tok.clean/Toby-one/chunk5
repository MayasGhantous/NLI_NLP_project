  so how big part of that 20 % of rape suspects come from 3 % of population ? 
  that would be an interesting and useful bit of statistics but i doubt we 'll see it anytime soon . 
  because considering that even if we just divide the finnish population into immigrants and non-immigrants we still get 11 % of the population making up 20 % of rape suspects i 'm going to assume that those 3 % of immigrants are overrepresented among suspected rapists . 
  i always mix up colorado and wyoming but then again i was never really into hockey .

  probably wo n't show up again until he graduates . 
  turkey did n't abstain they did n't vote . 
  abstain is one of the three options when voting and `` did not vote '' means that they did n't even abstain . 
  `` did not vote '' usually means that the representative was not there at all . 
  the jutes only settled a small area in south east england . 
  the saxons only settled in south england and the angles did settle parts of the blonde belt of britain but that was also the place where the vikings landed and raided and also settled . 
  http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/britain_peoples_circa_600.svg http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/england_878.svg although the historical sources call all vikings danes so we do n't really know how much of this is denmarks doing and how much is sweden and norways doing . 
  contrary to popular belief swedish viking did not just move east and norwegian vikings did not only settle iceland , greenland and the americas and the danish vikings did not exclusively pillage the british isles . 
  either way from all of us in scandinavia : you 're welcome . 
  if we are talking about the same incident they were identified as russian bombers by raf typhoons . 
   and since a tu-95 has three radar warning receivers they should be rather aware if they 're being tracked by a radar . 
  yes but even if you are being tracked by radar you can still sneak around and pretend that you are something other than a russian bomber by not emitting any signals . 
   transponder not being used might indeed just be a case of wanting to cause disruption and stir up a fast military response . 
  after all , is n't one of their intents to do air defence penetration testing ? 
  yes . 
  but that begs the question why have they suddenly started flying aggressively against other countries airspace ( well i guess we already know the answer to that question after their invasion of ukraine ) but it is still very inappropriate to fly with transponders turned off in other peoples air information zones . 
   however there 's still quite a bit of difference whether we 're trying to spot a commercial airliner or an eurofighter typhoon in the said dark room . 
  not if they appear in your blind spot , or if the radar is turned off , or if the radar is set to a search pattern that does n't cover the sky in an effective way , then the approaching airliner will be just as invisible as an approaching typhoon . 
  the flashligh analogy is very appropriate because the radar is just a narrow cone scanning in front of the aircraft and when you look in one direction/altitude you will not be able to see what is in another direction/altitude . 
   but on the other hand , they 're russians . 
  they have a habit of doing similar things even without political agenda . . 
  the russian military does n't do stuff without having a political agenda . 
  they still place great weight on the teachings of sun tzu and von clausewitz incessantly at their military colleges therefore their military leadership well understands that the role of the armed forces is to be an extension of the countrys policy . 
  their leaders probably know this better than western leaders . 
  if they are flying with their radars on then that defeats the point of flying with their transponders off as any military air defense network will be able to classify it as a russian bomber . 
  also air scanning radar is like scanning a dark room with a very narrow flashlight . 
  yes you might see the low hanging lamp 2 meters in front of you but you 'll still stubb your toe on that dumbbell you left on the floor . 
  also everyone will see you pointing your flashlight everywhere . 
  the point of flying with the transponder off is to make it difficult for other militaries to classify the aircraft as a russian bomber . 
  it would be extremely odd for them to fly like that i mean that is something that could only serve the purpose of disrupting/terrorising civilian air traffic . 
  they do sometimes fly with awacs coverage and that still does n't change the fact they they tend to get a lot closer than international air regulations allow . 
  so obviously they are either not using their radars or they are simply being children trying to disrupt civilian traffic . 
  there are a lot of reasons why modern military air traffic tries to not just rely on individual aircrafts own air scanning radars ( basically radars are n't magic all seeing eyes ) and there are a lot of reasons why having a full picture of the situation in the air is paramount to both civilian and military air safety . 
  well russian bombers flying over you might be considered threatening . 
  the germans during ww2 really never had any way to push irish policy but if the russians send a fleet of aircraft your way they could dictate ultimatums . 
  do n't make the swedish mistake of believing that the eu is a defensive alliance becuase they have already pointed out that the mutual defence clause of the eu does n't actually bind any nation to provide military aid to a fellow eu country that is under attack . 
  as for the protection of neutrality ask denmark , norway , finland , and the baltics how that worked out in 1939-1940 . 
  all of those countries were neutral in ww2 ... 
  everyone is thinking like that and now people are very slowly starting to realise that if everyone thinks like that then no one is really safe . 
  `` who is going to protect us ? 
  germanys 4 armoured batallions ? '', 
  closed the borders but we have n't finished processing the 160 000 asylumseekers that arrived last year . 
  that will probably take years and even if we find that 60-80 000 ( a number picked out of thin air btw ) asylum seekers do n't have reasons to apply for asylum it would take decades for the overburdened border police to deport them back to were they came from ( probably not denmark because sweden wants to keep what little goodwill we still have with out neighbours ) . 
  us military presence is a major stabilising factor in several parts of the worl ( including europe right now ) and trump wants to reduce that presence . 
  trump would be the worst choice . 
  you ca n't see that the aircraft is flying clean until it is to late . 
  the us for all the shit they get are actully very disciplined and not the gung ho shoot everyone cowboys that people believe . 
  especially the [ us navy are kinda keen to avoid making international headlines again ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iran_air_flight_655 ) ... 
  maybe it was spam ? 
  oh so you 're not ignorant then ? 
  either way waiting until the 5th to report something so serious ... yeah no cover up ... what 's a few days of keeping people ignorant of important social issues going on in their country ? 
  also check that . 
  you 're a passive aggressive cunt . 
  also note that when you adjust for socioeconomic differances and such it only makes the problem invisible in the statistics it does n't actually make the problem go away . 
  in sweden immigrants commit about half of all violent crimes and if you adjust for factors like education socioeconomic status and such the crime rate among immigrants will drop but we still have the issue that roughly half the people serving long time prison sentences are immigrants and that the damage , pain and suffering that they have caused wo n't go away . 
  i think that has to do with the fact that the biggest immigrant groups in canada are asian . 
  in europe the general trend is that the first generation have a much higher crime rate while the second generation has a slightly lower than the first and the third is slightly lower than the second . 
  but we also find that there is a big difference depending on the country of origin . 
  the finnish police released a report a few years ago were they noted that asians tended to have a much lower crime rate than the native finns even when you adjusted for socioeconomic background . 
  no it was wednesday . 
  the source you link to says it was wednesday . 
  germany is n't exactly a far away third world country when something really shocking or bad happens it does n't take 2 days to show up in the telegraph . 
  if a 5 day media black out is n't a cover up then i do n't know what is . 
  or are you seriously suggesting that the mainstream media in the rest of the world are conspiring to tarnish the reputation of german media ? 
  you are either ignorant or you 're being a dishonest cunt . 
  they broadcast the news on wednesday which is 6 january that is the cover up lasted for 5 days for most of the mainstream media and 6 days for the zdf . 
   `` it 's a scandal that it took days for the media to pick up the reports , '' mr friedrich , who was angela merkel 's interior minister from 2011 to 2013 , said . 
  this is what all the scandal is about . 
  trying to make it sound like it was just one newsday is very dishonest of you . 
  that is the same helicopter that the navy bought to use for asw operation and then it turned out that it is to weak to carry asw equipment ... and the army bought it to fly with it or something ... 
  yes . 
  the problem is that the people who decides on what to buy for government agencies are civil servants who are appointed by politicians . 
  and the politicians tend to promote and appoint people who are loyal ( not just to the party but to the ideology ie a yes-man ) over someone who is competent or experienced . 
  a police officer recently wrote an opinion piece in a newspaper were he pointed out that almost all police chiefs in sweden are civil servants who have no formal training or experience in police work . 
  they got their jobs because they were loyal and had the right ideas not because they knew how to fight crime and keep the peace . 
  they used to be really good , not perfect , but at least they were n't complete shit like they 've been for the last decade . 
  back in the old days when we bought something that needed to work no matter what , like rescue helicopters , we 'd announce a competition and we 'd collect a bunch of helicopters from different manufacturers who were bidding on the contract and then we 'd perform extensive testing and decide who wins the contract . 
  in this case they , apparantly , just decided that no matter who performed best in the competion a certain italian manufacturer was supposed to win the contract . 
  i think this is the 3rd or 4th contract that this company has been awarded from the swedish state for a helicopter that is absolutely useless . 
  if i did n't know any better i 'd have thought that someone was being bribed ... 
  the person you responded to mentions neither germany nor media . 
  you mentioned german media so i figured i should contrast that since germany is n't the only place were the cologne events made big headlines . 
  and it definitely is n't the only place were this is discussed . 
  no but you ca n't make the claim that it is just a local german issue that is n't talked about outside of germany now can you . 
  i 'd expect some sort of information since there has been reports in international media that only 2 or 3 of the identified k\u00f6ln perpetrators were asylum seekers . 
  this is n't a german subreddit . 
  you lost [ that war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_war_ii ) remember ? 
  current top stories in swedish media : ** truck trailer is hanging of a bridge ** ** cars crashed off a different bridge killing an entire indie pop band - police now suspects there wassomething wrong with the cars ** ** swedish maritime administration bought a new sar helicopter - does n't work in cold weather ** ** at least 50 cats have been tortured and killed in london ** ** singer from bataclan - `` everyone must carry guns '' ** then there are some soft stories interspered that do n't have any sort of news value what so ever but hey you need to generate those clicks if you want to stay in business these days . 
  nothing about cologne . 
  like it or not here in reality every country on earth has a finite amount of resources . 
  just like ponds have limited resources . 
  for example in some parts of sweden hpv vaccinations are no longer given to highschool girls because the local clinic is far to busy doing work for the local asylum center .
