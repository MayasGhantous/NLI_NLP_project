  uk seem a bit . . reluctant . 
  wonder how long before a european reddit goes the same path as the swedish flashback forum and end up being completely dominated by rightwing keyboard warriors . 
  as petty of a concern it might be , if this would ever come to reality , please do n't call it united states of europe . 
  european union is a good name . 
  sweden is really sloping down on all these lists . 
  we used to be up on the top . . = / edit : oh hey there is a timeline . 
  we climbed up 2 levels since 2012 !, 
  woop !, 
  if such a vote would pass , i wonder how it would affect the exchange between norway and sweden . 
  i hate everyone . 
  leave my cottage alone you weird arrows or i will send letters to the usa !, 
  yes , [ i think i do mind . 
  ] ( http://blogs.wsj.com/brussels/2013/09/14/visitors-beware-lithuanias-unorthodox-approach-to-tourism/ ), 
  it 's an ok ale too . 
  was confused by the ukrainian flags there for a moment . 
  lots of people with nothing better to be aggravated about than the shapes of candy . 
  i suppose that 's both positive and negative . 
  same family as [ eric von rosen ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eric_von_rosen ) , who gave the finnish air force its second ( or first , it 's some dispute ) aircraft - against the will of the swedish government ( he got fined 100 swedish crowns for leaving the country ) . 
  his mark was a swastika , which he painted on the aircraft given . 
  thus , the finns adopted the symbol for their own airforce ( though they had to change it after second world war ) . 
  i honestly feel that ** gustav ii adolf ( gustavus adolphus ) ** should be mentioned as well , as far as warrior kings go . 
  * `` gustavus adolphus was an extremely able military commander . 
  his innovative tactical integration of infantry , cavalry , logistics and particularly his use of artillery , earned him the title of the ` father of modern warfare ' . 
  * * future commanders who studied and admired gustav ii adolf include napoleon i of france and carl von clausewitz . 
  his advancements in military science made sweden the dominant baltic power for the next one hundred years . . '' * from the [ wikipedia page ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gustavus_adolphus_of_sweden ) . 
  it lasted until the defeat and death of [ ** karl xii ( carolus rex ) ** ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oay9by9xrtk ) , another king who is quite well known and among the great warrior kings , even though he marked the end of the swedes as a major european power in the north , replaced completely by the russians . 
  stealing our glory . 
  not really all that strange if you consider that people also believe there is an all powerful man looking down on us from the sky deciding our lives . 
  if you can believe that , why not fickle and chaotic small elves in the ground who cause mischief and bad luck if you disturb them . 
  say for example pissing on the ground without stomping trice to warn them first and things like that . 
  oh , and . . scandinavian elves in folklore are more what people would consider fairies . 
  its not legolas who jumps out and curses your family , though that would be exciting . 
   finland would not be part of such a union i think because it is much more different from the nordics than the others ( language ... even history ) . 
  actually , sweden has more in common with finland than swedes have with danes or even norwegians in some parts . 
  only barrier is the finnish language , but need to remember that a large part of finland still speaks swedish . 
  they were one and the same country for a very long time . 
  it 's not at all noticeable on the surface , but if you look closer into it ( which several documentaries and such have , probably most recently * suomi on ruotsalainen * did , with some controversy mostly originating from the choice of title ) you will start to find far more , beyond just language . 
  finland might be the eastern most nordic country , but its still very much nordic . 
  two finns sit down to drink kossu by the campfire . 
  one of them raises his drink and says `` cheers . '', 
  the other one stares him down . 
  `` are we here to talk or to drink ? '', 
  adorable .

  how do you sink it again ? 
  swim down , knock on the hatch . 
  they will open up to tell you `` we wont fall for that twice ! '', 
  two norwegians were driving during the night when the driver begins to worry that something is wrong with his blinkers . 
  he asks his friend to go out and check on them . 
  his friend agrees and as soon as they pulled over , he walks out and walks over to look at them . 
  `` its working ! . . 
  not working . . 
  working ! . . 
  not working . . 
  working ! . . 
  not working . . '' same two norwegians were driving a lorry which was about 2 1/2 meters tall . 
  as they drive they are faced with a tunnel , on which it says `` max height , two meters . '', 
  the two men look at each other , and one asks to the other ; `` do you see any policemen ? '', 
  the second shakes his head . 
  `` then let 's go ! '', 
  a swede and a norwegian ends up in a traffic collision . 
  it is clearly the norwegain 's fault and the swede walks out of his car absolutely furious . 
  even more so when i realise that while his car is quite banged up , the norwegians car managed to survive without any real damages . 
  `` look what you have done !, 
  my car is ruined ! '', 
  yells the swede at the norwegian , who now exits his car . 
  the norwegian looks at the two cars . 
  `` well at least mine made it . '', 
  this is too much for the swede to take , and he picks up a heavy metal piece that once was connected to his car , and draws a circle around the norwegian . 
  `` you will stay in the circle , or i will beat you senseless . 
  do you understand ? '', 
  the norwegian says he understands , after which the swede begins to bash the norwegian 's car with the metal piece . 
  after a few hits he looks to the norwegian and yells , `` do you see what i am doing with your car !? '', 
  the norwegian smiles and nods . 
  `` yes i see . '', 
  the swede , puzzled by the smile , continues to bash at the mans car , and soon looks to him again . 
  this time the norwegian is laughing . 
  `` do you see what i am doing to your vehicle !? '', 
  the norwegian nods . 
  `` yes i see ! '', 
  he continues to bash at the car , only to be halted by the norwegians laughing . 
  he turns to him , confused , and asks `` i am destroying your car , why are you laughing !? '', 
  the norwegian wipes his eyes . 
  `` yes , i see that you are destroying your car , but while you did that , i left the circle ** three ** times ! '', 
  i am sure being the imperialists of scandinavia for a few hundred years had nothing to do with it . 
  looks better this year though , the buildings around got more decoration . 
  been there !, 
  there was a great medieval-ish restaurant there during the summer . 
  oh , and antique shops selling soviet stuff around every corner . 
  well , they say . . poorer the country , wilder the parties . 
  do n't think anyone can tell for certain when it comes to `` what if . . '' scenarios . 
  too many variables and reactions involved . 
  though it 's a fun thought . 
  i really really like sm\u00e5land nr 1477 . 
   it is doubtful that the u.s. pirate party will emulate their european counterparts with a similar stunt on home soil -- life is just too precious . 
  during winter , every single car got skis on the roof . 
  you know , so that if they flip over they wont be late for their appointment . 
  i think . 
  mjeh i am not sure i like this . 
  i mean , i do n't want the innocents to be caught in the crossfires of the war , an asylum for the duration of the unrest is completely reasonable .
