  but i do not trust that the government has taken the steps needed for this to work smoothly . 
  though it 's not an official anthem , i love [ flower of scotland ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnkkn-djxt8 ) . 
  especially if they bring in bagpipes and sing it in gaelic . 
  it 's also a quite recent song , presented in 1967 , which is quite cool . 
  lettland in swedish , so almost the same . 
  aye well , technically it was quelling of a rebellion rather than an invasion , since norway had already been renounced by denmark in favour of sweden , in exchange for swedish pommeria . 
   if you read some post-napoleonic war literature , you will see how the authors tried to cope with the loss of norway . 
  sounds a bit like when sweden lost it 's then eastern half , finland . 
  there is a tale that saint erik saw a golden cross in the sky against the blue sky when he landed on the first crusade in finland . 
  this lacks any real sources though , even the actual crusade is questioned to have happened if i remember correctly . 
  yet again the same scenario as with the nationalization of lands appear . 
  if it is okey to strip the royal family of their lands due to the history of the monarchs of england , from times where values were held very differently , what other claims would then be completely justified on the same basis ? 
  would a sami claim to lappi be so absurd then ? 
  and you would only have to keep going backwards in said vast piles of documentation to find new and new claims to different areas , treasures , properties and symbols . 
  in cases of peasant revolts , most certainly . 
  those do n't tend to happen in europe anymore . 
  now days it would most probably be far more of a legal process , and incredibly complicated one at that . 
  doubt the lands would be completely nationalized , unless there were some grand scandal and abuse from said monarch involved . 
  and if you can strip the royal family of their private holdings , what is to stop that from being done to other land owners ? 
  big to small ? 
  if the country is n't socialist , this would go against the ideology of the government and people who voted them in . 
  and even then , where do you make the distinction from who 's land you can nationalize for the good of the masses ? 
  i do n't know if the spanish monachy has any power , the swedish one certainly does n't . 
  how ever , i took it as if he talked about the expenses of the royalty , which is often an argument brought up against monarchies and why they should be removed . 
  at least the british monarchy is also a large landowner , but ( simplified ) give their gainings from that to the state in exchange for a salary of sorts , meaning that in the end the give more to the kingdom than they take . 
  [ cgpgrey explained it quite well . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhyygnhhkfw&amp;list=spqs5ohhass_qztskx06dmwoaeaadwmw_d&amp;index=33 ), 
  monarchies are a bit subjective to which monarchy you mean .

  hungary is part of the european union . 
  has there been any discussion among the other states , at significant levels , concering this ? 
  hardly heard anything about it at all here in sweden . 
  i thought helsinki was built as a result of sveaborg ( suomenlinna ) ? 
  fortresses tend to attract settlements . 
  red alert theme kind of ruins it , to be fair . 
  no , i mean the italian courts when he asked for financial support , hence he went to the spanish crown . 
  the fact that people today find some kind of odd sense of patriotism in him is another thing . 
  did n't the italians deny him ? 
  even if he was italian himself . 
  naturally , it is not hard to understand why they did it . 
  but personally i do n't feel it justifies it . 
  i would probably speak of [ certain actions during the civil war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_civil_war#bitter_legacy ) , if i were to talk about anything from the history of finland which can be portrayed as shameful , with about 13000 dead in prisoncamps alone . 
  [ baltutl\u00e4mingen ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_extradition_of_baltic_soldiers ) , i would say . 
  after the second world war sweden handed over about 150 baltic soldiers to the soviet union , to almost certain death . 
  utter spineless cowadice from the swedes . 
  oh yeah , this is totally related to antisemitism . 
  it has to be , what ill can anyone feel about the glorious and perfect nation of israel ? 
  you often see people from outside europe who seem to think that the eu is a country in the sense the us is , and that it has a dominant culture . 
  this article kind of plays on that , considering that there are probably more difference between a portuguese and a romanian than there are between an englishman and an american . 
  making a list like this would require a lot of variables to come closer to the truth . 
  probably from the american side as well , since the states have cultural differences , though not to the same degree as the european nations . 
  honestly , dubai is probably the coolest city i 've been in . 
  it 's like a mix of gotham city and something from a sci-fi movie with people in dresses . 
  it 's such a shame the people are so backwards , else it would be an incredible place in more ways than just architecture . 
  stupid abba . 
  the swedes are the only ones with an exception on the ban of creating and trading snus * ( snuff ? 
  ) * , though !, 
  finland had a careful relationship with the soviet union back in the day . 
  completely understandable since they did not wish to end up in another war with the giant nextdoor . 
  how ever , this did not exactly create any great friendship with the us at the time , who would rather see allies serving their interests all across the board . 
  the cold war is over and wounds are almost healed , but , i think finland still wishes to tread carefully when it comes to foreign policy around the us . 
  no doubt it 's still a delicate matter on the political and bureaucratic front . 
  yes !, 
  the finnish guy said it in finnish and swedish !, 
  that makes me happy , respecting the minority . 
  honestly , the major parties are not all that good at the whole internet thing . 
  their websites reflect very much those of companies and organisations . 
  their `` buisness plan '' , most important people , some pretty pictures and so on . 
  it 's easier and far more time efficient to get these parties views from tv and newspapers rather than visiting their websites . 
  smaller parties , especially controversial ones , are far more rooted into the internet culture of anonymous chats and forums , and their websites tend to reflect that . 
  they wo n't get media coverage unless they do something outrageous , so they have to find alternative ways to extend their views . 
  the largest swedish discussion forum , flashback.org , political part has very much been hijacked ( or at least used to be ) by far-right influenced people , which quite reflect the way they extend their views . 
  in the end it comes down to weighing what is worth it and minimizing the risk of it being exploited . 
  good answer , thanks . 
  yep . 
  but when it comes to things that can do as much harm as it can do good , it 's good to be paranoid . 
  well that 's not quite true . 
  it was quite an outrage inside of sweden and discussion in the other nordic countries , since these are the ones which will be affected the most . 
  so to say that no one cares is quite a false statement . 
  if swedish companies had servers of the magnitude that google and microsoft does , i am sure many would care across the union , but since sweden do n't have it ( at the moment ) , it did n't create any major concern . 
  simply because so few are directly affected by it . 
  quite the contrast from the prism situation , where most people are using microsoft and google all the time . 
  it 's not so much about what the current gouverment does with it . 
  you may be okey with them doing it and trust them . 
  but they wont be removed , and what the unknown gouverments of the future may use them for is the big issue . 
  it 's the same in sweden with the fra-law . 
  once a law is passed it is very difficult to get rid off . 
  though we might trust our current gouverment , no one is to say what the future gouverments might use it for and how the situation in the world looks then . 
  i thought i would reply on the swedish part of your argument , just to make things a bit more clear . 
  there are major differences between fra ( f\u00f6rsvarets radioanstalt , swedish ) and prism . 
  i 've to run to work , else i would have translated it for you , but i felt i had to drop this here since i do not feel that you can compare fra and prism in the manner done here . 
  i hope that google translate is sufficient for now , i will try to find the other ( better ) article once i 've time . 
  to quote itzhak skenstr\u00f6m , austria - golden land of culture , and fascism !, 
  roughly translated , of course . 
  to be honest , my main concern with this is that our politicians will now use this to say empty words and draw attention away from pressing issues within the county . 
  the important calls are all controversial . 
  there are many views and different people who will be affected differently , thus , since they want to remain in power and keep getting massive paychecks for their work , this is an excellent opportunity of gaining a lot without really doing anything at all . 
  simply saying `` america spying on you is bad ! '', 
  is a win-win situation for them . 
  though i am fairly certain they would find another way to avoid doing what is needed anyhow .
