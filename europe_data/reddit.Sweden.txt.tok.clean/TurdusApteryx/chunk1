some swedish political parties are critical of the eu , but supports it because they see it as a good thing on the whole . 
  keep the union , but change it to make it work better . 
  i did n't say i do n't , i only said i do n't like this particular kink !, 
  for me , mostly amused . 
  i 've never been very into tom of finlands drawings . 
  the men are way too macho for me , though i appreciate him as a part of lgbtq-history . 
  and moomins creator was a lesbian !, 
  ( i do n't know if that 's how she would have identified herself , but she had a girlfriend ), 
  meanwhile , the swedish word `` n\u00e5 '' has not reached this level of versatility ... 
  it 's nice to see a comment on the internet that says something nice about a politician they do n't agree with . 
  maybe he understands timezones so badly he got jetlaged from her visit ? 
  as much as trump tweets , we ca n't be 100 % sure that erdo\u011fan is n't a redditor !, 
  but i 'm bisexual , so i 've cunningly escaped your stereotype !, 
  i 'm feeling a streisand effect here ... 
  i was n't going to watch it because i 'm not that into disney movies , but i 'm all for pissing of some homophobes . 
  no , no . 
  currently , the gay agenda is to turn matt damon gay and for me to have sex with him . 
  but i 'm not gay ofcourse ... 
  it 's just for science ... to make sure he 's really gay !, 
  sure , every little bit to help my slightly inconvenienced middleclass existence through these not-very-troubled times , is appreciated, 
  [ this page states ] ( http://www.metro.se/artikel/h%c3%a4r-%c3%a4r-sanningen-bakom-statistiken-f%c3%b6r-v%c3%a5ldt%c3%a4ktslandet-sverige-xr ) that this is a misinterpretation of statistics . 
  one example that is mentioned in the article is that if a woman in sweden is raped 100 times , then that counts as 100 rapes , while other countries might have other ways of interpreting data . 
  if a man rapes the same woman 3 times during the same week , that might be seen as one incident if the man knows the woman well and frequently rapes her , or be seen as three separate incidents as the act happened three times . 
  so it depends on how you look at it . 
  there is also the fact that a country that has 10 000 cases of rapes , with 5000 of those reporting to the police , will look different to one that has 7000 with 6000 reported . 
  ( i have no idea if those are realistic numbers , i pulled them out of my ass for the sake of making a point ), 
  i 've now got 300 first world problems thanks to this disaster !, 
  i have n't had a latte in hours !, 
  alduin has returned and trump is the only one who is reporting on it !, 
  our prime minister has failed us and now we 're being attacked by dragons !, 
  please send help , and ingredients for more meatballs and semlor !, 
  no one takes finland without sweden looking very angrilly at the invaders !, 
  not like we 're in any position to do much about it , but we will not like it !, 
  scotland belongs to the nords !, 
  this is why sk\u00e5ne and bohusl\u00e4n rightfully belongs to sweden !, 
  when denmark had it , it just looked silly . 
  now sweden is a nice , penis-shaped peninsula !, 
  not now , reddit is watching !, 
  it seems to be a study of stereotypes . 
  it 's how each country views others , it 'd be pretty unfair to judge everyone in a country as arrogant or not arrogant , or trustworthy or not trustworthy . 
  i know of one greek who lives in sweden . 
  though i 've never thought to ask if maybe she thinks she 's in germany !, 
  i 'm guessing most countries see the people of their capital as more arrogant . 
  i 'm curious how it 'll affect other monarchies if they leave . 
  in sweden , many people are sort of against it , but not so much that it 's a big issue . 
  many still support it though , and thinks it 's an important part of our culture . 
  what is it that people like about her ? 
  i know practically nothing about her apart from being the chancellor . 
  but she 's won an impressive number of elections in a row , has n't she ? 
  i see . 
  atleast he seems sane !, 
  no , that grain is a known provider of fake news !, 
  do not trust the grain of salt !, 
  i like that it also looks a bit like it should be pronounced simillar to the swedish word for `` raisin '' ( russin ) . 
  everyone is protesting the countrys lack , or abundance of , raisins ? 
  and with that kind of joke , * you * must be from g\u00f6teborg !, 
  in the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy it 's said earth is a computer . 
  that 's clearly why someone mannaged to unplug london . 
  that was a joke based on the fact that they seemed to take such tiny steps while goose-stepping has really big steps . 
  they 're trying needlessly hard not to [ goose-step ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/goose_step#association_with_dictatorship ), 
  ca n't say i mind , in this mans case !, 
  [ stockholm also has its intergalacting protection ready !, 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/globen_september_2014_02.jpg/250px-globen_september_2014_02.jpg ), 
  i think this might be the first time i 've seen her smile . 
  before she goes to bed she says to herself `` donald ... paul ... mike ... reince ... '' . 
  a woman has made a list ... 
  and the 90s wants their gay stereotypes back !, 
  it would n't be weird at all if one of them told trump to `` f off '' , as it were ? 
  my dad is the same age and is learning a lot . 
  sure , my dad is learning photography , trump is failing to learn how to be a decent human being , so it 's not quite the same thing . 
  malm\u00f6 has no king . 
  they are an anarcho-syndicalist commune and take turns to act as a sort of executive officer for the week, 
  that 's what all that `` last night in sweden '' - debacle was about . 
  someone was rumoured to have said something nice about denmark . 
  all fake news , ofcourse, 
  you 're saying that it simply makes me swedish ? 
  and when is he going to meet stefan l\u00f6fven ? 
  as a swede i am obligated to care about the fact that denmark might have done better in the handshaking-contest than us , simply by the fact that we 're not in it yet !, 
  i completely ignore the concept of alphas or betas ... 
  i 'm not sure what that makes me . 
  perhaps it 's one of those weird people who do n't follow the madness that goes on in the white house !, 
  the enemy of trump is my friend ... 
  but trump is his own enemy so he 's also my friend ... 
  but he 's also my enemy ... 
  i 'm happy i live in a country where , while i 'd rather have a different prime minister , i atleast respect our current one . 
  he 's not my first option , but he 's not even close to trump-level bad . 
  i do n't agree with everything obama did as president , but after that job he 's definitely earned a vacation . 
  [ we 've noticed ] ( http://ll-media.tmz.com/2017/02/07/0207-obama-branson-primary-01-1200x630.jpg ), 
  if king louis xv can have an official mistress , so can macron !, 
  the kind of love that can only be felt between germany and france !, 
  he could hire me !, 
  there is exactly one french person who knows me !, 
  sure , i have no political experience , but i am very unknown in france !, 
  [ ai n't no party like a macaron-party !, 
  ] ( https://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/recipes/images/3/3f/macarons.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20121210174704 ) i just wanted to make that joke ... no , i do n't feel very proud of myself . 
  it will turn out they 're kang and kodos and regardless of result , france will be enslaved by green slimey aliens !, 
  thanks , i guess it 'll have to do . 
  had someone told me there would be dicks , i would have brought condoms !, 
  i guess i 'll have to improvise ... 
  i do n't want to be the `` you ca n't trust the polls '' - kind of person , but i still do n't want to be too hopeful ...
