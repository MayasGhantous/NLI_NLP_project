  do n't be silly it 's a fact that most ( more or less all ) beggers in sweden are ethnically roma from romania . 
  i do n't hate them and i doubt user fhmange does either . 
  [ hhnngg ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhhllcnipec ) [ h-hhnnnhh ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7h0he5us_qg ), 
  i would say stockholm or \u00c5lesund in scandinavia, 
  no only london and oxford . 
  i do n't think they bother , they suddenly become very lgbt aware when the muslim community is the one discriminating but otherwise i honestly do n't think they care much . 
  with `` some swedes '' they mean an african-swedish rapper who is going on about a lot of imagined slights against minorities . 
  the vast majority of swedes like finland just as it is , maybe with less alcohol and knifes but you know . 
  - tough on crime - support the `` traditional swedish culture '' - strengthen the welfare state - lower taxes ( they can afford to both this and above if they cut immigration costs ) - conservative values like family life and such, 
  you know all these `` quality-of-life '' or `` liveability '' indexes , they almost always put vienna in the top five . 
  now i 've never been but i think it looks nice , i can imagine the locals being a bit difficult though and i 've never even heard of austrian food but muslims are something you have to deal with all over the continent nowadays so . . 
  i 've been to london and thought it was clean , modern and friendly but i kept to the inner city i guess . 
  also been to oxford and i liked it honestly , there was a beautiful park next to grand old mansion and i saw a large rainbow through the light rain when i entered . 
  copenhagen , there were danish people * everywhere * . 
  seriously though i lived in brussels a while when i was a kid and i remember it as dirty ( in an icky kind of way ) , noisy , crowded , lousy weather and it looked kinda run down . 
  i remember i visited antwerpen though and thought it was such a nice city , especially the trains were very nice i thought . 
  recently had an election but the way things are looking the anti-immigration party ( sd ) will rival the two traditional `` state-bearing '' parties . 
  sd has been growing exponentially since 2002 and it would n't suprise me if they doubled their support again in 2018 . 
  i wonder how it turns out , any predictions ? 
  lol @ gothenburg having higher purchasing power than stockholm . 
  interesting otherwise , suprised at paris low ranking and i also thought trondheim would do even better , visited last week and it was great . 
  good riddance . 
  during the transatlantic migration the annual increase in us population from immigration was something like 0,7 % and that changed the country profoundly . 
  0,5 % every year might not sound like much , but it is . 
  a sizeable muslim minority has appeared in europe in a relatively short amount of time . 
  in a historical context the europeans are proving quite tolerant of their new inhabitants . 
  it 's sort of a satire though , the singer posts in the comments that he wanted people to reflect on how shallow todays youth is . 
  probably because europe is becoming progressively more racist . 
  we are neither east nor west it seems . 
  hopefully he gets rehabilitated . 
  should n't it be kind of in the middle of all four nations though ? 
  i 've thought the same thing actually . 
  [ it 's not your fault ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtkst5-zfhw ), 
  it 's an incompetent institute is what it is . 
  http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2fa%3a1008713631586 http://www.geocurrents.info/geography-of-crime-and-punishment/misleading-murder-and-rape-maps-and-the-the-sweden-rape-puzzle even if you dislike facts and understanding what statistics actually describe , you 'd think that it would be common sense that sweden is n't more violent than egypt or ethiopia . 
  also this notion that murder rates are low but apparently sexual crimes are the highest in the worls is ludicrous . 
  you finns should just grow up and come back home , your teenage rebellion is over - all is forgiven . 
  where would the capital be ? 
  we could build a new one , call it * scandium * or something . 
  oil prices will rise sooner or later . 
  norway has been very responsible with their resource generated wealth and they will remain the richest scandinavian country for the forseeable future . 
  there is no minimum wage in sweden , immigrants either get a job on the same conditions as a swedish worker ( high wages , extensive protecion , lots of benefits ) or they end up unemployed . 
  guess which ? 
  that 's the european project man , brings a fucking tear to my blue eye . 
  no i 've just had an upset stomach for the past week ( coincidentally since i upped-the-ante on my croissant consumption ) and i never knew why , thanks mate . 
  wtf , how did you know , seriously ? 
  heh , yeah those violent kind of strikes like the one in calais recently would be counterproductive in sweden . 
  the french lifestyle has its allure though , i eat at least three freshly baked croissants every morning . 
  thanks man . 
  that 's why the uk will be europe 's largest economy in one or two decades . 
  when using an absolute measurement [ sweden has the lowest poverty rate in the union ] ( http://www.scb.se/en_/finding-statistics/statistics-by-subject-area/living-conditions/living-conditions/living-conditions-surveys-ulfsilc/aktuell-pong/12209/behallare-for-press/living-conditions-survey-ulfsilc1/ ), 
  intriguing of course but politically impossible i 'm afraid . 
  we 're just a decade behind denmark , it 's more or less an inevitable development . 
   this section is based on surveys from visitors of this website . 
  do you have anything more robust than what people on one website claims ? 
  it 's surprisingly hard to find legit comparisons between countries . 
  i can read all about crime in sweden [ here ] ( https://www.bra.se/bra/bra-in-english/home.html ) or in [ this ] ( https://www.bra.se/download/18.5e2a4a6b14ab16675996b3/1422267858456/2015_1_crime_survey_2014_summary.pdf ) survey but i do n't know how to compare it with denmark or how to look at malm\u00f6 and copenhagen indivually . 
  anyway if you 're really driving the idea that sweden has something of a crime problem compared to denmark then i do n't buy it . 
  homicide is mostly comparable and the rate looks like [ this ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/e/e7/homicide_rate_per_100_000_population%2c_average_per_year%2c_2005-2007_and_2008-2010.png ) other offences are prone to local legal definitions and such . 
  i doubt it , what 's the source ? 
  not only that we actually file murder cases differently than other states , i got this from wikipedia :  studies of lethal violence in sweden have shown that more than half the reported cases were not actually cases of murder or manslaughter . 
  this is because the swedish crime statistics show all events with a lethal outcome that the police investigate . 
  many of these reported crimes turn out to be , in reality , suicides , accidents or natural deaths . 
  [ 23 ] [ 27 ] despite this statistical anomaly , sweden has an internationally low murder and homicide rate, 
  secular muslims are no more of a threat than secular christians . 
  religious fundamentalists that i can do without . 
  they work and pay taxes in norway no ? 
  norway has a lower tax level than us , fremskrittspartiet has its roots in the anti-tax movement . 
  muslims have had a pr problem since 2001 really . 
  so now the subreddit feed needs more victimized immigrants to balance things out ? 
  i think that 's a bit petty , why you got ta shrink to the xenophobes level ? 
  that 's more like it , got ta keep up appearances . 
  norway and denmark , finland is n't for everyone but especially the nature can be breathtaking and helsinki is nice . 
  what are germans doing about this , is the country satisfied with a shrinking population ? 
  that swedish women are much sexier than other countries . 
  they 're blonder , taller and quite well dressed other than that i have n't notied much difference in attractivness . 
  what are some of the hot issues in denmark right now ? 
  in sweden it 's : - immigration - welfare benefits ( as always ) - unemployment, 
  it varies between measurements , [ this ] ( https://www.google.se/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gnp_pcap_pp_cd&amp;idim=country:swe:nor:fin&amp;hl=sv&amp;dl=sv#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_pp_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:swe:nor:fin&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=sv&amp;dl=sv&amp;ind=false ) graph from the world bank shows how norway passed sweden in 1992 . 
  i 'm not informed enough to state any absolute conclusion though . 
  no i was n't aware, 
  large banking sector combined with a small population equals a lot of financial assets per capita . 
  really ? 
  i always thought norway was relatively poor by nordic standards before * olje\u00e4ventyret *,

  do n't ruin my sweg, 
  we 've become more or less immune from being exposed . 
  is n't he mocked in britain as well ? 
  get on our level , or you rather should n't actually, 
  this should be one of the things the eu could be able to fix , we certainly could use the economic boost of easier trade and an even more unified market . 
  so what does this mean , our elders work harder than anyone else 's ? 
  it 's the swedish way . 
  no but seriously if there is anything fucked up about this place it 's how the immigration has been handled but it 's not even close to being as bad as some morons would have you believe . 
  this rape thing for instance is utterly silly and it reeks of repressed cuckold fantasies being projected by some smelly neckbeard overseas . 
  they 're just projecting their own fantasies, 
  from uppsala, 
  what constitutes a sexual offence ( or even rape ) varies between countries , in sweden that stuff can cover a lot .
