  do n't think anything else . 
  i do n't know if you noticed but the riksbank has kept interest rates at * negative * values this year . 
  you think that * might * have had something to do with why the financial market is booming ? 
  yeah i got it but what 's your point ? 
  the last 8-9 years growth in productivity has been modest to say the least . 
  from 492,6 to 516,2 an annual growth rate of roughly 2 sek per hour worked -2 sek i could n't buy a gum for that money . 
  yeah you twat , [ we do ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_tko8nvkeo ) link is to a swedish presentation by [ this economist ] ( http://research.tino.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cv-2015.pdf ), 
  well come on link the entire page, 
  it 's not a bad choise either , there have been external shocks and lack of demand , which is troublesome for an export nation , but sweden has been less affected by the financial and euro debt crisis than most other european nations . 
  then it does n't mean that just because what you say is correct that there can not be other issues with the economy of sweden because there are . 
  both are true , the financial and later euro crisis have had an impact on sweden ( though much less so than most other european countries ) but that does n't mean there are n't other structural issues , imbalances and bad policies that hurt sweden . 
  is that productivity growth , swedish stats ? 
  the image has no legend . 
  true that all of the west has been experiencing weak growth in productivity but sweden has been especially bad - in particular since 2006 . 
  employment levels are too low and it takes years to achieve even that . 
  there is a large wage gap between foreign and native workers , in fact if we keep this level of immigration up the welfare system will collapse in maybe as little as a decade . 
  no realistic plan that is likely to succeed , our economy is the most knowledge intensive in the world and thus the most ill-suited for low-skilled labour . 
  read my other comments , if there is still something you wonder about then ask . 
  does n't matter 8 years with almost zero growth is very bad . 
  sweden was a robust economy at the beginning of the millenium but now things are not in such a good shape anymore and what things are still working well are riding on the aftermath of those reforms done in the 90 's . 
  but sweden need new reforms quick . 
  are you kidding me ? 
  the housing market is clearly not in balance . 
  property investments are about the worst kind of investments you could make in sweden right now . 
  and beneficial loan rates , do you honestly believe the riskbank will keep interest at * negative * 0.4 % ? 
  if the rates rise at the wrong time and the market crash what will sweden do ? 
  we 're quickly losing our public reserves since we stupidly decided to become the social bureau of the middle east , and with private debt at god knows how many times wealth and income it would be worse than the 90 's for us . 
  per capita growth has been [ average for the oecd ] ( http://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?datasetcode=pdb_lv# ) but considering sweden is usually in the top percents * and * we dodged the eurozone debt crisis that is * bad * . 
   you 're making far-fetched predictions based on nothing . 
  that our gdp per capita has stagnated is not a prediction boyo , it 's a * fact * . 
  why has n't it increased ? 
  because the increase in hours worked and productivity gains has not been on par with population growth , not exactly rocket science . 
  now low growth is indeed mostly due to external factors but population growth that 's 50 % migration at least buddy boy . 
  not to even mention unemployment , erosion of skills and public expenses that are negative side effects of an influx of low-skilled labour . 
   making such an ... `` analysis '' based only on the fact that private debt is increasing is just wrong . 
  i say that on the background of bad productivity growth , stagnated living standards , zero inflation with negative interest , insufficient infrastructure and then what does sweden have to look forward to ? 
  even if we dodge the housing bubble there is no plan * whatsoever * as to how the fuck we are supposed to successfully integrate hundreds of thousands of arabs into the economy that is the worst suited * in the world * to employ them especially since we 've had this kind of migration for 20-25 years and it has never ever worked out favourably . 
  well , most of europe is in a similar situation to be honest , especially the eurozone countries are having a hard time so we 're lucky we still have the good old krona . 
  still our productivity growth is below the oecd average , we 've got a scary housing market that might just crash , rising public expenses , insufficient infrastructure to cope with this scale of immigration , the riksbank is going crazy and running negative interest , zero inflation and in the future how will we integrate all these migrants ? 
  no one has any answers because it likelt can not be done . 
  edit - our growth has been [ average for the oecd ] ( http://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?datasetcode=pdb_lv# ) which is bad by swedish standards and that 's the only metric that should matter to us . 
  immigration does n't effect an economy in isolation , it does n't have nearly as much impact as things like productivity , consumption etc. 
  so you make a good point , it is very evident how similar the swedish , danish and german economies are performing which is in large part due to similar levels of competitiveness , productivity , diversity and such . 
  however this does not mean that the current immigration is n't an economic voe because it is . 
  the main issue is lack of human capital ( skill , language , knowledge of the corporate culture etc , ) that makes migrants from the middle east almost unemployable in a country like sweden which has * the * lowest number of low-skill jobs on the planet . 
  this will be a public expense that only will keep on growing as unemployment stabilizes on high levels but it will also mean that the number of working hours in the economy will grow slower than the population and more importantly productivity growth ( bnp per hour worked ) will suffer . 
  immigration is n't solely responsible for this there is weak demand from swedens trade partners , insfficient infrastructure and other external factors but it is an important part of it . 
  already swedish [ productivity growth is below the oecd average ] ( http://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?datasetcode=pdb_lv# ) and since productivity is what really determines growth in living standards in the long term this bodes ill for sweden . 
  will we keep up with germany , who admittedly has many of the same problems just not to the asme extent , or denmark who has handled this migrant business much better imo ? 
  it 's ridiculous to say that finland is doing badly because it has had little immigration and good pisa-results . 
  by that `` logic '' why is australia doing so well , they 've had barely any migrants and their school is functioning great ? 
  there is also the looming potential housing bubble to be concerned about , if it bursts what marginals does sweden have to mitigate the damage ? 
  op of this thread is trying to paint a rosy image but he does n't understand that sweden is not doing as well as he would like to imagine and he ignores very very basic economic principles that are taught in high school . 
  it does n't matter if the overall conomy grows if the population grows faster . 
  not adjusted for inflation, 
  just say the word what are you doubting exactly ? 
  [ here 's a simple graph from the world bank ] ( https://www.google.se/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_cd&amp;idim=country:swe:nor:dnk&amp;hl=sv&amp;dl=sv#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_pp_kd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:swe&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tstart=1196377200000&amp;tend=1417302000000&amp;hl=sv&amp;dl=sv&amp;ind=false ) as you can see there has been no gain in real gdp per capita when adjusted for inflation . 
  [ and here is another graph ] ( http://www.ekonomifakta.se/fakta/ekonomi/produktion-och-investeringar/produktivitetsutvecklingen-i-naringslivet/?graph=/17159/1/2007-/ ) where our stagnating productivity growth is painfully apparent . 
  finally [ here is a telling image on swedish debt ] ( http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user92183/imageroot/2015/11/swedenhouseholddebt_0.png ) straight from the riksbank . 
  enjoy . 
  edit - oops looks like i got downvoted even when providing sources . 
  i guess people just do n't want to know . 
  that means we lost 8 years , is that a good economic performance according to you ? 
  i did , got downvoted . 
  i do n't think misleading titles should reign supreme on this subreddit . 
  1 % over 7 years is a really bad trend , not that you 've posted a source for your claim ... also by what measurment , adjusted for inflation i assume ? 
  i do n't know the numbers for 2015 but as of december 2014 it had [ dropped 200 kr compared to 2007 ] ( http://www.ekonomifakta.se/fakta/ekonomi/tillvaxt/bnp-per-capita/ ) . 
  do n't look at quarter-to-quarter growth or even year-to-year-important economic trends happen over longer timeframes than that , our gdp per capita have barely increased at all since 2007 . 
  if it continous like this ( and i do n't see why it would change ) we 'll be facing a lost decade same as japan only they had a housing bubble and we have n't had one ... yet . 
  productivity growth is also pathetic and with these school results and the hundreds of thousands of unemployable migrants that is not going to get better any time soon - only worse . 
  also a lot of this growth is public spending ( due to migration ) which will only grow along with our private debt . 
  it 's not 2005 anymore , it 's not going well for sweden , not well at all . 
  edit - keep downvoting the truth , everything i said is easily verifiable, 
  do n't be ridiculous op , you know as well as i do this is due to a massive population increase of unskilled labour . 
  gdp per capita is developing like utter shit , the standard of living is going down the toilet . 
  edit - [ keep downvoting and it 'll all go away ] ( http://www.bankrattsforeningen.org.se/industrifonden/massmedia/sticker%20huvudet%20i%20sanden.gif ), 
  the current government is in a parlamental minority , the opposition ( a 4-party coalition and the odd sd party ) allows their laws to pass to ensure political stability . 
  neither coalition is strong enough to create a majority government without suppost of the sweden democrats , the centre-right or `` the alliance '' ( in ) famously decided to let the `` red-green '' coalition budget pass in the so called `` december agreement '' , since then the social democrats the the green party is running the country as a minority government . 
  it 's enacted by the government that currently runs the country , of course it 'll go through parlament . 
  [ lol ] ( http://i.imgbox.com/adln6exy.gif ) if you think there is any hope left . 
  i ai n't gon na pay 50 % tax to fund abdullah burning my car , i am outta here buddy boy . 
  it 's over boyo , we 're done, 
  [ we 're off that list for good . 
  ] ( http://media.giphy.com/media/fdzm81oyrnjjc/giphy.gif ) thanks leftists, 
  finns need to understand that no one outside of finland speak finnish - use english you drunk rednecks . 
  gdp per hour worked . 
  it 's true that it 's a bad bargain to sell off public companies right now but privatization initiatives in and of itself are long overdue in greece . 
  the market is always more efficient at running operations in the long run . 
  state-owned airports , docks and other infrastructure has contributed to keeping greek competitiveness and productivity below it 's eurozone peers . 
  and btw : if the political class in greece ( and other southern euro members ) is hopelessly corrupt then the logical course of action would be to shrink their influence i.e the size and control of the public sector . 
   if they get to the eu that means they are democratic country with working economy . 
  [ lol ] ( http://media.giphy.com/media/vg0jstydl8hcg/giphy.gif ), 
  ridiculous . 
  you know as well as i that europe have had a very poor recovery following the financial crisis 8-9 years ago , investors are still holding their money . 
  espcially the southern countries are facing economic harships as they are locked down in a destructive monetary union . 
  i do n't know if there can even be a recovery without monetary reform . 
  borders are fundemental to the sovereign nation state , without borders there will be chaos and the public knows this very well . 
  what systems are `` better '' than democracy , actually do n't answer that , i have no interest in entertaining your delusions any longer . 
  economic stagnation or depression , erosion of democratic influence and loss of border security . 
  competitive northern countries can enter a monetary and fiscal union , other european nations may peg their exchange rate to the new currency .
