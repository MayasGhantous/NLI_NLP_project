that 's incredibly skewed data - it only accounts for those born within sweden or outside of sweden . 
  / r/europe is not a unified entity . 
  i 'm pretty sure that the vast majority here have little idea what you 're talking about , and that a fair number that do , * do n't care * , since they 're europeans . 
  national socialists are third positionists , though . 
  there 's an enormous muslim minority in sweden , and arabic is about to overtake finnish as our second-largest minority language , despite the fact that finland and sweden are right next door to eachother and was the same country for ~ 800 years . 
  because over 20 % of our population is non-swedish . 
  * proceeds to label arterial bleeding as `` just a scratch '' . 
   yes because nearly everybody working retail is infact a swede that catches a lot of danes by surprise when they visit copenhagen yeah , sorry about that . 
  at the end of the day , though , you can always say ; * at least we 're not sweden . 
  it 's very common that countries in general have a disdain for the capital . 
  i know it 's the same in norway , and i can confirm that it 's the same in sweden . 
  i think there 's several reasons for that , but it basically boils down to centralization of power , cosmopolitan arrogance in the population in the capital , and urbanization . 
  honestly , having an urban capital is completely unnecessary in the 21st century . 
  decentralize the government and move the necessary infrastructure into some central ( to the country ) location out in nature . 
  urbanization is a plague . 
  the worst thing is that even i , a swede , can understand especially the danish disdain for copenhagen , because it 's not about copenhagen , but about the copenhageners . 
  they 've got the same basic attitude as stockholmers , adjusting for national character . 
  i 'm not a fan , but at least i can * speak * to them , as opposed to * you people * . 
  this . 
  this is the right attitude . 
  it 's the actual capital of greece ... did you mean * constantinople * ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ... reconquista ^ ^ ^ ^ soon, 
   anti-imperialist , and was much more different than nazi germany or mussolini 's italy , he has more in common with franco or salazar than with hitler . 
  i 'm not expert on metaxas or salazar , but i fail to see how those two things connect with eachother . 
  hitler was also strongly anti-imperialist . 
  mussolini , not so much . 
   1 a veterinarian some people should be beaten to death * extra * hard . 
  but if they do n't , they 're supporting the ever-more-reviled erdogan . 
  this is going to cause some form of syntax error , no doubt . 
  oooh , i ca n't wait to see how they 'll handle this , if at all . 
  ^ * grabs ^ chips *, 
  as a nationalist , trust me when i say that i personally * hate * how we 've become reliant on reactionary nonsense and lumped together with anti-vaxxers , anti-aborton hardliners and `` climate skeptics '' just to oppose eu and the liberal paradigm . 
  the fact that i have to admit to myself that * `` welp , guess i 'm supporting trump and the pis '' * drives me up the fucking wall . 
  i have literally nothing else to go on , other than the descriptions in / u/unclepedo 's post . 
  and in relation to that , yes , i 'm serious . 
  all the others sound like eu puppets or incredibly corrupt . 
  but again , i have literally nothing else to go on than a very small , brief summary by a likely biased source . 
  you should n't take it too seriously . 
   third positionism did n't even exist before ww2 . 
  yes it did . 
  of course it did . 
  the first half of the 20th century was almost * defined * by third positionist leanings , and all fascistoid ideologies expressly rejected both the left and the right . 
   dss/dveri - new-age right wingers trying to appear modern , but are fairly backwards and incompetent . 
  have some support among the unsatisfied youth , might get over the 5 % threshold because they have a somewhat new lineup and people are fed up with everything else . 
  anti-eu . 
  i 'm sad to say that even with you putting `` backwards '' and `` incompetent '' in there , they still sound better than all the others . 
  i 'm not sure what that makes me . 
  voting does n't matter , silly . 
  hofer 's biggest flaw is that he 's not literally hitler . 
  yeah , no . 
  as a swede that 's had extensive contacts with denmark for multiple reasons , i can say that while the public discourse in denmark is far more open than sweden or germany 's , their politicians are just as full of shit as any other . 
  again , not leftist . 
  not rightist either . 
  third positionist . 
  it is not that hard to grasp . 
  the fact that the political strategy changed was the application of realpolitik and propaganda , nothing else ; the ideals were always the same , and national-socialism * always * opposes both capitalism and marxism . 
  you need some serious redpilling . 
  third positionist . 
  how come that people still are so brainwashed they have no concept of what this is ? 
  this time , anschluss comes from the east . 
  they belonged to the austrian empire and later the austro-hungarian empire . 
  they did n't find themselves ruled by a non-german majority until the creation of czechoslovakia following the collapse in 1918 . 
   absolutely islam . 
  but by that definition , not fascism . 
  like i said , two different things . 
   which fascist movement was pro-west and did n't oppose the western systems ? 
  all of them . 
  they opposed parliamentary democracy , unregulated banking practices , marxist socialism , and so on - but to unequivocally label any of this * `` the west '' * is completely arbitrary , and done entirely so you can call \\ < insert whatever you do n't like politically \\  `` anti-west '' . 
  it 's no different than to label opposition to communism `` anti-eastern '' . 
  it 's silly . 
   adolf hitler = nazism  muhammad = islamism  these 2 persons have many common features being essential to their activities . 
  many people have many features in common essential to their activities ; there are no more `` common features '' between muhammad and adolf hitler than there is between adolf hitler and winston churchill , or adolf hitler and mahatma ghandi , or adolf hitler and josef stalin . 
  this is tinfoil-level reductio ad hitlerum . 
   corporativism is not necessarily a part of fascism . 
  it absolutely is . 
  the view of the nation as an organic entity , as an individual made up of the people within it , is integral and fundamental to all forms of fascist ideology , it 's ideas going as far back as kjell\u00e9n 's * the state as a living form * . 
  corporativism is * the * fascist solution in opposition to the despotic materialism of marxism and the false rule of incompetent democracy . 
  without it , or at the very least a derivative of it based on the same fundamental ideas , you can not even pretend that something is fascism . 
   i did n't say there is an ideological connection ( though there was a connection between nazis and islamists ) . 
  i 'm saying that the ideologies are alike . 
  the similarities are so pronounced that it 's basically fascism . 
  first of all , there was no `` connection between nazis and islamists '' . 
  the only `` connections '' that is brought up are the connections between the national socialists and various muslim groups ( grand mufti in jerusalem and ss divison handschar ) ; neither which were any more islamist than politically active christians . 
  furthermore , germany had allies * all over the world * and from nearly every creed and colour , including indians opposing british rule and black africans opposing colonialism . 
  the fact that they cooperated with arab nationalists that had been grievously betrayed by the british after being allied with them in ww1 should come as no surprise whatsoever . 
  secondly , * `` the similarities are so pronounced that it 's basically fascism '' * is complete hogwash , with nothing to back it up beyond * `` i think fascism is wrong . 
  i also think that x is wrong . 
  therefore , x is fascism '' * . 
  if you think that the ideologies are alike , you should have something to back that up beyond lumping things you think you do n't like together and arbitrarily labeling them . 
  stop using * `` fascist !, 
  '' * as a pejorative ; it is as silly as the leftists shouting * `` racist !, 
  '' * as anyone that questions islam , the right screaming * `` communist !, 
  '' * against national-socialist , or feminists shouting * `` misogony !, 
  '' * when someone questions the wage gap . 
  it 's childish , it 's objectively wrong , and it only serves to make people more ignorant and the state of politics needlessly polarized . 
   it 's not simply fascism , it is islamic fascism aka islamofascism . 
  it 's the fascist threat of the 21st century . 
  repeating it does not make it true . 
  islamism has nothing to do with any form of fascism whatsoever and i would go so far as to say that they are fundamentally incompatible on an ideological level . 
  islamism is not the fascist threat of the 21st century ; islamism is the muslim threat of the 21st century .
