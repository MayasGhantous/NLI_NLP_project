  it 's a recurring theme . 
  if i would make an analogy , i would compare it to the threat of marxism in early 20st century europe , but i 'd never go so far as to actually say something as ridiculous as `` islamomarxism '' - even though marxist leanings have been far more prolific in the region than actual fascism ( ghadaffi 's libya , afghanistan 's saur revolution , the kurdish pkk , etc ) . 
  because it would n't be true , because as much as i hate both marxism and islamism , and despite of how much one continue to excuse the actions of the other , they 're not related , and their ideologies are not alike . 
  they 're * all * different things ; with different tenets , different origins , different world-views , and different ideology . 
  there 's no reason to confuse them ; it 's alright to dislike any , all , or none of them . 
  separately . 
  and since we 're swapping literature : * [ political essays , alfred rosenberg ] ( http://www.amazon.com/alfred-rosenberg-political-essays/dp/b001rnctx0 ) . 
  * [ for my legionaries , corneliu zelea codreanu ] ( http://www.amazon.com/my-legionaries-iron-guard/dp/1593640005 ) . 
  * [ various , oswald mosley ] ( https://www.oswaldmosley.com/ ) . 
  the last link has the benefit of being free . 
  all of them should help you understand fascism beyond that of a slur . 
  there are heavier texts , and i 'd have more , but most of it is in swedish . 
   he 's a political scientist who studied politics in germany . 
  it is safe to say that the writer has more clue about what fascism and national socialism are than you . 
  i 'm sorry , but he simply does n't . 
  your attempt at appeal to authority falls flat . 
   he is also the son of a sunni imam and was a member of the muslim brotherhood . 
  so obviously he knows more about islam than you . 
  this is true , though , but i was n't talking specifically about islam , but about * islamism * being * fascist * , when few things could be further from the truth . 
   fascism and islamism ( the political part of islam ) are : first of all , it 's cute that you feel the need to clarify * `` the political part of islam '' * . 
  yes , we know , i already mentioned it several times , if you would 've taken the time to read . 
   * anti-liberal true , but this in no way implies a connection ; a lot of ideologies and/or religions are anti-liberal . 
   * anti-west islam ? 
  arguably , yes . 
  fascism ? 
  not even a little . 
  complete hogwash . 
   * totalitarian a matter of definition . 
  is fascism totalitarian by it 's own definition of totalitarianism ? 
  absolutely . 
  is it totalitarian in the common usage of the term as a political slur ? 
  not by a long shot . 
  islam , however , arguably is . 
   * militaristic absolutely . 
   * supporting political violence against political opponents/dissenters again , islam yes , fascism . . varies , but no more so than marxism or even monarchists . 
   the main common feature between national socialism and islam is that both were founded by genocidal warlords who created a `` it 's only self-defense '' myth to excuse aggression and gain power . 
  except national socialism . . was n't ? 
  i understand that you 're not a fan , but saying something does n't make it true . 
  again , stop trying to reduce terms to slurs and create flimsy guilt-by-association arguments based on erroneous labels . 
  it does n't do your `` argument '' any services . 
  it just becomes a form of reductio ad hitlerum . 
  to underline the sillyness of arguing that fascism = islamism , answer this question ; what 's the islamist or wahhabist relation to corporativism ? 
  how about the principle of * `` liberty in private , obligation in public life '' * as coined by mosley ? 
  how does islamism reconcile the conflict between opposition to globalism and internationalism with the idea of forced religious conversion of disparate nations and populations , joining them in a theocratic , imperial caliphate ? 
  even with a very * basic * understanding of fascism and/or national socialism at an ideological level , the ridiculous notion that there is some kind of ideological connection to islam as a religion or islamism as the political embodiment of that religion through the application of sharia is patently absurd . 
  want to desperately label islamism as something that is generally considered terrible ? 
  try theocratic , monarchical , oligarchal , tribal , despotic or just * crazy * . 
  but fascist , it is not . 
   i do n't think you can get in trouble for saying the truth . 
  in much of europe , you can , and definitely in turkey , considering that erdogan is a humongous cunt . 
  good . 
  this is the best kind of terrible . 
  please keep making a complete fool of yourself , erdowan . 
  i 'm a transprogressive heli-kin that sexually identifies as a cis fascist . 
  stop oppressing me . 
   most muslims in the world do n't know what a hindu or sikh is . 
  most muslims in the world are illiterate . 
  i 'm not saying that to slam islam , just to put the issues in perspective . 
  fairly well-educated people in northern europe know nothing about sikhism ( although many likely has some vague idea along the lines of * `` it 's some religion in \\ < the middle east or india \\  right ? '' * ) . 
  so the idea that religiously insular people with a generally low degree of education and a massive illiterate populace would know much about other religions is absurd . 
  people in for example sweden have a tremendously hard time grasping the fact that ( for example ) somalians and afghans have no sense of proportions or any idea of things we 'd consider `` common knowledge '' about the world - with few exceptions . 
  even run-of-the-mill christianity is often met with superstition and ignorance ; i 've met muslims that thought that taking trees into the house ( for yule ) was some kind of christian sacrament or ritual ( which is forbidden as according to jeremiah , who is considered to be one of the prophets of islam ( as * aramaya * ) . 
  even otherwise well-educated muslims ( such as an afghan woman with an engineering degree that i know ) have often never even been in a church , have no idea about any of the sacraments ( beyond the christening , which many do n't understand as one of the sacraments anyway , but merely a cultural name-giving cermony ) . 
  the ignorance of the european populace in assuming that the rest of the world is * `` just like us '' * is sometimes astounding . 
   i think they also are inffected with americitis , and think because one time some redneck in america shot up a sihk temple that eu region nationalists would do the same . 
  the funny thing is that politically active nationalists do not concern themselves overly much with religion , on average . 
  like . 
  at all . 
  the issues with islam is a symptom , not a cause . 
  ** edit : ** again downvotes for stating a fact . 
  this sub is so damn schizophrenic . 
  the problem with that is that christians and muslims would likely argue the same . 
  that being said , the sikhs * generally * live by a set of rules which ( to me ) essentially boils down to * `` do n't be retarded '' * . 
  sikhism is n't without it 's issues , though ; the lax standards mean that not all sikhs live `` by the book '' , and the dependence on the various gurus means that there 's sometimes conflicting tenets , coupled with the fact that the last guru died in 1708 , ensuring that the religion past that point has not `` living errata '' , so to speak . 
  for example , the * khalistan movement * shows that sikhs can be far from just `` being a good guy '' - although as usual , `` real '' sikhs would likely argue that they are not `` real sikhs '' . 
  i know a lot of people that do n't even understand what the term entails , so you 're probably right . 
   fascist there ** are ** no * `` fascist currents of islam '' * . 
  you can argue authoritative , authoritarian , oppressive , fanatical , extremist , theocratic , etc , etc , etc ; but not * fascist * . 
  in fact , some of the most `` fascist '' and nationalist political forces in the middle east/arabia with any clout , such as the [ ba'ath party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ba'athism ) or the [ syrian social nationalist party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/syrian_social_nationalist_party ) are principally secular . 
  * separation * of church and state is part of the foundation ; the literal opposite of wahhabism and islamism . 
  i agree with your sentiment , that wahhabism and the like have no place in europe , although i would likely go much farther than that , but i detest the frivolous labeling of things as `` fascist '' whenever it 's something the political left or right do n't like . 
  when it comes to islamization and radicalization , democracy is far more of a danger , since they routinely call for the lowest common denominator as a unifier ; often , that is religion . 
  they may disagree on just about anything and everything , but they * all * agree that * allah is great and muhammad is his prophet , peace be upon his memory * . 
  cue unity under islamism and the silent sanction of the moderate but inherently passive majority . 
  if that 's true , it 's likely because most sikhs are infinitely closer to europeans , ethnically - relatively speaking , if still rather distant . 
  also , it 's a tremendous help that they 're usually not assholes about their religion . 
  ** edit : ** why the downvotes ? 
  sometimes , it feels like votes are completely arbitrary . 
  reddit is one fickle bitch . 
  yay , balkanization . 
  enormous ones . 
   an ambiguous hand sign oh ** come on ** . 
  mehmet kaplan is a practicing , dedicated muslim , who have worked within politics for over 20 years , and been active within significant muslim organizations since * at the very least * 1996 . 
  to boot , he was involved in the controversy with the muhammed drawings in denmark , where he argued that * denmark hade crossed the line * . 
  all the while maintaining foreign political contacts , contacts with his homeland of turkey , and even was active in charta 2008 , which is a muslim organization that worked with defending muslims accused of being or working with extremists , where several people in the governing board ( such as anna sundberg ) also had ties to islamism and muslim extremism . 
  to say that he would make the mistake of making an * `` ambiguous hand sign '' * is absolutely ridiculous , in this context . 
  in no reasonable universe can you argue , with a straight face , that kaplan did n't know * exactly * what that hand gesture means . 
  you can argue that with many clueless `` anti-racists '' or `` feminists '' that just wants to be `` tolerant '' , but it does n't work with mehmet kaplan . 
  there is no way he did n't know that hand sign , that he did n't know what it stands for , and that he did n't know the implications of signaling in the way he did . 
  and he 's just a drop in the ocean .
