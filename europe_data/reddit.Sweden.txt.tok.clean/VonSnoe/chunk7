  now as to why trump would be in favour of an arms race in nukes , when us still maintain enough to wipe the earth clean of humans several times over is totally a bigly mystery ... 
  banks are essentially the epitome of capitalism . 
  their care goes as long as the $ $ # takes them and i do not think for a second they have any moral objection but rather that they dont think it would be a profitable loan . 
  fn is asking to loan 27 million euro . 
  that is not a small amount of money . 
  and to quote the article * mr bay said : `` for months we 've been looking for a loan from a french banks or european banks . 
  at this stage we still have n't found a sufficient loan for the presidential and legislative campaigns . 
  * i would interpret this as that banks are willing to loan them a lower amount than what they are requesting . 
  no , they certainly want you to be afraid ( i honestly doubt they care about the kill count as long as the acts spread terror ) hence the word terrorist . 
  the entire goal of terrorism is the use of indiscriminate violence to instill terror/fear to achieve a political goal . 
  essentially a war of attrition where they try to batter down its opponent until they get what they want because the will to resist amongst the people no longer exist . 
  and isis very clearly wants to force a divide between muslims and non-muslim in europe , seems especially towards syrian refugees that has left their `` glorious caliphate '' . 
  because when people are able to leave it that undermines their authority and their claims of `` greatness '' and the worldview they want to impose . 
  similair as to why north korea ( or any totalitarian regime , compare west vs ussr , same thing . ), 
  does not want its citizen to leave . 
  as doing so undermines the north korean governments claim of greatness and authority when its citizens can see freely what a shit hole it is compared to south korea and most other countries . 
  for comparison the extremist terrororganisation red army faction in germany ( active 1970-1998 ) political goal was to through its heinous acts of violence attempting to provoke a government reaction targeted against the workingclass . 
  seeking to make the government enact policies/laws that would suppress & disenfranchise the workingclass so that they would become `` true believers '' and join their `` righteous cause '' because they would have no other choice . 
  they also had no qualms attacking socialists who publicly denounced them and criticized their tactics . 
  so the best thing to do when it comes to terrorists is to tell em to fuck off by not changing your lifestyle . 
  live your life as you wish . 
  he is an mep elected from belgium and president of alde ( one of the many coalition blocks in the eu parliament ) . 
  anyone can make the statement he made . 
  but since he is the president of the 3rd largest eu group ( if i recall correctly ) his words tend to wield more power than that of a single mep or just eu citizen . 
  would be more efficient to have eu make an energy union where the eu as a unit trades with russia for gas instead of each nation independently . 
  would entirely fuck up russias gas choke on its eastern neighbours . 
  sadly the political will is lacking in pretty much all nations not affected by the problem . 
  what you just wrote is false and the exact same thing that happens when impoverished nations get access to prosperity and basic health care occurs when immigrants move to 1st world countries . 
  an article from the economist talking about this very issue . 
  you quite clearly have no idea about what you are talking about which is why you really should educate yourself in the matter first . 
  for example ;  africans are quite good example of this , as they have never been able to create society that would be comparable to that of europeans , be it any continent , country in the world . 
  if you can not comprehend how ludicrously false and ignorant this statement is their is no point of having a discussion based on facts and logic when you appear to base your world view on none of them . 
  you quite clearly have no clue what you are talking about so i would highly encourage you to educate yourself in these matters rather than spewing racist shit that make you frankly look like the retards i mentioned above . 
  no , it actually remains true in that case also . 
  here is an article from the economist talking about this very thing . 
  http://www.economist.com/news/international/21697819-immigrants-do-less-raise-birth-rates-generally-believed-fecund-foreigners highly recommend you read it . 
  edit ; apparently paywalled here is the text immigrant fertility fecund foreigners ? 
  immigrants do less to raise birth rates than is generally believed apr 30th 2016 | duisburg for a turkish woman ready to start a household , weseler strasse in duisburg is a one-stop shop . 
  there , in the shadow of an enormous steel works , are dozens of stores selling wedding dresses and glitzy tuxedos ; jewellery and home furnishings . 
  what this stretch of weseler strasse does not contain is a baby shop . 
  in the early 1980s women with foreign passports in duisburg had a birth rate much higher than native germans ( see chart ) . 
  most of the foreigners were turks , who had settled in this ruhr valley city for its industrial jobs and brought their big-family culture with them . 
  but then came an astonishing drop . 
  today foreigners are actually slightly less fertile than natives . 
  that is saying something : german women in duisburg , and in germany as a whole , do not have nearly enough babies to keep the population ticking over naturally . 
  xenophobes and xenophiles share a belief in the fecundity of newcomers . 
  `` immigrants are more fertile , '' explained jeb bush , an erstwhile american presidential candidate ( and xenophile ) in 2013 . 
  `` they love families and they have more intact families , and they bring a younger population . '' that is still just about true in america , but the gap is vanishing . 
  between 2006 and 2013 the fertility rate among mexicans in america fell by 35 % , compared with a drop of 3 % among non-hispanic whites . 
  in the netherlands , the immigrant fertility rate is now almost exactly the same as the native one . 
  even in britain , where a quarter of births are to immigrants , statisticians reckon that immigration has raised overall fertility by a mere 0.08 children per woman . 
  the fertile immigrant is partly an illusion . 
  women tend not to move country with babies in tow , explains gunnar andersson of stockholm university : they travel first and then have a child quickly . 
  that makes them seem keener on babies than they really are . 
  partly , too , the countries that send migrants to the rich world have changed , points out michael teitelbaum , a demographer at harvard law school . 
  fertility rates have plunged in both mexico and turkey , from more than six children per woman in 1960 to less than three today . 
  grandma in oaxaca is probably no longer pushing her emigrant daughter to have a third . 
  but the big reason immigrants ' birth rates are falling is that they tend to adopt the ways of the host communities . 
  this happens fast : some studies suggest that a girl who migrates before her teens behaves much like a native . 
  acculturation is so powerful that it can boost birth rates as well as cut them . 
  in england , migrants from high-fertility countries like nigeria and somalia have fewer babies than compatriots who stay put . 
  those from low-fertility countries such as lithuania and poland have more . 
  christine bleks , who runs a children 's charity near weseler strasse , points to the front gardens of houses around duisburg 's large mosque . 
  they are small and orderly , with neat hedges and kitsch ornaments . 
  the style is stereotypically german , she says . 
  but the owners are mostly turkish . 
  as with gardens , so with families : immigrants have gone native . 
  no i am talking about how the connection between high birthrates are directly connected to prosperity and access to basic health and how this connection can be demonstrated in every single country on earth that when their prosperity and public health went up their birthrates went down . 
  i am sorry , but i strongly believe that their worry is retarded because it is completly contradictionary to scientific facts . 
  i would say it is on par with believing that the earth is flat . 
  now can one go about and be more diplomatic when dealing with people who hold these beliefs ? 
  ofcourse , but that does not change the fact that their fear is stupid . 
  and if the main concern for people holding completly unfounded and anti-scientific beliefs is to be caught looking stupid by someone calling them out on their stupidity they really ought to consider doing some research on the subjects they choose to have strong opinions about and fact check it before choosing to base their fears on false , faulty and incorrect information . 
  and that worry is frankly , completly retarded . 
  high birthrates are directly connected to low prosperity and low or no access to basic health . 
  when prosperity goes up and more people get access to basic health birthrates go down . 
  why ? 
  because child mortality rates drops fairly rapidly once you get access to basic health needs and higher prosperity means better social safety nets and less people having to rely on their kids to take care of them when they get older . 
  the short version - european companies gets access to an additional 32 million consumers and a canada that will be competing on the same terms as eu based companies . 
  whoever thought this law was a great idea and is part of the uk government clearly needs to be assigned a legal guardian since he/she is incapable of understanding the concept of consent and what being an adult is and thus should probably not be in a position to make laws ... who the fuck even came up with the idea ? 
  as in the person who spawned the idea . 
   of course in reality sd had already cleaned up the party under mikael jansson a year prior to most of the current leadership joining it . 
  are you seriously daft or something ? 
  either you are completly ignorant or you are intentionally lying . 
  if what you said was true they would not still to this day be kicking out elected officials from their party who get caught in the racist `` cookiejar '' . 
  some noteworthy example ; 2013 - patrik ehn , group leader of sd gothenburg gets kicked out after being caught closely communicating and giving support to german npd . 
  http://www.expressen.se/gt/darfor-tvingas-patrik-ehn-ut-fran-partiet/ 2014 - erik almqvist ( elected mp & their financeminister candidate ) , kent ekeroth ( elected mp & their justiceminister candidate ) , christian westling ( ran for mep but did not get in ) is caught on video recorded 2 years prior being complete asshats and yelling racial slurs . 
  erik almqvist is bought out to leave his place , christian westling gets kicked out around 2015 . 
  kent ekeroth remains ( which is quite the mystery cuz he appears generally hated in his own party ) . 
  [ video of the event that they themself recorded ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxpwclgalzu ) 2014 - christoffer dulny , sd group leader in stockholm city and first name on their list for stockholm `` county '' elections . 
  gets kicked out after being caught writing racist comments such as ** `` araber har v\u00e5ldsammare gener , ** nu f\u00e5r de kortare f\u00e4ngelsestraff '' . 
  = ** arabs have violent genes ** , now they get shorter prisonsentence . 
  which results in him ending up 6th place on simon weisenthal list of top 10 anti-semite events for 2014 . 
  [ bonus pic from his younger years ] ( https://www.interasistmen.se/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/10152047_1494894990762303_5630525300296623980_n.jpg ) and for a recent one ; 2016 - anna hagwall , elected mp and `` vice-vice partyleader '' ( 3rd in line ) writes a motion to get rid of the government press subsidies and then goes on a rant about `` how '' bonniers ( a publicist/book company founded in 1837 by a jewish family ) controls 80 % of the media . 
  http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/sverigedemokraternas-anna-hagwall-avgar/ and these are only a few examples of people holding prominent positions within the party . 
  so you were saying ? 
  pretty much all swedish commercial channels are broadcasting from the uk because you have alot more lax advertising rules . 
  for example in sweden it is illegal to broadcast alcohol ads but it is perfectly legal in the uk . 
   your score : 78 % ( 31 points out of 40 ) #victory, 
   after the 1973 military coup against chilean president salvador allende , the cuban embassy was under fire by tanks and cubans were returning fire from the windows ; edelstam took a swedish flag in hand and walked in front of the tanks as bullets hurled past .
