not sure what you prove by insulting me . 
  anyway i 'll show you their definition :  the term `` indirectly killed '' refers to persons who die from deficiency diseases such as malnutrition and other ailments , mostly while seeking refuge , and who could have been treated successfully , had there not been the war they never show clearly how big that number is , so it 's difficult to say how much it affect the result . 
  anyway , those people were not killed by the united states like you claim ( though we can of course discuss the moral responsibility ) . 
  -- also , the numbers they cite are way way higher than most other [ organizations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/casualties_of_the_iraq_war ) . 
  your source says over a million people died in iraq . 
  here are some other sources for comparison : -- iraq body count : 224,000 deaths -- costs of war project : 176,000 -- 189,000 deaths -- classified american numbers published by wikileaks ( in 2009 ) : 109,032 deaths -- iraqi health ministry ( 2003-2006 ) : 100,000 -- 150,000 deaths -- i should add that i 've always opposed the iraq war and i still do . 
  from your own source :  this investigation comes to the conclusion that the war has , directly or indirectly , killed around 1 million people in iraq , 220,000 in afghanistan and 80,000 in pakistan , i.e. 
  a total of around 1.3 million . 
  not included in this figure are further war zones such as yemen . 
  ** the figure is approximately 10 times greater than that of which the public , experts and decision makers are aware of and propagated by the media and major ngos . 
  ** also , they concede that these numbers are extrapolated than actually counted , and they include people `` indirectly killed '' whatever that means . 
  i 'd take that source with a grain of salt . 
  just to clarify , i personally did not intend to push a particular agenda here , and i must admit i 'm a bit taken a back by the vitriol in some of the comments here . 
  with that said , this is actually not an isolated case , but just one of many times asylum seekers ( not necessarily syrians ) have refused to step out of buses just this year . 
  the real issue , in my opinion , is not whether or not these people are asking for too much , but that they have completely unrealistic expectations of what awaits them in sweden . 
  here 's an [ interview ] ( http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/jag-angrar-att-jag-akte-till-sverige/ ) with a syrian refugee ( in english ) explains this . 
  another syrian , [ mahmoud bitar ] ( https://youtu.be/jajcy5k4rb4?t=1m23s ) , quite famously warned about this as well . 
  syrians traveling to sweden should know that the country is already accepting more asylum seekers than it can handle and that the living conditions for new arrivals without any means of supporting themselves are very modest . 
  [ svt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sveriges_television ) is the swedish equivalent of the bbc and has a good reputation ( though periodically accused of having a left-wing slant ) . 
  and here 's another [ interview ] ( http://www.svt.se/nyheter/regionalt/dalarna/de-hungerstrejkar-for-battre-boende ) ( in english ) with one of the protesters who threatened with a hunger strike . 
  there 's an interview in english if you click the link . 
  here 's a translation of the article :  mohammad khaled is one of the asylum seekers who arrived by bus to frederiksberg asylum accommodation during the night of thursday . 
  the asylum seekers had received information that they were on their way to hedemora , but that did not happen . 
  this caused dissatisfaction among the asylum seekers on the bus . 
   `` when we arrived here , we realized that it is far from civilization , shops , hospitals and schools . 
  we need somewhere to study and have a good life . 
  we came to sweden because it would be ` freedom land . ', 
  we believe they have lied to us '' says mohammad . 
   according to mohammad , they will not leave the bus until the migration board has arrived . 
   officers from the swedish migration board came to frederiksberg in the morning , and around lunchtime , most had chosen to leave the bus they had been sitting in since last night . 
   it was then clear if they were left in the bus sat there to protest or if they waited to be taken to the accommodation . 
   * threatened with hunger strike *  while the newcomers were sitting in the bus this morning , other asylum seekers who arrived in frederiksberg few days ago threatened to begin a hunger strike to protest conditions at the facility . 
  they gathered with placards outside the shop in frederiksberg . 
   that campaign has now ended . 
   to me , it 's two brothers who literally speak the same language and always had good historic brotherhood relations [ ... ] this is not actually true . 
  the `` historical brotherhood '' has n't always been good and not very brotherly either . 
  see for example : * [ cossack uprisings ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cossack_uprisings ) * [ ivan mazepa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ivan_mazepa ) * [ ukrainian war of independence 1917-1921 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukrainian_war_of_independence ) * [ holdomor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/causes_of_the_holodomor#deliberate_targeting_of_ukrainians ) * [ organization of ukrainian nationalists ( oun ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/organization_of_ukrainian_nationalists ) to make a long story short , ukrainian history contains lots of conflict and violence ( mostly with poland and russia ) . 
  also [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ivan_mazepa ) is quite interesting :  everyone who opposed the russian government in eighteenth-century ukraine were derogatorily referred to as mazepintsy ( mazepists ) similar to how current day ukrainians are called [ banderovtsy ] ( https://youtu.be/oyqdv21wizk?t=1m20s ) . 
  -- also , it should be pointed out that ukrainian and russian are not the same language . 
  in fact , ukrainian is more similar to belarusian and polish than russian . 
   lexically , the closest language to ukrainian is belarusian ( 84 % of common vocabulary ) , followed by polish ( 70 % ) , serbo-croatian ( 68 % ) , slovak ( 66 % ) and russian ( 62 % ) . 
  [ 8 ] the ukrainian language retains a degree of mutual intelligibility with belarusian and russian . 
  [ 9 ] with that said , ukrainians usually speak russian very well ( in some cases even better than they do ukrainian ) and there 's also [ surzhyk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/surzhyk ) . 
  but the point still remains : ukrainian \u2260 russian . 
  let 's take a look on a bit of the atrocities committed under lenin 's rule . 
  crimes of which he was well aware . 
  the [ cheka ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cheka ) , predecessor to the nkvd ( stalin 's secret police ) estimates the following number of executions :  for the period 1918 -- july 1919 , covering only twenty provinces of central russia : 8,389 dead  for the whole period 1918 -- 19 : 9,641 dead . 
   for the whole period 1918 -- 20 : 12,733 dead . 
  however , experts generally agree these semi-official figures are vastly understated . 
  modern moderate estimates are in the range of 50,000 executions during these years . 
   lenin himself seemed unfazed by the killings . 
  on 12 january 1920 , while addressing trade union leaders , he said : `` we did not hesitate to shoot thousands of people , and we shall not hesitate , and we shall save the country . '', 
  their methods were absolutely despicable as well :  the cheka is reported to have practiced torture . 
  depending on cheka committees in various cities , the methods included : [ 2 ] being skinned alive , scalped , `` crowned '' with barbed wire , impaled , crucified , hanged , stoned to death , tied to planks and pushed slowly into furnaces or tanks of boiling water , [ 2 ] or rolled around naked in internally nail-studded barrels . 
  chekists reportedly poured water on naked prisoners in the winter-bound streets until they became living ice statues . 
  others reportedly beheaded their victims by twisting their necks until their heads could be torn off . 
  the chinese cheka detachments stationed in kiev reportedly would attach an iron tube to the torso of a bound victim and insert a rat in the tube closed off with wire netting , while the tube was held over a flame until the rat began gnawing through the victim 's guts in an effort to escape . 
  [ 2 ] anton denikin 's investigation discovered corpses whose lungs , throats , and mouths had been packed with earth . 
  [ 2 ] [ 33 ]  women and children were also victims of cheka terror . 
  women would sometimes be tortured and raped before being shot . 
  children between the ages of 8 and 13 were imprisoned and occasionally executed . 
  1 ) imprison many thousands of people in camps for an undisclosed amount of time . 
  2 ) bully innocent third-party state that already hosts 2.1 million refugees . 
  so you are trying to imply that because some people take selfies that they are not actually refugees from a war ? 
  you do n't think these people genuinely fear for their [ lives ] ( http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=87e_1428764798 ) ? 
  also you have no idea from where they got that selfie stick . 
  they might not have brought it from where they came . 
  and even if they did , so what ? 
  what 's the point ? 
  that some refugees have smartphones and use them ? 
  why was this removed ? 
  this has n't been posted in / r/europe before . 
  this was just published in swedish press a couple of hours ago . 
  ** translation ** -------- on monday the malm\u00f6 police confirmed that during the new year 's night in malmo there have been cases where large male gangs surrounded and harassed drunk girls . 
  the events took place in several locations in malm\u00f6 city around kungsparken and central station . 
  kill the gangs also fired off rockets and firecrackers toward people . 
  in a police report regarding new year 's night , as kv\u00e4llspressen noted , one could read `` something that was unlike all previous years was that a couple of hundred of people , which i regard as ` unaccompanied children from afghanistan , ' roamed around in the city and were generally unruly . 
  there are several cases where large bunch of these surrounded mainly drunk girls and women and harassed them . 
  however , none resulted in a police report during the night . '', 
  -- yes , this information came to us on friday , and now we 're looking at whether we received any complaints of harassment that we can link to these cases , but we have not found any , says lars f\u00f6rstell , information officer at the malm\u00f6 police . 
  but this means that the police have observed incidents where women have been harassed ? 
  -- it is not sure that anyone has seen it , because then we would have intervened . 
  this may just be hearsay . 
  has the person who wrote the report been asked about this ? 
  -- that is not my role , and have not had the opportunity to ask the person who wrote it . 
  so i can not answer that now . 
  why was n't this brought to your attention until last friday ? 
  -- because the person who wrote and compiled the report could not leave it before then ; he was not in service . 
  it will be mostly the basis for our knowledge and is not about pressing issues . 
  in kalmar , the police have called for the public to report if they had been subjected to sexual harassment during the new year 's night , is this something you will do too ? 
  -- we 'll see if there will be need for us to go out with a similar request , whether anyone saw or heard or know anything regarding this issue . 
  what we can do now is to pay attention to this phenomenon , when big crowds gather in the future . 
  is this a phenomenon that you noted earlier in malmo ? 
  -- no , this is a new phenomenon that we have not seen examples in the past . 
  if it occurs in malmo so it touches the public and it is important that we have data . 
  according to h\u00e5kan johansson field officer at the malm\u00f6 police who was team leader during the new year 's night was a question of bigger bunch of 8-10 pieces that drove around town and have surrounded the girls . 
  no crimes related to the events have come to his attention . 
  in a message to kv\u00e4llsposten , he writes `` it was the observations i made . 
  male gangs at least gathered around alone drunk girls . 
  when my colleague and i saw this , we placed ourselves next to them , whereupon the gangs were dispersed .
