yes , montreal . 
  would n't mind visiting again , i like the city . 
  in sweden it is ( as far as i 've heard , ca n't be bothered to dig up a source at the moment ) illegal to keep any indigenous species as pets . 
  the sound at the end of this particular word has two alternative pronounciations . 
  dialect determine which one is correct for you . 
  i say it with a sh-sound at the end , like in the english word shell . 
  so in my dialect i think it 's pretty easy for foreigners to pronounce . 
  others say it with the sj-sound that op mentioned in his post , and that sound can be tricky . 
  huh , never thought of that . 
  now that you point it out , i guess it is a bit further back than the vowel in english `` we '' . 
  i learned something new today , thanks !, 
  hro\u0161\u010d is not a problem for me . 
  i always struggle with \u017eelezni\u0161ka postaja . 
  while the voiceless s , c , \u010d and \u0161 are sounds that are natural to a swede , the corresponding voiced sound z , dz , d\u017e , \u017e do not occur in my mother toungue so it takes a slight mental effort to make them part of my linguistic thought ( if that makes any sense ) . 
  i have to stop and think before i can say it . 
  i had a problem with h in the beginning . 
  my tongue was too far back in my mouth , so when i said hi\u0161a the position of my tongue would affect the i so it would come out as hui\u0161a . 
  i spent about a year or two taking internet classes in the evenings after work and weekends . 
  if i had done it in full time ( 40 h/w ) it would be two or three months . 
  the courses were offered by the university of gothenburg , but i think the professor ( morgan nilsson , an absolute wizard in slavic languages ) moved to uppsala since then and the courses with him . 
  i also learned from my wife and her family . 
  she 's slovenian , from novo mesto . 
  i like some songs by dan d , just listening over and over to their songs until i knew the lyrics by heart helped me too . 
  i 'm pretty good at pronounciation though . 
  even though my grammar and vocabulary are lacking ( and unfortunately i 'm forgetting more and more since we 're living in stockholm ) , if i do know what to say i think you would struggle to hear i 'm not a native speaker . 
  i think my musical ear helps me a lot . 
  this will sound silly but when i make an effort to speak good slovenian i kinda imagine that i 'm making a parody of how ex-yugo migrants speak swedish . 
  it feels like a theatre sometimes and over the top but it helps me get the attitude just right . 
  yes , my username is a reference to watermelon in easter hay . 
  a masterpiece . 
  you 're the first one to notice . 
  does your soft d occur in the same places as \u00f0 in icelandic ? 
   speech patterns of people with downs syndrome you take the fun out of mocking danes when you steal the punchline like that . 
  i 'm a swede who has learned to speak slovenian as an adult . 
  i find it really difficult to distinguish \u010d from \u0107 , and i 'm glad slovenian does n't have \u0107 . 
  another set of tricky swedish/norwegian sounds are the retroflex r sounds . 
  an r followed by t , d or n ( off the top of my head ) become new sounds that many foreigners fail to pronounce or even distinguish from the normal t , d and n . the r sound itself is removed . 
  examples : * nord [ nu\u02d0\u0256 ] vs. nod [ nu\u02d0d ] * korn [ ku\u02d0\u0273 ] vs. kon [ ku\u02d0n ] * vart [ va\u02d0\u0288 ] vs. watt [ va\u02d0t ] normally , when making the t , d and n sounds , the tip of your toungue is touching your teeth . 
  you make the retroflex versions by moving the tip of toungue to where it would be touching further back in your mouth if you were making a rolling r , but instead of making an r sound , you try to make a t , d or n with your toungue in this new position .

  is this on weekends or does it apply to weekdays too ? 
  why does `` political music '' mean leftist anthems and battle songs ? 
  wille craaford , songwriter who supported the conservative campaign last election : pure lazyness and smart pr by the left . 
  but listen to the lyrics . 
  freedom , peace and democracy is applauded more often than union bigshots . 
  uje brandelius , pop singer and press officer at the left ( former communist ) party : music is about emotions , and the right ideology is cold hearted . 
  it 's difficult to make emotional music about decreased taxes , it 's easier to write about those who suffer as a result of those decreased taxes . 
  modern swedish hip hop artists often write political lyrics . 
  edit : i found [ this aftonbladet article ] ( http://www.aftonbladet.se/nojesbladet/article12481669.ab ) ( in swedish , sorry ! ), 
  exploring why political music almost always is leftist . 
  wikipedia says [ thaler has bohemian origins ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thaler ) . 
  same word as in `` riksdaler '' . 
  so many beautiful photographs , they trigger my imagination . 
  lots of new places i did n't know i need to visit . 
  i am especially intrigued by monte cassino , that empty courtyard is stunning . 
  excellent post , great pointers !, 
  if you like scandinavian flags , check out the [ various flags used during the swedish-norwegian union ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/union_between_sweden_and_norway#flags ) , most of them are very aestetically pleasing in my opinion . 
  i di n't notice there 's a difference in pronounciation between `` sheep '' and `` cheap '' until my late twenties when i taught myself a slavic language where the `` tsh '' sound is very common . 
  another thing that is difficult for me is to remember which written ss are pronounced like zs . 
  for example , `` music '' is pronounced with a z. 
  ah , right . 
  of course . 
  thanks !, 
  best thing : sweden would finally join nato . 
  i love how gritty luther is . 
  such a contrast to sherlock . 
  [ the bridge ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_bridge_ ( 2011_tv_series \\ ) ) is a good crime tv series , the enjoyment comes more from the magic between the two main characters rather than the actual crime or police procedures . 
  edit : paranthesis in url needed escaping . 
  it is , yes , but the dish is swedish . 
  created by tore wretman in the 1950s . 
  [ toast skagen ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/toast_skagen ) : shrimp , mayonnaise , horseradish , lemon and dill served on white bread fried in butter . 
  heavenly . 
  well , to start with , the first letter is not pronounced like a ` g ' , it 's a [ voiced velar fricative ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voiced_velar_fricative ) . 
  disclaimer : i do not speak dutch , i just picked up this information somewhere sometime and it stuck . 
  they sound like great inlaw material . 
  then you must have noticed this ? 
  gouda is popular in sweden , but almost no swede knows how to pronounce it . 
  i know this will provoke infinite downboats from my countrymen , but hey , my karma sucks anyway so here we go : denmark - [ emil christian hansen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/emil_christian_hansen ) ** edit : ** formatting . 
  ** edit 2 : ** changed url to point to non-mobile wikipedia . 
  thanks , helperbot !, 
  i do n't speak a word russian but i like the sound of [ odnozvutjno gremit kolokoltjik ] ( https://youtu.be/icvgygouely ) . 
  the melody has been reused in a swedish christian hymn * jag har h\u00f6rt om en stad ovan molnen * which i do n't care too much about but i like the original . 
  and anything by [ goran bregovi\u0107 ] ( https://youtu.be/lgxli3mde3g ) gets my heart pumping . 
  i 'm not an expert , but i think many of the songs he sings are in some kind of mix of serbian , bulgarian and romani . 
  are you thinking about moving to a particular part of sweden ? 
  any specific city ? 
  rural area ? 
  as u/jkvatterholm says , there are cultural differences within sweden too . 
  * the average swede * that you 'll ( hopefully ) get described here in the comments is probably representative for a swede in the largest cities , since that 's where most of us are . 
  grew up in sweden . 
  we used `` smurf '' when i was a kid . 
  like you , i have no idea why . 
  kid logic , i guess . 
  that really did not end the way i thought it would . 
  i used to hate the laundry room drama . 
  i am inappropriately amused by the idea of * ragnar\u00f6k * declined in six cases and three numbers by slovenian politicians and newspapers . 
  i understand what you 're saying , but if the question is asked here you might get more answers from people who are not slovenes but have experience of slovenia . 
  like me for example . 
  hmm , i should probably go and subscribe to r/slovenia , and then i 'll be able to answer similar questions there in the future . 
  both slovenes ' perception of themselves , and visitors ' perception of slovenes , help paint a picture of the country .
