comming right [ up ] ( http://i.imgur.com/neewhnt.png ) ** edit ** there are a lot more where [ that ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordic_cross_flag#nordic_cross_flags_outside_of_scandinavia ) came from, 
  apparently it 's very old swedish , might have come to your island with the vikings https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/ej, 
  you are technically right ... which is ... the best kind of correct . 
  just looked it up , starting school back in the first part of the eighties i remember the teacher talking about this flower and it 's name , i remember just because it was named like it is . 
  the only gibson novel i read . 
  i like his style and visionary in the sci-fi genre but sadly i do n't like his writing style . 
  it might be a lack of knowledge of the english language . 
  f\u00f6rg\u00e4tmigej which is swedish spelling but english meaning except the last syllable which is swedish and it means * not * edit : i 'm wrong , only the first word is english meaning but swedish spelling, 
  it 's not really because if migration to digital , but more technology in the tv usually just showed a blank screen instead of the static . 
  usually a blue screen, 
  i will look into that . 
  have to confirm since not everyone said what language they translated from, 
  in swedish it 's * myrornas krig * meaning ** ants war **, 
  that would be 1.21 jiggawatts, 
  yeah , but what part is the scrotum ? 
  but they speak funny !, 
  wow i 'm sure that 's an incidental inuendo, 
  round two . 
  fight !, 
  did n't you try that once before ? 
  how did that work out ? 
  i would n't mind if you reclaim lost territories , norway might object though, 
  swedish one is not correct , the arc is more shallow than in the infographic . 
  in the infographic it shows the edge seats are almost sitting facing eachother , this is not the case in the [ * riksdag * ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ax2o2at.jpg ), 
  sadly plexi get worn out much quicker than glass . 
  in case of vandals it 's only better that it does n't break , cleaning up plexi is almost impossible compared to glass . 
  tbf , the swedish national anthem contains the word * die * in it and is likely the most emphasized line in the entire anthem * ja jag vill leva jag vill d\u00f6 i norden * ( yes i want to live and die in the north ), 
  what dlc is that ? 
  according to this guy it 's not like that https://youtu.be/9vvohgwhmws, 
  relevant https://youtu.be/9vvohgwhmws, 
  or this https://youtu.be/9vvohgwhmws, 
   no one 's gon na fuck with a guy called perkele do you mean like literally ? 
  i think that newly religious persons are * seekers * , trying to find his or her way in her personal path through life . 
  being much more impressionable because of that you have the recipe for ending up in situation like this, 
  so burglars are pretty safe as long as they take their shoes off ? 
  that 's my plan, 
  i bet it looked something like [ this ] ( http://a.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/cocreate/article_feature/1280-temptations-shake-ems-cat-boots-campaign.jpg ), 
  just because you 're not affected by it does n't mean that others wo n't . 
  what people do n't think of is that you pass that on to the next person and that person might have a severe reaction to it . 
  next time it might be you http://i.imgur.com/otoe79h.png, 
  they prefer to be called * altitude challenged *, 
  now i understand . 
  my brother married a finnish chick and all her cousins put him in a row boat to show how much of a man he was . 
  he rowed that sucker over the lake, 
  albanian sound super cool, 
  as a swede when i hear dutch i 'm like * hey , someone 's speaking swedish * . 
  and i listen closer and * why ca n't i understand that ? 
  * then i hear that it 's not and i know it 's dutch . 
  imo dutch has the same * melody * as swedish, 
  you should read up a little bit on deng xiaoping , mao zedong and the revolution in general . 
  being large is not the same as being imperial . 
  the borders china have are from way back . 
  would you say that the us was imperialistic from the start ? 
  of course not , it 's something they became . 
  china was at one time , stopped being and are now on the rise again, 
  anti-imperal china is starting to sound a lot more imperial and have for quite a while , especially with the acquisition of aircraft carrier, 
  un 2.0 should be scrapped and be replaced with un 3.0 where no permanent members of anything and no veto rights . 
  it 's ridiculous how it works now . 
  it 's orwellian where some * are more equal than others *, 
  so , if you do n't sign it that should mean you do n't fall under the law of it being * illegal * right ? 
  is n't there a similar law about land mines that some did n't sign ( like the us ) . 
  what constitutes * illegal nuclear weapons * ? 
  ( sincerely wondering ), 
  i 'm sorry , i really thought most of \u00d6sterrike was mountains , not quite like schweiz but almost . 
  poland is practically the mediterranean to swedes :p, 
  meteorologically sweden can have three seasons at once . 
  winter in the far north , spring/autumn in the middle while it 's still summer in the far south . 
  1600km as the crow flies north to south, 
  but ... but ... alps ? 
  the gulf stream helps scandinavia a lot with evening out the seasons , * mild * winters and temperate summers . 
  not sure if that comes into play with the wood housing . 
  but there are a lot of brick houses too ( 54 % of sweden is covered in trees , and is one of our biggest exports . 
  we have a bunch of regulations when it comes to lumbering , you ca n't do whatever you want even if you own forest ), 
  swedish it sometimes referred to as ddr-house, 
  do you know much the humidity is in grams per cubic metre ? 
  north of sweden can have as low as 1g per m3 in the winter while the south can have 4 times as much as the north in the winter . 
  [ winter ] ( http://www.smhi.se/polopoly_fs/1.34690.1398236975!/image/absolutfukt-jan-1996-2012.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1004px/absolutfukt-jan-1996-2012.jpg ) [ summer ] ( http://www.smhi.se/polopoly_fs/1.34691.1398235939!/image/absolutfukt-jul-1996-2012.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1004px/absolutfukt-jul-1996-2012.jpg ), 
  depends if you live in the south or the north if it 's humid or not . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.smhi.se/polopoly_fs/1.34690.1398236975!/image/absolutfukt-jan-1996-2012.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1004px/absolutfukt-jan-1996-2012.jpg ) is the humidity in january and the numbers are grams per cubic metre of air . 
  the difference is much bigger in the north during the summer where it 's almost ten times as humid but just twice as humid in the south in the [ summer ] ( http://www.smhi.se/polopoly_fs/1.34691.1398235939!/image/absolutfukt-jul-1996-2012.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1004px/absolutfukt-jul-1996-2012.jpg ) . 
  enver was n't all bad then ? 
  alexander of greece https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexander_of_greece#death  on 2 october 1920 , alexander was injured while walking through the grounds of the tatoi estate . 
  a domestic barbary macaque belonging to the steward of the palace 's grapevines attacked or was attacked by the king 's german shepherd dog , fritz , [ e ] and alexander attempted to separate the two animals . 
  as he did so , another monkey attacked alexander and bit him deeply on the leg and torso . 
  eventually servants arrived and chased away the monkeys ( which were later destroyed ) , and the king 's wounds were promptly cleaned and dressed but not cauterized . 
  he did not consider the incident serious and asked that it not be publicized . 
   that evening , his wounds became infected ; he suffered a strong fever and septicemia set in . 
  his doctors considered amputating his leg , but none wished to take responsibility for so drastic an act.on 19 october , he became delirious and called out for his mother , but the greek government refused to allow her to re-enter the country from exile in switzerland , despite her own protestations . 
  finally , the queen dowager , olga , widow of george i of greece and alexander 's grandmother , was allowed to return alone to athens to tend to the king . 
  she was delayed by rough waters , however , and by the time she arrived , alexander had already died of sepsis twelve hours previously at a little after 4 p.m. on 25 october 1920 . 
  that reminds me of this epic post which makes this event even more jaw dropping . 
  that 's such a tarantinoesque dialogue, 
  could be the uk or the french ... 
  oh the words of a date-raper ... 
  omg , i actually knew that first one but just because i heard about it just a few days ago !, 
  i better get hustling then , aruba is on my bucket list . 
  wow . 
  i had no idea those events took place . 
  i would n't say that 1444 is * your country 's modern history * . 
  interesting nonetheless,
