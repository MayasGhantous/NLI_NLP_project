  she flew there but at the customs she was n't let in because she did n't have an ordinary passport . 
  she had to fly back home again . 
  ^ ^ 1 while it 's a sad story , but who gets robbed of their passport one week before travelling ? 
  the kind of person that brings their passport around as identification in their home country , it has been very common for young people to do this because they 're too cheap to get a real id card . 
  so what i think happen is that she was carrying around her passport as identification and she lost it ( stolen or not you should n't carry your passport around ), 
  this right here pisses me off since our passports are only valid for 5 years , and usually less than 4.5 years because it 's unlikely that you can match your 6 months to expire exactly as you travel . 
  i 'm in that position now that i 'm going to sea and the country i 'm going to has a 6 + months demand and my passport expires 2 months after coming home . 
  i ca n't really say , i 've been disconnected from traditional tv for over ten years . 
  i own a machine that can project large screens but since 2 years back i 'm even unable to receive ** any ** broadcasts and before that i just chose not to connect anything that could . 
  it 's not because i 'd rather watch tv-broadcasts through streaming services , it 's just that i do n't care for tv-broadcasts at all . 
  i think they 're conditioning you in a way , especially * reality tv * which imo is the worst thing that has ever happened to tv . 
  it conditions people to think that it 's ok to behave like that . 
  i ca n't stand commercials . 
  every time i visit my mom who watches tv at least a few hours a day i feel rage towards commercials . 
  right now i pay for netflix and spotify , but not month to month . 
  i would never pay for a broadcasting channel . 
  even if there is something that 's going on for two weeks like world cup ice hockey or olympics , i rather just not watch . 
  sometimes i cancel my subscriptions and maybe half a year later i re-subscribe . 
  i have a chromecast so that i can stream directly to my receiver which is nice . 
  i follow some youtube channels and all that . 
  the most important part about it is that it happens on my terms . 
  my media consumption is when , what and if i want it . 
  channel surfing is desensitizing imo . 
  and every time the tv-licensers call me and asks me if i have a tv because i 'm one of the few who are n't paying for it i tell them the same thing , i do n't have one and it just feels like doubt in their voice when they say `` ok . bla bla bla '' i 'm sorry that this does n't really answer you question but it might give you some insight, 
  it was a reference to when iirc swiss soldiers accidentely wandered into lichtenstein for a couple of hours . 
  * it was all so dark * - a soldier http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6415531.stm, 
  i consider myself just right of center and most of the people in the subculture i move around in are pretty damn left . 
  and it annoys the crap out of me the accepted view only is leftish . 
  what 's even more annoying is that a slogan was started a while back `` everyones different '' but apparently that only goes for the ones which have the same leftish views, 
  best come back is * why do you drink ? 
  r\u00f6vhatt, 
  i loathe credit cards and i finally got one just last year because i only plan to use it to but plane tickets . 
  i very rarely use it and my debit card is pretty much my only way of paying for stuff . 
  imo cunt is probably the most offensive word, 
  bastard is strong language ? 
  sensitive twats over in britain, 
  asshat is a great one . 
  i use a translated word for it in sweden . 
  im a bit surprised at this . 
  iirc russia has a pop of 130m , with 1/2 a million orphans , that 's huge . 
  can you give me an eli5 of why there are so many ? 
  florida is the drainage of america . 
  look at a map , you know it 's true, 
  wait , what ? 
  are you saying that products produced in sweden has different languages depending on where in sweden they 're being sold ? 
  coming back ? 
  imo it 's on the way out . 
  it already reached its peak 1-2 years ago . 
  there are still a lot of guys having beards but less now, 
   the biggest shock was probably going to finland as a young child and finding myself in a place where no one understood me and i understood no one . 
  this was way before i learned english , so i was completely lost . 
  i just walked about speaking swedish and no one understood what i was saying . 
  it was very frustrating . 
  when i went to tenerife as an excited 8-year-old , flying for the first time . 
  i did n't meet a single swedish child but the waterland we usually went to there was a couple of days where there were 2 finnish families with kids a couple of years younger than me . 
  too small to play really but i let them chase me and with me taunting them in fake finnish . 
  after one longer run one of the mother approached me and told me ... 
  in swedish not to run too far away with her kinds running after . 
  i was in a shock , why would ... could she speak swedish . 
  it was such a huge thing for me that i still remember it 30 + year later . 
  non what i meant was where there is super hot overcast is preferable which is why they love overcast to begin with, 
  i 'm from the southwest and i was an adult before i realized that other swedes have an affinity for finland . 
  i was like * what ? 
  * so you 're definitely right that . 
  denmark and norway means a lot more than finland ever have ( and my sister in law is even finnish ), 
  awwww , that does n't have to mean that you 're not liked by your neighbors, 
  maybe you accidently invaded lichtenstein and austria took offense !, 
  it 's like disneyland for them . 
  it 's a lot different if it 's 30 degrees and overcast , that 's awesome . 
  10 degrees with overcast is shitty . 
  most people think of the air temp and how hot it is but it 's also how much the sun is shining . 
  the rays from the sun hitting the air is n't really what heated the air . 
  the sun shining hitting surfaces which then heats the air . 
  i was visiting sf in april 20 years ago . 
  it was fricking freezing every other day and decently hot every other day . 
  whew , i thought you said gun , i was like * that ca n't be right * . 
  my world view trembled for a while, 
  you know , just finish that sentence ma\u00f1ana , we 'll be here, 
  they would n't call them documentaries if they are n't real !, 
  hopefully enough to be entrusted with handling one, 
   what do i want to do when i am in city ? 
  research the specific places you want to visit . 
  what i usually do when i plan my travels when it comes to this is that i make a google map and place all the stuff that i 'd like to do on a map to get a better oversight where they are related to each other [ like this ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1wmsufmaqifdvfhku17envsjipge&amp;ll=-8.45537533006709%2c115.33718199999998&amp;z=11 ) and during the time i have to plan i add more and more until the time comes . 
  then i pick and choose what seems more attractive at the time . 
  there is nothing worse than going on vacation and getting ** stressed ** on what to do . 
  chill the fudge out and enjoy it instead, 
  i wonder if that 's a matter of perspective because intuitively i feel the other way around about ebt but i ca n't say if it 's that 's a general opinion . 
  i recommend / r/backpacking for further inquiries, 
   aside from him , i also despise mona sahlin due to her coming off as utterly corrupt . 
  how she manages to stay relevant is beyond me, 
  there was a time you could 've lived under it !, 
  what about indonesia ? 
  reading this thread it seems that most people seem to think the question is what clothes to buy when parents go with them , while you meant what clothes for the day, 
  i was growing up from 4 years old in the third largest city , malm\u00f6 . 
  ( i 'm born in 1977 , times were different ) from about 5 or 6 i could pass two streets to get to my playground , but it was n't further than 100m maybe . 
  i think i was entrusted a key ( elastic band that hung around my neck ) about a year before i started school ( we start the year we turn 7 ) . 
  i walked to school by myself ( passing 3-4 streets ) from day 2 in school . 
  there were no rules of leaving the school grounds but they told us we ca n't buy candy , not sure if they were allowed to enforce that . 
  from year two in school i could walk to a friends home over 1km away . 
  i started making my own sandwiches around this time and i could also bake stuff .
