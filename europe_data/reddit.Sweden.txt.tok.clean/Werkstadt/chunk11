  by ten years old i was riding a bike within a 1km radius but do n't pass the rail tracks ( it crossed to one of the worst areas in my city ) . 
  also , a parallel street to then one i used to take i was told to stay away from because it 's where all the hookers . 
  iirc i made my first dinner around this time , chili con carne . 
  edit : this was the first time i had an official girlfriend . 
  we kissed a lot but she tried to stick a tongue in my mouth and i looked at her baffled and asked what she was doing . 
  oh , and my girlfriend was the niece of miss universe . 
  :p by twelve years old i could ride anywhere in the city but my parents liked if i stayed out of some areas , we often got up at 4 in the morning on weekends to bike 8km to go fishing . 
  i also got my first id-card so that i could go to a bank and post office and do * business * by fourteen i did n't really have a curfew but it 's mostly related to that i was hanging out playing roleplaying games with my nine year older brother . 
  i also started doing some laundry at this time . 
  my mom sorted the clothes and put in bags with notes on them telling me temperature . 
  edit : it was also at this time my mom ( and my brother ) thought i 'd lost my virginity , i 'd let them believe that by fifteen that curfew laxed into a non-curfew and i was riding a moped , i was entrusted with a credit card that worked at gas stations by sixteen i stayed out as long as i wanted as long as she knew where i was which was almost always the roleplaying place downtown . 
  at seventeen i called my mom on my way to a gaming convention from a payphone 100km from home and 200km from the destination telling her that i haphazardly decided to go with my friends on the bus . 
  i borrowed around 150 $ from my brother to buy the necessities . 
  at 18 i moved out remember this is all before mobile phones . 
  i did n't get a mobile phone until 1998 when i was 20 yo, 
   ... if i meet someone who even uses the phrase `` pre-marital sex '' ... maybe thats the kink ? 
  i think you bungled both reading the question and thd rest of the thread, 
  i did n't mean most famous person from your country , i meant people moving to your country, 
  i think you misunderstood the question . 
  not people leaving your country and making it big in another . 
  people leaving their own country to come to yours, 
  will you please indulge on who this character is ? 
  sharklanche !, 
  i see a movie plot,

  water gun , squirt squirt squirt , `` you 're not allwed to , but they 're in the way '' :p, 
  british isle and british islands are n't the same thing according to [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/british_isles_euler_diagram_15.svg/300px-british_isles_euler_diagram_15.svg.png ) and british isles are correct according to that, 
  my first and only pair of docs broke in the seam after a few weeks . 
  after that i bought getta grips . 
  which have a sole problem instead . 
  : / next pair i buy will be docs again,

  ignorance certainly can be a bliss . 
  many finns want to be swedes ? 
  never heard of anything like that . 
  care to elaborate ? 
  wait what , how do people struggle with those ? 
  shots fired , whatcha gon na do / u/napoleonwithamglatvia, 
  hmm , that 's interesting , did n't know that you had it different than us . 
  * \u00d6sterrikisk * in swedish , that i makes it much easier . 
  but many would , too many to make it work, 
  the reason is n't a practical one , the reason being psychological one , the feeling that no people would be beneficery for choosing their language . 
  and omst\u00e4ndlig , people say omst\u00e4ndig, 
  she put a hex on her , better keep an eye on your daughter the coming weeks for sprouting extra limbs and what not, 
  did you miss an * i * in your first word ? 
  yeah that too , only import words that start with ke - has a hard k ( keps , kennel ) . 
  kex is prononced like kedja , kemi or kela, 
  spoken like a real * sir *, 
  sounds like link-heaven not having to crush all those jars by himself , just avoid falling jars , profit, 
  i recommend you checking out / r/backpacking for additional info, 
   they struggle with where to put the stress in a word so it 's tricky to get right . 
  the stress in swedish in almost all cases always on the first syllable , which is why swedes sound super swedish when they try to pronounce words like india-na-polis and gre-ga-rious and so on, 
   \u00c4ia \u00f5e oa\u00f5ieaia \u00f5ueaua \u00f6\u00f6au are you ok ? 
  should i call someone for you ? 
  do you need an ambulance ? 
  de kuyper , is that sound similar to that ui ? 
  tomato you pretty much need to replant seeds every spring . 
  my mother grows on her 780m ^ 2 garden ( house , shed and garage take up 220m ^ 2 out of total 1000m ^ 2 ) . 
  she lives in the third largest city of malm\u00f6 so her house is n't located in the wilderness * walnut tree * grape vine * plum tree * strawberries * currant ( red and black ) * gooseberry * potatoes * chives * raspberry * carrots * american blueberry bush * onions * cherry tree * apple tree * salad * thyme * basil * turnip * beets * cucumber * dill * parsley * mint * rhubarb * * [ smultron ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fragaria_vesca ) * * * ballon * ( a hybrid between blackberries and strawberries ) edit : oh , and i grow stuff in my livingroom window ( singular ) . 
  last year i got so much bell pepper i did n't know what to do with it . 
  i thought it was an amicable separation . 
  but i 'm not really well read on the union more than it was n't voluntary from the norwegian side . 
  i 'm happy that it got sorted out without bloodshed , 
   the reckless pursuit of freedom is sort of inspiring reckless ? 
  i will try that !, 
  i only use tea from specialty shop so no bag tea , 
  if you look at it just practically you only see the practicality , but consciously * or * subconsciously it 's something else . 
  it 's a vow to god for some , it 's just * feels * more serious to others . 
  i use a timer for three minutes . 
  never use additives because it does n't release the tannic acid before 3.5 minutes, 
  black tea should only steep for a maximum of 3.5 minutes or else it becomes bitter, 
  noy really because a marriage is n't just the practical reasons , it 's much more than just that . 
  i have one of the more expensive providers , telia but the customer service is much better than the other large ones . 
  i got compensated with four free months and a whole year of storytel ( audible ) which costs 17 $ / month . 
  i pay 37 $ a month for my service and i have 12gb of data and unlimited sms and calls . 
  the data i do n't use carry over up to a 100gb . 
  colloquially for koloni ( colony ), 
  i went two weeks every year for four years . 
  and it was some of the best times i ever had as a child . 
  it started in the late 1800 's for children who was n't so well off , especially city kids who did n't have the chance to experience the nature which was becoming super popular as some kind of health promotion . 
  ever since there has been these camps for city children and as social standards got better children still got to go , i 'm not sure how much of it is funded by the parents and the municipal . 
  when i went 1987-1990 it was around 600-800 sek ( about 36-48 usd ) for two weeks of accommodation and activities . 
  first superbowl i watched was xxiii and ever since the bengals have been my team . 
  they had a tough twenty years with being sucky but i stood by them and five-star years ago they started to shine with five playoffs in a row only to get ousted in the first play off . 
  whenever i watch college football i root for the ducks, 
  this explains so much . 
  guess he expected the spanish inquisition, 
  do you know milan ? 
  dresses in uniforms and sings sometimes . 
  it 's not really the larger unit i 'm asking for but the avoidance of using a four-syllable word to describe distance . 
  this is what you 're looking for / r/backpacking /, 
  from ? 
  flair up , mate , 
  wait what ? 
  you mean i was unemployed for years and i all i had to do was ask ? 
  in the 60 's you could go to your state job agency and ask for a job and they would pretty much just hand you a job .
