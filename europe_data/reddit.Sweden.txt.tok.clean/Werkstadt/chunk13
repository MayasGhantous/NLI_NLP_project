  i 'm part of a subculture where germany is a big producer of * this * kind of music as well as in * norden * . 
  it 's part of the subculture to * germanize * words and also use german words whenever possible . 
  werkstadt is a germanization of the swedish word for workshop ( verkstad ) . 
  since i prefer to keep my reddit life apart from normal online and offline life i had to use a username i do n't use anywhere else . 
  edit : it 's pretty funny because just the other day i was like i wonder why / u/idkfa _ cz uses that username, 
  pretty much all of the places ( sf , houston , new orleans , millegeville , boston ) , the amount of chlorine in much of the us tap water is staggering . 
  the locals were apparently so used to it they could n't taste it . 
  it was like drinking from a swimming pool . 
  lpt for making yourself understood going abroad is to use as ** few ** and ** basic ** words as possible together with hand signals is much better than a lots of words `` at what time does the coach to paris depart from the terminal '' vs `` paris , bus , time '' while tapping your left wrist with your finger makes much more sense for a person that is n't as fluent in english as the speaker . 
  and when the person has answered , you can add `` from station ? '' . 
  divide up your question into several shorter ones so that there are n't any misunderstandings, 
  when i was in the us i asked for no ice specifically , the chlorine taste was nauseating, 
  but you told to us look up census data . 
  if you missed an * i * in your sentence it would make more sense that you were the one looking up data . 
  uhm , how far back do you want to go . 
  and i 'm not sure if you would just call it a rebellion from * newly * required land from denmark during the last ice age . 
  but does those have the same origin ? 
  i thought bolle was * to fuck * ? 
  but the questions is , do they have the same origin ? 
  it 's not even close in similarties, 
  * source : https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/insj%c3%b6, 
  would those actually have the same origin ? 
  i wonder how many names black berries have in different languages . 
  in swedish they are * bear berries * ( bj\u00f6rnb\u00e4r ), 
   plus estonians and finns name sweden rootsi/ruotsi , but most other nations call russia after the same root . 
  so you have rootsi to the west and rootsi to the east , maybe it 's just * enemy * ? 
  :p and estonians are n't that picky with books , any book to swear by is ok :d, 
  * [ source ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/dogg ) i 've never heard this in swedish but it 's interesting . 
   otrok in slovene means child , in slovak it means slave are you sure those are n't the same thing ? 
  that 's interesting , * damm * means pond ( and water reservoir for example electricity production ) in swedish edit : it 's not so strange really , because the embankment you 're building for trains can hold water back . 
  same in swedish , banvall, 
  wow . 
  til . 
  ~ ~ kinkig does n't share any origin with kinky . ~ ~ rolig use to mean calm , the opposite of orolig . 
  do n't be surprised if the kids of the future starts to use orolig to describe someone that is n't funny . 
  i prefer black tea over green and roibos ( red ) . 
  i religiously only steep my black tea for 3 minutes at 98 \u00b0 celsius . 
  at 3.5 minutes black tea starts to release tannic acid which makes the tea bitter . 
  i do n't use any sweetener because i do n't have to . 
  many think that you just have to steep your tea longer to make it stronger . 
  it 's not true , you need more tea if you think it 's not strong enough . 
  i buy my tea at a tea specialist next to gothenburg cathedral , they mix their own tea if i 'm not mistaken . 
  right now in my tea tins in the kitchen are * mammas mirakel * ( mothers miracle ) , * mambo jambo * and * camu camu superfruit * . 
  if you drink tea i can highly recommend you just try to steep your tea for 3 minutes without using sweetener after and see what you think about it . 
  i was barely a tea drinker before i started doing this and now i drink a few cups every day . 
   in france they shout `` bis '' . 
  but does encore still mean * encore * in french ? 
  samh\u00e4llsinformation is sadly not possible to opt-out from, 
  i made this post a while back that you might find interesting what does your gymnasium/high school/equivalent graduation look like ? 
  i have preset timer in my phone and my kitchen set for three minutes . 
  after about 3.5 minutes black tea starts to release tannic acid making the tea bitter, 
  single shot fired, 
  the important question is , do you time your steeping ? 
   do schools count as workplaces ? 
  yes for the people that work there , 
  who 's melania ? 
  trolls can be sexy too !, 
  what does she do ? 
  is that the super hot hitwoman in mission impossible 4 ? 
  the audio books gives a chill down my spine when i hear them . 
  such memories from kindergarten, 
  is that the redheaded freckled strong girl ? 
  what year was this ? 
  i was at that company in 2009 and we were only four employees , now they 're like a couple of hundred and like 20 million euro in revenue just five years later, 
  i worked for a company that sells computer to schools so that every student gets their own laptop . 
  some students get macbook . 
  and its really not that expensive as you might think.the calculation is that you get rid of the school computer rooms and with that the admin that take care of it and with only one extra student per class it 's at zero loss for the school . 
  i 'd even let norway rule, 
  you 're wrong , you need religion , history and social studies too edit , unless you 're talking about * grundskolan * i guess ? 
  and history , and religion , and social studies is also mandatory to pass, 
  it 's gotten much better in pronunciation and thanks to the written word my vocabulary has expanded . 
  in swedish my vocabulary is above average and it bleeds out into my english . 
  during my travels it 's not uncommon for people to guess american because of my accent ( or lack there off ) ut when i tell them i 'm swedish they are n't surprise because of the very blonde hair and blue eyes and nordic features . 
  an lpt , if you want to expand your vocabulary . 
  subscribe to a service that present a new word a day with en explanation of what it means and for one week . 
  force yourself to use it in a sentence in everyday life every day for a week . 
  so on average you 'll learn seven new words every week . 
  ( at any one time you 'll have seven words you need to use during a day ) and it works for your native language as well . 
  mac had a screensaver that presented uncommon words, 
  absolutely not . 
  while the sentiment is * nice * it has the drawback that other thoughts struggle with when you include * lesser * into a group . 
  it diminishes the high regard of the group as a whole . 
  my last relationship , her father had been a priest and her mother gad been a deacon . 
  they had 6 children and there were super chill about it and kept their faith to themselves . 
  had no problem accepting me as an atheist . 
  they called the people that were super into it * helheliga * ( a play on words hel means whole and heliga means holy ) and the religious people that judge others they dispised . 
  god is the one that judges . 
  i 'd say it is . 
  you just have to belive that god exists to be religious imo . 
  the practice is a personal matter, 
  only english should answer ? 
  oh what age is this . 
  we so ours in eight and ninth grade ( 13-16 depending when your bday is and what semester ), 
  wait what ? 
  you get paid for doing mandatory school practice ? 
  several times a week is see norwegian registred tesla in gothenburg, 
  is that the mandatory in school ? 
  becuase we have mandatory two weeks in eight and ninth grade where we do some kind of practical work out in the real world, 
  imagine you have a list of problems . 
  on the top of the list is that pesky problem that is the worst .
