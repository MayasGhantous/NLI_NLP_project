  malm\u00f6 griffins dominated american football in sweden during the nineties . 
  ( griffin being the cities coat of arms . 
  other american football teams are * carlstad crusaders * tyres\u00f6 royal crowns ( tyres\u00f6 is a rather posh suburb to the capital ) * arlanda jets ( arlanda is sweden largest airport ) * lule\u00e5 eskimos ( probably the most northern team in the tier 1 and tier 2 series ) * g\u00f6teborg marvels * staffanstorp saviours in ice hockey both malm\u00f6 redhawks and fr\u00f6lunda indians are teams with that kind of name, 
  what letter does * vendetta * start with ? 
  they mean that they 're testing them . 
  i 've never heard them outside of this schedule .

  ia your master thesis about reddit ? 
  and why is n't it ? 
  i do n't know much and only read a few headers . 
  but string human rights when its more needed is stupid . 
  human rights are never needed when everything is fine and dandy . 
  they rights are in place for when its not nice and dandy . 
  same logic as with freedom of speech . 
  it 's only needed when it 's uncomfortable.if only comfortable things are said the rule is moot . 
  wait what ? 
  you have nordic country days ? 
  tell us more about that . 
  imo the problem is not an aging population , it also means that we 're healthier and can work for longer . 
  the problem is automation imo . 
  sure historically we 've had tech progression that made jobs obsolete but nothing in this scale . 
  today i got up from bed and went to work . 
  first day this week becuase gurra vasa . 
  now i 'm at work and i 'm writing this ... * to be continued *, 
  i made this thread a while back that got a lot of relevant responses what have you learned from / r/askeurope that blew your mind ? 
   put another way , i do live in europe and if i would spend my life actually ** trying ** to get killed in a genuine terrorist attack in western europe , i would be extremely unlikely to succeed in a whole lifetime . 
  unless * he 's * the terrorist , amirite ? 
  i can only think of one right off the bat . 
  karlstad on the shores of our biggest lake v\u00e4nern is called `` solstad '' ( sun city , not sin city ) oh another one very close to v\u00e4nern , although it 's atually three of them and they 're called trestad ( three city ) ( trollh\u00e4ttan , uddevalla , v\u00e4nersborg ) because of they 're proximity to eachother but tbh , they are n't that close to eachother . 
  30km and 15km found a list , here 's an excerpt * bor\u00e5s = textile city * gr\u00e4nna = [ polka pig city ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/5b/86/f4/5b86f4384cafb01d984d50fb62166e82.jpg ) * g\u00f6teborg = g\u00f6tet , and little london * helsingborg = pearl of the sound ( like the waterway ), 
  i think you 're mistaken , today it 's 494 years since gustav vasa was elected to be king of sweden . 
  \u00c5h herre gud you beat me to it, 
  do you need help ? 
  should i call someone for you ? 
  who 's your next of kin ? 
   but i think a doctor is present because my mom always points at the doctor that ` birthed me ' . 
  is it your dad ? 
  if police in cars count i see them several times a day usually . 
  population : 575k within city limits, 
  i was n't meaning literally betting , i meant just as you said but tried to make it sound like you bet on the wrong horse and is now paying for it . 
  so in essence you bet your money on the wrong man ? 
  i do n't really know is where to begin . 
  even though i do n't do the illegal stuff i still change my behavior because i assume everything i do is logged for profiling and pure * guilt by association * is going to become a thing i guarantee it . 
  and i have one of the most privacy concerned isp in sweden ( bahnhof ) . 
  that 's pretty damn cool by the magazine . 
  wow , a v40 ? 
  those are almost claustrophobic, 
  copenhagen , dad worked on the boats before the bridge was built so i was in denmark a lot and as an adult i 've worked in periods in copenhagen, 
  intuitively that sounds like maintenance will be much more expensive than consolidating to one or two brands . 
  my mom 's first car was a fiat 600, 
  oh you do n't purchase car centrally ? 
  every region buy their own ? 
  we use a bunch of different cars but a clear majority is volvo xc70 . 
  but there are some `` specialty cars . '', 
  in the seventies we had like 8 porsches, 
  i did n't know austria produced their own car brand . 
  what was it ? 
  or is this so ancient it 's pre world war one ? 
  went coast to coast and except for the pacific north west florida is the only coastal state i did n't go through . 
  it 's because it opens up for other countrymen to partake in the discussion . 
  i do that with most questions i ask on here . 
  half of the reason i ask is to open up for interesting discussions , not only because om curious . 
  the subreddit needs non-loaded and non-travel questions , 
  the emperor accidently blew up alderaan instead of andorra, 
  well if you compare the danish number system how you read clock it makes sense . 
  they base it on twenties , so if they say tres ( threes ) it means three times twenty ( 60 ) but if you say half tres it does n't mean 0.5 x 3 x 20 ( 30 ) , it means half way between 40 and 60 ( 50 ) just like a clock , half six is n't halfway between 0 and 6 , it means halfway between five and six, 
  what about * a place in the sun * - people ? 
  how many are those ? 
  have you had a look at the fidget cube ? 
  i got to try it a while back and i think it would work much better for us retards than a fidget spinner . 
  what do the sentences mean ? 
  thanks , that 's a pretty cool site . 
  it 's not too far from swedish [ * natt * ] ( https://forvo.com/word/natt/#sv ) ( or german nacht ), 
  i recommend a [ fidget cube ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5eq0tvxckw ) instead, 
  you might get hooked, 
   i do n't know why i had to come up with the tits in the first place . 
  [ you really have no idea ? 
  how do you pronounce noc ? 
  is it like knock or notch ? 
  italia ? 
  read the rest of the thread because apparently , some swedes use middag as mid-day , i 've never heard anyone do that . 
   i also use gryning ( `` dawn '' ) . 
  would you say that gryning is a sliding scale on what the time shows for this ? 
  i did n't want to include words that changes of what time of year it is . 
  * runt/vid lunch * is something i often refer to when something going to happen between 11-13 . 
  i 'm sorry to all non-swedish readers . 
   do you really say `` lunch '' or did you miss the `` middag '' before that ? 
  no we say lunch , middag traditionally what you ate mid day ( it actually literally means mid day ) but it 's now something you eat as dinner, 
   its not like they would show us any mercy or compassion . 
  and that is what defines us as a non-barbaric civilization . 
  if we 're fighting for our liberties and the freedom a democracy entails . 
  if we started behaving barbaric , are we still better than them ? 
  check out / r/backpacking and / r/travel when you 're young and travel alone you 're going to meet a bunch of people .
