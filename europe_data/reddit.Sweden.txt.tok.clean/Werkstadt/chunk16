  nederlandish ? 
  oh shots fired , even from neutral schweiz, 
  met some swiss lady backpackers in thailand , speaking english with them i first thought they were dutch because some raspy sounds that were similar to dutch g sound . 
  did not know swiss-german was so different, 
  york yankee-slashers , stockholm star-and-stripes-scalpers , warsaw wallcrushers, 
  telia in sweden implemented it in march if i remember or it might have been only for the nordic countries,

  is that you , caligula constantine ? 
  are all those names of girls you fancied ? 
  maybe that 's why :p, 
  that 's some / r/de gold right there . 
  can we get some context for this ? 
  so not salmonella and chlamydia ? 
  and am-bro if it 's a little dude , amirite ? 
  are n't london sydney non stop without refueling the longest one now thanks to the dreamliner ? 
  start here http://prepaid-data-sim-card.wikia.com/wiki/prepaid_sim_with_data, 
  thanks for that answer . 
  try cross posting in / r/backpacking they know all this, 
  start here http://prepaid-data-sim-card.wikia.com/wiki/prepaid_sim_with_data then try / r/backpacking and / r/travel they are more equipped to answer your questions, 
  i have only one place on my bucket list in the western hemisphere , and it 's aruba . 
  i 'd like to busy other places too but, 
  iirc there 's a sub called / r/iwantout that handles these question way better than here, 
  i ca n't think of anyone under fifty that would be bothered that you assume they speak english . 
  but being humble is a sign of respect, 
  not really overseas ? 
  yeah nothing bad has ever happened when nations merge into a new country/federation . 
  especially one where a diverse culture is involved . 
  it 's arrogant to think that * our * generation is much more enlightened than the previous one . 
  wait what , does andorra have territory on sardinia ? 
  i have the micronations of europe on my bucket list, 
  that 's not far in between , maybe i 'll do a double whammy on both when i go, 
  so you 're saying that i can count spain to my list of visited countries ? 
  :p i count canaries to africa but spain the country . 
  ( something like greenland to denmark ), 
  intuitively i would n't count them . 
  i do n't know if they are just another `` region '' of continental spain or they are something similar to \u00c5land, 
  really ? 
  aruba is on my bucket list and the only country in the western hemisphere that 's on that  might have to reconsider, 
  gief back !, 
  i 'd assume there is a majority in ni that does n't want to unite , so the pressure is mostly from roi ? 
  from what i understand this is what he meant . 
  the title sounds like unemployment pay for x weeks after en employment end while his description sound much more like * welfare *, 
  apart from ni , how much of an opposition is there * really * in the uk of letting ireland unite ? 
  federal eu \u2260 unified europe, 
  if everything goes wrong we 'll have a federalized eu , i hope i 'm dead by then . 
  as maninthewoods said , those was n't even reinforcements , it was an exchange 1:1, 
  it does sound like you 're not really digging this, 
  at least we 're doing something right if we 're pissing of the danes :d, 
  this right here . 
  i love the 18 + hours a day daylight but i 'm not sure it 's worth the 18 hours of darkness . 
  nooo , do n't give them the means to blitz to sweden !, 
  unless k\u00e4rringk\u00e5nk is called hag-hauling in english i 'm going to be sad, 
  iirc you have a ice hockey world championship gold, 
   the relative grading system was really confusing since the actual grades did n't relate to what you actually had learnt . 
  it was a ranking between students using a normal distribution , 38 % was given a 3 , 24 % a 2 or a 4 and 7 % a 1 or a 5 . 
  it was changed a bit in lgr 80 so that while 3 remained the average ** there were no percentages any more . 
  ** stupid system imo . 
  most teachers kept the percentages in their grading after this anyway  and finally , the grade ig in the lpo 94 system did n't actually exist in primary school . 
  if you did n't fulfil the requirements for a pass ( g ) you simply was n't graded in that subject . 
  yes , we got a dash ( - ) if it was failed . 
   university is different as well . 
  u is fail , but then there 's two different systems that i 've come across . 
  either it 's g ( pass ) and vg ( pass with distinction ) , or 3 ( pass ) , 4 ( pass with distinction ) and 5 ( pass with particular distinction ) . 
  the latter system is mostly used in science and engineering while other faculty 's seem to prefer the first system . 
  i have both systems in my degree , with some courses only having u or g as available options . 
  i do believe that depends on what kind you go to . 
  nurse school both in malm\u00f6 and gothenburg could only get g and vg ( and u ) , there was no mvg, 
  as a little trivia . 
  through out the years there 's been quite a bit of different grading . 
  between 1897 and 1962 there was a system with letters * a = with excellent praise * a = with excellent praise approved * ab = with praise approved * ba = not without praise approved * b = approved * bc = not fully approved * c failure / insufficient sometimes even b ? 
  was used * b ? 
  = with doubt approved between 1962 and 1994 ( the year i was born were the last ones to use this system until we graduated ) during this period only students in grade 8 and up got marks , younger only had talks with the teachers + parents . 
  it was a horrible system because you were pitted against each other ( the system between 1994 and 2011 had set parameters that you were expected for every grade no matter how many else did achieve that ) * 5 = top 7 % * 4 = 24 % * 3 = 38 % * 2 = 24 % * 1 = botton 7 % 1994-2011 , this system had the problem that there was an incredible inflation with the grades . 
  the teachers became more and more lenient with giving a good grade . 
  as an comparance . 
  if you get all g you got an average score of 10 , vg gives 15 and mvg gives 20 ( it 's the number you use for university applications ) . 
  in one of the second tier cities in sweden ( bor\u00e5s ) the best student had an average of 17.6 iirc . 
  the years leading up to 2011 several students in every class had a 20.0 . 
  * mvg = very well approved * vg = well approved * g = approved * ig = not approved what 's going on now i do n't really know but i think someone else posted that . 
  do you know of anyone who elected not to study english in school ? 
  anal is a kind of contraceptives, 
  anal is a great way to not have kids , do anal . 
  164cm is avg for women in sweden . 
  167cm for women between 18-30 . 
  for a person that does n't have a very active job . 
  shower three times a week is probably suffice . 
  you 'll spare your skin that really does n't do well for showering every day . 
  what ?!, 
  why ? 
  did someone complain ? 
  reading the title i thought you literally meant that if you were born before or after week 40 . 
  that 's true , the only european country i 've been to in the last 17 years is denmark and they do n't have the euro either . 
  i try to go much much further when i travel, 
  oh yes . 
  my brother in law , finlandssvensk was at mcdonald 's in helsinki . 
  asked for a straw , clerk blushed, 
   i ca n't imagine how it would have gone , if he was n't with us ... english ?
