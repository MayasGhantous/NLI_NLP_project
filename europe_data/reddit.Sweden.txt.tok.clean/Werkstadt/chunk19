  if you let my daughter go now that 'll be the end of it . 
  i will not look for you , i will not pursue you , but if you do n't , i will look for you , i will find you and i will kill you . 
  finno-ugric i believe it 's called https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finno-ugric_languages, 
  you 'll always be our little bastard son that we wo n't recognize . 
  love you all the same , 
  well finland is a completely different linguisticly but their one of the five nordic countries so based one language alone it does n't have to be an issue, 
  that 's interesting . 
  i and many other swedes joke about us never eating the last bit of something as archtypical swedish . 
  we often call it * svenskbiten * ( the swedish bit ) and something we feel a bit ashamed of for feeling ashamed, 
  * slow clap * , 
  apparently dad-humor and puns is synonymous with gothenburg . 
  i do n't think it is though ( and i 'm not from this region ), 
  awesome answer . 
  thanks . 
  those are old mens wt name . 
  liam and kevin is the latest generation, 
  it 's hard to describe exactly what exactly made me feel insecure . 
  sf i accidentally walked into the tenderloin and it looked rough and has been warned about it a day earlier . 
  in a bus station in jackson , mississippi some ghetto banger started talking to me , bounty hunters came in asking questions . 
  motel in millegeville , ga , very sketchy characters . 
  safest i felt was ponchatoula , la. 
  french quarters was alright i guess but you were always aware of your surroundings . 
  never felt secure enough to actually relax . 
  being out at 3am in down-town bangkok , i feel more secure than i do in my home town of gothenburg at six in the afternoon when it 's dark . 
  it 's highly unlikely that i 'll pay for another vacation in the us , i have so many other places i want to visit . 
  to add to this . 
  in gymnasium you choose a program . 
  different programs are put together by different courses . 
  like economy program , science program , electrician program, 
   it may come from different approaches to time off . 
  americans tend to try to cram as much as possible into vacations in general , not just ones to europe . 
  most of us do n't get vacation time , maybe it 's related but i 'm not sure , swedes get 25 ( 5 weeks ) of paid vacation every year by law ( or extra pay that represent 25 days vacation if you do n't have a permanent employment ) so we 're not in such a hurry . 
   we also have a google map of places we want to see , sometimes it is a specific museum or monument , sometimes it is just a country . 
  i 'll speak for myself , travelling is my main priority so seeing stuff is absolutely on my itinerary but not at the expense of chilling and relaxing . 
  bali is coming up in four months , researched a bunch of stuff i want to see an experience ( been there once before but only for 8 days ) but i will not pack my days with any * musts * , it 's all loosely planned ( we have 5 sleep over destinations , with day trips * planned * around them . 
  there is no way i 'd just beach bum for a week and do nothing else , i just wo n't cram my vacation . 
  i was in thailand a couple of weeks ago , going solo , not answering to any commitments to anyone . 
  so if i did n't feel like the thing i thought about doing , no worries , have a beer . 
   i would love to travel in europe . 
  my wife and i want to rent some motorcycles in italy and ride through the alps and up to the uk . 
  we like sport touring in the us and think it would be a fun way to experience europe , via back roads and small towns . 
   i have a 4wd i will take out to remote areas looking for old mining camps , or just camping in a new spot each night . 
  i plan to drive to both mexico and canada , and would like to explore southern africa by 4wd . 
  i would n't say that 's cramming , you 're kind of winging it , stop where you * feel * like it unless you imagine doing it in 3 days . 
  i wonder if it 's related to americans living such a large part of their lives in the car it 's not weird to spend half of the vacation on the move ? 
  i agree with you ... but it 's still not * the big apple * it 's also a couple of more hours on a plane and extra cash for the ticket however , it 's very common that people that go on vacation stare blindly at the air fare without regard how much cost of living is on the destination . 
  it 's cheaper for us to go 2 weeks to thailand ( south east asia in general ) than 2 weeks to to the canaries, 
  i do n't understand what you mean ? 
  how did you meet your girlfriend ? 
  exactly , so your comment still does n't make sense, 
   we see europe as a place where you go to ** relax ** for a vacation funny how 100 % of the people from the us that ask vacation questions in / r/askeurope has nothing to do with relaxing but instead stacking up a checkmark list of stuff they * need * to see . 
  it 's not pokemon i went coast to coast ( ca , tx , la , ga and ma ) with my brother 20 years ago when i was 19 . 
  it was a bit scary . 
  a lot happened but i wished i would 've done it differently and when i was a little bit older . 
  i 'm far from upper class , all my spare money go to travelling . 
  i have no wish to go back, 
   i doubt the aristocracy in chile ( whatever that is ) the snobs , the upper class, 
  / u/riverbero19 stated that the difference between isis and pkk is religious . 
  and i answered his post that there are other europeans that are considered terrorist ** even ** if they 're not religious . 
  i was comparing pkk with eta and ira my comment has zero to do with isis and i still do n't understand why you 're even telling me : `` they are still way different than is '' . 
  are you replying to the correct message ? 
  kevin a wt name for boys in sweden . 
  do turks cover their hair ? 
  do you mean head scarfs or something else like a fez ? 
  i do n't trust them on certain issues , but i 've stopped reading newspaper all together a few years back for two reasons . 
  all newspapers have an agenda now and reading an article i have an inner dialog with myself and one of the presumed moron that gets upset for something completely reasonable because the news paper emphasized some sort of victim in the article . 
  when i stopped reading news papers my quality of life increased a lot . 
  disclaimer : it happens that i read an article from time to time but it 's a conscious decision and not the bulk consummation . 
  i do n't watch the news either since ten years back . 
  the really important news become aware of anyway . 
  they noise pollute, 
  wait what ? 
  free mowing and you sabotage it ? 
  https://translate.google.com/m/translate#de/en/%c3%9cber click the speaker , do n't mind the weird translation, 
  https://translate.google.com/m/translate#de/en/das%20boot/ click the speaker symbol, 
  similar but not exactly . 
  click link and then speaker symbol https://translate.google.com/m/translate#de/en/das%20boot/, 
  you mean like the ira and eta ? 
  like spring bok ? 
  there was a time i knew rudimentary school spanish . 
  had a girlfriend from chile at the time . 
  she called me a snob for * lisping * . 
  i assume the aristocracy in south america speaks proper spanish, 
  das boot pronounced like the foot wear . 
  just to be clear , do you mean bell pepper ? 
  i 'd say that all * sovereign citizens * are anarchists , but not all anarchists are sovereign citizens . 
  ~ ~ [ de'anthony thomas ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rz_eim9ev0i ) ( look for number 6 ) a running back that used to play for oregon ducks , i believe he was drafted by kansas city chiefs but he have n't gotten much play time . 
  he 's a really too small for the nfl , the defenders are not college football defenders ( the youtube clip is from his college days ) ~ ~ ~ ~ why ? 
  he 's speed and agility is amazing , it looks too easy when he 's feigning , he turns so quickly because of his size ~ ~ ~ ~ running back is a player that gets handed the ball by the quarter back behind the line of scrimage and tries to run through the defence . 
  a full back tries to do the same but not with speed but with momentum . ~ ~ edit . 
  sorry , not european , did n't read the question correctly, 
  not where i lived now but in some places i have and yes , they annoy me , but then again , neighbours smoking annoy me infinitely more, 
  i 've travelled a bit ( last time solo ) and i think it 's customary to learn basic phrases ( hello , thank you , good bye , excuse me ) in the countries language you 're travelling to . 
  i think it 's rude not to . 
  and the reaction from people when you say it with genuine sentiment is absolutely worth it . 
  i do n't expect tourists coming to sweden to do this but * when * they do my reaction is the same as i experience abroad . 
  oooh , sisters of mercy !, 
  good choice, 
  hush now , do n't tell anyone !!, 
  how so ?
