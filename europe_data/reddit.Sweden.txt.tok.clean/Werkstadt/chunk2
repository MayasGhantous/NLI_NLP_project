  stupid newspaper , always making it sound worse than it is . 
  thank you for explaining it to me . 
  i have n't really researching my assumption . 
  it 's been almost two decades , i should feel ashamed . 
  so only * straight * porn then ? 
  i heard that some cinemas in denmark ( or just copenhagen ) even started subtitle danish films with danish subtitles in some cases . 
  i studied spanish ( school spanish ) in high school . 
  a couple of years later i had a girlfriend whose parents were from chile but she grew up in sweden . 
  i spoke a little spanish with her , you know the kind with the little lisp and she was just * you damn snob * . 
  i assume it 's just the high society people in south america that speaks spanish as it originated while the rabble did n't . 
   dubbing can be even better than the original , even if that 's hard to believe for you total bs , there is no way the dubbing can be better than the original spoken word  yea the emotions or whatever might come over better , but then i got ta read along and ca n't look at people 's facial expressions f.e. 
  so i 'm missing something either way . 
  when you 're english level gets better * because * you have subtitles you wo n't need to read the subtitles because you 're english will be good enough at that time . 
  how many fucks given ? 
  or taken ? 
  what should we name it ? 
  stormaktstiden 2.0 , reboot or just the new batch, 
  * by * means * village *, 
  except the satanists ... 
  well ... was the cat alive ? 
  because i 've heard some stories about norweigan metalheads ... just sayin ', 
  someone should really subtitle this . 
  i found it fascinating . 
  * we do not row ... *, 
  either it 's just your relations , i do n't know of anyone i know that uses these terms inaccurately, 
  [ do n't worry about it ] ( https://i.imgur.com/iexckjs.jpg ), 
  i think it 's more of a generational thing , getting influences from the english language . 
  vovve is from vov . 
  ask a little older people in your region and ask what they say, 
  dog goes vov in swedish , not voff source : https://i.imgur.com/xqt3ogx.png, 
  it 's gin and rum served in a bell, 
  it seems that you are no data aladeen, 
   k\u00f6benhavn / malm\u00f8 as the capital city called broen \u00d6restad / \u00d8reby, 
  you 're forgetting employer fee . 
  it 's taken into account for those 60 % . 
  they 're not talking about taxes for high earners . 
  employer has 10k to spend on you . 
  first around 30 % is taken out of that . 
  you get 7k in salary , then you pay about 31 % income tax roughly 2.2 k leaving you with less than half of what the employer had to spend , and then another 25 % vat ( moms ) leaving you with 3.5 k of actual worth ( with exceptions where vat do n't apply\u0142, 
  co2 is n't dirty . 
   i have heard that electricity is cheap ( compared to what , i do n't know ) in sweden , so i would assume that electricity would be a popular means . 
  i 'm pretty certain that everyone of them would choose another method if they had the means . 
  imo electricity is not cheap . 
  i just did a check on the total cost of what i pay for a kwh and it 's spot on on 0.15 cad / kwh, 
  yes , i did n't mean that it * was * water , i just tried to make a funny comparance . 
  it 's the same , co2 is n't stored , which means that all carbon based material ( aka hydrocarbons ) which is made up from hydrogen and carbon ( kol och v\u00e4te ) . 
  when burned the carbon part of the atom reacts with the air and produces carbon-dioxide ( kol och syre ) . 
  if the fuel you burn is made up from 1 million carbon atoms , 1 million * carbon-dioxides * are released into the atmosphere . 
  it 's not country specific . 
  the only thing that differs is the `` energy density '' of the fuel you 're burning , but that 's pretty much based on how much carbon atoms ( and hydrogen in the molecule ) are in the fuel . 
  it 's pretty much the same with the stuff your body burns for energy , you expel co2 and water vapour just like a combustion engine does through your lungs . 
  carbon hydrogen ( c and h ) goes in , reacts ( o = oxygen ) and comes out as h2o ( vapour ) and co2 . 
  if you mean in absolute numbers compared to other countries or per capita , yes , then it 's much lower . 
  ok it 's not absolute zero but it 's marginally small . 
  i actually pulled the numbers for 2015 on the one and here are some that 's * noteworthy * on a plant that i have visited ( s\u00e4ven\u00e4s ) ** expelled into the air ** * 13kg arsenic * 2kg cadmium * 85000kg co * 532800000kg co2 ( expected for anything carbon based that 's burned , this is where the energy extracted resides ) * 82kg chromium * 57kg copper * 0.00002 kg dioxins ( this is the dangerous stuff ) * 32kg fluoride * 4kg mercury * 9500kg ( n2o ) nitrous oxide * 1700kg ( nh3 ) ammonia * 166 kg nickel * 172600kg ( nox ) nitrous oxide * 36kg lead * 5700kg sulfuric dioxide * 900kg `` ash '' * 759kg zinc ** released into water ** * 1875000kg chloride * 0.6 kg chromium * 0.7 kg copper * 0.0000019 kg dioxins * 0.1 kg mercury * 0.8 nickel * 43000kg nitrogen ( water is 2 nitrogen and 1 oxygen ) * 0.2 kg lead * 3.3 kg zinc i know it sounds like a lot just looking at it but it 's really marginally , numbers from 2014 states that the plant produced a total of 417 gwh heat ( distributed through the city , gothenburg , second largest ) and 40gwh electricity . 
  uhm , i would n't say that 532800 tons ( 2015 s\u00e4ven\u00e4s f\u00f6rbr\u00e4nningsanl\u00e4ggning ) are minor . 
  however , co2 is not a dangerous gas , it 's just something that always gets expelled by burning carbon based stuff, 
  only co2 and vapor , nothing else . 
  they use a lot of different methods to get it all out by chemical reactions . 
  sweden being a fairly long country north to south ( meteorologically we can have 3 season at the same time depending on what part of the country you 're in ) it 's uncommon to get hotter than 25c and it 's usually around 20c in the summer example : july 2016 had an average temperature ( day and night for all 31 days ) of 16c in the southernmost parts, 
  there is a distinct difference in what americans and europeans perceive as freedom . 
  in the us it 's the `` freedom * from * '' while in europe it 's the `` freedom * to * '', 
   this and a high dependence on electricity for heating houses not very common that i know of, 
  ac is n't common at all , office buildings maybe , homes , not common ( i know no one that has ), 
  tbh , heating with electricity i do n't think it 's very common , i know of one cottage that has electric heating , no one i know other than that heats with electricity ( i know that it exists but it 's not that common . 
  45 % hydro , 45 % nuclear ( other 10 % is a mix of wind and solar and stuff like that ) iirc and no fossil fuels unless you take the garbage incineration with 95 % efficiency into account . 
   this is only for warming the house itself , not for providing warm water for you know , showers and stuff like that . 
  i do n't know about finland but in sweden that 's exactly how it works . 
  the water in these pipes are often tinted green so that you would know if the distributed heated water got in your pipes somehow ( ie in the heat exchanger ), 
  sweden as a whole just passed 10m, 
  [ * riktiga m\u00e4n luktar mutta * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_kjaik7poa ), 
  maybe if taking population per ikea into account sweden has more ... maybe, 
  in swedish they are always named in a certain order * estland , lettland , litauen * which makes it easy to remember in what order they are from north to south . 
  finland is n't really scandinavian and it 's closest language relatives are estonian and hungarian, 
  easy now , do n't gag on it , go slow, 
  why not both ? 
  denmark , norway and sweden are both nordic and scandinavian, 
  nordic countries \u2260 scandinavia . 
  scandinavia is only denmark , sweden , norway . 
  nordic countries are scandinavia + finland + iceland . 
  finnish and estonian language are related iirc danish , swedish and norwegian , icelandic is nothing like finnish and estonian . 
  but i think the whole eesti into nordic is pretty darn cute, 
  yet still a war crime, 
   on the other hand , perhaps it was a good thing in the long run that people saw the horrors of nuclear weapons and we restrained from making the cold a hot one . 
  i 'm thinking of the cuba crisis first of all where they were minutes from launching nukes from a russian sub . 
  i wonder if the men would have hesitated if they did n't know the effects of hiroshima and nagasaki . 
  but then again , maybe there would n't have been a nuke race if the * real * effect was n't known, 
  ** warning ** some people need to experience the effect of [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/gallery/7oirw ) as well, 
  uhm ... 
  rockets depart from florida due to excess water to the east . 
  houston is where missions are directed from . 
  the person that do earn enough for the * gold digger * might want to dodge that bullet too ? 
  it was his personal property , not the country 's, 
  lund is like 30 minute train ride from copenhagen , crazy close, 
  the mission is to disrupt our free society , impeding our freedom ** that also affects ordinary citizens ** is a reaction to terrorism , mission accomplished . 
  the flag you 're talking about is not the flag of scania/sk \u00e5ne . 
  it 's the flag for the former danish provinces ( sk\u00e5ne , blekinge and halland ) common mistake, 
  how compact exactly ? 
  sweden , norway and finland are the 4th ,5 th and 7th largest countries in europe ( russia excluded ) out of nearly 50, 
  roman mars ?
