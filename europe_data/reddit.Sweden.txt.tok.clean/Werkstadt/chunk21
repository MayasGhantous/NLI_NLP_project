  asking for a friend, 
  colloquial an \u00e4lg ( moose/elk ), 
  i know that , i just simplified it, 
  25 % is the base vat . 
  6 % culture vat like theater , books , transports like taxi , bus , boats , iirc cinema used to but is now excluded from this . 
  12 % food , restaurants , hotels and art 0 % healthcare , banks , insurance business to business do n't pay vat . 
  so the p90 is technically not an smg . 
  the definition is that it fires pistol ammo . 
  the p90 fires [ 5.7 x28mm ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/fn_5.7\u00d728mm ) projectiles . 
  does n't smg use pistol ammo ? 
  p90 uses the nato round . 
  is that an upgraded version of the p90 ? 
  wow , the folded one at a glance looks like famas, 
  i thought we used a modified version of the g3 or am i thinking of the ak4 ? 
  turning 40 this year and still gets carded for both alcohol and lottery tickets . 
  not sure if it 's a compliment anymore, 
  we have * gast * which is a kind of ghost . 
  the etymology origin ( from frisian g\u00e1st ) is probably the same but usually swedes will translate ghost to * sp\u00f6ke * . 
  we also have * geng\u00e5ngare * which is dead people who haunts . 
  usually they died violently, 
  oh i was sure wales was a kingdom . 
  til, 
  it feels unintuitive that gb is scotland , england and wales but uk is gb + northern ireland . 
  it would sounds more logical of it was the other way since northern ireland is n't a kingdom ( ? ), 
  now it does . 
  the cheese !, 
  a friend of mine put [ this ] ( https://i.imgur.com/poy84qd.png ) up on instagram ... 
  it 's not because it 's european , it 's eurovision, 
  does n't get much more pompous than that, 
  wait what , does your emblem have a sickle and hammer ? 
  what 's with the tilted cross on top ? 
  i think you have the wrong one ... 
  i did some research and [ here 's ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8xunicz.jpg ) the real one ( also for finland , norway and denmark ), 
   his grand son gustav adolf looks like irl james bond . 
  have n't you learned anything ? 
  people with that kind of collar is always the antagonist !, 
  how messed up was buildings and infrastructure after wwii ? 
  i mean we 've all seen german cities laid in ruins by the end of the war , but i ca n't say i have ever seen post war pictures of norway . 
  genuinely interested, 
   kings that may or may not have existed pffft , like they never existed !, 
   but colliqually often `` england '' . 
  i believe people are getting better and better on differentiate england from storbritannien . 
  car hooligans ? 
  * it 's complicated ... *, 
    police rather focus on dealers  not here . 
  possession is at least as bad in most cases . 
  more patrons to the prisons , the cash must flow, 
   the problem is our powerful and extensive system of for-profit prisons . 
  cons in cells means money in the bank . 
  `` oh , hey mr politician , how about you tighten up those laws so we can get more * patrons * in our * hotels * and i make sure you 'll get reelected for another period '' this right here is one of the reasons i consider the us a corrupt society . 
  most people think of corruption as cops taking money for not fining you or take you to jail or something similar while there is a huge * industry * in the us , corps essentially buying laws is just one of a long list . 
  it 's insane to have for-profit prisons . 
  i can just see an endless line of people waiting to bend over and get a paddlin ' in every eu city square `` now , i hope you learned a lesson , do n't pull that shit ever again '' . 
  obviously with an accent, 
  the most important question ... pre-sliced or unsliced ? 
  i 'd love to wake up at your place ... 
  midsummer is the biggest celebration of the year . 
  we however also have a [ majst\u00e5ng ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/majstang_14_068.jpg ) but we do n't raise one to celebrate the beginning of the summer but rather the longest day of the year , hence * midsummer * . 
  i 'm flabbergasted . 
  i do n't know what to say , it seems incredibly childish . 
  * i guess you had to be there * either way . 
  it 's * only * ** makedonien ** ( yes , hard k ) in sweden and that wo n't change . 
  explain why they will veto . 
  i genuinely want to know, 
  i bet it 's hasch cake ... friday and all, 
  shots fired, 
  is it final ? 
  i 've even looked at airbnb and flights there !, 
  i 'll recommend a post on imgur i saw yesterday http://imgur.com/gallery/kgdxy edit : i ca n't receive broadcasts so i ca n't tell you how popular it is . 
  if you 're into nordic noir , some swedish shows are great and very popular in uk and a couple of films and shows have been renade by the us , but obviously not as well done but cater to the us, 
  by the end 1965 there was only 1 924 225 cars and lorries registered in sweden . 
  2016 there was 31.7 million cars in the uk . 
  ( unsure about the lorries ) . 
  ** most ** of you have no idea how much 360cc is . 
  most of you do n't have a clue how much 360cc is . 
  i belive a civil war is much more likely because if federalisation than a large scale war if we do n't federalize while others want a powerful eu because other economic superpowers emerge . 
  i think it 's much more likely for full scale superpower war if the world consist of 5-7 super powers than a world with 200 sovereign nations with 1-3 super powers . 
  because 200 nations governments have more political push than 4 super powers squabbling , maneuvering , manipulating, 
  absolutely not . 
  this is a joke . 
  op ca n't be without internet for 6-12h but rather spend 10 days at sea . 
  sorry , i ca n't take this seriously, 
  yeah , ut it 's not presented that it has any meaning for the viewer . 
  10cc of x medication means nothing to the viewer , they just want to present some * sciency stuff * that does n't matter if it 's 10cc or 250mg . 
  it 's probably a true amount but the viewer wo n't care enough to make sense of it . 
  a law ca n't change how people use units . 
  in exactly the same way you ca n't force a law that you have to speak with a certain dialect . 
  it 's how people use it that mandates edit : iirc uk have a law that you have to have prices in litres and kilograms and what happened was that they show both and uk is n't any closer to metric in common usage . 
  ( i do n't have a source , it 's just something i heard ), 
   as for tv , you wo n't hear it much outside of crime dramas and shows like `` grey 's anatomy . '' not sure what kind of tv you watch , but every us show on tv here never used si-units unless they try to sound super sciency just for the reason of sounding super sciency, 
  * yes * possibly , it 's relative , prefer vodka based * yes * * mumbles intelligibly * * mad horse disease ? 
  i 'm sure the common man has it easier multiplying with 1.6 ( ~ 150 % ) than remember the fibonacci sequence ( probably people that knows the sequence already know how to convert ) . 
   eh to each their own , i guess . 
  and , yeah , i guess i am not much of a proper adult it 's just banter since the standard [ * sm\u00f6rg\u00e5s * ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/norwegian.open.sandwich-01.jpg/270px-norwegian.open.sandwich-01.jpg ) ( literally butter goose ) in sweden is open faced , it 's the kind of sandwich most swedes have on their breakfast table . 
   i 'm 40 this year but not very properly grown-up . 
  are you me ? 
   the extra slice on top prevents your fingers from getting into the stuff on the sandwich while hence the * adult * part . 
  without the extra bread slice , much more tasty sandwich which dilutes the experience, 
  i usually say that there 's only 5 countries that can win the wc in ice hockey . 
  russia , canada , sweden , finland and czechia .
