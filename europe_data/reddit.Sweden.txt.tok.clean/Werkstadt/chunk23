  i sadly turned off when the score was 5-1 : /, 
  you should change your flair . 
  edit : if you ca n't be bothered with specifying your country in your comments while missing a country flair ... 
  this was the defeat that was on my mind writing the question, 
  what sport ? 
  gothenburg it snowed in may in 2014 and ~ ~ 2017 ~ ~ edit : it was by the end if april 2017, 
  i do n't think dead are allowed to vote ... 
  it snowed in southern sweden just last week although it disappeared within hours . 
  the second half of this week has been 16-19 degrees . 
  but it was also 17 degrees april 1st . 
  yes , spring has been very late this year imo, 
   christer pettersson was the lead suspect for a long while he was even convicted for the murder but later absolved, 
  that 's what * they * want you to think and presumably doing hell of a great job doing it, 
   i use english everyday on the internet but when i have to engage with an english speaker in real life i still struggle . 
  i met some backpackers on a bus station on northern thailand , we were going to the same place but on different buses , it took a few minutes in english before i asked them where they were from and they said sweden . 
  none of us realized that we were from the same country . 
  usually you can hear on the accent where they from . 
  it 's all relative , growing up in sk\u00e5ne i can distinguish around twenty regional dialects alone in that one province . 
  iirc swedish school is out for nine weeks , from around 10th june, 
  the swedish word for food is * mat * and its never used for anything but meals . 
  i assume food is also only meals . 
  not candy , cake , potato chips, 
  i 'm really not trying to be offensive . 
  but when you you talk about crispy snacks like junk * food * i 'm wondering if it 's considered food in the usa and if that 's part of the obesity problem ? 
  when i hear * junk food * i think of places that serve fast food, 
  i was hoping for hungary ... 
  i 'm not complaining , just stating it , 
  my question is , how can you ** not ** come to that conclusion . 
  so , it 's net negative . 
  you wrote between 2 and 3 . so between willys/city gross and lidl/netto, 
  username checks out . 
   immigrants tend to create more jobs than they take . 
  there is a difference on what kind of job that is . 
  if it 's state/municipal/etc funded jobs that 's negative revenue for the society . 
  if it 's in production , it 's in the positive ( hopefully ) . 
  i think that depends on what kind of coop it is . 
  just like ica , coop has both huge markets and smaller ones . 
  but in no way would i place any of the coop below willys or city gross . 
  maybe halfway from 1 to 2, 
  * sveriges ridderskaps och adels kalender * ( aka adelskalendern ) presents every now and then all living nobles in sweden and it also hands out grants and pensions to nobles every year . 
  it 's not much , about 4.5 million euros . 
  so there are some * privilege * i 'm acquaintance with one noble woman and she has gotten some of the grants . 
  freud would like to have a word with you, 
  never heard of visent , always referred to bison ( swedish pronounciation ) . 
  maybe it 's regional ? 
  wow , we sound nothing like germans speaking english . 
  :o danish , swedes and norweigans sounds different as well . 
  no way , minnesotan/wisconsin/north dakota accent is super cool, 
  i think he knows how to annunciated . 
  i 'm sure i would 've a lot easier to understand danes if they did too . 
  and i grew up with two swedish tv channels and one danish, 
  when you say that it was like that in europe ? 
  so you mean that you gave actual experiences from other countries ? 
  because i can not at all relate to that and i was also a kid back then . 
  afrikaans sounds so cool, 
  tbh , i think the danish incomprehension is because of the danes . 
  i met an american in thailand and his danish was the easiest i 've ever had understanding danish . 
  and he even understood my swedish, 
  i fancy the heavy boston accent . 
  i try to go to bed at 21:30 ... 
  oh and do n't forget the * pelvis tilt * :p, 
  it almost sounds like you 're describing earths place in the universe . 
  you pay a maximum of 2200 sek per year ( around 220 $ ) for prescriptions medication . 
  it becomes cheaper and cheaper up until you paid the maximum . 
  inderal , 10 $ for 100 40mg but you need prescription to get inderal to begin with . 
  alprazolam 2mg , 100 pills for 40 $ is also prescription only, 
  no , everyone is * du * except royalty which is * ni * ( sie ) edit : explanation : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/du-reformen, 
  distinction of what ? 
  please read my edit on my original post, 
  is n't the word for bear also a name ? 
  misja or misio or something like that ? 
  how do you handle freezing degrees the times they actually do happen down there ? 
  dont ' worry about it , i was clumsy asking the question and was unlucky using my brain, 
  please read my edit in the original post, 
  there is only one famke for me ... rawr !, 
  wow , did not know that croatia also had jasmine as a male name thinking of michell which is also iirc a name in croatia that 's a male name . 
  when i was in umag in the 80 's the son in the homestay we lived in was named michell and i , 10 years old thought it was superstrange with a girlname on a boy, 
  where is this ? 
  i actually asked on / r/askreddit a while back when you stopped saying mommy/daddy and replaced it with mom and dad . 
  apparently it seemed to be a little regional as well where young adults still used mommy/daddy :d, 
  wha ' t a * holly * ? 
  how much of religion class is about non-christian teachings ? 
  sorry i meant names that is also a word used in common everyday language . 
  i think most languages have names that has * a meaning *, 
  ** everyone ** in sweden except royalty is addressed by their first name , even the highest boss and teachers . 
  mom/dad and grandparents are addressed as that . 
  oh that would not go over well here . 
  that teacher would be out of a job so fast, 
  our textbooks in religion is written like a wikipedia article , it 's objective in every sense of the word . 
  iirc you also need religion a ( first high school course ) to be eligible for university . 
  edit : why would there be praying in a religion class ? 
  for the record , you 're dead to me, 
  5-10 years ? 
  my friend waited 27 years for a one bedroom ( 2rok ) apartment on * s\u00f6der *, 
  so he never * experienced * an earthquake, 
  i just recently wanted to see what bollywood films are all about but since the dramaturgy is not what we 're used i need to find out a couple of films that ade easy to follow, 
  having religion as a subject does n't equal propaganda . 
  home *, 
  so ... do you ? 
  there is no way apple holds half the market in sweden .
