   although the most impressive one is 147m carls berg ? 
  wow . 
  i 'm flying out of dps on the 18th october . 
  highly recommend bali for cheap vacation . 
  where in sea are you flying to in october ? 
  it 's like 160m or something like that ? 
  wow . 
  thank you for that explanation . 
  so only if one of the words in the new compound word already has \u00df will it be used , otherwise not ? 
  like in fu\u00dfball ? 
  also , why is it capital letter when not used at the start of the word ? 
   but , the useage of the letter was heavily reduced during the spelling-reform in the 90 's ah that explains it . 
  i started 7th grade in 1990 . 
  do you have a simple example of when you can use the letter ? 
   we also have \u00f6 instead of \u00f8 , because we did n't want our language to resemble danish . 
  damn proud of you , nephew . 
  \u00df , i took one semester of third language before jumping ship to something else in 7th grade . 
  we learned this letter and what sound it represented . 
  but never got further than that . 
  is it just a conservative way of writing ss like swedish a hundred years had words v ( like german pronounciation ) or - fv prounced like f but has since been changed . 
  if new words enter german , will they ever be spelled with \u00df ? 
  wow . 
  i checked out \u00f5 and thought , wow that sounds just like \u00fc , then i clicked \u00fc and it was easily distinguishable . 
  then i clicked \u00f6 to see if you pronounce it the same way as us and it was almost the same as \u00fc . i 'm confused ... and i like it, 
  \u00fc is such a strange letter really because turks and germans use them and now apparently brazilians . 
  are these separate letters in the alphabet or just * variants * of existing letters like \u00e9 in english ? 
  i can totally see them . 
  ` a ' i suppose, 
  probably going to blow your mind , sports activity are n't connected to school . 
  school teams are n't a thing, 
  i think you 're wrong . 
  very very wrong, 
  wait , are you saying that americans has the same accent ? 
  can confirm , had girlfriend from nyk\u00f6ping and when i tried to mimic her dialect she looked at me and was chuffed that i could actually speak * real swedish * took a few moments before she realized what she actually said . 
  she still one of my best friends, 
  boobs have never been a problem on swedish tv imo . 
  but more violence yes . 
  full frontal probably more prevalent in the seventies but nudity ia more sexualized now than it was before . 
  stroganoff ? 
  i 'll argue that * fj\u00e4rran * is a little more poetic than * far * . 
  i would say * distant * or * remote * east, 
  even the notion of no dialect is silly . 
  everyone has a dialect , even what is * called * standard is a dialect . 
   most bars close at 3:00 entirely dependent on what kind of bar , what city , and so on . 
  anything from 1:00 to 5:00, 
  that 's the dude, 
  yes , my moms side has gone back to the late 1600 's . 
  especially one dude called [ puttetorpa here ] ( http://kjell.smult.com/liatorp/joh_images/joh_putte.jpg ) ( j\u00f6ns abrahamsson ram ) born 1791 is legendary . 
  a very strong man and according to legend after plowing a whole day in working he felt sorry for the oxens so he carried logs himself . 
  he was supposedly 220cm tall and 160kg . 
  there is a whole booklet on him and there is a painting of him hanging in carl von linn\u00e9s museum ( yes , that von linn\u00e9 ) also according to myth j\u00f6ns father was raped by a female troll and j\u00f6ns was the result ( do n't ask me how the troll handed over the kid ) . 
  another myth is that j\u00f6ns was a very meek kid and got a magical pretzel ( kringla ) to eat and that gave him his strength . 
  his father was supposedly a soldier in the war against russia 1788-1790 . 
  came home with so much loot he could buy a farm , jungfruboda . 
  i 'm sixth generation from him . 
  turkish delight ? 
  [ welcome to sweden ] ( http://m.imdb.com/title/tt3463606 ), 
  who drinks on a sunday ? 
  found the cowboy, 
  i recommend that you read up on this site . 
  http://prepaid-data-sim-card.wikia.com/wiki/prepaid_sim_with_data but beware that all the information may not be up to date since eu rules change this summer, 
  i made this post a while back that may interest you what does curses and curse words in your language revolve around ? 
  true dat, 
  having two last names has also become very popular here , where someone wants to keep its last name when marrying for instance . 
  legally you still only have one last name and your maiden name becomes a * middle name * . 
  that alright i guess but i think it becomes silly when children also gets two * last names * . 
  what happens when they marry ? 
  speaking of that , van der something , us that considered three last names or just one ? 
  and what would happen when you move to france for instance and have to have your middle name as last name ? 
  my first name as well as all my middle names ( 3 ) and my last name is present on my passport . 
  however , i think sweden does n't distinguish between names that are n't last names . 
  iirc they are all * first names * one is considered your * called name *, 
  a female friend that went to estonia is often told me that the bars in estonia is where women pick up guys and not the other way around like in most other european places, 
  warms my heart to hear you say that . 
  yep , done by people who do n't know any better . 
  they think the symbol : - means kronor when it really means no fractions, 
  for people more interested in mcmansions i can recommend this short podcast episode from 99 % invisible http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/mcmansion-hell-devil-details/, 
  you 're wrong about one thing though . 
  if there are fractions of a krona in the price there is no : - that symbol represent that there is no fractions . 
  so 9,95 : - is wrong . 
  not that common anymore since inflation but if there was fractions and no whole krona you write -:95 ( 0.95 ), 
  maybe it is but decadent should n't he guilty by association, 
  it does n't mean any war , it 's like an eponym for the time specifically for the time after second world war just like the time between the two world wars is called * interwar period *, 
  why not both ... at the same time, 
  wait what , so generalization that you 're the coolest is ok but doing it with you 're being terrible is not ? 
  you are just confirming my view of usanians, 
  i think you 're mixing up east rome and west rome . 
  i might be wrong on the years but rome had a bunch of * contact * with germans and i 'm not sure right but iirc germans sacked west rome at some point in the last hundred years . 
  do you remember what happened to west rome around year 476 ? 
  tbh i 'm more concerned with the polarization . 
  citizens fight citizens . 
  the era of moderation is over . 
  oh you mean like 2 times in the 5 last elections ? 
  thats a 40 % in the last twenty years . 
  ca n'tj just spread it out to get better numbers . 
  it just shows that 200 years ago the electoral system worked but not anymore because of an extreme population skew and other factors too, 
  i have zero problems doing that when i 'm abroad . 
  last time i went i went by myself , i have never spoken with so many strangers in such a short amount of time . 
  loved it . 
  had to stop smiling towards strangers when i go home though,
