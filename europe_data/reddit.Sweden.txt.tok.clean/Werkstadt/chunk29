  do you think your government would be willing to negotiate a release of [ bouvet\u00f8ya ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tqpjx21.png ) ? 
   estonia - they think they 're better than everyone else well , are they ? 
  a danish person is called * dansk * in swedish . 
  that 's ... that 's a quarter around the globe . 
  dude , i 've had several relationships during these last fifteen years and seychelles have never even come up . 
  i travel a lot , i know what expectations are , i 'm in no hurry because i have other places to visit first . 
  just the other day i made a post of how i love this sub and all the people in it because they 're moderate and humble to each other and then you come along with this judgemental pseudopsycho babble . 
  you do not know me . 
  swedes are definitely the most humble at least / s, 
  this pisses me off to no end . 
  my time is my time , i do n't live to work , i work to live . 
  nord-norege , same thing in [ sweden ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/sverigekarta-landsdelar_norrland.svg/450px-sverigekarta-landsdelar_norrland.svg.png ) being like the 3/5 top of the country, 
  [ mrw ] ( http://img.pandawhale.com/113640-i-have-a-really-bad-feeling-ab-s9sz.gif ), 
  i do n't read newspapers ( or e-newspapers ) , i do n't watch tv or listen to radio . 
  i used to but when i stopped my quality of life got so much better . 
  the seychelles have been my dream destination for fifteen years but it 's really not somewhere i 'd go on my own or with a friends , it 's more of a * romantic * destination . 
  japan and australia is both on my bucket list and other places i want to go is backpacking through laos , cambodia , vietnam , philippines . 
  i love south east asia , bali , thailand , singapore are all fantastic . 
  my top recommendation i always hare is bali . 
  that is absolutely adorable, 
  what part of norway is considered * east norway * ? 
  is it the part close to finland ? 
  ( do n't you dare answer * sweden * ), 
  frick on stick that 's some finnish lengthening of words right there, 
  i 've come across many anglospherian citizens who works in sweden . 
  just now this week it was an australian guy at a marketing firm in gothenburg . 
  there are jobs , especially in the engineering field but i 'm sure that the countries that are very proficient in english as a second language ( netherlands , denmark , finland , sweden ) it 's not seen as a hindrance and maybe even a merit since your input as a native english speaker can help . 
  countries where english is n't * as * good might not be interested, 
  absolutely golden , especially the first mod repsonse !, 
  educate [ yourself ] ( https://youtu.be/bgotrmkrjo4 ), 
  numbers from 2012 say that 11 % of swedes smoke and 10,5 % snus . 
  anja < 3, 
  too kind a name in english if you ask me . 
  in swedish it 's something like hag-haul, 
  ** ice hockey ** obviously finland ** cross country skiing ** norway ** beer drinking ** danes, 
  that 's like * that * friend you had growing up playing boardgames but because it was his boardgame he could change the rules of it to suit him or everybody could go home . 
  yeah we all know * that * friend, 
  love that sibling bantery :d, 
  they 're in german . 
  please summarize them for the rest of us . 
  relevant username, 
  a week ago i booked a flight to bali . 
  sabaton is one of the two bands i would care enough to see live . 
  they 're on tour now.doing two weeks in sweden . 
  exactly the dates i 'm going to south east asia . 
  fml, 
  sounds like a title to grey boring romantic drama, 
  * only 32 % * . 
  sounds awfully high to me . 
  it must be highly subjective . 
  i can assume it feels like all french smoke when it 's three times as high as here . 
  i just meant that you found it excessive with that many spreads to choose from but having so much cheese to pick from is n't excessive . 
  growing up in malm\u00f6 , sk\u00e5ne i did n't meet anyone that did n't hate on stockholm until late in my teens . 
  it was just the default . 
  in sweden the road is sm\u00f6rg\u00e5s which translates to butter-goose . 
  we mostly eat open faced * sm\u00f6rg\u00e5s * like [ this ] ( http://www.bildshop.nu/productimages/vm-grov-sm\u00f6rg\u00e5s-m-ost-dsc00.jpg ) is a typical breakfast * sm\u00f6rg\u00e5s *, 
  here in sweden these kinds of markets easily have meters upon metres of different kinds of cheese . 
  i can imagine it being the same way in nl ? 
  same user that posted [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/5yljux/do_you_think_germans_are_sincere_in_their/ ) so i guess op has something against germans, 
  they hide it when they all sing at the same time but as soon as they sing one at a time it 's like claws on a chalkboard . 
  i 'm more surprised that they were the one winning the macedonian competition, 
  maybe you can shed some light on this , i 've heard that danes have it easier understanding rikssvenska than sk\u00e5nska . 
  i 'm from sk\u00e5ne ( and even worked in k\u00f6benhavn at times ) and i rarely understand danish, 
  oh i did n't mean that she was made up , i just made a point that the numbering did n't seem to really be important enough to be correct . 
  and apparently a few made up ones, 
   ( actually she should be margrethe i , because the real margrethe i was n't queen ) what the ... 
  i had to read up on regal numbering and came across this * sometimes legendary or fictional persons are included . 
  for example , the swedish kings eric xiv ( reigned 1560 -- 68 ) and charles ix ( 1604 -- 11 ) took ordinals based on a fanciful 1544 history by johannes magnus , which invented six kings of each name before those accepted by later historians . 
  * i guess it 's not that important then , let 's just hurrdurr something, 
   we had a german king . 
  i did n't know that . 
  that 's fascinating . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_finland_ ( 1918 ), 
  i know that a lot of swedes want to give back sk\u00e5ne to denmark if that counts . 
  at least they 'll be an invasion deterrent . 
  wo n't be blitzing with those hogging all the roads, 
  thank you for this !, 
  i still remember [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/dwlrcgh-1nu ), 
  wait what !, 
  did you switch design on currency with only 12 years apart ? 
  i apparently got the spelling wrong , it 's solstollarna . 
  it was a little bit weird looking back at it because international stars like samantha fox and mandy smith were both guests on the show . 
  the name of the show was ~ ~ solst\u00e5llarna ~ ~ solstollarna . 
  the and it 's the blonde mermaid that is the one exposed, 
  it was n't a big thing . 
  there was even slight nudity in children 's show in the 80s . 
  l\u00e5t den r\u00e4tte komma in ( eng title : let the right one in ) set in a suburb in the 1980s about a boy and girl . 
  amazing photography s\u00e4llskapsresan ( eng title : the charter trip ) swedish classic about a couple of swedes going to malorca on a charter trip . 
  yes !, 
  i remember seeing this in the 80s when public tv showed it . 
  i was only eight or nine at the time but the end really messed me up . 
  paranoia grew in me . 
  saw it again about ten years ago , now i noticed there was a lot of nudity , did n't really acknowledge that first time around, 
  funny , i would n't bat an eye if cousins were married but i 'm thinking the view on this might be because how close you are to your cousins growing up . 
  my cousins lived 400km away and only met them twice a year . 
  we were all the same age though, 
  student ? 
  gothenburg city net , bahnhof service provider 25 $ for 100/100mbit fiber all the way into my apartment . 
  i get that speed and during the four years i lived here it has only gone down once and it was because of a faulty fan in the station . 
  45000 customers went down for an hour or so .
