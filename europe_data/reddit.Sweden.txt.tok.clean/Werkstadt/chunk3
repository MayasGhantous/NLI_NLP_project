  sk\u00e5ne does n't have its own flag . 
  the yellow cross with red background flag is representative for the former danish provinces of sk\u00e5ne , blekinge and halland, 
  google for kalmarunion, 
  i would n't be surprised that spanking is contained in that anti-porn law that went into effect a few years ago, 
  i 've seen [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/seo916c.jpg ) map a couple of times now and i always wonder , what country and why does denmark have one less than finland and sweden ? 
  please name your country in your reply . 
  i 'm assembling some data , 
  this is for the german redditors that might be able to answer this . 
  there are of course countless events for every country and my submissions is just one among many . 
  sweden proclaimed a neutral nation had it 's own fatal encounter in 1952 . 
   the catalina affair ( swedish : catalinaaff\u00e4ren ) was a military confrontation and cold war-era diplomatic crisis in june 1952 , in which soviet air force fighter jets shot down two swedish aircraft over international waters in the baltic sea . 
  the first aircraft to be shot down was an unarmed swedish air force tp 79 , a derivative of the douglas dc-3 , carrying out radio and radar signals intelligence-gathering for the national defence radio establishment . 
  none of the crew of eight was rescued . 
   the second aircraft to be shot down was a swedish air force tp 47 , a catalina flying boat , involved in the search and rescue operation for the missing dc-3 . 
  the catalina 's crew of five were saved . 
  the soviet union publicly denied involvement until its dissolution in 1991 . 
  both aircraft were located in 2003 , and the dc-3 was salvaged . 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalina_affair ) ** edit ** wow , thanks , this is already way above my expectations . 
  i 've learned a lot about unknown but not so trivial things in fellow europeans histories . 
  ** edit 2 ** i am so happy that there are people still submitting events . 
  events that i never heard . 
  keep it going,

  from another thread -- first time i fired a gun was almost ten , it was the swedish variant of the h&k g4 , the ak4 . 
  it was on a military range when the military showed the public what they do . 
  my 9 year ~ ~ old ~ ~ older brother was doing his mandatory military service which is why we were present . 
  the second time was a magnum .44 and a magnum .357 which were black powder manually loaded . 
  i think i was 13 or 14 at the time . 
  my brothers girlfriends father was the owner of the guns . 
  after that i 've shot shotguns at skeet shooting at my friends farm . 
  we 've done that a couple of times as a social thing . 
  same friend i 've shot .22 caliber pistol for range shooting . 
  we 've disposed of hard drives the right way , by shooting them to pieces so that no data can be extracted from discarded drives . 
  we also shot 9mm , shotguns and a hunting rifle ( unsure of caliber ) . 
  i do n't have a real interest in shooting but it 's more of the availability and the novelty of doing it . 
  i have however thought about starting to shoot the bow , the range is just a kilometer away and it 's possible that i will be able to use the skill in my line of work, 
  also chernobyl so there 's that, 
  [ airwalks ] ( http://i.imgur.com/avipzl2.jpg ) if i can help it , yeah i 'm stuck in the nineties but they get increasingly harder and harder to get a hold of . 
  these particular ( bought in baton rouge in 1997 ) pair are twenty years old and just started leaking through the soles when it 's wet outside :(, 
  intuitively it just feels weird that they cherish the dude that essentially lost the swedish empire iirc . 
  depends if you mean illegally or not . 
  illegally i suppose , legally next to impossible . 
  why not ? 
  but spaniards would also switch country with someone . 
  you would n't know who you 're new neighbours would be, 
  what about spain ? 
  best coast !, 
  swedens front side, 
  i can see it , ass soon as a dutch is idle they 'll walk down to the sea and start poldering until player one orders them up to a new task, 
  sorry , i meant another european country . 
  when i rewrote the question over and over the second * european * fell out, 
  switched for ? 
   large enough not to be densely populated lebensraum ? 
  czechiacentric , the rest of europe revolves around czechia, 
  mortdogga ? 
  sweden was the first country in the world to ban corporal punishment on kids . 
  never again . 
  mangosteen is the best . 
  thai without a doubt, 
  i did n't really get that . 
  say it one more time, 
  ca n't beat felix ... it would be child abuse, 
  tbh , i think * v\u00e4sttrafik * is doing an awesome job , the only thing you hear about them is complaints . 
  the only complaint i have is the italian trams the politicians bought that are horrendous is so many ways . 
  mostly it boils down to not being able to handle the climate which is n't much of a surprise really . 
  even with the controversies the politicians decided to buy another batch ( absolutely moronic ) apart from that all of it is 50 % funded by taxes ( unknown to most ) it works great , expensive even with the taxfunding ( one way ticket in gothenburg is $ 2.7 ( 90 minutes ) -- * the city of gothenburg in sweden has ordered 40 one-directional sirio trams which were to be put into service on the gothenburg tram network during 2005 and onwards . 
  the trams were delivered late and functioned poorly when put into traffic . 
  among reported problems were excessive track damage caused by the trams , malfunctioning airconditioners inside the trams and poor ride quality . 
  the city of gothenburg therefore withheld a large part of the payment for a delivered tram until fully operational . 
  [ 81 ] on december 3 , 2009 , the city authorities exercised their option for a further 25 trams of the same design at a cost of $ 61m . 
  * * in february 2013 , 38 out of the total 40 trams delivered in the first series were taken out of service due to extensive corrosion on the chassis . 
  reparing the rusted chassis and moldy passenger floors is expected to be completed by 2017 , at a cost for gothenburg council of an extra $ 10m according to the revised contract , although ansaldobreda bears the majority of the cost for these deficiencies . 
  [ citation needed ] of the 65 trams purchased , only about 35-40 are usable . 
  [ 44 ] due to further delays on the part of ansaldobreda with the corrosion repairs and substandard quality in completed works , the council of gothenburg cancelled the contract for corrosion repairs in november 2015 . 
  [ 44 ] none of the three repaired trams that ansaldobreda delivered was in working order and might actually be scrapped . 
  the investigation launched into the matter found that the trams were jerry-built and that ansaldobreda did not have the will , nor the competence to do anything about the problems . 
  it was also discovered that the badly built trams have resulted in extensive track damage that will be very costly to repair , adding to the `` fiasco '' of the gothenburg ansaldobreda tram affaire . 
  * * after the problems had been publicised in swedish media , ansaldobreda chairman antonio liguori sent a letter to gothenburg municipality which contained threats of concerted actions with other companies against the municipality , along with demands of 10 million euro . 
  alright . 
  when phone mobility was new in america there were n't really national carriers . 
  it was small independent companies use working in certain areas . 
  they built up their own networks of network masts . 
  so your phone only worked in that specific area ( cells ) . 
  no roaming on other networks . 
  the name * cell phone * just carried on ev en if the tech changed to what we have today . 
  after googling a bit it seems that instead of a new name they changed the definition of what cell phone means becuase in could n't find anything about the old ways . 
  today it apparently means that a network of cells ( masts ) just overlap and every area that a single mast provides service for means a cell or the explanation is got twenty years ago is made up, 
  well , do we have gum in sweden ? 
  tbf , technically cell phones are are only usable in a very confined area . 
  like a municipal or something like that , hence the name * cell * phone . 
  mobile phone and cell phone are n't the same , * technically * but i 'm sure the idiot meant mobile phone, 
  i 'll take it !, 
   is n't it about getting you from a to b ? 
  if it was i would n't ask . 
  there are many variables that i care about and take into consideration . 
  for short flights of a few hours less so but when you 're spending 12h on a flight they become more and more important . 
  like is the do you pay for entertainment , some companies do and not only budget airlines . 
  are drinks complimentary . 
  will staff go out of their way to accommodate you or will they just do enough . 
  some variable come down to pure stats which i can figure out on my own .
