   with the whole continent effectively being a large nation of states similar to the us in some ways you mean like about * half * and not * whole * right ? 
  and no thanks , i do not want to become a nation or a federation , i do n't see the point in federalizing . 
  around 21 % excluding electrics and parking spot . 
  fairly central gothenburg ( 10 minutes by bus from absolute city center ), 
  no i would n't , i prefer it that people ca n't get alcohol on a whim . 
  even if it sometimes is an inconvenience for me, 
  open til 18-19 on a weekday and 14-15 on a saturday , closed on sundays . 
  i prefer it to stay like this . 
  * systembolaget ( swedish : [ s\u028f\u02c8ste\u02d0mbu\u02d0l\u0251\u02d0\u0261\u025bt ] ( listen ) , `` the system company '' ) , colloquially known as systemet ( `` the system '' ) or bolaget ( `` the company '' ) , is a government-owned chain of liquor stores in sweden . 
  it is the only retail store allowed to sell alcoholic beverages that contain more than 3.5 % alcohol by volume . 
  systembolaget also sells non-alcoholic beverages , although this product segment represents less than half a percent of the total sales of beverages . 
  [ 2 ] to buy alcoholic beverages at systembolaget one has to be 20 years of age or older . 
  [ 3 ] at swedish restaurants and bars the legal age to buy alcoholic beverages is 18 years ( though bars and clubs may voluntarily set an age limit higher than 18 if they prefer ) .

  citroen = sitt-\u00e5-tr\u00e4ng ( sit and cramp ), 
  and it 's very socially acceptable . 
  it 's only when you see someone doing it unsafe that i ever seen anyone react to it . 
  like sjuk , stj\u00e4rna , skjuta , skuta , nobody will know the slight difference between sj , skj , stj and sk, 
  that 's because it sounds so damn cute, 
  it 's looked down upon to the point where some smokers feel like there are hunted down as places where they can smoke her shrunken down . 
  i myself is super intolerant towards smoking . 
  iirc only 12 % are smokers here . 
  i have no friends that smoke and i ca n't even recall when i was in someone 's home or in a place wee smoking was ok, 
  elementary school grade 1-9 used these periods for all my nine years . 
  of course we did n't have 8 ( \u00e1 40 minutes ) periods per day in every grade . 
  first grade was just 4 periods 8:20 -9:00 9:05 -9:45 10:00 -10:45 10:50 -11:30 lunch 12:20 -13:00 13:10 -13:50 14:00 -14:40 14:50 -15:30,

  keys on a table without a buffer like a magazine or so is suppose to be bad . 
  as long as you can hear the table to key sound the buffer is n't thick enough, 
  do n't forget about fv ( farlig v\u00e4nskap = dangerous friendship ) lids, 
  tbh , i do n't want this sub to grow . 
  it 's perfect as it is now . 
  not too many posts that just get drowned in the sheer numbers of questions like in / r/askreddit . 
  if you ask a question in askreddit in daytime us it 's unlikely youll even get a reply because the new posts disappears to the second page in minutes, 
  d\u00f6 ` boll ( deathball ) - played with a tennis ball and a group of individuals . 
  the game usually starts with everyone gathered in a huddle and one person slams the ball into the ground and everyone but the most brave scatters . 
  when someone catches the ball everyone has to stand still and the person with the ball tries to hit another person with it . 
  if successfully that person is out . 
  the next person to pick up the ball does the same thing , it 's a free for all . 
  but if the person that took you out is taken out then you 're in again , kind of a infinite game . 
  optional rules was that you were allowed to defend yourself by blocking the ball with your fists and/or that if you caught the ball without it hitting the ground the person throwing it was out . 
  pj\u00e4tt / kull/tage ( and a bunch of regional names for essentially the game of tag ) is the standard when one person hunts down and tags the next person who is then the hunter . 
  usually you have some kind of amnesty that you ca n't be tagged by the person you just tagged until you 've taken 3 steps . 
  he means aquaculture and agriculture . 
  apparently in germanic languages we can write aqua - and agriculture and mean the same thing, 
  complete and utter bs . 
  racism is defined that your have a perceived view of a * race * . 
  do n't forget about the radicals in the north in the mid nineties . 
  lots of emotions, 
  i do n't usually look at usernames, 
   limit your decibel levels this , most of the times i hear a loud tourist either at home or when i myself is on vacation it 's americans that is heard above everyone else . 
  this is n't saying that all american tourists are loud ( i know they are n't ) but most loud tourists are americans, 
  we have a translation for schadenfreude , skadegl\u00e4dje, 
  oh he just asked how many different ways of talking about the weather we have, 
  different times when doing the right thing was they 're calling, 
  like when you plan to buy a car you take into account what 's it going to cost you in maintenance after you bought it as well ... veterans , not so much . 
  it 's disgusting, 
  how many syllables are that in finnish ? 
   `` hej det \u00e4r ... '' funny , that 's what i start when i 'm the one making a phonecall and i do n't know the person answering, 
  i 've stopped answering with my name when i do n't know who 's calling , then i just answer * hall\u00e5 * . 
  sellers/surveys always ask if it 's * werkstadt * they 're speaking to and i reply with * what 's it about * if they tell me they want to sell/survey something , i 'll tell them that * werkstadt * does n't have this number any longer . 
  that usually gets them to take you off their list because it 's a * faulty number * while if you just say that you 're not interested , 6 months later they call again . 
  if it 's a known number i either answer with * werkstadt * or * hall\u00e5 *, 
  i also believe that that is the effect of greater internet speeds essentially . 
  people can now binge watch what they had to wait a week for , people just did n't have the * attention span * to really care as much as they do today . 
  watching a whole season in less than a week kept your * what 's going on * . 
  movie stars turning to tv was a result of that imo, 
  it would n't matter for me , i 'm not there to tick off stuff on a list . 
  it 's about a quality not quantity and rushing through anything is not quality, 
  thought the cities here were decent but that 's just the cause the cities down on the continent are so filthy . 
  until i visited singapore . 
  now i think our cities are super filthy, 
  no thanks . 
  it does not have to be that way , i 'm not doing that when i fly half away around the world . 
  that 's exactly how i feel about most users that come to / r/askrurope about their itinerary . 
  it 's mind-boggling how they just rush though their ** vacation ** just like cattle in a pre-trampled path . 
  i 'm into traveling but at most i do one or two day trips and then take one day of just chilling and lounging, 
  you make it sound like it 's hard to understand deqchother because of variations ( which i think op was asking about ) and i do n't think any swede has trouble understanding any swedish dialect, 
  mine , 
  hit us up with some golden belgian meme waffles, 
  was he a joker or a troll ? 
  i feel pretty confident you already know about / r/sweden, 
  or the german version of loki was so sneaky he was n't even known, 
  what i think op is thinking is that * manned space flight * is what defines how serious you are . 
  i feel left out, 
  get a load if this guy . 
  sucking up to our overlords making the rest of look bad, 
  can confirm , do n't see us as part of the continent but definitely european , nordic and scandinavian, 
  ford , both times , because i enjoy electrical problems . 
  the republican * association * is a small organisation that only ever is heard about when there is a public discussion of the royal establishments spending . 
  latest survey ( apr 2016 ) had a majority of 65 % wanting to keep the republic , not surprisingly greatest support among women over 65 years of age . 
  24 % want to abolish it, 
  excellent film . 
  watched that when i was a kid in the eighties . 
  maybe their humour is n't excellent but i was thoroughly entertained when polish workers were renovating a camp ground we did some electrical work for and our car would n't start . 
  i asked one of the poles if he could jump start our car by pulling it with his pickup . 
  within 2 minutes all six poles were staring down at the motor apparently discussing something in polish and gesticulating . 
  so let 's just agree that * swedish fika * is tastier . 
  they just work different depending on where you are . 
  that 's the thing with surveys though .
