  i 'm inherently against answering surveys because of their single faceted questions . 
  9/10 questions i want to counter ask * what ifs * so i usually refuse to answer . 
   it 's descended from the same word anyway . 
  both stadt ( city ) and statt ( place , so werkstatt literally means `` work place '' ) are descended from the same old german word `` stat '' ( city , place ) . 
      they 're also pronounced the exact same way and it was n't until the renaissance that they started to be spelt differently . 
  this i did n't know though . 
   i do n't know german but i listen to a lot of music that is in german . 
  the swedish word for city is stad ( verk-stad ) german word for city is stadt it 's just a play on words with an intentional mistranslation, 
  it absolutely does , it 's intentionally wrong . 
  the swedish word for workshop is verkstad , but i 'm pretty sure werkstadt is not the german word for workshop :d, 
  that i do n't know german but i have n't let that stop me . 
  it comes down to it being * your * life . 
  if you want to end it it 's ** nobody 's ** business . 
  there is literally no argument that will change my view of this . 
  as a guy who does n't find large breast and buxom butts attractive i 'm happy there are the narrow hips and itty bitty titties , 
  [ my reaction when ] ( http://i.imgur.com/eirghup.gif ), 
  songs sung in swedish are a little easier because there is n't really that much to choose from . 
  [ kent - k\u00e4rleken v\u00e4ntar ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sad68golzea ) ( love waits ) [ sabaton - carolus rex ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zgkysbtuiw ) swedish artist in english so much harder to choose from because there 's so much of it .

  in sweden it 's common to say * smurf *, 
  just as having the right to vote is a democratic freedom so must also the right to not vote be equally right . 
  * let me in * was n't really that bad , one of the better remakes imo but * l\u00e5t den r\u00e4tte komma in * is my favourite swedish film . 
  swedish film production have a bunch of flaws ( script , acting , directing , photo ) . 
  although . 
  there 's a reason the market is [ stagnant ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vqeeabt.jpg ) . 
  i do n't watch films anywhere near as much as i used to do . 
  originality is gone , it 's just one blurb of pg-13 predictable dramaturgy . 
  films today over explain the plot so that even the dumbest of audience understands it . 
  it 's insulting . 
  if i watch a film now days i refuse to see trailers , read more than a single sentence about the plot because half of the entertainment is figuring out what the film is about to keep me engaged . 
  it 's also a matter of market . 
  swedish films have usually just a potential to reach a few million people while american films are in the billion . 
  like hollywood does a lot of remakes of non american films . 
  the originals are usually better than the american version so those films are good , which is also why americans want to make a remake of them . 
  younger generations are getting taller because of healthier environment like food and health care etc, 
  i 'm not very interested in sports but american football league is the only sport i follow . 
  ca n't care for ordinary football or any other league sport . 
   if you are a celebrity , polish media will find your polish ancestor from 200 years ago . 
  this made me exhale a little quicker than anticipated . 
  swedes be just sittin ' here , drinkin , watching this play out, 
  i do n't think that exclusively it has to do with guns but i think the craziness level hits ludicrous because of it . 
  but then there are a bunch of other societal reasons that differs . 
  poverty and mental health care for instance . 
  i look at it strictly geographically . 
  the part of russia that is in europe is european and the other part is asian . 
  same thing with turkey . 
  they 're mostly asian . 
  only a sliver is european . 
  uhm , no . 
  2002-2014 a total of 13 people were shot dead by police . 
  we do n't have that kind of escalation as in the us because people do n't carry guns .

  poop does n't move ... unless put in a canon ... which does n't seem like a bad idea atm, 
  what rock is he under . 
  inquiring minds need to know, 
  i 'm almost forty and my mom has ** never ** asked me when i will get married or have a kid . 
  maybe she does n't love me . 
  reminds me of konspiration 58 ( conspiracy 58 )  conspiracy 58 ( swedish : konspiration 58 or ksp58 ) is a swedish mockumentary from 2002 , produced by sveriges television , the swedish public broadcaster . 
  the plot of the film is that the 1958 fifa world cup in sweden did n't really take place , but was faked and exists only as forged television and radio coverage in a conspiracy between american and swedish television , the cia and fifa as part of the cold war . 
  in the film it is said that sweden did not have the economic or technical resources to actually host such a large event . 
  in the plot , the american motive for doing this was to test the effectiveness of televised propaganda . 
  when the film originally aired , the audience was not told in advance that it was a mockumentary , giving the impression that conspiracy 58 was a regular documentary film . 
  1962 , good times . 
  because it only tells the woman about what 's * bad * with an abortion and not what 's * good * with it . 
   abortion is not an easy medical procedure wrong . 
  they can be very easy  psychological reactions are also not uncommon . 
  most often are they because of what the public * thinks * about abortion , so it 's a societal pressure that makes the woman * feel bad *  these laws should provide that a young woman does not get pressured into an abortion and that she is really sure about it . 
  these laws are put in place to make the woman * feel bad * about her decision . 
  if it was handled as any other comparable difficult medical procedure it would be in and out as getting a vaccination . 
  wow . 
  did not know that germany was this much anti abortion . 
  it is so normalized only the most religious parliament members even say anything about it . 
  it 's a dead cause that only ever happens when somebody needs to make a statement because of his or her voters . 
  last couple of weeks there has been discussion about an american anti-abortion supported ( allegedly ) swedish maternity nurse that is going through the judiciary system to get a right to work without having to perform abortions even if it 's in her job description . 
  she 's going to lose but since she 's backed by american interest she has stated that she 's going all the way to european court if needs be . 
  oh is that so ? 
  i 'd love to listen to some butt hurt people complaining . 
  do you have yt clip ? 
  riding e6 on the west coast i see norwegian plated tesla all the time, 
  the s90 tail looks extremely american imo . 
  no we do n't need polarization to counter something far from the middle . 
  it will just divide people . 
  there is a reason why it 's called the far left/right because it 's far from the average/moderate man who is * pretty * content and do n't make much fuss . 
  it will always be the people that is the least content that will make the loudest noise . 
   the automoderator is set up to notify me of any comments with a lot of swear words . 
  this thread is making it shit the bed just for the record , i take pride in that, 
  german scheisse is not uncommon to hear in sweden, 
  what , not sheep shaggers ? 
   there is a lot of gray area around it . 
  undiscovered territory ? 
  i 'm not sure about other people but to me bitch is only about a female with an attitude , not anything to do with sex ( or ofc female dog ), 
   poperkunais ( to the thundering one ) , thor ? 
   kurva - bitch is n't kurva whore/prostitute and not female dog ? 
  i always thought puta was whore/prostitute not female dog, 
  sounds very painful, 
   voi vittujen kev\u00e4t = the spring of cunts do you mean spring like a coil or the season ? 
  in combination ? 
   i like to be more creative with my swearing and call properly things like massive clit or a cunt fucker . 
  in this regard i recommend the film bitch slap ( in any other regard i ca n't recommend it ), 
  wait , what ?
