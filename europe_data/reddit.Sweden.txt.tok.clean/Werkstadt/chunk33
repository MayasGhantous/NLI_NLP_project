  it 's cheaper for us ? 
  i ca n't think of any one of the referendum we 've had that was n't more or less two opposites ( yes we 've had three options but they are essentially just a variation of two ) iirc we 've had 6 national referendums the past hundred years . 
  1/3 of them the government ignored the result and went ahead anyway . 
  ( switch to right hand traffic in 1967 and abolishment of nuclear power in 1980 which still has n't been * implemented * . 
  the yes side boosted by the then recent accident in harrisburg ) the other four was a ban on alcohol 1922 , pension fit everyone 1957 , joining the eu 1994 and joining the euro 2003, 
  it 's true , norwegian and iirc a few other countries at times . 
  although it 's important that certain products are n't included in the trash where as little as 35kg could halt the boiler for 50000 euro repairs . 
  ( i do n't want to divulge exactly what material because of sabotage risk ), 
  european , absolutely . 
  kinship , definitely , but not as much inside europe as outside . 
  mostly feel nordic , but possibly because we only border nordic countries while the other three borders non-nordic countries, 
  i think both swedes and norwegians have the same feeling as the uk in this regard , not being part of the * continent * . 
  when referring to mainland europe i often say * down on the continent *, 
  there 's dozen of us who are n't pro federalism . 
  i ca n't for the life of me see the point of it . 
  it 's very safe . 
  in 2014 34 people died while riding a bike . 
  in that year there was 440 million bike trips totalt . 
  i do n't know about the rural areas but in general , people bike a lot . 
  especially in the cities where there are a lot of bike paths . 
  nothing go in a landfill . 
  about one percent go into * deposit * . 
  glass , paper , metall , batteries go into recycle bins . 
  household garbage are burned for electricity and distribution heating . 
  all hazardous particles are taken care off . 
  only gas except vapor is co2 . 
  the exhaust is so devoid of heat that big fans need to blow it out of the chimney . 
  edit : oh and some municipalities have compost as well , usually to make bio gas iirc,

  fika is n't really on * what * you 're having it but more like * how * you 're having it . 
  google it . 
  or better , youtube it, 
  * we swedes are much better at being humble than the dutch *, 
  [ affirmative ] ( http://ooquotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/9-alice-in-wonderland-quotes-2010.gif ), 
  had a fika with a female friend yesterday and she told me she 's on edge at times . 
  i 'm . a guy and i 'm scared ever since i was almost robbed 4 years ago . 
  i 'm here to down vote this if you get too many up votes . 
  i 'm doing my part, 
  frick on a stick , til . 
  thought poland was just one flat land . 
  never heard of such a thing, 
  as long as they 're covered up, 
  dill chips , best taste ever . 
  salted , just salted . 
  taste like nothing . 
  stop making vickningschips !, 
  even the name does n't make sense . 
  wait what , poland has mountains ? 
  i prefer larger dogs too , something like a pyrenese or a leonberger . 
  but i 'm looking at corgis since there are no known breed defects . 
  ( danish-swedish farmdog ) aka sk\u00e5nsk terrier, 
  thanks , i was sitting on the bus pulling v\u00e4lf\u00e4rd out of my rump . 
  freshmen , sophomore , junior senior are the 4 different years in 4 + year schools like high school, 
  you pay a fee in the reception 10 euro for an ordinary appointment and 30 euro for specialist . 
  if at any time during a 12 month period you exceed over 120 euro you will get a free card that covers the last twelve month of the period . 
  if you stay over night ( lodging ) you pay 8 euro per night stayed on an invoice sent to you at a later time . 
  medication you get greater and greater discount until reaching iirc 360 euro which after medication is completely free for the 12 month period what constitutes a 12 month period us a lil bit complicated but it 's not calendar year edit : dental is not covered by this but dental i do n't completely free for any one under 18 . 
  as a young adult some municipal does cover dental beyond that but not past 25, 
  the problem as such is that hockey are n't big in many europeans countries . 
  except for the fluke once in a while there is essentially only five national teams that can win the world cup , canada , russia , czheck , finland and sweden . 
  but last decade many of the secondary tier teams have gotten much better . 
  so two swedish teams and no norwegian is n't far fetched, 
   each 24 hour period lengthens the daylight with 5 minuets . 
  that depends on what time of year it is . 
  closer to midwinter and midsummer it 's closer to one minute and and at autumn and spring solstice is when it changes more rapidly . 
  this of the winter half of the year as throwing a ball up in the air . 
  when the ball leaves your hand and when you catch its going the fastest ( autumn and spring solstice ) and as the ball reaches the top its its going slower and slower slowing down to no velocity . 
  that 's midwinter , then going back down it accelerates to reach maximum speed before being caught, 
  who barfed ? 
  that colour on the liquid though , just barely transparent ... * shudders *, 
  if you had put that question into google you would 've gotten an [ answer ] ( https://i.imgur.com/jnyi24e.png ) right in the google search field without even clicking a link < / thread , 
  how is australias population relevant ? 
  are you confusing music market with music exporter ? 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/20130930/50518 ) my source, 
  mine was also from wikipedia , different article though, 
  i i learned the other day that a nation and a country is n't really the same thing . 
  i was surprised but a nation can exist inside a country so i 'm thinking that his nationality was croat but his citizenship was austrian-hungarian  a nation ( from latin : natio , `` people , tribe , kin , genus , class , flock '' ) is a large group or collective of people with common characteristics attributed to them -- including language , traditions , mores ( customs ) , habitus ( habits ) , and ethnicity . 
  by comparison , a nation is more impersonal , abstract , and overtly political than an ethnic group . 
  it is a cultural-political community that has become conscious of its autonomy , unity , and particular interests . 
  [ 1 ] edit : in usa you have * indian nations * iirc, 
  italo disco perfected the deep lyrics, 
  which is a little bit funny since french only pronounce half the letters in their words :d, 
  \u00fc is something in between swedish y and u if you click the little speaker symbol down in the right corner [ here ] ( https://translate.google.com/#sv/hu/kyss ) you can hear what it sounds like, 
  funny , tegel means brick ( used for house walls ) in swedish, 
  and it very much sounds like swedish * kyss * ( soft k ) which means kiss ( hard k ) so i always thought tsch\u00fcs meant kiss, 
  sweden is the largest non-english native music exporter in the world ( third overall after usa and uk ) so we have to do something right i guess, 
  the concept of freedom in europe and the us are two different philosophies . 
  freedom * to * and freedom * from * which is what it boils down to . 
  but ebm  edm , right ? 
  if by * most memorable * you mean most known here are two swedish ones . 
  the first one is probably * the * punk song most swedes will think of if you ask them to name one swedish punk song . 
  [ 800 grader - ebba gr\u00f6n ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uc7dwbdvg ) ( 800 degrees - ebba green ) ebba gr\u00f6n is taken from a code word used by swedish police to arrest german terrorist norbert kr\u00f6cher who was planning to kidnap a swedish politican anna-greta leijon [ var e vargen - imperiet ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zx0zyzrttj0 ) ( where 's the wolf - the empire ) imperiet was formerly known as rymdimperiet ( the space empire ) who took it 's name from the second star wars film ( episode 5 ) but later chose to only use the name imperiet, 
   so just remember , when someone asks stupid questions , it 's legit curiosity and the lack of prior learning . 
  there is no guarantee for this . 
  with the amount of shitposting taking place lately in this sub it 's more likely a troll stiring up . 
  most common its the way the question is asked . 
  the questions are obviously asked abrasively and in an impolite way . 
  what if any other nationality pisses all over swedes ? 
  beads ... send beads, 
  i 've stopped exchanging the bulk of my moneyt before i travel .
