  even though the exchange office claim they are fee free , they actually place circa 11 % higher exchange rate than the [ * true rate * ] ( https://www.google.se/search?q=1+eur+in+usd&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-b&amp;gfe_rd=cr&amp;ei=uxubwmvceego8qf4-yjw ) . 
  and when you exchange back you do n't just reverse it if you have the receipt as we did back in the day , you actually have to * buy back * your currency . 
  i actually got a second mastercard ( debit ) with a bank that do until a year ago had no fees for taking out money in the local currency abroad . 
  march 2015 they changed that they will take out a fee of 1.25 % extra . 
  no static fee except for the atm in the country you 'll take out money in , usually around 3.5 $ . 
  if you withdraw 500 $ in one go you 're total exchange rate is around 2 % ( 0.7 % per 100 $ @ 500 $ ) plus the 1.25 % from my card company . 
  the first round we withdrew money in the local currency with the same bank debit card we accidentally chose the wrong kind of withdrawal , the local bank did the currency exchange and it got more expensive than we anticipated . 
  the second time we just withdrew money and it worked well , only the 3.5 $ fee . 
  i 'll be using my new debit card when i go to sea and i will only bring about 175 $ in local currency which i have laying around since last time , taking out the survey , but it wo n't work as it 's set up now since i exchange money both before i go and at the destination . 
  ** how was the exchange fee ** is a different answer depending on if it 's exchange office or atm, 
  you 're about to discover, 
  you 're right, 
  do you really trust more than half of the population to vote rationally and informed ? 
  think about the * average * intelligent joe . 
  half of them are stupider than that . 
  i do n't trust people to vote informed , most of them just vote what * feels * right, 
  to my knowledge we do not have anything like that .

  iirc , london is swedens sixth largest city populationwise, 
  lo and behold , just the other day . 
  my postlady actually rang the door ( nobody rings my door except radiotj\u00e4nst ) . 
  i was very hesitant to open . 
  post lady had not * one * but ** two ** parcels for me that would n't fit in my mail slot . 
  should n't really good pay attract the really smart students too and they would force out the weaker ones that would n't get into the teachers program ? 
  the really shitty candidates that have maybe teachers as their tertiary choice . 
  swedens version of the sat goes from 0.0 to 2.0 with a bell curve , meaning that 80 % will be between 0.8 and 1.2 . 
  last time i checked teachers only needed 0.1 to get in through the sat . 
  you can literally just check any answer and you 'll get more than 0.1, 
   i 'm not sure why the gap is so large , but i imagine that the lack of unions is a part of it . 
  capitalism is the word you 're looking for . 
  should n't a very good pay attract all people but only the really smart ones get in ? 
  aruba is on my bucket list . 
  i have a bunch of them but i hope it 'll be within the nearest couple of years . 
  before 2020 hopefully, 
  switch to [ this ] ( http://estonianworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/594px-estonian_alternative_flag_proposal2.svg_.png ) and we 'll start negotiations :d,

  maria is the most common female name in sweden . 
  one in eight women has it either as a first name or middle name . 
  it has no religious connotation even though jesus mum is named maria in swedish . 
  double names usually do not contain maria , much more common to be marie . 
  like marie-louise, 
  absolutely not if it 's going to be used for anything but european soil and as a defence force . 
  no extra-european territories and not for invasion and ** not ** for camouflaged * peace-keeping * missions . 
  that 's for un to administer with national militaries . 
  i 'd say , no , no joint army . 
  greece ? 
  netherlandish bible belt ? 
  you keep saying that like it 's true . 
  i 'm genuinely interested in what you base that assumption on, 
   so you go around calling eygptians africans . 
  they are africans ( and north africans and egyptians ) . 
   the continent has nothing to do with your country 's people 's names . 
  i 'm both a swede and a european . 
  just as people born on the continent of america are americans . 
  indians are indians and asians just as israelis are both israelis and asians . 
   europe is the butt or the head of asia , how does it get it 's its own status is beyond me . 
  because it 's defined that way, 
  yep , which means it 's not a continent, 
  the last year i 've mostly just played factorio and kerbal space program . 
  got to love those sandboxy games . 
  i prefer games that are co-op instead of vs so i 've been playing far cry 3 co-op with a friend sporadically . 
  there are seven continents , india not being one of them, 
  andorra , lichtenstein and san marino because until a week ago i did n't have any place in europe i would want to visit before i see more of the rest of the world . 
  european destinations does n't appeal to me much at all but the microstates of europe are still very exotic in some way while the rest of europe is n't, 
   why not ? 
  they were born in europe and grew up in your culture . 
  is n't that the definition of european ? 
  how is yours on topic and mine is n't when the resemblance is uncanny ? 
  according to many americans mexican babies born in the usa are n't americans . 
  ( imo everybody born in north our south american are americans . 
  america is not a country or a federation , it 's two continents ), 
  what 's wrong with old netherlands ? 
   most countries in the world have a `` right of return '' please provide source, 
  ten most popular in sweden are in order lab , german shepherd , poodle , chihuahua , golden retreiver , yorkshire terrier , daschhound , beagle , boxer and miniature schnauzer to add to this . 
  sweden has zero strays . 
  i see a couple every year standing by e6 , moste often in gothenburg but also sometimes in malm\u00f6,

  * delivery of 83 ic4 trainsets for the danish state railways dsb was originally planned for 2003-2006 . 
  a primary settlement was reached in may 2009 . 
  danish state railways shall receive the uncompleted trains from ansaldobreda , complete the trains itself , and shall certify the trains for public usage itself . 
  ansaldobreda will pay back 2.25 billion dkk ( 300 million euro ) . 
  * bonus trivia * in december 2011 , it was reported that one of the missing ic4 trainsets planned for delivery in denmark was found in libya . 
  [ 58 ] reportedly , ansaldobreda and then italian prime minister silvio berlusconi gave libyan dictator muammar gaddafi the trainset as a present on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of gaddafi 's revolution in 2009 . 
  til, 
  the only title i can think of is md 's in the appropriate environment . 
  either doktor * lastname * or possibly doktor * firstname * .

  i 've always ever had my sights on the tropics when i travel but it seems that i might have to visit estonia both in the summer and winter . 
  here , have a few jas-39 gripen at a bargain price, 
  tbf , gothenburg , sweden bought italian trams and literally has been a catastrophe , they ca n't handle the weather for one thing ( among a bunch of other things ) . 
  the climate being one of the most important ones , let 's just say that ansaldobreda wo n't be delivering any trams anywhere in sweden in the foreseeable future . 
  it 's just insane that after ordering the first 45 they city went ahead an ordered 20 more instead of starting the next generations procurement straight away * in february 2013 , 38 out of the total 40 trams delivered in the first series were taken out of service due to extensive corrosion on the chassis . 
  [ 81 ] reparing the rusted chassis and moldy passenger floors is expected to be completed by 2017 , [ 82 ] at a cost for gothenburg council of an extra $ 10m according to the revised contract , although ansaldobreda bears the majority of the cost for these deficiencies . 
  [ citation needed ] of the 65 trams purchased , only about 35-40 are usable .
