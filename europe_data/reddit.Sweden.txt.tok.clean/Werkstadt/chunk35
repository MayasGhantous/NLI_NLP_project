  [ 44 ] due to further delays on the part of ansaldobreda with the corrosion repairs and substandard quality in completed works , the council of gothenburg cancelled the contract for corrosion repairs in november 2015 . 
  [ 44 ] none of the three repaired trams that ansaldobreda delivered was in working order and might actually be scrapped . 
  the investigation launched into the matter found that the trams were jerry-built and that ansaldobreda did not have the will , nor the competence to do anything about the problems . 
  [ 45 ] it was also discovered that the badly built trams have resulted in extensive track damage that will be very costly to repair , adding to the `` fiasco '' of the gothenburg ansaldobreda tram affaire . 
  * * after the problems had been publicised in swedish media , ansaldobreda chairman antonio liguori sent a letter to gothenburg municipality which contained threats of concerted actions with other companies against the municipality , along with demands of 10 million euro .

  ** the sinking of the passenger ferry ms estonia in ' 94 ** * conspiracy theories exist about the cause of the sinking . 
  german journalist jutta rabe and the left-wing magazine new statesman claim that laboratory tests on debris recovered illegally from estonia 's bow yielded trace evidence of a deliberate explosion , which they allege was concealed by the swedish , british , and russian governments to cover up an intelligence operation smuggling military hardware via the civilian ferry . 
  [ 22 ] members of the joint accident investigation commission denied these claims , saying that the damage seen on the debris occurred during the visor 's detachment from the vessel . 
  the jaic cited results from germany 's federal institute for materials research and testing , which found that jutta rabe 's samples did not prove an explosion occurred . 
  in the autumn of 2004 , a former swedish customs officer claimed on sveriges television that estonia had been used to transport military equipment in september 1994 . 
  [ 24 ] the swedish and estonian governments subsequently launched separate investigations , which both confirmed that non-explosive military equipment was aboard the ship on 14 and 20 september 1994 . 
  according to the swedish ministry of defence , no such equipment was on board at the day of the disaster and previous investigations by the swedish customs service found no reports of any anomalous activity around the day of the disaster .

  [ 20 ] according to this report , the murderer was identified by two witnesses who happened to be at the scene and who knew the murderer from previous encounters . 
  * source [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/assassination_of_olof_palme#police_conspiracy ) ** there is also a funny deliberate fictitious conspiracy that football world cup in 1958 did n't really take place in sweden ( konspiration 58 / conspiracy 58 ) ** * conspiracy 58 ( swedish : konspiration 58 or ksp58 ) is a swedish mockumentary from 2002 , produced by sveriges television , the swedish public broadcaster . 
  the plot of the film is that the 1958 fifa world cup in sweden did n't really take place , but was faked and exists only as forged television and radio coverage in a conspiracy between american and swedish television , the cia and fifa as part of the cold war . 
  in the film it is said that sweden did not have the economic or technical resources to actually host such a large event . 
  in the plot , the american motive for doing this was to test the effectiveness of televised propaganda . 
  when the film originally aired , the audience was not told in advance that it was a mockumentary , giving the impression that conspiracy 58 was a regular documentary film .

  [ this ] ( http://aktuelltfokus.se/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/v%c3%a4lg%c3%b6randedopp.jpg ) joker , bert karlsson who was the driving force in the early ninetees behind the party * new democracy *  * new democracy successfully campaigned on an agenda of reform and , although not nationalist , restricted immigration ( initially on economic grounds rather than cultural ) . 
  its economic policy , stressing the importance of entrepreneurship and deregulation , was generally perceived as right-wing policies . 
  the party furthermore favored a swedish application for european union membership ( attained in 1995 ) . 
  it also called for wide-scale political reform , including cutting government departments , reducing the riksdag to 151 members and electing prime minister by direct ballot rather than through the riksdag .

  sweden having the second most winnings in esc after ireland .

  wow such american brainwashed little child [ wikipedia source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cuban_missile_crisis#quarantine ) :  mcnamara supported the naval blockade as a strong but limited military action that left the u.s. in control . 
  however , the term `` blockade '' was problematic . 
  ** according to international law a blockade is an act of war ** , but the kennedy administration did not think that the ussr would be provoked to attack by a mere blockade . 
  trololololol , it was illegal by international law , you 're american so you would n't understand that it also applies to you, 
  and who will control * the narration * ? 
  the bigger power will through channels overwhelm us and be chosen by the narrator . 
  we see it all the time , it 's just disguised . 
  the us made an illegal blokade against cuba which is technically an act of war but in their narration called it * a quarantine *, 
  uhm , is n't nato obligated by signed treaties to react if a nato member is attacked ?
