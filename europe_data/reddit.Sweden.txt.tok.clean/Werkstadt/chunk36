  is it stressing a word differently ? 
  reminds me of fanny . 
  in danish * balle * means your asscheeks but in swedish it 's your junk . 
  except in the southern most province where it means the same as in danish, 
  swedish only have three words that end in double m ( ramm , damm and lamm ) one of them being lamb , otherwise it would 've worked in swedish too . 
  you should see a doctor, 
  a dane is understandable if they annunciate, 
  that they ( norway , denmark and finland ) are essentially like us . 
  only with languages you ca n't understand ( denmark/finland ) and adorably cute like chip 'n' dale ( norway ), 
  male does n't equal masculine . 
  absolutely . 
  although i did n't ask for a name that is strictly used in a single country but i understand how you would think that, 
  apparently not available where i am : /, 
  thinking mainly on the french dominique ( same pronunciation different spelling ), 
  that 's interesting , dominic is a name that 's gender neutral in some places, 
  nusa lembongan outside bali , indonesia is both my most southern and eastern 8.67 s , 115.45 e most western is san francisco 122.41 w most northern is ume\u00e5 , sweden 63.33 n highest just a few hundred meters somewhere , i 'm not sure . 
  mountaineering is n't something i have done . 
  east/west : 238 degrees north/south : 72 degrees, 
  i have more humility than any other redditor here . 
  since sandy hook there has been over 80 school shootings in the us, 
  i live in gothenburg and i feel far much safer when i 'm travelling south east asia than i do in my own home town . 
  i do n't even think it 's a false sense of safety . 
   that they are only safe in america . 
  this is n't even a hyperbole . 
  how * you * doin ' ? 
  i 've been living in gothenburg and south close to 40 years and i have never seen the northern light . 
  you mean i can get my own personal assistant for just 400 euros ? 
  the other day i thought about myself growing up . 
  i was an adult before i heard of someone i socialized with who was religious . 
  not a single person in my class that i know of believed in a deity . 
  looking at the world today i feel that its kind of weird, 
  you mean you have laws against non-portoguese names ? 
  i think iceland have something similar except icelandic names , not portuguese, 
  sweden has them . 
  flying from the most southern airport ( malm\u00f6 city airport , third largest ) to kiruna ( must be most northern takes 3h20 with a stop in oslo or stockholm ( 100 $ ) . 
  to drive it would take at best almost 20h ( 1843km ) . 
  train would take at least as long . 
  i would n't say domestic flights are awfully popular but being a very long country , almost 2000km from north to south by road it happens, 
  did you reply to the wrong / r/askeurope thread ? 
  did you mean to reply to [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/5lg0gr/whats_something_popular_that_comes_out_of_your/ ) one ? 
  ( for what it 's worth , i 'm not the one that downvoted you ), 
  i made one years ago and i still have n't broken it . 
  it was to not make new years resolutions . 
  holy crap you have 40 + letters in your alphabet ? 
  swedish have 9 vowels and all of them can be either short or long . 
  how does it work with dutch ? 
  in swedish we also have a stones throw away ( ett stenkast bort ), 
  i 'm arguing against his faulty calculations , not advocating for a migration . 
  you know people can actually speak about pros and cons purely hypothetical . 
  so who are you telling me that i should n't discuss it ? 
   so you 're ** asking ** people to adopt a measuring system and a new counting system . 
  tell me again where i 'm ** asking ** anything ? 
  you 're still doing it wrong 0.1 in your calculations is one tenth . 
  but 0.1 is equal to one \u0190 : th ( one twelfth ) would be just that one . 
  you 're still using 10 base decimals it would n't need to replace the metric system , a 12 base metric system is just as viable, 
  with a twelve base it would n't be 0.083 . 
  you clearly do n't understand how base works . 
  we would have two more digits and it would ease look like 0.1 but with the new digit, 
  that 's because you use base ten for both numbers, 
  if you wanted a subjectiv answer just take the answer and be happy . 
  if you wanted an objective answer use wikipedia, 
  it does , but it also explains the definition of a country , which you asked for . 
  the clip also defines what a nation is . 
  not foreigners , just swedes on hiatus, 
  i 've come across a single non-swede that spoke swedish during my 21 years on the internet, 
  in sweden it 's on christmas eve , either [ before donald duck or after donald duck ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/from_all_of_us_to_all_of_you ), 
  can confirm . 
  when me and my brother lived in malm\u00f6 we have both worked in copenhagen . 
  * god forts\u00e4ttning * is a pretty neutral * good-bye * but it 's used just around new years . 
  it 's not really about the holliday though , just in conjunction ( i.e. 
  from what i gather from a bunch of stockholmians have this arrogant self-absorbed preconception that finland is equally * important * to the whole of sweden just because stockholm is the gateway to finland . 
  when i pointed out what you just did they told me that it was * a failure in school * that they did n't teach * finlands importance * enough / * correctly * ( disclaimer : i do n't mean that finland is objectively unimportant , just that it does n't have as large impact on the rest of sweden as it has on the north-eastern parts of sweden ) growing up in south sweden ( and cousins in western sweden ) i never heard anyone speak about finland as they did about denmark or norway . 
  i live about 300km away from my family and i need to get up in just a few hours to drive there for christmas dinner ( dec 24th as is customary in sweden ) for extended family my cousins live 100km in the other direction and for my second cousins and such i do n't really know where they are . 
  i do n't know them . 
  i think you 're having a preconceived thought that russians in eesti is evenly spread so that every fourth person he runs into is speaking russian . 
  ethnicities tend to stick with their own and if he 's in a place where they 're concentrated . 
  it would be much more than every fourth . 
  yeah exactly !, 
  did n't the brits do a remake of that with their tunnel ? 
  i 've seen all three !, 
  turkey is not in the eu , a very small part of turkey is in europe though . 
  maybe this is why you find it * very bizarre *, 
   the vat in sweden is 25 % and 5 % for another stupid tax . . what extra tax are you referring to ? 
  if it 's toll i think 5 % is off , it 's usually 12 % for customs fee . 
  vat actually differes depending on what kind of product it is . 
  like video cameras are taxed higher than non-video camers ( that 's why you see cameras not being able to record more than 29 minutes and 59 seconds . 
  30 minutes or more it 's considered a video camera . 
  the insane part though is that you can end up paying vat for the postage as well . 
  the toll fee varies widely depending on product type . 
  i ca n't find the complete list but [ here 's ] ( http://www.aftonbladet.se/minekonomi/article16582076.ab ) an article about it, 
  i visit copenhangen every other year or so . last year i visited three sea countries on two different trips . 
  2016 i have n't been out of the country but leaving for sea early next year again . 
  i 've noticed that americans are n't that well travelled outside their own continent . 
  lately i 've been thinking that that one major reason is living standard abroad unless you pay ridiculous amount of money . 
  i have no trouble getting around in a third world country and living without ac or real toilets . 
  another reason seem to be that there 's so much to see and a genuine disinterest in other peoples cultures . 
  and third is that they only look at the travel prices on going overseas and not consider the living expenses . 
  sure , the flight is going to be the most expensive part but you can easily find nice ackomodation for less than 30 usd per night for two people and restaurant dinner for like 6-8 usd in sea, 
   some were saying it 's in the eu therefore it 's european . 
  what is in the eu ?
