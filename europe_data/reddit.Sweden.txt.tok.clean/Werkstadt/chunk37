  i think norweigans , swedes and ** possibly finns ** does n't consider themselves * mainland europe either * . 
  still european, 
  i refer to mainland europe as * the continent *, 
  wait what ? 
  i think norweigans , swedes and possibly finns does n't consider themselves * mainland europe either * . 
  still european, 
  do n't kids figure out this on their own ? 
  at that age , confirm it, 
  conscription was made non-mandatory a couple of years ago but it 's likely they will enforce it again from 2018 because the military have trouble filling up the ranks . 
  it 's also likely that this time around it will be gender-neutral . 
  for countries that do n't live up to their defense goals conscription should be mandatory, 
  simply tjeckien in swedish, 
  was n't sure , less than half of europes countries use the euro or the pound, 
  surprisingly [ not ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=sv&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fnordiskmytologi.se%2fvarldens-skapelse%2f&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ) if i understand it correctly, 
  honda released a city car a decade ago or so , model name was * fitta * , it did n't take long until they rebranded the model to * honda jazz * in scandinavia . 
  turns out , fitta means * cunt * . 
  iirc it 's honda jazz world wide now, 
  millions in what currency ? 
  funny how you call it nordic while we call it l\u00e4ngdskidor ( lit translation : length skis ), 
  i 'm sure it is the second largest or the largest in the five countries who realistically can win the world cup, 
  probably , being one of the five nations who wins ice hockey world cups it has to be, 
  nothing for the nation but norse mythology has a [ creation story ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=sv&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fnordiskmytologi.se%2fvarldens-skapelse%2f&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ), 
  this seabed looks pretty damn abundant , let 's sow here, 
   with iphone being the * best * most popular what do you mean by this ? 
  sweden just had one of those , ended yesterday i think but it had really nothing to do with holidays , they do this in think twice a year in different cities, 
  i 'm a blond scandinavian dude , will i be molested if i go to italy and will it cost me anything ? 
  speaking of scots and balkan . 
  in swedish the shots in sarajevo is called * skotten i sarajevo * . 
  skotten is both * the shots * and * the scotsman * all depending on the inflection of the word * skotten * . 
  i always imagine some cringy sean connery drama set in sarajevo, 
  i would rename aladeen to aladeen, 
  without a doubt , [ fika ] ( https://youtu.be/7vuipwicipo ) ( 6 parts ), 
  alright then , then i am truly blessed . 
  ( that or i 'm very conscious of what music i consume )  maybe 2016 is n't that bad, 
  [ janssons frestelse ] ( https://sweden.se/culture-traditions/janssons-temptation/ ) ( janssons temptation ) easy enough and a delight to devour, 
  oh i think it 's because of that thing people think is a thing but is n't a thing . 
  * cultural appropriation *, 
  never heard of it , but then again , i do n't watch tv , listen to radio or read news papers . 
  it 's a blessing, 
  why not both ? 
  just feel weird being exclusive, 
  before wwii it was named the great war since it was the largest conflict known to man . 
  then the armistice discontinued, 
  not pointing a knife, 
   within temptation     i thought they were from finland lol nightwish is from finland and theatre of tragedy who pretty much made the genre popular is mostly norweigan, 
  now i know what i 'll do next time i visit k\u00f6benhavn, 
  drunk , insane or foreigner . 
  uncertain which is the most benign, 
  * gravlax * , very important one . 
  and * sloyd * appearntly there are a bunch of geological terms as well ( * trapp , alvar , varve * ), 
  with your argument that it 's like * this * because of * that * does n't really hold together because what you 're doing is making some things irrelevant and some things relevant so that they fit in your hypothesis . 
  what 's christmas named in danish ? 
  tell us more !, 
  yeah i 'm sure that wo n't pressure anyone to doing something that they do n't want to . 
  ~ ~ public ~ ~ peer pressure is a none issue . 
  / s edit : clarification, 
  what level of school was this ? 
  * funny thing * is that around 50 years ago or so sweden have what we called * [ du-reformen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/du-reformen ) * ( in sweden like in germany we have both du/ni like you have du/sie ) but fifty years ago something happened and everyone except royalty became du , first name basis with ** everyone ** ( except royalty ) . 
  * ... to thunderous applause *, 
  let 's have a * vote * on that, 
  definetely depends on where you live . 
  i know teachers in the south that does n't conform and oh boy it 's almost ostracization, 
  the fact that someone even tries to punish you shows how abhorrent it is . 
  think of all the times it does n't make the news . 
  because it 's pretty hitlery jugendy . 
  how would you know if you do n't know how many you 're missing to spot ? 
  you made the exact same point i corrected . 
  where does it say swedes are the only ones ? 
  i think it could have something to do with easterners know they are n't on par with westerners when it comes to certain things so there 's really nothing to be smug about it . 
  but romania got kick ass broadband from what i heard , be smug about that :d, 
  there 's nobody claiming swedes are the * only * one , that was n't the question , it was * who 's the most *, 
  username checks out . 
  i 'd love to visit canada some day to see experience what 's it like . 
  i 've done a coast to coast trip of the us , did n't like it much . 
  i 'd assume * more guns * is * more hunting guns * , not pistols, 
  kudos to germany that gotten way better at ice hockey in the last decade or so . 
  it 's still more or less only 5 countries that * can * win the world cup but the other teams are becoming a threat . 
  what do you mean * normal * hockey ? 
  it 's prefixed with a noun like field or ice ( swedish : landhockey and ishockey ), 
  does nl even have an ice hockey team ? 
  hands down sweden , always being so smug about how we 're doing something so well and how all other countries should do what we do and then trying to act all humble about it , all according to [ * jantelagen * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/law_of_jante ), 
  sometimes they do ( wrongly ) , but then it 's the nordic countries, 
  * which countries makes up scandinavia ( denmark , norway , sweden ) * what are the baltic states ( estonia , latvia lithuania ) * which countries makes up benelux ( belgium , netherlands , luxemburg ) * is x a monarchy or a republic ? 
  * what country did serbia and croatia part of before splitting ? 
   `` i guess we are n't going to a bar tonight ? '', 
  reminds me of [ speaking like a minnesotan ] ( https://youtu.be/vm-mrkojpc8 ), 
  separation of state happened when the new millenia began, 
  but ... 
  so is sweden ... bro :'(, 
  oh this is just some scheme to get into nordic, 
  just one more notch, 
  * frankly my dear , i do n't give a damn *, 
  also , finland is not a monarchy and has a president, 
  i 've been playing team fortress since 1999 both with tfc and tf2 and i just felt that overwatch was * jerky * in the controls . 
  there is no such thing as a * standard accent *, 
  i 've been tempted to buy overwatch but eventually blizzard had a free overwatch weekend and i tried it . 
  i could n't get paid to play that game . 
  the only strip club i 've been in the ladies just does their thing and afterwards the go around and ask if you want a private dance . 
  so the strip is more of a promotion thing .
