  also iirc they are paid by the club itself, 
  rikssvenska is also an accent . 
  there is no such thing as * default * swedish, 
  hands down * [ \u00f6sj\u00f6tska ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%96stg%c3%b6tska ) * i had a safety instructor who had a broad accent of \u00f6sj\u00f6tska and it was very hard to take his lectures seriously . 
  somewhere in the countryside far from everymore, 
   it is technically a shopping mall now , so i do n't know if it counts . 
  really ? 
  last time i was there it was just one big department store , not a building which housed a bunch of other stores ( aka mall ), 
  i 'm not sure about the current statistics with all the cars rolling on swedish roads but 2015 sold more automatic transmission than manual ( 51.4 % 2015 , 44.5 % 2014 ) so it 's just a matter of time when there are more automatics out there . 
  automatics used to use 20 % more fuel than manual ones but automatics are in generally more efficient now in fuel consumption iirc, 
  m\u00e4n som hatar kvinnor was my second choice , it was well executed but the two follow ups were more like tv films and did n't live up the legacy of the first film . 
  bonus choice . 
  [ smala sussie ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0323998 ) is hilarious but much of the film is lost in translation because of the actors dialect which is very much why it 's so funny, 
  * where is the hate ? 
  * phobia = an irrational ** fear ** of something . 
  * bigotry ? 
  silly rhetoric to guilt trip people to not say something they do n't agree with . 
  tough one , cant decide, 
  in my opinion when going abroad is that americans , russians and the chinese are in general the most rude ones . 
  americans are often very loud and is heard by everyone and unaware of other customs . 
  russians are just rude especially towards service personnel like waiters and such . 
  chinese are just not bothered by anything anyone.if they want something they just do it . 
  to be fair aboutthe russians and chinese is that they as a people are pretty * new money * which often result in an other kind of rudeness because they think theyre entitled now . 
  edit : i 'm sure there are exceptions andthat i might not be aware of the ones that do n't act like this, 
  i do n't enjoy swedish productions in general . 
  usually incredible bad acting , sloppy scripts and so on . 
  imo its because actors are schooled in stage acting where the observers are sometimes 20 metres from the action and getting a camera stuck in your face the acting gets overplayed . 
  however there are a few films that are amazing in my opinion . 
  the newest one is * l\u00e5t den r\u00e4tte komma in * ( let the right one in ) . 
  amazing photo , atmosphere and the acting is well done . 
  we 're all aware that the roman empire conquered tribes/people/land and then * incorporated * it/them into the roman empire . 
  but what you obviously fail to fathom is that the question is not about the people living as a part of the roman empire but about the people that started it . 
   ** stroopwafel **  popular throughout the world , the ` stroopwafel ' is undoubtedly the most famous and popular pastry from the netherlands . 
  since this food is famous and popular in the rest of the world , does that mean that you as a dutch person ca n't be proud of the dutch food stroopwafel ? 
  the roman empire originated from rome hence @op question . 
  that 's just silly logic . 
  black chocolate matters !, 
  * triggered *, 
  i thought finns didnt nu need to learn swedish in school anymore, 
  i do n't have a license for firearms and never been in the miltary . 
  first time i fired a gun was on an army firing range during \u00e4n exhibit . 
  i shot the swedish ak4 in prone positiob . 
  i was nine or nearly ten at the time . 
  second time shot a black powder magnum 357 and magnum 44 at age 14 with my brothers father in law . 
  after that ive shot shotguns , .22 , 9mm and a scoped hunting rifle as an adult a couple times . 
  i have no real interest in firearms but its kind of fun to d\u00f6 from time to time edit : im a city kid and only ever lived in the larger cities, 
  i brought the beer , did you bring the popcorn and peanuts ? 
  without a doubt , [ folkrace ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/folkrace )  swedish folkrace is a popular , inexpensive , and entry-level form of nordic rallycross that originally comes from finland , where it is called jokamiesluokka ( everyone 's class ) . 
  the sport also exists in norway and denmark , where it is known as bilcross and folker\u00e6s respectively . 
   the races are run on special gravel or tarmac tracks , 2,400 metres ( 1.5 mi ) in length . 
  the tracks are designed to limit the top speed to 80 km/h ( 50 mph ) . 
  the competitions are divided into different classes depending on age and gender . 
  participants can be as young as 15 years of age . 
   the race is divided into different heats with usually 6 cars . 
  the driver winning a race is awarded seven points , second five points , third four points and so on . 
  when all the heats have been driven , the total score is calculated and the top six drivers get to race in the a final , the next six in the b final and so on . 
  the winner of the a final wins the event . 
   ** to maintain its inexpensive nature , there is a rule on price . 
  the races are run in standard cars , but participants are generally free to choose as long as they meet certain minimum safety regulations . 
  anyone can place a fix-price bid on any car , the buyer is then chosen randomly . 
  the fixed price is 6500 sek ( ca usd 1000 ) and in finland $ 1500 . 
  refusing to sell is grounds for having one 's competition license revoked . 
  not included in the sale is personal equipment such as seat and safety harness . 
  this type of system eliminates the motivation for sinking extensive amounts of work and money into a folkrace car . 
  * ver - * sounds a lot like the prefix * f\u00f6r * in swedish and that it 's not really different words but a prefix for words that makes perfect sense . 
  sten-sax-p\u00e5se ( stone-scissors-bag ), 
  all of them . 
  in a pizzeria right now , there is 62 different pizza on the menu . 
  although paper is translated to bag, 
  if not pointing at someone but still staying inanimate i think swedish police would not have shot but kept aiming on the subject . 
  it 's very uncommon that police shoots anyone in sweden and most of the time it 's to disable . 
  but it 's hard to tell what would have happened in this exact situation . 
  only two cases i can remember off the top of my head are a guy with a knife charging the police officers . 
  both with deadly results with the police shooting the subject . 
  funny that you should mention that , i asked on my facebook feed a while back what their favourite dialect is and half of them said scanian ( none of them were scanian ) while the other 50 % were just a wide variety . 
  i do n't understand why it would be any ones favourite but i resent that it would be hated . 
  made fun of yes , hated no . 
   in the olden days you were supposed to burn the flag when it was decommissioned . 
  iirc it was also if the flag ever touched the ground , it had to be decomissioned, 
  do you get a new id every time you move ? 
  iirc , americans get a new license when the move ? 
  same in sweden as long as you can identify yourself and your allowed to drive . 
  nine countries in the eu do n't require you to carry . 
   we do n't have an id card in denmark like e.g. 
  german and many other european countries . 
  carrying an id is not required . 
  only seven eu countries have non-compulsory id laws austria , finland , france , ireland , italy , lithuania , sweden . 
  ( and denmark lack id ) [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_national_identity_card_policies_by_country ) edit , and the uk is similar to denmark in this regard, 
  hah , who know , i thought non-compulsory was the norm . 
  what strikes me as odd with american ids are home address, 
  [ william fitzsimmons ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mld3nlhnebw ), 
  been saying this for years but butt hurt ensues, 
  former eastern bloc \u2260 central europe . 
  former eastern bloc = roughly eastern europe imo . 
  have to compete with that german efficiency . 
  `` the shoebox '' ( aka v70 ) is not the best selling model anymore , v60 is iirc . 
  the v70 and its predecessor have been the best selling for decades , not decade . 
  i think you 're blatantly wrong in your analysis , volvo is n't the biggest brand because we have the v70 , volvo is the best selling brand because with swedish and made for swedish climate . 
  i 'm agreeing with you and elaborating further . 
  every system has flaws , if capitalism was perfect there would n't be anti trust laws or laws against monopoly and cartels , but obviously they are needed .
