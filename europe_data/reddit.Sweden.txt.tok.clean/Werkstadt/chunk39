  if communism was perfect it would 've worked by now but it does n't have room for the kind of people that want more than others , which is a fundamental human drive for some ( many ? ), 
  which in turn makes most of the people want more too . 
  if you get * rid * of that kind of human drive , i.e. 
  killing off dissidents and at that moment you lost the whole point of communism . 
  no system is perfect because humans are diverse . 
  [ if a large portion of the community uses it as an opinion it 's an opinion ] ( http://www.quickmeme.com/img/df/df5c504d10c538e4c5b88e308206a324ed6c0fcff9e54a3e131fc3c17aff7464.jpg ) just like in real life . 
  and that 's your opinion . 
  i think it 's mostly because its a swedish brand , look at all the over countries that produce cars , the most popular brand is their own . 
  are you getting your answers ? 
  why would you care about votes ? 
   fyi it 's my right to chose a country that values individual freedoms . 
  and their right to downvote ... 
  vw is pretty damn [ popular ] ( http://66.media.tumblr.com/d0be6b2493c23cee648169d93c4821a6/tumblr_nb8efd169y1svtp5bo1_1280.jpg ) in central europe, 
  hands down volvo , especially in gothenburg region .

  sounds like the [ 3/5 compromise ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/three-fifths_compromise )  the three-fifths compromise was a compromise reached between delegates from southern states and those from northern states during the 1787 united states constitutional convention . 
  the debate was over whether , and if so , how , slaves would be counted when determining a state 's total population for legislative representation and taxing purposes . 
  the issue was important , as this population number would then be used to determine the number of seats that the state would have in the united states house of representatives for the next ten years . 
  the effect was to give the southern states a third more seats in congress and a third more electoral votes than if slaves had been ignored , but fewer than if slaves and free persons had been counted equally , allowing the slaveholder interests to largely dominate the government of the united states until 1861 . 
  [ 1 ] the compromise was proposed by delegates james wilson and roger sherman . 
  tbh , a university student who intends to be * dicking around * europe i assume * scenery * is n't really on op 's mind . 
  i think cheap and good infrastructure connections is what he 's looking for . 
  which is why / u/michail _ pl said * on pair * ( sic on par ) and not * the same *, 
  i barely know what this is , from my understanding this is something much much newer than other christmas eve traditions . 
  in sweden , donald duck is the main disney character, 
   also , you have to understand that many european democracies are not two-party systems ; sweden has 8 parties in the parliament ( need more than 4 % of the votes to get seats ), 
  from what i gather , he does n't intend to work but live off savings . 
  social democrats shaped sweden for a 100 + years , and on occasion the opposition ruled for a few years but mostly they 've dictated what course to head sweden for , not something the opposition could undirect in that short time span they were in the ruling position . 
  i should 've figured that out from spanish * puta * . 
  thanks, 
  wait what ? 
  you built a carrier and do n't have the planes to fill it ? 
  sounds like a game of * axis and allies *, 
  what does it mean ? 
  can confirm , worked at a building site a while back . 
  all of a sudden i hear * kurwa * . 
  i looked around the corner `` did you just say kurva ? '', 
  `` yeah , do you know it ? '', 
  smiling ensued, 
  like the english letter * i **, 
  if pirates could do it , so can you !, 
  i sincerely do n't understand what you would be a target from . 
  yes , [ abba ] ( https://static.mathem.se/shared/images/products/large/inlagd-sill-240g-abba-1578909153.jpg ), 
  nej nej , ikke kamel\u00e5s\u00e5 https://youtu.be/fqgrc5sfcaq, 
  they 're just so proud they know something about another country how minute it may ever be . 
  well are n't you getting around ? 
  slut !, 
  capital is most expensive city in the world . 
  edit : oh , oslo has dropped , topped the list for a few years . 
  http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2016/03/daily-chart-4 singapore is leading . 
  when i was there last year i was expecting it to be a killer but it was `` like home '', 
  i 'm close to 40 and i know almost no religious people . 
  only i know off the top of my head is my last girlfriends family , her dad was a priest in the swedish church . 
  all my life i thought that atheism was the norm and the religious people was the peculiar ones . 
  growing up i think none of my class mates believed in god, 
  is that the sweet licorice or the salty ones or both ? 
  when i hear dutch abroad my first reaction is `` oh , another swede '' then i try to listen to what that person is saying and i go `` that swede has a speech impediment '', 
  i think you will have to rustle up a source for that . 
  this is what i found and there is almost no one before 1998 . https://www.nordicnames.de/wiki/liam, 
  william and alice were the top names for newborns like circa 7 years ago and a friend of mine both have an alice and a william so they posed in a newspaper here when they did a report on it . 
  liam ( english non-swedish name ) is a typical * white trash * name in sweden, 
  in sweden , flour , sugar , cocoa etc are measured in volume . 
  usually it 's just almonds , nuts and stuff like that that are measured by weight where volume would obviously not work very well because of all the empty space nuts would leave in between them . 
  we use decilitre , tablespoon ( 15ml ) , teaspoon ( 5ml ) and then we have a * spice measurement * that 's 1ml, 
  interesting . 
  flour , sugar and all those kind of things are still measured in volume in sweden . 
  it 's things that are bigger like almonds or butter that 's measured in grams . 
  usually not cups though but we use four different kinds of volume measurements , they are decilitre , tablespoon ( 15ml ) teaspoon ( 5ml ) and * kryddm\u00e5tt * ( 1ml ) ( lit translation : spice measure ), 
  90 's is 16-25 years ago . 
  i 'd say that * few * is usually five or less, 
  reading the replies here i can definitely see granny-names in other countries that are common in my generation ( 1970 's ) . 
  emma is also a name not uncommon in my and the next generation . 
  i 'm not so sure about that . 
  i 'm born in the seventies and i do n't know a single one with these names . 
  and where are you from ? 
  in swedish it has to be torbj\u00f6rn ( lit meaning : thor-bear ) although * double names * are often seen as * dorky * here, 
  in swedish we have * gift * which means both * married * and * poison *, 
  in swedish commonly based in christianity , and more specifically satan , hell and devils . 
  i had n't even reflected that it was until i heard a while back that dutch curses often revolve around illness and diseases . 
  what 's it like where you live ? 
  amnesty encouraged but not guaranteed, 
  first time went abroad ( except for neighboring denmark and norway ) i was surprised we * had * to use bottled water . 
  swedish tap water is as good as it gets but how is tap water where you live ? 
  is it communal or do you get it from a well ? 
  / r/askeurope has quickly become my favourite subreddit and it 's mostly because of you guys . 
  i love how it rarely becomes an agitated discussion and how most people are moderate ( lagom :d ) and mostly just shrugs when two countrymen have a different perspective of something realizing that it might be different where that person lives even if it 's the same country . 
  i love how i learn ( and also teach other curious people ) so much about you and your countries and there prestige is not getting in the way , of course there are situations where there 's a disagreement but it does n't get toxic . 
  you should all feel proud about this amazing subreddit . 
  kudos to you, 
  i 've visited a few clubs in south east asia for the novelty and saw quite a few non-east-asians ladies being patrons . 
  im not judging , i 'm genuinely curious and a bit fascinated . 
  in swedish we have the word * f\u00e5r * which means both * sheep * and * get * and with the sentence * far , f\u00e5r f\u00e5r f\u00e5r ? 
  nej , f\u00e5r f\u00e5r lamm * which means * father , does sheep get sheep ? 
  no , sheep gets lamb * for clarity , it 's not a tongue twisting kind of sentence edit : extended the sentence, 
  we 're a pretty tight knit group of users in / r/askeurope and most of us are savvy enough and do n't get too riled up when we 're discussing . 
  i would like to call for a pledge to not engage at all with user questions that are obviously trolling where their main reason is to get a rise out of us . 
  of course our reaction is to put things right by arguing against it but it gives me the most pleasure denying them what they 're here for . 
  i 'd love for these trolls to be met with an absolute silence . 
  sweden have had conscription army for most of the 20th century all up to 2010 . 
  it will be reintroduced in 2017 and it has become gender neutral .
