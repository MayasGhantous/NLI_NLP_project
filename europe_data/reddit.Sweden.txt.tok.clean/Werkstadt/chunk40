  edit : back when i did the mandatory trials ( 1995 ) it was more or less being phased out that only the one that wanted to do service got to do it , but the government reserved the right to call me in for service if they saw a need for it . 
  i did n't do military service , not because i did n't want to but because they did n't * need * me, 
  i listen to a bunch of german bands like ** melotron ** , rammstein , unheilig , ncor , eisbrecher , in extremo , nachtmahr . 
  but also some french * - singing * like ma\u00eetre gims and stromae, 
  purein swedish the word for mother is * mor * and for father it 's * far * . 
  so mother father ( your maternal grandfather is * morfar * . 
  in english you do n't differentiate maternal or paternal grandparents with single words . 
  how does it work in your language ? 
  maternal grandmother = mormor paternal grandfather = farfar your paternal grandfather father would me farfars far edit . 
  we also differentiate on nephews , uncles , aunts and neices . 
  brother = bror . 
  brothers son would be brorson father 's brother = farbror mothers brother = morbror, 
  in swedish we have names like sten and bj\u00f6rn which means stone and bear edit : stig which means trampled path edit : clarification . 
  i did n't mean names that * have a meaning * but more names that is also a common word used in everyday language, 
  edit : the most memorable to your personally , not your country edit 2 : please be a little more specific . 
  some of you are n't using flair and some are n't even explaining what sport you 're referring to, 
  please link a sound/youtube clip [ v\u00e4rml\u00e4ndska ] ( https://youtu.be/xuzq0-fmq40 ) get 's me everytime [ here ] ( https://youtu.be/t3mlgtospge ) is a rendition of many dialects by one of swedens most known comedians, 
  as someone who does n't , but i really want to understand the people who does . 
  please explain your reasoning edit : it seems like all of the pros are just pros on paper with no regard of actual real world practicality , disregarding the diversity between us, 
  we pay approximately 35 euro ( 350 sek ) and it last for five years . 
  we also have a temporary emergency passport , it 's pink and only valid for one specific trip . 
  and it 's about 100 euro ( 980 sek ) passport fornchildren under twelve is only valid for three years since last year . 
  it used to be 10 years for adults and five years for minors apparently since last year , a person can `` only '' get three passports in a five year period because of misuse on the black market . 
  during 2009 and 2013 one person vad approves of 18 new passports, 
  like thursday ( torsdag ) means day of thor or thors day . 
  and saturday ( l\u00f6rdag ) means the day for washing/bathe ( l\u00f6ga , a word not in usage today ) yourself in swedish . 
  alright , i ca n't speak for all scandinavians/nordics but i believe the majority in these countries do . 
  inspired by the other thread about interesting history . 
  let us know and we 'll try to answer it . 
  i 'd love to know more about the polish situation with all those borders going everywhere . 
  what 's the gist of it ? 
  in sweden [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vgw7pie.jpg ) is a very common look on guys and girls graduating gymnasium . 
  guys most often wear a classic suit and the girls most often wear dresses in white . 
  and the * [ studentm\u00f6ssa ] ( http://i.imgur.com/1aqftsi.png ) * , the white hat with the black brim has been part of graduating for a very long time . 
  before the students come through the gates out to to their relatives in the school yard the relatives usually have a [ sign ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fiwfwpt.jpg ) like this with a picture of them as a baby , the class name and the students name . 
  often they get flowers hung around their neck ( see previous picture ) and small teddy bears with * studentm\u00f6ssa * . 
  sometimes a plastic champagne glass without a foot so that they can drink champagne on the go . 
  after that they often ride around the city in an * exotic * manner screaming at their top of the lungs that they 've graduated . 
  old veteran cars , convertibles , or the back of a [ large lorry or a tractor ] ( http://i.imgur.com/l3irocp.jpg ) often with a message written on the side with an internal joke and/or risqu\u00e9 message . 
  sometimes the [ police ] ( http://i.imgur.com/alhugxj.jpg ) stops the * studentflak * because there 's something too risky about driving them around . 
  every year your read about at least one accident that happened when driving around the students, 
  i saw [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lyaaugd.jpg ) map on imgur and i was wondering . 
  edit : czechia female knows what 's up, 
  i know the question seen similar to earlier asked questions but i never understood if english or any other was mandatory and during what time span . 
  when i grew up age ten ( grade four , 1987 ) we started with english in school and it 's mandatory all the way up to graduation of gymnasium . 
  elective third language could be chosen from grade seven in my school was german or french now days and i do n't know but i 've heard they start already in grade two . 
  redditors with children i 'm not asking because of integrity issues . 
  in swedish we use . 
  ( the approximate time i add is my personal , there is no consensus in sweden precisely when they are , i think your profession is what impact your view the most on this ) * morgon ( morning ) ( 04-09 ) * f\u00f6rmiddag = before dinner ( between morning and noon ) ( 09-12 ) * lunch ( around noon ) ( 11-13 ) ( ** edit ** if seems that parts of sweden use * middag * for this time , which literally mean mid-day but i 've only heard people use it for dinner ) * eftermiddag = after dinner ( afternoon ) ( 12-17 ) * kv\u00e4ll = evening ( 17-23 ) * natt = night ( 23-04 ) we also have a word , * dygn * for a 24h period which i think english lack . 
  they often use hours ( 24 ) instead or day which can be confusing if they mean during * daytime * or a complete 24h cycle . 
  it would be fun to see if guys could pin the countries since some of you have been regulars to this sub for quite a while . 
  i tried a dozen different quizes and this is the one i liked the most . 
  it 's only drawback is that it checks of the ones you already pinned . 
  http://online.seterra.com/en/vgp/3007 tell us what your score was and which ones you bungled . 
  it 's all in good fun and i 'm sure nobody will make fun of you , 
  if this was any other subreddit i would be more careful to ask . 
  please be civil and ** keep ideology out of this **, 
  bonus points if it was before the time of internet, 
  please expand what s/he does and why you 're crushing, 
  for example in swedish . 
  * vall ( wall ) mean [ ~ ~ something like a mound that runs lengthwise ~ ~ embankment ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/danewerk.jpg ) , trains are usually built upon them for example . 
  or they can be a rudimentary defence structure that is n't a wall but ( check picture ) * semester means a period of vacation * sj\u00f6 ( sea ) means lake * kaka ( cake ) means cookie * hall is the first room when you enter someones home but it also still have the same meaning as the english word . 
  i will add words as i think of more . 
  disclaimer : i 'm no etymology expert and it can be that both english and swedish got their words from a common place and split into different meanings , but the questions still stands . 
  ** edit : ** one of the strangest i find is * balle/ballarna * and i have to crack down on the inconsistent swedes . 
  balle means * dick * in swedish , but * ballarna * means the testicles while in danish balle is a buttcheek and ballarna more than one butt cheek , at least they 're consistent . 
  also , in sk\u00e5ne they use * balle/ballarna * as the danes , the correct way, 
  in sweden for the last 5-20 years there was a surge for old peoples names but it seems to have diminished looking at the top 100 list for new borns . 
  there are still a few names but now it seems that the trend is names with only one to two syllables . 
  disclaimer : it might be that i 'm at almost 40 do n't associate these names with old people . 
  i will mark the names with ( * ) with the names i associate to old people top 20 boys : * oscar * lucas * william * liam * oliver * hugo * alexander * elias * charlie * noah ( weird that it 's english spelling but then agaon , both oscar and lucas also ) * adam * ludvig * filip * adrian * axel * nils ( * ) * alfred * leo * vincent * elliot top 20 girls : * alice * lilly * maja * elsa ( * ) ( old womans name and is n't a surge because of frozen , has been popular for longer ) * ella * alicia * olivia * julia * ebba * wilma ( * ) * saga * agnes * freja * alma ( * ) * astrid ( * ) * ellie * molly * alva ( * ) * ellen * stella, 
  i believe the most typical one from sweden is [ gyllene tider - sommartider ] ( https://youtu.be/mdo6bzs6o-k ) ( summertimes ) from [ 1982 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sommartider ) with gyllene tider who 's fronted by per gessle ( who started roxette in 1986 ) . 
  it 's about leisures of the summer and summer flings . 
  per does n't remember it as a big hit at the time but has grown to be the most summery song here . 
  a contender must me [ tomas ledin - sommaren \u00e4r kort ] ( https://youtu.be/wlhy1weah8u ) ( summer is short ) but it does n't have same sing a long quality as sommartider . 
  several of tomas ledins songs were used by a shitty beer brand ( pripps bl\u00e5 ) so it 's often associated between the two . 
  in sweden we have a swedish mile ( * mil * , prounounced [ * meel * ] ( https://translate.google.se/#sv/en/mil ) click the speaker symbol ) which is exactly 10km , only one syllable instead of four . 
  it 's almost always used for anything longer than 19km in daily speech example : g\u00f6teborg to malm\u00f6 ( aproximately 290km ) often said as * trettio mil * ( thirty miles ) or possibly as twenty nine ** edit : clarification , that you use in everyday speech for distance over land ** edit 2 : i 'm sorry that expressed it like i was interested in larger units but i meant that i was more interested if there is an easier/shorter word than a four-syllable word that you use, 
  [ sj-sound ] ( https://sv.forvo.com/word/sju/#sv ) ( sju = seven ) is considered one of the hardest for non native speakers . 
  edit , because we have 7 + different similar sounds tongue twisters with those sounds are common like https://forvo.com/phrase/sju_sj\u00f6sjuka_sjuksk\u00f6terskor_sjunger/, 
  going with the language theme today . 
  ignorance intervju ( interview ) , many pronounce it * interjuv * and even journalists and reporters do this and they should be ashamed being their profession . 
  difficult v\u00e4stkustskt ( adjective to describe something particularly westcoasty ) . 
  the ending with * - stskt * makes it particularly difficult . 
  i ca n't pronounce it without sounding like i have a speech impediment, 
  for example in sweden : [ alexandra pascalidou ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexandra_pascalidou ) - romanian born by greek parents that is columnist , television hostess , author and now also editor of a major swedish newspaper * g\u00f6teborgsposten * [ dominika peczynski ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dominika_peczynski ) - polish born pr-consultant , started lovesearch.com ( nordens largest dating site at the time ) , singer in army of lovers and a bunch of other bands edit : clarification , persons that are pretty much unknown to the rest of the world ( excluding their country of origin ), 
  i know you 're out there , never making a squeak . 
  * let ~ ~ thy ~ ~ thee be known * !, 
  lets say that someone made a comedy show and your country declared war on another , what would it be thats still relatable ? 
  clarification : the show would be about the war and the reason ( not a show that provoke a war ), 
  i was googling for some prices on lasik in my home town and some ads for lasik in vilnius showed up . 
  i do n't usually go for ads but the price , around 400 $ per eye caught my eye since it 's about one fourth of the price here in sweden . 
  i know it 's seems unrelated but i have a friend with polish parents who go to poland for a dentist appointment to fix his teeth and he says it high quality dentist . 
  so i was wondering how good they are with lasik in the baltics . 
  i mean it 's your eyes and you really do n't want anything to go wrong or you maybe go blind or get worse eyesight . 
  i 'm really tired of my bad eyesight and been pondering lasik for years . 
  i could probably get a round trip flight for 100 $ and then lasik for 800 $ , couple of hotel nights for a few hundred more and a vacation in the baltics which i never been . 
  i have n't thought about it before because i do n't get annoyed . 
  i think it 's charming in a way but it helps that i know the atmosphere in / r/askeurope being very friendly and they 're probably just trying to explain something which became too difficult in a second language or an internal joke . 
  physical traits , fashion , mannerism .
