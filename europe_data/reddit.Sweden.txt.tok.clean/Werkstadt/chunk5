  i 'm on a sea food diet ... 
  i see food i eat it, 
  killing yourself is the number one thing you can do for the environment , the second best thing is not reproduce . 
  ** everything ** else is just a piss in the mississippi . 
  i do n't argue for people killing themselves but my ecological footprint conscience is clear , nothing i will do will impact the earth more than me not reproducing . 
   pan-european orgy in a different city every year . 
  like we need any more riots !, 
  thai . 
  preferably eaten in siam < 3, 
  so were clarkson and may, 
  i had that in the back of my mind but i couldnt pinpoint ut . 
  i drive a focus hatchback myself, 
  american cars except ford are not very common . 
  japanese cars , super common but volvo is without a doubt the most common . 
  no one is looking down at you because you do n't buy domestic . 
  possibly if you buy exotic american cars unless they are oldies, 
  doves and pigeon share name in swedish , we do n't differentiate , doves get an adjective ( white ) tied to it at times when it matter . 
   also clay shooting skeet *, 
  * menstr\u00e4sk ( menstruation swamp ) * kukkola ( it 's not prounced right but written it can also be cock-cola ) * pungpinan ( scrotum agony ) * porrarp ( porr = porn and arp is a common ending on places in most southern province ) * aplungs\u00e5sen ( can be either monkey lung sauce or monkey lungs rdige depending if the lung is singular or plural ) * muslickeberget ( mus = mouse , equalling pussy in english and when said rapidly it sounds like pussy licking mountain ), 
  * lunds lasarett * is what the main hospital in lund is named, 
  i 'm trying to write something without sounding like a douche but i believe you might 've gotten the wrong idea about norway ( or nordic ) . 
  they are all very modern countries but i think you 've bought into the idea watching picturesque photographs and videos of traditional living , it 's not like that, 
  [ this one ] ( https://www.google.se/maps/place/bouvet%c3%b6n/@-54.4207082,3.2896331,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0xb78334e1953bbe3f:0xb6a0b8d710feb84b!8m2!3d-54.423199!4d3.413194?hl=sv ), 
   i do n't know though what do you guys think of my crazy dream ? 
  yes , it 's not a way to support yourself and i can only assume that it 's like in sweden where you have to pay property taxes etc even if you 're not making money which is unlikely doing anything traditionally . 
   now i 'm pretty sure it 's tough to say that there are places that are completely primitive in the sense that people probably have cars , electricity etc. 
  unless there are still areas which are more traditional based which would be awesome !, 
  tbh it sounds like you bought into an fictional idea of what norway is looking at pictures/videos, 
  [ ... ] ( http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/clssfd.gif ), 
  then i do n't know what you mean by `` tied to americas '' i do n't know why you got downvoted either . 
  i am not cersei, 
  is norways passport really correct ? 
  https://www.passportindex.org/countries/no.png they misspelled norge the second time, 
  here 's a quick view of all the passports exterior https://www.passportindex.org/, 
  still waiting , huh ? 
  first time i fired a gun was almost ten , it was the swedish variant of the h&k g4 , the ak4 . 
  it was on a military range when the military showed the public what they do . 
  my 9 year old brother was doing his mandatory military service which is why we were present . 
  the second time was a magnum .44 and a magnum .357 which were black powder manually loaded . 
  i think i was 13 or 14 at the time . 
  my brothers girlfriends father was the owner of the guns . 
  after that i 've shot shotguns at skeet shooting at my friends farm . 
  we 've done that a couple of times as a social thing . 
  same friend i 've shot .22 caliber pistol for range shooting . 
  we 've disposed of hard drives the right way , by shooting them to pieces so that no data can be extracted from discarded drives . 
  we also shot 9mm , shotguns and a hunting rifle ( unsure of caliber ) . 
  i do n't have a real interest in shooting but it 's more of the availability and the novelty of doing it . 
  i have however thought about starting to shoot the bow , the range is just a kilometer away and it 's possible that i will be able to use the skill in my line of work, 
  it depends on what kind of corruption you 're talking about . 
  the kind where you pay off police or other officials not so much . 
  however favouritism between officials and companies that are getting hired by officials can get personal services . 
  common is that some builder get a contract for the city but the official that chose that building company might get * free * bricks or lumber to use on their own property something that came up just this week was that in gothenburg the company that services the municipals cars also serviced private cars owned by people employed by the city , and their friends/siblings/sister-in-law / etc even for free or way under market cost . 
  that kind of corruption is prevalent , especially in gothenburg it seems and the news has been exposing it for the last decade but i 'm sure there is much much more to it . 
   r/mapporn dude , this is a sfw post !, 
   / r/sweatypalms - can confirm , does actually give me sweaty palms [ nope , nuh-uh ] ( http://i.imgur.com/t8iwuhb.gif ), 
  i assume op means former eastern bloc, 
  you mean like famous one ? 
  just like the rest of us . 
  i hope at least, 
  mom had omtwo , dad had one , i 'm having zero . 
  i hate using the word * r\u00f6v * . 
  * rumpa * is better, 
  wait what ? 
  * m\u00e5s * is butt in danish ? 
  you mean like borrow 300 $ via sms and you get the money within minutes on your account ? 
  aw yiss . 
  they focus on poor and people with bad economic skills . 
  the interest is horrible , i think something like 35 % per year and many get stuck in a never ending loop where you have to take another loan to pay back the first one . 
  i do n't know anyone personally that this has happened to ( or they are too ashamed to say ), 
  but i thought jd drank appletinis, 
  appletini !, 
  same here . 
  i do n't want the responsibility it entailes to own a gun and i do n't want that extra risk of getting burglarized becuase i own weapons and so on . 
  also a perk is not being interviewed by police if something happened and you 're in a list of gun owners, 
  snapsid\u00e9 , i like it, 
  to get something that fits a whole family with packing you have to get such a huge pickup you ca n't fit them anywhere . 
  parking spaces are bust and to get around town is n't a grid with streets . 
  to get something that 's pretrial to drive around you have to get a smaller one and then you ca n't fit the whole family comfortably, 
  not many pickup trucks here because most people/families ( and if they do it 's often a compact just to get around ) do n't own more than one car and a pickup truck is not * versatile * enough for a family . 
  they have one car and the most common ones are volvo v70 and the like ( do you call them estates ? 
  ) , often with a towbar ( ? ), 
  and a trailer , often a rental . 
  just like some non-scandinavian people * subjectively * include finland in scandinavia which it * objectively * is not , it does n't hurt to solidify the answer with * commonwealth no * if op had n't mentioned commonwealth i would n't have either . 
  yes . 
  * korpen * ( the raven ) is an association for promotion of keeping active . 
  many sports have leagues in * korpen * . 
  like football i think 7-man teams ( not sure if there are 11-man teams ) that play a season against eachother . 
  it 's very local . 
  which posts equate the two . 
  point to where in my answer i did that . 
  i 'm sure that even in the commonwealth and the anglosphere that yes and no are opposites, 
  anglosphere yes commonwealth no, 
  no the `` not showing kids '' is not part of it here . 
  perfectly natural for children to see topless women and even nude people . 
  is it ? 
  we have more than twice the population the the us and wikipedia [ lists 25 school shootings in europe since 1913 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/school_shooting#europe ) ( some without any casualties ) wikipedia also lists an entire page just for school shootings in the us and it 's extensive https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_school_shootings_in_the_united_states . 
  i did n't count them but it seems to be hundreds of them , maybe even 500 + . 
  just in 2000-2009 there was over 60 school shootings according to that list is population still not relevant ? 
  or people without a drivers licence ? 
  which is a lot of people,
