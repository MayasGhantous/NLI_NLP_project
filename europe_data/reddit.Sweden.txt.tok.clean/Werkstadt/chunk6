  europe has a population of 740 + millions . 
  and * here * is where ? 
  flair up, 
  finland had a school shooter just a few years ago iirc ? 
  i 'm not interested on what americans have to say about it , i 'm looking for e\u00e4a european perspective, 
  i have a vpn server at home so that when i connect abroad i can always circumvent blocks and if i connect at public hotspots i still have encryption . 
  [ l\u00e5t den r\u00e4tte komma in ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1139797 ) ( let the right one in ) i ca n't see why bergman is so great . 
  and i 'm super critical towards swedish film . 
  not sweden , wo n't get much gig that kind of cash and tenents have way too much rights for your liking and neither condos or rentals are allowed to rent to a second tenents fit more than a year . 
  ( you do n't own a condo , you buy into an * association * which give you the right to live there . 
  the association owns the house ) only thing you can really buy for that cash and rent to someone is a * super cheap * house in hicksville, 
  [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lqiyq9k.jpg ) is similar to where i live now . 
  i moved 7 times before i turned 18 so not much use in showing . 
  lived in a house , rental , condo all before 18 . 
  is that american ?

   i 'm only saying leg because some do n't shave their thighs as the hairs are so bright and small that they are too lazy also , the stubble is way worse than a little fuzz , especially on the inside of the thighs where it scratches the other thigh . 
  same as washing clothes and dishes in cold water , right ? 
  theres more to it than bacteria . 
  kind of like spotify and skype ? 
  ebonics ? 
  no , washing hands should not be done in cold water , wtf, 
  i promise i will only look at it once ... it was hilarious, 
  somebody * needs * to put english subtitles on that , it looks hilarious, 
  had a much younger guy in my class a while back who had the same bj\u00f6rn borg underpants every single day sticking up above the edge of his pants . 
  thought it was a little bit unsanitary until i realized he has another pair of underpants underneath his bj\u00f6rn borg ones . 
  what a moron, 
  i learned all my german from * the rock * ( 1996 ) * sie haben meine humvee gestohlen *, 
   a few weeks of scots . 
  so you pretty much got out scot-free ? 
  did you read the question . 
  i 'm turning forty this year and for the past ten years or so my eyesight have n't changed . 
  from the time i started using glasses/contacts my eyesight have changed from -2.25 to -3.75, 
  but from what i read that 's just temporary, 
  what made you decide not to have it done ? 
  not haarlem in new amsterdam . 
  impossible to get someone to help you with directions ( pre smartphone era ) . 
  never experienced that anywhere else . 
  numbers from 2008 * football ( 500.000 ) * floorball ( 309.000 ) * golf ( 273.000 ), 
  what kind of popular ? 
  most watched ? 
  most practioners ? 
  highest revenue ? 
  i consider them [ nations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nation ) country and nation is n't interchangeable . 
  a nation can exist within a country . 
  i just checked skyscanner and wizz flies directly to vno . 
  just checked some prices and can get round trip for 35 euros . 
   thank you for your input . 
  i love this subreddit, 
   eyes.lt however . 
  they 're boasting with 400.000 satisfied customers and that they have done that for 15 years . 
  that does n't really sound completely truthful, 
   i also know that one clinic ( naujas regejimas - eyes.lt ) in vilnius is supposed to be really good , perhaps it 's the one you found . 
  it was exactly that one i found . 
  i had n't even thought about going abroad to do it until i saw that ad . 
  i think i 'd probably be more interested in a high quality one in baltics than a medicore one in sweden . 
  20k sek seems a bit on the cheap side for sweden . 
  you 're answer was thorough and awesome . 
  thank you so much for that . 
  i recommend this https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/6jn7kg/do_you_have_any_other_shorter_word_for_longer/, 
  i do n't think i 've ever seen that . 
  here 's it 's * 95 octane ( unleaded * standard * petrol ) * diesel * 97 octane is still sold at some stations * e85, 
  what 's wrong with the first one ? 
  probably not the most successful one but my money is that [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w10wrig4orc ) one is the most memorable . 
  both because the guy expresses himself in a way that it 's easily recognizable when you mimic him but also because it 's something we all wanted to do to our employer . 
  the story is that a boss has called an employee into his office to notify him that he needs to work the whole weekend for something to be done by monday morning and the employee starts to mimic the boss like a retard while the boss gets more and more upset . 
  it 's a comercial for the most known scratcher lottery in sweden . 
  it 's implied that the employee have won a lot of money and do n't care that he might get fired . 
  edit : * du har ju hela helgen p\u00e5 dig * ( but you have the whole weekend ) have become a quote people still use mockingly when someone says they do n't have time, 
  either , you have the force to defend yourself ** or ** you 're in an alliance ** or ** you get occupied on walk-over the whole point of being neutral is that you need to keep a big enough force by yourself . 
  having an in house weapon production is also important if you 're neutral because if the conflict gets really big , you 're not prioritized over allied forced to get arms delivered to you . 
  also , if other countries say they 're neutral and then sell you weapons , they 're not neutral . 
  i think it 's really weird question, 
  post world war * we were not ready for ww2, 
  yea , during the [ 50s and 60 's ] ( http://imgur.com/gallery/eh6b6 ), 
  i think op needs to check up what the definition of a moped, 
  regular scooters are 125cc and can go in excess of , 100kmh , mopeds are 50cc, 
  you sound entitled ... try the search bar, 
  it 's 18 to buy alcohol in bars and other serving places . 
  it 's 20 to buy alcohol above 3.5 % in * systembolaget * , a state owned chain if stores . 
  only open monday to friday until 18:00 or 19:00 and saturdays to 14:00 . 
  they have a superior stock of brands etc. 
  i prefer it this way . 
  mainly sandbox games like kerbal space program and factorio ( highly recommend the latter ) and some sporadic gaming on other games , lately ghost recon wildlands but only in coop mode with friends, 
  wait what ? 
  since when does all sovereign nations in the eu relent the foreign policy to eu ? 
  and there are a bunch of nations not using the euro, 
  just because you 're one step behind finland in so many surveys ? 
  that would be hilarious, 
  i would say that norway would be much funnier since you have a tiny border tand not really any real squabble . 
  could be to get that mountain peak people wanted to norway to donate to finland . 
  some general decides to go in and take at anyway . 
  norway will have none of that, 
  i feel a new british comedy show , premieres spring 2018, 
  yes, 
  * triggered *, 
  but is n't that pick and choose ? 
  most of americans are probably a massive mix up ? 
  `` oh i 'm one quarter/eight swedish so i 'll emphasize that part of my ancestry '',
