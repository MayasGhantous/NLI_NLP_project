  expect 4-5h for a game, 
   is it really ? 
  referencing to what ? 
  battlestar galactica ? 
  i will never turn down a game of bsg . 
  i 've easily have over a 100 games played already  my favorite is the resistance : avalon . 
  love that game . 
  resistance is like a very light version of battlestar galactica . 
  germany is a huge market for board games . 
  every year in essen they have the biggest gathering of boargame makers , fans , etc. 
  euro-games are more focused on being well balanced and not rely on chance so much as american games . 
  most games probably have an english translation online ( boardgamegeek.com ) if there is n't one already included in the game . 
  180 / km ^ 2 wow , [ most of swedens municipals ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/sverigesfolkt%c3%a4thetkommunvis2007.svg/467px-sverigesfolkt%c3%a4thetkommunvis2007.svg.png ) does n't come close to that, 
  i 'm a huge board game nerd . 
  i would n't say that board games are popular in the mainstream and if mainstream people play it 's almost always trivial pursuit or monopoly , both of which are cringeworthy to a board gamer . 
  however . 
  board games have become * fringe-mainstream * and if offered they like to tag along . 
  probably settlers of catan is the most played . 
  my favourite game is battlestar galactica, 
  wait , what ? 
  is nl scarcely populated anywhere ? 
  i was n't aware of this . 
  i general i think swedes sees sea people in a positive light . 
  i 'd love to here your experiences, 
  you still have the zloty ? 
   because on one would ever think to paint a real gun a bright colour and pass it off as a toy [ ninja ] ( http://vipfanauctions.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ninjayellow.jpg ) :p, 
  maybe it 's a definition of blonde that 's different . 
  i know many celebrities that are called blonde over there and it would not be defined as blonde here . 
  being a natural blonde with brown eyes, 
  stavanger dialekt is best dialekt < 3, 
  please , please , please let western norway be stavanger < 3, 
  [ do n't worry about it ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ov9ke37.gif ), 
  iirc 36500 sek/month . 
  overshooting gets taxed additional 20 %, 
  most women are n't blonde , the average height of females in sweden is 164cm and for women between 18-30 it 's 167cm . 
  however , what 's blonde in other countries are n't considered blonde here . 
  there is a higher percentage of blondes in scandinavia than most other places . 
  i 'm blond and i 'm not superinto blonde women ** unless ** they have brown eyes which pretty much never happens naturally . 
  my knees get weak when i see a browneyed blonde woman, 
  takes issue with what ? 
   ( also it would be `` let thee be known '' , but i 'm just a sad nitpicker ) dra \u00e5t helvete , j\u00e4vla j\u00e4nkare, 
  i know what he said , but i do n't think he means it . 
  i think it 's a case of the * grass is greener * . 
  most of us are n't agreeing with what our taxes go to . 
  ( even though i believe that usa is super corrupt nation and that it 's citizens are getting screwed over by * law degrees * and big corporations and i 'm not even left leaning in my political views ), 
  my mom has a bush of `` american blueberries '' [ this ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_pazi9rnyhhc/tfmrftwsuri/aaaaaaaab_e/cojhq0uohxa/s1600/017.jpg ) is how indigenous blueberries grow in sweden . 
  ca n't find them ? 
  they 're right [ there ] ( https://c7.staticflickr.com/8/7521/28272926414_23cc94d888_h.jpg ) they rarely grow above your knees . 
  but the forest are filled with them and thanks to * allemansr\u00e4tten * you can forage on anyone 's land . 
  yellowstone ? 
  the part that matters of russia is in europe so i agree with you . 
  turkey is a little different premise but nontheless . 
  part of europe but not in the same extent as russia, 
  death valley , mount rushmore ( can you consider that `` natural feature '' ) , florida keys , the great lakes . 
  also already mentioned but i 'm sure niagara falls and grand canyon is up there too edit : possibly the redwood forest, 
  * whispers * : serbia just said that they 're ok with us bombing romania . 
  just pointing it out, 
  sounds like you hate taxes , doubt you 'll enjoy the taxes in nordic countries . 
  65 % * tax * is the norm for non-high-salary people . 
  edit : * employers fee : 31,42 % ( 2017 ) * tax on salary : 30 % and up * vat is usually 25 % all that adds up to around 65 % total ( there are some exempts on what you pay vat on and like food is 12 % ), 
  when people try to break the queue we get passive aggressive . 
  but i 've started confronting them in an unswedish way when that happens . 
  you wrote hundred square centimeters , not hundred square meters :p, 
  how about your neighbours ? 
  i 'm very fond of pyrenees dogs . 
  how common are they in actual pyrenees ? 
  snow does n't burn that rapidly, 
  oh you know [ here and there ] ( http://i.imgur.com/itsre3f.png ), 
   about ( 100cm2 ) holy crap , i know germans are efficient and pragmatic but wow . 
  i live alone in 43m \u00b2 two rooms and a kitchenette , dirt cheap rent not in the ghetto pretty centrally in gothenburg . 
  i do n't mind living in such a * small * apartment since my primary interests are travelling and hobbies that do n't take much room . 
  no kids and if it 's up to me i wo n't reproduce last place i lived was with friends , 4 of us in a six-room apartment 130m \u00b2 downtown gothenburg, 
  i 've never seen an epidemic but a friend in sm\u00e5land was driving home in the dark and just 200m from his home ( a farm ) he saw something lumbering but he could n't make out what it was and his first thought was that one of their mini shetlands had escaped . 
  yep that 's how big they can get . 
  [ har du koskr\u00e4ck ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wkcf4rchl0&amp;t=1m49s ), 
  there has n't been a lethal ( human ) wolf attack in 200 years and iirc no leta bear attack in a 100 years . 
  yes they are dangerous but ... 
  there is practically a boar epidemic in sk\u00e5ne, 
  i can of course not speak for every single ancestor since they start to become quite many the further back you go . 
  like i have two parents , my parents had four , and theirs had eight and so on . 
  but we have traced as far back as late 1600s but that was 30 + years ago . 
  maybe be able to teach further back on my father 's side now, 
   enjoyable activity for a couple of hours a couple of times a week not what i meant though . 
  i meant hobbies makes you meet people that 'll be your friends . 
   i find that the strength of friendship with work colleagues is directly proportional to my overall happiness . 
  not in my world , quite the opposite . 
  colleagues sucks as friends, 
  if you do n't have hobbies i suppose, 
  you ... 
  i like you !, 
  send me your cv and i 'll see what i can do , trust me , i know what i 'm doing, 
  my time is my time , if i do n't get paid , i 'm not working . 
  has nothing to do with introvertism . 
  i do n't live to work , i work to live, 
  i 'm sorry , i do n't know what that mean, 
  i 've had colleagues try to friend me on fb and i explained to them when i met them at work that they should n't feel bad about it but i want to keep my fb private and only for close and/or old friends . 
  the ones i explained it to at least gave the impression that they understood i want to be able to post on facebook whatever i feel like without having any regard except my real friends . 
  and colleagues ( in general ) are some of the gossipy people there is , since they meet every day it 's fairly common that they will talk about stuff on their and i do n't want that . 
   i hate work social events , but i am forced to attend . 
  i just hate it .
