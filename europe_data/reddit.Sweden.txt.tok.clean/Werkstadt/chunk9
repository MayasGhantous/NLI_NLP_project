  maybe you just need colder more * spacious * climate ? 
  i do n't . 
  i think it 's common that people at least hang out with one colleague outside of work . 
  i have a strict policy not to mix my professional life with my private . 
  no facebook friending . 
  in one year i 've been to one afterwork . 
  i do n't enjoy swedish films , taking away grants from them would make them useless . 
  so a huge * yes * from me , i would mind, 
  i did not know that , whenever i 've talked to people from the usa and the topic of sick days come up they just told me they have two weeks and then left it at that . 
  do all employers have to pay two weeks of sick pay by law ? 
   ground earth berries . 
  a little bit redundant ? 
  one of the best [ child hood memories ] ( http://static.beta.pixgallery.com/images/detail/y/1/v/pix-y1vfmu.jpg ), 
  that 's interesting . 
  we call them jordgubbar which translate to * earth ... old-men *, 
  what does it translate to ? 
  i live * in * the city and i have * smultron * on a busy road 400m from me . 
  i would n't dare touch them though because dogs ... 
  wait , 6h ? 
  is that including lunch break ? 
  oh , and americans often only have up to two weeks of sick leave , like being sick is something you can control how long you will be . 
  when you get sick you , you first day is unpaid and after that it 's 80 % for the first two weeks that you 're sick your employer pays ( iirc ) , after those two weeks the state pays for how long you 're sick . 
  -- i work 40h a week . 
  7:00 to 16:00 with 1h break spread over the workday, 
  not for long term , it was not specifically what you asked for . 
  airbnb, 
  it 's a boardgame from the seventies civilization and expanded with advanced civilization . 
  takes a whole day to play unless you use a timer but i have played sid meirs civilization since the first one, 
  we have something like ideal , not sure how well used it is . 
  i pretty much never use it . 
  if it 's possible i prefer to use paypal instead of giving out a debit card number . 
  between persons we have something called swish where you just swish money to a mate or so ( some companies use it too but it 's rare ) you use an app on your phone in conjunction with a statebacked online id called bankid which you use for a lot of different things to prove that you are you . 
  even when talking on the phone with some companies they can send out a bankid request which you confirm while talking . 
  super smooth, 
  in the original civilization i prefer to play egypt . 
  no , not sid meirs civilization , i said the original one :p, 
  oh the one with hiccups we also have . 
  thought that was typically scandinavian, 
  i have a hard time filtering out sounds from noise in general so listening to dialogue if there is any other sounds is dead . 
  i never cared for lyrics in songs either because i could never hear what they sing until i found singer songwriters i liked . 
  if you want to be impressed by swedish subtitles . 
  watch * bitch slap * that translator should get a raise . 
  shitty movie but the translation is 11/10, 
  i want english subtitles because i do n't want an interpretation of what 's said , i want it exactly as it 's said and when a lot is going on it 's hard to hear what they 're saying . 
  the amount of humans are absolutely non relevant to the questions . 
  it does not matter for my argument . 
  there can be a 100 billion or ten people . 
  it 's absolutely irrelevant . 
  it does n't matter if it 's objectively better . 
  it 's also irrelevant for my argument all of your arguments are irrelevant to my statement . 
  -- if i believe the world is shittier now than ever i can make the statement `` i do n't want to bring kids to this shitty world '' it does ** not ** matter if the world actually is a better place or not , i can still use that as a reason to why i do n't want to bring kids into this world . 
  now . 
  if a 100.000 couple made that statement 25 years ago and if 500.000 couples make that statement today ( still , irrelevant if the world is a better place or not ) ** that particular ** reason has never been more popular . 
  ( again irrelevant if the world ** is ** a better place or not , people can still use that reason to not make kids ) and i can with 100 % confidence say that more people than before use that reason to not have kids . 
  wow , you 're just not reading it right . 
  i ** did n't ** say that the main reason people are n't getting kids . 
  i said that the ** reason ** `` i do n't want to bring kids into this shitty world '' has never had more support . 
  example : if 10 % who do n't want kids say `` i do n't want to bring kids into this shitty world '' twenty years ago and today it 's 25 % who do n't want kids say `` i do n't want to bring kids into this shitty world '' that means that particular reason has never had more support and i can with confidence say that that reason was much less used years ago than today, 
  yet the reason `` i do n't want to bring kids into this shitty world '' has never been more popular than it is now . 
  i doubt tangible things are what attracts . 
  ( and if it is , it 's probably the wrong kind of people who are attracted by this ) . 
  what we need is `` a better world '' so that you do n't bring new beings into a shitty world . 
  if the education system makes a 180 and becomes super awesome and a good place for every kid is a first step . 
  i do n't refer to the people as * kontinentaler * ( continentals ) but i do say * nere p\u00e5 kontinenten * ( down on the continent ) when i 'm talking about the rest of europe ( obviously excluding britain , ireland , iceland , norway and in some regard finland . 
  when i grew up the only way to the rest of europe was by boat . 
  going through the eastern bloc ( ussr etc ) was never an option . 
  i assume this is the kind of * conflict * that technically we 're part of the continent just as technically everyone from north and south america are americans, 
  hold on , packing my bags ... 
  but is n't there snow because of altitude rather than season ? 
  and probably more support towards nationalism in each republic . 
  ( at least for the first few decades ), 
  oh so it 's just to gain support from outsiders against neighbours you 're super friendly ? 
  i can understand that . 
  we play/played a lot of board games so the word * f\u00e4rst * was very usuable talking about mechanics and rules . 
  and also during play, 
  let 's start !, 
  i 'm trying to make * f\u00e4rst * happen and some people i know have adopted it, 
  i think you 're translating * outside * wrong, 
  i 'll give you a pass because english is n't your first language . 
  wait what ? 
  the more unintelligibly you speak the more * high-assed * you sound ? 
  i live in far south sweden and we got slushy snow the last of april ( three years ago we had snow in may . 
  march is not a good month to go in , it can be freezing far south as crete try out / r/travel and / r/backpacking for questions too, 
  in sweden three seasons can meteorologically be at the same time winter in the north , spring/autumn in the middle and summer in the south, 
  hmm . 
  it seems that most people here ( at least at the time i 'm writing this ) translates negro ( or similiar ) to nigger which is far more deregatory than negro is or am i 'm presuming wrong ? 
  most doors in swedish homes are lockable but only with a key or similar . 
  makes no difference on what side of door except toilets or bathrooms, 
  that 's the backside of sweden . 
  bohusl\u00e4ns archipelago is on the front , 
  8/10 , i get pretty stoked when someone wants to know stuff . 
  since i consider myself fairly knowledgeable, 
  the only massage places i see that is n't like real spas are thai massage parlors . 
  i have no idea if they are 100 % kosher or you 'll get asked to be happy when you 're done . 
  if it 's anything like the massage parlors in actual thailand there 's a lot of offers . 
  you wo n't get an hour for 60 $ afaik . 
  different story in thailand though where you get a full hour for 8 $, 
  i knew those fuckers were fuckers !, 
  i read an article about a swedish woman who was going to bali . 
  her passport ^ ^ 1 got stolen one week before she left so she had to get one of those pink temporary passport .
