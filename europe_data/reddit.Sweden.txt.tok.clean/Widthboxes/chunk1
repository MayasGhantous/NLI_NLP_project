  apparently it has , yes , but that is not to thank for sweden 's sovereignty , 
  also the day for the institution of the [ instrument of goverment ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/instrument_of_government_\\ ( 1809 \\ ) ) in 1809 . 
  sweden got it 's national day at the 6th of june but there 's nearly none celibrating it , however midsummer 's eve is consider as a folk festival and nearly everyone celibrates it ( occurs on the friday between 19th and 25th , apparently on the same day as [ st john 's eve ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_the_baptist ) , midsummers day is the saturday between 19th and 25th also this is the [ birth of gospel of luke ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gospel_of_luke ) ) . 
  you 've heard of ericsson ? 
  40 % of the market in wireless networking , innovator of the 4g system and other companies like spotify ( first on the market !, 
  ) , saab arms dealer recently bought kockums ( submarine company , earlier owned by swedish defence force , outsourced to some german company . ), 
  , \u00c5ngpannef\u00f6reningen top-of-the-notch consultants ( civil engineers ) , many game studios ( dice sadly owned by ea ) . 
  finland is already dumping their prices on cheese , milk and so on . 
  and people stacks in on the cheese , we are sadly going to some bad economic crisis if the markets on hardware , like cars , networks and other things stalls to . 
  you have no idea how biased it is in sweden . 
  if you believe in individuality , then you are counted as a retarded moron . 
  likewise , if you want to debate immigration on any other planet than `` no borders '' . 
  well , even if you 're drunk , we are making some fine ales in sweden too , 
  are you a drunk danish feminist ? 
  sweden , well they assume it is awesome . 
  and it is sometimes , but the country full of leftwing activists claiming `` feminism '' is the solution to everything , when everybody knows alcohol is  sweden do have a lot social problems that is n't worth to mention because then you 're either `` rascist ! '', 
  or a `` womenhater ! '' . 
  and if the media recognizes this they you 're shut out from every friendly social event . 
  one month left to vote for riksdagen and whom which parties will claim the regeringen and swedens pm . 
  may be a discussion about the immigrants . 
  either way , sverigedemokraterna will sadly come strong from this elections too . 
  whoops , just went for 8 million city , my bad !, 
  here is the right one !, 
  [ english scandinavian 8 million city !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh9x7tilrvs ), 
  you better believe in it  [ the scandinavian 8 million city ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh9x7tilrvs ), 
  hello , you can make a possible connection between gothenburg - stockholm ( / g\u00f6teborg - stockholm ) . 
  it 's being planned to be in use by 2025  oslo - g\u00f6teborg - malm\u00f6 - copenhagen plausible in 2023 , 
  when saab went bankrupted in 2012 they also missed out on the yearly deliverance to the rikspolisstyrelsen , then rikspolisstyrelsen needed a matching car , and volkswagen won . 
  i think that one of the reasons you maybe have missed it because i think that they are delivering the new cars to smaller towns , so the old versions can take the most damage in the populated citys with more sabotage etc. 
  swedens most common is : volvo [ v70 ] ( http://utryckningsfordon.se/wopre/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/polis_volvo_v70_-2012_-pn.jpg ) / [ xc70 ] ( http://utryckningsfordon.se/wopre/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/polis_volvo_xc70_-2011_ja-430x286.jpg ) , volkswagen passat [ variant ] ( http://utryckningsfordon.se/wopre/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/polis_vw_passat_-2010_pf-430x283.jpg ) / [ alltrack ] ( http://utryckningsfordon.se/wopre/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/polis_vw_passat_alltrack_-2012_ds-430x286.jpg ) , mercedes [ e350 ] ( http://utryckningsfordon.se/wopre/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/polis_m-b_e350_-2011_sa-430x286.jpg ) other : bmw mc 's , vw caravelle/multivan , mb sprinter, 
   what ? 
  the basis of swedish democracy is stuff like `` arbetarrr\u00f6relsen '' , kvinnlig r\u00f6str\u00e4tt mmetc . 
  wtf are you talking about ? 
  the same principle applies to companies `` those who makes/generates power , shall not deliver it , those who deliver it , shall not sell it and those who sells it , shall not make it . '', 
  it 's the same principle , applied to every god damn institution or company acting within the swedish borders . 
  that 's the basic of democracy in sweden while applied to each field . 
    i did n't !, 
  i am not old enough , and even if i were , i 'd voted no , and at least , i , unlike you , are trying to change things . 
  why are n't you ? 
   i , unlike you , are acting within the range of what is possible to make . 
  and who are you to procrastinate about me and my definition of how long time is ( or the closest to measure time is [ \u03c4 \\ ( tau \\ ) ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/tidskonstant ) ) , when you apparently are in the same generation as me . 
  i doubt it , that you can relate to the low costs made in the early 90 's ( which is a fact because you could n't vote in ' 94 ) . 
       that is the worst excuse i have ever heard . 
  serioiusly , grow up . 
  with every single one of your answer you just prove that you have no clue what you are talking about . 
  that is not how competitive , energy or security policy is made . 
  that is why one has `` energiuppg\u00f6relse '' and deals . 
  with your `` explanation '' or attempt to explain that means , that every fourth year , we and every other single democracy , would change the policy about everything . 
  well , guess what , that does n't happen . 
  there is absolutely no reason , none , for s and m not to make a grand bargain , and the fact that you are attempting to claim your ignorance on that it is just a four year stretch . 
  one does neither build an nuclear , or repair your precious dam on four year budgets , and you dam well know it . 
  so again , you are extremely out of touch with politics , and with energy politics . 
  when you think competitive , all you can see is the closed nuclear power plant in barseb\u00e4ck , and the 1 or 2 generator at oskarshamn , forsmark and ringhals , which intervals of services , would determine that they are out of juice to deliver on those cores . 
  what sweden and the nordic countries really need is to expand on efficiency on their current generators . 
  sweden needs to go forward on the big front , like we have done , we do n't want to stand their bare-handed when uranium or some other particles is out of reach for us ( look at waste , importing from norway in some cities ) a country can make a total different turn in 4 years time ( depending on a change of pm ) . 
  just look at the 4 years ( ' 06 - ' 10 ) were it has made a lot changes ( , not all for the good but they did at least save sweden with immigration ( with all what its worth with more housing and other things ) around the crisis of 2008 ) . 
    are you afraid , or ca n't you answer them ? 
  i am sure of that i 'm answering your questions and you keep on harassing me . 
   when you do n't know about prices , denmark or the eu , you try to save yourself by talking about coal , and oil - not really relevant are they ? 
  no , i was introducing you to more fact because i thought that you was n't well informed . 
  i am currently studying energy technologies , so i am well informed on the pro 's of different power suppliers and with the environmental consequences of those suppliers . 
    because things are so brilliant in the greece , spain and italy now ? 
  have you even started to understand the disaster that is the euro ? 
  well , you did certainly translate/understand that answer wrong . 
  i vote for eu , for what 's best and for what i think is good for sweden and the relation to eu and where it shall go . 
  on the same principle does italians , greeks , londoners , belgians , germans . 
  i know you are well-aware of why allied forces sat down with germany after the ww2 to initiate business . 
    explain to me then in detail , how you are going to make sure that corrupt countries in the eu are going to stop being corrupt and make sure that the transfers work ? 
  i am dying to hear , because i have studies ( here for example that says that the structural funds are ineffective . 
  yet you claim , that you can change the energy policy in the eu . 
  well , i do not have a solution for the problem with corruption , neither does you . 
  because that 's one of the reasons why you want to leave eu , it 's easier not to look on the problem . 
      ok , prove it . 
  i 'd like for you to post academic studies that prove that it will happen , through the eu . 
  in detail . 
  because , if the eu helps against co2 emissions , why did germany choose coal instead of nuclear ? 
  wtf is greece up to for example , they have been in the eu since 1981 ? 
  well , shutting down their nuclear instead of coal is not the brightest moment . 
  but !, 
  i would like to present to you if you are unaware of the [ 20-20-20 deal !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_climate_and_energy_package ) well , i ca n't defend actions taken years before i was born , the same way as you can not relate to the prices from the early 90 's . 
  this is an easy way out but i ca n't defend why the initiated countries around the mediterranean area before , just for an example , sweden . 
  i ca n't for the love of god !, 
  ( smashing keys ! ), 
  sweden is an net-payer of eu , just the same way as new york state is an net-payer for some redneck area in usa . 
  it 's the way it got to be so that areas do n't get uncivilised and we could still use the areas for further profits in the future . 
  sweden is built on the same principle . 
  i dont have time to answer this , i wo n't answer your incoming message because it takes to much time , time i 'm willing to put to other things . 
  you 're out of the picture , 4 years is a riksdagens turn in office , 3 years is the maximum a company can stretch for roi . 
  4 years is a long time . 
  you 're arguing from the point of view which is not realistic , not from the decisions that are made and in rule . 
  eu is a good way to get to eastern countries to act towards for renewable energy . 
  we will not have an sustainable future without eu because some countries would like to run on fossil fuels as long as possible . 
  eu is on the point of no return , thanks to you and all other people in your age . 
  ( i hold every citizen that voted ( or not voted , not those that could n't ) in 1994 riksdagsval , accountable for the entering of eu ! ), 
  read on why we got nord pool , its lays in the basics of the swedish democracy .
