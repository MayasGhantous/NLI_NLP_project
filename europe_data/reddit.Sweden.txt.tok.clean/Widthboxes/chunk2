  and it 's more of a coincidence we started nord pool ' 96 ( and all other city-owned electricity companies ) and joined eu ' 95 . 
  i vote for eu the same way as italians , greeks and spaniards are doing , for there own good . 
  well this could be awkward . 
  i 'm currently studying , in sweden , energy technologies with power electronics/technologies . 
    the prices are the in their lowest in years ,   what on earth are you referring to ? 
  take a look at this . 
  cheapest in year - what about the 90 's ? 
  i was born 1990 i can not say something about that period , but you are looking at the 2010 and forward , which will make it cheapest in years . 
  you cant compare prices , that is 20 years old , straight of without recalculating for the worth of todays money . 
    but if you should follow the decisions made by the riksdagen , we need to lower our energy consumption from fossil fuels and increase our use from renewable energy . 
  a higher price/kwh should motivate a move for more efficient use of electricity  what ? 
  most of our electricity is from nuclear , hydro , bio or wind ? 
  you are confusing petrol with electricity ? 
  how can driving less make our electricity cheaper . 
  after we lifted the co2-taxes from power producers , sweden is returning to the use of more and more coal in heat power plants . 
    we did re-divide them for the sole purpose of semi-automatic construktion of power-producers , that the region that use the most electricity vs produced mwh has the highest prices -  which will in the end , generate more power producers in that specific region . 
   wrong again !, 
  we had to re-divide them because of the danes !, 
  and the danes made the electicity more expensive . 
  well that 's just * ridiculous * , but i could 've seen that one coming through lobbying also , but not for that reason . 
    the only thing that 's keeping the electricity prices from going up is the old hydro-power-plants sweden got upnorth , delivering 48 % of the total electricity last year , or 2012 . 
  otherwise we would stand here with the same prices as germany already . 
  but the eu ( ruled by germany ) wants the `` free '' power generated up here in the north so they have decided that we should sell it cheap to them . 
  which is also a self-sanitation , just like the different energy areas in the nordic countries  yes , which is a ) why we should quit nordpol b ) quit the eu c ) tell the eu to stay the fuck away from energy . 
  d ) build more nuclear . 
  e ) stop selling to the danes . 
  it 's old !, 
  it wo n't hold forever !, 
  the damage they can make if they break , i ca n't even imagine it !, 
  the construction of the dam 's is just huge , but the nature will take it back . 
  a ) let 's start our own nasdaq division !, 
  b ) stay in the eu -  start an nordic union/scandinavian union !, 
  c ) well , i want a future to live in so , no . 
  d ) no , possibly exchange the current ones , or start barseb\u00e4ck again . 
  e ) keep selling to them , just do n't listen to them . 
  the prices are the in their lowest in years , personally its the cheaper the better . 
  but if you should follow the decisions made by the riksdagen , we need to lower our energy consumption from fossil fuels and increase our use from renewable energy .

  sweden is a country which is dependent on export , so yes on cheap , but not necessary produced for us . 
  the only thing that 's keeping the electricity prices from going up is the old hydro-power-plants sweden got upnorth , delivering 48 % of the total electricity last year , or 2012 .

  which is also a self-sanitation , just like the different energy areas in the nordic countries . 
  have you totally missed that the norwegians are putting down a cable directly to north-west of germany to sell for more ? 
  and we in sweden need to motivate our saving of power / / motivate more efficient ways to take care of electricity . 
  and the whole reason for the cable is so that nord pool spot ( elb\u00f6rsen i oslo ) , just like any other company , want to maximize their profits . 
  mines is not allowed , but `` close-defence-charges '' is . 
  all overseas connection is hvdc !, 
  heheh , everyone always is , but if germany wants to cut its use of coal its going to import power from norway/sweden/denmark . 
  germany will buy it because it will cost costs a third less/kwh and for sweden it will double its expenses / kwh, 
  then they go for the offshore gold they have , there is a reason why the ecnomic zone of norway is halfway to iceland . 
  i do n't know about how they do this measurements , but many young swedes heads for the alps for the winters and get many jobs there . 
  `` hi , i 'm from swe . . '' `` here , help yourself . '', 
  why do you people let berlusconi discuss such a thing !?

  well there is soon no fish to regulate , also the fishing regulations of today is the worst , that you must dump if you catch to much , which means you dumps dead fish , hello ? 
  the only one that is allowed to fish around the waters of iceland or norway are fishing companies registered in one of these countries . 
  and registered in one country does not mean you can fish in the other .

  the swedish solution ? 
  pushing a country ( which in the practice , stands on their bare knees ) forward with these in mind : * as long as you do n't see your house as an investment ; you 're fine !, 
  * we have made us reliant of immigrations to push the housing and building industry forward . 
  * we do n't buy our own produced cars and people claims there 's no jobs ! ( ? ),

  the price for loka differs from where you buy them , trainstations or other popular places are like 18 sek ( = 2 $ ), 
  well , the media are calling them by the swedish name for gypsies now .

  the euro will not be stabile as long as the south europe has their main income from tourism and the north and western europe has their main income from the industry . 
  these two cant bee combined , the southern europe will always bee in the need of that the northern/western european goes for holiday inside the eu . 
  i really hopes that sweden wo n't join the euro , overall they jumped into the euro too early . 
  it 's not a great idea to let more countries join until the problems with the euro-countries has been settled and seen as stable again .
