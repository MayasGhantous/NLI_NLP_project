  if you are a guy you know you cant control if you are hard or not . 
  rape is sex without consent , so if you want sex with the person its not rape . 
  so your scenario is flawed, 
  kamel\u00e5s\u00e5 ? 
  not a minority with blue eyes where i 'm at . 
  but everyone will be a minority while traveling at least . 
  it contains a part of turkey and a part of russia . 
  it 's based on location , if you google that in sweden you get `` why is sweden so bad ? 
  they could not pay for the 1000 bottles of milk they ordered . 
  i think norway fall under the `` european countries we think are important '' category . 
  if your definition of a `` great swimmer '' is 6 + medals you have put the bar quite high . 
  are you actually this stupid or just like to shame people ? 
  if you actually read the article they were trying to make it more visible by carving the outline of it . 
  surely a stupid thing to do but not actively trying to destroy it . 
  also they are teenagers !, 
  how the fuck do you think they will turn out in later life if we approach everyone with your attitude ? 
  people may want many things but cant see how it will come back and hurt them in the future . 
  and then it 's too late to change it and everyone will blame the guys incharge for not doing anything . 
  if 51 % of the people voted for everyone to commit suicide you would let the whole country die ? 
  there is a line of democracy, 
  no but it does help with alot of other things, 
  sweden has everything in english aswell , dont know about the others but they probably has it aswell . 
  if you did not see the comment over you : http://i.imgur.com/hgp1jzi.jpg i think this is pretty straight forward, 
  that is a fact , not my opinion . 
  they went out with the statement `` lets give the 350m pound we give the eu a week to the nhs instaed ! '' . 
  this is manipulation and deceiving since there is no possible way to do that , and they knew about that aswell . 
  literally 3 hours after the vote was done the leave parties said `` oops that was a mistake there is no way we can do that '' . 
  there is no way for me to be biased in that . 
  well one of them is the leave parties spewing lies and tricking their voters to vote for them . 
  a vote that is manipulated by lies is not really democratic , the people did not even know what they were voting for and the politicians used the ignorence to get people to beleive ridiculous claims that made them vote for it . 
  but it is a fact that the leave campaign used huge lies to gain voters , i mean alot of people voted leave solely on made up stuff . 
  they even admitted it hours after the vote, 
  many people voted on the basis of the 350 million they send to the eu instaed going to the nhs , this is utter bullshit which even the leave parties admitted only hours after the vote was done ffs . 
  i dont recall anything from the remain side of this magnitude . 
  with `` no one 's favour '' he means everyone will be affected in a negative way . 
  just the fact that the leave campaign spewed lies to win raises huge red flags about the whole thing . 
  no worry with belgium with their match result , our boys just need to get over that it is the actual tournament . 
  lets throw both italy and belgium out !, 
  what are you implying ?? 
  odin needs his sacrifices !, 
  especially after that match against ireland . . 
  it will reach `` land '' , it just have to go through some water to reach it . 
  you could argue that you will always land , the difference is the quality of the landing, 
  and no reason not to either, 
  because walking/biking/driving somewhere is not something you can just skip . 
  they are probably going home , these people went out of there way to do something they have no problem with doing later . 
  it 's just a bit more than a kilometer a way from the attack , trust me they know . 
  yea you are , ours with norway was the first one . 
  and we did it because that is an actual old design from when we were a union . 
  the map ca n't get enough hearts though . 
  if we go by the longest day in the country the sun never sets . 
  no shame here but i gladly did it with you guys , just some other colours . 
  yea we were too big to fit on a picture this zoomed in  but nah you at least kept your flag clean all the time i looked at it . 
  we had our ups and downs . 
  because the dinosaurs did not have the eu and they went extinct . 
  because it 's the eu and we have extremely many languages in the same areas ? 
  making english the most convenient language to use . 
  do people really think thinking of someone else than yourself and wanting to interact with other people is a good thing ? 
  personal space is not because everyone is scared about being groped lol . 
  it 's just where people feel comfortable and do n't need to interact with others . 
  i have never seen or even heard of anyone putting ketchup on pizza . 
  we stick to [ this ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_3csn3qz_4ia/thkyqkwgw1i/aaaaaaaaapg/ybkpvrbjdwe/s1600/matsl\u00e4kten+002.jpg ) kind instead . 
  noo i think that is a bit far , [ our ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_3csn3qz_4ia/thkyqkwgw1i/aaaaaaaaapg/ybkpvrbjdwe/s1600/matsl\u00e4kten+002.jpg ) pizza surely must make up for it though ? 
  it 's glorious !, 
  [ here ] ( https://itresonates.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/sk.jpg ) you can have an example of the standard way to eat pasta . 
  what 's the problem ? 
  but do they take your fingerprints and make you look in to a eye scanner or something like that ? 
  looked like the standard in the us when i traveled there . 
  and the oh so original `` are you here to play basketball ? '', 
  when we were almost missing our connecting flight ... 
  ahh i see , my bad . 
  yea it can be a bit cool i guess . 
  it kinda adds to the atmosphere in there though , feels like a fitting setting for the ship . 
  it 's also really nice if it 's hot outside when you visit the ship . 
  why ? 
  we can get over 30 degrees in the summer and regularly between 20-25 . 
  i mean it does n't hurt to have one with you but it will most likely not be used . 
  maybe telepathy ? 
  i mean surely they are n't communicating with those sounds that comes out of their mouths ? 
  must be a bi-product from telepathy . 
  sadly you need to be a dane to use this so it really does n't weigh up the negatives . 
  well it did n't sink because of a hole or something , just very unstable . 
  kamel\u00e5s\u00e5, 
  but swedish is possible to understand when spoken *, 
  more like kamel\u00e5s\u00e5 . 
  no thread that mention denmark will be complete without at least one `` kamel\u00e5s\u00e5 '' . 
  nononoo thats the beauty of it , i do n't need to attack anyone for it since it 's pretty easy to get the ingredients !, 
  oh by the way if we are making this you do n't mind skipping the cheese right ? 
  i 'm allergic to it . 
  to get the ingredients for the pizza ? 
  already have some kebab so we only need some banana . 
  i knew you would want it !, 
  remove pineapple and bring on the banana and kebab ! , right ? 
  well that 's sad , i even got a italian last name lol . 
  does that make it worse since this is basically the norm where i 'm from . 
  [ this ] ( https://theswedelifeintoronto.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/spaghettiketchup.jpg ) is how to pasta right ? 
  if you compare them the / r/swarje is on another level . 
  / r/sweden is for more serious stuff at least half the time . 
  or a quarter . 
  since it is dark outside after 3 pm we spend much time in front of our computers , really good connection helps .
