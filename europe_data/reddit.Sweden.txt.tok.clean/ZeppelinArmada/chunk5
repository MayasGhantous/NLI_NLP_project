  it 's been an hour since this happened , i think that if there was actually bullets flying it would 've been confirmed by now - i 've basically been following this as best as i can for the past hour . 
  as far as i know ; there 's been no verified reports of gunfire , at most , the police have said that they have recieved reports of it . 
  i 've seen people talk in social media about it , but the police have not confirmed it and all the media i 've seen , heard and read have had no confirmation of it either . 
   the truck appears to have driven a longer distance amongst the people on drottninggatan . 
  from kammargatan to olof palmes gata over to kungsgatan there is splintered glass and other tracks . 
   `` people are lying ground down across the entire distance . 
  cpr being given out . 
  garbage disposal bags are being used to cover lifeless bodies '' says a witness to dn . 
   more info shortly . 
  edit : rumours are saying there 's sounds of gunfire comming from \u00c5hlens . 
  edit2 : http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/stockholm/lastbil-har-kort-in-i-folkmassa-i-stockholm/  a vehicle is running down people on drottninggatan in central stockholm . 
  there are seemingly lifeless bodies on the street says several vitnesses to expressen . 
   `` i saw atleast three dead , but there are probably more . 
  it 's a complete mess here '' , says p4 extras reporter marting svenningsen to ekot . 
   `` i saw hundreds of people running , they where running for their lives . '', 
   pictures are showing smoke comming from the h&m warehouse edit3 : swedish television saying the truck had been hijacked/stolen . 
  belonged to spendrups brewery and the driver was unloading drinks for a resturant in the area when someone climbed in and drove off with it . 
  edit4 : police have requested that all train traffic passing through stockholm central to stop . 
  edit5 : police are saying 3 dead , 8 injured . 
  if that 's all we should consider ourselves lucky . 
  drottninggatan is usually very crowded as it 's one of the main pedestrian walkways through town , lined with stores . 
  edit6 : [ this tweet ] ( https://twitter.com/ulrika_nilsson/status/850352735459438593/photo/1 ) shows an arrest - i would advice waiting for more official sources . 
  there 's a lot of folks out there trying to score cheap political points and the rumour mill is running wild .

  https://www.reddit.com/r/sweden/comments/4w9m5x/hpsa_sveriges_st%c3%b6rsta_neutralitetsbrott/ we also did this . 
  crazy how few norweigans are aware of it .

  the default state of a swede at room temperature is smug . 
  finders keepers !, 
  sorry about that . 
  there 's many steps on the integration staircase . 
  learning the local language is one of them . 
  sure , not everyone climbs all the way , but you still need to climb the first steps if you want to get anywhere . 
  trust a fin with 10 u 's in their handle to spot the misplaced u. 
  oh , you mean miklagardr ? 
  norweigeans are normally 15 % less suspicious than danes , but as we get closer to the 17th of may it will steadily drop to around 9 % ( 7 % if they 're also wearing a lusekofte ) , after which it 'll then gradually increase back up the standard resting value of 15 % as they recover from their hangovers . 
  speaking as a swede , anything involving the danes should be viewed with suspicion . 
  suprised seeing belgium so far down on the list . 
  30 years old here . 
  still do n't consider myself a grownup . 
  maybe the bad guys are killing eachother ? 
  there 's no place in sweden where the police wo n't go . 
  it all boils down to someone translating a list of troublesome spots with increased criminal activity as `` no-go zones '' and that 's the term which stuck , regardless of how poorly it fits the truth . 
  probably because it fits really well with the message certain groups are trying to send . 
  mars makal\u00f6s is also quite famous , but it 's only really naval and history nerds who know of her . 
  but that is one ship that had a huge impact when it comes to naval warfare and ship construction not just in the baltic . 
  but there is no museum for her to make the public aware of her since she was only recently found and unlike the vasa she 's not been salvaged and preserved . 
  so was my first post . 
  my mistake then . 
  there was probably a free entry campaign when i visited then , because i was told there would be no entry fee on my visit . 
  all ships are refered to as she . 
  honestly , that 's your loss . 
  especially since there 's no entry fee . 
  in a way , that would make more sense because normally pink , fluffy and humanitarian are n't really things you associate with fighter jets , but saying they 're selling lethal fighter jets is kinda like saying they 're selling wet water . 
  that 's an odd headline . 
  are there non-lethal fighter jets and if there were , why would anyone buy those ? 
  i mean , when it all comes down to it , we 're talking about weapons of war . 
  i suspect you do n't know a thing about them . 
  ah yes , moving on to ridicule now are we ? 
  they 're not secretly evil nazis because it 's not a secret what sort of folks make up their ranks . 
  http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article18013583.ab sd-top praises combat performance of ss troops . 
  `` i am a proud racist '' http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/dokument/har-ar-sds-morka-bakgrund-i-nazism/ g\u00f6sta bergquist ( sd ) at a neonazi demonstation in memory of rudolf hess . 
  fuck no , sd are worth suspicion . 
  they may try and keep their mouths shut in public and prefer suits over uniforms , but it 's hardly a secret were they 're really from . 
   not twisting anything . 
  yes you are . 
  you 're insisting that my use of the word nothing in comparisson to the peak of 2015 and the predicted numbers for 2017 applies to the 30k from 2016 despite me clarifying it does not . 
  a party that advocates full stop is being too lax ? 
  i do n't think i 'm interested in hearing what your suggested final solution to the immigration problem is then . 
  no , i said it tricked down to nothing when refering to 2017 's numbers . 
  twist my words all you like . 
  besides we 're still only talking the number of folks who sought asylum , the number of folks accepted will be lower . 
  sd are not the panacea you seem to think they are . 
  their roots stem outright from a neonazi organisation , there 's ex-ss voulenteers on their founding members list . 
  they might be doing their best to try and clean up their act , but the fact remains that at the core , you 're still dealing with the same people . 
  a party where prolific members of the party are under investigation for assault and have been involved in a large number of scandals several times have been using goverment grants for things they where not intended for . 
  hell , the party leaders mother in law got into parliment on sd 's vote . 
  she takes her quite substantial monthly wage , but she has never , not once taken her seat in parliment . 
  she 's done none of the work expected of her . 
  and a party that quite frankly , is still very much a one trick pony . 
  their solution to everything , their suggestion to find the funds for everything they 're promising all boils down to the same thing ; stopping immigration . 
  a party that decided to shoot down a budget proposition that would 've fullfilled their promise of more money to care for the elderly because it did n't involve a full stop . 
  most swedes are probably in favour of cutting immigration , but sd are not the solution . 
  there 's way more topics to talk about when it comes to running a country than what sd are willing to discuss . 
  the large donations they 've recieved lately along with their sudden pro-russian stance are also suspicious to me . 
  they 're also not very happy with the idea of gay marriage or adoptions and if you know anything about sweden , you 'd know most of us belive in equal rights . 
  also , the elections took place before the refugee crisis really kicked off . 
  i 'm not sure where the idea that we 're pretending it 's not a problem is comming from . 
  it 's a subject that 's huge in social media , there 's plenty of media coverage about it aswell as discussions of it in every level of goverment . 
  hell , it tends to be a big discussion topic at every family gathering i 've been at for the last four or five years . 
  this whole mess is being painted up far too much as a yes or no thing , but as always , the reality is n't just black and white . 
  there 's plenty of talk going around in the grey areas inbetween the absolutes . 
  there 's problems , i do n't know anyone who actually denies that , yet every day i find foreigners claiming we swedes do just that . 
  every day i find someone on the other side of the globe telling me how dangerous it is just outside my door , or in the areas i grew up - and they bring some really big brushes to paint up this exaggerated reality of theirs . 
  it 's not so bad as they would have you think . 
  malm\u00f6 might be the most dangerous city in scandinavia , but that also means there 's about 4.7 homicides per 100 000 people per year ( or so i read in another discussion i saw earlier today in / r/sweden . 
  i could n't find any more up to date numbers , [ but this page ] ( http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/stats/crime/violent-crime/murder-rate ) says in 2010 , the us had 13 homicides per 100 000 people . 
  that 's the whole of the us , compared to the worst of our cities . 
  i 'm sure someone can dig up more recent numbers .
