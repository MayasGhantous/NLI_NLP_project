  weather is so depressing half the year . 
  the lack of sunlight in the winter makes me very grumpy and slightly depressed . 
   about your first point then maybe those people should reconsider if its worth the risk to commit a crime . 
  i do n't think anyone should be subjected to torture or the death penalty no matter what . 
  they have to face the same punishment as everybody else . 
   as for your second point i do not really agree with you . 
  why not ? 
  what 's the point of giving citizenship if everyone who has one is n't equal under law ? 
  if you 're referring to point 7 then it can be a bad thing because for some it may be a death penalty or torture . 
  if you 're referring to point 18 then i believe everybody should be the same under the law . 
  once you 're swedish by law then skin color , other citizenships , origin or origin of parents should n't matter . 
  does n't matter , i 'm sure there are some curious people who open downvoted comments !, 
  point 7 and 18 . http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/sverigedemokraternas-33-punkter/ edit : wrong number, 
  i misunderstood what he meant . 
  i replied to him and if you 're interested then you can read it as well . 
  i did n't follow the london riots in detail because it did n't affect me , my friends or my country in any way . 
  fair enough i miss interpreted what you wanted to say . 
  svd is one of the better newspapers in sweden . 
  i 'll translate the part of the article which is the most relevant about the far-right extremists . 
  around 60 far-right extremists were driving on friday evening in about 30-something cars in stockholm suburbs , monitored by police . 
  in tumba south of the city they were following people on the streets until the police intervened and stopped them . 
  `` there were around 50 to 60 people with hoodies who were running around and being loud '' , says towe h\u00e4gg at stockholm 's police county communication central . 
  the group then drove to \u00c4lvsj\u00f6 and from there till m\u00e4larh\u00f6jden ( all stockholm suburbs ) where the police got some of them while the rest left , was reported by scanpix 's photographer who witnessed . 
  towe h\u00e4gg says that 18 people where taken care of for disturbance of the peace in close proximity of m\u00e4larh\u00f6jdens metro station , but does not want to comment if they were far-right extremists . 
  `` this group has joined the riots but they have had such behavior that we were concerned that criminal activity will happen and that 's why we intervened '' , says kjell lindgren , stockholm police pr representative . 
  -------------------------------------------------------------- interpret this the way you want . 
  these people were most likely far-right extremists or people who like rioting ( if not both ) . 
  it 's also important to note that many second generation immigrants may have one swedish parent when reading statistics about the swedish population in general . 
  however the second generation immigrants who are involved in these riots probably do n't have a swedish parent . 
  also one most not forget that the vast majority of the second generation immigrants from these areas are n't involved in the riots and that this is also their homeland . 
  too bad that this is n't the london riots and whatever the guardian thinks is irrelevant . 
  rioters in sweden will never be considered heroes . 
  many people living in these areas are innocent and are very scared . 
  no but far-right extremists might seek out the rioters or harm innocent people but maybe this did n't occur to you . 
  b-b-but when did i say it was an argument ? 
  are you trying to straw man me by twisting what i meant ? 
  i 'm not defending anyone . 
  it 's the first piece of news on a major swedish newspaper website . 
  i thought it might have been of interest to someone . 
  if more of the far-right decide to group up it could lead to a very violent clash . 
  also when the far-right appears twice the amount of the far-left appears which could lead to even more violence . 
  many of the best players in dortmund and bayern are n't even german ... 
  in other news ~ 55 far-right extremists at hitting the streets . 
  fortunately there was no clash with the rioters . 
   because nothing can have changed in 25 years . 
  not to mention that is bss which was like two organizations removed from them even back then . 
  10 years ago a sweden democrat called sveriges radio \u00d6rebro and said [ these ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upxz1im1leu ) kinds of things . 
  as you know this was 7 years before the election and their popularity started to grow long before that . 
  another one claimed that [ africans are programmed to rape children .

  and it does n't matter if these people were excluded from the party or not ; how often do you hear about these kinds of stories about other parties ? 
  things have changed in 25 years but not as much as many people and especially many of their voters think . 
   you mean two party members at one occasion over two years ago armed themselves with iron pipes after supposedly being threatened by organized criminals and one of them acted like a prick while doing so . 
   they were subsequently given the option of stepping down from their political posts or getting kicked out and the one who acted like a prick left the party entirely . 
  did you watch the video ? 
  they were speaking with a drunk guy and a girl as far as i remember . 
  then they walked away and saw iron pipes and armed themselves with it . 
  at the very end of the video one of them were speaking behind the back of another guy calling him a `` wigger '' . 
  if it would have been a mainstream party they would have been kicked out without question . 
  can you imagine borg or ask doing these kinds of things ? 
  ministers have resigned their posts for black labor and what not . 
  not like it 's true anyway . 
  there 's far more aggression and personal attacks coming from the other parties than from sd in parliament and tv debates . 
  in these 25 years that have passed their most important goal by far is still to reduce immigration . 
  this is how they market themselves . 
  they use terms like `` mass immigration '' and `` responsible immigration policy '' . 
  i personally consider this aggressive and it 's borderline straw man . 
  when they debate about the amount of immigrants ( especially ones whom they dislike ) moving to sweden they use factoids . 
  no wonder why any other party do n't want to debate them . 
  what i do n't understand is ( at least from my experience which may very well be wrong ) is why people who vote for the sweden democrats are so critical of the current immigration policy but hardly seem to criticize of their own party . 
  [ the party has a very dirty history .

   consequence : poverty . 
   solution : return . 
  ( political correct term for expulsion )  warning  to swedish girls !, 
   avoid unprotected sex with  negros who carry deadly aids !, 
   preferably : do n't dishonor your race ,  your sweden , your family and extended family . 
   abort only in emergency . 
   keep sweden swedish top party members are also known for harassing people and equipping themselves with iron pipes if they get scared . 
  also the party 's rhetoric and style of debating is extremely aggressive . 
  old article . 
  interesting that there were so few far-right terrorists .

  the nhl is the only league in the world which has its playoffs scheduled during the wc . 
  nothing is stopping the nhl to have the its playoffs scheduled earlier like every single other league in the world . 
  also canada sent many of their best players ( stamkos , subban , giroux ) and still lost in the quarter finals . 
  in many languages the term ( i.e. 
  swedish ) `` ras '' can be applied to both race and breed ; hence only racists use the term `` ras '' for humans . 
  no normal person would use the term breed for humans . 
  it 's sort of a paux fas or false friend . 
  actually if i recall correctly morocco was rejected by the eu because it was n't considered european . 
  i 'm not disagreeing with you however it makes it a lot more convenient for people driving through multiple european countries . 
  slightly off topic as far as i have understood the 120 km/h is safer than what most countries have at the moment .
