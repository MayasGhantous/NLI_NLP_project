  i suspect that you 're american . 
  your country voted in bush twice and the people were so brainwashed by propaganda that universal healthcare is socialist . 
  at least the half of your country are fucking sheep . 
  of course he did n't . 
  he 's just angry that a local is more informed about swedish politics than someone who gets all their information on reddit . 
  according to posts on / r/worldnews one would think that sweden is a caliphate run by fascist-feminists . 
  i agree with you that their current position is very ironic . 
  but would n't you say that liberalism is on the centre-right side of the political spectrum . 
  m and s are arch enemies . 
  v will never rule with a centre-right party . 
  the only scenario where m and s rule together is if there is a third world war . 
  i literally listed you the facts which prove why they are racist , incompetent and unfit to be part of a coalition . 
  whether i am angry or not does n't change the truth . 
  i also do n't care about the military funding in the us . 
  your comment is a poor straw man , 3/10 troll . 
  this is not one person . 
  the party leader joined the party while it [ compromised of many neo-nazi skinheads . 
  ] ( http://www.stefanbergmark.se/wp-content/uploads/sd-heil.jpg ) party members are consistently caught being racist . 
  [ a member of parliament was caught calling black people as monkeys . 
  ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/20130426/47570 ) [ this `` former '' neo-nazi used to be a member in the party not too long ago . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9djtguvtce ) [ this man is the leader of the sweden democrats in stockholm writes racist comments on far-right blogs . 
  ] ( http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/expressen-avslojar/har-ar-sd-toppens-inlagg-pa-hatsajten/ ) [ then there is the infamous iron-pipe scandal in which top members racially abused a swedish comedian and said sexist things to a woman and later armed themselves with iron-pipes in central stockholm . 
  ] ( http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/j%c3%a4rnr%c3%b6rsskandalen ) if you want to read of some first hand experience with the party then you should read [ this article . 
  ] ( http://www.sydsvenskan.se/asikter/mrutyuanjai-mishra-darfor-lamnar-jag-sd-och-slutar-som-kronikor-pa-avpixlat/ ) he used to be a member of the sweden democrats and he was a columnist for the same far-right blog which the other sweden democrats wrote comments on . 
  the tl ; dr is that he joined an organisation which fights for the free press and is heavily influenced by the far-right . 
  he later joined sd and was pretty much used to in order for the party to look less racist . 
  now he wants to be an independent journalist to write and spread tolerance and multiculturalism and he apologised for his actions . 
  now to answer your questions : * you should not discredit them if they have abandoned their opinions and apologized for it . 
  being a member in the sweden democrats is literally the opposite of that . 
  * sweden ca n't sustain all refugees in the world . 
  also your question is incorrect since the majority of the asylum seekers are from syria and not from africa . 
  if syria was at peace the percentage of refugees who are granted asylum would be much lower ( around 25 % to 35 % ) and at levels from around 2009-2011 . 
  * logic does definitely `` enter my brain '' . 
  however , you are completely uninformed or you are lying . 
  this party has had so many incidents with racism and other scandals that they 're practically immune from them by now . 
  inform yourself more before writing incorrect things on forums . 
  why ? 
  the centre-right wo n't be in coaltion with sd . 
  then the current centre-right government will be remembered as the government who let racism win and had to compromise with neo-nazis if they 'd let sd in . 
  they would n't be able to win any future elections . 
  also the situation in hungary is different . 
  fidesz has been the mainstream centre-right party since the fall of communism . 
  sd have roots in the swedish neo-nazi movement . 
  this is slightly incorrect . 
  they had 2.9 % in 2006 which is only 1.1 % away from entering parliament . 
  a party with 0 % would n't attract people who want their vote to count . 
  it 's not one person . 
  [ these people were skinhead neo-nazis in the early and mid 90 's . 
  ] ( http://www.stefanbergmark.se/wp-content/uploads/sd-heil.jpg ) the picture i linked you was taken in 1994 . 
  this is only 1 year before the current party leader joined them . 
  also i 'm not saying that people who vote sd are necessarily racist but there is no doubt that the sweden democrats ( a party which has roots in the swedish neo-nazi movement ) is racist . 
  not necessarily his logic but there is no doubt that far-left have members which are still communist . 
  they , just like the far-right , have a thought police which tells members to be politically correct i.e. 
  not to say they are communist and revolutionary ( or nazi and racist for the far-right ) . 
  it 's not a coincidence that they officially stopped calling themselves as communists after the fall of the soviet union . 
  a difference between the far-right and the far-left is that the far-right is a lot more stigmatized than the far-left . 
  there are multiple reasons for this . 
  one is that traditionally far-right parties are much more different than mainstream centre-right parties are in contrast to the far-left which many times have similar goals to the centre-left ( e.x. 
  the welfare state , equality , feminism , etc ) . 
  another is that people think of ww2 , hitler and the holocaust when people talk about the far-right ( especially about parties such as the sweden democrats who have roots in the swedish neo-nazi movement ) . 
  these thoughts and experiences we 've had in europe hit a lot closer to home than the atrocities in the soviet union and china . 
  see this comment http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2gcvkr/antiimmigration_far_right_making_historic_gains/ckhx54f, 
  no since your party has never been neo-nazi . 
  see this comment from this thread . 
  what a shitpost, 
  i know that . 
  besides that the quota would probably break international treaties it 's also unconstitutional as far as i have understood . 
  a politician or parliament ( or similar ) can not order how a court should rule . 
  the role of the court is to interpret the law and then make a decision without government interference . 
  off-topic but this is also why the swedish government will not give assagne a guarantee on not being extradited to the americans if he returns to sweden to stand trial for rape ( or similar ) since we have an extradition treaty with the americans . 
  now i am not sure exactly how asylum seekers travel to sweden but i suspect they are smuggled in . 
  as far as i am aware we do not bring people here from camps in other countries . 
  it 's currently impossible to seek asylum at a swedish embassy or consulate . 
  if i recall correctly the two largest parties are against changing the law so it 's possible to apply for asylum on foreign soil . 
  if i 'm incorrect then i 'd like to be corrected . 
  what happens to the ones which are refused , do they get sent back or do they go underground ? 
  before the war in syria sweden used to accept 25-35 % of the applicants . 
  the far right wanted to decrease that number by 90 % so only 2.5-3 .5 % would be accepted . . 
  i never made that claim . 
  the host of a tv-debate/interrogation claimed that the ministry of migration did . 
  for all we know finland might be in breach of international laws and nobody cares . 
  also that 's a bit over 1000 every year which seems to be really low . 
  my family owns a house in a village close to gy\u0151r ( a city close to vienna and bratislava ) which i visit every year . 
  my father was born in that house a few years after ww2 . 
  not to mention that [ ministerstyre ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ministerstyre ) is unconstitutional makes it more difficult for politicians to do certain things such as reduce immigration ( and similar ) by 90 % . 
  did you watch the tv-debate/interrogation yesterday night ? 
  according to the host the ministry of migration said if they were to implement the changes sd proposed without breaking any international laws and conventions immigration would only be reduced by 25 % . 
  it 's probably both . 
  i think it 's more like : `` i 'm more likely to get asylum in sweden than in poland '' and `` i can afford the trip to europe '' . 
  italy and hungary, 
  swedish and english fluently hungarian , italian and german mediocrely, 
  no i do n't care about those videos . 
  i just think that it 's silly to circlejerk about videos which are just rants . 
  he is selling books called `` godless and free '' and `` freedom is my religion '' on his youtube page . 
  is this guy a wan na be richard dawkins ? 
  what 's wrong with my flag ? 
  does this man actually have any video debates or does he only have videos about how horrible muslims and pakistanis are ? 
  i 'll politely disagree that debate cures hate speech . 
  there has never been a point in history where it has been so easy to exchange ideas with the use of the internet . 
  [ yet these people literally rally in front of my home every year .
