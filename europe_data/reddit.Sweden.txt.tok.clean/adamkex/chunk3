  ] ( http://www.svt.se/cachable_image/1395219169/svts/article1906447.svt/alternates/large/svenskarnas_parti_1-webb.jpg ) some people have so swallowed so much propaganda and hatred that debating is almost futile . 
  i do n't know if this person needs medical treatment or not and that 's up for him to decide . 
  he kept the same title as the guardian gave it . 
  the standard the united states has said for free speech makes a lot of sense for you and honestly what the united states has or does n't have does not interest me and many others . 
  our `` restrictive speech laws '' lets neo-nazis rally with police protection and if you read the article it says that it 's unusual for courts to rule like this . 
  he is pretty much calling for the hanging of three men ( which i 'd definitely arrest you for ) and he has a history of masquerading racism as art . 
  at least our political system is designed so it can properly take advantage of freedom of speech unlike the american one where there will almost always only be two parties . 
  whether he should be sentenced to prison is debatable but it 's not his `` right '' any longer when it 's violating hate speech laws . 
  not if it goes against hate speech laws . 
  or is this just your opinion ? 
  [ take a look at his works ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2eq2mf/swedish_artist_sentenced_for_racist_art/ck1x9a2 ) whether he deserves to put into jail or not is debatable but this is obviously hate speech . 
  i felt a sense of disbelief when i read your reply . 
  i hope you did n't interpret my comment that i think it 's ok to stone people or use violence . 
  i did n't in any way imply it 's ok to break the law . 
  why do you think it 's important that people speak their own language at home and have their own customs and religion as long as it does n't hurt anyone ( besides your nationalistic ego ) ? 
  jesus christ you right-wingers are nuts . 
  you ca n't compare sweden with the us or italy . 
  the camorra , ` ndraghetta , la cosa nostra and similar organisations have nothing to do with immigration . 
  the us kept slaves and then had organized segregation laws . 
  i do n't know enough france to make a statement about them . 
  you also forget that there are locals and even redditors struggle with some of the points you make . 
  go back to / r/niggers or whatever the new version of that subreddit is called . 
  what do you expect them to do ? 
  throw rocks on the car ? 
  most of the people probably did n't even know that 's isis ' song . 
  i guess the left will have to compromise with the right about the budget . 
  yes , if the parties are similar . 
  i do n't think it 's a viable long-term strategy . 
  they only need to be the largest minority . 
  i do n't think reinfeldt will rule with sd . 
  i 'm almost certain it will be s+mp+v if they win , which they probably will, 
  that 's wishful thinking on your part !, 
  mp is both larger than c and fp . 
  amazing . 
  a person with no experience in government is set to be a pm supported by the far-left and the greens . 
  i 'll try to explain it to you . 
  it 's because assimilation implies that you abandon your culture . 
  many people are fleeing their countries because they ca n't be themselves such as christians from iraq who are going to be terrorized by isis . 
  they go to europe because they want to be themselves . 
  here are some of the things which are n't assimilation : * learning the native language * having a job * getting educated * interacting and socializing with natives i do n't understand what else should be required from refugees . 
  the statistic in question is how many refugees will apply for asylum and not how many will be granted it . 
  the war in syria is responsible for more than a third of applicants and i believe that the situation with isis will cause kurds to christians to flee from iraq . 
  here are some actual statistics : [ asylum decisions this year ] ( http://www.migrationsverket.se/download/18.7c00d8e6143101d166d1aad/1406887602104/avgjorda+asyl%c3%a4renden+2014+-+asylum+desicions+2014.pdf ) [ asylum applications this year ] ( http://www.migrationsverket.se/download/18.7c00d8e6143101d166d1aab/1406887607740/inkomna+ans%c3%b6kningar+om+asyl+2014+-+applications+for+asylum+received+2014.pdf ) [ asylum decisions 2013 ] ( http://www.migrationsverket.se/download/18.7c00d8e6143101d166dda8/1390234104754/avgjorda+asyl%c3%a4renden+2013+-+asylum+desicions+2013.pdf ) [ asylum applications 2013 ] ( http://www.migrationsverket.se/download/18.7c00d8e6143101d166ddae/1390234164007/inkomna+ans%c3%b6kningar+om+asyl+2013+-+applications+for+asylum+received+2013.pdf ) [ asylum decisions 2012 ] ( http://www.migrationsverket.se/download/18.5e83388f141c129ba63128c3/1381926423403/avgjorda+asyl%c3%a4renden+2012+-+asylum+decisions+2012.pdf ) [ asylum applications 2012 ] ( http://www.migrationsverket.se/download/18.5e83388f141c129ba63128c0/1381926423391/inkomna+ans%c3%b6kningar+om+asyl+2012+-+applications+for+asylum+received+2012.pdf ) [ asylum decisions 2011 ] ( http://www.migrationsverket.se/download/18.5e83388f141c129ba63131e2/1381926436582/avgjorda+asyl%c3%a4renden+2011+-+asylum+decisions+2011.pdf ) [ asylum applications 2011 ] ( http://www.migrationsverket.se/download/18.5e83388f141c129ba6312c99/1381926428363/asyls%c3%b6kande+2011+-+asylumseekers+2011.pdf ) [ asylum decisions 2010 ] ( http://www.migrationsverket.se/download/18.5e83388f141c129ba6312c94/1381926428352/avgjorda+asyl%c3%a4renden+2010+-+asylum+decisions+2010.pdf ) [ asylum applications 2010 ] ( http://www.migrationsverket.se/download/18.5e83388f141c129ba63127ea/1381926423207/inkomna+ans%c3%b6kningar+om+asyl+2010.pdf ) [ more statistics ] ( http://www.migrationsverket.se/english/about-the-migration-board/statistics.html ), 
  liechtenstein is on the map, 
  what about them scots ? 
  pretty much my opinion, 
  that was my point when i asked limitlessltd why he was suspected being a robber . 
  i know this will sound really snobbish but i 'm sure glad we do n't have american gun culture , american racial tensions and that gated communities are rare . 
  why was he suspected of being a robber ? 
  i 'm not informed enough about that case . 
  why did he follow him ? 
  he ca n't accept that a homogeneous police force might have problems interacting with minorities . 
  which has nothing to do with this your claim that eastern europeans have little in common and muslims ( over 1.5 bn people ) have a lot in common . 
  a muslim from pakistan and a muslim from somalia are a lot more different than say a slovak and a russian . 
  at least their language is n't in the same family and are part of two completely different ethnic groups . 
  i agree . 
  i do n't hate them but i do n't think anyone should give them anything . 
  you forgot something , we 're all gay and super feminazi . 
  used iphones ( and other modern cellphones ) are n't expensive if they 're used and old models . 
  cellphones are important for all homeless people . 
  some homeless people try to get 1 year membership on 24 hour gyms so they can lock in their stuff and get to shower . 
  most homeless people who are n't from eastern europe has psychological problems ( dependence , disability , etc. ), 
  which is why they ca n't get a job , home and a normal life . 
  many of these people have been tried to be helped but they could n't manage which is why they still are homeless even in our nordic societies . 
  however , many of our native homeless people try to stay under the radar as much as possible which is why you wo n't see them begging . 
  if our homeless can get them then there is no doubt that romani beggars can . 
  do n't judge the report by the first paragraph which has nothing to do with the report itself . 
  it 's their intro which is available in every report they 've ( recently ) released and on their `` about us '' page on their website . 
  who upvotes these kinds of comments ? 
  you obviously do n't understand what hate speech laws are if you have to make such jokes about them . 
  this is a ngo . 
  they bear no responsibility to what the american government does [ and they 're in favor of closing guantanamo . 
  ] ( http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/wp-content/uploads/pdf/blueprints2012/hrf_guantanamo_blueprint.pdf ), 
  it looks like you 've upset some people . 
  :'( i think they need some of this : http://i.imgur.com/it7dxpi.jpg, 
  i do n't know . 
  i do n't drink , do drugs or drive . 
  i hope this guy can make it . 
  it 's very important . 
  interesting !, 
  can it be done on the street ? 
  how accurate is it from a time perspective ? 
  would a person who has smoked two days ago test positive on such a saliva test ? 
  then i 'd say that 's an important problem regarding legalization since the state has approved the use of a drug which ca n't be properly tested on the stop . 
  i 'm not really interested in the potential effects legalization could have . 
  how do these tests work ? 
  when i say misuse i mean people who get high at times when they should n't be such as when one is driving . 
  i 'm curious . 
  assuming marijuana was made legal . 
  this means the state will tax it and need to take responsibilities with counter measure of the misuse of it . 
  how would traffic police check people they suspect are high ? 
  hehehe https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1tnzciusi0, 
  how many italian men have went to malta ? 
  oooooooooo i 'm so scared, 
  troll polish mountain . 
  1 meter too short . 
  which is because we intervened in the past . 
  it has to stop at some point . 
  i disagree . 
  they are n't a threat to us .
