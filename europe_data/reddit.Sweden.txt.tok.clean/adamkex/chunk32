  i do n't think there were many violent protests in turkey but please correct me if i am wrong . 
  in vancouver there have been two violent riots because of the stanley cup in the last twenty years . 
  stupid and bored people exist everywhere . 
  [ what 's your point ? 
  have you read leviticus ? 
  christianity in its `` pure form '' is n't that different . 
  the muslims i asked just said that the film was in bad taste and did n't really care about it . 
  the violent protests were mostly in countries with huge political instability and/or poverty . 
  the most important thing is to get people to function in society . 
  that is to either be studying or working and to learn the language . 
  when people function in society then they will most likely be just like any other person . 
  of course there will always be some `` rotten apples '' like extremists who want sharia law and people who want to close the borders , deport everybody with an immigrant background and ban islam . 
  i have friends from many different cultures and everything is working fine for me . 
  even though this will never happen but the world would be a lot better place if people would learn to leave each other alone . 
  how is this news ? 
  what did i just read ? 
  * hen * no but in all seriousness `` din j\u00e4vla horunge '' is pretty nasty . 
  it translates to `` you son of a bitch '' . 
  i think any marriage in between adults which is consentual should be legal . 
  relevant username, 
  germany is the largest country in europe . 
  and greece and hungary are small . 
  i have a hard time seeing anything like this . 
  of course , it 's an international trend . 
  but many of these far-right organisations seem to function very differently . 
  you have the golden dawn which seems to be the greek version of the hungarian jobbik . 
  i do n't think that other western european far-right parties would want to cooperate so much . 
  the dutch freedom party ( ? ), 
  led by geert wilders are very anti-islam but have nothing against jews , unlike their greek and hungarian counterparts . 
  the sweden democrats are very similar to their dutch counterparts . 
  i have a hard time seeing any real cooperation happening , at least anytime soon . 
  there is no reason why it would affect other countries on a wide scale . 
  i think they will cause chaos in greek politics . 
  that they are crazy . 
  they are very open about their ultranationalism and possibly neonazism . 
  in my defense there are people who say worse things and there are actually serious . 
  not sure if serious or far-right troll . 
  so greek immigrants in new york should support the deportation ( and what not ) of immigrants in greece ? 
  i know this . 
  i was just stating that it . 
  did n't the nazis do the same thing ? 
  but 80-90 years ago . 
  he wrote `` they '' eighteen times . 
  instead of trying to ban islam he should try to mind his own business . 
  according to [ this ] ( http://stoppavaldtakterna.nu/statistik%20sverige%209.html ) most of the rapes are by people who do not have a close relationship with the victim . 
  as you can see [ here ] ( http://stoppavaldtakterna.nu/statistik%20eu.html ) 10.8 % swedes have experienced `` crime of sexual nature '' within the last 5 years highest per capita in the eu . 
  this is 2.6 times higher than the eu average and second highest in the eu . 
  in 2010 , 4134 rapes were reported to the police . 
  out of these 313 went to court and 33 % of the prosecutions were cleared . 
  according calculations 207 people were convicted for rape . 
  the corresponding percentage of others crimes is around 5 . 
  of course we want an accurate conviction rate . 
  but considering that sweden has a low conviction rate and the amount of reported rapes has skyrocketed in the last 10 years shows that most likely somewhere in the system there is too much bureaucracy and/or too much inefficiency . 
  it does n't matter . 
  there are statistics that sweden has ( one of the ) the lowest conviction rate ( s ) in europe for rape . 
   naomi wolf has also written that sweden has the lowest conviction rate in europe . 
  let 's try solving this first . 
  why would i be surprised ? 
  i hope you realize that the majority of muslims who have emigrated to the uk have done so because they do n't want to live in `` some feudal shithole '' . 
  his ( anti ) drug policy is what concerns me the least . 
  his social values are old and outdated . 
  probably at a similar level to mitt romney . 
   the civic platform combines ordoliberal stances on the economy with liberal conservative stances on social and ethical issues , including opposition to abortion , same-sex marriage , soft drug decriminalisation , euthanasia , fetal stem cell research , removal of crosses and other religious symbols in schools and public places , and partially to wide availability of in vitro fertilisation . 
  on the other hand , there is growing centrist `` faction '' favoring progressive modernisation of country , social justice , social tolerance ( especially civil pacts of solidarity ) , a social market economy , flexicurity and environmental sustainability . 
  the party also wants to criminalise gambling and supports religious education in schools . 
  other socially conservative stances of the party include voting to ban designer drugs and amending the penal code to introduce mandatory chemical castration of pedophiles . 
  from his party 's wikipedia page . 
   on 27 october 2009 , tusk declared that he wants to partially outlaw gambling . 
  [ 8 ] there are some concerns on internet censorship , as tusk wants to ban internet gambling and monitor internet connections and money transfers . 
  during the 2009 swine flu pandemic , tusk defended his government 's decision not to purchase swine flu vaccine , citing the lack of testing by pharmaceutical companies and its unavailability to be purchased freely through the market . 
  tusk criticized other nations ' responses to the pandemic . 
  `` the eagerness of some countries seems to be excessive and disproportionate to the real epidemiological situation '' , tusk stated , referring to the pandemic 's relatively low fatality rate . 
  [ 9 ] the government 's decision drew harsh responses from opposition members in the sejm . 
  from his own wikipedia page . 
  looks like this man is against progression , telling me how to live my life and the surveillance society !, 
  * fabulous !, 
  if you consider sd on the far-right then i think they will either rise by a couple of percentage or be stagnant and then drop under 4 % within 10-20 years . 
  if you are talking about the `` real '' far-right like nd and svp then you 're absolutely right . 
  sweden is not part of the nato and we are officially neutral . 
  we have also had high profile diplomats in the likes of raoul wallenberg , folke bernadotte and former secretary-general of the united nations dag hammarskj\u00f6ld . 
  maybe they did n't come recently and the country where they emigrated from is in a lot worse condition . 
  good for you . 
  [ the link ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/zcm4u/islam_in_europe_a_real_problem_the_debate_about/c63ixlz ) op posted is not deemed as racist ? 
  [ other subreddits ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/shitredditsays+none/comments/ze0ix/top_comment_in_reurope_i_dont_know_why_were_still/ ) are making fun of us . 
  these type of anti-roma or islamophobic threads upset me as well . 
  the best you can do is downvote or report them if you deem it as racist or as hate-speech . 
  whenever you are in a discussion with these types of people and they ask you to define racism is means that there is no point in discussing it anymore because their next move will be to claim that `` islam is not a race '' . 
  maybe we wo n't have any thorium plants within 20-30 years . 
  costs money , time , technology , fuel and at the same time we want fusion . 
  i know about thorium , however i do not know how much of it there is in europe and also i know that the technology for thorium reactors are not there yet . 
  if i recall correctly there are large thorium deposits in india , russia and china . 
  we need nuclear fusion . 
  many are . 
  in sweden very many immigrants work in the healthcare system . 
  op has previously posted these types of links on reddit before . 
   there are tons of things that i hate about the culture of many immigrants that come here . 
  bigotry among muslims ( or anybody ) is not a part of their culture . 
  it 's like hating american culture because of how some people are in the bible belt . 
  i know plenty of ( young ) muslims who have very liberal or libertarian opinions on how society should be ruled . 
  every generation that passes becomes more secular , liberal , and possibly atheist .
