  with romania joining the schengen area it might add another obstacle for deportation . 
  also there will be nothing stopping them from coming back once if they 're deported . 
  the fact that you brought up death camps is disgusting . 
  the death camps we 've had in europe is our greatest shame . 
  here are solutions which actually seem to work . 
  since are now romani beggars are a european problem and not only a romanian one all eu countries + countries it cooperates with should help fund such programs which can be extended further to help homeless people and young people having problems finding a new home . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7va_pemhcsm https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfczf0zzudm edit : the homeless people in the winter i mention are natives . 
   this lacks logic and could be applied to almost any law at any time . 
  what makes you think it will be abused any more than any other law ? 
  this bans beggars . 
  if the romani beggars leave then only norwegian ones remain and the police are n't allowed to discriminate . 
  it 's almost as saying as scottish people are english because they live in the uk . 
  how daft are you ? 
  you ca n't take me seriously ? 
  you do n't seem to grasp the concept that romanians and romani people are different . 
  you also naively think that there is not a single norwegian beggar because the vast majority are romani . 
  my `` agenda '' is that the proposed law might not work and the side effect can be that beggars who are norwegian will have it worse since the police are n't allowed to discriminate . 
  ** especially ** if all the romani beggars start begging somewhere else since then there will ** only ** be norwegian beggars . 
  i 'm sorry that my critical thinking ability questions such a controversial law and thinks multiple steps ahead instead of the mind of a sheep which is unable to do so . 
  are n't uk businesses pushing against leaving the eu ? 
  in other news , water is still wet . 
  i seriously do n't understand how that concept is so hard to grasp . 
  i 'll try to simplify my concern with such a law since you do n't seem to have understood . 
  i 'm fully aware that the intent of the law is to curb romani beggars . 
  however , there are no guarantees that the law will work . 
  regardless if the law works or not , especially if it does , what is there to stop the police to abuse the law for people who it 's not intended to affect ? 
  obviously the countries are different but you must be naive to believe that beggars who are n't romani do n't exist at all . 
  an important note : they are of [ romanian nationality ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lahhncfa7ni ) on paper but [ they are a different people ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romani_people ) . 
  similar to how many [ lapps ( sami people ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sami_people ) do n't consider themselves swedish , norwegian , russian or finnish even if they have that passport . 
  i live in stockholm and for at least 2 weeks straight ( if not more ) i saw a swedish man begging in the same place every day on my way to uni . 
  just because they are in the minority does n't mean they do n't exist . 
  it 's naive to believe these people do n't exist in norway . 
  please answer my questions . 
  how will such a ban help them once the roma beggars are gone ( assuming the ban works ) ? 
  literally the first person on the video is norwegian . 
  why is n't he helped ? 
  how will banning begging benefit people like him especially if the ban works ? 
  what the un thinks is irrelevant , we have our own definitions of refugees which is what matters to us . 
  i 'll believe that somalia has a functioning if you can show it to me . 
  also you 're forgetting that many people are leaving sweden . 
  and i never said we 're obliged to accept refugees . 
  but it 's cruel and heartless to turn someone down who has traveled very far who might die .

  these people are immigrate to work ( and their relations ) , adoptive children , ees citizens and students . 
  39,671 immigrants are refugees and similar . 
   we also do n't have any obligation to allow these people in , or any obligation to pay for them . 
  it 's pretty inhumane to send a person who has traveled all the way from syria back into a warzone . 
  it 's not an obligation but it 's the right thing to do . 
  i do n't know the exact minimum requirements since i do n't work there and i 'm not a lawyer . 
  information on more specifics is available in this links . 
  http://www.migrationsverket.se/privatpersoner/skydd-och-asyl-i-sverige/asylregler.html as far as i 've understood the government appoints the director of the board . 
  the current one does n't have any political affiliations and is the former general director of the secret police . 
  the one before the current one who was n't interim had connections to the social democrats but was appointed under a conservative government . 
  a government minister or parliament can not tell a government agency on how they should rule on decisions . 
  if there would be a law voted which would for example limit asylums at 20,000 it would be in an extremely gray area ( and in my opinion unconstitutional ) since it 's very precise and while it 's not a direct decision for one certain case ( ex . 
  do not let john smith in ) it 's de-facto deciding all cases after the 20,000 asylum seeker . 
  this scenario basically significantly reduces the influence of that government agency which is undesired . 
  how are meant to work is that the parliaments votes on a law which allows the government agency to rule in a certain way . 
  for example the parliament has voted that if you 're prosecuted for being homosexual the agency must take that into consideration when giving someone asylum . 
  this gives the agency the freedom to grant asylum to those people . 
  a gross simplification would be that the parliament sets guidelines for the government agency but ca n't gives orders . 
  so you 're against bringing your own children and spouse the country you 're living in or fleeing to ? 
  anh\u00f6righetsinvandring is not exclusive to people who are coming from the third world but also to non-eu ( such as americans ) who moves to sweden to work or people who are marrying a foreigner ( which has happened multiple times in my family ) . 
  the fact that some people abuse the system is bad . 
  there is not much i can say about that besides people try cheat any systems which are in place to gain an advantage ( ex . 
  unemployment and tax-evasion ) . 
  you literally did n't read the second sentence . 
  to answer the question the answer is no . 
  you have to consider that sweden is not a neighboring country to syria or iraq . 
  it 's a lot harder for them to come here than to go to turkey another country which is a lot closer . 
  the reason there is n't a limit is because the swedish migration board has to interpret the laws which exist and it 's unconstitutional for them to take any orders from cabinet . 
  this applies to all government agencies , the reason it is like this is in-order to decrease corruption from the ruling government . 
  i 'm absolutely against changing the constitution in order to set a limit immigration because it potentially allows for more government corruption . 
  the immigrants which the far-right dislike are generally asylum-seekers and more recently the roma . 
  we have a set amount of criteria and anyone who fulfills them is granted asylum ( or similar ) . 
  however , there are some exceptions . 
  the most notable ones are jews from ww2 , iraqis when america invaded them and syria today . 
  as far as i 've understood it 's a lot easier for those people to gain asylum because the laws for them are relaxed under a certain period time because of war and because to cut bureaucracy since they are usually in larger numbers . 
  these refugees would have most likely been granted asylum anyway since they fulfill the necessary criteria if i 've understood this correctly . 
  here are some pdfs where you can look at the trends and spikes yourself . 
  [ 2013 decisions , during the civil war in syria ] ( http://www.migrationsverket.se/download/18.7c00d8e6143101d166dda8/1390234104754/avgjorda+asyl%c3%a4renden+2013+-+asylum+desicions+2013.pdf ) [ 2010 , pre-syrian civil war ] ( http://www.migrationsverket.se/download/18.5e83388f141c129ba6312c94/1381926428352/avgjorda+asyl%c3%a4renden+2010+-+asylum+decisions+2010.pdf ) [ less specific data from 1984 to 2013 , see iraq or bosnia and montenegro ] ( http://www.migrationsverket.se/download/18.36084ac214622cf6599de2/1402659624832/asyls%c3%b6kande+till+sverige+1984-2013.pdf ) something else which should be noted is that it is unconstitutional for ministers to tell the swedish migration board to on how they should rule on certain decisions since they are independent of the parliament/cabinet . 
  [ see ministerstyre ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ministerstyre ) honestly i do n't see how anyone can be in favor of sending refugees ( specifically the groups i mentioned ) back into warzones and in areas where there is ethnic cleansing . 
  no but they fight in wars which have nothing to do with them or their country . 
  it 's sad . 
  but i do n't think that they should be punished for it ( ex . 
  stripping citizenship ) . 
  as someone else said in this thread we 've had citizens do similar things before . 
  the french foreign legion works in a similar way . 
  the anger in this thread,
