  but i guess all politicians do that but the far-right is especially talented at doing that . 
  it 's most likely not going to pass . 
  plus i 'd guess this would replace some other benefits if it would pass . 
  depends what place and on what day, 
  she might be left out because she has to be 18 to enter bars and clubs . 
  i hope the turnout rates for these kinds of referendums are high ( +75 % ) and not just people who have very strong feelings regarding the topic go and vote .

  is a minority government possible in germany ? 
  while i agree with you the swedish foreign policy ( should be ) is based on that we are n't in an alliance when we 're at peace and neutral in war . 
  while i think bildt is in love with the us and enjoys bending over for them . 
  i doubt that he is a spy . 
  i lived in northern italy . 
  some ultras can be really bad . 
  like the roma ones pretending to be lazio ultras and then attack spurs supporters . 
  have you seen lazio 's `` sponsor '' on their kit this season ? 
  how is it not a platform ? 
  is n't this one of the most important opinions which the nationalist party have compared to other parties where this is a minor issue ? 
  there there are also bi-sexuals and people who prefer only a certain person out of an entire gender , etc. 
  it 's difficult to measure because who gets to decide where the line is drawn for sexual orientation ?

  if he was so concerned about his karma he should n't have compared it with others . 
  comparing ~ ~ e-peen ~ ~ karma with other people and generally being very impolite . 
  he was acting like he was 12 . 
  he told people who do n't post links do n't contribute to reddit . 
  op was being a dick to everyone, 
  baltic nations : we like nato membership, 
  you 're getting too excited about useless internet points . 
  why do you care about karma ? 
  he probably writes good comments or participates in more circlejerks which are healthy for him . 
  also i do not have to introduce myself to you . 
  my username and flair are good enough for you . 
  you seem to post awful lot . 
  do you by any chance get paid for it ?

  the only part of the great northern war we speak about . 
  please do n't downvote me but i do n't understand anything of this, 
  it was on instagram, 
   the youngest member of parliment in history has said he will resign , due to people not voting for his legislations . 
  incorrect . 
  he wants to resign because in his opinion politicians are n't voting for new legislations . 
   except our own media has tactly admitted they prefer to downplay crime down by immigrants . 
  ( as if it was n't apparent by white-pixling ) assuming you 're swedish then you very well know why they downplay it . 
  they do n't want to be associated with racists , racism , sweden democrats and similar . 
  every single news article which has to do with immigration which has a comment field gets bombarded with distasteful comments . 
  go cry me a river . 
  afaik the faces are pixelated because they are still a suspect and not guilty . 
  imagine if you were innocent and then media shows your face to the entire world labeling you a criminal for the rest of your life . 
  the only people who speak about `` whitepixling '' are sweden democrats . 
  take a good guess why faces may be brighter when blurred . 
   yet they still manage to account for a vast overrepresentation in the crime statistics . 
  have you considered thinking why this is happening ? 
  what other socioeconomic factors are involved ? 
  what can we as a society do to prevent crime ? 
  anyhow , if you 've been looking at the statistics of where the crimes are committed one can see it is in areas where either the sweden democrats are strong and/or where there are many non-whites . 
  the politicians do n't really give a damn about this . 
  why ? 
  because many of the victims ( i 'd suspect the majority ) of the crimes committed by immigrants or `` second generation '' are immigrants and `` second generation '' themselves . 
  the point i am making is that the vast majority are not criminal and do n't have any malicious intentions . 
  / r/worldnews is a massive anti-muslim circlejerk , most probably filled with people who have never met a muslim and only seen them portrayed as terrorists , and anyone who can think knows this . 
  you 're missing the point . 
  crime involving ordinary white people does n't sell as well as crimes involving non-white people . 
  it is media hype and i 've never said they were n't over-represented . 
  i might be a bit blunt ? 
  i do n't really care for upvotes and downvotes as long my comments are n't censored . 
  i 'm not surprised at all . 
  was the school you attended in a rural area or close to a small city ? 
  tell your friend i went in a school with overrepresented amounts of immigrants and/or `` second generation '' swedes and the worst thing that happened was at one point someone kept pressing the fire alarm three times a day . 
  sensationalism . 
  crimes involving muslims , foreigners or any non-whites sells well , one can easily see how much that thread is commented in comparison to the other ones in / r/worldnews . 
  the vast majority are peaceful and do n't want any harm . 
  they 're a lot more similar to us than what media , including reddit , portray them as . 
  the reason there is so much hate in that thread is because the reddit hivemind has decided long time ago that muslims and islam is bad .
