  the percentage value suggests it might be referring to this , from the top post in the [ eli5 thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3a53q0/eli5_whats_going_on_with_greece/ ) :  the troika forced private borrowers and greek pension funds which held greek debt bonds to accept a 50 % reduction in the value of the bonds they held . 
  my understanding of economics is pretty rudimentary , but a 50 % reduction in the value of the pension bonds sounds sounds like something that , as long as cost of living remains unchanged , would be more likely to force an increase in government spending on pensions rather than reducing it . 
  of course , it 's said that the greek gdp has shrunk by about 1/3 , so any real increase of the sums would be much more marginal than the percentages suggest . 
  as with most of the claims regarding what has been going on at the negotiations , there seems so be little concrete evidence either way to point at , at least i do n't know of any . 
  but it is something that varoufakis has stated consistently , and i have not yet seen anyone who attended these meetings calling it out as a lie . 
  here it is in his [ filmed talk with joseph stiglitz ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy3qxm6boui ) on april 9 :  these are just some examples . 
  i could go on forever , because we have a very long list of reforms that we want . 
  but we 're very keen to begin implementing them - yesterday . 
  the problem with the current negotiations is that everything is on hold until the negotiations are finished . 
  it is our considered opinion that that should n't have been the case . 
  that we could start implementing the reforms , and we are keen to do this , while the negotiations take place . 
  the reforms that we can all agree on . 
  begin with the low hanging fruit , and then move on to the higher hanging fruit . 
  hopefully you just mean the submission and not the subreddit , or that you 'll reconsider when your mood gets better . 
  i have appreciated your presence on these topics i hope it will continue . 
  in the meantime , i have made an attempt at submitting the tagesspiegel link . 
  let 's see how it goes . 
  a new attempt since naurgul 's earlier submission was delisted for not using the correct title , trying to bring attention to an important quote . 
  here it is with some additional context , from page 2 :  ** we are talking a lot about your struggle with the creditors . 
  this struggle seems to take up so much of your attention and time , so that the government does n't seem to have energy left for domestic affairs -- to change some things in the structure of the greek state you criticized yourself before the elections . 
  **  the most frustrating part is that these negotiations are taking up all our energy and time . 
  and moreover : the institutions are telling us , if we legislate before we reached a comprehensive agreement this will be seen as a unilateral action and it will blow up the negotiations . 
  one of the very first things i said to my eurogroup colleagues was : why do n't we push some of the legislation we agree on -- the taxation system , the anti-corruption rules -- through parliament and meanwhile continue the negotiations . 
  and i was actually told a number of times if i dare to suggest this again this would constitute reason to settle the negotiations . 
  i agree , it goes into a bit more detail than anything i 've seen before on one of the most annoying misconceptions in these threads . 
  and it 's unfortunate that it 's hidden on page 2 of an interview with an unengaging title and a somewhat difficult start . 
  but if it 's the only way to get the interview through here , it 's worth a try . 
  as gerrit8500 suggested , it might still help to put the quote in the comments to make it more visible . 
  it looks like it , i ca n't see it anymore . 
  if it has been and remains removed , i would suggest submitting the tagesspiegel interview directly , [ since it 's in english on their site as well ] ( http://www.tagesspiegel.de/weltspiegel/in-english/yanis-varoufakis-interview-we-crossed-a-lot-of-our-red-lines/11890142.html ) . 
  it has a less sensational title than euractiv , if a bit nondescript . 
  it 's a good interview and deserves to be read . 
  by ambiguous i 'm referring to the fact that this hand sign has multiple valid interpretations , not that he did n't understand it . 
  [ supporters say it 's a sign of sympathy with the victims , critics that it 's implies indirect support for the brotherhood . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rabia_sign ) since he appears to be a supporter , it 's likely his interpretation was the former . 
  but you 're right that i got the sides of the conflict mixed up . 
  it 's true that he was chairman for young muslims of sweden 2000-2002 , but this organisation seems much less controversial than kaplan himself . 
  the wikipedia page on it does n't mention the muslim brotherhood , and does n't even have the otherwise common section about controversies or an active discussions tab . 
  it 's just the main swedish organisation for young muslims . 
  [ if you try to google these two organisations ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=%22sveriges+unga+muslimer%22+%22muslimska+br%c3%b6draskapet%22 ) , the results are sparse enough that it 's a mix of irrelevant pages often missing mention of one or the other organisations , and xenophobic polemics making unsubstantiated claims that `` the youth organisation sveriges unga muslimer ( sum ) has * some * connections to the muslim brotherhood '' . 
  i have no investment in this man , and it was probably good riddance regardless of his affiliations , so if there is a good source of him actually being islamist , i would actually like to know it . 
  but then again , that would be an actual scoop : if there was any tangible evidence on kaplan actually being islamist , it would most assuredly be front page news , considering how the press has been grasping at every straw around him this past week . 
   rab3a , is a hand gesture and a sign that first appeared in late august 2013 in social media and protest marches in egypt . 
  it is used by the muslim brotherhood and its supporters in egypt in the wake of the overthrow of mohamed morsi , which occurred after anti-government protests calling for his removal . 
  [ ... ] supporters state that the gesture is used to express solidarity with what they call `` the thousands wounded , killed and burnt by the egyptian army '' during the dispersal of their sit-in . 
  the origin of the sign is unknown . 
  it 's another instance of poor judgement , but i would n't agree that an ambiguous hand sign is enough to say that he 's islamist , he was a minister , very much a public figure , and islamism is a pretty extreme view of the world . 
  unless there 's something more substantial , it looks more to me like a misguided attempt to show solidarity with the protest movement against morsi . 
  are you talking about mehmet kaplan ? 
  he is many things , but i would like to see some source on him actually being islamist , because that was never revealed in the series of scandals that finally got him to step down . 
  had he been exposed as an islamist he would of course have been forced out immediately . 
  as it stands , the media analysis seems to think his biggest downfall in this instance might have been his failure at crisis management . 
  edit : seems like no sources existed after all , judging by the frustrated reception to my inquiry . 
  both are used , though `` katastrof '' is probably more common when referring to natural disasters , since we call them `` naturkatastrofer '' . 
  ( which is interesting , since `` disaster '' seems more common than `` catastrophe '' in the same context . ), 
  but one example to show how `` olycka '' is used place of `` disaster '' , is that the fukushima disaster is known in swedish as [ fukushima-olyckan ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/fukushima-olyckan ) . 
  she * did * actually call it a disaster . 
  `` olycka '' can be translated as both `` accident '' and `` disaster '' . 
  [ swedish suggestions for `` disaster '' ] ( http://tyda.se/search/disaster?lang%5b0%5d=en&amp;lang%5b1%5d=de&amp;lang%5b2%5d=sv ) [ english suggestions for `` olycka '' ] ( http://tyda.se/search/olycka?lang%5b0%5d=en&amp;lang%5b1%5d=de&amp;lang%5b2%5d=sv ) though `` disaster '' just as `` olycka '' usually suggests `` a sudden accident or a natural catastrophe '' , it does n't seem controversial to use it in regards to 9/11 ( lots of google results , and the event is included on wikipedias `` disaster portal '' ) . 
  `` olycka '' has a broader definition tough , and is probably most commonly used in regards to traffic accidents ( `` trafikolycka '' ) , so it sounds a bit odd . 
  it 's also close to the milder `` olycksh\u00e4ndelse '' ( `` unfortunate mishap '' ? 
  ) , which probably adds to this . 
  so while it clearly was n't the best wording she could have come up with , it was a gaffe on live morning tv , and the word still has `` disaster '' among it 's suggested translations , which despite the same connotations seems to be an acceptable word in this context . 
  also , there is also nothing that i 'm aware of that suggests that this choice of words might be indicative of any actual controversial opinion on her part on the event . 
  it 's really mostly in the news because the political party that she represents is being in hot water in swedish media this week . 
  you might have seen headlines these last days about her minister mehmet kaplan . 
  this is the media trying to keep this series of exposes going . 
  edit : it might also be worth pointing out , when trying to clear up the nuances , that `` olycka '' is strictly a negative word in swedish , whereas `` accident '' is more neutral . 
  there 's no way to use `` olycka '' to describe a happy accident . 
  the old swedish academy book of words defines olycka as `` more concretely , about a single event or circumstance that causes someone suffering or harm or material destuction . '', 
  this is an old definition ( printed 1950 ) , but it 's still worth taking into consideration . 
  yeah , the first image might be a bit less representative because of the altitude , it 's xirolivado above veroia . 
  i was trying to think of a place with more familiar architecture , but still keeping some of the magic that the photo album was going for , and i thought of this place that i visited last year . 
  here 's the view when we drove in on a cloudier day : http://i.imgur.com/bmbahn4.jpg, 
  similarly , it would be nice to see greece represented by something else than the usual santorini view . 
  having never really been out to the islands , these are closer to my experience of the greek village : [ 1 ] ( https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ft-8vkz1vew/vtnn_95kdyi/aaaaaaaarts/9bx9gglqcmw/s1600/%25ce%25bb1.jpg ) [ 2 ] ( http://static.pblogs.gr/f/448755-pasxa%20031.jpg ) [ 3 ] ( https://travelmoreandmore.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/cam00063.jpg ) using google image to find these photos , it was pretty funny to see the the difference in results depending on whether you search for greek villages in english or greek . 
  [ `` greek village '' ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=greek+village&amp;tbm=isch ) [ '' \u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03c7\u03c9\u03c1\u03b9\u03cc '' ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=%ce%b5%ce%bb%ce%bb%ce%b7%ce%bd%ce%b9%ce%ba%cf%8c+%cf%87%cf%89%cf%81%ce%b9%cf%8c&amp;tbm=isch ), 
   they just do n't have enought people to dub every tv show or movie . 
  this is part of it , but there 's also a big aversion to dubbed media here , it 's regarded as lower quality content . 
  documentaries usually get away with having the voice-over dubbed , and children 's shows are dubbed , but dub anything else and people will protest . 
  when they tried to start dubbing the simpsons in 1993 to make it more available to kids , there was enough of an uproar to still merit two paragraphs on the simpsons page on swedish wikipedia , and it only lasted a few episodes . 
  for comparison , swedish public television ran daytime programs for immigrant children from the 70s to the 90s , in the `` spr\u00e5ka '' series . 
  [ here 's part of a greek `` spr\u00e5ka p\u00e5 grekiska '' segment from 1984 . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axah6ac6amq ) the most prevalent , or at least most visible to those who grew up in the 80s and 90s , was the serbocroatian segment `` spr\u00e5ka p\u00e5 serbokroatiska '' . 
  * [ intro december 1983 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7n6ns9gq74g ) * [ intro easter 1986 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2czhhy5qxqk ) * whole episode 1989 , [ part 1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csmmft6g00y ) , [ part 2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkcawie2jji ) these days we have the public radio channel p6 , `` radio sweden '' , which broadcasts in foreign and minority languages . 
  looks like it currently broadcasting a finnish program . 
  the channel for classical , art , jazz and folk music ( p2 ) also has a half hour segment each evening with alternating programs in romani , english and arabic . 
  the swedish public radio general website has the option `` news in other languages '' , with options of arabic , english , finnish , kurdish , me\u00e4nkieli , persian , romani , russian , s\u00e1mi , somali , somali and german . 
  this option also has links to radio sweden , radio sweden 's page in `` easy swedish '' , and the p4 program klartext , a news program with slower tempo and easier words . 
  it 's no secret that newspapers use staged photos regularly , to illustrate stories they do n't have direct footage from . 
  it 's often indicated by the paper itself under such photos ( and i would agree that it 's good practice to always put a disclaimer on staged photographs ) . 
  fraud would have been if the actual story accompanying the photo was also made up , but there are enough real news of refugees drowning that that seems very unlikely . 
  the only ethical dilemma i get from this is that it might be cruel to ask destitute survivors of the sea in particular to play-act drowning . 
  depending on how the deal went down . 
  well , one reason israel is singled out is because of its relation with the west , and because of its staunch defenders . 
  israel stands out in the level of support it receives from the west , and criticizing it is often also criticizing your own international policies . 
  saudi arabia * is * also condemned by the left , for the same reason . 
  especially in the wake of 9/11 , it was often pointed out how the iraq was invaded as a retaliation for terrorism originating from the us-allied fundamentalist saudis . 
  but since there was no-one willing to defend saudi arabia , this critique did n't gain the visibility of the clashes between israeli denouncers and supporters . 
  the rest of the problem states are n't as relevant to battle against since it 's already agreed that they are repressive , and there are no diplomatic attempts to sweep it under the rug .
