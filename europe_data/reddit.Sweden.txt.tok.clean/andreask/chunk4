  ( of course , in the context of this thread , the oxford left in particular seems to have passed the territory of level-headed policy critique ), 
  there seems to be an unlabeled dot in greece as well ? 
  and is there a reason why poland 's text is black ? 
  while attempted arson is committed practically every year , you 're correct in that the goat is n't always burned down , which the title suggests . 
  both [ the swedish wikipedia page ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/g%c3%a4vlebocken ) and [ the less extensive english one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/g%c3%a4vle_goat ) has lists showing the years that the goat survived . 
  it did so last year , as the article mentions , and in 2010 , 2007 , 2006 , 2002 ... the list goes on . 
  most of these years there are failed attempts at arson though . 
  the exceptions in `` recent '' years are 2007 , when no attempts were registered , though the english wikipedia list points out that another smaller g\u00e4vle goat was toppled and burned this year . 
  before that was in 1996 , the first year that the goat had webcam surveillance , and nothing happened . 
  even with such new technology , i remember this resulting in a very dull goat cam experience . 
  i quite like the big ones from sweden . 
  before that it used to be a song about [ \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%96sterg%c3%b6tland ) and there is speculation on the wikipedia page that it might be related to the 16th century song `` o , nederland !, 
  let op u saeck '' , [ which sounds very likely to me ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkubzgusedy ) . 
  anyway , there are of course lots of recorded versions of this . 
  the definitive version is probably [ jussi bj\u00f6rling 's recoring from 1936 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxppmyyjl-g ) , where he sings the 1846 version . 
  a translation is available on lyricstranslate [ here ] ( http://lyricstranslate.com/en/ack-vaermeland-du-skoena-oh-vaermeland-you-fair.html ) . 
  a less grandiose version was recorded in 2000 by freddie wadling and stina nordenstam , and can be heard [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8rib0nneog ) , where they sing the 1822 version . 
  unfortunately i ca n't seem to find a translation of it . 
  uti v\u00e5r hage ( `` in our pasture '' ) , of unknown origin , was first transcribed on [ gotland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gotland ) in 1880 , and is these days usually sung at valborgsm\u00e4ssoafton ( the swedish walpurgis night celebrations ) . 
  the lyrics concerns a meeting of a loved one in the pasture , and a common claim is that the herbs repeated throughout the song are supposed to be contraceptives from swedish folk medicine . 
  the wikipedia page mentions this , but points out that there 's no clear verdict on this matter . 
  while it 's often heard live , i know of no go-to recordings of this , and most of what i find seems to be [ choir recordings ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqtdc1k9trk ) , so for a more personal touch i 'll give you [ a version sung by helena espvall ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyuhjzgc1py ) of the espers . 
  an english translation is available on lyricstranslate [ here ] ( http://lyricstranslate.com/en/uti-v%c3%a5r-hage-our-pasture.html ) . 
  whatever you 've read about islam being taught in swedish public schools , what you 're describing is what it 's referring to . 
  teaching * about * religion , alongside judaism , hinduism , etc. 
  as belief systems and traditions existing in the world . 
  the swedish public school is not teaching faith , and if a teacher did , it would cause an uproar . 
  there are religious private schools ( `` friskolor '' , usually christian ) that are allowed to have a religious profile , but the actual education is still required to be non-religious , follow the same education plan and be aligned with the same value-ground ( ? 
  `` v\u00e4rdegrund '' ) as the rest of the school system . 
  there has been an ongoing debate about these , but it 's argued that they are protected by the european convention of human rights . 
  that is the reason , and it sounds very similar : in sweden it 's limited to government stores , in turkey it 's limited to licensed stores . 
  unlicensed selling in gift bags seems to have been accepted in turkey , but now stopped . 
  [ attempts at unlicensed selling is regularly cracked down on in sweden . 
  ] ( http://www.goteborgdaily.se/new-rules-to-stop-sale-of-rice-wine ) that is at least what it sounds like in the article : `` some businesses without the required liquor licenses prepare the baskets anyway and the regulation would put an end to this practice . '', 
  so in both cases you would have to get your basked from a licensed shop , or get the alcohol separately from there and put it in the basket yourself . 
  to be fair , selling gift baskets containing alcoholic beverages in supermarkets is prohibited in sweden as well . 
   the terrorist label implies that the act is primarily to change the policies of the country - even if people are murdered or hurt in order to send the message . 
  his suicide letter actually matches your definition of terrorism pretty well . 
   in the letter the 21-year-old wrote that he `` has to do something about the immigration policy '' and that he was prepared to die in the attack . 
  [ translated from ( aftonbladet ) ] ( http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article21635063.ab ), 
   and why do you expect to ? 
  because that 's what the comment above was describing . 
  if you want to address the validity of this , it would make more sense to do it there . 
  i have n't seen the movie . 
  the water diviner is indeed a controversial movie . 
  here 's some context from [ the wikipedia page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_water_diviner#critical_response ) :  calls for a protest and boycott of the movie on social media resulted in the facebook page `` protest and boycott the water diviner '' which has over 16,000 fans . 
  [ 20 ] descendants of victims of the greco-turk exchanges , armenian genocide and assyrian genocide were incensed by the portrayal of the turks in the movie as victims , at the same time that turks were committing atrocities on their minorities . 
  the omission and distortion of historical facts resulted in a sustained protest letter campaign which claimed that the film '' . . is a distortion of history that only serves to appease turkey and its continued agenda of genocide denial . '', 
  [ 21 ] the protest letter and other protests of the film were covered in a fairfax media report . 
  [ 22 ]  anthony mcadam of the spectator wrote : `` leaving aside aesthetic considerations , the fact is the film 's lack of any historical context is breathtaking . '', 
  mcadam notes that there is one `` glaring omission '' in the film , that being the lack of any mention whatsoever of the armenian genocide . 
  [ 23 ] andrew o'hehir of the salon describes the film as `` russell crowe 's disgraceful turkish fantasy '' . 
  o'hehir questions why crowe and warner bros. released the film in the us on 24 april , precisely the same day that armenians commemorate the armenian genocide and compares it to releasing a film which ignores the jewish holocaust and is released on yom hashoah . 
  [ 24 ] i also see nothing about fleeing the greek army on [ the kayak\u00f6y wikipedia page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kayak%c3%b6y ) , which instead gives this explanation :  at the ending of the greco-turkish war ( 1919 -- 1922 ) , kayak\u00f6y was already completely abandoned . 
  the persecutions of livissi inhabitants as well as greeks of nearby makri , were part of the wider campaign against all ottoman greeks and other christians of the empire . 
  the persecutions in the area started in 1914 in makri . 
  in 1916 , a letter in greek addressing to sir alfred biliotti , the consul general of great britain at rhodes , explained the murders and persecution of livissi and macri greeks who asked him for intervention . 
  unfortunately , the letter was intercepted at livissi by turkish authorities . 
  later that same year , many families of levissi were deported and driven on foot to denizli , around 220 km away . 
  there , they suffered various extreme atrocities and tortures , facing even death . 
  [ 3 ]  two more exile phases followed in 1917 and 1918 . 
  [ 4 ] in 1917 , families were sent in villages near denizli , such as ac\u0131payam , through forced march of fifteen days , consisting mainly of the elderly , women and children , who had remained in the area . 
  during that death march , the roads were strewn with bodies of dead children and the elderly who succumbed to hunger and fatigue . 
  the exiles of the next year were no less harsh . 
  in september 1922 , the few remaining greeks of livissi and makri abandoned their homes and embarked on ships to greece . 
  some of them founded nea makri ( new makri ) in attica . 
  is there any of source to your claim that this is yanis launching a political movement ? 
  it 's a very vague video with the message `` the 1101 are coming '' , and the only clear connection to varoufakis is that at one point his face flashes by . 
  ( among many others ) i can find no mention of it on his homepage , and no mention on his twitter . 
  the extent of the discussion on / r/greece where this was reposted is that `` i think you are confused , this is no political movement , it is gon na be some kind of tv show that nobody know the theme ( some dont even care at this point ) '' with the reply `` yea im not sure if its for real '' . 
  the only thing i can find on google news is [ an article on greek reporter ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/10/08/varoufakis-video-hints-at-creation-of-new-political-movement-in-greece/ ) that is pure speculation on the purpose of the video . 
  where in the video did you see that ? 
  i might be blind , but i just checked again , and as far as i can tell that 's op 's addition . 
  all i saw was a `` the 1101 are coming '' video , where one of the many faces was yanis . 
  nice one , found it on youtube [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osdtr5o6m24 ) . 
  english translation available in the comments . 
  * `` full 11 tons / with fragrant cannabis '' * a personal favorite among greek smuggler songs is [ \u0397\u03c1\u03c9\u03af\u03bd\u03b7 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bc\u03b1\u03c5\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlslikxmzxw ) , though it 's smuggling on a smaller scale . 
  ( english translation available here too with a click on `` view all replies '' on slavoichs comment . ), 
   also , why is sweden not the first by a long shot ? 
  i have no idea whether we should be , but it 's worth noting that this does n't chart the balance between the sexes , but only total hours , which brings up different factors : * some of the comments reminded me that having your own house means a lot more housework . 
  [ sweden has a mostly urban apartment-dwelling population , 87.3 % compared to slovenias 50.5 % ] ( http://www.geohive.com/earth/pop_urban.aspx ) . 
  that sounds like a lot of extra grass cutting and house fixing . 
  ( denmark is even more urban than us though , at 89.2 % ) * pretty much every apartment complex up here has its own collective laundry room . 
  judging by [ the wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tv%c3%a4ttstuga ) this might not be as common outside of sweden/finland ? 
  it means that pretty much every swede has access to washing machines , tumble dryers and drying cabinets , which might not be the case everywhere . 
  * sweden is pretty well-off , which probably cuts down on chores a bit i general . 
  dishwashers seems to be very common here nowadays . 
  families might eat out/buy home more often when they do n't feel like cooking . 
  and so on . 
  this is a hunch that i do n't have any data on though . 
  * we 're in the part of europe where it 's obligatory for anyone entering a home to take off their shoes , which should also cut down on vacuuming needs . 
  true , `` viking '' is also a somewhat vague term . 
  i just used it in the context of the comment i was replying to . 
  i would think that a complete switch to slavic culture might have been more gradual than the quick switch in naming might suggest , these - slavs continued to intermingle with scandinavian rulers . 
  yaroslav was married to ingegerd , daughter of swedish king olof sk\u00f6tkonung , and their daughter became queen consort of norway , married to harald hardrada . 
  the great-grandson of yaroslav , mstislav i vladimirovich the great , was married to christina ingesdotter , daughter of swedish king inge the elder , and their daughter became queen consort of norway and denmark , married to sigurd the crusader . 
  i have no more insight into this region than the lineage though , this could mean nothing . 
  but it raises questions for me about the idea of the quick `` slavization '' . 
  ( fun fact that i came across while putting this together , about another grand-daughter of yaroslav the wise and ingegerd of sweden : `` eupraxia of kiev [ ... ] became notorious all over europe for her divorce from the holy roman emperor henry iv on the grounds that he had attempted a black mass on her naked body . '' ), 
  depending on what one might read into `` slavenized '' , it should be clear that there is no break between these rulers and viking rule : they are all decendants of rurik , sviatoslav being his grandson .
