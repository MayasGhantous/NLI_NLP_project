  yeah , i ca n't figure out how this is calculated . 
  since the article focuses on new parents , perhaps it only counts the days that parents chose take out immediately after childbirth ? 
  sweden has 480 days leave shared among the parents ( with 90 days reserved for each ) which is clearly also at odds with the numbers in this chart . 
  i believe these days are available until the child turns eight . 
  if part of it is used at a later date perhaps this graph does n't count it ? 
  [ another perspective with a map visualization from npr .

  2 ) this is not strictly true . 
  if you 're talking about france 's law in particular only one person so far seems to have been jailed for this offense ( twice , with two other deniers receiving suspended sentences ) . 
  since you 're writing `` holocaust denial laws '' in plural , it should also be clarified that this is even less true in europe generally . 
  the [ english wikipedia article on the jailed frenchman ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vincent_reynouard ) does not mention any additional offenses that might have contributed to this sentencing . 
  here are the jail sentences [ from the prosecutions and convictions section of the wikipedia article on laws against holocaust denial ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/laws_against_holocaust_denial#prosecutions_and_convictions ) : 1998 | ** france ** | 6 months ' imprisonment ( suspended ) 1998 | switzerland | 15 months ' imprisonment ( fled switzerland to avoid sentence ) 1998 | switzerland | 12 months ' imprisonment 1999 | ** france ** | 6 months ' imprisonment ( suspended ) 2000 | switzerland | 1 year 's imprisonment 2006 | austria | 3 years ' imprisonment 2006 | germany | 2 1/2 years ' imprisonment 2007 | germany | 5 years ' imprisonment 2007 | ** france ** | 1 year 's imprisonment 2008 | austria | 6 years ' imprisonment 2008 | germany | 3 1/2 years ' imprisonment 2009 | germany | 5 years ' imprisonment 2009 | germany | 9 months ' imprisonment 2013 | hungary | 18-month suspended jail sentence 2015 | ** france ** | 2 years ' imprisonment 2015 | germany | 10 months ' imprisonment ( looking this up i also happened to notice that the lady sentenced in 2015 was just sent to jail again three days ago , sentenced to 11 months imprisonment without parole . 
  ( link to the local deleted since that domain got the comment automatically removed ) ) ( disclaimer : naturally i have no sympathy at all for the views expressed on this list of crazies , and have left out their names intentionally . 
  i 'll stay out of the debate on whether laws are the right way to approach this , since i 'll be busy for the rest of the day . ), 
  with this level of detail on border movements month to month , i was a bit disappointed in not seeing `` free greece '' appearing from early 1943 onward , the partisan liberated parts that held elections and instituted their own parallel government . 
  a good reason for this omission might be lack of clear border data : i tried and failed to find some sort of clear map to complement the video . 
  still , it 's worth a brief mention in relation to this video . 
  wikipedia mentions this only briefly , on the article on [ greek resistance ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_resistance#the_establishment_of_.22free_greece.22 ) :  by the late spring of 1943 , the italians were forced to withdraw from several areas . 
  the towns of karditsa , grevena , trikkala , metsovon and others were liberated by july . 
  the axis forces and their collaborators remained in control only of the main towns and the connecting roads , with the interior left to the andartes . 
  this was `` free greece '' , stretching from the ionian sea to the aegean and from the borders of the german zone in macedonia to boeotia , a territory of 30,000 km \u00b2 and 750,000 inhabitants . 
  and in the article on the [ political committee of national liberation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/political_committee_of_national_liberation ) :  the peea 's authority was significantly reinforced after the establishment of the national council in 1944 . 
  the national council was an assembly elected by secret elections organised by the peea in late april 1944 in both the liberated parts of greece and the still-occupied cities , mainly athens . 
  approximately one million people took part in these elections , which are notable for the fact that for the first time in greece , women were allowed to vote . 
  the reason i was looking for this region is that i 'm in the process of finishing mark mazower 's book `` inside hitler 's greece '' , which contains a long interesting chapter on this aspect of the resistance . 
  he starts this chapter with two paragraphs where he provides some additional geographical signpost , and describes the nature of this territory :  the wehrmacht 's extensive anti-guerrilla sweeps failed to prevent eam/elas tightening its hold over a vast , mountainous area which stretched from the gulf of corinth to the yugoslav border , and from the western slopes of the pindos to greece 's eastern coastline . 
  by the middle of 1944 even much of the peloponnese had become a ` state within a state ' , according to general le suire . 
  the germans were increasingly confined to the towns and the main roads between them , and only left the security of their garrisons in armed convoys . 
  stevens , a british soe officer , went so far as to say that ` greece today forms two separate countries , occupied and unoccupied . ', 
  passes were necessary for strangers entering guerrilla-controlled areas , though the precise boundaries with axis-held territory were indeterminate and shifting , marked by blackened houses and burnt fields . 
   inside ` free greece ' eam/elas held sway , with rival bands and organisations like edes challenging its authority only in a few peripheral areas . 
  it organised economic activity , reshaped the judicial and educational system , and introduced social reforms for women . 
  eam officials handled relief for the victims of axis raids and for guerrillas ' dependants ; they brought in a new system of local self-government , and even held national elections in march 1944 . 
  the experience of ` free greece ' , in other words , involved something reaching far beyond provisional military control by the guerrillas ; eam/elas wanted to bring into being a new type of local and national administration . 
  not really , i 'm assuming that your disconnect would be greater if people with any one of your basic attributes seemed noticeably less welcome in the public media space . 
  i do n't really make any demands here , at all , but i would generally expect a rough approximation . 
  trying to perfectly match the demographics would of course be ridiculous , but that in itself is n't necessarily a reason to avoid making adjustments in programming when more noticeable discrepancies appear . 
  in this case the article states that what bbc wants to ensure `` that women will make up half of its staff by 2020 and the number of black , asian and minority ethnic backgrounds will increase to 15 per cent . '', 
  this sounds like an attempt to match the demographics . 
  i do n't know the numbers , but if blacks make up 3 % , it does n't sound unreasonable to have combined ethnic minorities at 15 % . 
  it 's not about being influential , i think in this case it 's about media having the role of being a representation of , and voice of , society . 
  it 's not that strange that asians are apparently overrepresented at caltech and mit ( as another commenter stated ) . 
  it would be much weirder if you turned on the tv and it too was dominated by asians , and the claim that they were simply more qualified would n't quite cut it . 
  in part because the question of qualification is much less clear , in part because we expect tv to in some way represent the population watching it . 
  to take a step back : if you 're on vacation and turn on the hotel room tv , you expect to get some sort of representation of the country you 're visiting . 
  now , if at this same time the asians had the upper hand in politics and business as well , this tv situation would probably add to the alienation , and it might make people question how these qualification were really judged . 
   i literally ca n't remember the last time i turned on the radio to listen to a programme . 
  this naturally mostly affects those still watching tv . 
  did i just get two separate replies from you ? 
  i did start my comment off stating that affirmative action is problematic , that every instance of it needs to be judged on its own merit , and that i was talking specifically about the situation in a national broadcasting company . 
  my comment does n't relate to quotas on teachers or basketball at all . 
  and i 'm not talking specifically about skin colour , i 'm also talking about gender . 
  these are n't my interests , but those already mentioned here ( `` we want to recast with more women and diversity '' -- that the `` diversity '' was racial was assumed by the article we 're reading ) . 
  as i explained at the end , i do n't even know if it 's the right policy in this case , i just think that it 's to easy to dismiss when you 're already represented , and posed a few questions that should probably be considered first - questions that i believe emphasizes the difference between representation in broad national media and , as in your examples , representation in smaller specific fields where qualifications are much more clear . 
  i 'm uncomfortable with affirmative action in general , but every instance needs to be judged on its own merit , and it 's a tricky question when it comes to a national broadcasting company . 
  assuming from your comment that you are a white male : if in a parallel universe the `` best people for the job '' policy had resulted in a media world populated mostly with women of colour , would you still feel as strongly against a diversity target aiming at strengthening the representation of white males ? 
  would it feel as fair that your taxes funded a bbc equally void of white male representation ? 
  would you still feel as much part of society in this world as you do today ? 
  i have no opinion on what 's going on at bbc specifically ( i know too little about it ) , but saying `` fuck diversity targets '' seems too easy when you 're part of the group that 's already being represented . 
  nope , [ about 5000 of the 167k crossing to greece this year has been from iran . 
  ] ( http://data.unhcr.org/mediterranean/country.php?id=83 ), 
  this is n't about driverless cars though , is it ? 
  as far as i understand it tesla 's `` autopilot '' is just an advanced cruise control system that 's not actually intended to replace the driver . 
   consumer activists have called on the company [ ... ] to disable the autopilot feature until it is updated to detect whether the driver 's hands are on the steering wheel during operation , ** as the company says they ought to be . 
  ** naming your cruise control `` autopilot '' might have been a stupid idea in an age where driverless cars are a thing , but driverless cars seems to be doing much better so far . 
  i do n't really have much insight about the background of these numbers , i just noticed that the wrong unhrc link was being thrown around in this discussion . 
  at the very least , they have the exact same validity as the link you used before has for europe . 
  considering the refugee situation , they are naturally not verified . 
  if they required evidence there would be a significant percentage of unknown/unverified ( since they are refugees and have n't necessarily had the time or opportunity to get their papers in order ) . 
  if you click the `` sources and disclaimer '' link it states `` figures collected in the framework of unhcr 's border activities . '', 
  that said , i would think that the numbers from the un refugee agency are among the most reliable that we have to go on . 
  at the very least , if they are to be challenged it should be with numbers to the contrary . 
  regarding your second point , this is a statistic that i do n't happen to be sitting on . 
  but it 's based on the idea that a country needs to be at full on war for a refugee claim to be valid , which is n't really the case . 
  the other countries here has at least the level of unrest that greece had during the junta , when a lot of greeks were rightfully granted asylum around europe . 
  in this case the link was actually first linked to this thread by a user arguing against arathian , so he could have just taken it at face value . 
  i too am uncomfortable with the direction this sub is heading , but this instance is n't necessarily as bad as it might look . 
  regardless , i hope this discussion can at least continue with correct data now . 
  the correct numbers for greece are to be find [ here ] ( http://data.unhcr.org/mediterranean/country.php?id=83 ) , you 're looking at the numbers for the whole of europe . 
  syria + afghanistan make up 73 % of the greek refugee burden , with 48 % from syria alone . 
  ( ping / u/lgbtlibrarian who might also want to see the correct data ), 
  [ here 's ] ( http://data.unhcr.org/mediterranean/country.php?id=83 ) the data from greece specifically . 
  48 % from syria , 88 % are made up of syria + afghanistan + iraq . 
  considering that we are discussing the refugees on lesbos here , i do n't see the relevance european demographics when we have numbers specific to greece . 
  what exactly is your source on that ? 
  http://data.unhcr.org/mediterranean/country.php?id=83 this year 48 % has been from syria and 25 % from afghanistan . 
  11 % total from outside of afghanistan and the syria-iraq region . 
  yeah , turkey was definitely the biggest surprise for me as well . 
  in terms of the financial security of the population , it looks almost on par with crisis-torn greece , which i was n't anticipating at all . 
  i originally intended to post this in a comment to the guardian post [ how happy are you with your city ? 
  eu report data -- in pictures ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/52wblr/how_happy_are_you_with_your_city_eu_report_data/ ) , but when i finished i realized that it was now 22 hours old , so it makes more sense to see if it floats as a separate post . 
  this particular question stood out to me as the most pressing , but the scale in the original eurostat maps bothered me . 
  it showed nuance in the 1-13 % range , using three different colors , and then used a single dark blue for the entire 14-36 % range . 
  so i recolored the dots with a separate gradient step for each percentage , and added the numbers for clarity . 
  at the same time i changed the color scheme , since using red for `` good '' made the map much less intuitive for me . 
  the data is the same as the one used in the original map : the percentage of `` always '' answers on the `` proportion of people who had difficulties paying their bills at the end of the month '' questionaire in 2015 . http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/product?code=urb_percep&amp;language=en&amp;mode=view here again is the original map for comparison : http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/3/30/proportion_of_people_who_have_difficulties_paying_their_bills_at_the_end_of_the_month%2c_2015_%28%c2%b9%29_%28%25%29_cities16.png, 
  it 's a weirdly spread out gang of languages that seems to follow this pattern of counting the days from the sunday until the weekend changes things up . 
  portugal , greece , a region around southern moldova and southwestern ukraine , georgia , armenia , kazakhstan , and the north ossetia , kalmykia and bashkortostan regions in russia . 
  interestingly , a region around southern armenia and south-western azerbaijan seems to have two second days , taking their tuesday from the other more homogeneous group of day-counters . 
  it 's actually orange , though the red and the orange are very similar on this map .
