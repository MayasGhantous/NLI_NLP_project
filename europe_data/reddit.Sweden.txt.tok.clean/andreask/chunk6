  so it 's included in the definition `` from latin ` dominicus ' , ** or similar ** '' . 
  the similarity is of course the meaning `` lord 's day '' , which should probably have been spelled out , as i mention in the edit to my previous comment . 
  well fuck greece , apparently . 
  here they are uncropped , from a translatum thread via google : monday = \u0394\u03b5\u03c5\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1 ( dehftehra ) tuesday = \u03a4\u03c1\u03af\u03c4\u03b7 ( treetee ) wednesday = \u03a4\u03b5\u03c4\u03ac\u03c1\u03c4\u03b7 ( tetartee ) thursday = \u03a0\u03ad\u03bc\u03c0\u03c4\u03b7 ( pemptee ) friday = \u03a0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03c5\u03ae ( paraskevee ) saturday = \u03a3\u03ac\u03b2\u03b2\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf ( savatoh ) sunday = \u039a\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae ( keeriakee ) edit : also , the orange part of sunday should probably have been defined as the lord 's day . 
  it would be more in line with the rest of the map that has a stronger focus on meaning rather than etymology , and the inclusion of greece would make more sense . 
  eh , it 's pretty close to sweden . 
  maybe not all the specifics , but the general attitude . 
  i was enjoying one of the last warm weekend evenings of the year at an outside table here in stockholm the other night , at a place that indeed required an alcohol license to operate , until the staff came over and reminded us that it was nearing 10 o'clock and we had to go inside . 
  so we took our beers inside , enduring the uncomfortably warm and noisy place with a shrug and the common remark that `` well , it 's sweden i guess '' . 
  it 's true that if we enjoyed it we could have stayed util 1am . 
  at that point we could even moved on to one of the few places that has a permit to stay open until 3am , but they turn into hell holes at 01 when everyone flock to them , so we probably would n't have bothered . 
  the exact hours does n't matter much , it 's more about the level of regulation . 
  god forbid spontaneous dancing broke out and the place did n't have a dance permit ( not kidding ) . 
  he 's equally right in that the cars are getting so zealous in stopping for pedestrians that you often find yourself forced to do a little one man show of suddenly needing to go somewhere else every time it would be most convenient for everyone if the car would just pass . 
  i believe i get what / u/supernahta talking about . 
  i 'm too swedish in my mindset to * condone * all of this reckless behavior , generally insisting on using every available seat belt even in a part of the world where it 's considered silly . 
  but at the same time , when for once i go travelling , and when i am being driven home at night after a long summer night of tsipouros , on greek winding mountain road , in the backseat of a car that does n't even have seat belts , driven by a slightly drunk octogenarian who later casually mentions that he 's not actually allowed to drive at all since his seizure , there 's still a very real sense of liberation in venturing outside of the little nordic regulated safety bubble . 
  it might not be optimal , at all , in many ways , but it still feels more like living and not just passing time . 
  also , ireland is most definitely northern europe . 
  [ northern europe is bigger than just the nordics . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_europe ), 
  as others have pointed out , this is not what the referendum was about . 
  the clearest example is that in the most recent election , held two months after the oxi , the pro-euro parties still collectively received 81.05 % of the vote . 
  i nudged the frames around a bit to make the animation slightly less choppy : http://i.imgur.com/ktcvjl7.gifv, 
  more specifically , he 's referring to an event from 2010 . 
  i seem to remember it being treated more as a curiosity since he failed to even injure a single person other than himself . 
  here 's the wikipedia page : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_stockholm_bombings ( i notice that it claims that the first bomb injured two - the [ swedish wikipedia page ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/bombd%c3%a5den_i_stockholm_2010 ) states that `` no one were harmed at these explosions '' . 
  checking news stories from when it happened it seems what happened was that two people were taken to the hospital to have their ears checked after the loud explosion . ), 
  it 's weird to me that the comments are full of sarcastic put-downs of a piece that 's not even pictured in the article . 
  has our disdain for art reached the level where we do n't even need to see it before passing judgement ? 
  this work in question is particularly hard to find good examples of , since he made hundreds of `` reading-work-pieces '' , and the stated year of it 's creation is probably also wrong , since the ones i can find are from early - to mid-60 's , and 1977 is the year of his death . 
  more easily located examples are [ reading work piece no 33 ] ( http://www.artnet.com/artists/arthur-k%c3%b6pcke/reading-work-piece-no-33-kr_y4vhbqfsgm4rieyob4a2 ) , and [ reading work piece no 94 ] ( http://www.artvalue.com/auctionresult--kopcke-arthur-1928-1977-denmar-kopcke-reading-work-piece-no-9-4662986.htm ) . 
  it 's hard to make any judgement on it in this quality , but at least it satisfies the curiosity . 
  and regardless of what i think of it , it 's hard to claim it is n't art if it 's still on display in the museums 50 years after it 's creation and 40 years after the passing away of the artist . 
  for a slightly broader view of what k\u00f6pcke was up to , here are his works in the moma collection , five of which are part of the reading work series : http://www.moma.org/collection/artists/18701, 
  while it 's true that there were a lot of greeks on the west coast , this discussion was about the pontic greeks specifically , who inhabited north-eastern turkey and the caucasus region . 
  could i ask you to elaborate on the difference ? 
  while a few hundred thousand killed might sound like a lesser effort compared to the armenian numbers , that still appears to have been about 50 % of the civilian pontic greek population ( weighing the [ genocide casualties ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_genocide#casualties ) against [ the number of refugees ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pontic_greeks#genocide_and_population_exchange ) ) . 
  and if it was a conscious decision to make the distinction between the armenian genocide and pontic and assyrian `` massacres '' , i would also add that this appears to go against the current academic consensus . 
  in their 2007 resolution , the international association of genocide scholars stated that it [ `` constituted a genocide against armenians , assyrians , and pontian and anatolian greeks . 
  '' ] ( http://www.genocidescholars.org/sites/default/files/document%09%5bcurrent-page%3a1%5d/documents/iags-resolution-assyrian%20and%20greek%20genocide.pdf ) ( edit : added a couple of links to my sources ), 
  this danish article does n't seem to mention selling al qaeda literature either tough ? 
  most of the article also focuses on his activities on facebook and in e-mails , while the sixth paragraph confirms the reuters report of his involvement in the publication of abu qatada . 
  are you referring to the qatada books ? 
  this article adds `` udbredelsen '' , which i guess could be interpreted as selling , but if so it 's not stated and google translate interprets it as `` promotion '' of the books . 
  and again , judging by his wikipedia article , it would be a stretch to call his writing straight up al qaeda literature . 
  and note that i 'm not trying to defend either of these men ( who seem questionable enough without any exaggerations ) , and i 'm not touching the question of whether the revoked citizenship is warranted . 
  i would just prefer that we have the facts of the matter straight . 
  from what i 've read so far in dw , reuters and now berlingske , the claim that he lost his citizenship for selling al qaeda literature seems to be misinformation , which benefits no one . 
  do you have a source on him selling al qaeda litterature in his bookstore ? 
  the current article only states that he was convicted `` of instigating and promoting terrorism after he posted social media messages . '', 
  reuters expands on this , but still does n't mention selling al qaeda litterature , writing that he was `` found guilty of supporting al qaeda and syria 's al-nusra front in posts on facebook and for his help in publishing books by abu qatada , a jordanian cleric who was deported from britain for trial at home . '', 
  while this sounds more damning , [ abu qatada 's wikipedia page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/abu_qatada ) is pretty inconclusive about any direct ties , and also states that he was freed of charges at the mentioned trial . 
  i 'm born and raised in sweden , but both my paternal grandparents hail from a village outside of ardahan ( at that time controlled by russia ) , and their four parents from what used to be two of the many pontic greek villages in the mountains between gumushane and trabzon . 
  so i do have a personal interest in pontic greek history , though most of my known relatives managed to avoid the brunt of this particular tragedy . 
  more importantly , since politicians are not an authority on the subject of history , there seems to be a consensus these days among historians in this field that it should be regarded as a genocide . 
  governments and international unions may or may not recognize individual genocides , but their focus tend to be on international diplomacy . 
  their task is not to chronicle history , and this point is often used in parliament debates preceding any recognition , by politicians arguing not on whether or nor there was a genocide , but that they have no business dictating history . 
  i would agree that this was still debated in the 90 's , as kubasar writes . 
  this is reflected in the tentative attitude in books written on the subject at the time , and in the quotes on the wikipedia page . 
  but by 2007 the international association of genocide scholars passed a resolution that it should indeed be regarded as such . 
  since there is n't really enough written on the subject on a layman level to make an honest attempt to `` make up ones own mind '' , and thus the reliance of authorities becomes much heavier , i have really googled a bit to find out if there is anything questionable about this organisation , but all i 've found suggests that it is indeed the foremost organisation for researchers in this field . 
  and thus i accept this resolution at face value , while i would of course still appreciate at some point being able to better educate myself on the details leading up to it . 
  i have also yet to find any major historians in this field calling out iags with a different perspective , which in my mind shows that the debate on the matter got resolved before the resolution was passed . 
  yet you also say it was common practice in the ottoman empire , so what exactly is the myth ? 
  i 'm not saying that they still exist , but all i 've seen written on the subject states in no uncertain terms that that they did . 
  many of them switched to being openly christian after the 1876 constitution , but there 's usually a divide somewhere in the population , and rarely do you see 100 % of any larger group to agree on doing anything . 
  bruce clark 's book * twice a stranger : how mass expulsion forged modern greece and turkey * has an 8-page section discussing the crypto-christians . 
  it has a big emphasis on preserving oral history , which makes a lot of it a bit too long-winded to quote here , but regarding the crypto-christian situation at the time leading up to the population exchange , he writes :  in any case , the strange story of the crypto-christians was still unfolding six decades later when the greek orthodox community of trebizond lived out its final moments . 
  particularly in the town itself , the division between christians and muslims was never simple or absolute , however much the impression of a straightforward dichotomy was cultivated by political and religious authorities on each side . 
  there was a grey area which the crypto-christians occupied . 
  i have no idea what the situation is today , but i would assume that by now , during the ninety that has passed , they have either decided to stay muslim or become openly christian . 
  unfortunately , the controversy sparked by your second paragraph is stealing the focus here . 
  i 'm not in the mood to participate in that fight , so i will skip past it . 
  but it 's true that the pontic language is still spoken in turkey , as your video shows . 
  there were both willing and forced conversions to islam over the centuries , as well as the `` crypto-christians '' who kept their religion secret and held up a pious muslim facade . 
  these groups were considered turkish , left alone by the authorities , allowed to stay , and parts of them managed to keep their culture alive . 
  as another example to add to yours , i 'll take the opportunity to share this video of turkish singer ay\u015fenur kolivar giving a beautiful performance of the pontic song soumela len tin panagia : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rb6fq2obxgc it 's otherwise usually heard in this 1970 's recording by chrysanthos , pontic musician born in greece : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klef4ricgw0, 
  since the pontic/pontian greeks are getting mentioned here once in a while , i wanted to join the r/europe trend of addressing yearly historial anniversaries by making a post on the rememberance day of the pontic greek genocide . 
  unfortunatly it 's rarely written about in any real detail , and when it is , facts and dates are often mixed up , and too often the inclusion of current politics make things more complicated . 
  may 19th was proclaimed the pontic greek genocide rememberance day by the greek parliament in 1994 . 
  as of today this date is apparently recognized in the city of toronto as well . 
  this proclamation may be light on details , but was the most reasonably written and fact checked current article i managed to find . 
  a few more links on this from yesterday and today : http://www.fresnobee.com/opinion/letters-to-the-editor/article78453012.html http://www.sdna.gr/news-english/article/201856/savvidis-message-about-pontian-greek-genocide http://www.pappaspost.com/on-this-day-may-19-1919-ataturk-begins-onslaught-against-pontian-greeks/ https://www.armenpress.am/eng/news/847801/greek-genocide-commemorated-in-armenia.html and a few general links : [ international association of genocide scholars 2007 resolution ] ( http://www.genocidescholars.org/sites/default/files/document%09%5bcurrent-page%3a1%5d/documents/iags-resolution-assyrian%20and%20greek%20genocide.pdf ) [ wikipedia : greek genocide ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_genocide ) [ wikipedia : pontic greeks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pontic_greeks ) edit : one of the best among the few literary things i have managed to find about the pontic greeks in english is the chapter on this topic in neal ascherson 's * black sea * . 
  it 's a book written in 1995 , and does n't deal directly with the question of genocide , but it 's worthwhile if you 're up for a slightly longer read . 
  it will take a few seconds to load since the only online source i 'm able to find now is on archive.org , but here it is : [ the incredible odyssey of the black sea greeks ] ( http://web.archive.org/web/20141001014613/http://www.karalahana.com/english/pontians.htm ), 
  while the situation is bad and needs a lot of work , `` 20 years '' is very misleading . 
  i can only find it in the headline , so i 'm not sure what this number is supposed to represent , but it 's certainly not the norm . 
  [ here 's the statistics for the main stockholm queue ] ( https://bostad.stockholm.se/statistik/ ) , and if you click `` senaste m\u00e5naden '' there 's a full list of the apartments from the last month , with the date the recipients of the apartments started to queue . 
  of the 974 apartments that went through the system last month , only fifteen people had queued for over twenty years . 
  these are generally people with no real plan to move , who queue anyway as a security and to be able to pick an chose among the more popular locations when it finally happens . 
  what site is this from ? 
  on eurovision.tv i 'm only able to find detailed views of how different countries voted , not of how they were voted on . 
  [ it won in 1984 . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgnuco3mmk0 ), 
  only reason it possibly would n't might be that it 's pretty well known . 
  but since i do n't think people know more about it than that it 's existence , the questions regarding how it was like still seem relevant . 
  regarding lesser known dictatorships , pangalos ( ' 25-26 ) and even metaxas ( ' 36-41 ) might be also worth mentioning . 
  there 's a few more military regimes included on [ the big list ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_prime_ministers_of_greece ) , but since dictatorships are n't specified , i suppose they might be temporary emergency governments ? 
  looking at the 20th century and discounting those that only ruled for a few days , there 's mavromichalis ( ' 09-10 ) and krokidas/gonatas ( ' 22-24 ) .
