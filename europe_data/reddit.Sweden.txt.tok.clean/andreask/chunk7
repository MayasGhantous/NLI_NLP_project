  if they happen to fit the bill , they are certainly the least known to me . 
   is n't this guy supposed to be a journalist ? 
  according to his twitter bio , he has previously worked as editor at metro , but is currently a marketing director at a flight finder-site . 
  correct , i initially downvoted this for not providing a proper source . 
  looking a bit deeper into it after seeing your comment , i went and looked for the map on the site . 
  it was published there in spring 2015 , and is based on [ table d3 :2 in the oecd report `` education at a glance 2014 '' ] ( http://www.keepeek.com/digital-asset-management/oecd/education/education-at-a-glance-2014/indicator-d3-how-much-are-teachers-paid_eag-2014-31-en#page16 ) , which compares salaries for the years 2011-2012 . 
  so the data is at least 5-6 years old . 
  i looked up oecd 's education at a glance 2016 hoping for more recent data , but it 's still looking pretty far back , at salaries from 2013-2014 . 
  still , they 're more relevant than the 2012 data , and surprisingly interesting to compare . 
  * graph : [ figure d3 .2 lower secondary teachers ' salaries at different points in teachers ' careers ( 2014 ) ] ( http://www.keepeek.com/digital-asset-management/oecd/education/education-at-a-glance-2016_eag-2016-en#page413 ) * graph : [ figure d3 .4 change in lower secondary teachers ' statutory salaries ( 2010 , 2012 and 2014 ) ] ( http://www.keepeek.com/digital-asset-management/oecd/education/education-at-a-glance-2016_eag-2016-en#page416 ) * [ tables ] ( http://www.keepeek.com/digital-asset-management/oecd/education/education-at-a-glance-2016_eag-2016-en#page422 ) ( pages 422-429 ), 
  as i understand it , [ it 's correct that the city is built on the site of an old greek settlement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/odessa#history ) , and that [ it was given the name odessa because at the time the settlement was believed to have been odessos ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/odessa#name ) ( [ actually located on the coast of bulgaria and nowdays called varna ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/varna#antiquity_and_bulgarian_conquest ) ) . 
  only the ending of the name was changed from the masculine - ssos to the feminine - ssa because the city was founded by a woman . 
  as far as i can tell the common perspective among modern historians is that there was never any immediate risk of a communist overtaking , a fact that the british were likely aware of . 
  when first i read up on the issue i made sure to get several books from various perspectives since the debate on these events are still divisive . 
  but i was surprised to find that even the most high-profile british history on the subject - mark mazower 's `` inside hitler 's greece '' - made it clear that while leftist ideology was very strong among eam/elas it was a varied mix of people that at every turn opted for compromise and cooperation rather than communist revolution . 
  * in spring 1944 eam arranged election in their liberated territories of occupied greece , where more than 1.5 greeks managed to vote , and accepted the resulting rule where only a minority of the ministers belonged to the communist party . 
  * when the nazis left eam had defacto control of the country , but welcomed the british arrival instead of attempting to take power at the most opportune moment they had to do so . 
  * even when fighting broke out in athens in december 1944 between the left and the right + british , eam ordered their military army elas to stay out of the city in fear of escalating the conflict . 
  a bigger problem seems to have been the anti-royalist leanings of the eam . 
  the british insisted on bringing the king back to greece after liberation , since he was their channel of influence over greek politics ( as far as i understand it ) . 
  but at this point anti-royalism had a long history in greece , and after the king deposed the elected government in the 1930 's and appointed hitler-wannabe dictator metaxas , the left-wing partisans had had enough . 
  they wanted to rid greece of all flavors of fascism and foreign meddling . 
  would greece have become part of the eastern block if the left had not been beaten down ? 
  while impossible to rule out , there were no signs of it yet at the time , with greece being on the other side of the agreed upon zones of influence ( stalin repeatedly refused to support the greek left ) , and with eam still trying for cooperation when the post-war suppression started . 
  would greece have had it worse ? 
  depends on how the alternative would have been , and it depends on who you were . 
  as it played out , they suffered decades of persecution , torture and exile , not only of communists or leftists , but , as far as i understand it , of people only guilty of taking part in the left-coordinated fight against nazi occupation . 
  and in fighting left-wing politics in greece , they also fought back female liberation ( women had been granted a more equal in partisan-controlled territories , were given a bigger role in society and administration , and were given their first vote in greek history in the spring 1944 elections ) . 
  personally i would n't wish a communist dictatorship upon anyone , and there were certainly elements * within * the resistance that i would n't see in power , but these are people who never had any control of the organisation . 
  and the more i read on the eam/elas , the more i get where they were coming from at the time . 
  [ i would very much recommend mazower 's book ] ( https://www.amazon.co.uk/inside-hitlers-greece-experience-occupation-1941-44/dp/0300089236/ ) if you have any actual interest in this question , it 's a well-written and fantastically comprehensive rundown of many various facets of occupied greece , from a british perspective but with an open analysis of the question of foreign intervention . 
  this is completely true in relation to this particular discussion , insofar as there were few avenues for a turk to be married into a greek/armenian family . 
  for a more comprehensive understanding , some forms of intermarriage were allowed , but ( to my knowledge ) only in cases resulting in greeks/armenians becoming turks , not the other way around . 
  [ the italian title track ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvwyrrw7xwe ) is pretty great . 
   greek mythology ... in space i guess what was it with the french doing greek mythology in space in the early 80s ? 
  another great one , though not as well remembered , was ulysses 31 : [ intro + the great title song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ev1abt-_zs4&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=6 ),

  edit : realized only now that they actually used this one in the op image instead of the proper burgundy one . 
  does anyone remember any response from draghi on schauble 's attempt to force greece out of the euro zone at finale of the 2015 negotiations ? 
  if what draghi is saying here is true , the logical conclusion seems to be that schauble 's suggestions were never viable ? 
  indeed . 
  this is actually remarked upon at the start at [ the interview that accompanies the nomination ] ( http://www.fokus.se/2016/12/arets-svensk-4/ ) , where she ( a left-wing politician ) is interviewed by leftist author/publisher edenborg . 
   ** do n't ask me how it happened , but here 's a communist interviewing another communist on the orders of an arrant libertarian . 
  **  amineh laughs , but adds :  but i use the word socialist . 
  the marxism that shaped me and that i still stand by is different than many interpretations , which leads to misunderstandings . 
  the right connects the word with the soviet union , which was something else . 
  a poor peshmerga girl from the mountains of kurdistan does n't share stalin 's values . 
  this is important . 
  [ ... ]  ** how do you feel about receiving the award swede of the year by fokus ? 
  **  i am happy !, 
  and if libertarians thinks that a maxist and feminist does something right for this great nation it 's good . 
  you ca n't judge everyone by ideology . 
  some moderater [ the big conservative-right party moderaterna ] has more sound ideas in areas of honor and identity politics than some people in my own party . 
  this article is pretty confusing , and does n't seem to include the motivation . 
  clumsily translated from swedish , `` by bringing to light radicalization , clan - and honor oppression , amineh kakabaveh exposes , in action and speech and to a considerable personal cost , the swedish reluctance to touch sensitive subjects . 
  she does this by focusing on values that concern all , rather than by differentiating by identity . '', 
  edit : for additional context , this is wikipedia 's description of her work : `` as a politician and opinion maker kakabaveh has highlighted topics such as honour crimes , women 's rights and secularism . '', 
  red commonly signifies bad . 
  i wanted to make it go from red to green , but that would have made all the hues harder to distinguish . 
  i made another set of consistent colored maps of this , not seeing that it had already been addressed here . 
  i also colored it for easier reading , with red for negative feelings . 
  posted in another comment , but i 'll repeat it since it 's more relevant here : http://imgur.com/a/mrt5b, 
  it 's mostly a result of the map 's relative scale , greece just has a few more issues with these countries then their neighbours . 
  i 've normalized the coloring between the maps , making it more clear that it 's their opinion on germany that is the outlier : http://imgur.com/a/mrt5b, 
  the significance of this concert has grown so much on me since it took place . 
  it was too silly to understand when it happened , but it 's now one of my favorite recorded examples of the boundary-destroying optimism after the end of the cold war , taking place just 16 months after the fall of the soviet union . 
  in this regard , i love their performance of happy together : [ at 13:15 ] ( https://youtu.be/dsksd0x4a5u?t=830 ) , or [ as a separate video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rv1ctzsiu0 ) your description is the back cover text from the dvd . 
  the booklet expands a bit on it :  two ensembles representing absolutely contrasting traditions communicated something urgent to an audience of 70,000 people , something that was inescapably and tremblingly true about the friendship between nations , peaceful coexistence , and other themes usually experienced on the level of empty liturgy . 
  the concert went far beyond artificial speeches . 
  [ ... ] the event took place in helsinki 's senate square . 
  there is n't any place more loaded with meaning than this in finland . 
  [ ... ] many older citizens observed with great accuracy that all this proved to be a true ending , at long last and finally , to the war that had nominally ended almost half a century before . 
  the battle at br\u00e5valla at the mid-700 's is a memorable story . 
  translated/paraphrased from the first volume of herman lindquist 's * historien om sverige * ( the story of sweden ) : it is told in sagubrot that when king harald hildetand ( harald wartooth ) had lived for 150 winters , he was so weak that he could no longer walk . 
  at this time there was an attempt to put logs and stones on him when he took his bath , but he quickly found his bearings and roared at his enemies to lift him up . 
  he refused to die in the bath , he wanted to die on the battlefield . 
  he challenged his nephew sigurd ring , whom he had placed as a sort of vice king in uppsala - they would now see who was strongest and mightiest . 
  the battle that was about to take place , the battle at br\u00e5valla moor around year 750 , is the biggest told of in nordic history . 
  saxo grammaticus depicts it as a sort of heavy weight championship of war . 
  the preparations took seven years . 
  each side bringing together their supporters , and huge squads emerged . 
  the chronicles talk about 200.000 men . 
  harald 's army had all the danish warriors , but also people from \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland , the last free geatish kingdom . 
  the biggest names are listed in the texts . 
  there was holger the wide , are the one-eyed , dag the thick , hroi cheekbeard , high-brodd the unbendable . 
  there were also brothers-in-law to ring , and saxons . 
  harald also had 300 female elite soldiers , shieldmaidens , led by hed , visna and veborg . 
  hed being harald 's own daughter . 
  on king ring 's side were people from svealand and v\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland , who had been tied to the swedes through war and marriage . 
  there were gotlanders such as egil the bald , but also many from today 's norway like grette the evil from telemark , blig big-nose , einar the thick-thinned and erling grass-snake . 
  the tales talks of champions from all around the baltic sea , from gar\u00f0ar\u00edki , angeln , frisland and ireland . 
  big forests where cut down to build ships , roads and ports were constructed . 
  it was a feverish military activity during these seven years to get everything ready in time . 
  saxo grammaticus writes that the swedes had over 3000 ships , and that the danish ships were so many and tightly packed , that the danish champions could walk with dry feet from sj\u00e6lland to sk\u00e5ne . 
  for seven days harald marched with his army before he reached br\u00e5valla , who according to some historians was located somewhere around br\u00e5viken north of today 's norrk\u00f6ping . 
  king ring came there first , harald arriving the day after . 
  each side needed at least a day to get their over 100.000 champions to stand in the right place . 
  if saxo is correctly understood , the batte line was over four kilometers long . 
  harald and ring each made offerings to odin and promised him many enemies for victory . 
  when both sides were ready they both blew their horns , and a terrible battle started .
