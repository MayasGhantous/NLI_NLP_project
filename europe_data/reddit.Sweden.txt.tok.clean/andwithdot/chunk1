  ( e : above asked why i was complaining so much before the edit ) because there is a lot to complain about , honey . 
  an infographic should at least be legible and needs to have direct links to credible sources because otherwise anyone can just throw some numbers on an image and claim it as truth . 
  do you have a source at least ? 
   [ infographics which are poorly sourced will be removed . 
  the submitter must provide the source in the comments , including a brief explanation if necessary , soon after making the submission .

  an unanimated gif . 
  for no reason . 
  with a jpg extension . 
  what the fuck did you do to that image to make it look that shit and still be 181 kb ? 
  i did n't say it did , just clarifying an ambiguous headline . 
  at least she survived . 
   they were treated in hospital and survived . 
  think of the drawn children . 
  i would say that six months in prison , the current maximum sentence they mention in the article , is quite a lot more than just a stern talking to . 
  i fail to see the point in increasing it to 24 months . 
  it 's not like it 's going to be more of a deterrent because no criminal looks at maximum sentences before committing a crime . 
  save the money you 'd have spent on prison costs and lost citizen productivity and spend it on preventative efforts and actually enforcing existing laws instead . 
   chloe madeley told the mail on sunday : `` the current law obviously needs to be reviewed . 
  it needs to be accepted that physical threats should not fall under the ` freedom of speech ' umbrella . 
  it should be seen as online ** terrorism ** and it should be illegal . '' just had to shoehorn terrorism in there , did n't you . 
  yes , it should have been a continuous color gradient or at least more than two bins . 
  coloring 0.0 % and 3.7 % the same is silly . 
  kebab pizza , the swedishest dish there is . 
  it 's just what you get if you continue along the color wheel . 
  including blue lets you have better contrast than when using a smaller range of colors . 
  light green is pretty close to yellow . 
  very misleading when comparing spain and portugal . 
  it should go red-orange-yellow-light green-green-blue .

  if anything that graph seems to indicate that they do turn off things at high levels of wind power productivity as the rate of exports is roughly the same at 4000 gwh wind as at 8000 . 
  the relationship is clearly not linear in any case so please do n't slap that useless trendline on there . 
  no one , more or less . 
  it 's not a threat . 
  i wish people would stop abusing the word ` exponentially ' . 
  unless you literally mean that something follows the form of or is related to the exponential function , do n't use it . 
  ` rapidly ' or ` quickly ' would be more appropriate while also avoiding confusion .

  no , you seem to be content with bullying our politicians and supplying the vast majority of the culture we consume . 
  no , they were completely unrelated incidents . 
  just random chance .

  ignoring the ~ 10 times greater distance and the fact that the baltic sea is more or less a neighborhood , sure . 
  but i did say * if * . 
  if i 'm not allowed then the uk can go hang with ireland because hey , no land border with france or anyone else except ireland . 
  favorite : norway . 
  we can actually understand them and lots of young swedes work there . 
  their culture is very close to ours . 
  also , they used to be part of sweden . 
  least favorite : we all get along pretty well . 
  russia if i 'm allowed to count it ( straight shot across the baltic sea ), 
  scandinavia , the netherlands and germany have lots of english-speakers . 
  speaking for my own country , you could easily get by in everyday life here with only english , though many jobs require swedish . 
  depends on the field . 
  if you 're in academia it would probably not be a problem . 
  fine , you go first then . 
  no , but straight up attacking russia is ridiculous . 
  economic sanctions and other diplomatic actions provide ways of punishing countries without triggering a war that could literally end the human race . 
  what you are proposing could trigger global nuclear war . 
  gray text on gray background , small font , and excessive compression . 
  someone slap whoever made this . 
  i said nothing about sweden topping you without the oil , only that it 's the reason you 're # 1 . 
  this sort of reminds me of the whole [ backyard furnace ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/backyard_furnace ) thing china did during the great leap forward , and i expect it will be about as successful . 
  norway basically has oil money to thank for its consistent # 1 spot , since gdp per capita is one of the three components used to calculate hdi . 
  the other two are education and life expectancy , which norway ranks roughly the same as many other developed countries in . 
  because he was rude and did n't post a translation , especially of the title . 
  and also because the link was n't very interesting anyway . 
  downvoting poor posting etiquette does n't make you a fucking nazi . 
  sigh . 
  we do tolerate other languages . 
  we 're just asking you to have the common courtesy to take half a minute out of your very busy and important life to also attach a link to translation so that the other 90 % of the subreddit can participate in the discussion because in this sub english is the only language practically everybody speaks . 
  at this point i 'm pretty sure you 're just trolling because nobody is this dense . 
  this is a discussion forum where people gather to discuss topics . 
  in order to facilitate these discussions we use a common language so we can communicate and exchange ideas and opinions . 
  having everybody use their native language would result in both a giant cluttered mess and a great reduction in the number of people able to contribute to each discussion and the amount of cross-country/culture dialogue taking place . 
  your flair says `` end all nations '' which makes this whole discussion absurd . 
  common languages bring people of different nations closer together . 
  eu ! = / r/europe . 
  this sub * does * have an official recommended language that practically all subscribers speak , and it 's english . 
  what ? 
  you get `` paid '' by having people be able to read your discussion so that it gets commented on and upvoted instead of just being downvoted into the ground by people who are annoyed at not being able to read it and/or at your lack of common courtesy . 
  it 's super annoying when people go to france and expect everyone to speak english , right ? 
  well this is like that , except in reverse . 
  no , people generally tolerate foreign-language sources if you just take half a minute to also post a translated link . 
  if you mean that people are intolerant against arrogant posts that exclude something like 90 % of the sub then yes , we are `` intolerant '' . 
  deal with it or go to / r/france . 
  reddit is a predominantly english-speaking site and while the rules on this sub do not * require * posts to be in english , they recommend posting english translations of foreign-language links because it the only language that practically everyone on the sub speaks . 
  in other words , you 're free to post in french or whatever , but provide a translation or expect a negative reception . 
  i mean geez , it took me like twenty seconds to go fetch a google translate link of the article .

  * this is a moderated forum , to maintain a civil environment , and a high level of debate . 
  we reserve the right to actively moderate the subreddit as is reasonable , to achieve those aims . 
  your title was inflammatory to the point of being trolling ( `` so-called democracy '' , `` rears its ugly head '' ) and the post was removed for good reason . 
  i checked six of the major swedish newspapers ( svd , dn , g\u00f6teborgsposten , sydsvenskan , aftonbladet and expressen ) . 
  [ aftonbladet ] ( http://www.sydsvenskan.se/varlden/minnesdag-for-offren-i-srebrenica/ ) and [ sydsvenskan ] ( http://www.sydsvenskan.se/varlden/minnesdag-for-offren-i-srebrenica/ ) both featured articles about people commemorating the victims . 
  minor news in both cases . 
  personally , i had no idea that today was the anniversary .
