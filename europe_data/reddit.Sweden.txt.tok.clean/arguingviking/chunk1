here 's an old piece from the area i 'm from - dalarna , sweden . 
  it 's originally a folk song but in this video composed as a psalm on a church organ . 
  strikingly beautiful , gives me home sickness something fierce !, 
  [ f\u00e4bodspsalm ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tvmxsbzob8 ) and for the sake of completeness , [ here 's an example of the type of folk music ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8wd6ip4y2s ) that the song would originally have been in . 
  if we go back two centuries , 201 years to be precise ( or to put it in perspective , a mere 28 years after the founding of the usa ) then yes , sweden was a warmongering monarchy with ambitions to conquer as much as possible . 
  [ list of swedish wars ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_wars_involving_sweden ) if we go back even further , more than a millenia , we find the viking raiding parties , although that is before the nation of sweden was formed . 
  i do n't know what exactly changed between our last campaign against norway in 1814 and now , but i suspect it has something to do with the people of sweden stripping the monarchy of power and effectively becoming a democracy . 
  regardless , since then sweden has been one of the more pacifist nations around . 
  200 years of peace and all . 
  i do feel though , that whenever swedish `` pacifism '' is touted around , one has to also mention that we 're a huge developer and relative to our size , gigantic supplier of military equipment and arms . 
  kinda taints that nice rosy picture a bit ... 
  from what the article said , it sounds like they are being investigated for their android practices . 
  i would n't be surprised if what you 're talking about is precisely what they were referring to , in which case such a suit may indeed be inbound . 
  no worries . 
  i 'll give you one thing though . 
  the above i wrote hinges on the ability to acclimatize . 
  and that only really happens if you spend all your time outside in the cold ( for instance , in a tent ) . 
  if you only spend a few hours at a time outside , and the rest inside where it 's nice and warm , you wo n't ever acclimatize , and then going out to -25 c or so is far , far worse than around 0 . 
  also , around 0 is only really bad if you ** are ** outside all the time . 
  the moisture will work itself into your clothing over time . 
  if you 're just outside for a bit , it wo n't be noticeable . 
  so you * are * at least partly right . 
   also , i 'm writing all this as much for whoever else reads this as you personally . 
  so forgive me if it sound a bit like i 'm talking down to you . 
  not my intention . 
  just trying to be informative . 
  all those poor frozen batteries . 
  casualties of war . 
  the worst part imho was working with the more fiddly ( metal ) parts , where you had to take off your nice thick wintergloves . 
  frostbite in the fingers ? 
  why yes please !, 
  / u/superedgy knows his stuff . 
  i did my mandatory military time in the north of sweden . 
  -5 to +5 c was much worse than -10 to -30 c . when it 's that cold all moisture in the air freezes and it becomes super dry . 
  after a few days your body has acclimatized and it 's hardly cold anymore . 
  well , -30 is bloody cold , but -10 is nothing . 
  and at -30 you just put on thicker clothing and you 're all good . 
  no clothing in the world can keep the bone-chilling moisture out when it 's around 0 c . one caveat : spent one of those weeks in the field during a record cold snap , with temperatures dropping to -45 c during the day !, 
  now ** that ** was the worst time . 
  every single bit of exposed skin would almost instantly get frostbite if it touched any metal . 
  cleaning your rifle was near impossible . 
  you had to heat your spoon in your food before taking your first bite or it would freeze stuck to your tongue , possibly also gluing your lips together until it thawed again . 
  good times . 
   so i guess around -30 c is the breaking point where acclimatization and clothing ca n't keep up any more and it quickly starts to become really , really unpleasant . 
  perkele is such a glorious word . 
  by far the best general curse i know . 
  so much inherent hard , raw but also funny anger just from the pronunciation alone !, 
  eh , did you even read my entire post ? 
  i specifically said this very fact . 
  several times . 
  there 's even a whole paragraph about how it 's unreasonable for us to expect you to care about our needs . 
  one could even say most of my post was about how you * should n't * assume all americans support trump . 
  your last line , `` yes you need to take him into account , no , that does not justify projecting his actions upon every american . '', 
  is actually a very good summary of my entire post . 
  i think most europeans , / u/stenny007 included , are well aware of this . 
  i understand fully that it is unfair to you to be lumped together as supporting everything trump does . 
  many of you did not vote for trump for his ideals , you voted for him because he seemed like the lesser of two evils . 
  it is thus ( and i agree with this ) untrue to claim you automatically agree with all the bad stuff he does . 
  but here 's the problem . 
  while that is true for someone who 's looking at it from the inside as an american citizen , it is mostly irrelevant ( in terms of practical decisions ) to a european looking at it from their point of view . 
  it does n't make much difference to us * why * usa elected this man . 
  only that you * did * elect him . 
  any harm this causes us is equal regardless and we have to adjust accordingly . 
  the americans who voted for him either directly support him , or value the needs of europeans low enough they are worth ignoring in favor of internal needs . 
  that so few voted does n't really work to your favor . 
  that only tells me very few of you care about politics , the world ( eu included ) , anything important really enough to bother to vote at all . 
  while the second reason is far more understandable than the first and third , even respectable i 'd say , in the end the message is the same . 
  our well-being is not a top priority for you . 
  we can not trust you to have our backs . 
  so while your ( you and previous posters ' ) points are solid arguments for a sympathetic view of americans as a people , they do little to affect what decisions we as europeans need to make practically . 
  regardless of why , this is the path forward you chose . 
  you now have to live with whatever fallout comes from it . 
  now with all that said , one could argue that this is n't the fault of the us but rather that the eu has been far too reliant on the us in the past . 
  that it is unreasonable for us to expect you to consider our needs a top priority in the first place . 
  and you 'd be 100 % correct . 
  it is . 
  but the fact that we have ( right or not ) is also the reason you 've been considered such a close ally to us . 
  much much closer than any other country . 
  like family . 
  one way to look at the changes in eu-us relationships that may come of this is not that it 's punishment for any us misdeeds but rather eu waking up and ridding itself of that unhealthy dependency . 
  that the us is n't being treated unfavorably , but rather not getting special treatment anymore . 
  but in the end , no matter how one may choose to look at this , it does n't change the fact that i judge each person i meet individually . 
  if we ever meet i will treat you according to who you are as a person , not where you 're from . 
  people who treat individual americans badly just because of this whole mess are bigots themselves . 
  there 's zero difference between assuming you support trump 100 % just because you 're from the us and say , assuming all people from the middle east are terrorists . 
  actually , iirc ` lagen ' refers to teams , not law in this case . 
  bergslagen as in `` the minerteams of the mountain '' . 
  that 's actually a good thing i think . 
  if i recall correctly , sweden is currently lacking skilled welders . 
  so getting a job should be fairly straight forward . 
  and getting a job is ** the ** key you need to an expedited process towards swedish permanent residency rights . 
  this one can be painfully slow otherwise ( and even denied i think ) . 
  after that , stick with it for 5 ( ? ), 
  years , and you can become a fully swedish citizen . 
   also : finland is indeed a truly lovely place to visit . 
  apparently , it was brought here by missionaries evangelizing christianity during the period before scandinavia converted . 
  it being about a girl who brought light to darkness and right in the darkest , most depressing period of the scandinavian year ( december , before the snow has properly arrived ) we loved it . 
  i guess we made our own twist on it though , making it literally about a girl going around spreading light in the dark morning hours and singing warm , pleasant hymns .

  i think they are , if i recall correctly .
