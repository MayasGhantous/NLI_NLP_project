  as you can see your definition ( that started this meaningless thread ) is incorrect . 
  there is this search mechanism , try it . 
  i 'm talking about the definition of social liberalism, 
  english wikipedia , i thought you could keep 2 sentences in your head, 
  it says english and no i was commenting on the meaning social liberalism, 
  more than unknown persons writing posts in reddit, 
  i have also heard that . 
  did some googling , this contradicts that . 
  your wikipedia begs to differ on that topic, 
  yes i know what op asked but you stated  i ca n't see how california should be more socially conservative than stockholm , i really ca n't . 
  if you really discussed something else , well then you should probably make that more clear in your writing . 
  no they are n't in not anyway you look at it . 
  they are actually slightly above oecd average . 
  actually far from sweden http://www.oecd.org/tax/tax-policy/taxingwages.htm#tw_a and http://www.oecd.org/tax/tax-policy/taxingwages.htm#tw_d if the prices would actually be so high so that the the higher wage sould n't matter , then i wonder what all these 80000 swedes are doing here, 
  i 'm generally talking about sweden obviously . 
  * free education * public healthcare * wrong welfare state are generally considered to be basics of social liberalism then again , read and then talk . 
  i 'll just point you to the lines you need to read http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_liberalism#united_states_2 , you seem to have problems to read text . 
  i 'm not saying that this is good . 
  i 'm probably brain washed as a swede and i 'm not even living in sweden any more . 
  partly due to low wages and high taxes but having to argue that sweden is more socially liberal that the us is just a waste of time . 
  read this so that you know what we are talking about http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_liberalism, 
  as i said , if you define liberal first ... an economic liberalism and a social liberalism can be very different . 
  for a scandinavian , california ( and more so the us ) is very socially conservative . 
  that norway is so low on `` household net adjusted disposable income '' surprise me . 
  with high wages and ( relatively ) low taxes it should be much higher . 
  i find sweden very liberal and stockholm even more . 
  i have n't really been to malm\u00f6 or g\u00f6teborg . 
  if i compare it to oslo , it is much more liberal , bigger etc. 
  i just suppose it depends on what you put in word liberal . 
  if drugs and the price of alcohol is important , not so much for norway and sweden . 
  if culture , acceptance of differences etc , then scandinavia score higher . 
  we have the imported mormons , how they ever get a visa is what i do n't understand, 
  you 'll have to take out your aggressions on someone living in sweden . 
  i live in a country where the police does n't have tazers or guns !!, 
  we all seem to survive however, 
  here is a link so that you can tell them how it should be done http://www.polisen.se/stockholms_lan/system/formular/epost-tipsformular/tipsa-polisen-i-stockholms-lan/, 
  oh internet , what else is in there ? 
  i was more trying to say that the police did n't shot him the first thing they did of things i find interesting , tazers and shock grenades are really low on the list . 
  probably next to ingrown toenails, 
  i would n't know , i rarely use them, 
  my friend has a house in iceland ( reykjavik ) . 
  i think that he said that he pays about $ 6 for all the warm water he needs ( including heating ) per month . 
  when he goes away on a trip he seldom decrease the heating, 
  the police in norway are unarmed and less police are hurt/killed on duty compared to sweden ( per capita ), 
  they threw a shock grenade at him but it did n't help . 
  here is the original link http://www.metro.se/nyheter/polis-skot-ihjal-knivman/evhmem!vl4cjd2tkduqs/, 
  due to the latte prices in oslo , everyone working behind the counter are required to have at least one firearm , to be able to get any money from the customers, 
  folk\u00f6l , volkbier , the peoples beer , lid\u00e9 pivo is your answer, 
  only the `` small part '' and everyone that did n't have a crowbar left everything that was firmly nailed to something heavy, 
  there is an easy and a hard way . 
  you belong to the biggest union in the world then it is very easy to lower the taxes to attract taxable profits that is generated elsewhere in the union . 
  you can do whatever you want in your country . 
  you selected your government ( including the senators ) . 
  besides apple started to pay dividends last year, 
  first of all , there is a difference between tax rate and effective tax rate . 
  then there there are many problems , i agree . 
  however there are many things that need to change in eu to make it more effective and better for its citizens , this is one . 
  look at the post from der spiegel btw http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/eu-faces-tough-battle-to-curb-tax-avoidance-and-evasion-a-900900.html, 
  minimum tax not anything else . 
  i do n't see ireland as a completely helpless victim here . 
  it is still one of the richest countries in europe , good education etc. 
  much closer to europe compared to where i 'm from, 
  the point is that all countries has to lower its company taxes so that they do n't leave for other countries that mostly compete with lower taxes . 
  we should compete on education , infrastructure etc. 
  one of the main points of having a powerful union is that the corporations ca n't play countries against each other . 
  there are many benefits for companies to have presence within the eu . 
  well you could compete with having well educated citizens , good infrastructure etc. 
  ireland already have a huge advantage with the language . 
  it is n't like estonia or scandinavia is the center of the world . 
  i would expect that luxembourg would have to compete with the other eu nations among them . 
  none of them is n't exactly starving . 
  eu is going after tax havens outside of the eu . 
  putting pressure on austria ( and more ) to stop its bank secrecy . 
  i find it natural that this should be next . 
  however it is hard ( or impossible ) for eu to meddle in internal taxes for a member country, 
  not if we had some kind of minimum tax in eu . 
  it is not in our interest to have a downward spiral of company taxes . 
  you will find similar discussions in danmark and norway about what is typically xx like in this thread . 
  for example now in the upcoming elections in norway . 
  you have frp desperately trying to define typically norwegian values . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.aftenposten.no/meninger/kronikker/ikkje-min-kulturminister-7081291.html#.uztcceaw0sq ) and all the following articles ( below the original one ) that involved tajik ( ap cabinet of culture ) , tybring gjedde ( frp ) and many others that was basically down to define what is norwegian . 
  it all started when tajik refused to define what is norwegian ( being pakistan descent ) . 
  then frp went ape shit and tajik started talking about her mothers f\u00e5rik\u00e5l ( sheep and cabbage stew ) . 
  she would probably have ignored it if it is n't election this year . 
  google `` typisk dansk '' , `` typisk norsk '' and `` typiskt svenskt '' and you will realize that you are typically swedish after your definition . 
  almost every country i have lived in say that this is a typical xx trait . 
  i would say that it is a typical human trait to believe that jantelagen is typical trait for the region that the person lives in . 
  edit : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/law_of_jante#see_also, 
  it was coined by a danish - norwegian author , so no it is not, 
  yes but norway has a very low gini index so most are pretty well off here . 
  everything that involves people is really expensive ( like plumbers ) while a computer is cheap . 
  since independence they have been very rich ( only after uk and switzerland in 1945 ) but yes when you people living in caves during early 18 century , yes they had it bad, 
  i think that you are misjudging the toll of the war when you compare the countries on the continent and norway ( -6 % ) ( sweden +10 % , denmark -13 % ) . 
  belgium ( -65 % ) , netherlands ( -90 % ) , almost halved its while germany and austria was even worse of course if you look in more details like [ here ] ( www.bit.ly/16krkxk ) you 'll see that among nw european countries , norway is consistently ahead of finland , netherlands and belgium but behind all others . 
  overtakes uk 65 , denmark and germany in 74 , sweden in 75 ( switzerland in 87 ) . 
  the uk economy was the one falling behind all others at that time, 
  of course not . 
  we would have been like any other nw european country . 
  if we would n't , that would have been weird . 
  sorry http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_regions_by_past_gdp_ ( ppp ) _ per_capita,
