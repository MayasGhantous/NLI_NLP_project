  booming and booming . 
  more like catching up to a below western european average you mean . 
  discounting the losing side of ww2 of course . 
  then between 1950 and 1973 most countries of the losing side catched up and passed norway . 
  the article specifically says  she instead proposed to extend unemployment benefits from the current three months to six months for any eu national who leaves their home state to seek work in another eu country . 
  the current [ rules are ] ( http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/work/job-search/transferring-unemployment-benefits/index_en.htm )  you can only do this if you are :  wholly unemployed ( not partially or intermittently ) and entitled to receive unemployment benefits in the country where you became unemployed . 
  before leaving , you must :  have been registered as an unemployed jobseeker with the employment services in the country where you became unemployed for at least 4 weeks ( exceptions can be made ) apply for a u2 form ( former e 303 form ) - authorisation to export your unemployment benefits - from your national employment services . 
  this authorisation is valid for one country only . 
  if you wish to export your unemployment benefits to another country , you need to apply for another u2 form . 
  ask your job centre whether you 'll have to go back home to apply for this new authorisation or you can do it remotely . 
   on arrival in the new country , you will need to :  register as a jobseeker with the national employment services within 7 days from the date on which you ceased to be available to the employment services in the country you left submit your u2 form ( former e 303 form ) when you register agree to any checks made on unemployment benefit claimants in your new country , as if you were receiving unemployment benefits there . 
  you are advised to find out about your rights and duties as a jobseeker in your new country . 
  they may be very different from the country where you became unemployed . 
  you will then be paid the same amount as before , directly to your bank account in the country where you became unemployed . 
   if you want to keep your entitlement to the unemployment benefits , be sure to return to the country paying your unemployment benefits before or on the day your entitlement expires . 
  please note that if you come from romania or bulgaria , there may be rules temporarily restricting your right to work in some other eu countries . 
  if i work in one country , payed taxes and lose my job . 
  then it would be hard for me to move back home , if i loose my unemployment pay . 
  if i live in one country and want to move abroad to find work , equally hard . 
  does n't seem to be [ unfair ] ( http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/imm_asy_see_pergdp-immigration-asylum-seekers-per-gdp ) . 
  actually quite low compared to other european countries, 
  read the article again . 
  the leader of nato talks about eu 's military capability in the context of eu 's foreign policy . 
  there are many countries that in the eu that are not part of nato . 
  so no , we do n't have the capability to defend us or canada and probably not invade anything in africa . 
  this is just theoretical anyway because we all need to agree on it . 
  what the article is talking about ( mostly ) is that eu foreign policy suffers , because we can not really threaten other countries that we will invade them ( unlike the us ) . 
  besides that , i think that we could argue if the eu , in fact , has a foreign policy . 
  i think that we will just take the good with the bad . 
  we will have situation like in srebrenica ( which were un troops btw ) and not have invasions in iraq , afghanistan , vietnam etc. 
  surprisingly , we have this thing called `` supply and demand '' in sweden . 
  very few want to live `` near sundsvall '' , therefore that house was really cheap . 
  you can go to my hometown and find something a lot cheaper than that ( inland = cheaper ) . 
  we get some dutch and germans , that move up there but they last about 2 winters . 
  then they pack up and head down south . 
  it is n't like we like to pay a lot for houses in sweden . 
  it just are n't many jobs up north ( with some exceptions ) and with no salary a house can cost 100 000 sek and it will still be too expensive . 
  rural sweden welcomes you . 
  3k $ / square meter will get you nothing in any major city . 
  not exceptionally nice but [ munch , the scream ] ( https://maps.google.com/maps?q=ekebergveien,+oslo,+norge&amp;hl=no&amp;ll=59.900561,10.770035&amp;spn=0.021694,0.065489&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=35.082817,67.060547&amp;oq=eke&amp;t=h&amp;hnear=ekebergveien,+oslo,+norge&amp;z=14&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=59.900573,10.77025&amp;panoid=_4c6xbfxhhzho-vue9oqkq&amp;cbp=12,315.65,,0,2.71 ) and [ the original ] ( http://www.google.no/imgres?imgurl=http://nyogalleristny.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/8850-munch-the-scream-e1336013995741.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://galleristny.com/2012/05/sothebys-hauls-in-330-6-m-as-munch-scream-soars/&amp;h=1981&amp;w=2540&amp;sz=1750&amp;tbnid=uwo9yql_ll-pgm:&amp;tbnh=90&amp;tbnw=115&amp;zoom=1&amp;usg=__ddofblelkflvlf_ypquwbxgd24i=&amp;docid=s7az7ya1amb_lm&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=uzh9uyvfgq3gbiazgoao&amp;ved=0ceuq9qewag&amp;dur=769 ) . 
  this is debated btw, 
  yes but this is true for absolutely everything . 
  food , houses , anything apart from more-than-one-year-old books ( no vat ) . 
  this means basically that we price ourself out of most sectors . 
  if this continues , we will have people working in the public sector and with oil . 
  the last salary negotiation is just one more step in that direction . 
  it is not sustainable that we earn 38 % more than our nordic siblings . 
  one day we will need to get down to that level and it will be painful . 
  yes but where does the high gdp originate from ? 
  a huge part is from the oil sector . 
  when we stop pumping oil , the gdp will gradually decrease , probably between 30 - 50 % . 
  it is unlikely that we somehow can have a much higher gdp than our neighbours ( which are among the richest in the world ) without oil . 
  when this happens , we have more than half of our workforce in the public sector . 
  most of the manufacturing industry is gone . 
  your index , btw , is about how easy it is of doing business . 
  not really how easy it is to actually make any money . 
  it was your claim so you should back it . 
  but a quick googling gives that the oil sector is about 30 % . 
  i 'm fairly certain that this is a conservative estimate . 
  for example , i work for a big shipping company that sell a lot of equipment to the oil sector , directly or indirectly . 
  i wonder how much is counted as shipping and how much is in the oil sector . 
  it will never include all the 3 million cabins that are being built in the mountains or the 3 : r kitchen renovation this decade by the oil worker with an average salary of 1 million nok . 
  then we have  50 percent of the workforce in the public sector , which will never agree with such a `` low '' increase as in the posted article . 
  as long as you have huge income from oil/gas and where the oil sector supports most else . 
  for example having more than half of all workers employed by the public sector and many on various benefits . 
  however when this ends we can either use the the oil fund and keep living as we do or do some very painful adjustments . 
  depends on what you compare to . 
  higher than the other nw european countries or higher than lower end of the eu . 
  because the norwegians ca n't compete when exporting products . 
  everything we make is to expensive . 
  we can sell natural resources ( oil , wood , fish ) but not sell more labour intensive products . 
  that is if not the government need to support that sector . 
  obviously , exporting natural resources is by this measurement competitive . 
  it requires far less man power to pump up oil and sell it compared to manufacture and sell some product . 
  why ? 
  do you understand how inflated the norwegian economy is ? 
  no but wage cuts at about 30 % and increased taxes about 10 % to be in line with the rest of nw europe will be tough, 
  here is a how to http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/07/27/157421340/how-to-set-up-an-offshore-company, 
  it is not like the source of greece 's and spain 's problems are the same,

  i 'm sorry for stating the obvious but as you asked . 
   of course his ancestors lived through those times . 
  but did they choose rome instead of constantinople ? 
  ...  and your point is ... ? 
  whoever lived in croatia during the roman era was n't the croats . 
  they came centuries later . 
  croatia was settled by the croats after the western roman empire fell, 
  tell me why uk is more democratic than the eu . 
  norway pays more per capita than for example uk to the eu, 
  it is weird but i do n't think that you represent a nation of 60 millions . 
  call me open minded or whatever ... you have a bunch of anecdotes that all have in common that you hit your kid ( s ) to protect him/her . 
  a normal conclusion would then be that your kids would be in more danger if you did not hit them . 
  i expect your kids to be normal and therefore we could guess that this apply to most children . 
  exactly where did i misunderstand you ? 
  well if your anecdotes would have a conclusion , that would be it . 
  are you saying that whatever you wrote had no point ? 
  you are basically claiming that the number of fatal accidents are lower in countries that allow spanking . 
  i think that you will have problems to show this . 
  if you need to smack your kid to do as you say you should perhaps think about how you are as a parent . 
  but then , this  is doing nothing different than police restraining a suicidal or mentally ill person .
