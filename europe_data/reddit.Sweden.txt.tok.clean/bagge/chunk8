  the english and american were from the western front . 
  the german ones from the eastern . 
  i was not passive aggressive . 
  i just thought you made an smart joke but i guess not, 
  no seriously all my czech friends harass me for not getting their low key dark humor . 
  i just you were pointing out that us were supporting uk and on purpose did n't mention the ridiculous statement about that ussr would have lost if it was not for d day . 
  it was funny considering the insignicance of the western front after 1940 . 
  wait are you still joking now ? 
  czech humor at its best !, 
  vojak svejk would have been proud . 
  you need to look at a timeline of the war . 
  just 30 seconds of googling could have saved you from posting uninformed comments . 
  apart from stopped trade , no visas for businessmen , we got [ condemned by the arab league ] ( https://euobserver.com/beyond-brussels/127946 ) of 50 + nations . 
  that was months after we recognized palestine as a state . 
  in sweden we are closing fully functional nuclear power plants . 
  we already have a disposal problem and the continent is burning brown coal . 
  it does n't add up . 
  we need to connect our power grids more and phase out the worst energy sources first, 
  the iranians with highle educated aprents that came about 30 years ago , yes . 
  socio economic status beats etnicity, 
  could you be more specific regarding the `` gender neutral school stuff '' ? 
  i was just into some friendly neighborly squabble . 
  you are not as i can see . 
  anyways i was referring to history http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%85lands_historia#.c3.85lands_kamp_f.c3.b6r_.c3.a5terf.c3.b6rening_med_sverige, 
  ok give us \u00c5land then, 
  where was it serious ? 
  you might be that you misunderstood finnish ( dark ) humor as serious ? 
  lately you have stopped using your voice and there is the problem . 
  i 'm certain that germany ( and most others ) want uk to remain and be a counter weight to france but then you have to play ball . 
   further , there seems to be a lot of semi-imperial framing of the eu by a good proportion of europhiles : we need to make a counterweight to the us , we need to exert influence together , and so on , which makes any criticism of supposed imperial longings by the british a little awkward . 
  as long as we do n't have any military capacity to invade countries , we use diplomacy to solve our problems . 
  eu 's foreign policy ( if there is one ... ) obviously have a problem when some countries follows us ' current fad . 
  all countries try to exert influence on other countries , that is just normal . 
  uk has solved this by your special relationship , most others use the tools we have . 
  the day we start bolstering our foreign policy with threats of invasion , i 'll agree with you . 
  you use your bigger friend to remain in the club of big powers . 
  my personal view is that you are being used , but that is just me . 
  we do n't listen and then you get pissed off . 
  i see that you have given up arguing about your erroneous view regarding the uk rebate . 
  well rabidly pro-europe is all relative . 
  i 'm a lousy ice hockey player , for being swedish . 
  do this [ search ] ( https://www.google.no/search?q=the+guardian+eu&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=the+guardian+eu&amp;sugexp=chrome,mod=12&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=utf-8 ) and keep clicking next until you find anything that could in a non-brittish view be called anything close to pro-eu . 
  how many pages ? 
  note that i 'm not saying that they are wrong . 
  read [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uk_rebate ) . 
  it is obviously not a simple addition . 
  i understand that a lazy journalist with an agenda likes to write this however . 
  you should know that reading uk newspapers , that writes about uk and eu , is mostly a complete waste of time . 
  no it does n't  i read we 'd be paying in net less than # 100 million less than germany a year despite having a smaller economy and a smaller population besides you have been comparing per capita before and uk pay less than denmark , sweden , finland , holland , germany etc. 
  so , no you do n't pay very much compared to other western european states . 
  on your link , do the minus-plus thing on the number at the bottom . 
  the data is from 2009 btw . 
  the rebate is backed by the cap . 
  if the cap goes , [ no rebate ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/common_agricultural_policy#uk_rebate_and_the_cap ) . 
  then about [ 5 seconds of googling ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budget_of_the_european_union#net_contributors_and_recipients ) and you would have realized that you are completely wrong . 
  no i do not . 
  you are playing in 2 : nd division and you are a mediocre player . 
  your team is degraded down to 3 : rd. 
  you are now a top scorer in the 3 : rd division and that is all nice . 
  however the rest of us play in the 1 : st division . 
  now when we are going to qualify for the world championships and form a national team . 
  obviously all players from the 3 : rd division is not going to contribute to the national team . 
  we have a number of big countries that are performing poorly . 
  we do n't need one more . 
  well the city in itself cant decide to accept refugees , they can after an initial period move wherever they want in sweden . 
  many decided to move to s\u00f6dert\u00e4lje, 
  hmm let me see * bush - `` almost criminal negligence '' * [ rumsfeld resign ] ( http://www.economist.com/node/2647493 ) * [ berlusconi ] ( http://www.economist.com/node/18805327 ), 
  actually s\u00f6dert\u00e4lje received more than [ us and canada combined ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/s%c3%b6dert%c3%a4lje#demographics ), 
  you have n't seen many covers then . 
  they [ tend to be that way ] ( https://www.google.no/search?q=economist+cover&amp;hl=no&amp;prmd=imvns&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=nusmun_blsrh4qt4wicgca&amp;ved=0cdsqsaq&amp;biw=1615&amp;bih=676 ) . 
  you should ' t judge a book by its covers, 
  this would of course be a valid point if france could export camemberts to make up for it , but they do n't . 
  as i said it is politically unsustainable ( for northern european politicians ) to bail out greece when we get cases like the lagarde list ( and the prosecution of the journalist ) keep popping up . 
  i believe that in a democratic society , if the will is there , it is up to the people to sort this out . 
  if people do n't vote because `` everyone is corrupt '' , they are part of the problem . 
  so really if austerity increases the corruption or not is n't the issue . 
  the perceived image by the voters in northern europe is the issue . 
  in fact , mass demonstrations against the handling of the lagarde list would help , burning a merkel doll in a nazi uniform does n't . 
  i 'm not saying that this is correct or fair . 
  the politicians that handles the bail has reelection in a few years and they are of course taking this into account . 
  really ? 
  this is n't my domain but at least in sweden and norway they definitely are , if you are not using some weird definition of `` legislative process '' . 
  i agree and we do this to this to a certain extent . 
  however i 'm all for using this to force some countries to clean up their act . 
  it is politically unsustainable in the long term to pay money to greece with the level of corruption as tax evasion that they have been doing . 
  name on the country where you vote for a `` ministry of x '' . 
  i have actually other things to do then vote for all the 27 commissioners . 
  i see that you have lots of spare-time however . 
  there is a swedish mp and vicar that criticize him . 
  http://www.thelocal.se/44380/20121112/ i guess that you do n't have to be religious to agree with a three year penalty for an abortion . 
  a question to anyone that feels inclined to answer . 
  yes , i have googled it but it seems to be quite a controversial question . 
  uk estimated deficit is 8.7 % and germany 1.3 % for 2012 . 
  ( http://www.gfmag.com/tools/global-database/economic-data/10395-public-deficit-by-country.html#axzz2brbungis ) . 
  is n't it more easy to have a higher growth if you have such a high deficit like uk . 
  is it possible to compare the german and uk growth in comparison to the deficit ? 
  yes but poland is very conservative and religious while cr is the opposite . 
  the first downvote for years . 
  that is debatable , as it was not an official term . 
  google it and see .
