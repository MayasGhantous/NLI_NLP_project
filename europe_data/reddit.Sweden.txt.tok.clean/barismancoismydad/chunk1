what the shit lol had no idea it was that high, 
   close to 10 % of his budget coming from eu investments jesus christ is this true ? 
  that 's not what he 's saying . 
  what he 's saying is that a country that is often stereotyped as `` the mecka of femimism '' lags behind many other countries when it comes to women in the workforce , which he uses as argument as to why the stereotype is not true . 
  and there is nothing wrong with swedish people, 
  the left here have been treating fucking * denmark * as if it were some poverty stricken fascist backwater , the arrogance displayed is staggering, 
   austrian citizens have moved thousands of refugees from budapest , gy\u00f6r , r\u00f6szke and other places to ** safety ** arghhhh !, 
  the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland ? 
  well i was baptised as one , is n't that kind of the requirement ? 
  colonizing the north was a pretty solid move on our side it seems ... 
  that 's not very weird though is it ? 
  i too am an orthodox christian without believing in god, 
  on the one issue of immigration ? 
  yes they 're probably equal . 
  if you think the swedish right is left-leaning on economic policies you might aswell go back to bed, 
  so zlatan means `` golden '' or something ? 
  how fitting !, 
   it 's weird to see that overall the public think that lab and corbyn care more , are more likely to look after the interests of the public yet cons and cameron are more capable of running a country . 
  i think this is the case in most countries . 
  i really believe that the left means well , and want what is best for as many people as possible , but they also have the tendency to be frightfully incompetent . 
  it 's like they live in a fantasy world . 
  the right might not have everyones interest in mind , but atleast they are usually more fit to actually rule . 
  well i 'm sure we have some old ones in the back , i 'll check and then come back to you ok ? 
  otherwise i 've heard brown hair is pretty normal in ... portugal , 
  uhh ... have you run out of brunettes in portugal or what ? 
  i have been confused by that line for years , what the hell is s vd ? 
  not on our watch !, 
  still belgium holds 10x more political power than you and their cultural output is significantly larger than yours . 
  what have finland ever brought to the table except for emigrants , alcoholism and misery ? 
   one of the main, 
  [ i think this one is pretty cool ] ( http://blog.boyahed.com/http://blog.boyahed.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/marikacarlsson_mats_backer.jpg ) and i had to wear something like [ this ] ( http://nioras.com/images/218701.jpg ) once when i was younger , never felt fancier in my life, 
  does n't this mean other manufacturers probably cheat aswell ? 
  if emissions are 40x higher than shown in tests , and other manufacturers tests showed similar emissions as the vw ( vw having about 40x less emissions would probably have been a bit too suspicious ) , then surely other manufacturers cheat aswell as i find it hard to believe that vw actually release 40x as many emissions as the rest . 
  well i 'm a halfbreed so it 's fine, 
   the problem with integration is not because of second generation immigrant being hostile , it is because they do not feel like a part of the swedish society . 
  but they are still people and have the potential to become a part of our society . 
  of course , but they 're not going to , because they do n't want to , because we ca n't give them any clear reason as to why they should . 
   that is called culture , and cultures change . 
  yes of course , i was not talking about ethnicity but culture , i can see now why my post might have had you thinking that , sorry . 
   if we would bring in a man from the 19th century into our modern world , you and him would be less alike culturally than you and a romanian person . 
  sure , but romanians and swedes are both europeans , so that is not very surprising . 
   whether you like it or not , people will some day intermix with eachother and share similar values such as you and other british persons do . 
  i certainly hope not , it would make the world a much less interesting place . 
  what i do believe is that this is a mainly european idea , and the world certainly does not revolve around europe and her offsprings . 
  rejoice scandinavians !, 
  not going to happen , too many bleeding hearts here . 
  does this mean we wo n't have to deal with gypsies anymore ? 
   a polish/indian person is n't more subhuman than a british person . 
  what the hell ?!, 
   but nationalism is far one of the most deluded ways of thinking , regarding that we live in a world that is becoming more globalized . 
  that is easy to say when you grew up in a racially pure suburb where everyone had the same opinions/background as you . 
  the majority of the rest of the world does not think this way . 
   all humans regardless of race or nationality are basically the same . 
  you need to get out of the country more man , people are extremely different all over the world , which i think is a good thing . 
  far too few , sadly, 
  i like birdwatching if that is what you 're asking ? 
  i saw a chaffinch yesterday , which i found very exciting !, 
  sadly i do not know anyone named elsa or tyrone but i think they would approve of my birdwatching . 
  i would much prefer if the greeks could be our gatekeeper but fine , `` man tager vad man haver '' as pippi longstockings would 've said . 
  i 'll send you some belgian beer and spanish hookers do n't worry efendi !, 
  i do n't know , the living room ? 
  that 's usually where i talk to my guests . 
  jesus turkey really have us by the balls here ... 
  i do n't have one i live in a flat . 
  it 's a very ... special language i 'll give you that . 
  i 've gotten responses ranging from `` ohh so sexy and manly '' to `` are you retarded ? '', 
  to it abroad ... 
  maybe if you 're a danish heretic !, 
  oh cool man that channel looks great !, 
  thank you !, 
  i 'm sorry , i had to show both ends of the spectrum now that i had the chance !, 
  glad you like it !, 
  i 've found it is nearly impossible to find people who appreciate this kind of music in my surroundings ... 
  haha , he 's a bit before my time i 'm afraid !, 
  stromae is really the only famous belgian i know of ... 
  nah , you jesus people need to find snus !, 
  because she is the embodiment of the `` sexy exotic french woman '' stereotype , and we all used to have a crush on her, 
  he 's got some [ fantastic ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57nnaf9gnxs ) tracks !, 
  [ some turkish psychedelic rock ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0gjwpmb-k8 ) [ some more ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl3raxfj1oo ) [ jesus fucking christ i love this genre ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnac4-xmog8 ) [ oh , and our favourite belgian is back ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ajw4chksqm ), 
  well there is obviously some truth to that . 
  excluding the uk , all of europe still seems to base our identities primarily on ethnicity . 
  the americas and oceania do n't due to their history which of course makes it easier for other peoples to integrate, 
  pfft , where is my independent epirus in that map ? 
  i think the anglosphere benefits heavily from speaking the lingua franca of the world . 
  we 'd need to rethink our whole brand to compete with them in terms of attracting well-educated immigration . 
  and they 'll leave to australia or north america , not europe, 
   migrant family becomes westernised and contributes to european society that would make a great story for `` the onion '' , someone should tip them, 
  we are in effect bringing them here by not stopping them/welcoming them with open arms . 
  you know this is what he means , stop messing about, 
  que ? 
  i visited those coffee shops just fine only a few months ago, 
  buzzwords like `` populism '' , `` immoral '' , `` easy solutions '' , `` solidarity '' etc. 
  no one is saying anything of value regarding why everyone suddenly turned to sd, 
  iirc they have been increasing in every poll both september and august , and even in the `` poll of polls '' they reach around 20-22 % . 
  whilst yougov is a bit of an outlier , they are showing sd as the biggest party in sweden for the 2nd consecutive month here , and another poll made by sentio placed them as the biggest party aswell . 
  same paper yes, 
  do people hunt moose here ? 
  i always had the impression they were kind of sacred, 
  sd are also in favour of nuclear power, 
  used an ak5 in the army , pretty cool weapon .
