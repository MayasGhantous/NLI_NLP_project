buttmad german detected, 
  shaking my head family ? 
  what massive issue did they massively disagree on ? 
  the treaty of versailles ? 
  well hitler had already ignored every point on the treaty before the war started , and that 's not the reason war broke out . 
  was it that germany should have what is now poland ? 
  it was a territorial war , and besides , it was not just europe , but the whole world, 
  if things keep going the way they are this will ** not ** happen, 
  are you talking about the protestant reformation ? 
  reminds me of the ikea-murderer , they did n't deport that guy either, 
  probably illegal in russia now though, 
  did you really just accuse this guy of being a fucking nazi or is there something i 'm missing here ? 
  you 're still not right , despite the fact that we 're on reddit . 
  just to be even more annoying to you : capitalize jesus if you 're talking about the son of god , if it were some mexican guy you meant , then it 'd be fine \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  no it does n't , despite the fact that we 're not in school, 
   well , they probably do n't , but everybody thinks their opinion means more than the other guy . 
  it 's human nature . 
  that 's not the point man , the point is to actually have some actual arguments or facts to back up your opinion . 
  just saying :  and this is coming from somebody who lives in the deep south , that has actually fucked off in the ghetto , and who grew up with around half my neighborhood & close-family friends being black . 
  means nothing, 
  let me clarify : your opinions mean not a tiny bit more than someone else 's opinion simply because you have black friends or have chilled in the ghetto . 
  there 's also this lovely strawman argument :  but anyway , i guess you 're right . 
  there is no racism in germany , no racist groups in germany and no racist individuals in germany, 
  we all have biases towards our friends , what race your friends are makes no difference on your `` perspective on race relations '' . 
  also , what does `` fucked off in the ghetto '' mean ? 
  why do you have to add that you have black friends ? 
  calm down there buddy . 
  if both germany and usa has racists , then would n't it still be better to give everyone full freedom of speech ? 
  sorry italien , but even you could n't beat andorra, 
  i bet it 's all an italian conspiracy, 
  highly doubt that, 
  they 're only below 80 with 0,5 years , and like i said , they 're just below you guys . 
  it 's not exactly shocking data ( there 's even a bigger difference between ger and switzerland compared to ger and denmark ), 
  what do you mean ? 
  they 're just slightly below you guys , look east instead if you want something actually bad, 
  why does italy get to have decimals but not us ? 
  i 'm 100 % certain that so many countries does n't have xx ,0 years as their life expectancy, 
  are you implying you do n't sound like you have a potato in your throat when you speak ? 
  your initial comment was pretty retarded, 
   germans are just evil  bombed the shit out of civilians in both germany and japan , but it 's ok because less of american soldiers died, 
  the only thing he knows about europe is the holocaust and he wants to feel relevant, 
   with a potato in their mouth is choking on porridge . 
  oh the irony, 
  we are the descendants of those who did n't emigrate, 
  i 'm a little ashamed that i even recognized the tuborg ^ ( i might like it ), 
  good thing it was only danish beer : ^ ), 
  those statistics are racist man . 
  it 's because they are opressed by the racist french society and therefore need to commit crimes in order to sustain themselves . 
  eventually after scraping together enough money they try to start own buisnesses while at the same time fighting their crippling gambling problems . 
  one day , taking a bus to town they discover that the bus has a bomb on it ( planets by neo-nazis ) and they must prevent it from exploding by keeping the speed above 50 mph . 
  first point on the site * mr farage said parts of the country have `` frankly become unrecognisable '' and look `` like a foreign land '' . 
  * which they change into * changing the landscape of the uk * stopped reading right there, 
  it was a joke about flemish :d also , if you 're neither a walloon nor flemish , are you one of the rare german belgians ? 
  learn dutch \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  you 're just saying that cause german women are sluts \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af ^ ( / s ), 
  that 's only because we define a prime as being greater than 1 , which we have n't always done in mathematics . 
  we just dropped 1 from the list so that primes would be of more use to us . 
  uk and europe is like the number 1 and primes . 
  technically 1 is a prime , but we can say more meaningful things about the entire group if we just exclude it . 
  i thought it was pretty funny either way to be honest , feels like a mix of / r/tumblrinaction and / r/iamverysmart, 
  * `` how can you even dare , you piece of shit , to compare the righteous anger of millions of people as an result of neo-hegemonial german politics in europe to the biggest break of civilization ever happened , which germany is also to be hold responsible for '' * i mean , this has potential to become a copy-pasta meme, 
  i interprited `` still '' as , `` at least they 'll always be european '' . 
  i thought germans had no humor even funnier might be the people who are actually offended by your spot on post, 
  do you think we 're all americans and think that the eu is europe ? 
  i know you exist , i see you as southern as well, 
  greece i consider southern european . 
  as for romania , hungary and moldova , i see them as exceptions since they make a corridor between the south slavs and the other slavs, 
  and here i thought cuba was in the caribbean, 
  we still love you !, 
  i 'm not sure i think the baltics are eastern european , when i think eastern european i think * slavic countries *, 
  not really, 
  you were n't off by a lot man , just 56/356 = 15,7 % less , 
  ( 1,6 * 10 ^ 9 ) / ( 10 ^ 7 * 0,6 * 0,75 ) = 356 eur just checking , you were right, 
  but how many of them are adults ? 
  like he said , knapp means scarce or badly in german , but maybe you 'd like to try the patented swedish ** lagom ** ^ tm . 
  a word that only exists in swedish which means exactly what you just said . 
  i use a lot of german words , it started as ein joke at first , like counting using die numbers eins to zehn . 
  now i 've even started capitalizing nouns und using einfache german phrases in day zu day life . 
  i do n't know about english dialects but it 's the kind of dialect that you would want to hear when you 're in bed with a cup of chocolate being read a story . 
  they speak a funny dialect of swedish , but that 's about it . 
  if england split in two and you moved from one place to another , would n't you still consider yourself a native ? 
  also , fennoswede does n't mean native , it means swedish speaking finn . 
  just the same as finnish speaking finn does n't mean native, 
  there 's a difference between immigrants from the eastern coast of africa and immigrants from a neighbour country that has been together for almost a millennium as well as having one of the two official languages as their mother tounge with as close as an identical culture, 
  they 'd probably get counted as fennoswedes aswell, 
  both swedish speaking and finnish speaking finns are natives is what he is saying . 
  also , finland was part of sweden for over seven centuries, 
  it 's pretty much exactly social liberalism , maybe you meant that by modern liberalism, 
  i think you 're describing socialism, 
  in america they call it libertarian since the word liberal has lost its original meaning there, 
  no , it 's fine the way it 's now, 
  is n't the - in suffix only used for females , like professor and professorin ? 
  honoring your ancestors is awesome , it gives you +1 stability . 
  honestly though i am very proud of my heritage and my country 's histrory . 
  i think you americans are all just teasing us when you ask these questions becuase you probably all know the answer already , which is that hitler made nationalism * weird * . 
  yes !, 
  always on a friday, 
  of course not , midsummer is way better, 
   a well regulated militia , being necessary to the security of a free state , the right of the people to keep and bear arms , shall not be infringed . 
  why or why not ?
