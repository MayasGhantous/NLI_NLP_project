what are you talking about ? 
  do you have any grounds for that statement ? 
  nobody is saying racism does not exist in sweden , but some people ( left-wing ) have been saying that it 's getting more normal and accepted , but same here , without any sort of fact or research backing them . 
  yes , but the green party is full of delusional deniers that refuse to believe the things said about him and his views . 
  the party leaders even defend him , even though the whole party advocate equality between men and women ( which he , as a muslim and islamist supporter most likely is n't ) . 
  they were known , but never really publicly known . 
  the mainstream media have not been writing about his views , so * regular * swedes have not known that much about his views . 
  i for one , have known about his views for some years and i 'm happy he 's gone from the government . 
  you are so arrogant , swedes does not glorify muslims . 
  cause he is ( * was * ) good at hiding them , but not good enough . 
  no it is not illegal . 
  but it has been proven several times over that these people wo n't be a profit in the long run . 
  perhaps later generations , but not these ` fleeing ' right now . 
  australia !, 
  please , it 's a known fact that most journalists follow leftist parties . 
  then the news wo n't get anywhere . 
  how else will this get attention ? 
  the scariest thing is that he wants to leave the paris climate agreement , making it utterly useless . 
  you got any sources for him being popular in china and india ? 
  i 've never heard that . 
  edit : ah right , this guy i asked a question to is just a the_donald subscriber and shitposter , spreading lies about everything and nothing . 
  good job m8 . 
  swede here , only use the cash i get from tips . 
  yeah , he loves to call all those who opposes his views on the world as `` racists '' , `` fascists '' , `` nazis '' and other lovely words . 
  you can not even take him seriously . 
  not `` they '' , but a certain person that is absolutely insane and delusional . 
  it was extremely embarrassing to watch . 
  i 'm very doubtful of that . 
  we have serious and not so serious gang members ( [ bandidos ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bandidos_motorcycle_club ) , ** og - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/original_gangsters_ ( gang ) ** , [ hells angels ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hells_angels ) , [ the brotherhood ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/br%c3%b6draskapet ) , [ the balkan mafia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/serbian_mafia#sweden ) etc. 
  ) , nazis ( mostly in prison for racially motivated murders ) , albanian mafia members ( ethnic albanians but born here ) and probably lots of ( muslim ) immigrants from the middle east and so on . 
  i believe the larger majority that is in the more serious prisons are in for either serious drug trafficking , gang murders , murders or other * more serious * crimes . 
  but in the end i believe that the majority of those in prison hate terrorists , especially if they are islam ( is ) influenced . 
  edit : added some links to the gangs . 
  i did notice the sarcasm in your comment , i just agreed . 
  not really . 
   otherwise inmates will kill him . 
  this is important . 
  swedish experts have said that if he is not isolated from all communication with other inmates , he will most likely be murdered inside prison . 
  i do not really get your analogy . 
  you should be a tad more specific in your comment . 
  which reality is that you want `` us '' ( my great nation ) to understand ? 
  what is this forest we are unable to see ? 
  could you elaborate ? 
   i just looked at the posts on t_d and found that apart from the normal memes and jokes ( which they have on every post ) ** most people are expressing anger , hatred and sadness . 
  ** just look at the thread on the front page now . 
  [ really ? 
  ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/the_donald/comments/640cpr/vehicle_driven_into_people_on_city_street_in/?sort=top ) are these top comments expressing * anger * , * hatred * and * sadness * ? 
  piss off , seriously . 
  do n't even try to make the_d look good in any way . 
  edit : [ another thread ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/the_donald/comments/640lr8/breaking_stockholm_police_issue_this_warning_do/ ) with comments expressing sadness and hatred . 
  [ another really tasteful thread ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/the_donald/comments/649qdx/transcript_of_a_phone_call_to_sweden/ ), 
  are we being slaughtered or are you just pushing an obvious agenda ? 
  https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/03/24/how-saudi-arabia-turned-swedens-human-rights-criticisms-into-an-attack-on-islam/ and https://www.spectator.co.uk/2015/03/swedens-feminist-foreign-minister-has-dared-to-tell-the-truth-about-saudi-arabia-what-happens-now-concerns-us-all/, 
  indeed . 
   sweden already opened the doors for the immigrants . 
  sweden gave them shelter . 
  sweden gave them education . 
  sweden gave them jobs . 
  sweden included them in a welfare system created at the expenses of the swedish people . 
  so why does sweden have to do everything ? 
  why ca n't the immigrants integrate themselves ? 
  it 's not as simple as you 're laying it out to be . 
  i agree , it * should * be this simple , but unfortunately it is not . 
  it is a demanding process for all parties involved . 
  well yeah , you could put it like that . 
  it may be something `` wrong '' with their culture , but it 's more of an issue when it comes to combining different cultures and assimilating . 
  and i agree , it 's not good when previous generation of immigrants have not assimilated to our swedish culture . 
  i am not putting the blame on `` us '' ( sweden ) solely , this is , as i said , a process between all parties , and not just on one . 
  like in a healthy relationship . 
  yes and no . 
  sweden did not integrate previous generations of immigrants well enough ( except for the people the came from countries closer to our values and norms , like the balkans , secular/christian iranis and iraqis & finns ) . 
  the [ million programme ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/million_programme ) was a reason the integration did not go that well i believe , clumping everyone coming from another culture and region of the world ( with a different worldview of norms and values ) together , did not help the integration of these people . 
  rather it created segregated areas . 
  i can write more later if you have any other questions . 
  but in short , the idea to be a humanitarian superpower is not working out for us swedes . 
  we have an extremely difficult to enter working life ( do n't know how to translate correctly ) . 
  even for us swedes it is hard to get jobs and apartments for ourselves , so why make it even harder for outsiders ? 
  our normal standard of behaving and living can be considered laid back and not having any * unnecessary * social conversation with random people . 
  so that was also a reason why the integration did not work as well as it was hoped to . 
  my thoughts on the matter . 
  well , do you have any questions ? 
  i 've heard i 'm pretty unbiased , so ask away . 
  so therefore fuck human rights ? 
  could you explain why they should be executed ? 
  yeah , the stats i found did not count ethnic background . 
  yeah i did write it up a bit weird . 
  if you check the further comments below me , i explain which stats that can be interesting . 
   they even censor their own media and public institutions . 
  do you have any examples of this happening ? 
   i suppose that foreign prisoners tend to be in prison for more serious crimes than average and fewer of them are eligible for the more lenient sentences that reduces the overall number of prisoners ? 
  i have not read up on the stats yet , but i think that is the case . 
  yes , the numbers are very low . 
  it is . 
  the statistic you can look at , that might have the most meaning to it , might be the percentual change . 
  the total number of prisoners in sweden went down by ** ~ 17 % ** ( 2011 versus 2015 ) , while the the total number of foreign nationals/citizens in prisons went down by ** ~ 7 % ** ( 2011 versus 2015 ) . 
   swedish people are very nice and altruistic . 
  but their society , individualistic and distanced , probably simply clashes with culture of their immigrants and it makes it hard for them . 
  even eu citizens struggle in sweden apparently . 
  you 're right on point . 
  yeah that sounds reasonable .
