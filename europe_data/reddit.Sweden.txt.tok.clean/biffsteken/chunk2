  [ miljonprogrammet ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/million_programme ) was both good and bad at the same time . 
  they have over time turned into ghettos-ish , because everyone with a foreign background gets placed in these areas . 
  in turn , not integrating to society particularly well . 
   also , are there any statistics on demographics of prisoners in sweden ? 
  [ here ] ( http://www.bra.se/download/18.4a33c027159a89523b12c972/1485516520791/tabellbilaga_kriminalv%c3%a5rd_2015.pdf ) on page 13 . 
  there 's been a steady percentual increase in the number of foreign nationals/citizens in swedish prisons . 
  2011 | 2012 | 2013 | 2014 | 2015 --------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- 5 148 ( 100 % ) | 4 852 ( 100 % ) | 4 377 ( 100 % ) | 4 319 ( 100 % ) | 4 292 ( 100 % ) 1 419 ( 28 % ) | 1 479 ( 30 % ) | 1 383 ( 32 % ) | 1 324 ( 31 % ) | 1 325 ( 31 % ) the first number is the time period ( 2011-2015 ) . 
  the 2nd one is how many prisoners there were in sweden in total during those years . 
  the 3rd shows both the percentage ( % of tot ) and the total number of foreign nationals/citizens in swedish prisons . 
  the report is written in very formal swedish and will be translated extremely well if you make it go through any translating program . 
  i think it 's most likely a combination of not integrating/adapting to another culture * and * because of the socioeconomic statuses . 
  it does not have to be black or white ( i.e. 
  it does not have to be one of the two , rather a combination ) . 
  oh god no , not arnstad !, 
  i cringe every time i see him in any debate or article . 
  wait , what ? 
  but they aimed for them and missed , what is that you do n't understand ? 
  so it was ** not ** meant to be a warning shot . 
  that 's just a childish comment . 
  they did not hit , but they scattered the group of people . 
  the shot was a `` verkanseld '' , translated to `` fire for effect '' . 
  it was meant to injure and to protecting themselves . 
  yeah , that 's something that makes me embarrassed about being a swede . 
  it 's such a despicable amount of disrespect ( to us , as a free and secular country ) and hypocrisy ( cause of their position in regards to feminism ) . 
  luckily it was not received well , * at all * , in sweden . 
  of course not . 
  and i can not convince you that the climate has gotten a lot more open in sweden during the last three years when it comes to talking about immigrants and immigration problems . 
  and there are lots and lots of articles ( in swedish , if you would like to read them i can link them ) that are circulating around right now about how badly the image of sweden is falling and that we , our government , the people and the police gets all the help they need to clean up the suburbs in stockholm . 
  the current , very liberal government , still hold on to the very strict immigration policy we have right now , and refuses to let go of it , even though lots of liberal youths in the richer areas of sweden has proposed motions on going back to the old system . 
  our country has changed a lot since the chaos of late 2015 and early 2016 when the refugee and immigration problem was huge . 
  however , the suburbs of stockholm are not occupying refugees , but ( some 1st ) 2nd , 3rd and 4th generation of immigrants that still lives `` outside '' our society . 
  and unfortunately those problems have gotten worse through more immigrants coming in from countries where they still fight eachother . 
  it 's complicated . 
  and we are proud of our country . 
  but the hyperbole going on is absurd . 
  we do n't admit we have problems ? 
  just take a look at the comments everywhere in this thread . 
  we do realize we have problems , but the hyperbole regarding our problems on ther internet is just absurd . 
  there was a comment recently by a police officer in sweden that told an interviewer that we do not have any `` no-go zones '' in sweden , but instead we have `` go-go zones '' , where the police needs to work extensively and be preared when going into . 
  the term no-go zone is a military one that describes areas that the countries forces have completely lost control over . 
  that is not the case of some suburbs in stockholm . 
  i do n't believe that there are basically any fully-fledged no-go zones in europe or the us . 
  i would describe a no-go zone to be like the * favelas * in south america . 
  those areas are completely in ruins and where gangs walk around with ak47s and murder , rape , and crime happens every day . 
  and yes , i want stricter laws in my country , i want lots of immigrants out , i want less immigrants in and i want the country to become more stable . 
  but fear mongering is not the way to solve this . 
  ** comment got removed because of a facebook link to sanandajis public facebook profile . 
  reposting . 
  ** that article has been debunked by almost every reputable political economic profile in sweden . 
  you do know that right ? 
  even those that are not right-leaning or have agendas behind them have come out and said that it 's total bullshit . 
  and that `` arena id\u00e9 '' is a group with specific political statements to make , that are funded through left-leaning groups and partys . 
  cause it has n't really . 
  the type of crime has just changed . 
  your assumptions are correct , [ tino sanandaji ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tino_sanandaji ) has talked about this in his book `` massutmaning '' ( a wordplay on `` mass immigration '' and `` utmaning = challenge '' , the books name is `` masschallenge '' ) and on his blog & facebook page . 
  yes , i dislike the_donald cause the fake articles and pictures they are spreading around . 
  and that if you say anything that the mods or the hivemind do not agree with , you get banned . 
  that is not an action of a ** last bastion of free speech ** . 
  and no , i can not go on the_donald , cause i made a comment about a fake article that was posted and got banned . 
  nice , right ? 
  at the_donald , the only acceptable thing that the hivemind thinks about sweden are that it is a hellhole with sharia law and is the rape capital of the world . 
  if you somehow try to dispute those things , you get banned . 
  and i know the_donald is not racist or nazi , but it is not a subreddit i would ever go to , to seek facts , memes or discussion . 
  then i would go to / r/asktrumpsupporters, 
    not my fault if you live up near the north pole in an igloo with polar bears and santa , or indeed anywhere else that the immigrant horde is not . 
  or perhaps you do live near them and you have simply donned your rose tinted glasses in support of your lunatic left government . 
  nope , i live an hour from stockholm , in one of the bigger cities in mid sweden . 
  but i am very active in the immigration and refuge topic , and i do recognize the problems we have in several cities throughout sweden . 
  so no rose tinted glasses for me , mine are transparent . 
   obviously you do n't read many threads containing hot button topics . 
  i suggest that you start now if you want to go around reprimanding every post that offers a comment that you find to be `` insulting '' . 
  you will be at it for a while . 
  i do read lots of hot topic threads here on reddit , comments like yours just make me irritated . 
   i doubt there is any value to be gleaned from discussing minutiae with someone who pretends that mass immigration is not a problem . 
  where did i say that mass immigration not is a problem ? 
  can you find that comment for me ? 
  i think mass immigration is stupid and just makes the country accepting all the immigrants and refugees less functioning and is almost all of the time a burden for that country . 
  you really have no fucking idea about my views on politics , but you love to push agendas on me , that i am somehow a * leftist extremist swede * that is a cuck , right ? 
  seriously . 
  you are allowed to do whatever you want , as long as it 's legal , as a normal democracy would . 
  you 're really pushing so many things down my throat , you seem to practice the same sort of agenda that religious extremists do ? 
  when did i dismiss your opinions as * wrong * ? 
  do n't know why you 're joking , we are one of the most equal countries in the world . 
  but the equality issue also has its problems , the same with the immigration and refuge shit in sweden . 
  i do n't care about right and left , do n't know where you got that from . 
  i enjoy politics from all different spectrums . 
  moderate , social democratic , social conservative , nationalistic and green politics . 
  so stop with the `` left and right '' , i did not implicate anything regarding that . 
  i am no female , are you ? 
  i do think females in the bigger cities in sweden has an unsafe feeling when walking around late at night . 
  i , for example , do not feel safe in stockholm ( where i lived for 20 years ) . 
  i felt more safe everywhere in the netherlands when i was there for 6 months last year . 
  i do however feel very safe in the city i live in now in sweden . 
  i did n't realize you 're a / r/the _ donald dweller until now , do n't come here . 
  [ you do seem closer to having sharia law in your great kingdom by the way . 
  ] ( http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/743825/1000-muslims-close-london-streets-chant-allahu-akbar-demand-islamic-caliphate ), 
  nope . 
  i know that we have our problems here in sweden , i do not deny that . 
  but i would like to deny the notion that we can not go about our lives , just as we have the last 20 years , cause of the refuge and immigration crisis . 
  the exaggeration with your strawman is real in your comment by the way .
