in sweden , probably stockholm , though i have a soft spot for kalmar . 
  in all of europe , the most beautiful city i 've been to was amsterdam . 
  i did n't say it was more efficient , i said it was better ( from the driver 's perspective ) . 
  yes !, 
  we do n't have zones to begin with . 
  you 're always supposed to follow the last sign you passed . 
  because , instead of putting up a useless ` end of zone ' sign , which is extremely confusing if you 're not aware that other countries have general speed limits , you could just put up a sign with the new speed limit . 
  same cost , much better . 
  obviously there are de facto general speed limits . 
  i know , it just seems like an inferior system . 
  there is no such thing as general speed limits here actually . 
  there are speed limit signs every few kilometers on basically every road in the entire country , and you 're always supposed to follow the last one you passed . 
  driving on the continent is fucking confusing . 
  to me , there 's nothing more ridiculous than a good ole swedish english accent . 
  i ca n't take anyone seriously who speaks english like that ( which is most of us ) . 
  completely destroyed michael nykvist 's character in john wick for me , by the way . 
  he was supposed to be this big menacing russian mob lord , but all i could think was that he sounds like my fucking dad on vacation . 
  king gustav vasa , who rebelled against the danes during the kalmar union ( in which norway , sweden and denmark were united under danish rule ) in the early 16th century . 
  he won and broke sweden out of the union , initiating our unbroken independence ever since , and was seen as a hero and father of the country for hundreds of years . 
  in reality , he was just as bad as the danish king who preceded him ( if not worse ) . 
  he was a tyrant and a despot , a paranoid psychopath , and people * hated * him during his reign . 
  his kids were all deranged , bloodthirsty monsters as well . 
  one of them once beat his advisor to death with a [ fire fork ] ( https://cdn0.rubylane.com/shops/houseoflostandfound/0047.1l.jpg ) and ran out into the woods naked and screaming . 
  that whole family suffered from severe mental illness , which is just recently being talked about openly , i feel like . 
  the dumbest one is probably when you 're served cake on a plate . 
  if your piece tips over on its side , you 're not getting married that year . 
  if it stays upright , you are getting married . 
  or something like that , i forget exactly what the rules are . 
  it 's pretty weird how the word * lagom * has become some sort of symbol for swedish culture and mentality . 
  it 's not , really , it 's just an adverb that means something like `` just right '' which happens to not exist in english . 
  but ever since it started popping up in stupid lists over untranslatable words , people just took the idea and ran with it . 
  including swedes !, 
  , do n't get me wrong , we 're probably the most to blame about all this , but trust me , there 's nothing to the idea that the word * lagom * typifies swedes in any particular way . 
  i do n't really have anything to compare my existence here with because i 've never lived anywhere else . 
  but i do recognize that i 'm extremely well off and privileged compared to most of the world . 
  yeah , i found as soon as you start accepting that it 's an actual word and just throw it in when you need to , you find use for it all the time . 
  though my sm\u00e5l\u00e4ndska complicates things , because people think i 'm saying `` f\u00e4sst '' unless they 're from around here , and are even more confused . 
  definitely . 
  i 'm all about * f\u00e4rst * , too . 
  it 's our blessed * duty * to fill this unfortunate gap in our language for future generations of swedes , to be honest . 
  it would be * h\u00f6gr\u00f6vad * in swedish but sadly we do n't use that word . 
  at least i 've never heard it . 
  we should though . 
  very uncommon . 
  maybe 20-30 people or something , and they 're all related to me somehow . 
  never met anyone with the same name that was n't my immediate family , though . 
  the others are all in another part of sweden . 
  you mean * hembr\u00e4nt * , right ? 
  uh , no idea when i picked it up , to be honest . 
  it 's only two stanzas and you hear it a couple times a year , so it just sticks for most in childhood , i guess . 
  i actually had to sing it every single friday for a year when i did my military service , so i know it extremely well . 
  i have no idea because i barely know anything about my family history further back than my grandparents . 
  as far as i know , my ancestors were all swedes as far back as anyone cares to remember . 
  i mean , most likely * someone * in my family tree came from somewhere else , but i look entirely nordic and everyone views me as such . 
  refugees and immigration . 
  it means crown ** s ** . 
  starting a new job next week . 
  40 km away , roughly 30 mins by car . 
  way too far , in my mind . 
  i was a really shy and weird kid . 
  i usually shrugged and ran away . 
  also worked !, 
  we used to vacation a lot in italy when i was a kid and we were always in these super touristy towns completely full of germans . 
  all the german kids always assumed i was german as well and tried to talk to me , but i had no way of explaining that i could n't understand them . 
  it was awkward . 
  thank you for your input . 
  much appreciated . 
  no , he 's not . 
  i just answered the question . 
  * i * think sm\u00e5land is the most beautiful place in sweden , and i do n't agree with your claims that it looks like everywhere else . 
  to you , i guess it does . 
  i 'm sorry that you ca n't see what i see . 
  nope , i 'm the most attracted to women of my own ethnicity . 
  sorry you 're not impressed with sm\u00e5land . 
  maybe it does n't come through in the pictures , but i think it 's a very unique landscape and have n't seen anything like it anywhere else in the world . 
  poland , czechia and england all have beautiful regions as well , but i do n't think they look like sm\u00e5land . 
  well i 'm sorry but that 's just nonsense . 
  most of europe looks like [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/a_20_bei_langsdorf.jpg ) . 
  to me , there is nothing more beautiful in sweden than the province where i live and grew up , called sm\u00e5land . 
  never-ending dense , hilly , moss-covered forests interspersed with lakes and farmsteads . 
  everything looks like a fairy-tale here . 
  it 's an incredibly hostile environment for human habitation though , which makes it extremely sparsely populated . 
  [ have a look !,

  the hell ? 
  not a fan of sm\u00e5land ? 
  llanelli is pronounced / \u026ca\u02c8n\u025b\u03b8li / in welsh . 
  you may be hearing that / \u026c / as / kl / , but it 's not . 
  in the ten years that i 've lived in this apartment , i think we 've had maybe two power outages , neither of them lasting for more than an hour . 
  no idea what caused them ... might have been planned for all i know , i 'm very uninformed about most things . 
  what does that even mean ? 
  how am i supposed to pronounce `` cl '' ? 
  if we 're using english ortography , the letter c tells me very little . 
  actually , the ll in welsh is pronounced / \u026c / , which is [ a sound that does n't exist in english at all ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voiceless_dental_and_alveolar_lateral_fricatives ) , and no combination of letters in english will be able to guide you . 
  pretty good approximation . 
  is this some trick to get into nordic ? 
  the only cities i ever hear said in english are stockholm and gothenburg , and neither of them are pronounced like they would be in swedish . 
  gothenburg even has a completely anglicized name , that bears very little resemblance to the swedish one . 
  here they are in swedish : [ stockholm ] ( http://vocaroo.com/i/s1wibrl1punj ) / \u02c8st\u0254k\u02d0\u02cch\u0254lm / [ g\u00f6teborg ] ( http://vocaroo.com/i/s0opd8hda2wv ) / \u02ccj\u00f8\u02d0t\u025b\u02c8b\u0254rj /, 
  there has been no agreement to freeze them out .
