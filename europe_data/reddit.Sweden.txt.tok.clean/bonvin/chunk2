  each party individually made the decision not to work with sd . 
  when the right block was in power , they sure as hell did n't cooperate with the left , so were they also suppressing millions of people then , according to you ? 
  all that 's happened now is that we have three blocks , effectively . 
  we 're not keeping sd out of politics , the majority just do n't agree with their views . 
  eh , probably copenhagen . 
  20 % is still just 20 % . 
  the vast majority of sweden is still very pro-immigration and want absolutely nothing to do with sd . 
  sucks for them , but that 's democracy for you . 
  once they get over 50 % they can form their own government and do what the hell they want , but until then they have no say in anything and no one is under any obligation to work with them . 
  valdemar and sigismund . 
  preferably twins . 
  it 's about time these names made a comeback in sweden . 
  no , it sounds horrible when * you * speak swedish . 
  when * we * speak it it 's beautiful . 
  i would n't recommend assuming everyone speaks english here . 
  i know plenty of young people with awful english . 
  lots of people either do n't want to because they 're ashamed of their pronunciation , or just ca n't be arsed to talk to a stranger ( very common here ) . 
  asking first provides an opportunity to go `` no , fuck off mate '' which is very appreciated . 
  i would prefer you to say `` excuse me , do you speak english ? 
  '' , to which i would reply `` yes '' and from then on we can just speak english . 
  do n't learn any swedish please , it sounds horrible and it 's a waste of your time and mine . 
  the weather . 
  it 's always too hot , too cold , too wet , too dry , too windy or too still . 
  we get about five truly pleasant days a year * tops * and the rest is fucking miserable . 
  you mean `` got up on the wrong side of the bed this morning ? '', 
  obviously . 
  nope . 
  you mean that they 're `` fluid '' , not fluent . 
  you can , it just takes time and practice . 
  it 's not so much that the swedes `` won '' , though . 
  most of the early medieval kings who ruled over all of sweden were actually from g\u00f6taland , so geats . 
  there is supposed to have been some kind of union between the swedes and the geats somewhere around 1000-1200 that created the kingdom of sweden , but the sources are * very * vague about what actually happened in those years - probably because it was so obvious to everyone at the time that they did n't feel the need to write it down . 
  we do n't know exactly why the nation was named after the swedes but most historians seem to rule out conquest as a reason . 
  norway was ruled by danes for most of its history . 
  sweden just took over briefly in the 19th century . 
  i think i 'm living in the best possible time for all of humanity , to be honest . 
  it 's all shit going back and i think the future is probably fucked too . 
  there 's gon na be way too many of us soon and earth wo n't put up with our bullshit much longer . 
  i think things will probably start to decline within my lifetime , our modern western way of life is n't sustainable in the long term . 
  ( but boy is it awesome ! ), 
  i did n't know that . 
  tough little buggers !, 
  i imagine most feral cats freeze to death during our winters though , so that 'll keep our numbers down . 
  they have n't evolved for this climate . 
  [ these cats ] ( http://www.jaktjournalen.se/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/lo2n.jpg ) have . 
  unless you look like that , you 're gon na have a bad time here as a cat in the wild . 
  it 's true that they can make exceptions for loan words , but it 's very rare . 
  i 'd wager svalbard would quickly become swalbard in english if it started to be used more than once a decade . 
  huh , i always thought it was like sverige ( svearike  svearige  sverige ) and went something like nordrike  norige  norge . 
  english phonology does n't allow a word to start with the sound combination / sv / , just like swedish does n't allow / sw / ( or / kzg / / tb / or whatever ) . 
  that 's the real reason , is n't it ? 
  what 's wrong with [ this ] ( http://vocaroo.com/i/s0dg6ivz1wcb ) ? 
  ` pojke/flicka ' means `` boy/girl '' , but ` duktig ' is a bit difficult to translate . 
  just take it to mean `` good '' in this context , i guess . 
  actually it 's more like `` proficient '' , but much less sciency-sounding . 
  finland , because we were one single country for almost 800 years and belong together . 
  sweden has been incomplete ever since the russians took our eastern half . 
  my middle name is johnny !, 
  uh , no . 
  we have n't `` given back '' anything . 
  russia took it !, 
  yeah , the sagas were written down in the early 13th century , hundreds of years after the viking age ended here . 
  while they 're certainly a great resource , they 're also very full of mythic nonsense and ca n't really be trusted as a factual historical document . 
  no dice . 
  we 've almost managed to teach them swedish by now , ca n't let all that work be squandered . 
  it 's always sk\u00e5ne with you danes . 
  you realize you owned halland and blekinge as well ? 
  no interest ? 
  there 's not much written here either . 
  mainly rune stones , which do n't reveal very much about what was going on . 
  i 'm thinking something similar to traditional sami people . 
  but maybe they 're not that closely related ? 
  languages seem pretty similar to me anyway . 
  milk and sugar . 
  in that order ( very important ) . 
  i started drinking lots of tea when i dated an english woman , which i still do to this day , years after we broke up . 
  bloody good . 
  boom . 
  i think for most swedes , my city is mainly known for being very religious ( as compared to the rest of sweden ) . 
  just watch . 
  i think a swedish flag with three crowns instead of a cross would have been awesome . 
  still blue and yellow obviously , just with the three crowns there . 
  i would n't change it * now * , we 're way past the point of no return with our current flag , but i 've always secretly wished the three crowns was our flag instead . 
  they do pronounce it with a / z / . 
  you 're the weird ones who think z 's should be / ts / for some reason . 
  just spell it pantser , why is z getting involved ? 
  swedish and norwegian are the same in this regard . 
  our u 's are not exactly the same as a german \u00fc , though . 
  it 's actually a kind of unique sound to our languages as far as i know , and we use this weird symbol when transcribing it : \u0289\u031f\u02d0 our y 's are the same as \u00fc 's though . 
  is that weird ? 
  i expect adjustments to be made to names for whatever language environment they 're in . 
  if i moved to an english speaking country , i 'd start to anglify my name too when introducing myself . 
  english speakers are completely unable to say it ` correctly ' anyway , unless they 're linguists or something . 
  it 's just way too different from what they 're used to . 
  and that 's swedish , which is a lot closer to english than polish . 
  partly to uphold some tradition , but mostly to entertain tourists , i 'd wager . 
  yeah , there 's a church right outside my house , like 50m away . 
  and it does annoy me , every single sunday , waking me up with their clanging . 
  just shut the fuck up already , it 's not needed . 
  everyone who planned on coming is already coming .
