  that 's pretty awesome . 
  that 's a weird name for that plant in swedish . 
  literally * iron oak * . 
  i 've heard it before but never knew what it refers to before . 
  assumed it was an oak ... 
  what 's a toff ? 
  no , i just make sure i do n't have all my giant stacks of money lying around all over the place before they come . 
  `` would of '' is a far more pressing matter . 
  the it ` sers can be taught , but i see absolutely no hope for the would ofers . 
  yup , sounds like basically the same thing but you eat different things with it . 
  i would n't say it 's delicious exactly , but it gets the job done . 
  ] ( https://res.cloudinary.com/hufennija/image/upload/f_auto,q_50,fl_progressive,w_1200,h_630,c_fill/27769725.jpg ) it 's like a thick pancake with bits of pork made in the oven instead of on the stove . 
  it 's super cheap to make and very , very filling . 
  obviously served with lingonberry jam , which every swede has at home already . 
  uh , not really . 
  we have a lot of swear words about demons , hell and satan and all that , but they 're considered mild next to the sexual ones ( cunt , cock , fag , etc. ) . 
  we do of course combine them , but when we do it 's mainly just nonsense . 
  something like * j\u00e4vla fittb\u00f6gshelvete * , for example , would be a really strong swear in swedish , and i do n't even know how to translate that . 
  it makes absolutely no sense in any language . 
  * devilish cunt-fag-hell * , i guess . 
  recently i 've been drinking a lot of karlova\u010dko . 
  it 's bloody good . 
  i do n't think we 're very funny . 
  about time we took the backseat , anyway . 
  i 'm sure you 'll treat us right . 
  and those are n't anywhere close to all the words we borrowed from low german in the middle ages . 
  there were so many germans up here for a while that it permanently changed swedish grammar and even * pronunciation * . 
  we imported prefixes like be - and ver - ( now * f\u00f6r - * in swedish ) to verbs that are still used in creating new words . 
  the old thick l that was standard swedish before is now only present in rural accents . 
  we even changed the old nordic letters \u00e6 and \u00f8 to the german \u00e4 and \u00f6 . 
  i did n't know they were scientific terms . 
  they are n't in swedish , really . 
  gyttja just means mud , pretty much - at least in everyday speech . 
  i 'd be pretty shocked to meet someone like that in sweden . 
  i think i 'd assume they would n't be able to accept * me * rather than the other way around , on account of my ungodly ways . 
  we would n't be very likely to become close friends , i 'd say . 
  yeah it is , but we made the word first and then the english loaned it as is . 
  the words `` motor '' and `` pedal '' are the same in swedish , so it worked out great . 
  interestingly , poltern comes from an indo-european root which was something like * bhel * . 
  accounting for various sound changes over the years , the swedish version ended up as buller/bullra , but still has the exact same meaning . 
  i think `` kiosk '' is turkish , too . 
  i 've never heard sloyd either . 
  i 'm only familiar with the term `` woodshop '' from american movies , but that 's specifically about tr\u00e4sl\u00f6jd . 
  yeah , it 's a pretty shitty list . 
  just stole it from wikipedia , to be honest . 
  sure . 
  it 's actually an acronym for ingvar kamprad elmtaryd agunnaryd , which is the name of the founder and the name of the farm and village where he grew up . 
  you 're right of course , but the specific use of the word `` orienteering '' for the sport where people run around in the woods with maps and compasses is swedish in origin . 
  it 's not really a word , is it ? 
  just the name of a company . 
  alvar angstrom fartlek gravlax lek lingonberry moped ombudsman orienteering sloyd smorgasbord tungsten kn\u00e4ckebr\u00f6d trapp gyttja varve ... are apparently all the swedish loanwords in english . 
  most of them are n't in common use , i guess , but there you go . 
  * every * single week ? 
  the most religious ( young ) person i 've ever known still only went on major holidays . 
  and she was pretty damn religious . 
  maybe . 
  i 'm not really involved in language policies in finland though . 
  it was n't always just 5 % though . 
  the swedish speaking population in finland used to be way higher than that , but they sort of suppressed it for a bit while they were building up their own national identity after achieving independence . 
  at what point do you go `` uh , it 's only 10 % now , fuck em '' ? 
  plenty of swedes have coats of arms . 
  [ all of the noble families ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/svenska_adels%c3%a4tter ) should have one of their own . 
  lots of them are still around . 
   `` finland gave swedish an official language status even though the swedish-speaking population is smaller and it is working fine for them '' wow , that 's a terrible argument . 
  swedish has been spoken side by side with finnish for like 800 years in finland . 
  it 's a very old phonetic rule in swedish that certain consonants turn into fricatives or glides before front vowels . 
  k is _ supposed to _ become a sh-type of sound before an e in proper swedish , there 's nothing weird about that . 
  what 's problematic about it is that `` kex '' is a loan word . 
  it comes from english `` cakes '' , which obviously has a hard k. for some swedes , it 's been so thoroughly swedified that it 's now pronounced shex , but for most it 's still kex . 
  no , but they would be if everyone drove manuals like here . 
  two or three times a week roughly . 
  i usually make enough for a couple of meals so i can eat leftovers the rest of the time . 
  will probably get some takeout once or twice a week too . 
  :p i remember that we looked at some old norse writings and compared them with modern translations , though , to see how swedish is related to it . 
  it 's not dative , it 's just the object form . 
  english does not differentiate between the accusative and dative cases grammatically . 
  it 's '' * whom * did you see ? '', 
  just as well as `` to * whom * did you give it ? 
  '' , where one is a direct object and the other is an indirect object . 
  i think what tony 's on about is that the whole whom-thing is slowly but surely dying out in english , since everyone actually says `` who did you see ? '', 
  and `` who did you give it to ? '', 
  thus , using `` whom '' ` correctly ' automatically makes you sound more proper and formal , just because it 's old and unusual at this point . 
  so how do you slice your cheese then ? 
  you 're not making sandwiches like that without an osthyvel . 
  i 'll get away with it because i 'm swedish and have a charming accent . 
  i just use `` du '' with all germans now . 
  i 've had way more people smirk at me for using `` sie '' than i 've had people taking offense to `` du '' . 
  and if someone is actually offended about that , that 's probably not a person i want to talk to anyway . 
  lighten up , sheesh . 
  from a swedish perspective , that shit is absolutely ridiculous . 
  standard swedish does n't use binding e 's like that . 
  dialects in the south do , though . 
  they do n't . 
  [ this ] ( http://ark-tryckaren.se/wp-content/themes/boilerplate/images/decor-sizes/ostmacka.png ) type of sandwich is n't a thing outside of norway and sweden . 
  i refer you to my original post . 
  i believe i 've made my stance clear here ? 
  i do n't think there should be * countries * , period . 
  not even the us airforce managed to respond in time and prevent two planes from crashing into the wtc in new york god damn city , what chance do we have of preventing something like that ? 
  none . 
  maybe if we spent every waking hour watching out for hijackers , spending billions on planes and pilots to keep our skies safe , but you know what ?
