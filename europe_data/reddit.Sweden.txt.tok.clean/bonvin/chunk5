  it 's not worth it . 
  we ca n't live in fear like that . 
  then the terrorists will have won , wo n't they ? 
  and i do n't really care about other countries violating our air space . 
  as long as you 're not dropping bombs , fly around all you like as far as i 'm concerned . 
  what 's the big deal ? 
  i 'd be all for a crisis response group in lieu of a military . 
  surely they do n't need fighter planes or aks . 
  no , totally against it . 
  in fact , i want us to completely dismantle the military and get rid of absolutely everything . 
  it 's a pointless waste of money . 
  * no one * is invading us anytime soon ; it would be complete political suicide for whoever does it for a looong time to come . 
  and if someone really is stupid and psychotic enough to attack us , our pathetic military will not deter anyone , no matter how much we spend on it . 
  and for that matter , * i * was forced into military service against my will - in 2005 , so it was n't at all voluntary back then . 
  worst year of my life . 
  fuck the army . 
  what 's funny about it is that it says `` med anor fr\u00e5n allra f\u00f6rsta b\u00f6rjan '' which is something like `` hailing from the very beginning '' , making fun of the way breweries always brag about their long heritage . 
  i do n't know if there 's a dialectal element to `` du blir vad du dricker - \u00d6rebro bitter '' . 
  it kind of reads as if * dricker * and * bitter * are supposed to rhyme , which they definitely do n't in standard swedish . 
  i do n't think it does in an \u00d6rebro accent either , but i 'm not from around there . 
  nevertheless , all regions have accents ; \u00d6rebro just has a particularly awful one . 
  part of the infamous `` whine-belt '' , where everyone sounds super negative and bummed about everything . 
  danish was a much more reasonable language back then . 
  it 's only in the past few hundred years or so that danish has diverged into the garbled mess ( and i say that most lovingly ) it is today . 
  before that we could all understand each other up here , but you danes wanted out of the community , i guess . 
  well , i 've actually studied german at university fairly recently ( 90hp in total ) , which i 'm assuming you have n't ( ? ), 
  so i do consider myself somewhat fluent at this point . 
  as for keeping it up ; i do n't , really . 
  i 'll probably forget everything in a few years and all that scholing will have been for nothing , haha . 
  but right now i 'm pretty good , at least !, 
  i love the sound of norwegian . 
  it 's like swedish from some sort of fairytale land , spoken by magical gnomes . 
  in order of fluency : swedish , english , german . 
  also understand norwegian just fine , and to a lesser degree danish , though i ca n't speak either without insulting millions of people . 
  actually swedish and danish are from the same branch ( east norse ) while the others are from west norse . 
  then danish ruined norwegian and made it very different from the other west norse languages and much more similar to ours . 
  that 's why icelandic and faroese are so weird and swedish and norwegian are so familiar to you . 
  well , danish and swedish are n't exactly alike . 
  yeah , sure , but that means `` it gives meaning '' , which is n't the same thing . 
  the phrase `` to make sense '' has quite a specific meaning that really ca n't be translated into swedish satisfyingly . 
  the closest you 'd come is something like `` det \u00e4r vettigt '' , meaning `` that 's reasonable/sensible '' . 
  it 's * sort of * the same , but i keep finding myself wanting to say the exact phrase `` that makes sense '' in swedish , and i ca n't . 
  it 's frustrating . 
  that 's nothing . 
  in swedish it 's very common to say `` det make : ar sense '' , which is just `` it makes sense '' with a swedish pronoun and a swedish present tense inflection on the verb ( - ar ) instead of an english one . 
  extremely ugly , but i do n't really know a way around it . 
  it 's such an immensely useful phrase , and there 's no way whatsoever to translate the actual words into swedish and have it * make sense * . 
  no matter how bad you think '' \u00e7a fait sens '' sounds in french , i promise you `` det g\u00f6r sinne '' sounds worse . 
  it 's utter nonsense . 
  i was completely enamored with the city when i was there - the super old architecture , the buildings leaning against one another - ridiculously thin and weird looking - all stacked in crazy rows by the hundreds along the canals , interspersed with monstrous churches and cathedrals . 
  everything looking as if it 's about to fall into the sea at any moment , but is held up by the sheer insane beauty of it all , as if god himself ca n't bring himself to let it go . 
  and as you go out from the absolute centre of the city , the architecture gradually becomes more and more modern - from medieval to renaissance to classic to today - in a super organic and natural way that is just oh so pleasing to my eyes . 
  absolutely loved it . 
  i felt * ashamed * of what we 've done to our cities in sweden after i had been there . 
  dude , his first post makes it pretty obvious that he 's norwegian . 
  he starts by comparing swedish to norwegian and then goes into confusing false friends between those languages , indicating he speaks at least one of them . 
  since he is answering your question about what swedish sounds like , we can probably assume that he is n't swedish . 
  i do n't really see how you could possibly find this the least bit confusing . 
  we have a difficult time saying / d\u0292 / , as in ** j ** ump or ** g ** ermany , because that sound does n't exist in swedish , so it often comes out as / j / , as in ** y ** ump and ** y ** ermany ( with english phonology ) , because that 's how those letters would be pronounced if we were speaking swedish . 
  haha , it took me like 10 tries , but i think he 's trying to say `` har bj\u00f6rnar samlag med varandra i skogen ? '', 
  `` do bears have intercourse with each other in the forest ? '', 
  yeah , sure . 
  very idiomatic . 
  there are a couple of weird dialects over there that can actually be pretty hard to place , that do n't have that characteristic finnishness to it . 
  do n't know where exactly , but i 've definitely heard swedish speaking finns that i would n't be able to identify as such . 
  they all sound * weird * , for sure , just not necessarily finnish . 
  but yeah , in general it 's very easy to tell a swedish speaking finn from a swede . 
  standard swedish is quite obviously rooted in the swedish spoken around stockholm , though . 
  although the stockholm accent itself is/was quite distinct , uppland and s\u00f6dermanland is where the standard comes from to begin with . 
  we 'd have a way different standard swedish if gothenburg had been our capital , i 'd say . 
  from who ? 
  norrk\u00f6ping has a * very * particular dialect , which is absolutely not standard swedish . 
  the actual town usually mentioned as having the most neutral accent is nyk\u00f6ping ... and that view is * really * old . 
  even as far back as the 1600s , immigrants were encouraged to move to nyk\u00f6ping to learn a nice type of swedish that they could use all over the country . 
  i mean ... what 's the point , really ? 
  it 's not worth it , is it ? 
  `` it smells ** absolutely putrid ** but tastes * pretty good * '' . 
  yeah , so , let 's not waste time with it ?!, 
  there are plenty of things to eat that do n't smell putrid but taste excellent . 
  i just do n't get it . 
  i agree , but i do n't think the election vs coronation of gustav vasa is where we need to start the battle . 
  is it really that important to be able to differentiate between being elected and crowned for the average person ? 
  i 'm just glad people have any idea that june 6th has to do with gustav vasa becoming king , personally . 
  most swedes tend to not give two shits about our history , in my experience . 
  right [ here ] ( https://www.google.se/maps/@57.7827301,14.1690957,299m/data=!3m1!1e3 ) , pretty much . 
  there 's a short canal connecting lake v\u00e4ttern with lake munksj\u00f6n that divides j\u00f6nk\u00f6ping into a western and an eastern half . 
  just different , i guess . 
  too many diphthongs . 
  standard swedish does n't have dipthongs at all . 
  we have short vowels , and we have long vowels , and it 's systematic and orderly . 
  english vowels are all over the god damn place in comparison ( to me ) . 
  but mostly , the problem is with the english ortography . 
  take these sequences of letters for example : `` per '' , `` pir '' , `` pur '' , `` pyr '' , `` perr '' , `` pirr '' , `` purr '' , `` pyrr '' you 'd most likely pronounce all of those in exactly the same way , right ? 
  ( like [ this ] ( http://vocaroo.com/i/s102rgromhxa ) ) to a swedish speaker , that is completely ridiculous . 
  why even have all those letters when you ca n't use them correctly ? 
  * all * of those would have a unique and distinct pronunciation in swedish ortography ( like [ this ] ( http://vocaroo.com/i/s0p8npjidksu ) ) . 
  swedes do too , and most of us have no idea that there even is a z sound at all ( that is a separate phoneme from s ) in the english language . 
  lets all go to the soo and pet the sebras !, 
  for the longest time ( well into my 20s ) , i actually thought the ( names of the ) letters c and z were both pronounced exactly the same ( `` see '' ) in american english ( since brits say `` zed '' ) , and could n't for the life of my figure out why they would do something like that . 
  it was n't until i mentioned it to an american that i finally realized that z is its own sound .
