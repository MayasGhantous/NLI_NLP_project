  he was incredibly confused by my question ... `` the same ? 
  what are you even talking about ? '', 
  yeah but i happen to be from a region of sweden that pretty much decided to completely skip all r 's , so i have just as much trouble with those as you do . 
  `` bord '' in my dialect : / bu :d / our vowels must be pretty brutal for an english speaker though , yes . 
  i was only talking about consonants . 
   danish comes much more naturally , at least to me . 
  you are now banned from / r/sweden . 
  i think that 's it though ? 
  and it 's not even that important , lots of dialects do n't even use that sound . 
  whereas i had to learn t\u0361\u0283 , d\u0361\u0292 , \u0292 , z , \u03b8 , \u00f0 , w , and \u0279 completely from scratch . 
  i ca n't really remember . 
  i reached ( near ) fluency at a very young age ( like most swedes , i guess ) , so i have no clear memories of actively learning it . 
  feels like i just knew it one day somehow . 
  never had any problems with the grammar that i can recall - even the progressive tenses that people ( germans ) complain about always felt completely natural to me , even though we have nothing like it in swedish . 
  took a while to learn how to spell everything since the ortography is completely fucked , but that was n't a huge deal . 
  i would say pronunciation was ( and is ) probably the hardest part about learning english for me , because it 's so very very different from swedish . 
  your vowels are all wrong and stupid , you have several consonants that do n't exist in swedish whatsoever , and you speak with this weird flat melody that is completely unnatural to me . 
  difficult to say if swedish is more similar to german or english . 
  grammar wise it 's probably english ( word order and such ) , but we have so much more in common with german when it comes to vocabulary , because we both skipped all that french nonsense that ruined english forever . 
  there was nothing here before us . 
   swedish spoken by a supposed accent coach  wow , it 's the hollywood swedish accent . 
  that 's exactly how swedes always sound in american movies and shows . 
  like , if some swedes popped up in the simpsons or something for some reason , they 'd all talk like * that * . 
  it 's like americans have completely made up an accent they think we * ought to * have and just decided to go with it . 
  `` fuck it , that 's probably what they sound like , right ? '', 
  the weird part is that it seems so consistent . 
  it 's always the * same * weird fake accent , to the point where i wonder if a real swedish accent would sound fake to most americans ... 
  you build up a tolerance to caffeine . 
  i live in a neighbourhood with lots of black people , so i see several every day . 
  it 's `` s\u00f6t * e * bror '' in swedish too . 
  what 's with the `` s\u00f6ta bror '' i always hear you call us ? 
  do n't you guys use \u00f8 ? 
  no one really has any clue how long people have lived here . 
  oldest trace of settlement is [ this weird hill/grave ] ( https://arkeologijonkoping.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/rac3a4-6_lustigkulle_2012-img_1516_beskuren.jpg ) from the bronze age , well over 2000 years old . 
  the town got city rights in 1284 , though . 
  i realize it does n't help anyone , but it 's actually extremely frustrating to be a part of such a conversation . 
  imagine some foreigner walking up to you speaking in super broken , heavy accented english , and you barely understand half of what he 's saying , while it 's painfully obvious that he does n't understand half of what you 're saying either . 
  and the whole time you know that you actually speak * his * native language fluently and could make this situation comprehensible for both of you at any moment . 
  it 's not easy . 
  i 'm not actually all that aware of or interested in every single difference in spelling and vocabulary , so i most likely mix them up all the time . 
  it 's pretty minor stuff overall anyway , so i do n't really see the point in delving any deeper . 
  i do n't think we were taught one or the other really in school . 
  in theory it 's supposed to be uk english on the curriculum , but they would almost always point out the differences as they came up , so in effect we were taught both , i guess ? 
  in speech i do n't think i sound like either . 
  mostly just swedish . 
  i would assume he was fucking with me , to be honest . 
  the scenario is so unlikely that i ca n't even speculate . 
  the english pronunciation even breaks several phonological rules in swedish . 
  to the untrained ear they might sound kind of similar , but there are some fundamental differences . 
  just look at how they are actually said : swedish : / \u02c8ju\u02d0han\u02ccs\u0254n / english : / d\u0292o\u028a\u02c8h\u00e6ns\u0259n / even if you do n't know ipa you can probably tell that it 's quite a stretch . 
  that some grandfather hundreds of years ago ( when they did n't even have surnames like we do today , and definitely did n't speak english ) randomly would have decided to say / d\u0292o\u028a\u02c8h\u00e6ns\u0259n / is completely unthinkable . 
  for whatever reason we write it like this when we use the `` title '' : * s : t eriks kyrka * but usually it 's just called the name + the church in a compound : * sofiakyrkan *, 
  they 're both called europa . 
  it 's not confusing in the slightest . 
  yeah . 
  my parents actually used to make moonshine at home when i was a kid . 
  i did n't really know what was going on , just that i was to stay away from one room in the house . 
  it looked like a pretty serious operation , with several tanks and hoses and weird smells . 
  they sold all the equipment to a neighbour when we moved into an apartment in the city . 
  so yeah , pretty common i 'd say . 
  we were n't abnormal weirdos or anything , so i 'd guess this is going on in lots of swedish homes . 
  personally i do n't drink much ( and never hard liquor ) , so i would n't know much about the scene . 
  yeah , gets a bit iffy the further back you go since modern day swedes are a mish mash of various north germanic peoples/tribes/whatever that inhabited these lands . 
  the divide between geats and swedes was still very real in the middle ages ( even between east geats and west geats ) , so it feels weird to talk about them as ` we ' , when they did n't even see themselves as one people . 
  i might say ` we ' about the vikings when speaking from a scandinavian perspective , though . 
  yeah . 
  swedish grammar is overall much less complex than german in terms of agreements and inflections . 
  they are less inflected than in german . 
  for one thing we have no cases and no case markers . 
  also we only have two genders so it 's less complicated still . 
  it 's the same type of system though , just a bit simplified . 
  it 's because they are non-gendered words ( ett-words ) and thus get a - t ending on their adjectives . 
  the word for afraid , `` r\u00e4dd '' ends with a double d and wo n't allow that inflection . 
  `` r\u00e4ddt '' or `` r\u00e4dt '' breaks swedish pronunciation rules . 
  `` r\u00e4tt '' could be an option , but it 's so uncommonly used in that way that it sounds super weird . 
  `` r\u00e4tt '' also already means `` correct '' , which is another adjective entirely , complicating things further . 
  edit : oh , and plurals get an - a ending instead ( r\u00e4dda ) , so that 's what that 's about . 
  this sometimes complicates translating from english , since you * have to * be specific in swedish . 
  i read some article about how it was a pain to translate donald duck comics , because they kept throwing aunts and uncles into the mix . 
  swedish translators just guessed how they were all related most of the time . 
  then when they finally released some official family tree , of course it turns out that we got about half of them wrong . 
  `` att lida '' in swedish means `` to suffer '' . 
  not as known as gustav vasa , but yeah , definitely a famous king . 
  i think we 'd probably need to go with sabaton on this one . 
  i think they have a whole album about sweden kicking ass . 
   reading it , it looks like `` yanker '' and that 's pretty much what it means . 
  the - are suffix is equivalent to the - er in english ( as in runn ** er ** ) . 
  coke or beer . 
  uh , it 's definitely different . 
  it reminded me of danish . 
  yeah , i 'd say it 's pretty common . 
  we say * j\u00e4nkare * , though , which is a very swedified version of the word . 
  i think a lot of it is that horrible pronunciation of g that is present in some dutch accents and not others , ( the one that sounds like you 're coughing up phlegm ) . 
  i have no idea which accents do that and which do n't , though . 
  all this talk of the singiness of swedish makes me wish i could hear it from the outside , without understanding it . 
  to me it just sounds like words and sentences , to everyone else it apparently sounds like a bunch of people going around singing cutely all the time . 
  must sound pretty fascinating . 
  but at least i get to hear danish from a swedish perspective , which is one of the funniest things in existence .
