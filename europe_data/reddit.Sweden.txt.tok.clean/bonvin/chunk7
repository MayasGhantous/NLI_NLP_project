  i 'm heading far north . 
  northern sweden is basically a desolate wasteland as it is . 
  less people , less problems . 
  yeah , so what ? 
  there 's nothing inherently * evil * about socialism or communism , as with , say , fascism . 
  i do n't see why communist/socialist parties should n't be allowed to exist . 
  i 'm not going to argue the merits of communism because i 'm not a communist . 
  you do n't agree with the ideology , and that 's fine . 
  others do and i suggest you take it up with them . 
  just because the russians fucked it up that does n't mean the whole ideology is garbage . 
  we mostly say them in a swedish way if we 're speaking swedish . 
  like , we use english sounds ( if we know how to pronounce the name ) , but with a clear swedish stress and intonation pattern . 
  goes for all geographic names , not just the weird ones . 
  sure , i 've certainly heard it once in a while and been aware of its existence . 
  but what i meant was that i 've actually dabbled a bit in finnish once upon a time ( though gave up almost immediately in trying to learn it ) , whereas i 've done absolutely no research into any other non-indo-european language . 
  to clarify ; the difference has nothing to do with stress , it 's just the tone that 's different ( the stress is on the first syllable in both of the examples ) . 
  stress on the second syllable would sound like this : [ stockholm ] ( http://vocaroo.com/i/s0alhovkpnxq ) ( very difficult to say like that ) and no , it 's absolutely not necessary to master tonality to be understood - like you say , context will take care of the cases where a misunderstanding might occur . 
  i 'm not here to say `` you all must learn this if you want to speak swedish '' , just that this is something that * we * do that is weird and interesting . 
  it 's different in different dialects , but all dialects do do it systematically . 
  for example , some northern dialects sound to me like they 've reversed the whole thing ( use an acute accent where i would use a grave , and the other way around ) . 
  so where i 'll say [ stockholm ] ( http://vocaroo.com/i/s0mesubqmrkr ) , they 'll say [ stockholm ] ( http://vocaroo.com/i/s0bl6xlkapyu ) , which is weird as hell . 
  finnish , i guess . 
  it 's the only one i 've had any experience with whatsoever . 
  one of the more interesting aspects about swedish is that it is a partially tonal language , which is what gives it that weird melodic bounciness that foreigners always remark on as being characteristically swedish . 
  much like chinese , we actually distinguish between several word pairs purely by tone , which would otherwise be pronounced exactly alike : [ anden ( the spirit ) - anden ( the duck ) ] ( http://vocaroo.com/i/s1wsboc4ap8r ) [ stegen ( the steps ) - stegen ( the ladder ) ] ( http://vocaroo.com/i/s0jqoejniapt ) [ tomten ( santa clause ) - tomten ( the yard ) ] ( http://vocaroo.com/i/s0apc1xz1ydu ) [ ljuden ( the sounds ) - juden ( the jew ) ] ( http://vocaroo.com/i/s1sowvmv1kme ) [ normen ( the norm ) - norrm\u00e4n ( norwegians ) ] ( http://vocaroo.com/i/s13x6cdfvsip ) can you tell the difference ? 
  the lack of adherence to tonality is always a dead give-away that the speaker is not native . 
  to pronounce swedish `` properly '' , you have to pretty much master and know this for every single word in the language , or you 'll sound off . 
  yeah , no , that 's absolutely the case for most swedes as well , i think . 
  if i hear danish with subtitles on it 's usually very clear to me , but as soon as i 'm not reading it at the same time , the words turn into a garbled , impenetrable mess . 
  swedish is probably just as incomprehensible in the reverse if you 're not used to it . 
  even though we tend to think we pronounce our language very clearly , or `` as it is written '' , and that danes just skip half the letters , that 's not really the case . 
  we just have very different phonologies . 
  i see my family once a year - at christmas - and that 's a bit too much , honestly . 
  there 's also * f\u00f6renta staterna * ( united states ) , but that 's a bit archaic . 
  you lost me at * r is a vowel * . 
  ** j\u00f6nk\u00f6pingsbo ** ( resident of the city of j\u00f6nk\u00f6ping ) , ** sm\u00e5l\u00e4nning ** ( male from the province of sm\u00e5land - female would be * sm\u00e5l\u00e4ndska * ) , ** svensk ** ( male swede - female would be * svenska * ) . 
  well , they 'd only need to know how to pronounce `` sverige '' , i guess . 
  which , to be fair , is n't really straightforward either . 
  soft g 's are n't really a thing outside of swedish . 
  no , no one can pronounce a fraction of them correctly in another language anyway . 
  how am i going to pronounce `` hrvatska '' ? 
  the consonant cluster `` hrv '' is not even a valid sequence of sounds to me , i have absolutely no idea what my mouth is supposed to do to pronounce that . 
  and that 's from a fairly closely related indo-european language ... 
  it only gets worse from there . 
  care to elaborate ? 
  i might be . 
  i 'm not a very ` international ' person as it is , i barely know anyone that is n't swedish . 
  thus my english , though quite advanced , is and has always been purely utilitarian . 
  i have no personality of my own in english - it 's just a tool that i use when i ca n't communicate with the person in swedish . 
  i do n't feel like i could ever truly get to know another person in any other language . 
  perhaps it 's just a matter of needing to use it more and it would eventually become as natural to me , but that has n't happened yet . 
  like i said , this is not some rule i 've set in stone for myself , i 'd give anything a shot when it comes to love . 
  norwegians are usually fine to talk to , it 's very similar in pronunciation , but i can barely understand a word of spoken danish . 
  i dunno , i do n't think i 've ever met a non-native speaker with whom i feel like i can communicate as naturally and effortlessly as i do with native speakers . 
  the tiny nuances largely disappear , is my experience . 
  and with a significant other i would want us to understand each other perfectly . 
  it 's probably a bit different with huge languages like spanish or english because so many people learn them to almost absolute fluency . 
  that 's not really the case with swedish since foreigners can pretty much always resort to english , so very very few people actually reach such levels . 
  that said , i 'm not closing any doors here . 
  i 'm willing to try with anyone i feel a connection with - just stating my preference . 
  i 'd want my significant other to be a native swedish speaker . 
  nope , nothing like that . 
  we did have plenty of * friluftsdagar * ( lit . 
  `` free air days '' - maybe `` open air days '' is a better translation ) , though , when we went out and spent the day in the forest instead of school . 
  probably taught us a bunch of useful stuff - which berries and whatnot you can eat , how to make fires , etc , but i ca n't really remember anything . 
  i eventually stopped going on those when i got a bit older because i rather stayed home and played video games . 
  i 'd be fucked in the woods . 
  i would n't answer the phone with `` hall\u00e5 det \u00e4r ... '' nor just `` hej '', 
  `` hej det \u00e4r ... '' `` hey it 's . . or just `` hall\u00e5 '', 
  he did n't ask about that at all though . 
  lots of variation . 
  every city and region has a distinct dialect in sweden . 
  it 's getting less pronounced though , we 're all pulling towards a more standardized accent , but pronunciation still varies wildly across sweden ( and finland ) . 
  some finn tried to teach me the concept of unstressed long vowels once , and it made absolutely no sense to me . 
  that is an unacceptable way of speaking . 
  what 's wrong with `` der dativ ist der tod des genitivs '' ? 
  that 's how i learned german . 
  ... and then once you 've shoved all this crap into your head and actually know how and when to use these articles and endings , you realize in the middle of a sentence that you do n't actually know the gender of the word anyway , so it makes no difference . 
  german !, 
  i am from sm\u00e5land , just north of sk\u00e5ne . 
  perhaps you did n't see my sneaky edit  every time !, 
  and yeah standard swedish has rolled r 's , but i happen to be a southerner so i speak with guttural r 's in swedish . 
  it feels much more natural to use them in german as well . 
  it 's just this one god damn sound combination that i ca n't produce . 
  the word * nachricht * is my arch nemesis . 
  the back `` ch '' followed by a guttural r is completely impossible for me to say fluently . 
  i have to go * nach * - pause - * richt * , and then it 's fine . 
  germans always tell me to just go with a trilled r there if it 's too hard , but i ca n't abide having to say this one word in a fucking austrian accent when everything else i say sounds super northern german . 
  yeah but i 'm not about to learn a non-standard accent because that would be ridiculous and kind of offensive . 
  * fuck , there 's that swede with the stupid forced irish accent , let 's hope he does n't see us ... * ... is what it would probably be like . 
  well , no one says you 're * supposed to * , but native speakers * do * . 
  i hope it 's clear enough for you now . 
  `` analysis '' trips me up every time . 
  my biggest issue is knowing which syllable to stress in long and obscure words . 
  do n't really have a problem with any particular sound in english if i concentrate , although in rapid speech i 'll definitely fuck up some consonants here and there . 
  mix up v 's and w 's , `` th '' comes out as `` d '' , `` t '' or `` f '' depending on position , some `` ch 's '' turn into `` sh 's '' , `` j 's '' into `` y 's '' , `` z 's '' into `` s 's '' . 
  standard swedish mistakes . 
  it 's also very difficult to speak as flatly as you 're supposed to do in english . 
  my swedish bouncy up-and-down melody is quite noticeable . 
  and when i try to get rid of it i sound like a robot instead .
