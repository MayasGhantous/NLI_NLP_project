   wie gerne w\u00fcrd ich jetzt in schweden sein i want to go back 10 years and show that to my german teacher who said that `` w\u00fcrde sein '' is strictly forbidden and you 're always supposed to use `` w\u00e4re '' . 
   then there is sk\u00e5ne ( and areas close to ) . 
  people around where i live usually does n't like the dialect there , probably * because it 's the go-to choice in commercials and such for some reason * . 
  what ? 
  it 's perfect . 
  he even has a thick stockholm accent . 
  sounds completely like a native swede . 
  i just realized that you think of fuel economy completely backwards from us . 
  miles per gallon - distance/amount , whereas we go amount/distance ( liter per kilometer ) . 
  how interesting . 
  [ cornelis vreeswijk - somliga g\u00e5r med trasiga skor ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwhxsqol_v0 ) is the best song ever written in swedish , in my opinion . 
  netherlands , thank you for this man . 
  the last change was actually in 1985 , when they redrew the border between finland and sweden on some tiny island , because the finns had built a lighthouse on the swedish side . 
  i think most people know it . 
  it 's just two verses and pretty simple , i ca n't imagine it not sticking . 
  the east swedes are definitely in or sweden is definitely out . 
  too soon . 
  well , we both know that norway is n't a real country anyway , do n't we ? 
  it 's just a battle ground for sweden and denmark . 
  what would be the point ? 
  thing is that pretty much * everything * about christianity has pagan roots originally , since it 's all a hodge podge of various religions that preceded it . 
  if religious people are going to get upset about that and call us heretics for reasonable theorizing , they should n't ask at all , but just go about their business . 
  i kind of hate that it 's so trendy right now because it makes me look like i 'm trying to be trendy , when in fact i 'm just lazy and ca n't be arsed to shave more than once a year . 
  there used to be a really complicated system of titles and/or complete pronoun avoidance ( needlessly complicated phrases like : * would a cup of coffee be wished for ? 
  * ) , but ever since the sixties/seventies , everyone is on a first name basis and `` du '' with one another . 
  notable exception would be the king , i suppose . 
  younger people in the service industry have also recently started to adopt some kind of european politeness system where they use `` ni '' ( the plural * you * ) in the singular as a formal address , which is pretty stupid since that was never a thing in sweden , and could actually be interpreted as rude . 
  `` ni '' was how you adressed people * below * you in the social hierarchy that did n't have a proper title , since `` du '' was unthinkable with strangers back then . 
  nevertheless , it 's a thing now and i could easily see us developing a new kind of formality based on that in the coming years . 
  what 's funny is that it 's usually old ( er ) people who get called `` ni '' , since clueless youngsters assume that they 're used to that , but even disregarding the fact that `` ni '' - ing is not how to be traditionally formal in swedish , the older generation are the ones who * stopped * with all the bullshit and started to `` du '' everyone , so why the hell would they want the formality back ? 
  remind them of the moon landing , how you saved them in world war 2 and shit on the metric system . 
  the thing about american accent being the original british accent is a gross misconception that i 'm pretty sick of hearing . 
  no one is even claiming that . 
  neither modern day british nor american accents sound like 18th century english , they have all evolved very much . 
  the thing that is noteworthy is that american accents have retained certain features that have n't survived in england , but the reverse is obviously also true . 
  same goes for australian for that matter . 
  not to mention that there were obviously a multitude of accents back then as well and pinpointing an `` original '' accent is impossible to begin with . 
  people do tend to exaggerate the problem when it 's something new and scary that they do n't like . 
  i 've never seen them do shit but sit there awkwardly , say hello and ask for a krona . 
  i 'm convinced that 's all they ever do . 
  they just sit outside of stores and awkwardly greet everyone that comes in or out , to be honest . 
  not a big issue . 
  it 's not , norway 's just ridiculously expensive . 
  sweden is very expensive compared to just about any country * other * than norway . 
  for some reason i always say `` endurance '' with the stress on the first syllable rather than the second where it 's supposed to be . 
  en-du-rance as opposed to en-du-rance . 
  i make it sound like a planet in star wars or something according to my friends when they tease me about it . 
  swedish is my native language . 
  i use it every single day since i live in sweden and have to communicate with swedes a lot . 
  english is my second language . 
  i use it every day as well , mostly reading and writing ( on reddit ) and listening ( to podcasts/tv-shows , etc ) . 
  do n't speak it very often , but it happens . 
  when i go abroad or meet foreigners for example . 
  german is my third language . 
  i use it pretty much every day in school since i 'm studying it , but probably not as much as i should in my free time . 
  obviously use it when i go to germany , which is like once a year . 
  i 'd get rid of systembolaget and have any store be allowed to sell alcoholic beverages . 
  next choice is to legalize cannabis , but you said one law , and i think systembolaget is the most pressing . 
  just looked it up and it turns out gothenburg got the nickname during the industrialisation , where apparently brits were instrumental in shaping the city . 
  well aware of chinatowns , by the way . 
  grew up on american movies . 
  only two come to mind at the moment . 
  g\u00f6teborg ( gothenburg ) is sometimes called `` lilla london '' ( little london ) . 
  not really sure why , to be honest . 
  my city , j\u00f6nk\u00f6ping , is often called `` sveriges jerusalem '' ( sweden 's jerusalem ) , because we 've got lots of churches . 
  edit : i remembered another important one . 
  stockholm is widely known as `` fjolltr\u00e4sk '' in the rest of sweden . 
  not sure how to translate that , but something like `` sissy swamp '' . 
  i think it 's self-explanatory . 
  in german , both of those mean that you 're no longer friends . 
  you 'd have to use the present tense and say `` i am friends with bob since 5 years '' for it to still apply . 
  `` swedish * have * 9 vowels '' should be `` swedish * has * 9 vowels '' . 
  does n't change the fact that i see lots of english speakers using czechia and lots of czechs protesting against it . 
  i just wanted to comment on the situation . 
  sure glad no one overreacted , misinterpreted , jumped to conclusions or attacked me for it . 
  you 're having a completely different argument than i am , though . 
  * i 'm * not saying czechia or czechian is correct or incorrect , nor do i care whatsoever . 
  i 'm simply saying which words english speakers use for your country are entirely up to them . 
  it just bugs me when czechs insist that no one should use `` czechia '' , and i thought that was what you were doing . 
  maybe , but the discussion that followed between us suggests otherwise . 
  thinking specifically of this exchange : * me : why should you have any say in what words english uses ? 
  him : because that 's my country * that 's not a valid reason . 
  i interpreted it as him protesting against the new word `` czechia '' that is gaining popularity in english . 
  it was n't really targeted at him specifically , but at all czechs who feel they need to weigh in on the debate . 
  there 's no need for childish namecalling . 
  sure , but that 's not the point . 
  the point is that czechs should n't be involved in deciding whether it 's `` czechia '' or `` czech republic '' in english whatsoever . 
  but it 's not your language , you do n't get to dictate how they should refer to you or your country in their own language . 
  can be , sure , but i never really struggled with it . 
  we mostly learn to speak english here before we start writing it , since we watch so much american television , so the difficulty is more in learning how to spell , much like it would be for native speakers , i imagine . 
   we 're czechs , not czechians , you dork  why should you have any say in what words english uses ? 
  what if i started telling you how to say sweden in czech ? 
  it 's none of my business , is it ? 
  please , please , do n't use \u0160v\u00e9dsko , i do n't like it . 
  ridiculous , right ? 
  english is very easy to learn for scandinavians ( because of many reasons that we do n't need to explore here ) , but the one mistake i do make a lot is remembering to conjugate verbs according to the subject . 
  for example : `` i intend '' , `` they intend '' , but `` he intend ** s ** '' . 
  it 's not difficult to understand , just something i have to actively think about . 
  edit : i often see other swedes make the same mistake as well . 
  look at [ this swede ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/5kw7vd/whats_a_difficult_concept_in_english_to/dbr4a7x/ ) in this very thread , for instance .
