well , it 's mostly americans who love that dumb joke , is n't it ? 
  so i think we probably wo n't get very much of that crap in here . 
   on wednesday you mean every other week ? 
  on swedish radio we have several entertainment shows ( one example is ` p\u00e5 minuten ' where two teams get a subject and have to improvise a story that is sixty seconds or shorter ( this is repeated a few times ) and they get points and penalties based on how well they follow the rules but the points do n't really matter because they 're not very consistent in enforcing the rules and the winners are picked based on who the guest judge liked best . 
  very fun . ), 
  and radio plays , do n't you have that in italy . 
  i dislike the sweden democrats as much as any sane person ( there 're quite a lot of them in / r/sweden so i think i can predict what type of response that line might get me ) but i ca n't condone some of the methods that some of the `` anti-fascist people '' are using . 
  in a democratic country you do n't gather a mob to stop people ( who have a permit ) from rallying , no matter how shitty their opinions are and you do n't fucking throw rocks and ammonia at the police and their horses while calling them `` nazi protecting pigs '' for trying to do their job and prevent as many people as possible from getting hurt . 
  fourth , actually . 
  i 'm guessing you 're the type of person who 'd enjoy sumatran poop coffee aka [ kopi luwak ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kopi_luwak ) . 
  you had two pictures of visby but none of them was showing the wall . 
   also , is being peaceful always the right choice ? 
  when the rest of europe were struggling either fighting or resisting the nazis , sweden were making big profits selling goods to them . 
  you seem to forget that denmark also tried to stay neutral . 
  germany needed that steel and they were going to get it one way or another . 
  the options were to either sell it to them or have them invade and take it at a huge loss of life for sweden whose military would n't stand a chance against germany . 
  i 'd say that given what options were on the table they went with the less shitty one . 
  other than that i agree that our weapons industry is something to be ashamed of . 
  well , it sort of was , lot 's of guns , ammo , money and volunteers were sent from sweden to finland and then there 's the child refugees that were sent to sweden . 
  maybe it 's two .55 people that makes it look that way . 
  the only ones who do n't think those are embarrassing is the intern ( assuming ) who made it and the people who approved it, 
  garlic sauce is a must on kebab pizza , other pizzas you put bearnaise on . 
  if this no borders thing means that we can have some of norways oil money , then i 'm all for it . 
  and if it were n't for the clouds you 'd see their bombers doing training runs on gotland . 
  your coast guard can use it . 
  give them a ship to be proud of . 
  it 's hard to listen to too . 
  if only people would have listened to our words of warning . 
  they can protect me any day . 
  nah , that 's just one of his goons . 
  i 'm wondering if those are his daughters , his girlfriends or his daughter and his girlfriend . 
  * russian troops stormed ukrainian military bases in crimea . 
  my brother in law 's mother lives in the us and my sister says that it 's strange to see how over there , the only people you 'll see walking anywhere are junkies and homeless people . 
  the business with germany during the war is certainly not something to be proud of but it gets a bit tiresome when people look at the steel trade , overlooks everything else sweden did and sees it as some kind of proof of sweden being best buddies with nazi germany . 
  it 's not like they could tell germany to piss off , sweden would have been conquered almost as quickly as norway and denmark was , selling it to them at a price beats giving it away for free after a lot of the country 's young men have been killed and a few cities have been bombed . 
  denmark and norway tried to play the neutrality card but it did n't work because they had nothing to bargain with . 
  i guess funding , sheltering and helping to train the norwegian and to a lesser extent the danish resistance fighters did n't really matter ? 
  it might have something to do with what 's written at the bottom .

  damn it !, 
  first i find out that i ca n't shove my head up the bum of the queen of england and now i find out that i do n't have a fallback plan if i realize that being a parent is n't for me , this day has been all bad news for me . 
  and stealthy spec ops bunnies . 
  `` why is turkey bad for dogs ? '', 
  come to think of it , i experienced this phenomenon in another thread recently : http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/1vftrr/what_cliche_about_your_countryregion_is_not_true/ces90e0?context=6, 
  crap !, 
  he stole my joke three years before i thought of it . 
  so , world peace wo n't come until the space aliens land ? 
  not my country , not even a european one but i 've always liked this picture of the new zealand police in action . 
  from the article it sounds like denmark is worse than sweden , not the other way around . 
  flaming arrows could be a bad idea if the archer is a novice , you would n't want him to miss and hit a house or one of those guards with a flaming arrow . 
  what kind of fucked up language does n't have c ? 
  ^ ^ ^ said ^ ^ ^ affectionately, 
  do n't shit where you eat . 
  do icelanders really like fences ? 
  at least iceland has our backs . 
  northern swedes often joke about how gay stockholmers are . 
  same thing with swedish . 
  there 's a movie that i 've forgotten the name of but it 's about a family from yugoslavia that lives in sweden and the father who works as a hotdog vendor has some troubles with the swedish language , one of the things he ca n't quite grasp is how to know if it 's a short or a long vowel , which leads to a funny situation . 
  i do n't remember why but i think he made some misstake and as an apology he offers to lower the price for a customer but instead of saying `` jag prutar p\u00e5 korven '' / `` i 'll give you the hotdog for a lower price '' , he said `` jag prutta p\u00e5 korven '' / `` i farted on the hotdog '' ( pruta-lower the price/prutta-fart ) the customer thinks he 's some kind of nutter and refuses to take the hotdog , the hotdog dad does n't take no for and answer and tries to get the customer to take the hot dog while repeatedly saying `` jag prutta p\u00e5 korven '' / `` i farted on the hotdog '', 
  yup , it 's just that the guy 's logic is priceless . 
  en annan klassiker : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqqtdvpxvmc, 
  i do n't know why but this reminded me of an old prank call , which is in swedish but the gist of it is that some guy calls up `` yes to eu '' and says that his friend told him that if sweden joins eu 10000 german faggots will come to sweden . 
  the girl on the phone says that that sounds completely bizarre . 
  the guy sounds satisfied and to reasure himself , asks : `` you 're not going to let any faggots into the country ? '', 
  the girl starts to get annoyed and says that of course they ca n't stop gays from entering the country . 
  the guy : so there 's going to be ca 10k gay immigrants ? 
  and then it goes back and forward until they guy comes to the conclusion that there 're going to come 100 000 german faggots and the girl just goes along with it . 
  why do so many europe maps cut out so much of the nordic countries ? 
  and apparently neither is sweden north of falun nor norway north of bergen . 
  can we keep sending it to the yanks , i wa n't more videos like this : http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=d81_1366853584, 
  and i also do n't think giving military and weapons training to 13500 exile norwegians under the guise of `` police training '' would be something the `` nazi lapdog '' would do . 
  http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/polistrupperna also funding and giving weapons to resitance groups . 
  that was actually a lot more pleasant than the danish i 'm used to . 
  i have no idea , let us know if you find something . 
  actually , us swedes can be the ones with the superiority complex sometimes , naming stockholm `` the capital of scandinavia '' is one example . 
  i think most of us nords can agree that you guys talk funny , though . 
  and it 's not too far away for going back home to visit family semi regularly . 
  personally i prefer balladen om fredrik \u00c5kare cecilia lind but trasiga skor is a good one . 
  serves them right for coming over here and stealing our moose signs . 
  been dead since 1987 but cornelis vreeswijk who is still considered a national treasure to music was dutch . 
  the guy above is not talking completely out of his ass but he probably would have at least gotten a couple years in prison if he 'd been over 18 when it happened , still enraging how lenient they were on him . 
  that did n't stop the police academy from doing it though . 
  we do the same thing with black pudding/blood sausage ( and also some bacon on the side ) but in swedish cuisine it 's far from unheard of to have r\u00e5r\u00f6rda lingon together with potatoes , like for example with raggmunkar ( potato pancakes ) and pork or the traditional way to eat meatballs which is with potatoes , cream gravy , pressgurka ( swedish style pickles ) and r\u00e5r\u00f6rda lingon . 
  and yes , i would be very surprised if our kroppkakor and palt did n't at least share a common ancestor with your cepelinai . 
   you would n't eat cepelinai with a jam . 
  r\u00e5r\u00f6rda lingon is n't quite like other jams ( i 'm not even sure if it actually is a jam ) . 
   wikipedia is saying you have grains/flour in your potato dough not necessarily and often in small amounts , palt on the other hand sometimes does n't even have any potato in it . 
  sounds like what we call ` kroppkaka ' which is minced/sliced pork inside a ball of potato dough that you boil and eat with lingonberry jam . 
  i 'd argue that they at least helped start it ( molotov-ribbentrop pact ), 
  would n't this fall under citizen 's arrest ? 
  what are the laws regarding that ? 
  here 's a bomb map as well : http://www.sydsvenskan.se/malmo/bombkarta-har-har-sprangladdningar-detonerat-i-malmo/, 
  i forgot about the boars , i even posted a boar related comment a few minutes after the reply to your comment and did n't think about it . 
  i wonder if british tourists go to germany and steal wild boar-road signs similarly to how german tourists go to sweden and steal moose-road signs . 
   bears , lynxes , wolverines and wolves . 
  you forgot to mention moose , those fuckers scare me more than any bear would . 
  ~ 50 % , not half bad for a non-speaker ( even if `` d'\u00e9l\u00e9cteurs '' and `` d'origine '' are fairly obvious ) . 
  i do n't speak french ( some spanish though ; and english and swedish of course ) , so based on what i know in the other languages and some guesswork : * something like * - `` stephen harper evaluates a request for canadian aid from a nepalese envoy . '' * ? 
  * * and * - `` how many voters of nepalese origin are there in canada '' * ?
