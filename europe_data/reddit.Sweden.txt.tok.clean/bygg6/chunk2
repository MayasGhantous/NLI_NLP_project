  well sweden is not known for a big name variety . . !, 
  swedish . 
  i like the sound of russian but i have bad associations with it . 
  and of course lithuanian . 
  the text says just `` cannabis protein '' and it 's literally dark green powder . 
  on the ingredients it says it 's 100 % pressed ( ? ), 
  hemp seeds . 
  the way i eat on workdays : ** typical breakfast ** : soygurt with a banana , muesli , corn flakes , cannabis protein powder , peanut butter and strawberry jam . 
  also coffee and chocolate/waffles/cookies after that ( relatively often instead of that ) . 
  ** lunch ** : 50:50 either oumphburger from a local swedish fast food chain with fries and coca cola zero or something i cooked at home from a vegan recipe book targeted at people who do n't like to cook but want to bring their own lunch to work . 
  after that more coffee with chocolate/waffles/cookies and a sugarfree redbull ** dinner ** : chocolate cereal with almond milk , 2 avocado toasts and the yogurt with stuff from breakfast if i did n't manage to eat it on breakfast . 
  my point is to have the gainz but failing to eat breakfast and dinner quite often is a hindrance . 
  i try to compensate for that on weekends , then i usually stay at my boyfriend who has a big kitchen so it 's easier to cook and i do n't need to do the dishes . 
  very common . 
  * not * having alcohol would be weird and people would get irritated . 
  sometimes there does n't even have to be any event , we have a small fridge with beer in our office ( which also saved us after the stockholm terrorist attack when we could n't go home after work for a while ) . 
  that still does n't justify their violence ... 
   parklers , paper umbrellas and convoluted drinking straws . 
  this should be not served for anyone of any gender actually . 
  it 's literally useless plastic trashing the environment . 
  toxic masculinity level in sweden is much lower than in the usa so getting shit for being a male and drinking sweet or nice looking drinks is not really common . 
  this year on sweden 's midsummer my boyfriend 's brother visited and brought a bottle of rose champagne to the table . 
  we all 3 also put strawberries in it while drinking just it did n't taste good . 
  on the other side , in general such drinks are not very common in sweden because they 're expensive . 
  the majority of everyone drinks beer of their preference when going out . 
  buying box wine is also popular as an alternative ( usually , both genders , drink it after the beer is over ) . 
  at work or other events where alcohol is served there are usually 3 things to choose from - beer , wine and alcohol free . 
  no one ever assumes that a woman would prefer wine , the most common assumption is that everyone prefers beer ( and that 's usually correct - the majority drinks beer , and a few men and women drink wine ) . 
  blatantly marketing a drink for one gender would probably make it to aftonbladet . 
   but then again , they are raised by their parents i 'd bet my little finger that at least 40 % of now-adults raised by soviet era parents either have untreated c-ptsd or think that they had deserved the corporal punishment : ^ ), 
  it was in svt news today too . 
  i got so angry and sad :(, 
   ** bus ** or car or ** train ** , just stops dead in its tracks . 
  we do n't even need to wait for winter to get that though . 
  at least once a week someone out of 6 people is late to work because of `` signalfel '' . 
  it 's not new at all . 
  * could * be in case of extremist left government and * certainly would * be in case of extremist right . 
  oh no , think about * the property * . 
  left wing extremism exists mostly as a response to the right wing extremism . 
  the rest of left wing is a set of good ideas aiming for everyone 's equality . 
  ca n't be said about the right wing . 
  please note also that the results of left wing extremism in the past gave us the paid holiday , 8-day workday and women 's suffrage , meanwhile right wing extremism gave birth to the holocaust . 
  one needs at least 3000 000 sek to get something . 
  not affordable if you did n't plan it since you were 11 years old . 
  fellow vegan spotted ? 
  same . 
  that 's because i live 3min away from one ica and work 3min away from another ica . 
  are you trying to say that nowadays nazis do n't exist ? 
  some of them even sit in the parliaments . 
  i do n't have a clear opinion about their methods but i generally support them . 
  to me the existence of antifa movement as a response to nazis is a bit like being pro-peace but having military anyway . 
  but redneck is a slur , eastern europe is a region . 
  i 'm born in lithuania and i do refer to it as eastern europe since in my eyes the baltics is a part of eastern europe . 
  the only occasion i call my motherland northern europe is when i refer to geography or weather . 
  i do n't know if you 're into that stuff , but maybe you 'd like to look into [ lithuanian mythology ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_mythology ) , i think it 's pretty cool ( i even have a couple of tattoos related to it :d ) . 
  there are very few lithuanian things that i prefer over swedish ones but the still widely existing * paganic * holiday traditions is one of them . 
  if you 're interested in food , maybe on these holidays you could look into making the meals associated to that holiday . 
  [ example ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/k%c5%ab%c4%8diukai ) . 
  the english sources are pretty poor and do n't explain the symbolism behind but i 'm almost sure they should exist somewhere outside wikipedia . 
  [ fyra nyanser av brunt ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/fyra_nyanser_av_brunt ), 
  patrol on the roads slowly and stop the people walking by the road :d, 
  yeah but really many do n't or do n't do it regularly . 
  i know several norwegian women who do . 
  no behaviour of the whole country , everyone is different . 
  but i personally think it 's a big turn-off . 
  visible underarm hair - biggest turnoff . 
  edit : i did n't notice that the question was not just about the chest hair . 
  my answer still stands except for leg hair - i know it 's super annoying to remove them , i very rarely do that myself so i try to not be hypocrite against men who barely do it . 
  many people do n't do anything with leg hair in sweden ( men and women ) from my experience . 
  the `` problem '' is still present , 
  same in lithuania . 
  i even saw a tv serie where police were hunting for people without reflectors and giving them for free . 
  i know that quality is good and price is now good too . 
  7-10 years ago my mom travelled from vilnius to minsk because it used to be expensive and kind of novelty in the baltics/lithuania , but not anymore . 
  i 'd say in general medical services in lithuania are good and i know that medical tourism is a thing . 
  might be related with the fact that there are much less people there so the doctors have time to give attention to everyone . 
  swedish mile is 10km . 
  agreed . 
  right side , under `` subscribe '' click `` show my flair on this subreddit . 
  it looks like ''  possibly you have to be subscribed to use a flag, 
  well i 'm not saying that poor and even homeless people do n't exist . 
  just they are not tied to any county . 
  but if you go to the big cities , i could certainly guide you to some districts where poorer people live , crime rate is higher , etc. 
  just it 's nothing extreme . 
  none . 
   proper water pressure in the shower ... is something i do n't have in my apartment, 
  yeah , he was totally trying to be funny . 
  but i thought that was really awkward , given that he met the other guy for the first time . 
  well from my experience american immigrants take too much mental space and act like they 're * something * . 
  yes , they do support the democrats ( including the guy i was referring to ; i 've never met a trumpet irl ) and act like it makes them very progressive and adds to * the somethingness * . 
  but that 's just my personal experience not representing anything else . 
  you ca n't just generalize entire countries into a stereotype popular in the usa . 
  by the way last friday i drank with an american immigrant ( moved 5 years ago ) and a guy with iranian parents ( do n't feel like calling him `` immigrant '' when he has spent almost all of his life here ) . 
  the second one was just a normal , cool person , not even religious , also homosexual . 
  the first one checked many / r/shitamericanssay boxes ( `` how do you say * cheers * in persian ? 
  - literal quote ) , also he still prefers to speak in english with people . 
  sooo if this now represents all americans , no thanks then . 
  i usually buy some sort of ecological l\u00f6fbergs coffee . 
  you totally can get it in germany . 
  i am an emigrant from lithuania , my mom and sister also emigrated ( to a different country ) and so did many other relatives .
