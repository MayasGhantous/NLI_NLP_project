  other than that no one really comments anything about the motherland . 
  yes , really common and growing . 
  veganism too , even the milk companies now make their adverts targeted at people who are concerned with animal rights ( and it is common to see the `` not your milk '' stickers put on them later ) . 
  yeah , but that 's why it 's called `` equality between genders '' . 
  sexism goes both ways , even though in overall it hurts women more . 
  it was women feminists who first raised the question about paternity leave too . 
   it 's not like that kind of things is revolutionary but it counts . 
  people , especially on the internet , like to complain about how unimportant it is and how people should fix `` actual problems '' but the truth is , that changing such little things is the easiest and there 's literally no reason to * not * do it . 
   but of course equality is ** not a one way road ** , so i also have to say that here is way more equal for the men in terms of paternity leave . 
  this is the same way . 
  not equality , and real equality does n't exist anywhere yet . 
  but the situation is much better in comparison with other places . 
  even sweden 's official website has a page about gender equality . 
  also according to a few years old statistics , over 70 % of swedish people identify themselves as feminist . 
  as a person coming from eastern europe , i notice a huuuuuge difference in my everyday life too . 
  never coming back . 
  kind of everywhere , at least if we talk stockholm . 
  quite many americans , australians . 
  probably the correct answer is sweden for me because that 's the only european country , other than my motherland , where i 've ever spent time not as a tourist , so theres no way to avoid all the 4 stages of culture shock . 
  i remember like 2 weeks after moving and doing all the typical immigrant stuff i was feeling pretty down for 2 days , i even kind of longed my hometown . 
  my cat got sick and at the same time i myself needed to go to emergency hospital , so not only i was tired of how big stockholm is but also all the differences between swedish and lithuanian healthcare systems and costs were crashing down on me . 
  edit : also the whole housing thing . 
  i knew how it is , i did n't expect it to be anything else than it was , but during these 2 days i was frustrated for it too . 
  especially after an actual adult stockholmare went to the apartment with me and said : `` well this is not the kind of place i 'd want you to live in , but ... '' :d felt like all my effort to ignore the fact that i 'll pay pay 3 times more for an old apartment that 's never been renovated , is 10kvm smaller , has no balcony and there 's no rent contract , went down the drain then, 
  actually same :d monmartre district , in particular . 
  me and my bestie of that time ( both 18 year olds then ) had generally good time in paris and expected narrow cozy streets and beautiful parks in monmartre . 
  instead it was dirty , reminded a bit of a ghetto , in one place it smelled rotten meat so bad that we just took another route . 
  also there we got scammed by bracelet makers ( or we actually did n't , just started running when we realized wtf ) . 
  you should add a note that this was made popular by a homophobic politician who shout this phrase while 2 policemen were carrying him out in a plastic wrap from the baltic pride event because he was causing a mess there . 
  even entering this phrase to google brings news articles and youtube video of the event . 
  so if this is lithuania 's battle call now ... 
  made me laugh irl . 
  you bet and you would lose . 
  i do n't even have a favourite actor . 
  this behavior is harassment because one invades a stranger 's private space with disguise of being `` nice '' so the stranger has it harder to back out without being `` not nice '' . 
  it 's also abusing the general situation where you know that the majority of people will react to you stopping them because of the helpful nature . 
  also ask yourself why would someone even want to randomly have a stranger 's number , they do n't even know anything about that person ? 
  and why it 's mostly man against women who feel it 's ok to do so . 
  talking to people we do n't know happens all the time everywhere and of course that 's ok . all the people who know each other did n't use to do so . 
  but bothering someone , without having a reason to do so , in a non-social environment is generally not acceptable here and i prefer it to be that way . 
  it 's 2017 , to just socialize without a reason there is internet , there are various meetups , etc. 
  oh i remember seeing this video some time ago . 
  do n't get it how can usa complain about middle east if this is a-ok for the males . 
  i 've been to some places in europe where this is normal too but not sweden or any other nordic country . 
  i did n't quite understand what the first one was saying , he was almost mumbling , then the other one suddenly appeared , gave me his hand and said his name is anders , then the conversation went like this : - ok but what do you want ? 
  - your phone number !, 
  - what ? 
  why ? 
  - you seem like a nice person and i want to know you !, 
  ( at this point i understood which direction is this going ) - uuuuuhhhh i have a boyfriend - it does n't matter , same as i said i have a homosexual friend ( ... ) - ok haha no sorry i do n't know you , have a good day - good luck !, 
  i should have said i 'm not nice and moved on but i 'm not used to such situations in normal environment and got really confused . 
  i was n't chased , it was 2 guys who were standing around and as i was walking by they went to me , said `` excuse me '' ( in swedish , not foreigners ) so i stopped because i thought they 'll ask me how to find the right train or something , which is normal . 
  i know that in usa it 's normal for boys to harass girls , even here on reddit when i used to browse default subs there were lots of advice in the spirit of `` talk to women on the street '' and tons of askreddit questions `` how to approach women on the street '' . 
  well this is invasive and uncomfortable socializing that is completely out of place . 
  if someone tells me `` excuse me '' and i 'm not in some critical situation , i 'll always stop and react because i 'll assume that the person needs help . 
  if it becomes the norm to harass strangers like in the usa , i , and probably other people too , will just ignore someone approaching to avoid them randomly socializing me . 
   costumes from various popular tv shows and movies yeah , when it 's like this it 's extremely lame , i agree, 
  usa imported halloween from europe though . 
  i was referring to lithuanian , the language i was `` born with '' . 
  i do n't know , maybe spanish is more balanced , but in lithuanian there are no neutral words , everything is either male or female , even `` a human '' is male . 
  yeah , swedish does n't have this shit . 
  the usage of random english words , especially if they 're american slang . 
  i do it myself though but i try to not use american-english . 
  inspired by another comment , how could i forget how much i dislike hollywood films and hollywood celebrities . 
  no , of course not all of these individually . 
  but i 'd prefer to see much less of them on tv and use that space for european , asian , alternative american cinema , etc. 
  more diversity !, 
  however i 'd take that any day over an american thing that happened to me on friday , when 2 guys came up to me ( a person walking fast with earbuds , in a central station ) and asked for my phone number because `` you seem like a nice person '' . 
  i still cringe remembering the whole situation . 
  next day , also near the central station , i saw a paper plane on the floor with swedish text `` hey stranger , i want to know you !, 
  i hope it was the same actors from the same campaign . 
  we should do everything to prevent this shit becoming a norm . 
  ah ok . well i 'm a mother of zero but i think it 's really dull that in my motherlanguage everything is gendered and male is `` the default '' and is supposed to represent everyone . 
  actually , kind of reflects the way society views women there . 
  relevant quote by some professor : `` feels a bit strange saying ` welcome back dear students ( m ) when i see 70 % girls in the class . 
  would n't it be more correct to say ` welcome back dear students ( f ) then ? ' '', 
  having additional word in text and official speech is not a big deal , nobody 's forced to talk like that in every day language . 
  on the other hand , i love swedish . 
  let me guess , you 're male ? 
  and supporting trump * is * embarrassing . 
  winters are not really cold in stockholm ( or not anymore ) . 
  this year there was basically no real winter . 
  now the spring/summer has come and i really like the smell of flowers everywhere but it 's so hot i 'm dying . 
  i 'd like to live deeper in the land , farther away from water for it to be perfect . 
  but in general i 'm not complaining . 
  moved from lithuania to sweden and not coming back for anything else than vacation . 
  whenever someone calls me an `` expat '' i correct them because i 'm a literal immigrant . 
  my mom was 23 , in 1992 . 
  this seems crazy to me . 
   it exists , so it is a problem . 
  i like this point of view . 
  i have no idea at all . 
  ** from swedish point of view ** , i can understand some norwegian from hearing ( can even speak some :d ) , can understand text . 
  some norwegian people in swedish facebook groups just write in norwegian and no one has problems with it . 
  can understand written danish but to a lower extent than norwegian , also some danish words that are same/similar as swedish actually have other meaning . 
  can understand some words from hearing , but not nearly enough to hold a conversation or something , also usually the person knows i 'm a swedish speaker so they speak slowly in danish . 
  can also read/listen to some g\u00f6tu danska , but it 's similar to norwegian and even google translate recognizes it as norwegian . 
  ** from lithuanian point of view ** : some latvian words make sense but i ca n't even read text , or maybe some very simple sentences . 
  latvian and lithuanian are much more farther apart than swedish and norwegian . 
  ** from russian point of view ** : my russian is really bad but i 've never learned any polish and i can sometimes make sense out of simple polish text sentences .
