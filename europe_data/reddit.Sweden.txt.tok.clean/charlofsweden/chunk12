   being an atheist was just a mean to an end , instilling communism was the ultimate objective . 
  part of the communist ideology , at least as interpreted by stalinism and maosim alike , is the abolishing of all religion . 
  opiate of the people and all that . 
  you might as well say : `` having a centrally planned economy was just a means to an end ; instilling communism was the ultimate objective . '', 
   because they followed the wrong religion and not the one true religion aka communism . 
  this raises the question of how you 're supposed to define a religion in the first place . 
  communism has no beliefs in any supernatural or divine power . 
  it believes in reason as interpreted from its own paradigm . 
  the soviet union and china both spend a lot of resources on scientific advancement and education of the populace ( look at how proud the soviets were about their exploits in space , and how they forced people to adapt admittedly mistaken but nonetheless perceived to be scientifically based agricultural practices , for example ) . 
  sure , there is an element of leader worship and most certainly a very strong concept of religion-like dogma in regards to ideological thought . 
  but is that enough to qualify it as a religion ? 
  does that not make most if not all political ideologies or parties `` religions '' ( even if their methods of enforcement are not always as violent as the communists were during the cold war ) ? 
  surely if you were to join almost any mainstream european political party no matter what end of the spectrum and then start questioning their ideas you 'd be kicked out at the spot for being in violation of party `` dogma '' ? 
  sometimes communists blur the lines , but ultimately it 's an ideology first and foremost . 
  it is not a religion . 
  hell , there 's nothing about communism except for its very strong opposition to organised religion that goes against anything that for example christianity or islam teaches . 
  rich men , heaven , camels , eye of needles , ring any bells ? 
  are you aware that islam prescribes mandatory charity , in concept not all that different from sharing the wealth ? 
  did you know about [ these ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christian_communism ) [ couple ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamic_socialism ) of [ ideologies ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christian_socialism ) , all based on merging left-wing political thought with religious fundamentalism ? 
  how would that even work , if communism is its own religion ( and thus implicitly non-compatibility with other religions ) ? 
  but in any case , why does it matter if they were atheist ( or their regimes were , if not they themselves ) ? 
  atheism is * not * a religion . 
  it makes no demands of its adherents to act or believe in any particular way or thing . 
  is n't that partly the point ? 
  i do n't see why you could n't be both a genocidal dictator and an atheist , when atheist * itself * ( as opposed to secular humanism or just plain old cultural doxa ) does n't prohibit you from cold-hearted oppression and mass killings . 
  atheism is a grouping of a huge number of diverse beliefs and people , not all of them are pleasant . 
  the only thing they have in common is that they do not follow any particular religion or hold beliefs about anything supernatural . 
  this ca n't be news to you . 
  tl ; dr : communism is not a religion , and marxism and maosim both had atheism-based ideas , but it does n't mean anything because atheism is not itself an ideology or religion . 
  two words , one name : joseph kony . 
  regardless of their own personal opinions on the matter both dictators led states that pursued policies of force state-mandated atheism ( or at the very least irreligiousness ) and both states oppressed and hunted down religious groups at various points . 
  as specofdust said it really does n't matter , as neither are particularly representative of atheists as a whole , especially today 's atheists . 
  but to deny that cold war communism and its leaders were vehemently anti-religious due to ideological reasons is plain wrong . 
  first the teddy bears , then ... the world !, 
  yeah , i really do n't care all that much about who he is as a person . 
  as a politician his stated goals and opinions are much more important to me , as well as the ones i can read between the lines . 
  whether he smokes or drinks is besides that matter . 
  his career and educational merits are only tangentially related imo . 
  it 's much more relevant to look at what he 's done during his time as a politician than what university he went to or what his job was before he got elected . 
  his marriage status is completely irrelevant to everything and i could n't care less if he has kids or not ( arguably having such a large and presumably time-demanding family life is only going to have negative effects on his performance as a politician , as they present a liability and a distraction from his work , anyway ) : what has he done as a politician ? 
  what are his end-goals for his country ? 
  what kind of ideological values does he have ? 
  but yeah , pretty much his whole praise of poland ( and he did * a lot * of it ) is complete and utter bullshit aimed at securing more votes . 
  i 'm not trying to say that he 's in any way stupid or anything . 
  clearly he is n't , or he would n't have been able to outmaneuver his fellow politicians in the party elite to get to this point . 
  my point is only that he 's being hypocritical when he praises poland for being a bastion of freedom and liberty but berates his political opposition as being evil socialist scum when they seek to introduce reforms that would make his own country more similar to poland in policies like healthcare and social security . 
  yeah , exactly my point . 
  it 's there , it 's had a marked effect and influence . 
  the article seems to be implying that we should all be living in fascist dictatorships by now because people should have abandoned all their belief in democracy because of the crisis , but what i 'm saying is that the extremism in question is about as popular as it could be even considering the circumstances and the economy . 
  ( as a side note you are wrong about the southern stereotypes being comparable to those that used to be raised against jews . 
  if anything the stereotypes that are emerging in regards to the southern europeans have a lot more in common with those that are * still * being thrown against the roma everyday : laziness , corruption , criminality and free-loading . 
  jewish stereotypes meanwhile historically were much more about craftiness , hidden intentions and secret evil practices . ),

  i 'm not sure that is the whole explanation here . 
  fascism had a unique set of circumstances that led to its rise that would n't be easily replicable today . 
  for one thing the availability of information amongst the general populace is much higher , as is the general education level . 
  these are factors that will make it hard for fascism to take its traditional route to control in the modern day , no matter how bad the economy is . 
  i guess i 'm saying i do n't really agree with the article 's idea that extremism `` should be '' more popular than it is . 
  even so they did n't get many seats at all , and like 7 % of the national vote or thereabouts iirc . 
  there was no danger that they 'd be in the majority or have any real power or say . 
  what the article is arguing is that this relative popularity of the golden dawn is significantly less than what you 'd expect given the circumstances . 
  he knows enough to know that it is n't the usa , and thus must be socialist and evil . 
  a strange thing for him to say about a country that has state-funded healthcare and such other things that romney himself has been vehemently opposing in the political debate in his homecountry as being socialist and fundamentally opposed to the tenets of freedom and liberty ... 
  would n't the lazy and irresponsible stereotype rather fit better with the ones associated with the roma rather than the jews ? 
  i think this is mostly an issue of branding more than anything . 
  if you think about it the eu is right up britain 's alley : it 's a political system that does n't make any sense , encourages corruption , is run by people who have no idea what 's going on or what they are doing , has such strange laws and rules that no one can keep track of what they are and then ten thousand specific exceptions for every single rule . 
  in other words : just like british politics . 
  the solution is quite evident i think : a simple [ rebranding ] ( http://imgur.com/wca1c ) and the brits will be the most enthusiastic of europeans . 
  make sure to post it from the vatican as well , so he gets it with a vatican postal system stamp . 
   that 's not what was claimed . 
  what was claimed was that there is ` anti-gay ' legislation in the us . 
  if that is is the claim then it 's true . 
  yes , that legislation may be on a state level but it does in fact exist . 
   that 's not ` anti-gay ' though . 
  it would be anti-gay if they actively took away gay peoples rights . 
  but gays are never and have never been able to marry according to that institution .
