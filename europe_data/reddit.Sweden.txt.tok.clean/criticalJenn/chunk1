typed up a reply to another comment but i reckon posting it standalone wo n't hurt - i think the * chance * exists for just about anyone , but it 's so slim that it is rarely worth considering for most . 
  also , there are a lot of logistics challenges involved in making sure all are comfortable and well at all times , particularly when living together with only one person - i reckon that last part would be easier for people who went with poly arrangements all along and ( plan to ) live in some form of collective/share a house with everyone involved , though . 
  i have n't seen it work so far , but there 's got to be some examples of people who overcame those challenges and live their life happier for it , but i do n't see it possible for myself due to how much focus and attention to detail i want from a partner for life . 
  for more temporary engagements though , i reckon that could be quite fun for whom it works and the chances match up for .

  same tbh , except both of us got married off to poor guys in the no-go zones and the government pays them for it . 
  i did n't even know it had a negative connotation to it after the days of the ussr , or perhaps outside of xenophobic circles ( which really use any adjective in derogatory manner first and foremost ) . 
  you 're making me sentimental in my old day -- twenties . 
  all the political shitfests of recent times actually make me appreciate what i did n't know i had for the longest time - and now i live abroad . 
  in sweden , thankfully , but abroad no less . 
  still gon na vote later this year , thank god for embassies . 
  let 's do our best to keep being decent , shall we . 
  was going to comment the same thing - if you already know you enjoy somebody 's company in a certain way , it seems very disingenuous to go out and get intimate with multiple people . 
  now hanging out with people , that 's a different thing so it really depends on what `` going on a date '' / `` dating '' really means . 
  in that sense i guess i 'd say yes we date , no we do n't date * around * , if that makes sense . 
  the only people i know that do this are also into casual sex/in open relationships , so that 's a bit of an exception to the norm . 
  i agree that there 's some prescription drugs that are really hard to come by - i keep checking any pharmacy i walk past for my hormone supplement patches , but nowhere 's got them and the delivery date is a mistery to absolutely everyone . 
  this has been going on for months and i 'm ordering in some from an online pharmacy abroad , despite paying easily 20 times as much for it as i otherwise would - shitty things happen when there 's only one manufacturer and they do n't seem to want to match the demand/people do n't plan ahead enough . 
  so essentially , i 've had to make do with less effective alternatives for months from time to time , and that 's really not how prescription drugs and healthcare should work . 
  roughly half a liter of black assam with some milk and sugar . 
  tall girls with pretty eyes and hair , that 's really all i can narrow it down to . 
  short people are cute too , but i like being the same height ( 170 ) or a bit shorter . 
  ( am german , girlfriend tall swede . ), 
  most kinds of chicken soup/stew , german steckr\u00fcbeneintopf and creamy mushroom soup with chives are all good with me . 
  efficient , i like it !, 
  well shit , that 's what i get for being from the northern bits i suppose . 
  east frisia is just a region within germany ( the most northwestern bit next to the netherlands ) - regarding countries , turkey does take it . 
  edit : http://www.afternoonteatotal.com/2014/08/east-frisia-tea-drinking-capital-of.html?m=1, 
  similar to the irish poster here , people assume the uk/england is the tea capital of the world , when actually east frisia in germany has the highest amount of tea drank per capita ( on phone right now , but there 's actual statistics for this ) . 
  our tea culture is absurd , and pretty creative in some parts . 
  also , more regionally mismatched , foreigners assuming the oktoberfest , lederhosen and weischw\u00fcrstl to be a thing across the entire country - particularly offensive as somebody from around bremen , may i add . 
  about . . 0.2 a day in my morning tea , i 'd say . 
  * it 's a pretty fucking big mug okay . 
  i barely ever use any - maybe if i 'm going to be wearing a more elaborate and themed outfit i 'll do some eye pencil but that 's about it . 
  girlfriend does it more often , but nothing beyond some basic eye stuff you can put on in five minutes . 
  i like touching her face , and powder and clay do n't feel * that * good on your fingers - she also has very even skin anyway , so it barely does anything . 
  for friends , it depends . 
  i 'd say most people i know do n't really use it , or just rarely so - one or two people yeah , but the vast majority , no . 
  as for strangers , i honestly ca n't say i ever paid any attention . 
  i think of it as like any other aspect of a nice getup - you wo n't be wearing a dress shirt that often , unless it 's part of your particular style . 
  i grew up in germany , so for me it was homeopathy and . . onion packs . . ?? 
  it 's very weird , but my mother has some form of near-religious hatred for any form of painkillers or prescription drugs - was n't particularly nice when i had a lot of ear infections as a kid . 
  then again she 's also nuts in just about any other way and seems to view people that need regular medication as subhuman , so she is n't exactly a representative of what regular people do or think . 
  that 's so affordable , gee - girlfriend and i live in a 50m \u00b2 place on the outer parts of stockholm and this place still cost about 150k to buy . 
  nowadays , a similar apartment was just sold for about 270k , so you can imagine how plans of moving are going . 
  they have their alt-right periods every few weeks , but for the most part it 's normal people aside from that . 
  a tall swedish girl , working as a sys admin - we 've lived together for the past two years now . 
  cultural differences between germany and sweden are n't too big , aside from people staring less and seeming a bit less publicly confrontational overall . 
  they do n't know how to make sausages here though , at all - 40-70 % meat percentage is approaching criminal behaviour and does n't qualify as a sausage to me . 
  they have less of a grilling/barbecue culture here though , temperatures being colder and all , so that 's something i miss from germany . 
  also , no bakeries around every corner . 
  well yeah , obviously real ramen - the other ones we call instant noodles :p, 
  whew . . probably ramen or wok noodle/chicken and duck dishes , honestly . 
  i do n't eat out nearly enough , and should really get a wok and learn how to make some of these myself - asian food has been criminally underrepresented in my life for a long time , considering how much i love some of it . 
  i grew up in niedersachsen , somewhere bordering both the ammerland and ostfriesland , so it might just be a regional or family specific oddity ( like how we have strawberry marmelade together with quark/curd on schwarzbrot ( again ) ) . 
  i do recommend you give it a try though , it 's very satisfying ( eat it warm , obviously ) . 
  i always loved leberk\u00e4se on schwarzbrot and with a slightly runny fried egg on top - one of the things i miss about germany . 
  smh , these younglings nowadays - so easily indoctrinated into believing in fictional places and ideas : ^ ), 
  1 . skinny jeans , slim fit top , short hoodie ( colour generally contrasting with top ) / slim thin leather jacket , mid-calf buckle boots with block heel/wedge sandals during summer 2 . pasta dishes of many varieties , but generally with fried vegetables and some form of cream sauce - gratins , also ( very good use for leftovers ) . 
  standalone beverage : black tea with honey and milk | with meals : water/light juices ( clear apple , dark grape ) | alcohol : baileys on ice , maybe stacked with kahlua 3 . friends getting upset about video games when they could just / mute all 4 . impatient - half our friend circle tends to run late for just about anything , and i just wish they 'd at least send a text when they know they 'll take another 15 to 30 minutes 5 . 
  i do n't think there 's many things i say without meaning , except maybe when ragging on friends so that 'll probably be it - basically hyperbolic statements about them being late/forgetting something for comedic effect 6 . forget i just boiled water when making aforementioned te -- * fuck *, 
  when growing up , my cousins would refer to stealing something , particularly bikes , as `` poleing '' it - not sure if that 's really a big thing though , but it 's the old `` they come across the border and steal all the bikes '' kinda clich\u00e9 . 
  girlfriend and i cook every day , and we always try to change up what we make - low effort or half-assed food makes me very sad since i grew up with a neglectful single parent , so i would never want to live a life where i do n't try my best to get something on the table my partner can enjoy and have a positive impact on her day from . 
  well made homemade food is one of the most important things to me in a relationship and when living together ( honestly , it 'd also be important if i was living with a friend , but maybe not ** as ** vital ) , together with taking time for one another and being emotionally open at all times . 
  i think the best reference i can give for the food and care thing is that , if any of you played ( or watched somebody play ) heavy rain , the scene near the start of the game with the microwave pizza really made me feel this in the most distinct way - it 's a feeling i remember way too well , and i never want to have any of it again , honestly . 
  that 's what i get for typing this at past 1 at night . . 
  . . that is just sad is what that is , gee . . 
  i do n't see why not , as long as we share enough common ground and agree that social welfare and basic rights associated with it is something desirable that deserves protecting - that 's really what it 's all about to me , the freedom of the people to live a decent life with a social safety net and without the fear of losing it all . 
  healthcare , social security/safety features , freedom to travel , equal rights for all and free education are probably the biggest points to what makes a place european to me , so as long as those are met/being honestly worked towards , why not . 
  if they were fleeing from the cold and soggy weather , i could see why they 'd go to spain : ^ ), 
  living with my girlfriend in stockholm , we do n't own a car - the subway system spans all parts of town , ( usually ) arrives on time and is safe and reliable , so there really is very little point . 
  a monthly traffic pass ( bus , subway , commuter train ) costs about the equivalent of $ 85 . 
  a single ride ( 75 minutes of access to all public transport in the city ) is $ 3 . 
  it 's a lot easier here in sweden ( stockholm in particular , we 've got a dedicated clinic of people that have been doing this for a while ) so i basically got everything sorted within a few months after getting my personal number . 
  yeah the legal and medical transition gatekeeping is beyond ridiculous honestly - large part of the problem is that there 's so few experts , and the evaluation period gets reset quite easily , i.e. 
  when being turned down by one doctor and having to go find another . 
  i remember i was n't accepted for appointments in either hamburg or m\u00fcnster due to living too far away , and the best we had locally was a psychiatrist who had . . ** very ** antiquated values , and turned me down because i had an abusive and transphobic mother ( `` it 's against your family 's interest and might make your life harder '' ) . 
  l and t here , i have n't experienced anything bad related to any of it here in sweden , aside from two incidents of drunk guys being asses , but none of that ever went physical , or beyond a brief encounter . 
  i remember down in germany , it was a bit different - more of an eerie aura about it . 
  people definitely glare more in germany than they do here ( cue old lady staring disgruntled in public train meme ) . 
  keep in mind though that the city i grew up in is basically 20 + years in the past . 
  the most lgbt thing we had is a sauna for gay guys , and that 's , uh . . well , not exactly my peer group . 
  who does n't , really . 
  british people do n't have the gutteral-throaty as and rs that i found americans to have ( on average and purely anecdotal , of course ) . 
  generally , british natives do n't do the whole `` ayy '' but instead say `` ah '' , which is more in line with germanic languages , so i reckon that 's a large reason why they do n't stick out as much in public consciousness . 
  similarly , the american `` arrr '' is more exaggerated and throaty , whereas the german `` rrr '' is more raspy and dry ( the swedish `` r '' , however , sounds kind of like an automatic rifle in how it 's rolled - i ca n't do that one ) . 
  with german , you can usually tell because of the as and rs , since they 're often more exaggerated by americans - it 's a more . . 
  ) , throat bubble-y sound , if that makes any sense . 
  native german , at least where i 'm from , is quite dry or `` flat '' sounding . 
  another tell is how people go about their gs and ts and ks - if they 're too abrupt and hinder the flow of speaking , they 're generally either foreigners , german majors , or from hannover . 
  not sure about sweden , but in germany that 'd be `` hartzer '' , named after the hartz welfare reform ( which arguably was for the worse for many , or so goes the sentiment ) . 
  200 sek a month for 100/100mbps - it 's pretty cool , coming from germany where i paid 40 $ for 25/5 . 
  greek people seem cool overall - maybe a little too forward sometimes , but that makes being social easier at times . 
  definitely better than people from where all you do is stare disapprovingly . 
  * ( german public transport ) *, 
  for germany . . schwarzw\u00e4lder kirschtorte ( black forest cherry cake ) . 
  for sweden . . nah , most things are either obscenely sweet , or liquorice .
