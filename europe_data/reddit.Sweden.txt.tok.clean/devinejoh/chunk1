i think it 's a bit of both to be honest, 
  the mongol conquests were genocidal in nature , but they brought with them institutions that otherwise did n't exist . 
  similar to what happened in africa during the 1800s and the americas . 
  my point is its easy to justify such action if you are on the side that colonized , so naturally one should feel the same when it happens to them , at least when beliefs are consistent . 
  would you contextualize the mongol conquests as civilizing as well ? 
  the same language was used to justify the colonization of africa , and that turned out just great . 
  you ca n't just throw out random words and expect things to make sense . 
  it was a little cheek , that 's all, 
   the marine corps has been a component of the u.s. department of the navy since 1834 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_marine_corps, 
  now compare that to the us marines , a subset of the navy . 
  i 'm so confused , you are saying that centralization of fiscal policy is german propaganda , and then go onto say that the ` dollar zone ' ( presumably the us ) does not have a fiscal union , which is not the case . 
  what exactly are you arguing ? 
  centralized does not mean ` german ' though . 
  the united states does have federal taxes and budget though ... 
  it 's funny , because these exact issues were brought up before the euro came into effect . 
  mostly that the euro could not survive if there was only a monetary union and no fiscal union, 
  i do n't see it like that . 
  what it comes down to is that you can only control your own actions and protect yourself , you ca n't trust others to have your best interest in mind . 
  so you have to take precautions . 
  is it fair ? 
  absolutely not . 
  but that 's the way it is . 
  what turkey does in greece is no excuse for what russia did , classic whataboutism, 
  i do n't see how turkey flying over greece has anything to do with what russia did . 
  it is hypocritical but that does n't excuse russia, 
  it goes on to say that religious classes are offered , but pupils are under no obligation to take these courses, 
  no it 's fairly arbitrary , equally violent books exist , but i doubt that you would ban them . 
  i 'm not the one making arbitrary judgement on what we should allow our children to read or not . 
  i 'm taking your argument to the logical extreme , and trying to figure out what the hell your assumptions are . 
  what dictates the criteria in which a book is deemed violent and unsuitable for children ? 
  at what age should be allowing them to read this if that is the case ? 
  fairly arbitrary and lacking any substance . 
   however , the ** state subsidizes private teaching establishments ** , including religious ones , under strict conditions of not forcing religion courses on students and not discriminating against students according to religion . 
   pupils must be `` protected from all forms of religious proselytising '' that would impede their free choice ; teachers must not reveal their religious or political convictions when going about their work ; teachers and pupils alike had a duty not simply to respect the ideal of secularism but to promote it actively . 
  religious schools that are secular all but in name , maybe you should go to one , improve your reading comprehension . 
  they do sound violent . 
  maybe we should also ban textbooks that mention ww1 and the holocaust ? 
  would n't want those children seeing those awful pictures or hearing those horrid stories . 
  maybe we should restrict books as well , like heart of darkness or catcher in the rye , provide a state sanctioned copy perhaps ? 
   he example you were using was france , and i am pointing out to you that you are ** categorically incorrect ** in your assessment of the french school system . 
  you are the one that brought up `` muslim '' schools in france , and i 'm just pointing out that you are incorrect . 
   if they would n't be allowed for children outside a religious context , they should n't be allowed for children . 
  that simple . 
  so we should also ban children from reading christian , jewish , buddhist etc texts as well ? 
  i guess we should also start banning other books , could really be to violent for the children . 
  the example you were using was france , and i am pointing out to you that you are categorically incorrect in your assessment of the french school system . 
  you are the one that brought up `` muslim '' schools in france , and i 'm just pointing out that you are incorrect . 
   but more importantly . 
  it does n't matter . 
  i really do n't care what your particular concept of separation of church and state is and whether we comply to it . 
  i really do n't . 
  so why do you keep commenting ? 
   i already told you what i expect from a secular state . 
  right , one where muslim religious texts are ` approved ' by the state , ridiculous . 
  to receive funding from the french government , schools must be secular , so you are categorically incorrect . 
  so in fact there is already regulation in place to insure that there is separation of church and state and secularism , so at this point all you are doing is fear mongering . 
  also really fucking bigoted , i guess muslims are the only ones that need regulation . 
    you have muslim schools receiving state aid in france . 
  and you can tax religious entities . 
  there 's plenty we could point out to be contrary to our favourite definition of separation of church and state . 
   in france , the state recognizes no religion and does not fund religious education . 
  however , the state subsidizes private teaching establishments , including religious ones , under strict conditions of not forcing religion courses on students and not discriminating against students according to religion . 
  an exception is the area of alsace-moselle where , for historical reasons ( it was ruled by germany when this system was instituted in the rest of france ) under a specific local law , the state supports public education in some religions ( catholic , protestant , jewish ) mostly in accord with the german model . 
   state approved children islamic manuals . 
  veto who can and ca n't be a religious teacher by making them go through state certification . 
  that is literally the exact opposite of separation of church and state, 
  \\  wants to protect ` european ' values \\  does n't believe in the separation of church and state, 
  probably do n't want thousand of people in the street right now, 
  i cant tell if you are joking or not ... 
  haha holy shit dude , enjoy your delusions of russian grandeur . 
  i 'll make sure to send a care package with vodka and cigarettes after the sanctions take its toll . 
  little green men in crimea were clearly not russian paras , just crimean freedom fighters with latest russian weapons . 
  total coincidence shooting down civilian airliner , total accident , fault of nazi jew homosex kiev junta . 
  must save oppressed minorities by bombings the shit out of them . 
  you 're right , freedom fighters were eastern ukrainian farmers who dug up their cold war issued t72bu 's and btr90s in the back yard . 
  they chopped feet off as well . 
  except you know , the fucking holocaust . 
  i 'm not saying that there is n't , just do n't take the moral high ground . 
  as far as a lot of the world is concerned , yeah man . 
  a lot of european countries have a really bad reputation . 
  unless you are talking about the rwandan genocide , and i can assure you nearly everyone who studies thr subject puts the root cause at the feet of the belgians . 
  i 'm sure the croats , serbs and the bosnians love to hear that . 
  not to mention all the shit that is going down in africa and the middle east because of european meddling . 
  * ignoring all the genocides and ethnic cleansing committed by europeans since the beginning of time *, 
  do they have to adopt the same skin colour as well ? 
  i think you 'll find something else to complain about even if they did meet your ` standard ' of austrian . 
  except when it comes to muslims and stating sweden is the rape capital of the world ( buddy claimed it 's because of the immigrants ) . 
  oh , he also defended a guy on / r/canadapolitics that said what anders breivik did was ok . 
  he 's one of them alt right douchebags that thinks sweden/europe is turning into some kind of sharia hell hole , he does n't know shit . 
  if anyone were to know absolutely nothing about european security ( or anything about europe for that matter ) it would be you . 
  no evidence of rape . 
  dude is proclaimed innocent . 
  however there is no evidence that the person lied . 
  that is the system working . 
  so the system worked ? 
  uh depriving people of basic liberties is punishment , by like definition . 
  nope https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/habeas_corpus https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/arbitrary_arrest_and_detention, 
    every single ~ ~ refugee ~ ~ immigrant should be held until their application is processed . 
   ftfy so ` holding ' means what , exactly ? 
  in the english language and in the context it generally means to lock someone up .
