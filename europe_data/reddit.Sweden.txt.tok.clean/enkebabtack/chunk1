you do realize that stop fake is a ukrainian project ?

  yes , now compare this with the nato article 5 which stipulates that an attack on one state is regarded as an attack on all the member states . 
  here the only obligation is a response . 
  finland could literally decide to implement some sanctions and give aid and that would be it . 
  you have to realise that this is largely a political article . 
  it is incredible weak and undeveloped compared with the implementation mechanisms of nato . 
  read a bit more about the issues with article 42 ( 7 ) teu ( if you are interested ) , niklas helwig and tuomas iso-markku are two well known finnish experts on international affairs . 
  treaty on european union article 42 ( 7 ) http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?uri=celex:12008m042, 
  the eu defence clause is a complete joke . 
  it is by far too ambitious and does not posses any framework as to how the assistance will be carried out . 
  are we talking about military intervention to defend another eu member or simply sanctions against the aggressor ? 
  neither of these is outlined by article 42 ( 7 ) teu . 
  nice find , thanks for sharing !, 
  ** fears grow as ukraine rightwing militia puts kiev in its sights ** [ article via google ] ( https://www.google.se/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ccgqfjacahukewiut_vfxyrhahvjeiwkhts2ale&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.ft.com%2fcms%2fs%2f0%2f7925dacc-369c-11e5-bdbb-35e55cbae175.html&amp;ei=isc-ve7omcmksag77iiibq&amp;usg=afqjcnfi1vprk7ezex6_7nbva-kallx7cq&amp;sig2=rhcqpcbpm6uofxnspilzwq&amp;bvm=bv.99261572,d.bgg ) roman olearchyk august 2 , 2015 12:00 pm at a thickly forested former youth camp west of donetsk in war-torn eastern ukraine , a military instructor is busy teaching hundreds of new recruits how to fire everything from machine guns to rocket-propelled grenades . 
  the new boys are lean and fit , anti-separatist and -- in the instructor 's words -- have `` fire in their eyes '' . 
  but this is not ukraine 's regular army . 
  the troops are members of right sector , the far-right group that evolved from among the most militant wing of the protesters who toppled viktor yanukovich , the country 's pro-russian president , in its pro-democracy revolution last year . 
  the group is one of dozens of `` volunteer '' battalions that played a key role in halting advances by pro-russian rebels a year ago , after the revolution ushered in a pro-eu leadership , when the long-neglected regular army was caught flat-footed . 
  but fears are growing that right sector -- the only major volunteer battalion kiev has not yet managed to bring under regular army control -- could turn its fire on the new government itself . 
  dmytro yarosh , right sector 's leader , called late last month for a nationwide no-confidence referendum in president petro poroshenko . 
  he was addressing a rally in kiev of up to 5,000 right sector activists , angry over what they say is the government 's slow progress in fighting corruption and excessive concessions to moscow as it attempts to reach a settlement over eastern ukraine . 
  `` we are an organised revolutionary force that is opening the new phase of the ukrainian revolution , '' mr yarosh told the rally . 
  and earlier last month , two people were left dead in a shootout between off-duty right sector fighters and police near ukraine 's previously peaceful western border -- 1,500 km away from the eastern conflict . 
  the group claimed it was acting to destroy an illicit cross-border cigarette trade . 
  some observers have suggested right sector was actually trying to take it over . 
  russian officials and media have long demonised right sector as neo-nazis who , they claim , were the real driving force behind ukraine 's revolution . 
  moscow media 's obsession led some ukrainian officials to suggest privately that right sector might have been penetrated by russian intelligence as a subversive `` project '' aimed at undermining the government . 
  now some ukrainians who previously dismissed the threat posed by right sector are growing nervous . 
  `` [ right sector ] have been mainly a problem for ukraine 's image in the west , but now there is added concern because they have turned against the government , '' said andreas umland , a german academic based in kiev who studies the far right . 
  `` but they do n't yet have the political support or firepower to topple the government , and they know this . '' popular support for the group remains low , although a poll found it had risen from 1.8 per cent last october to 5.4 per cent by july . 
  yet as mr umland notes , the bravery shown in the east ukraine conflict by the right sector battalion has earned it the esteem of many regular soldiers -- posing a dilemma for kiev . 
  though the group agreed to pull back from the front lines weeks ago to comply with requirements of february 's minsk ceasefire accord that `` illegal fighting forces '' be withdrawn , its red and black flag still flutters over many locations now manned only by regular troops . 
  `` personally i respect right sector . 
  they are a strong , patriotic fighting force , '' said a ukrainian deputy battalion commander nicknamed leon , stationed north of donetsk . 
  `` there is no right sector here now but there are lots of boys here who support right sector . '' but although right sector fighters are respected by regular ukrainian troops for their battle bravery , they are despised by separatists , who allegedly execute them upon capture rather than taking them hostage for prisoner swaps . 
  as well as attracting scores of new recruits , right sector -- unlike much of ukraine 's regular army -- appears well equipped . 
  an armoured infantry assault tank captured in combat guards the entrance to the right sector base in the village of velykomykhailivka . 
  inside , the group 's other vehicles , including armour-plated pickup trucks , stand idle as the boom of grenades roars from a training ground hidden in nearby woods . 
  right sector fighters regularly drive outside the base in camouflaged jeeps , passing freely through security checkpoints despite having their own -- illegal -- licence plates identifying them as right sector . 
  `` we could send up to 10,000 fighters to the frontline , '' said artem skoropadsky , a spokesperson for right sector . 
  garik , another spokesperson , said some of their weapons were `` donations '' or were traded for other equipment with regular ukrainian troops in the heat of battle ; others were captured from the enemy . 
  though the group 's fighters admit they constitute an illegal armed force , they blame ukraine 's parliament for dragging its feet in legislating to legalise them as a single elite unit under ukrainian army command . 
  `` we earned our status from the people already , but now we need legal status as a fighting force , '' says frantsuz , or `` frenchman '' -- an instructor who earned his nickname after fighting with the french foreign legion . 
  `` those in government are criminals if they do n't give us status . '' he denies the group are fascists . 
  `` having lived in [ western ] europe , i realise that they often confuse nazism with nationalism , which for us ukrainians is more akin to patriotism , '' he says . 
  `` it 's not about considering your own ethnic group as superior , but being proud of it , and of defending your country . '' right sector is now trying to gather enough signatures from voters to force the referendum , although it is not clear if it will succeed . 
  `` it may come to a military coup , '' said one right sector fighter -- although many in the group say they would not go that far . 
  he admitted , however , that public support for such a scenario was low . 
  `` that 's why we have n't done it yet . '', 
  ** july 30 , 2015 2:28 pm ** ** imf can not join greek rescue , board told ** ** peter spiegel in brussels ** the international monetary fund 's board has been told athens ' high debt levels and poor record of implementing reforms disqualify greece from a third imf bailout of the country , raising new questions over whether the institution will join the eu 's latest financial rescue . 
  the determination , presented by imf staff at a two-hour board meeting on wednesday , means that while imf staff will participate in bailout negotiations currently under way in athens , the fund will not decide whether to agree a new programme for months -- potentially into next year . 
  that delay could have significant repercussions , particularly in germany , where officials have long said it would be impossible to win bundestag approval for the new $ 86bn bailout without the imf on board . 
  according to a four-page `` strictly confidential '' summary of wednesday 's board meeting obtained by the financial times , imf negotiators will `` participate in policy discussions '' to ensure the eurozone 's new bailout `` is consistent with what the fund has in mind '' . 
  but they `` can not reach staff level agreement at this stage '' . 
  the fund will only decide whether to participate during a `` stage two '' after greece has `` agreed on a comprehensive set of reforms '' and , crucially , after eurozone bailout lenders have `` agreed on debt relief '' . 
  that condition could prove a sticking point since berlin and other creditor governments have so far strongly resisted any suggestion of forgiving greece 's debts . 
  according to the summary , germany 's representative to the imf board said berlin `` would have preferred the fund . 
  move in parallel '' with the eurozone bailout talks . 
  instead , it now faces the prospect of trying to move an $ 86bn bailout through a sceptical bundestag in a matter of weeks without the imf 's imprimatur . 
  the imf 's assessment adds another source of complexity just as athens and its bailout monitors begin discussions in earnest in an attempt to conclude a deal before a tight august 20 deadline . 
  while the creditors ' harbour misgivings , alexis tsipras , greece 's prime minister , is also facing a mutiny from leftwing members of his syriza party unhappy with the conditions attached to the bailout . 
  the imf decided last week that its existing bailout programme , which was originally to run until march , needed to be scrapped because it could no longer achieve its stated goal of helping greece recover to the point where it could return to private debt markets . 
  the imf then forced athens to request a new imf programme , which requires board approval , necessitating wednesday 's meeting . 
  some greek officials suspect the imf and wolfgang sch\u00e4uble , the hardline german finance minister , are determined to scupper a greek rescue despite this month 's agreement to move forward with a third bailout . 
  in a once-private teleconference made public this week , yanis varoufakis , the former finance minister , said he feared the greek government would pass new rounds of economic reforms only for the imf to pull the plug on the programme later this year . 
  `` according to its own rules , the imf can not participate in any new bailout . 
  i mean , they 've already violated their rules twice to do so , but i do n't think they will do it a third time , '' mr varoufakis said . 
  `` dr sch\u00e4uble and the imf have a common interest : they do n't want this deal to go ahead . '' senior eu officials have insisted christine lagarde , the imf managing director , signalled her willingness to participate in a new bailout at the high-stakes summit that agreed the new rescue earlier this month . 
  but greece has become a growing source of rancour within the fund and among its shareholders . 
  people who have spoken with senior imf officials said ms lagarde is facing a unified staff view that the fund 's reputation is on the line and that it can not agree to a new programme without significant changes . 
  according to the board minutes , several non-european board members -- including from asia , brazil and canada -- warned about the need to `` protect the reputation of the fund '' , and the document says ms lagarde acknowledged their concerns . 
  `` [ ms lagarde ] stressed that in their engagement they have to be mindful about the reputation of the fund , '' the summary says . 
  according to the summary , imf staff concluded greece no longer clears two of the four requirements in the imf 's `` exceptional access criteria '' -- the fund framework that allows it to grant bailouts of larger-than-normal size . 
  under the criteria , a bailout recipient must be able to prove it has the `` institutional and political capacity '' to implement economic reforms , and that `` there is a high probability that the member 's public debt is sustainable in the medium term '' . 
  imf staff determined that neither criterion has been met -- and they would not know whether athens would meet those benchmarks until the autumn . 
  `` greece wants to decide on some important reforms only in the fall and the europeans only want to deal with the debt issue after the first review because they first want to rebuild trust , '' the summary states . 
  `` the differences between the imf 's thinking about the debt issue and what the europeans are currently discussing are very large . '' at the early stages of the greek crisis , the imf waved the debt criteria because of rules allowing it to grant a bailout if there was `` a high risk of international systemic spillover '' . 
  but imf staff told the board this risk no longer existed because a greek default would no longer hurt private bondholders , who now own a very small share of greek debt . 
  `` in 2010 , the systemic waiver was applied as a restructuring of the debt in hands of the private creditors was needed to restore debt sustainability , which could have caused major contagion , '' the minutes state . 
  `` currently , a restructuring of official debt is required and staff could think only of a few instances in which public debt restructuring could create contagion . '', 
  hardly surprising , by accepting this resolution , russia would be forced to accept the legal liability once it is fully established that it was pro russian separatists . 
  something which is unprecedented , as neither the united states nor ukraine did accept legal liability for the downing of iran air flight 655 and siberia airlines flight 1812 respectively . 
  is glenn ok ? 
   europe is easily strong enough to curtail any ambitions it might have europe could n't even manage the disintegration of yugoslavia and you expect them to be able to stop an act of aggression by russia ? 
  rather optimistic m8 , 
  that was actually said by the swedish navy intelligence . 
  because it is rather ignorant to suggest that most of the russian military hardware is rubbish ( in many areas they exceed the capabilities of their western counterparts fyi ) . 
  marianomonamour is just another speculative armchair general . 
  because the imf considers your debt sustainable and hence there is no reason to consider pushing back the payment schedule . 
  i mean why would romania want a extension of maturities and/or rescheduling of debt payments given that it is fully able to service its current debt . 
  absolute nonsense , greece was on the path towards recovery before syriza unilaterally decided to cancel and revert several of the agreed upon reforms . 
  why do you think the data you have included in only includes the range up to 2014 ? 
  greece was making great progress , albeit in some areas the progress of reform was particularly slow . 
  why do you think debt-restructing is on the table now ? 
  it is because the previous governments did not act quickly enough of the reforms agreed upon and the current government is stuck in a utopian mindset with infinite assets , you have to cut expenditure when your economy is in a recession . 
  from the [ imf debt sustainability analysis ] ( http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2015/cr15186.pdf ) leaked yesterday  greece 's public debt has become highly unsustainable . 
  ** this is due to the easing of policies during the last year ** , with the recent deterioration in the domestic macroeconomic and financial environment because of the closure of the banking system adding significantly to the adverse dynamics .
