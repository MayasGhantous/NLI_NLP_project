  this does n't entirely answer your question but officials in brussels are exploring options for collateral and methods to ensure that the eu budget is not at risk with this the proposal to use the efsm fund . 
  the united kingdom for instance , is willing `` to be constructive '' if a guarantee for the non-eurozone loans ( 28 % ) is found . 
  ** edit : ** looks like the united kingdom will push for the $ 1.9 bn of profits the european central bank has made on greek bonds to be set aside in an account that could be used to compensate non-euro member countries for any losses , according to the guardian .

  last updated : july 15 , 2015 10:24 am ** brussels proposes using eu rescue fund to help greece ** peter spiegel and alex barker in brussels and elizabeth rigby in london the european commission has submitted a formal proposal to use an eu-wide rescue fund to rush aid to greece to ensure athens does not default on monday , a proposal that will force britain 's prime minister , david cameron , to rally allies if he wants to block it . 
  according to an eu official , the commission submitted the plan late on tuesday after determining it was the best option to avoid greece defaulting on a $ 3.5 bn bond athens owes the european central bank . 
  if athens were to default on that bond , the ecb would be forced to pull emergency loans keeping the greek banking sector afloat . 
  `` it 's the most european , politically and economically sound , readily available option , '' said the eu official . 
  `` without it , there is a risk the euro summit [ agreement ] wo n't work . '' the commission 's decision comes despite angry objections to the plan by george osborne , the uk chancellor , who at a meeting of eu finance ministers in brussels on tuesday called the plan `` a non-starter '' . 
  downing street is furious that the commission is risking inflaming british public opinion ahead of the uk 's referendum on eu membership , which will be held by 2017 . 
  under the eu 's byzantine voting rules , mr osborne must now rally a weighted majority of fellow eu members to block the proposal . 
  although he has the support of some other non-euro countries -- both denmark and sweden registered their objections at tuesday 's meeting -- it is unlikely that at present downing street has sufficient allies to block the plan . 
  even the formal attempt by brussels to use this fund is a big political setback . 
  mr cameron has trumpeted securing a `` black and white '' promise in 2011 that the fund would be mothballed so british taxpayers would not be part of eurozone bailouts . 
  the eu-wide fund , the european financial stability mechanism , was set up at the outset of the eurozone crisis with $ 60bn in lending capacity . 
  when the eurozone moved to set up a new , permanent rescue fund for the currency union 's 19 members , mr cameron won agreement at an eu summit that the efsm would never be used again for eurozone rescues . 
  but eu lawyers have argued that the 2012 deal was a political agreement , not a legal one , allowing them to re-tap the fund . 
  this commission approach potentially undercuts one of the legal avenues british officials are exploring to enshrine reforms to britain 's eu membership terms . 
  given formal treaty changes are unlikely before the referendum , britain may need to rely on a decision by eu leaders , exactly the type of political promise the commission are disregarding in the case of the efsm . 
  a government figure said on wednesday that the uk remained firmly opposed and that the chancellor was `` immovable '' on principle that british taxpayers ' money would not be used to bail out greece . 
  `` we are not trying to be obstructive but it us a eurozone issue . '' one official involved in negotiating the efsm decision in 2011 said the commission 's proposal demonstrated that joint declarations by eu leaders `` are worthless '' until the laws and treaties are changed . 
  the efsm distributed $ 48.5 bn as part of ireland 's and portugal 's rescue , meaning it has about $ 11.5 bn remaining . 
  greece needs $ 7bn by monday to make the ecb bond payment plus interest , and reimburse the international monetary fund for $ 2bn in arrears . 
  broder !, 
  i 'm glad to see even more countries with their own currency resisting this . 
  yes , sweden and denmark are also opposed to the idea , but the uk is set to have a referendum about their eu membership and i ca n't imagine the british taxpayers being happy that $ 1bn of funds which , against the 2010 agreement is set to be used for a bailout . 
  seems like the european union is risking a british exit from the european union to prevent a greek exit ...

  ** us urges debt relief for greece ** barney jopson and shawn donnan in washington us treasury secretary jack lew has raised the pressure on european leaders to grant some debt relief to greece to help avoid its exit from the eurozone and what washington sees as an unnecessary hit to the global economy . 
  warning that a greek meltdown would cause hundreds of billions of dollars of economic damage , jack lew issued the obama administration 's loudest call yet for compromise on wednesday . 
  athens needed to play its part by giving the rest of europe confidence that it would fulfil a new set of reform pledges , he said . 
  but he also called on the country 's european creditors to be ready to restructure greece 's $ 317bn debt pile . 
  `` in the next few days what we 'll see is [ whether ] the parties come together and build enough trust that greece will take the actions that it needs to take so that europe will restructure the debt in a way that is more sustainable , '' mr lew said . 
  `` i certainly have ideas about how you can do that , '' he added . 
  `` but it 's . 
  a lot to do in a short period of time and i 've said over and over again that the risk of an accident goes up dramatically when you create more of these kind of life and death deadlines . '' us officials have in recent weeks gradually been raising the pressure on both greece and creditors such as germany and france to come to a deal and steer around what people in washington see as an avoidable crisis . 
  president barack obama spoke with both angela merkel , the german chancellor , and alexis tsipras , the greek prime minister , on tuesday . 
  mr lew and other officials have also been in regular contact in recent days with their counterparts across europe and at the international monetary fund . 
  the us has become an important advocate for granting greece debt relief . 
  washington backed an imf decision last week to release a controversial debt sustainability analysis that argued forcefully for a restructuring . 
  mr lew said the greek crisis did not pose `` any immediate threat '' to the us economy . 
  but , speaking at a brookings institution event in washington , mr lew lamented that greek and european leaders had previously been within `` a couple of billion dollars '' of reaching a deal but were now creating economic risks on a far larger scale in europe and beyond . 
  `` for any of us who have participated in budget and fiscal policy discussions , you would n't usually buy hundreds of billions [ of dollars ] of risk for a couple of billion dollar gap , '' mr lew said . 
  `` there 's a lot of unknowns if this goes to a place that completely melts down in greece . 
  i think that is a risk that the europeans and global economy do n't need . 
  i think geopolitically it would be a mistake . '' mr lew said the greek prime minister could not accept new fiscal and structural reforms without being able to show voters that the country 's debt would be sustainable , and that no european government could support a deal without assurances that it would be properly implemented . 
  absolutely yes , at very least i would like to see an investigation by the government concerning the benefits and disadvantages of nato for sweden . 
  the swedish policy of neutrality ceased in november 1991 , when the right-wing government declared that a ) neutrality was no longer an adequate policy for sweden b ) sweden were to partake in the construction of a new security foundation in europe hence , we are no longer neutral , we are simply put ` military alliance free ' . 
  also , you ca n't really compare the security situation today with that of the past . 
  the only reason sweden managed to stay neutral from ww2 until 1991 was that that swedish military was disproportionally large . 
  we had one of the largest and most capable military forces in europe . 
  one of the requirements for a policy of neutrality to be considered credible . 
  furthermore , sweden can not and should not rely on the eu 's mutual defence clause . 
  it is by far too ambitious and does not posses any framework as to how the assistance will be carried out . 
  are we talking about military intervention or simply sanctions ? 
  there is only one credible alliance that will be able to uphold the sovereignty of sweden in case of war , this is nato .

  given that sub 's interest in influencing the opinion of / r/ukrainianconflict , which they expressed months ago ( check out their thread titled `` how to resist pro-russian propaganda on ukrainianconflict '' ) , i 'm not particularly surprised something like this is happening . 
  i 'm just amused that it 's happening while we are having our own witch hunt for russian trolls .

  while the demographics of south ossetia have changed , it has not been a radical shift . 
  ossetians have always been the dominant ethnicity in south ossetia , a 2007 census estimated their share to around 67.1 % , by far exceeding that of georgians who only made up 25 % of the population in 2007 . 
  following the war the population has changed , as a 2012 census estimates that the ossetians now compose 89.1 % of the population compared to the 8.9 % georgian population in south ossetia . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/south_ossetia#demographics ( there are links to the original source of the data here , but it is in russian . ), 
  not surprising , a very large majority of south ossetians still feel strongly about the soviet union and have long seeked integration with russia as a investigation published in wsj revealed the following . 
  * ` was the dissolution of the soviet union a right or a wrong step ? ', 
  75 % viewed this as a wrong step in south ossetia . 
  15 % viewed this as a good step in south ossetia . 
  10 % answered this as do n't know/refuse . 
  the same invesitigation also asked * ` what is your preference for the political future of your entity ? ', 
  80 % viewed integration with russia as the final step . 
  15 % viewed independence as the final step . 
  5 % answered do n't know/refuse .

  shame there was so little coverage of it . 
  here in sweden i have been unable to find any of the events on television . 
  hopefully next tournament will receive more attention . 
  as a swede you should be familiar with misrepresentative statistics which give a skewed view . 
  by only looking at the current non-nationals residing we do not obtain the the full picture as we fail to take into account the level of non-nationals which settle in u.k every year . 
   gb is n't the top country for immigration hence the above is not correct as the annual number of non eu nationals being granted residency in great britain is far more than most eu countries .
