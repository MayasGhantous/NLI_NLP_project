  1 ) wikipedia 2 ) 2010 data 3 ) yearly immigration vs current percentage of population who have a foreign background . 
   gb is n't the top country for immigration . 
  in absolute numbers , gb is third after germany and france for non-eu immigrant population . 
  as a percentage of population it ranks eight . 
  seems to me that your premise is flawed . 
  what ? 
  great britain is unquestionably one of the top destinations for immigration . 
  number one for non-eu migrant arrivals and number two for non-eu immigration .

  i think he is referring to this debate article published in unt . 
  unfortunately yes ... 
  i think some sweden politicians are incredibly inept and naive in their attitude towards returning isis fighters . 
  you can read more about the proposal here https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=sv&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.svt.se%2fnyheter%2fregionalt%2fstockholm%2fstarka-reaktioner-mot-stockholms-satsning-mot-extremister&amp;sandbox=1 the report can normally be read in its entirety on the following website , but it is not displaying the report for me at the moment . 
  i 'm glad i moved my assets out of sweden , i do n't see any good future there either . 
  i love my home country but my god i think our politicians should win awards for being stupid . 
  recently politicians in stockholm approved a proposal that would grant significant benefits to returning isis fighters such as prioritising them in apartment queues , helping them find jobs etc. . 
  i ca n't remember the last time i purchased something made in russia , it 's all made in china these days . 
  only if you as a consumer are willing to forgo some of your disposable income to offset the cost of more expensive products from less efficient producers . 
  the eu can cry all day but the fact remains that they themselves have placed a similar travel ban on more than 100 russians . 
  this is nothing but a tit for tat game between eu and russia . 
  in its current form my answer is no . 
  needs more reform to make us companies adapt to eu standards . 
  they need us more than we need them !, 
  muahaha kiev we are coming for you !, 
  actually , the official method of calculating gdp used by many governments has been labelled as misleading due to distortions for population growth . 
  where sweden stands out dramatically due to its liberal immigration policies . 
  instead one should look at gdp per capita , which has decreased 0,2 % since 2007 , while germany has seen a 4,85 % increase . 
  additionally , sweden 's productivity growth is below the oecd average . 
  if it is so political then why did russia do so well this year ? 
  sweden did something similar in 2008  https://youtu.be/uk4grsxffxq?t=42s, 
  you are baltic , i will never see you as a nordic country . 
  i do n't see an issue as long as everything is properly referenced . 
  if you ca n't access the article http://www.docdroid.net/ych1/human-traffickers-advertise-their-trade-on-facebook-ftcom.pdf.html, 
  i 'm surprised it got taken down , it was a humorous way of illustrating the current sentiment on / r/europe . 
  well , russians are very patriotic and believe that their country does deserve a prominent role in the international arena . 
  this requires a strong leader , which inevitably leads to confrontations with the west . 
  e.g ukraine , a lot of russians believe it is their right to influence their backyard , in a similar way that the usa exerts influence over south america and china over hong kong and tibet . 
  only in a utopian world there would be no conflicts between east and west , but for now it seems that prospects for friendly relations are distant . 
  canada is in a very lucky situation . 
  not only is it protected by nato , it is also protected by the usa and is located in a region far from enemies . 
  russia on the other hand , is situated in a region that historically has been very unstable ( ww1 , ww2 , balkans etc. . ) furthermore , it does also border with several countries that have very strong militaries . 
  lastly , it is a very large country , which requires a large military so as to uphold the borders and deter any aggression . 
  ( look at what happened to pakistan with bangladesh or india with aksai chin , both these territories were lost a result of having a weak army/inapt army ) if russia were to decrease its military expenditure , it would take years if not decades to regain the technological and strategic capabilities . 
  not to mention the severe loss in international power as a result of having a weak army . 
  ( strong army = bargaining power ), 
  you are right , and hence the distinction between existing superpowers and former/potential superpowers . 
  with the latter referring to the case of russia . 
  additionally , it takes more than possessing nuclear weapons to be categorized as a superpower . 
  have a look at the bullet points below . 
  ** large military ** ** mineral wealth ** ** nuclear weapons ** ** large population size ** ** global influence ** all of these are fulfilled by india , russia and china . 
  hence they are potential emerging superpowers , as set out by n.d. arora . 
  i will provide link to this below , but you can also check this on wikipedia for a bit lighter reading . 
  n.d. arora https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=z8flb0gz3zkc&amp;hl=sv&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s potential superpowers http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/potential_superpowers, 
  most countries do n't have the size of landmass to defend and are formers superpowers . 
  ideally one should compare the defense spending of usa , china and russia , as these are either existing/potential/former superpowers . 
  comparing these three , there are not big differences in military expenditure . 
  usa 3.8 % , china 2.0 % and russia 4.1 % . 
  but you are right that the russian economy is terribly inefficient and has failed to exploit its natural resources , in a similar way that norway has . 
  whilst russia does contain over 30 % of the natural resources in the world , there are several problems in obtaining access to these resources . 
  such as the lack of infrastructure , outdated inefficient/broken equipment , lack of domestic funding and the difficulty for foreign companies to invest in natural resource projects . 
  for russia to fully exploit its natural resources it will require a severe modernization and financial assistance or help from foreign companies . 
  something , which given the current situation is increasingly difficult . 
  russia is profiting greatly from its trade with china , but it is only recently that moscow has decided to pivot its attention towards the chinese market . 
  trade figures are indicating a rapid gain in trade between these two . 
  lastly , every superpower does engage in some form of imperialism . 
  whether or not this is justified poses another question . 
  but the strong support for russia in crimea and the apparent lack of gunfire during the annexation of crimea suggests that it was the right move for moscow . 
  whilst russia is experiencing a current downturn in relations with the west , it does not have to search long for new friends , building strong partnerships in south america , africa , the middle east and asia . 
  the alleged presence of russian forces in eastern ukraine posses an entirely different question though . 
  you could say the same for practically every country in the world that has a military ... 
  you are right , but this exercise did not involve a diesel submarine , the french used a first-generation nuclear attack submarine . 
  the french saphir class submarines were launched in 1981 . 
  damn son , you got schooled hard . 
  google translate ** ukrainian embassy stops documentary on svt . 
  succeeded to do what the turkish embassy failed to do - but where are the protests ? 
  ** the fight for the freedom of journalism is undeniably contingent in sweden . 
  the other day railed against the swedish press that the turkish embassy demanded that a documentary on tv4 would be stopped . 
  it was of course shown anyway . 
  foreign powers should not affect what is shown on swedish television . 
  but on sunday svt would have shown the documentary ukraine - revolution dark side of the french filmmaker paul moreira , who earlier sent several reports svt . 
  it has now been postponed after the ukrainian ambassador ihor sagach in an email directly to svt 's ceo hanna stj\u00e4rne , demanded that it be removed from the tableau . 
  in his message the ambassador writes that the film should not be shown in the same year the swedish freedom of expression is celebrating 250 years . 
  he also makes recommendations on a ukrainian film producer svt should turn to instead . 
  strangely enough , the silence suddenly compact . 
  anders lindberg ? 
  journalists ? 
  any ? 
  svt now runs are cowardly , but in all honesty complete sense . 
  ukraine conflict has long since become much more controversial than to depict the infected israeli conflict . 
  documentary editors have been subjected to a massive campaign , not only from the ukrainian government representatives , including a dozen ukrainian and swedish organizations have signed a petition against the film . 
  svt has promised to find a new date as it may appear . 
  it is still unclear when . 
  is it a controversial documentary ? 
  spreads paul moreira lies about ukraine 's right-wing critics claim ? 
  it is extremely well made . 
  critics claim that moreira operates the thesis that the us is behind ukraine 's armed right-wing forces . 
  the statement is an outright lie . 
  what he says is that the anti-semite oleh tyahnybok managed to wash away his nazi past , good enough to get to shake hands with joe biden . 
  he says the united states has interests to prevent putin 's rampage , sell military technology and they do not understand the danger of right-wing volunteer corps . 
  the first two statements are a no-brainer for anyone who knows the least about foreign policy .
