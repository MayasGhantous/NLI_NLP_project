  the very last thing an issue worth discussing , but hardly a reason to stop the movie . 
  in fact , moreira 's film is more nuanced than we are used to in the accounts of ukrainian fascism . 
  for this is a documentary that talks to , and not only on ukraine 's right-wing extremists . 
  and it is extremely interesting . 
  nationalist self-defense groups must themselves explain why they burned to death 42 people in the trade union building in odessa . 
  paul moreira explains how they use social media and youtube to inflate their own hazards . 
  he shows how they harass journalists and the judiciary to put fear into society . 
  it is good journalism . 
  but that has not stopped people who should know better by joining in the protests . 
  swedish radio 's own putin scout fredrik wadstr\u00f6m has already criticized the film in p1 . 
  he is a watchdog that often roars when he thinks that the swedish media is impartial in the conflict between russia and ukraine . 
  cleverly , he has extended the public services mission to take a position on national security and against journalists who try to examine the ukrainian power . 
  he , like many other opinion leaders , have been put on standby helmet and gone to war against the russian propaganda . 
  and the war against the propaganda is certainly no surgical dr\u00f6narkrig . 
  it is rather the bomb carpet after carpet bombing against everything that differ from one 's own opinion . 
  a war of attrition that do not care about who or what is sacrificed in battle . 
  certainly it is true that the ukrainian right-wing extremism used by russian propagandists . 
  the russians would be fools if they did not . 
  it was already clear during the crimean conflict first weeks . 
  i myself have written about it . 
  but why avoid reporting on ukrainian fascism is doing violence to both journalism and freedom of expression . 
  journalism should not run political affairs . 
  point . 
  a special responsibility also rests on the swedish initiative for democracy and human rights chairman martin uggla in the lead . 
  one of the compounds protested svt . 
  when the swedish initiative is the largest swedish organization that works with democracy promotion in belarus and ukraine , you should be thinking about some of the conflicts man stoking . 
  to criticize russian policy in ukraine is obviously important . 
  to attack the free journalism ( even if you think it is bad ) is to put spokes in his own mission - namely , greater democracy . 
  it would clearly be desirable to owl and the swedish initiative clearer learn to distinguish between what is the struggle against oppression and what is just stupid nationalism . 
  how fucking hard can it be . 
  the only thing that sanctions do is limit the ability of certain individuals to travel and force russia to look for non-western financing and loans . 
  the main reason the russian economy is contracting so sharply is the dramatic fall in oil prices and subsequent knock on effects . 
  that is what you get when you do n't diversify your economy enough .

  not only did it occur on ukrainian territory , it occurred during a ukrainian exercise using s-2 / 300 systems against target drones . 
  sorry , but i am extremely skeptical towards any judgement made by the ukrainians on this issue . 
  you are far too involved in this tragedy to be objective . 
  i hold as much trust in the ruling of the ukrainian courts as i do for the russian courts on mh17 . 
  until i see an objective report from a neutral third party - i will believe the internationally recognised version of the transpiring events . 
  which is that ukraine is the responsible party to this tragedy . 
   ukraine finally admitted yesterday that its military shot down a russian airliner that crashed into the black sea last week , killing all 78 passengers and crew . 
  evhen marchuk , the chairman of ukraine 's security council , conceded that the plane had probably been brought down by `` an accidental hit from an s-200 rocket fired during exercises '' . 
  [ telegraph ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/1359353/ukraine-admits-it-shot-down-russian-airliner.html )  earlier today , ukraine 's military had taken responsibility after nine days of increasingly vaporous denials . 
  [ new york times ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/14/world/after-9-days-ukraine-says-its-missile-hit-a-russian-jet.html ) fyi , whether ukraine agreed upon a settlement or not is of no importance . 
  if i 'm not mistaken , the united states also agreed upon a settlement to settle the case with iran air flight 655 , but only if the relatives would accept that it was not an admission of guilt . 
  ( additionally , i do n't believe any report originating from ukraine dealing with the type of missile launched . 
  just as no one will believe the russian report which claims that the missile fired at mh17 was ukrainian . 
  the parties are far too involved to provide a objective and neutral opinion . 
  actually , many countries have shot down civilian airliners . 
  siberia airlines flight 1812 - shot down by ukraine iran air flight 655 - shot down by the united states, 
  ` russian aircraft su-24 crashed in syria . 
  according to the preliminary data , the pilots managed to eject from the warplane ' russian mod twitter \u3002 https://twitter.com/mod_russia, 
  there wo n't be an enormous retaliation , even if the investigation shows that the plane was in syrian airspace . 
  russia is not going to risk a conflict with a nato member over one jet . 
  mostly likely response if shot down over syria is increased protection for bombers using su-30 . 
  / r/ukraina not / r/ukraine . 
  but the former is known for bridgading other subreddits . 
  it would n't surprise me in the slightest if they do it here too . 
   just came across this thread on / r/ukraina . 
   the poster is talking about his discussions about recent events in donetsk . 
  he nice enough to put np . 
  in the link , but if you read the comments , you can see things like this :  \u0414\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0438\u0441\u044c , \u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0448\u043a\u0430 . 
   my translation : hang in there , bro . 
  i 've been there for a while and read your comments all the time . 
  you 're in my whitelist for upvotes ( like other respectable people like / u/luigrek ) . 
  i do n't have the temper to participate in such discussions , but i 'm hitting the [ ed . 
  vote ] arrows ruthlessly . 
  given that sub 's interest in influencing the opinion of / r/ukrainianconflict , which they expressed months ago ( check out their thread titled `` how to resist pro-russian propaganda on ukrainianconflict '' ) , i 'm not particularly surprised something like this is happening . 
  i 'm just amused that it 's happening while we are having our own witch hunt for russian trolls . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/ukrainianconflict/comments/2u9s15/rukraina_may_be_brigading_this_sub/ http://3.i-army.org/index_en.php, 
  thanks love . 
  i 'm rather amused at your attempts to downplay a significant historical event which is of great importance to topic being discussed here . 
  clearly a movement to unilaterally declare independence in 1992 is just a poll ... additionally , the poll you have linked was conducted in may 2013 , which is prior to start of euromaidan protests ( - november , 2013 ) thus , i do n't think it 's surprising to see such a disparity in the figures from the two polls . 
  as you surely know , southern and eastern ukraine were furious with kiev in february 2014 for introducing legislation which would have revoked the right to minority languages , such as russian . 
  i do n't think it 's too far of a stretch to say that relations between crimea and kiev experienced a significant decline in the time between your poll ( 2013 ) and the one i have provided from pew research centre ( late , 2014 ) which evidently would have an impact on public opinion towards questions of this nature . 
  for me , the history of crimea and it 's attempts of independence/closer ties with russia , public opinion data ( 2014 ) , majority russian population ( 60 % , 2001 ) and lastly the highly peaceful transition towards becoming a part of the russian federation paint a very different picture than what you are describing to me . 
  oh this is going to be fun . 
  did you know that crimea previously declared itself independent in early 1992 pending the outcome of a referendum , however , ( the ) ukraine declared the declaration of independence to be illegal and gave crimea one week to cancel the referendum . 
  in june 1992 , both sides reached a compromise and it was given the status of `` autonomous republic '' . 
  in may 1994 , the then president of crimea re-opened the crimean referendum , and contrary to the wishes of kiev who tried to stop it going ahead , voters voted in favor of the following 1 : 78.4 % voted in favour of crimean independence that had relations with ukraine on the basis of a set of treaties . 
  2 : 82.8 % voted in favour of dual russian/ukrainian citizenship . 
  3 : 77.9 % voted in favor of presidential decrees not covered in the may 1991 constitution being made law . 
  as you can see , there is no sudden wish for independence/greater ties with russia  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimea http://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/06/world/crimea-parliament-votes-to-back-independence-from-ukraine.html, 
  must be ( s ) right ? 
  pew research center is a highly respected and international respected think tank . 
  hardly a russian government propaganda outlet . 
  they do n't want to rejoin ukraine . 
  `` for their part , crimeans seem content with their annexation by russia . 
  overwhelming majorities say the march 16th referendum was free and fair ( 91 % ) and that the government in kyiv ought to recognize the results of the vote ( 88 % ) . '', 
  the only thing i heard trump say about nato seems to be that he wants the other members to stop freeloading . 
  only 5 of the 28 nato members meet the 2 % spending goal .

  sweden democrats are definitely not a far right party . 
  i mean it 's not like their recent history is tainted with racism and nazi scandals . 
  that 's a very poor selection of data and does not provide a good example of the origins of the applications for asylum within the european union . 
  if one looks at the data from the whole of european union the top 3 origins of people applying for asylum in the eu are syria , afghanistan and iraq .

  where is this solidarity when it comes to the refugees ?
