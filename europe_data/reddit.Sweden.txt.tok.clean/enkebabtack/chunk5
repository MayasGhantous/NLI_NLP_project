  eastern european eu countries including to but not limited to the members of the visegrad group seem to be doing everything possible to deny a fair distribution of the refugees . 
  eastern european eu countries love to receive money from the richer eu countries but show little solidarity when time comes to show .

   racist or religious abuse incidents recorded by police in england and wales jumped 41 % in the month after the uk voted to quit the eu , figures show . 
  there were 3,886 such crimes logged in july 2015 , rising to 5,468 in july this year , according to the home office . 
  it said the sharp increase declined in august but has `` remained at a higher level than prior to the eu referendum '' . 
   these figures confirm what previous data from the national police chiefs council suggested - that there was a spike in hate crime after the 23 june poll . 
  part of the increase is undoubtedly due to a greater willingness by the public to report offences and better police methods for logging hate crimes . 
  ** but strong anecdotal evidence supports the view that there was also a genuine rise in crimes targeted at ethnic minorities and foreign nationals : the brexit vote appeared to unleash something in people - they felt they had a licence to attack polish migrants and insult muslims .

  is the uk really in a position where it can cut taxes ? 
  it already has a unsustainably large deficit . 
  well in that case you should spend less time assuming stuff and instead do a quick google search before you leave a comment . 
  the uk government owns as of dec '15 73 % of rbs group which encompasses natwest . 
  which almost every major british newspaper has been found to have been doing . 
  the european commission even has a website to track all of the lies and fake stories about the eu in british newspapers . 
  regardless of your view of rt 's content this is without doubt a setback for freedom of speech . 
  there is no doubt that the uk government has exerted some form of political pressure on natwest to have them close rt 's bank accounts . 
  a stern warning to all other news outlets that do not fall in line . 
  well there is a minor problem with that argument . 
  the uk is not self-sufficient , it imports most of the raw materials used in production . 
  thus , a drop in the sterling makes it more expensive for these firms to to purchase these raw materials from abroad . 
   a weak currency is not much help for an economy that imports more than it exports . 
  the uk has a significant deficit in its current account -- roughly , it consumes more than it produces -- and this is almost 6 % of gdp . 
  of course , a weak currency would lower the prices of exports , but only if these goods are produced with limited inputs from imports . 
  in a world of global supply chains this is questionable . 
  even assuming that weak sterling would help shifting the uk model of growth from domestic demand to exports , this adjustment will take time and is unlikely to cushion the adverse impact of brexit on real gdp growth in the next few years .

  ** polish apple farmers bear brunt of eu-russia economic war ** laden with fruit , the boughs of the apple trees in the orchards run by poland 's eurosad sag with what will be a record harvest for the country , europe 's largest apple producer . 
  but while nature has rewarded poland 's farmers this year , geopolitics has not . 
  caught on the front line in the economic war between the eu and russia that was declared after moscow 's invasion and annexation of crimea in 2014 , poland 's apple farmers are cursing a bumper crop this summer , inundated with hundreds of thousands of tonnes of fruit with nobody to sell it to . 
  `` the situation in the polish apple market is rather difficult , '' said anna staszewska , an export specialist at eurosad , a conglomerate of apple growers with more than 30 farms and 700 hectares of orchards in poland . 
  `` poland 's growers have been hit hardest by the [ russian ] embargo . '' after brussels reacted to the annexation of crimea with trade sanctions against russia , moscow responded in kind with bans on food imports from the eu , cutting off a trade that accounted for more than half of poland 's apple exports , and roughly one-fifth of all production . 
  that , combined with an expected 10 per cent increase in production this year , according to poland 's official government statistical agency , to a record 3.5 m tonnes , has driven prices to unprecedented lows , leaving many farmers facing painful losses in a country that grows roughly a third of all the apples produced in the eu . 
  `` on one hand the higher harvest is a success , '' said grzegorz rykaczewski , a food and agribusiness analyst at bank zachodni wbk in warsaw . 
  `` but at the same time , it poses a huge challenge for polish farmers ... there is no profit with the market in this situation . '', 
  in june , a kilo of dessert apples on the polish market cost just 1 zloty per kilo . 
  industrial apples , used in juices , cider and other processed foods , were changing hands at 0.23 zloty per kilo . 
  that is about 20 per cent lower than a year previously , and half the price it fetched in 2011 . 
  `` we feel anxious about the situation , '' said marcin hermanowicz , owner of fresh fruit services , a trader . 
  `` [ if ] the situation continues , and there will be a lot of apples and the prices will be low , i think that farms will start to go bankrupt . '' sanctions against russia have become increasingly controversial with each six-monthly extension , as countries with better relations with moscow , such as greece , italy and hungary , argue that they are counter-productive and are failing to impact the conflict in ukraine . 
  poland has been one of the most vocal countries in demanding their continuation , despite the pain for the country 's farmers . 
  initially , a government campaign to eat apples `` against putin '' led to an increase in domestic consumption , but demand has retreated to average levels . 
  an eu aid programme to buy apples and distribute them for free offered some respite but not enough to make up for an end to russian sales . 
  attempts to find new export markets have had some success , but demand from those new markets remains low `` the process of acquiring new markets is not that easy and i would risk the statement that it is impossible to fill the gap of russian market by any other market , '' said miros\u0142aw maliszewski , head of the association of polish food-growers . 
  complicating efforts to offset the withdrawal of russian demand is that polish orchards have been calibrated to serve russian tastes . 
  a quarter of polish production is of the edelred variety -- apples liked in russia but not particularly popular in the rest of the world . 
  `` changing varieties takes time , and high costs . 
  and low prices means there 's less money around to invest in changes , '' said mr rykaczewski . 
  `` next season , prices will probably fall further . 
  so it is likely that many farmers will not invest in their orchards , '' he added . 
  `` and frankly , they need investment if they are going to offer global markets the products they want to buy . '' polish traders have had some luck reaching russia via re-exporting apples through countries unaffected by the embargo , such as belarus and serbia , but volumes are low . 
  and while new trade routes to countries such as india , china and the gulf have had some success , volume is paltry . 
  `` there is a crisis , '' said mr maliszewski . 
  `` and some farmers will not survive it . '',

  news agencies use stock footage all the time as filler . 
  no need to film the crimean landscape and sky every time something happens right ? 
  this is really just clickbait twitter nonsense . 
  sure poverty exists but in no where near the level you are describing . 
  for example , 39 % of apple inc operating margin was generated in greater china last year . 
  if they can afford to buy iphone 's , macbook 's etc i 'm sure they can afford to buy whatever russia can supply them . 
  the chinese middle class is just growing and growing .

  russia just saw its smallest contraction since 2014 . 
  industrial production is increasing . 
  inflation is decreasing as well . 
  ** everything is rapidly falling guys !!!, 
  it 's typical eu stupidity . 
  some eu citizens seem to think that they are the central market for everything . 
  yet the vast majority of the worlds population is not in the west . 
  india and china , two rapidly developing economies are much more important to focus on . 
  meanwhile eu countries like finland are suffering heavily from the sanctions . 
  well ` international law ' is a nice principle but it is not applicable to a strong nation . 
  if international law were to be applied to many western interventions i think hague would need to build a bigger prison . 
  well as of now yes . 
  but the area is still a war zone . 
  it 's not the correct time to start defining territory . 
  first there must be a complete cessation of hostilities before any direct negotiations over crimea can occur . 
  but i personally do n't think crimea will ever be part of ukraine again , the local population have made that point very clear through the numerous the independence referendums . 
  well previous polls conducted in 1994 also reveal a strong support for crimean independence . 
  as almost 80 % voted for crimean independence in that poll . 
  but this is something that is almost never mentioned in western media . 
  could have would have should have . 
  but based on kiev 's reaction to previous attempts i do n't think it would have been successful . 
  the 1992 crimean referendum about independence was declared illegal by ukraine . 
  the 1994 crimean was also declared illegal but went ahead anyway , where almost 80 % voted for crimean independence . 
  but i think in case of crimea i have no doubt that it will be recognised in the future as no longer part of ukraine . 
  but of course eastern ukraine is another story . 
  welcome to geopolitics . 
  regardless of whether world opinion it is clear that the people in crimea do not wish to be part of ukraine . 
  as independent polling conducted by western organisations have revealed . 
   for their part , crimeans seem content with their annexation by russia . 
  overwhelming majorities say the march 16th referendum was free and fair ( 91 % ) and that the government in kyiv ought to recognize the results of the vote ( 88 % ) .
