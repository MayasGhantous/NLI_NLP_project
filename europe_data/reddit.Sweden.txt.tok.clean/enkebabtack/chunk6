  ukraine should speed up the reform process and work towards peace . 
  i was quite shocked when i came across this public data but most ukrainians ( 70 % ) are still deeply unhappy with the government . 
  if the government fails to deliver then i do n't think it is unthinkable that new mass protests will occur .

  good work fsb . 
  ukraine should realise that it is imperative to speed up the reform process and work towards peace , not against it . 
  that is if ukraine still wants the support of the west . 
  nice attempt at history revisionism . 
  the joined peacekeeping force was the result of an agreement being signed between the head of parliament of georgia , eduard shevardnadze , and the president of russia , boris yeltsin . 
  thus , to claim that the peacekeeping force was ` unilateral and illegal ' is nothing short of hogwash . 
  georgia , russia and south ossetia were all members of it . 
  additionally , georgia remained part of it through out the entire conflict , as it was only in september that georgia withdrew .

  ** job losses loom for london 's fund industry after brexit ** city will lose out to ireland and luxembourg london 's fund industry will be hit by job losses after the uk voted to leave the eu . 
  the move sent shockwaves through the asset management sector and triggered turmoil in global financial markets . 
  britain voted by 51.9 per cent to sever the uk 's relationship with the eu on thursday , prompting fears that asset managers will cut staff and relocate others out of london to maintain access to european investors . 
  at least one fund manager rushed to draw up legal notices to stop redemptions from their investment products on friday , as the impact of the referendum became apparent . 
  it is understood that the financial conduct authority , the uk watchdog , contacted asset managers last week to check how well equipped they were to deal with redemptions in the wake of an exit . 
  amin rajan , chief executive of create research , the consultancy , said job cuts were now on the cards for the fund industry , which had been banking on a remain vote . 
  several fund managers are putting plans in place to move jobs from the city of london , the uk 's financial centre , to countries such as ireland and luxembourg , which are big centres for the asset management industry . 
  they fear a british exit -- or brexit -- would leave uk-based asset managers struggling to access european investors . 
  one of the uk 's best-known fund houses will move some jobs to luxembourg , according to an employee who was familiar with its plans and spoke on the condition anonymity . 
  `` we wo n't be moving our headquarters , but we do need to think about our resourcing in luxembourg , '' the employee said . 
  mr rajan said : `` over the next five years , the centre of gravity will shift to dublin and luxembourg for retail funds ; and frankfurt and paris for institutional funds . 
  london 's pre-eminence can no longer be taken for granted . '' earlier this year , the central bank of ireland , the financial watchdog , said it was preparing for an influx of investment managers from the uk to ireland if brexit were to happen . 
  pat lardner , chief executive of irish funds , a trade body , said : `` there is a uniqueness about our relationship with the uk fund industry . 
  and ireland has a deep relationship with the uk . 
  so that puts us in a strong position to help . '' camille thommes , director-general of alfi , the luxembourg fund association , added : `` for industry players this starts a period of uncertainty , and some might look for alternative jurisdictions , such as luxembourg or ireland . '' the uk 's exit from the eu comes at a tough time for asset managers , which are already dealing with falling profit margins and concerns about performance . 
  this month , mckinsey , the consultancy , forecast that profits at asset managers would fall by a third over the next two years . 
  daniel godfrey , former head of the ia , the trade body representing uk fund managers , who is currently working with the uk regulator , said the out vote would pile further pressure on asset managers . 
  `` there is an immediate downside for asset managers . 
  plunging valuations means plunging assets , and that will dent revenues . 
  the potential slowdown in uk gross domestic product would also result in prolonged pain for the market , '' he said . 
  `` all industries will see job cuts in that scenario and asset management will be no different . '' investment companies have tried to reassure investors about the impact of a brexit , amid fears they will pull huge sums of money from investment products . 
  assets in the uk fund industry have already fallen by a fifth over the past 12 months . 
  chelsea financial services , the uk fund supermarket , said on friday there had been a 10 per cent rise in investors looking to switch funds or move from funds to cash , or vice versa . 
  the uk and the eu now face what is likely to be a lengthy negotiation to unwind britain 's 43-year membership of the trading bloc . 
  saker nusseibeh , chief executive of hermes investment management , the uk fund house , said the outlook for markets and the fund industry relies partly on the outcome of the negotiations between the uk and the eu . 
  the city is expected to fight hard to maintain strong trading links with the eu . 
  however , britain is already receiving pushback from eu states saying there will be no renegotiation of the uk 's membership . 
  mr nusseibeh said : `` there is an expectation we will see a sharp and short reaction [ to the brexit vote ] . 
  my concern is this could be prolonged : that this is a steady decline rather than a short and sharp decline . 
  `` but asset management as a business is something that the uk is very good at . 
  i am sure it will survive , but for some it will be tough . '', 
  the ftse 100 closed at -3.15 % , but as you can see , my comment was referring to ** ftse 250 ** , which closed at -7.18 % . 
  ftse 250 is known to be a better representation of the british economy , as it includes ewer multinationals and more home-grown businesses than the ftse 100 . http://www.londonstockexchange.com/exchange/prices-and-markets/stocks/indices/summary/summary-indices.html?index=ukx http://www.londonstockexchange.com/exchange/prices-and-markets/stocks/indices/summary/summary-indices.html?index=mcx additionally , i am not referring to morgan stanley rumour . 
  it is unthinkable for a bank to immediately cut jobs a few hours after the referendum . 
  but the process to shift part of the operations to the uk has already commenced . 
  stop spreading misinformation . 
  ftse 250 closed down 7 % , going to be a long time before the market calms down . 
  likely to see further volatile until brexit is complete . 
  project fear was no bluff , major banks have already launched contingency plans to shift part of the operations to eu . 
  if the uk fails to negotiate a deal including ` passporting rights ' . 
  the banks will not be able to operate across the continent . 
  by remaining in the eu , banks based in the uk were able to provide services to the whole of the eu without having local offices . 
  london is the financial centre of world due to this and favourable banking regulations . 
  capital economics predict that exports of financial services to the european union will decrease by half ( # 10bn ) additionally , the ecb has previously attempted to deny non-euro zone clearing houses euro liquidity . 
  as the most powerful non-euro zone member has just left the eu it will be a lot more difficult to stop any future attempt . 
  which if it passes will force euro clearing and settlement to take place within the euro zone . 
  definitely not going to be business as usual without passporting rights . 
  if passporting rights for uk based financial services is lost i can guarantee you it wo n't be business as usual . 
  `` we believe that the scottish parliament should have the right to hold another referendum if there is clear and sustained evidence that independence has become the preferred option of a majority of the scottish people -- or if there is a significant and material change in the circumstances that prevailed in 2014 , such as scotland being taken out of the eu against our will . '' if the uk parliament denies them this option , it 's not unthinkable for them to unilaterally launch a referendum . 
  - the pound has plummeted to a 30 year low - japanese stock market has crashed 8 % and suspended trading - already a push for another scottish independence - calls for an irish reunification referendum - far-right nationalists across europe now calling for referendums and the demise of the eu - hundreds of uk pension funds underwater - ftse is expected to open 10 % down ( the bankers knocked 8 % off in the 2007 financial crash , so this is big ) - german dax market expected to open 10 % down - hsbc is worth # 10bn less since yesterday - s&p has announced that uk now likely to lose its aaa credit rating - in two hours ( as of 7am ) the uk economy has lost over # 255bn , the equivalent of 40 years ' worth of eu contributions - our prime minister has resigned, 
  `` in almost all western assessments , the exercise is described as concluding with a simulated nuclear strike on warsaw . 
  but this scenario appears problematic ; in a discussion with the author , a senior russian military officer who had been a member of the planning committee for zapad-2009 was surprised to hear this and said that a simulated nuclear strike had never been part of the exercise . 
  much of the english language reporting on the subject can be traced back to a single news story in the united kingdom 's daily telegraph by matthew day , entitled ` russia `` simulates '' nuclear attack on poland ' . 
  this headline , not written by the reporter , is not supported by the actual content of the story , and there is no mention of an attack on warsaw . '',

   russian official military doctrine involves pre-emptive nuclear strike . 
  false . 
  the russian military doctrine no longer has a preemptive nuclear strike provision . 
  it 's still a developing partnership with china . 
  way to early to call it a failed partnership as we have not seen the full-scope of cooperation set to take place . 
  already seeing significant improvement in bilateral relations and joint stances on topics such as ukraine and south china sea . 
  additionally , over 30 deals were signed last december during the 20th china-russia prime ministers ' regular meeting . 
  ranging from energy , investment , finance , high technology and more . 
  both countries set to benefit immensely from closer ties so we are just seeing the start of sino-russian cooperation .
