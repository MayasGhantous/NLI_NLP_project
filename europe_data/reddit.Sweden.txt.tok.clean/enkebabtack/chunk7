  russia won the tele voting ( public vote ) in the final and even received 12 points from ukraine . 
  breaching airspace and breaching the actual territory are two very different things . 
  if a armed russian military aircraft attempted to fly over uk without authorisation i am fairly sure it would be shot down . 
  a latvian aircraft that breached uk airspace and did not respond was very close to being shutdown .

  american military aircraft regularly fly near russian airspace with transponders turned off . 
  channel one , not interfax . 
  this is the 8th time in less than two weeks that american military aircraft approach russian airspace in this manner . 
  russia is an indisputable part of europe . 
  i also disagree with the idea that this is simply local news . 
  this business deal will help russia significantly expand the dairy production and offset the ban on eu dairy imposed by president putin . 
  additionally , the emergency funding launched by eu will have to be extended as russia diversifies itself away from eu dairy . 
  for example , finland 's valio is already suffering heavily , as it has had to cut its work force and loosing over 120 million euros in 2014 alone .

  thailand 's largest agribusiness conglomerate charoen pokphand group will invest $ 1bn to build the largest dairy complex in russia together with investors from china , russia and the middle east . 
  the complex will produce 400,000 tons of dairy products -- such as pasteurised milk , cheese and sour-milk products -- per year . 
  it will be located in the ryazan region , southeast of moscow . 
  investors include charoen pokphand group , china 's banner infant dairy products and the russian direct investment fund . 
  the deal was prior to a summit between russia and leaders of members of the association of southeast asia nations which kicks off tomorrow . 
  russia has banned dairy product imports from western countries in retaliation over sanctions that were imposed against the country over its role in the ukraine crisis . 
  the new plant is expected to boost supply for the country 's huge dairy market . 
  the average russian salary denominated in ruble has shown strong growth for over 10 years . 
  but following the deteriorating economic environment in russia , the rub/usd rate has seen a sharp drop in value . 
  one ruble used to be worth 0.0427 usd ( 10y peak 2007 ) whilst now one ruble is only worth 0.0149 usd . 
  great for export , but terrible for individuals who engage in fx transactions or import products from abroad .

  the vast majority of these incidents are actually occurring in international airspace . 
  i do n't know about the numbers of actual airspace violations . 
  but for sweden i know that usa is actually leading in terms of illegally entering swedish airspace with military aircraft .

  the swedish government is actively working on new legislation because currently they are not classified or placed in the same category as firearms , hence the punishment is much more lenient [ source ] ( http://www.regeringen.se/pressmeddelanden/2016/12/regeringen-foreslar-skarpta-straff-for-handgranater-och-andra-explosiva-varor/ ) .

  the defense will resume contacts with russia on the attach\u00e9 level the armed forces will resume contacts with russia at the level of defence in moscow and stockholm . 
  the announcement comes days before margot wallstr\u00f6m 's visit to moscow . 
  the decision taken by the chief micael byd\u00e9n in consultation with the department of defense . 
  - the armed forces have for some time now resumed military contacts through our countries ' respective defence attach\u00e9 . 
  the reason for that is that we see that there is a need for dialogue with russia on business objectives , says jesper tengroth , press secretary at the swedish armed forces to svd . 
  any exchange between the swedish and russian military has been stalled following russia 's annexation of crimea in 2014 . 
  the so-called arrangement plan that existed between the countries for contacts of exercises and incidents was not renewed by the swedish armed forces when it went out in the same year . 
  in moscow and stockholm countries defence attach\u00e9 been stopped from participating in the normal military exchanges by visiting briefings and exercises . 
  in almedalen last summer opened supreme commander micael byd\u00e9n that there is a need for an exchange on the military level in order to prevent misunderstandings , for example , in connection with incidents in the baltic sea area . 
  russian planes have flown on numerous occasions rejected the transponders that risked causing incidents in the air . 
  - misunderstandings can be extremely hard-won , said the chief then . 
  last fall , invited the russian deputy defense minister anatoly antonov , the department of defense secretary jan salestrand to moscow to discuss `` the security of the baltic region '' . 
  an offer that sweden declined . 
  now , the supreme commander returned with a new initiative and established political order in the ministry of defense . 
  no comprehensive , new arrangement plan is not , however , the current and the armed forces remain the same view as before on the crimean annexation . 
  jesper tengroth the armed forces to svd : - this is precisely the defense attache level . 
  we invite the russian defense attach\u00e9 to attend attach\u00e9 program that we organize in sweden , and the swedish defense attach\u00e9 in moscow will participate in the program that russia will arrange there . 
  why resumed contacts now ? 
  - we have been in line with activities in the area recognized the need to have opportunities to military contacts in the operational objectives and in consultation with the department of defense resumed contacts . 
  the initiative comes from the swedish side , not russian ? 
  - yes . 
  how has it gone to ? 
  - we have informed russia that we from now on will resume contacts at the level of defence . 
  foreign minister margot wallstr\u00f6m makes next week a visit to moscow for talks with his russian counterpart sergei lavrov . 
  it is the first meeting of the high ministerial level after the russian aggression in ukraine and the crimea , apart from a meeting on neutral ground in basel during an osce meeting in december 2014 . 
  these kind of remarks originating from across the atlantic are not a new phenomenon . 
  the united states has been putting pressure on the eu nato members to increase their spending for years . 
  even under the obama administration was this lack of commitment in terms of spending pointed out . 
  [ obama tells ` complacent ' europe to hike military spending ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/25/obama-tells-complacent-europe-to-hike-military-spending/ ) [ secretary of defense robert m. gates on nato spending ] ( http://archive.defense.gov/transcripts/transcript.aspx?transcriptid=4839 ), 
  it is great in theory but in reality , powerful states can turn a blind eye to it . 
  history is full of it , such as recently when russia withdrew their signature from the ipcc after they decided to investigate the air strikes in syria . 
  moreover , any attempt to enforce international law through the unsc can very easily be blocked because of veto powers . 
  for example , the unsc can pass a resolution which permits nations to use military action against an aggressive nation . 
  but if said nation has a veto or good ties with a veto power , this can simply be blocked . 
  as you see , international law is based on consent and self enforcement , if you are unhappy with any decision or investigation you can simply withdraw yourself from those agreements or ignore the verdict . 
  for this reason , international law is only effective against smaller nations that do not have the political force and clout to withstand international pressure . 
  international law is about as relevant and useful as the toilet paper in my bathroom . 
  powerful nations do not care and no one is able to enforce it upon them . 
  history is full of powerful nations turning a blind eye to international law and the future will undoubtedly continue this way .
