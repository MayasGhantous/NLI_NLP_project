  i still wish though there was some sort of affordable netflix/spotify for comics so i could just read the few i want and pay a symbolic amount of money . 
  and maybe there are and i 've just missed it . 
  exactly . 
  my parents got me and my siblings in their 20s . 
  i am the youngest of 4 children and they got me at 28 . meanwhile , i am in my early 40s and all my friends got their children in their 30s . 
  i better hurry up if * i * am to get any children ( luckily i am a man , so the biological part is less of a trouble , but id rather not be retired before my kid ( s ) enter the workforce . . ) ethnic swedish women wants to get a education , a job , travel the world before they settle down and get children . 
  so their birthrate is `` spread out '' over a longer time . 
   as a consequence of the change in rules and attitude , the migration agency is now predicting just 60,000 new asylum claims overall in 2016 , this is likely a worst case scenario though . 
  we are in august and has * just about * reached 20k asylum seekers with 4 months to go . 
  we are probably looking at between 30-40k with the autumn `` boost '' ( [ as seen in this graph from migrationsverket ] ( http://www.migrationsverket.se/images/18.2d998ffc151ac38715914eea/1471856035890/total_s%c3%b6k.jpg ) ), 
  based on my observations of how close farms are in rural south of sweden . 
  up north there could be longer distances . 
  last time we had about 30k was 2011 . 
  before that it fluxed from between 16k ( in 2000 ) and 36k ( 2007 ) so this forecast puts us back to the `` normal '' we had during the 00s . 
  there are wolves and bears there , and the forests are dark and scary ... 
  meanwhile , swedish grandmother 83 year old agda lives by herself with the closest neighbour about 100-200 meter away with a cat and a radio for company miles from nearest town . 
  you are absolutely right , no one would wear that into battle . 
  [ here is what a real viking helmet would 've looked like . 
  norwegians love swedes more than danes , because denmark gave away norway like it was a unwanted child , but sweden gave away norway to the * norwegians * and gave them their freedom !, 
  i dont think they were ever muslim , just ruled by them and forced to pay tax for not being persecuted . 
  actually , so far we havent taken in this few since at least 3 years . 
  and thats only because this page doesnt show the statistics from before 2013 http://www.migrationsverket.se/om-migrationsverket/statistik.html, 
  the mythbusters used to use the term : `` failure is always an option '' , meaning even if it didnt turn out as expected , it was something you learned from and brought with you to the next step . 
  that is how science work . 
  same thing applies here . 
  no , the ship was really well designed . . at the start . 
  what sunk it was executive meddling . 
  had henrik hybertsson had access to twitter , he would have said something in the likes of : `` a year ago i had a fantastic version of this . 
  and it would have received great reviews . 
  you 'll probably never see it though . 
  thats reality though . '', 
  considering there is a `` tropic thunder '' - inspired meme that goes `` never go full arnstad '' says a bit of the opinions of arnstad . 
  leftwing media and politicians still seems to like him though , for some reason . 
  you can go to a library and read the books there . 
  its not like theres some guard standing at the entrance asking for your identification card . 
  you just cant take them with you , since that would require you to apply and register for a card . 
  because he had `` no idea '' that women could get offended by men refusing to greet them by shaking their hand . 
  hows that feminism working out for ya ? 
  fair nuff, 
  and japan . 
  japan also has the death penalty . 
  i dont know if i would call japan backwards either . . 
  * stormaktstiden * ( 1611 -- 1721 ) is a relative new thing ? 
  once gustav eriksson vasa became king of sweden and broke up the kalmar union denmarks power vaned as swedens waxed . 
  i am not saying you are wrong , because denmark certainly usd to be the big dog in the nordics . 
  i am just perplexed as to up to which point you consider denmark remaining dominant until sweden took over ? 
  she studied biology for 6 years before moving north . 
  she quite possibly * is * the vet apart from the degree and license . 
  https://www.svd.se/okning-av-antalet-radikaliserade-i-fangelser it took me 30 seconds to google, 
  i dont think nyheter idag is really that `` sd-affiliated '' as you think . 
  its nowhere near fria tider and avpixlat that are much more extreme . 
  if i were to put ni on a scale i 'd probably put it just to the right of svd and gp, 
  eeh , to say it `` surged after stockholm attack '' is not entirely correct . 
  sentio polled sd at 26.9 in february , then down to 26.0 in march and now back up again . 
  sentio has always had much higher poll numbers than any other research institute and has had ever since june 2015 when it broke 20 % ( and hasnt been below that since ) while other ( more established ) like sifo still only have them at 16.7, 
  a couple of things that got lost in translation . 
  first of all he was sentenced in 1979 and was released in the 90s . 
  ( `` 1990-talet '' ) and since the article doesnt specify the exact year of his release this could mean anything from 1990 to 1999 . 
  so a minimum of 11 years and a maximum of 20 . 
  secondly , the guy was never sentenced to life imprisonment but to mental hospital . 
  psychiatric care is never for a specific time , but until the person is considered not mentally ill anymore . 
  psychiatric care is not considered a punishment , because the culprit is considered as much of a victim him/herself ( this is also why the person in the article is anonymous unlike those sentenced to real punishments ) . 
  there was also a prison reform in 1992 which means that it is now much harder to get psychiatric care than prison . 
   otherwise inmates will kill him . 
  i dont know about that . 
  plenty of radicalized muslims in swedish prisons . 
  he might very well end up their hero . . 
  wrong . 
  there is a way to apply for converting a life sentence to a timed sentence , but for that to happen the prisoner mustve been in prison for at least 10 years , and that application can be denied . 
  if a application for conversion goes through , then the * minimum * timed sentence is 18 years . 
  after that , one * can * be released after serving 2/3rds of the time ( so 12 years ) but there is ** no chance ** that this guy will get his sentence converted to 18 years . . 
  according to a study made by br\u00c5 in 2013 , the average time is now 25 years for a life sentence . 
  ( it was 14 in the 60-70s ), 
   there 's an actual human being in that picture but all you ignorant brutes see is the niqab by wearing that its * she * who makes sure the niqab is all we see , thats the underlying purpose of it . 
  last place among the nordics though . 
   right wing grey wolf people generally accept genocide for us unaware of turkish political groups , is it like the difference between neonazis who deny the holocaust and the ones who goes '' 't was great . 
  10/10 , would genocide again '' ? 
  impossible , he was known as `` gustavus adolphus the great '' after all . . 
  you dont replace the people who work for the public broadcasting at every election . 
  as most of them vote to the left and green they might tone down the rethoric somewhat when the right is in power , though . 
  alos quite surprised that norway thinks * their * media is left-wing as well . 
  many non-english countries still use `` white russia '' in their own language as name for belarus, 
  if i am not mistaken , wasnt it the fukushima incident that made them all panicky and started shutting down their nuclear power plants ? 
  and nobody never reflected over the fact that germany isnt exaclty in the top places to be affected by a simultaneous earthquake + tsunami ? 
  he is saying that ethnic swedes ( white trash ) living under the same conditions as poor muslims dont throw rocks , riot and loot stores -, 
  mostly they explain it away as socio-economic factors like poverty , drugs , lack of employment and systemic racism ( which shifts the blame to the ethnic swedes as being the bad people ) personally i think this is toxic reasoning because it sorts of remove any personal responsibility to attempt to improve your own situation through education , hard work and ambition and blame others for your own failure . 
  to increase the population in a country through immigration once it has reached its `` replenishment level '' ( 2 children / family ) is only valid as far as there are still countries with a surplus level from which to take thses immigrants . 
  but as hans rosling points on in one of his videos regarding `` the world is getting better '' more and more countries in the third world have reached the level of advancement that they too start slowing down on its fertility ratio and closes in on 2.0 / woman . 
  according to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_the_world this will happen globally around 2095 sooner or later the habit of importing workforce will drain a country of its people and cause it to have negative growth . 
  its happening already in some countries . 
  puerto rico for instance has had a negative population growth for 10 years now . 
  i 'd rather see we had a system where we wouldnt have to depend on a constant population increase sooner than later, 
  i keep hearing this argument all the time , but nobody really explains what you are gon na do when its these `` ready-grown '' humans time to become the elderly . 
  send them back ? 
  take care of them ? 
  the first option is inhumane and the second option is a pyramid scheme where you keep have to import more labor to finance the earlier one . 
  `` thats my secret . 
  i am always in recession '', 
  the finns supply the troops the swedes the weapons the norwegians the oil and the danes the food, 
  is this a good time to mention the wiki entry of '' [ polish parliment ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_parliament_\\ ( expression \\ ) ) '' ?
