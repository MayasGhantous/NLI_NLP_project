  my parents had one of those `` solar therapy '' lamps ... apparently they can fuck with your health somehow ? 
  ca n't remember the details , but my dad had some issues because of it so got rid of it . 
  thank god for that though , i always felt a bit naucious by it for some reason . 
  for reference , the us was at around 17 % in 2014 . http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sh.xpd.totl.zs?locations=us, 
  ohh they could get the most stereotypical representative of each eu country they can find and then make them live together !, 
  some streaming services already use automated translation ... 
  i think netflix does , for example ? 
  if they do , it needs work ... if they do n't , they * really * need to fire whoever does the translations to swedish . 
  how about getting your kebab ... [ in cheese ?

  how about swedish cheese ?

  we also put ketchup on our pasta !, 
  ketchup on our pasta !, 
  wait , you * are * supposed to shock people when they have heart attacks , right ? 
  really ? 
  i live near stockholm and most of the supermarkets usually have it at least part of the year . 
  never actually tried it , though . 
   sweden were even saying the uk mus n't be allowed to control and change tax rates once it 's left the eu . 
  kind of silly . 
  pretty sure that has never been said , but if you have a source i 'd be interested to see it . 
  what * has * been said by our prime minister is that the uk should avoid massive tax cuts * during the negotiation process * , as it may damage relations and make the negotiations tougher for both parts . 
  hey if sweden/finland is a dick 'n' balls , it 's only fair denmark is seamen . 
  you mean j\u00f3rv\u00edk , of course , and as a vassal to the great new swedish empire 2.0 , 
  1523 best year, 
  nah , it 's been renamed sealand on the map , so you 're se ~ ~ a ~ ~ men . 
  sweden does n't have a state religion . 
  1 roman legion vs. 
  the white death ^ ^ ^ ^ gg, 
  well , all companies make mistakes and ikea are typically quick to apologize and change when they do ( and they do a lot of good things as well ) . 
  i also do n't think that you can blame all of sweden for something ikea did just because they claim `` swedish values '' . 
   time does n't exist it does , and it can be distorted by gravity and speed , 
  well to be fair , that specific thing was done by a privately owned company ( nearly * five years ago * ) , and received massive criticism in sweden from both sides of the political spectrum . 
  well , the high ranking people still excuses the behaviour and refuses to do anything to adress it . 
  that they do public victim-blaming and claims `` jewish conspiracy '' whenever someone calls them out on it also helps give legitimacy to the stone throwers . 
  regarding the kids ... yeah , it 's what they 're told at home and by the imams . 
  i 've read about that teacher in malm\u00f6 whose class stopped coming to school when she `` came out '' as jewish for example , since their parents said it was `` not allowed '' ... or how it 's `` common knowledge '' in the same city about how `` you should n't drink coca-cola since the jews mix the blood of muslim children in it '' . 
  i 've seen the hidden camera videos where imams in these kinds of neighbourhoods tell muslims not to `` make white friends '' , not go to non-muslim doctors and dentists , not report crimes to swedish police , etc. 
  well it 's the same government that brags about their `` first ever feminist foreign politics '' even while the prime minister 's comment on women 's issues in saudi arabia is `` the women here face the same issues as women back home '' , so ... yeah . 
  what are * who * doing against * what * far right ? 
  the only reason `` hatred against muslims '' seems more mainstream is * specifically * because it gets mentioned in the media and because people * repeatedly and forcefully * condemn and criticize it ... to the point where legitimate criticism of certain aspects of certain islamic groups is attacked as `` islamophobic '' . 
  meanwhile , anti-semitism is barely mentioned or given attention since far fewer people speak out against it and it is far more accepted by a larger part of the population , media and political establishment . 
  sorry , what ? 
  to claim that all `` integration '' by default is racist simply because some extremists have ( according to you , at least ) attempted to use it for their own gain is just absolutely ridiculous . 
  well hate against jews is often excused or ignored by the left wing ... sometimes hate against kurds as well , though the green party scandals seem to have hushed that a bit . 
  if you ask many of the leftists here in sweden , it does seem like jews and white men are ok to hate while others are not . 
  not really ? 
  what i assume you 're probably referring to are actions by a fairly small group with little influence , denounced by most on that side of the political spectrum . 
  what i 've mentioned above is systematic oppression , negative treatment and views directly or indirectly supported by the entire left wing , which held power in sweden for the majority of the 1900s and shaped much of our culture . 
  it is constantly defended , ignored or excused by the `` mainstream '' * and * are positions held by people with actual seats in the swedish government . 
  there 's quite a bit of difference there . 
  well several social democrats have , at least ... something about how it implies that you demand the immigrant give up their culture and such . 
  the current government ( social democrats + green party ) abolished the `` minister of integration '' post and put the integration responsibility on the ministry of employment ( which , from what i 've heard , does nothing about it ) . 
  for which part ? 
  how reepalu was allowed to be * extremely * antisemitic without his party doing * anything * about it until obama sent an emissary ? 
  http://www.sydsvenskan.se/2012-04-27/reepalus-sprak-ar-antisemitiskt http://www.svd.se/judarna-flyr-malmo-och-reepalu-ser-pa how left wing cultural icons defended him despite the ridiculous claims of a `` jewish conspiracy '' and said emissary being appalled at the terrible situation for jews in malm\u00f6 ? 
  http://www.aftonbladet.se/kultur/article12229182.ab how kaplan repeatedly invited ( and spent time with ) anti-semites and homophobes , while excusing their behavior and refusing to properly denounce their ideologies ( over a period of several years ) ? 
  http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article22638109.ab http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article22649229.ab how the perfectly legitimate criticism against kaplan and yasri khan was called a `` zionist conspiracy '' by former green party leader per garthon ? 
  http://www.expressen.se/ledare/patrik-kronqvist/mp-goder-en-farlig-dolkstotslegend/ http://www.op.se/opinion/ledare/sionistisk-konspiration-ar-miljopartiets-hittills-mest-pinsamma-forsvar-av-kaplan how wallstr\u00f6m attempted to make sweden the * only * western country to vote for a resolution to remove the temple mount and wailing wall as cultural and religious icons for judaism ? 
  https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-lagar/dokument/skriftlig-fraga/unesco-resolution-om-tempelberget-_h3111142 how wallstr\u00f6m constantly blames israel for * everything * that goes on in that conflict , while repeatedly denying or ignoring palestinian crimes and the fact that both sides are just as bad ... followed by blaming a jewish/sionist conspiracy for trying to make her look bad ? 
  http://nyheteridag.se/wallstrom-anklagas-oppet-for-att-ha-sagt-judarna-kampanjar-mot-mig/ http://www.sydsvenskan.se/2016-04-24/annika-borg-regeringen-ger-stod-at-historierevisionism ... or some other part ? 
  i mean the whole `` kristallnacht scandal '' thing is covered in the linked article for the thread , for example . 
  if you want more for reepalu you just have to google his name , it 's quite easy . 
  well , just for some quick ones : constantly blaming every single problem ( no matter how minor ) in the israel-palestine conflict solely on israel , while excusing violent palestine action as `` understandable '' or totally ignoring it , then hinting at a `` conspiracy '' against her when called anti-semitic for it . 
  also blamed the paris terrorist attacks indirectly on israel , while in her role as foreign minister . 
  wanted sweden to be the only european country to vote `` yes '' for the un resolution to withdraw the recognition of the temple mount and wailing wall as having a role in judaism , thus robbing them of their cultural heritage ( until the opposition demanded a change in this decision ) . 
   alot of the hate against jews is from the right wing . 
  the single greatest source of swedish anti-semitism is the left . 
  even our * foreign minister * is an anti-semite , and the green party ( while in the government ) did * nothing * about their jew-hating islamic extremist members ( one of which was * our freaking housing minister * ) until they were basically forced to . 
  hell , the fact that reepalu * still * has a political career just proves my point . 
  muslim or not , the swedish left wing has a massive problem with anti-semitism ( since way back ) that they deny and refuse to deal with . 
  you ca n't integrate someone when the ruling party considers `` integration '' to be a racist term . 
  well it 's a biased sorce of course , but anti-semitism * is * a huge problem here ... and it 's been made far worse by ... certain political groups ( our current foreign minister is not allowed in israel for her anti-semitism , for example ) . 
  stuff in malm\u00f6 got so bad under reepalu ( social democratic mayor ) that obama sent a representative to check what the hell was going on . 
  that was shortly after reepalu had met with israeli representatives that considered him absolutely insane , and reepalu claimed that all criticism against him was part of a jewish conspiracy . 
   in this case ? 
  because israel . 
  and because the people hating are under-educated people growing up in ghettos . 
  it 's a much bigger political issue . 
  the left wing held kristallnacht commemorations and did not invite jewish groups , while right wing politicians attended the more downplayed ceremonies held by said jewish groups . 
  our social democrat foreign minister is banned from ever entering israel , promotes anti-semite politics and essentially blames jewish conspiracies for her problems with israel . 
  ilmar reepalu ( social democrat ) * repeatedly * denied the massive problems with anti-semitism in malm\u00f6 when he was the mayor there and claimed there was a jewish conspiracy against him . 
  the party leaders basically refused to comment until * obama sent a representative * because it had gotten so bad . 
  multiple high-ranking left wingers * repeatedly * spew anti-semite bullshit without being called out on it . 
  well kungstr\u00e4dg\u00e5rden station * is * supposedly the only place in sweden with a population of lessertia dentichelis , `` gruvdv\u00e4rgspindel '' ( mine dwarf spider ) ... 
  swedish unions fight for whatever they believe will give them more power , nothing else . 
  they probably figured they could gain some feminist support with this and it backfired . 
  not just that , but israel are so pissed off she 's not allowed to ever * enter the country * again ... which she basically said is a `` jewish conspiracy '' against her as a person . 
  * all * the arab countries denounced her for her statements , while the government sent * another * minister to mend diplomatic ties . 
  they wo n't even allow her to do her job anymore , but refuse to let her go ( even after the bribe scandals she had earlier this year ) . 
  our government keeps bragging about `` feminist foreign policy '' . 
  the prime minister was asked to bring up some women 's right issues while visiting saudi arabia a few weeks ago and commented that `` women here face similar issues to women back home '' . 
  not only that , but wallstr\u00f6m herself spearheaded the effort to get us into the un security council , despite protests from the opposition that it was completely unnecessary . 
  supposedly , us being in it will help us spread peace and equality throughout the world . 
  to get in , huge amounts of money earmarked for charity was used . 
  dictator asses were licked . 
  foreign policies and diplomatic stances were changed . 
  ridiculus promises were made to questionable governments , while earlier promises to vulnerable groups were broken . 
  but hey , it 's all worth it since we got in and wallstr\u00f6m can put it on her resume , right ? 
  right ?
