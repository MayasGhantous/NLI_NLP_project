  depends on where you live and such as well ... there 's * a lot * more people like that in the university city i live in now than in the small town i used to live in , for example . 
  especially in the humaniora sections ( the science people tends not to give a shit ) . 
  my university put in a `` gender neutral '' toilet earlier this year . 
  equipped with a full-body mirror , shaving tools , nail polish , etc and the door adorned with a designer sign . 
  had an inauguration ceremony with a performence artist and stuff . 
  now , literally none of the * existing * toilets were gender segregated in any way , but people pointing that out were quickly accused of sexism , transphobia , etc. 
  then again , our former vice prime minister ( \u00c5sa romson ) said during a speech that `` white cis men are behind everything bad in the world '' without many people questioning it , so maybe that 's just how things are . 
  yeah , many of the parties on both sides ( left/right ) are pro-equal conscription if conscription is used again . 
  i think most people support it as well , though i have n't seen any poll for it . 
  meanwhile , feministiskt initiativ ( feminist party , far-left , gets 2-3 % of the votes so not enough to be in the riksdag ) wants to abolish the military * completely * and replace it with a `` feminist peace institute '' that will `` solve all issues '' with diplomacy . 
  `` when russian submarines enters our waters , we should see it as a tentative attempt to approach us , rather than as an aggression , '' to quote one of their leaders . 
  we 've had people [ publically apologize ] ( http://www.svt.se/kultur/medier/snart-slut-pa-skrevandet-i-svt-soffan ) for `` manspreading '' in public tv , as well as multiple long debates about it on various newspaper sites , so ... eh . 
  of course , in the us it has been used as an excuse [ to arrest people ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/28/manspreading-arrest-broken-windows-policing_n_7462944.html ) , though that was more likely racially motivated . 
  there was * one * female migration worker that blackmailed two immigrant minors into having sex with her multiple times by threatening to report them for various stuff , but that 's basically all i 've heard about that . 
  if we could actually get some truthful reporting about nato in swedish news , i think support would increase . 
  as it is now , a lot of people are against it specifically because they believe `` joining nato '' is the same thing as `` getting dragged into offensive wars by the usa every couple of years with no chance of saying no '' . 
  so i 've heard ... they also have hitler icecream in india , iirc . 
  pretty much it . 
  humans domesticated dogs , and have been breeding them to fulfil various roles ; herding , hunting , guarding , fighting , acting as companions ... hell , even as [ imperial foot warmers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chinese_imperial_dog ) . 
  meanwhile , cats basically domesticated themselves , kinda like `` hey , these humans have tons of food and warm places , and they hate rats , so we can probably get something out of hanging with them . '', 
  sure , whatever you need to tell yourself . 
  eh , not like i care much anyways . 
  was just curious if you 'd have some actually intelligent follow-up while i was waiting for my next game to load , but guess `` i do n't understand basic discourse '' is what you wan na go with , so no point wasting more time here . 
  you were implying that i was calling for violence , by the context of your words . 
  do n't act like you do n't understand that . 
  not said anything even close to that , so no idea why you 're being a sarcastic , strawmanning douche here , but okay . 
  again , not arrested . 
  was two chinese tourists , about a week ago . 
  they were detained and released on bail . 
  got ta keep that pattern of chinese teams winning even years and non-chinese teams winning odd years , y' know , 
  i 've been in florida at the very edge of a hurricane . 
  saw more lightning in one night than in my entire life up to and after that point . 
  was totally insane ... as dark as midnight before 5pm . 
  `` i got 99 cheeses but a brie ai n't one '' is his catchphrase . 
  appeasements made under duress to maintain neutrality . 
  some of which would never have even * needed * to be made if the allies had not attempted to seize northern sweden and norway ( a plan opposed by both countries , by the way ) , which lead to the nazi occupation of denmark/norway and further isolation of sweden . 
  as for free movement of german soldiers on leave ... that was a * limitation * given by the swedish government , rather than allowing full movement of armed troops ( with the exception of allowing the 163rd infantry to reinforce finland against soviet ) . 
  at the same time , sweden also : - trained norweigian/danish troops and rebels . 
  - intercepted nazi communications between norway and germany , broke the cypher used and forwarded important information to the allies , leading to for example the british sinking of the battleship bismarck by supplying coordinates and such . 
  - had swedish businessmen and diplomats acting as spies for the allied . 
  - accepted tens of thousands of refugees , including thousands of jews , many of which may have been killed in case of a german invasion . 
  also used diplomats like folke bernadotte and raoul wallenberg to save tens of thousands more on the continent . 
  - in 1944-45 allowed us/british use of airfields , placed beacons to guide british bomb planes headed for germany , worked closely with the allies and helped direct relief efforts to areas around the eastern front . 
  coming with some `` swedish were an axis power lol '' bullshit just shows a lack of knowledge about what actually happened , or lacking ability to see nuances . 
   ( which sweden was a part of ) that 's a funny way to spell `` neutral '' . 
  literally the only time such a small non-event would be called a riot . 
  had it happened anywhere else or any other time , not a single person would 've called it that . 
   as a 15k broken leg is just bs . 
  if surgery is needed ? 
  do n't be so sure . 
  http://health.costhelper.com/broken-leg.html  without health insurance , surgical treatment of a broken leg typically costs $ 17,000 to $ 35,000 or more . 
  for example , at the kapiolani medical center in hawaii , repair of an uncomplicated leg fracture [ 4 ] costs about $ 16,082 , while repair of a complicated leg fracture [ 5 ] costs about $ 33,565 , not including the surgeon 's fee . 
  a typical surgeon 's fee could reach $ 2,000 or more , according to carolina orthopaedic surgery associates [ 6 ] . 
  scroll down to read plenty of stories of people getting charged way more than that , sometimes ( often even ) having to pay 1000s even * with * insurance . 
  you can also find a lot of other stories of insane costs just by googling `` us hospital bill '' . 
  [ 55kusd appendectomy ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/redditors-appendectomy-cost-5502931-2013-12 ) for example , or the [ later dropped 200kusd childbirth bill ] ( https://amp.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jan/01/british-couple-hospital-bill-baby-born-new-york ) some british tourists faced . 
  if you have no insurance , you 're fucked . 
  if you do , you 're lucky if it does n't still set you back at least a couple thousands it seems . 
  here in sweden there was a couple who got a police visit after someone called about them having `` is '' written in their window ... turned out it was balloons for 15 , because it was someone 's birthday . 
  also a `` beard club '' that someone called the police on , thinking that obviously a group of bearded men had to be radical muslims . 
  and a guy who had the cops called on him for `` running around with a pistol '' when he had climbed some fence at a football stadium while holding his phone ... turned out to be playing pokemon go . 
  swedish jakob de la gardie and polish sigismund iii vasa ( who was also king of sweden for a few years , and came from a swedish dynasty ) are the only ones i know of to actually capture moscow from the west ... both during the time of troubles , and de la gardie from rebels to return it to the tsar , though . 
  `` a large part '' of the swedish forces of the swedish forces were finns at least , according to the sources i 've found . 
  / r/fingols, 
  well the city kalmar is quite nice and old , and you should obviously take a trip over to [ \u00d6land ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%96land ) while there ... tons of iron/viking age remains on the island , including lots of ringforts and burial grounds . 
  you also have [ glasriket ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_crystal ) , the area with pretty much all the major glassworks of sweden . 
  also the city \u00c4lmhult , which is where the first ikea was opened ( and the location of the ikea museum ) . 
  never been to \u00c4lmhult myself though , so no idea if worth visiting . 
  in the northern part of sm\u00e5land you have gr\u00e4nna ( famous for the invention and making of [ polkagrisar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polkagris ) , and still filled with places that make and sell them . 
  gr\u00e4nna is at the edge of v\u00e4ttern , the second largest lake in sweden . 
  there are also some national parks there , like bl\u00e5 jungfrun island , which has a stone `` labyrinth '' and witch-related folklore . 
  also , if you have two weeks it should n't be too difficult to take day trips over to gothenburg on the west coast or stockholm in the north . 
  which part ? 
   i really do n't know why it has ended up like this . 
  one of the problems is that extremely strict rules and regulation makes it very difficult and expensive to build in sweden , meaning the rate new homes are being built is way too low since quite some time . 
  also does n't help that one of the government parties ( green party ) have been preventing some larger scale constructions on a local level , while the housing minister post has been having severe problems ( kaplan did essentially nothing while at the post , and the post feels half-forgotten since his scandals and resignation ) . 
  yeah , and that 's how it is anywhere with anything , basically . 
  negative people tend to be louder , while those who are content do not really show it . 
  that 's also why it 's important for politicians , game developers , companies , etc to not just listen to the loud minority , but rely on their own data , statistics and such . 
  however , when a genuine altrighter * does * come with the `` rape capital of the world '' bullshit or whatever happens to be popular at the moment , this sub has always been good at meeting that with facts and truth ... while according to the guy i replied to , you 'd always find them upvoted like crazy and anyone correcting them downvoted , which anyone who has spent more than 5 minutes on here knows simply is n't true . 
  i 've already told you , i have no desire to waste more time on your baseless arguing . 
  your `` evidence '' is moot , as it does not give adequate support to your claim . 
  certainly nowhere near enough to counter my hours upon hours of firsthand experience with the matter . 
  the fact that i have replied at all past the first two or three times was solely out of goodwill , in the hopes you would actually provide something useful for the discussion . 
  instead , you have simply been insulting , so i will not reply again . 
  not an economist , so this will be extremely basic and probably not * entirely * correct ( so please correct me if anything is wrong ) but ... basically , the bubble is that real estate prices continue climbing to unsustainable levels for whatever reason . 
  while it 's climbing , people keep taking increasingly massive loans to buy homes , or with the houses as collateral . 
  when the bubble pops , they now have a higher debt than their houses are worth . 
  they can not pay the loans back . 
  the collateral held by the bank is worth less , if the collateral is more than the new , lower price . 
  as a result , loan takers and banks are now in trouble . 
  demand for housing would also be much lower . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/real_estate_bubble you can read more about it on the wiki , for more detail . 
  i am denying the validity of your arguments , and that what you call `` proof '' actually is `` proof '' of anything you argue for . 
  i do find it quite hilarious that you make outlandish claims that are clearly false , go straight to name-calling when people disagree with you and then call * me * a troll though . 
  you did n't . 
  nah , i 'm done wasting my time . 
  it is quite clear that i wo n't change your mind , and your lack of actual arguments and repeated attacks on people wo n't change mine . 
  i also see you describing opinions that are clearly * not * altrighter to `` altrighters and neo-nazis '' , insulting people just because you disagree with them , etc. 
  * that * is why you are downvoted and disagreed with .
