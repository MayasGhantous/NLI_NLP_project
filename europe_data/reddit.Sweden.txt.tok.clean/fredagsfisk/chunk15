  you should be deeply ashamed . 
  what the fuck are you even talking about ? 
  urging nothing but * patience * ( and based on earlier experiences ) is progressive now ? 
  if you want to be upset about something , be upset at yourself for trying to make politics of this horrible incident , dipshit . 
  yeah , saw that now . 
  still , that 's preliminary at best . 
  with so many injured , there is sadly a risk that it will increase . 
  good to have a fairly quick official confirmation though . 
  remember , while this particular source does seem trustworthy , there were greatly exaggerated numbers being spread after other incidents , such as the sweden terror attack this year . 
  while it certainly might be true , i 'd hold off until at least tomorrow before trusting any numbers being thrown out there . 
  while the source seems trustworthy , i 'd hold off on believing any numbers being thrown out there . 
  there 's already been confirmed that gunman rumors were fake ... and after the terrorist attack in sweden this year , the net ( incl . 
  reddit ) was crawling with both false gunman rumors and vastly exaggerated casualty numbers . 
  some of them saying they were eye witnesses , others saying they heard it from the police . 
  to be exact , as a percentage of * potential * voters : 25,2 % for trump . 
  26,4 % for clinton . 
  3,1 % for other . 
  45,3 % did not vote . 
  except if we give out [ these ] ( https://sh-s7-live-s.legocdn.com/is/image/lego/630?$main$ ) to all of our military . 
  that 's because they 're from denmark . 
  how it works in sweden : pre-1523 : the dark times post-1523 : the best of times, 
  so ... they 're the [ mizune family from soul eater ] ( https://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/souleater/images/c/c0/episode_21_-_merge_animated.gif/revision/latest?cb=20160425235947 ) ? 
  it ended in 1523 when gustav vasa was elected king of sweden in the small town str\u00e4ngn\u00e4s . 
  only 6 years until the 500th anniversery . 
  here is video from the 400th , king gustav v visiting str\u00e4ngn\u00e4s in 1923 : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvd4uxiq_ty, 
   this world isnt black or white , its muddy grey . 
  he says , right before attacking the person he 's talking to for `` belonging to the other side '' which , spoiler alert , he does * not * . 
  and not only am i not left wing , but i also criticize them just as much as i do the `` altright '' , if not more , when it 's actually * relevant * . 
  not that you care , and not that i care if you care . 
  i 've better things to do anyways , and i 've no idea what point you 're even trying to make here . 
  no , because this is the conclusion they came to * after * thinking it through . 
  that does n't mean it 's right , or even * based * on facts , but the scary bit is that so many of them really * have * taken the time to think about this and * still * support it * despite * that . 
  for example , i spoke to a guy here on reddit regarding trumps 20 % tariff on imports from mexico . 
  he fully acknowledged the numbers i gave him on potential consequences ( tens of thousands of lost jobs , billions of dollars in lost revenues and economical growth , massive economic crisis in border states like texas , maybe even a temporary lack of food since so much is imported from mexico ) . 
  all true , he said . 
  the numbers are correct , these consequences clearly might happen . 
  however , he * still * thought it was a good idea ... `` because we need to focus on our internal market , and so should they . '', 
  what 's a few million lives potentially ruined , as long as it fucks over the `` globalists '' ? 
  oh , they have . 
  they are anti-globalists that wants every country to become more isolationist , prevent global trade and destroy the eu . 
  this because trump and altright sites like breitbart has been telling them how trade deals and the eu is bad for us workers ( see trump talking about the non-existant german-us trade deals for example ) , and how `` globalists '' are evil anti-americans/anti-christians ( several anti-colbert rants lately were about how he was `` not a christian , but a globalist ) . 
  oh , and you can also throw in some anti-semitism in there , because it usually comes up as well . 
  trump bombing syria was him being `` tricked by the jews '' , for example , kushner is bashed for being jewish and soros is literally the devil incarnate to them . 
  well yes , i understood that , but not exactly what this sentence would mean for example :  ** de\u0219ertul ** sau ** pustiul ** este o zon\u0103 care prime\u0219te foarte pu\u021bine precipita\u021bii , aproximativ 250 mm pe an . 
  the words `` pustiul '' and `` pustiuri '' are used in a couple of places of the wikipedia article , though i can not read the language and google translate refuses to make sense of it for whatever reason , so not sure on the context there . 
  here 's a timelapse of the largest park from valborg a few years ago : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7-l99tysns also have the forsr\u00e4nning , in which people go down the river in home made boats that usually fall apart over time : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkvc56c46d0, 
  palps could only start the war because the republic was corrupt , stagnant and ignored the needs of it 's people though . 
  it was propped up by the jedi , who at the time were similarily stagnant , the masters of the council zealous and hypocritical . 
  their methods were severely flawed , but the separatists * did * have quite a few reasons behind what they did . 
  s\u00e5 p\u00e5 en \u00f6 i en \u00e5 p\u00e5 en \u00f6 . 
  i 'll never look as good as [ neil gaiman in a wrap cape ] ( https://www.etsy.com/se-en/listing/203458582/il-sommo-poeta-black-wool-wrap-by?ref=shop_home_feat_1 ) though . 
  shit , i wish * i * could wear capes all the time without seeming weird . 
  capes and robes . 
  we should bring it back . 
  as i said , maybe not the us , but the * current administration * is * extremely * entangled with russia and her interests . 
  to the point of changing certain politics to suit putin . 
  pretty much agree . 
  seeing lots of people say that the airfield strike ( which only disabled it for a few hours ) was just `` sending a message '' though , so that might have been the intended public reason . 
  the whole thing might also have been to give russia an excuse to break the us-russian agreement so they can offer to lift sanctions in exchange for reestablishing it in a few weeks or so . 
  not that it means trump knows the actual reason . 
  they might have just told him to sign the order and people will love him . 
  maybe not the us as a whole , but the trump administration and those supporting it certainly are . 
  does n't that usually depend on what the short-term response of said establishment is ? 
  if they are seen as having messed things up , they fall . 
  if they are seen as having done a good job , they 'll rise . 
  yes , but these arguments were for general circumcision ... basically `` else you have to pull your foreskin back everytime you wash it . '', 
  some old studies claim that you have a tiny , tiny bit smaller risk of certain stds if you 're circumcised . 
  like around 1 % smaller . 
  people also like to claim that it 's more hygienic , but i 'm pretty sure that 's not really true unless you 're terrible at hygiene to begin with . 
  well it 's not may yet , and i would literally die from heat exhaustion if i kept using my ( insanely warm ) winter jacket now , so gimmie a week or two in the spring jacket before t-shirt weather . 
  during a 20 min walk a couple of days ago , i had sun when i started , then light snow , then bright sun and warmth again , followed by massive hail and finally ended with gray skies and heavy snowfall . 
  now it 's warm enough that my barely-warming spring jacket makes me sweat . 
  ohh right , i completely forgot about gigas . 
  really cool book with a cool legend behind it , though unlike argentus i have n't seen any of it irl . 
  aw you still love sweden . 
  no hard feelings about that [ codex argentus ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/codex_argenteus ) we kinda , hrm , `` found '' in prague after the 30 years war a few centuries ago ? 
  ( i was actually in prague not long ago , nice city . 
  also got to see the bridge swedish troops destroyed one tower of way back , and tons of historic buildings ) . 
  all parties except v\u00e4nsterpartiet ( the left party ) wants to make it illegal . 
  we have public trash cans with solar-powered trash compactors here in uppsala . 
  they also installed some sensor for when they open that makes them hum a short tune that over time has become more and more metallic and weird , kinda like a robot singing as it 's being mashed to bits . 
  well , my apartment has sun on the windows for basically 90 % of the day somehow , so i 'm pretty sure i would die if i had more than some loose shorts in the summer . 
  what 's stopping you ? 
  every time i counter that bs with actual sources , facts and statistics i get told that i 'm just brainwashed by my government and that they are working with media to cover stuff up in some massive conspiracy . 
  when i ask for a source for * their * claims , it 's almost always breitbart and nationalist/altright blogs and youtubers . 
  also peter springare , who has actually distanced himself from a facebook group that was spouting such crap in his name . 
  same , depending on temperature . 
  i like to have as little as possible on my feet though . 
  aftonbladrt reported today that the south african dude who he was held hostage together with was ransomed for 3,5 million euro . 
  both swedish and south african authorities deny any ransom was paid for either hostage though . 
  only place i 've seen beer in a vending machine was at a belgian hotel ... and only kriek , iirc . 
  you said they are `` purely anti-facist '' . 
  attacking anyone not part of their specific politics is not `` anti-facist '' , even if they want to call it that . 
  right , like when they stabbed that liberal guy here in town . 
  or beat up a moderate in a town further south . 
  or threatened the left party youth section in stockholm because they would n't let them speak at some protest ( which is a bit surprising considering the two groups usually get along quite well ) . 
  the original intent of the group might be anti-facism , but a lot of their * actions * are simply violence against anyone who disagrees with them . 
  every mainland part of greece i 've been to was great , with friendly people and all . 
  crete , however , had a lot of * extremely * rude people . 
  you also could n't flush toilet paper , there were insanely loud crickets everywhere and so insanely hot that you almost got burnt just from leaving the hotel room .
