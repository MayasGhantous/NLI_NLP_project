  really cool archeological stuff to see though . 
  too bad the guides working at these places started waving you forward and yelling at people if they stopped for more than a second to look at something . 
  stayed at a hotel in crete where you could n't flush toilet paper because apparently the pipes could not handle it . 
  had to throw it in a lidded bin next to the toilet , which was emptied daily . 
  pizza . 
  basically , you take the pizza dough , put kebab meat and cheese on it , fold it over and put it in the oven . 
  once it 's done , you cut it open along the edge and add the sauces and salad or fries ( different places have different versions ) . 
  some serve the fries on the side like in the pictures , others put them in the pizza-bag itself . 
  well , i have n't actually seen a d\u00f6ner box anywhere except from that place ... kapsalon seems more similar to what we 'd call a `` kebabtallrik '' here ( kebab plate ) . 
  fries , kebab meat , salad , some hot tomato-based sauce and some garlic/yoghurt sauce . 
  i generally go for the kebabpizza or [ viking special ] ( http://www.lumien.se/files/2009/07/p1070911.jpg ) when having kebabs though . 
  good luck !, 
  and remember to cut very * thin * slices , or it 's no good . 
  most recipes i 've seen online cut them way too thickly . 
  i normally use a pair of chopsticks placed on each side of the potato while cutting , to prevent the knife from going all the way through . 
  edit : good cut thickness : http://www.spisa.nu/recipeimages/ri_12403_3.jpg, 
  would it really get the right crispyness if you added cream or even too much butter , though ? 
  i ca n't see any of the examples be much more than soggy and boring , even if you reduced the amounts quite a bit . 
  they certainly would not be proper hasselbackspotatis anymore at least . 
  never had it myself , but you 're supposed to open the can under running water ( outdoors , of course ) to reduce the smell . 
  then you eat it on a flatbread ( can be either soft or crispy ) with boiled potato and raw red onion . 
  in southern sweden they usually have some gr\u00e4ddfil ( fermented sour cream ) or creme fraiche , tomato and chopped dill . 
  the bread is sometimes skipped . 
  often served with a snaps or beer . 
  there are a couple of pictures over on wikipedia if you scroll down a bit : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/surstr%c3%b6mming, 
  as a german , how do you feel about [ this ] ( https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0b/9c/40/98/doner-kebab.jpg ) and [ this ] ( https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0b/ac/70/f9/doner-box.jpg ) `` german d\u00f6ner '' from malm\u00f6 ? 
  if i buy goulash in a can here in sweden , i can choose between `` austrian '' ( has potato , no pasta ) and `` hungarian '' ( no potato , has pasta and paprika ) . 
  i personally only buy the `` austrian '' one though . 
  best goulash i 've had was in prague , with dumplings . 
  did n't have it in austria though , and never visited hungary ( yet ) . 
  [ actual hasselback potatoes ] ( https://theheartofthehouse.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/hasselback.jpg ) - crispy and flavorful on the outside , deliciously soft and juicy on the inside . 
  simply cut like that , brushed with a bit of butter or oil , sprinkled with breadcrumbs and maaaaybe some garlic . 
  versus ... [ the disgusting pile of fat ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xoqhyjf.jpg ) resulting from when abominations vaguely based on hasselback potatoes became popular for thanksgiving over in the us that one time a couple of years ago . 
  this one was using shitloads of butter , two types of cheese , oil , heavy cream * and * sour cream . 
  or ... [ you can make it even worse ] ( http://assets.kraftfoods.com/recipe_images/opendeploy/168222_640x428.jpg ) . 
  or just say [ `` hey , why even make it look similar at all ? 
  '' ] ( https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/30/dining/30cookbook1/30cookbook1-articlelarge-v2.jpg ) . 
  it probably depends a bit on the religion and the political alignment . 
  i ca n't imagine a sweden democrat would vote for a muslim for example , even if they might claim otherwise . 
  the green party might have some problems with any muslim members getting votes after the whole kaplan thing as well , though that 's just speculation from me . 
  in general i 'd agree that it does n't really affect much though . 
  fairly similar to denmark i guess , except cucumbers on leverpastej rather than beetroots , and pickled cucumber used on hot dogs would be chopped up [ bostongurka ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bostongurka ) or maybe majon\u00e4sgurka ( bostongurka + mayo ) . 
  pickled capers are often used . 
  pickled herring is of course eaten every major holiday , and also sold all year around ( i like to have some for late summer breakfasts at times ) . 
  breaded , fried herring is often also pickled with red onions and dill . 
  have n't tried that myself , but freshly fried ones are delicious . 
  huh , we only do that on valborg and graduation here , afaik . 
  according to [ this source ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2016/03/09/pregnancy-around-the-world-age-of-new-mums_n_9416064.html ) the average age in norway would be 28,5 years old for first child . 
  as far as i know , the * vast * majority of active fighters in that war ( as in well over 90 % ) are syrian so yes , that 's a civil war . 
  it 's also generally referred to as a civil war , and the various sides are syrian groups . 
  the thirty years war had forces from austria and from the german and italian states within the hre ... * and * hundreds of thousands of soldiers from france , england , sweden , denmark-norway , netherlands , spain , hungary , scotland , transylvania , croatia , serbia ... ottoman , russia , poland , etc. 
  hell , even portugal was involved at the periphery . 
  not to mention it 's not generally called a `` civil war '' . 
  basically the entire continent was involved , so calling it that would be super weird , except if you refer solely to the very start of it , when you could make a case that it was an imperial civil war . 
  * before * everyone else got involved . 
  sure , it 's just that i have never seen anyone call it a `` civil war '' before , and it seems a bit weird to me to call it that when so many others were involved and the consequences so far-reaching . 
  can you really call it a civil war when germany had n't formed yet and most of europe was involved ? 
  i actually have a book about it , though i can not find it at the moment . 
  out of the stuff i can remember , however , i 'd probably say the employment agency in general . 
  they cost billions each year and are supposed to help people find work , but they are completely useless at it . 
  their * own report * for 2016 shows that people who have attended their employment training ( advertised as `` greatly increasing your chances of finding a job '' ) actually has a * lower * employment rate than those who have not . 
  even when the employers are given incentives to hire them . 
  basically just that a bunch of them fled here during ww2 as we were neutral and acted as a sanctuary . 
  as for current view ... 
  i personally see them as just any people . 
  there * are * problems with anti-semitism in certain places and political parties though , which i feel is not acknowledged enough . 
   a larger than life figure no doubt . 
  however he was also a controversial figure , and even in swedish historiography it is pretty universally acknowledged that he was an aggressive warmonger and a megalomanic ruler with quite unrealistic goals . 
  i mean ... sure , of course . 
  that might be why he was ( * maybe * ) shot by one of his own , and there was massive criticism against his little norway invasion as i understand it . 
  however , you could say that about many rulers throughout history who did end up looking great in movies and shows . 
  they are often the more interesting characters . 
   definitely not everything beyond his control . 
  a lot within his control went wrong as well . 
  yeah , but mostly out of his control , if you disregard the `` end the entire invasion '' option ... like for example : - mazepa and his cossacks got slaughtered before they could meet up . 
  - at least three waves of reinforcements were held up by rebels or other things he could not really do much about . 
  - the second year of the invasion was the coldest year in over five centuries , but they were already committed enough that they could not stall it without russia rebuilding their armies by the time the worst weather hit . 
  - he was wounded prior to poltava , preventing him from leading effectively there . 
  it was his generals that messed up during recon and lost them the element of surprise , forcing them to attack before everything was in place , then saw the swedish force disintegrate due to poor communication . 
  the life of karl xii as a tragic epic ... start as he takes the throne and has to fight off a gigantic coalition , surprising everyone with his massive success . 
  move on into the invasion of russia , winning battle after battle against much larger enemies , but slowly getting his army whittled down , all reinforcements being stopped and literally everything beyond his control going wrong . 
  dramatic scene where he feels the entire world and god himself is against him . 
  have the loss at poltava about 2/3rds through , with a broken karl xii fleeing to the ottomans . 
  he desperately tries to get a russia-ottoman war going , but fails and is driven out ( include the skirmish at bender as a scene , absolutely can not miss that one ) . 
  he finally returns to sweden near the end , launching an attack on norway in an attempt to gain some land for the empire again , only to be shot by his own soldier . 
  credits roll as his body is shown being carried home , as a scene [ inspired by this painting ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/gustaf_cederstr\u00f6m_-_bringing_home_the_body_of_king_karl_xii_of_sweden_-_google_art_project.jpg ) . 
  a clear bonus is that his karoliner soldiers have [ some of the best looking uniforms ever ] ( https://sv.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/karoliner#/media/fil%3asvensk_karoliner_1700-tallet.jpg ) , and would look absolutely stunning on the big screen . 
  seems fairly common online to claim that the right wing government 2006-2014 was allowing immigration `` solely to import a new lower class of poor to exploit , since the natives are getting too rich '' . 
  interestingly , i 've seen it from both sweden democrats ( anti-immigration/refugees ) and left-wingers ( generally more pro-immigration/refugees ) . 
  and you did n't elect space-jesus-by-another-name ? 
  once or twice a week , maybe ? 
  i live in the 4th largest city in sweden , and generally see them about half the times i visit the city center . 
  i 've also seen civilian police in action a couple of times in the past month or so . 
  the minister of housing and urban development , mehmet kaplan ... he 's had multiple scandals in the past as well , with connections to various radicals . 
  they also fired one of their joint leaders ( they have two ) , \u00c5sa romson ( as she was the least popular of the two and had a shitload of scandals herself ) , and a lower-ranking guy who refused to shake hands with women , citing religion . 
  as already mentioned though , they are having serious issues in the polls because of this and many other things , hovering at around 3 % , well below the 4 % required to be in the riksdag . 
  well , iran feels like it 's moving in the right direction and attempting to improve . 
  sa does not . 
  well not `` watch '' really , but i have several movies/series i like to have running in the background while cleaning , cooking or doing dishes ... just to have some familiar sounds on without having to pay attention , since i 've already seen it . 
  depends a bit on the weather and season .
