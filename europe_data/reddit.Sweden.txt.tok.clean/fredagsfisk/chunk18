  or various weissbier . 
  one of my university teachers had a canadian girlfriend who did that and was wondering why everyone stared at her like she was insane . 
  after she found out why , she kept doing it as some kind of social experiment . 
  monster . 
  eh long pork as long pork . 
  it all tastes like chicken . 
  what ? 
  damn you hollywood , when will the lies end !, 
  you mean the day after tomorrow is n't a documentary ? 
  regarding kaplan and his ties to turkey ... 
  i think it 's important to note that he had * repeated * contact over several years not just with turkish fascists , but also islamists . 
  he invited homophobes , anti-semites and other islamic extremists to talk at meetings or even the riksdag several times . 
  he worked against the swedish recognition of the armenian genocide , compared modern jihadists to swedish volunteers in the finnish winter war and other such things . 
  also worth mentioning that romson ( the former co-leader mentioned above ) was used as a scapegoat for this and removed when it was ( the way more popular ) fridolin who was behind the appointments of the involved people . 
  also that per gahrton , former leader of the green party , blamed a `` sionist conspiracy '' for the entire thing . 
  i would be surprised if they made it over the 4 % limit next election , to be honest . 
  agreed . 
  as a liberal party voter who would * never * vote for his party , and who absolutely despises the whole party-union ties he basically embodies ... it 's enough to take a look at some other current world leaders to go `` you know what , stefan 's alright . '', 
  some of his ministers though ... at least we 're rid of romson and kaplan , i guess . 
  clearly you 're not a fan of olaus rudbeck then :  between 1679 and 1702 , rudbeck dedicated himself to contributions in historical-linguistics patriotism , writing a 3,000-page treatise in four volumes called atlantica ( atland eller manheim in swedish ) where he purported to prove that sweden was atlantis , the cradle of civilization , and swedish the original language of adam from which latin and hebrew had evolved . 
  and his son and newphew :  rudbeck the younger added speculations about the relationship between sami and hebrew languages to his father 's long list of fantastical linguistic relationships . 
  a nephew of olaus the elder , petter rudebeck , also wrote antiquarian books going even further , purporting to locate the scene of the trojan war and ancient city of troy in southern sweden . 
  now granted , their theories were considered crazy even by contemporary swedes , and were most likely partially the result of nationalistic fervor , but still . 
  they * did * contribute to quite a few fields ( language studies just was n't really one of them ) , they were ancestors of the nobel family and linnaeus was a student of rudbeck the younger . 
  as a mid-20s guy ... all my friends have tvs , though most use it only for consoles and streaming . 
  hm alright , i 'll try to remember that next time i 'm in barcelona . 
  what 's it called ? 
  `` pappa sven '' is the only one i get up trying to google for it . 
  ahh , our most [ delicious ] ( http://www.jennysmatblogg.nu/wp-content/uploads/img_3055.jpg ) dish that i would eat [ variations of ] ( http://www.polarbrod.se/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/smorgastarta-fruktig_800x4731.jpg ) almost every single day if it was n't so [ unhealthy and fattening ] ( http://cdn1.icakuriren.se/yto2ontzoji6imlkijtpojexnta1nty7czoxoij3ijtpojewmja7czoxoijoijtpojmymda7czoxoijjijtpoja7czoxoijzijtpoja7czoxoijrijtzojqwoii0mdy0mwrmmtvjzta3ogjlzwq2ymuzmtvhm2mxmji0yzblmdm4mdvlijt9 ) . 
  the military is also for crisis response and such , not just war . 
  yeah , terrible . 
  just looks soggy and fat . 
  supposed to be crispy on the outside ( and soft on the inside ) . 
   ( obviously not on the same pizza ) challenge accepted !, 
  [ this ] ( http://m.imgur.com/gallery/xoqhyjf ) is the worst i 've seen , and the one i always post when this topic comes up . 
  insane amounts of butter , multiple types of cheese , oil , cream , sour cream ... just disgusting amounts of fat . 
  ck2 - incest simulator . 
  stellaris - assorted horrors and atrocities simulator . 
  well , we have former social democratic party leader mona sahlin and her cycle of returning to a high position every 5-10 years only to leave shortly after due to corruption or scandals , if that counts . 
  this time might * hopefully * be the last , though . 
  she is under investigation for fraud , misrepresentation , unpaid taxes ( while transferring large amounts to an employee ) and some other stuff . 
  in the past , she has been forced to leave political positions and state employments over ( some are part of the same scandals ) : - unpaid taxes . 
  - unpaid purchases . 
  - using tax money to buy private things . 
  - lying about the situation and taking a partially tax-funded family vacation `` to relieve stress '' ... during the investigations . 
  - did not pay her public service fee . 
  - hired a nanny without paying taxes for it . 
  - 98 unpaid parking tickets , using two cars that had not passed inspection . 
  probably more that i 'm forgetting . 
  still she kept coming back and being given new high-paying , high-responsibility positions . 
  also was the first riksdag member to get her own parking spot , since the riksdag did not want to keep paying her parking tickets . 
   i 'd bet 5eur that / u/fredagsfisk is from around jonk\u00f6ping you 'd lose 5 euro  i live in uppsala and come from a small s\u00f6dermanland town a few dozen kilometers west of stockholm . 
  well `` brats '' in swedish is n't really the same as `` brats '' in english ... as for lattepappor , i kinda left it open because i was curious if someone would ask about it or not . 
   party smokers actual party smokers , or like my friend ? 
  `` i only smoke at parties , so it 's fine . '', 
  `` you 're smoking * right now * !, 
  this is n't a party ! '', 
  `` yeah , but ... it 's just an exception . '', 
  north - drinks hembr\u00e4nt ( moonshine ) , drive snow scooters and speaks using a [ series of grunts and by sharply sucking in air ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jixwb72y1zg ) . 
  south - basically danes ( mainly sk\u00e5ne ) . 
  stockholm - arrogant , self-important and looking down on the rest of the country . 
  hipsters , lattepappor and `` brats '' / stekare ( basically douchebags that dress expensively and in a certain way , drink champagne and act rich while living off their parents ) . 
  central sweden - `` pretty much stockholm '' to anyone outside it , `` absolutely not stockholm '' to anyone inside it . 
  also contains '' [ gn\u00e4llb\u00e4ltet ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gn%c3%a4llb%c3%a4ltet ) '' ( `` the whining belt '' ) , referring to a certain dialect spoken in many towns there . 
  dalarna - traditional/historical . 
  everyone lives in red houses , dresses in folk costumes and work on something related to dalah\u00e4star or handicrafts . 
  it 's just the sami who [ put cheese in their coffee ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leip%c3%a4juusto ) . 
  [ there 's also kebab . 
  ] ( http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1922/1633/1600/kebab.jpg ), 
  i would say that 's an understatement . 
  swedes in general are * fanatical * about meat/dairy being swedish . 
  it 's just a few weeks since arla faced a major shitstorm and calls for boycott in social media after someone posted on fb that one of their cream products said it was imported from denmark ( iirc ) , even after explaining that there was not enough of it being produced in sweden . 
  especially since the attack was pretty much illegal from my understanding , and trump himself tweeted about how terrible obama would be if he did that exact thing ... [ literally 13 + times . 
  ] ( http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/17-tweets-expose-donald-trump-hypocrisy-blaming-obama-syria-gas-attack-idlib-1084542694 ) [ also this . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/641yq5/take_this_in_trump_told_russia_about_plans_to/ ), 
  they even advertised that they expanded it recently . 
  well , good to hear not all schools are terrible at it . 
  all of it ? 
  including the statens institut f\u00f6r rasbiologi ? 
  for sweden , you ca n't go wrong with [ carl michael bellman ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carl_michael_bellman ) , from the 1700s . 
  tons of different versions of all his songs as well . 
  almost all of them are about drinking , brotherhood , friendship and such . 
  [ fj\u00e4riln vingad syns p\u00e5 haga ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc69urkmaqq ) ( the butterfly winged is seen in haga ) . 
  [ vila vid denna k\u00e4lla ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qqjym8jfly ) ( rest by this spring ) . 
  [ k\u00e4raste br\u00f6der , systrar och v\u00e4nner ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc0tw8nmoiu ) ( dearest brothers , sisters and friends ) . 
  version from the eu4 bellman song pack . 
  love their versions of the songs . 
  [ glittrande nymf ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bulcrpts3o ) ( gleaming nymph ) , song starts at 1:40 . 
  this particular version of this particular song is very well known , and fred \u00c5kerstr\u00f6m is famous partially for his bellman interpretations and beautiful/fitting voice for it . 
  [ m\u00e4rk hur v\u00e5r skugga ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssqmu-mywbq ) , performed by punk band imperiet ( a band that should also be considered a huge part of swedish musical culture ) . 
  to add more imperiet , [ cc cowboys ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axljcfe8vmm ) is about the cold war ( critical of both usa and russia ) and [ die mauer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4fv6daoonm ) about the berlin wall . 
  ya know , if you wan na get political , hah . 
   that we should teach more in school than we do could start by actually * mentioning * it in school * at all * . 
  i read about it outside of school , but never heard it mentioned once in twelve years . 
  it came up as a side-thing during a university class ( because i brought it up ) , and that 's it . 
  not sure how it is in other schools , but none of my friends learned anything about it either at least . 
  before mona sahlin lost the 2010 election ( with the worst results the social democrats had since like 1914 or something like that ) , she promised to demand a complete shutdown of * all * us bases in the entire world ... when asked , she refused to issue a similar demand for russia , and called it irrelevant . 
  he was also a big part of the nationalization ( socialisering ) movement , where the goal was to seize private companies and put them under union/state control , which is something certain * minority * groups within the social democrats ( among them a couple of ministers ) still supports .

  well , they are generally not sold here , so the store probably imported it themselves .
