  they have a fairly large snack-and-light-beer shelf ( regular beer ca n't be sold in regular stores ) , and the red cups have cultural associations due to us party movies , i guess ? 
  eva & adam from the late 90s had a scene where they held up an uncensored playboy magazine to the camera a couple of times . 
  another show for the same age ( 12-13 year olds i guess ? ), 
  and from the same time had full nudity as well . 
   do europeans like hot sauce that would vary * a lot * from country to country . 
  or generation to generation . 
  they 've started selling those at a store where i live . 
  insanely expensive . 
  150sek ( 15 euro ) for a 50 pack . 
  when it comes to full movies , i think kopps has to be my ( personal ) favorite swedish comedy . 
  it 's about a police station in a peaceful village in northern sweden . 
  since there is no crime there , the authorities are planning on shutting it down to save costs . 
  to save their jobs , the police start staging increasingly ridiculous crimes to fool the inspector . 
  one scene from it : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxc_3jtzoic, 
  str\u00e4ngn\u00e4s is what i 've heard , or the western m\u00e4lardalen region in general ( not too close to stockholm , as that has more outside influence ) . 
  you 'll also typically get the same thing just by saying `` en \u00f6l tack '' ( `` one beer please '' ) , at least in regular bars/restaurants that do n't pride themselves on their massive beer selection or something . 
   not exactly sure where we belong ... maybe your country needs to take a year off , travel a little and find yourselves ? 
  fun fact : * sm\u00e5 grodorna * was adapted from a british song written to mock the french . 
  the melody was originally from the french revolution song * la chanson de l\u2019oignon * . 
  knowing at least the basics about our most important historical figures is important , yes . 
  the anti-historicism that is prevalent in many parts of sweden and swedish society is kinda worrying , to be honest . 
   it was the date gustav i ( vasa ) was elected king of sweden 1523 yes , and sadly a lot of swedish people do not know this . 
  i 've spoken to several who said they learned in school that it was the date he was crowned in stockholm . 
  except it * is * the date he was elected , in str\u00e4ngn\u00e4s . 
  and he was later crowned in uppsala , nearly five years later . 
   ( others show it as neutral ) show me one done by someone other than svt/sr themselves that shows it as neutral , then . 
   not the first time either , josefsson is very political . 
  hence it 's fine to call him a nazi for doing a fairly balanced presentation of extremist violence ? 
  hmm , i 'll go with olaus rudbeck , 1630-1702 . 
  his main field was medicine , but he also did a lot of linguistics , botany , music , astronomy and other things . 
  he established our first botanical garden here in uppsala , though it was later renamed for carl linnaeus ( who was a student of rudbeck 's son ) , and he had the anatomical theatre and other things built . 
  he was one of the earliest discoverers of the lympathic system , with his supporters claiming he was the first ( there is some disagreement ) , and developed archeological age measurement systems well beyond what others in his time used . 
  however , the ** most interesting bit ** is his historical linguistics . 
  rudbeck spent decades writing his 3000 pages long magnum opus , * atlantis * . 
  there , he argued that sweden itself was atlantis , and that the lost part had been just outside of uppsala ( on the east coast ) . 
  to support this , he claimed that swedish was the original language , spoken by adam and eve in the garden of eden . 
  from this , both latin and hebrew would have evolved . 
  later on , his son would continue this work , adding links between sami and hebrew languages to the list . 
  his nephew wrote books about how troy and the troyan war were both in sweden as well . 
  both sr and svt are clearly biased , and it * is * true ( according to the studies i 've seen at least ) that over 80 % of those working there are left wingers . 
  to take a couple of examples : sr have stopped people from making political statements when they were right wing , while allowing far more severe political statements from left wingers . 
  quite often , actually . 
  just look at the summer speakers for the past few years ( farrokhzad in support of left wing extremism for example ) . 
  wiehe was allowed to sing political songs at alls\u00e5ng p\u00e5 skansen , with the expressed goal of `` overthrowing the ( then right wing ) government '' . 
  interestingly , when uppdrag granskning did do a pretty good and fairly impartial double episode about right/left wing extremism and violence , svt was accused of being right wing biased and the host ( josefsson ) was called a nazi ... by a host over on sr , among others . 
  very interesting wikipedia article listing all predecessors for each european country : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_predecessors_of_sovereign_states_in_europe also related : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/timeline_of_sovereign_states_in_europe, 
  i guess the closest you 'd get would be the various tribal kingdoms back during the viking age , before sweden ( earlier split into g\u00f6taland and svealand ) was consolidated permanently in the mid-1100s by sverker the elder ... and the later colonization and conversion of norrland . 
  i do n't think anyone would really consider that `` predecessor countries '' though . 
  maybe the icelandic one adapted better , branched out into wider issues properly ( and earlier ) and simply had a wider appeal among their population ? 
  difficult to say , really . 
  irregardless of one 's stance on the issue , and i do hope no one takes too much offense here ( as this is really an honest question ) , but did any non-member really imagine the pirate party would gain mass support over a longer period of time ? 
  while they have expanded their politics a bit , they were * very * much a single issue party for the first 5-6 years , and seemed to spend far too much time on specific laws and bills , rather than laying out more extensive plans on how to change the overarching system ( s ) . 
  i even remember the founder saying ( possibly jokingly , no idea ) they 'd flip a coin to see which side to support in any non-internet/integrity/copyright-related issues . 
  they did well in the eu election ( 7.13 % ) , possibly since that campaign was based a lot on countering or preventing ipred , which was based on a eu-directive ... but then failed quite badly in the national elections . 
  maybe due to lack of a specific law/bill to combat ... or their focus on a single issue causing voters to worry that other issues might be disregarded ... or was it just that whole `` child porn should be legal because freedom of information '' controversy getting so much media coverage ? 
  ah , interesting . 
  i 'll have to look into it a bit , i do n't recall hearing about it much more than as a passing mention sometime maybe . 
  [ people die if they are killed . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gmroxrmjxa ), 
   they call it the `` silicon valley '' of europe who calls it that ? 
  media ? 
  the people living there ? 
  not trying to sound aggressive here or anything , just genuinely curious . 
  i feel like calling stuff `` the silicon valley of whatever '' is a fairly common thing from media when they want to highlight that an area is good with startups , tech , innovation or economical growth . 
  stockholm [ was called the silicon valley of europe ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/11689464/how-sweden-became-the-startup-capital-of-europe.html ) by both swedish and european media back in 2015 , mostly for the reasons i mentioned . 
  that 's what we refer to as schr\u00f6dinger 's sweden . 
  it 's part of the apartment monthly costs ( which also includes water , basic tv , maintenance , etc ) , so not sure what the exact cost is . 
  the provider 's website says it would cost 25 $ / month for half a year , then rise to 30 $ / month after that , but since it 's through a bostadsr\u00e4ttsf\u00f6rening ( housing cooperative ) i assume they have some kind of bundle deal . 
  it 's supposed to be 60-100mbit / s , and generally varies between 90 and 115 mbit/s when i test it online . 
   why are n't their unions stepping in ? 
  swedish unions have been known to fire people for being members of the `` wrong '' party , so that probably would n't happen here ( unless the union likes the party you 're in ofc ) . 
  schools have done it as well . 
  a restaurant in stockholm kicked out a nationalist party member ( who has a riksdag seat ) because of his political position , which was apparently not illegal as political views are not protected by discrimination laws . 
  gustavus adolphus in civ v looks more like a mix between johan iii and erik xiv for some reason though :d, 
   the christdemocrats that always seem to cling to getting more than 4 % support votes from the moderate party , partially to ensure a stronger right wing in the riksdag and partially to keep a party in that is further right than the moderates , to balance out the political situation a bit . 
  yeah , as mentioned gustav vasa is undisputedly the most famous nationally . 
  internationally , i think it depends on * where * you ask . 
  karl xii is possibly more well-known in poland , russia , norway , turkey , etc. . . while gustav ii adolf ( gustavus adolphus ) would be more famous in most other places ( and he should be , in my opinion , as his accomplishments and effect on the world were certainly more impressive ) . 
  the government has specifically replied to his claims about sweden ( and fox 's so-called `` documentary '' and their so-called `` swedish national security '' guy ) , and our former pm has roasted him quite a bit on twitter . 
  our minister of foreign affairs got a rare nod of approval from me as she said we may have to bypass trump and work directly with states and companies when it comes to certain things ( such as climate work ) . 
  meanwhile , the nationalist party are super excited and jumping on the trump train , using his statements to support their image of sweden as a country that is falling apart and only can be saved by them . 
  the swedish king charles xii spent a few years in the ottoman empire after his failed march on moscow . 
  when he returned to sweden some ottoman creditors followed him there , as he had borrowed a lot of money during that time . 
  supposedly , this was when the recipe was introduced in sweden ( which at the time included finland ) . 
  it was first mentioned in the cookbook written by cajsa warg around thirty years after this , suggesting cabbage leaves for those who could n't afford vine leaves . 
  hah well the uranium was apparently an issue in 4-5 cities a few years back , no idea if still a problem . 
  the chalkiness is probably due to old piping in the area or something like that . 
  have n't noticed it in other buildings around uppsala . 
  what about our swedish meatballs and lingonberry jam ? 
  gravlax ? 
  the [ tunnbr\u00f6dsrulle ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpcytfxnu7y ) and [ sm\u00f6rg\u00e5st\u00e5rta ] ( https://www.google.se/search?q=sm%c3%b6rg%c3%a5st%c3%a5rta&amp;client=firefox-b-ab&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjd-6_4mldsahvf3cwkhcqadhyq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1033&amp;bih=938 ) ( sandwich cake ) ? 
  oh , wo n't * somebody * think of the sm\u00f6rg\u00e5st\u00e5rta !, 
  living in uppsala , and the tap water tastes like chalk . 
  it 's gotten way better since the old pipes in the building were replaced , but it still does n't taste good . 
  there was an article about uppsala tap water having above-the-recommended-level of uranium a couple of years ago tho ... 
  sweden requires places to have a `` dance permit '' for dancing to be allowed on their premises . 
  spontaneous dancing also counts , and has to be stopped right away by the owner . 
  this law is enforced and causes fines of 5000sek ( 500 euro ) or more . 
  late last year , all political parties except the social democrats voted `` yes '' to riksdag motions to remove the need for a permit , but the government has n't gone through with it yet . 
   with screaming for no reason mixed in .
