  snorri is one of * the * most important individuals in how we percieve and know norse mythology and history , with some of his political influence having consequences reaching far into the future . 
  he composed or wrote the prose edda , heimskringla and edil 's saga , for example . 
  counter strike . 
  sweden is the top earner in professional counter strike * by far * , both for cs and cs : go .

  got curious what google meant , so did a search for it ... loads of old articles about how awesome the pre-euro currency in latvia was . 
  as a swede googling `` why is sweden '' , top three suggestions are : ... so bad ? 
  ... so good ? 
  ... so good at cs ? 
  i assume it 's affected by me watching e-sports , to some degree ? 
  or do other swedes also get the cs one when searching ? 
  aw , if it makes you feel any better swedish google suggests `` why is latvia ... n currency so strong '' when i check it . 
  ( followed by `` so poor '' , `` population declining '' and `` famous '' ), 
  wrote `` why is montenegro '' into google here in sweden , really did not come with any suggestions . 
  huh . 
  if i actually search for that , however , it 's mostly people wondering about the name it seems ... which can be found out easily by just checking the wiki page . 
  sweden in general has very strict construction laws when it comes to building height . 
  uppsala ( 4th largest city ) for example has a law saying newly constructed city core buildings can not reach above the base of the castle ( located on a ridge , to ensure that the castle and cathedral dominates the skyline . 
  i think it 's basically only l and maybe sd that wants to increase the budget for the military , no ? 
  yeah , but i never said it was popular either . 
  just that stuff like that is being said , serious/popular or not . 
  ah yes , the classic `` i never met anyone who said that therefore no one ever will '' . 
  ah sorry , thought i included the source : https://www.reddit.com/r/shitamericanssay/comments/515fyh/why_apple_shouldnt_pay_eu_tax_we_saved_their_ass/, 
  ha , already being said a lot . 
  also , regarding apple being forced to pay eu taxes :  we saved their ass twice . 
  europe would be speaking german right now . 
  ireland is a usa 's satellite state and has no right to interfere in our business . 
  the uk are the only ones actively working against it * while leaving the union * . 
   the punish britain crowd and you 're just as misinformed as anyone else claiming britain is being `` punished '' simply because they wo n't get all the benefits of eu without having to also accept the responsibilities . 
  fun fact : the distance between moscow and venice is about the same as the length of the us-mexican border . 
  i should mention that a lot of people were angered by these rulings , but no one has really followed up and tried to change it . 
  the debate that has dominated lately is rather about gender divisions in open times at various bath houses . 
  it has become increasingly common for bath houses to have women-only times , which many see as a symptom of a larger problem . 
  irrelevant . 
  to some people , a pasta strainer on the head is a religious marking . 
  that does n't mean that every kid putting one on their head as a makeshift knight armor is suddenly in pastafarian attire . 
  context , intent ( and in most cases design ) matters . 
   what i find most disturbing in these cases are the self-entitlement and lack of willingness to accommodate the society they immigrated to . 
  there 's been at least three cases here in sweden with immigrants not being given internships at town halls because they refuse to shake hands with people of the opposite sex due to `` religion '' . 
  in all three cases , they were awarded damages of 10-30ksek ( 1-3k euro ) in court . 
  in at least one of the cases , the woman responsible for hiring interns was fired for racism . 
  in one of the cases , the man said it was fine if he could just wash his hands after touching a woman . 
  he was told that was ok , but that he still had to do the handshakes since it was part of the job ( and our culture ) . 
  he declined anyways and was awarded 20ksek in damages . 
  of course people are not going to accomodate to the society they immigrate to if they are rewarded for * not * doing it . 
  so `` no '' . 
  most companies would need to hire more people . 
  would you cut down on school time as much as well , or would the schools also have to hire more ? 
  yeah ... the last time the hours/day in sweden was lowered was around 100 years ago . 
  from 16 hours to 8 hours , since there was industrialisation going on that made that possible . 
  back in 1971 , 5 day work weeks were agreed upon . 
  from what i understand , this was partially thanks to computers improving efficiency . 
  i 'm not saying it 'll never work or that it wo n't happen , but i do not believe that we currently have enough technological progress for it to be economically feasible for a large amount of companies . 
  to claim that it would have no negative effects * at all * for anyone , like many supporters here at least do , is absolutely idiotic . 
  the costs may be acceptable in ... 20-30 years , maybe ? 
  you mean `` where do * these parties * think money comes from '' . 
  most people understand that this would not work . 
  those in favor of this claim that productivity would rise by at least enough to cover the cost when people get more free time , however ... in * all * professions . 
  when the former social democratic leader mona sahlin was trying to get votes , she promised a law that would make everyone working part time entitled to getting a full time position within the company they were working at . 
  she literally claimed that the work required for everyone suddenly going full time `` would appear '' if they did that , and that any problems would be `` fixed by the companies '' . 
  possibly the thinking behind this is similar . 
  there 's a classic ( as in often reposted ) newspaper clipping from a few years back with a woman answering the question `` do you care if the wares you buy are produced by children ? '', 
   yes , children has no sense of quality , and it 's noticeable on the end product . 
  now , i 'm * pretty * sure she was joking , but ... [ link ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_jdnef8gte8o/sel82z194zi/aaaaaaaaagk/aq9s_pzysla/s400/aaa%2520%2811%29%5b1%5d.jpg ) in swedish . 
  most of the left wing parties * do * wan na put in 6h work days with the same pay as 8h work days , saying it wo n't affect the companies negatively , though . 
  it 's like there 's more than one person living in sweden !, 
  wow !, 
  imagine that !, 
  and i am not comparing `` across countries '' and never was . 
  * you 're * the one who keeps changing the focus in some weird attempt to prove yourself right . 
  victim surveys are generally used to determine what the `` real '' rate may be and thus how many crimes go unreported . 
  those have shown no increase at all . 
  also , sweden does n't really record ethnicity statistics like that . 
  everyone i met in berlin was super nice and friendly , actually !, 
  of course , many of them were also drunk , but still . 
  maybe the drownings are from people setting themselves on fire and then getting knocked out when jumping in the lake to stop burning . 
  yeah but c'mon , you ca n't hold what * wallstr\u00f6m * says against us !, 
  she just does n't know better . 
  nah , official statistics show that india only have 2 rapes per 100k people while sweden has 66 per 100k , so obviously india has among the * lowest * rates in the world . 
  most of the `` sources '' i see people link when claiming stuff like that is anti-immigrant/islam blogs . 
  often using * very * outdated data . 
  you mean the amount of * reported * rapes has increased . 
  i 've yet to see a victim survey that shows that the * actual * amount of rapes has increased , rather than just the willingness to report them . 
  that 's completely and utterly wrong , but a fairly common claim from people online who in reality have no idea what they 're talking about . 
  it 's not really that similar , and the way statistics are collected is vastly different in a way that seriously inflates the swedish statistics compared to the norweigian ones . 
  the rate is * not * increasing . 
  the rate of * reported * instances is , but not the rate of it actually happening ( according to independent surveys ) . 
  most statistics that show an increase also fail to take into consideration that the increase may be due to a changed law ( like the huge bump in 2005 , which is due to the law having been changed in late 2004 and thus showing an increase of 400 % which is really just because it counted only 2-3 months in 2004 and the whole year 2005 ) . 
  yeah , that text basically says if you slept with someone who did n't fight back because they were blacked out drunk or too scared to move you can still get convicted for rape . 
  so no , it does n't say what you claim . 
  it says that the person would have to be so drunk she ca n't say no or struggle ... at which point it should already be obvious that you should * not * be having sex with the person . 
  swedish statistics count every instance as a separate crime , while other countries do not . 
  if the same woman is raped 20 times by the same man , it would count as 20 rapes in swedish statistics and 1 in other countries . 
  for dan eliasson it 's more than `` some scandals '' , though ... he was given the position basically because he hates the nationalist party and has a history of covering things up from earlier jobs . 
  under his `` leadership '' , they have become completely inable to actually do any preventive police work . 
  loads of police are openly protesting his actions , like the `` do n't molest me '' - bracelets in response to sexual crimes or his political statements and clear lack of political neutrality . 
  also , all crimes involving an immigrant ( as victim , perp , witness or whatever ) were blanket classified until media started questioning the legality of that . 
  descriptions of criminals are no longer being released at all since a few weeks , since they `` may be considered racist '' . 
  it 's less a scandal and more a complete and utter disaster . 
  i would imagine trust for individual police is high , while trust in the police management/leadership is extremely low .
