  that 's what one of my neighbours do every single time they have a party . 
  not loud music or shouting to make oneself heard over said music ... just plain , out-of-nowhere screaming and yelling at random intervals for 2-3 hours . 
  still better than the dude who lived there a couple of years back , as based on the various sounds , he and his friends liked to amuse themselves by running into walls while playing the organ . 
  [ anthony bourdain liked tunnbr\u00f6dsrulle at least . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpcytfxnu7y ) even if there was a bit of ... hesitation . 
  that 's kinda part of the point though ... if you want to drink weekends , you 'll have to plan ahead . 
  it 's not like someone will work 10:00 to 19:00 every single day , including saturdays , without even a lunch break or something , yet still have time and energy for drinking ? 
  * some * systembolag have started being open until 20:00 though . 
  well , there 's this : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chako_paul_city, 
  during my vacation to crete , maybe once or twice in florida ... utterly terrible , as i am quite heat sensitive and used to temperatures far lower than that . 
  do you frequent a lot of cooking sites and such ? 
  i saw quite a few articles linked on yahoo about it ( back when i still used it , in 2015 or so ) . 
  there were at least three or four imgur posts about it around thanksgiving that year as well . 
  do n't forget the olive oil as well !, 
  got ta get them * healthy * fats in there . 
  just surprised they did n't add some bacon grease while they were at it . 
  tongue removed because of cancer , so very sensitive to warm things . 
  apparently having it colder also helps bring out more flavor in it . 
  really ? 
  i 've always had great service in the us ( orlando area + nyc ) when i 've been there , except that one time . 
  once you get past the fake-friendliness that is . 
  best ... belgium , maybe ? 
  they were pretty good in most places there . 
  turkey had absolutely great service in most places , though their waiters tended to be far too eager at times . 
  worst ... either england or greece . 
  depends on the type of place you 're at , really . 
  crete was just awful , athens pretty meh , and in dehli everyone was very welcoming and friendly . 
  alright , so [ hasselback potatoes ] ( http://www.spisa.nu/recipeimages/ri_12403_3.jpg ) became a rather popular `` exotic thanksgiving food '' like 1-2 years ago over in the us . 
  properly made , they are supposed to be sliced about 3/4ths through as in the above linked picture , lightly brushed with butter and sprinkled with breadcrumbs before being put in the oven until they are crispy on the outside and deliciously soft on the inside . 
  some might also add a bit of salt , or garlic . 
  however , many us sites made their own versions , each more heretical than the last . 
  of course , [ most covered in bacon and greasy `` cheese '' ] ( http://assets.kraftfoods.com/recipe_images/opendeploy/168222_640x428.jpg ) ... or as a [ fucking gratin ] ( https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/30/dining/30cookbook1/30cookbook1-articlelarge-v2.jpg ) with more calories than a family pack of big macs . 
  the absolute worst one was an [ imgur recipe ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xoqhyjf.jpg ) for it , which called for filling the slices with alternating ** butter ** and ** cheese ** . 
  * huge * bits of each . 
  then pouring ** oil ** on it . 
  then pouring fucking ** heavy cream ** on it . 
  then adding ** more fake cheese ** bullshit . 
  *** then serving that ghastly , disgusting almost-capital-punishment-deserving abomination from fat hell with fucking sour cream . 
  my mom does it because she can only drink ice cold stuff for medical reasons . 
  other than that ... ca n't think of any excuse for such things , and i do n't even drink wine myself . 
  username checks out , i guess ? 
  also , i agree . 
  going with stuff actually written by swedish people , or stuff read here ? 
  the absolutely most famous ones i can think of atm : - almost anything by [ astrid lindgren ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/astrid_lindgren ) . 
  most famously * pippi longstocking , karlsson-on-the-roof , emil of l\u00f6nneberga , bill bergson ( that 's what blomkvist is in english ? 
  hah ) , madicken , ronia , saltkr\u00e5kan , bullerbyn , mio my mio , the brothers lionheart * , etc. 
  - [ selma lagerl\u00f6f ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/selma_lagerl%c3%b6f ) 's * the wonderful adventures of nils * . 
  - [ elsa beskow ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elsa_beskow ) 's various works . 
  then there are many others like gunnel linde and ulf stark ... and most children/youths will at some point read * eva & adam * ( by m\u00e5ns gahrton ) and the * sune * or * bert * series ' ( by ander jacobsson and s\u00f6ren olsson ) . 
  yeah , he claimed his reasons for those arguments were things like `` studies show gays are more intelligent on average so we have to keep those genes in the gene pool '' and `` we need all men to participate in preventing the muslims from becoming a majority because they 're more likely to have children '' ... 
  however , i think those are just excuses that he has somehow internalized and convinced himself off because he hates himself or feels shame , which as you said is quite sad . 
  obviously , alienating and persecuting a large group of people because they happen to be gay is far more damaging to society than accepting them . 
  just look at alan turing and the terrible mistreatment such a genius was put through . 
  and that 's on top of the whole moral issue , possible social divisions and the fact that there 's absolutely no reason for an outsider to care if two guys wants to have consensual sex . 
  agreed , and i think it 's a real problem here , especially from the left wing ( who are usually the ones pushing hardest for such things ) . 
  i like to illuminate stuff that we as a country did badly in the past , as we can learn from it and improve further , but i feel like i 'm often met with a `` we do n't talk about that '' or `` you 're lying since we did n't learn about that in school '' attitude . 
  oh yes , that 's why there 's also been a huge debate regarding the censorship of older books with racist components . 
  like tintin in kongo , or pippi longstocking calling her dad a `` nigger king '' . 
  certain groups just want all offensive stuff removed or the books to never be sold again , while others argue that the solution used by certain publishers ( keep it in , but add a discussion about the context and use of those words/terms at the beginning ) is better . 
  self-hating gay maybe ? 
  i mean it sounds like milo yiannopoulos , who is gay and often used as a `` see , the altright/breitbart support gays ! '', 
  kinda thing , but argues against gay rights ( which he says hurts western society ) and says gays should `` get back in the closet '' . 
  the green party here in sweden instead wants to hide the past out of shame ... remove all statues of so-called `` warrior kings '' and not discuss them and their possible other accomplishments because `` they killed people '' . 
  there are many groups who do n't want to acknowledge ( or straight up do n't know about since it 's rarely mentioned in schools and such ) things like the eugenics movement or the institute of racial biology ( first in the world ) either , which i think is quite sad and wrong . 
  of course , there 's also those who take the whole history thing * too * far ... seen some political debates where arguments like `` your party voted against this or that in the 1920s so your vaguely related argument now is invalid '' come up . 
  as others have mentioned , it really depends on what you mean with `` anti-americanism '' . 
  against the people ? 
  absolutely not . 
  against the country in general ? 
  nah , just some light mocking of certain aspects , like with any country . 
  against the state ? 
  to some extent , yes . 
  especially the left wing is very critical of many things done by the us . 
  generally even they are supportive of the democrat presidents though , if a bit critical against them as well at times . 
  now with trump ... there is quite a bit of worry . 
  him and his supporters obviously wants to break the eu apart , with some of the more extreme over on t_d even calling for war to do so . 
  trump also goes against a lot of our values . 
  * again * , however , this is aimed at trump and those who would support him . 
  we ( well , most people , there are * some * groups ) are very careful to separate that from the people and country in general . 
  to be fair , we had already gone to war with russia with great success many , many times by then . 
  even captured moscow from the west ( though to be fair , it was held by rebels at the time and the swedish army led by jakob de la gardie simply re-took it for the tsar ) . 
  we were even close to getting all of russia under complete swedish control a couple of times , one of them being when de la gardie tried to force them to accept swedish king gustav ii adolf or one of his relatives as tsar ( which failed due to some complicated politics , and several people realising there was absolutely no way we could hold and pacify all that land with our tiny population ) . 
  well , [ august strindberg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/august_strindberg ) is basically the `` father of modern swedish literature '' , with the novel r\u00f6da rummet ( the red room ) being the most well-known and probably most important of his works . 
  you also have several important plays by him , such as the ghost sonata , miss julie and master olof . 
  hjalmar s\u00f6derberg 's [ doctor glas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/doctor_glas ) is also quite important . 
  you have the genre of proletarian literature , `` arbetarlitteratur '' , which is considered important for it 's depiction of the working class and industry . 
  there are hundreds belonging to this genre , but i 'd say the most well-known ( and important ) ones would be ivar lo-johansson , vilhelm moberg , jan frideg\u00e5rd and moa martinson . 
  for children 's literature you have [ astrid lindgren ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/astrid_lindgren ) with a long list of influential and well-known works . 
  [ selma lagerl\u00f6f ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/selma_lagerl%c3%b6f ) was the first female winner of the nobel prize in literature , having written several important works both for children ( the wonderful adventures of nils ) and adults ( g\u00f6sta berlings saga , en herrg\u00e5rdss\u00e4gen , etc ) . 
  leaving literature and going into movies , we 've got [ ingmar bergman ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ingmar_bergman ) as the obvious answer , having had [ a massive international influence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ingmar_bergman#critique_and_influence ) . 
  seventh seal , fanny and alexander , etc. 
  for music , i 'd probably say 1700s [ bellman ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carl_michael_bellman ) and his fredmans epistlar ( which you may recognize if you play eu4 ) , a collection of 82 songs covering everything from drinking songs to beautiful nature hymns . 
  some example versions from youtube : [ m\u00e4rk hur v\u00e5r skugga ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssqmu-mywbq ) [ vila vid denna k\u00e4lla ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qqjym8jfly ) [ til gumman p\u00e5 thermopolium boreale och h\u00e4nnes jungfrur ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebfuxlmy1hy ) [ fj\u00e4riln vingad syns p\u00e5 haga ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc69urkmaqq ) ( actually from fredmans s\u00e5nger , not fredmans epistlar ), 
  \u00c5sa romson , and yeah kinda . 
  the situation was quickly becoming extremely unstable , with refugees ( incl . 
  children ) having to sleep on the floor in the immigration agency lobby and offices , hospitals and schools having no more room , etc. 
  the right wing parties had changed their politics and wanted to restrict it more after they lost the election and most leaders were switched out for new ones ( the old moderate leader still wanted to keep borders as open ) as they felt it was n't working out . 
  the green party ( romson 's ) wants to have completely open borders , and even send airplanes down to pick refugees up from the warzones ... however , they act as a support party for the social democrats , who finally forced them to agree to border controls and such . 
  it was during the press conference they announced that . 
  in general she has a really shitty record of press conferences and bad statements though .
