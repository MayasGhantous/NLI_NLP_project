  g\u00f6ran persson 's government in 1996-2007 pumped tons of money into it with no change ... reinfeldt 's government 2008-2014 started out well , reducing healthcare waiting times by * a lot * with some relatively cheap early changes , but then it kinda got stuck again . 
  not sure what current government is doing to improve it , but it seems to be mentioned less overall in the national debate now despite being just as bad as it used to be . 
  hell yeah , i love my cast iron stuff and use it like 90 % of the time , but sometimes non-stick is just better/easier . 
  one of my teachers ( older woman ) in elementary school in the 90s still scolded us for using `` du '' and how it was disrespectful ... only person i 've met that cared much though . 
  well you * did * stop using the [ bellamy salute ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bellamy_salute ) while saying it in the early 1940s at least . 
  parts of the national collectivism . 
  do n't get me wrong , i do believe some collective thinking is good for a nation , but there has to be balance and there are related issues . 
  for example : - individual achievement is looked down upon to some extent ( though it has gotten better ) . 
  - individual responsibility when you fuck up is lacking in many areas . 
  someone takes a bribe and `` we have to look over our systems '' . 
  a social worker repeatedly ignoring a child in need until they suicide and `` we have failed this person as a society '' . 
  - sheer incompetence in for example doctors and 911 operators is to some degree excused because `` integrity '' , instead putting the blame for mistakes on the system or ... well , `` society '' . 
  - draconian rules punishing those who do not `` fall in line '' . 
  while the cases i mentioned above are people protected by collectivist thinking , some unions will use their massive influence to instead punish those who do not join their collective agreements and follow their rules to the letter . 
  company gives their workers salaries and benefits the workers are happy with ( and which may be just as good as the union collective agreements would demand ) , but do not join the union ? 
  they risk being driven bankrupt . 
  it has happened many times . 
  the workers agree that they do not * want * to join the union ? 
  the company may be blockaded and prevented from doing business until they can no longer afford to hire them . 
  immigrant worker breaks the rules even a little ( makes 500sek too little over a 6 month period or something ) ? 
  kicked out of the country . 
  the unions decide the rules and collective agreements . 
  they already lived here for several years and their employer admitted the rule break was their fault + offers to compensate after ? 
  too bad , you 're out . 
  when karl xiii had no heir , the napoleon general jean-baptiste jules bernadotte was adopted as heir-presumptive ( in an incredibly complex process which included much subterfuge and secret messages ) . 
  as the first king of the bernadotte dynasty ( the current royal family of sweden and the only dynasty created during napoleon still standing ) , jean-baptiste took the name karl xiv johan . 
  under karl xiv johan , sweden fought against napoleon in it 's final war , 1813-1814 . 
  * the policy of 1812 * dictated a complete change in swedish foreign policy , adopting the policy of neutrality that has now kinda stood for 200 years . 
   would be pretty one sided . 
  indeed , with finland on our side it 'll be the great northern war all over again !, 
  ( in which the swedish empire stomped a denmark-norway , saxony , polish-lithuanian commonwealth and russia coalition , then started it 's decline as charles xii decided to march on moscow and failed rather than accepting the peace terms tsar peter i suggested ) . 
  i know three gardens that have them near my parents house ... not sure how that area is compared to the average tho, 
  i have n't played victoria , actually ... gon na try to get back into ck2 sometime soon though . 
  thankfully , i was mostly finished with university by the time i got into eu4 , so i got the timing right there  currently waiting for the next release of the voltaire 's nightmare mod for it , with some italy stuff and bringing it up to date with the latest patch . 
  best eu4 mod out there . 
  difficult one , as there are so many ... 
  i 've played quite a bit of battlefield 1 lately , which is nice , but more often i 'm in minecraft and europa universalis iv . 
  i 'll probably go with eu4 , really . 
  that 's the nice way of putting it , yeah , 
  not sure why the party is , but to quote the minister who commented on it :  the arguments that can be given for the abolition of the dance permits , particularly in terms of order and security , outweigh the need for reduced administration . 
  then again , the swedish social democrats have always * loved * their excessive administration , bureaucracy and complex regulations ... 
  since the 1930s , dances at clubs and bars without a permit has been illegal , with the owner facing rather hefty fines if allowing dancing without said permit ( yes , it 's actually still enforced ) . 
  this includes spontaneous dancing from your guests , which must then be stopped , with security guards if required , or face said fines . 
  earlier this year , after several failed attempts by most political parties , a motion to remove this ban passed the riksdag with everyone except the social democrats voting `` yes '' . 
  while the social democrats ( as the major partner in the current government , with the interior minister defending the ban ) can refuse to do anything about it , they 'd have to give a very good reason for it , or i think they can be reported to the `` committee on the constitution '' for ignoring the riksdag . 
  yeah , ignore the dansk ... everyone knows it 's at * midsummer * you erect the phallos symbol and dance around it , while singing about [ tiny frogs ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/sm%c3%a5_grodorna ) , the [ provost 's little crow ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/pr%c3%a4stens_lilla_kr%c3%a5ka ) , the [ fox crossing the ice ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/r%c3%a4ven_raskar_%c3%b6ver_isen ) and other such things . 
  `` sm\u00e5 grodorna '' is actually a swedification of an english version ( `` in step , little frogs '' , written to mock the french ) of * la chanson de l\u2019oignon * from the french revolution . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sm%c3%a5_grodorna ^ ^ sorry . 
  the song is also used [ in minority report ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d25deeokjoa ) . 
  good thing they have so much oil to light it with !, 
  according to every poll i 've seen , support for a nordic/scandinavian union is by far the highest in sweden ... mainly because it 'd likely be the leader ( or at least perceived as such ) due to it 's higher population , higher gdp , geographical location , etc. 
  needs the full scene to truly appreciate how awesome it is : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=much5x98rxg, 
  v\u00e4nsterpartiet in s\u00f6rmland * did * [ want to make it illegal for men to stand up while peeing ] ( http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article14957561.ab ) at public restrooms back in 2012 , but most people ( [ not all though ] ( http://www.metro.se/kolumner/forbjud-stakissandet/evhlfl!sfepony3nbrgc/ ) ) just mocked them for how stupid it was . 
  probably what was reported about , but sensationalized and exaggerated to get more readers . 
  yeah , so i checked the site of the largest newspaper in sweden ... they had a translated version of this article : [ this goat with anxiety only calms down when she 's in her duck costume ] ( http://www.today.com/pets/goat-anxiety-only-calms-down-when-duck-costume-t105482 ) . 
  yep , there 's a ton that almost every pizza place in sweden has , and most places also have their own local stuff ... often named after the city , area , street , neighbourhood , some dude the owner knows or whatever . 
  oh , and some places have a pizza named after some local sports team they support , which gives part of the profits for that specific pizza to that team . 
  also noticed more `` fancy '' pizza places in the past few years , which tend to use goat cheese , rocket/rucola , pine nuts prosciutto , real mozzarella and finer meats on most of their pizzas . 
  i feel the stories get a more `` personal charm '' when they 're all about the same character though . 
  there 's also ones with bellman as the hero , outwitting his opponent and such : one day , bellman was invited to court to entertain the king . 
  after singing and playing the fiddle for a bit , the king asked what other skills bellman possessed . 
  `` oh , plenty , '' answered bellman . 
  `` for example , i am the greatest swordsman in the land . '', 
  the king got furious . 
  `` how * dare * you !, 
  do n't you know that your king is the greatest swordsman ? '', 
  he yelled , but bellman insisted that he was better . 
  eventually , the king calmed down and agreed to settle the matter the next day . 
  come dawn , bellman and the king met up outside the castle , surrounded by the king 's stewards and some local noblemen . 
  a servant handed them each a sword , and the king demanded to go first . 
  after standing frozen in concentration for a moment , the king slashed at the air , cutting a passing fly in half . 
  the nobles and servants applauded as the king bowed and smirked . 
  `` your turn , bellman . '', 
  bellman nodded and took a stance , sword at the ready . 
  when a small fruit fly passed before him , he slashed at it , but the fly simply flew away . 
  the king howled with laughter and placed a hand on bellman 's shoulder . 
  `` nice try bellman , but you missed . 
  you 'll have to train more to beat me ! '', 
  `` forgive me , your majesty , but you need to look closer . 
  the fruit fly may not be dead , but he shall never father children again . '', 
  we do in sweden ... though more commonly it 's as a `` bellman joke '' version of it where it 's bellman and two nationalities . 
  bellman being a satirical version of historical poet , singer and composer carl michael bellman ( though they are really nothing alike ) . 
  example from wikipedia :  a russian , a german and bellman wanted to see who could swim the fastest across the atlantic . 
  first out was the german . 
  he swam 1 kilometer and drowned . 
  next came the russian . 
  he swam 10 kilometers and then he drowned . 
  now it was bellman 's turn . 
  he swam and swam until he almost reached the coast of america - then he got tired and swam back . 
  we kinda have the opposite from parts of the left wing though , i guess ? 
  milj\u00f6partiet ( the green party ) wants to remove statues with any military association , including removing or moving any statues of historical figures known to have any association with military matters ( such as the so called `` krigarkungar '' , or `` warrior kings '' ) ... feministiskt initiativ ( the feminist party ) wants to remove the entire military and replace it with a `` feminist peace institute '' , and regards the military as a bunch of violent men who are only good for fighting ( disregarding that the swedish military is basically only used for peacekeeping operations and to assist during disasters . 
  there 's quite a few ... ** the battle of breitenfeld ** had swedish ( and saxon ) forces slaughtering the army of the holy roman empire , ending their ability to field a larger army and causing several princes to join the protestant side , turning the thirty years ' war in their favor . 
  this was a very important step towards religious freedom in europe , and cemented sweden as a major power ( the swedish empire ) . 
  ** charles xii ** marched on moscow after defeating a huge coalition against sweden , winning every major battle along the way . 
  literally everything that could go wrong outside of that went wrong , however , culminating in the king being injured just before the battle of poltava , which was then lost ( under the command of someone else ) . 
  after this , he fled to the ottomans , attempted to get them to declare war on russia , failed and was later driven out at the [ skirmish at bender ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/skirmish_at_bender ) when refusing to leave . 
  started a new war when he got back home , was killed while overlooking some defenses , possibly by friendly fire . 
  started the decline of the swedish empire . 
  see , she does it so much there 's not even any media left to report about it !, 
  to add to what has already been said , there are a lot of rules , regulations and costs related to building in sweden .
