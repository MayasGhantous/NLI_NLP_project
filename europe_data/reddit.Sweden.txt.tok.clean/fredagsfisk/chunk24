  all the stuff i mentioned above are actual party politics from them . 
  the re-education camps , for example ... a suggestion from them to change male consumption patterns `` since men are more likely to buy large suvs and destroy the environment through thoughtless spending '' . 
  the highest they 've gotten in a riksdag election is around 3 % , though ( you need 4 % to get a seat ) . 
  they have a large following among university students , but most people do n't take them very seriously . 
  especially since they mainly rely on media stunts to gain coverage ( like burning money on stage to highlight income differences between genders ) and come with extremely stupid suggestions such as gender segregated parking areas , man taxes , re-education camps for men , abolishing prisons and the military ( which would be replaced with a `` feminist center for peace '' ) , a global ban on weapons ( no idea how they think that 'd work ) , etc. 
  milj\u00f6partiet ( the green party ) wants completely open borders and got 6,89 % of the votes in the last riksdag election ( down to around 4-5 % in most polls now , though ) . 
  they also want to use the swedish military and airforce to fly down and bring home any refugee that wants to come here . 
  the feminist party and left party also support completely open borders , along with ( the more left wing parts of ) the social democrats . 
  the center party wanted it back in 2012-2014 but have gone * slightly * more restrictive since . 
  not sure how many of the actual population would be for such insanity , though ... anywhere between 5 % and 25 % , i 'd guess . 
  yes , because lower tier cops will obviously * never * be so bold as to express a political view based on faulty information . 
  even in a country where the police themselves have admitted to having issues with such political views within the lower tiers . 
  obviously . 
  as i said , those areas * do not exist * and you have provided me with no source that they do . 
  you just keep regurgitating what you read on some bs hate site , so i 'm out of this discussion . 
   they arrived and were immediately attacked within minutes . 
  then cops arrived and did n't do anything and said they 'd wait at a distance and as soon as they left we 're attacked again , then after that they were attacked a third time . 
  source ? 
   also i would call an area where cops are scared to even enter out of fair of `` causing tensions '' is pretty much the definition of a no go zone . 
  your cops do n't have control over all your territory , it 's that simple . 
  there are areas with more unrest ( and such issues ) than other areas , like in * every single other country * , but such areas like you describe does not exist , except as part of the anti-immigration narrative of certain political groups and media . 
  you mean the exclusion zones that the police have specifically avoided calling nogo zones because they do not fulfil the traditional definition of one , though they do happen to be problematic areas ( that have mostly existed for quite a bit longer than the migrant crisis has been going on ) ? 
  also , what tv crew ? 
  the only one i remember reading about ( and can find on google ) is the australian 60 minutes crew , who was supposedly attacked * once * while visiting an immigrant-heavy area , while working with an anti-immigration site ( which many consider a `` hate site '' ) and attempting to film an obviously biased segment on immigration ... one of the representatives of said sites being with them on location . 
  that case was dismissed after the police decided there was no proper evidence of what was claimed to have happened and the tv studio denied anything serious * had * happened . 
  it was also blown out of proportion on certain sites , including several false and/or contradictory claims . 
  yes . 
  obviously , there are issues though ( not to mention i 'm quite sure a lot of people feel pressured to stand/recite no matter if they want to or not ) . 
  `` rolig '' means `` calm '' in norweigian and `` funny '' in swedish . 
  the word `` window '' itself comes from old norse `` vindauga '' , meaning `` wind eye '' . 
  referred to a small hole in the wall near the roof , where smoke from the fireplace would leave the building . 
  it has cost the state * a lot * of money short-term at least , while polarizing our politics ( though that is mainly because of certain political parties and how media has handled it ) . 
  difficult to analyze how that has affected my day-to-day life though . 
  as for direct effects , none really . 
  i have n't really met any at all , other than maybe passing them on the street . 
  a friend has met some at a nightclub , said they were very polite and respectful ( though bad at english and not talking swedish ) . 
  yeah , they already have one of the highest per capita-spendings on healthcare in the world ... 
  well , i 've read articles the last couple of years about people [ getting suspended ] ( http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/05/09/teen-suspended-for-refusing-to-recite-pledge-allegiance.html ) or [ having their grades lowered ] ( http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-grades-lowered-pledge-of-allegiance-20160916-snap-story.html ) for refusing to stand during said pledge ... 
  real putin or meme/satire version putin ? 
  not all that often , actually ... most of the time it 's solved in negotitations before the strike actually starts . 
  our unions more commonly affects in other ways though . 
  blockades against smaller companies to drive them out of business for not joining is fairly common , especially amongst caf\u00e9s . 
  getting people fired through similar means as well . 
  since swedish unions are absurdly powerful and have major influences in the government , most would rather avoid messing with them . 
  eh , it does n't matter ... finland will just go with the [ white death ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/simo_h%c3%a4yh%c3%a4 ) and win anyways . 
  he had over 500 confirmed sniper kills with non-scoped rifle in under 100 days . 
  in winter time , so only 4-5 hours of daylight per day . 
  was hit in the face with an explosive bullet , * killed the dude who shot him * and got about halfway back to camp before falling unconcious . 
  war ended the same day he woke up . 
  ca n't think of anyone we could send from sweden to counter that guy . 
  we have some amazing historical commanders and diplomats , but ca n't think of anyone who would fit in a battle royale . 
  some fictional character , maybe . 
  we do have a lot of crime fiction . 
  ** king adolf frederick ** died in 1771 :  after having consumed a meal consisting of lobster , caviar , sauerkraut , kippers and champagne , which was topped off with 14 servings of his favourite dessert : semla stuffed with almond paste and served in a bowl of hot cream . 
  [ semla on wikipedia for reference ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/semla ) . 
  ** the current swedish royal dynasty ** was founded in 1818 and is the only remaining dynasty to have been founded during the napoleonic era . 
  jean bernadotte ( later karl xiv johan ) was a general for napoleon when he was elected as heir-presumptive for karl xiii of sweden . 
  when asking napoleon for permission to go , napoleon supposedly asked bernadotte to swear to * never * go against french interests . 
  bernadotte refused , saying he could not be king of one country but loyal to another . 
  napoleon accepted his refusal , giving bernadotte his blessing . 
  in 1813 , great britain handed control over guadeloupe to karl xiii ( as personal property ) . 
  this was to compensate jean bernadotte ( now karl johan ) and his future heirs for any material loss incurred by sweden entering the anti-napoleon alliance . 
  after the war , guadeloupe was returned to france ( whom gb had taken it from first ) in exchange for 24 million franc . 
  the sum was used to pay off the entire swedish state debt , with the royal family instead recieving a yearly payment from the state until 1983 . 
  finally , ** the tl ; dr history of the swedish gold coast colony ** : - 1649 - swedish gold coast colony established . 
  - 1656 - seized by denmark , used as excuse for war . 
  - 1660 - returned after said war . 
  however , the swedish governor was revealed to have sold it to the dutch west india company ( while it was not in swedish hands ) and to have fled with the money to angola . 
  - 1660 - a group of natives lead an uprising against the dutch , then offered it back to sweden , who accepted control of the area . 
  - 1663 - denmark takes it again . 
  - 1664 - robert holmes takes it for the british gold coast . 
  i mean they * do * ask for more snow removal funds from the government because the weather `` took them by surprise '' every single year , so ... 
  100kusd = 900ksek so 75ksek/month . 
  according to [ this calculator ] ( http://www.skattebetalarna.se/kampanj/hur-mycket-betalar-du-i-skatt ) ( in swedish ) , you 'd get to keep 44ksek a month and it 'd cost the employer 98ksek . 
  ** 98,565 sek = total cost for employer ** -23,565 sek = employment fee ** 75,000 sek = monthly salary ** -23,727 sek = muncipality tax +1,456 sek = job tax deduction -8,702 sek = state income tax ** 44,027 sek = kept after taxes ** vat is 25 % on most stuff . 
  12 % on food , restaurants and hotels . 
  6 % on print media , public transport , museum/library fees and certain event fees . 
  well , apparently norway has some kind of banana-based sandwich spread called `` banos '' ... and for whatever reason they 've gone with manual labor rather than automatic . 
  since it 's difficult to get a job in sweden , difficult to find labor in norway and norweigian jobs pay really well while being adjacent to sweden , over 80000 swedes work in norway . 
  according to one article i found , the banana peeling job pays up to 12 euro an hour to sit on a chair for 8 hours , peeling away and listening to music over your headphones . 
  historically , a similar job was to gut fish ( both in norway and iceland ) . 
  regarding the difficulties of finding labor in norway , there was also some debate article a couple of years back where a norweigian youth argued that a lot of them refuse to get `` shit jobs '' since they feel they are entitled to slack off a bit and find a `` proper job '' when they are older , and since the state can afford it . 
  the parts of the debate that made it to sweden made it seem like this attitude is really common among norweigian youth , but i have no idea how true that is ... 
  i know the attitude * does * exist to some degree even here , and the norweigian society seems to make it easier to be like that . 
  well , it has been popular for swedish youth to go to norway and be banana peelers , which i guess would qualify . 
  never had it even once ... smelled it once ( was used in a school event specifically for it 's smell ) and a rival school tried to pour it into the ventilation of my school ( they poured it into the part that blows air out of the building though , so no one really noticed ) . 
  not true , [ swedish chefs ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy_yf4zz-yo ) are quite renowned internationally . 
  yeah , i play basically only support ( sometimes offlane ) ... warding everywhere does n't really help when your allies ignore vision and just dives into idiot situations all the time . 
  had someone pick jungle lc against a riki , then blame * me * because she kept dying to it while i put up a ton of observer/sentry wards and sent lots of map blinks and `` get back '' in chat every single time the riki approached her . 
  3,8k-ish ... broke 4k three different times , fell below after getting to around 4,2 k due to crappy teams ( seriously , who the hell plays high ground jungling necro ? ), 
  every time . 
  last one i had a massive losing streak before just going into unranked and now my extended break . 
  really ? 
  no gunde svan ? 
  they also had a severe butter shortage around christmas a couple of years ago . 
  naturally , we swedes were totally helpful and sympathetic and absolutely did * not * upload videos online of people melting and pouring away fresh butter to mock them . 
  as for your question , no idea how i 'd rank sweden . 
  slightly above norway due to ikea and abba , maybe ? 
  yes , though currently on an extended break since i 'm busy playing other games and they seem to have massively messed up the ui lately ...
