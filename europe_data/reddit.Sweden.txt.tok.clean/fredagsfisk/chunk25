  if you enjoy that type of game ( life is strange is one of my favorite games ever ) and have n't already , look into basically anything from telltale games after ... especially tales from the borderlands . 
  currently : europa universalis iv , minecraft and battlefield 1 ... so only swedish-developed games , actually . 
  waiting for dishonored 2 to come out in a couple of weeks , though . 
  might go for a mass effect trilogy replay before me : a comes out next year . 
  can confirm i know about at least one town like that ... [ dansband ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dansband ) and old rock dominates the music , of course . 
  homophobia is quite common . 
  racism also does exist , but not as much in later years . 
  ... and almost all of them are social democrats , communists or nationalists . 
  swedish politics were utterly dominated by socialism during the entire 1900s , with many people still voting left simply because their parents , grandparents and great-grandparents did . 
  this is especially true in the `` redneck '' - y parts . 
  as such , they would be conservative if going by the wiki definition of conservatism :  conservatism as a political and social philosophy promotes retaining traditional social institutions in the context of culture and civilization . 
  some conservatives seek to preserve things as they are , emphasizing stability and continuity however , the actual conservative parties here in sweden are right-wing ( compared to the socialists ) . 
  the anti-immigration ** sweden democrats ** * did * gain a lot of traction , but their growth has at least slowed down since other parties started to become less immigration friendly . 
  sd is currently the third largest party with around 15-20 % in most polls . 
  the ** right wing ** was very pro-immigration before last election ( while they were in government ) , but most leaders were replaced with more critical ones after they lost , and now they are more for balanced politics in that regard . 
  the new ** socialdemocratic/green government ** ( current ) kept it up , refusing to give up their `` open borders '' policy until the situation was a complete mess ( refugees sleeping in the immigration agency lobby ) and they had to act in total panic . 
  the ** green party ** leader cried during the speech they announced it , and they publically denounce their own politics any chance they get . 
  many of their members want a return to the `` open borders '' policy , with many even supporting the idea to send military airplanes down to warzones to ship refugees back to sweden . 
  the ** immigration agency ** frequently reporting that it needs more money and that the situation was getting worse by the day caused a shift in public opinion towards being less refugee-friendly . 
  the actions of the ** police and media ** are most likely behind a lot of the sweden democrat 's growth , as many people have become less trusting of the more `` traditional '' entities due to their biased actions . 
  police covering up immigrant-related crime `` so the police wo n't appear racist '' , for example . 
  ** mainstream media ** in general is very pro-immigration , but public tv/radio ( which is supposed to be politically unbound ) has angered a lot of people by outright denying obvious issues and attempting to skew the debate ... around 80 % of those working in public tv/radio are leftists , who are also the most pro-refugee parties . 
  further , the ** green party ** has suffered from a massive loss of support ( while the sweden democrats grew ) after the april 2016 scandals , during which the greens had to fire multiple high-ranking members ( including a minister ) for having ties to facist and islamic extremism . 
  as the green party is the most pro-refugee , this did not help public opinion on the matter . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/green_party_ ( sweden ) #criticism ** tl ; dr ** generally positive attitude about it , but slowly growing less so as more negative effects are becoming apparent and the government , police and media desperately are trying to keep the debate quiet or biased . 
  i should also add that some of the sweden democrat growth is from * all * other established parties refusing to work with them . 
  there is quite a bit of support for cooperation within some right wing parties , but their leaders still refuse . 
  also , the left wing even * change their politics * and break election promises solely to spite the sweden democrats or avoid getting indirect support from them ... 
  the cola-brand julmust is named after a place in sweden , with the cola logo being basically hidden ... it 's generally not one of those brands mentioned when people talk about julmust . 
  the extract used by every single brand of julmust is made by the same place though , including theirs . 
   who try to portray him as some kind of monster because he acted the way everyone acted in the 15th century . . 
  i see what you 're saying , but columbus is probably not the best example for this ... he was * extremely * brutal even by the standards of the era he lived in , to the point where even his friends and relatives testified against him as he was thrown in jail ( for a few months ) and stripped of his governorship . 
  even in the 1500s , * most * people did n't really take kindly to parading dismembered bodies through the streets , torturing and mutilating people for minor crimes ( or just saying the wrong things ) , mass genocides for literally no reason , organised sexual slavery of minors and such things . 
  ** immigration ** is the biggest right now , obviously ... it has slowed down a lot , but there are still loads of issues and costs . 
  ** the national police chief ** is massively incompetent and basically only got his position because he hates the nationalist party . 
  do n't think anyone other than the government want him to remain on his post . 
  the police are unable to do their job properly because of him , stuff is getting covered up , he 's illegally taking sides politically ( publically declaring support for one side , basically ) and lots of other stuff . 
  ** the `` feminist foreign policy '' of our government ** has been debated quite a bit lately . 
  it started with our foreign minister wallstr\u00f6m pissing off israel * and * every single arab country within a couple of months of getting that position . 
  she was praised online for saying the saudi are medieval and uncivilized , while the government sent * another * minister to apologize , with a little help from the swedish king and his connections ... she 's also not allowed to enter israel * at all * , partially because of her antisemitism . 
  the most recent development in this was our prime minister l\u00f6fven visiting saudi arabia a couple of days ago . 
  there was a lot of criticism against this , since : - he invited a dude who is basically an arms dealer to come along , setting that kind of tone for the visit . 
  - he refused to call saudi arabia a dictatorship . 
  - people expected him to raise the issue of women 's right in saudi , but he only commented that saudi women face certain issues `` just like back home '' . 
  there 's also plenty of other issues regarding this governments foreign politics ( along with some russia-related issues and an unhealthy un obsession ) , but those are some of the highlights . 
  ** russia ** and their movements around the baltic is causing some worries . 
  for example , the defense minister protested openly against plans to let gazprom rent harbours on gotland ( which is currently being re-militarized ) . 
  ** and of course mona sahlin ** , former social democratic party leader , is spoken about quite a bit since she is going through one of her regular cycles . 
  generally , she makes a comeback to politics every 5-10 years or so , whenever people have started forgetting about her latest scandals . 
  not really a political issue , perhaps ... but a bit of a `` tradition '' by now , i guess . 
  if you want some more detailed info on any of that , i can try to answer . 
  churchill also caused the deaths of millions in places like india and was a huge racist , which does n't exactly scream `` international cooperation '' or exemplifies what the eu wants to stand for either . 
  that 's just a kebab pizza with some fries haphazardly thrown on , meh . 
  you want a viking special - an `` inbakad '' ( folded over , like a calzone ) kebabpizza that 's basically a bread bag filled with kebab meat , cheese and sauces + served with a large stack of fries . 
  they also make swedish julmust ( a christmas softdrink ) , as a response to coca cola sales dropping by 50 % during december ... massive ad campaigns did nothing , so they started making their own . 
  also more fun to say , but that might just be me . 
  swedish nationalists ( sweden democrats ) are often cited as far-right , but can tbh be seen as either , depending on who you ask or what you look at . 
  they have aspects of both . 
  sweden * did * have a socialization movement in the 70s-80s ( meant to have the state seize companies and put them under union ownership ) . 
  it was stopped through the efforts of certain groups and individuals . 
  while swedish unions are still absurdly powerful and some of them ( together with certain social democratic ministers ) are lobbying to restart this movement now , sweden has generally moved far away from that . 
  well , we officially declared neutrality early on , but we often made concessions to both sides to keep that neutrality . 
  we also maintained trade with both the axis and the allies , even using blockade runners ( since both england and germany used blockades ) . 
  to protect our interests we also cooperated with finland , assisting them in mine laying around \u00c5land and sending military aid ( including volunteers , weapons , ammo , etc ) to fight soviet , rather than getting involved directly . 
  other than that , germany also had * plans * for invading sweden , should they stop selling iron ore ( which was * very * important for their industry ) and allowing axis use of swedish railways . 
  the allies attempted a plan to seize swedish iron mines and norweigian harbors , but failed ( since sweden/norway refused to go along with it ) . 
  this was followed directly by the german invasion of norway . 
  we also allowed large amounts of jews and other refugees entry to sweden , with for example denmark putting up a defense long enough to evacuate their jews here when germany invaded . 
  by 1943 , the allies were demanding more and more from sweden in regards to hindering german movement and trade . 
  sweden was forced to accept some of it , but kept smuggling trade goods to germany to avoid a potential invasion . 
  essentially , there was a * ton * of breaches of the `` neutrality '' , but most of it was in favor of keeping the war from our soil and countering the threats of germany and soviet . 
  apart from the left wing sometimes calling the sweden democrats `` nazis '' and the state of our neutrality during ww2 sometimes being brought up as a comparison to a more contemporary situation ( like working with nato or sending peacekeeping troops for the un ) ... never , really . 
  eh , [ if it works it works ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-32703331 ) . 
  strikes are rare here as well , but the unions use other means instead . 
  for example , there were several cases of them using blockades to drive caf\u00e9s / bakeries bankrupt over the past 1-2 year ( s ) . 
  they would stand outside and tell people not to enter or shop there , pressure delivery companies into stopping food deliveries to the blockaded places so they could not produce bread , pastries and such ... 
  in at least two cases these were caf\u00e9s / bakeries with a single employee , which could not afford the union fees but still paid a comparable salary and benefits that the employee was happy with . 
  the unions harassed them until they joined , after which the place went bankrupt and/or had to fire said employee . 
  at least one caf\u00e9 was a member of one union , but was put in a blockade by * another * union ( under the same umbrella organisation ) for not living up to their standards . 
  they also went bankrupt . 
  the unions are also the ones deciding if immigrant workers are allowed to stay , often getting people sent home after * years * of working in sweden , despite having a family here and having learned the language and everything ... for stuff like getting paid 50 euro too little over a 6 month period . 
  even if it 's the employer 's fault ( or the unions just randomly changed the rules without telling anyone ) and the employer offers to pay the difference to get to keep their employee . 
  apart from that , they used to automatically sign their members up as members of the social democrats , but stopped in the 90s . 
  now they `` just '' pay billions of sek and recruit 1000s of volunteers each election to keep them in power , so they wo n't lose their influence . 
  a huge chunk of the socialdemocratic leadership are also high ranking union members ( the current prime minister being a former union leader ) . 
  there 's also a group ( including several ministers ) lobbying to bring back the socialisation movement of the 70s-80s , which would allow the state to seize private companies and hand them over to the unions , to `` let the workers own the means of production '' . 
  as you might notice , i could go on for * ages * about this topic , but ** tl ; dr ** , our unions are insanely powerful and corrupt , has a vast arsenal of weapons to keep their influence and probably are not really comparable to unions in other countries . 
   those unions sound ridiculous , not sure why anyone would care what they think . 
  because swedish unions are absurdly powerful and have been known to drive businesses bankrupt or get people fired for not joining or doing as told , with no legal repercussions . 
  interestingly , the union for restaurants allow mcdonalds and other places to be open way later than the one the grocery stores are members of ... 
  nah , would not be enough to convince the unions ... and they would probably focus on something else to stop it , like saying it 's bad for the workers to be awake so late . 
  they also said that stores and such are only allowed to be open past midnight if there is an interest from society . 
  the store had 1000s of signatures and dozens of job applicants ( it 's located right in the middle of a student housing area , so tons of ppl studying at night that might need a snack or whatever ) , but that was apparently not enough . 
  to be fair , he only said you * can * put it on it . . not that it 'd be adviseable or non-terrible . 
  i think it 's more `` it might happen and then our union members might get hurt '' than `` it has happened a lot '' , to be honest . 
  * some * showers do , at least older ones ... friend of the family used to live there , had a shower with different taps . 
  took * ages * to get a decent temperature . 
  well , it 's a safety thing , partially ... if the bus has no cash , there 's little reason to rob it . 
  think the unions are behind it ... they also stopped a store in my city from being open 24/7 for safety reasons , saying robberies are common after midnight and the employees would be unsafe . 
  my dad ordered a regular black coffee at a caf\u00e9 in stockholm a few years back ... the dude working there was super happy and called his collegue over , saying it was the first time in * ages * they had someone order a regular coffee instead of some caramel latte or whatever .
