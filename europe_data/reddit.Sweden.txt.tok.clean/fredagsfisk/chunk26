  was just when that flavoring syrup thing had a peak in popularity , i think . 
   also , i 've never had a good cup of black coffee outside of the nordics . 
  i think it 's made stronger here ? 
  i do n't really drink coffee much myself ( espresso or cappucino sometimes ) , but i remember my parents had powder coffee with them at all times when we were in the us when i was a kid , specifically because the `` regular black coffee '' there was so watery that even the not-so-good taste of powder coffee was better . 
  sometimes joked about as `` sweden 's largest contribution to modern philosophy '' . 
  i mean it * is * uppsala ... why would you be surprised about * anything * ? 
  they 're both in uppsala , it 's just that i pass the chimney way more often so i ca n't forget about it . 
  both are absolutely terrible and should be removed , though . 
  arsenalen is awesome , though i 've only been there on opening day ( also the first and only time i 've seen the swedish king in person , i think ) a few years back . 
  hmm ... but you * are * led by an immortal queen who will one day oversee the rise of the neo-british empire ? 
  most of my favorite beer ( including my [ absolute favorite ] ( https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/149/612/ ) ) is belgian , so there 's that . 
  then again , i 'm just a random ~ ~ swede ~ ~ gay german on the internet . 
  ... and if anyone complains , just go with the classic `` it 's to get people talking , and * obviously * it 's working , since you 're talking about it '' . 
  not the best design , but sounds pretty cool though :  every day at 11:00 it releases a glass marble , which the spectators can catch from one of four openings in the monument and they can take it with them as a souvenir . 
  my home city , on the other hand , recently spent 1,55 million sek ( 1 million in tax money , 550k from local businesses ) on erecting a [ 19 meter high chimney ] ( http://www.svt.se/cachable_image/1435344561/svts/article3059161.svt/alternates/large/skorsten-jpg ) . 
  `` art '' , apparently . 
  it 's literally [ just a fucking chimney ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/tegn%c3%a9rparken.jpg ) . 
  they could * at least * have put a freaking brick bbq thingy at the bottom for people to use during summer , but noooo . 
  it 's not even the `` artists '' first chimney . 
  it 's the * 10th * , each being 1 meter taller than the one before ( and the others being placed in various locations in sweden , korea , finland and germany ) , which apparently gives it `` an international appeal '' or some shit like that . 
  some regions in sweden has a system where you pay a monthly fee ( determined by your previous dental health , if you smoke or not , etc but generally fairly low ) that then covers any checkups and non-cosmetic fixes you may need ... like teeth repair , fillings , etc. 
  works great , though i do n't really need a lot of dental work , but my dad has saved a * ton * since he needs to replace a lot of old fillings and stuff . 
  pretty sure i use english more than swedish at the moment , actually ... 
  i have non-swedish friends i speak to a lot online , i work in english 90 % of the time , my writing is in english and most games and sites i visit are in english . 
  of course , then comes a week/weekend where i 'm more `` locally social '' and people laugh at me for forgetting what stuff is called in swedish and going with some weird swenglish blend instead . 
  whoops . 
  for the period they are asylum seekers , yeah ... but not after that , from what i understand ? 
  also , there has been plenty of articles about schools having problems adjusting because a large amount of immigrants were just dumped into their school with no information , which may cause long term problems ( which is more what i was talking about ) . 
  what the migrationsverket budget is split between is specified here , if you want to check : http://www.regeringen.se/artiklar/2015/09/statens-budget-2016-i-siffror-utgiftsomrade-8-migration/ if you want more specification on the `` ers\u00e4ttningar och bostadskostnader '' post , just ctrl + f and search for it on this : http://www.esv.se/statsliggaren/regleringsbrev/?rbid=16910 both links in swedish . 
  according to your numbers , those refugees would cost a grand total of slightly under 2 billion euro a year . 
  that 's less than the * increase * in budget demanded by the immigration agency for 2016 . 
  for reference , the immigration section of the 2016 budget ( even counting the lowered budget for september ) was somewhat higher than that of the entire judicary ( police , s\u00c4po , courts , prosecution , etc ) . 
   migration 43\u00a0862\u00a0888\u00a0000 sek  judicary 42\u00a0279\u00a0707\u00a0000 sek that 's not counting the fact that our school , hospital and other such systems are not designed for such a sudden influx and thus have increased costs due to it . 
  or the fact that we have a * severe * housing crisis in sweden from * before * . 
   that means that a wooping 1,62 % of the people in sweden were not swedish or did n't come there as economic migrant you mean the population in sweden * increased * by 1,62 % from immigration in 2015 . 
  the amount of foreign born * total * in sweden is much higher . 
  around 15 % if i remember correctly , though that also counts non-refugees of course . 
   winston churchill i would say absolutely * not * good , for any number of reasons . 
  for example [ the bengal famine of 1943 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bengal_famine_of_1943 ) . 
   the british government denied an urgent request from leopold amery , the indian secretary of state , and archibald wavell , the viceroy of india , to stop exports of food from bengal in order that it might be used for famine relief . 
  ** winston churchill , then prime minister , dismissed these requests in a fashion that amery regarded as `` hitler-like , '' by asking why , if the famine was so horrible , gandhi had not yet died of starvation . 
  ** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/india_in_world_war_ii, 
  hmm , difficult ... if we 're going with now-living famous people only and not counting murderers and other such criminals , then maybe mona sahlin ? 
  her entire political career is just an endless cycle of corruption , lawbreaking and `` comebacks '' to higher positions . 
  she 's currently under police investigation for multiple counts of falsifying information for one of her employees so he could buy a luxury apartment and car . 
  in the past , there 's also : - hiring people without paying taxes . 
  - not paying the public service fee . 
  - getting 98 parking tickets ( in * two * cars that were both illegal to drive ) and thus being the first riksdag member to get her own parking spot ( because they did n't wan na keep paying her tickets ) . 
  - the toblerone scandal , when she had used her state debit card repeatedly for 5-6 years ( despite just as repeatedly being told * not * to ) to buy goods with a total value of over 50000sek ( 5k euro ) , including some toblerone . 
  claimed she had accidentally used the wrong card when media dug it up . 
  - drove her company bankrupt in less than a year by taking out massive salaries . 
  - selectively ignoring certain stuff while she was the leader of the social democrats , like defending the extremely antisemitic reepalu ( then local socialdemocratic leader in malm\u00f6 city ) up until * obama * sent an emissary to look at the situation . 
  etc currently , i think the only job she has is managing the anna lindh memorial fund ( lindh being a friend and member of the same party as sahlin who was murdered a few years back ) ... which has lost millions of sek under her leadership ( but to be fair , the two guys managing it before her did n't do much better ) . 
  good list , though i would also add folke bernadotte under diplomats . 
  also , regarding linnaeus , just because i like the nicknames ( i mean c'mon , at least the last one is pretty badass ) :  among other compliments , linnaeus has been called princeps botanicorum ( prince of botanists ) , `` the pliny of the north , '' and `` the second adam '' . 
  i 'd say another layer of difficulty in determining the state of nationalism in sweden is that everyone has different interpretations of what nationalism is . 
  i would n't really say that ... it 's more balancing on around the same level , lately . 
  the most nationalist party ( sweden democrats ) did grow for quite a while , but seem to be at around the same % in the last few polls ( and most people voting for them are not really nationalist , but protesting the more traditional parties ) . 
  so i would say it * did * grow , but has reached it 's peak for now . 
  however , it may start growing again if nothing is done about many of the problems that we 've been having lately , which at least the current government is kinda failing with . 
  i saw a couple of people who seemed totally serious ( had done calcs for economy comparisons to other city-states and stuff too ) but yeah as as i said , tiny group at most and i do n't think they could ever get more than a handful serious followers . 
  well there * was * a tiny group that wanted london to become an independent city-state right after the referendum ... 
  combine the two by using swedish engineering to create mecha-bears ( delivered in flatpacks ) ? 
  from what i 've read about it , support is much higher in sweden ( yet still rather low ) than in other nordic countries , since our higher population and central geographic location would most likely give us the most power im such a union . 
  well apparently we are leaking money ( 2,5 million sek a day or so ) from long-term contracts for third party refugee housing having been signed qhen it was at it 's worst , so we need * something * to fill those with !, 
   finns will take care of the education and natural philosophy and fight the wars . 
  mechanized hakkapeliitta ? 
  by odin , we 'd be unstoppable !, 
  yeah i think stockholm has somewhat lighter rules at least in certain areas . 
  the main downside i think is that we have a housing shortage in sweden , most wan na live centrally in larger cities but you can mostly only expand said cities horizontally . 
  actually , it 's lower than that . 
  buildings in the city center are not allowed to reach higher than the base of the castle . 
  in general , swedish cities have very strict rules regarding building height , and uppsala wants to keep the cathedral and castle as the dominant features of the skyline . 
  uppsala , sweden ... the 119 meter high cathedral towers . 
  well there 's also the mostly-joking `` gr\u00e4v bort sk\u00e5ne '' ( dig sk\u00e5ne away ) which i guess is an inversion of seperatist ? 
  as in a group that goes down to the sk\u00e5ne border and has a camping trip and digs away a bit of the border once every year ( though they stopped a few years ago , i think ) . 
  if my dad is grilling them : mayo , salad , dressing , tomato , ketchup , burger , cheese , bacon , mustard , raw onion , more mayo - in that order . 
  at home , i sometimes use mozzarella , grilled zucchini slices or mushrooms , skip the dressing and go with dijon mustard instead of regular . 
   stupidest is probably trying to invade russia during the coldest winter of the past 500 years . 
  but that was a while back . 
  * to be fair * , i do n't think anyone expected the winter to last into * june * , and it was only a minor part of why we lost . 
  what led up to the loss at the battle of poltava was a long series of problems and coincidences , including ( but not limited to ) : - the slaughter of our cossack allies ( rebelling against tsar peter ) before they could meet up . 
  - polish uprisings forcing charles to leave men behind in poland . 
  - severely delayed reinforcements from courland . 
  - scorched earth tactics . 
  - charles being injured in non-combat ( leaving rehnski\u00f6ld to lead at poltava ) . 
  - severe delays for the * second * wave of reinforcements ( had to deal with a polish confederation ) . 
  - schlippenbach fucking up the element of surprise . 
  - bad communication between the swedish military commanders during the battle of poltava . 
  still , considering the russians had 2-4x more troops during almost every single battle of the campaign and sweden only lost once before poltava , it 's pretty impressive . 
  the bigger mistake would probably be to get back to sweden and instantly decide to attack norway , while everyone back home was tired or war and charles had been away for * years * . 
  or on international waters : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/women_on_waves, 
  according to wikipedia ( citing an audiotape ) , bin laden specifically * opposed * socialism :  in his messages , bin laden has opposed `` pan-arabism , socialism , communism , democracy and other doctrines , '' with the exception of islam . 
  is there any other source for that being wrong ? 
  major ? 
  nah , not really . 
  there might be some negative effect , though , depending on how he acts . 
  we currently have a socialdemocratic/green government , and the left here tends to dislike republicans in general . 
  the prime minister has also commented negatively on trump , while both the left and right wing have been very positive about obama . 
  i think possibly we might be a bit more cautious in our dealings with him , but not really change anything ?
