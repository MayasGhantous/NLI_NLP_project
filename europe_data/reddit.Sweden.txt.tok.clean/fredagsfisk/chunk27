  unless he acts in a way that is directly against the interests of our current gov , that is . 
  well let 's just say if it had been in nils holgersson , i 'm pretty sure less children would be allowed to read it . 
  dang , prince oscar looks [ pretty damn offended ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/crown_princess_victoria_2016_10.jpg ) in his picture . 
  had an acquaintance that got a thai massage and was offered the `` happy ending special '' for like 300sek extra . 
  he turned it down , commenting that even if he * had * wanted it his girlfriend ( who was paying , as a gift ) would probably be a bit suspicious about the `` 300sek special '' on the reciept ... 
  to build a house , if nothing else . 
  you do n't hear the white death until it 's too late . 
  * fermented * fish !, 
  besides , iceland does it too , and it 's supposedly much worse : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/h%c3%a1karl, 
  well all kinds of eating , really ... both in florida and nyc . 
  hell , hard rock caf\u00e9 by times square was cheaper than equal amounts of food and drinks at many places here . 
  $ 20 = 170sek checking the fairly cheap burger restaurant me and my friend usually goes to when eating out ... 109sek for cheapest burger , 120-150sek for the middle ones . 
  you get a small stack of fries with that , though . 
  cheapest beer 49sek ( on tap ) . 
  most cost 60-80sek . 
  so yeah ... $ 18.6 for the cheapest , easily reaching towards $ 25 if you want some better beer and more than the basic burger . 
  no tipping , though . 
  there are * some * cheaper options , but most are more expensive than that . 
  the `` texas longhorn steakhouse '' in town will easily cost at least 30 dollars for a burger and something to drink . 
  i normally count on spending * at least * over 200sek ( $ 23.5 ) if eating out for dinner . 
  lunch is cheaper , around 100sek + drinks maybe ( so $ 15 ) . 
  i * do * kinda wonder why we have a holiday song that was originally written to mock the french when our royal dynasty is also imported from france ( and distanced himself from it after napoleon did some shit ) ... 
  it 's an honorary title the bishop can give priests here in sweden . 
  they have the * best * jalape\u00f1o cheese nacho dip . 
  always got ta go to ica and buy some when having nachos . 
  where have you eaten in the us ? 
  it 's always been * waaaay * cheaper when me and my family has eaten there than it is back home in sweden . 
  hey , both the [ beer i probably drink the most ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hoegaarden_brewery ) and my [ favorite beer ever that 's not available here in sweden ] ( https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/149/612/ ) are belgian !, 
  how is peroni seen in italy ? 
  i love the nastro azzurro , it 's like drinking liquid buttered bread ... mm ... 
  here in sweden we have afrosvenskarnas riksf\u00f6rbund , `` the national association of afro-swedes '' , for `` people in sweden with background in africa '' . 
  granted , they ( and their `` allies '' ) are the only ones i know of that actually uses the term `` afro-swedes '' . 
  living in 4th biggest city in sweden , a university city . 
  personally i bought my 26 sq.meter apartment for 1 million sek ( 117k usd ) like ... 6-7 years ago , i think ? 
  monthly fees are around 1800sek and includes water , tv , 100mbit internet and maintenance stuff . 
  electricity is not included . 
  there 's also interest and mortgage on the housing loan . 
  apartments of similar size ( 25-30 sq. 
  meters ) have sold for 1.6-1 .8 million sek ( 190k-210k usd ) in the last year or so . 
  many apartments also have higher monthly fees ( i live in a quite decent [ housing cooperative ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/housing_cooperative#sweden ) ) . 
  it should be noted that i live in the area of sweden that had the highest rise in housing prices in the last 5 years or so , though . 
  renting a one room apartment ( or student room ) in this city is nearly impossible , as there are far too many students compared to the amount of housing ( a problem in most swedish university towns/cities ) . 
  the monthly cost for those would range between 3500sek and 5000sek , though . 
  eh , just do like those in north sweden . 
  communicate by a series of noises made by sharply sucking in air . 
  man , just do it [ the ninja way ] ( https://g.redditmedia.com/ofega3bonbptb1nnmrzhr_n9e1l7sp3usnrvzfmtwjm.gif?w=720&amp;fm=mp4&amp;mp4-fragmented=false&amp;s=b43960863c1c394d8914c515df3a4d94 ) . 
  a swedish union did a comparison between usa and sweden some years back ... even after all the healthcare insurances and stuff you 'd have more money left to spend ( on cheaper stuff ) at the end of the month . 
  think it 's mostly more local bad rep than nationwide . 
  eskilstuna for example had a reputation in some s\u00f6dermanland towns as a criminal shithole . 
  the municipality i grew up in had a smaller town with a lot of `` swedish rednecks '' ( heavily drinking homophobic racists with a love for motorsports ) . 
  as for malm\u00f6 , i 'd say it is nationally known as a violent-crime-and-arson-ville populated by anti semites . 
  oh , i definitely agree , but i have seen lots of people say that only applies to south germany and how berlin is an exception . 
  except in england , where you 're allowed to drink wine/beer at 16 + if at a licensed premise if accompanied by an adult and together with a meal ... or at home , if given to you by parents and you 're above the age of * five * . 
  i actually learned that first looking it up after seeing an episode of wife swap where one family let their daughter and her friends have [ alcopop ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alcopop ) `` as long as it 's not too much '' . 
  overseas colonies ? 
  we had so few for such a short time , it 's not really worth thinking about . 
  i did just read a bit about the swedish gold coast that i found intereresting , though : 1649 - swedish gold coast colony established . 
  1656 - seized by denmark , used as excuse for war . 
  1660 - returned after said war . 
  however , the swedish governor was revealed to have * sold it * to the dutch west india company and to have fled with the money to angola . 
  1660 - a group of natives lead an uprising against the dutch , then offered it back to sweden , who accepted control of the area . 
  1663 - denmark takes it again . 
  1664 - robert holmes takes it for the british gold coast . 
   try, 
  well , the theory for how it 'd happen ( because obviously there are theories ) is that russia would blitz gotland in a surprise attack launched from kaliningrad , if i remember correctly , then promise not to do anything else as the world condemns and threatens them a little . 
  once stuff dies down , they simply keep gotland as sweden ca n't force them to give it back and no one really wants a big war on their hands . 
  while kaliningrad has some strategic value as a forward base , gotland is possibly * the * most valueable strategic point in the baltic region . 
  being an island , it 'd be easy to fortify to be difficult to assault . 
  it 's location puts it right in the middle of shipping routes , making it perfect for raids on ships going to/from finland , sweden and the baltic states in a hypothetical war scenario . 
  it also has an airport that could be expanded for military use , allowing far quicker air raids on the nordic countries than going from kaliningrad . 
  as i said , though ... not very likely that an invasion will happen . 
  out of the 15-20 or so european countries i 've been to , i think maybe germany ? 
  only been to berlin and potsdam there , but all the people i met were really friendly and social . 
  people in nordic countries tend to seem very cold to outsiders , and you generally do n't talk to strangers here ( or sit next to them on the bus , or stand too close to them while waiting for said bus , etc ) without them looking at you like you 're insane . 
   a warm spiced wine ( i forget the name ) most likely gl\u00f6gg ( similar to english `` mulled wine '' or german `` gl\u00fchwein i think ? 
  for reference ), 
  most stick to beer , cider and wine i guess . 
  it really depends on the bar and the person . 
  personally i feel that spirits and drinks are often too expensive , but i 'll drink them sometimes . 
   you need to be 20 years old to buy anything too . 
  the age limit in bars and for weaker beer/cider ( up to 3,5 % alcohol , sold in regular stores ) is 18 , though . 
  bilberries grow on small plants and are native to europe , while blueberries grow on large bushes and are native to north america , from my understanding . 
  i * think * we just say `` bl\u00e5b\u00e4r '' about both here . 
  yeah , the big ones growing on bushes are native to north america while bilberries are native to europe , from what i understand . 
  fun fact : what you call `` blueberries '' may actually be `` bilberries '' in english . 
  would paste the wiki links , but my phones copy-paste functions hate me . 
  `` they tuuk our shruums ! '', 
   then again , for anime i actually prefer the english dub over japanese as i can actually understand english . 
  it 's very different from anime to anime , in my opinion . 
  like haruhi suzumiya , ouran , soul eater , etc are great in the dub . 
  clannad is pretty good , but loses emotion in some scenes . 
  * some * dubs make great anime absolutely unwatchable . 
  then there 's [ ghost stories ] ( https://myanimelist.net/anime/1281/gakkou_no_kaidan ) , the horror anime that was so horribly bad that they dubbed it as a [ self-aware comedy ] ( https://67.media.tumblr.com/fe83bf2f945b9c7db7550af1bb70bcb0/tumblr_miux7aysxj1qdgpu0o1_500.png ) that is [ absolutely hilarious ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g86r7rvlow4 ) , but still using [ professional voice actors ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tigp8bqdt1s ) . 
  ha , had a classmate with american parents . 
  really * did * try speaking swedish , but it sounded more like danish ( the whole `` mouth full of porridge '' thingy ) at times . 
  most people just asked them to switch to english after a while . 
  i see eesti trying to work his way into nordic . 
  germany sweating at the end is a nice touch . 
  ** most likely : ** some minor changes in the northern borders and/or sea levels . 
  ** less likely : ** finland lets \u00c5land become a part of sweden .
