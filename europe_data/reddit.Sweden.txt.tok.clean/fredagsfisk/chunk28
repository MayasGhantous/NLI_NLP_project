  ** even less likely : ** russia invades gotland , since it has a strategic importance for the entire baltic region and is virtually undefended and sweden not in nato . 
  ** least likely : ** the swedish empire rises again , re-conquering finland , the baltic states and pieces of northern germany before focusing on getting the rest of the coast . 
  germany . 
  berlin , to be more exact . 
  i had heard a lot about how germany is boring and how everyone is rude in berlin , but found the city awesome and the people friendly and social . 
  / r/shitamericanssay gets quite a few posts about how each state is like a country , the us is way more diverse than all of europe , etc. 
  often with some incredibly flimsy explaination . 
   danes ca n't speak properly . 
  insert classic https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-moy8vuebk, 
  ha , had totally forgotten fjards is a thing . 
  fjords are norway . 
  they 've got mountains and stuff too . 
  sweden has more forests and lakes ( though some mountains up north ) . 
  hey , i love the us . 
  been there half a dozen times , mostly in the orlando area . 
  everything is huge and cheap , the people are mostly friendly ( if a bit loud ) , you guys * really * know how to build themeparks and there 's loads of great media from the us . 
   so help me learn what you want to hear however ... 
  i 'd like for us people to just * stop * going on about the damn `` rape capital '' bullshit ( based on bad understanding of statistics ) every single time sweden is mentioned online . 
  mention our beautiful nature , nice old buildings or whatever instead . 
  anything . 
  according to interviews , it seems their income ( and the amount of ppl willing to give ) has dropped quite a lot lately . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/feminist_initiative_ ( sweden ) they get about 2-3 % of the votes at most in the national elections , with the threshold to get into the riksdag being 4 % . 
  they are led by gudrun schyman , who was the leader of the left party ( formerly `` left party communists '' ) until she quit due to alcoholism and later founded this party . 
  the feminist party is almost further left than the left party , though . 
  they do `` fun '' stuff like  in july 2010 , the party burned 100,000 swedish kronor ( $ 13,000 ; # 8,500 ) in a protest against unequal pay . 
  [ 30 ] fi wanted to draw attention to its proposal for a government fund for equal pay . 
  well , the left party , feminist party and green party also wan na lower voting age to 16 `` for democracy 's sake '' ... coincidentally , they are the ones that would gain the most votes from that . 
  hrm . 
  there was a suggestion here from v\u00e4nsterpartiet to allow * asylum seekers * to vote in national elections ... probably the dumbest political suggestion in a long time . 
  i also mentioned in said thread that the problem is a lack of resources and proper leadership . 
  with those things fixed , the police should be perfectly able to deal with a begging ban and many things they have been forced to cut back on . 
  not to mention security guards could then be given the authority to deal with many problems arising from beggars that they currently can not deal with . 
  i would also point out that the fact that you compare it to `` taking care of drunks , harassing pot-heads and chasing kids with tuned mopeds '' shows a * complete and utter * lack of understanding of the reasons behind a beggar ban and of the situation at large . 
  we are talking about organised crime , gang fights and in many cases human trafficking here . 
  * that 's * why there needs to be a ban . 
  it 's a fairly large and important issue . 
  well the main problem here is that 99 % of the beggars come from other eu countries that * have * been given money by the eu to deal with the problems and either are not using them or the beggars ignore the help at home and go here instead . 
  that 's why many people here wants to ban it as well , but media and the left wing refuses to acknowledge that it 's organized , saying that 's rumors based on superstition and racism . 
  which makes it all the more ironic when the same media does one article about how it 's * not * organized and not one week later does another about fights between organized beggar gangs ... hrm . 
  apparently the lower courts wanted to convict him because it was at a public party ( if it had been private , it 'd be fine ) , but the higher one said it was obvious from the context that no harm was meant . 
  i do n't think that crime in general * has * increased much in that time period . 
  reported crime has , but generally that 's attributed to people being more willing to report ( and in some cases , changes to legislation ) . 
  as i said , though , the main problem is absolutely * horrible * leadership . 
  the national chief is useless and the organisation is in shambles because the leaders dunno what they 're doing . 
  replacing the leading positions with people who actually have experience with police work should do wonders . 
  add a harassment charge , maybe ? 
  not sure if you 'd actually get convicted , though . 
  there was a guy who was dragged to court for dressing up as a nazi for halloween ( some girl drew a purple hitler mustache on him sometime during the night ) , convicted in the lower courts and freed in the higher ones , iirc . 
  several parties here ( mainly the right wing ) wants to ban begging in the streets , but the left wing keeps yelling `` you ca n't ban being poor ! '', 
  and refusing to discuss those suggestions ... 
  eh , someone would prolly call the police and try to get ya convincted of `` hets mot folkgrupp '' or something . 
  depends on how seriously you look like you 're doing it i guess . 
  huh , looking it up i learned sweden has the oldest national parks in europe , from 1909 . 
  as sarek and stora sj\u00f6fallet have already been mentioned , i 'll add some others ... [ skuleskogen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/skuleskogen_national_park ) has lynx , moose , martens , beavers , seals , muskrats , brown bear , badgers and other mammals , along with a whole bunch of birds . 
  there are stone/bronze age sites and some other cool stuff . 
  [ bl\u00e5 jungfrun ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bl%c3%a5_jungfrun ) is a small island with some ice age stuff and a `` cursed '' stone labyrinth . 
  folklore says witches gathered there . 
  [ f\u00e4rnebofj\u00e4rden ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/f%c3%a4rnebofj%c3%a4rden_national_park ) is large , relatively near stockholm and has a large variety of forest types , several types of mammals and over 200 types of birds . 
  [ muddus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/muddus_national_park ) has a cool waterfall and the oldest pine tree in sweden . 
  been to orlando 5 times and nyc once ... in general , stuff is way cheaper than here . 
  * everything * is larger ( my dad even checked the grass thickness , ha ) . 
  the themeparks are awesome , kennedy space center as well . 
  nyc was cool , but started to feel trapped after a while due to the massive buildings . 
  the people are loud but generally very friendly . 
  experienced some racism down in florida ( yes , i 'm white ) , but only a couple of times . 
  americans in general are * extremely * chatty when you come from a country where you 'd be seen as borderline insane for talking to a stranger without a good reason . 
  overall , i absolutely loved it and will definitely visit again . 
  especially orlando . 
  individual police are not really seen negatively , but the organisation in general ... seen as a complete joke , sadly . 
  the national chief is absolutely useless and heavily criticised from all directions ( including internally ) . 
  he has zero experience with police work , was given the job by the current government because he hates the nationalist party and is good at covering stuff up and repeatedly breaks the rule saying the chief has to be politically unbound . 
  because of bad organisation , leadership and distribution of resources , their ability to do their job has diminished badly . 
  crime prevention has been cut down badly , with many types of crimes being de-prioritized due to inability to deal with it . 
  their response to the sexual harassment problems at summer festivals was to hand out `` do n't harass me '' bracelets , saying they were `` meant to start a dialogue '' . 
  this is often brought up as part of the mocking . 
  to get into it a little deeper , the left wing are often more negative about the police in general . 
  for example , they often accuse them of `` collaborating with nazis '' when the police are tasked with protecting nationalist/far right demonstrations and speeches ( against left wing radicals , generally ) . 
  the left also tend to criticise the police more in general . 
  ** tl ; dr ** : large parts of the left wing seems to * hate * them , most people in general see them as a joke but still view individuals positively ... except the national chief , who most people agree * has * to resign . 
  well , it was just a bunch of minor things related to how you act and stuff like that ... also , the difference in how you eat compared to in sweden . 
  sweet pastries just when you wake up , a large sandwich for breakfast later on , lunch in the afternoon and dinner super late was ... weird . 
  here , you 'd eat some sandwiches or cereal when you wake up , lunch at noon or 1pm and dinner somewhere between 5pm and 8pm . 
  ha , i was in a language exchange with a spanish school back in like 11th grade or so ... 
  i got so many weird looks from the family i stayed with . 
  apart from being able to drive companies out of business ( which they have , many times ) with blockades , the unions are also the ones deciding if a work immigrant gets to stay or not , as well as which rules they have to follow . 
  pretty sure no other country has that , either . 
  our unions are ridiculously powerful . 
   queue jumping you always hear brits say that , but in general the ones i 've encountered have been among the absolute worst at queueing properly . 
  odd . 
  dial down the collectivist parts of society , main problems caused by it at the moment is a lack of personal responsibility for people who fuck up ( as in really badly , like doctors causing deaths and social services ignoring children in need getting little or no consequences ) . 
  also , the [ jantelag ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/law_of_jante ) which basically makes individual success seem like something bad and has more effect on our society than most people like to admit . 
  seen a bunch about it over on tumblr ... looks like it 's partially inspired by both sailor moon and kim possible , so i guess in this case the european thing is to mix the japanese and us stuff ? 
  now order them all according to a good rhyme scheme so we can sing the list ( if it does n't really work , just add some random pasta shape names ) !, 
  fazer blue is my dad 's favorite chocolate ... 
  i prefer geisha , myself . 
  love the filling . 
  the entire life of [ karl xii ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charles_xii_of_sweden ) ( aka charles xii , carolus rex ) , really . 
  he defeated a coalition of denmark-norway , saxony-poland-lithuania and russia when he was only 18 years old , during the [ great northern war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_northern_war ) . 
  however , after forcing d-n and s-p-l into surrender and pushing russia back , he decided to march on moscow instead of accepting the russian plea for peace ( which would have given sweden all russian baltic possessions except s : t petersburg ) . 
  he even had some cossack allies that would meet him halfway .
