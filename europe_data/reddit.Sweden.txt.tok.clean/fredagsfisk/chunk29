  now , said cossacks were slaughtered before that could happen . 
  polish revolts forced him to leave 8000 men behind . 
  bad weather ( coldest winter in over a century and winter quarters into * june * ) and scorched earth tactics left them with little food , and supply lines were bad . 
  reinforcements were tied up in poland . 
  with the king wounded , command was handed over to field marshal rehnski\u00f6ld at the [ battle of poltava ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_poltava ) . 
  a minor tactical miss early in the battle lead to an escalating situation , and the swedish army was slaughtered by the 3x larger russian force . 
  charles xii was forced to escape south to the ottoman empire , while any swedish troops captured by peter i were sent to siberia . 
  at the ottoman town of bender , charles xii built a small swedish village ( karlstad ) , with his expenses covered by the ottoman state budget and the sultan giving him some swedish women and children sold by the russians . 
  after about 5 years of trying to provoke the sultan into attacking russia and racking up huge debts with the local merchants , the [ sultan decided to throw charles xii out and surrounded his camp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/skirmish_at_bender ) ( with 700-1000 swedish soldiers ) with ~ 10000 men . 
  they fought for an entire day , 100s of turkish soldiers and a couple dozen swedes being killed , before charles xii was captured . 
  once he was freed , he rode home , started a new war against norway and was shot in the head , likely by one of his own soldiers . 
  the decline of the swedish empire started .

  littering laws , along with massive campaigns asking people to recycle and avoid littering . 
  `` h\u00e5ll sverige rent '' ( keep sweden clean ) is a large non-profit organisation that heads such campaigns and engage around 800k people ( often school/daycare children , scouts , sports teams and other volunteers ) yearly in drives to clean up their local area . 
  also lots of other campaigns , drives and such ... and it 's normally worked into the education at daycares and schools , to ensure children learn not to throw trash anywhere at a young age . 
   did it do anything to stop it ? 
  like what , exactly ? 
  we are neutral , meaning we do not interfere in such matters . 
   and why did it participate in an illegal war ? 
  sweden was never part of any war in the middle east , only the un peacekeeping force . 
  no swedish soldier has been involved in fighting that was not solely self defense .

   also , the nukes did n't cause japan to surrender . 
  from my understanding of what happened , the twin events of the nukes ( and the threat of more coming ) and the soviet invasion of manchuria ( which happened around the same time ) were what tipped the edge and caused japan to discuss surrender . 
  you have any good source with other information ? 
  being interested in this stuff , i 'd love to read it . 
  last time i saw a calculation for that , nope . 
  the us person would still have more money left . 
  not sure how good or bad the insurances and such they used in that calculation were , however . 
  the firebombing of tokyo might have caused more deaths than both nukes combined , but the nukes are what caused japan to surrender ( even though there were multiple coup attempts to stop the surrender ) . 
  if that had not happened , the us would 've had to land forces in japan , who may have fought to the last man ( at least that was the reasoning at the time , i 'm not sure how accurate it was ) . 
  what * is * certain is that such an invasion would have cost massive resources and countless military * and * civilian lives in japan alone . 
  i 'd say that while the nukings were terrible , they were not the worst atrocities of that war and may have prevented far worse things from happening . 
   what if the atomic bombs had made the japanese fight harder in the pacific ? 
  then they would have kept using them , from what i understand . 
  by the time the japanese surrender came around , the us military leaders were discussing if they should start stockpiling nukes for a single large strike , or use them as they were completed . 
  yeah , he was shot in the street around midnight . 
  no one knows who did it and why , though . 
   socialist as in the traditional meaning of the collective ownership of the means of production ? 
  there was an attempt at a form of this during the palme era here in sweden ( around the 70s-80s ) , though , with ownership of some companies being transferred over to the unions ( which were , and still are , ridiculously powerful ) . 
  the attempts mostly died out by the 90s ( sture eskilsson is often credited for this ) , but the process still has strong support within the left party and social democratic party ( which is the leading party of the current government ) . 
   scandinavian countries generally have the highest taxes in europe . 
  sweden was the highest in the world ( with denmark second , iirc ) back in 2006 , when the right wing government took over . 
  by the end of their time ( 2012-2014-ish ) we were almost down on european average , but the current government has raised ( or planned to raise ) a lot of taxes ( and talked about adding in some old/new ones ) . 
  it 's not really a specific event or statement , it 's more the way she talks and acts when these topics come up in general . 
  if you put it all together ... also , i 'm not entirely convinced she sees that much of a difference between israel and jews in general . 
  her statements have indicated an `` understanding '' for people who attack jews here in sweden due to israeli politics . 
  to add a related somewhat comment to that : it does n't exactly help that her statements regarding israel and palestine ( while sometimes justified ) are almost entirely aimed at painting israel as the sole bad guy , often completely ignoring negative palestinian actions or attempting to give them some flimsy justification . 
  an example would be earlier this year , when israeli police killed some palestinian terrorists who had been using knives and/or guns to kill several civilians before attacking the police themselves as they arrived at the scene . 
  instead of condemning the attacks and expressing a wish that things could have been resolved without violence , she bashed israel for `` extrajudicial executions '' . 
  did she come with similar criticism when similar things happened in europe , though ? 
  of course not . 
  another version of balladen om briggen blue bird : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hur9wwln4r8 and another great swedish song ( originally written in the late 1700s ) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssqmu-mywbq, 
  mainly about norway ... bit about denmark as well , though . 
  generally the typical `` haha they 're so dumb '' type of stories , but also regarding their language . 
  danish for example is often joked about as being impossible to understand , or sounding as if you have a mouth full of porridge . 
  classic norweigian example of mocking danish : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-moy8vuebk not exactly what you asked , but we also have a subset of so called `` bellman jokes '' , which pits a completely inaccurate parody of swedish historical poet/composer [ carl michael bellman ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carl_michael_bellman ) against two non-swedish characters ... often will bellman being either unconventionally smart or a complete idiot . 
  examples from wikipedia :  a russian , a german and bellman wanted to see who could swim the fastest across the atlantic . 
  first out was the german . 
  he swam 1 kilometer and drowned . 
  next came the russian . 
  he swam 10 kilometers and then he drowned . 
  now it was bellman 's turn . 
  he swam and swam until he almost reached the coast of america - then he got tired and swam back . 
  and :  a dane , a norwegian and bellman made a wager on who could remain inside a goat pen the longest . 
  first out was the dane , who came out after just 10 minutes yelling `` damn !, 
  after him the norwegian went in , and after half an hour he came out yelling , `` damn !, 
  finally bellman went in . 
  after 2 hours the goat came rushing out yelling `` damn !, 
   i remember some resignations for minor administrative mistakes as well , the most famous case being mona sahlin 's resignation . 
  would n't call that `` administrative mistakes '' ... repeatedly buying stuff for tax money while having a history of not paying taxes properly , having * literally * 100s of unpaid parking tickets on cars she could not legally drive ( she was given a paid parking spot so the state would n't have to pay for her anymore ) , hiring people without paying taxes and a ton of shit like that . 
  back in 2006 , several right wing ministers were forced to retire ( due to pressure from the media and left wing ) for failure to pay public service fees or hiring a nanny without paying taxes * several years * before the got their position . 
  considering some of the shit left wing politicians here have gotten away with , it 's nice to see one actually accept the consequences instead of coming with excuses . 
   if by that you mean that they belong to group one , that 's fine by me , but if you mean that they belong to group two , i find it hard to believe . 
  no , i mean that there are jews that belong to both groups . 
  there are many jews who are against the creation of a zionist state at all . 
  do remember that `` judaism '' is not a single entity , just like `` christianity '' or `` islam '' is not a single entity . 
  there are many , many groups with different beliefs and agendas . 
  the wikipedia article has some basic information about jewish and non-jewish antizionism , connections to antisemitism and how it 's often used as an excuse for antisemitism : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-zionism  and even if they are related to israel , why the hell would people think that they can go around attacking people who disagree with them ? 
  the people who do that are generally racist/antisemitic `` activists '' attempting to justify their views and actions . 
  not exactly the brightest minds of our generation . 
  anti-semitism is racism , prejudice and/or other such things against jewish people in general . 
  anti-zionism is generally opposition to the concept of a jewish state ( israel ) ... either their politics and policies , or the idea of it 's existance in general . 
  there are also jews who are anti-zionistic . 
  however , the two will often overlap . 
  jews in sweden and other european countries may be attacked because of israeli actions , even if they have never even been to israel . 
  except in malm\u00f6 , where not only is anti-semitism rampant enough that * obama sent an emissary * to sort things out and a lot of jews have left the city , but the former mayor ( ilmar reepalu , social democrat ) ignored and added fuel to it by first pretending that no problem existed , then claiming that the critizism against him for that was a jewish conspiracy . 
  also , several high ranking members of the green party ( including a former leader ) claimed that the whole kaplan affair ( the housing minister and some other green party members were forced to retire due to ties to islamic extremists ) was a kurdish-jewish conspiracy . 
  * also * , margot wallstr\u00f6m ( the current foreign minister ) has shown some signs of anti-semitism ( no , not anti-zionism ) in her actions and statements . 
  while it 's * mainly * anti-zionism that exists in sweden , could we please not pretend like anti-semitism is n't an issue ? 
  because it is . 
  math in 6-9th grade had 3 different `` speeds '' ... other than that , not really . 
  some 10-12th grade schools may require better grades to get into , however , and the right wing government we had 2006-2014 added `` elite '' programs that require a high grade to get into . 
  generally , the left wing opposes such division , however ( and they are the ones who have ruled for most of the 1900s ) . 
  the left party even wants to remove all grading systems before 10th grade and allow people to select schools on a `` first come first serve '' basis . 
  is n't it even weirder to you then that liberals and socioliberals are considered right wing here , along with conservatives ? 
  just think about the red scare and you 'll be fine remembering the red/blue being left/right ,
