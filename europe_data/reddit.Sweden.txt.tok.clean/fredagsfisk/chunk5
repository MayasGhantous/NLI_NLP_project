  3 ) higher % of rapes are actually reported ( according to studies ) . 
  4 ) statistical data in sweden is collected when reported , rather than once convicted . 
  even if the charge is later changed or dropped , it remains in the statistics . 
  also because the same person raping the same person 20 times in counted as * once * in most countries ' statistics and 20 times in swedish statistics . 
  statistical data is collected when reported here , rather than when convicted ( dropped/changed charges count in statistics ) . 
  a higher % of rapes are reported than in other countries . 
  yep , because swedish rape statistics are done in a completely different way than they are in other countries + some other reasons . 
  for example : 1 ) dude in the us rapes his girlfriend 20 times . 
  counted as 1 time in us statistics . 
  dude in sweden does the same . 
  counted as 20 times in swedish statistics . 
  2 ) much wider definition of rape than pretty much any other country . 
  3 ) higher % of rapes are actually reported ( according to studies ) . 
  4 ) statistical data in sweden is collected when reported , rather than once convicted . 
  even if the charge is later changed or dropped , it remains in the statistics . 
  notably the * moment she took over the party * . 
  i do n't particularily like her as the alliance leader , and she is a bit flip-floppy at times , but in this particular issue she has been * nothing * like reinfeldt at any point . 
   they just want `` change '' hah , one of the criticisms against the right wing government here leading up to the 2014 election was that their politics were too much `` the same '' and not enough new things . 
  the arguments were basically `` it works well , look at the charts '' versus `` but it 's boring with nothing new '' . 
  right , you started out with some decent arguments , but ...  also those in the know are aware that their current party leader was the last one 's proteg\u00e9 and that her name is on their internal m document calling for open borders . 
  you mean batra , who is constantly being bitched at by the left and media for * distancing herself * from reinfeldt and being against his stupid immigration policies and wanting something * completely * different ? 
  also , for suggesting that discussions must be held with the sweden democrats and stuff like that ? 
  politically ? 
  they were started by a sweden democrat , their stated affiliation is sweden democratic and libertarianist , their domain name was bought by one of the sd leaders and they work closely with sd and other sd-affiliated sites such as avpixlat . 
  oh , and they 've run certain news stories specifically because sd asked them to . 
  during the second northern war , the swedish army under charles x walked across the frozen belts into denmark for an incredibly successful surprise attack . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/march_across_the_belts not recommended though :  the ice warped under the weight of the soldiers ; on occasions water reached up to the men 's knees . 
  man , better cover it with something . 
  just remember [ never to use water when putting out a greece fire ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3f4c5o4j7m ) . 
  the oslo dude was russian , so not sure he was doing it because of religion ... the guy in sweden was uzbek . 
   people are telling others that they are bigoted or afraid when they 're just trying to help before it 'll cost too many lives to fix . 
  i might almost be inclined to giving a free pass for that , if it was n't for the gloating `` told you so '' - bullshit behind it . 
  also the fact that most of those behind the mocking things are people who have spent the past year or so spreading fake bullshit about sweden for political reasons . 
   i have n't seen the fake reviews information you 're describing there were some on for example / r/sweden and / r/europe spreading far higher casualty numbers than there really were , or claiming that certain events that never took place ( like the shootings at fridhemsplan ) had been confirmed by the police . 
  they were specifically denied by the police . 
  thankfully , the mods on both subreddits ( and in some cases people who had unknowingly spread the numbers themselves ) were good at removing those fake numbers/confirmations . 
   nor have i seen any `` terrorist kill cams '' on the donald or anywhere else . 
  [ here . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/the_donald/comments/647etj/in_america_we_dont_get_mad_we_get_even_we_would/ ), 
   as for tasteless jokes/comments , i have yet to see any related to this poor girl 's murder . 
  specifically ? 
  dunno , but for the attack in general ( and obviously , warning for the links to anyone who might feel such things are offensive , merely putting them here as examples ) : - people blaming all swedes or non-altrighters for the attack and saying they `` will pay for it '' . 
  - people [ mocking sweden over the attack ] ( https://i.redd.it/gxznclubriqy.jpg ) and getting thousands of upvotes . 
  - making politics of the attack while ... attacking others for making politics of the attack . 
  - [ tasteless jokes ] ( http://i.4cdn.org/pol/1491648892772.png ) . 
  - whining about how no pictures of the 11 year old girl who died are being shared by media for political reasons . 
  - fake information about what happened being spread . 
  - tons of `` finally this happened in sweden '' bullshit . 
  - t_d had a `` terrorist kill cam '' contest for people to share pictures/video of terrorists being killed ... essentially to celebrate it . 
  shit like that . 
  so do n't come and claim that no one is loving this situation , because they are . 
  even if they claim they are * sooo * unhappy this happened . 
  alright , i should say that it 's * one * of the definitions used , as there is no definition used everywhere and it is context-dependant . 
  for sweden , which has very few tall buildings , the limit will of course be lower than in for example nyc or hong kong . 
  the emporis definition is to make it easier to create statistics . 
  yet the 50 meters definition is still the one used . 
   yes it does , you do n't happen to chose a rotary phone over a smartphone because of its `` aestethics '' ? 
  the entire point * was about aestiethics * . 
  you said they * look like graveyards * . 
  anyways , i wo n't waste more time on this discussion . 
  you clearly have no idea what you 're talking about and do not intend to change that . 
   so if copernicus failed to express his meaning of the heliocentric model , we would still believe in the geocentric model ? 
  wow , that was the least relevant comparison i 've heard in ... weeks , at least . 
  you gave a claim . 
  i said i did not understand how you figured they were alike . 
  you sent a picture * to reinforce that claim * , which i gave a counter-argument to . 
  * then * you started blaming me for `` misinterpreting '' and * completely changed your claim * to something different . 
  no , it 's more like copernicus would claim that earth orbits a galaxy , then send a picture of a galaxy to the people opposing him , and * then * , when he is still opposed , change his mind to `` it 's orbiting a star , you * should * have figured that out since there are stars in galaxies '' ... and then refuse to explain how he figured that out when people ask , or bring up something completely different while attacking those who disagree for not being smart enough to understand what he meant . 
   they are ugly , less efficient that newer buildings , much like a rotary phone is less efficient that a smartphone . 
  still not an answer to the actual question . 
  it 's not semantics , and there was no misunderstanding . 
  it was you who failed massively to express your meaning , or changed your mind mid-conversation . 
  you never * once * even * mentioned * coffins until long into the discussion , after several points had already been brought up against your initial claim . 
  however , my original question still stands unanswered : in what way do they look like coffins that newer buildings do not ? 
  where exactly did i say that ? 
  you * literally * said they `` look like graveyards '' and then linked a picture to * a freaking graveyard * when i argued against it . 
  do n't fucking lie . 
  yet you specifically said `` graveyard '' , where you do n't actually see any coffins . 
  and coffins make even * less * sense than your original comment . 
  multiple times per week , really ? 
  and `` not enjoying '' my ass . 
  i see certain groups basically creaming themselves with glee over this attack . 
  using it for memes , jokes and justifying just oooone more threat or taunt against anyone who disagrees politically . 
  just avoid t_d , where they 're basically having an orgy about it . 
  did a quick visit to see how bad it was . 
  left after seeing the implied death threats against all non-altrighters + their `` terrorist kill cam '' contest to celebrate it . 
  interestingly , there were also people claiming to be swedish and using the term `` liberal left '' . 
  which is not a thing here , unless you are * extremely * far right . 
  yes ? 
  i 've been to plenty of beautiful graveyards . 
  the one in nice stands out , for example . 
  i still do n't get your comparison and how old architecture would * generally * look like graveyards . 
  i could understand it if you were speaking specifically about gothic architecture or something . 
  the definition of skyscraper is a building 50 meters or higher , and those are 60 meters ... so yes . 
  the original term came up in the late 1800s to describe buildings with 10-20 floors . 
  these were built around that time , and were the tallest buildings in sweden back then . 
  the fuck kind of graveyards do you visit ? 
  i visited nyc once , which was pretty nice , but i felt * really * trapped between those buildings at times . 
  when you can only see a strip of sky . 
  uppsala from the northern side of the river , cathedral and castle in the background : http://uppsalaflygfoto.se/wp-content/uploads/bfi_thumb/maklare_dsc3137_uf1-2xepwkis5brdw7kcsxpji8.jpg note that the only buildings taller than the base of the castle are the cathedral , the carolina rediviva library ( yellow building just right to it in the back ) and possibly the concert building ( blue-grey modern one on the right ) .
