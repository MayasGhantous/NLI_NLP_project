   also having a lot of old architecture is a good way of making a city look like a graveyard . 
  you 've never been to an older city then , eh ? 
  or [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ac/uppsala_-_view_of_river_and_v%c3%a4stg%c3%b6ta_nation.jpg ) ? 
  that 's older architecture . 
  hundreds of years old , even . 
  [ this ] ( https://cdn.starwebserver.se/shops/sekelskifte/files/cache/storg_torstenssg_dup1_large-1448355457_large.jpg ) is from just a few years before the towers above . 
  that also graveyard-y ? 
  kinda the same in uppsala , sweden , except with the base of the castle instead of the church tower . 
  for the city center at least , got ta preserve [ the skyline ] ( http://beautifuluppsala.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_6548-001.jpg ) . 
  it 's not a confirmed terrorist attack ( yet ) , and there * have * been other attacks in the past . 
  the sword attack in trollh\u00e4ttan and peter mangs shootings in malm\u00f6 were terrorist attacks , for example . 
  hell , we even had some sami terrorists who blew up some power lines in 1998 . 
  hilariously , female pikachu have heart-shaped tails . 
  that 's a boy pikachu . 
  sure , if they 're * wrong * ? 
  not sure how you mean here . 
  if the answers are say aecdebcced and you answer cccccccccc you 'd get 3 points , since there are 3 cs in there . 
  you do n't get -1 point for wrong answers , if that 's what you 're asking . 
  the university program for teachers in sweden is insanely easy to get into , which is a huge problem here ... you can do a `` university test '' with multiple-choice questions that gives a score between 0.0 and 2.0 to use instead of grades to get into university , if you want . 
  last year , you needed a 0.1 to get into the teacher program . 
  you 'd get around 0.4-0 .5 if you simply chose c on every single question of the test . 
  well , it certainly does n't help that the pisa tests comes right after the national tests and have no effect on grades , so swedish students do n't give a shit about scoring well on it . 
  at least they seem to have the same way of calculating for each country here . 
  i remember a few years ago , when our then-opposition claimed that sweden had * the * highest youth unemployment in the entire eu , and someone calmly pointed out we were also the only country in that study who included gymnasium students looking for a summer job in our unemployment statistics . 
  statistics in general can be very misleading if done improperly , or if not understanding the underlying reasons for certain stats . 
  yep , but getting fewer and fewer changes ... getting increasingly stagnant as `` anti-griefers '' prevent any new things from popping up . 
  also lines of dutch and swedish flag hearts in between the dutch area and the massive swedish flag . 
  sweden has never been invaded , yet have a completely different attitude to the whole thing , so i 'm not sure i believe in that argument . 
  my parents have a regular cherry tree ( small-medium amount of white flowers ) and a japanese cherry tree ( large amount of bright pink flowers ) in their garden . 
   we 've been graced by not having a dictator , or hostile invasion control our lives in the past millennium . 
  how would that influence things ? 
  edit : also , the dictator part is n't true . 
  not just based on , but it 's most likely located there as well . 
  impossible to know exactly where though , as there are many contradictions ( probably to ensure it 's impossible to say it 's a single country ) . 
  some place that is n't landlocked , and uses both cyrillic and latin alphabets . 
  signs are in both russian , romanian and bulgarian . 
  the gas pumps on highway 17 are swedish . 
  well they have what * looks * like a japanese cherry tree in the back on the left as well ... 
  gives the illusion of higher protection/regulation than national labels give ? 
   the spelling `` expresso '' is sometimes used ; while some sources state that this spelling is incorrect , other sources call it an acceptable variant spelling . 
  wikipedia says it 's fine sometimes !, 
  ^ ^ ^ but ^ ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ ^ not, 
  i think it might depend on how you word the question and how `` tight '' you mean for the union to be ... you have any good poll about it that you could link ? 
  it 's a rather interesting subject . 
  they are not . 
  the liberals have been pro-defense spending as well , for as long as i can remember . 
  certainly since bj\u00f6rklund took over as party leader , almost 10 years ago , at the very least . 
  yep , to sum stuff up : moderate party ( r ) and center party ( r ) = pro nato , but wants strong political support for it before joining ( as in at least one of the left wing parties supporting it ) . 
  christian democrats ( r ) = pro nato , though do not feel strongly about it and were against it until 2013 when they slowly started shifting to being more for it . 
  liberals ( r ) , ( formerly people 's party ) = pro nato , wants sweden to join as quickly as possible . 
  feels it 's a matter of national security that should n't be stopped by political disagreement . 
  social democrats ( l ) , green party ( l ) = anti nato , citing the swedish neutrality and nonalignment policies . 
  left party ( l ) = anti nato , says joining would reduce our ability to conduct foreign policy and peacekeeping missions . 
  also claims that we would be dragged into multiple offensive wars and conflicts if joining . 
  sweden democrats = anti nato , wants more nordic cooperation instead . 
  however , polls show a majority of their voters actually support joining . 
  support for such a union is * very * low in the nordic countries though . 
  highest in sweden actually , possibly because sweden ( stockholm ) would likely become the `` capital '' of such a union , as it 's central and sweden has the highest population and such . 
  the party i vote for ( liberals ) are right wing but fairly close to the center . 
  they used to be more outspoken against certain integration problems and such a few years ago ( for example , one of their suggestions was that religious clothing that covered the face and eyes should not be allowed in schools ) . 
  they pretty much stopped when they were constantly accused of being fascist and racist by media and certain left wing groups , and it started hurting their poll numbers . 
  i think it was mainly this type of rhetoric that led to the sweden democrats gaining so much support initially , and it 's still leading to further polarization of our politics . 
  used to be state owned , now pernod ricard owned since 2008 ( they bought it from the government for 55 billion sek ) . 
  he * mocked them * as they starved . 
  `` did n't want them to die '' my ass . 
  he was just sad ghandi was n't among the corpses . 
  easy there , adolf fredrick . 
  yes , it 's sooo terrible to have become one of the best places to live in the entire world . 
  so bad . 
  different gc area . 
  this particular area is as above , but the rest of the danish gold coast was sold 1850 as you said . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_slave_trade from my understanding , our part in the trade was mainly related to collecting export taxes and selling iron chains . 
  i must admit to not knowing much about it though . 
  battle of breitenfeld . 
  an army from sweden and saxony , led by gustav ii adolf , crushed the slightly smaller imperial army and crippled the catholic league 's ability to field a larger army while multiple smaller german states flocked to the protestant side . 
  the battle confirmed gustav ii adolf 's skill and innovation on the battlefield , turned the war in protestant favor and shifted the power balance in europe . 
  still kinda tame compared to the thirty years war :  the swedish armies alone may have destroyed up to 2,000 castles , 18,000 villages , and 1,500 towns in germany , one-third of all german towns . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/schwedentrunk of course , the 30yw was quite important for future religious freedom in europe , and sweden turned the tide in favor of the protestants with the battle of breitenfeld 1631 , but still . 
  we were kinda shitty in the 1600s in general . 
  the history of the swedish gold coast is great , by the way : - founded by sweden . 
  - governor is replaced after a few years . 
  pissed off , he defects to denmark and seizes it for them . 
  - sweden uses this to declare war on denmark , as is tradition . 
  - the colony is returned to sweden , but turns out a friend of the guy who handed it to denmark has now * sold * the colony to the dutch west india company and escaped to angola with the money . 
  - the native people lead a successful uprising against the dutch , then offer sweden control of the area again . 
  - denmark seizes the colony * again * , but loses it to britain just a year later . 
  all of this happened within 15 years , between 1649 and 1664 . 
  edit : thanks for the gold ^ ^ ^ ^ coast !, 
  it 's good for practicing and expanding your word count a bit . 
  does n't really teach grammar and such well , tho . 
  many small islands in the area speaks french , so might be why . 
  does n't seem to be trade-related at least . 
  op knows that 's why . 
  he 's a racist t_d poster trying to push a narrative . 
  as for spanish on greenland ... they wan na retire somewhere warm and cozy , maybe ? 
  but if we blow up everything * except * pluto , it 'll finally get to be biggest !, 
  well you got ta have enough to destroy the moon as well , just in case there 's a nazi moonbase like in iron sky or something . 
  or trying to offer separate trade deals to solo eu countries to weaken the union and not have to deal with them together . 
  trump also said on at least two separate occasions that they should * use * nukes more often , because why else would you even have them ? 
  so maybe it 's not * just * to have the most anymore .
