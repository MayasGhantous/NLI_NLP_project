  for example , peter springare is often brought up in this context , but has been accused of consistently acting racist , making it difficult for anti-nationalist protests specifically and his own ex-partner in the police force said they had completely different views on things and he had no idea what he was talking about with some stuff . 
  also worth mentioning that they removed the `` integration minister '' post and that the social democrats consider integration to be racist ( or at least have stated so in the past ) . 
   non-eu 30,3 % does that include asylum seekers or not , though ? 
  they 're not allowed to work until their application is processed , and considering how many weird quirks we tend to have in our statistics i would n't be surprised if it was included . 
  damn i have n't had a quattro stagioni ( ham , mushrooms , shrimp , clams ) in ages . 
  well not really * just * because of that , he does have a law degree and has worked a bit with related stuff , but essentially many agree that his dislike of sd was a large reason . 
  the position is handled by the sitting government , and dan eliasson is the current one , with previous experience as head of the swedish migration agency and the swedish social insurance agency , a short bit as acting head of the swedish security service inbetween the two ( less than a year ) and some other stuff . 
  however , there was massive criticism against his leadership at the social insurance agency , as he silenced those who spoke out against him , was clearly inept at leadership and administration , used very questionable surveillance against the employees , gave zero flexibility and generally sucked at it . 
  but ... he was also a member of the social democrats ( main party of the government ) , was a very vocal sd-hater and had some experience that looked good if you did n't check too closely , so he got the job . 
  since , he has been accused of acting basically the same as he did at the sia , covering stuff up , has spoken out against sd ( despite it being * very much not ok * for the chief to make political statements ) , mismanaged a ton of stuff , etc. 
  tons of people , including police and politicians , have demanded that he resign , but the government keeps saying they have full confidence in him and his abilities . 
  it is when you state clearly untrue things as if they were facts to do it . 
  so you knowingly spread misinformation ( that you * know * is fake ) , contributing to the negative attitude towards the police force as a whole , thus compounding the problems and making it more difficult for them to do their jobs ( while also making it more difficult for people online to know what the truth is ) . 
  instead , why not just raise one of the many , many other * real * problems that * do exist * with the police ? 
  like the inept leadership and administration , the absolute joke of a chief , the lack of resources , the terribly handled reorganisation ... ? 
  while the wristband idea was obviously idiotic , it was never stated that the reason was to stop crimes . 
  the stated goal was to get people talking about it and possibly be more vigilant in situations it might happen . 
  lack of resources is a major problem from what i understand , yes . 
  the right wing did increase them back when they were the government , but definitely not enough . 
  the two other main problems i think at the moment : - the criticised reorganisation started by the right wing , which has been done terribly badly and caused severe problems . 
  - the national chief the left wing put in place essentially because he hated sd ... and who has no experience in the field , extremely questionable leadership `` skills '' and reportedly tries to silence any criticism against him and the other police leaders . 
  he also said that philadelphia has had a massive homicide rate increase as well , when they have * not * had an increase . 
  both philly and chicago had around 80 % voting democrat in the last election though , and there are many republican-dominated cities that are far worse but * not * singled out by the president , so i would be inclined to see that statement more as a scare tactic . 
  no , trump himself said [ on his twitter ] ( https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/833435244451753984 ) than he was talking about the fox `` story '' . 
   trying to change the definition of rape is pretty sickening quite frankly . 
  sorry , expanding the definition to be more inclusive and cover more similar crimes is * bad * , according to you ? 
  he specifically said `` last night '' and mentioned sweden in connection with a bunch of places that * have * had terror attacks . 
  `` he did n't mean it like that '' is * not * an acceptable excuse for a president . 
  the right wing changed their politics right after the election , with the new leaders actively distancing themselves from the earlier line ( and are now being constantly critizised by left wing media like ab for changing , and accused of `` folding to the extreme right '' ) . 
  the * left * continued to advocate unhindered immigration and open borders for another * month * , only changing their minds when refugees were * sleeping in the immigration agency lobby * . 
  they then acted in complete panic , leading to a terrible implementation of border control rules that were not enforceable , hurt the economy , and were contested by the courts as unlawful . 
  the vice pm romson * cried * during the announcement of said restrictions , with several ministers talking about how terrible * their own politics * were , and the green party having problems because many of their members still wanted 100 % open borders . 
  that 's the old one , so if anyone wants one they 'd have to find one that has not been exchanged for a new one . 
  the new 20sek bill has astrid lindgren and pippi longstocking on the front , a sm\u00e5land landscape on the back . 
  [ the other new bills ] ( http://www.riksbank.se/press-and-published/press/press-photos/new-banknotes/ ) have evert taube , greta garbo , ingmar bergman , birgit nilsson and dag hammarsk\u00f6ld , with various landscapes on the backs . 
  japanese studios were involved in most of the animated ones , but the original books were written by tove jansson , from the swedish-speaking minority in finland . 
  large eu cities ( outside belgium ) with highest % of muslim population : - marseille , 20 % to 25 % depending on source - stockholm , 20 % ( no source given ) - malm\u00f6 , 20 % - roubaix , 20 % - leicester , 18,6 % highest in belgium ( and only two on the list ) : - brussels , 15 % to 25,5 % depending on source - antwerp , 16,9 % https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_cities_in_the_european_union_by_muslim_population, 
  well , trump 's administration apparently claims that poland are doing military incursions into belarus as we speak , so ... close enough ? 
  trump is reportedly trying to give separate trade deals to single eu countries rather than deal with eu as a whole ( thus attempting to weaken it ) , while appointing an eu ambassador who wants to break apart the eu and acts with open hostility . 
  his administration is also supposedly claiming that poland are invading belarus ( who coincidentally are having political squabbles with russia at the moment ) while reaching out to russia , who are seen as a threat to europe since quite some time . 
  i like the us , but i would hardly consider them reliable allies while trump is at the helm , at the very least . 
  belarus are fighting with russia a bit currently , so clearly poland are trying to stir things up by brainwashing poor lukashenko . 
  best send some russian forces straight into belarus as well , to ~ ~ annex ~ ~ ensure they 're kept safe .

  really ? 
  everyone else from malm\u00f6 i 've seen on reddit has said that media reports are completely exaggerated and that things are not as bad as they seem ... though it usually seems as the worst city in sweden by far , crime-wise . 
  that is acceptable . 
  no claymores or broadswords tho . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ha86cwkd50u is another one , 
  they call it vulkanpizza ... volcano pizza ... was a trend like 1-2 years ago . 
  started up north , in pite\u00e5 , then spread to other pizza places that tried to get better sales by jumping on the trend . 
  expensive and way too big as well , it seems . 
  there 's also the carlskrove in some places ... burger and fries baked into a pizza . 
  how dare you , good sir . 
  there will be a duel at dawn !, 
  bring a piece of pistol-shaped chocolate . 
  fastest to eat it while still savoring the flavor wins . 
  no , [ this is awesome ] ( https://happyride.se/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/bild-51.jpg ) . 
  viking special ... basically a kebab pizza without veggies folded like you would a calzone , served with a stack of fries ( normally it 's more doughy and less burnt-looking than in that pic tho , but was only i could find ) . 
  normally for a kebab pizza you 'd have kebab meat , sauce ( mild , hot or mixed ) , lettuce and tomato . 
  veggies and sauce ( s ) added * after * it 's out of the oven , obviously . 
  that abomination i linked earlier is just some insane trend from a year or two ago . 
  well you already have the k\u00f6ttf\u00e4rss\u00e5s , which is basically minced meat , chili sauce and ( optionally ) cream ... the ketchup 's sweetness adds a bit of freshness , not balance really but more a contrast i guess ? 
  would never dream of using it with a carbonara or something tho . 
  no , but i could probably tell you stories about what we do to pizza that would give you a heart attack . 
  [ this one ] ( https://gfx.aftonbladet-cdn.se/image/20988631/960/normal/43f0ddd20b947/pizzan.jpg ) was quite popular here in sweden some time ago . 
  kebabpizza is basically our national dish tho , eaten by half the country on january 1st . 
  sorry , what ? 
  i agree . 
  my favorite non-dark chocolate are guylian sea shell pralines , and they 're belgian . 
  what ? 
  you take some spaghetti , k\u00f6ttf\u00e4rss\u00e5s ( which is basically discount rag\u00f9 ) , put some ketchup and parmesan powder on it . 
  / r/fingols, 
  time for the swedish empire 2 : flatpack boogaloo !, 
  swedes on here , start assembling the tanks . 
  i 'll put the jets together once i find my sexkantsnyckel and the local ikea opens so i can pick up the missing screws !, 
   not like the ~ ~ soft gently bird ~ ~ live turkey being run through a document shredder like quality of danish . 
  ftfy, 
  they at least have 70 % + that agree on * some * level . 
  estonia is below 45 % . 
  quite a big difference . 
  why ? 
  if important/basic values are not shared ... 
  their `` disagreers '' do so more strongly than ours though ... 
  i do wonder if some of the result might be from different definitions/views on what would be included in `` same rights '' ? 
  that 's a general problem when it comes to sex-related laws though , and not exactly specific to this . 
  obviously , proving a rape would likely be easier than proving that some dude said he wore a condom when he did n't , but it 's still possible , and the law * does * serve a purpose if it deters such behaviour . 
  do remember that laws do not always have to specifically lead to convictions to have some positive effect as well . 
  pretty sure the danes are more salty ... you 're basically surrounded by the sea , and not even any hills to protect you from the winds of salt . 
   and how does that hold up in court ? 
  to be honest , i do n't know of any specific examples . 
  from what i 've read though , there would have to be * some * other proof for the claim , or it 'd be dismissed . 
   ok , i can picture the last two , but what or who are `` anti-swedish groups '' and why ?!, 
  groups that for various reasons dislike sweden and it 's values and/or culture . 
  since sweden is often positively depicted in international media , those who dislike said aspects of swedish society will make things up to discredit it . 
  this will often overlap with the anti-feminists , but also include anti-immigration groups , anti-socialists and such . 
  mm that 's another type of misinformation though , i guess . 
  this is more about those who claim swedish rape law is so extensive that anyone can be convicted simply for looking at a woman , or something like that . 
  the other type is basically the opposite , operating on the assumption that rape laws and statistics gathering works the same in all countries , when in reality sweden * does * include more than in most other countries and the statistics are gathered in such a way that comparison is almost completely useless . 
  the burden of proof is on * you * in this case , but fine .
