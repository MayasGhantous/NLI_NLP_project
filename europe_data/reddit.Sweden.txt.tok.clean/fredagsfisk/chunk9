  most likely , you are referring to another law that makes it illegal if you claim to be using a condom when you are in fact * not * using a condom . 
  there is no law saying that `` randomly breaking condom '' makes you a rapist . 
  obviously , there is no way i can provide any source for that law not existing , since ... well , it does not exist . 
  as for why the misinformation exists ; several groups with different motives have attempted to spread a lot of misinformation regarding the swedish legal system , especially in regards to sex-related laws . 
  those spreading the misinformation include ( but are not limited to ) anti-swedish groups , anti-feminist groups , wikileaks supporters and people who mean well but are simply misinformed . 
  do you have any source or proof of that , or just repeating some of the oh-so-common misinformation about our legal system and rape/sexual misconduct laws ? 
  during their work hours , they drill for oil . 
  during their free time , they * `` drill for oil '' * . 
  people are just big on traditions , i 'd guess ... taco fridays are quite common in sweden , and one chicken brand had an ad campaign to get people to eat chicken on fridays . 
  thursday is soup day , which i tend to follow as well ... that goes back to school though , and is followed in most elderly homes and such places as well . 
  tuesday used to be fish day in school though . 
  fish is very easy and quick to make though , and cheap if you buy it frozen when on sale at least , so it 's a nice friday meal that you do n't have to spend too much time on . 
  never actually had that ... mostly it 's salmon or some variation of fish 'n' chips . 
  or fish burgers if i 've been to the store that sells the ones i like . 
  i usually eat fish on friday and i miiight have made the account one hungry friday afternoon ? 
  ca n't really remember . 
  does [ bored of the rings ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bored_of_the_rings ) count ? 
  no , i probably missed that guy when i got my university degree in literature by writing a long and boring essay on some random book called the hobbit . 
  the * historical * region of \u00c1lfheimr was in areas that now belong to sweden and norway though . 
  ruled by kings like \u00c1lf , \u00c1lfgeir and gand\u00e1lf , who claimed to have elven ancestry . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%81lfheimr_ ( region ), 
  [ scandinavian miles ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scandinavian_mile ), 
  some swedish trains have braille signs on the doors , telling you it 's opened by motion detector . 
  the signs are mounted * on * the doors , right under said motion detectors , so the door automatically slides open when you try to read it . 
  his aides claim he wrote the speech himself though . 
  rafale is better than the old gripen , sure , but jas are currently developing a newer version . 
  not sure how that will stand against the rafale ( probably still not as good ) , but they 've been talking about an unmanned version as well . 
  as for the submarines ... swedish ones can be fitted with [ biological weapons ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/surstr%c3%b6mming ) , so take that !, 
  no no , let 's hear more about this ~ ~ nice boost to swedish economy ~ ~ submarine dominance plan of his , i like it . 
  it ... might be corner ? 
  sounds familiar . 
  nice burgers , anyways !, 
  alright , so to specify it better then ... they want to remain in the single market while removing that * specific part * of it . 
  it was near \u00c5hlens in the galleria ( not sure \u00c5hlens is even in the same place anymore though ) , but i think it shut down years ago . 
  phil 's burgers is a rather new place/franchise , i think ? 
  there 's supposedly on here in uppsala as well , iirc . 
  also heard some good about them , but i have n't eaten there . 
  no , immigration is under freedom of movement . 
  the problem is that they wanted to remain in the single market while * not * having freedom of movement , which eu says wo n't happen . 
  tsk , as if eskilstuna can do kebab . 
  / u/hurricanejustin if you want * really * good kebab in s\u00f6dermanland you go one town over , to str\u00e4ngn\u00e4skebaben . 
  ( e-tuna used to have some place with great burgers in the past though , but think it 's closed now ... ca n't remember what it was called ), 
  or [ nib sugar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nib_sugar ) , aka p\u00e4rlsocker, 
  well they * did * eat a lot of fish , so yes . 
  i actually read a lot about ancient roman cuisine around the time i started doing it . 
  actually , one interesting detail of ancient roman cuisine is that they used * a lot * of fermented fish sauce , [ garum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/garum ) , which later nearly disappeared from european cuisine in general . 
  it was used to season food , instead of salt , as a sauce or condiment . 
  they had four categories of it , and 3,5 liters of the finest and most expensive mackerel garum cost the same as a donkey . 
  also considered barbarian : - eating too much meat and too little veggies . 
  - butter . 
  - drinking wine not mixed with water . 
  yes . 
  his brother wanted to add sugar to make them taste better , which led to a fight and caused them to start a company each instead of working together . 
  he presented some stuff that basically every expert said would make no difference whatsoever on the situation . 
  other than that , he did multiple `` study trips '' to turkey where all expenses and schedules were blanket classified `` for national safety '' . 
  and got kicked out for hanging around with extremists , of course . 
  eh , who needs that when you have [ kopps ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=much5x98rxg ) !, 
   oh and the ireland 's gdp growth is simply mindblowing , can someone explain how they did it ? 
  having one of the lowest corporate tax rates in europe probably helped quite a bit . 
  ireland has 12,5 % while for example sweden has 22 % , finland and uk 20 % and france and belgium nearly 35 % . 
  as forbes said :  ireland 's low corporation tax of 12.5 % and a talented pool of high-tech laborers have been key factors in encouraging business investment . 
  loose tax residency requirements made ireland a common destination for international firms seeking to avoid taxation . 
  as stagnant and shitty as ever , from what i 've seen , and likely to stay that way as the government refuses to do anything to change the laws and regulations causing the situation ( there were negotiations between the government and opposition about * some * changes , but they broke down and now the government refuses to start talks again ) . 
  it also kinda feels like they avoid talking about housing politics much ever since mehmet kaplan was forced to resign as housing minister . 
  saw a ton of people on facebook who were `` extremely offended '' , some even wishing terror attacks on bbc `` so they will know how it feels '' or claiming the bbc were trying to recruit for is ... ... and also a ton of people ( incl . 
  several who said they are muslim ) who pointed out that it 's * is * that are being ridiculed and that it 's good to portray them as absolutely ridiculous . 
  geographical area ? 
  it 's about way more than that . 
  it 's about values and world views . 
  or do you * really * think nothing would change other than language and map borders ? 
  it 's 12 million over 2 years , so a 29400sek/month cost per nurse ... which would put the salary at a very low 22ksek/month if the employment fee is included in the total cost . 
  ambulances and such were called to places only to be bombarded with fireworks when arriving , so it 's certainly not just `` drunks and kids '' . 
   he still managed to get 46 % of people to vote for him . 
  well , half the people who actually voted ... the turnout was only 55 % so around 25 % of the total eligable/possible voters . 
  not that clinton was much higher ( though i 'm pretty sure the democrats could 've won with almost any other candidate , there were just too many who hates her for various reasons ) . 
  well , what used to be the historical region of alfheimr ( whose kings claimed elven ancestry ) was partially in what is now norway and partially in what is now sweden , so ... https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c1lfheimr_ ( region ), 
  giving promises to dictatorial regimes and changing foreign politics to appease other regimes for a spot on the security council is * not * a betrayal of swedish values then , according to you ? 
  france voted yes to one resolution , but abstained in the next ( which had no eu countries voting for it ) . 
   wow . 
  she voted the frikkin eu line and that makes her an antisemite o.o a line which said that all religions should have access to a holy site , not just the jewish people . 
  how antisemite of them !, 
  not a single western country voted `` yes '' to that resolution , which * directly * opposed recognition of * jewish * ( not israeli ) cultural and historical ties to the temple mount and wailing wall . 
  - constantly accuses israel of being the sole cause of any problem in the conflict ( except one single statement a couple of days ago ) . 
  - tried to have sweden be the only western country to vote `` yes '' to a un resolution to remove jewish cultural and historical ties to the temple mount and wailing wall . 
  - essentially accused israel of being an indirect cause of the paris terrorist attacks by causing radicalization ( in a situation where israel had not even been mentioned in the discussion ) . 
  - accused israel of unnecessary violence for police officers shooting palestinian terrorists who had stabbed multiple people to death and were charging at the police who shot them , yet levelled no such accusations on police doing similar things in other countries . 
  she 's anti-israeli at the very least . 
  to meet with palestinian officials . 
  she knew already that the israelis would never meet with her , so asking them to was merely a formality . 
  she 's damaged our diplomatic relations to several countries , taken obvious bribes and constantly displayed a complete disregard for swedish values while running [ anti-semitic politics ] ( https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-lagar/dokument/skriftlig-fraga/unesco-resolution-om-tempelberget-_h3111142 ) and still has a job , so why would this statement ( which * did * happen ) be any different ? 
  it 's not , though . 
  if it was just a one-time thing i could buy that it was just bad timing being used , but her constant one-sidedness against israel ( and [ hostility against jews in general ] ( https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-lagar/dokument/skriftlig-fraga/unesco-resolution-om-tempelberget-_h3111142 ) ) makes it pretty clear that she is extremely biased . 
  there is a clear pattern . 
  she 's an anti-semite who constantly blames israel for * any * issue in the middle east , [ accused them of indirectly causing the paris terrorist attacks ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-shooting-israel-sweden-iduskcn0t51rs20151116 ) and wanted ( as the only western country ) to vote `` yes '' for a [ un resolution to remove recognition of jewish cultural and historical ties to the temple mount ] ( https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-lagar/dokument/skriftlig-fraga/unesco-resolution-om-tempelberget-_h3111142 ) . 
  she has [ sold out our values ] ( http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/c-anmaler-wallstrom-till-ku-for-kampanjen/ ) , [ made promises to dictators and sucked up to whatever regime might be willing to say `` yes '' ] ( http://omni.se/auktoritara-regimer-hjalpte-sverige-till-sakerhetsradet/a/ler2x ) to get a spot on the un security council . 
  [ including saudi-arabia ] ( http://www.expressen.se/ledare/anna-dahlberg/hur-smutsig-ar-den-svenska-fn-kampanjen/ ) , while praised for `` standing up to them '' . 
  not to mention that [ obvious bribe ] ( http://www.dn.se/ekonomi/wallstroms-lagenhet-ar-en-solklar-muta/ ) she took and then got out of by playing dumb . 
  wallstr\u00f6m is nothing but an anti-semite using her position to spice up her resum\u00e9 at the expense of sweden and whoever else gets in the way . 
  she should not be in this position now , and she should not have * any * position of power in the future .
