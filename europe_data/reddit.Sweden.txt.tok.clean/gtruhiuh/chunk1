  think it 's a scandinavian petrol station thing . 
  source : \u00e5\u00e4\u00f6 . 
  and most importantly : were they truly grumpy ? 
  yoo ar rajt , aj miksed upp kounty and provins in ingliska !, 
  ajj live baj th\u00e4 slut station . 
  lol !, 
  i should go open a tobacco store in haparanda . 
  kiitos for sharing, 
  yeah , it 's kind of stupid . 
  and he too has many critics, 
  you are right , i mixed up county and province in english . 
  i no speak good americano !, 
  it 's not government that censors , but we have an old tradition of not publishing personally identifiable information for people who are not convicted , unlike in many other countries . 
  in the internet age , people will just go ahead and publish those things anyways . 
  but the principle is otherwise a honourable one . 
  it 's a forum made by some anarchist dude , and their policy is that they have free speech , period . 
  so even quite vile things are there . 
  it 's like 4chan for swedes . 
  contains a ton of normal stuff , but also some awful things . 
  generally attracts those who do n't like the concept of `` political correctness '' . 
  you 'll find communists , nazis , drug advocates and crazy religious nutjobs there , along with some normies too . 
  and a lot of 15 year old boys who think they have everything figured out . 
  i personally stay away , because people write some vile shit there , but when there are news events where media does not publish related information , you can be sure to find sources on that forum , such as in cases like this one . 
  in pictures , it 's usually women and their children yes . 
  either that or lone refugee boys , 15 year old guys . 
  fun fact : the construction company skanska which you see here and there around the world was founded as `` sk\u00e5nska '' , meaning scanian , the southernmost county in sweden . 
  svenska dagbladet means `` the swedish day-paper '' , literally . 
  sveriges radio means `` radio of sweden '' . 
  might be . 
  they are at least what is considered mainstream media, 
  dagens nyheter is definitely a credible source . 
  here is a list of well respected ones , on the top of my head . 
  you ca n't buy it in finland ?!?!? 
  do n't forget agreeing that we should give up national armies for european ones, 
  young ( 15-25-ish ) men are overrepresented in all violent crime in sweden , and so are middle-easterners , as in this case too . 
  it 's awful , but sadly not entirely unexpected ... 
  r/europe does not allow personally identifiable information , a policy which i can respect and understand . 
  in sweden , the major outlet for unrestricted information about crime is the flashback forum , which has [ a big thread on this subject ] ( https://www.flashback.org/t2804453 ) . 
  that is where most swedes go to find out the information that newspapers chose not to publish . 
  appreciate your comment !, 
  with an explanation like this it is understandable - when seeing your posts on controversial topics removed the first impulse is thinking censorship . 
  thank you for moderating this sub . 
  vetlanda is so nice !, 
  lucky you . 
  it 's pretty south though - if you make a road trip up north you 'll see some more snow for sure, 
  east germany had some spare from the ddr, 
  same same , 
  \u261d listen to this person , not me, 
  it clogs the toilet !, 
  thanks for you tip , 
  that 's sadly still the level of discussion we are having here up north :( . 
  * natural growth : +26 k ( births +108 k ; deaths -82 k ) * net migration : +104 k ( immigrants : +146 k ; emigrants : -42 k ) 146k is more than 108k , so no , immigration is bigger than babymaking . 
  also emigration is smaller than death . 
  not saying you ca n't be for open borders - that is a valid opinion to have , and i respect that . 
  but data is data , and facts are facts . 
  immigration in sweden  babymaking in sweden . 
  in it to win it , 
  you are wrong on that , see the sources in [ this discussion ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5p2gj4/the_population_of_sweden_has_officially_reached/dcnxjhg/ ) . 
  it 's ok to have different opinions , but let 's keep facts factual . 
  i 'll invade czech with a family and skis in a volvo , and then drink beer while talking about how much skiing i 'm going to do, 
  welcome !, 
  you chose a great reddit name, 
  they do . 
  my source is that i myself recently re-immigrated to sweden ( am personally so swedish i shit kalles kaviar ) . 
  if someone working at skatteverket knows better , i 'd like to learn . 
  good point !, 
  my bad, 
  it 's not because of swedes reproducing , mate ... 
  we all have an entry at skatteverket ( taxation office ) stating kalle johansson lives at lingonsyltsstigen 13 . 
  when you move home to sweden after living abroad , you go to skatteverket and re-register . 
  when we move to the other nordics , we do the same in their tax offices . 
  made a reply to u/cykaface s top level comment, 
  not an answer exactly , but somewhat is available [ in this comment , with sources ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/sweden/comments/5owb81/500_left_to_10_million_swedes_prepare_for_party11/dcn11pw/ ) . 
  basically most immigrants are from finland ( that does n't count as immigration - i know legally we are separated but in my heart not so much ) . 
  the vast majority are from the so called mena countries . 
  word spreads far about how easy it is to get a se passport so a lot of young guys are trying their luck ... after the mena guys there are poles , germans , northmen and danes !, 
  3 of 4 have better beer than we do , and one is just here to brag about their skis !, 
  i 'll let you all figure out which is which . 
   incredibly stroke of luck danish for `` swedish military genius '' ;-) good recap of history , thanks for sharing with us . 
  it should also be noted that oil companies working in norway , like any other business in high-tax countries , try to `` move '' their profit to low-or-zero tax countries by issuing debt between different subsidiaries . 
  78 % sounds high and is high , but it 's not crazy at all . 
  good for my dear neighbour :-) . 
  norway can do it . 
  without the oil you will `` only '' be like sweden & denmark . 
  finally we can have our 21 year old restaurant workers out to `` find themselves '' back !, 
  gon na have to pay off 3.1 % quick af now, 
  scary ... and a waste of police time ... 
  shall we have a small game : which european country will be first to fully legalize ? 
  i vote for estonia - they seem to * get * that freedom rocks , and be very open to smart ideas . 
  if not i suspect iceland - because they are also no-bullshitters , and not too many people to convince . 
  i 'd like to puff in their beautiful nature . 
  lastly i would guess ireland - they went hard core on bussiness liberty , i do n't see why they would n't do this as well . 
  these are my laymans thoughts for the night !, 
  cheers to all eurofriends . 
  would like to read more about that , as i have a good friend west of fl\u00e4llen who likes to toke it up . 
  here is [ another interesting list on wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_real_gdp_growth_rate ) . 
  one interesting country is belarus . 
  this whole communist dictatorship thing does not seem to be working out all that grand .
