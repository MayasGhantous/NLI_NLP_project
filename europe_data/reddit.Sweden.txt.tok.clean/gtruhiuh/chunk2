  i 've never been to belarus , and not going to bother going to a country requiring you to get a visa for a visit ( lol !, 
  ai n't nobody got time for that ) , but i 'd be curious to learn more about their situation . 
  interesting to see how the western and eastern bloc nations have fared since the cold war . 
  my northerner pal estonia seems to have been doing very well . 
  my esti friend told me about their alko-taxi , a boat serving finns with cheap booze . 
  free market at it 's best !, 
  in my newspaper here in sweden , there were a ton of articles for a while about how estii schools were superior to ours , even if we spend more money on ours . 
  `` what can we learn from them '' and so on . 
  cheers to all eurofriends out there . 
  speaking of which , here is [ a great british radio show about billy the bookcase from ikea ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04nmxy2 ), 
  good to be the top bun in the sandwich, 
  suck it , other scandilosers !, 
  something akin to denmark , australia or japan . 
  basically open borders for skilled workers , but not for others . 
  but before the 2018 election , i guess i have some reading to do wrt moderaterna , so i could be wrong . 
  true true, 
  that depends on * how strict * you mena . 
  many nations have shameful pasts - few acknowledge it . 
  britain , france , spain & nl have colonizing pasts that are worse than the nazi holocaust - the rwandan genocide , stalin and mao were both much worse in terms of the amount of carnage . 
  my country ( sweden ) has a horrible history of mistreating the same people ( aka lapp - hence the name `` lapland '' for what maybe should be called `` same land '' ) . 
  but many people from those countries do n't accept it as a bad thing - and many are even proud . 
  shit was bad yo !, 
  til , sadly :( . 
  while that might be true , since they are already part of the political elite in germany , i 'm sure many think of a vote for them is a vote for the status quo . 
  it ai n't easy , that 's what it is !, 
  germans should be fucking proud of how they are handling their genocide . 
  many nations have dark histories , but very few own up to it . 
  mad respect to . de for that . 
  now the question is : how can i vote for a restrictive policy for asylum seekers , without getting this grab-bag of loonies in the mix ? 
  we have the same problem in sweden - only one party which does not have a super-liberal immigration policy - but it 's also the party that has a bunch of crazy `` ex '' - nazis . 
  sitting in my lonely chamber i yearn for more direct influence over how i 'm governed . 
  like choosing different representatives for different topics , or actually being allowed to vote on individual motions in the parlament instead of just choosing a representative . 
  all we have is ** now ** . 
  `` celebrating my heritage '' is more about the now than it is about the past , at least in reality ( even if we have ideas about `` past '' - but ideas are only something existing in the ** now ** as well ) . 
  heritage is also something that only exists ** now ** - the way i celebrate my old traditions is not how they were celebrated in 1300 , and when i try to celebrate like it was 1399 , i 'm actually not . 
  i 'm celebrating like it was 2017 , and the imagined past is part of that . 
  celebrating oktoberfest as part of your heritage is n't * really * about doing the same thing as grandpa 's grandpa , but about the community that you are in ** now ** . 
  but i definitely understand what you mean as well . 
  are n't you using the language of the english ? 
  it was a joke !, 
  i can only say the same  . 
  been there thrice , only on the east coast so far . 
  cheers !, 
  abschluss ( or absclu\u00df ) means finishing something . 
  welcome to europe and r/europe !, 
  amazon.de it is, 
  how does that work for northern ireland ? 
  seems easiest to trade it to roi in exchange for an underwater pipeline of guinness . 
  i 'll be over for a beer if you 'll airbnb me, 
  time for bayexit ? 
  * not at all . 
  the only use of christianity we have is that we take days off on christian holidays . 
  but it is cultural heritage and as such has a very special place , which is not true for `` newer '' religions here ( such as islam or new-age religions ) . 
  * russia is definitely european , as much as france , england or portugal . 
  it 's a shame the cold war separated europe as much as it did . 
  * good . 
  also love not living with them lol . 
  * we have a culture of being independent , but not the same as in america . 
  here if you live with your parents after 20 people people shake their heads . 
  i hear it 's different in the south - the banter goes that in italy they live with mama until 30 . 
  * guess why you want to move out asap ?!, 
  * cousins - close . 
  one step further : no contact basically . 
  sad !, 
  nope . 
  here in scandinavia it 's mostly hunters on the countryside who own them , and recently immigrant gangsters in the newly formed ghettos . 
  very sad :( . 
  no such thing - weddings are not about contracts or anything . 
  do n't ask me what girls care about - i never seem to understand what they want anyways ... 3 . 
  not forgotten . 
  i think the main reason why we are happy to give up national rule for european rule is because anything is better than killing each other . 
  sometimes feeling queasy about power moving further away from the people , but anything beats wars so i 'm ok with the eu . 
  we do have elections for the eu , we chose the parties to sit in the parlament . 
  i 'd like more direct democracy , but for now representative democracy has to suffice . 
  not a threat , people vote for what they wish . 
  i 'm freelancing , and the client is in london . 
  i got a 20 % salary decrease after the vote , and when we made the next contract they got a 25 % price increase from me . 
  wish it was n't so . 
  wish they 'd stay , but it 's their choice and i respect that . 
  not with erdogan acting the way he does . 
  turkey is always switching between being european and arab . 
  lately they seem to be leaning more to arabia . 
  ireland is a tax haven while being inside of the eu - so you 'll find a lot of international business there . 
  great if you want to work in it . 
  iceland not so much . 
  afaik they support themselves thru tourism and fishing , as well as bj\u00f6rk record sales . 
  fish is nice , it 's a great island to visit as a tourist , and bj\u00f6rk ... 
  i 'd lie if i did n't say i have a life-long crush on that girl ... 
  there is no one place to startups . 
  you 'll find the funding capital in london or stockholm . 
  you 'll find the coolest hacks and cheap apartments in berlin . 
  extremely good . 
  have never been that far away from home , but my father has been there for work many times . 
  brings home the best food . 
  have had a lot of work mates from india , all of whom have been cool guys . 
  many beers have been had . 
  i feel close to my other nordic friends - estonia , finland , norway , denmark , iceland , greenland & the faroe islands . 
  i see those nations as my brothers and sisters . 
  weirdly enough , some voice inside of me wants to count the netherlands in there as well ... 2 . 
  i think pretty good - since we are all afraid of china running ahead of us and russia starting world war 3 ( they are already waging war in europe - in eastern ukraine ) .
