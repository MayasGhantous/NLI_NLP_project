  i was always more into computers than sports , ca n't answer sorry . 
  there are some homeless here , but honestly it 's either because you are an illegal immigrant and not working ( only a problem since the refugee thing started recently ) or you are a drug addict who fails to accept the help the government is giving you . 
  the government will give you many chances at getting free housing if you ca n't afford it , but some mentally ill or drug addicted seem to fall thru the cracks anyways . 
  very few compared to in the south though ( likely because of the cold in the winter ) . 
  yeah , mainly government contracts being handed to someones cousins construction company or so . 
  but in general it 's amongst the least corrupt in the world , and if you ask me it 's because of a culture where corruption and dishonesty is shameful . 
  super chill . 
  it 's really not about butt-in-seat-hours but coming up with a clever solution to a problem . 
  one of the better parts of life here . 
  ruby on rails is a hit in the software world as well . 
  over in sweden i guess erlang is something too . 
  how efficient and mechanized everything is . 
  best and worst thing . 
  food !, 
  see [ my other comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5nfyxe/cultural_exchange_with_rindia_come_and_join_us/dcjda9b/?utm_content=permalink&amp;utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=europe ) . 
  maybe check out [ \u00d6land ] ( https://youtu.be/c_7zozxeqhq ) ( literarily means `` island-land '' ) . 
  it 's the only place in the country with an official desert , so that 's something . 
  i want my country to be a big vacuum cleaner sucking up all the skilled labour . 
  have had many colleagues from around the world ( many from india as well ! ), 
  and they 're all great . 
  for the indian coworkers , i 'm especially jealous every time i sniff them opening their lunch boxes ... yum !, 
  do n't have any reason , but screw those guys, 
  the mushroom thing is false . 
  please do tell me what your best mushroom picking spot it ? 
  i 'm your friend and promise i will not go there . 
  please tell me in a private message . 
  i will not sweep the area . 
  * cough *, 
  no answer - but belgians have blessed us with the most amazing beers in the world . 
  i 'm forever thankful - my liver not so much . 
  our two nations are the ones who have had the most wars of any nations in the world . 
  used to be a law here in sweden forbidding murder , except for danes . 
  nowadays it 's mainly banter , as denmark is our big lovely liqueur store . 
  jokes aside , i love the danish , it 's the most liveable nordic country of them all . 
  very much yeah . 
  maybe next generation of kids wo n't feel that ? 
  you 're supposed to drink beer instead !, 
  because they are so expensive :( . 
  ** 1 : ** i 'm swedish . 
  used to think we should be kind and open to everybody - but since living in other countries , and being with foreigners ( and being one myself ) i 've realized you must be restrictive . 
  i 'll open my door to anyone who can apply for a visa and contribute to society - but honestly , i do n't see why we should be obliged to accept those who ca n't . 
  especially since we provide housing , food , money , education for free ( we do n't want to have poverty , so we got to make sure people do n't be poor ) . 
  there is a ton on indian people who live here working in the it and software business , and i 'm very happy to have those guys as my colleagues . 
  ** 2 : ** honestly , i think swedish food is the bomb . 
  it 's not so famous in other countries , likely because swedes are not into moving abroad and being chefs as much as other nationalities are . 
  also because it 's probably not easy to pronounce all the shit we eat . 
  go to ikeas food section and buy you some * herring in glass jar * fresh potato ( the small kind . 
  normal peasant potato is ok if you must ) * dill ( [ it has differnet names in india ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dill#asian_cooking ) ) * sour cream * lingonberry jam * maybe some meatballs as well - they also carry vegetarian ones ( lots of veggiebros in india i 've heard ! ), 
  * akvavit ( also known as `` snaps '' ) , hard alcohol boil the potato , and sprinkle the dill on it . 
  serve the herring room-tempered , fry the meat balls , and put it all on a plate . 
  serve the snaps in small glasses , and have beer on the side as a chaser . 
  sing a [ snaps-song ] ( https://youtu.be/wr0knkfygvq?t=59s ) , shout `` sk\u00e5l ! '', 
  and drink . 
  then feast !, 
  not meaning to tour my own horn , but this is my favourite food in the whole world . 
  ** 3 : ** check '' [ en man som heter ove ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4080728/ ) '' out - i hear it 's popular abroad . 
  in english that 'd be `` a man named ove '' . 
  for books , i do n't know ... 
  i found [ hundra\u00e5ringen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_hundred-year-old_man_who_climbed_out_the_window_and_disappeared ) to be very entertaining when i read it - so easy to read and funny , had me laughing out loud for a good couple of afternoons . 
  very digestible and fun book . 
  currently renting my flat , but when i turn into a * real * adult and buy a home , you can bet your dirty asshole i 'm getting one of those [ japanese toilets ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xnm1sypnwe ) . 
  erdogan used the religion card in his campaigning , and has his base support amongst countryside muslims . 
  it 's been a bad winter so far !, 
  you bring water and warm clothes . 
  i bring a bag of buns as well . 
  i think no one wants to hinder consenting adults to do it . 
  but infants are not really able to make that choice . 
  it 's just so weird , that 's all !, 
  and cruel , against defenseless infants . 
  god first created us in his image , and it was perfect . 
  then he realized he used the stretch tool in his cad program too much , but the model was already sent to the 3d printer . 
  thus he required it be a holy law that you should use a knife to cut your children . 
  i 've heard hard core jews still do it . 
  and americans . 
  do n't know though - and would like to learn more about what groups cut their newborns . 
   sure , when you 're talking about things that cause damage or harm others . 
  circumcision does n't do that . 
  of course it does !, 
  if not - please go ahead and cut your own foreskin or corpus carvernosum ( sorry , do n't know the english name for clit skin ), 
  ok - that 's super confusing, 
  i would have left after five minutes . 
  wish that my head of state ( carl xvi gustaf ) would have done the same . 
  no point in being polite to people who themselves are not . 
  also did n't see it as first - but it says in the second header that it 's in hours : minutes . 
  well , they did bring peace to the middle east , so ... / s, 
  while it 's upsetting that the mother did n't consent - the real issue really ** is ** that no one ever asks the boys consent - which he would anyways be too young to give . 
  it 's a barbaric thing that disgusts many of us and we would like to see the practice abandoned in our europe . 
   male fgm if only there was a male letter to replace the f with in this acronym ... 
   nearly every male gets circumcised without his prior agreement . 
  only in certain religions and in usa . 
   your wrong there did you mean to write `` you 're '' or is this some high level english language shizz , meaning that `` wrong '' is a noun that gp possesses ? 
  thanks from esl-man, 
  is there no difference in pouring a bit of water on ones head and mutilating the genitalia ? 
  make circumsicion of underage kids illegal !, 
  how that can be accepted in the 21st century is beyond me . 
  they 're kids !, 
  in my language ( swedish ) and in my 3rd language ( german ) this is how we say it - although spelled in local ways . 
  that 's nice !, 
  but what is the use of having regulated ones on top of that ? 
  that is the question to which i do n't know the answer .
