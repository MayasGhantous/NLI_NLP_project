  i know , it 's a shitty party trick , but that 's all i 've got . 
  i 'm not an exciting person . 
   but the current geopolitical situation is forcing us to look west , not east . 
  just wanted to slightly nudge you in the direction of thought that the choice of whom to dislike and which historical acts to condemn and demand apologies for might be a political one . 
  i see i did n't really have to try hard . 
  the members of the squadron that shot down the most german planes in the battle of britain were n't invited to the victory parade in london just to make the dude on the right happy . 
  that 's how i always see the smiles on that picture , that it is just after they agreed to that little bonus kick in the nuts . 
  why is n't the same anger directed towards the follow up pact and [ the three happy dudes that signed it ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/yalta_conference_%28churchill%2c_roosevelt%2c_stalin%29_%28b%26w%29.jpg ) . 
  i always wonder when i read statements from gazprom . 
  is it a threat this time or a technical analysis ? 
  i would buy the shit out of dziugas if it was available in sweden , but it is n't . 
  one of the best cheeses i 've ever tasted . 
  only cancer risk shown in research has been pancreatic cancer . 
  mouth and throat cancers have been suggested , but there is no strong evidence . 
  there were a bunch of studies that showed all other kinds of cancers but they were shot down because they did n't control for higher percentage of smokers among people who use snus . 
  other than that it has the usual cardio-vascular problems that nicotine use causes . 
  and diabetes . 
  there is only one form of cancer that has been linked to snus . 
  pancreatic cancer . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anthroposophy it 's a philosophy bordering on religion with lots of pseudo-scientific ideas , alternative medicine and other weird ideas . 
  they do export energy . 
  just not in a form that you normally think about . 
  it 's interesting how much easier it is to get beer from brewdog in sweden than it 's in the uk and even scotland . 
  i do n't recall going beer shopping in the past few years without ending up with some beer from them . 
  and i ca n't think of a pub that cares about quality beer that does n't have something from them . 
  stockholm even ended up with the first brewdog pub outside of the uk . 
  i 'd vote for delirium tremens as my favorite belgian beer . 
  dangerously easily drinkable . 
  this should n't have been a surprise to anyone who 's been interested in fra and nsa . 
  one of the main unresolved traumas during the cold war in sweden was the [ catalina affair ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalina_affair ) which started with the soviets shooting down a dc-3 that was flying over the baltic sea . 
  the dc-3 had personnel from fra with equipment from nsa ( or whatever their predecessor was called at that time ) . 
  it 's been an open secret that fra works with nsa . 
  sweden has a very good position to listen to all soviet radio around the baltic . 
  i do n't see why they would n't keep working together after the cold war . 
  a few years ago i read an interview with a swedish marine officer ( i tried to find it , but my google-fu is bad today ) who was basically accusing fra of giving more information to nsa than the swedish military . 
  he handled it quite gracefully though . 
  and the media were nice about it too . 
  there were some laughs and life moved on . 
  not entirely . 
  one thing that could be counted as part of the shadow economy are things that are sold second hand . 
  since theoretically people should be paying taxes on that but they do n't and it is n't enforced . 
  i kind of wonder though if that 's accounted here since reselling used stuff is n't strictly gdp material . 
  if it was blocket.se would account for 60 % of the shadow economy in sweden according to [ their own data ] ( http://www.mynewsdesk.com/se/pressroom/blocket/pressrelease/view/begagnathandeln-slaar-nytt-rekord-826999 ) . 
  but that 's definitely shadow economy , stuff that would be taxed if the government could control everything , but is n't because it 's not worth the effort . 
   the fee is automatically deducted from your salary , as a tax . 
  the only scenario i can think of when it 's deducted from your salary is if you have n't paid it long enough that you end up in debt collection . 
  i think my friend from texas has the best term for icelanders ( this was during the financial crisis ) : snow mexicans . 
  i linked the version with english subtitles in the parent of the post you commented . 
  worse quality , but the subtitles makes it slightly more accessible to everyone . 
  he 's originally from greenland which is danish . 
  close enough . 
  did n't know this . 
  but still , c # is comprehensible and consistent enough to not invoke the kameloso frustration . 
  they are responsible for the programming languages [ php ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rasmus_lerdorf ) and [ c++ ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bjarne_stroustrup ) which must have surely been inspired by their [ incomprehensible language ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-moy8vuebk ) . 
  this makes it perfectly proper to use [ `` danskj\u00e4vlar !, 
  '' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbcjz3-cjkc ) as the cry of frustration when debugging someone elses code written in those languages . 
  this might not be surprising since you actually have to be a genius to learn to [ count in danish ] ( http://satwcomic.com/just-a-number ) . 
  they have [ bridges that are higher ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_belt_fixed_link ) than the highest point in the country . 
  they smoke and drink a lot which apparently makes them happy . 
  yeah . 
  that 's a stupid headline . 
  it 's not the swedish government . 
  it 's a company owned by the government . 
  it 's like saying `` uk government kills man '' after a post truck runs someone over . 
   political considerations which was the whole point . 
  there 's no such thing as `` total war scenario '' . 
  that 's what i mean with a `` video game war '' . 
  if you look at the world through movies and video games , then yes , the us can `` devastate any nation on earth '' and uk can send 5 % of their army to rape , pillage and burn all of iceland . 
  if you look at economic , political and diplomatic reality it 's not going to happen . 
  the us are only barely getting away with invading brown peoples dictatorships and even then it 's stretching it very thin economically and politically . 
  if they tried anything against people who wear jeans , listen to the same music as them and can quote the same movies they watch in decent english it would be political suicide . 
  which brings us neatly back to the cod wars . 
  maybe it was n't a real war . 
  and yes , the british navy could have sunk every coast guard boat from iceland . 
  but doing that would be political suicide for any officer and politician involved . 
  so it did n't happen . 
  so the icelanders won . 
  talking about military might when solving problems between civilized countries is about as useful as talking about how strong you are and that you can definitely beat up a child . 
  while technically correct it 's probably the stupidest thing you can do when everyone is watching . 
  yes , they would win a video game war . 
  now , why did n't us win in afghanistan ? 
  because life is not a video game . 
  why did n't russia win in afghanistan ? 
  because life is n't a video game . 
  just like the cod wars were n't a video game and the uk lost . 
  switzerland is n't that bad compared to norway . 
  [ relevant hipster hitler ] ( http://hipsterhitler.com/comics/juice/ ), 
  it 's a very common thing i see in poland . 
  at least listening to my mother , father and everyone ( one or two exceptions ) they associate with . 
  it 's never individuals that do something that they happen to dislike , it 's always `` the germans '' , `` the russians '' , `` the jews '' , etc. 
  it 's like their minds ca n't comprehend that different people can have thoughts , ideas and actions of their own . 
  everyone is collectively responsible for every action of everyone who happens to share a label in their mind . 
  except the polish of course , anything bad that a polish person does is either because it 's an `` old communist '' , `` jew '' or otherwise ignorable . 
  and since there 's a collective guilt , someone seen as the head of that collective is personally responsible for everything that everyone under the same label does . 
  yes , i do realize that not living in the country i do n't have a representative sample . 
  but i have n't spoken to anyone above the age of 40 in or from poland in the past 5 years , except my aunt , who did n't show symptoms of this pattern of thinking . 
  i do n't think you understand what `` second language '' means . 
  a `` second language '' , believe it or not , is the language you learned to speak second , after you learned to speak your first language . 
  there is no way for a `` second language '' to become a `` first language '' without inventing time travel . 
  i speak my second and third languages better than i speak my first .
