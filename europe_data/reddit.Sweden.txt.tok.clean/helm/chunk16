  same in sweden . 
  sweden does !, 
  come to daddy ... 
  basically , common sense applies . 
  if you can be seen or heard from the where people live , you 're too close . 
  smoking dominates in the us . 
  among the engineering majors my year ( 1998 ) there were about 5 smokers out of 150 students . 
  second place to denmark ? 
  smoking on international flight was allowed on aeroflot up to the mid 00 's . 
  a friend of mine flew from moscow to tokyo with 50 or so smokers in the plane 2002 . 
  needs more european, 
  i think sa meant carbon-monoxide . 
  grow up and eat your broccoli !, 
  the only ones ever giving swedish people flak for `` weak coffee '' would be finns . 
  tyrkisk peber is five minutes in . 
  i loved how he first was worried after licking it , and then his face crumpled when he had a bite . 
  and all the tunnels . 
  with inside information i can tell you that they do n't report their own speeding . 
  1992 , the world ( sssr ) was collapsing and most russians did n't care much for church dogma . 
  `` procedures will not be recorded anywhere '' ... 
  that 's almost only eastern ukraine , and that is a poor place with little outlook . 
  that was n't cows , that was death yaks !, 
  hence the smiley ... 
  i scottish guy commented on how the conversation pattern among his friends in scotland made him depressed . 
  always the butt of a joke , etc. 
  hey now , skype is swedish/estonian , 
  not always . 
  in a context where one of the words fit to a sentence with a different meaning it can get confusing . 
  fra will get you , little norwegian conspirator . 
  one problem is that many go from stating facts : gypsies living a traditional life style are in general poorly educated - to prescribing intent : gypsies do n't want education . 
  the issue is usually much more complicated than that . 
  it would be absurd to say that `` swedes do n't want to win the world cup '' , just because we never have . 
  i appreciate that you 're thoughtful about it at least . 
  my comment was n't exactly the most popular , but i 'm fairly well-read on the intellectual discourse of the early 1900th century , so i 'm not trying to put labels on people just for the heck of it . 
  yeah . 
  at that time `` cockroach '' was the most popular term afaik , but i 'm sure they used body vs disease metaphors as well . 
  it 's sad that so many people do n't understand how persecuted the jews were pre wwii . 
  people in western democracies would say stuff like `` oh , the nazis seem frightfully aggressive , but at least their dealing with the jewish problem , we 're far too lenient ! '', 
  using strong terminology against certain ethnic groups is like dividing by something close to zero . 
  either a tide of upvotes roll in , or a tide of downvotes . 
  it 's both fascinating and scary , because europe is getting decidedly more ethnocentric/monoculturalist these days . 
  but bodies do n't get rid of `` diseases '' by moving them or integrating , or whatever , diseases should be terminated . 
  i claim that the body analogy of the society is tainted with a dehumanizing world view . 
  it was a joke , meaning `` it is n't what 's true that matters , it 's what sounds true to you '', 
  you could say the same about jews . 
  they also reinforce themselves . 
  nope , only the kind that sorts people into races . 
  because throwing stereotypes around is not consequence free . 
  truthiness is what matters . 
  downvoted for using 1920 's racist terminology . 
  `` the west 's immune system is incapable of handling the threat '' . 
  this is the terminology that brought around the holocaust . 
  you have a point there . 
  how to measure it correctly is another question . 
  social mobility in the us is still lower than in most european countries . 
  exception : teenage pregnancies . 
  britain has the most in europe , netherlands the fewest . 
  yeah , by fine i mean `` fine for now '' . 
  the budget deficits they run are not sustainable . 
  but when dealing with a population that saves too much ( from a certain point of view ) , what can they do ? 
  usually only the biggest economies can manage to finance a big deficit in their own currency . 
  sweden 's crisis was also a banking crisis , the government helped several banks and nationalized one of them , so there was n't much private capital in sweden at the time . 
  states borrow money by issuing obligations -- problem was that there was very few buyers in sweden at the time . 
  nope , we were borrowing in world currencies , mostly dollars and pounds . 
  better interest rates , but the currency risk was on the swedish state . 
  the swedish krona was dropping like a stone at the time , no-one wanted to sign a billion ( dollar ) bond in sek . 
  japan is fine because its citizens are buying all the bonds it issues . 
  other countries would n't be able to borrow as much from their citizens . 
  when the swedish state finances went shit in the early 90s , we were unable to borrow any meaningful amount in country . 
  we had to go abroad . 
  had there been a more global crisis back then we would have been screwed . 
  that 's kind of my point . 
  if both the state and the private sector is heavily indebted , things are very bad . 
  in japan you have the reverse situation : private savings are very high , but public debt is 200 % of gdp . 
  i do n't see it in moralistic terms . 
  the borrowing for housing is very high in sweden , but the vast majority of those loans are being paid year after year , and there 's no ticking time-bomb like it was in the us , with loan agents selling to clients with a very poor outlook and offering `` 1 % interest the first year ! '' . 
  income security is better here . 
  it 's the low interest rate that is driving the prices , basically . 
  today it 's not * that * easy to get a loan ; i had to work hard for a relatively small loan that was slightly over 70 % of the value , and i 'm regularly employed with a decent salary . 
  anyway , the main reason that i do n't wish for a crash is that what can cause it is mainly recession and unemployment , or a long-term rise in interest rates . 
  i see recession as a greater risk than interest rates . 
  public debt is low , however . 
  the swedish government still has * some * control over the housing market ( to fuel it or cool it ) , so i 'm cautiously optimistic . 
  i 'm not hoping for a rally , however . 
  yeah , [ sandhamn ] ( http://stockholms-skargard.se/images/sandhamn.1.jpg ) , a village on a small island in the stockholm archipelago , is ridiculously picturesque in how small houses of similar style are cobbled together on an island . 
  you can walk on narrow paths between the houses , and then suddenly you see the ocean on the other side of a house . 
  i know lithuania is in slightly better shape than ukraine , but private houses in ukraine often look like shit on the exterior . 
  i 'd say 1-2 % have all of these : good looking paint job , nice windows and roof and a nice garden that 's not a local dump . 
  many apartments and houses look great on the inside , but the exterior ... 
  the picture `` cheap housing from the 60 's and 70 's '' is from miljonprogrammet . 
  not the * least * flattering angle , but never the less . 
  yeah , but similar larger ones would be regular house in the countryside . 
  some more depressing ones : [ cheap housing in karlstad ] ( http://www.godbostad.se/bilder/godbostad_orrholmen-karlstad.gif ) [ collapsed barn ] ( http://cdn1.cdnme.se/cdn/9-2/645475/images/2010/dsc_0041_95561174.jpg ), 
  well , i did n't post images of `` ugly swedish houses '' . 
  we have those too . 
  some pictures from a town in sweden + traditional swedish houses : [ retro-modern small houses ] ( http://www.busspojken.com/stad/nykoping/669-08.jpg ) [ modern , rebuilt silo ] ( http://www.fastighetsvarlden.se/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/silon.jpg ) [ cheap housing from the 60 's and 70 's ] ( http://www.busspojken.com/stad/nykoping/375-36.jpg ) [ traditional red houses with white corners ] ( http://www.dn.se/images/images/91/22/86219.jpg ), 
  funny , hundk\u00e4x and hundkex are both fine , but i think hundk\u00e4x is more common , while lex is more common than k\u00e4x ... btw , there was a time when system could be spelt syst\u00e4m , and most people pronounced it like `` syst\u00e4m '' , but system prevailed and now the pronunciation has changed . 
  k\u00e4x and kex are both fine , my impression is just that `` k\u00e4x '' goes with the * wrong * pronunciation . 
  kex , goddammit , and the '' k ' is hard like in `` cakes '' . 
  r\u00e4ls comes from rails too,
