  the militants within pkk seems to have taken the stance to equate isis and the turkish state , while erdogan et al now strikes at both at the same time , hoping that the attack on isis will cover their attempts to take away parliamentary power from the hdp . 
  i 'm not surprised to see this development and was disappointed when i heard about the attack on the police officers . 
  he may be exaggerating , of course , but the specific claim is `` russian leaders have read their goebbels and are using his rhetorical tools when addressing people '', 
  antisemitism was not the concern of this person , it was the ever harsher nationalistic propaganda . 
  do n't buy them , then . 
  with two kids and not much of a car interest i 'm happy to own a toyota that i can forget between getting somewhere and the yearly service . 
  hmm , i meant `` not incompetent '' . 
  as in , if he actually had a decent agenda , he could have pulled through . 
  some politicians have good agendas , but lack the ability to see it happen . 
  africans + muslims = 2 billion people already . 
  let 's make generalizations about the uniform populations of europe , north + south america , korea and japan . 
  the whole cuckold imagery is meant to provoke a emotional , defensive reaction . 
  if you believe in it , you 're accepting manipulation . 
  this is my impression about him too . 
  he 's not a bad politician , he can get things done , sometimes even good things . 
  but he gives the impression of being the world largest narcissist , making italian politics an endless circus with him in the center , and all of italy 's concerns just one of the clowns , the women , lawsuits and moves to save his own skin played larger roles . 
  putin and berlusconi really like each other , though . 
  as for the minister post , i do n't think he 'll hand it out like christmas present . 
  i agree with the claims you make about the science . 
  however , i strongly disagree with your conclusions . 
  visual stimuli , for example , is much more important for men . 
  the experiment you reference take a robust indicator for men and applies it , as if it were robust , on women . 
  [ this study is very interesting too ] ( http://www.livescience.com/22120-eyes-reveal-sexual-orientation.html ) basically , heterosexual women show arousal to both women and men , and do not conform to the same categories as men do . 
  yes , read memes , become enlightened . 
  i would say berlusconi 's speciality is opinion management through media dominance . 
  this sits well with putin . 
  story in english : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/11758227/berlusconi-says-vladimir-putin-wants-him-to-become-russias-economy-minister.html, 
  no , germany is pretty old-fashioned when it comes to employment . 
  i think it boils down to drinking habits and violence . 
  the baltics do have a high murder rate . 
  usually , men kill other men . 
  [ this suggests otherwise ] ( http://www.microbiomejournal.com/content/2/1/41 ) edit : this was also interesting : https://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/3718111.html basically , when reducing the sample to matched couples only , men and women agreed on everything except the fidelity of the woman . 
  what 's true ? 
  men 's suspicions ( rate of infidelity among women as high as among men ) or what the women self-report ( about a quarter of this ) . 
  you know it 's completely possible for a woman to experience genital arousal when raped , right ? 
  the research you 're citing basically says that the what 's going on in the brain is more important to women than what 's going on in the genitals . 
  this has no impact at all on truthfulness in other regards , such as if someone is faithful or what party they 're going to vote for . 
  i do n't think it 's that easy , men and women both lie , but differently . 
  the typical statistic being number of sex partners - men exaggerate while women lie in the other direction . 
  the amount of lying is probably cultural too . 
  yeah , in reality * everyone * cheats * all the time * , no ? 
  those rates seem really high to me . 
  figures from sweden i found are 37 % for men and 22 % for women . 
  an interesting fact ( iod ? ), 
  from that page was `` 3 % of men who go through with a divorce end up marrying their mistress '' . 
  you can imagine the percentage that say `` yes , i 'll get a divorce and we 'll get together '' and the actually go through with the divorce and marrying their mistress . 
  yep , semper is trying to export as much baby milk ( and similar products ) as they can , but apparently the red tape is not easy to navigate . 
  a misunderstanding , it seems . 
  no , i meant `` syr '' - but apparently that 's ukrainian . 
  my in-laws are russian-speaking ukrainians , so i assumed it was russian . 
  i never figured out that it is the same as kvarg . 
  ouch . 
  swedish milk farmers are probably toast soon . 
  yup , brunost . 
  you 're right , it 's not a true cheese . 
  you should try cheese from different areas . 
  you 'd understand better that nordic hard cheese ( primarily norwegian , swedish and finnish ) is a type not too far from the dutch , only with different flavorings . 
  danish cheese , on the other hand , is more strange . 
  we also have [ this kind of cheese ] ( http://www.spisa.nu/productimages/pfi_10261_3.jpg ) . 
  interesting . 
  russian white cheese is not like feta at all . 
  russian cheese = white cheese to me . 
  the type that 's sweet and crumbles . 
  are you saying you ca n't work politically in germany to change the law on home schooling ? 
  of course * that * is not the issue . 
  what you ca n't do ignore a law ( sending your kids to school ) and then claim prosecution . 
  as for disobeying laws , [ conscientious objection ] ( http://www.connection-ev.org/article-1361 ) has some protection in europe , [ and in the us ] ( http://www.californiaimmigrationlawyerblog.com/2014/07/political-asylum-based-fear-serving-military.html ) . 
  however , no political body has raised the right to educate your own children to the same status . 
  unmentioned danish movie : [ the celebration ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0154420/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 ) the first , and the best dogma 95 movie . 
  unmentioned swedish movie ( ok , ok ! ), 
  [ let the right one in ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1139797/?ref_=nv_sr_1 ), 
  discrimination is rarely , if ever , the basis for asylum . 
  persecution and war it . 
  even gays that live in countries that has death penalty for homosexual acts are regularly sent back if it is assumed that they can hide it . 
  grounds for asylum are more of the type `` my village was destroyed and they 're rounding up the survivors '' . 
   it was why the us denied asylum to a german family who wanted to home school their kids ??? 
  a sudanese ( or whatever ) family would never be granted asylum in sweden , nor the us , on those grounds . 
  i 'm all for making life hard for the islamists/salafists , but what you are suggesting if effectively and end to religious freedom . 
  there are tens of thousands of recent christian and muslim immigrants that get along just fine , this news is pretty exceptional . 
  who knows , it could be part of a trend , but right now it does n't appear to be the case . 
  the news paper also states that this problem is not very common . 
  we 've accepted a large number of christian and muslim refugees for two decades now . 
  why not just summarily execute them while we 're at it ? 
  i mean , we 're done with pretending to care , after all . 
  i think `` instructive '' or `` illuminating '' are decent synonyms . 
  yes , 2013 , 2014 and this year , all record years , due to syria , although many come from somalia as well . 
  and no , it is n't sustainable in the long term . 
  so , to recapitulate : * 1992-1995 war in the balkans , many immigrants * 2007 peak of iraq exodus * 2013 - war in syria then there 's somalia and afghanistan the last decade . 
  ah , sorry , there was a peak in 2007 also with refugees from iraq . 
  yes , you see those two earlier peaks ? 
  that was the balkan wars . 
  the fact is that the number of [ refugees in the world has increased ] ( http://www.unhcr.org.uk/about-us/key-facts-and-figures.html ) , and that other european countries , except germany , has adopted much harsher restrictions on asylum seekers . 
  why do you think swedish politicians lobby for other countries to accept more refugees ? 
  precisely because that 's the solution you 'd want to see if you recognize both that there are refugees that are in need of asylum and that you ' r own country ca n't provide for them all . 
  economic immigration from outside the eu is highly restricted . 
  if people lie , then it 's a matter of sorting them out . 
  the huge number of syrians are unrelated to economic migrants . 
  the last big wave of asylum seekers we had was during the balkan wars . 
  did someone make these conflicts up ? 
  some kind of policy change is to be expected , yes .
