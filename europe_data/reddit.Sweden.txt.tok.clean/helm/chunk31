  on nigeria , it 's likely that the population of nigeria is n't all of 174 million . 
  there 's been a lot of incentive to spoof the statistic in the censuses ( more pop in your district =  more power to you , essentially ) . 
  one of their censuses was even scrapped because the numbers were too low . 
  from a military point of view , the iraq campaign was a beautifully orchestrated success . 
  the consequence analysis and state building failed , though . 
  russia has adopted vassalage ... now it 's only ten centuries behind . 
  would this still give the maximum sentence in spain ? 
  probably not . 
  can confirm , bathing in the baltic sea outside stockholm . 
  now and two months ago too . 
  you mean we have to hope zlatan is in a good mood ? 
  there 's nothing until september . 
  i wonder what course the old soviet guard would have set russian on , though . 
  congrats on the win against russia recently . 
  we hope to join you . 
  what would have happened if he had n't and the parliament had won ? 
  it 's the same in swedish , although the foreign nature of the word reduces the stigma considerably . 
  at least you do n't have the word `` groupie '' yet . 
  in the meaning of a selfie taken of a group ... 
  in sweden , the lowest denomination is 1 sek . 
  but electronic transactions are still counted down to 1/100 sek ( \u00f6re ) . 
  everyone uses debit cards , so rounding does n't affect much . 
  there 's no direct connection . 
  sweden has very high private debt , but it 's tightly coupled to real estate assets . 
  few apartment and house owners are debt-free . 
   this means taking money from the rich and give it to the `` poor '' not really - sweden took money from the rich ( taxes ) and the poor ( spending cuts ) and gave it to the state . 
  cut expenses , raise taxes . 
  after 2006 , taxes has been lowered . 
  private debt has gone up because of a real estate boom . 
  not so much a building boom , but a refurbish boom . 
  standard of housing is a lot better for 90 % of people today . 
  i 'm happy about that , i 'm just relaying what i 've heard serbs say . 
  [ both ] ( https://www.riksgalden.se/sv/omriksgalden/statsskulden/sveriges-statsskuld-oversikt/historik-i-diagram/ ) . 
  now that the economy and unemployment is a bigger concern , we have started borrowing again . 
  foreign capital in serbia = = evil capitalist plan to take over the country . 
  that 's what i 've heard , anyway . 
   please tell me why this is bullshit , i never saw a western country that was able to reduces it 's debt sweden 1995 - 2008 ? 
  our debt is about 40 % of gdp now , but in the early 90 's it was 75 % and all doom and gloom . 
  our debt has even gone down in absolute numbers , not accounting for inflation . 
  south korea vs north korea . 
   peacekeeping , by the way , should n't involve any fighting unless absolutely necessary . 
  in a peacekeeping mission , you are only allowed to use force to immediately protect the civilians of the country 99 % peacekeeping missions do n't even do that . 
  you have a bunch of pretty well-equiped guys around a headquarter protecting an operation . 
  if they hear about people being slaughtered a kilometer away , they usually have to report in an ask if they are allowed to intervene . 
  sometimes the answer is `` no '' , even though lives could have been saved at little risk . 
  well , that 's another factor . 
  finns or swedes answering would n't factor in fighting abroad at all ( even if we do have missions abroad ) . 
  personally , i see foreign military contributions to e.g. 
  un missions more of a `` dangerous contract job '' than `` fighting for sweden '' . 
  why would it be lower ? 
  how many swedes do you think enjoy the thought of being occupied by russia ? 
  this is the default threat , anyway . 
  it 's almost guaranteed that any invader would make life worse for those invaded . 
  japan is a lot less individualistic than e.g. 
  sweden in most other measures . 
  figures are similar , though . 
  yeah , the swedish system can be gamed , and many well-off people engage in this activity . 
  instead of having good schools across the board , you move close to the great schools when your kids are the right age . 
  if there 's ambiguity , you fight with the municipality to put your kids in the right school . 
  if the school sucks , you change schools , you do n't try and improve the current one . 
  during all this , it 's customary to frame it not as school a is better than school b , but `` all of my little son 's friends are in school b , he would be so much happier in school b '' . 
  then in the later years , it become 50 % trying to find a good school and 50 % grade shopping . 
  it 's pretty horrible . 
  i was rooiing for hdp , because i heard how big of a difference it makes if they make it into parliament . 
  along with `` paranoia that your neighbor has not forgiven you and is plotting terrible plans against you '' . 
  `` forgiving '' is not among the top-100 balkan traits . 
  cultural destruction of ~ ~ the local christians ~ ~ syria is still achieved . 
  so chinatown is the opposite of multi-kulti ? 
  now you have me confused . 
  the us actually has a range of immigration cultures and how well-integrated they are . 
  people from india , for example , are very affluent , but fairly conservative about their culture . 
  is n't that a gaffe rather than a strange opinion ? 
  nearly everyone says strange stuff sometimes . 
   once fukushima blew up , she suddenly realized that nuclear energy might be dangerous in some cases . 
  that do n't quite apply to germany . 
  it seems like a populist move to get rid of some vigor in the opposition . 
  a sacrifice seemingly worth the cost . 
  great , [ this ] ( http://www.nilsoscar.se/default.aspx?page=olsorter&amp;pid=29 ) is their current sortiment . 
  my town is small , but we do have this : http://www.nilsoscar.se/upload/site/company-house.jpg, 
  my local systembolaget-store has 12 kinds of belgian beer . 
  all-in-all , there are 105 kinds available . 
  just about perfect . 
  he and depardieu living the good life together in moscow with wine , caviar and hostesses . 
  that would be france , no ? 
  nope . 
  white bread with lots of extra sugar in it is a thing . 
  we do have some variety , though . 
  rye bread in sweden is [ hard like , crackers ] ( http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/falu_r%c3%a5g-rut#/media/file:falu_r%c3%a5g-rut.jpg ) . 
  ah , i searched for `` kill all white men '' . 
  my mistake . 
  source ? 
   me lecturing finns how to get along with neighbours , 
  when did she say `` kill all white men '' ? 
  this is n't referenced at all in the story !, 
  * you failed , because the english became grammatically correct . 
  not really . 
  til all albanians are terrorists . 
  we will probably never know now . 
  and it 's not one crime , but many . 
  but there is a lot of evidence for wrongdoing , for example firms packing financial products with bad loans , pressuring their analysts to rate 99 % - sure-to-default loans as investments grade , then mixing up this with loans that were only a little bit better .
