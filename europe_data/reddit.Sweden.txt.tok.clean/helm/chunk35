  minority governments are about making partners , after all . 
  in this issue they have had it relatively easy , because the social democrats are split on the issue . 
  most leading members , except the prime minister , has come out saying that `` the saudi arms agreement is in conflict with our foreign policy '' . 
  yes , the environmental party has made it look like they `` forced the hand '' of the government , but in reality they have just pushed some reluctant social dems towards ending the agreement , * with the help of other social dems * . 
   and somehow anarchy and impoverishment is better ? 
  the fact remains libya was able to ensure relative prosperity to its citizens . 
  do n't we usually advocate western values as leading to prosperity ? 
  why do we look the other way when the opposite happens , as has now been the case with most western interventions since the second world war ? 
  libya was prosperous thanks to oil and the that gaddafi did distribute some of the wealth . 
  libyan economy did n't have much more than oil , however , this made the society very unstable . 
  the unemployment rate was 20 % in 2010 . 
  again , libyans rebelled against gaddafi on their own . 
  the west helped them win by taking out much of the forces loyal to gaddafi . 
  the country then imploded , unfortunately . 
  my point is that libya would have imploded regardless of western meddling . 
  gaddafi had set him himself up as the linchpin that held the country together . 
  well , we had a refugee peak during the balkan wars and accepted about a hundred thousand refugees during those years , mostly bosnians . 
  i 'm sure everyone involved would have stayed out of ethnic cleansing out of the kindness of their hearts . 
  no seriously , you 'd have 10 times the number of refugees , and 50 % would have ended up in sweden , everyone else would have gone all `` not my business '' . 
  in this matter sweden did n't do more than a number of other states that condemned the lashings . 
  ** the story is wrong and every damn comment in this thread is wrong ** . 
  there has been a tremendous pressure from both ruling parties to end the arms agreement with saudi arabia . 
  it 's been debated over and over the last three weeks , * before wallstr\u00f6m 's speech was blocked by saudi arabia * . 
  the environmental party ( junior member of the government ) more or less threatened to break up the government over it about a week ago . 
  ten-ish prominent figure of the other ruling party publicly demanded the deal to be ended over the last few weeks . 
  the only thing that makes any sort of sense in this mess is that the last-minute cancellation of a speech that centered on ** palestine ** was a result of a leak that sweden would not renew the arms agreement . 
   and what have we done in afghanistan to prevent the taliban from butchering women again ? 
  nothing whatsoever , we 've only made it more difficult for progressives , who will face accusations of serving foreign interests . 
  same thing in iran , where we 're preventing a historically cosmopolitan country from gradually adopting western values on their own terms . 
  in syria , the west has actively supported bandit militias such as isis , and feigns surprise when they turn out to be little more than barbarians with internet and weapons the taliban may have manage to get some funds from cia for the mujaheddin in the early days , but they are not driven by the west !, 
  the salafism movement is an arab thing . 
  the taliban ruled all of afghanistan in 2001 , after the takeover in 1996 . 
  there were no progressives that could do anything in afghanistan at that time . 
  yes , the american hardliners prevent much of the possible progress , but apart from what was done around 1953 , what is `` big satan '' doing now ? 
  they do n't want iran to get nukes . 
   libya . 
  formerly the 2nd or 3rd most prosperous nation in africa , now a divided country in near anarchy . 
  if that 's what exporting western democracy looks like , no wonder regional elites are no longer so entranced by it . 
  do you know how libya was organized ? 
  * everything * of weight that happened in libya had to go past gaddafi personally . 
  yes , he ran a semi-tight ship , but libya was doomed by this . 
  the libyan state could n't function without him , it was worse than yugoslavia under tito . 
   forcing a country where almost half the population spoke russian to choose between the europe and russia was obviously going to tear it apart . 
  russia did not want ukraine to sign a association agreement with the eu . 
  yanukovich had promised to do this , that 's how he got votes in western ukraine . 
  also , he was very corrupted , money from the government was leaking to him , his brother , and other family members . 
  if you ask ukrainians what euromaidan was about , half will say the aa and half will say it was anti-yanukovich anti-corruption demonstration . 
  the west did not instigate the protest , the fuel was 95 % native ukrainian and at most 5 % western cheerleeding . 
  the following events are a result of russias frustrations with its limited soft power , using hard power to get what they want instead . 
   afghanistan , iraq , syria , lybia you 're making it easy on yourself . 
  if the taliban in * afghanistan * butchered women in kabul who refused to wear burka or go to school , or continued to provide training facilities for al qaeda , that would be blamed on the west too . 
  * iraq * - yes - iraq war was a very poor decision by bush . 
  imploding primarily because of assad himself and islamic forces ( the sponsors of isis ) . 
  * libya * ? 
  yes , khadaffi could have quelled the uprising , killed a few thousand protestors , and then survived a few more years . 
  the primary problem in libya was that the whole state was centered on khadaffi . 
  it was an autocracy without a plan of succession . 
  or swedish `` tr\u00e4l '' - slave . 
  you should maybe open a history book . 
  it 's the old win/lose zero-sum rhetoric all over again ... ( of course , losing yanukovich meant losing a lot of political influence in ukraine , though ), 
  who is tearing apart whom ? 
  yes , this is one of the implications . 
  russia do not care if their policies makes the lives of a few million people ( or hundred million ) worse , if it puts them in a more powerful position . 
  i think the majority of the west simply did n't understand how far russia was prepared to go to assert its influence in the region . 
  we expected normalization and a country that has a tougher rhetoric , but accept a pacified world based on good trade relations . 
  this whole debacle has been a wake-up call . 
  if you listen to what putin says about those things , it can be summed up like this : `` russia has its own destiny . 
  we refuse to normalize . 
  we do not want to play according to the rules the us dictate . '', 
  edit : personally , i think this attitude is quite scary . 
  sorry , you failed english . 
  yes , happy and pleased with yourself . 
  well , she is n't competing with that song , but she won with another ( euphoria ) in 2012 . 
  do n't forget clinton ... 
  norway pays a lot for the privilege and gets no say . 
  it 's basically the same for switzerland , although the eu may bne paying a little for the transit traffic . 
  i just tested my english skills in the largest newspaper of sweden ( edit : that sentence was effed up before ) . 
  i failed , because i did n't know the word `` chuffed '' . 
  it 's expected of us to keep track of both american and english slang : /, 
  so that 's where this silly meme comes from ? 
  it 's all good , they need someone to look out for their fledgling community . 
  [ i 'm swedish , and i 'm offended  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayvou7x7nhg ), 
  after i was called a `` homosexual '' for the crime of marrying a woman ( yes , i 'm a man ) , i ca n't take finnish criticism of sweden seriously any more . 
  eh the comment was on body shaming . 
  costs are a bit higher than in krakow , though . 
  we had a long distance relationship for a while , so i 've spent many weekends in krakow . 
  lovely city . 
  it 's the old adage `` sabotage the eu and blame it for the failure '' . 
  that 's great !, 
  i feel bad about making my wife move to sweden , employment opportunities with her degree has n't been the best ... 
  well , it needs to be done . 
  sweden 's former prime minister ( fredrik reinfeldt ) did a pretty good job , but when it came to russia , he was very naive . 
  swedish businessmen in moscow said that `` russia would lose trade partners if it were to threaten or military intervene with its neighbors '' . 
  thinking like a comfortable westerner with no imperial ambitions , that made him relaxed . 
  the swedish intelligence services tried to tell him that trade and friendly relations with other countries were not the only parameters in russian foreign policy , but that did n't make sense to reinfeldt , so he ignored it and kept cutting in sweden 's defense capabilities . 
  my wife has a similar degree from ju , have you found a job already ? 
  and you 're an agenda-free serbian nationalist ... 
   if this deal were stricken with sweden for the same money , nobody would be crying murder . 
  i understand why people would be alarmed tho . 
  huh ?
