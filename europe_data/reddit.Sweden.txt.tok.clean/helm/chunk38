  i 've been on similar ferry rides that had more stuff happening , so we 'll have to disagree , i guess . 
  why do you think finns go to tallin ? 
  this sort of stuff is pretty likely on baltic sea ferries . 
  there was a gang rape on a student cruise in sweden just recently . 
  99 % of these cruises are about cheap alcohol and escaping the consequences of being drunk . 
  [ to heaven ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h46gobzhpfk ), 
  good point . 
  but you do n't build a political career from nothing in russia , which is kind of the problem . 
  the main issue i have with the russian political discourse is the belief in strong leaders ( and weak institutions ) . 
  a better country is built through stable institutions , and too strong leaders hollow out institutions and make everyone dance after their pipe . 
  i think mikhail khodorkovsky was jailed mostly for political reasons . 
  he seems to have been jailed for being interested in using his money as a platform to build a political career on . 
  his crimes were likely the same as any other successful businessman of his era . 
  he simply crossed the wrong people . 
  one side of putin 's success is that he has convinced a majority of russians that there is no alternative to him , only chaos and humiliation . 
  of course there is no alternative - he 's worked very hard to make sure there is n't one . 
  every ruler is exactly equally corrupt always , change and improvement is impossible . 
  trump = berlusconi, 
  western politicians , that is !, 
  many rich westerners were on that list . 
  and for your argument to hold , we are to believe that nearly all politicians dodge tax in panama for the same reasons , and have enough wealth for it to be meaningful . 
  this is unlikely the case , in my opinion . 
  how much does our legal system deal with ideology ? 
  hopefully not much at all . 
  feelings about how horrible is is does not make inapplicable laws applicable , all of a sudden . 
  that does n't stop me from seeing tens , if not hundreds of comments endorsing stripping of citizenship for fighting in foreign wars . 
  this argument rarely appears in threads on ukraine or , as you mentioned , joining the peshmerga , but when it pops up its always an easy out legally calling everyone who 've gone to syria traitors . 
  every time it is mentioned that `` proving war crimes is a necessary and difficult process '' people argue for this shortcut . 
  well , it 's obvious that the armed conflict with russia and the trade restrictions the two states are involved in have n't made things better . 
  most of it is the result of russian geopolitics , though . 
  not in this thread , but in ** every ** thread about is . 
  yes , but the arguments that it is `` astounding and unprecedented that european citizens go and fight for a foreign cause '' and that `` this is is obviously treason '' those are very common arguments for a range of punishments for is supporters , ** solely ** for the act of going abroad to fight for a foreign cause . 
  it 's annoying that people who do n't know history , modern law or european judicial tradition are given so many upvotes in this sub . 
  it 's a celebration of gut reactions and ignorance . 
  this game answers the question `` how can a soccer player hide taxable income from his country of residence ? '', 
  remember , this leak was from one law firm . 
  swedish politicians usually cash in after their term has ended . 
  it 's entirely uncertain that `` he paid income taxes on his salary '' . 
  maybe the football club was billed by a company instead . 
  like most superstars , he also makes a lot of money in royalties and sponsor programs , which again can be billed to a shell company . 
  if any of these maneuvers leads to the wrong amount of tax being paid , it can be illegal . 
  keep in mind that iceland is like your mid-size european town . 
  what have you , personally , done to atone for our colonial past ? 
  how do you respond to people demanding that you atone for it ? 
  no , this is what modern society is built on . 
  i 'm not responsible for my neighbor 's crimes . 
  those that support terrorism are guilty too , of course . 
  so if someone from your neighborhood commits a serious crime you would n't be aggravated if some aggressive people come up to your house and shout about what assholes * everyone * living there is ? 
  typically german , french or spanish . 
  in sweden , all students study a second foreign language for 3 years at age 13-16 . 
  those that do n't continue their language studies in high school often forget 99 % of what they were taught . 
  that was sweden 10-15 years ago : cards accepted everywhere , but small shop owners occasionally complained and tried to enforce lowest card purchase limits . 
  in sweden we have a hegemony of debit cards , with splash of cash and credit cards . 
  and our banks ca n't stop handling cash quickly enough . 
  our central bank suggested forcing bank offices to handle cash by law , even . 
  the banks were furious . 
  owning means less than the leverage . 
  i doubt the region pays for itself considering the type of industry and the investments needed . 
  the geopolitical leverage looks quite valuable , however . 
  the major bad thing for russia with this de-facto annexation is that it is n't as glorious as the gain of crimea . 
  the primary purpose is to lock up ukraine in a perpetual conflict . 
  given the rise of nationalism and the cost of appearing weak , it would be a career-ender to acknowledge russian annexation of donbas . 
  so ukraine will stick to its territorial claims . 
  unfortunately , this means that ukraine can not join nato ( eu will be difficult too ) and will likely have a hard time getting on its feet economically . 
  economically , it 's a drain on the russian state . 
  for the right persons in the administration , it can be used to laundry funds if you need to bribe people . 
  russia still pushes for the minsk accord . 
  in this , ukraine has formal control of the territories , but also full financial responsibility . 
  this is how russia `` builds a wall and makes mexico pay for it '' , or rather , take land , administer it as their own , and still try to get ukraine to pay for its public services and entitlements of its 3 million inhabitants . 
  look at thailand . 
  their government has had similar issues as turkey with the military coming in and telling everyone what to do . 
  it usually does n't work out that well . 
  the us foreign policy changes over decades , and they ca n't spend an infinite amount of money on bases and troops . 
  a strong presence i sa was more important ten years ago than today , regardless of aq . 
  and this has nothing to do with withdrawing from iraq ? 
  still . 
  no-one came to sweden and told us what to do . 
  we did not bend over to anyone but our own ideas . 
  so ex-yugoslavia is in your in-group . 
  and offering anything to an out-group is `` spineless '' . 
  talk about abusing a word to suit your agenda . 
  pretty ok , actually . 
  i 've lived in malm\u00f6 for a year not that long ago . 
  i liked it . 
  the city has problems , and they are worse now than a year ago , but it 's still a very livable city . 
  i guess you think sweden was spineless when we accepted hundreds of thousands of people from ex-yugoslavia too ? 
  there has been a vocal minority against our asylum policy for a long time . 
  up to 2014 , their influence was minimal . 
  we did not have an anti-immigration party in parliament until 2010 . 
  there were no large-scale protest (  1000 ) against the decisions to grant all syrians permanent residency in 2013 . 
  up to 2015 , the support for `` more or the same number '' of refugees has been well over 50 % . 
  haha , calling sweden `` spineless '' . 
  no , we chose to have a generous refugee policy . 
  this , in combination with a decent economy made us a very popular destination for asylum-seekers . 
  now we 've have more immigrants than we can take good care of , though . 
  sweden has not been spineless . 
  we have been naive in our intent to make the world a better place , and some of our policies , especially on unaccompanied child asylum seekers , have led to perverse incentives to come here . 
  they are in no danger of that . 
  it 's hard to find 1000 refugees that even want to go to poland . 
  slavery would be profitable in agriculture even today .
