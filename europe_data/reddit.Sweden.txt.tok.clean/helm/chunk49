  there are 80-110 murders each year in sweden . 
  each one is a tragedy , of course . 
  but the ikea murder is the most famous this year and involves an asylum seeker who was rejected and in wait for deportation . 
  my comment was in the context of `` why is this not in the international news '' . 
  it was . 
  quick , downvote this man !, 
   the suspect 's asylum application had been rejected by danish authorities and he was scheduled to be deported . 
  he had been held at udrejsecenter sj\u00e6lsmark , a centre for rejected asylum seekers , since july . 
  no , she does n't . 
  the guy will be deported out of europe . 
  no knife attack took place in sweden , unsure what you 're getting at . 
  everyone on reddit knows about the ikea stabbing . 
  can you name another murder that happened in sweden in 2015 ? 
  those were not refugees , they were prisoners set up for death . 
  you ca n't really compare . 
  and it 's silly to punish people for having agency . 
  my point was that jews escaping germany in the 30s certainly shopped around . 
  few went to soviet if they could help it . 
  when the jews were fleeing from germany , austria , etc , do you think they did research first ? 
  yeah , it 's a subreddit that used to be quite civil - now were one step shy of accepting expressions such as `` we need to combat the locust swarm that 's attacking us '' . 
  it 's been , like , almost 20 years since the last attempted genocide !, 
  it was written by an international team that worked for the un in 1948 . 
  it would n't have happened without american support of it , but there were many other countries involved , and most of europe has adopted this declaration as a core value . 
  we have pretty ok experience with iraqi kurds , many of them have already returned , though . 
  we have 10,000 experts on the baghdad dialect in s\u00f6dert\u00e4lje alone . 
  in uni we did mix instant mashed potatoes with [ vov ] ( http://www.horsemeup.se/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/4/4/449590_1.jpg ) and served as a night meal for fraternity initiates . 
  i lucked out because i 'm a vegetarian . 
  otoh , some bright person decided to not drench the tampon in a generic red liquid , but actual pig 's blood that year ... 
  probably culture shock from the lapskojs . 
   almost scary how much opinion sweden is censoring ... great , you 're the expert . 
  but that 's another discussion . 
  my point was that `` menschenw\u00fcrde '' is a term that 's under attack by the nationalistic right in sweden . 
  what 's the big political gain for switzerland to choose a swedish fighter ? 
  the only one i can think of is a better investment package . 
   die w\u00fcrde des menschen ist unantastbar ha , reading r/europe currently you 'd think this is n't something europeans believe in . 
  i have even debated with some nitwits in r/sweden that claim that this is a load of bull and should be abolished . 
  yet gripen was the choice until a referendum killed the procurement . 
  sorry for hijacking this , but is there any return of r/europe from the current state of a link dump for anti-immigration activists ? 
  [ average car mass increased 10 % between 2001 and 2011 ] ( http://www.theicct.org/sites/default/files/publications/pocketbook_2012_opt.pdf ) . 
  i do n't think that would be the major contribution to this discrepancy , although it may have some effect . 
  yeah , 99 % are apolitical and use it as a `` rebel flag '' . 
  to them , it just shows that they are in the subculture . 
  being a raggare is a lifestyle : https://www.google.se/search?site=&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=1099&amp;q=raggare&amp;oq=raggare&amp;gs_l=img.3..0l4j0i10j0l2j0i10j0l2.1263.1943.0.2045.7.6.0.1.1.0.125.494.4j2.6.0....0...1ac.1.64.img..0.7.495.qzl1eq3t8lk, 
  thank you, 
  there 's an entire `` yankee '' subculture dedicated to them . 
  they are called `` raggare '' . 
   not always feasible , unless you take enough space between you and other drivers in front of you . 
  that means you will most likely have to drive slower = grandpa i would argue that if you ca n't leave a 50 m gap to the car in front of you , you are the dinosaur . 
  on the other hand , traffic in sweden is usually less crowded . 
  still , occasionally , you 'll have the idiot that will do a dangerous overtake to get first to a red light when i 'm de-accelerating a hundred meters before the light . 
  read the full report and explain why the difference has snowballed since 2002 : http://www.transportenvironment.org/sites/te/files/publications/te_mind_the_gap_2015_final.pdf it 's very clear that the claims have gone from 110 % of typical results to 135 % . 
  there is no evidence that consumer behavior has changed , on the contrary , ecodriving is a popular trend , and people talk more about mileage now than ever before . 
  scooters do not have exhaust cleaning , as far as i know . 
  yet the difference has been increasing steadily the last 15 years . 
  from around 10 % in consumer cars to 30 % . 
   you can reach the official fuel consumption , but you 'll have to drive like a granpa not really , you just do n't have to burn rubber , and avoid using the brakes when motor-breaking works just fine . 
  it 's still another step . 
  ecodriving has been all the rage for ten years , and even muscle-car enthusiasts talk competitive about mileage on their commuter cars . 
  the difference between claimed mileage and actual mileage is still increasing every year , and i do n't think people are driving more aggressively . 
  the economist published a graph ( i ca n't find it now , i have paper subscription ) where fuel efficiency was shown to have been inflated every years since 2000 , and now was 30 % for consumer cars , and even more for company cars . 
  exceeding nox regulations by a factor 40 does make a difference . 
  that 's the claim in the economist . 
  they also turn of the accumulator . 
  this was the bravest thing i 've seen all year !, 
  i do n't think so . 
  but i commented on sanders - he 's not interested fta 's . 
  he ran a protectionist platform too . 
  fta 's were not on that list . 
  why does it matter if he 's friends with farage ? 
  yeah , trump has won , and now it 's not the role of leaders of other nations to personally humiliate him . 
  taking the duterte path may garner some laughter and support the first day , but after that it 's losses all the way down . 
  he still oversaw the stagnation of italy and did nothing . 
  disregarding climate change is the newest gop pillar , along with old ones such as being against abortion . 
  i 'm sure the substantial aid in the form of armaments was appreciated and came to good use , however . 
  yes . 
  the polls were wrong , and the base hypothesis is that some of the anti-establishment voters saw the polling people as either part of the establishment or part of the clinton campaign . 
  in other words the `` brexit effect '' . 
  there 's also the theory about how they were not using mobile phones for surveys , but i do n't see how that would result in a pro-clinton bias . 
  trump is going to kill aca and epa , and impose tariffs , most of the other stuff is contradictory . 
  probably some sort of unfinanced tax cuts , those are popular too . 
  i followed 538 yesterday , and it was annoying to see so many morons attacking nate silver for not having had trump at  50 % before election day . 
  he had him at ~ 30 % . 
  he discussed how polling errors tend to be correlated ( not average out ) , and how clinton could get the majority of the vote but still lose . 
  as long as no-one is shot !, 
  this is a very good strategy , and does n't cost all that much . 
  if it makes the magazine sell a thousand more copies , it 's profitable . 
  i like your flair ... 
  i live 100 km away , we have 2 cm of snow . 
  sounds plausible , there was still autumn temperature water around stockholm , until it suddenly got colder . 
  absolutely . 
  and i do believe that clinton would be more interventionist . 
  however , after the iraq war , the arab spring , the droughts and isis , yemen , etc , the momentum in the region is bigger than usa and russia can control . 
  bringing back the autocracy of assad and patching the kurdish question could buy some time , but that only covers about a third of the refugee in the region . 
  you remember that poll that said that swedes would want to exit the eu if britain did ? 
  yeah , it was n't very predictive . 
  it 's difficult to be sure how bernie would have played out . 
  same problem gore had . 
  it 's a global phenomenom , everyone thinks crime is going up , whil it 's either unchanged or going down . 
  it 's all about the globalization of news . 
  good post ( if you interepret your facts as common perceptions ) , but this :  for europe : i believe he promised a scaling back of war operations ( less refugees ) is probably not in the cards for trump to control .
