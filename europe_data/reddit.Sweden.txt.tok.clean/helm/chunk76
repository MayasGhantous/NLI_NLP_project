  spontaneously ( and sung in swedish ) : [ satan i gatan ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npfah0xayts ), 
  not even caparezza ? 
  the eastern block ran a very complicated economy based on mutually * unprofitable * deals . 
  in the industry most things were either subsidized ( energy ) or traded below production cost ( e.g. 
  machine parts ) . 
  when the block started to break apart , the deals within the eastern block started to fall apart too . 
  it was a big problem that was mostly ignored , with pretty catastrophic results . 
  what currency ? 
  the euro ? 
  that would make the german industry even more competitive , boosting growth and inflation in germany . 
  if greece wants devaluation , they should leave the euro or implement internal devaluation , the way the baltic countries did . 
  inflation also is an advantage for people with assets that automatically raise in value with inflation . 
  if you only have cash and a stagnating income , you 're fucked . 
  basically , it takes money from those that did n't borrow too much and gives it to those who borrowed too much . 
  nations have always run into deep shit when the creditors knock on the door and the pockets are empty . 
  the baltic countries `` solved '' the problem via internal devaluation . 
  to be honest , tony blair is n't very attractive either , but i do n't think he ( or anyone else ) cares too much about that . 
  have your read the threads on the european song contest ? 
  judging by them , no-one in scandinavia enjoys esc , when the truth is that its one of the most popular televised events every year . 
  the reddit user base is a demographic almost entirely separated from those who enjoy esc . 
  when it comes to religion , it 's a strong cluster effect - non-believers hang out with like-minded people and openly religious hang out with other openly religious . 
  once one side is dominant , the minority view is usually not expressed . 
  one of my best friends is a freemason , and while you can lie about your faith in a monotheistic god when you join , few will , and he did n't . 
  another good friend is a convinced atheist who believes that religion is a source of evil . 
  overall , you 'd think that none of us are believers , religion is not something we talk about . 
  more oversimplification than cherry-picking , then , no ? 
  you know why norway is in the middle of social spending and not in the top with the other nordic countries ? 
  because their gdp is so disgustingly high that it makes their social spending look low in comparison . 
  how is comparing gdp to social spending since 2000 cherry picking ? 
  it 's not meaningless to jews . 
  it 's the first point in their contract with god , basically . 
  apparently it 's even more recent ( i dunno why i wrote 20 years , come to think of it )  with the adding of new speed limits in 2008 the signs mentioned above now follow these rules : * the freeway ( motorv\u00e4g ) sign is now always posted together with a sign indicating the speed limit for this road . 
  * the start of village sign is also always posted together with a speed limit sign . 
  both of these imply a shift towards a system where every stretch of road gets an individual valuation . 
  asa swede , my impression is that there is no general and simple rules for the speed limits . 
  the geography and population density varies too much in sweden for it to be meaningful . 
  sometimes you get real odd situations where a 3-lane ( 1 +2 ) road has a speed limit of 100 km/h and the 4-lane highway right after it has 90 km/h . 
  but 20 years ago , only odd numbers were used ( 30/50/70 / 90/110 ) . 
  this has changed now , but some people still say `` 80 is not a speed limit '' . 
  the chart is not particularly accurate . 
  off-highway speed limits vary from 70 to 110 km/h , with 90 km/h being quite common once you 're in the woods . 
  i think in northern sweden , some narrow roads still have a 110 km/h speed limit . 
  `` 120 bei n\u00e4sse '' is common . 
  this means that if the road conditions are good , there is no speed limit . 
  housing bubbles hurt plenty when they burst . 
  people are eager to forget that spain is still in the midst of a construction and housing bubble burst that was not directly caused by the euro . 
  japan had one , sweden had one , plenty of other countries had one . 
  the complication for europe is that the financial crisis led to many bubbles bursting at the same time , severely limiting the effect of certain options . 
  the overlap between esc enthusiasts and european redditors is very small , so you wo n't get any real answers here . 
  keep that in mind . 
  if you do n't like pop music that can be heard on the radio , esc has little to offer . 
  everybody * you know * , lol . 
  you know that 90 % of swedish women between 5-50 watch the national final , right ? 
  only a small minority of them watch it for the `` camp value '' . 
  not only , nobody cares that much about abba anymore , they mattered more in the 70 's and early 80 's . 
  the recent enormous success of the show is mostly due to a successful format and production , signed the former artist christer bj\u00f6rkman . 
  the last ten years , the format is four qualifying contests , one `` second chance '' show , and the national final . 
  the national final is watched by * half the population * . 
  sometimes really good songs barely lose , such as [ this one by salem al fakir ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-w3a4h5pbs ) . 
  alternatively , you hire a swedish pop pro to write a pop song or a dance pop song . 
  the statistic from this year was 10 out 36 finalist songs that were written by swedish song writers/producers . 
  it 's a side effect of not having communication technology , mostly . 
  the poll in the submission is from 2012 . 
  the polls that umbama quotes are from 2006 . 
  the wtc attack and the bombings in europe are more distant . 
  the arab spring . 
  the failure of al qaeda . 
  and i figure nothing has happened since 2006 . 
  do n't worry , you have angry birds now !, 
  too bad you 're entombing it instead of developing it . 
  lederman 's book !, 
  not higgs ' book !, 
  * lederman * 's book . 
  higgs would have protested . 
  as an unexpected homage to magnus uggla : centrum hets !, 
  i did n't quite claim that , only that a single bad game does n't prove much . 
  so they played one bad game ? 
  which team in the euro did n't ? 
  germany looked really strong , then collapsed against italy . 
  so texans refuse to wave the flag or identify as american ? 
  my impression is that texans believe they are the * real * americans . 
  in 2010 , before he was president . 
  he was religious when he deserted , though . 
  he had an interesting comment on `` pacifist churches '' , though :  in germany , i tried to get in contact with a pacifist church , but the germans did not understand me . 
  there are no pro-war churches in europe . 
  sweden : yes , yes , yes !, 
  * three minutes later * oh no , not again, 
  hmm , i ca n't find it . 
  a poor substitute that jabs at the same conclusions : http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~semp/facism.htm this source seems pretty good http://books.google.se/books?id=jqafbhrvugec&amp;pg=pa4&amp;lpg=pa4&amp;dq=fascism+%22anti+ideology%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=p7gifasrvd&amp;sig=fouiseqgy0thxsetnkbbikbtato&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=3crbt8tknaqn4gtoqu2xcg&amp;ved=0cgiq6aewbq#v=onepage&amp;q=fascism%20%22anti%20ideology%22&amp;f=false racisms and extreme nationalism * seem * essential to fascism , but really are not . 
  there 's a very good essay on how fascism does n't have tenets , more of a modus operandi . 
  when it came to ideology and politics , both the nazi germans and mussolini italians were pretty flexible . 
  action and the right spirit  intellectualism and ideological coherence . 
  interesting how this aspect of greek politics is very similar to turkish politics . 
  in japan , the clubs have no real geographical rooting , and are named after their main sponsor . 
  i do believe it 's more phoney to have `` team pepsi '' play against `` team coca cola '' , than clubs based in physical cities . 
   no reason to implement unsafe working practices you do n't implement unsafe working practices , it 's the norm before serious regulation . 
  poor countries usually can not pull off serious regulation . 
  i dunno about oslo , but stockholm is horrible for students at the moment . 
  there are dorms , but currently the queue is 24 months , and you ca n't enter until you 've been accepted at a college . 
  so everyone has to a ) find a roommate ( not very popular option for strangers here ) or b ) hire a room second hand ( expensive , but if you 're ripped off you can sue ) , or c ) buy an appartment for millions of sek .
