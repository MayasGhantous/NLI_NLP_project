a quick summary of the common misconceptions in the assange case , and why they are misconceptions . 
  and s\u00e4llskapsresan . 
  its linked to / r/european at the same time , so they probably come over to `` help '' ... 
  i live in sweden , so you are not fooling me . 
  no matter how many threads you go on about it in . 
  then how is it that we have non-racists talk about it and not be called racist ? 
  why is it that every time some sweden democrat says something racist about africans , jews or muslims , its always `` oh , so i \u00b4 m a racist just for talking about immigration '' ? 
  edit hello sd !, 
  this is a lie that is spammed in almost every thread about sweden . 
  when will / r/europe understand that this is just part of an agenda ? 
  and this time its not . 
  redditors love it , but its false . 
  they * are * right wing extremists and racists . 
  they started using these tricks on people outside of sweden to get sympathies . 
  norwegians and danes fell for it . 
  you do n't seem to know who i am talking about , so why would you call it `` like it 's nothing '' ? 
   fellow countryman of yours : i know what some are claiming . 
  it does n't mean its true . 
   that sounds like stasi stuff to me * if * one believe it . . and as has been pointed out many times before , that `` study '' has been heavily criticized since its not about political journalists . 
  when looking at how things are reported , there is no bias . 
   just people who want to speak their mind without getting battered under godwins and guilt tripped into conformity today all forms of racism is excused by redditors crying `` godwin '' . 
   as in sweden . 
  a climate where the left held the racism gun to everybodies head if they do not agree with their norms for what is acceptable towards immigrants and more social issues . 
  this is becoming like a test . 
  are you gullible enough to fall for this bullshit , and not realize its made up by extremists ? 
  the right wing extremists and racists are really happy that you dont fact check them , and just blindly believe them . 
  for those that really want to know , saying that you `` cant talk about immigration '' in sweden is a trick used by populists , to basically force every discussion to be about immigration . 
  they used norwegian and danish media to spread it further . 
   or does sweden just get all the bad publicity ? 
  look throug this thread , check r/european , swedenyes , theredpill and such . 
  they have an agenda , and just make shit up . 
  its a right wing extreme propaganda forum . 
  of course its the `` leftists '' that are to blame ... 
  i would say that r/sweden is one of the most racist forums on reddit , outside of whiterights . 
  thats a pathetic rhetoric . 
  if sweden is not as right wing populist or as afraid of immigrants as the rest , then swedes need to be smeared . 
  that `` study '' has been heavily criticized , since its not about political journalists . 
  hen is a word to be used when you do n't know the gender of someone in third person , so instead of saying `` he or she '' you can say `` hen '' . 
  there is nothing of `` the old ones are not good enough '' , there was no old one . 
  its not political correctness , its development of language . 
  there was a finnish documentary that brough up the differences the nordics view each other . 
  and specifically the importance for norwegians , danes and finns have in finding reasons to look down on swedes . 
  finding whatever is viewed as demeaning and saying that i typical of swedes . 
  its difficult not to see that with this obsession some has about an imagined `` extreme political correctness '' . 
  and then of course there are the political reasons , like danish media and politicians . 
  they have the pronoun in finland , but no one goes on about `` political correctness '' then . 
  its more about wanting to point fingers at sweden . 
  if the other countries goes on about a word that harmless , then they are trying to hard . 
  thats what i mean . 
  and its not just this thread , its pretty much everyone that involves sweden . 
  its an area with above average amount of left wingers . 
  right wingers often complains about it , and uses it in a demeaning way , `` well its probably someone from s\u00f6dermalm '' . 
  right wingers love the stereotype of all `` far-left '' journalists living in one place , dressing the same , and saying the same things etc. 
  its like believing all right wingers live in castles and have butlers named jeeves . 
  this is the circlejerk . 
  when someone uses `` h\u00e4n '' , do some poeple in finland get upset and go on about `` political correctness '' ? 
   as long as i 'm allowed to say danskjavlar every now and again , we 're good :d what more could one ask for , 
  pretty much . 
  danes often say swedes are politically correct , but that has more to do with wanting to view themselves as laid back , or that we do n't share their view on immigration . 
  and populists always go on about political correctness and `` not allowed to have a debate '' or `` not allowed to be in media '' when most disagree with them . 
  so `` pc '' , and incorrectness , mean different things here then to englis speakers . 
  the phrases has been misused for to long . 
  in fact , those over here that calls themselves politically incorrect tends to be the ones that overreact the most . 
  conspiracy theorists , doomsday prophets , right wing extremists worried about `` swedish culture '' being removed , sharia laws around the corner etc etc. 
  the whole `` politically correct '' thing has more to do with not liking populism or racism , then you get called politically correct by some . 
  threads about sweden often attract racists and propagandists , and not just from r/sweden , but r/european and r/whiterights . 
  but the mods really do a good job . 
  edit : ha !, 
  / r/european has linked here : http://sv.reddit.com/r/european/comments/30un61/reurope_has_some_new_great_rules_bigotry_hate/, 
  http://sv.reddit.com/r/european/comments/30un61/reurope_has_some_new_great_rules_bigotry_hate/ / r/european has linked to this thread , so get ready for them brigading . 
  the swedish government has responded : '' we have not apologized '' . 
  which was just a blogger doing a `` whats the deal with some men taking up two seats on the bus '' and a lot of of kids online got angry * at her * for . 
  she was not the one overreacting . 
  but this myth will continue to spread as `` swedish femininazi going crazy '' or calling them `` sjw '' which just further proves that its the anti-feminists that are just overly sensitive . 
  then just call ecuador . 
  please save us reddit !, 
  the evil `` white knights '' are destroying us trough ... eh ... refugees , i guess ? 
  oh , the misery !, 
  good  it was not an attack on the french . 
  more that the guy was not swedish . 
  i could have said `` he is not swedish , so why are you embarrassed as a swede . '', 
   white knight sweden tried to be a hero but now is drowning in its misery and it 'll only get worse . 
  denmark , you 're fantastic !, 
  - azerty258741369 sounds like you get your worldview from that sub .

  they get upvotes , and we are not in r/european . 
  have never seen or heard any one say that there are * no * problems with immigration what so ever . 
  most of these threads do look like this : http://sv.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2zc1lf/denmark_has_no_intention_of_helping_out_other/cphkmcv http://sv.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2zc1lf/denmark_has_no_intention_of_helping_out_other/cphlgg7 http://sv.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2zc1lf/denmark_has_no_intention_of_helping_out_other/cphj52o so its not strange that there is talk about racism . 
  the guy that made the embarrassing and dumb comment is french , so why would someone from sweden be embarrassed by it ? 
  i 'm not saying him being french means something , just that it makes no sense for the * other * guy to be embarrassed by it . 
  what color is the sky in your world ? 
  he is french . 
  why would you , as a swede , be embarrassed by it ? 
  just wait till eurovision begins . 
  its awesome/horrifying and can be [ very confusing to the uninitiated .
