this was just the executive summary of a weird life that randy only learned about in bits and pieces as the years went on . 
  later , he was to decide that andrew 's life had been fractally weird . 
  that is , you could take any small piece of it and examine it in detail and it , in and of itself , would turn out to be just as complicated and weird as the whole thing in its entirety . 
  came here to make the same observation . 
  i see this a lot . 
  swedes get the vikings , and danes get the weed and sm\u00f6rrebr\u00f6d . 
  we had vikings , sure . 
  but ours went on raids into the east . 
  * danes * raided england , mostly . 
  perfect nick . 
  i was replying to this post , which is now the topic of our discussion , agreed ? 
  :  itt : people not realizing ** some europans ** are getting tired of mainstream parties breaking their promises . 
  op was in other words not referring to just the fn but to the general wave of success among right-wing parties in europe , * at least one of which is neo-nazi * . 
  now concede that point and please move on with your life . 
  you know a quote is for a thing someone actually * said * , right ? 
  i never mentioned fn . 
  i was referring to the gd in greece , but people immediately started calling me random names , so i 'll stop here and go mourn the swedish pirate party . 
  `` i got so tired of not having good enough results from the party i vote for , so i naturally decided to vote for the neo-nazis . 
  i 'm sure it makes sense ! '', 
  learn to swim , see you down in \u00d6rebro bay !, 
  i 'm so fucking hungover . 
  08:00 i got up and started looking for an earth fault in my land rover defender . 
  so far i 've deconstructed the entire dashboard and instrumentation and found nothing wrong . 
  all the while with sweden 's mediocre ballad in my head . . :p, 
  i love you norwegians , if there is a goofy word for something in swedish , you can bet it is the official normal word in norwegian . 
  plus it is a beautiful language . 
  80 's here , everyone i know says `` at '' . 
  my parents too . 
  small statistical group , i know , but still .

   why is sweden not in the eu & # 3232 ; _ & # 3232 ;, 
  i did the same but with poland , from sweden : http://i.imgur.com/t7uai7k.jpg from the top : 1 . 
  why was poland divided ? 
  why did poland join the eu ? 
  why does poland use so much coal ? 
  why is poland so poor ? 
  why was poland so particularly exposed in the european power struggles ?

  and * our * minister of justice [ believes that pot can kill you instantly ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/07/sweden-marijuana-spoof_n_4555701.html ) and forwards that shit to facebook .

  i am so pleased with this whole thread so far . 
  i was expecting butthurt to be honest . 
  if this is in any way interfering with the release of vray 3.0 specifically or with chaos group in general i shall be very upset . 
  with the government . 
  i am now in love . 
  yes , and i was trying to sound knowledgeable by namedropping the new one which i thought `` replaced '' globen as a national arena or whatever , but i 'm rambling . 
  never . 
  only beer and naked women . 
  a man can dream ... 
  sorry , the suspicion that the gov.t bribed cambodia . 
  turned out that our aid to cambodia has been consistent over the years and did not spike as it would have if this was a bribe outside the regular aid programme . 
  but please provide links to sources if you have anything new on this , i pretty much forgot about it when i saw the figures . 
  edit : oh , and the main reason for his arrest was apparently his involvement with hacking logica , which was a clear and cut crime , so there 's that . 
  source on the arla thing please ? 
  damn straight . 
  i think the new arena is [ friends arena . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/friends_arena ) or now that i read about it it looks likte it 's for football and concerts . 
  can anyone sports-y fill me in ? 
  yes , about that . 
  that case turned out to be not so watertight as it first appeared . 
  believe me , as a pp-supporter i was all over it at first . 
  might it be because of our ostensible neutrality ? 
  she can rest assured that with our general lack of faith , we will burn in eternal hellfire soon enough anyway . 
  we still love them and cherish them over here , at least in the north , even though we do n't have the same strong sauna-traditions as the finns . 
  aww , group hug everyone !, 
  if you walk in to a room and want to get the attention in a sort of friendly and cute way , sure . 
   it 's the imitation of a door-bell jingling . 
  [ `` just try it . . 
  there will be ... 
  trouble . 
  [ apparently it means `` heap '' . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1bapcc/map_of_the_most_common_surnames_in_europe/c95b0wm ), 
  yes ? 
  i was surprised when i read all the xenophobic comments , then i saw what subreddit i was in . 
  we should remember that for example sweden has had two prominent politicians murdered publicly in the last 30 years . 
  calling bulgarians uncivilized because of this incident is just that , an accusation without afterthought . 
  . . and not that interesting since 18-year olds are well within the normal age for living with their parents . 
  good on ya danes !, 
  i was surprised that there was such a difference between se and dk . 
  perhaps there is an urbanization component involved too ? 
  greater distances in fi and se might contribute to higher numbers of parent-dwellers ?
