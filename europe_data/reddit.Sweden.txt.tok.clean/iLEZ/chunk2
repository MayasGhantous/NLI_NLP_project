  pls tell those guys to stop shooting all the birds though . 
  `` kuk '' means `` cock '' , and the ending '' - is '' is similar to the german dimunitive '' - chen '' or '' - lein '' , something you use in a slang-y way to describe something as small or cute and friendly . 
  so `` cocky '' is his name in english .

  edit : saw ops clarification . 
  still no clue as to the merits of this distinction . 
  absolutely true . 
  at the same time i have a nagging feeling that this is a publicity stunt gone wrong , that they conspired to raise an uproar over clarkson quitting to get more attention to top gear , then people understanadbly started making comments like these , and now it has gotten a bit out of their hands and they do n't know what they are doing any more . 
  [ just a pet conspiracy theory .

  french customs officer asks for information at the border : `` name ? '', 
  `` angela merkel '' `` occupation ? '', 
  `` no , just visiting ! '', 
  that is certainly true .

  it 's even a logical fallacy with its own name . 
  if there was a `` nordic metal competition '' we would invite greece just like europe invites australia to esc . 
  it gets equally confusing in swedish : `` har du n\u00e5got f\u00f6r dig senare ? '', 
  `` have you something for you later ? '',

   `` however , police procedures and legal definitions vary widely across countries , which makes it difficult to compare rape statistics . 
  [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] for example , sweden reformed its sex crime legislation and made the legal definition of rape much wider in 2005 , [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 8 ] [ 12 ] which largely explains a significant increase in the number of reported rapes in the ten-year period of 2004-2013 . 
  [ 13 ] [ 14 ] the swedish police also record each instance of sexual violence in every case separately , leading to an inflated number of cases compared to other countries . 
  [ 8 ] [ 11 ] [ 15 ] additionally , the swedish police have improved the handling of rape cases , in an effort to increase the number of crimes reported . 
  [ 8 ] [ 14 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] raised awareness and a shifting attitude of sexual crimes in sweden , [ note 1 ] [ 18 ] which has been ranked as the number one country in gender equality , [ 19 ] may also explain the relatively high rates of reported rape . 
  [ 8 ] [ 11 ] [ 20 ] '' our inflated suicide-rates were an artifact of similar statistical mechanisms . 
  we reported people offing themselves as just that , whereas most other countries reported them as `` accidents '' . 
  now most countries report more correctly , and we 've sunk to a more `` normal '' level . 
  i 'd prefer `` suicide capital of the world '' , but the rape meme/myth works to get me triggered too .

  how much more * can * he sell the anti-vax propaganda ? 
  i think he * personally * probably does not care about vaccines or even holds these beliefs , he 'd probably sell pure arsenic baby food if that made a profit or looked good in his mind , but he 's giving major power to the anti-vax crowd by repeating the lies they keep telling themselves .

  good man !, 
  automoderator removed my linkedin url , but i link to my writeup on my webpage www.andersryttar.se, 
  i do n't know how i can prove it except [ linking to my writeup ] ( https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/day-i-accidentally-went-viral-anders-ryttar ) . 
  [ this ] ( https://imgur.com/gallery/2ah2z ) is the one i posted to reddit , i think they are pretty much identical , but perhaps giphy applied some further compression/sharpening to it when they reuploaded it . 
  they should !, 
  you 'd think after having been on all swedish national tv-channels and papers , on cnn and huffpo and buzzfeed and on jk rowling 's twitter feed , i 'd see some increase in job offers ... 
  thanks !, 
  that 's good to hear . 
  we all need a good laugh right about now .

  wow . . friatider . . really ? 
  my racist hillbilly facebook friends link to there , but on reddit ? 
  what subreddit am i in ? 
  i must be in * oh . 
  * i see . 
  my favourite time is when they did n't even know the swedish idiom `` det \u00e4r inte alltid ens fel n\u00e4r tv\u00e5 tr\u00e4ter '' ( it 's not always just one part that is to blame when two people are fighting ) , and based a whole article on the wrong assumption and published name and picture of a school principal that used the idiom . 
  that shit went on my sd-friends ' feed immediately , with smug comments like `` she 's completely over as a human being . '', 
  and other ill hidden ignorance . 
  true , friatider posted a correction after too many people laughed out loud in the comments on the article . 
  it 's incredible how much flag-flairs add to this subreddit . 
  so much information comes from that simple bunch of colorful pixels . 
  for better or worse . 
  if i answer `` no religion/atheist '' and in the next step say that my religious beliefs are very important , will that count into some sort of religious fanaticism-index ? 
  thank you kindly . 
  someone , comment on the top comment about what the hell this is about .
