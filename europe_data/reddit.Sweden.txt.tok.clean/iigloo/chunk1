those are the general opening hours , it does vary a bit from store to store . 
  most stores in the stockholm area are open to 19:00 on weekdays -- some stores are open to 20:00 . 
  it seems to be a legal grey-area in sweden , the city is evicting them now and destroying the camps . 
  a similar camp will probably pop up and be removed etc. 
  ehm , i do think you are a bit wrong about that . 
  you and your friends might not care about royals in general , but german tabloids ** love ** to write about the royal families of europe . 
  so there is obviously some interest in royalty in germany . 
  what ? 
  no , he is just explaining the very typical swedish state-individualism that do exist . 
  the guardian had a piece on it two years ago :  the linchpin of the swedish model is an alliance between the state and the individual that contrasts sharply with anglo-saxon suspicion of the state and preference for family - and civil society-based solutions to welfare . 
  in sweden , a high-trust society , the state is viewed more as friend than foe . 
  indeed , it is welcomed as a liberator from traditional , unequal forms of community , including the family , charities and churches . 
  [ ... ]  despite its traditional image as a collectivist social democracy , comparative data from the world values survey suggests that sweden is the most individualistic society in the world http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/feb/10/swedish-model-big-society-david-cameron, 
  in his defense , the data is not presented very well . 
  yes , this is the compromise agreed upon by eu-states . 
  if you live in another eu-nation for x amount of time you are allowed to vote in local elections and elections to the european parliament . 
  the time required is usually 3 months i believe . 
  it 's always a bit unfair when certain languages ' grammar makes it possible to create `` infinite '' words , although this list is rather fun anyway . 
  oh , yes of course , sorry !, 
  according to the original post it seems to be nations that did n't vote at all . 
  well , the reddit-stem-masterrace-circlejerk . 
  stockholm is mostly blue , just a few municipalities with other colours there -- mostly the southern suburbs it looks like . 
  skype was founded by a swede and a dane , the software was created by three estonians , all the while they had their hq in luxembourg . 
  it was the same people who brought us kazaa , in fact i think they based skype on kazaa technologies . 
  ( both are/were p2p ), 
  well , we do n't have a legal minimum wage in scandinavia . 
  salaries are negotiated by collective bargaining between the trade unions and employers . 
  i do n't think anyone in sweden would expect us to rank that high . 
  we * constantly * read in the news about how broken the railway is in sweden ... 
  i guess it 's not as bad as it seems ? 
  ninja edit : well , we do seem to rank rather average in the `` quality of service '' part so perhaps the public perception is on point . 
  i think the estonian coat of arms is derived from the [ danish coat of arms ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/national_coat_of_arms_of_denmark.svg/200px-national_coat_of_arms_of_denmark.svg.png ) ( estonia was once ruled by denmark ) . 
  perhaps there is some relation between the danish and english coat of arms since the english lions come from the norman dynasty who were descendants of norse vikings . 
  but that is just a shot in the dark , i have no idea if that could be the case , would be kinda cool though . 
   ( then again , lions are extremely common on european coat of arms ) . 
   some part in denmark yeah , probably sj\u00e4lland which is zealand in english . 
   norway has got the world tallest wooden building as well you might be getting som fierce competition from london in that regard soon : http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/architecture/the-toothpick-wooden-skyscraper-on-top-of-barbican-could-become-britains-second-tallest-building-a6975181.html, 
  eh several towns ? 
  sure there are suburbs , mostly soviet-style blocks , that are like that but several towns ? 
  c'mon -- the situation in these suburbs are bad enough , no need for hyperbole . 
  swedish eu policies have actually been rather similar to that of the uk -- meaning that sweden has been very pro free-trade but rather hesitant to the more political part of the eu . 
  and sweden has for a long time been vary of entering into unions or alliances , trying to stay neutral ( at least officially ) . 
  also swedish unions are very strong but saw their power diminished following the [ * laval * - case ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/laval_un_partneri_ltd_v_svenska_byggnadsarbetareforbundet ) . 
  if sweden had not been hit with the economic-crisis in the early 90 's i doubt we would have joined the union -- that crisis `` scared '' the public and the politicians into the eu in a way . 
  we almost saw the same thing happen with iceland following the recent crisis , but they withdrew their application . 
  the picture is real -- however it has been grossly misunderstood . 
  the kids in that photo are not 14-year olds , they are eight or nine year old , and are being visited by saad alsaudi who was 14 at the time . 
  people seem to misunderstand the context of the photo -- and believe that it 's a picture of kids of similar age ( which is a bit baffling , those kids are obviously not teenagers ) . 
  saad alsaudi is now 19 . 
  he came here with his family in 2003 from iraq -- his father had all the paperwork etc. 
  there was no need for him to lie about his age . 
  source in swedish ( same paper that posted the first story ) : http://www.kristianstadsbladet.se/kristianstad/man-har-bara-sett-bilden-och-rubriken-och-delat-artikeln/ ( however , the phenomenon with immigrants who lie about their age does exist -- the context in which this picture is presented however is just bullshit ), 
  new years eve before midsummer ? 
  that seems a bit strange to me , to be honest . 
  but i guess it could vary . 
  to me midsummer has always seemed huge , it 's always interesting how empty stockholm feels during midsummer . 
  i 'd probably also put valborg higher , but that is because i 'm studying in uppsala at the moment -- where it 's basically extended to a week of drinking . 
  but hey , the only holidays that * really * count are the ones where we basically eat and drink the same stuff : christmas , midsummer and easter . 
  they have been talking since the seventies . 
  hey , i kinda like it !, 
  a lot ( most ? ), 
  of the `` pr\u00eat-\u00e0-porter '' - designers in sweden produce their stuff in europe -- mostly in estonia or portugal . 
  you will not find many people on this subreddit that agrees with that assessment however . 
  and because of the long processing times , this means that many who have already arrived in sweden will be covered by the new rules ... 
  which is rather interesting -- some people who came here today expecting permanent residence will not get it when they are finally processed , months from now . 
  well , kinda . 
  the municipalities can ban public drinking in the municipality or in certain areas . 
  then it is most often combined with a fine . 
  in stockholm you are not allowed to drink in certain parks for example . 
  we always seem to get hate for our relation to finland during wwii , and i can understand , but our contributions to finland were rather substantial . 
  i mean we sent 1/3 of our air force . 
  of course , we could have done much more , but still - not all the hate is warrented . 
  yeah , i bet the same goes for the two other neutral countries on this map , austria and ireland . 
  i get that , and i do think all nato states should pitch in . 
  however that can not mean that the alliance becomes null and void . 
  i think his point with russia is more about trump 's statement about nato -- which was very worrisome for the smaller eastern european nations . 
  however we do n't really know if he was really serious about that or not . 
  which to me seems to be the most worrisome about trump , we do n't really know what his presidency will be like . 
  and i 'm not even from a nato country -- but i worry on behalf of my friends across the sea in the baltic countries , and overall on what the future brings for security in the baltic sea region . 
  well yeah , of course . 
  the referendum is not binding , it is advisory -- the uk is a representative democracy and the representatives will have to vote . 
   i meant that tax rates would be more likely to go up to their levels than go down to the levels of eastern europe . 
  well , not necessarily -- you can have a federal income tax and state income taxes just like in the us for example . 
  sure , here 's some pr : https://sweden.se/business/10-innovations-you-didnt-know-were-swedish/ and the older : http://www.sverigeturism.se/smorgasbord/smorgasbord/industry/inventions/ this wiki page is also rather interesting : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_swedish_inventors, 
  no , because the police lack resources to put people on planes back to their country . 
  and if the country refuses it gets even more difficult . 
  but yes , this is a failure of the immigration policies . 
  i 'm not quite sure , but the economy is viewed as healthy or even in a boom ( h\u00f6gkonjunktur ) by the households so consumption is up a bit . 
  employment also seems to be up a bit , however that will probably change a bit as ericsson has been forced to do some rather hefty layoffs . 
  service output remains really strong while the industrial output is still struggling somewhat following the global recession . 
  i 'd say that it 's the service industry combined with consumption from the households that is driving the gdp right now . 
  we do have quite a few structural problems though , mostly with regards to housing . 
  there is a shortage in housing ( which has driven up prices really high ) and the construction industry needs more people . 
  i mostly just translated some info from here : http://www.ekonomifakta.se/artiklar/2016/november/laget-i-ekonomin-oktober/ http://www.ekonomifakta.se/globalassets/lie/laget-i-ekonomin-oktober2016.pdf ^ ( ekonomifakta is run by svenskt n\u00e4ringsliv , an employers ' organization . ), 
  do n't know the statistics for public spending , but that could likely be up as well . 
   1814 when the treacherous danes aquired them eh , more like `` were not given to sweden with the rest of norway '' , 
  i think that list has a few errors though ( it 's very strange that sweden is n't even on the list ) ... 
  here is one per cup : https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/01/here-are-the-countries-that-drink-the-most-coffee-the-us-isnt-in-the-top-10/283100/ and another one that seems a bit more accurate when it comes to kg : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/maps-and-graphics/countries-that-drink-the-most-coffee/ you can still say suck it though !, 
  you could have used a variant of the [ national emblem of france ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_emblem_of_france ), 
  yeah the same thing happened in sweden -- telenor did it first and now all operators have free roaming before the deadline .
