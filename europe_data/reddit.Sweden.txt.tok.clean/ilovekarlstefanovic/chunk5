  i think it goes in this order : christmas , midsummer , easter , new year 's for the country as a whole , then where i live we `` celebrate '' valborgsm\u00e4ssoafton on the 30th april , while in other parts of sweden halloween/allahelgona might be more popular . 
  i listen to some french rap , most notably kenny arkana , aswell as stromae , and then i occasionally listen to dutch hip-hop . 
  and spotify keeps recomending me norwegian hip-hop . . 
  cyprus # 1 !!!, 
  [ from latin agricultura , from ager , `` field '' + cultura , `` cultivation '' . 
  ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/agriculture ) `` the art or science of cultivating the ground , including the harvesting of crops , and the rearing and management of livestock ; tillage ; husbandry ; farming . '', 
  also , the swedish work for agriculture is `` jordbruk '' , lit . 
  translation : use of land . 
  pretty interesting imho, 
   today that rivalry is settled in the ski tracks only because you never qualify for anything else : , 
   never heard of this before & already you 're saying that people support this . 
  [ 49 % of swedes , 50 % of finns and 47 % of the danes ] ( http://www.yggdrasil.fi/2014/04/varannan-svensk-och-finlandare-redo-att-lamna-eu-for-ett-nordiskt-forbund/ ) are in favour of a nordic union over eu membership . 
   and when i say shit , i mean places with no central heating and no running water . 
  yeah , i can promise it was not like that in sweden , besides the housing in only for the time untill they get residency permits . 
   i still cant believe we voted for this shit and we did n't . 
  mp and s gained virtually no voters , the alliance lost the election by themselves . 
  feels like yesterday !, 
  yes but in this case they 're behind in all aspects to the one leading the coalition , although they 're located overseas so they night not join the war effort . 
  how is the title clickbait ? 
  a clickbait title would 've been : `` you 'll never expect fact # 4 about muslims !, 
  5 facts about muslims . '', 
  this title literarily just explains what the article is about . 
  well sweden is very old too , but apparently the 40000 samis without any sort of sepratist movement would have an independent state while j\u00e4mtland , with a laughable but still existant separatist movement , would be a part of sapmi . 
  quote me on this : it 's because they 're at a relatively high altitude in general and that they 're far away from large water masses . 
   life expectancy is higher in germany is what you said , so i gave an alternate explanation to that . 
  i have no idea what healthcare system is better , but life expectancy is n't everything when it comes to ranking health care . 
  and germans also drink and , most importantly , ** smoke ** less . 
   so basically there is nothing to see in oslo / s why the / s ? 
   they had the last 8 years to do something it 's not the same party anymore . 
  reinfeldt moderates was very top-down , kindberg-batra moderates decisions are heavily influenced by the party districts . 
  from what i 've heard , we 're going to be taking in both , and nothing more . 
  possible , but unlikely . 
  omx stockholm has gone up 5,24 % this year , and 41,95 % the last 3 years . 
  the public sectors part of gdp is stable , sweden 's economical outlook is looking great . 
   well that does not change current state of sweden with housing bubble and now this ? 
  sweden can afford to bail out our banks , we have very low interest rates and a very low national debt , should the bubble ever burst . 
  we 're also seeing very strong indications of meassures to reduce the risk of it bursting . 
   not to mention i hardly find it convincing that the current parliament would have any real assurances for all of this when your governing vice pm starts to cry when announcing you have to merely lower the amount of immigrants ... 
  i do n't understand what her reaction has to do with anything , there 's ** very ** broad majority in the riksdag for the meassures that we 'll see the coming months . 
  we have three to four parties ( kd , m , sd , s ) that atleast supports what 's currently has been announced , and probably would support harsher meassures . 
  then we have two parties ( mp and fp , or liberalerna or whatever they 're calling themselves now , that will at support what 's been announced at the very least . 
  finally we have v and c , who both wants open borders . 
  v and c together got something like 11 % of the eloctorate , while m/kd/s / sd got something like 70-75 % of the votes . 
  edit : also , high household debt is n't a problem as long as they can pay for it . 
  with increased incomes i do n't see how it 's going to be a problem , atleast in the short run . 
  we have among the [ highest gross national savings ] ( https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2260rank.html#sw ) in europe . 
  besides , we have a very low national debt , so if we had to borrow money for some years to carry the burden we unfortunately took upon us we 'd be able to . 
  [ sweden 's gdp to debt was roughly 40 % , lower then finland , comparable to denmark . 
  ] ( https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=ds22a34krhq5p_&amp;ctype=l&amp;met_y=gd_pc_gdp#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=gd_pc_gdp&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country_group&amp;idim=country_group:non-eu&amp;idim=country:se:fi:dk&amp;ifdim=country_group&amp;hl=sv&amp;dl=sv&amp;ind=false ) [ our debt to gdp is stable . 
  ] ( https://www.riksgalden.se/sv/omriksgalden/statsskulden/sveriges-statsskuld-oversikt/historik-i-diagram/ ) and to add to that , we 're not going to have huge number of immigrants the coming year , virtually every political commentator agrees that if the numbers does n't drop further we 're going to essentially implement another [ `` lucia decision '' ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/luciabeslutet ) , stopping all immigration except for unhcr quota refugees . 
   - sweden does n't waste billions every year in useless agricultural subsidies and pork-barrel policies no , instead we waste way more on people with very low human capital . 
  i would add valborgsm\u00e4ssoafton / f\u00f6rsta maj to that too , atleast where i live everyone `` celebrates '' valborgs , having a large bonfire and getting shitfaced . 
   lets talk about why we demonize the iran that is objectively not quite as bad as saudi arabia . 
  in what way is iran objectively better then sa ? 
  state sponsored terrorism ? 
  check !, 
  mass executions ? 
  check !, 
  sharia law ? 
  check !, 
   when the world 's last absolute monarchy falls apart ? 
  saudi arabia is n't the last absolute monarchy in the world , agree most of the rest of your comment though . 
  and they do . 
  afaik russia is on fairly good terms with israel , so i 'd say it 's pretty likely that they atleast consider hamas to be terrorists . 
  i 'll look for it , but i 've mainly seen it on aktuellt/rapport ( largest news programs in swedish tv ) . 
   they answered positively , but until now , the only promise is about allowing france to have more debt . 
  swedish prime , foregin minister and defence minister has all said that whatever france asks of sweden , we will provide . 
  not that i think sweden would actually provide invasion forces , or ground forces other then special ops . 
  mens team fencing !, 
  not handball ? 
  literarily the first article that comes up when you search for '' \u00e5tal mot terrormord '' is this : http://www.gp.se/nyheter/goteborg/1.2783722-svenskar-gripna-for-terrormord, 
   the issue now is the language barrier stopping these people from getting assistance it 's not a language barrier issue , they simply just do n't have any rights to recieve government handouts , that 'd be entirely up to the countries who they 're citizens of , romania and bulgaria primarily . 
   not one of the jihadis that have come back to sweden have been prosecuted . 
  not one . 
  there 's a trial currently ongoing with three being prosecuted , do you even watch the news ? 
  none we are perfect and has never done anything wrong !, 
  [ this is the number of asylum seekers ] ( http://www.migrationsverket.se/download/18.7c00d8e6143101d166d1aab/1446451028489/inkomna+ans%c3%b6kningar+om+asyl+2015+-+applications+for+asylum+received+2015.pdf ) , not including this months numbers however ... 
   in sweden i had an old man last week ram his shoulder into me as i walked past him and he then turns around and stares at me , as if he was ready to throw down . 
  wait , do you want special treatment ? 
  that 's how most old , swedish , men would do if you walked into him . 
  are you implying that the jews did n't do this ? 
  l\u00f6fven wants to tear up dublin though . . 
   but it does n't seem like it would be in the spirit of the olympics to ban an entire country it 's only the russian atheltics association , they 're not actually banning russia itself from competeing . 
   you 'd rather have blood from some straight guy who have slept with 60 women in the past month than me ? 
  i 'm unsure about france , but in sweden you ca n't donate blood if you 've had a new sex-partner within the last three months . 
   somalia there 's safe parts of somalia , most somalians do n't have right to asylum . 
   parts of sudan are pretty bad , too but most parts are perfectly safe to live in , unless obvius reasons ( aka muslim convert , gay ) so no reason to ge granted asylum . 
   same with mali same as above . 
   eritreans only have right to asylum if they 're politically active , gay , muslim converts or other similiar things . 
  economic hardship is n't a reason for asylum and there 's no on-going war in eritrea . 
  pretty sure there 's a clear difference between basque and danish atleast . 
  the senate isnt there to represent the people though , it 's to represent the states . 
  a valid comparison would be the house of representatives , the house of the people . 
  it 's not a rivalry if you win all the time !, 
  \\  imlying you 're not mountain germans, 
  if that 's your opinion , fine . 
  i doubt we 're going to see many more come , we 're out of housing and they 'll for sure not get as good conditions as those who came a a year ago . 
  but for all we know why might seriously get a new `` lucia '' - decision . 
  incredible . 
   and that has n't been followed with a corresponding increase in democracy within the eu .
