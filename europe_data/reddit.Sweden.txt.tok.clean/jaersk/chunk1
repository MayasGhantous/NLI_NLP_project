well , i just quoted the wiki on it . 
  do n't know if it makes any difference , but svalbard is n't part of either schengen or eea as well right ? 
  to me it 's no question that svalbard is a part of scandinavia as a part of the scandinavian ethno-cultural sphere , and as you said a part of your kingdom and therefore also automatically scandinavian soil . 
  [ svalbard , which is under norwegian sovereignty , is not considered part of scandinavia as a cultural-historical region ; but as a part of the kingdom of norway \\ ( since 1925 \\ ) , it is part of the nordic countries ( norden ) .

   serbia v croatia , denmark v sweden , uk v continent , turkey v kurdistan most epic war ever . 
  bring it on , danskj\u00e4vlar !, 
  i 'm all with you on that . 
  just wanted to point out that the us is n't to blame for all of what 's happening right now ( as you said , that we know of right now , it would n't surprise me if something about the us causing big portions of this conflict would come to light in the future ) , but they 're more of a opportunistic grave digger seeking opportunities in a conflict masked as `` bringers of democracy '' . 
  yes , both the arabic gulf countires and us needs to share the burden of this , as they 're the ones fucking up the situation . 
  us intervention is n't the cause of the conflict though , just a very failed attempt at restoring peace and prevent further isil influence in syria . 
  whilst i think we can blame us on the recent massive influx of refugees , they are n't the cause of the conflict itself . 
  syrians came even before the bombings , but not at this extent . 
  syrians fleeing the war was inevitable , us just helped to speed up to process of them fleeing from the area by sending airstrikes . 
  in what way has us meddling caused the syrian civil war ? 
  i thought of it more as a result of the domestic unrest and a failed attempt to bring democracy by overthrowing the assad regime during the arab spring . 
  i mean , surely the us foreign politics in nearby areas has n't exactly helped syria in any way , but i do n't think they can be blamed for this situation . 
  it 's a bit unfair to include sweden , norway and finland ( surely a similar story with the other ones as well ) in these statistics without further context , since an absolute majority of the guns we have here are * hunting rifles * , you 'll never hear of someone having access to handguns or assault rifles here , the usage of our hunting rifles are limited to a few weeks a year , the guns are heavily monitored and needs to be locked up in a weapons safe most weeks of the year . 
  they wo n't help in the case of a terrorist attack , since the guns is locked up in a safe in your rural house most of the year , and is something that you are n't allowed to walk around with in public and highly populated areas where murder and terrorist attacks actually occur . 
  for protection from murder and terror attacks it would be more practical with a handgun , something that 's very uncommon here , and is very likely to increase homicide rates if introduced as a defense measure for the general population . 
  well as you said , we are defenseless in the events of terror attacks , but i 'd rather face that situation the few times they happen a year than have one of the highest homicide rates in the world . 
  i do n't get why we 're in such a desperate need of introducing more arms in our society , i would rather make the ones we already have go away . 
  could you name any other countries other than switzerland that has low homicide rates combined with a very armed population ? 
  get out of here , and take your fake umlauts with you !, 
  that 's the danish and norwegian alphabet . 
  sweden and finland has \u00c5\u00c4\u00d6 , while norway and denmark has \u00c5\u00c6\u00d8 .

  well , fortunately there 's no current threats to sweden , but we have an island called gotland that is of big interest to russia , as it serves as a perfect naval/missile station , but other than that i do n't really see any potential harms that could be brought upon us as it is today . 
  but who knows , in 5 years the situation could look vastly different , and then it would be too late to start spending on a proper defense . 
  yes , we 're manufacturing and selling quite advanced weaponry and military vehicles , a bit contradictory since our own army is n't performing as well as our arms industries does . 
  this have been proved time after time with russian fighter jet exercises near/in swedish territory where we 've been late/not even showing up as a response , and our chief of defense have stated that our defense maximal time of enduring a fighting invasion would only be ~ ~ two weeks ~ ~ * one week * . 
  our military is in dire need of reformation or collaboration with other nations . 
  edit : turns out our military ca n't even endure a two week invasion . 
  [ here are more information and the actual citation made by our chief of defense . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_armed_forces#criticism_and_research ), 
  i do n't think you should trust that site . 
  finland has about 5x more soldiers listed , and a very well maintained defense , they 've also kept their conscription . 
  we on the other hand , are lacking on so many levels , so that one could argue if we really do have an functioning army . 
  our defense is so underfunded i do n't really see any point maintaining it , and most of our equipment is outdated to the point that the domestic police force are better equipped than our army . 
  we 're barely signing up people for military service , and i do believe we 're relying on foreign aid if something were to happen . 
  finland would kick our asses if we were to fight , which we of course are n't going to do . 
   i absolutely adore folk music myself how ca n't you adore it though ? 
  it 's just a matter of taste and preferences really , since the whole world is filled with outstanding folk , and it 's all just waiting there for you to listen to it , there 's always something you can appreciate . 
  but yeah , i 'm very weak for the typical nordic folk as well , wardruna has also been my main go-to music when i 'm tripping , i 've always felt a bit more connected with my environment whilst being under the influence listening to wardruna . 
  but i 've also recently found out the wonders of greek and iberian folk , it surely is different but still nonetheless interesting and breathtaking !, 
  if you 're into a bit more `` worldly '' folk , there 's always [ dead can dance ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmnxey_tio ) , very powerful and almost ethereal at certain points . 
  edit : kulning is awesome , we have a `` hembygdsg\u00e5rdsf\u00f6rening '' ( no clue on how to translate that ) here in v\u00e4rmland that teaches out a local version of kulning , i can still remember hearing them practice so loud it could be heard down to our house a bit away , felt magical - to say the least . 
  oh , have n't heard any of those danish bands before , needs to be checked out !, 
  but both garmarna and hedningarna are very classic , i can really recommend anyone reading this to check out hedningarna in particular , they 're playing very folkish rock with a big focus on swedish folklore and sometimes a bit of finnish mysticism . 
  also , wardruna may be the best norse/viking-esque band ever . 
  i 've listened to a lot of kvitrafn 's ( einar selvik ) earlier works , but i must say that wardruna is his absolute magnum opus , as it has really painted up a definite `` viking sound '' , and it serves as a great platform for future works in a similar fashion . 
  but yeah , there should be more pan-scandinavian bands , following the concept with video you linked , so that you get a verse in all of the three languages . 
  there should be more stuff like this . 
  are there any pan-scandinavian bands/ensembles to your knowledge ? 
   there are a couple of funny youtube videos about how difficult it is to understand danish , even for swedish and norwegian speakers . 
  when my father went to eat at a restaurant in copenhagen with his danish friend , the danish waitress understood my fathers order in swedish but not the danish one . 
  it seems to me like danes are having a difficult time understanding themselves . 
  the rain along the west coast is no joke . 
  i can actually remember periods of not seeing the sun in 6-7 weeks straight when i lived there . 
  we had the housing crisis well before the mass immigration though . 
  it 's a separate issue and it was not caused by immigration , although it 's heavily amplifying the problem . 
  sounds really great , where can one go to acquire one of these poles ? 
  [ i can dig his watercolor paintings ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/de/the_courtyard_of_the_old_residency_in_munich_-_adolf_hitler.jpg ) , they 're quite decent really . 
  not `` being accepted to vienna academy of fine arts '' - material , but still good enough to really give an edge to the whole crazy dictator ideal . 
  a country known for their successful painters , and even more so for their not so successful painter . 
  wales is a country , but not a sovereign state . 
  i would however argue of whom of catalonia and wales is being more autonomous than the other though . 
  well , tell danmark to fuck off . 
  the glans named sk\u00e5ne is ours , and they better know it by now . 
  we would also like pommern back . 
  v\u00e4rmland indeed . 
  the dialect is called * v\u00e4rml\u00e4ndska * and we 're very fond of using umlauts here . 
  likewise , my vicious p\u00f6lse-eating savage brother . 
  i do n't know why , but before going through the comments i just knew that the danish propaganda bit was going to be about swedes . 
  [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/genetic_history_of_europe#autosomal_genetic_distances_.28fst.29_based_on_snps_.282009.29 ) suggests that finns are among , if not the most distant genetically related people from other europeans . 
  `` finno-ugric people '' ( namely a linguistic term ) do also share some unique genetic features , first and foremost ` hablogroup r1a1a1i ( z280 + ) ' , but there 's also some other possible similarities that could explain the often so controversial connection between magyars and fennic people . 
  even so , finns have like the rest of europe , mishmashed for hundreds of years with other europeans , mostly with swedes , russians and germans , so they 're in this mess together with the rest of us . 
  yes , the garbage we import gets transformed into furniture :\\ ^ ), 
  hey at least you did n't lose a war to emus like the australians did, 
   but then the swedes let us down well there was also this kalmar union thingy we had going on , which we swedes also completely ruined . 
  we 're very good at this . 
  but that 's suomen vastarintaliike , not soldiers of odin . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but they are two completely different things , soldiers of odin are like an extreme-right neighborhood watch , suomen vastarintaliike is the finnish branch of nordic resistance movement . 
  i do n't see any mentions at all of soldier of odin in the links you sent . 
  any sources on that they 're connected with the nordic resistance movement ? 
  also , oden is not a norwegian god , he 's an old norse god who was worshiped by * all * of the scandinavian people , not just norwegians . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/football_in_china  football has been one of the most well supported sports in china , since it was introduced in the early 1900s . 
  huh , til then . 
  table tennis still seems to be nr . 
  1 though . 
  i do n't think that question is racist either , but i do believe there 's a lot of westerners who think that just asking that very question is in itself racist . 
  furthermore , china does n't really watch football right ? 
  i 've always heard that they 're very indifferent to western sports . 
  `` so many black people '' - france is what they 're referring to i would guess . 
  hating on white europeans is as always fair game . 
  denmark still has the faroese islands under controll , whom are quite fond of killing whales . 
  also , norway is n't * that * cold , since most of the western coast is being heated up by the gulf stream . 
  it might also be that they have a more honest reply when talking about us , instead of with us . 
  yeah , it 's true that we import literal garbage , i think he/she is having a laugh about our immigration policy though .
