  well , you kind of have greenland already , should be sufficient enough ? 
  we 're going to v\u00e1lka all over you, 
  we still celebrate christmas , yule and christmas are both being translated to `` jul '' in swedish . 
  yes , christmas eve is around the same time as winter solstice , which along with summer solstice were heavily celebrated by norse pagans . 
  sweden still celebrates both of them , whereas i do n't know the status of celebrating midsummer in the other nordic countries, 
  so it 's not just here then . 
  kinda suspected it to be this way since the days before christmas , wherever i go i always notice a lot of people queuing outside of a very busy systembolaget , and it sometimes makes it to the news as well . 
  yesterday was christmas for us nordics , so today is a day of relaxation and feasting on leftovers , but here in my town ( probably elsewhere as well ) everyone will go out partying and get crazy drunk edit : grammar and words is difficult when you 're starting to get a bit tipsy, 
  no given time , but you need to at least have been there for 10 years to get your sentence evaluated to a timed sentence that ca n't be shorter than 18 years in total . 
  this means you never know how long the inmate will be there , but if they 're deemed fit for society and have behaved well they can sit the shortest amount of time , if not they can be held for all life . 
  that would explain it better . 
  thanks for clarification !, 
  a printing ban means that only the ones who already own the book , which in itself is n't banned , are able to read it without resorting to internet or libraries which correct me if i 'm wrong , only has heavily annotated and excerpted copies ( that 's how it is in sweden ) ? 
  it 's like forbidding further printing of the bible with the reasoning being `` nah it 's all good , almost everyone has one at home already that they can read . '', 
  i do n't know about you , but placing a ban on printing it seems a lot like banning it to me . 
  bavarian government also tried to stop a swedish publishing company from reprinting it as well , claiming copyright issues and sued them for 1 million sek but they lost in court . 
   `` those who can not remember the past are condemned to repeat it '' a state should under no circumstances be able to ban books , destroy books or censor books . 
  if our previous mistakes are n't open for the public to learn about , how can we make sure we 're not about to do them again ? 
  very uplifting news indeed !, 
  this is awesome , works of / pol / or / int / i assume ?

  i find it hard to believe that islam will ever be reformed . 
  the quran clearly states that this is the final word of the prophet given by allah himself , making it very hard to alter and that 's also why inimitability is a thing , most muslims consider the quran to be so devine you can never match its content with either speech or words . 
  the bible has almost always been interpreted in so many ways and in so many languages it ca n't really be compared with the quran .

  i genuinely feel so sorry for the french . 
  i ca n't even imagine the panic and anger people must feel , twice in a very short time now . 
  my condolences . 
  you guys should make it more attractive for people to come to you !, 
  10/10 , would recommend , totally not a plan for us to finally sink denmark ... 
  according to wikipedia they have something similar to jallu , so til !, 
  yes , drink some jallu and challenge a finn to a sauna contest . 
  do n't also forget to mention how you think sweden is a tad better at hockey , and you 're definitely guaranteed dead . 
  jaloviina ( \u00e4delbr\u00e4nnvin in swedish ) is made from brandy ( namely cognac ) , rectified spirit ( [ yes , the same stuff that 's used in hospitals and industries because of how highly concentrated it is ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/l%c3%a4karsprit#/media/file:spiritu_fortis.jpg ) ) and some sugar . 
  do n't ever drink this if you 're a non-finn , you 'll die instantly . 
  i like how they chose to just block all of the west coast with denmarks zoom in . 
  many of my favorite norwegian and swedish breweries are completely lacking . 
  well ca n't blame anyone for that really , we 're a bunch of herring eating heathens that come in a very insignificant number , whilst italy , france , spain , germany , uk , russia and so on have been the major power players in europe for a long time . 
  we had a shot at being recognizable ( and possibly even distinguishable from switzerland ) at our glorious period of stormaktstiden , but denmark , poland and russia decided that we ca n't have nice things . 
  meanwhile , up here in the cold north everyone is hating sweden , while our rivalry is dead locked with denmark . 
  [ neither . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/kb_norway.svg/2000px-kb_norway.svg.png ) the swedish and finnish has the same layout , except we do n't use those filthy \u00d8 \u00c6 letters . 
  the danish one however , is identical to the norwegian , except that they have a different layout . 
  oh really ? 
  [ i 'd say they were doing demonstrably well before finding their oil .

  i do n't get why this myth is so prevalent among swedes , one could almost think that we 're salty over that they now are richer than us ... 
  thank you , what to do here ? 
  i came here to avoid all obscenities in real life , heard that the internet is a safe and comforting place to be in . 
  you 're completely correct about that , but tbh i would n't mind them [ rotating it back to look like ours ] ( http://img01.deviantart.net/0258/i/2014/219/0/d/nordic_flag_proposals__scotland_by_daneofscandinavy-d7u3o7s.png ) . 
  i know it 's very trivial , it 's nothing but a flag , but at the same time i think it would be neat to at least have matching flags . 
  hmm , i do n't know really , something to discuss at the nordic council perhaps ? 
  maybe a coffee drinking quota should be placed as well in order to not have the english storming the place . 
  estonia can into nordic as soon as you 've changed your flag to a nordic cross one . 
  there , i 've said it . 
  now all baltics know how to get in, 
  those of us who live in the rural areas tend to be very introverted and shy . 
  urban areas like copenhagen and stockholm is a bit more open to talking with strangers , but these areas are still probably more introvert than other european countries . 
  if you like personal space and never interacting with strangers , you will love it here , otherwise you will probably just feel very alone . 
  i 'd argue that macaronis with ketchup and falukorv should be our new national dish . 
  i know that meatballs is like the most swedish thing ever , but in terms of the most popular dish the macaroni ketchup and falukorv-one has them beaten !, 
  hey since you 're now a german from austria , how about making germany * great * again ( bet you will never get tired of hearing that either ), 
  i would rather be unnoticed than in the center of all chaos . 
  trust me on this one , danskj\u00e4vel . 
  dalemasons, 
  oh , that explains it !, 
  i could never grasp the concept of `` syden '' when i lived there , maybe i 'm just too much of a robot to understand that it 's all about a * feeling * rather than a place . 
   by comparison with swedish at least we 're more `` loyal '' to the original names such our names for `` italia '' , `` milano '' , `` venezia '' , etc. 
  the reason why we call it `` italien '' and `` venedig '' is thanks to ze germans , we 've always had a thing for being like them . 
  if you scan through country names in swedish and german you will very quickly realize how we basically just raided their dictionaries for words , and might also explain bits of why swedish is a bit different from norwegian and danish ( although all three of us have major influences from middle low german during early medieval times , sweden never stopped loaning words from germany , and throughout the protestant reformation high german words and sayings spread like a wildfire in sweden ), 
  it 's clearly * grekland * , populated by * greker * and they speak * grekiska * !, 
  but on top of all weird shit norwegians say , can you explain to me where the hell `` syden '' is ? 
  it seems like all norwegians know where `` syden '' is , yet i have been answered with several different things . 
  is it sort of `` anything south of norway '' ( majority of the world in other words ) or just southern europe ? 
   whether it are asians coming for the tulip fields , brits for amsterdam to get high and wasted , germans for our beaches , or swedes for the gay sex in your kinky porno districts  but yeah , there 's no doubt that holland is where the action is at . 
  the same thing can also be said about sweden where the region where stockholm is located `` svealand '' is also the namesake for all of sweden ( sverige = svea rike ) , so i guess there has to be more countries where the name stems from their most prestigious area . 
  when i lived there i heard both terms quite often , i think it just boils down to whether they actually know that the provinces of holland is n't the same as the whole country . 
  but the same can be said with foreigners who do n't know that sweden , denmark , norway , iceland and finland are separate countries , and that the scandinavian countries are n't the same as the nordic . 
  if you do n't mind answering , where in norway are you ? 
  it varies i think , i hear both quite often . 
  i usually try to say `` nederl\u00e4ndska '' as i feel `` holl\u00e4ndska '' comes out as weird in swedish , but that might just be me . 
  as for the country , it 's officially called `` nederl\u00e4nderna '' but `` holland '' seems to be the most frequently used by common people . 
  i ca n't really think of anything that does n't sound really weird in danish . 
  yeah i remember dying of laughter first time watching that . 
  it 's like , after he chugged a whole bottle of rocket water you just think it ca n't possibly get any more stereotypical finnish than that , but then `` hyv\u00e4\u00e4 '' ... 
  i can probably talk about norwegian roads for hours , but here 's the shortest list i could do about it . 
  ** stuff that sucks with norwegian roads : ** - they can be * extremely * narrow , so narrow that you barely can pass a car , and it does n't help that the cars passing you on these roads are often farmers with big pickups/4x4s - not always so nicely maintained , especially during the winter . 
  but given your extreme nature and surroundings , it 's very understandable - fucking `` bompenger '' . 
  the amount you have to pay just passing these tolls are insane . 
  and to what good really ? 
  as i 've understood it , they started with the tolls in order to finance building roads , but most of it as i understand is already paid for . 
  why are you keeping the tolls ? 
  - the signs telling me where to go is often not saying what the next destination will be , but what is at the end of the road . 
  here in sweden , if the next stop is going to g\u00e4llivare , you will see 9 signs saying `` next stop , g\u00e4llivare '' and 1 sign saying that if you continue on this road , you 'll get to stockholm . 
  in norway , only 1 sign will tell what the next destination will be and rest of the 9 where you 'll end up . 
  ** stuff that does not suck with norwegian roads : ** - it feels safe as hell driving these very often bad roads , because norwegian drivers are the best . 
  i know you get tons of shit from my fellow countrymen , but goddamnit do i enjoy seeing how respectful and aware of your surroundings you are .
