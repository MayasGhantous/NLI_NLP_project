great story worth repeating : in protest of it being classed as a mental illness , people in sweden called in sick to work saying `` they had a case of being homosexual that day '' just to make a point of how ridiculous it was . 
  this was followed by an activist occupation of the main office of the national board of health and welfare . 
  within a few months , sweden became the first country in europe from those that had previously defined homosexuality as an illness to remove it as such, 
  that 's a weird perspective , makes the space station look like it 's the size of britain [ it 's actually the size of an airplane ] ( http://www.daviddarling.info/images/iss_747_comparison.gif ) it 's the equivalent of a room that is 7m x 20m x 3m in volume,

  with many countries rebelling right now , is it that it 's been shitty for a * long * time and people have put up with it , but now seeing other countries rebelling they rebel too ? 
  or is it that it 's gotten worse and worse the last few years and people want to get back to what it was like a few years ago ?

  clarification : sd stands for sverigedemokraterna ( sweden democrats ) and is ~ ~ an anti-immigration ~ ~ a xenophobic party ( my opinion ) that sits in the swedish parliament . 
  it had 10,9 % of the swedish votes in the latest opinion survey . 
  ( third place , with the # 2 having 27 % and # 4 having 8,2 % ), 
  [ on the euro coin ] ( http://lolpics.se/pics/8715.jpg ) [ general map ] ( http://bbsimg.ngfiles.com/1/18902000/ngbbs49d9c3aedfdfb.jpg ), 
  she 's perfect for this job . 
  to host this alone you need to have great confidence and not excuse yourself . 
  she is in a way very `` unswedish '' . 
  and let 's be honest : the thing we care about the most is that the host does n't speak swenglish . 
  we do n't have anyone more fit for this job . 
  bonus : she speaks french fluently, 
  it is n't though . 
  even ppp ` ed , norway is more expensive, 
  her humor is ( some times ) based around saying absurd things as if they were something normal . 
  so i guess it succeeded in making you go : `` okaaay ? 
  what was . . 
  huh ? '' . 
  europe does n't know that though, 
  what did he say about the host petra m\u00e9de ? 
  she is hated by many in sweden , people do n't like her humor, 
  sweden is vilks , right ? 
  as a lover of contagious laughter ... those guys are great especially when the games bug out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz2x8phai6y&amp;t=8m52s, 
  how can people be so comfortable naked . . ? 
  the fact that he did n't have a body guard was n't planned . 
  no could have known before he went out that he was going alone to the cinema that evening . 
  so either : 1 . 
  someone saw him go in to the cinema without a bodyguard and went home a got their gun , and followed afterwards 2 . 
  the swedish secret service told someone he was alone , and waited outside the cinema and followed 3 . 
  it was n't planned , and done by some alone maniac . 
  there are multiple ways from the cinema back to his home , and he did n't take the most obvious one , so the killer could n't wait along the way for him to show up because he did n't know which way . 
  there are no witnesses of a anyone following him from the cinema . 
  leif gw have said before that it is most likely christer petersson , but that theory does n't sell any book, 
  according to aftonbladet , the suspect and the ~ ~ diseased ~ ~ deceased did * not * know each other . 
  which makes it even crazier http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article21235950.ab, 
  i changed my mind , take him back take him back take him back, 
  wonder how many millions europe paid some company to come up with that one, 
  til every wrongdoing by the government is because of feminism , even issues that have nothing to do with feminism, 
  for fuck sake , it 's a logistics error . 
  it 's a socialist government , basic needs for everyone is a priority . 
  it 's true that they spend less on the military but they 'd rather send people home than not give them enough food if there was n't enough money, 
  but that does n't fit with / u/jms3r butthurt hate for feminists . 
  they worship soldiers ? 
  those barbaric slavs !!, 
  # 5.46 with the convert rate that was in june 2014 ( 1 gdp = 11.42 sek ) is 63sek . 
  the maximum price for quality cigarettes ( prince , malboro , lucky strike ) were 52sek in june 2014 . 
  that 's almost 20 % more expensive that it actually was, 
  you 've got several prime ministers , he 's talking about the youngest one, 
  whereas in swedish ` kurva ' means ` bend ' or ` curve ' as in [ this ] ( http://www.xn--vgmrken-5wac.se/wp-content/uploads/varning_vansterkurva.png ),

  not as far right as some other parties in europe , but still quite a bit far to the right, 
  it says * it will * pass finnish soon and it 's done by predictions , not hard coded statistics . 
  finnish i currently at ~ 2 % , and arabic is getting close to that as well . 
  this is too / r/me _ irl for me, 
  kilos per years i guess ? 
  i 've always found it weird that you name people who are only alleged . 
  an accusation can be as damaging as a conviction some times . 
  you hear a lot in the news , and a lot of people complaining . 
  but i have n't seen any problems at all .
