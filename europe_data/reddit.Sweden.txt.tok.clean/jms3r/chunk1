i dunno , [ better than the uk ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_development_index ) at least . 
  also better than japan which has no immigration to speak of at all and the world 's third largest economy . 
  so yeah i 'd say for a country with limited natural resources and very little arable land we are doing pretty fucking alright how 's gibraltar doing ? 
  it 's them british accents, 
  holland is a region in the netherlands , not the whole country, 
  '' * but do n't worry folks , we have some flare packs equiped on this flight and your captain took an evasive maneuver 's medal in flight simulator * '', 
  seems unlikely that they would happen to have a handball tournament in the country where their relative/contact lives more likely scenario is the contact set them up with something and they are making their way to another country in europe that is unless they really did just go rambo and decided to run away with 200 euro and no plan, 
  lol rest of europe are you even trying ?

  sam, 
  i think japan is a snake skull judging by the two front fangs, 
  ... is what we all like to hope [ is how your post should have ended ] my point is , russia be crazy , they might very well nuke a country that 's giving them serious troubles and then try to deflect responsibility with `` oh but it 's ok when us does it to japan ? '' . 
  justifying bad behaviour by saying the us already did it is their favourite thing to do after all, 
  i used to think we were past aggressive territorial expansion too , but russia is not on the same page as everyone else to them they probably consider their nukes to be evidence of how stronk their country is and might very well use them if they feel seriously threatened, 
  europe could never enter into a war with russia , especially not when they are acting crazy and irresponsible like this . 
  because , they have enough nukes to * carpet bomb the continent * . 
  people with autism are sometimes calmed by physical skin-on-skin contact, 
  do n't forget - we have the * correct * point of view , you do not . 
  you 're just not educated/enlightened enough yet to already have our point of view , but we can fix that . 
  u wot m8 , sweden is doing better than the uk on most fronts . 
  and if sweden is `` fucked up '' in some areas it 's only because countries like the uk , with massive resources , refuse to accept desperate people seeking asylum - so we pick up the slack , even if we have less resources go drink your tea and beat up a servant , you do n't seem to have any empathy or basic human decency so you might as well, 
  sadly , women do n't have the means to leave those places ( partly because family resources are pooled to the men ) also , a refugee camp like this is not a good place for a woman to be, 
  i released these as vassals in europa universalis 4 also perm and nizhny novgorod , perm is extra good because it stops them from expanding to siberia, 
  depends on the iq scale being used i think the most commonly used one normalizes against white us males but i 'm not sure anyway , a statistical mean does not mean anything unless sample size and confidence interval/p-value is given, 
  til switzerland is lazy, 
  this is mean iq , without a confidence interval or p value it is meaningless to compare these numbers, 
  no it 's a feature of our welfare state the only thing being done is politicians saying `` we have to create jobs '' but in reality of course they are just as unable to control the economy as anyone else and can only hope for times to get better also the right-wingers in this video do not oppose immigration on the basis of unfair competition for work . 
  those people exist too but they mostly oppose eu immigrants whereas the people in this video oppose non-eu immigrants . 
  they 're not related , i was just saying , if they had jobs and a family they might still mumble something about `` goddamn immigrants/fascists '' at the breakfast table but they would not go out and assault people in the streets, 
  i 'm saying youth employment necessarily is the first to suffer in a system like ours when economic times are bad, 
  our system is set up for job security rather than job availability . 
  the focus is on being able to keep your current job rather than being able to acquire a new one . 
  it 's just the older generation setting it up so they do n't get kicked out of the work force by younger workers really . 
  best example of this is our `` first in last out '' rule , basically it means a company can only fire the most recent employees rather than look at productivity etc. 
  obviously this is bad for youth employment rates, 
  extremism from either side comes from failure to incorporate young people into the work force . 
  people with a paying job do n't do this shit . 
  well ... it 's not quite like calling churchill a nazi in fact it 's nowhere near comparable , but it is pretty baseless, 
  say what you want about our tacky euro-pop but at least we do n't send `` engelbert humpercumberbatchdinck '' to eurovision ;p, 
  pretty great place to party, 
  exactly my feeling, 
  thanks, 
  great , more money to the fucking norwegians, 
  if the entire world was in nato , the us would still represent the main body of its military might , a few nordic countries will make zero difference, 
  from the people i 've spoken to i 've surmised it 's a result of a fear of `` hard science '' and the mode of thinking required for it ; a very descriminatory mindset where you discard nonsense . 
  many swedes see this as `` scary and dangerous '' when it comes to social issues ( re :20 th century communism/eugenics etc ) . 
  so instead people think they have progressed `` beyond atheism '' , that they are `` over it '' and have learned a more inclusive and informed perspective , they are basically trying to find a new way to be pretentious . 
  informed , and `` ahead of the curve '' without actually knowing enough to be informed or ahead of the curve , so they just end up being pretentious . 
  if you ask them what it is they believe in and try to make them define it they just say `` but maybe it 's more difficult than that '' or some bullshit cop out that simultaneously manages to be condescending really it 's just next-level / r/atheism circlejerking combined with poor schooling ( basically everyone takes `` social studies '' high school and no one takes natural science ), 
  but our stability is threatened and our progressive values prevent us from intervening , how are we going to solve this if we ca n't send americans to die for us ? 
  ( and then point the finger at them for being militaristic and barbaric ), 
  if a cheating country not in europe can be in the contest , why ca n't australia also be in ? 
  they seem to actually like the contest instead of just trying to ruin it, 
  i think if you added `` student '' you would see that / r/europe is n't such a filthy den of welfare queens :p, 
  polandball grammar is superior , how dare you question it, 
  lol at poland, 
  i 'm from sweden , they taught me that we used to be bloody barbarians and then militaristic invaders before we were enlightened by social democracy and started the folkr\u00f6relse to lift the arbetarklass from poverty and build the folkhemmet, 
  having a border with germany ? 
  i would translate it as * for fuck 's sake ruskie , we do n't need another carry * a carry is one of the [ roles ] ( http://dota2.gamepedia.com/role ) you want in a dota 2 game , but you usually want a limited number as they can be strong but require a lot of resources to become strong the not-thinking dota player usually picks a carry blindly regardless of team composition because they saw the endgame strength of that carry in their last game, 
  i wish i had some doge coins to give you, 
  since when is 25-34 `` young '' ?

  til sharon n\u00ed bheol\u00e1in nice , save that for later, 
  all abrahamic religions forbit it , islam is just the only one that still takes its text as literal truth and christianity/judaism have chosen to ignore that part, 
  indonesia, 
  are they allowed to act like that ? 
  [ here 's how we enforce the law over here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lipb6fzthgu ) [ also here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-h9ajtvlv8u ), 
   and as usual the swedes need norwegian press to tell the truth lol , tell that to the skavlan thoughtpolice editors, 
  too bad `` some '' speakers ruined it with calls for fighting violence with more violence and talking about completely unrelated shit like how bad immigrant workers are for unions and how the centre-right government is poromoting hateful thoughts with non-left economic policy etc. . . 
  [ it 's okay , we get the same stuff ] ( http://i.imgur.com/o3r6501.png ) at least we have each other [ although i get some weird results for danes ... ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kpkgexp.png ), 
  i accidentally spat out my goose blood soup all over my cod fish when he started the song he should have done * tomtegubbar sl\u00e5 i glasen * though, 
  so if this is * perceived * corruption , as opposed to objectively measurable corruption , is this not just a smugness rating ? 
  the countries that are the most self-gratifying smug little shits will end up on top , and so we are . 
  [ this is what goes on in every scandinavian 's head when any national performance ranking is mentioned ( that we do well in ... which is most of them ) ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6g-wnyixzm ) [ oh we are just sooo ahead of the curve guys , fuck yeah it feels good to be with so many * intellectuals * ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmtkediux8u ), 
  rectangular ballsack is right but i 'd add that , at least for stockholm , simply building more housing around the outside of the core city will probably not help that much - there are available appartments there now , it 's just that people do n't want to live there . 
  they need to stop being fuckheads about `` preserving the skyline of the city '' and just start building taller buildings ... 
  i would have said it 's bad grammar because removing the `` or '' removes nothing from the sentence , it 's just like ending a sentence with a preposition `` are you stupid or ? '', 
  has the same meaning as `` are you stupid ? '', 
  ( in the sense that swedes use it ) just as `` where are you at ? '', 
  has the same meaning as `` where are you ? 
  '' , both are considered bad form afaik, 
  i thought one of the more noticable instances of `` swenglish '' was the missuse of `` or '' to end a question ex : `` are you stupid or ? 
  '' , they would add the `` or '' because in swedish it is common to end questions with `` eller '' which translates to `` or '' in most cases . 
  other examples include `` do you want a drink or ? '', 
  and `` do you have the money or ? '', 
  honestly swedes judge their english by what `` sounds '' right as well . 
  i 've never gone back to grammar rules to figure out the grammar of a sentence when speaking or writing english . 
  i doubt a `` rule-based '' approach to learning english would even be successful because english is such an amalgam of loanwords from different languages which all follow different rules . 
  swedes learn most of their english by consuming english ( american ) media , being on the internet , and playing computer games, 
   remembering death . 
  i know we did the same thing but that sounds hella bleak, 
  i found that if you made an effort to speak french then french people were friendly in return almost as a kind of `` thank you for trying '', 
  hey man do n't call people slaves it 's discrimination, 
  wait is the head-nod not considered adequate social filler in other regions ? 
  * and a hundred percent reason to remember the name * ...
