  and if not how is this whole stealth idea even worthwhile ? 
  i mean the stealth would have to be * dramatically * better if f35 is going to be any good vs russian anti air for instance , if it 's just `` slightly better '' with a lot better aerodynamics then what have you really gained except a more expensive f-16, 
  ty for brain power russia keep up anti intellectual attitudes , policies , and culture pls much appreciate kkthx,

  i understood `` comparably high '' as meaning `` higher than '' if that 's not the case then i think we agree, 
  [ gdp per capita is not a reliable statistic during these years anyway ] ( http://ourworldindata.org/data/growth-and-distribution-of-prosperity/gdp-data/#difficulties-of-comparing-gdp-through-time ) but [ my other comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/37gyi3/net_financial_assets_per_capita_western_europe/crmnxbx ) uses these sources : http://ourworldindata.org/data/growth-and-distribution-of-prosperity/gdp-data/#post-1950 which includes the world bank among others,

  [ citation needed ] oil was found in late 1960s in norway up to then norway was below sweden source : http://ourworldindata.org/data/growth-and-distribution-of-prosperity/gdp-growth-over-the-last-centuries/ norway reaches parity in 1980 so when were your standards comparably higher ? 
  it 's because norway 's wealth was n't generated by work , it was just found by luck, 
  nowhere am i justifying the russian state as it stands . 
  what i 'm saying is it is developing into absolutist dictatorship , not totalitarianism . 
  and no they are not the same thing, 
  i understand the impulse to demonize russia/putin but what they have is not and will never be a totalitarian state partly because they do n't have the military or administrative capability to enforce such a state and partly because it would infringe on the orthodox church too much for the public to support it edit : to add : the anti-gay law you referenced is evidence of my point . 
  the russian state has never had an anti-gay agenda and the only reason this law exists is to placate the orthodoxy . 
  this is because the state knows it is not strong enough to stand on its own and must have church support . 
  a totalitarian state is incompatible with a strong and independent church . 
  it is however very compatible with absolutist rule ( source : most of 16-1900s europe ) . 
  this is common in all states it does n't make them totalitarian though for instance you are not allowed to own certain substances ( drugs ) or consume alcohol in certain places ( in most countries ) , this is an infringement in order to keep civil order but it 's not totalitarian, 
  fyi historical fascists actually self identified as fascist , it was n't always just used as a synonym for `` evil '', 
  i do n't think putin wants totalitarianism , he wants absolutism , which is not the same . 
  north korea is totalitarian ( the state dictates everything in your life ) , saudi arabia is absolutist ( a single person dictates what the state does ) you can have a totalitarian republic, 
  good job fifa, 
  probably because they think of them as corrupt and being unable to get the army what it needs to defend the country, 
  so next time do n't intercept let it come close enough to shoot it down with a surface-to-air system that ca n't reach russian air, 
   around 40 years of broken greek promises and lies do n't forget the lies, 
   it is illegal to criticize immigration no  they will collapse thanks to the politically correct left wing progressist bleeding heart nonsense politics we have better growth than most of europe . 
  maybe ask yourself what is going on in * your * country that thousands and thousands of your citizens are begging in the streets of europe, 
  it does include marital rape and same-sex rape ( because those are rape . . ) but on top of this each instance of rape is reported as a new rape in sweden , which is different from india and most other places where multiple counts of rape in a relationship only counts as one rape , while in sweden it would count as however many can be shown to have happened over the course of the marriage/relationship,

  i do n't understand russian but i 'm confident one of those checkboxes is : [ `` but where is proofs ?? 
  '' ] ( https://data.archive.moe/board/int/thumb/1416/43/1416432121939s.jpg ), 
  during wwi `` the morning hate '' referred to the ritual break-of-day artillery firestorm ordered by officers to prevent soldiers in the trenches from becoming complacent and/or unwilling to shoot the enemy on / r/europe i think of it as the obligatory torrent of swedish immigration articles and opinion pieces that have accumulated in the new section during the night, 
  . . is what swedes would like to think what it actually is is swedes are lazy and like comfy chairs so we stay within insulated walls 95 % of the day, 
  there 's been a housing problem for a long time in sweden to begin with ( or rather i should say , in major cities ) adding a 27 000 + influx of people needing a place to stay does n't exactly help i think the deal is this : swedish municipalities are tasked with finding somewhere to house x amount of refugees and are payed y amount of tax money ( cover costs + some more to make it an attractive thing for other municipalities to join in too ) . 
  the municipality then goes and finds somewhere to house the refugees ( hotels , rental housing etc. ), 
  now the way it 's set up it seems like in at least this one case the money awarded to the municipality is such that normal tenants ca n't pay parity with what the municipality would pay if the landlord hosted refugees instead of regular tenants , and so the landlord chooses the refugees why they get this much money per refugee i do n't know but i guess it might be some kind of idea to promote integration since we 've seen refugees are pretty unhappy if their housing ends up somewhere outside of a major city so maybe the municipalities get extra money so they can house them in more expensive ( central ) places, 
  but where is proofs ? 
  aka the uk has the most bankers/richfucks to skew the distribution, 
  having a narrow distribution does not guarantee a higher mean - everyone can be equally poor, 
  just to make this abundantly clear : there are very few things about the `` liberal party '' that you can actually call liberal their real name is `` the people 's party '' and they are pretty much exactly as authoritarian as their real name implies, 
  i know you might not understand this but altruism goes deeper than having your secretary bring you fair-trade coffee, 
  i never once had my english proficiency tested when applying for a us visa this is n't even remotely a relevant issue here it 's about the us only wanting beneficial immigration while taking as little responsibility for the instability they have created around the globe as possible, 
   i think in usa their definition of immigration is broader than just taking in refugees . 
  it 's broader in every country but no one is talking about limiting skilled immigration, 
  this is not the racist part the racist part is that they have a campaign targeting * specifically * immigrants as needing to work , the underlying assumption is that a. they do n't and b. they should because they owe it to `` us '' ( meaning us danes as different from `` them '' the immigrants ) also the work part is n't even the whole message i understand if you do n't read danish but they also call for stricter asylum rules right in the middle of a global refugee crisis and `` more demands on immigrants '' the last part is n't even specified what it is but it meant to convey a general sense that people who come to denmark have to earn their welcome rather than being welcomed from the outset this campaign plays to a political climate which reflects the attitude of danes towards immigrants , and it is clearly not a welcoming one, 
  yes but how is any of this relevant to whether we should honor our asylum obligations ? 
  the only relevant points are these : 1 . we 've made agreements 2 . we are committed to upholding those agreements in an * honest way * meaning we accept refugees primarily on the basis of * their * need , not our own . 
  3 . denmark is apparently not, 
  i 'd say the high proportion of degree holders from nigeria is mostly because if you are from nigeria and do n't have a degree or on your way to a degree you are simply not allowed into the us, 
  tolerance of someone who behaves just like yourself is not really tolerance though when we talk about a tolerant society we normally talk about tolerance of diversity e.g. 
  tolerance of practicing muslims in sweden the majority of people still have the aspiration to be a * tolerant * society , in denmark i would say tolerance has only ever been the idea that people can behave like danes do regardless of , or ( depending on the degree of racism ) in spite of , their ethnic background, 
   the amount of racists and xenophobes in the general population is at very similar percentages in both countries , but the media landscape is vastly different . 
  this is probably true but even abraham lincoln owned slaves it is possible to not be a racist and still participate and perpetuate a public debate that is framed in a racist way also you do n't have to be an overt racist to disconnect your empathy from the sheer number of refugees that currently need to be taken care of , but doing so results in discussions where the rights and lives of those refugees become vastly undervalued compred to trivial things like a `` hygglig '' copenhagen city life, 
  if the argument is that the current political climate in denmark is not evidence of nation-wide racism because it is a `` factual discussion about what we can reasonably afford '' as you suggested . 
  then having a poster explicitly singling out immigrants as `` having to work '' being part of `` empty rhetoric '' if anything proves the opposite namely that danes are by and large pretty racist and the current political climate in denmark is a reflection of this, 
  it is pretty meaningless though as socioeconomic status , as commonly used , is a nebulous concept and therefore `` adjusting '' for it really just means `` adjusting for wealth/income gap '' which is not the same, 
   it is , but that does n't mean that we should n't be willing to talk about culture . 
  we should n't let racism or fear of it dictate political dialogue . 
  what meaningful discussion can be had regarding `` culture '' though ? 
  who is silencing debate ? 
  what debate ? 
  if the debate you want to have is about if x ethnicity has a culture that makes them y and therefore we should z then i can make redundant all future such debates by the statement `` no set of xyz exists such that legislation should target x '', 
  `` adjusting for socioeconomic status '' is not something you can simply do nor is any social science study accurate enough to where this would be a meaningful thing to try to do, 
   saying `` we can only handle x amount of immigrants '' http://www.thelocal.dk/20150323/danish-pm-party-touts-hardline-on-immigration that 's not what you are saying nor the rhetoric you would use to say that the posted campaign shows pretty clearly what the view of immigrants is in denmark , which is `` you betta pick dat cotton son or ya get the whip again '', 
  no but it is common practice for genuine racists to substitute culture for race in order to present a racist point of view while pretending to not be racist analogous to a slave owner saying `` it 's in their culture to pick cotton , i 'm not a racist '', 
  they are unhappy about how racist we are making them look, 
   there is no reason why a college educated person in europe should n't be allowed to apply for any job they are qualified for over here . 
  my problem is not how hard it is for europeans to work in the us , it is in fact pretty easy ( having done it myself ) my problem is it is * so much easier * for europeans to work in the us compared to iranians/iraqis/pick a country, 
  http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/jun/19/refugees-unhcr-statistics-data the us accepts about the same number of unhcr refugees as the uk and sweden this is not proportionally what the us should be taking in as for immigration there are two hurdles for coming to the us : 1 . you have to get there ( rules out refugees pretty much ) 2 . if you are an immigrant , you have to be `` wanted '' in regards to point 1 , most european countries take in so-called quota refugees from un camps which means taking in refugees that are normally not able to get to your country and for point 2 . the us immigration system is notoriously geared towards accepting `` skilled '' immigrants, 
  the us is not exactly picking up any slack though http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/jun/19/refugees-unhcr-statistics-data taking in the same absolute numbers as the uk, 
  most people in sweden know this and are ok with it most people recognize that the over representation in crime statistics and otherwise has to do with socioeconomic factors and want the discussion to be about reducing these factors ( become a better society ) rather than about if we should respect international agreements on asylum seekers ( give up our national morals , like you have in denmark ), 
  good contribution to the discussion, 
  young to young-adult men are more likely to be racist young to young-adult men are more likely to be on reddit young to young-adult men are more likely to favor a counter-mainstream narrative the overlap is significant,
