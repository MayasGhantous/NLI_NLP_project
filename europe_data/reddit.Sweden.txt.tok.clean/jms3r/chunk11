  finland yes ? 
  that ottoman expansion and random moldovia migration curious to know what were the allegiances like here ? 
  were russia and ottomans gon na fight ? 
  on the holocaust/ww2 thing i think it 's because germans are pretty much taught to distance themselves as much as possible from ww2 germany in many germans ' minds that i 've talked to , `` modern germany '' pretty much began with the marshall plan and is a different society altogether from what was before, 
  fact : fertility is good for gdp growth you should be happy about it ( provided those kids are put into that sweet school system of yours ), 
  dat eu money, 
  we 've had a good run massively over-performing , pretty sure germany will overtake us next year though, 
  according to my current ironman teutonic knights eu4 playthrough , it 's all prussian, 
  i was n't saying everywhere else is perfect but i will say he felt it more in switzerland , especially when searching for housing/job and getting stopped by the police every other week, 
  wtf we were in switzerland for a year it is n't unreasonable to assume at least some of the people we interacted with were swiss, 
  i 'll be honest i did n't track down every person involved in these incidents and ask them if they were swiss born do n't think it matters much though, 
  why would i rewrite my own experience from the point of view of an imaginary white friend ? 
  also , even if it was so , why would it even matter ? 
  explain, 
  as someone who 's been in switzerland i can confirm it 's pretty good , if you have white skin ( last part is very important ) me and some friends , one of who was arab by background ( but swedish culturally and otherwise ) , had * very * different experiences in switzerland he would regularly get stopped by police and searched he had enormous problems finding housing ( very clearly because he did n't look like the rest of us ) job was out of the question ( we were exchange students some of us worked on weekends ) overall very different attitude from people if you are brown , would not recommend . 
  if you are white , pretty cool place . 
  greece did n't have an irs ? 
  not sure if troll, 
  surprised me too when i found out, 
  to white people the reaction is mostly positive , to english-speaking white people the reaction is even more positive , to anyone not white there seems to be a lot of racism, 
  regarding that eu referendum , [ the irony ] ( http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/media/images/82812000/jpg/_82812448_455481274.jpg ), 
  looking at previous years it seems to have gone from pretty strongly `` leave '' untill 2013 when it started swinging to `` stay '' new generation coming of voting age ? 
  or what changed, 
  lots of countries do n't have blasphemy laws, 
  freedom to roam a prison cell is not freedom , a fat person in a compression suit is still a fat person regardless if you actually want to blaspheme or insult people or not , the very fact that you * ca n't make the choice * makes whatever peace you have a hollow one, 
  no , the us is very much trying to enter partnerships with pretty much everyone including russia the fact that russia is impossible to be a partner with is not the fault of america, 
  yes , depending heavily on where you are from i did n't think this was an issue at all here for a very long time until i had a girlfriend from another part of the world turns out swedes are racist as fuck, 
  [ polls predicted about 34 % votes for conservatives ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/politics/poll-tracker ) [ conservatives got 37 % of votes ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/election/2015/results ) not perfect , but not very far off either why they have a majority of seats is due to your electoral system , but the accuracy of the poll was n't that bad regarding proportion of votes . 
  what the fuck this behavior should be punished not rewarded why ca n't we have a us-style system where you have to subscribe to certain core values before you are allowed in ? 
  have any polls at all suggested a referendum would end up in favor of leaving ? 
  pretty much yes, 
  well , shit . 
  what i find crazy is that belarus lost 1/4 of their whole population imagine every 4th person in a country just being dead , i do n't think even the black death had those % numbers, 
   anyway , the f-35 , it 's a good aircraft . 
  it could be a good aircraft , but we have the same plan for a fifth-generation aircraft , also . 
  of course , you are ahead in yours . 
  they 're both good , but they 're both in the testing phase . 
  that 's interesting considering how much criticism the f35 gets from the west, 
  tough *, 
  because we take moral responsibility and see an enormous humanitarian need in the world what does denmark contribute ? 
  driving up antibiotic resistance by stuffing it into pigs , good job retards . 
  just fyi disenfranchised is not the same as disillusioned disenfranchised sounds like someone is actively discouraging them from participating in the democratic process rather than them just being disappointed to the point they stop caring, 
  well invading a country is n't cheap and the money 's got ta come from somewhere if putin wants to maintain the nationalist fervor and become president for life, 
  can someone explain why danes have such low tolerance for brown people ? 
  the two population centres of stockholm , [ s\u00f6dermalm and norrmalm ] ( http://www.statistikomstockholm.se/images/statistik_pa_karta/befolkning%207%20%c3%a5ldersklasser.pdf ) both have interspersed [ 60s buildings ] ( http://www.ourtravelpics.com/stockholm/stockholm_220.jpg ) with old [ start-of-20th-century buildings ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/sweden._stockholm._norrmalm_020.jpg ) and the latter somehow always find a way to stop the former from being torn down and rebuilt or stop any kind of urban development at all for that matter case in point the central traffic hub slussen is in the middle of being rebuilt and people in some of the old buildings do n't want the new bus terminal to be * in the same mountain * as they are living on top of because `` fuck you '', 
  yeah soon you will join the rest of the [ zombie economy ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.mktp.kd.zg/countries/eu?display=graph ) sitting at around 0 % or negative growth, 
   danger of turning cities into historical disneylands stockholm suffers from this ** so much **, 
  the ceasefire was only advanced by putin because his supply line to the rebels was not strong enough to support the casualty rate of the rebels now that he has had time to funnel more troops and supplies , time to attack again . 
  they are militaristic and aggressive while holding nukes , that is not the same as having power they have pretty much zero allies and their economy is weak , they have the gdp per capita of a south american country if india started bullying nepal ( random example ) and threatening to use nukes if anyone interfered , no one would see it as them exercising their `` great power '' . 
  similarly with north korea , no matter how aggressive their foreign policy stance is it does nothing to improve their status as a great power, 
  it is a sovereign state , they are in no sphere of influence but their own, 
   they go above and beyond to prevent ukraine from joining the eu or nato why is this russia 's business ? 
  as someone who has been heavily using both the swiss and swedish train systems it 's interesting to see them rank so close when their challenges are so completely different in sweden it 's about connecting relatively long distances and having a nice density of trains at reasonable cost in switzerland it 's pretty much the opposite - very small distances but the challenge is to make the traffic run smooth overall i prefer the swiss railway, 
  this feels like a ridiculous ranking system seems like it 's just a `` corporate power index '', 
  china is actually pretty committed to security as it is a prerequisite for growth which in turn is the main thing keeping the power status quo in china atm would be cool if china could stop the russian mafia tactics in central asia , maybe open up a couple of pipelines from there, 
   uk had exact the same level in 2005 as it does in 2013 , and germany actually went up , from 18.4 % to 20.3 % . 
  probably because poor people in the east migrate west to look for jobs or better conditions kinda depressing to see romania/bulgaria still at  40 % , wonder what those countries must have been like before they joined the eu, 
   and their colonies pretty sure he covered iceland, 
  `` list of nordic noir shows currently on air '', 
  having been there and seeing how similar looking tallinn is to a random swedish town i 'd say they are nordic for those that doubt me : [ this ] ( http://cheapvacationholiday.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/tallinn_how-to-get-there_9.jpg ) vs [ this ] ( http://www.spacescape.se/wp-content/uploads/sigtuna_450x300.jpg ) ca n't say i could personally tell the difference between estonia and sweden if i was placed in a random location of either country ( without looking at signs and stuff ) traditional clothing also is very similar, 
  somewhere a finn is boiling with rage right now, 
  it works for norway and switzerland i think the fear of `` everything goes to shit if you leave eu '' is way exaggerated that said i think the eu is at its core a worthwhile idea and we should work to fix it rather than throw it away, 
  because they share a number of socioeconomic problems as a group and are commonly referred to as immigrants because it is shorter than `` children of immigrants '' they also often refer to themselves as immigrants, 
  when we say `` immigrant student '' they are not really immigrants but rather sweden-born children to immigrants they grow up knowing only swedish or sometimes bilingual , the language is n't the problem, 
   the report blamed the system of school choice for the failure of almost half of children from immigrant backgrounds ( 48 % ) to make the grade in mathematics . 
  so their `` fix '' is to force good students from an immigrant heavy neighborhood into the masses of jackasses sitting in the back of the class with jackets on shouting shit at random instead of giving that student the option to go to a good school this can clearly only have a positive outcome  the report also recommends helping disadvantaged families make better school choices , so that their children , as well as those from middle-class families , apply to the country 's more popular , better performing schools . 
  sorry you are admitted on the basis of grades , a failing student will not get in to anything other than the immigrant heavy schools the problem is n't the schools themselves , it 's the students that are funneled into that school by the elective process, 
  yes the maidan was totally a western cia plot to secure gas pipelines, 
  commonwealth ii : the re-delugening ? 
  probably not much but i do n't think texans have the same aversion to camo as an average european so they probably consider it unnecessary, 
  texan police have increasingly desperate mexican drug cartels right across a notoriously permeable border as well as general access to very heavy weaponry for the public the idea of having to be on guard against an enemy might not be as inappropriate for them as it is in europe, 
  it was a submersible fishing boat , designed to fish the biggest fish which are obviously closer to the sea bed so you have to go under water to catch 'em, 
  the camo is secondary to the bullet proofing , they probably get surplus vests from the military so they can afford it on small scale budgets that 's why it has desert camo but tbh they are supposed to protect the public from potential ( and in this case realized ) violence it only makes sense that they have gear to protect themselves, 
  what are the main things the finns are sticking to ? 
  getting rid of swedish as official language ? 
  i was wincing at this point, 
  sign agreement to split up poland and allow hitler to invade france without worrying about eastern border -  did the most to win the war ? 
  bullshit the ussr might have had the highest casualties but they only `` won '' by being betrayed by hitler and forced on to the winning side . 
  they would have been happy to have germany be busy with the west while they purge and massacre finland poland and the rest of eastern europe it was a piece of shit regime right from day 1, 
   i did not argue that the eu would have the largest economy or run the world as an empire . 
  instead i claimed that the eu offers a good life in an interdependent world and that its core operating principles would spread until they became the world 's . 
  contrary to popular perception and a lot of careless news reporting , embassies are the sovereign territory of the country in which they are located , not of the country whose diplomatic mission is housed there . 
  that is why an office building can host an embassy on some floors and , say , a bank on others . 
  the reason for the misperception is probably that the vienna convention states that the local government foreswears the right to enter an embassy , and diplomatic immunity protects the diplomats working inside . 
  however , this does not mean that that space is somehow transmuted into the embassy nation 's soil or legal territory for purposes of law enforcement . 
  imagine , if a person should enter the british embassy in china and kill someone , who do you think will arrest him ? 
  correct answer : the chinese police . 
  they can not enter the embassy without the ambassador 's permission , but with that permission they will go in , take away the miscreant , and then try him in chinese court under chinese law . 
  or else the embassies security officers will deliver him to them outside the embassy gate . 
  imagine , if you can , the utter nonsense of the fellow being hustled onto an airplane and flown to london for trial . 
  you do n't have a flair but unless you live in norway , sweden is still a better place to live than your country so what is your country doing wrong that sweden with all our immigrants are still doing better than you ? 
  media is always raving about the `` fitness madness '' and how we are too obsessed with being fit so i 'm gon na say it 's very important, 
   could be , i was just ~ ~ speculating ~ ~ * assuming * ,, 
  success breeds jealousy, 
  there was that one period when they had a very efficient propaganda machine to promote a certain ideal i forget who the man behind it was i think it was josef gobblers or something, 
  yeah we are on the verge of sending people to gulags in sweden / s good chat, 
  i 'm happy to have a parliament full of politically correct people rather than have a parliament full of pedophiles there are worse things than political correctness also , we have plenty of open discussions about immigration which is why we are able to identify the racists as being racists in the first place . 
  for example , given the choice between either an idealized full integration of immigrants to the point where there is no socioeconomic differences or sending them back to where they ( or their parents in many cases ) came from , they openly choose the latter . 
  this is racism without question ( note that this means they want to send people with no other citizenship than swedish over to iraq or iran and cancel their swedish citizenship , based on the fact their parents have iraqi/irani passports ), 
   `` oh no , a black dude walking towards me ?
