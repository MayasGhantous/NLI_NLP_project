  i can not appear racist ... how do i hold myself in the most non-racist position possible ? 
  shit , i do n't know how , does he think i 'm racist ? 
  i 'll just ignore him '' projecting much ? 
  these are foreign borns of * today * meaning it 's an ongoing immigration , children of the 50s and 60s wave do n't show up in these numbers ( if i read them correctly ), 
   this level of political dogma has n't been seen since soviet russia . 
  being careful not to be racist = political dogma okay dude, 
   dog fighting : the humans just watch . 
  humans put the dogs in that fighting pit though , humans are just as responsible for the violence in a dogfight as they are in bullfighting, 
  yeah the idea was to scrap the old defense to modernize and create a new one , only the latter never happened, 
  freedom and security are on a seesaw , we prefer to sit on the side of freedom i do n't see islamists as a problem we have to deal with - they will eventually get themselves killed, 
  dog fighting - either animal has a chance to win cock fighting - either animal has a chance to win they are both animal abuse and barbaric and are rightfully outlawed why would it be different if the bull had a chance to win ? 
  as soon as russia invades a member e.g. 
  the baltics, 
  the security spending increase in scandinavia is minimal and it is n't at all to do with `` homegrown islamic state fighters '' the spending increase is about deterring russia nothing else, 
  yeah someone pointed out it 's not the same color, 
  unless you are doing a colonial game this is doomed to fail because you can never take central europe without eventually having to fight russia , great power rivalry and territorial disputes always break down the alliance and even for colonial britain you want to ally with hre rather than russia cus then you can gang on france, 
  if playing eu4 has taught me anything , it 's that you got ta tear up muscovy right as they gobble up the novgorod republic and then feed your novgorod livonian and perm vassals all them russian lands using masses of mercenaries and lots of national debt otherwise they never run out of manpower, 
   russia will never attack sweden to conquer it as there would be minimal gain to high expenses . 
  if there were ever a war over the baltics there would be a race for swedish territory between nato and russia in gotland \u00e5land and southern sweden as they are all crucial tactical positions for the baltics - place some s-400s on gotland and the baltics are isolated from the rest of europe completely and us airforce ca n't do shit about it . 
  given what russia has shown itself willing to do , it is not at all unreasonable that they would seize gotland `` just for the war '' , isolate the baltics , annex , and then not give gotland back for the same reasons israel will not give the golan heights back, 
  reddit , the place where boilerbuttslut weighs in on geopolitics, 
  he had pretty popular support for a while but recently he has had a fall from grace i think, 
  also fresh water and salt water [ `` do n't mix '' by magic , this guy thinks he can refute science using bbc documentary footage ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hfv4tcpyso ), 
  let me just point out that homo sapiens did not evolve from neanderthals , neanderthals evolved separately from homo sapiens although we seem to have absorb some of their dna through interbreeding but the same is true of denisovans and other early hominids http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/archaic_human_admixture_with_modern_humans, 
  a lot of them actually use it for themselves too it 's possible to call yourself asian for instance without thinking `` asia '' is a single country, 
  this is because part of what europe `` is about '' is to not swear allegiances to flags, 
  if i 'm reading this correctly northern ireland still likes farage ? 
  i am now moist ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  girls have xx so a mother can only ever provide an x chromosome the y has to come from the father, 
  seems like the kremlin learned some stuff from fox news tbh, 
  i really hope ukraine can join the eu some day, 
  tomorrow 's headline breaking news : all people stop living when they are dead, 
  qatar , singapore , and kuwait have every opportunity to be very high on this list in terms of gdp per capita south korea is also very rich and israel has higher gdp per capita than japan not sure what you mean by `` first world '' though the cold war order of nations is n't valid any more also , south africa is a first world nation so is turkey and iran http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_world edit : sweden and finland are technically third world, 
  if you pool all the nordics to one `` state '' you still get 6 out of the top 10 being european [ looking at what is dragging the us down ] ( http://www.socialprogressimperative.org/en/data/spi/countries/usa#performance/components/usa/ ) i do n't think many states would stick out that much maybe san francisco and seattle are better than the us average but la for example would drag california down a lot on at least health and especially personal safety ( nowhere in west europe has anything like crips and bloods ), 
  i guess whether you belonged to the `` master race '' played a pretty decisive role in how you were treated, 
  i did n't know there were eu battlegroups  i 'm not sure what you mean by this . 
  i mean that right now , the us is prevented from selling anti tank arms and other things to ukraine by russia 's hybrid warfare strategies . 
  namely the propaganda initiative russia currently has where the framing of the discussion is about the us escalating the ukraine war into a proxy war if they more actively step in . 
  this is because the us would not be able to blatantly lie about their involvement the way russia does , because the us is not russia . 
  now , if russia is forced to place a veto in the un security council , it can no longer pretend outwardly to care about ukrainian sovereignty ( as russia is doing right now ) and the discussion is no longer about the us escalating into a proxy war or trying to establish us-friendly puppets but instead russia will have shown its hand, 
  thought we needed something positive, 
  to my knowledge the eu does n't have a military so who is going to make up this peacekeeping force then ? 
  putting a force together from nothing takes too long for what ukraine needs i think ? 
  would make more sense to go to the un , which has an armed peacekeeping force and organizational structure in place also it would force russia to take a definite stance instead of outwardly saying `` we support ukraine 's territorial integrity '' on one hand and then on the other warning the us about escalation with weapon sales once russia places the veto then the us does n't have to listen to `` let 's not escalate '' any more because russia will have taken their stance, 
   ` alpha vs beta ' dominance-games , though these are so basic as to be mostly characteristic of chimpanzee societies . 
  this is the `` he 's just not being challenged enough '' - thinking of a parent to a failing child transposed to international negotiations . 
  no that 's not the problem , the problem is your child is an idiot . 
  inb4 russian veto though, 
   `` i do n't know what plans the americans have for us in the end '' as someone who did military training in a very peaceful country with no prospect of war i can still , from the training exercises we had , imagine what a hellish position this is to be in : not knowing when it will end or if help is coming or even what resources the enemy has ; is it unending ? 
  are we going to suddenly be run over by a full russian tank command ? 
  if ever eu countries * should * be interested in a peacekeeping operation , this is it, 
  for sweden i get food beer gas alcohol where did you get these results ? 
  britain more than any other european country is responsible for there being this many refugees would be nice if you could take some responsibility, 
  http://www.globalhumanitarianassistance.org/countryprofile/somalia somalia receives plenty of economic aid also , is your argument for why the west is responsible for the development of somalia really that the west ** has not ** launched a full scale invasion on it ? 
  having been left to their own devices for this long , is it not reasonable to expect at least some small progress towards civilization on their own ? 
  why is the expectation that they self evidently need to be * dragged * into civilization and can never do it themselves ? 
   how convenient of you arguing `` why does the international community has to intervene '' after i listed several examples where intervention ensured democracy one time after the other . 
  the responsibility of the us towards italy or any other country it invades is very different from what the situation was in libya as for south korea , the us did a lot more of the brunt of the fighting but they did very little in terms of whatever you want the international community to have done to silence the muslim brotherhood or other factions inside libya . 
  the south koreans had a pretty unanimous desire for self rule and democracy and the us did not have to fight militant fifth columners within the south  internal stability is dependent on external conditions . 
  there is no way around that . 
  you can have a populace clamouring hard for democracy , but if outside powers are not prevented from interfering there is next to nothing that the people themselves . 
  i guess you meant to continue `` can do '' well tell me then how did the west develop freedom and democracy ? 
  are you telling me the french revolution was not met with resistance from the * whole of europe * ? 
  have you heard of the napoleonic wars ? 
   the un already did such stabilisation with cambodia in the form of a transitional authority - which ensured a transition from decades of civil war , foreign occupation and pol pot towards sustainable democracy the attitudes of cambodians to the west and libyans to the west are very very different, 
   but they kept their infrastructure as well as the bureaucracy which is key to stability . 
  [ yes so much intact infrastructure ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bombing_of_tokyo#results ) , this is a ridiculous argument . 
  * every major japanese city was reduced to dust by the end of ww2 * . 
   also , keep in mind that afghanistan is the size of france , but has half the population ; and afghanistan is plagued by internal etnic disputes ( civil war ) . 
  and again we come back to the problem of why is it the responsibility of the west to save them from what they clearly want to do which is kill each other ? 
  these issues will continue to exist in these populations until they have suffered enough self-inflicted hardship to have developed a sense of their own that there is a better way to live and that endless sectarian violence is not a price one should be willing to pay in order to make sure women are not showing their hair, 
   we already make up one of the smallest percentages of our population in europe you clearly think so, 
   the international community was for the most part disinterested and help was minimal except for token aid packages for publicity . 
  why did the international community have to step in * again * at all ? 
  the french did n't have to step back in after us independence was won to curb some kind of totalitarian regime from arising in place of the british . 
  why are other countries consistently able to form democratic governance in the wake of oppression ? 
   if anything history has shown that functioning democracies were dependent not only on internal resolve but on outside powers ready to back them up yes a us-backed libyan government would totally have gone over well with the population it 's not like they would have seen it as another puppet state of the us . 
  everything would have settled in nicely . 
   it is quite telling of europe 's own foreign policy dysfunction that it did next to nothing to ensure libya 's stability at a point where libya was relatively stable , military intervention was not necessary but soft power would have been at its element to ensure stability . 
  what is quite telling is the patronizing lens you view these countries through . 
  the argument for colonialism was that these people can not rule themselves and europe is doing them a favour in propping up protectorates and ruling them as colonies . 
  this is exactly the view you have of libya i 'm afraid . 
  whatever government they have it has to come from within the country , not from outside, 
   estonia is only 69 % estonian this is not about race ? 
   i 'm not trying to absolve anyone . 
  i 'm pointing out , that when you bomb other countries it tends to generate refugees . 
  yeah japan was never bombed oh wait yes that 's right they were * nuked * ** twice ** . 
  why is japan a global economic driver today and somalia , which has never had a bomb drop on its soil , is full of clay huts and tribal warfare ? 
  and further why is the tribal warfare for some reason europe 's fault ? 
  do you really believe this warfare did not take place before europeans arrived ? 
  if the west is guilty of anything , it is guilty of letting too much of modern technology spill out into their world allowing them to take their barbarism to the scale it 's at right now . 
   most of the countries you listed were occupied for decades and/or recieved huge donations ( e.g. 
  marshall help ) to build infrastructure and incentivize democratic reform and free markets . 
  this is not even close to the issue [ afghanistan alone has cost more for the us than the whole of europe after ww2 ] ( http://foreignpolicy.com/2014/07/30/the-united-states-has-outspent-the-marshall-plan-to-rebuild-afghanistan/ ) the problem is these countries * actively resist those efforts *  moreover , key members of the bureacracy of the former totalitarian regimes were taken in to help rebuild the state . 
   in iraq and libya , the new state had to start from scratch . 
  no western force killed or affected the continued work of a single libyan official or beurocrat . 
  what took place was a no-fly zone and targeting of military equipment that the west had sold gadaffi in the first place * to even the playing field * . 
  the west had nothing to do with the libyan government that was to follow the revolt . 
  and in iraq , are you seriously telling me that the us has not had a prolonged occupation effort there ? 
  and that they have n't been closely working with the iraqi government and consulting ?
