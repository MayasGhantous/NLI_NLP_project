  what the fuck the iraqi president had * regular one on one conversations with the president of the united states * ** no other government official had that in the world **, 
  i never claimed that refugees * do * find work after 5-10 years , i only pointed out that this was not your objection to taking in refugees . 
  race was the argument you presented , and only race . 
  everyone is still building their wealth [ poland can definitely afford more than 357 per million inhabitants ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2014/dec/02/sweden-oecds-highest-per-capita-asylum-seekers-syria ), 
  ah yes the old race-culture switcharoo , a favourite among stormfronters and racists of all kinds . 
  because you are now part of the west and one of the downsides of being part of the west is you are expected to be ~ ~ the saviour of the world . ~ ~ moral human beings and a civilized society, 
   the vast majority of estonians are strongly against receiving refugees . 
  the issue is that they never leave , if there were some guarantees that they 'd all leave in 5-10 years , the feelings could be different . 
  so you are okay receiving people that are unable to contribute at all to society but as soon as they can start being productive you want them to leave . 
  so basically your opposition is 100 % racial and about wanting to keep the `` wrong genes '' away and 0 % economical about the costs involved nice , i thought the baltics had come further than this i guess they really ca n't into nordic, 
  you are absolving these countries ' populations of the responsibility of * creating their own safety and prosperity * , it is not our job to constantly stop them from devolving into mass murder . 
  in any normal country , if the authoritarian regime is suddenly collapsed , be it through a foreign power or otherwise , the population proceeds to establish a functioning democracy and prospers ** despite the supposed destabilizing effects of deposing whoever was in power ** examples : japan , south korea , chile , poland , germany , italy why is it that these particular countries are seen as helplessly thrown into a spiral of violence by the very same thing that creates stability and prosperity in all other countries ? 
  amazing how much more civilized the nazis seem to have been towards pows than modern day pow treatment ( looking at you usa ) i mean , aside from the whole holocaust thing . 
  so i 'm assuming you are british let 's say royalists and federalists start a bloody civil war in england . 
  the federalists are shelling the shit out of your town because they want the strategic position and/or think it 's a royalist stronghold and should be blown the fuck up would you want the netherlands to either a. accept your asylum application if you chose to seek asylum or b. reject it because `` those fucking brits have caused enough problems in the world with colonialism etc. 
  they can rot on their island '' ? 
  how is culture going to be factored in when deciding how many refugees a country can care for ? 
  islamic stone age medicine `` oh you seem to have a bacterial infection let me just attach these leeches to your eyelids '', 
  first of all we are talking ** refugees ** here not immigrants or non-nationals second of all why is ethnicity part of this question ? 
  the burden we are trying to redistribute in a more fair way is the burden of caring for refugees and processing asylum claims we are not discussing the best way to keep a eugenics program running `` on the sly '', 
  probably, 
  which hopefully is soon, 
  brits can do the on-camera talking cus that makes it sound more official, 
  more like [ arnor ] ( http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/arnor ) , finland is angmar, 
   russia 's sprawling propaganda network may have failed to persuade much of the world that ukraine is run by nazis , that crimea was annexed in a popular uprising ** and/or that germany is a failed state . 
  ** what ? 
  i always imagine a conversation between danes to be something like this ( translation to normal communication in parenthesis ) : \\  go'morrghghgn ( good morning ) \\ - hajj der ( shark there ) \\  fyfaen va go ' \u00d6l ( this is a tasty beverage * sips * ) \\ - men faen jens va seier du om alla disse bruna ? 
  ( so what do you think about current events ? ), 
  \\  nei de e f\u00d6 jaevlig ( let 's not get too political ) \\ - trevli helj ( you are right , have a good day ), 
  explanation ? 
  i know this , it 's a sad thing hope to see ukraine taking part again whenever possible, 
  speak in whatever way comes naturally to you do n't change the way you speak to fit an accent that only makes you sound like an idiot because it will be obvious to everyone else that you are putting it on, 
  historical importance and relevance e.g. 
  i think moldova is sending a ukrainian ? 
  i think he said balkan, 
  indian , clearly, 
  why do nordic people always try to put on this ridiculous brit accent to try to sound intelligent goddamn embarrassing, 
  well obviously there are no beggars in romania any more they are in some unsuspecting eu country picking pockets or pretending to be blind/deaf/mute and collecting money for a charity, 
  clearly fake - did n't see a single werewolf or vampire, 
  what are these people hoping to achieve by bombing the vatican ? 
  all that will happen is their children for another couple of generation will learn what a uav is before they learn to read, 
  [ ride the antidepressant high ] ( http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/health_glance-2013-en/04/10/g4-10-04.html?itemid=/content/chapter/health_glance-2013-41-en&amp;_csp_=2f6481becc176514dc3acbdcffc1daaa ), 
  you are giving reasons to why spanish people might have these misconceptions but i did n't ask for that so i ask again what does this have to do with my post, 
  he gives the correct answers in the link in my comment ... 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvimvzgtd6w first of all his question is about which country has higher child mortality rate which is not in any way comparable to the question `` did dinosaurs live in the last couple hundred thousand years '' or `` does the sun revolve around the earth '' second he puts the question to fresh , mostly 18-year-old , * students * whereas the poll in the op is on a statistically representative portion of the whole of the population , of which only a small minority have yet to embark on an education expected to inform them on the subject of the question ( i highly doubt americans go through world health statistics in high school ? ), 
  third he did n't compare them to americans, 
  yes well that says more about pisa results than anything else i think in terms of innovation sweden is consistently top 5 in the world http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/global_innovation_index, 
  what does this have to do with anything, 
  they do , but to have political support you need to first establish yourself as `` hard on immigrants '' in denmark, 
  you annexed part of one of the members and are currently still at war with it of course it is going to be anti russian, 
  ca n't imagine what the show host must have felt when he saw that vote result, 
   i think that my children and grandchildren are going to ask why more was n't done to help people running away from isis , or violence in eritrea or wherever , when we knew that people were dying in their thousands . 
  people will ask the same question they did after the war , ` if you were aware , why did n't you do something ? 
  yup and everyone is going to blame someone else the whole problem is no one is taking responsibility , everyone can blame `` the eu '' while for some reason holding themselves apart from that group . 
  every country will have something similar to `` the eu is n't doing enough of this and that '' in their headlines about this at the outbreak of the civil war this is exactly the stalemate sweden tried to break by announcing automatic permanent residence for syrians , thinking everyone just wanted someone else to take the first step and the problem would be easy to handle for the combined resources of the eu ( which it would ) instead everyone is just sitting there watching people die , just like they will in the mediterranean, 
  i do n't follow  polling company asked these specific questions in sweden ( dinosaurs and sun )  collectively answer that immigration is a good thing for swedish society . 
  these things are not related are you trying to say swedish people relate every question to how good immigration is ? 
  cus that 's pretty far fetched and i do n't think a lot of people would agree with you p.s. 
  immigration is a good thing asylum acceptance is not necessarily a good thing in the short term however as it is expensive , but it is a moral obligation that we are happy to answer to p.p.s. 
  our economy is doing better than eu average so ... 
   thirty percent of spaniards think that humans once lived alongside the dinosaurs what the fuck did part of europe get annexed by alabama ? 
   the figures may be horrifying , but they are nevertheless an improvement : in 2006 , the proportions were almost 50 ( dinosaurs ) and 40 ( sun ) percent , respectively . 
  at the risk of starting a flame war i wonder why the economy went to shit ... 
  not trolling here but went to copenhagen , first thing i see at central station is a bigfuck poster saying `` immigrants must work '' also , a common comment i got in switzerland was `` but you are the good kind of foreigner '' makes me question if such societies can be said to be happy, 
  0.8 more `` happiness '' ca n't be very much if the most happy country is almost 10x that * increment * , it 's like the difference between a dollar and 90 cents , literally less than the gender wage gap i mean , having been to the confoederatio helvetica , they 're not exactly dancing in the streets, 
  i want you to save this comment and in a few years , maybe 5 years when you are 18 years old , come back and look at it and feel shame, 
  tbh the difference between the top like 25 countries ca n't really be that big, 
  [ all current wars ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_ongoing_armed_conflicts ) , explain how the african ones are europe 's fault or responsibility - somalia : militant islamists trying to seize power , at most ( in terms of western involvement ) us and un have assisted african union and somali government - darfur : ethnic tension - libya : the only thing europe is responsible for here is overthrowing a dictator , the current civil war is not our fault - central african republic : someone attempts to seize power , rebel groups form . 
  no links to eu or us interests - sudan : ethnic tension which wars exactly were brought in by europe ? 
  orthodox faith , homophobia , absolutist rule , militarism things russia has that europe left behind, 
  http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/rick-perry-familys-hunting-camp-still-known-to-many-by-old-racially-charged-name/2011/10/01/giqaohy5dl_story.html place was named hundreds of years ago , are we gon na change it 's name just cus slavery ended ? 
  ** yes **, 
  designating a particular region within a city to be the `` jewish region '' has pretty bad [ historical precedence ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warsaw_ghetto ) . 
   he told french radio that the latest was a planned attack on churches in the paris suburb of villejuif . 
   villejuif jew village ? 
  wtf france ? 
  probably by accident rather than design though, 
  he 's so fucking small though holy shit, 
  intelligent terrorist is pretty much an oxymoron, 
  this is some four lions shit, 
   muslims complain that questioning the holocaust is forbidden by law but insulting the prophet muhammad is not . 
  is this really a common complaint from muslims ? 
  cus that would be horrible i realize they complain that people can insult their cult leader but do they really think it is somehow comparable to denying the holocaust ? 
  why are they standing so far apart, 
  maybe he 's just black ^ i 'm ^ ^ so ^ so ^ sorry, 
   whoever misses the ussr has no heart ; whoever wants the ussr back has no brain , iirc . 
  i think the quote is supposed to be whoever * does not * miss the soviet union has no heart . 
  whoever wants it back has no brain . 
  referring to the fact communism comes from good intentions but has horrific consequences, 
   the united states is scheduled to take in its largest group of syrian refugees to date -- up to 2,000 by the fall of this year , compared with a total of about 700 since the civil war in syria began four years ago , according to the state department . 
  disgraceful sweden 's taken in [ 3475 ] ( http://www.migrationsverket.se/download/18.7c00d8e6143101d166d1aab/1427871967778/inkomna+ans%c3%b6kningar+om+asyl+2015+-+applications+for+asylum+received+2015.pdf ) from syria alone this year as of fourth of april and we 're smaller than some of their states why does the us think it 's ok to keep in place their cherry picking policy ( i.e. 
  only let in the engineers etc. ), 
  when they are the fucking cause of this crisis take some fucking responsibility , if they wanted they could feed clothe and house the entire refugee population from syria with the cost of one of their bombing runs, 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_%28ppp%29_per_capita they are below sweden according to imf world bank and cia where are you getting your magic numbers from ? 
  danes and finns keep going like `` lol sweden yes '' `` them immigrants gon na ruin your econimay '' `` muh hdi '' `` enjoy being a 3rd world country '' all the fucking time bitch please you cruising at 0 % growth and trying to telling us what to do ? 
  implying the space race was n't more or less a military effort anyway - show the other side how far you can launch your a-bombs , you can call that regular science if you want but i include it in military spending, 
  the gap between north and south korea is far far far wider than the gap was between east and west germany i do n't think unification will be good for south korea, 
  yes but to say that they would have * definitely * been better off if they did n't spend as much on military or that every dollar spent on military could do more to stimulate growth if put to research is just not the case military r&d is often more fruitful and puts out usable tech more reliably than fundamental science research or other types of research, 
  they start off better off than spain france italy uk in 2014 , and by 2020 they will still be better off than spain france italy uk not sure what you are trying to say, 
  [ citation needed ] fact : the largest , by far , world-wide spender on military is also , by far , the dominant world economic and technological driver and engine coincidence ?
