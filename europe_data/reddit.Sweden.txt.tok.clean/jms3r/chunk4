  you literally did exactly that when you say `` just lock 'em up '' . 
  you mean you interpreted what i said to mean something completely different, 
  you 're a moron , a 30yo virgin does n't have to rape to have sex , there 's absolutely no reason to think a late virgin will rape more often than others . 
  pedophiles are different , they can choose between child pornography and rape , both of which will damage the child, 
  yeah , no , that is n't even a remotely reasonable extrapolation , please try again . 
  first of all it 's not like murder where something happend once and now we only have evidence to go on to see if it can be proved . 
  a pedophile is a pedophile for the duration of his/her lifetime and they can be tested second of all i never said anything about preemptive punishment but you seem to be too busy making straw man arguments to notice . 
  and finally how can you even argue that just because we punish one type of crime there is an overbearing risk that we generalize that punishment to every law breaker ? 
  that would just as well apply to already existing punishments for murder for example , by your reasoning , we have no reason not to - , or are at risk to apply the punishment for murder to pickpockets ? 
  what the fuck ? 
  nowhere does it say muslim or islam, 
  i think if you sexually engage with a 12-year-old , you 're a pedo, 
  you do n't necessarily have to be a muslim just because your name is mohammed, 
  the rest of the world is burning , and we 're just sitting here * euphoria * - ing, 
  how do you know it was a muslim ? 
  despite normally being all for a progressive attitude to crime and rehabilitation , i ca n't help but agree ... pedophilia ca n't be `` cured '' any more than homosexuality can , this becomes a huge problem since pedophilia is inherently immoral ( one side necessarily can not consent ) . 
  a person can not live an entire life ignoring his/her sexuality , and a single slip-up is all it takes to permanently damage some innocent kid . 
  just lock 'em up . . 
  eurovision qualifiers is serious business, 
  it 's from 2007 , the numbers do n't mean anything anymore :p, 
  nice spoiler , 
   it 's easy to look at it from the perspective of sweden , where english has been holding the monopoly on foreign cultural influence for more than 50 years , you know nothing jon snow, 
  i 'm still amazed that they do n't already speak english elsewhere in the eu, 
  thanks obama, 
  better not fuck with the swedes or we 'll homicide your ass, 
  did n't greece pull out because they could n't afford the cost ? 
  btw , how much does it cost to participate ? 
  totally didnt exploit the post war situation for financial gain, 
  chuu chuu no fascists on this party train motherfuckers, 
  as a `` stockholmian '' i disagree about northerners , i think they 've a more no-nonsense approach to things and are introverted , but not necessarily `` slow '' . 
  to a certain extent i also see them as more likely to be axe-murdering psychopaths ( like that movie where johnny depp is a writer and is going insane ) and i 'd like to add racist southerners, 
  i 'm saying nuclear power is a heavy responsibility and states that suffer from corruption and inefficient management should not be allowed to risk the wellbeing of the rest of us, 
  are you saying france has had a core meltdown that i missed ? 
  please provide a link, 
  they did n't enter the reactor site though because they could n't find it on the map the action was a massive fiasco and everyone laughed at them for not being able to read a map if you think `` thelocal '' gives you an accurate or remotely comprehensive picture of what actually goes on in sweden you are terribly mistaken . 
  it 's an online publication which means they rely on internet clicks which means they sensationalize and do their best to attract whatever attention they can get, 
  [ i 've a horse outside ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljpfzrrd3j8 ), 
  clearly it has n't happend yet , but the fact that the threat has emerged despite the potential danger is evidence of poor management when compared to the scale of operation in other countries like france ( which has n't had a single incident despite having the most nuclear power potential in the world ), 
  first of all i think you meant to say i ** live ** in a responsible country second of all i was not talking about the original chernobyl incident since that was due to the power structures of the ussr which does n't exist any longer . 
  i was talking about the current state of mismanagement of the chernobyl plant that would allow this new situation to emerge and endanger the containment of the unit 4 reactor . 
  y so mad bro ? 
  i did n't take offen ** s ** e , i 'm just amused by your flailing attempts at logic, 
  the fuck ? 
  70,000 horses ? 
  that 's a lot of lasagna, 
  so first you bring up a train wreck from 1918 ( that 's a century ago fyi ) and then you compare the scale of a train wreck to that of a nuclear reactor meltdown yup , clearly your argument is completely impenetrable, 
  except a derailed train does n't spew out poisonous radioactive clouds that settle into the environment for decades causing birth defects and cancer across the entire continent , dick . 
  freak natural disaster is not the same as a nuclear reactor just spontaneously collapsing, 
  pretty sure they ended up in findus beef products, 
  seriously some countries should not be allowed nuclear power , force them to buy their power from responsible nations < . <, 
  ignores population movement though, 
  there 's an important difference though ... anyone can use punctuation when appropriate , however , someone who thinks it makes sense to say `` i speak english good '' is going to think that regardless of whether they are talking to a potential employer or some dude on the internet my intention was to be helpful , not irritating, 
  - for taxi american lettuce into the good order , ample stool will pronounce . 
  was that more or less understandable because i used capital letter and punctuation ? 
  no need to thank me , someone has to do the job and i 'm just the right guy at the right place, 
  just because you are being less formal does n't mean you are free to misuse words, 
  wanting people to word correctly is not the same as expecting people to capitalize and punctuate online, 
  nope , this is how you type on the internet, 
  if you are unfamiliar with standard informal internet typing i would be glad to inform you that all you are accomplishing here is making yourself seem extremely pretentious, 
   this forces everyone to learn english if they want to get ** their ** entertainment . 
  ftfy this is your second offense in a short time , a third strike will get you in language-nazi jail, 
  using abbreviations is not wrong and does n't need fixing would you also correct someone for using ps , sos , or sob ? 
   most speak it really ** well . 
  ** ftfy, 
  i for one fully support our new pants-shitting neighbors, 
  literally the exact same expression i made when i read that hoooly shit, 
  do n't come here with your numbers and sensible arguments, 
  relevant to what ? 
  there 's been no new development and nothing new has been presented as far as i can see so why is this news, 
  there 's no new information here though, 
  if i release a report on the holocaust does that make it recent news ? 
  why are they writing an article about something that has already been uncovered years ago ? 
  quality russia today, 
  i put `` racist shit , always downvote '' , i 'm up to -281 downvotes on him, 
  afaik it 's partitioned into `` general pension '' guaranteed from the government , one part based on income one part not `` service pension '' , provided by employers , different service pension from different employers so there might be a ton of these `` private pension '' optional , let professionals from a bank or company try to grow your money on the stock market or otherwise ( essentially through investments at a risk-level that you dictate ) i feel like the private pension part is the one that is unique to sweden ( or at least pioneered in sweden ) and the part that imf people would want other countries to adopt as it lifts a lot of pressure on the government and frees up a lot for investments which greases the wheels of the economy, 
  [ this is a hospital in sweden , it 's the most depressing building i 've ever seen , like a storage facility for people to die in ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pl5l5qz.jpg ), 
  expected `` sweden yes '' , saw `` sweden yes '' , left feeling smug as fuck, 
  yup that happened , and the result was a bump up in the polls for their party shit 's fucked up, 
  inb4 that one finnish retard comes in with something relating to immigrants followed with `` sweden yes '' like he always does, 
  uk , snobbish and hung up on their royal blood and never gets along ( it 's a joke ), 
  die in a fire, 
  question , do you just spend your time writing `` sweden yes '' on every reddit thread ? 
  what is the point of your life ? 
  completely unjustified and overly simplified assumption, 
  there is no reason to think the new steady state will be equal to what it was before antibiotics were used or what it is in countries where it was never used, 
   less forested on higher latitudes [ mfw do n't know about the largest forest in the world ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/taiga ), 
  that does n't mean it will go away it just means not every cell in the population strictly * has * to have it to survive, 
  we are literally cumming danes and germans all over europe 's arse ( spain + portugal is the head , italy the boots & legs and france is the bent derriere ), 
  nor the norwegians, 
  [ sweden 's farmland does n't have less sun than continental europe though so your argument is invalid ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sk0l92j.png ), 
  nope , they can still retain the silent plasmid and also transfect other strains bro , do you even microbiology ? 
  the bacterial strains already exist dude , the damage is already done and anyways the antibiotics thing was n't even the point of my post , which you may pick up on by the fact that it was mentioned in brackets, 
  right but on the condition that they uphold humane standards for the animals and do n't ruin the land, 
  http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/grants/index_en.htm  direct payments support farmers ' incomes without being linked to production in return for them respecting standards of environmental protection , animal welfare , food safety and keeping the land in good condition, 
  first rule of food shopping : the cheaper product has been treated like shit observation : products from the continent are * always * cheaper ( despite transport distance ) conclusion : animals on the continent live miserable lives ( also they are jam packed with antibiotics which is partly why prevalence of antibiotic resistant bacteria is so fucking high on the continent ), 
  so basically it 's a tribute so that they treat the animals humanely ( which they still do n't do ) seems totally fair , i wish swedish farmers started threatening to abuse their animals so we could get some of that sweetness too, 
  what natural resources do those countries have to preserve and why is it the eus job to pay for it ? 
  thinking of spain france germany italy . . 
  would be interesting to see the actual numbers ( in euro ) as well since i 'm pretty sure the seemingly tiny negative contribution of spain translates to a whole lot more in actual money than hun or ltu for example and the seemingly small positive contribution of germany translates to a huge amount too compared to for example finland or sweden, 
   as seen on 9gag * shudder *,
