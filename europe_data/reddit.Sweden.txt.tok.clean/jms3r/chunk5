  i 'm pretty sure every country demanded guarantees ... and besides it 's not like sweden would have made a crucial difference in the bailout , i saw our participation more as a show of good faith and it 's not worth losing that much money over simple gestures, 
  it 's spelled bl\u00f8ff dude, 
  you are acting as if all muslims have a membership card and if you do n't have the membership card then the sharia patrol will just let you on your merry way the sharia police decide who is muslim and who is n't in these regions , which means if you are n't muslim you have to stay away from sharia ruled areas of those countries if you do n't want to have to obey sharia, 
  lol who 's being disingenuous now ? 
  `` almost '' does n't mean `` it could be between 1/40 or 1/4 '' it means `` pretty much 1/4 '' , since the poll result comes out in a percentage and they are trying to clarify what the number means by giving a fraction, 
  these are copy pasted from the article - forty-five percent say 9/11 was a conspiracy by the american and israeli governments . 
  this figure is more than twice as high as those who say it was not a conspiracy - one in four british muslims believe that last year 's 7/7 attacks on london were justified - twenty-eight percent hope for the u.k. one day to become a fundamentalist islamic state - this comports with last year 's daily telegraph newspaper survey that found one-third of british muslims believe that western society is decadent and immoral and that ** muslims should seek to end it . 
  ** emphasis added - seventy-eight percent support punishment for the people who earlier this year published cartoons featuring the prophet mohammed - sixty-eight percent support the arrest and prosecution of those british people who `` insult islam . '', 
  - the nop research survey reports , `` hardcore islamists '' constitute nine percent of the british muslim population . 
  a slightly more moderate group is composed of `` staunch defenders of islam . '', 
  this second group comprises 29 percent of the british muslim population . 
  ** individuals in this group aggressively defend their religion ** emphasis added that 's an easy 38 % who would take to violence to defend islam , that is hardly a `` tiny minority '', 
  i 'm not skewing the subject , the statement `` sharia only applies to those who want sharia '' is just a non sequitur, 
  that 's the point though , who says those two lesbians have to follow sharia ? 
  if they want sharia and they want it to apply to everyone , surely they wanted their marriage annulled ? 
  what i 'm saying is that in reality you ca n't just `` opt out '' of sharia in those countries , like you were suggesting ; sharia is enforced by muslims even on those who clearly do n't want to live a life under sharia ( this is just the nature of a code of law ; whoever follows the code obviously wants it , but those who do n't follow it obviously do n't want it ... ) edit for clarity, 
  and who decides what a muslim is ? 
  maybe those kids genuinely thought they were correcting believers who had fallen astray ? 
   he 's an authority over muslims no he 's not , you clearly have no idea how islam works  and happens to represent the views of a vast majority of muslims - [ 1/4 of uk muslims supported the 7/7 terror attack ] ( http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/08/14/opinion/main1893879.shtml&amp;date=2011-04-06 ) edit for misreading, 
  oh yes they clearly * wanted * the sharia police to come and annul their marriage , how silly of me . 
  so if something has been said on flashback it can never be uttered again ? 
  that 's a problem for people like me who do n't visit flashback , are we just supposed to live in constant fear that we might step on a flashback landmine whenever we talk ? 
  i 've never said that other muslims are doing it wrong , but you are just too busy constructing those strawmen in order to beat the shit out of them to the max to notice i guess . 
  the matter of whether non muslims are allowed to drink alcohol has nothing to do with sharia or the discussion at hand muslims prefer to live under sharia and that 's why muslim countries have sharia , why people on reddit are opposing this i do n't understand because it seems self-evidently true, 
  i 'm not , and neither are you but an imam is not an authority over other imams simply because he says things that * you * like, 
  i 've not said anything racist , it 's not an accident that muslim countries have sharia - it 's because muslims * want * sharia also islam is not a race dude , muslims are racially diverse so how can it be racist to talk about muslims, 
  [ indonesia ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-14667232 ) malaysia inherited the british legal system ( the common law ) and have implemented sharia limited it to muslims , yes , but sharia still applies to apostates , so the degree to which that is limited to muslims is kind of questionable to say the least, 
  i do n't know what this is supposed to prove but the fact is if you steal something in saudi arabia , sharia punishment is what is codified in law whether you are muslim or not, 
  the iran protests were not against the theocracy , they were against the sitting government i do n't know why you take it as such a strange thing that muslims want muslim traditions to prevail in countries that are culturally and historically islamic anyways . 
  of course muslims want sharia ; from their point of view sharia is justice and perfect . 
  similarly , christians in america want to ban abortion because from their point of view abortion is a sin , they do n't care that it means other people having to obey their made up rules about there being `` souls '' and `` life starts at conception '' and all that - they just want a just and moral society as per their own definition of justice and morality, 
   and this guy has his views literally backed up in scripture . 
  this just shows complete non-understanding of the situation with islamist fundamentalists ( they are called fundamentalists for a reason ), 
   the vast majority of muslims do not go out in gangs and try to enforce their own version of sharia on people countries with majority muslim populations * do * enforce or want to enforce sharia ( see egypt , iran , saudi arabia , etc. ), 
   the guy in the video gave a theological explanation , with citations , about why this behavior is wrong . 
  yes and there are plenty of other imams who give theological explanations , with citations , about why it is right to die a martyr death to bring down israel or fight the west  if fundamentalist christians went around trying to enforce their views on everybody , nobody would assert that the fault lies in christianity historically , yes they would , you obviously have no understanding of most of european history and currently , i blame anti abortion and anti stem cell sentiment entirely on bullshit superstitions with roots in primitive christian `` thinking ''  when orthodox jews in israel started doing the same thing , nobody blamed judaism you live a very sheltered life if you do n't think there 's any animosity towards judaism in the world, 
  yes but my point is that the `` violent minority '' also have imams who support their point of view there 's no pope or vatican-like institution in islam , this guy is not of higher authority than other imams who demand the destruction of israel , so why should we decide that this guy represents the `` real '' islam rather than the other guys ? 
  not that i do n't encourage this kind of sentiment from religious leaders , but why is this minority more representative of `` actual islamic theology '' than the other minority , the `` violent minority '' , which so far has definitely been a larger minority than this one, 
  of course there was n't a great german masterplan to benefit its export industry , i 'm just saying that germany today is benefitting very much from this factor, 
  pro : quarantine the biggest outbreak of gingers in the known world con : prices of tea may increase slightly, 
  the reason germany does well is because the failed euro states ( aka southern europe ) are keeping the euro down so germany can export the products of its industry at low cost, 
  too bad it took for germany to twist their arm like a motherfucker just to implement responsible fiscal policy and even then there were massive riots and nazism ... < . <, 
  two corrections 1 . 
  poverty , you mean `` made up child poverty '' ? 
  basically children 's organizations like * save the children * and others have inflated/made up numbers on how many children in poverty there are in sweden ( in order to justify people donating to them ) 2 . 
  tv * licence * is what you were looking for , they are trying to expand it to include computers and tablets, 
  this is just product endorsement though ( in case you missed the absolut vodka bottle at the end ), 
  woah federal eu seems like a massive leap , my country does n't even have the currency yet : o to be honest i 'm highly uncomfortable with the idea of people like berlusconi impacting legislation that would be forced onto the whole of europe also in order to enforce a federal government there would have to be a federal military which is another massive step to take, 
  second kalmar union and no france ? 
  seems fine to me  also lol how can that tiny piece of hungary be considered an empire, 
  yes because you clearly have a highly developed sense of the `` real world '', 
  christ do people look awkward before their facial bone structure settles : /, 
  why are ( some ) finnish people so racist i do n't understand it we get finns over in / r/sweden lamenting how we are throwing away our race and identity to muslims and all sorts really , what the fuck is with finns , do you even have immigrants ? 
  how can you speak about something you have no experience of, 
  nordic countries have been top of that list for a long time it 's only natural that other nations catch up at some point , but one thing is for certain there is no evidence that conditions are getting worse, 
  save sweden from what ? 
  it 's one of the most stable and safe countries in the world : o, 
  oh really ? 
  i did n't know . 
  what they also have is zero business caring about the immigration policies of sweden, 
  let economists and professional politicians worry about the financial costs to society , they have n't fucked up yet so i think they know how to balance a budget . 
  i assure you , the costs are not so great as to validate sending asylum seekers back to hell-holes like the drc , especially considering one of them is a young girl . 
  and besides , sweden is one of the few countries in europe * not * in financial doo-doo at the moment , are you really suggesting that it 's worth sending this girl back to horrible conditions just to squeeze out a little bit more growth ? 
   how influential were her parents in other aspects of society , for instance ? 
  not influential at all , asylum seekers from the dcr are very few in sweden and even among them very few hold viewpoints like these two and even fewer are open enough about it to form any kind of subculture that could influence anyone  are these the kinds of people you want outing opinions in your society ? 
  no , which is why it 's lucky that they do n't and if they did nobody would listen, 
  yes they do, 
  the `` crime rise '' has never been attributed to asylum seekers better data gathering and wider definitions of violent crime especially rape show more * reported crime * that is not the same thing as more crime , besides most organized crime is either domestic or from the eu , not asylum seekers, 
  yeah fuck data gathering and statistical analysis , just go out in the street and form your own opinion based on what you happen to see, 
  no of course not , it was meant in response to the comment about sweden being `` culturally enriched '' and as linleigh pointed out the fact that this happens at all in the world is very sad but this family moving to sweden can only have had positive effects for the child, 
  [ citation needed ], 
  sweden is the 4th best place in the world to be born , the prospects of swedes are pretty good, 
  check his history , nothing but racism and -430 comment karma, 
  that is 24 degrees warmer than here ... 
  sshh your reasoned logic is getting in the way of the hate culture of / r/europe, 
  mind your own shit dude our country is doing fine swedes have taken literally zero damage from this , so what exactly are you suggesting we are `` doing to ourselves '' ? 
  the miniscule financial cost of supporting her through school and stuff without parents ( i expect they will lose custody and/or be locked up ) is well worth the life she can have here compared to the prospects of a young girl in the drc, 
  surprisingly close correlation actually lol, 
  i 'm actually currently an exchange student in switzerland , french part though , and there are clearly similarities but i just had the impression that the swiss tend to identify as either french-swiss or german-swiss ( and a few `` swiss-swiss '' ) . 
  til the swiss consider themselves to be nordic ( or conversely they consider the nordics to be swiss-like ) is there a way to make one of these from a swede 's perspective ? 
  well just look at the top rated comment in this thread by an english person  probably worth it just to piss the us off then . 
  i have a hard time imagining that they ( the us ) did n't know that this would be how the british public would react to a public statement like this which is why i think the statement was done either out of incompetence or to try to impact the results negatively, 
  time for the tinfoil hats : us made this statement right before the referendum in order to rally more voters to the anti eu side ( reverse psychology and all that ) because they do n't want competition from a strong and unified eu, 
  from a swede 's perspective : england : good comedy , cares a lot about the royal family , society is heavily divided in classes , oxford/cambridge tradition wales : sheep and lovely accent scotland : whiskey and lovely accent , kilts ( republic of ireland ) irish : drink and fight but in a very loveable way nice pub culture/atmosphere ( also for scotland/england ) france : pompous and self-important , generates good art , used to be progressive and lovely but seems to have devolved into conservativism and racism spain : party late into the night , very hedonistic , for some reason very prideful despite seemingly having very little to be proud of italy : in many ways the opposite of germany , very social , value visual design/appearance over engineering/functionality , favors chaos over order talk very loudly ( also true for france and spain ) the netherlands : individualists and liberals switzerland : bankers and tax evaders germany : industrious and hard working , like to do things according to preset rules austria : similar to germany but for some reason a breeding ground for psychopaths ( adolf hitler , josef fritzl ) poland : hard workers but less industry, 
  that dude is clearly french , france does n't have a queen, 
  also julkalendern ( advent calendar ), 
  i would totally form a state with you guys you talk funny , have plenty of cash , and the best looking country/nature/mountains in the world also we 'd destroy the winter olympics, 
  hans `` breaking-my-balls '' blix, 
  no joke , i constantly see horrible english use from swedes on this subreddit not to mention / r/sweden it is almost unbearable when they are trying to use fancy words on top of their broken grammar ; it just seems pretentious and silly . 
  this is especially true when the post itself mentions how comfortable swedes * supposedly * are with english and how `` you basically do n't need to know swedish because we all speak fluently '' no we fucking do n't motherfucker, 
  there is not enough data on population iq to make this study ; they have necessarily made shit up to come up with these numbers . 
  for example , i know for a fact that this data does not exist for sweden , the best they could do is to try to generalize some small sample size like mensa applications or whatever but shit is not enough to say anything about the population for one thing and for another there are n't even standard deviations or confidence intervals in this map . 
  i have a strong feeling that pretty much the entire map would be within the same interval unless they can get like a bazillion sigma confidence somehow and even then the differences would be much smaller than on this map, 
  no problem mr.\u00c5kesson, 
   the man is not named and the restaurant has no name , either . 
  yeah geez i wonder fucking why ? 
  no retard this was meant to be a debate within the muslim student societies using the university as a venue , it has nothing to do with what is being taught at the university, 
  mothafukka say what ? 
  apparently i 'm slightly over average in congo feelsgoodman.jpg, 
  naw man , nationalism is not synonymous with racism / \u00fcbermensch ideals but if one * is * a nationalist then one should definitively , at the very least , have the balls to carry that label without beginning to squirm and deflect when others refer to the thing by its real name ...
