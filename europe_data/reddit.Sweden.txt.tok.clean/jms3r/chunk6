  on the cheek *, 
  really ? 
  i found a decent number but anyway you ca n't ask too much i guess, 
  am i right in thinking there is no real cause for this desire to be independent other than nationalism and/or little brother complex ? 
  except no books were actually removed ... 
  dunno why a german 's opinion would matter more than anyone else 's , this video is just fucked up, 
  fuck do you know how hard it is to get this out of my head ? 
  that year 's melodifestival ;-{, 
  what the fuck is this shit, 
  demographics determines if the economy will be focused on instant gratification or long term growth - portugal still has a pyramid shape demographic ( more young than old ) which means they wo n't have long term growth goals population size determines the overall size of the economy which effectively means `` how independent of neighboring countries is the nation '' , portugal having a somewhat low population means they are somewhat dependent on their neighbors and their only neighbor is spain ( which is just fucking around on eu welfare rather than building a decent economy ), 
  ( a lot of the eastern block is right next to germany ), 
  not eu, 
  i could , actually , but i do n't think the economic troubles of portugal are nearly as inexcusable as the economic troubles of spain . 
  by rights ( based on population size , land mass , demographics etc. ), 
  spain * should * be one of the dominant economic engines of europe . 
  the fact that it is n't is a failure in and of itself , the fact that it 's * below * average is a disgrace portugal on the other hand can only easily trade with spain and so the failings of spain spill over onto portugal . 
  this is why i think the population size and geographic location of portugal makes its struggling economy not at all unexpected, 
  well at least northern italy is pulling their weight also portugal is excusable because it 's such a small country with only spain as a neighbor so they 're very dependent on spain spain imo has no excuse it has similar population to france and britain and the forth largest landmass and is neighbor with france which is very industrial and whose infrastructure opens trade with most of europe, 
  * but i am le tired * sorry had to be done, 
  it 's funny how there 's still such a clear divide between western and eastern europe ... except for spain ... what the fuck spain get your shit together,

  polen can not into russia, 
  goddamn those are some unfortunate looking girls and boys, 
  why does usa exist as a country ? 
  they have fought a bloody civil war and the south is still extremely racist and the country 's legislative branch is famously deadlocked even on very simple issues where there should already be a strong consensus opinion but sabotage and parliamentary tactics prevent them from going through because of a strict red-blue divide would canada , russia , mexico and cuba want to absorb their neighbors ? 
  \\  promotar arga blatten internationellt u srs bruh ? 
  let 's be honest here whatever contribution sweden could make would be too small to matter and would only be symbolic edit : nvm holy shit i did n't realize ukraine gdp was that low, 
  the real mistake was not accepting russia 's peace proposal after poland-lithuania peaced out of the war greed always gets ya, 
  because they are getting more than that amount, 
  wait what ? 
  this seems fucked up do you get your right to vote back if you move back ? 
  [ fr\u00f6ken cecilia lind ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjgdrkmtya0 ) [ byssan lull ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpaozeyf8m4 ), 
  it 's not a statistic , it 's an example ( as i wrote ), 
  really ? 
  because it seems like out of the countries that are struggling the euro is the common factor for example , there is only one nordic country that is struggling economically , and it just so happens to be the one that has the euro ( finland ) . 
  i 'm going to say conversation sweden has yet to develop conversation technology, 
  [ hello ] ( http://news.images.itv.com/image/file/222093/image_update_5016499e8fab5fe9_1371797682_9j-4aaqsk.jpeg ), 
  it 's different though because there is n't a third party with overwhelming military might forcing the issue, 
  if he 's fluent in four languages my question is why did n't he go to a country in which one of his languages is spoken ? 
  i mean it 's not like he `` accidentally '' ended up in sweden in the chaos of fleeing war , if you are in sweden then you * very * purposefully went to sweden as a specific target . 
  why did n't he go to a country where he can speak the language ? 
   i ca n't believe this post is only 67 % upvoted https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1cor1h/eli5_reddits_automatic_downvote_system/ the number of upvotes over downvotes ( absolute number ) is conserved , but not the ratio of downvotes to upvotes, 
  they seem to count running at * all distances * , disc throwing , javelin throw , decathlon , high jump , long jump , pole vault , triathlon and [ many others ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/athletics_at_the_summer_olympics#events ) in that one category so yeah , pretty much everyone who does n't suck at athletics is going to have athletics as their `` sport '', 
  in what way, 
  they started out like sweden , with a social democratic welfare state that takes care of refugees . 
  the growth of the bump is due to the same reasons sweden was getting 'em - they were becoming known for having generous asylum care . 
  they became anti immigration as soon as the immigrants started coming though so it dies out pretty fast, 
  i wish rugby was more popular in sweden instead of faggotball oh , i mean football . 
  about the sami , they like to claim to be `` indigenous '' to the region but here are some facts : their [ genes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/population_genetics_of_the_sami ) indicate they have since the beginning been intermixing with europeans ( meaning `` swedes '' were there when they arrived ) . 
  they arrived at the earliest when the glacial ice sheet retreated - at this time southern sweden was already populated and there have been remains found of their colonies up north in what the sami claim to be `` their region '' note i 'm not saying they are n't indigenous , i 'm saying they are n't * more * indigenous than the rest of us, 
   national partisans ** within ** your country the finish volunteers i do n't think most people have an opinion on at all, 
  sweden : the warfare period : ** economic development ** end of the war : ** bandwagon the winning side , pretend we supported them all along ** the role of your country in the war : ** material supplier ** country-men who fought within the wehrmacht or waffen-ss : ** nazis ** national partisans within your country : ** there were none **, 
  they 're like asians , but from europe ( do n't ban me ), 
  imagine the online `` sweden yes '' and `` captain sweden '' shitstorm/circlejerk if/when this happens on our side of the strait lol, 
  because everything to do with `` goodness '' or `` good things '' and generally things that feminists like is automatically feminism nowadays like anti-racism , that 's feminism now apparently . 
  hbtq rights is feminism too for some reason . 
  because what attracted them to feminism in the first place is taking the moral high ground , and that 's what they love to do . 
  weeelll it can be that , rape is commonly used as a weapon of war in the drc conflict for instance but it can also be a sexual urges thing, 
  early expand to crimea then defense it only now they 're sending zergling rush on a terran stim ball, 
  according to herself that is exactly what happened [ this is the earliest source i could find where she says as much ] ( http://www.svt.se/nyheter/regionalt/vast/hotades-efter-att-ha-konverterat ) ( in swedish obviously ), 
  consider that this is * every * refugee under unhcr mandate * in the world * , the actual number of refugees entering europe is much less . 
  even if you consider 2 % to be steep ( sweden already has more than that and is doing fine economically ) remember it is the most extreme case and it is still manageable . 
  by this logic pension systems are futile . 
  100 % of the population are potential pensioners and obviously we ca n't afford to have everyone be a pensioner so let 's not have a pension system, 
  http://www.unhcr.org.uk/about-us/key-facts-and-figures.html there are 14,4 million unhcr refugees . 
  there are 59,5 million displaced wordwide , less than 2 % of your imagined refugee number, 
  she 's pushing for refugee quotas which would pretty much solve the problem practically although it would be unpopular politically due to public opinions about refugees at the moment 14,4 million refugees ( total number of refugees currently under unhcr mandate ) is a huge burden for germany , population 80 million 14,4 million refugees is trivial for europe , population 740 million, 
  i think she meant * germany * ca n't take in all the refugees - * europe * , however , can . 
  yes, 
  having seen the actual segment on aktuellt , none of the egg throwing or how affected the journalist/camera man were was mentioned , only that `` after a while we decided to leave '', 
  basically she 's public about criticizing islam and being an ex-muslim and all that stuff i feel like a lot of muslim `` men '' are extra angry because she 's a woman and is n't sitting in a corner in black draperies trying to meld into the furniture my problem with her is she 's aligned with american evangelical christianity . 
  she 's been on [ cbn ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christian_broadcasting_network ) with [ pat robertson ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/pat-robertson-gay-rights/ ), 
  yeah , do you even know [ what a straight line looks like ? 
  ] ( http://www.visitnorway.com/imagevaultfiles/id_20367/cf_13/the-atlantic-road-national-tourist-route-norway_74.jpg ) hint : nothing like that road . 
  what does the upside-down sign say ? 
  what about [ mrsa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/methicillin-resistant_staphylococcus_aureus ) ? 
  https://sd.se/var-politik/ they have no foreign policy section on their website they have something called `` culture politics '' though which has several interesting bullet points such as `` create cultural canon '' i guess their foreign policy consists of - no to euro - eu membership referendum - renegotiate schengen - no refugees or immigrants - more money on the military ( more money on everything really , while lowering taxes ), 
  everyone knows finland is the balls , sweden is the dick, 
  or you are investing your research money smarter than everyone else e.g. 
  less `` flashy '' facilities etc. 
  i know in sweden for example our new `` medical research hub '' hospital area is n't even done and we spent 1,5 billion euros building it and the construction contracts are worth a total of 5,5 billion euro which is just crazy insane, 
  usually when they sing la marseillaise at football games and stuff i like to * hon * along * honhon hon hoon-hoon hon hon hooon hon-hon , hon-hon ho-honhon hoh-ho-hon *, 
  i think he means [ * honhonhon * ] ( https://youtu.be/tzz_wh9cvpc ), 
   i though unrestrained capitalism without social transfers has already been shown to not work if it `` works '' depends on what you want it to do if your goal is to generate capital then it does work if your goal is widespread prosperity and utilaitarian well-being then no for the majority it does n't work, 
  i do n't know why people in this thread seem to take these numbers as meaning `` see muslims are n't so bad ! '', 
  - these numbers are not good . 
  10 % of muslims * did n't * agree that democracy is the best political system ? 
  ** one in ten ?? 
  guy in my last picture has a stache, 
  i think making a documentary or even news article going through the various ways russia is distorting the narrative on things like crimea would be a good way to keep integrity and get the moneys, 
  notice the rafale is flying above the clouds with an empty cockpit i think this is a pr image of the rafale cockpit and possibly computer generated/enhanced, 
  i think the eurofighter photo was taken at a steeper angle than the other two - notice how you can see the bottom of the seat on the euro but not the other two it also appears to have been taken from a bit higher up so the controls seem smaller the `` messy '' look of the eurofighter is also partly an effect of us seeing more of its control panels whereas the two others almost certainly also have more buttons and shit not shown on the picture also the rafale is clearly computer generated - who is flying above the clouds with no one in the cockpit ? 
  if by kept you mean kept in an awful state then yeah sure the last guy is keeping his beard pretty well, 
  you can have a masculine looking beard and still have it not look like you just faceplanted someone 's pubes with glue on your face just google beard fashion example : [ hair and model aside ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/43/98/ce/4398ce3fbfe203e04f2c70a04233a5db.jpg ) the beard is full and do well for a muslim but it is still well kept compare to [ typical ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/09/02/1409654322820_wps_8_image003_png.jpg ) [ muslim beards ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/03/28/article-0-07c1a986000005dc-706_306x443.jpg ), 
  i get that the quran says to grow a beard but is there anything that says it has to always look so disgusting like they always have it ? 
  it looks like pubes i mean jesus go to a barber, 
  those who will not bend must eventually break,
