  the fact is the `` policy of cooperation '' allowed denmark to save the largest proportion of its jews compared to all other occupied countries who resisted what is the end goal here ? 
  to save people from harm or to go to war ? 
  normally the justification for war is to stop the enemy from killing your own , in this case the `` policy of cooperation '' did a better job of this than war would have done . 
  this ignores the wider war of course but denmark could never have had much larger impact there than it already did with covert resistance and intelligence leaking etc. 
  they do n't kill other bees they outcompete them, 
  i 've never claimed the vikings were some sort of all time champs on cruelty but that does n't mean the cruelty they did show is not bad in itself, 
  genghis khan was born about 100 years after the last viking ivasion of britain . 
  william the conqueror was already dead and kiev was an independent state by the time the mongols came to europe they were hardly in the same period the difference between vikings and the muslims is the muslims tried to bring their notion of peace with their invasions whereas the vikings ' only ever goal was to steal and enrich themselves . 
  mind you i 'm no fan of islam but the region prospered as a result of its expansion whereas the vikings only burned things down, 
  i think the raiding and pillaging was pretty bad, 
  wow, 
  i mean it 's kinda funny but it could have been more subtle than having actual signs saying `` turkey '' and `` kurds '', 
  if you read what you replied to you will see that / u/mathen wrote :  damn , one of my parents was n't born british , where do i surrender my passport ? 
   what would you guys say that our crown princess victoria and her siblings are ? 
  swedish or german ? 
  it is not contradictory to be part of an ethnic minority and be a citizen at the same time . 
  mexican americans , african americans , irish americans all are counted as americans and no one is flipping shit about it  should they not be counted as swedish ? 
  are you saying minorities are n't citizens ? 
  minorities are still citizens though we are n't talking about who has citizenship, 
  i 'm not talking about a downfall of civilization i 'm talking about comparing refugees of relatively similar cultural and historic background to refugees of a completely different background , a comparison that i 'm saying should not be done when considering the social and economic effects and needs of those refugees . 
  - they were much closer to the average german worker competitiveness in terms of education and transferable work experience/skills - language barrier is much smaller - east european refuges in germany did not obviously and necessarily [ violate agreements on asylum claims ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dublin_regulation ) in order to get to germany - east bloc people were/are physically indistinguishable and before you say this should n't matter the fact is it does , on many levels . 
  for example a kid growing up in an underprivileged neighborhood will take a very different attitude to society if he notices the most obvious common factor among poor people in germany is that they are n't white compared to if he was himself white in a country of white people . 
  it is n't conducive to integration and opens up for radicalization see for example : [ nation of islam ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nation_of_islam#teachings_on_race ) do you need more ? 
  east bloc people fleeing a collapsing soviet union are not comparable to syrian or somalian refugees, 
  putin wants the question of nato encroachment to be relevant for internal politics purposes he 's got no intention of competing with nato he just wants to make sure the russians want a strong leader , nato encroachment does that . 
  meanwhile he and his friends are siphoning money from the country through `` state '' oil companies and shit . 
  which is probably also why he desperately wants to stay in power or control whoever is in power after him : so that he wo n't be prosecuted for what he 's doing, 
  the pub scene is really blowing up, 
  or , more likely , whichever country would give him permanent residence and/or are likely to have a job for him, 
  yeah what is the point of having color coding if it codes for gibberish . 
  for instance why not have the nordic jag/jeg as the same color ... 
  i do n't know if the `` je `` s down in the balkans is from the same root but if so they should all be one color possibly one similar to the nordic one ( if they 're related which i suspect they might be ), 
  \\ - mysteriously unnamed police union, 
  more like `` you look so nordic '' and `` you should have kids '', 
  as a pretty typical tall `` nordic man '' this makes me ... uncomfortable i 've had germans/swiss/austrians talk * about me * in terms that echo creepily with this text, 
  eesti has been into nordic for a long time now on work visas, 
  what does populist right even mean ? 
  are they populist because they defend the welfare state despite being right-wing ? 
  who said they are even right wing , if they are defending the welfare state does n't that make them left wing ? 
  why would a ww2 german sub have cyrillic writing though, 
  sweden does n't have a minimum wage we win at capitalism ? 
  trying to match the west militarily while disregarding its failed economy seems like russia never learns, 
  there is nothing about democracy as a concept that necessarily protects minorities . 
  most modern democracies have laws and constitutions such that ethnic minorities or similar are protected but those rights and protections are only democratic because they have been democratically established  would it be okay for the 87 % to demand 100 % tax ? 
  to completely ignore the 13 % without listing to their thoughts ? 
  in a democracy the 13 % would have a right to have a representative speak publicly and debate the tax but yes if the tax is passed then a democracy can have a 100 % income tax, 
  that 's not what they are doing though, 
  how is it undemocratic for 87 % of the people to get their way ? 
  every other party has a policy that is contrary to sd 's and that is what the mandate of their votes is for so how are they going to cooperate with a party that has clearly stated it will only cooperate if they get immigration policy changes out of it ? 
  until they can form a coalition or majority support for what they want then it is n't undemocratic for them to not get what they want - on the contrary this is exactly what democracy * is about * if the richest 13 % voted for a party that promotes tax breaks for the top percentile earners would it be similarly `` spitting and shitting on the concept of democracy '' to keep current tax policy in place ? 
  it 's called [ sup * ra * national ] ( http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/supranational ) in english and the problem with the eu is that it was n't sold as a supranational union when most of these countries ( france , uk , netherlands , etc. ), 
  joined . 
  the lisbon treaty is nothing like what any of those countries entered into when they first joined . 
  also , the issue of supranational european rule was settled in * favour * of national states with sovereign rule in the [ peace of westphalia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/westphalian_sovereignty ) after what was basically a 30 year long slaughter fest . 
  a european union would be a nice thing but this eu encroachment to subvert national governments is not a good way to go and will only end badly . 
  it has happened before . 
  nothing is gained by dismissing euro criticism as some kind of populist rhetoric . 
  there is legitimate criticism of the eu and any organisation that openly talks about their own `` democratic deficit '' obviously needs fundamental changes . 
  i do n't follow cs is this a maymay in the csgo scene ? 
  what does sweden have to do with this, 
  he 's good with money, 
  yugoslavia exists on the map , i think it 's safe to say a lot of this information is outdated/irrelevant, 
  starts with c and ends with orruption, 
  but they muslim so it must be worse - american logic, 
  you are saying `` financial powerhouse '' as if they are surfing a wave they are the dominant economy because they have responsible politics , invovled citizens , and diligent workers . 
  they earned that money and greece has been receiving and lending to cover up for it 's economy for * decades * without its citizens protesting and now that they are rudely awakened it 's the hard working german who are the bad guys ? 
  i 'm no fan of how greece has acted in this crisis but this is a disgusting cartoon, 
  that is a sub for especially effective visualizations of data or visually pleasing data , not just `` interesting '' data on the most basic excel plot which is what more and more people have started posting there, 
   greece , on the other hand , entered in to currency union that was not an optimal currency area , with the hope that this currency union would solidify the european project and help unite europe . 
  this is a bit disingenuous as it ignores the fudging of the numbers to get in and all that makes it pretty obvious the greek hope was from the beginning to `` get in on the euro '' and cruise on euro assistance and credit rating until full fiscal transfer union was ahieved and they could spend the rest of their life like a us red state receiving unending transfers, 
  yeah them swedes just want to join nato the only reason they do n't is because public opinion wait what ? 
  we 're richer than malta the shocking thing here is n't that sweden is taking in more than malta , it 's that france is n't taking in more , especially since ultimately the current situation in syria was ultimately caused by france and the french syrian mandate, 
  you got something to say ? 
  privately funded by a saudi prince probably, 
  the problem is the very unpleasant history of sd , if sd did n't exist i 'm pretty sure m or other blue parties would have held their exact position right now it 's just they ca n't because then they are `` siding '' with a party that within the current members membership was outright supporting neo nazism, 
  but that would be racist !, 
  so it begins ... 
   english sounds or swedish ? 
  neither  kristianstad sounds like an english speaker would pronounce i doubt it 's correct then because there 's only one `` i '' in kristianstad for example and the middle part does n't exist in the english language afaik the closest i can make it in english is v\u00e4xj\u00f6 = v\u00e4sch\u00f6 \u00e4 is like ae in aerospace and \u00f6 is like e in herd and as i said i do n't think there 's a `` ch '' sound like the one in v\u00e4xj\u00f6 in english but it 's kinda like a more guttural `` sh '' in show kristianstad = krischansta ( same sch-sound as v\u00e4xj\u00f6 , no second i and no d ), 
  v\u00e4xj\u00f6 , kristianstad hint : they are not pronounced at all as they are spelled, 
  `` our spin on a difficult issue with many valid but competing perspectives '' ftfy, 
  from pdf :  `` effective as of july 1 , adopts a supplementary for 2015 budget and a 2016-19 medium-term fiscal strategy , supported by a sizable and credible package of measures '' ?? 
  what measures ? 
  calling it a `` credible package '' just makes it sound less credible it sounds like a street market vendor proclaiming the impeccable quality of his nijke boots, 
  sweden yes etc. 
  sweden , hotbed of `` western '' isis fighters , is already in this program while poland has almost no isis fighters, 
  `` ooh i 'm obeying basic international law and not destabilizing my neighborhood look at me on my high horse '' really ? 
  not if sweden had illegally invaded a neighboring country, 
  quite, 
  the right to asylum is a human right [ article 14 ] ( http://www.ohchr.org/en/udhr/documents/udhr_translations/eng.pdf ), 
  yeah fuck us for taking a responsible position in the face of a humanitarian disaster, 
  for some reason they are n't protesting their [ inhumane position on refugees of war ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/david-cameron-says-britain-will-accept-just-a-few-hundred-more-syrian-refugees-despite-4-million-looking-for-new-home-10332104.html ) but when their own government hand-out is threatened the mob gathers en masse hard to have any sympathy for their cause tbh, 
  i think they associate gay rights with sweden and therefore are more likely to be opposed to it, 
  so if denmark 's social democrats ( traditionally the workers party ) are anti immigration and all might one say they are ... nationalist social democrats . . or nationalist worker 's party ? 
  why does that ring a bell, 
  correct this is a hypothetical comparison `` what if they had it like the uk '', 
  most of them ( piigs plus finland ) are n't exactly doing well though, 
  well the factors that have led greece to where it is i.e. 
  no national bank and no control over monetary policy could and probably would still have a negative effect on sweden 's economy see : ireland , finland . 
  seems to me social democrats in de , sweden democrats in se and progress party in no are comparable labour in no , moderates in se and social democrats in se seem comparable rest i dunno,
