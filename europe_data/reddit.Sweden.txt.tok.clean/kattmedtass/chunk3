  of course . 
  we all know that . 
  we 're only talking about the celebration we 're participating in with this post . 
  if this had been a post centered on historicity then leopold should of course be included . 
  but this is about celebrating the national day , which is about celebrating a country 's successes . 
  that makes having his face on there a pretty tasteless move . 
  it the best ranked attractions * according to tripadvisor users * . 
  they tend to be the `` follow the guidebook religiously '' kind of travelers . 
  reasonable . 
  whales usually do n't venture inland . 
  hey that 's our thing . 
  get your own thing . 
  scandinavia has since roman times been considered the ancient homeland of the germanic peoples . 
  today a lot of people with ethnocentric mindsets holds the swedish `` race '' up as the most desirable one because it 's `` pure '' and the `` original germanic race '' . 
  hitler gave this idea an upswing in the 20th century . 
  v\u00e4lf\u00e4rd should be something inbetween * welfare * and * well-being * . 
  picture is two years old so i doubt op will be able to answer your question . 
  the reporter looking like a trailer park meth head makes this a particularly classy piece of news coverage . 
  eu mobilized support that arrived in 24 hours . 
  pretty fast considering all the equipment they have to bring . 
  and eu takes the bill for it as well . 
  perhaps . 
  about time some unity was felt here , instead of constant conflict and suspiciousness . 
  not to be confused with the idiotic exceptionalism of `` europe is the best place in the world '' , `` i love europe '' is a pretty important sentiment and is merely a expression of subjective opinion . 
  it 's when it passes over to the `` x is the greatest country on earth '' - level of exceptionalism that america has been spewing for decades that it becomes dangerous . 
  * `` i love europe '' / `` i love america '' * = harmless personal expression of a very subjective feeling : not trying to impose a truth . 
  `` europe is the greatest '' / `` america is the greatest '' : treating something that is utterly impossible to prove as if it 's an objective fact = trying to turn a subjective opinion into an accepted truth . 
  that is exceptionalism . 
  lol . 
  `` european '' = / = nationalism . 
  the dynamic between nationalism and globalism in europe is very different from in america . 
  success breeds jealousy, 
  they 're just salty because their oil money and cigarette smoking respectively has n't amounted to any kind of global relevancy whatsoever . 
  success breeds jealousy, 
  exactly where is the hatred and racism ? 
  it 's satire . 
   america leads , it 's what we do the arrogance and indoctrination is strong in this one . 
  * one of us *, 
  it 's the other way around baby . 
  being fabulous is hard work . 
  there is absolutely no metric , data or science that supports your statement . 
  i would n't be surprised if a group of pesky little vikings once upon a time rowed past this very spot in search of a village to plunder . 
  i imagined it [ like this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fsoz5sc.png ) . 
  designed it for when i formed scandinavia in victoria 2 - heart of darkness .

  `` william the conqueror did nothing wrong ! '', 
  careful now , the seine looks mighty tempting this time of the year ... * commence rape and pillage *, 
  it 's probably just among op and his friends . 
  and other young geeks who wants to feel like a viking for a moment . 
  pretty much no one does in norway either ( ops country ) . 
  that 's just a thing among fantasy geeks who think vikings are fucking cool as fuck ( me included ) . 
  apartment prizes are definitely lower in gothenburg and malm\u00f6 and getting a rental contract is waaay easier . 
  gothenburg is lovely and the people are great but there 's too little to do there to justify a move from stockholm for me . 
  edit : why is this downvoted ? 
  the prizes * are * lower . 
  check hemnet.se and compare . 
  a close friend of mine is a real estate agent in stockholm and he needs to keep up with how the market looks like in gothenburg and malm\u00f6 for his job , and we 've discussed it a lot . 
  i 'd like to think they meant smallest in terms of global relevancy ... 
  it tastes like the color grey . 
  [ way out west ] ( http://www.wayoutwest.se/line-up/ ) is also a big one . 
  and [ into the valley ] ( www.intothevalley.se ) is on the road to become one of the best regarded electronic/underground house and techno music festivals . 
  this just in : alcohol is a drug . 
  exactly . 
  it 's very much like the old romanticized notion of the [ `` noble savage '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/noble_savage ) in a modern conception . 
  instead of the old idea of `` the noble man of nature , uncorrupted by civilization '' that was applied to certain peoples , scandinavians are seen as `` a noble , civilized people not corrupted by barbarism '' who are now getting `` corrupted '' . 
  it 's ridiculous . 
  i agree with you to a small degree , but claiming that most swedes on the internet are right-wing is just not true . 
  you make it sound like it 's only right-wing swedes who use he internet . 
  the right-wingers are just a lot more vocal about this though , so i can understand how you could 've arrived at that conclusion . 
  they feel like they 're the underdog against `` political correctness '' so they get a lot louder about it , feeling like they 're backed by the historical greatness in being `` revolutionary '' . 
  i 'm pretty sure this has more to do with eurocentrism and notions of white supremacy . 
  and sweden is like * the * whitest country on earth so it has become a romanticized and vilified symbol from all sides . 
  while you 're referring to a few posts by faceless people on reddit to validate your opinion , the whole us foreign policy and military action for the past 70 years has been explicitly based on convincing other nations that american values are superior to everyone else 's . 
  so you really do n't have a leg to stand on here , buddy . 
  i 'm not trying to vilify america here , but your ridiculous reasoning is unfortunately forcing my hand . 
  yep , and that 's why they make up the narrative that everything is falling apart in europe , to validate and legitimize that opinion . 
  progress !, 
  incredible .

  i imagine the vikings being like : -- man , that 's a cute dog -- ja ... * too * cute . 
  is no fear , only cute . 
  -- ja , christians will laugh at us . 
  no good -- yes , knut , give ur wolf let 's make dog, 
  yeah , this is something i forgot to address in the post . 
  the fetishizing definitely comes from both political camps , either to discredit someone else 's views , or to legitimize one 's own . 
  i 've had my computer set to english since i got my first one when i was 11 . 
  i had installed the english version of the os by accident and i did n't bother redoing it with swedish . 
  then when i got my next computer which has it in swedish from the start i just found myself missing having it in english . 
  i had gotten used to it and googling things were much easier since there was a lot more information to be found on different subjects in english . 
  also , all the software i had gotten familiar with had been in english so i only knew the english terms for certain functions ( especially photoshop ) . 
  yep . 
   i genuinely avoid the bbc/reuters like the plague . 
  the simplification alone is mind-numbing . 
  the `` simplification '' is actually objectivity . 
  especially reuters . 
  they , together with for example the associated press , are a news agency , not a news magazine/publication . 
  they are the actual , factual source of most of the news you see on the more opinionated sites/papers . 
  it 's their job to be `` simple '' and only report what is happening , not providing the analysis and opinion . 
  the different publications use these as their sources and then color and enrich ( or twist , depending on your opinion ) with analysis and associations to other news events in order to make their own unique content .
