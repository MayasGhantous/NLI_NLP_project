yay , i 've hiked through all of swedens heritage site , 
  their server hall in sweden is located in [ lule\u00e5 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lule%c3%a5 ) , with a population of 75k and a university with a good technical faculty . 
  i think they do employ quite a few people . 
  that stood out , but considering the door breaching . . 
  they were probably already in the area with civilian clothes ; special forces style ? 
  he has an interesting story , but is far from the likes of raoul wallenberg or dag hammarskj\u00f6ld . 
  do n't forget nobel , 
  `` would you say that france has more solidarity than two years ago ? '', 
  . . i think . 
  that 's just a joke . 
  like how we joke about norwegians being stupid and finns being macho-alchoholics . 
  finnish people joke about swede 's being spoiled , feminine and homosexual . 
  i live in a region that gets plenty of exchange students from finland . . and , the only stereotype people still believe is the rampant alcoholism one . 
  and i 'm not sure we 're the ones to be judgmental on that one . 
  well . . does it matter ? 
  most of * europe 's * internet traffic goes through the uk , where it 's routed through an nsa complex and after that it goes through the trans-atlantic cables . 
  it would be more interesting to see a comparison between powerful boardrooms on different continents . 
  i 'm just saying if a british newspaper wrote about the ten best cities in the world , i doubt three of the cities would be in italy . 
  same if it was a french paper or a spanish one . 
  yeah sure , but it just feels that visiting italy gives you bragging rights in the u.s. and marketing something as * italian * in america is better then marketing it as * french * or * spanish * or any other comparable nationality . 
  and americans with italian heritage just wont shut up about it . 
  maybe it 's just me . . , 
  what 's with americans hard on for italy ? 
  i think it has to do with geography . 
  i mean , north of rovaniemi is n't very populated ( right ? 
  ) , so there should n't be much light pollution . 
  but still shows up as gray . 
  the areas in sweden that are totally black are all in the mountains . 
  i really expected finland to have a lot more black than it has . 
  i had n't heard about any swedish gym-razzias , so i did a quick google . 
  the gym-razzias seem to be incredibly successful . 
  35 arrested on suspicion and roids confiscated on 13 addresses . 
  the gym-razzias have been reported to the justice-ombudsman for only picking out `` men of a certain appearance '' , the report only seem to have a problem with the fact that no women were arrested . 
  first i thought the numbers were a bit high . 
  but i double checked the statistics for sweden - and it seems to be between 20-25 % of all pregnancies that get aborted . 
  a majority in the 9th week . 
  [ swedish social services rapport ] ( http://www.socialstyrelsen.se/publikationer2012/2012-11-6 ), 
  in sweden it 's too seldom to warrant the banks changing their atm 's . 
  if my home internet does n't work and i absolutely need to use the internet right that second . 
  well , then i use my phone . 
  if my phone was say ... broken , i could just use the internet at work . 
  or at the library . 
  or at some random caf\u00e9 . 
  or pub . 
  or . . well . . wherever . 
  it 's waaaay easier to find free internet than it is to find an atm . 
  it 's not that your system is * bad * - there just is n't any big demand or use for it here . 
  everybody has internet and everybody uses internet . 
  those that do n't probably would n't trust an atm either . 
  hm , i 'll have to try that !, 
  huh ? 
  what 's the name of the whitefish equivalent ? 
  never heard of it , but would love to try !, 
  well , `` grav '' used to mean simply a hole that was man-made . 
  and the meal has nothing to do with tombs or graves - rather that it was just spiced and then buried . 
  haha , i guess it kind of does . 
  if you were to translate it , i think the best translation would be `` buried salmon '' , but that does n't sound nearly as appetizing . 
  i think gravlax is our strongest card . 
  maybe some v\u00e4sterbotten cheese . 
  but 3.5 % is the beer of the people !, 
  4.6 % is just .1 % from being mellan\u00f6l . 
  not proper at all !, 
  plenty of swedish courses for germans . 
  also plenty of german students in swedish universities . 
  northugg is a beast . 
  was a big vote some years ago whether the fra could start tapping in to digital signals . 
  before they were just checking radio signals . 
  the vote passed . 
  we also have some history with weird espionage in this country , so if this is true - i 'm really not surprised . 
  but i kind of doubt that nsa has any ground people here in sweden . 
  you know how to pick 'em , 
  why imprison the elders ? 
  it sounds like the start of an eddie izzard joke . 
  i think that makes everything confusing because an elk can be another type of animal in the deer family . 
  if you say moose , everybody will know what you 're talking about . 
  naah , it 's actually kind of fun . 
  it started in some small village up here in the north where they needed to fix up a community house in the village . 
  but they would n't get municipal financial aid and nobody wanted/could pay for it themselves . 
  so somebody in the community council came up with the idea that sex sells - so why do n't we just get some volunteers to pose in their underwear and then we 'll make a calendar . 
  some examples : [ jutis calendar ] ( http://jutis.se/ ) [ h\u00e4rjedalen calendar ] ( http://www.ranningsvallen.se/index.html ), 
  / u/easyfuckingpeasy, 
  [ here ] ( http://imgur.com/a/t9dh0 ) is some love from the north of sweden . 
  i 'm really curious as to what the writing ( kanji ? ), 
  in northern scandinavia is . 
  especially along the gulf of bothnia . 
  well there has been some bickering about women 's football , in the context that we 're hosting the european championship . . something . 
  i do n't think any store bothers with that . 
  people just realize that things have different costs in different places and do n't think too much about it . 
  i noticed that in the uk . 
  cheap monday 's actual business plan is to provide quality jeans for around 40 $ . 
  or at least that used to be the business plan . 
  almost all non-grocery products in sweden has these kind of tags without the perforation . 
  usually just compares n/s/d / fi though . 
  not backed up by voter turnout data . 
  source : http://www.idea.int/vt/countryview.cfm?country=se, 
  highest crime rate in europe . 
  only in arvidsjaur  some cool facts about arvidsjaur : * sweden 's pilot high school is located there * jaur is sami for lake * most european car manufacturers test their cars for winter conditions around that area . 
  so there are a couple of big hotels that are shining-esque during the summer and packed with germans during winter . 
  * the centre of the town is literally a parking lot . 
  the most consumed news is the state owned tv-channel ( svt ) , which i must say suck at european news .
