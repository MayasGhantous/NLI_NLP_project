  it goes under `` international '' . 
  our two most popular news papers/tabloids are metro and aftonbladet , both are shit . 
  then we have two largest liberal news papers svd & dn , which both are actually rather good at covering european news - although it goes under the international headlines . 
  we also do have a very good supply of foreign news papers in our libraries . 
  [ relevant scale for assessment ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/common_european_framework_of_reference_for_languages ), 
  it looses all meaning if translated . 
  it 's not easy ( latvian ) being estonian . 
  but it 's cool ( baltic ) . 
  so , without parenthesis ; it 's not latvian being estonian , but it 's baltic . 
  i know a great swedish joke about estonia ; det \u00e4r inte lett att vara est , men det \u00e4r balt !, 
  but there was a previous opening a couple of years back ? 
  was n't there ? 
  edit : i was thinking about [ this opening ( article in swedish ) ] ( http://www.dn.se/nyheter/varlden/krigets-fasor-fram-i-ljuset-i-finland ? ), 
  did n't know . 
  i actually just assumed they were armenian because of his fascination for armenia . 
  the more you know !, 
  never met an armenian , but i know lord byron moved there and looked [ fabulous ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nugcteh.jpg ) in traditional armenian garments . 
  cool photographs that i have n't seen before . 
  a few years back ( 2008 i think ? ), 
  the finnish government released a lot of previously unpublished war photographs of very graphic nature . 
  they showcased things like cannibalism amongst the poor russian souls caught in the finnish motti 's . 
  i do really like the reindeer packed with supplies . 
  i know reindeers were used by norwegian sami 's to smuggle supplies past nazi checkpoints in norway for the allies . 
  not really similar to the british riots . 
  it 's very isolated and unorganized . 
  we had big riots in gothenburg against the `` war on terrorism '' , those were massive and got way out of hand . 
  these current riots are much smaller but they seem to have way more destruction of property in it 's wake . 
  it 's more like extreme vandalism than riots or protests . 
  they have a finance minister ? 
  one of swedens greatest song writers is dutch . 
   a american man finds his wife in bed with her lover , he grabs his gun and shoots the other man . 
   a saudi man finds his wife in bed with her lover , he grabs his wife and takes her out to the town square and stones her . 
   a swedish man finds his wife in bed with her lover and asks `` what did i do wrong ? '', 
  this is a joke i 've heard a couple of times meaning to show what a bunch of sissies we are . 
  but really , which solution is the least stupid ? 
  buying sex is illegal , selling sex is legal . 
  oh was it one of those municipal youth jobs ? 
  for like 15-16 year olds ? 
  50 sek / h ? 
  what on earth did you work with and how old were you ? 
  but that 's kind of the point , there is no regulated minimum pay . 
  however most people are members of a union and they collaboratively bargain their salaries . 
  sweden 's old emergency number was 90 000 , so stupid . 
  oh lappland is a official geographical area in both sweden and norway , it 's just that what 's outlined on the map seems to be a cultural area that ought to be closer to `` sapmi '' which is an unofficial geographical area - but the cultural area of the sami people . 
  so today i would n't say that `` lapp '' is un-pc , it just refers to people in the lappland area , rather than the sami people . 
  should n't `` lapps '' be [ sapmi ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/s%c3%a1pmi_ ( area ) ), 
  the term `` curling parent '' comes from the sport of curling referring to the aspect of the sport that is brushing the ice in front of the stone to reduce friction . 
  in america the concept is usually called `` helicopter parent '' as the parent is always hovering overhead . 
  blue banana . 
  oh c'mon - this submission seems to just bait for attention and drama . . 
  it 's from a comedy show where he proclaims a bunch of things about germany and the other contestants has to guess whether it 's true or false . 
  they say that it 's true that germans have a higher iq and also give a source . 
  i must have clicked somewhere wrong , what i watched was a speech with [ this guy ] ( http://youtu.be/_rmzmxbzc8w?t=50s ) . 
  but wasnt this clip , he speaks quite clearly here . 
  the one i originally watched it was almost difficult to comprehend . 
  what a guy to stand up in the ep with that stutter !, 
  but ... god how difficult to listen to . 
  edit : i must have clicked somewhere on youtube , what i watched was a speech with [ this ] ( http://youtu.be/_rmzmxbzc8w?t=50s ) guy . 
  kista galleria is open until 2100 all days of the week . 
  regarding your flag flair , why does it say `` oink '' rather than `` portugal '' ? 
  what is a real libertarian ? 
  i 've heard a lot of different definitions of the concept - all claiming to be `` real libertarian '' . 
  so , what do you believe ? 
  what are your ideals ? 
  is n't it ? 
   in sweden we had a butcher who , with state regulated calculations of meat content , had to write down that his sausages had a meat content of 116 % in his sausages . 
  brought up some confusion , but was all according to law . 
  oh the embarrassment . 
  i 'll redact my bolded comment and leave it there for context . . 
  really ? 
  the banana ? 
  come on !, 
  oldest myth in the book . 
  a lie brought up by eurosceptic british media that spread all over europe . 
  the whole law was basically just copied from regulation that already existed in most of these countries through different trade organizations in to the official eu law . 
  and the very strict regulations of size on bananas was only for the `` extra class '' bananas , not the usual class ' that most stores have and sell . 
  also !, 
  it was a regulation basically for the farmers and importers - would never affect the european retail . 
  ~ ~ do you know those americans that believe the stupid stuff on fox news that you despise ? 
  you 're being one now . ~ ~ [ here is the original commission regulation text that you 're referring to ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/lexuriserv/lexuriserv.do?uri=celex:31994r2257:en:html ) edit : did you know that there are several ways of making irony and sarcasm far more easy to read , of which reddit have implemented none . 
  that sounds like an extreme undervaluation . 
  roche & b\u00f6hmmermann is kind of cool , though . 
  i read a bit further and apparently they managed to make an exception for pizza to count the 1/8 cup of tomato sauce as 1/2 cup of tomato sauce - which makes it a vegetable . 
  now im trying to find how many cups of tomato sauce warrants a vegetable by european standards . 
  wow , it 's [ true ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/18/us-usa-lunch-idustre7ah00020111118 ) . 
  sometimes you see somebody with a jeep or hummer . 
  but , i mean . . bmw , mercedes , volkswagen , peugeot , volvo , saab and the british ones . 
  what does it mean ? 
  i only have two friends in the military , neither will probably tell you that they are military the first time you meet them . 
  they do n't want to be judged . 
  one loves his being in the military , with somebody telling you what to do and what not . 
  the other guy just likes the opportunity to work out while on pay . 
  one really wants to go to afghanistan , but have stopped mentioning this because people get so upset . 
  all in all , it 's not really a respected profession i would say . 
  northern edge of europe ? 
  = / i live in the north of sweden . 
  schmidt is a quotation machine , all his quotes should always be in context and preferably with video evidence so you can figure out how serious he is being . 
  have schmidt stopped smoking ? 
  might be the first photo i 've seen of him without a cigarette . 
  i 'm glad giscard is still keeping his style , with a glass in his hand .
