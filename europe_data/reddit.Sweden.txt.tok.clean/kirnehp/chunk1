that 's a though one but i have to say this one . 
  [ kent - mannen i den vita hatten ( 16 \u00e5r senare ) ] ( http://youtu.be/rf-b2lnrn3a ) . 
  the band is absolutely amazing but are disbanding and performing their last tour atm . 
  note that this is a fan-made video . 
  til, 
  credit to / u/kattmedtass / who found the picture and posted it on our local subreddit . 
  http://stockholm.headsaflamemedia.com/2014/03/08/in-the-1700s-the-swedish-cavalry-experimented-with-moose/ we tried . 
  according to other posters they were in fact [ germanic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/common_germanic_deities ) . 
  but both the anglo-saxons and the norse are germanic tribes . 
  yeah , the original images was of . svg format which i could n't upload to imgur . 
  i realized way too late that i managed to crop out not only half of greece but all of malta and tunisia/algeria/morocco . 
  i do n't deserve my / r/eternityclub membership . . :(, 
  til, 
  i ca n't take credit for the maps . 
  i just collected them in an album and shared them here . 
  interesting read . 
  thanks . 
  good call . 
  after reading about agnlo-saxon paganism it is eerily similar to the norse kind . 
  one of them has to derive from the other . 
  was n't the anglo-saxons in part made up of people from the southern parts of scandinavia ? 
  i found it pretty interesting that the most of them are derived from old norse gods but saturday comes from saturn . 
  found these on wikipedia and figured it would interest a few of you . 
  unfortunately a bunch of them seem to be incorrect . 
  sorry about that . 
  edit : spelling . 
  weird . 
  that was not the case when we visited . 
  at all . 
  the last one is n't true everywhere but if you travel inland you 're bound for at least some interesting experiences . 
  & nbsp ; a couple of years ago i , and two friends , went [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yangshuo_county ) . 
  apparently this town is a very popular school trip destination for high school students , so there were a lot of students there who allegedly had never seen a westerner irl before . 
  i and one of my friends look extremely swedish ( tall , blond , the whole nine yards ) and it was absolutely crazy . 
  everywhere we went 15 year old girls followed us around . 
  after a while three girls took courage and went forward and asked for a photo . 
  we , of course , agreed and posed for a photo with them . 
  immediately after the picture had been taken they just started to scream . 
  like screaming their lungs out . 
  like the girls in the audience watching the beatles in the 60s kind of scream . 
  it was absolutely surreal and something i 'll never forget . 
  [ this ] ( https://s14.postimg.org/79xb3mnr5/china.png ) is more my experience of china . 
  edit : a word . 
  kinda harsh to blame the whole turkish population for this one though . 
   it probably is true that paris is the most overrated city in europe , but that 's because people have expectations that surpass anything currently found on the earth . 
  i know for a fact that many people in china think this way about paris , i believe that many south koreans and japanese are similar . 
  [ the paris syndrome ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paris_syndrome ), 
  how should the society retaliate in your opinion ? 
  i checked that as well . 
  was just curious how they were larger . 
  i mean at least here in sweden ikea is just ridiculous as a people 's magnet for shopping areas . 
  jysk does n't really compare at all . 
  how is the situation in denmark ? 
  in what way is jysk larger than ikea besides number of stores ? 
  i 'd say [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trollh%c3%a4ttan_school_attack ) should be included as well . 
  do you have a source for that claim ? 
   government seems to be more concerned about your reputation abroad than it is about the actual existing problems that sweden has . 
  i do n't really get this . 
  why does these things have to be mutually exclusive ? 
  most governments can do several things at once and i have a hard time believing that this took several hundred man hours to write .

  i would say middle of may to late august . 
  swedish summer is fantastic but a fickle beast . 
  some years we 've had +5 \u00b0 c and freezing rain in june but last year we hade +25 \u00b0 c in the middle of september . 
  the only thing certain regarding swedish summer is that it really is not certain at all . 
  it 's been a weird snow year in stockholm , we got record level of snow in november and the plowers was caught of guard and nothing worked . 
  a narrative was made that it was because of the feminist snow plowing system but that was n't the case . 
  after that we 've had hardly any snow at all . 
  no , the object was to put more focus on the removing of snow on the walking tracks and the roads which buses traffic instead of putting all the focus on the car roads . 
  it was called feminist snow plowing in a populistic way because more women than men walk or use public transportation but it back fired . 
  however , it 's kind of sad that it , through a lot of filters , ends up being :  what it said was something like `` snow plowing roads of female residents '' or some shebang like that, 
  i believe the pylon part of the oresund bridge actually is in sweden . 
  however , the pylons on the great belt bridge is 50 metres taller . 
  sorry , i should have read the rules better . 
  sorry , bad phrasing on my part . 
  to be fair , every city in that part of the us ( montana , idaho , wyoming ) is kind of obscure . 
  i have n't made this myself , i found it and figured it would be interesting to share . 
  i know a lot of cities are missing ( including my home town stockholm ) but it still gives the gist it . 
  i think it 's more an exaggeration of [ jesse ` poolparty ' puljuj\u00e4rvi 's ] ( http://imgur.com/glloi6n?r ) looks . 
  vetlanda is indeed very much in southern sweden , even population wise . 
  make sure that you do , it is absolutely mind blowing and deserves all praise . 
  but it sure is a fantastic museum . 
   i get that problem all the time when i try to plug usb cables . 
  just make sure that [ the usb symbol ] ( http://i.stack.imgur.com/uuoctm.jpg ) point upwards .

  built in 1887 and at it 's peak it was the world 's largest phone exchange with about 7000 lines . 
  sadly it burned down in the 50s . 
   the term `` baltic '' stems from the name of the baltic sea -- a hydronym dating back to the 11th century ( adam of bremen mentioned latin : mare balticum ) and earlier . 
  although there are several theories about its origin , most ultimately trace it to indo-european root * bhel meaning white , fair . 
  i did about 3000 km ( 1500 km + 1500 km nonstop ) with an old volvo and a caravan in june of 2012 . 
  no issues at all . 
  he 's lying . 
  i think they are lined with shotcrete . 
  your photos are absolutely gorgeous !, 
  haha , that 's awesome . 
  thanks for the link !, 
  of course it does n't look as good as this irl . 
  but i still find it really beautiful and compared to metros in most other cities it sure is spectacular .

  like / u/kwowo / said sweden is n't really that mountainous .
