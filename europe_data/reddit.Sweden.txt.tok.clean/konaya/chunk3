  holy stereotyping , batman !, 
  asia is * huge . 
  what 's puzzling to me is that that 's not even high-end fancy cheese which you would expect to be subject to smuggling . 
  that 's oltermanni -- a bloody * farmer 's cheese . 
  * the recipient country must have a serious cheese deficit for farmer 's cheese to be smuggleworthy . 
  well , not the kinder eggs down at the american level of thinking . 
  chicken eggs are just fine , though . 
  well , i meant figuratively . 
  `` in the same jurisdiction '' , then . 
  this is what we do in sweden . 
  do you even lift ? 
  seriously , though . 
  why even import eggs ? 
  sponsor your local farmers , dammit . 
  never purchase produce from a farmer that is n't within punching distance . 
  so you think we should drill through all ice caps to find the actual height of every mountain ? 
  no , he visited eastern sweden . 
  pay attention . 
  we 're talking about the use of chlorine , bromates , and peroxides here . 
  you know , the food bleaching agents banned by the eu , per the fucking op . 
  * chemically ... bleached ... flour ... * for crying out loud , us , learn how to food . 
  if you 're going to snark , at least do it properly . 
  it 's * thou shalt . 
  this is counterintuitive to me . 
  american imports tend to be really expensive . 
  while i ca n't say anything about seoul 's subway , [ ours is definitely worth seeing .

  would you mind telling me what it is that * does * make you nordic ? 
  i would n't mind counting you to the nordic countries -- i 've sung several songs in estonian swedish , come to think of it -- but you have n't really explained anything to that end . 
  try doing that , instead of these watered-down insults . 
  have a look at wikipedia . 
  have a look in any encyclopaedia , really . 
  estonia is * not * nordic . 
  swedes are already nordic , so there would n't be much point in saying we 're * wannabe * nordic . 
  if you do n't like unintelligent argument , what 's all this then ? 
  i 've been going through infinity turns trying to get anything coherent out of you . 
  you could have spoken your mind all at once , but instead you chose to answer laconically , just keeping the ball rolling with minimal effort . 
  * that 's * unintelligent argumentation , my non-nordic friend . 
  you 're making my point for me . 
  i have * never * said that you want to * become * nordic ( or `` want into '' , as you so eloquently put it ) . 
  i have said that you want to * be * nordic , as in you want that fact to be true . 
  hence `` want to be '' ; hence `` wannabe '' . 
  the fact that you choose to attack me for jokingly pointing this little historical quirk out in relaxed conversation with another person says way more about you than it does about any inaccuracies i might have spouted . 
  well , the argument here is that the baltic nations like to pretend that they are nordic -- and in fact we co-operate quite well together -- despite not being nordic . 
  it 's not meant pejoratively , so there 's no need to be all stuck-up about it . 
  you have n't explained why it would be `` unintelligent '' . 
  it appears as if it 's the only long word you know , and you brandish it like a superstitious man would a cross . 
  speaking of unintelligent . 
  do you not know what the word ` exactly ' means , or are you deliberately being obtuse ? 
  yes ? 
  what exactly are you disagreeing with ? 
  you seem to confuse ` become ' with ` be ' . 
  `` wannabe '' means `` want to be '' . 
  for want of a better word . 
  * aspiring * nordics does n't have the right shade . 
  is n't that the point ? 
  that must have been confusing at some point . 
  it almost looks like a us state flag . 
  yeah ... `` if '' . 
  well , are n't you sort-of wannabe-nordics ? 
  you are now an honorary moderator of / r/sweden . 
  jokes aside : while we ca n't read it out-of-the-box , german is very easy for swedes to learn . 
  the grammar is a bit more complex -- pretty similar to that of 13 ^ th century swedish , come to think of it -- but that 's about it . 
  we share a lot of word roots and stuff . 
  ** there are several countries in which tipping is considered a direct insult . 
  in china it implies you are distrustful of the other party and do n't believe they will honour their part without the extra grease . 
  in japan it implies you believe the other party to be so poor that they need charity . 
  it actually is seen as rude , as you are implying several unfavourable things about the establishment . 
  same thing in china . 
  they could barter and wheedle like the devil herself , but once a price had been agreed upon , they would * never * go back on their word . 
  honour and integrity . 
  as a swede , i will pick on danes , but vigorously defend them against others . 
  danes do the same for us . 
  we have a hatemance , and it 's exclusive . 
  so take a hike , yank .

  what a belgian thing to say . 
   i could never do such a thing . 
  are you sure ` homonym ' is the word you were looking for ? 
  there she goes again , making waves . 
  yes , but * mage * is slightly ( and i do mean slightly ) less obvious than * magi , * so i took the one i felt i 'd receive the least skepticism about . 
  english sidestepped gender altogether by importing the masculine plural form , * magi . 
  they have a * much * lower threshold for what they consider to be edible , but they also have good stuff . 
  this was the best entry to the contest since sweden 's in 1965 . 
  i am so , so happy we 're starting to see a trend towards actual music again . 
  or ` bugger ' , or ` bother ' , or almost anything except ` shit ' . 
  true , but she is also a fair bit older , and brits , while really pretty similar to swedes in many aspects , still have a class hierarchy complex swedes lack . 
  no idea what you just said there , mate . 
  he 's more than okay ; he 's our king . 
  being a bit relaxed and goofy is n't such a * faux pas * here as it seems to be over in north america . 
  that said , he is perfectly dignified when the situation calls for it . 
  what he * is n't * is stroppy just for the sake of being stroppy . 
  not goofier than the average bloke , surely ? 
  i think people are making the fundamental mistake of comparing him to politicians . 
  he is n't a politician ; he 's a congenital head of state . 
  it 's more like the slightly-less-than-half of the population which actually is using the internet is getting what the other half voted for . 
   i thought they were a pretty moderate country . 
  ... not trying to be edgy or anything , but what on earth led you to believe that ? 
  so you people are n't allowed to wear medals awarded by foreign nations on your uniforms ? 
  not even on your dress uniforms ?
