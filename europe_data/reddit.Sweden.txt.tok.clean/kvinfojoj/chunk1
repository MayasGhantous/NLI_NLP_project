huh , well whaddyaknow , looks like you 're right : 420.5 / km2 vs 412.3 / km2 . 
  if you want to one-up that , then there 's always the netherlands . 
  ask people around you irl : who is an expat , and who is an immigrant ? 
  you will get pretty uniform answers . 
  usually , the label expat is only used for certain privileged nationalities or social groups . 
  most of the time it 's a nicer way of saying the same thing , but in essence it 's grounded in racism/countryism/whatever-you-want - to-call-it-ism . 
  one time , me and a few family members were talking about how foreigners and different nationalities are viewed in different countries . 
  i am living abroad , and said `` as an immigrant , i. . . '' and then two people gave an involuntary burst of laughter , with the inherent meaning `` you ca n't be an immigrant , you 're swedish !, 
  immigrants are from the middle east and eastern europe . '', 
  wielding those kind of weapons ca n't be historically accurate , right ? 
  it looks like he would cut off his horse 's ears here : https://youtu.be/ypsuxllev1e?t=59, 
  while i agree with you in principle , the gema case is not so clear cut . 
  imo the gema-vermutung is a big problem ( all musical works are assumed to be managed by gema unless the music-user can prove that the work is `` gema-free '' or in the public domain ) . 
  despite representing private interests , gema has a monopoly on the market . 
  this is a very unhealthy situation . 
  the youtube-gema conflict spilled over to non-gema artists who time and time again got their content blocked . 
  soviet russia had free abortions early on , and gave women the right to vote before most of europe and the us . 
  they started kindergartens to lessen the load on women . 
  lenin talked about the advanced rights of women in soviet russia as a point of pride . 
  the historical podcast backstory had an interesting episode on us-russia relations last week and covered this . 
  i think that feature of german language is hilarious . 
  bruder -  brudi g\u00f6rlitzer -  g\u00f6rli sp\u00e4tkauf -  sp\u00e4ti it just sounds so ... itsy bitsy somehow :-p, 
  typ is often used when talking about someone informally in the third person . 
  `` was f\u00fcr ein komischer typ '' not too common , but among friends you can use mistkerl to affectionately call someone a bastard . 
  hey now , berlin is n't in the middle of nowhere , it 's in the middle of ... brandenburg . 
  ah , right . 
  yes , to a degree esperanto also has idioms , idiolects and regional variation in use . 
  / r/place, 
  i am a bit tired of the recent uk-bashing on this subreddit , but this was legitimately funny . 
  ** tl ; dr ** : you start out with learning the recorder ( the instrument , the flute ) in musical class before you learn other instruments . 
  no-one is saying just play recorders . 
  it 's an introductory tool . 
  nothing is lost by using it before other instruments , in fact a lot is gained . 
  even if no-one would ever speak esperanto outside of the classroom , teaching it would still be beneficial long-term . 
  for serious programming , would you ever make a program in scratch ? 
  does learning scratch before other programming languages make you learn other programming languages easier ? 
  yes , very much so . 
  in fact , it interests people who would otherwise be too intimidated by the initial threshold of learning programming , because they are able to do cool stuff fast without getting bogged down in heavy computer science stuff . 
  it 's just fun . 
  esperanto works the same way , but it is also a powerful tool in its own right , as opposed to scratch ( although that still has impressive functionality for what it is ) . 
  the problem with learning languages is getting past the stage where you hammer in vocabulary and grammar . 
  it 's boring . 
  it 's like reading an old dusty tome . 
  it makes you dislike language learning . 
  however , once you get past this ( usually after many years of school study ) , learning is more fun because you have reached a certain proficiency threshold : you can watch and understand movies , listen to and sing songs , say things spontaneously , roleplay , make jokes , write stories and poems without stopping every sentence to think about grammar . 
  once you 're at this stage , learning the language is a lot more fun . 
  the thing about esperanto is that it lets you get past the stage where you hammer in vocabulary and grammar ** really fast ** , and get to the stage where you can start using the language creatively . 
  this makes the students ' association with language learning more pleasurable and when they start grinding away at say german or english , they already know that it 's not gon na be hard going all the way , but they are eventually going to get to the stage where speaking is more of a joy than a chore and where the learning process was worth it and finally paying off . 
  you are saying that esperanto is not useful . 
  i 'm say that it is useful as a tool to learn other languages . 
  as a consequence , more works and media will pop up in the language , but that is a byproduct , not the end goal . 
  the language 's creator zamenhof also created a religion called [ homaranismo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/homaranismo ) , which is basically `` let 's just all get along , ok ? '' . 
  nowadays there is no religious connection to esperanto , though . 
  as an aside , there 's a japanese sect/religion called [ oomoto ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oomoto ) which was established around the year 1900 , in which speaking esperanto plays an important part , and zamenhof is revered as a god there ( although to be fair , many figures from other religions are also included as divine beings here ) . 
  my motivation is not ideologism , it 's long-term utilitarianism . 
  ** objective ** : facilitate communication between people and countries ** method ** : teach esperanto as first foreign language ( teaching it for 1 year is enough ) or alongside english . 
  ** results ** : ** 1 . 
  ** due to the [ propaedeutic value ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/propaedeutic_value_of_esperanto ) of esperanto , all subsequent languages much easier to learn , including english , at no real trade-off . 
  people who have studied 1 year esperanto and 6 years english will have better english knowledge than those that have studied english for 7 years ( see studies in the link ) . 
  ** in addition to communicating in the subsequent languages that they learn more easily , people are able to communicate with each other using esperanto . 
  ** due to the increased amount if ( incidental ) esperanto speakers , more media and more works will be created in esperanto , addressing your point . 
  the language need only be used as a gateway to other languages , a function which it excels at . 
  the rest will follow automatically . 
  note that esperanto was never meant to replace any languages , only to be used as an auxiliary language . 
  reddit is not a very good format for sharing music . 
  if i had linked 100 songs , you would n't have clicked more than 1 anyway . 
  of course it 's hard for the working classes to get involved - politicians speak 20-some different languages , and if they do speak english they often do it so badly that they do n't use it anyway . 
  your average person does n't have the energy , money or time to study a lot of languages . 
  that 's the whole point of esperanto - to be easy to learn and speak . 
  you just need 150 hours to get to the same proficiency level as 1500 hours of studying english . 
  esperanto is about making information and communication more easily accessible - not the opposite . 
  i do n't think we should actively work to replace english with esperanto . 
  but i see the value in having an easily accessible tool for communicating , and a lot of the resistance is just ill-informed cynicism more than factual objection . 
  there are plenty of books and there 's also a lot of music in esperanto . 
  here are some tunes : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jvc_if8cca ( manekeno ) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dnrtj9zegy ( juliano hern\u00e1ndez angulo ) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fobkkcbjuae ( mar\u00eda villal\u00f3n ), 
  yeah man !, 
  just look at these disgusting eu paper pushers : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jvc_if8cca ( manekeno ) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dnrtj9zegy ( juliano hern\u00e1ndez angulo ) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fobkkcbjuae ( mar\u00eda villal\u00f3n ), 
  good idea !, 
  the problem with learning languages is getting past the stage where you hammer in vocabulary and grammar . 
  it 's boring . 
  it 's like reading an old dusty tome . 
  it makes you dislike language learning . 
  however , once you get past this ( usually after many years of school study ) , learning is more fun because you have reached a certain proficiency threshold : you can watch and understand movies , listen to and sing songs , say things spontaneously , roleplay , make jokes , write stories and poems without stopping every sentence to think about grammar .

  the ** main limitation ** when it comes to language learning is motivation , and this property of esperanto directly addresses that issue , for esperanto itself and for any future languages that you learn . 
  what makes you claim that esperanto will never be be useful for scientific or political literature ? 
  in my eyes it has no clear disadvantages for this purpose , but many advantages . 
   in 1921 the french academy of sciences recommended using esperanto for international scientific communication . 
  a few scientists and mathematicians , such as maurice fr\u00e9chet ( mathematics ) , john c. wells ( linguistics ) , helmar frank ( pedagogy and cybernetics ) , and nobel laureate reinhard selten ( economics ) have published part of their work in esperanto . 
  frank and selten were among the founders of the international academy of sciences in san marino , sometimes called the `` esperanto university '' , where esperanto is the primary language of teaching and administration . 
  ---------------------------------  for several years , the aerological laboratory of tateno ( japan ) has issued its yearly reports in esperanto . 
  these volumes , containing on an average some 250 pages , 9 in . 
  \u00d7 12 in. , with many tables , diagrams , and maps , place at our disposal a wealth of information on local meteorological data , to which it was almost impossible for us to get access previously . 
  this example was followed a couple of years ago by the meteorological office of the trans-siberian railway , at karbin : the translation into esperanto is given by the side of the russian text ; which is a boon to the majority among us , who have found it much easier to master esperanto than russian . 
  this year , the institute of meteorology and geodynamics of ljubljana ( jugoslavia ) has followed suit , and i gather that similar institutions are considering taking the same step . 
  http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v129/n3248/abs/129170d0.html ---------------------------------  the ais san marino was founded in 1985 . 
  one of the central objectives of its founders was to create an academic framework free from discrimination by language . 
  the first paragraph of the ais constitution declares that ais members '' communicate with each other mainly in a neutral language '' .
