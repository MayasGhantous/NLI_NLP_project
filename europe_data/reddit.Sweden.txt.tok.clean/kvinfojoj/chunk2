  they decided that the closest they could come to this aim was the choice of esperanto as the working language . 
  among possible candidates , esperanto was the only one in which a significant body of scientific literature and a suitable terminology to be used in a higher educational context already had been developed . 
  ( ... ) while not much of a formal evaluation of ais language usage has been done , more than 20 years of practice have shown that esperanto works quite well in the scientific as well as the administrative field . 
  in other words , esperanto is suitable for running a university and reducing linguistic discrimination by a significant degree . 
  esperanto is very expressive . 
  you can make up completely new words , but people will understand them without ever having encountered them before due to the affix system . 
  for example , if someone had never heard the word `` prison '' and would see it in isolation without context , they 'd have to idea what it meant . 
  in esperanto , the word is `` malliberejo '' . 
  if an esperantist saw this word for the first time , in isolation without context , they 'd know what it meant . 
  mal - = opposite of liber - = freedom - ej - = place of - o = suffix indicating noun malliberejo = the place for the opposite of freedom = prison this means that you can write or speak in ways that people have n't written or spoken before , but you will still be understood and be grammatically correct . 
  you can also convert any word between being a verb , noun , adjective or adverb just by changing the last 1 or 2 letters , and you 're still grammatically correct and making sense . 
  / r/place, 
  bitterballen in swedish means `` the bitter dick '' . 
  they are damn delicious though . 
  - your first point is addressed in my link :  for example , studying esperanto for one year and then french for three years results in greater proficiency in french than when someone would only study french for four years . 
  this effect was first described by antoni grabowski in 1908 . 
  i 'm not claiming that this would always be the outcome for all groups and all languages , i am merely using it to show that this is not an either/or situation . 
  - also , `` all those hours '' is not that many hours . 
  the institute of cybernetic pedagogy at paderborn ( germany ) has compared the length of study time it takes natively french-speaking high-school students to obtain comparable ` standard ' levels in esperanto , english , german , and italian . 
  the results were : 2000 hours studying german = 1500 hours studying english = 1000 hours studying italian ( or any other romance language ) = ** 150 ** hours studying esperanto . 
  source : http://www.ladocumentationfrancaise.fr/rapports-publics/054000678/index.shtml  not to mention that if your only reason to learn esperanto is for it to be the gateway language to another one you wish to study , it is doomed to failure it is not my only reason to learn esperanto . 
  however , i think it would be great for more people to realize the propaedeutic value of esperanto . 
  one of the most common arguments against esperanto is that is not widely enough spoken ( estimates vary , between 1-2 million speakers ) . 
  introducing it as a first foreign language ( 1 year is enough ) to facilitate learning other languages would solve this problem , since we 'd have a generation who spoke the language effortlessly . 
  learning esperanto + other languages is not damaging , in fact several studies have shown that learning esperanto before a third language will help a lot in acquiring that third language ( be it english , german , spanish or what have you ) . 
  here are excerpts from some studies : ** columbia university , new york ( usa ) , 1925 -- 1931 ** ** aims : ** research on the question , if and to what degree a planned language can be more easily learned than an ethnic language . 
  ** conclusions : ** for native english speaking students , the results of studying latin , german , or french are better if such study is preceded by that of a planned language , as preparatory introduction ( eaton , p. 27-30 ) . 
  ** egerton park school , denton ( manchester , united kingdom ) , 1948 and following ** ** aims : ** study of less intellectually gifted students to ascertain if prior esperanto study facilitates french study . 
  ** conclusions : ** `` a child can learn as much esperanto in about 6 months as he would french in 3 -- 4 years ... if all children studied esperanto during the first 6 -- 12 months of a 4 -- 5 year french course , they would gain much and lose nothing . '', 
  ** middle school in somero ( finland ) , 1958 -- 63 ** ** aims ** : research the study of esperanto and the question of whether such study is advantageous or disadvantageous for the study of german . 
  ** conclusions : ** the language knowledge acquired with esperanto was evidently such as could not be reached ( under similar conditions ) with any other foreign language - the unchallenged superiority in the ability to use german achieved by the students who had studied esperanto was observed - the rapid results achieved in esperanto instruction raised the students ' courage and their faith in themselves ; the capacity to accept new ways in which to express themselves already constitutes a help , at the subconscious level , in assimilating a new foreign language .

  because it 's 10 times easier . 
  esperanto only has 16 grammar rules . 
  - latin has 3 noun genders , esperanto has 1 - latin has 7 cases : nominative , accusative , genitive , dative ablative , locative and vocative , esperanto has 2 : nominative and accusative - latin verbs are in one of 3 conjugation groups and many are irregular , esperanto has no irregular verbs , all are conjugated the same, 
  it 's not a serious comment or comparison , nor is it intended to be . 
  it 's only a model . 
  how does germany being an export economy make discontent grow ? 
  i can only imagine how terrifying the groke/m \u00e5rran / m\u00f6rk\u00f6 would be in this interpretation ... 
  i would never be able to sleep again . 
  having the river rhine as a border is very defensible . 
  when rome conquered anatolia and the levant , there were already administrative structures in place there and the previous rule was relatively centralized , so integration , taxation and stuff like that was pretty painless ( from the roman point of view ) . 
  in north europe , the land was poor , the germanic tribes were very decentralized and the terrain made for hard going . 
  during most of rome 's existence they were also not any threat of note . 
  these factors added together means that most emperors could n't justify conquering the land , because they would have to take troops from the eastern frontier and the parthians/sassanids were a way way way bigger threat . 
  which dialect is that ? 
  i agree , but it 's not about opinions , it 's about the behaviour of downvoting anything that gives strength to the `` other side '' of the positions that you support , or that does n't fit your preconceived notions . 
  i guess it 's unavoidable in the reddit format , but it 's sad how it often creates lots of small echo chambers . 
  yeah , i think it 's very sad . 
  i 'm tentatively pro-eu but there 's a strong trend on this sub to downvote everything that might be perceived as eu-negative , and it 's just incredibly counterproductive . 
  i guess it 's just how subreddits tend to go . 
  it 's just the english term for it here , the king was never called emperor , and the territory was never called empire in swedish . 
  my middle school ice hockey team once participated in a hockey cup in prague and did n't win a single match in the entire cup against the all-czech lineup , if that 's to anyone 's consolation .

  not sure how it is on a national level , but in my school you started with english in grade 2 ( 8 years old ) . 
  then in grade 7 you started with your chosen third language ( previously either german or french , nowadays also possible to pick spanish ) . 
  ah , thanks . 
  i think many people assume that most nations do it if they can , so the only difference is if they get caught in the act or not . 
  getting up on a high horse about it is kind of hypocritical if your own government potentially does the same thing . 
  i may be a bit daft here , but i do n't get it . 
  that 's some caesar shit right there . 
  then you have n't been listening . 
  people have been saying that for ages .

  it has to do with male mortality . 
  russian women born from 2010 to 2015 are expected to live to age 75.6 , while russian men are expected to live to age 64.2 , a gap of 11.4 years . 
  from what i 've read the main culprit seems to be alcohol and alcohol-related incidents , suicides and diseases .

  and if they do n't do it , she can say : `` look , i misused these funds ( but i am in the moral right because the eu is an immoral organization , so no harm no foul ) and they let me get away with it . 
  the eu is an impotent organization that is leaking money . 
  can you give some example on german culture that used to exist which is now taken away due to immigration ? 
  how many times have you been to germany ? 
  do you also practice this in your everyday life ? 
  make sure that your life and situation is perfect in every way before criticizing anything at all , and before reaching that point you keep your mouth shut ? 
  no , nobody does that . 
  germany is one of the safest countries in the world . 
  sweden stronk !,

  yes , there is a big problem , but the grenade attacks are most often gang violence . 
  foreign-born people are statistically overrepresented here , but the gangs are n't comprised of refugees / middle-eastern migrants currently . 
  it 's clearly sarcasm . 
  it 's because you save so much space building those crazily cramped stairs ... 
  the definition of rape is not the same in different countries , so it makes little sense to compare statistics , there are also other factors in play . 
  for example , us definition of rape :  `` penetration , no matter how slight , of the vagina or anus with any body part or object , or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person , without the consent of the victim . '', 
  https://ucr.fbi.gov/recent-program-updates/new-rape-definition-frequently-asked-questions ______________  swedish definition of rape : `` a person who by violence or threat which involves , or appears to the threatened person to involve an imminent danger , forces another person to have sexual intercourse or to engage in a comparable sexual act , that having regard to the nature of the violation and the circumstances in general , is comparable to enforced sexual intercourse , shall be sentenced for rape to imprisonment for at least two and at most six years . 
  causing helplessness or a similar state of incapacitation shall be regarded as equivalent to violence . '', 
  http://www.regeringen.se/49bb67/contentassets/72026f30527d40189d74aca6690a35d0/the-swedish-penal-code many countries require penetration - in sweden this is widened to `` engage in a comparable sexual act '' , which does not have to include penetration of vagina , anus or even mouth . 
  this fact alone makes comparing statistics moot . 
  also , some countries require the victim to physically resist or say `` no '' in order for it to count as rape - this is not the case in sweden .

  imo esperanto is a good candidate .
