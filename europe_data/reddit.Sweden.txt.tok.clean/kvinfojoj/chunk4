  if you value life , then the lack of it ( dying ) would suck . 
  `` i want to live and dying would suck '' does not mean that they are not ready to die , it means that their voluntary death would mean even more . 
  more education = more secular ( on average ) . 
  the norm there seems to be that women should n't be out and about , that that 's men 's business . 
  if you are challenging that norm , you are challenging the men 's authority . 
  you are questioning the way that things are done . 
  you are a disturbance to the status quo . 
  `` why ca n't you just stay at home like everyone else and we would n't have this trouble '' and so on . 
  today you 're going to the caf\u00e9 , but if you think that 's ok then tomorrow you might demand even more stuff like going to parties and drinking alcohol . 
  this chain of events would lessen our power over you and through that lessen our power as men - this is looking at it without taking religion into the picture , which of course plays a big role , but imo it 's mainly about power structure . 
  so trust the faceless men ? 
  we do n't have any ventilation in our apartment , so it 's great to use a dehumidifier in the bathroom after showering to get rid of most of the moisture without opening a window to let out the heated air in the apartment . 
  i often translate articles about lottery winners for work , and frequently the winner decides to remain anonymous ( hence gender is unknown ) . 
  `` hen '' is really handy in this context , otherwise you need to contort the whole sentence to avoid simply repeating `` vinnaren '' all the time . 
  it has its uses when it has nothing to do with ideology . 
  norwegian ( musical ) short film bald guy ( 12 mins , subbed ) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7bkg31ym5o, 
  i had the same experience , then i got n26 as one of my german banks . 
  downloaded the app and opened a bank account via passport verification in 30 mins or so , and the mobile app is pretty good ( not a shill , just a person frustrated with german bureaucracy ) . 
   half a month 's pay was the harshest conceivable sentence . 
  the article goes out of its way to emphasize that this was the only consequence , which is not correct . 
  she had to leave her post and was relegated from all government-related work , and others involved had to leave too . 
  she probably wo n't receive her severance package either ( being discussed but still not legally settled . 
  it would normally be upward of hundreds of thousands of euros ) . 
  i agree that the punishment should be harsher , but we should still strive for reporting to be accurate . 
  i only skimmed the report but i assume this also counts stuff like driving under the influence and accidents . 
  they also note that for cases where the user tested for thc and no other ** illegal ** drugs , this gets registered as thc . 
  this means that someone can be hopped-up on loads of legally gray research chemicals and thc , and still be counted as a thc death . 
  harsher prison conditions do not reduce post-release criminal behavior , and may even increase it : http://www.anderson.ucla.edu/faculty/keith.chen/papers/final_aler07.pdf yes , i know on an emotional level it feels wrong that someone who did a terrible thing is living somewhat comfortably . 
  but while it may feel good for people when someone who has committed crimes gets to suffer , the trade-off is that that person may be more inclined to commit further crimes in the future . 
  so really , you 're just trading your feeling of satisfaction for a more criminal society . 
  in this particular case , breivik will never be released from prison , so the post-release factor is n't really an issue , but in his case his situation is just a consequence from the system . 
  that part of the article is not correct . 
  the boss of transportstyrelsen had to leave her post and was fined 7 000 euros , and several more people with leading roles have had to leave . 
  the punishment is still very light though , hopefully this will have bigger consequences for those involved . 
  when people get out of the us prison system , do you think they are less likely or more likely to commit more crimes ? 
  oh no you did n't,

  sure , as long as you 're aware that your personal comfort in this regard comes at a high cost . 
  it 's better to not self-censure so that views that are not based in facts are aired , discussed and dispelled . 
  we should n't discourage people from admitting they were wrong or that they had an uninformed view , there 's too much of people `` digging in '' and sticking to their guns when faced with contradicting images already . 
  not much sunshine during winter + cold + strict drug laws focused on punishing drug users rather than getting them in treatment . 
  incoming `` we have the world 's oldest flag '' danes in 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... 
  says the german . 
  afn, 
  what is this - a center for ants ? 
  not actively wanting to leave , but the public is generally sceptical on more integration . 
  no , it 's a separation of church and state thing . 
  yeah , i 'm just thinking about it in a game theory sense , i do n't disagree with the netherlands ' legislative attitude regarding drugs - in fact my whole train of thought when i was 22 was `` hey , i smoked some weed with friends last summer and it was an enjoyable experience . 
  the netherlands ' laws are pretty chill when it comes to that , why not go and work there for a year ? '', 
  - said and done . 
  just another lesson in how well-intentioned lawmaking can have the opposite effect i guess . 
  that 's what i get for not partying for 10 years . 
  `` all we wanted to do was protect the protestant princes ! '', 
   possible for me to have a normal conversation with them online , unlike fellow danes could you expand on this ? 
  are you talking about political discussions ? 
  because that 's pretty toxic in sweden as well . 
  cannabis truly is a gateway drug that leads to horrible things . 
  next up albanians will adopt the valley girl accent . 
  looks like dishwasher tablets . 
  ** edit ** : after reading this article , it says the trend is that ecstasy tablets are starting to have higher and higher concentrations of mdma per tablet , up 200 mg per tablet . 
  is this really accurate ? 
  from what i 've been reading ( admittedly years ago ) , more and more of what 's labeled as `` ecstasy '' contains little or no mdma and instead substances with similar ( or not so similar ) effects . 
  my post was just a bad pun on `` nous avions '' being conjugated as imparfait when it was unnecessary to use , hence proving that the language itself was unnecessarily imperfect :-p, 
   nous avions le porte-avion this sentence clearly shows that french is an unnecessarily imperfect language ... / s, 
  my eyes ... 
  i live on the 4th floor ( no elevator ) . 
  i am reasonable , when a deliveryman buzzes me i can start walking down and meet on the 1st-2nd floor . 
  but what both hermes and dhl frequently do is not buzz at all , and just leave it with a neighbour across the street just to avoid potentially walking up stairs . 
  sometimes they do n't even leave a note : - /, 
   yea , but still if europeans had a magic wand they would wipe out turks . 
  istanbul has a tremendous importance to european history/culture . 
  they are still butthurt :3 really ? 
  that sounds a bit exaggerated . 
  imo from talking to people in scandinavia , they 're anti-erdogan rather than anti-turkey or anti-turks , things might be different in southern europe though . 
  there are more than 100 000 people with [ turkish ancestry in sweden ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turks_in_sweden ) . 
  most scandinavian people just saw turkey as an attractive tourist destination rather than through a historical or geopolitical lens , that has changed in the last 5 years with erdogan though , now people are more inclined to go to countries like spain . 
   would you fight for your country ? 
  what about with finland against russia to protect them ? 
  just wondering how is the situation in sweden :p afaik you guys are pretty relaxed too it it was an offensive war , i would not fight . 
  if it was a defensive war , i would fight . 
  although imo i would be more useful in cybersecurity or something similar rather than as a frontline soldier . 
  if it was finland , i 'd like to think that i would , but such things are easy to say in the comfort of your home , so who knows . 
   anyway , alright . 
  i dont have much info about bohemia but if they spoke german ... they were german ? 
  austria / austro-hungarian empire . 
  it was part of nazi germany for a short while but that was just a blip on the timeline . 
   i would be salty even if its certain it will never go back . 
  nationalism is so strong in the balkans and so low in germany . 
  striking difference . 
  even though the times of expansion are over and now things have changed a lot . 
  what you produce matters , not the land you control . 
  germany has a lot of power in europe they basically control it in a light way anway . 
  in germany , nationalism is generally seen as something to be wary of . 
  yes , take pride in what 's good about your country , but also be aware of what negative factors nationalism brings to the table . 
  that does n't mean that you should be a doormat to others or be weak-willed , just be mindful of what excessive nationalism can lead to . 
  i think the case would be the same for hungary if they committed that many atrocities in an offensive war caused by nationalism and lost . 
   when it comes to us people are quick to lay `` historical claim '' as a legit casus belli . 
  my perception is that `` historical claim '' is not seen as a legitimate casus belli in most of europe , which i think is a good thing , because you could use that to legitimize thousands of wars . 
  great britain vs usa , france vs algeria , sweden vs finland , russia vs eastern europe , not to mention the shitshow that would be africa . 
  an interesting read , thanks for the perspective .
