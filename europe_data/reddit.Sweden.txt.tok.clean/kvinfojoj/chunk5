  the part about the balkans surprised me , i had no idea that there were that many muhacirs , i will do some more reading on the subject . 
  a minor nitpick , bohemia was n't part of germany ( unless you mean germans in the broader sense of `` german-speaking people '' ) . 
  this is me putting words in germans ' mouths so take this with a pinch of salt , but i think the situation is similar to what you describe with kerkuk . 
  yes , it was a brutal amputation to lose that much territory that had a german majority , but what good would come from laying claim to that territory now ? 
  germans do n't live there any more , and what 's done is done . 
  time has passed , and germans are understandably wary of aggressive territorial demands and nationalism due to their past . 
  there 's no way they 're getting those lands back anyway . 
  they can choose to be salty over the situation , or just come to terms with it and let it go . 
  one of these paths is more constructive and is better for the country in the long run . 
  to reverse the question , do you feel `` butthurt '' at the loss of formerly ottoman lands ? 
  if not , then you understand the german situation . 
  strike while germany is sleeping !, 
  they can call it the schlafen plan . 
  ah , sorry , that was not my intention . 
  i only intended to make the statement stronger , as in `` not only is it sparsely populated , most swedes do n't even visit , ( hence they ca n't legitimately claim that sweden is so cold unless they live up north , which is statistically unlikely considering that op probably does n't interact with that many swedes ) '', 
  both are factually true , most swedes do n't live in or visit the north :-p ( my subjective definition is hudiksvall and up ), 
  latitude is n't negligible , but most swedes live in south-central sweden , and it 's a quite `` long '' country . 
  the part up north that 's really cold is very sparsely populated . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/belgrade#climate vs https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stockholm#climate pretty small difference . 
  however , you 've also got places like this : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nikkaluokta#climate but like i said , most people do n't visit the north . 
  edit : holy shit , you guys get a lot of rain in june . 
  yeah , they probably consider the term `` hard brexit '' too loaded , open to interpretation and useful for strawmanning by opponents . 
  and repeatedly used as a scapegoat to let local politicians off the hook ( this is no way limited to the uk ) . 
  there 's many things wrong with the eu , but some of the criticism is just ridiculous . 
  it 's not all about skin color , but it 's based on a perception of different nationalities being on different tiers . 
  `` oh , i ca n't be an emigrant , i 'm from the uk/france/sweden / whatever '' and so on . 
  the term has negative connotations in many people 's minds and migrants have always been considered `` the other '' , so i ca n't be a migrant , can i ? 
  no , i 'm an expat !, 
  there , no need to worry about it . 
  that 's plenty , 
  thanks !, 
  do you know what it 's called called ? 
  is it moskeerne bag sl\u00f8ret ? 
  looks like someone took `` qu'un sang impur abreuve nos sillons '' a bit too literally ... 
  rurik republic incoming !, 
  do n't forget your cross flag . 
  no nicking iceland 's design . 
  it 's been known since karl benz ' time !, 
  they asked for blodp\u00f8lse but got a blodp\u00f8l instead . 
  swede here . 
  spent 6 months in france , worked for 6 months in ireland , 1 year in the netherlands , currently in germany since 2 years back . 
  edit : i agree , french keyboards are pure evil . 
  having to use shift to make a full stop or type numbers ? 
  your troll game is weak and transparent . 
  yep , we 've got a few as well : skare -  bruchharsch/schmelzharsch - hurts like a mofo to walk on barefoot . 
  modd - snow mixed with gravel and salt and dirt , the kind of snow that ends up forming along roads . 
  slask - snow that 's very melted and slushy, 
  sant , 
  yep , could be . 
  i think the high rate of computer/internet usage in the nordics is also a contributing factor . 
  when people have the option of sitting home playing cs : go with their friends over voip on a friday evening , there 's less of a reason to go hang out downtown drinking . 
  it depends on the country . 
  finland seems to have lower alcohol prices than in sweden for example . 
  but yes , i would assume that there 's a correlation between price and consumption rate . 
  quote from wikipedia on swedish alcohol tax :  all marketing activities must be for the company itself and its own services , never for an individual product . 
  this is also the reason why all products are taxed on alcohol content , not on price , and that all products are sold with the same profit margin . 
  this explains why a cheap vodka can be seen as very expensive at 300 sek ( in 2011 prices ) whilst johnnie walker red label whisky is of a similar price . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/systembolaget#taxation_and_pricing making spirits more expensive than beer/wine in this way would also presumably lead to less alcohol consumption . 
  yep , that 's what i was getting at . 
  i really think you should rethink that name ... they do cocaine , not opium . 
  that 's the thing - it 's beer . 
  much harder to get an equal alcohol intake than countries whose culture prefer spirits than beer/wine . 
  nordic countries are more into party binge drinking ( a generalization , but true on average for non-elderly ) than drinking drinks on a regular basis on weekdays , with the exception of after-work in some work cultures . 
  i would assume that it 's that kind of regular drinking that would really add up over a year . 
  that 's inconsequential , i 'm just contesting the factually incorrect statement that i quoted . 
  `` no one is going to learn it fully to be able to use it '' really is n't true for esperanto , since there 's 1-2 million speakers who did learn the language . 
   virina\u0109eto haha , funniest translation of `` little bitch '' ever  first read this as `` virin-a\u0109eto '' , aka `` purchase of a woman '' . 
  some estimates on percentage of words coming from different language families : https://esperanto.stackexchange.com/questions/9/what-percentage-of-esperanto-words-come-from-each-major-language-family, 
  a big seller in my home town is gladiator - tomato sauce , cheese , fresh tomatoes , peperoncino , kebab , lots of b\u00e9arnaise sauce , and lots of french fries on top . 
  another one is indiana - tomato sauce , cheese , chicken , pineapple , curry , peanuts . 
  delicious . 
  i know plenty of americans whose german accents are way better than mine ( being non-german myself ) , so do n't sweat it , 
  here 's an example : https://youtu.be/pojmzdm8il0?t=304, 
  pfft , sweden annexing anything on the mainland ... would have looked good on a map for a year or two before inevitably losing it due to lacking in manpower , 
  that label belongs to another language ... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xk0h1wcpmhi, 
  turn and face the pay , p-p-paywall, 
  people how that there are sami language ( s ) , but would n't be able to name them . 
  many people know me\u00e4nkieli from the book/movie popul\u00e4rmusik fr\u00e5n vittula . 
  check it out if you have n't , it 's a good read . 
  or the person hiring your company dies , and you get to embark on an epic journey to get back to the black sea , all the while being harassed by enemy troops ... wait wrong millenium, 
  it 's a symbol of unity , so scraping off one of the stars does make sense . 
  i was on pfaueninsel yesterday , perfect timing with the weather , 
  here it is explained in `` normal '' english ( 3 min ) : https://youtu.be/eh3ld-l85is?t=394, 
  `` who am i ? 
  i can see why they went for 24601 . 
  that photo is photoshopped .

  the station was built in 1919 , this is before brutalist and stalinist architecture . 
  yes , sweden is pretty close to becoming cashless , with stuff like swish replacing it for private transactions . 
  it 's incredibly practical on a day-to-day basis , but it 's important to remember that there is a huge potential for misuse as well as privacy issues . 
  long-term i think most countries will go more or less cashless , but i think people are way too blas\u00e9 about how vulnerable the system really is . 
  it 's not an ad hominem , it 's just a personal attack . 
  also he was obsessed with finding prophetic and hidden messages in the bible . 
  `` not carlsen ? 
  what do you mean the author spells his name karlsen ? 
  honey , put on your hiking shoes . 
  we 're going to building 3 for the k-r section . '', 
  in a literal sense , yes , but in a sense where the term is useful in a modern context , no . 
  according to this definition everyone is denying their masculinity and femininity all the time , which makes it pretty hypocritical to use as an argument for just the one side . 
  you could just as well use it to justify domestic abuse and rape .
