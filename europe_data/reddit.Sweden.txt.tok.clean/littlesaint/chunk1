well no , most of them but you can find very small unmaned stations that only have one of them , usually its just petrol . 
  i made that mistake the first month after getting my license , the car i was refuling needed diesel , and i did not think about it because only one pump existed at the station so just went for it - lucky for me we could clear it out and the car is fine but got really scared !, 
  yea . 
  well first world problems can be a pain in the ass sometimes . 
  that it really aint up to us . 
  this can easy be shown with a simple experiment when you see diffrent faces of people with diffrent ethnic background , some white , some black , hispanic etc. 
  and almost every person is more positive towards their own ethnicity . 
  this is the same thing that say that your country , family , favorite soccer team etc are better then the others . 
  its just simple biology that tells you that `` we '' are better then `` them '' and that you blame `` they '' for things that are bad . 
  we are social animals that like to be in groups and thus evolution gave us this reasoning . 
  so even tho we know its wrong its just a fact , evolution aint perfect . 
  well in this case it really aint about culture . 
  its more about biology in my mind . 
  the far right here in sweden got 10 % in this years election for the eu parlament . 
  in many other countries the far light got about 25 % . 
  so even tho our culture is against it more then others i think its just a matter of time before humans biology shines thru and they will grow even more ... 
  but all this can be fixed by education !, 
  so in the future when more people are educated i think the world will be much better , 
  you `` have '' to spend 2 % of your gdp on the military . 
  few nato countries that do that tho ... bu t that is what you should . 
  i think we ( sweden ) spend between 1-2 % now so have to increase . 
  yea i know , but thought it still would be a good idea to point out that you guys exist . 
  / r/india is not eu but they speak english . 
  well you can just show the haters your fund and they should keep quiet http://www.nbim.no/, 
  you said i was incorrect in something i never spoke about then ? 
  well then your comment really was miss placed . 
  gl in your hunt to people to find something to disagree with . 
  the next budget ? 
  haha wow . 
  if you do n't know when they propose and ratify the next budget you have a lot to learn . 
  of course the budget i showed for 2016 is not the budget for 2017 which is the next budget , please think . 
  are you slow ? 
  my : `` the dude above is talking shit '' is about the comment by : melgibsonmeinfuhrer , not you . 
  so when you say : `` but you are not correct in which figures i 'm talking about since the budget for this year is already set . '', 
  so in what way i 'm i wrong when i showed that the budget is not classified ? 
  as that was what i was showing nothing more . 
  so what numbers do you think is `` classified '' ? 
  no it 's not classified - http://www.government.se/articles/2015/11/central-government-budget-for-2016-in-figures/, 
  it 's all open , not classified . 
  the dude above is talking shit . 
  here you have the main numbers http://www.government.se/articles/2015/11/central-government-budget-for-2016-in-figures/, 
  i know where it 's . 
  why is it to close ? 
  all about keeping the boarders closed turkey - europe , but open turkey - middle east . 
  but turkey know this - thats why they have `` blackmailed '' us that they will flood europe with refugees if they do n't get that , and that and that etc. 
  that is what is happening in turkey more or less . 
  and do n't take into consideration other factors . 
  such as : every rape case gets it 's own report in sweden , so if you and i would live with each other for a year , and i feel that you have raped me twice a week , that 's over 100 times in sweden , but only 1 case in the rest of the world . 
  according to businessinsider sweden 's military is more powerful - http://uk.businessinsider.com/35-most-powerful-militaries-in-the-world-2014-7?r=us&amp;ir=t, 
  haha . 
  well english is not the only subject in school . 
  i wish english would take over swedish as the primary/native language tho . 
  you are a perfect example to show that finland have the best education system in europe !, 
  we have not closed our borders . 
  the big thing is that we have started with id checks . 
  big of a difference . 
  i 'm all for trading those for norway !, 
  ah , i my fault and you are right . 
  i misunderstood . 
  what do you mean with a national thing ? 
  the church of sweden is just a name , it 's no longer the church of sweden so to say . 
  good point . 
  guess i like to think people are n't assholes . 
  so you think it 's likely that the migrant burned down his home on purpose ? 
  this thread started with : `` hint : they 're not actually far right '' then we all started talking about if they are far right etc. 
  we where talking about sd , a swedish party . 
  not about what people are conservatives . 
  you think about it backwards and thus not part of the conversation . 
  called far-right because they are conservative . 
  easy as that . 
  yea could be the case !, 
  it 's not that grey - yet , source : looked thru my window . 
  the sun will not let us down for at least a couple of hours . 
  just his camera that made the view looked so grey and depressing . 
  no you are confusing adulthood with age of consent . 
  different things . 
  just because a 5 year old can eat food just like an adult does not make it an adult in any way . 
  you said : `` let me list what age is considered `` old enough '' '' see that you did not use the word `` adult '' for a reason . 
  i think you do n't understand english if you have come to that conclusion . 
  but here you have a clear straight to the point source for germany - http://www.howtogermany.com/faq/faq-age-majority.php so find me a better source of germany or please find atleast one country that back up your claim . 
  could you give me one example of a european country that do n't see 15 year olds as children ? 
  yea some like that . 
  interesting . 
  do n't know if it the same in sweden but would not surprise me . 
  same in sweden and most of the west . 
  he / u/geotritoni should look up the diffrence in age of consent and age of adulthood . 
  here in sweden and uk : https://www.gov.uk/age-of-criminal-responsibility you are judged as an adult in the criminal system at age 18 and above . 
  so guess the people you argued with did not google at all . 
  what country do n't label 15 year olds as children ? 
  here you have a much clearer map of it from eurobarometer : https://arnoldplaton.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/eb81-federalism.png, 
  better at losing wars vs sweden - then yes !, 
  we have something similar in sweden for small children - `` k\u00e4rlek b\u00f6rjar alltid med br\u00e5k '' - love always start with fights '', 
  not about being old or young . 
  but you seem to be too narrow-minded , at least when it comes to this . 
  and you cant accept that you hold a subjective view which only a minority holds ? 
  it is not that simple as : `` we ca n't really afford any more , wages are too high '' but more to do with the standard : supply and demand . 
  we can afford it with the high wages but most people just demand housing . 
  if you then can supply more housing as you can with modern building technics thats better from a capitalistic point of view . 
  have you never visit old town in stockholm ? 
  there is a reason it 's one of the places tourist visit .
