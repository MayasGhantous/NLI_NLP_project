  he is talking about immigrants . 
  source on that ? 
  well put !, 
  really love that you left denmark out !, 
  honorary swede . 
  like tyrion - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff_9bokibkk, 
  ireland think religion is much more important than most of europe . 
  unfurtunatly ireland do n't seem to be on this lists : http://www.gallup.com/poll/142727/religiosity-highest-world-poorest-nations.aspx but what you can do is use this good source to cross refrence many countries on this list : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/importance_of_religion_by_country and thus understand that ireland hold religion very close . 
  54 % of you think religion is important . 
  17 % of us swedes . 
  so no need to travel to ireland . 
  scientific facts and evidence are much better than subjetive experiences . 
  you do seem to follow the western trend to become less religious : `` according to the global index , only 47 percent of those surveyed in ireland said they considered themselves religious -- a 22-point drop from the 69 percent recorded in a similar 2005 poll . 
  moreover , 10 percent identified themselves as atheist . '', 
  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/28/religion-least-important-ireland-survey_n_2567990.html but you have still a long way to go . 
  edit : the source from the above quote is from page 3 here : http://www.wingia.com/web/files/news/14/file/14.pdf can use that page to compare with other countries in europe . 
  yes i thought it was higher . 
  but what i said still holds true . 
  more advanced countries have less fertility . 
  less religious countries have less fertility . 
  as you can see here for example : http://www.gallup.com/poll/142727/religiosity-highest-world-poorest-nations.aspx and i know wikipedia is not always to be trusted but you can easily cross check the above mentioned source with this following and see that it is correct . 
  you can then see that ireland hold religion as much more important than most of europe . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/importance_of_religion_by_country so i have over and over again provided facts to back up my claims . 
  all you seem to have is opinions . 
  so when will you accept facts ? 
  i know . 
  but religious cultures are more traditional . 
  more held back because of their religion when it comes to equality , education for women and so on . 
  many also get told from religious leaders that many children is a good thing . 
  i can name many more causes that exemplify the correlation between religion and many children . 
  i do understand that the most important cause is the socio economic for the culture in question . 
  but that is in itself something you can attribute to religion/traditional culture . 
  you was the one who made the false claim . 
  high fertility and high religiosity have much to do with each other . 
  but as other have stated , ireland dont have neither high religiosity nor high fertility . 
  accept facts and move on . 
  ok lets talk . 
  hope you now accept that it was the dude from ireland that made the false claim about fertility . 
  so now lets talk about high religioisity and high fertility . 
  wan na read some ? 
  http://www.pewforum.org/2015/04/02/europe/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc2723861/ https://www.jstor.org/stable/3401497?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents i can continue . 
  or your turn to show counter-evidence ? 
  you are the one who are bigoted and locked into your way of thinking . 
  so start accept facts . 
  again was u/cpt _ ballsack who made the claim with high fertility . 
  he is from ireland . 
  his claim . 
  blame him . 
  you people make me sick . 
  read the whole thread if you wan na talk . 
  dude read the whole thread . 
  i did not make the claim that ireland have high fertility , was the dude from ireland u/cpt _ ballsack people like you are the problem with forums . 
  just jump into conversations and try to stir it up . 
  yes it is very simple but you still fucked it up . 
  you wrote : `` every swedish statistic is a sign of progression and every others is a sign that they are backward . '', 
  when law of jante from your source is clearly about : `` generally used colloquially in sweden and the rest of the nordic countries as a sociological term to describe a condescending attitude towards individuality and success , the term refers to a mentality that de-emphasises individual effort and places all emphasis on the collective , while discouraging those who stand out as achievers . '', 
  so it is about me for example not expressing myself as the worlds best man , showing off what i can etc but instead pointing towards groups that do good . 
  be that unions , co-workers etc. 
  have nothing to do with nationalism that your quote is about . 
  talk about totally misunderstanding jante . 
  you should read it again in a non-biased way . 
  you do understand that i was not the one that made the claim that ireland have high fertility ? 
  i made just explained why some countries have high fertility . 
  well no . 
  just a fact what i said . 
  take is as a negative thing if you wan na up to you dude . 
  well even if many do n't believe in god the religious bit with you shall have many children culture can still be there . 
  high fertility is a sign of un-development . 
  or in your case high religiosity . 
  nothing to do with how good the country is . 
  please not that : https://www.reddit.com/r/fortsofeurope/ exist . 
  took signs from one side of the road to the other . 
  same in sweden . 
  we even import trash from norway for that reason . 
  that would make sense . 
  as skype for example was sold from a swede to americans etc. 
  thank you for the information . 
  yea that sucks ... do a company have internet monopoly over there or why is it so expensive ? 
  you ought to similar prices as us as you are as rich as we are . 
  yea that sucks . 
  here in sweden 51 euro can get you 100gb of 4g internet . 
  wrong way to look at it . 
  finland is as large as germany , but only 1/20 the population size . 
  and when you talk infrastucture the size of the country is what counts . 
  or rather population density . 
  and according to wikipedia - bad source but still , germany got a population density of 227/km2 and finland 16/km2 . 
   well the normans was something in between scandinavians and french so . 
  was something i wrote earlier . 
  you ca n't just say they was just scandinavians , nor french , something diffrent . 
  yes and ? 
  it was named so as that was the area the normen lived in , no ? 
  and belgium is not part of normandy , nor part of the area the normen before 1066 lived , no ? 
  and yes norman is very close to the swedish word to both the swedish word for people in norway , and even closer to the norwegian word for people in norway as are : norrmen . 
  normandy still exist so think it 's easier to stick to that . 
  well the normans was something in between scandinavians and french so . 
  love you for agreeing with the un !, 
  have a nice week . 
  un say western : http://www.unhcr.org/uk/484922462.pdf what source do you got ? 
  un say western : http://www.unhcr.org/uk/484922462.pdf what source do you got ? 
  greece is both eastern and southern .
