  hormones makes a lot of difference , and instincts . 
  we just do n't tend to be very aware of them . 
  you do realize `` sexism '' is not all about women and `` racism '' is not all about skin colors . 
  nah i 'd say `` islamophobic '' is worse . 
  or `` racism '' . 
  actual racism has even lost much of its meaning ... 
  which is sad . 
  it feels more of a joke or sensationalism these days , and that is making some people actual racists and having no consideration about it . 
  i do n't see a fault of criticizing the eu and all its problems , but thinking the uk could be some sort of small superpower on its own again and everything magically getting better is naive . 
  i think the uk is doing better than some other countries with how it handles immigration and all that , and by leaving you harms the economy of the other members by forcing them to write new trade treaties , which can take years . 
  and then there 's this : if the uk leaves , scotland will likely vote to remain . 
  how will this work out ? 
  one of the issues with scottish independence was its membership in various organizations like the nato , eu and so on would need to be renewed . 
  it * is * a superstate , how can you pretend it 's not ? 
  there even was plans to make a unified military at one point . 
  totalitarian ? 
  i 'd say it 's somewhat true , but not so much in any brutal fashion . 
  some say it 's neo-soviet capitalist union instead . 
  i do n't see any problem with being critical of the eu , but thinking a country will do automatically better by leaving an economic union you have been a part of since the 1950s is foolish as well . 
  no matter what happens they will be forced into agreement with the union anyway , while losing political power of the whole of it . 
  the right-wing `` populist '' parties would be smart of getting more power of the eu instead of leaving . 
  they might be enough to conquer [ v\u00e4ster\u00e5s ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/v%c3%a4ster%c3%a5s ), 
  a shame that it is that right wing parties take it . 
  but someone has to . 
  i bet they 'd fade away eventually if the immigration issue and all the problems its causing would be handled a lot better . 
  they do , but they only count if the gdp is growing or not . 
  which does n't matter for people one bit . 
   in order to not create prejudice ironically how by doing that , they create far ** more ** prejudice when the personal info is spread on alternative news sites and forums . 
  if they were more transparent about it they could have been more trustworthy too . 
  this list can also be compared to [ coffee drinkers per capita ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/coffee_consumption_map-en.svg/2000px-coffee_consumption_map-en.svg.png ) where sweden , norway and finland is the highest . 
  thing is , is hypothetically - everyone - left the eu , then who is isolated ? 
  it 's not like they would not be able to make new trade treaties , and work as well as it do for norway , iceland and switzerland . 
  economic costs from lack of a trade treaty early on regardless . 
  a `` progressive republican '' as it was known as the time . 
  turkmblr, 
  propaganda circa 1970-1980s rather . 
  in the 1930s it was n't even made illegal yet . 
  big prophet , brophet . 
  indian ethic groups go from pale white to pitch black . 
  `` stolen '' from that cesspool of originality . 
  then it would be iranians taking over , not as bad . 
   according to the un refugee agency a total of 1.008.616 refugees entered the eu is roughly 500.000.000 people . 
  a quick calculation confirms that this is about 0.2 percent of the population . 
  and almost that full million goes to germany and sweden . 
  while france , belgium , netherlands etc already has very high rates of people and people with families of immigrant background . 
  actually they went straight through , the wehrmacht was allowed to use our railways . 
  austria and sweden truly is worlds apart . 
  here the green party is completely irrational and shelters pro-islamists without questioning them ... and even supporting them when they resign !, 
  or they are way above 15 but lie about the age - so the police ca n't do anything but release them !, 
  farage bagage . 
  there is a city in texas known as paris , but yeah ... 
  55,847 [ [ 1 ] ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greenland#population ) people actually . 
  but yeah . 
  the two holiest places of islam is in saudi arabia , so would they ** not ** spread arabic globally ? 
  it 's exactly like how christianity was before the reformation and the printing of bibles into the native language for common people to read and not just priests . 
   ( e.g. 
  switzerland or australia ) have far higher numbers i think they have far higher numbers of immigrating germans etc instead . 
   all about sweden 's crumbling and swedes dug their own grave . 
  sweden 's general economy is fine , but the costs for everything from social services to so many other things is rising considerably . 
  migrants arrive from iraq and afghanistan and syria , and they all expect to live off welfare benefits just like everyone else do . 
  there is no jobs for most of them as sweden has no low-paying jobs , with high minimum wages . 
  soon enough that money will be gone , and will be forcibly cut off from them , and the amount of displeasure as seen in the 2013 riots in stockholm suburbs will be a lot more than now , unless they return home . 
  the problem with the country is not so much the economy , but the social issues that is growing , including a failing school system . 
   but what do i expect , is r/europe after all , it 's not like there 's normal debate with logical reasoning here i see mostly okay discussions here . 
  despite being more of a left-wing ( ? ), 
  pro-eu slant overall ( unlike many other places ) . 
  my country is not at all going so well as it used to , i remember when he used to have ( mostly ) decent politicians with proper leadership and not treating the country like a playground . 
  and despite not being any huge on supporting the sweden democrats , if you 're against what the main parties stands for you 're a nazi-racist-facist etc etc while they themselves can go on with the most stupid things imaginable and then go and say they were `` na\u00efve '' for doing such a thing . 
  and go on like usual again . 
  i grew up in the 90s in an immigrant area , but those days it was different . 
  there was mostly albanian and bosniaks who had fled from the balkan wars , and i was even friends with a few of them . 
  right-wing populism was relatively small , we had bert karlsson ( often made fun of as our own little donald trump ) with his `` new democracy '' anti-immigrant party , which only lasted for a few years . 
  and support for the left party was huge . 
  today i feel increasingly alienated by both the political elite , the so-called `` the establishment '' and by the 100,000 or so immigrants each year , mostly from iraq and afghanistan and other places . 
  not even more veteran immigrants that came here from iran in the 80s or the balkans in the 90s are particularly happy with all these new masses of people either . 
  some of them have actually joined the sweden democrats as they see their social-conservative political ideology to fit them better than the `` social-liberal '' ones of the left . 
  meanwhile the left is so `` open-hearted '' and `` tolerant '' that they allow hard-line islamists into their parties , or undemocratic ideas like banning the sd 'cause racism . 
  i notice in public opinion here , being `` conservative '' you 're anti-immigration , `` liberal '' you are pro immigration . 
  the debate is so toxic and polarized , where politicans and journalists openly throw excrement at each other . 
  luckily , there 's a few bloggers and people that can make things clear for me . 
  one is [ mohamed omar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mohamed_omar ) , a former shia islamist , the kurdish economist [ tino sandandaji ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tino_sanandaji ) and various others . 
  i have nothing better than google translate at the moment , but [ i can link to omar 's blog here ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=sv&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=sv&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=https%3a%2f%2fdetgodasamhallet.com%2fcategory%2fmohamed-omar%2f&amp;edit-text= ) [ and tino 's here ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=sv&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=sv&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.tino.us%2f&amp;edit-text= ) i wonder what sweden-interested in people / r/europe would think about them . 
  this was a long and rambling post . 
  thing is , the raccoon dogs arriving in finland and sweden originate from russian fur farms , who in turn originate from east asia . 
  on the other hand i heard how apathetic a mayor of the town in belgium ( molenbeek ? ), 
  where the france attackers were residents . 
  thing is , we 're doing the worse for everyone by allowing him to blackmail europe to get what he wants . 
  and he 's the worst there is with his isil support . 
  and he 's fully able to cause he 's a us and nato ally . 
  it is also easy to have an anti-immigrant agenda when your neighborhood is full of them . 
  what if the muslims do n't want to be `` integrated '' and are completely fine on their own ? 
  in their own cultural bubbles . 
  what a contrast to sweden 's green party !, 
  here we had mehmet kaplan , a muslim of turkish decent [ who recently had been seen in a private meeting with turkish far-right nationalists ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/20160416/swedish-minister-photographed-with-turkish-fascists ) and [ even got public support from erdogan himself for being `` mistreated '' over of his ethnicity or religious belief ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=sv&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=sv&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=https%3a%2f%2fwww.gp.se%2fnyheter%2fv%25c3%25a4rlden%2ferdogan-kritiserade-kaplanavg%25c3%25a5ng-1.392129&amp;edit-text= ) . 
  in 2014 he even stated that isis militants were `` no worse than voluntary swedes fighting in the finnish winter war '' !, 
   has there been a politician inviting back isis fighters ? 
  in sweden there definitely is politicians that stupid . \u00a8 a social democrat from gothenburg thought that isis fighters were `` victims '' suffering in a war and should be allowed `` refuge '' . 
  and recently-resigned green party housing minister mehmet kaplan said in 2014 that isis fighters were `` no worse than swedes fighting in the finnish winter war '' , seriously thinking they are the same as people defending a country from invaders . 
   most of the european muslims think the same . 
  source ?
