  it has taken over every other issue from public consciousness , like we do n't have problems with environmental pollution and immense corporate greed for example . 
  among the worst we 've seen yet . 
  all it 's doing is to make her supporters even more angry and upset , and rally more support for her politics . 
  that 's all there is to it . 
  it 's no so different from leftist media having sob stories about lonely/bored migrant youth , only difference is that they tend to have some integrity in those news sites compared to the right-wing press writing about mass-immigration or far-right underground news sites where witch hunts are created about anyone they assume to be an islamist or etc. 
   im not a supporter of le pen but this seems politically motivated . 
  publishing videos and images of the most brutal and disgusting murders imaginable is * also * clearly politically motivated , and done so to fuel the fire even more that is the current outrage against islamism and muslim extremism in general . 
  she could have used blurred videos and pictures if she wanted to , but just like underground far-right websites that publish everything in the clear , including names , and addressed of supposed criminals just to fuel outrage culture . 
  same is it with militant anti-abortion / `` pro-life '' activists waving signs and banners of dead babies and fetuses only to fuel their own outrage culture , and not giving a shit * where * those images originally came from . 
  it 's all emotional manipulation , which mainstream news media / `` msm '' is already a culprit of like when they published the picture of the dead turkish migrant child ( which was all due to parental neglect and * not * so much due to us evil europeans letting ** children ** die at sea ) . 
  there 's an other picture showing several journalists looking smug and taking pictures of the dead kid ... 
  it 's just a `` scoop '' for them and their papers . 
  but for the most extreme things they usually keep the images and videos blurred , and in sweden we even blur all victims names ( except for tabloid rags such as aftonbladet/expressen ) and public media wo n't even display names until much later . 
  any sensible human being would not display these things just to make people feel infuriated and sick . 
  i read an isis torture-execution of two turkish soldiers on reddit thread , where the user explained in exact detail how much these poor young men suffered in the hands of the most cruel and sadistic people imaginable . 
  it made me feel so upset and angry i ** did not know what to do ** ... and showing live videos of that exact same thing will only make people so angry and emotionally upset that they 'll vote for le pen ** just ** to hopefully ** get rid this from the world ** . 
  or they 're just so cynical that they vote for them just to spite the `` establishment '' politics . 
  all this is doing is increasing tensions between ethnic and religious groups , while letting pro-russian/alt-right politics take over europe and end up making us more like those islamists we hate . 
  instead of us being the total opposite and proving we 're better than them in every single way . 
  murderers and terrorists often are n't `` mentally ill '' but see their actions rational , and acts rational outside of the acts . 
  oddly enough . 
  i want a larger version if possible . 
  like they even care about `` terrorism '' , they just want to get what they want . 
  either it 's that , or severe ignorance . 
  le ` pen believe . 
   it 's highly unlikely that le pen will be able to win in the second round of the elections . 
  everyone said the same about brexit and trump , though . 
  one need to prepare for the worst . 
  on the other hand it 's lucky french elections are n't winner-takes-all, 
  there was n't just an armenian genocide , but also a more local one of assyrians and ... greeks . 
  mooselims . 
  i thought sweden was known for better roads than norway due to eu funding and lack of mountains , and much more flat surfaces . 
  `` islamism is literally neo-nazism !, 
  hitler himself praised islam '' they will eat it up . 
  but it 's more like they ignore they 're being similar to conservative religious and political fanatics in general . 
  i do n't see how this is surprising . 
  of course one has more of a reason to react when something happens closer to you ? 
  we 're flooded with shit happening all around the word to the point we ca n't really care anymore . 
  oh an other bombing against shia pilgrims in iraq ? 
  what can we ever possibly do about that . 
  `` use this number donate a few bucks to x charity . '', 
  people are also much more likely to ** know ** someone if it happens in a western nation . 
  or how the news reports `` no americans are known to have died '' when a disaster happens in other countries . 
  i know a lot of people all around europe and america , but i ca n't say i know really know any from south america , and none from africa or china . 
  trump has been king for just a few months , give it time and i 'm sure there will be more cases of torture , crack down on media and unions , internet censorship and not to say a large-scale deregulation on environmental policies . 
  vodka is sometimes made of grain instead of potato . 
  what revisionism ? 
  stupid american `` grandmas '' might say `` look that proves moslems are nazis !!! '', 
  but that equally means that nazis are very much like ( radical ) muslims . 
  hitler himself admired islam , considering it more `` germanic '' in the traits vs christianity . 
  the islamic conquests in 600-700 ad was likely an other inspiration for invading europe . 
  the nazis funded bosnian and serb muslims , and thought them to hate jews . 
  many also praised hitler for standing up to british/french colonial hegemony , and saw them as saviors . 
  today they are more or less trying to hide that they are for many of the same things as in patriarchal , conservative , traditional religious societies . 
  they still see themselves as superior in a lot of ways but they also want to be more like them . 
  i do n't think trump would even have a presidential pet , that endless bore . 
  no it was napoleon lincoln, 
  not in most of the world ... 
  i seem to remember `` datten '' only somewhat , and it 's in my area . 
  but `` spela kull '' or `` tafatt '' is ** a lot ** more recognizable to me , and i 've been in the dark green/orange stripe area for most of my life . 
  so i 'm not sure about the accuracy of this map . 
  with appropriate sauce and spices , then maybe . 
  you never had fried calimari , have you ... 
  home malloch 4 : home alonier . 
  macaulay culkin stars as malloch . 
  they have been doing this before , for 20 years . 
  ketchup on pasta ? 
  more like cat soup on pasta !, 
  can anyone explain why the toes of that statue are so short ? 
  i recal reading something about the nutrition in the ancient times or what it was and why people had these short toes . 
  [ oh this may just be the thing that explains it . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/morton's_toe ), 
  radioactive moussaka ? 
  make amphibians straight again, 
  is n't it more like a shortage of skilled police ? 
  just add more random police droogs would not make things better . 
  and the police are often afraid to deal with people of migrant groups so to not get a `` bad name '' . 
  and the spanish ( ! ), 
  `` racist '' is such a extremely loaded term . 
  just proposing that racial differences exist is sort of racist itself , but that does n't mean it 's necessarily `` bad '' . 
  is n't there just one human race ? 
  but people can and will feel like they are superior to other people with different ethnic groups , hobbies , mental disorders , language , weight , `` iq '' , and so on . 
  possibly not quite as it seems , i 'm not sure where they originate from in context . 
  still weird though, 
  i 'm not sure it 's as dramatic as `` million starving to death '' but it definitely is disproportionate . 
  so little money is needed to help people from starvation and with basic hygiene , and so much is needed to keep people in apartments with all the benefits such as internet connection , tv , school , health care , and so on . 
  i dunno , there was this swedish report where some people said we 'd * earn * `` hundreds of billions of dollars '' with the current immigration system . 
  while the sweden democrats claim we 're * losing * `` hundred of billions of dollars '' . 
  ca n't trust either of them at all . 
  http://www.dn.se/ekonomi/invandringens-vinst-900-miljarder/ either be super duper positive happy , `` sweden stronk !, 
  or yell and rage about `` sweden is the fucking worst , a communist/feminist/islamist hellscape ! '', 
  destroying anything ancient is among the worst crimes one can make . 
  as ancient buildings or ancient trees will last and be enjoyed and learned from by generations . 
  and when it 's lost it 's easy to be lost forever . 
  or [ china banning all coal imports from north korea ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/5uuwo8/china_bans_all_coal_imports_from_north_korea/ ) the chinese government , just like putin , are both losing patience with their age-old buffer state allies . 
  north korea is to china as belarus is to russia , both small states ruled by a dynasty ( if it would be possible for lukashenko 's son to take over after him ) and both have a lack of free market capitalism like in old communist states , where the biggest employer is the state by a wide margin . 
  belarus sometimes threatens to get closer to the eu for aid and sanctions lifted . 
  north korea made missile tests only to later ask for aid from the west , by promising to deaccelerate missile/nuclear development . 
  main difference is probably there 's no famines or mass-starvation in belarus , and private enterprise is allowed if you 're able to . 
  spain and czechia is like `` 0.0 whoops '',
