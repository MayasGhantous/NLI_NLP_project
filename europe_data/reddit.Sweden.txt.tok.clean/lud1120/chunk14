   russia = `` people who row ( boats ) '' that works well with the theory that russia got its name from the rus ' tribes , which in turn got the name from roslagen in sweden . 
  it 's just reddit 's bot algorithm picking up an image it thinks makes sense for the submissions , sometimes it fails spectacularly . 
   he 's lead ukip for 20 years did n't realize they 'd been around for so long ... and not a single one would vote for them back then . 
  same with other groups such as sweden democrats that nobody voted for due to them still being a neo-nazi party , until a decade ago when they got the first few percentages . 
  the far-right have a ton of things they can parade themselves with thanks to everyone 's just concern about terrorism and immigration ... 
  they and some other conservatives may be the downfall of europe as we know it , but i also blame much of the left for not doing too much , being too centric and not focusing on the real issues enough . 
  may seem to be pretty much the same , against brexit at first ( less trade is always bad for the economy ) then all pro-brexit and pretending it 's a good deal for the uk . 
  i 'd wager sweden has been just as much , if not more cause of this than germany . 
  at least they have some form of plan with the integration and stuff . 
  spontaneous attacks like that are harder to keep track of , compared to organized large-scale ones . 
  they would have to remove themselves at that point ... and perhaps only have middle easterners and asians left . 
  what `` pathogens '' would not be removed by proper cooking anyway ? 
  trump winning was a surprise to most , i kept reading on reddit that trump winning was `` unlikely '' . 
   they literally promote political correctness while arguing against it . 
  the cognitive dissonance is just too much . 
  it is impossible to connect with these people at any level . 
  similarly they hate on muslims for being sexist and violent , when they appear to be ok with whites being sexist and fascist . 
  one can still be racist and not hate blacks and other minorities . 
  it 's not an absolute . 
  they are still misguided and often dumb . 
  yeah norway , denmark and finland are such regressive leftist states . 
  / s they are doing pretty good on their own !, 
   call them racists , call them idiots that is only because `` racist '' and `` idiot '' are such strongly loaded terms , when it should be more neutral . 
  people need to be able to handle criticism , but they have often low confidence to begin with . 
  it 's not so much the papers having agendas but the journalists having their own views and biases . 
  does n't make them proper journalists most of the time , they are often well-educated and all that , but they are still biased . 
  lol how they call themselvse `` nationalists '' . 
  like how all the nazi collaborators called them nationalist by giving up themselves to german hegemony , we are now giving up to american and russian rule . 
  on the other hand immigration going out of hand is also not really good for anyone , but that 's the main reason we have so much far-right support in the west . 
  the problem is , we do n't idolize the kings so much in general and we certainly are allowed to criticize them openly without getting assaulted . 
  muhammad and his followers are simply the only clear `` proof '' they have of an all-knowing , all-powerful god existing . 
   erdo\u011fan is a turkish name meaning `` who is born as a brave man , soldier or warrior '' or `` brave , warrior hawk '', 
  what is this ? 
  except they are racist , homophobes , transphobes ... 
  it 's just not the most intelligent way to counter opponents by calling them things . 
  '' ( ( ( soros ) ) ) '' probably, 
  it 's black & white magic . 
   it 's a pro-american ( and therefore pro-uk ) um no , i keep hearing a ton of criticism of the usa , its ' just never allowed to be about the usa there even when it should be deemed world news . 
  and then we have / r/news that is agressively moderated but is about mostly usa news but also global . 
   the usa , 1776 i wonder how much calories and fat there is in this dish . 
  head of estate . 
  [ apparently yes . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/4nbz0k/i_am_pulitzer_prizewinning_reporter_michael/d42l0bt/ ), 
  and what when various right-wing euroskeptic parties take over each country ? 
   but it 's unfair to let the us pay so much for defending europe . 
  meanwhile trump said something about * doubling * the already huge defense budget ... that administration is really extreme on the spending when it used to be such a sin to spend . 
  obama was pretty popular in russia in the beginning too , as he warmed the relations between the countries after being frozen solid during the bush era . 
  oddly now the usa 's enemy is their best friend ... 
  the one to the right is communist , clearly . 
  both are from the same world 's fair . 
  it 's like the soviet union and hitler bombed france together and built this . 
  i do n't see why there would be wars between european countries just like that , unless there 'd be an expansionist fascist regime like nazi germany ... 
  but that takes a gigantic defense budget rivaling china at least . 
  a divide would harm the economy greatly though , and make us all weaker against chinese market colonialism by buying up more firms and of course russia - but they want them to be stronger . 
  all that shit that has happened to france and belgium lately it would not surprise me if she took over . 
  that golden door made me think they were at the kremlin for a moment ... 
  hey now , trump is the first orange president ... 
  at least hillary believes in science despite not understanding much about it or technology , that 's the saddest thing about all of this : anti-environmental thinking . 
  i could give zero shits about refugees , religions or all that as long as we still have a planet to live in . 
  but having higher education is only a `` liberal-elitist '' thing so ... 
  considering how far to the right america is today , a little bit of actual socialism would only be a good thing . 
  but no , state-funded health care is evil commienazism by us standards . 
  hillary was just a fairly ordinary , standard liberal-conservative by european standards . 
   `` slam '' or islam . 
  just a disclaimer that `` din do nuffin ' '' is often used by racists against claims that black people never committed violence . 
  but i bet it 's just a `` meme '' now just like '' ( ( ( ) ) ) '' and the antisemitic alt-right . 
  meanwhile nobody gives a single fuck about prosecuting george w. bush or dick cheney for sending 60,000 americans to their deaths and wasting trillions of dollars on a fucking stupid iraqi war that only made iran a lot stronger in the process . 
  not to say indirectly giving the rise of isis . 
  not so easy to learn for immigrants though . 
  maybe not allow them in to the country to begin with if they wear nothing but full-body covering ? 
  at least give them information about what rules we have . 
  yeah and giving them a massive fan would * totally * deter such extreme ideology , like actual religious terrorists give a damn about money . 
  speeding can actually harm people , even kill . 
  would full-covered clothing kill ? 
  not unless they are known to hide bombs within burqas , and so far that has not happened in europe afaik . 
  at least let the husband pay for it , as we all say it 's degenerate middle eastern traditions where they repress women . 
   a big fine to make a point seams appropriate . 
  a `` big fine '' would be 300 $ , give or take . 
  and i would even be fine with that . 
  not freaking 30,000 $ ?? 
  dogs also have a remarkable flexible gene pool for that . 
  it simply would not be possible with cats . 
  people have bred cats for thousands of years too , look at siamese cats , persian cat , or norwegian forest cat . 
  yet at the same time italy has avoided most terrorism in recent decades , after extensive experience with the mafia organizations and leftist terrorism . 
  people can still have those views and yet not vote for afd as that party has been a dumpster fire , and that 's what 's more relevant here . 
  glad i only buy eggs from my own country , specifically from a local company that sells brown-shelled eggs with golden deep-yellow yolk . 
  of course conservative papers are biased about immigration , socialism/communism , islam ( criticizing other religions openly but still supporting saudi arabia without telling anyone directly ) . 
  while left-wing papers are biased towards the environment , human rights , and more . 
  it 's both for good and bad . 
  he 'd also be supporting iran which everyone on reddit seems to support , despite being a islamic theocracy , just not a direct enemy to us westerners in reality compared our business partner saudi arabia . 
  russia has large wheat fields . 
  oil may end up being a scare and value resource in the future again , but unlikely as fuel . 
  so they better keep it . 
  [ transnistria ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transnistria ) is a weird case . 
  apropos the balkans : montenegro was apparently made independent after [ a leader there used it as a way to escape prosecution ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/milo_%c4%90ukanovi%c4%87#criminal_investigation_in_italy ) . 
  someone else here wrote about it a while ago . 
  [ the syrian government under assad are `` not entirely opposed '' to federalization of syria ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federalization_of_syria ), 
  also words such as `` fascist '' , or even `` terrorist '' . 
  they want us to hate muslims in general so they can have their final war between the west and the islamic world . 
  now the `` isis '' group is dead but more will spawn in the future .
