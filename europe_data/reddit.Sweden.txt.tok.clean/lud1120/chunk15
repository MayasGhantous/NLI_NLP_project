  `` god is greater/greatest '' is the best excuse they know to act violent . 
  as god is bigger than anything that happens on this planet ... 
  creepy . 
  leak is cringing . 
  the parades are never in areas where they are needed the most . 
  stockholm pride is just a festival that is accepted and liked by most people . 
  amsterdam the same . 
  if it 's about gay acceptance , they should be held in more conservative areas , but would be voted down likely . 
  they turn french people gay ? 
  actually more . 
  cringe , clench , nobody know what word to use . 
  `` slightly awkward people talking in a video = le cring '', 
  hitler would not agree on the view on devout and racially pure muslims, 
  excuses like `` it 's just a prank , bro ! '', 
  or `` it 's just a joke calm down ffs '' is not an absolute . 
  on has a right to criticize jokes . 
  i 'd still avoid paris , for multiple reasons . 
  sad what they did to other places such as nice as well but i find it remarkable how france has not been turned into hatred and fear just like the terrorists wanted . 
  it 's hard to screen so many people when there 's millions coming in and out of the country . 
  or would you want it to be like in the usa with tsa body scanners and search through your entire body , and put in a room and questioned . 
  and russians hear about stalin , except there 's a lot of revisionism going on , not just the modern communist party of the russian federation being pro-stalin but also the united russia party . 
   britain did n't change their flag after decolonisation . 
  the uk flag is made up of scotland , wales and england . 
  and both are still in a union and will remain for a while .

  belarus is a duck, 
  that really depends ... 
  your face completely mutilated , or several knife wounds or gunshot wounds to the body ? 
  to people in china and korea , especially older people , the imperial japanese flag ignites a lot of anger . 
  thailand , india , not so much . 
   tunisia is likely the single most advanced country in the arab world as far as democracy and rule of law is concerned , i 'd say lebanon instead , and maybe jordan but that country has very high rates of shariah law supporters outside of the royal family . 
  it 's tunisia , but yes , morocco would be a safer bet . 
  they are very close to spain . 
  i wonder why croatia ended up with all the coastline , leaving serbia landlocked . 
  in sweden we also had a lot , and still have some terrible `` architects '' working for the government to design massive apartment complexes . 
  why do they need the wood there anyway ? 
  no , they do n't need it . 
  they claim its due to a beetle outbreak ... 
  i have no idea the intention about this . 
   kapsalon has a high energy content , with each serving containing approximately 7500 kj , but apart from the high-gl fries , low in carbohydrates and hence glycemic load ( gl ), 
  or what happened in swaziland last night . 
  g\u00fclen obviously . 
  lol `` blesk '' sounds like `` blaska '' which is a swedish word for a newspaper rag . 
  this man or boris johnson . 
  different poisons for different diets it seems . 
  why should he do that , hes just a humble bus driver . 
  your post is like saying `` how can yo criticize the soviet union 's dictators ? 
  they had brutal emperors , oligarchs , and slavery before them ! '', 
  it 's all very similar . 
  first have an impoverished and poorly-educated masses that are easy to rally for a revolution where some new autocrats take over , that is seen as better than the old autocrats . 
  also : [ 50 % of the population of venezuela are mixed race ( mestizo ) , 40 % white and only 3 % black ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/venezuela#ethnic_groups ) great to start out about it kind of apartheid/slavery issue when it has nothing to do with it . 
  da vinci was cool , though . 
  not just the mona lisa painter . 
  i 'm just seeing it now ... are they posing with a dead dog , really ?!, 
  or just tired and old . 
  or `` public morals '' . 
  ceta instead of feta, 
  or maaaybe ... 
  it was named after the actual crime that is known as a `` grand theft auto '' ( carjacking ) ffs . 
  same thing is done once a year in israel as a reminder of the holocaust . 
  i have a russian friend who had to go through a week without food and barely any sleep due to not getting paid . 
  it would be hard for him to not blame the sanctions at least partially . 
  not just polish history , but the world !, 
  well , at least in the entirety of europe 's history . 
  [ snopes has this to say ] ( http://www.snopes.com/mike-pence-supported-gay-conversion-therapy/ ) while snopes is not so reliable as it used to be , it 's better than nothing . 
  there 's nothing that says that he * would n't * be able to replace mr t. 
  thank you . 
  most of the facilities built for the 2012 london olympics are also abandoned .

   paid for mostly by donations and by the city of leipzig , it was completed in 1913 for the 100th anniversary of the battle , at a cost of 6 million goldmark . 
  anyone know how much that is now in ( likely ) billions ? 
  this is about newspaper * circulation * , as hardly anyone read physical papers anymore , it 's ** not ** about amount of visits online , where many of these are still very popular , and upvoted to the top on reddit all the time . 
  hard to find are more gaulish mustache . 
   the perpetrator was the son-in-law of the person running the night club there 's a clear potential motive . 
  nothing about this known to be anything about terrorism yet , though . 
  it could just be , you know , any sort of shooting that happens in the world . 
  i remember some kosovo albanian and possibly bosniak neighbor kids i had . 
  they kept eating sunflower seeds and shells were all over the stairwell . 
  i thought that was just something part of their culture , instead of being an eastern european thing . 
  well , that makes the whole brexit thing even more pointless . 
  except they had friendly relations with some neighboring nations , such as ancient egypt . 
  they both had mutual desire for resources from each country though . 
  yes . 
  even if they did all that i still would not trust them . 
  we 've admitted so many countries due to shallow or even shady grounds . 
   the entire european union the eu is not responsible for immigration , passports , citizenship , visas and so on . 
  i wish they were . 
  if the eu had an united immigration policy there would be a lot less problems if done right and proper , but many members would veto such efforts . 
  we could have our very own `` ellis island '' to process the huge amounts of people at a single place . 
  it really makes me question why we have eastern european members that do not want to be like us , and have massive issues with the regulations of things , and governments there expecting the eu to `` fix '' all these problems , or southern european members that are jealous of members in the north . 
  with the uk out we 'll at least have proper banking regulations this time , which they kept making a veto on . 
  really freaking dumb for them , and the eu is losing a whole lot of money they paid which made it possible to make membership more affordable for others such as sweden , which will further anti-eu opinions up here too . 
  ** besides , deportation is a very expensive and complicated thing to do . 
  this is why it 's rarely done . 
  ** first you need to hire police to capture the person ( s ) , then pay for a private jet to deliver to a country , drugs may be needed to calm the person down , and even more personnel to deliver him safely . 
  and more likely than not the person has already gone under hiding after being sent the letter telling him of his or her impending deportation , which is what we do here , and when the person is hiding he 's more likely to radicalize or make a suicide-by-cop attempt . 
  deportation is much more suited for high-profile cases , not random migrants . 
  the main problems with immigration and integration is due to countries own policies , but yet people blame it all on the eu instead . 
   - told to get out both of attacks in sweden , the ikea knife attacker from eritrea , and the central asian who ran over pedestrians in stockholm , had been told to leave the country , and instead they plot and do this kind of thing for `` revenge '' against the population here . 
  `` local crime '' ... everything noteworthy that happens in europe and ends up in mainstream media sources is related to europe .
