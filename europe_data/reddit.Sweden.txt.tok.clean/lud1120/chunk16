  unless it 's petty crimes such as theft . 
  not good for your lungs to breath in that though . 
  `` growth '' is not the most important thing in the world . 
  especially not then most of that money gets wasted by wasteful or corrupt politicians . 
  one can have low gdp growth and have a stable country , or very high growth yet high inequality . 
  it 's been almost 30 years since the fall of the iron curtain . 
  it 's like calling germany `` ex-nazi '' in the late 1970s, 
  they do , until they turn into arch rivals . 
  see : hitler and stalin with the molotov-ribbentrop pact . 
  more interested in that beautiful mountain than the 19th century romantic kitsch castle , which is fine by itself , but not particularly interesting to me . 
  edit : sorry , `` palace '' . 
  in swedish it 's ( slott ) `` palace '' or ( borg ) `` castle '' . 
  i wonder when erdo\u011fan will buy a giant cannon from a [ hungarian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/orban ) and use it to lay siege to a [ european capital city ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fall_of_constantinople ) . 
  looks like a hybrid between european and middle eastern architecture . 
  but i thought the eu sanctions had a much larger effect on russia , due to trade with them . 
  the us does to have much trade with hem so it matters a whole lot less to them . 
  axis of moderate good , or lukewarm evil depending how one sees it . 
  the methods and brutality in any kind of attack matters a lot too . 
  `` aryan '' ... that is , an antiquated term for indo-iranian origin theory for indo-europeans . 
  people do n't seem to recall this . 
  i 'm sure a lot in eastern europe , middle east , and asia could claim to be . 
  an european `` ellis island '' where everyone reaching europe will be sent to be ` processed ' , i think would be the best for us . 
  many smaller and weaker countries that ca n't deal with them , many bigger ones that can but not without issues there too . 
  real refugees not getting what they deserve , especially when reaching more conservative countries , and economic migrants abusing liberal and accepting countries for their own good , at the expense of everyone else . 
  there has been migrants from morocco pretending to be syrian for example , or pretending to be below 18 to get free pass in sweden . 
  meanwhile we also deport people who have lived here for decades , due to very minor crimes such as not paying tax . 
  we 're both tolerant and intolerant at the same time . 
  i do n't hate people normally , but i will still criticize them . 
  ultra-capitalists ... 
  if they were they 'd be able to earn money from drug liberalization , lgbt rights , euthanasia , environmental protection in the long term . 
  i need a ... [ temporary secretary ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehqkppmvck4 ), 
  that comment looked sarcastic to me ... 
  and vice-versa . 
  just like every fandom or hobby with rivalry . 
  he used to be a close ally to erdo\u011fan before they turned enemies . 
  erdo\u011fan scares me a lot more by sure , he wants to be seen as a caliph for muslims to follow and not just a cleric . 
  and turkey being opposed to migrants ... ? 
  they have millions on their soil . 
  this is is all confusing . 
  fire clowns !, 
  fuck no, 
  i wonder why companies do n't outsource production to portugal and greece when labor is still so cheap there ... 
  but not cheap ** enough ** to them !, 
  there used to be clothing factories there instead of cambodia and bangladesh , and it would help the struggling economies in the eu . 
  it took the soviet union almost 100 years though . 
  it all depends if they can make sure the economy is growing and most of the people satisfied . 
  it 's erdo\u011fan talking about the anniversary of the 15 june `` coup '' ... and here you hear him when you open the fridge and shelves . 
  on erdo\u011fan 's wiki page :  you would n't believe the things they have said about me . 
  they have said i am georgian ... forgive me for saying this ... ** even much uglier things , they have even called me an armenian ** , but i am turkish . '', 
  funnily ... fethullah g\u00fclen was a close ally to erdo\u011fan just a few years ago . 
  just like the character [ emmanuel goldstein ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/emmanuel_goldstein ) was a former top member of `` the party '' in the novel , and an early associate of its leader . 
  mostly in austin iirc . 
  but we can diminish the effects of it . 
  csi : [ mioveni ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mioveni ), 
  higgins looks like he could be cast as the role of bilbo baggins . 
  fuck that shit . 
  pabst blue ribbon ! '', 
  getting ? 
  it 's been a farce for years . 
  gaudy gaudi cathedral . 
  ... something about the state controlling the 2 holiest shrines in islam , where millions of pilgrims visit each year . 
  criticizing the state and you criticize most of the muslim world in the perspective of people . 
  egypt , uae , turkey , everyone is more or less a strong ally of them , except shia iran and iraq . 
  liberal free-thinkers , atheists , and people of non-abrahamic faiths are not respected at all in the arab nations . 
  i like the door . 
  is he ( george ) * winking * at putin ?!, 
  and i remember now merkel kinda enjoying the company of bush ? 
  so the catholic and orthodox split is more akin to the sunni and shia muslim split . 
   the late michael nykvist . 
  so would not islamist violence be considered extreme right ? 
  why exclude some groups over others . 
  he might have gone too far in a few places , but we can diminish the effects of it . 
  i made [ a similar post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6lx8jx/heroes_of_europe_raoul_wallenberg_swedish/ ) about [ raoul wallenberg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/raoul_wallenberg ) and it was `` flagged as spam '' . 
  pff . 
  edelstam is lesser-known , though . 
  lol , / r/europe is one of the most europe and eu loving places on the internet , but they usually are n't stupid about it . 
  posting assholes from the past , while mostly irrelevant to today are still important to remember . 
  belgium , spain , uk and germany did different kinds of awful . 
  when a youtuber have `` trumplover no 1 '' it 's probably a joke-troll , but on reddit they are often serious and nobody seems to see what name they post stuff with . 
  one ca n't really be a `` euro-nationalist '' when they continent is too damn diverse and varied amount of people , traditions , cultures , and so on though . 
  `` white '' people is highly arbitrary line to draw . 
   people do n't eat much meat in poorer regions but turkey is not a particularly poor nation ? 
  at least not in the main cities . 
  countryside i can understand . 
  if sweden and finland was as rich as they are they 'd be capable of the exact same . 
  except neither finland or sweden gives a shit about the last few percentage of actually virgin forests left that are worth preserving . 
  a lot of different private owners selling it off . 
  most `` forests '' are just spruce and pine plantations of varying quality , pine forests tend to be nice enough to wander through and pick berries and mushrooms . 
   thousands not enough to make any difference . 
  [ `` the lipstick '' in gothenburg , sweden ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/skanskaskrapan_september_2014_03.jpg ) and even this one is far from the worst , just all over the place . 
  i see you follow on the infowars/alex jones memes ... 
  but only the french can be called frogs . 
  they deserve brain-drain at this point . 
  except cities such as new york has very low violent crime related to the size , and tokyo is pretty much non-existent and what exists is likely hidden from public knowledge . 
  they do ? 
  or do you mean sugar ? 
  i do n't think he actually supports sanctions against russia , but he pretends to now to not be seen as such a puppet . 
  no tea or egg & bacon for the uk ? 
  shame . 
  so ... mustard and brussels sprouts that give you nasty flatulence .
