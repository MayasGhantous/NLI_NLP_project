  it 's different types of dumb . 
  religion is not the only thing and usually has little to do with intelligence ... 
  except those that go by books 100 % no question . 
  but that is the same with any other book with supposed meaning in existence . 
  the country has devolved into an actual turkey . 
  by turkeys and for turkeys . 
   muslim massacre , bomb gaza two of those are not like the others . 
  never heard of those two , but by the titles alone i can understand the ban ... 
  but guitar hero , pac-man ... ? 
  source ? 
  that is absolutely horrifying . 
  i 've only heard this happen in india and russia , not the * uk * !, 
  edit : [ it also happened to a former model in italy . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-40393426 ), 
  if it was a strictly constitutional monarchy and not make them richer than a president , then sure . 
  i can only expect new `` real ira '' and `` provisional ira '' attacks in the near future , those that rejected the peace deal . 
  this deal should make anyone who remembers the troubles have their blood boil , though . 
  swedish : information machine ( datamaskin ) is an older term for dator ( computer ) . 
  ground ball = jordklot = earth iron road = j\u00e4rnv\u00e4g = rails nose horn = nosh\u00f6rning = rhino flight machine = flygmaskin ( old term ) , today flygplan ( airplane ) . 
  so flight plane, 
  same with sweden , but probably even less here . 
  both countries have immense amounts of `` forests '' but relatively little is anything but spruce or pine plantations . 
  at least the pine forests are decent enough to walk around and pick mushrooms and berries , but anything else is boring and there 's very little deciduous forests . 
  i think finland has a system where they attempt to encourage forest owners to conserve , to mixed results . 
   damage : a light pole . 
  and a small tree !, 
  i blame it on banana peels . 
  we call them `` french hot dog '' in sweden , and the buns are filled with * white sauce * for extra sexual undertones . 
  they could do it at the [ bikini atoll ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bikini_atoll ) and use the [ bikini state ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bikini_state ) for the safety alerts at the plant . 
  chocolate pain, 
  people would steal eggs from wild birds or farm waterfowl , they must absolutely have known how eggs looked from the inside before mirrors were invented . 
  tjej = `` older girl/younger woman '' is also a romani loan word . 
  `` flicka '' i mostly hear older adult people say , apart from `` young girl '' . 
  `` kvinna '' and queen have the same etymology , too . 
  dog '' s\u00e4l = seal toalettlock = toilet lock/cover sm\u00f6rg\u00e5s = `` butter geese '' ( toast/sandwich ) \u00c4ppelskrutt = `` apple junk/trash '' jordn\u00f6tssm\u00f6r = `` peanut butter '' tv\u00e4ttbj\u00f6rn = `` wash bear '' \u00c4gg = egg potatis = potato, 
  * dependence day, 
  he 's also intermarried into the kennedy family . 
  grand moff tankk1n, 
  many former scientologists kept being harassed by their agents and pictures taken of them in private and other threats . 
  it 's no pretty affair . 
  in winter you 'd say the opposite ... 
  did n't a few dozen polish poor die in the cold after russia cut gas to ukraine a while back ? 
  afraid of breaking the rules when she 's meant to have no opinion . 
  but now with how much of a shit show the world seems to be , she changed her mind enough to use this hat as a symbolic statement . 
  even if `` dressed down '' this kind of grand ceremonial spectacle in bizarre for most europeans . 
  `` daily morning '' ) is a turkish pro-government [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] daily published in turkey . 
   daily sabah has frequently been called a propaganda outlet for the turkish government and the ruling justice and development party ( akp ) . 
  [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 8 ]  ** criticism ** ** promoting conspiracy theories **  the daily sabah has seen particular criticism for promotion of the `` mastermind '' conspiracy theory coined by recep tayyip erdo\u011fan , according to which an alleged command and control institution , somewhat ambiguously placed with the government of the united states , in a comprehensive conspiracy to weaken or even dismember turkey allegedly orchestrates multiple political actors perceived hostile by turkey -- like the salafi jihadist islamic state of iraq and the levant ( isil ) , the anarcho-marxist kurdistan workers ' party ( pkk ) and the islamist cult with political ambitions around fethullah g\u00fclen -- to attack turkey in a well-coordinated campaign . 
  [ 13 ]  ** spreading hate ** in march 2017 , after investigating complaints that the daily sabah would pursue an editorial agenda of `` spreading hate '' , the president of the european parliament banned the distribution of the paper at parliament . 
  born in iran . 
  homosexuality was the same crime as sodomy until the early 20th century , so any `` unnatural '' forms of intercourse . 
  when sweden decriminalized sodomy it was the same for both same-sex and interspecies . 
  how about having an [ elective monarchy ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elective_monarchy ) polish-lithuanian commonwealth had it at one point . 
  left-wing is n't always progressive and right-wing is n't always conservative . 
  female circumcision is looked down upon a lot more , usually known as female genital mutilation ( fgm ) . 
  [ apropos nothing , a certain ufo cult ( raelianism ) of all things , are strong advocates against both female and male circumcision ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/clitoraid ), 
   imagine not having to individually develop the leclerc , leopard , ariete and that tank looking space hussar that the polish call pl-01 but that 's where most innovation comes from ... from national development and research . 
  it 's like if you 'd move all californian it firms to washington dc . 
   but i am not sure when we will see red . 
  if the economy tanks due to brexit and living standards fall significantly . 
   i think the guy was white . 
  you really do n't think there 's white islamists that could do this just to increase the tensions in society . 
   attack to attract attention and garner fame . 
  which can either be for induviduals , or specific * groups * e.g `` isis claims the attack '' so they commit these acts to `` honor '' a group , put more fear into the name . 
   actually a ton of people seemed to have qualms with that . 
  dylann roof was n't trialed as a terrorist , his actions were labeled officially as a ` hate crime ' . 
  that is because in us law , there does n't appear to be such thing as `` domestic terrorism '' , one is only prosecuted for terror if one is confirmed to have been a part of or inspired by a * foreign * terrorist group/enemy combatant . 
  i bet it 's a remnant of the cold war where us citizens demanded to be free to join communist parties or etc , and be told apart buy authorities from soviet spies in court . 
  this is just what groups such as isis wants to happen . 
  to rip apart western society from within , by creating rifts between people . 
  and merry , and dandy . 
  not sure what war-crimes mccain did , if any , but * dick cheney * and * kissinger * should probably be there . 
  japan has better ( green ) teas . 
   [ koosh ball ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/koosh_ball ) suddenly nostalgia !, 
  the rest of stuff i remember here is just monopoly ( sigh ) , lego ( !!!, 
  ) , hula hoop , play-doh ( !!, 
  ) , and star wars figurines . 
  unrelated , but there was a gunsmith named [ orban ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/orban ) who sold his cannons to the ottomans after the byzantines did n't have the funds for it . 
  seems like viktor orban would do the same for hungary , sell it out to russians , possibly turks and anyone in the middle . 
  and people tend to respect old people , knowing they 're frail and she 's an important symbol for the country ( and commonwealth ) as well . 
  i guess he was a bit ... astray !, 
  i 'll show myself out . 
  i think a short term of 3-4 years max but infinitely renewable would be the best . 
  4 sounds too much compared to 3 . 
  new zealand has 3-year terms . 
  people 's perception of politics can change wildly after a few years , so let them vote often and change often , unless they are still mostly happy with the current leadership so one can rule up to 30 years or more . 
  not sure how `` liberal '' the media in serbia is : v, 
  oasis, 
  tfw germany still is a nazi stereotype even on a parody ... ukraine = cia puppet !, 
  sweden = swedistan !, 
  and then finland ... 
  soviet ?!, 
  gay ? 
  neither of those are common stereotypes or right-wing memes . 
  or even left-wig ones . 
  use ublock origin . 
  works for me . 
  so he may very well have been a die-hard soviet union supporter from 1931 to 1954 . 
  then two years later he seems to have changed his views radically :  the facts about sartre are these : he attacked the soviet invasion of hungary in 1956 , supported israel when it was denounced by soviet propaganda after the 1967 war and in the 70 's expressed nothing short of the most '' solid '' contempt and hatred for the russian and french communist parties .
