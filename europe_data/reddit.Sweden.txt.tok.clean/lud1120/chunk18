   http://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/29/books/l-was-sartre-a-stalinist-718387.html [ / u/huyuyuyuyuyu ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6hdcqi/oliver_stone_has_launched_putins_reelection/dixiwsz/ ) not sure if he just changed to have `` mainstream '' views or if was really honest . 
   jean paul sartre after his travel to soviet union in 1954 all of what / u/huyuyuyuyuyu posted was said later . 
  so he criticized them just 2 years later and in the 1970s and 1980s he kept criticizing the soviet union . 
  your point ? 
  not sure if he was sincere about it , though . 
  bettersuffertogether, 
  spain is in pain . 
   greatest hit for pirating of games were humble bundles and steam sales . 
  but i see a lot less good deals now than just a few years ago ... 
  rarely something overwhelmingly positive for a few bucks . 
  irish krauts instead of german krauts !, 
  is that macron ? 
  edit : i did a stupid . 
  the joke is bad and you should feel bad . 
  the iron head and bucket lady . 
  [ also did sweden at one point in time . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sweden_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction ), 
   the lizard people the * dino * people . 
  totally lame censorship . 
  the usa is capitalist alright - but only in creating monopolies , not helping competition or smaller business . 
  after article 50 has been triggered , there 's no way going back . 
  `` i say fuck you old chap '', 
  obama 2.0 ? 
  but then two years into his first term he ( obama ) got cock-blocked by republicans in congess . 
  the coptic christians were already treated like dirt under the 30 years of hosni mubarak . 
  and now with el-sisi they have the same type of ideology again . 
  [ gnats ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gnat ) are very common in the northern hemisphere . 
  it made headlines back in 2003 that saddam upheld strict sharia law in his country , such as a child getting his hand severed off as a punishment for stealing . 
  [ and he did order a personal quran written in his own blood that he donated over many years . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blood_quran ) many former supporters of his regime later worked for groups such as isil . 
  left , ( lower and middle class people ) turning right ( ukip ) then going back to vote for labour or conservative again . 
  iran is an actual country with a rich history stemming thousands of years . 
  same with babylon ( iraq 's borders is n't quite that ) and syria . 
  arabia is just mecca and medina and the birth place of prophet mohammed , and a bunch of conservative tribes that turned rich after they allied themselves with the brits and french against ottoman turkish dominion of the peninsula during ww1 . 
  we can try to be more neutral at least . 
  * neither * should be a friend . 
  but we should definitely see iran , china and probably also russia as strategic `` allies '' against islamic extremism/jihadism , which is of the salafi/wahabi kind . 
  it 's not worse than when we allied ourselves with stalin 's soviet russia to collectively fight the nazis that was a much bigger threat , only to be enemies again right after the war . 
  it 's really difficult to pick a side though . 
  we have egypt that sees the muslim brotherhood as their `` enemy number one '' , turkey that is moderately supporting of the muslim brotherhood and sees the pkk and the `` g\u00fclen movement '' as their enemy number one , and saudi arabia that sees shia forces in yemen and iran as their arch rival or main enemy . 
  the reason the us and the uk supports the saudis is that its an easy way to gain favor of most of the middle east , as both the militarily powerful egypt and the united arab emirates will negotiate and support you . 
  with the invasion of iraq they ousted saddam who was a sunni extremist ruling over a shia majority country . 
  and with al-assad in syria he 's from a small shia muslim sect ruling over a sunni majority country . 
  assad should have been the next to go but today his forces are sheltering christians and other minorities within their borders . 
  if we were actually * siding * with iran then we 'd have 80 % + of the middle east , which is all sunni , against us ( most sunni powers are highly suspicious of iran ) . 
  and we 'd then be passively supporting the syrian governent ( which is an iranian and russian ally ) and qatar somewhat as they are meddling with both the sunni and shia parts of the world . 
  probably does n't matter so much for france , germany , sweden and other nations here though . 
  the usa will keep supporting both israel and saudi arabia heavily . 
  sorry : x probably was thinking from a pre-election mindset . 
   is there any corner of the world left not ruled by crazy ? 
  norway , finland , the netherlands , canada , germany , new zealand , denmark , italy , spain , south korea , estonia , switzerland , czech republic mostly , japan mostly , austria , taiwan , ireland and iceland . 
  scotland has their own parliament at least , and there 's a lot of liberal states in the usa . 
  sweden ai n't so bad either except i do n't feel positive about the present or future of politics here . 
  georgia ( country ) seems rather chill too . 
  everyone thinks because of the us and uk especially , turkey , the philippines and various dictatorships and authoritarian states in the world they think the world is screwed for good . 
  independent island . 
  `` think line dancing is a sin '' ?? 
  and tourists !, 
  pretty sure / r/unitedkingdom posted that hours before worldnews people made it up . 
  i mostly found nice people first before i found all the bad ones . 
  it was way easier to avoid them until the whole social media ( and smartphone ) explosion occurred in the 2010s , bringing the internet to the true masses ... that 's why i tend to stay around my own friend circles in chats . 
  prayer is technically a form of meditation , but okay . 
  not seen this kind of muslim prayer before that is n't laying down bowing your head to the floor . 
  jeb confirmed for ukip supporter . 
  are they meditating , or what is this ? 
  just absolute fucking stupidity and hubris . 
  and now it has more like reversed itself with all the endless scandals and debacles and controversies with trump . 
  the only two things trump has been actually praised for so far is using a moab in afghanistan and hitting an airport with rockets in syria . 
  still rather have him as my opponent than may . 
  no , right election . 
  abolishing human rights laws ? 
  internet censorship and attempting to `` ban '' encryption ? 
  come on . 
  or emigration , as they got radicalized once they visit a muslim country ... libya , syria or etc, 
  chronic alcoholism and islam does n't mix !, 
  save our alcoholics !, 
  only because of the government in power . 
  if it was a labour government people would say it was labour-slanted . 
  does n't exist over there so much be scary to think about . 
  there 's stupid people in every country , who knew !, 
  and with how many stupid swedes i ' e seen despite people here not being particularly religious or anything that is often assumed to be related to `` intelligence '' when it 's not . 
   ` who shouted allah ' pff , why wo n't they just say `` god '' like the rest of us ? 
  exit the eu and bremain class-less . 
  and for the egyptian government the muslim brotherhood is their `` enemy no # 1 '' that should mean erdo\u011fan turkey and el-sisi egypt be enemies in a way . 
  `` we 've had enough of jezza 's rubbish '' i 've had enough of [ jeremy clarkson 's rubbish too .

  they 're becoming more conservative than the us ever was , except maybe in the 19th century in the good old victorian days with child labor in the coal mines and the wealthy isolated from them in their towers . 
  a dickensian + orwellian ( or huxleyian ? ), 
  world . 
  but is n't the us and russia reluctant as well , while they may not say it openly if they 'd use them or not . 
   firing missiles at syria the same thing obama intended to do in 2013 , with the `` red line '' being crossed by the use of chemical weapons , but was cock-blocked by congress and russia 's veto . 
  they have a rapidly growing middle class of 400 million people though , more are considered middle class with their own apartment and cars than the entire us population . 
  the remaining 1 billion remain poor but are hardly starving any more , thanks to their children working hard in factories and sending money and medicine back home . 
  meanwhile the us despite still being the world 's richest nation has immense poverty with people working hard to be able to keep a home and health care ( insurance ) at all . 
  just among americans i know there has been 3 or 4 people either losing their homes or at risk of doing so . 
  they see themselves as high class , even regular middle class people pretend to be . 
  fake news = g\u00fclenism !, 
  and albania . 
  i would not be surprised if the future would turn into a running man like world , where violence is a game show and the rest of society is strictly controlled with an iron fist to make people feel safe .
