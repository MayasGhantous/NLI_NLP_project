  `` this is the second time these alien terrorists shot down my election . '', 
  i 'd prefer if any new mosques , or churches , were built in your local style to fit the surroundings . 
   deportation comes to mind , but what is to say they do n't just blow themselves up in spite if that happens ? 
  like he eritrean who knifed a random mom and son to death at an ikea , and the stockholm van attack , both had their asylum request denied months prior , then either got radicalized or were plotting a `` revenge '' against anyone that looked swedish or white to them . 
  eriterans tend to be christian so that was a plain spontaneously racist attack to punish society , and the other i do n't know , but it indeed shocked our na\u00efve and perfectly safe country . 
  we 're kind of like the asian stereotype of people and officials not wanting to admit mistakes , instead saying `` we 're better/stronger now !! '', 
  ... and the_donald are pretty much all increasingly insane trump fanatics and dank meme bullshit and not normal/sane republican voters . 
  the church of sweden is protestant , heavily secular , believes in evolution and climate change , is liberal towards gay marriage and female priests . 
  the catholic church still does n't have women priests , or the anglican church in the uk . 
  it would be the same thing as having the loyalists in northern ireland to leave ni . 
  it appears there 's less and less people that can be considered loyalists there now , though , but not so in cyprus with the turkish `` loyalists '' . 
   certain parts of the internet are cesspits of extremism and need to be monitored/regulated . 
  the_donald ? 
  or the `` alt-right '' and racist subreddits that were banned for doxxing and threatening people . 
  they used gta v as a terrorist training simulation ... 
  same with trump and the travel ban . 
  both are hypocrites abusing the deaths of people for their own interests . 
  such gross decadence that is internet porn is something the jihadists hates !, 
  so by banning everything the jihadists hates , we will make them happy and never attack us again !, 
  this includes pork , alcohol , all kinds of sexual acts that are n't between a married man and woman , music that is n't religious songs , and so on . 
  sometimes i wonder if right-wing politicians and jihadists are n't apart of the same thing . 
  it 's hard to predict these kind of random hit and run attacks , even for experienced intelligence agencies . 
  regulate cars , regulate kitchen knives , regulate religions , regulate language ... 
  and much more to do ... 
  even if you 're poor you may very well have internet and light entertainment all around you . 
  not just saudi , though . 
  qatari , turkish , so many more . 
  also a lot of individuals funding places i bet . 
  so the cotton slaves were making our money all this time . 
  just real life gta . 
  that 's probably just an excuse by most of those . 
  climate will keep getting warmer anyway , but we can support an upper limit at least to minimize damage to some extent . 
  why would voter support for a party surge or plummet over a terrorist attack ? 
  do they think the tories are responsible for it ? 
  or that labour would handle it better or more likely prevent such things ? 
  in sweden i find both their and danish nettos ' product often better than many others . 
  but it depends on what product it is . 
  uh pretty much all of it is made in germany , the yoghurts , the chocolate as well as the sausages . 
  the vegetables are also cheap , and the chocolate can be decent . 
  [ we have a similar one in sweden ... ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/sweden/comments/68fq6g/n%c3%a4r_man_vill_h%c3%a4nga_med_grabbarna_och_sprida_lite/ ) [ and that old woman was apparently sweden 's first female party leader , vera oredsson ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordic_reich_party ), 
   i see a grandma at far right . 
  / r/forwardsfromgrandma, 
  and is n't that what they want ... ? 
  to be back a long time ago , `` in another galaxy '' far , far away ... 
   and is slowly reversing back to it 's barbaric middle eastern stage . 
  oddly enough , 1000 years ago countries such as iraq , syria and iran ( persia ) where intellectual centers with scientific development , better than many places in europe ( they were earlier than westerners at translating certain ancient greek sciences ) . 
  then after mongol conquests and sacking of cities , and burning of libraries , the power switched to egypt and most progress were at halt except for the ottoman empire . 
  usually blue is rated positive and red negative , this time it 's the reverse ... and green is `` middle '' for an unknown reason . 
  i 'm pretty sure it was dan harmon who put the auction up . 
  most of these are not real . 
  like the jesus doritos etc. 
  if you deny climate change , one might as well deny gravity from being a thing too . 
  belief is the only reason it exists , right !? 
  ( ... ) `` birds do n't believe in gravity , that 's why they 're able to fly ... '', 
  i recall corsica had high amount of gun ownership too . 
  the `` pizzagate '' and `` alt-right `` subs were such a toxic clusterfuck of shit admins had to ban them after they started doxxing people and planning physical harm to people in real life . 
  ( and causing negative publicity to reddit in the media which is a big no-no to the site administrators ... ) t-d seems to be a safe space so far . 
  there was a post in this sub about it : [ how various countries/regions of the world blame problems/diseases on their neighbor country . 
  goscinny was the writer , uderzo the artist . 
  it 's nice that the main four candidates are communist , conservative , national socialist and centrist . 
  many left parties were known as communists prior to the 90s , some absolutely where . 
  while fn is not doing too much to hide the fact that it is some sort of neo-nazi party . 
  hopefully not too much bad will happen during macron 's term ... 
  people only say who they really are . 
  let them say it as long as they 're not threatening to attack people or individuals physically , stalking or sabotaging . 
  i 'm unsure about a lot of these questions , as they are country specific . 
  * `` military spending is a waste of money . '', 
  i definitely do n't see it as a waste for smaller countries like sweden to protect itself , but i definitely see it as a waste for giant countries such as the us that already has a massive military budget , and not spending it on social issues . 
  * `` irrational traditions should be abolished . '', 
  what is irrational ? 
  so if i side with one culture , but is against an other , or vice-versa ? 
  * `` reason is more important than maintaining our culture . '', 
  in what way does it have to be contradictory . 
  * `` it is important that we further our ethnic , cultural , or economic group 's goals above all others . '', 
  so if a african person immigrates , learn to speak my language and interact with everyone else . 
  it 's still not part of the same cultural or economic group ? 
  edit : [ no idea how i got `` dovish '' ] ( https://i.imgur.com/up3vk4y.png ) i 'll have to re-do some of these questions . 
  what flair ? 
  i ca n't see anything but `` europe '' . 
  similarly on the far-left melenchon want to gamble on a lot of issues , but i find it on a whole less serious or dangerous than le pen in the short term . 
  but with his `` soft diplomacy '' on russia [ citation needed , but someone in this sub mentioned it ] and apparent will to collaborate with south american dictator-wannabees ( france joining some bolivarian group ? ), 
  i wonder if he 's not also paid by russians , but far from as much as le pen is . 
  he also does n't seem willing to support macron yet , while both fillon and hamon is . 
  because that works for most people . 
  just like the early nazis ( brown shirts ) had left-wing nationalist policies . 
  only reverse gender this time !, 
  sweden had this march as well, 
  he also said the election was rigged against him only to later say it was n't . 
  t_d was also a satire/joke once before it got all serious . 
   plus that whole rrg thing seems scary . 
  what is rrg ? 
  red-red-green ? 
   hould 've placed a russian flag next to her anyway . 
  they really should have . 
  far-right europeans , russians , and far-right muslims ( islamists ) sure has been ramping things up in recent years . 
  i remember protests in taksim square in 2013 i think , then in 2015 erdo\u011fan got increasingly stronger only to be given a chance to consolidate power in 2016 and then now ... 
  i 'm worried the influence turkey and conservative pro-erdo\u011fan expatriates in europe will have on us . 
  2033 will be an hell of a year i recon . 
  or it wo n't . 
  `` i do n't like / r/prequelmemes .
