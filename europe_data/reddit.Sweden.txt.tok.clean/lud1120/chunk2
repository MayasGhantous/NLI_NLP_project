  why are you surprised ? 
  all the chaos with the current immigration crisis and how our government is incapable of even handling it . 
  breivik was a member of fremskrittspartiet , and they are allowed to be in government , no problem . 
  how is sd much worse than that party , despite their neo-nazi past ... norway 's is just a lot more `` clean '' . 
  similary dansk folkeparti in denmark is in government , not talk about the true finns in finland. , sd is not even allowed to say more than a few words , and they keep growing and growing due to being this underdog that people roots for . 
  but no the rest of the parties created an establishment to put sd out from influence in theory , but in practise making them stronger than ever . 
  if they were in power people would actually see if they can do anything better or not . 
  his brother larry is in the uk for the green party over there , i 'd wish he could go to sweden or denmark and be one hell of a politician to vote for . 
  younger people all known english well in northern europe so it should not be too difficult ... 
   that are n't presidents or police . 
  and having a new ice age up north will make practically everyone deny global warming existing , and go with the `` it will actually be colder ! '', 
  agenda , which my older brother keeps parroting . 
  thing is none of his stuff is just something that exist about himself , but almost all of the republican establishment thinks the same . 
   might actually have the opposite effect of that supposed increased european cohesion . 
  more like increased european right-populist/far-right cohesion and collaboration . 
  and jimmie \u00c5kesson in sweden , five star movement in italy , continued fidesz rule in hungary , fremskrittpartiet in norway and dansk folkeparti in denmark . 
  i 'd really want smaller countries such as my own to have some independence in the economy , own currency and foreign policy , please . 
  but sure , go on with an own ( optional ) army and finance ministry , as long as you let us all vote for it - and opt-out if our populace regrets it , and still being a eu member . 
  i would prefer an independent foreign policy and army for each country , but some collaboration is good too , as long as other countries do n't meddle too much with he rest . 
  the eu will now have to be able to defend themselves against * both * russia-china and the united states . 
  still so very small , for something so very big and important ... 
  unlike military at 4 % or more . 
  turkish sometimes sounds like middle eastern norwegian to me ... 
  it 's a bit more akin to athenian democracy where only free greek men where the ones to vote , while this one includes women and kurds etc. 
  similar to how qatar , uae and saudi arabia are all really wealthy and not war-torn either . 
  sad that what is only for the genuinely neo-nazi papers in sweden and most of the world ... 
  in the uk technically neo-fascist papers like this exist in mainstream . 
  and i do check some populist/alternative papers here and they are nothing like that , mostly just anti-immigration , islam criticism and various nationalromantic silliness . 
  oh and plenty of trump supporters . 
  have n't really dweleld in the darkest pits of the political internet , apart form flashback but that is more like a general drug/media/conspiracy / travel/food/sports like mini-reddit with a conservative-libertaritarian slant . 
  denmark also mainly produce electricity from coal and the rest wind . 
  no nuclear power plants are in operation . 
  the soviet union definitely had an emphasis on russian nationalism , where the language that everyone needed to learn was russian . 
  it 's definitely nationalist - for the top 10 % of the population . 
  the rest is ignored in poverty and ignorance . 
  just like human traffickers , there 's those with money . 
  the spanish has a saying that swedes are dumb or what it was . 
  i 'm pretty sure swedes in general are a lot better at emotionalism than rationalism , a lot of people that feel for things but does n't think very much . 
  but at least we are n't religious i guess ... 
  but people tend to religiously follow trends , diets , fashions and so on . 
  so loud it 's way above `` rip headphone users '' level . 
  that really depends on the subtitles . 
  sometimes they fit perfectly , sometimes they do n't . 
  being perfectly synced and well-written . 
   ask anyone . 
  you 're replying to a likely turkish national or expatriate . 
  clearly krampus-hobbits . 
  same with slow islamization and increasing ( far ) right-wing populist forces in various countries . 
  thank you for the image, 
  it seems to be a already old-hat phone with maybe up to 100-200 times the capacity at most . 
  / pol / is just 19th century politics or time travelers . 
  [ norwegian prime minister erna solberg got some creepy looks at the same place . 
  ] ( http://ap.mnocdn.no/incoming/article8431078.ece/alternates/w1440c169/opt_tb0ea3a9_doc6pav56c4wao19k2lozy_doc6pav7i1h9s7wg1nkd0e-yge5eloqnq.jpg?updated=150420160808 ), 
  i wonder what kind of elite training ( or bribery ) these soldiers need to go through to be soldiers at the dmz and never defect . 
  probably never doing it solely for their families sake . 
  it 's more like an extreme dose of viagra that kills your heart . 
  also , it gives more clicks than `` deadly spider '', 
  * and * blonde . 
  no it wo n't help as people who follow the law will be punished for it , while those who wo n't follow it will not . 
  yep nobody cares about denmark . 
  it 's jugoslavs , somalis and afghans mostly . 
  religion does n't matter much with the general gang crime . 
  soviet communism had many elements of russian nationalism in it , maybe not in the beginning but definitely after stalin . 
  when i 've been using vpns the same applies to dutch ips too . 
  [ trump did have a low-key presidential campaign in 2000 . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/donald_trump_presidential_campaign,_2000 ) and people who vote for him think he 's `` new '' and `` fresh '' ... 
  when he 's less so than even hillary . 
  erich kempka was a german not polish . 
  he 's a flame-y guy . 
  doctoring without borders, 
  what narrative , from the bbc of all things ? 
  the nazis did n't consider slavs white and millions of them where murdered , even people with maybe no more than few percent jewish blood . 
  yeah and those migrants are a small elite among millions who would never have the chance to go to europe , or even want to . 
  like father and mother . 
  what , you 're saying norwegians * do n't * drink oil ? 
  anything to attempt to diss trump or putin and his government 's view of `` gay europe '', 
  different types of muslims is important to separate . 
  most jihadism are ( often arab-speaking ) sunnites from africa to asia . 
  the charlie hebdo ones are supposed to be * offensive * and they manage to do just that . 
  these ones i just dunno ... 
  lol puns like what the bbc does , except far more nonsensical and cringey . 
   popov was a serbian triple agent of voa ( code named `` du\u0161ko '' ) , mi6 ( code named `` tricycle '' ) and the abwehr ( code named `` ivan '' ) . 
  [ 33 ] fleming knew popov and followed him in lisbon , portugal as an escort appointed by the mi6 , witnessing an event in the estoril casino where popov placed a bet of $ 40,000 ( $ 643,529 in 2016 dollars [ 34 ] ) in order to cause a rival to withdraw from a baccarat table : fleming used this episode as the basis for casino royale . 
  reddit made fun of the christchruch earthquake cause it was named ... `` christ church '' so `` it was god who dit it '' blablah . 
  same poor attempt at humor . 
  it should be allowed but it 's nonetheless garbage . 
  usually these terrorists are so despicable that they will do something like this on their own regime . 
  as suicide is heavily frowned upon in their cultural sphere , they think killing other people along with them somehow `` saves '' them . 
  when you 're convinced in your solid devotion to god that light `` sins '' such as pork consumption , sexual activity and drug use wo n't condemn you to hell but may still bless you into heaven . 
  there are people claiming `` oh look , he was no ` real muslim ! ' '', 
  but who the hell is a `` real muslim '' if not those that `` know '' that petty sins such as alcohol and pork is only making one less `` clean '' but that god may still forgive you for it . 
  even mass-murder is forgiven according to the most radical muslims so why would not weed , pork and alcohol . 
  it 's a contradiction for sure , but the majority of christians in the world that are convinced that god exist and their devotion to jesus christ still do `` sinful '' things like that as well while still being optimistic . 
  like how catholics can simply `` repent '' for their sins if they are honest about it in front of a clergyman . 
  it 's like the superstition that avoiding `` unlucky numbers '' bring less ill to your future but hardly anyone think one is condemned forever if you use a number 13 or see a black cat cross the road ... 
  this is why these monotheistic/abrahamic religions are so dangerous , especially islam that had a real and factual `` prophet '' as the main source of devotion that you can not criticize without leaving the religion . 
  two / s / s makes it gestapo . 
  especially as a polak in poland . 
  after the cold war it was notoriously easy to cheat your way out of draft , simply by checking that you have this and this issue . 
  and it 's nothing like cocaine as it 's only up to 4 % in a single leaf .
