  of the $ 40 billion ( or 40 thousand million ) [ nb 1 ] spent on earthquake reconstruction , an estimated $ 20 billion ( or 20 thousand million ) [ nb 1 ] went to create an entirely new social class of millionaires in the region , $ 6.4 billion ( or 6,400 million ) [ nb 1 ] went to the camorra , whereas another $ 4 billion ( or 4,000 million ) [ nb 1 ] went to politicians in bribes . 
  only the remaining $ 9.6 billion ( or 9,600 million ) , [ nb 1 ] a quarter of the total amount , was actually spent on people 's needs . 
  i wonder what everyone think they should do with the growth of nationalism in countries . 
  they will be even more against the eu with removing the traditions in each country , `` united in diversity '' is bullshit . 
  a national defense , like a football team is good for national morale . 
  especially for small countries like sweden it is ... where we have much less of a national identity than say france or the uk . 
  i 'm pretty sure the soviet threat post-wwii is what unified people more than just the eu itself did , and american support for european stability and as a front against soviet growth . 
  at least they are hardly starving to death in those countries unlike north korea ...

  in my town in sweden with 10,000 inhabitants we had a furniture factory with 500 employees that made stuff for ikea .

  [ sounds like the madagascar plan under the nazis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/madagascar_plan ), 
  not saying you 're wrong , but what narrative ? 
  the media tries to not be racist by not mentioning race , and that 's fine to begin with to not drawing quick conclusions but important to clarify later on . 
  i think the media appears to have a devout `` anti-racist '' style that does n't really improve society when news go out like wildfire to alternative media anyway . 
  iranians are pretty much `` white '' to me , and so are arabs to some extent . 
  we consider anything from mediterranean to slavs `` white '' despite all the differences in culture , language and looks so it 's rather irrelevant . 
  no , and certainly not by seeing what is posted in / r/europe or / r/sweden, 
  i 'm for people saying whatever shit they want , they are only the ones to take the consequences themselves and not being tailed what they are allowed to say by the state , which is only increasing extremist and conspiratorial thought .
