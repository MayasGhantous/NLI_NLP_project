  [ kat is also back , just not the community it once engrossed .

  as long as the uploaders exist , the magnet links will too . 
  modern czars/tsars dress in business suits and has no official titles , when much of it is the same . 
  same with sultan erdo\u011fan . 
  the burkini seems like a modernized version for the niqab , and especially the burqa . 
  any baby-step of reforming a harsh religion is bad ? 
  `` gay europe '' approves . 
  no crime done , it 's still `` freedom of speech '' . 
  we should not have armies of police arresting people saying stupid/hateful things on twitter or facebook , neither should we arrest assholes like this without a obvious reason . 
  we should stop any funding for them though , and criticize them openly . 
  probably put them on a fbi/gchq watchlist too as a precaution . 
  freedom of speech is still more important over saying hateful things . 
  i bet if he did an islamic parody he 'd just be a headless corpse by now . 
  we could have state-sanctioned imans , and if the immigrants do n't approve of them then they ca n't be approved into our society . 
  i would like to say the same about pentecostal/evangelical/charismatic christians , but they are a lesser problem . 
  just like how many of our bishops , in sweden in particular are very critical about a lot of things in christianity but still officially have a `` faith in god '' . 
  it 's like saying the nazis were `` idiots '' for causing a global war and exterminating jews and other minorities , which they indeed were in part but they also knew exactly what they were doing and believed in . 
  i bet there could be some form of `` secularism '' in islam , after hundreds of years of development but it would still not quite the same as ours . 
  the main problem is the prophet muhammad , who was a very real person and a highly successful conqueror along with his successors , much harder to make fun of someone like that , who strictly ordered the beheading of satirists and people joking about his own divinity . 
  unlike jesus who was more or less an imaginary hippie saint kind of guy , a tool to spread christianity more easily by making people feel sad for his/god 's `` sacrifice '' . 
  but he ai n't technically wrong , it 's allowed in islam if you are a true believer that merits each word in the `` holy book '' . 
  better than pretending there is no such thing in the religion ... 
  imagine if europe had `` progressed '' to the point of everyone walking around in the nude , with translucent skin-tight clothing . 
  and then these people arrive with their 11th-19th century traditions in tact . 
  cultural shock . 
  the brits has have a history of prudes in government . 
  `` butt hurt '' originally meant just spanking ... not rape . 
  they should not need to wear full-covering with their husbands at least , no ? 
  if they want to be a citizen they need to adapt to our laws and cultural habits . 
  burqa/burkas should be banned , one of the most visibly negative things that gets associated with islam ( apart from terrorism ... ) full-body veils should be discouraged , but not outright banned . 
  `` support the hillary for prison fund '' ... oh come on , this is cringe politics . 
  i 'm no supporter of hillary , but this is trash . 
  certainly not quite as evil as trump is in public . 
  murdoch vs soros death battle . 
  life hacks for carjackers . 
  they are still journalists - just real shoddy ones . 
  sorry for unfounded ramblings , but it 's not easy for anyone to know what is `` right '' or `` wrong '' . 
  i 'm trying to be critical of a lot of things . 
  muslim nations had had a lot of changes , just like western countries , and there are also many smaller subdivisions and different thoughts . 
  but it 's mainly sunni and shia as far as i know . 
  turkey had a strong pro-western and secularist constitution under atat\u00fcrk , but how close is it to that ideal today with erdo\u011fan ? 
  iran was also pro-western under the shahs , and afghanistan and iraq were rather modern and progressive until the 80s . 
  today many women in iran tries to ignore official religious policies by not wearing veils the and turkey has a strong liberal community . 
  the only thing i really have the right to comment on is what happens in my own country with some not-so-sneaky islamists in government [ such as mehmet kaplan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mehmet_kaplan ) and government funding of pro-islamic organizations under the veil of fighting islamophobia . 
  i do n't mind downvotes and criticism is appreciated as long as i get a proper reason for it . 
  i hang around on reddit too much . 
  2019 : russia invaders europe ? 
  sure i guess at one point islamic countries were more liberal than catholicism , and more science-friendly ( ancient greek mathematics were adopted earlier by muslims than in the west as it had no issues against scripture ) . 
  but how islam might have been a 1000 years ago and how it is today has * no * relevance what so ever , and shortly after the islamic golden age were science and progress repressed in favor of religion . 
  like how they are willing to ban encryption in the name of `` security '' when hardly any terrorist would care about it ... 
  and then we have countries like the netherlands and france with large amounts of muslims , france with 10 % of the population . 
  sure people are `` coming to their senses '' , but it 's also worrying with the impending religious-political war between islam and the west in europe . 
  we 're seeing the first signs , with parties like the national front slowly taking over and jihadist attacks accelerating . 
  the future may have a neo-ottoman caliphate in turkey as a response to isil , who knows maybe they will re-conquer saudi arabia at one point . 
  and a europe where many countries are allied in some form of right-wing anti-eu union . 
  just speculating . 
  but it 's so ingrained in the minds of muslim women they believe they are `` safer '' by wearing them to keep away from peeking men who are not their husbands , not that they are actually more visible in the western society unlike in the mena countries . 
  muslims do things that make islam look bad and instead of changing their habits they complain about `` islamophobia '' and our politicians fund islamic organizations that try to fight said `` phobia '' . 
  but they wo n't do anything to fight `` christophobia '' in their own homelands . 
  it 's like we are the ones who need a `` multicultural '' society so to make us `` less racist '' , they do n't need to !, 
  the world is burning . 
  both literally and methaphorically . 
  climate change and jihadism , and far-right politics . 
  and the crimean occupation and referendum was simply a punishment to the ukrainians for deposing a grossly authoritarian putin-allied oligarch . 
  porochenko may be a western-backed oligarch , but he 's hardly worse for the people than yanukovych . 
  i ca n't blame the majority of ethnic crimean russians for being russia-friendly though , and believing in the fears about ukrainian nazis . 
  as soon as ata\u00fcrk came in power , he denounced the armenian genocide , greek genocide and the assyrian genocide as [ `` a shameful act '' ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/1xotp9/what_was_kemal_ataturks_involvement_and_view_of/ ) when the bloody massacres were just about a decade earlier . 
  and while i ca n't blame him for trying to appease the nationalists at the time , his government has shoved the genocides under the rug for the benefit of a stable government . 
  still today turkey is the same , where they will likely to say that it 's `` not our fault , it was the ottomans / [ young turks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/young_turks ) who did it , shut up !, 
  it all looks like a pretty silly charade today . 
   but as long as it exists we should use it to teach ( or create ) a form of islam that is compatible with western society . 
  how is that even possible , though ? 
  christianity has been molded for thousands of years of different thoughts , a war between two sub-dominions and then enlightenment , social revolutions and secularism . 
  islam has been more or less the same for thousands of years since the islamic golden age ended and the ottoman empire was the single caliphate for sunnites , then it fell and various kingdoms fell and then bunch of arab nationalist/socialists arrived and attempted to secularize society by being authoritarian dictatorships and since the soviet-afghan war there has been increasing amount of jihadist organizations . 
  islam has only had [ a major presence of most european nations for a few decades ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islam_in_europe ) and has not been shaped by revolutions , secularism or welfare states . 
  [ sure there 's a few muslims that try to `` reform '' islam , like maajid nawaz of the quilliam foundation , ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/4x1cvv/muslims_in_belgium_call_for_coordinated_response/d6bmvct ) i applause them for trying . 
  but how can you truly reform if muhammed is the one and only prophet you have to shape your thoughts and ideas from , and [ if you are against any of the ground-pillars you are against islam itself ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/five_pillars_of_islam ) . 
  if people 's thoughts about the prophet is not changed , then islam can not change . 
  and at what points make them still a muslim if they are critical of muhammed ? 
  might as well leave the religion entirety , but there 's a widespread fear that if you leave the religion , bad things will happen to you as `` god is watching '' . 
  there is a story of an ex-muslim , who remember he and his mosque prayed for no bad things to happen to their teacher , cause god is always listening . 
  and then he died in a car accident and they continued to pray anyway . 
  at that point he started to question faith . 
  [ many mena countries have a mix of shariah law and secular law ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/application_of_islamic_law_by_country#sharia_in_the_world ) , which is like still having the bible as a main source of morals . 
  most problems we see with muslims is the very different cultural traits they have , with how dependent women are on men ( not been anything like it in western europe since the 19th century ) and how sexually repressed people are ( no sexual revolution , sex outside of marriage is a sin ) which causes the younger generations behave inappropriately in public , or even assault women at times . 
  and how our various `` blasphemous '' christian imagery is offending many muslims , or our dietary and hygienic habits . 
  [ christianophobia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-christian_sentiment ) is rising among muslims , where christians , including jews , pagans or atheists are repressed or persecuted . 
  and with the anti-christian hate , we see far-right neo-religious rising as a response . 
  oh we thing we are evil for having the far-right rising in popularity , when it 's a natural response among a lot of unhappy voters as they are the only ones who dares to be critical about islam . 
  it would n't need to be the case , though . 
  trial ! = jail still pay a hefty fine . 
  world war ii was not about saving jews at all , few knew or even believed there was a full-scale genocide until 1942-1943 , and even then it was more about punishing them even harder . 
  it was about defending countries against a foreign invader run by a mad man . 
  just like the american civil war was very little about black people 's rights . 
  [ there 's a lot of prophets in islam , including jesus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prophets_and_messengers_in_islam ) just that mohammed is the final prophet . 
  most of them just report what they hear , or think they heard . 
  others yell as loud as possible for clicks . 
   life magazine reported the widespread view among american troops of france as `` a tremendous brothel inhabited by 40 million hedonists who spent all their time eating , drinking , making love and in general having a hell of a good time '' . 
  being forced to carry unwanted children is one thing .
