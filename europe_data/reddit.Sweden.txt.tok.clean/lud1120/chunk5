  and the palestinians should compensate for the christian refugees as well . 
  there 's also some 20 % arabic population within israel to look after . 
  but i 'd wish palestine and israel was the same country , even as an apartheid-like system it would at least be more honest than it is now . 
  too late for that now , though . 
  good luck to them ? 
  make the isil militants ' blood boil like the water in their tea kettles . 
  england and france were once centuries old archenemies , sweden and denmark/netherlands or russia as well , or germany and france . 
  for putin it does n't matter , he need all the `` friends '' he can get his hands on . 
  after the close ally libya fell and how they will lose ties to venezuela soon as well , and with them , possibly cuba too . 
  and north korea is getting too unreliable to ally with . 
  they 'd likely be easier to catch , though . 
  the clouds of europe is e ( u ) rupting . 
  ` cuz nazi gestapo or stasi amirite ? 
  site is loading for me . 
  putin is on a roll . 
  new central powers more like it . 
  the thumbnail looks like a happy merkel , no matter how hard i try . 
  the eu : always focusing on what matters the most . 
  agreed ... who is that guy in `` 2 . 
  '' , though ? 
  seems a bit like a douche . 
  who needs sculpture skills when you can just 3d print from the old masters ? 
  is claims responsibility for car accidents . 
  and the germanic tribes are together again at last . 
  ( british isles did n't have them until the anglo-saxons ) . 
  [ laser moon awakens ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu9dug3_kna ), 
  the story does n't have anything negative to rant about , that 's why . 
  it 's good to be considerate and not draw quick conclusions even when it 's obvious . 
  ireland is luigi , while ukip-britons are waluigi . 
  why is n't the dress red and more green , or did some african nations already cover that ? 
  esa is the true enemy . 
  says someone named `` clintoncrusher2016 '' i 'm polarized by this post . 
  while i agree on one thing about immigration and the dangers of islam etc , but it 's so easy to say by nearly anyone these days . 
  there 's a lot of things i * do n't * agree with !, 
  it 's so easy by devout trump supporters to go `` immigration is a problem , islam is dangerous '' and get lots of upvotes , only cause other politicians are considerate or cowardly to say otherwise , but we are giving giant buffoons that are skeptical of vaccines and climate change and giving them all the support over this . 
  there 's more things to be concerned about . 
   lacking education this is a common stereotype that those who vote far-right or right-populist are `` uneducated '' , when it often is n't the case . 
  sweden is , despite a very different language is so proficient in english and has obsessed in anything usa for a century that stuff like this happens there too . 
  many bullshit american-centric issues like `` gamergate '' and other things poison our media as well . 
  rape has nothing to do with sexual orientation . 
  one could be attracted to males buts still rape women or vice versa . 
  it 's among the lowest of the low kind of punishments to anyone . 
  read : prison rape . 
  or ancient greek and roman homosexuality . 
  hmm , yeah . 
  it 's so easy to read german without a good translation ... 
  i 'd say there was a lot less ethnic clashes in the islamic world back when there was still major caliphates , before the ottoman empire fell . 
  muslims generally need strong , authoritarian-leaning leaders . 
  there was a major problem with how the bbc ignored jimmy saville 's acts and broadcasted his funeral ... 
  so i ca n't say i 'd trust them fully either . 
  and this coming from a social democrat . 
  politics seem a lot better overall in austria vs sweden for example . 
  [ good luck with that .

  they need longbowmen armed with tiny tactical nuclear arrows . 
  the pope does not . 
  i do n't get whole term `` multiculturalism '' . 
  europe has always had multiple and diverse cultures , traditions and languages , but the big difference is that islamic culture has been mostly apart from the majority of countries until a few decades ago . 
  the disproportionate amount of muslims is only one big * monoculture * for the most part and is not `` enriching '' anyone except for bored and entitled upper-middle class people that live in white majority areas . 
  i think somalis are among the least respected from africa overall , even within africa . 
  france has been anti-religion since the french revolution , but has had too much confidence in their own `` assimilation '' strategy . 
  thing is they do n't want to be `` assimilated '' and likely never will . 
  they live in separate communities in the suburbs and connected to the tv of their homelands so to never be forced to assimilate or integrate . 
  if newspaper rags stopped using terms like `` experts say ... '' and actually hired actual experts and not diluting the term . 
  france is not as nice as it used to be . 
  rather reduce freedom of movement than freedom of information and privacy . 
  but it 's all worsening . 
  a legal brothel & caf\u00e9 combo might been a better idea . 
  twinnings & rimmings ? 
  would be way better with an advanced fleshlight at home or something . 
  one needs to remember that stuff like this would probably happen even without terrorism . 
  still not sure of the cause , though . 
  bill was a head of his time with a blowjob in the white house . 
  not that i really blame him . 
  while i can agree on gun control , i still do n't think the uk is peaceful enough to have the regular police being armed with nothing but batons and stuff . 
  norway does n't have regular cops with guns either . 
  ** edit : ** [ if you do n't want to avoid sitations like this , where a dozen cops has to surround a single man with a machete ... fine with me . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5cpx4rkww ) the only problem is when cops are poorly trained to handle guns wisely , and cameras would resolve if anyone did something wrong . 
  cops in sweden have miss-used weapons several times , but that still does n't make me want them to be unarmed . 
  i bet the uk is relatively safe to be in , but is it really safer than sweden ? 
  communist even . 
  but i 'll take a communist any day over a jihadist ... 
  except for those who would interrogate and torture me and put me in labor camps . 
  plan z is building fences/walls around the entire europe . 
  hungary 's government have other reasons to be called mean names , but not for protecting their borders . 
  what do you expect . 
  each large subreddit has their own circlejerks , what a large amount always agrees on or disagrees on . 
  / r/europe is still among the smaller , and quite a lot more chill than other political-related subs , but not without the circlejerks from time to time . 
  the pro-eu/pro-federationists i 've had some issues with , but also the pro-nationalists at times . 
  most of them are not even bearded , either . 
  and they very often speak the country 's native language to some extent . 
  yet a modern-day one who openly killed 70 is apparently not . 
  jihadists are openly and knowingly evil for the most part , just like the nazis . 
  and no death sentence for the bastard and traitor breivik who killed 70 . 
  he has his own gym and internet access , claims `` torture '' . 
  laughable . 
  pff , `` religiously ignorant '' . 
  sure they do not attract most imans and other learned muslims , but they sure as hell can still have almost the exact ideology . 
  look at saudi arabia vs isil , they are not friends , but certainly no direct ideological enemies either . 
  one imam from an other can disagree on such ridiculously petty things such as `` do god have human feet or not ?
