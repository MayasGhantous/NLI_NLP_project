  how much can we anthropomorphize him '' ? 
  and that could be the * sole * reason they disagree with such types as i.s. 
  less that they murder and enslave in the name of the same religion , they are n't breaking what muhammad said . 
  the only way islam could reform is if they were critical of the prophet , but then it would be islam no more . 
  more like yet an other judeo-chrisitan niche cult . 
  the most devout muslims that obsess on muhammad as the only true and final `` prophet '' . 
  hippie jesus ai n't got shit on that ... 
  germans can have clever puns and stuff , but hardly anything crazy funny - the language barrier also keeps that away . 
  nothing that trustworthy charities would n't help against !, 
  sure some feel that charities is a bourgeois thing , and it is , but we are * all * part of the `` bourgeois '' , we should not pretend otherwise . 
  europe has always been * multicultural * with its diverse cultures and traditions ... why accepting a mostly mono-culture of millions of muslims that has been mostly separate from the rest of our cultural sphere for millennia . 
  he did target * intellectuals * regardless of ethnicity or religion . 
  while the nazis could spare anti-nazi intellectuals if they were of the `` good kind '' of race . 
  the antipathy towards politicians is pretty strong , though . 
  but then so is everywhere . 
  they should totally send an army of ferrets to fight islam . 
  the [ weasel war dance ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/weasel_war_dance ) might be effective , who knows ... 
  yet reddit and many others loved to praise him cause he was a lot friendlier and social character than the elusive benedict and told believers to * not hate * on gay people . 
  also being an argentine national was a big change . 
  abu bakr al-baghdadi is somewhat of an anti-pope , as he 's devoutly anti-west . 
  i do n't think there has been any central pope-like leader of sunni islam since the fall of the ottoman empire which was the last caliphate . 
  since then there has been many fallen kings and arab socialist/nationalist governments instead . 
  shi'a islam has the ayatollah . 
  [ the muslim world also had slavery of white people and slavs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/barbary_slave_trade ) . 
  i 'm pretty sure the [ arab slave trade ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arab_slave_trade ) is what inspired europeans to do the same later . 
  i 'd prefer to live in secular `` christian '' or buddhist countries . 
  norway is pretty nicely secular despite stil having an official state church i believe , and it 's more truly so than sweden i think as we kind of abandoned having an official secular state and letting islam gain more influence , and focusing on petty things like banning church music from schools so to not `` offend muslims '' . 
  and as a response the christian right is increasingly stronger . 
  i could care less about the eu than i already do , but it 's more about saving europe as a continent of mostly peace and positive development from the 1950s to now , while i find some eu policies as in recent decades more regressive than progressive . 
   such as the japanese mission that had to deal with a gas leak so alluring to the tokyo sarin gas attack ? 
  the fuck is that from . 
  now it has been . 
  reminds me of how caucescu gave his wife a doctorate for no reason . 
  so loud , but was alright , informative enough, 
   b-baka !, 
  same with many younger saudi royals , etc. 
   ** lol **, 
  i 'm glad it 's not greece 's putin either . 
  cracking encryption ... like any actual terrorist actually uses it !, 
  for fuck sake . 
  people getting murdered ? 
  let 's spy on people . 
  it proves that all politicians are crooked shits , from the left to the right , which also includes the far-left and far-right as they also love spying , probably even more . 
  jihadists use twitter and simple websites , unencrypted sms and stuff . 
  if you are going to die in battle or blow yourself up , you do n't give a damn about `` privacy '' . 
   tackling arms sales on the internet . 
  that could only make it a bit harder for people like the munich shooter , who had a very different reason for killing people . 
  those determined enough will find guns anyway . 
   `` fridolin poopface '' . 
  reference to gustav fridolin ? 
  how can one be tolerant , when little tolerance is given back . 
  it 's also one thing to be against islam , and an other thing to be against muslims as a whole . 
  yes , and while we love to draw parallels to 1930s europe , it really ** is n't ** the same now . 
  back then , there was no extremist jews murdering dozens of people every other month in the name of their religion and blowing themselves up , and they were hugely integrated into society in universities and had wealthy companies and so on , to the point of often having better standard of living than many ethnic germans . 
  jews had also been common in europe for at least a 1000 years and not just a few decades , and a few decades more for france i believe . 
  people 's anger and even hatred is often * legitimate * today , but that does n't mean it needs to go out of hand with far-right taking the credit of being the only ones that dares or wants to challenge the establishment . 
  we need more anti-establishment parties to the left , too . 
  or just all the other parties actually improving things to curb their influence . 
  instead they just keep making them stronger every year as people 's dissatisfaction increases . 
  only we , as people and voters , can change things now . 
  if we try to be factual and not using * emotionalistic * arguments from the left and the right . 
  the left goes `` racism , poor oppressed immigrants , evil nazis and facists hate them cause they of different color ! '' . 
  the right goes `` the country is run by cultural marxist far-left islamophilic muslim lovers that want nothing but to destroy our nation states and culture that our ancestors fought for , eurabia '' etc. 
  hardly anyone in politics is not without emotionalism and angry words , but lately i see the right have been making them suit the populace views more and more by keeping much of that kind of talk away from their official ideology . 
  that is right . 
  it 's the same problem with people who naively say `` what if religion never existed ??! '', 
  they really do n't get that religion has been an important part of human societal evolution , focus on * has been * . 
  but even today people can show great quasi-religious devotion to everything from celebrities to other things . 
  it 's no surprise that they would be impressed by the islamic conquests , where they conquered and assimilated a huge swath of lands in few hundred years of time . 
  from saudi arabia to spain . 
  the problem is that mohammad did very much exist , and everything he said and belived in is written as fact . 
  unlike jesus who was mostly made up as a tool to spread the christian faith , which even has christ in the name of the religion . 
  when there is a lot of written fact about someone you are supposed to be able to critically analyze the persona but nope , you are never allowed to . 
  `` islam '' simply means * submission * and `` muslim '' means follower of mohammad . 
  there even are people who claim they are direct descendants of mohammad themselves , among the last ones being the [ hashemites ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hashemites ) who once ruled iraq and currenltly still rule jordan . 
  [ here 's a list of other claimed decendants of big m ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sayyid ) imagine if christianity had direct decentants of jesus , and that he personally conquered lands under his own name instead of being a imaginary hippie ? 
  i bet it would be an a lot stronger and more dangerous religion today . 
   but just more insane . 
  i dunno , the nazis had various personal religious ideologies . 
  [ hitler himself was a `` christian '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religious_aspects_of_nazism#adolf_hitler.27s_religious_views ) , [ himmler was a germanic neo-pagan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heinrich_himmler ) and g\u00f6ring an atheist . 
  i guess it 's `` more insane '' to blow yourself up , but the intentions behind it is not necessarily . 
  thing is , one of the church killers had an educated sister and a mother who was a university professor . 
  [ and recently in saudi arabia two stabbed their mother to death when she tried to stop against them from joining isis . 
  ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/saudi-arabia-isis-twin-brothers-stabbed-mother-death-stop-joining-jihadist-islamist-a7122266.html ) often the parets does n't even matter all that much . 
  from left-wing/liberal nutjobs to right-wing nutjobs . 
  not saying that merkel is `` left wing '' at any sense of the world , but her policies totally shy away from being harsh against migrants . 
  even minuscule steps back to how things where in the past is strongly criticized and prevented . 
  the fart could be made of toxic gas !, 
  but really , how could one not expect the media to react to things quickly when so much has been happening lately , and everyone wants to be the first to report . 
   suggested arab men were seen running away . 
  lol . 
  like actual terrorists would `` run away '' from a crime and not either pick up guns and start a shooting rampage if they did not blow themselves up from the very start . 
  ca n't blame eyewitnesses from being highly suspicious and worried though , especially these days . 
  props to the / r/europe mods for labeling the headline misleading when it really is . 
   some iranians believe in the so-called aryan theory and so do some armenians , yazidis , indians and so forth . 
  you 'd be surprised how much historical revisionism there is about nazism and hitler and conspiracy theories in the middle east and asia . 
  `` he was not that bad '' `` shouting ` i 'm german ' '' ?? 
  he was * bullied * right before the attack by someone for being a '' ( an asshole , wanker ) '' `` someone should cut your head off , you asshole '' and called a `` fucking turk '' while holding a gun and he said he had already been bullied for 7 years by his neighbor ethnic groups , and had bought a gun an ethnic german would not be insecure about their nationality . 
  [ here 's what the two ( three ? ), 
  were arguing about right before the shooting .
