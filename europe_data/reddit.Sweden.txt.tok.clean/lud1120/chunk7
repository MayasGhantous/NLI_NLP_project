  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/4u3ljt/shots_fired_in_munich_shopping_centre/d5mkry4 ) they totally did nothing to try to calm him down and make him ** not ** commit the act of mass murder he had planned of doing . 
  what makes him `` right wing '' or `` left wing '' if he did not differentiate between breivik 's or islamic terrorism and school shootings ? 
  the only reason he could admire breivik is how brutally efficiently he gunned down 72 youths . 
  some wish for a `` suicide by cop '' while being remembered for something when they are dead . 
  this one was totally insecure about his national belongings and was a minority stuck among much larger minorities . 
  free granite . 
  what is almost the plot to the norwegian tv show : [ okkupert ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/okkupert )  okkupert depicts a fictional near future in which russia , with support from the eu , occupies norway to restore its oil production . 
  this is prompted by a europe-wide energy crisis caused by norway 's green party coming to power and stopping the country 's oil production bizzare plotline if anything . 
  their prophet mohammad * , actually . 
  their allah ? 
  yeah it 's fun word to say , but it 's the same god for arabic-speaking christians . 
  what do you mean with `` most of islam '' , or most of muslim countries ? 
  [ many of them still use a mix of sharia law with common law ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sharia#application_by_country ) to varying degrees . 
  [ the last time the guilliotine was used in france ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/guillotine#retirement ) ... was a [ torture-murder in 1977 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hamida_djandoubi ) . 
  other arabic-speaking states call them daesh as a short form . 
  i 'm sure they dislike the term `` isis '' more than daesh . 
  what culture does n't use short forms for * something * ? 
  russian spies warning erodgan long before the coup occurred seems like the most plausible theory yet about the whole event , and why it went so swiftly against the coup-makers . 
  for putin , the more dictatorships or strongly authoritarian-led nations there exist the better . 
  russia losing libya was a disaster for them , and they are on their way to lose venezuela soon and possibly cuba in the near future . 
  ( no venezuelan oil , no cheap source of energy for cuba = closer to collapse ) . 
  they have few friends still around like belarus , iran and most importantly china . 
  north korea is difficult even for the russians to be friends with , despite importing slave labor from there . 
  i think you meant `` homophile '' , or is it a pun mixed with psychopathy . 
  now let 's hoping for an uneventful day . 
  did the swedish school attacker have a picture of bin laden ? 
  the independent terrorists are all planning things for months , but there are no masterminds in syria/iraq doing it . 
  that 's why simply bombing isis wo n't do much to defeat them ... as there is no `` them '' , they are right here , among us . 
  it was the same with al-qaeda . 
  bin laden sometimes had visitors asking him about ideas what kind of terrorist attack to do next , and at one point he was asked about having swords on a truck to maul pedestrians with and osama thought it was `` unnecessarily bloody '' . 
  oddly mauling people down with swords is seen as worse than bombing them to peaces , cause fire is `` pure '' or something . 
  but so is a clean sword with the right hand seen ... 
  do n't mix up cases like the munich shooter with cases like this . 
  france is in a much worse situation despite germany 's dastardly accepting hundreds of thousands of unchecked syrians and other groups in recent years , for them it has just started . 
  my worry is how europe will continue to be mostly secular and progressive despite the threat of islam and how increasingly strong the far-right is getting thanks to them . 
  how we will defeat them will be a long and painful one . 
  defeating all sort of extremism should be seen as progressive , accepting it as normal regressive and defeatist . 
  we need to act upon facts and not emotionalism , as emotion is what drives religious fanatics forward , but probably not as much their leaders . 
  the leader of isil abu-bakr baghdadi has a phd in islamic studies from baghdad university so he knows what he 's doing and believes in all what they strive for , they wo n't stop fighting until literally the whole world ends . 
  the problem here is not so much about the `` sky wizard ( s ) '' that exist in many , many cultures , but that mohammad was a very real person more akin to genghis khan than a mostly imaginary `` jesus '' figure , and the faith is all about the prophet and his deeds and beliefs . 
  it 's not just about a quran which is n't very different from the bible at it 's core , but the hadiths which is all about the big m that is never to be depicted or shown in a different light what so ever . 
  in the west we have been used to have different views and opinions about jesus and god and so on for a long time , some of those views we went to war over before settling with our differences . 
  how long will it take when the muslim world does the same ? 
  we have all forgotten that countries in middle east used to be fairly highly developed until recent decades . 
  if all of this happened 10 years ago we would have said the internet had made us much more connected and aware of both facts and lies . 
  now a news article can be debunked as quickly as it 's posted . 
  124 terror-related deaths in the * whole world * ? 
  that 's excluding boko haram and al-shabaab . 
  like they give a fuck . 
  and their sole intent is to shock and anger us as much as possible , and it 's working . 
  a lot of us of us will just be dumbfounded and saddened , though . 
  at least the republicans are more honest about what they are . 
  the honesty is also the problem as they are not shying away from anything they think is `` right '' . 
  * immigrant it 's not like one goes all the way to germany or sweden if one is actually `` in danger '' , there 's so many other countries to take shelter in . 
  and let 's not make actual refugees into the same thing as pathetic murderers . 
  i think it should be seen as the same as `` sieg heil ! '', 
  neither has to mean anything without context . 
  you think god is great ? 
  well good for you , then . 
  thing is , few places in western europe are like 1930s levels of poverty and inequality . 
  nowadays most people vote for them cause they say things * the establishment * does n't or prefers not to speak about . 
  and the sweden-democrats are still expelled from political influence despite gaining some 30 % of the votes ... sure lives on its democratic values . 
  and they will get even stronger as an underdog . 
  they ca n't even have a political rally without hundreds of leftist `` anti-fascists '' scream and yell at them and make as much noise as possible , and that annoys people too . 
  how can a democracy be a democracy if you expel `` anti-democrats '' ? 
  pretending your country is the most free or most progressive etc sure will bring more detractors . 
  if it was a school shooting nobody would doubt it was a rampage and not terrorism , not that rampages are not meant to spread terror and make them remembered . 
  i read wikipedia about the event and there was a sourced claim he yelled `` allahu ackbar ! '', 
  but even if he did that , it was probably just to scare people more while he could . 
  `` i 'm coming for you , korea ! '', 
  they tend to be more towards political than religious fundamentalism . 
  often they still call it `` domestic terrorism '', 
  i personally do n't think there really is any `` multicultural '' society , except maybe select places , melting pots like new york . 
  it was a concept , an idea that has been executed very poorly . 
  similar to the whole euro currency union thing , sounded good at first but ended up a disaster . 
  it 's more like isolated monocultures . 
  everyone were in denial that ww1 would turn out to be as big as it did , or that ww2 was on its way in the late 1930s . 
  similar now . 
   ( the far-right will weep ) yeah like the dozen islamic-influenced attacks wo n't be enough fuel for the fire for all upcoming political elections . 
  seems like a random , poorly `` planned '' rampage with no clear motive as of yet unlike to the carefully planned islamic ones in france . 
  we will all have our right-wing populist or far-right governments in the near future , and that 's probably what isil wants too . 
  to be fair general islamic attacks tend to be planned better with bombs or more specific targets , but i do n't know . 
  same with right-wing motivated ones . 
  if there was n't so much uncontrolled immigration there would n't be so much of either islamic - or right-wing extremism and attacks . 
  just stating . 
  random crazies also take inspiration from events like terrorism or school shootings and carries it out themselves . 
  or no , should be just ignore all the previous events that has happened in recent years ... 
  right-wing extremists do n't generally go out in the streets and shoot people . 
  they were calling out lone worthless muslims in the west to `` redeem themselves '' by attacking us unfaithful and `` sinful '' westerners and they would be `` rewarded '' in the afterlife . 
  seems like it 's working . 
  and it will make even more people vote for ( far ) right-wing parties which is probably what isis wants us to do . 
  including islamic fascists !, 
  powerful religions tend to influence the weak-minded , though . 
  there also is only one bible and not just one qu ` ran , there 's the hadiths too . 
  ottoman empire is known as `` the last caliphate '', 
   first a foreign nationalist organization sends a hitman to destroy whatever it can in france , source ? 
  islamism is also the main reason why the far-right is back in europe , but people tend to not see that islamism is far-right ideology at its most vile . 
  the left have turned into lame ducks with lack of confidence or charisma to rule properly , while the right is the same as always . 
  sure he ate pork and drank alcohol ... and abused his wife . 
  but the quran does n't outright ban any of it , just disapprove of it strongly .
