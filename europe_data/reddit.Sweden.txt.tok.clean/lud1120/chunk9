  trump is friends with putin . 
  and most right-wing populist parties in europe are more or less allied as well . 
  the only enemies that exist is the militant islamic organizations . 
  i can see a future where europe is divided between the pro-eu front and the russian supported front though . 
  just like norway , switzerland etc. 
  just like every single politician do after they win . 
   untested new war technology what new technology ? 
  also all the mainline nationalist/far-right/populist parties are are allied with each other against the eu pretty much . 
  it 's still better that they get the votes and not true neo-nazi parties that exist in the background , even if insincere they are of their actual views . 
  understandable that some of them are sponsored by russia . 
  by `` old people '' it was the majority of everyone above 24 years of age . 
  many feel the united nations should too . 
  but it would take an other great war for that to happen . 
  the poo smells like turkish spices . 
  merkel will be gone soon enough . 
  it was a miracle that she even got a third term ... and i feel it would have been better if it was not possible to serve more than two terms . 
  good luck with losing scotland and possibly even northern ireland too . 
  good luck with ww3 then . 
  circa 2030-ish could be expected . 
  france probably wo n't stay for long , with how much the national front is gaining . 
  it will be all former `` allied '' countries vs former `` axis '' at this point . 
  those who won the wars are more patriotic and more likely to succumb to right-wing populism as it never really have happened to them before . 
  it 's more like `` eip '' after scotland and possibly northern ireland leaves the `` uk '' . 
  hey , i just made that joke !, 
  oh well , take it . 
  greece should not have joined the euro to begin with , the eu could work just fine for them ( if it was n't for their own government 's corruption ) . 
  how much i do n't like the eu ... 
  this reckless behaviour is not something that will be any good on the short term . 
  even if they think this will benefit the uk ( just england ? ), 
  they are making it harder for everyone else . 
  so many countries have significant trade with the uk that they wo n't be able to do now , and it may take years to create new trade treaties . 
  also expect an inevitable second scotland independence referendum . 
  at first they fight for keeping scotland in their own union , then they fight to keep separate of the entirety of europe . 
  maybe they should n't have colonized india , and maybe they should blow up the channel tunnel if they are all that worried . 
  communism was also fascism . 
  they may be against the supernational eu , but they are still for westminister having more power over things . 
  putin is a russian orthodox christian . 
  it 's that simple . 
  surprised about cumbria . 
  i feel like they are all going to worsen the economy for some silly sensationalist `` independence '' ideals . 
  it 's nothing wrong with being euroskeptic , it 's good to be critical of them , but * leaving * an union which at its core is all about economic collaboration and trade ? 
  and will the euroskeptic politicans leave the eu parliament as well ? 
  also a bit odd how eu-friendly scotland is , which was all about that possible independence from the uk and how they want to be more like non-eu norway . 
  she 's more power ** less ** than anything . 
  [ red alert 2 called . 
  ] ( http://cnc.wikia.com/wiki/weather_control_device ), 
  should private schools be allowed ? 
  'cause they teach pretty much whatever they feel like in those . 
  that city really has n't changed much at all , apart from the def\u00e9nse economic district . 
  wow . 
  and we think the various festivals and marching in north korea today is impressive ? 
  it 's all low-budget compared to the past . 
  back when north korea was actually growing economically and had tons of economic support from the entire eastern bloc . 
  north koreans are n't all wrong with believing kim il sung 's reign was the `` good old days '' , despite being brainwashed about anything else . 
  anything like this is very rare and not that impressive today due to the extremely poor economy , which is so bad even the ruling class is desperately trying to have the same standard of living as they used to . 
  people will starve even more to make sure it remains so . 
  `` good joke '' that you can only see on reddit . 
  we 're all literally hitler again for mentioning such a thing . 
  obama is very far from a `` socialist '' . 
  it 's almost laughable to call him that . 
  but even if he is slightly socialistic , that does n't mean it has to be bad . 
  except almost every other western country that is n't america . 
  i heard bashar is a good dentist ... 
  iraqis that go to europe and hear about terrorist attacks in france probably shrugs it off as `` whatever '' as they were used to hear about that sort of thing almost daily at home . 
  not sure about accepting such desensitized people into our societies either , they 're likely to care much more about anything religion-related than terrorism . 
  they have faith in whatever would happen to them , they would be rewarded in the afterlife and it would be a worse sin to be unfaithful than to harm to others . 
  not saying they would condone or support terrorist acts , but they seem apathetic about it . 
  where area all the muslims protesting on the streets against the murder of innocents ? 
  and it 's not all `` syrians '' either , maybe no more than 30 % or less . 
  it 's more iraqis , afghanis and others that travel here . 
  the `` eu '' is n't enforcing dumb porn filters either . 
  why ca n't they stop laying blame on others on everything . 
  the uk is this innocent soul that only ever were the brave heroes who helped defeat facism and yadda-yadda . 
  it probably would be more economically viable for the eu if there was a central refugee/immigrant camp of sort built . 
  like a european [ `` ellis island '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ellis_island ) . 
  there 's always those who genuinely wants to be citizens too . 
  it 's somewhat ironic that orwell was a devout socialist himself , but warned the most about authoritarian communism or similar after he saw how the soviet partisans in spain were acting while he was fighting for the anti-francoist forces there . 
  wait for far-future star trek technology to arrive . 
  dystopia , rather . 
  eh it 's a culturally nordic country , and will have a bridge connected to finland in the future . 
  that would be a better idea . 
  no matter how bad one may feel about the soviet era , stuff should be preserved for memory . 
  this is an other reason why the `` far right '' parties is growing in places like germany and sweden . 
  people are sick of being self-shaming and how the government seemingly trying to push people into `` accepting '' immigrants by establishing refugee centers right next door to a lot of people , who probably had very little experience with foreigners to begin with . 
  the biggest atrocities sweden has ever done is likely the destruction of german and czech cities in the 17th century , and how the sami people were treated . 
  we in the west tend to view stuff like japanese imperialism and kamikaze pilots as something `` exotic '' and even `` pretty '' , while germans were evil nazis deserving of being bombed , burned and starved . 
  while in asia it can be fashionable to dress up in `` nazi chic '' and nobody seems to care . 
  we talk a lot about the nuclear weapons used on the japanese and how horrifying it was for the civilian population , but very little about the firebombings of dresden and similar . 
  chinese and koreans are about as offended by the imperial japanese flag as people tend to be with the swastika in the west . 
  the insult-an . 
  russian media is bad , but this is just ridiculous . 
   still not getting rid of zwarte piet though lmao why should they `` get rid '' of it ? 
  it 's not like black people are usually the ones who are offended by a dumb christmas tradition . 
  there have `` controversy '' over the dumbest things in sweden , like the [ `` nogger black '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gb_glace#nogger_black_controversy ) ice cream , `` but it sounds like the n word in english !, 
  ! 1 '' or the [ `` chinese puffs '' ] ( http://gfx.aftonbladet-cdn.se/image/13653500/277/normal/169b3bb5603ca/kinapuff.jpg ) candy , which nobody gave a shit about until a single journalist complained over it and made them remove the logo . 
  i could care less , but i am not agreeing on oversensitive or self-gracious bloggers and journalists get their way . 
  they do n't even know hitler was austrian . 
  turkish press is really worsening as a whole too ... 
  `` growth '' means nothing for the average citizen anyway . 
  it 's simply just activity and larger gdp , which governments can use however they want with .
