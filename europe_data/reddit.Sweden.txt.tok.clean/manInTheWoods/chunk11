  the media , no . 
  as far as i can tell . 
  it 's been on the front page of all swedish media for almost a week now, 
  you 're telling me denmark is not in scandinavia ? 
  * sigh * http://satwcomic.com/new-nordic, 
  i once had a woman talking to me while waiting for the bus , in the middle of swedish nowhere . 
  first , i thought she was drunk , but turned out she was an american . 
  welcome into nordic !, 
  yes , but in which order ? 
  mmm . 
  could be drunk also . 
  friday afternoon ? 
  rudolf kalman , of the kalman filter ? 
  yes , the shelter seems crowded . 
  swedish politicians have since the seventies , been ( relatively speaking ) critical of israel . 
  palme was one of the first leaders to recognise palestine as a state . 
  i guess the right wing stance of israel and seeing israel as a `` little us '' did n't help . 
  you have to remember that sweden was very critical of the vietnam war , and against the us . 
  above is my interpretation , someone who studied the subject can correct me . 
  it 's not safe to be a jew in sweden ? 
  has there been attacks on jews lately ? 
  embarrassingly , i only recognise von neuman . 
  moron , silly , stupid . 
  you sure know how to argue a point . 
  no , you claimed it was at the same level as basic human rights . 
  it 's not , it 's below being abused . 
  it 's not , it 's below the basic human rights of not getting abused . 
  of course you survive , but the food you can grow and store is severly limited . 
  no , half will have below that , and half will have above that . 
  there 's no majority for either , and definitely no overwhelming majority . 
  yeah , looking out of my window here at the snow , i wonder why we do n't just eat what we can grow here ... 
   can not afford the `` average standard of living ''  can not afford what for an overwhelming majority of people is normal i sense a discrepancy . 
  is it the average or the majority ? 
  conscription is not for refugees , they decided to investigate it before this autumn . 
  no , not that either . 
  you can , and you just did . 
  conscription is not for the refugees . 
  yeah , i remember there was some contention . 
  looking for missing people , fire fighting , doing civil conscripts as nurse etc , was done when last sweden had conscripts . 
  building tents , setting up camp , crowd control would all be in line with that . 
  she said she would like both civilian and military conscription . 
  i do n't know what the investigation is looking at ( but i hope it 's both ) . 
  help with the organization of the reception . 
  presumably by those doing the civilian conscript . 
  because it was on the topic of conscription , at defence meeting . 
  in a swedish paper , it was also said this was her personal opinion , there 's an ongoing investigation into re-introducing conscription , and both civilian and military roles are considered , such as firefighting , searching missing people , natural disasters , cleaning beaches , etc. 
  in the case of refugees , she could see them help organising the footwork of reception . 
  yeah , that was n't me . 
  but according to the article , it is true if you compare debt to money mad after graduation . 
  which is interesting in itself . 
  i was n't even making a point , i was trying to explain were swedish student debt come from . 
  good for them !, 
  here 's the stat i found , btw : https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/average-swedish-student-debt-average-us-student-debt_chart-1.png?w=640 from this interesting article : http://qz.com/85017/college-in-sweden-is-free-but-students-still-have-a-ton-of-debt-how-can-that-be/, 
  no , i did n't take on debt to travel , i did it for the living expenses . 
  are you arguing with me why swedish students have a lot of debt ? 
  it seems we have left the subject of your initial claim . 
  i hope you picked up some geographical knowledge . 
  one straight has nato countries on both sides , the other has not . 
  because we borrow to cost of living . 
  my debt was $ 40k , the average in the us is around $ 25k i learnt yesterday . 
  so , i had enough money to take climbing trips to south of france , and a six week road trip in the us . 
  and yes , another climbing trip to the us . 
  how it varies over the years : https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z3vbc8cms39we74aooh4lalb7eqn19wx-7yzphl8l6s/pubchart?oid=5&amp;format=image most common destination : https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mx-iyiarbfcygicdyxwrqp21umavvxrmurfbw-vjix8/pubchart?oid=1843916426&amp;format=image, 
  last year about 3000 swedes emigrated to the us . 
  whatever , the fact is that even though mediterranean is bigger than the black sea , both has bottlenecks relevant to a carrier and naval operations . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/choke_point `` the most important naval choke points were first identified by john fisher in his defense of continued british colonialism '' ... * the turkish straits/bosporus linking the black sea ( and oil coming from the caspian sea region ) to the mediterranean ( turkey ) * the strait of gibraltar ( spain , gibraltar and morocco ) ... '' both are bottlenecks . 
  yes , it 's obvious from the map i linked . 
  and both of them has a bottleneck . 
  which is also obvious . 
  so , you 're right in the difference of size , and wrong in the matter of bottleneck . 
  which one has the bottleneck ? 
  i ca n't really tell ... https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/medelhavet#/media/file:mediterranean_sea_political_map-en.svg, 
  except you do : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_free_speech_exceptions, 
  very few leaving sweden do it as a political statement , i guess . 
  work abroad for a while is n't uncommon in multinational companies ( ericsson , abb , volvo , scania etc ), 
  so the talk about fascinating discussion was just words piled on top of eachother , bearing no meaning ? 
  if your idea of fascinating discussion is repeating `` i disagree with that opinion '' , i think i 'll pass . 
  of course . 
  it scales from < 1million to 80 million population . 
  but somehow , it stops scaling just before we reach the size of the us . 
  how convenient . 
  total population is almost always irrelevant . 
  most things scale pretty well . 
  can you imagine someone claiming `` we ca n't have a law enforcement system in the us , it 's sooo big '' ? 
  `` we ca n't have a tax system in the us it 's so big '' , `` we ca n't have national roads in the us , it 's so big '' ? 
  a good idea is a good idea , regardless of size of country . 
  * it varies a lot . 
  some painkillers cost eur10-20 for a pack . 
  have n't got anything stronger yet . 
  * efficient and correct , but sometimes a bit condescending unless you are definitely ill . 
  they do n't butter you up for the return business , that 's for sure . 
  * yes . 
  our oldest kid had neck surgery at seven ( arnold-chiari ) and has been treated regularly for 8 years ( scoliosis ) . 
  she 's fine now . 
  youngest had a eye surgery at five ( ? ) . 
  not a penny spent . 
  everything is free for kids and young adults . 
  we have to pay most of the cost of glasses for the youngest , though . 
  * no experience with the us system . 
  being upper middle class i 've chosen to add a private insurance for about 30eur/month .
