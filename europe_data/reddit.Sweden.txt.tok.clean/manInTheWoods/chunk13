  i see , where can i learn more ? 
  cooling compared to what ? 
  today 's temp , or average 1981 - ? 
  last i heard from the swedish meterologists , there was no indication there had been more storms so far , or that a rising temperature would lead to more storms . 
  it 's a natural specie , but not in norway . 
  sitka is more common in norway and scotland then in sweden . 
  sitka spruce is not so uncommon . 
  norwegian spruce ( picea abies ) one would hope . 
  you forgot the most important part , eating kebabpizza . 
  it was almost cut in half by russia . 
  so , if we keep our dams and burn our trees , maybe you could add some more wind farms ? 
  and we 'll maybe shut down ringhals too ? 
  reneawble energy also means hydro and biomass , these are more or equally reliable as non-renewable energy sources . 
  1809 never forget . 
  oh , come on . 
  are you saying sweden/finland has less reason to dislike the enemy from the east ? 
   that is n't really true , there are basically no restrictions on speech in the united states . 
   i fully acknowledged that there are technically some regulations on when and where you can say things in the united states . 
  it seems that you have changed your original stance . 
  so , there are different restrictions on free speech in the us and in france ? 
  is that your point ? 
  child pornography is for instance restricted in the us , even though no threat of violence is present . 
  the number were from another ipcc report . 
  http://srren.ipcc-wg3.de/report/ipcc_srren_ch02.pdf lots of info , ca n't tell why there is a difference . 
  enjoy !, 
  the point is that there are exceptions to free speech everywhere . 
  and yes , child pornography being outlawed is one such exception . 
  probably not , never heard of \u00c5rsg\u00e5ng ( but of the flowery stuff ) . 
  something like this . 
  a taste of everything .

  if you write an article and assume everybody already knows exactly what you are saying , the result is pointless . 
  i have n't followed the media closely in this matter , do you know what politician she refers to ? 
  can you tell me ? 
  what politician lied ? 
  what journalist lied ? 
  if that 's how you feel good journalism should be , you got the media you deserve . 
  she claims politicians said it was a world first . 
  no source that supports it . 
  that 's bad journalism . 
  she also says it was n't `` new '' , as that was a revelation . 
  in the original reporting it was stated that the clinic would now open * also * for men . 
  in short , she finds misconceptions from other sloppy reporting , and somehow blame swedish politicians for this . 
  do you follow now ? 
  yes , and that 's why it 's a bad article . 
  but did anyone in fact tell a lie or make a false statement ? 
  if so , who ? 
  what politician was wrong ? 
  it 's not the first clinic in the world , as previously stated . 
  that is a minor fact , that the journalist exaggerates the importance of . 
  i was underwhelmed by the writing and , think she exaggerates to drive home a point . 
  a point which i 'm not sure what it is . 
  roks are very anti-men , no surprise there . 
  edit : looking through some of her refs , i could not find a politician that claims it was a world first . 
  well , i do n't think that 's enough data to draw any conclusions . 
  yes , his health is worth more than your possessions . 
  the society prefer that every situation is de-escalated so that minimum physical harm is done . 
  the monetary aspect is then settled later . 
  and society does not look kindly on any vigilante tendencies . 
  hopefully the lack of boys in higher education leads to adaption of the learning process and/or incentives , instead of blaming the boys . 
  most bullies are boys ? 
  judging from what my daughters tell me , that 's not necessarily true . 
  what 's your source ? 
  looking at longer trends , say 20 years , the gdp/capita is increasing at about he same rate as our neighbours in western europe . 
  [ source ] ( https://www.google.se/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_cd&amp;idim=country:swe:nor:dnk&amp;hl=sv&amp;dl=sv#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_kd_zg&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:swe:fin:est:nor:deu:dnk:isl:nld:prt:esp:gbr:che:fra:irl&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tstart=819154800000&amp;tend=1418770800000&amp;hl=sv&amp;dl=sv&amp;ind=false ), 
  this is yearly growth . 
  if i remember correctly , on the green form there was one question you should answer yes to . 
  have they changed it now ? 
  there are more countries in the eu , you know . 
  is n't it within schengen only ? 
  not really , it 's still using violence to `` teach '' your child . 
  unemployed and students are n't in the workforce either . 
  should they be allowed to vote ? 
  changed a couple of years ago , yes . 
  it speaks my language . 
  well , this is a way of dealing with it . 
  increase the level of competitiveness as they grow older, 
  indeed , and perhaps we can make the stick with it for a year or two longer , if we let not just the best kids play . 
  are you gon na do something about it , or just whine about it ? 
  up to 13 . 
  no , this is the general trend in all youth sports for a long time . 
  that 's the same counter argument put forward when sweden outlawed corporal punishment on kids , almost 40 years ago . 
  it probably diminish the amount of parents who go `` let only the best players play , so we can get the bronze medal !!! '', 
  well , as long as 1 and 2 are the more common occurrence , the measure taken is a net positive . 
  very few kids get successful at all . 
  the idea is that youth sport is for everyone , not just those who are the best at age of 12 . 
  yes , that 's what the swedish sports organisations have figured out for a while now . 
  it 's not just football , there 's a general recommendation that below 12 , it 's basically playing . 
  kids are still developing both mentally and physically well into their teens . 
  if you teach young kids in sports , you realize a ) they want to have fun and spend time with their friends and b ) they already know who 's the best . 
  that 's an oddly , placed comma, 
  sorry , i thought i , as one of the `` highly educated employable and industrious people '' , must stay in the city ? 
   me\u00e4nkieli https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/me%c3%a4nkieli_dialects `` for political and historical reasons it has the status of a minority language in sweden . '', 
   speaking the language is required but the level required is not perfect . 
  so mostly you will succeed . 
  what languages counts ? 
  finnish , swedish , me\u00e4nkieli , ... ? 
  maybe , or the moving people bring money and people to the previously dying parts i finland . 
  and , having free time , they can be industrous in their own way . 
  it helps not living alone , i guess .
