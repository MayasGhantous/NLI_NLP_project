  when working at ericsson ( r&d ) , the first left for lunch at 1045 . 
  i myself was fashonably late at 1130 . 
  go ahead , give away . 
  no he did n't . 
  i 'm not talking legally , i 'm talking democratically . 
  majority rules , that how we use democracy . 
  and by majority in this case , it 's how a majority of the representative votes . 
  how is it not ? 
  if a majority of the parliament decides that they wont compromise , they are free to do so . 
  so , they need to double the people voting for theme pretty much . 
  and even so , a coalition with e.g. 
  40 % of the votes will rule . 
  well , you have a different system in the uk , i do n't know the details . 
  what do you consider a win election wise for sd ? 
  that 's what elections are for in a democracy . 
  if a party musters one fifth of the voters , they ca n't set the agenda on their own . 
  they need to co-operate . 
  yeah , if 20 % have a view that 80 % cant compromise on , that view wo n't hold . 
  that 's democracy . 
  no , it 's meant to show that breaking windows and repairing then is not a benefit for the economy . 
  it does not try to explain the reason for rasing or lowering gdp . 
  it does not say anything about raising gdp can be deceiving . 
  how does that compare to other countries ? 
  yes , 2007 was the highest gdp/capita so far according to your link , but 2015 is on track on becoming the new high . 
  howe does that compare with other countries ? 
  it 's 3.9 % since q3 ** 2014 ** . 
  it 's one year , not one quarter . 
  how much has the gdp/capita increased during the same period ? 
  i found the sentence that explains what the broken window fallacy means . 
  i also included a source , should you want to read more . 
  from where did you get that breaking and repairing windows increases gdp ? 
  because the money not spent on glazing would elsewise be spent on buying a new coat . 
  `` fallacy '' : a false or mistaken idea . 
  the broken windods fallacy is the mistaken idea that breaking and repairing windows increases productivity . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/parable_of_the_broken_window '' [ ... ] illustrate why destruction , and the money spent to recover from destruction , is ** not ** actually a net benefit to society . '', 
  ( my marking ), 
  brraking windows lowers the gdp , not hight ens it . 
  the fallacy is to think that breaking windows raises gdp . 
  populations is up 1 % for the same period ( preliminary ) . 
  population is up 1 % october 2014 to october 2015 ( preliminary ) . 
  http://www.scb.se/en_/finding-statistics/statistics-by-subject-area/population/population-composition/population-statistics/aktuell-pong/25795/monthly-statistics--the-whole-country/25896/ * befolkningen har v\u00e4xt 1 % oktober 2014 till oktober 2015 ( prelimin\u00e4rt ) *, 
  sweden was missing in the eurostat posted here previously . 
  now , the numbers are official . 
  what do you mean ? 
  i do n't think you have to leave this subreddit to find that sentiment . 
  so , why do n't you also write in english ? 
  why not ? 
  i hope more people will do the same . 
  do you often need to go for 12 hours without stopping ? 
  your link states that there are one for civilian and one for military . 
  can you listen to both ? 
  not that i think the russian would have used radio . 
  because religion is important to a lot of people . 
  it would also be strange to allow schools devoted to one religion , but not another . 
  that would be hockey . 
  * de e hockey !, 
  oh come on , everybody knows germany bad , us good . 
  history 101 really . 
  thank you !, 
  yeah , i figured as much . 
  but a rough translation of the text in the image would be nice . 
  translation , please ? 
   we bitch and moan about the dirt , asymmetries , inefficiencies and infunctionalities on almost a daily basis . 
  and then you fix it ? 
   seriously fucking confused sums her up , i believe . 
  the original jul-rapp !, 
  and here 's the movie : http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1764275/, 
  [ party ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysze4qwruki ), 
  [ who we are ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhldb9aosu ), 
  [ money ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leroqhsemme ), 
  [ who we became ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oewwzqqbps ), 
  they probably did . 
  but , nobody cares to check back in 15 years and set the record straight . 
  so , you 're safe to predict imminent doom . 
  thank you for your thorough reply !, 
  no , but the taxes of denmark are n't paid by the companies in as large amount as sweden . 
  total taxation is about the same . 
  these numbers depend heavily on who pays what . 
  repeatedly hitting your kid , even when told not to and possibly receiving help , * is * a good reason . 
  i do n't think bio or adpoted makes any difference in cases like this . 
   yeah but the question is what 's best for the kid ? 
  being slapped some is likely not as detrimental for the kid as being separated from parents that actually care for them . 
  parents who rather hit their kids and risk getting them taken , than stop hitting their kids is probably not the kind of parent a kid needs . 
  as evident in this thread , race is always coming up as a subject . 
  `` you would n't do this to me if i were white !, 
  '' , etc. 
  possibly they have a few whites in there , too . 
  basic demographic and infrastructure obstacles are n't unique to the us . 
  every country has them , albeit different for each . 
  if that means you ca n't see similarities between countries , you 're missing out on a lot of alternative ways of doing things . 
  yes , the special snowflake theory . 
  can be used to explain anything and everything , if you try hard enough . 
  you forgot to mention that the experts have been talking about imminent doom in the housing market for at least 15 years . 
  more and more of city centers are becoming car-free . 
  your `` personal freedom '' in a city is very limited as is , but this at least increases the freedom for walkers and bikers . 
   there 's way less energy in our garbage than we need however . 
  any significant biomass contribution will include the mass growing of biofuel crops , with consequences for people and environment . 
  everything has consequences , both nuclear and biomass . 
  the studies from 2013 and 2011 had the same value for nuclear , so that ca n't be it . 
  no heat from the nuclear plants is used for heating in sweden .
