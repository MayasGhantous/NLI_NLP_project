  and , when something gets popular in sweden , it gets really popular . 
  bag-in-box ftw . 
  close , but no cigar . 
  the lgbt activists are ruining your culture !, 
  well played , bror . 
  never heard of . 
  i was expecting calvin . 
  he 's barely remembered now , unfortunately . 
  great player . 
  nah , they could have said vidkun q for norway . 
  and maybe g ii a for sweden . 
  what is the source ? 
  yup , * can * does n't imply you * like to * . 
  you are , if you live at home , work and do n't help out with the finances . 
  no , 16 is the lowest . 
  even though a majority of states have 16 , `` less than 50 % of the u.s. population resides in states which set the age of consent at 16 '' https://en.wikipedia.or/wiki/ages_of_consent_in_the_united_states yours truly , smug european, 
  you mean sharia ? 
  i think she believes we have common law in sweden .

  i did . 
  the court is not involved , as this was never taken to court . 
  the prosecutor did n't take it to court . 
  what more do you want to know ? 
  1 ) the court was n't involved at all . 
  2 ) maybe you should check out how it works , before you assume ? 
  a case of irnbru . 
  the court has n't done anything . 
  maybe you should read the article ? 
  yes , specific kind of groups . 
  it 's not a hate crime to shout `` kill all mechanics ! '' . 
  `` kill all danes '' might be , though . 
  but lefse ? 
  do n't worry , we got your back !, 
  a solution could be for the finns to invade and annex the required area . 
  after some diplomatic turmoil , they could sign a peace agreement giving rightful clay . 
  i hope you 're kidding ? 
  for the winner !, 
  as soon as the child is born , it has rights . 
  it 's no longer a man and a woman , it 's a man and a woman and a child . 
  neither of the parents can waive their rights , regardless if they wanted the child or changed their mind . 
  that 's why the idea of `` legal abortion '' is flawed . 
  it does not protect the right of the child . 
  ok , honestly , to what organisation did that $ 50 finally find its way ? 
  the cheese and the alps . 
  you 're right , less co2 per kwh is emitted for gas . 
  bigger difference than i thought , actually . 
  alos more methane is spewed in the gas supply chain . 
  hydro , wind , solar , biomass , waste . 
  there are other options . 
  is it possible to convert them to burning wooden pellets ? 
  or other biomass ? 
  does n't make a difference if it 's the co2 you 're concerned about . 
  ( google translate from http://www.etc.se/inrikes/svensk-polis-dodar-flest ) january 2013 \u2022 a robber in sodertalje shot in the head by police since he directed what looked like an automatic weapon at the police . 
  the man died later in hospital .

  may 2013 \u2022 a 69-year old man in husby was shot by police after he threatened a man and brandishing a knife from his apartment .

  i fond this on the swedish police web : year 2010\u00a02011\u00a02012\u00a02013 2014 2015 deceased 0 1 0 4 3 2, 
  most people differentiate between humans and other animals . 
  based on ethnicity ? 
  like in norway , every swede 's taxable income is public info . 
  not available on the net , though , you have to go to or call a tax office . 
  completely anonymous . 
  there 's also `` taxeringskalender '' , a book published ( by private entity ) listing everyones income and taxable wealth . 
   edit : ratsit.se and others have made this info available on the net , with certain restrictions . 
  swedish , finish and russians wolves . 
  they are not isolated , they interbreed, 
  it wo n't , there are a lot of that specie in europe . 
  was there ever a difference ? 
  it 's the same specie . 
  here 's a movie about ( part of ) the conflict . 
  they breed with swedish wolves . 
  both sweden and norway have once killed off all wolves , and yet they are back . 
  most sheep deaths in sweden are from the butcher . 
  because they eat the sheep and dogs . 
  til my country has changed . 
  indeed . 
  so writing 1.9 m would be perfectly understandable , but 1.9 m is not . 
  well , the fact that so many was confused by the * 1.9 m * leads me to believe you are wrong . 
  we flew to the moon in 1969 . 
  what choices ? 
  well , you claimed `` never '' . 
  it appears that you were wong , and it is even * common * usage in some parts of the brittish society . 
   when was the last time somebody said `` megapounds '' or `` megaeuros '' or `` megadollars '' and i linked to a brittish financial report that said megaeuros/meur . 
  so , quite recently . 
  there are many more , google is your friend . 
  so , you 're questioning not economical dogmas , but the idea of society and taking care of our fellow man ? 
  very edgy . 
  well , we use msek and kkr ( kilokronor ) all the time . 
  the fact that some countries refuse to learn the si system is unfortunate .
