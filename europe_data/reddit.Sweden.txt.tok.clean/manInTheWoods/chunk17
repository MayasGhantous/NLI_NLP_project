  there 's a lot of meur in financial reports etc. 
  example : http://www.investegate.co.uk/capman-oyj/gnw/capman-plc-group-s-interim-report--1-january------/20110811063100h7802/, 
  no , m is short for mega ( million ) while m is short for meter . 
  not being the same thing , is the reason so many people misunderstood . 
  it explains that the `` wise man '' who was quoted was the president of china . 
  stupid people , you ca n't even buy there vote . 
  that 's not a requirement for a refugee , it not dependent on what paperwork you supply where , but the actual state of your home country . 
  1.9 m then . 
  ha , had you said that 10-15 years ago in sweden , the right wing would throw rocks at you . 
  back then , the east europeans were job-stealing scum . 
  here 's some history for you . 
  it 's not about growing , its about stop shrinking . 
  this ha nothing to do with current economical dogmas , but if you want 1 person to take care of 10 unable to provide for themselves , you 're not setting them up for a very good old age . 
  that they 'd select a couple of percent of the elligable people . 
  i guess you did n't read the article , after all ? 
  that 's why you talk to a psychologist before getting conscripted . 
  why do you want to build a defense on disenfranchised youth ? 
  having normal members of the normal public lends more credibility to the service . 
  it appears to be a popular suggestion , earlier this year 72 % of swedes were in favour , and 16 % against , in a poll . 
  http://www.di.se/artiklar/2016/1/4/majoritet-vill-aterinfora-varnplikt/?p=13 ** google translate ** the elderly are most beneficial to reintroduce conscription , but also in the age group 18 to 29 , there is a majroritet for . 
  on the issue of women and men should be taken out of conscription introduced responding 87 percent yes . 
  `` even if it 's fuzzy formulated so get it strong support . 
  i still think the result shows that there is a great popular commitment to the idea of military service , '' said david aglin , opinion director at ipsos , told dagens nyheter . 
  conscription was abolished in 2010 and replaced by a professional military . 
  but today , missing half the war organization , about 7,500 soldiers , sailors and squad leaders . 
  the new system has also become more expensive than planned . 
  even then it was a clear majority , 63 per cent of the population , against conscription was abolished and the decision by three votes margin in parliament . 
  `` during those years before conscription avskffades was the general trend that the defense was renovated down and we went to more peaceful times . 
  it was a very different mood for not many years ago , '' said david ahlin , opinion director at ipos , the daily news . 
  since last autumn an ongoing government investigation of the model used by both denmark and norway , where both employees soldiers and duty soldiers used . 
  formally conscription dormant which means it could be reinstated if the security situation deteriorates . 
  you 're correct . 
   to me , it 's about the degree that liberty and rights are violated . 
  so , you accept slavery to a degree ? 
  it 's a small loss * volunteering * a year to military training , to the great gains we have with a stable government . 
  defending a country from invasion is a bit different than sending specialized troops on a mission in foreign land . 
  those most eager to kill is n't perhaps the best suited to have weapons ? 
  and the police is a state-sponsored fascist mob !, 
  you have to have citizenship , so the demographics for drafting has n't changed with the refugees . 
  ** google translate says : ** the proposal provides military training for both women and men introduced a few years , according to swedish newspaper svenska dagbladet . 
  inquiry was appointed by the government for less than a year ago with the mission to provide suggestions on how the armed forces will eventually have a sustainable supply of staff . 
  the defense should be according to the commission 's directive to continue `` based mainly on voluntary , but where an increased use of total defense duty complements the voluntary nature of war when the organization 's needs can not be secured by purely voluntary recruitment '' . 
  according to the swedish newspaper svenska dagbladet , the work is almost done and will be cleared in the next week and presented at the end of september . 
  already in 2017 the country 's 17-year-olds to fill in a questionnaire as a basis for future sample to muster , writes swedish newspaper svenska dagbladet . 
  the people would then be called for enrollment of recruitment agency in 2018 and the military service to be running again 2019th a few thousand people in each cohort of around 100,000 people will be taken out of military service . 
  women and men on equal terms the committee 's proposals are gender neutral . 
  women and men pattern on equal terms without quota system . 
  the investigator annika nordgren christensen , former defense politician and member of parliament for the green party , want not currently comment on the investigation results . 
  - my proposal is presented at the end of september when the investigation referred to the government and i commented then . 
  if you read the directive , it is clear , however , which way it leans because they are clear , she says to aftonbladet . 
  although conscription reintroduced , the voluntary recruitment remain . 
  eh , close enough . 
  pasta and ketchup , the staple of my poor student years . 
  woho , sweden not rape capital anymore !, 
  what did i just watch ?? 
  good squatting , though . 
  can not into nordic !, 
  but seriously , context ? 
  the question was the oldest living thing , which a root system is . 
  more info in birmignham mail . 
  people i known do this , and it 's reasonable to believe other people do likewise . 
  at least comparing to the alternative explanation . 
  do you believe otherwise ? 
  it 's one of the reason other people - that still remain recognizable - do it . 
   well , celebrities do that to deliberately hide their identity from the public to make them more passable in normal everyday life . 
  i doubt that 's reason behind it , it 's probably more that they do n't want people to see their eyes and putting up an imaginary shield . 
  wrong with a factor of 9 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/old_tjikko, 
  like the danish `` immigrants '' in the 90s . 
  it 's a way to take a step back from the surroundings , compare with the sunglasses a lot of celebrities wear . 
  it 's more dehumanizing to strip people than to cover them up . 
  the absolute horror !, 
  from * ireland * ? 
  i think you got me mixed up with someone else . 
  this `` article '' is trash , regardless . 
  pretty obvious when reading the `` article '' . 
  which swedes ? 
  there are quite a few swedes with estonian roots . 
  it depends on your family , not your nationality . 
  we do not make any difference between the finns with swedish heritage and those without, 
  in sweden it refers often to people living in the baltic states . 
  we normally do n't differentiate between ethnicity , only countries . 
  balt is used for peopel living in the baltic countries . 
  `` baltutl\u00e4mningen '' , for instance , was when we returned refuges to the three baltic countries . 
  they are often to us , actually . 
  hmm , balts into nordic ? 
  who 'd want a fake country ? 
  did the assaulters were burqas ? 
  the list is incorrect , only two swedish medals have been returned due to doping . 
  the third , ara abrahamian was due to the folloing events : '' after he received his medal at the ceremony , he calmly shook the hand of the presenter and then the hand of the other bronze medal winner . 
  he then stepped off the podium and placed the medal in the center of the wrestling mat and left the ceremony . 
  [ 7 ] [ 8 ] abrahamian complained later about the corrupt judges and declared that he was retiring from the sport . 
  abrahamian says that the judges had been bribed , and reminded that the judge through marriage is related to rapha\u00ebl martinetti , the president of fila , the governing body of wrestling . '', 
  `` the international olympic committee held a `` disciplinary hearing '' on abrahamian after the incident , [ 10 ] where it was decided that abrahamian would be disqualified and excluded from the olympic games due to `` violating the spirit of fair play '' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ara_abrahamian#medal_ceremony, 
  your link does not support your earlier statement . 
  which skews the statistics quite a bit . 
   making the overall statistic complete nonsense . 
  as is all internaitonal crime stat , basically . 
  maybe homicide is the best shot , but it still varies a lot . 
   in sweden , if a girl is drunk and get 's laid , she can have you done for rape . 
  that 's a fact .
