  we import all our oil , but that does n't mean we 're particularly poor . 
  i thought the merchantile theory was as good as dead ? 
  there are also people who think that it does n't matter who they pay to fill the pool with electricty , `` becasue its 's all the same electrons anyway '', 
  but why must a country produce and consume the same amount of energy ? 
  we do n't think that way with food or other resources . 
  buy renewables or burn biomass imported from elsewhere ( sweden , please ) . 
  which really does n't matter as you make sure the water filling the pool is renewable . 
  it 's the production you pay for , not the consumption . 
  yes , by about 0,5 % compared to sweden . 
  fifa rankings are crap . 
  breaking it down to per capita is even crappier . 
  i visited south karelia recently ( jukola-viesti ) and there 's a brand new ( ? ), 
  highway from helsinki . 
  unfortunately , not a russian truck in sight . 
  i bet that part of the country took at massive hit ? 
  if you ask nicely ... ? 
  and order paper ( support swedish pulp industry !, 
  ) : `` only 1 free publication per title and up to 20 different titles per order are allowed . 
  to order more please contact us or the eu info point in your country . '', 
  i suspect there 's a lot of volunteers involved in the olympics . 
  it 's not easy to get the same support if it 's more than once in a lifetime . 
  i also have a feeeling it will be pretty bland the third/fopurth time around in the same city . 
  luckily we get all the water we need from above . 
  for lunch ? 
  breakfast , yes . 
  but lunch ? 
  it 's a good idea , or many countries would n't be in the eu in the first place . 
  it works for chosing our leaders , it works for all our referenda . 
  manufactured by lots of companies , the patent expired in 2000 . 
   a single majority vote to decide the probably biggest and most complex issue with massive irreversible consequences the uk will ever face for a generation . 
  just like we did . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_european_union_membership_referendum,_1994 there 's a lot of close calls : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/referendums_related_to_the_european_union, 
  narrowly beat norway . 
  phew !, 
  unless wealth is distributed . 
  `` only '' , 
  are n't belarus close to a dictatorship ? 
  do you want us to walk across the ice again ? 
  my land rover defender suggests otherwise . 
  ... and of brittish quality ? 
  your not against accepting refugees , and yet you want to send back refugees from your doorstep , because they did n't flee death and despair through proper channels ? 
  i sounds a bit contradictory . 
  yeah , i see . 
  you do n't want to accept refugees in your country . 
  your earlier points about refugees versus immigrants was just for show , you do n't care about the difference . 
  as long as they are not dying on your doorstep . 
  so they should go back to their war torn countries and talk to their non-existent government ? 
  so it should be some other countries problem unless you decide they are refugees ? 
  so , the actual refugees that has fled from a war , and washed up on your shore , would you send them back into a war zone because they did n't follow procedure ? 
  or would you screen them and receive them as the refugees they are ? 
  for that you have to process and decide which is which . 
  and that 's what happening now in europe . 
  so , you suggest exactly what we are doing right now . 
  was n't sure for the exact number . 
  have uk friends who have been livin here for 20 years or so . 
  i 'm suggesting they 'll get a swedish passport . 
  i do n't think sweden does . 
  because one would n't want to be in a military alliance with a country always involved in a war ? 
  i prefer czechinia . 
  are n't toursim a big component of their economy ? 
  would n't that improve by being in the eu ? 
  of course , a lot of tourists come from england/wales . 
  they voted against ? 
  [ google translate ] ( https://translate.google.se/translate?hl=sv&amp;sl=sv&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.dn.se%2fnyheter%2fsverige%2fbadhus-som-forbjuder-toplessbad-riskerar-kritik%2f ) tl : dr person that define itself as intersex reported that it was discriminated against when required to wear a top at indoor swimming pool . 
  authorities agreed , swimming pool has now changed the rules . 
  this will probably apply to all swimming pools in sweden . 
  finland is an eu country . 
  yup , we always speak english with our danish colleagues . 
  sad but true . 
  yes , the swedish feminazis scare the entire population to answer polls against their better judgement !, 
  sure , we can come on down and anschluss your ass again . 
  living off the land , as is customary . 
   your languages sound somewhat similar mutually unintelligible . 
  you could n't write it any more unclear !, 
  they have upgraded and improved efficiency of the current old ones , i guess it will be some larger upgrades/rebuilding in the future . 
  only for replacing the old ones , so no increase really . 
  so , what about the shoe at the right ? 
  yeah , and you get that impression from reddit ? 
  if you look at the individual components , sweden fares better than denmark when it comes to freedom of the press . 
  that 's not related to corruption at all . 
  well , in this case some of the variables were n't really objective , but based on a questionnaire, 
  in the article : `` the index , the researchers claim , measures corruption through objective variables , instead of relying on the perception of corruption levels in a country . '', 
  i just want to clarify that it does n't make it an objective index . 
  edit : especially when the components relies on indices built on questionnaires . 
  the weighting on different measurements to compose an index is not on objective grounds . 
  read it now , thanks for the detailed info . 
  found a better source this time , with an unambigous title . 
  here 's google translate of a couple of swedish papers : https://translate.google.se/translate?sl=sv&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=sv&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.dn.se%2fekonomi%2fmm-forbjuds-i-sverige%2f&amp;edit-text= https://translate.google.se/translate?hl=sv&amp;sl=sv&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.dagensmedia.se%2fmarknadsforing%2fm-vinner-i-domstol-over-m-m-s-6578238, 
  what was he convicted for , was it hate speech or more physical crimes ? 
  the title i linked is misleading , as you can see if you read the article . 
  the title i linked is misleading , as you can see if you read the article . 
  source in swedish says it 's banned . 
  http://www.dn.se/ekonomi/mm-forbjuds-i-sverige/ it is currently banned after two courts ruled against it . 
  they can appeal to h\u00f6gsta domstolen . 
  they are not likely to consider it , i think . 
  check again , the tax rate is 22 % . 
  old article , and we 're still here . 
  still alive , and not torn apart . 
  an article without any information on how much the shareholders got compared to the taxes that were paid ? 
  or any mention about previous year 's losses which generate a tax credit ?
