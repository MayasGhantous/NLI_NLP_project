  so , where do you get your information from , and can we trust it ? 
  in polish tree death camps ? 
   for anyone else confused wasp means women airforce service pilots and not white anglo-saxon protestants , in this context . 
  had me wondering . 
  i guess wasp is n't used nowadays , is it ? 
   not really - eugenics arose in the us , the uk , canada , australia , and germany at about the same time . 
  hey , i think you forgot us !, 
  only those funded entirely or in part by the public . 
  the ** reports ** has increased 25 % . 
  the most common form is through social media . 
  here 's the report from the police ( in swedish ) : https://polisen.se/global/www%20och%20intrapolis/%c3%96vriga%20rapporter/lagesbild%20over%20sexuella%20ofredanden.pdf, 
  polar bears . 
  so , norwegians also learn finnish while on the toilet ? 
  ferry employees around the baltic sea tend not to be the most joyful people . 
  that 's me experience from denmark - sweden and finland - sweden . 
  probably depending on high volume , low cost mode of travel . 
  also boozed up passengers . 
  well , sk\u00e5ne is a recent acquisition ... 
  [ you forgot the most commie of all the blocks ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@57.7397433,12.0282109,3a,75y,260.64h,91.87t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1spj01lqtovfo_xtwen_zghq!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en ), 
   considering no actual laws have been broken by these companies , are you sure about that ? 
  tax law is seldom clear cut . 
  if you are close to the grey area , it 's not easy to tell which side you 're on . 
  that 's why there is an enquiry , of course . 
  it 's not skirt , it 's a kilt !, 
  thanks , i did n't know that . 
  i do n't support bringing nuclear weapons into swedish territory . 
  especially not foreign ones . 
  swedish sub manufacturer to the automotive industry have done this for a long time . 
  especially small plastic parts . 
  they can compete with short lead times , good quality and easy to work with . 
  here 's a couple of examples : * http://www.ad-plast.se/ * http://www.orionplast.se/ * http://www.plastinject.se/ * http://www.gela.se/sv/hem.aspx * http://aqg.se/sv/plast/aq-plast * http://www.ebaplast.se/ all these are from anderstorp , a village of 5.000 people . 
  that 's good to now . 
  how about passing vessels , can we get a guarantee they do n't contain nuclear weapons ? 
  so , will we possibly harbour us nuclear weapons now ? 
   it 's only modern monoculture `` productive '' forests that are very suspectible to diseases . 
  that 's provable false . 
  fraxinus excelsior is almost being wiped out in europe , due to hymenoscyphus fraxineus . 
  it 's being attacked regardless if it 's in a `` monocultured forest '' ( * ) or not . 
  ( * ) if it exists for ash , not here at least . 
  i do n't think a person with an arrest warrant should be able to run and hide , and then claim he/she is illegally detained . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7ganyc2v0g the drywall is a part of the design , making the wall strong . 
  wooden panel is often attached outside . 
  this has been tested/implemented many times over the years . 
  total cost for employer always go up . 
  no , outer walls also . 
  it 's like a safety regulation , though . 
  just as you ca n't make a choice to work with unsafe chemicals or other dangerous practices . 
  wood is warmer in the winter , easy to use and plentiful up north . 
  that 's why we use it in sweden . 
  no , it 's not . 
  constructions like the us are common in northern europe . 
  sweden have almost all drywall in single homes . 
  https://www.flottsundsbygg.se/upload/referensobjekt/losvirkeshus-sallinge/losvirkeshus-sallinge-6.jpg typical swedish single home . 
  since many years , swedish homes are almost always built with wooden frame and drywall . 
  i expect norway/finland do the same ? 
  glorious gulf stream . 
  it 's cute how concerned some reddit circle jerkers are about the state of sweden . 
  there is consensus among researcher of crime , that making international comparison is very hard at best , but mostly just meaningless . 
  because we have already surpassed the goal . 
  it was set in 2007 . 
   would sign this !, 
  i made the same obseravation , northern germans are much more like scandanavians - whereas bavarians are more similar to austrians !, 
  plattdeutsch is almost comprehensible to a swede . 
  architecture in denmark is distinct from swedish , except in sk\u00e5ne ( brick and mortar , as opposed to wood panel ) . 
  landscape in denmark is distinct from swedish , except in sk\u00e5ne ( rolling hills of farmlands , as opposed to forest with farmland ) . 
  language is incomprehensible , as opposed to norwegian and finlandssvenska . 
  yeah , you live in stockholm . 
  on the other side of the coast , we have/had a lot of norwegians coming to g\u00f6teborg to study or live . 
  seeing as bohusl\u00e4n was practically norway a few years back , and still the northern part ( str\u00f6mstad ) see a lot of norwegians business . 
  further south , sk\u00e5ne and denmark have close ties . 
  so , depending on where you live , the country with the most common culture can be finland , norway or denmark . 
  meanwhile in sweden : during 2014 we produced more electricity with nuclear , hydro and wind than we used . 
  fossil fuel ( coal , oil , gas ) was about 3 % of electricity generation . 
  export was 10 % of total . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/electricity_sector_in_sweden clean energy milestone achieved , i 'd say . 
  some of our pulp mills sell more electricity ( heated by saw dust and bark ) than they use . 
  it 's in the bottom right !, 
  free farmers basically , and elected kings . 
  http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sp.ado.tfrt rest of world . 
  liberal jew bad , right-wing jew good ? 
  sounds easy enough . 
  i 'm told that the word `` financier '' means `` dirty capitalist jew '' in english context . 
  it 's a strict no-no . 
  are you the author ? 
  did you spend time there yourself ? 
  very interesting pictures , thank you !, 
  ok , here 's a factual and easily verifiable quote on unodc 's web about crime statistics . 
  `` in the case of some categories of violent crime - ** such as rape ** or assault - country to country comparisons may simply be ** unreliable and misleading ** . '', 
  ( my bolding ) https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/compiling-and-comparing-international-crime-statistics.html please , read that page . 
  the fact is that it 's pretty much impossible to compare crime statistics between countries . 
  sweden does not collect statistics based on religion or ethnicity . 
  it 's not registered at all . 
  within a relationship , for instance . 
  it 's often people that are close to each other that are involved . 
  60 % of the median is far from tail end , or extreme . 
  especially if the median is a middle class full time worker . 
  then we shiould ban a lot of things , like mobile phones . 
  we do n't have that level of knowledge for many - if any - products . 
  would n't a country with 95 % low class workers and 5 % high class rentiers have low relative poverty ? 
  `` usually , relative poverty is measured as the percentage of the population with income less than some fixed proportion of median income . '',
