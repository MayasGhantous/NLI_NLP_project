  yes , maybe we should stick to the un definition that sweden has agreed to follow . 
  they are refugees because they are unsafe in their home country . 
  `` the 1951 convention protects refugees . 
  it defines a refugee as a person who is outside his or her country of nationality or habitual residence ; has a well-founded fear of being persecuted because of his or her race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or political opinion ; and is unable or unwilling to avail him -- or herself of the protection of that country , or to return there , for fear of persecution ( see article 1a ( 2 ) ) . '', 
  http://www.unhcr.org/4ec262df9.html they do n't stop being refugee the minute they step into foreign country . 
  i think you 're mixing up how to define a refugee , and how one should treat them . 
  you do n't stop becoming a refugee when you reach a safe place . 
  so , i was opening a thread about uk and the first i read is `` swedistan , hue hue '' . 
  no , the whole concept of refuge is to flee to safety . 
  some prefer to rerturn , some prefer to stay . 
  just like previous waves of refugees . 
  itt : the same sarcastic comments as in every other thread about sweden . 
  how original . 
  `` plantations '' sound very slavery . 
  i prefer to be called `` tree farmer '' . 
  do n't they report the yearly area of clear cutting as forestry loss ? 
  i think i 've heard something similar for us . 
  gib back clay !, 
  what part , midwest ? 
  unfortunately , museums outside stockholm must charge an admission , because they do n't get free money from the state . 
  they still have the death penalty in the us . 
  the state decides who deserves to die . 
  in the us the state can kill you for actions * they * deem to be politically incorrect . 
  `` what now about isis and sweden * sigh * '' was my reaction . 
  as a swede , i feel the same way . 
  yeah , to prevent child brides sweden recently uped the age to 18 in 2014 , no exceptions . 
  it 's strange that we should get flak for this , seeing as we 're kind of leading the way here . 
  well , that 's alarming . 
  luckily it 's not allowed here . 
  no , it 's probably not in the middle . 
  new hampshire allows 13 year olds to marry , for instance . 
  but still , it 's allowed in their own nation . 
  it 's probably marriages setup and ok : ed by their parents , and participants . 
  which of course is legal also in delaware . 
  so why are americans upset over something that would be legal in the us ? 
  apparently it 's 18 in delaware , but 16 if the other party is below ** 30 ** . 
  the age for getting marriage in texas is 14 . 
  looking for a child bride ? 
  they are not underage for sex , only for marriage . 
  fucking 15 year old has been awwwwright for a long time in sweden . 
  `` in january , after reports by swedish radio , authorities said that at least 70 girls under 18 were married in asylum centers run by municipalities including stockholm and malmo . '', 
  child brides include those above 16 but below 18 . 
  the age 14 is not in the article . 
  it 's about girls below 18 , and in 10 cases ( in norway ) below 16 . 
  nowhere is this tolerated below the age of 15 , as it says in the article . 
  in many western countries you can marry at 15 , and in your country at 16 . 
  yeah , that 's why i was stating 17/19 . 
  do n't know the detailed rules , if delaware have an exception for similar ages . 
  not marrying a woman ? 
  it seems this practice is a bit dated . 
  it 's an ebu-wide ban , not only eurovision . 
  includes right to certain sporting events , for instance . 
  op 's linked article refers to child brides in the age-range 15-18 . 
  no , it 's not allowed . 
  changed in 2014 . 
  previously exceptions could be made , but not anymore . 
  child brides are legal in romania ( 16 ) , but not in sweden ( 18 ) . 
  age of consent is 15 in both countries . 
  what does that mean , practically ? 
  it 's not possible to marry below 18 in sweden , what should/could happen when the scottish couple visits sweden ? 
  actually , sweden does not tolerate people below 18 to marriage , unlike the us ( and most of the western world ) . 
  in the us , with parental consent , child brides are legal from 15/16 years ( nh even lower ) . 
  delaware minors can get married from 16 with parental consent , but not have sex until they are 18 ( i find this hilarious ) . 
  most countries in europe has 15/16 years with court and/or parental consent . 
  sweden is an exception , there 's no way to marriage under age of 18 ( new law since 2014 ) . 
  age of consent is 15 . 
  so , should a 17/19 married couple from us ( e.g. ), 
  on their honeymoon to sweden ( unlikely , i know ) be able to share a hotel room ? 
  or should we charge the husband of child abuse ? 
  they can of course fuck like bunnies , as they are over 15 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marriageable_age, 
  i do n't know ... rinded swiss class is dominated by the swiss ( duh !, 
  ) , but the rindless swiss class has no swiss contestants . 
  it totally depends where you 're from , and how much of the langage you have been subjected to . 
  justice should be equal for all guilty , and should be dealt with according to law . 
  the less emotional , the better . 
  this is correct , treat him dispassionately and according to our standard , not his . 
  male or female ? 
  `` for instance , while just 30 % in the u.s. think sex between unmarried adults is morally unacceptable ... '' ** just ** 30 % . 
  travel for us citizens have n't changed . 
  cost of living has n't gone up . 
  there 's no impact in sweden for the day-to-day stuff . 
  on the computer , of course . 
  pay attention !, 
  yes , pretty much . 
  would you take offence if someone said that . 
  i would not . 
  no , it 's not . 
  she made a mistake , chosing the wrong word . 
  a person that misspoke . 
  how shocking !, 
  she said she was referring to the discussion in sweden and the islamophobic reactions , not the attack itself . 
  she was n't describing the attack as an accident . 
  she was describing the discussion afterwards in sweden , not the attack itself . 
  definitely tourism . 
  and it 's probably some influence from us latino pop . 
  after swedish and english ( minimum 7 years ) , it 's actually spanish that is the most popular language to study . 
  it has overtaken german in the last decade or so . 
  he was probably already ~ ~ leeched on ~ ~ been taken care of by our welfare state . 
   because calling a planned violent attack against civilian targets an `` accident '' she did n't , that 's not what she said according to svt.se . 
  olycka -  accident olyckligt -  unfortunate i guess the later interpretation makes more sense .
