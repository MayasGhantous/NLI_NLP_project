  source ? 
  scb has the largest poll of them all they interview 9000 people . 
  yes , sd gained a lot , but now they are dropping some . 
  still , less than < 20 % http://www.scb.se/hitta-statistik/statistik-efter-amne/demokrati/partisympatier/partisympatiundersokningen-psu/pong/tabell-och-diagram/partisympatier-psu/valresultatet-om-det-varit-val-idag-tidsserie/, 
  sweden < 20 % http://www.scb.se/hitta-statistik/statistik-efter-amne/demokrati/partisympatier/partisympatiundersokningen-psu/pong/statistiknyhet/partisympatiundersokningen-psu-i-november-2016--partisympatier/, 
  sure , but i was referring to what is right , not what is easy . 
  well , the post title did n't specify nato , but other european armies . 
  for me , co-operation outside nato makes more sense . 
  only 61 % for gay marriage . 
  compare that with `` same rights '' , which can also include adoption and other controversial subjects . 
  cyprus is a good comparison . 
  or greece . 
  oh come , on sweden 30 years ago would n't be on the top half of this chart . 
  give it time . 
  yeah , spain can into nordic !, 
  ca n't be , we are more greener than them !, 
  interesting question , is the entire city of berlin lumped with east germany ? 
   here is a clear huge difference between the two sides of the ` iron curtain ' there is a very minor difference between east and west germany . 
  and sort on dark green only !, 
   yeah , secular homophobia is odd . 
  what do you mean , 40 years ago sweden was very secular and definitely more homophobic than today ? 
  being non-religious does n't make you a saint ( pun intended ) . 
  yet , there 's a lot of reports of finding gay ... activities in the animal kingdom . 
  so , why should that matter to humans ? 
  so , what about finland ? 
  half-nordic ? 
  they could n't protect fishing and farming in the same way if they were in eu . 
  so , this is only co-operation within nato ? 
  which was after the invasion of norway . 
  of course , we moved nazi troops * from * norway to fight with you guys in northern finland . 
  too bad , you might have learnt something . 
  no , the nazis took over norway all on their own , without help from sweden . 
  the allied was also about to invade norway , but was a bit late to the party and had n't even got there in the first place . 
  curre lindstr\u00f6m is not honorary finnish ? 
  so you imagine that those who do n't share your view would think/speak in a certain way , and that upsets you ? 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/sand-covered_church https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/r%c3%a5bjerg_mile this is what will happen , i guess . 
  so , routsi should be listed before suomi ? 
  let 's go for `` nordic master race '' then ? 
  no , too tainted ? 
  instead of blaming the winners , start working on your completely non-free society instead . 
  also , why not sort by country size ? 
  consistently ? 
  i do n't know if that makes it better . 
  in your source denmark was also above sweden in gdp ( for 2013 - 2015 ) . 
  so , will they be below sweden in aic for 2017 also ? 
  btw , i 'm also surprised about denmark 's low number . 
   why do you think all the scandies are moving to london ? 
  * [ citation needed ] *, 
  i have never heard of these guys or their index before . 
  the book is from a guy called charles murray , a us libertarian . 
  https://www.gwern.net/docs/2003-murray-human-accomplishment.pdf he is famous in / r/badhistory https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/5g3pjz/oh_no_its_that_graph_again_only_this_time_its/, 
  it 's just good lightning . 
  sweden , only true nordic country . 
  ah , where do they come from ? 
  itt : proof that eu is not ready for federalism yet . 
  there 's always more choices than black or white . 
  eastern europe is a geographical term , only pedants can be insulted by that . 
  i know , that 's kind of my point . 
  using a careless denomination just becasue you 're lazy , is not ok . finland is not scandinavian either . 
  if you wanted a short title , you could have used `` eastern europe '' , instead of five countries . 
  scandinavia is not a country . 
  finland is not in scandinavia . 
  i know we do it that way in sweden . 
  and if it was a pre-emptive strike only ... 
  including norway , iceland and switzerland ? 
   i meant environmentalism as in caring for nature . 
  our spruce plantations are n't much better in that regard than a field of wheat . 
  forests in sweden * are * in fact much better than a field of wheat , a field that is constantly fertilized and treated with pesticides ? 
  most people on the continent ( and a lot in swedish urban population ) fetishise a forest as a magical hobbit land , and not as a means to support humans with renewable resources . 
  do i get a free nokia ? 
   the function of a tree has always been to be chopped down . 
  in the same manner as the function of wheat and cow is to eat it . 
  it has little to do with environmentalism , if you by that mean `` hitting like on facebook '' . 
  it has a lot to do with being a practical alternative to non renewable resources . 
  ooh , you have a flag !, 
  statistics follow the law . 
  i can accept scotland as a package deal . 
   are you talking about spanking/slaping children ? 
  it has also been declared illegal for a few month here as well . 
  i did and i 'm more than happy to admit defeat on that point . 
  let 's use the uk as example then . 
   i think it 's hard to get consistency with all the different legal traditions . 
  they can into nordic . 
  their flag is already nordic approved ( tm ) . 
  ok , it did n't understand that . 
  child abuse is a crime stat that is pretty much useless , for instance . 
  what 's ok in france is not in sweden . 
  is local news ok now ? 
  or is it ok , as long as the suspects are from the about 20 % of swedes with immigration background ? 
  yeah , homicide is the closest one we have to be comparable . 
  but `` death by firearm '' is n't a crime . 
  it can be everything from hunting accident , self-inflicted , manslaughter , homcide etc , etc. 
  criminal law is up to each country , trying to make it the same wo n't work . 
  there 's a big difference in other areas too , e.g. 
  child abuse . 
  i think they believe a rape is a rape , regardless of country . 
  well , that was n't clear to me that `` it '' was referring to the swedish definition of rape !, 
  but thanks for explaining instead of just downvoting . 
  is he suggesting every country should change their laws or that they should report statistics in a way different from what the courts consider rape ? 
  either is fairly unlikely .
