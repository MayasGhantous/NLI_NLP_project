  good luck adjusting the law in all other countries . 
  which is ? 
  there 's no international agreement of what should count as a `` rape '' in crime statistics . 
  it has nothing to do with grammar , but the difference in law . 
  there 's no single definition that every country uses . 
  do you believe there 's a single international definition ? 
  because it is reported differently in the statistics . 
  comparing crime levels between countries is more or less futile . 
  it 's not for me or you to decide if it 's enough proof . 
  `` suspected of '' . 
  but i guess it does n't matter on reddit . 
  of course not , that would n't show up in your news feed at all . 
  `` the ministry of defence ( mod ) ** attempted to keep the exercise quiet ** - no media were invited and a ** short tweet ** with a picture was sent out around midnight . '', 
  this describes perfectly the nine months of autumn-winter-spring in g\u00f6teborg . 
  hellatio, 
  it 's not clear how bad this really is . 
  there 's no evidence in either way how bad an occasional glass of wine is during pregnancy . 
  ( removed stray quote ) not , it 's very common on reddit to think that . 
  is n't the sanctions against russia a big part too ? 
  best part of the page . 
  yeah , that will of course motivate engineers to work on the cutting edge . 
  reminds me of [ this .

  it does n't have to be state owned to be regulated . 
  for instance , a lot of infrastructure in sweden is owned privately . 
  electricity is supplied by quite a few private grids . 
  it 's still price regulated though . 
  phone and fiber is private , there 's even private sewer ( but smallish ) . 
  so , 30 people thought the above was a well written and interesting reply ? 
  as long as eu is a union of sovereign states , the power should go through the states . 
  if germany is in , i 'm game !, 
  or re-instate the conscription as it were two decades ago , a solution that we know works . 
   that 's where you have screening procedures for . 
  not the same , but selecting from a much larger group . 
  so why do you argue its utility for you ? 
  i think you mistake utility for quality ? 
  no , if you have sucky gas mileage your cars is not of high quality , to those who want reasonable gas mileage . 
  quality depends on what you want out of a car . 
  if you bitch about moving stuff , that 's pretty irrelevant if the car is too big . 
  it depends on what you want out of a car . 
  a camry with a hitch can move furniture . 
  i do n't move random large that often , so it 's not that big expenditure to rent a trailer . 
  or use a roof rack , or bike rack on the hitch . 
   that 's where you have screening procedures for . 
  and we 're back to not finding enough people . 
  rust ? 
  * and * you 're a girl ? 
  and have half the mileage compared to a toyota camry . 
   and potentially risk their lives . 
  no , not until we 're at war . 
  and then we 'll all risk our lives , conscript or not . 
  no , it 's educating the conscripts in how to defend the country . 
  conscription is a form of education . 
  schools do n't pay you salary , that 's were the slavery is . 
  it 's not slavery , it 's conscription . 
  it 's not more slavery than obligatory school . 
  well , i 'm not sure it would work . 
  and if it does , do you get the right kind of people ? 
  need more soldiers . 
  removing conscription did n't give enough military personnel . 
  i studied one semester of theoretical philosophy at the university . 
  i have never heard of them . 
  well , in contrats to being a blond , being a classified as a cunt due to your opinions or your stance in certain questions is in the eye of the beholder . 
  government should not take this into consideration in any of its application of the law , being it zoning permits , parking ticket , welfare money , punishments or application for citizenship . 
  equal before the law . 
  apparently the swiss central government agrees . 
  it was you that said citizenship is not a human right . 
  if it were a privilege , it could be removed without violating human rights . 
  democratic to remove citizenship of blond people then ? 
  so , if the swiss law throws you in jail because you say you hate cowbells , it 's still freedom of speech ? 
  still present in other european countries, 
  watch it , the danes conduct business like a arabs , remember . 
  nordens araber . 
  there 's a slight chance something similar will happen here . 
  their support is down . 
  germany is once more the powerhouse of europe . 
  they are in the swedish government now , but not that much influence . 
  `` that '' ? 
  they were referring to the 2013 report : https://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/rc11_eng.pdf norway , iceland , finland and sweden followed . 
  the black sheep denmark is in 11th place ... 
   and the only nordic country with a large immigrant population is sweden which we had for decades , btw . 
  italians , finns , jugoslavians , chileans , greeks , iraki . 
  somalia , syrians ... and of course our scandinavian friends and germans . 
  eupedia is written by one ( 1 ) person , and there seems to be no source for this list . 
  do you guys ever think about the source for claims like this ? 
  we 'll make america great again !, 
  turkey can into nordic !, 
  username sort of checks out . 
  [ let 's settle this once and for all . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2gjamgun04 ), 
  so , no source for that either . 
  i 'm not surprised . 
  btw , spanking is a form of hitting , no way around . 
  arguing semantics is just silly , it 's the same act and is forbidden in 51 countries . 
   i made a ( very specific ) statement about negative reinforcement and and it 's supported by psychology `` by psychology '' ? 
  any study you want to cite , or other statistical analysis , that shows that hitting a child decreaeses its likelyhood for mortal injuries ? 
  i bet you ca n't find any . 
  you 're just rambling and avoiding the question . 
  i suppose that mean you have no support for your statements , and making things up . 
  they probably have got several smacks already .
