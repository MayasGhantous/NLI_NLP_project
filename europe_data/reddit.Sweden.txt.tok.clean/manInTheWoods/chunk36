  it 's very doubtably . 
  this is why eu should n't meddle in forestry regulations . 
  1721 worst year,

  about one third of swdeish eggs are washed , http://www.kronagg.se/vaara-produkter/tvaettade-aegg/ a process which does not alter the time they can be stored . 
  no , eggs are normally no in the fridge in swedish supermarkets . 
  grexit next , then . 
  excellent w\u00f6rk !, 
  yeah , mike the flag or a president of a republic or something . 
  which countries are that ? 
  not in sweden at least . 
  i ca n't find the data for sweden , i think it 's a similar level . 
  we 've had a lot of immigration since the 60s . 
  in 10-15 years you will be just as gay as we are now .

  here 's the swedish article that yle is referring to : http://www.dn.se/debatt/oroande-nar-sverigefinnar-forbjuds-att-tala-sitt-sprak/, 
  i 'm a bit sceptical how widespread this is . 
  i have n't heard anything like this regarding other languages . 
  it has probably happened in some cases , but there 's no official policy to `` forbid '' speaking any languages in sweden . 
  you can get help with your taxes in 20 different languages , for crying out loud ( yes , also finnish and me\u00e4nkieli ) .

  artistic license ? 
  noob .

  are you implying that almost all forest in europe is worthless ?
