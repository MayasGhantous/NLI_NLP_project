  as in brest-feeding , yes . 
  as in make sure they have clean clothes , something to eat and resonably educated , i do not agree at all . 
  there 's nothing about providing food , shelter and education that is connected to pregnancy . 
  no , the reason you ca n't have a sane discussion is that you do n't want to use words like biotruth role , and then pretend to be upset when pepole interpret that as bilogical determinism . 
  ah , the theory that women 's place is fixed by their biology . 
  is n't it simpler to assume it 's just like fashion , it depends on what society currently assume is the correct way ? 
  i ca n't e.g find any biological reason chemical engineers are more women than men , but almost no women in electrical engineering . 
  what do you mean ? 
  in a thread about spanish weather ? 
  good job !, 
  so that 's why there are more women than men becoming medical doctors ? 
  becuase `` soft bullshit reasons '' ? 
  can you explain why these preferences changes in less than two generations then ? 
  or that they are different between countries/cultures ? 
  i 'm not asking them , i 'm asking you . 
  state your ideas , please . 
  i 'm not asking youtube , i 'm asking you . 
  how come these preferences changes in less than two generations then ? 
  or that they are different between countries/cultures ? 
  and why is that so ? 
  you mean it 's completely expected for women to chose educatioin over tech ? 
  no , [ this is amazing !,

   laestadianism i thought they were more or less extinct !, 
  apparently they 've survived longer on your side of the pond . 
   virtue signaling . 
  oh please . 
  every tory voter gets a ge appliances from ~ ~ may ~ ~ ** maytag **, 
  these plans for motorways seems pure fantasy to me . 
  or at least not within 20 years . 
  please come and visit !, 
  just a few drops . 
  it 's a mandomsprov !, 
  it used to be number 23 in the systembolaget listing , so you got one bottle on your 23rd birthday , and you were supposed to drink it . 
  i only got a `` kvarting '' ( 375 ml ) but could n't finish it . 
  i 'll never be a man . 
  this is sweden to me . 
  not stockholm or the big cities , not the sea or the 100.000 lakes . 
  just a small farm on border between farmland and forest . 
  drove around on small roads with the family , had to stop to take a picture . 
  this time of the year , it 's so beatiful . 
  ~ ~ intensifies ~ ~ ** expands ** fd\u00c5d, 
  what 's wrong with b\u00e4sk ? 
  not for kids , though . 
  no , becasue it is taught in school as a union between equally strong countries , not that sweden more or less was controlled by denmark . 
  what do they teach you ? 
  well , i have never seen anyone on reddit supporting less spending on the military , but the opposite . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/serbian_mafia#sweden juggemaffian !, 
  that 's because you sent all your gangs our way . 
   from 1991 to 2008 ish yeah , remember the good old times when the world was looking to become more and more peaceful . 
  no wonder we have decreased military spending , the future looked much brighter then . 
  nowadays , young people seems to want more military , not less . 
  [ relevant xkcd ] ( https://xkcd.com/925/ ), 
  it 's excellent , combined with bacon and eggs ( on the pizza ) . 
  splitter ? 
  there are very few republicans in sweden , most support the monarchy, 
  that 's 20 years ago , though . 
   obama was n't really that good when was the last time you had a better pres ? 
  kennedy ? 
  the tax laws are identical . 
  there 's no reason to differentiate . 
  no , just the racists . 
  playing it out like everyone 's a racist is just a way to rationalise one 's own bigotry . 
  what 's the corruption ? 
  this is legal and ok for all one-man shows that do n't have a separate office . 
  i rent a part of my house for my firm , so does many others . 
  it 's tax deductible , like renting from somebody else . 
  everywhere you work and are allowed to rent an office , it 's allowed to rent your own . 
  it 's often tax deductible for your employer too . 
  no , it 's just you . 
   because we are importing trees from rest of the world . 
  if europe would only rely on woods from europe we would probably have different discussion . 
  we are a net exporter of sawn woods . 
  the major pellets import is from canada , they have a lott of trees killed by bugs which ca n't be used as sawn woods . 
  canada and us has pretty much the same practice as europe when it comes to forestry , so there 's no big difference for the enviromental effects . 
  transport by ship is a negligeable energy expenditure . 
   if you do n't cut a tree down then it keeps removing co2 . 
  for a while , yes . 
  but not for long , as the forest does n't increase in volume and the trees start decomposing and producing hothouse gases . 
  harvesting and using the timber for furniture/buildings is a better solution for storing co2 , while burning the residue is neutral . 
  deforestation is n't a problem in europe . 
  using woods from europe does not create a ticking bomb , every year we store as much or more co2 as we release by burning . 
  it 's renewable , the co2 is offset by the uptake . 
  every year there 's as much uptake or even more by growing trees as there is released by burking . 
  it is renewable . 
  we grow trees that capture co2 . 
  we do n't store co2 in the depths of earth , it 's non-renewable . 
  as long as the standing volume of trees is not declining , it 's neutral to burn wood . 
  using woods for timber decreases the co2 as long as those houses/furniture does n't go to waste . 
  you have a point , the problem as i see it is the large turn-around times . 
  if i 've saved 30 years growth and cut it down just after the tax is imposed , it takes 30 years for me to get that tax back . 
  but physically , you get credit for capturing the carbon , i do n't think you have to pay until you release it . 
  it 's not released until it is burnt ( or decomposed ) . 
  what to do with wood from teared down buildings ? 
  deduct it from the yearly growth ? 
   the moment you take it out of `` storage '' is when you pay for it seems to be a reasonable aproach . 
  i think its more reasonable to tax it when you let it out in the atmosphere . 
  it 's not taken out of storage when you move the wood from the forest to the sawmill . 
  it 's not at harvesting the co2 is released , so why tax then ? 
  you 'd be surprised how some people think .
