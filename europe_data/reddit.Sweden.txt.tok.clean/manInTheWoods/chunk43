  you mean your typical hyped company ? 
  no , i ca n't see a company get the same kind of hype here . 
  vitmain d   skin cancer, 
   95 octane ( unleaded standard petrol ) which normally contains 5-10 % ethanol . 
  blame the pacifists of the 90s !, 
   swedes are not very battle ready right now because they bought heavily in to the idea that `` history was over '' when soviet union collapsed and downsized everything untill few years ago were weak enough militarily to be conquered by russia or `` an stick wielding digeridoo '' in two weeks . 
  indeed , in the 80s we still had a full conscription and some pretty good equipment . 
  and as can be seen here , we pretty much demlitarized in the 90s and onwards . 
   \u016f u w\u00e5t ? 
  it 's more like 2.1 +, 
  no more than the two i have now . 
  not that many , as it happens . 
  it 's dutch ? 
  til . 
  it 's a very good machine , though . 
  scottish highlands or norway 's west coast are lovely at that time of the year . 
  every second year or so . 
  most have no idea what it is . 
  i liked it when i drank it last time , but that was 20 years ago or so . 
  you mean mexicans . 
  ho do you feel by [ this ] ( https://kalles.se/content/products/msc/kalles_kaviar_original.png ) ? 
   and again , are there no black spanish people then ? 
  well. , are n't they all ? 
  a really good book , i recommend it . 
  the official motto of helsingborg is `` h\u00e4r b\u00f6rjar kontinenten '' ( the continent begins here ) . 
  the term ` kontinent ' was more in use before \u00d6resundsbron , when almost all passenger car traffic went through helsingborg/helsing \u00f6r . 
  i 'm not sure if denmark was included as part of the contentent , but it might have been . 
   `` kontinentaleuropa '' is an older term for you southerners . 
  locals  tourists ? 
  i would need another 1000 . 
  or are you talking about teenageers living at home only ? 
  it 's illegal , as it should be . 
  we 're around 40 or so . 
  the best city to move is obviously [ kiruna ] ( https://www.google.se/url?q=http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/05/21/world/europe/kiruna-sweden-move-arctic-circle.html&amp;sa=u&amp;ved=0ahukewi4look4obvahvkylakha1yakmqfggnmaa&amp;usg=afqjcnfeqqerv32kdvuc2bdfrxvwyl1u5w ), 
  the black plague , followed by some war ( thirty years ) ? 
  150 million europeans speak russians as their native language . 
  that must be the largest in europe ? 
  what more does a kid need , right ? 
  some sticks and a few trees , that 's all . 
  i believe prison first , then deportation ( sweden ) . 
  it was !, 
  a couple of years ago it was too warm , almost 30c . 
  that was around inverness though . 
  i 've never had issues with the scottish weather , feels like home . 
  i 've visited the west highlands several times . 
  [ beards like this will never go out of style ] ( http://skaggbloggen.se/wp-content/uploads/wassbergklarbred-510x185.jpg ), 
  the lack of shakira law . 
   stockholm is ( on average , obviously does n't apply to everyone ) the worst in sweden when it comes to varieties of the scandinavian languages . 
  those poor souls live in a bubble and struggle with dialects of their own language !, 
  they have a hard time understanding norwegian , in my experience . 
  i guess a lot of text in shopws were bilingual ? 
  til , this was n't common knowledge . 
  low german , best german . 
  we should all agree to use low german as a lingua germanica . 
  what kind of trust do you mean here ? 
  is it what you did when you were away , or when you came home ? 
  https://np.reddit.com/r/parenting/comments/1nylf4/what_is_the_parents_of_reddit_views_on_spanking/ it comes up now and again on / r/parenting , and there 's always a big debate . 
  btw , what is your age ? 
  it 's still a hot topic on reddit , a forum which is a bit more preogressive than your average american ( i presume ) . 
  many states in the us still allows corporal punishment in schools , for instance . 
  physical punishment of your kid is outlawed in 54 countries , the us is not one of them . 
  when it comes to upbringing , most swedes would probably consider americans reactionary . 
  nordic council ftw !, 
   i 'm not used to seeing sweden on the big stage in any other situation , so why should i care now ? 
  assholes are everywhere . 
  so are people overreacting to criticism . 
  you asked why death penalty is outlawed in the eu , and you got your answer . 
  it 's a core value of eu . 
  i knew you were n't interested in an answer , but i tried . 
  it 's a basic human right to live . 
  daily in the city , not so much in the forest . 
  there are subsidies for developing farming and farming related business . 
  i 'm not sure it 's eu money though . 
  employ ? 
   no , he comes and cuts the hay with his big tractor one day and a couple of days later he makes [ hay bales ] ( https://www.hippson.se/cldocpart/182299.jpg?m=1 ) he also claims the eu money ( which btw is less than a days income for me on my real job ) . 
  direct link to the data for the lazy ? 
  government even opened some casions years ago ... 
  i think gamblig is a reason for poverty , more than the other way around . 
  i have a tree farm with some patches of agricultural land ( 5 hectares ) . 
  it 's too small to do any meaningful farming , but a couple of hundred years ago it was decent land . 
  the amount of money i get from eu is the same it costs to pay a farmer to cut the hay and sell it to horse owners . 
  so at least i have no expense to keep the land open . 
  the alternative is to plant more trees on the land , of course . 
  maybe not what you asked for , but that 's my experience . 
  we drink less alcohol per capita than the us , but when we drink , we tend to go all-in . 
  not sure which is the better , health wise . 
  no \u00d6sel then ? 
  or you maybe ca n't tell the difference between dogs and baby seals ? 
  intelligence ? 
  it 's just personal opinions man . 
  just because you in your infinite wisdom och height of intelligence feel that eesti can into nordic , does n't mean it is shared by many others . 
  maybe if you could give us \u00d6sel back ? 
  gustav ii adolf did n't die for nothing . 
  northern germany is ours !, 
   ~ ~ ugly ~ ~ unintelligible, 
  gib rightful finnish clay !, 
  nice touch with k\u00f6nigsberg , btw . 
  oh , were you triggered ? 
  i would never have guessed . 
  apart from language , finland is more similar to sweden than norway is .
