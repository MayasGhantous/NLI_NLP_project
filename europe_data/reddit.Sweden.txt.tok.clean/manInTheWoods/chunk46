  that 's why society has a a ready-made contract solution that is tried and tested and has a lot of legal implications . 
  it 's for the kids mostly , a commitment of responsibility . 
  the young , childfree , redditors does of course not see any point . 
  lateral thinking !, 
  you can see it 's finland by the number of colours on the dresses . 
  you forgot betongsosse , a fitting description for our current pm . 
  never heard ruttnande meloner . 
  looks like blue dick to me . 
  i prefer we put it in the [ limp dick ] ( https://satwcomic.com/geography-joke ) myself . 
  too soon . 
  gib back new sweden ... 
  that 's because we prefer our own company . 
  at that time of year i 'd go to barcelona or southern spain ( cordoba !? ), 
  instead of z\u00fcrich . 
  i do n't think there 's any law against it , no . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ can ^ ^ ^ ^ we ^ ^ ^ ^ join, 
  you asked this before , did n't you ? 
  or maybe another resident troll ... 
  ronny , conny , johnny, 
  only one ` o ' for sure . 
  it 's w\u00f6rk-time !, 
  only in sweden , norway and finland . 
  yes and no . 
  eh , if your english is n't very good , it 's hard to be the correct level of polite . 
  what the heck was that ? 
  have you ever been to costa del sol ? 
  its not that different from what you describe , just beach resort 's one after another . 
  it easier and quickerr to fly from atlanta to toronto then from northern sweden to southern sweden . 
  i gey it you think ameica i so diverse you do n't need to travel . 
  and because you do n't travel , you do n't know what you miss . 
  http://imgur.com/a/altk0 less than 5 minutes spent searching , dates at random . 
  does not include meals though . 
  $ 1000/person . 
   and all very expensive . 
  really ? 
  americans does not travel internationally because they cant afford it ? 
  sure , atlanta - toronto $ 400 , and atlanta - phoenix $ 260 in june is a difference . 
  yes , it includes airfare . 
  www.costcotravel.com the distance between atlanta and phoenix is 3000 km by car , it takes 26h to drive . 
  the distance between stockholm and malaga is 3700 km by car , it takes 36h to drive . 
  from atlanta : mexico , central america , cuba , the caribbean and canada are all closer than that ( by air ), 
  for a middle age person , is $ 1000 for an all inclusive trip to mexico really that expensive ? 
  abut 2 million trips from sweden to spain each year , that 's 20 % of the population . 
  7 % go to the us . 
  neither of these are driving distances . 
  you ca n't eat your pet ? 
  i 'm a bit sceptical to eating carnivores , though . 
  mexico one week $ 1000/person ? 
   $ 100 for a cable car ride . 
  wtf ?

  finland , our cool little brother . 
  gazpacho and siesta ? 
  that 's pretty flat . 
  huh , til .

  that 's not true at all . 
  you 're not angry , just a bit reserved .

  you havent been to sweden then , i think less people smoke here than in north america . 
  * swoon *, 
  papers would be dn , svd and gp . 
  liberal ( in the european sense ) , except svd which is bit more conservative . 
  their journalists are more left leaning though . 
  hit escape when the page is loading to read dn . 
  i know . 
  he really wants to be swedish , but he ca n't . 
  us nature , best nature !,

  no , she does n't . 
  googled it and i was 33 when it premiered in sweden , and my kids were too young to watch tv . 
  never heard of hillary duff . 
  was she famous ? 
  i 'm almost 50 and i have mispoken once or twice , but anyone below 30 saying negerbollar is probably making a statement . 
  it was the only way i called them as a kid , i also resisted a bit but have now converted . 
  my kids however were quite shocked when they heard me say `` negerbollar '' . 
  [ these ] ( http://mittkok.expressen.se/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/fotolia_120185863_subscription_monthly_m-700x700.jpg ) are not `` negerbollar '' anymore . 
  should be ok of you 're eating a kebabpizza with fries on top . 
  the chilean refuges in the 70s came by plane , i believe . 
  no , not really . 
  i however , appreciate religion as a mostly postive part of our culture . 
  a smug swede ? 
  never heard of such a thing . 
  from the tap . 
  to buy alcohol outside of bars/restaurant you have to be 20 and they will check every time unless you look like 30 or so .

  estonia and the tsunami , could also be mentioned . 
  and maybe the bronze of 1994 . 
  in dalarna middle of may 2016 http://www.expressen.se/vadernytt/har-ar-svenskarnas-snobilder--fran-maj/, 
  april and early may are notoroius for unstable weather , with rain , snow and warmth alternating . 
  i think those outside of the urban centers rather distance themselves than appropirate the nearest city . 
  it was warm ( salt lake , joshua tree , death valley , andalucia ) . 
  vastness is nice , but i prefer a more [ boreal vastness ] ( http://laponia.nu/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sareknp_rahpaano-suorgudahka__1180px_foto-peter-rosen_lapplandmedia-1180x450.jpg ),
