  we share much of the same culture ( what little they have in south west ) , values ( sure , right now there are more `` values '' in the west , but we remember them being poor little brother ) and sometimes even language ( except the semi-slav in the east ), 
  not at home , no . 
  under the sink we have a bag for organic waste and a box for recyclables ( which is always full ) . 
  there 's also a bag for waste that will get incinerated . 
  the bags will get picked up every fortnight at the curb ( a green and brown wheelie bin ) , the recycleables - which are about 80 % of the waste - i will have to transport myself . 
  first step , to the basement in the basement we have separate boxes for : * newspaper/magazine * plastic containers * cardboard containers * glass containers * metal containers * `` hazardous '' waste , e.g. 
  batteries , electronics , bulbs , spray cans etc. 
  * larger things that burns , e.g. 
  shoes and clothes ( which ca n't be recycled ), 
  nah , a german ref would be nice . 
  may i suggest herbert fandel ?
