   sweden is twice as big as any of the other countries and that is a huge imbalance . 
  i never really think about that when visiting my neighbours . 
  is it really a problem ? 
  if forming some kind union , equal power to all countries is what i envision . 
  nah , not really as it stands today . 
  but rather than forming a country . 
  norway and iceland are n't in the eu today , btw . 
  no , but i would n't mind a mini-eu on our own . 
  we 've had quite good cooperation the last 60 years within the nordics countries ( scandinavia plus iceland and finland ) . 
  even with the danes . 
  plus , one country ? 
  who should we compete with in skiing , hockey , floorball , handball , football , athletics etc ?? 
  was this in france ? 
  engineering books were english , except for some basic math . 
  lectures and tests in swedish , though . 
  they are nordicer ? 
  what am i looking at here ? 
  where did you hear europeans hate america ? 
  it 's shit . 
  next question !, 
  i do n't understand the question . 
  no , not for the next 20 + years . 
  which are 1 , 5 , 15 and 100 ml . 
  `` we got 2 dm of snow last night '' , is the standard way . 
  never . 
  they only flag on flag days , though . 
  it 's not naive , it 's what has happened so far in e.g. 
  sweden , where the manufacturing is highly automated . 
  small factories can run during night with nobody there watching . 
  and i do n't share your view that a lot of people are stupid and incompetent . 
  nor that `` passing university '' is the only way to become a productive member of our future society . 
   we are automating more jobs than we create i very much doubt that too . 
   you can be near braindead to work at a belt , well , how large percentage of the current jobs are of the form `` you can be braindead '' ? 
   hence increase in skill-level of the job . 
  which drives productivity , and increases the need for education . 
  when i went to school 30 years ago , i was dissuaded from becoming a programmer , because the rise of 4gl would make that profession obsolete . 
  and now you tell me there 's a need for more ? 
  why have n't code generation been automated like they promised ? 
   however the ai can fairly easily replace most jobs humans currently do . 
  i doubt that too . 
  still , there 's more jobs now then there was 100 years ago , even though we have automated away 90 % of those jobs that existed then . 
  in sweden , less now than during the 70s/80s i 'd say . 
  sure , your recent president election raises a couple of eyebrows , but that does n't amount to anti-us . 
  your foreign policy however , is generally not widely popular here . 
  i very much doubt that . 
   the other big problem is that the automation revolution is coming in and fast , even now we can already automate 50 % of our workforce , with current technology . 
  and it 's not only low skill jobs that can be automated : doctors , lawyers , engineers , journalists , musicians , with technology we have now we can automate many of the jobs in these areas . 
  we have automated away 90 % of the jobs already in the last 100 years .

  110 hcpu checking in !, 
  is ` think-thank ' and ` lobbyist ' the same thing then ? 
  no , not at all . 
  the generations are seldom mentioned in public debate . 
  not a problem , just curious what it meant !, 
  the entire quote . 
  you should visit the nordic countries . 
  more people go to thailand than to the us for vacation , i believe . 
  most stay in europe . 
  well known from media , big empty spaces ( just like home ) , a language that we already know ( sufficiently ) . 
  btw , old/new world is n't something i see as a thing . 
  it 's just different , like thailand . 
   edit : also its real pretty yosemite !, 
  intrusive r ? 
  quick , which syllable should you stress in `` controversy ? 
  heard it today on tv and went `` huh ! '', 
  would n't that be ecereal ? 
  crosscountry skiing is best skiing !, 
  only 8 home games ?

  is there a spelling mistake somewhere here , or am i about to learn an english colloquialism ?

  [ for you ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=la4dcd1auce ),

   yttrandefrihetsf\u00f6rordningen from 1992 if anyone wonders . 
  the oldest still valid law is byggningabalken ( deals with use of land and relations between neighbours and how/when you can release your pigs in the forest ) and handelsbalken ( business transactions ) from 1736, 
  i 've always liked [ vintersaga ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhttt0nyzis ) i think [ monica t\u00f6rnell ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzsl_iaiqoa ) has the better version though ( video is crap ) . 
  no , how can all the edgy youth then protest against the world by not voting , and brag about it ? 
  with inches -  tumstock in metric -  meterstock, 
  and our 2x4s are 45x95 .
