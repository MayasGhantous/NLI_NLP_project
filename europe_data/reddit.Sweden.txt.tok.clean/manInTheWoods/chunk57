  you started okay for a troll , but took it too far . 
  try again . 
  stay away from hisingen , v\u00e5rv\u00e4derstorget particularly . 
  several gang related killings in 2016 . http://www.dn.se/om/valdet-i-goteborg/, 
  everybody that writes here are of course way above average when it comes to open mindness , education , experience intelligence , culture , penis size and humility . 
  sweden with glorious kebabpizza . 
  if you took e45 , it 's 99 % forest . 
  one of the most monotone roads there is . 
  of course , i enjoy it . 
  more people along e4 , but that 's maybe relevant only oslo - kirkenes . 
  germany !, 
  they hog all the refugees for themselves . 
  it 's ok , that 's the reason we let foreigners eat from our table anyways . 
  when i got my drivers license for bus/truck 25 years ago , it was max 6 hours without a break , and 11 hours per day that was the limit for commercial drivers . 
   balt, 
  take the last piece of cake !, 
  or the last meatball . 
  nine years mandatory school , ending the year you turn 16 . 
  90 + % then go to `` gymnasium '' , three years extra where you either learn some more basic stuff like math , language and a trade ( baker , carpenter , etc ) , or completely theoretical add-on to the first 9 years . 
  neither of these have an end exam you have to pass , just grading on your subjects . 
  the latter then leads to university , where you stay 2-5 years depending on what your studying . 
  medical , engineering , law , teacher . 
  it all follows the same pattern , but different numbers of semesters are needed . 
  illegal ? 
  with a couple of breaks ? 
  especially for oldish people . 
  driving 8 + hours is n't fun if you 're 70 you . 
  both my mother and my in-laws flew this christmas . 
   driving from the very southern point of norway to the northermost point takes 35 + hours so it helps having the option to fly instead . 
  pro tip for that drive ? 
  go through sweden . 
  mostly harmless . 
  please , are you even trying ? 
  how to recognise a shitposter . 
  they did steal the spotlight in sweden . 
  the talking points from the right is all about the `` rapefugees '' now , and not the beggars . 
  the romanians/bulgarians stole the spotlight from poles/baltics though . 
  dating ? 
  you mean having sex ? 
  what was the mistake ? 
  / a swede, 
  sometimes we use ` gross ' ( 144 ) , bit rarely . 
  lumber used to be measured in inches , but the last 20-30 years it 's almost exclusively sold in mm . 
  a `` tv\u00e5 tum fyra '' is now 45x95 mm ( planed ) . 
  it 's just laziness . 
  btw , are you my friend ? 
  emo kids before it was cool . 
  i think it does , though . 
  no rules against it . 
  youtube videos, 
  it is not possible in a country where freedom of religion is important , to let a church handle some societal functions . 
  apparently / u/gayhindus and / u/gayhindu _ was banned from reddit , i wonder how long this account will last ? 
  should be [ this ] ( https://www.google.se/url?q=https://m.youtube.com/watch%3fv%3d3uo0jauwijm&amp;sa=u&amp;ved=0ahukewjg9ijphyvrahucahokhtaidcaqyckiejaa&amp;sig2=xl-vppd4wjirhl_ro6jl5q&amp;usg=afqjcnf6r60ksmlp2elrv8yqjibtz0pnmq ), 
  yeah , maybe you are too young to remember bader-meinhof ... 
  germans should be pretty used to terrorism by now . 
  raf ? 
  but estonia is n't a baltic country !, 
  how many indigenous ethnic groups do you have in estonia ? 
  americans value white teeth more , looks is important . 
  europeans value health more , does n't care if they are n't whitened . 
  are you going ... \u00f6sterut ? 
  `` now '', 
  ah , that explains it . 
  we do n't have gifts from santa either , but sometimes an older male family member dressed as santa hands out the christmas gifts . 
  are you american ? 
   reading / r/parenting , it appears the lies about santa is one of the christmas ' sacred traditions . 
  i do n't think i ever told my kids that santa was real or that he was unreal . 
  i figure they understood at 5-7 years . 
  looks like the post is deleted ? 
  it 's a bit too late when the attack starts . 
  the idea with concscription is that you educate your populations in the basic principles of warfare . 
  it will sooner or later be about guerilla tactics for small countries like ours . 
  the good thing about building an army around conscription , is that there are n't that many trigger happy military itching to ( or even capable of ) attacking our neighbours . 
  yes , i support conscription . 
  after the civil war , all infrastructure needs rebuilding anyway . 
  / s splitting the us ? 
  i ca n't see that happening . 
  but who knows , maybe trump '' s mismanaging is forcing california to secede . 
  but simeone got their revenge !, 
  okay , what country ? 
  ** you 're an asshole ** . 
  meant as a joke , but okay . 
  edit : sorry , overreacted, 
  catchy , but not really the truth . 
  we did let some german troops through , but we played with the allied under the cover . 
  such as helping norway and denmark some . 
  the downside of being neutral , who ever wins will blame us for not joining them . 
  would it have helped anyone if we folded like norway and denmark ? 
  least proud : ww2 . 
  it was * okay * . 
  and the racial theories we invented . 
  most proud : 200 + years of peace , and welcoming/accepting refugees from all over the world since ww2 . 
  mexico loves us !, 
  i 've yet to need naming that country when speaking english , but i will probably use czechia from now on . 
  it 's close to our term tjeckien . 
  so about still game . 
  what languages were spoken ? 
  are they danish or swedish citizens ? 
  so , did you know half of my grandparents were german ?? 
  do you wan na have a beer ??
