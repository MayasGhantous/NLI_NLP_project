  there 's lots of middle class suburbs in sweden , but i do n't think that 's a requirement for liking those shows . 
  hmm , johnny proggare ? 
  i feel old . 
  no conny , johnny or ronny ? 
  yup , with the polar bears .

  wheres the stress in crustacean ? 
  first or second vowel ? 
  do you guys name your kids sten ( rock ) or similar ? 
  it 's quite common here . 
  astrid is rising i think . 
  ragnhild and gunnar will be popular within 15 years , i bet . 
  i also studied english and german in school . 
  the latter i can barely survive as a tourist now 25 years later . 
  however , went to germany this summer for a week , and am now trying to revive it by listening to podcasts and reading . 
  to exotic , trumpland is better . 
  half of / r/sweden, 
  very region speciric , only a problem in some big cities , if you want to live within walking distance of city centre , basically . 
   are you trolling ? 
  right on . 
  pointing with the blunt end . 
  roma - a pepole/ethnicity gypsy - a travelling beggar i think its important to differentiate between the terms .

  i do n't follow hockey any more , not even olympics/wc .

  yes , the good old days ( 40s , 80s ? ), 
  are sorely missed here too , but relating to snow and skiing . 
  i remember a museum in nl where they said flooding the polders to stop attackers once failed due to freezing cold !, 
  well , there 's always norway ... 
  cold , northern and rightful viking clay . 
  i 've got the impression nhl is more about the fights than the actual play .

  oh come on , skating is a dutch sport !, 
  never heard of sven kramer ? 
  1632 never forget !, 
  why is it only swedes who claim sweden is the most smug country ? 
  i dislike those swedes who use `` typically swedish '' as an insult . 
  why is it only swedes who claim this ? 
  which france ? 
  or should i say vich france ... 
  it 's nowadays purely historical , the only remnant is that the king must be a protestant . 
  it 's a non-issue . 
  im actually not sure we have a state church anymore ? 
  i thought it had something to do with the swedish speaking finns , bit apparently only 5 % have swedish as their mother tongue . 
  thought it was on par with n\u00e4rpes . 
  not that much , to be honest . 
  r\u00f6de orm , by frans g. bengtsson .

  [ picturesque village on the west coast ] ( http://www.fjallbackafisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/flygbild2-800x324.jpg ) [ traditional central swedish village ] ( http://www.visitdalarna.se/globalassets/sodra-dalarna/bilder/toppbild-1024x324/sevardheter/_vy-falun.jpg ) [ farmstead established 150 years ago ] ( http://site.uit.no/pite/files/2013/02/sjaggo_web.jpg ) [ but our suburbs look like this ] ( http://www.franovan.se/flygfoto-stockholm/stockholm-flygfoto-skarpnack1-381x216.jpg ), 
  everything more than 2 hours north of stockholm , and 2-3 hours from the coast . 
  here 's an example from dorotea ( * ) for 18k euro . 
  http://hemnet.sfd.se/bildlista/default.aspx?objgid=obj13096_1485763361 ( * ) dorotea was previously known as bergvattnet , but the three town fredrika , vilhelmina and dorotea changed to their names when https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frederica_of_baden was made queen of sweden . 
  i image-googled `` jrotc trianing '' . 
  if this is n't paramilitary trainng , what is ? 
  i bet you 've fired more rounds than i did during my time as a conscript . 
  and to answer the question , we had conscription until recently so we made real soldiers ( haha ) out of our youth , instead of just pretend . 
  now it 's gone , and there is no money available for such a thing . 
  not `` fr\u00f6ken '' for the first couple of years ? 
  professional boxing is also illegal in sweden , for more than 4 rounds . 
  do n't worry about `` salty '' , i 'm not sure i used it correctly anyway . 
  never heard of this festival , where is it held ? 
  still salty from 1016 ? 
  seems to me there 's pretty much no difference in chance of getting armed intruder in your house ?

  maybe he is from detroit ? 
  do you have a seat belt and fire extinguisher next to your keyboard ? 
  so , even do you do n't think it will happen , you stifle your fear with a gun ? 
  you 're afraid you will be attacked and the door frame will fail ? 
  so you feel secure then , with a gun at your side ? 
  i thought you had a gun ? 
  would that make you feel safer ? 
  are n't you afraid you have to use it ? 
  what are you afraid of ? 
  the bank takes the house as collateral . 
  it 's up to them to judge the amount of money they can lend with that collateral . 
  there 's no guarantee from the government . 
  if you default , the bank sells the house , and you ( or your creditors ) get whatever is left of the money . 
  i think i was in for 11 months , shot real bullets maybe five times in total . 
  i was conscripted , we had automatic rifles .
