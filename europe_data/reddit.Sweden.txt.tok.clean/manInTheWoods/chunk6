  it says in the article that they have n't decided yet . 
  someone made a report , and they have to register and process it . 
  here 's more info : http://www.do.se/other-languages/english-engelska/working-life/ it 's probably not a true story , though . 
   in the article : `` the new gender-neutral pronoun '' who can introduce a new gender-neutral pronoun and force anybody to use it ? 
  anyone can introduce a new word , but no-one can force its use . 
  as if sweden was involved ... 
   swedish people why do you let politicians redefine basic concepts of your language ? 
  neither politicians nor svenska akademien defines the language . 
  the latter does however list current usage . 
  childhood obesity seems to be on the way down in us and also in eruope . 
  could n't find any recent stats though . 
  what am i looking at here ? 
  [ found a picture ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:jakthorn,_enligt_inskriptionen_tillverkat_av_horn_fr%c3%a5n_den_sista_uroxen_i_europa_-_livrustkammaren_-_102555.tif ), 
  finders , keepers ... 
  are you old enough to remember the ccc ? 
  as long as the issue is potential , they do n't have to take into account . 
  a couple of years back , a man arrested for murder of a 5-year old girl , confessed to burning down s\u00f6dra r\u00e5da kyrka from the 14th century . 
  voices told him ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/s%c3%b6dra_r%c3%a5da_old_church, 
  arson is normally a crime against persons . 
  burning down a building where people could be is as bad as if they were actually there . 
  included in trabajo . 
  a damage or parasite or something like that creates a bulge . 
  in this instance they happened to be two bulges close to each other . 
  it was probably a memorial placed there by the muslim community . 
  itt : the standard xenophobic comments . 
  ingrid bergmann and max von sydow, 
  is it still hard to pay with your cc , and most stores accept dankort only ? 
  you actually do that ? 
  put your phone in a special bag ? 
  what kind of stuff are you doing when you bag your phone ? 
  there probably was seatbelts , that we 're probably not used . 
  i 'm not sure it would have helped everybody , so saying it was completely preventable is not true . 
   did n't come from here so what , not many people come from where they live . 
  not if you go back far enough . 
  it\u00e4s not like americans are the only people in the history that actually moved . 
   i also love the idea of identity being based on an idea , not an ethnicity . 
  would n't that mean that wherever you come from is n't important to your identity ? 
  for a country so in love with being bases on an idea , it sure seems that ethnicity is more important to you than to most europeans . 
  nah , you did good . 
  you might as spell give old jacques and ` r ' too , then . 
  same link ? 
  so a proper answer would be `` good riddance '' ? 
  well , so am i , but that does n't mean i claim half german . 
  i 'm swedish . 
  my paternal grandparents were not . 
  i do n't think you should feel concerned that it bothers me what other people tell me of their perceived heritage . 
  fake heritage is fake . 
  are n't americans proud of being americans ? 
  i 'm so confused . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/alcohol_belts_of_europe#vodka_belt swedes and russians have something in common ... 
  well , you 're a memnonite and that appears to be your cultural background . 
  not english , french or german . 
  prague , here i come !, 
  ancestry is interesting , but if you use it as a way to try to fit or feel connected , then it 's annoying and ( to me ) fake and conceited . 
  spend a decade , learn the language , embrace the culture , get your citizenship if you want to connect . 
  your ancestry does n't matter . 
  your ancestors are probably from all over the place , going back a few generations . 
  if you never kept up the language/culture/traditions from one of your originating countries , i fail to see how you can be connected . 
  nobody cares about heritage , because the culture defines you , not the proverbial drop of blood . 
  my fathers parents were germans , he considered himself swedish ( and so do i obviously ) . 
  i would n't dream of going to germany and proclaim i 'm actually half-german . 
  considering that my grandparents were from greifswald/mecklenburg , maybe they have some swedish ancestry already . 
  your ancestral claims of `` heritage '' sounds too fake to not be annoying . 
  if you knew they were n't screwed , why did you write it ? 
  that 's not how it works . 
  they wont have any trouble learning swedish or english . 
  bilingual kids are not screwed , rather the opposite . 
  the swedish word for elf is alv , which is not closely related to \u00c4lv / river ( as far as i know ) . 
  just a note , it 's \u00c4lv - as in river - , not elf - as in legolas . 
  it would also be a downward pressure on the wages , from the collective bargained levels . 
  people working for lower than agreed wages will continue to do so after the min wage is set . 
  if nobody is checking , what would a minimum wage help ? 
  the `` bottom feeders '' , as you put it , are those working without paying taxes and getting benefits ( black market ) . 
  a minimum wage does nothing for these , and nothing for those `` helping out '' their cousin in her cleaning service . 
  it really does n't . 
  workers are united and can handle setting of wages together with the companies . 
  finland does n't need a legal minimum wage . 
  no it 's not . 
  it 's too extreme for them .

  we 're putting the empire back together , did n't you know ? 
  we 'll get around to you too , eventually . 
  sense of revenge , you mean . 
  surely you realize that you can comment the code in any language ? 
  and ouput any langugae you want ? 
  and use any language for variables/function ? 
  code written by english speaker will use english when possible . 
  not so with french or german programmers . 
  neither use is a part of the language . 
  i 'm not sure what you are worse at ; programming or english . 
  did you speak english to a foreigner ? 
  not a true finn then . 
  `` the journal of chromatography a provides a forum for the publication of original research and critical reviews on all aspects of fundamental and applied separation science . '', 
  so , these guys are expert in identifying different substances in a sample ? 
  i wonder what they could do to a human . 
  bah , sweden had 6700 rape cases and 28000 cases of sexual crimes total for 2014 . 
  get your act together , austria !, 
  http://www.newgeography.com/content/004280-largest-world-cities-2014 still only 12000 square km . 
  the world 's largest metropolitan area is new york , about 12 000 square km . 
  the netherlands are four times that size .
