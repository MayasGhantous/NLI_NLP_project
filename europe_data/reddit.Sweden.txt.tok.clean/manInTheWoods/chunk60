  people do stuff depending on attitudes and finacial reasons , both can be changed - somewhat - by the government . 
  no campaign for more children that i 've seen though . 
  wait a minute ... !, 
  there was no swedish internet when i started with usenet in 1990 . 
  then , when the www arrived , it was english from the beginning . 
  for work-related technical questions i use english when googling , all our work is documented in english also ( electronics ) . 
  for news i mostly use swedish sites , unless there 's something happening that bbc reports better on . 
  also , for some stuff like forestry i find the swedish web much better . 
  not much , tbh . 
  does n't every country ? 
  btw , we have 221 831 islands . 
  swiming lessons are mandatory in school . 
  damn , whish i knew that this summer . 
  i guess i have to go back . 
  i still use it to check the latest sport result . 
  377 ftw, 
  no , that sounds very far fetched ... 
  have some [ punsch ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/punsch ), 
  currently 2 weeks at age 14 , where you try out at some work place . 
  no money , and you 're not supposed to replace a real worker . 
  for dessert , i recommend a [ semla ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/semla ) . 
  a bun filled with whipped cream and almonds mixed with sugar . 
  dining with the gods . 
  reagan was a movie star , no ? 
  the first time you elected a movie star , i rolled my eyes . 
  now , i just sighed . 
  were you asking for my view or not ? 
  it 's sort of a naive attitude , that belongs to the youth . 
  i 'd secretly roll my eyes , even though once also loved travelling . 
  minimal effort , really . 
  come on , do n't ruin his point with facts !, 
  and brandt and palme and merkel . 
  unless he start 's a full scale civil war , no . 
  an new troll have appeared !, 
  why are you asking europeans these questions ? 
  not at all , usually a note in the papers only, 
  tom jones ? 
  brad pitt ? 
  these are not the big , well-known countries in europe , so i do n't believe many people know enough about them to have opinions . 
  except of course their neighbours . 
  estonians come here to pick berries during summer . 
  lithuanians are lorry-drivers and a famous slovenian is bojan kri\u017eaj . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysze4qwruki lite gammal , men ... 
  those of us that grew up before the iron curtain fell ? 
  that 's interesting , is that in their official agenda or did you get it from somewhere else ? 
  well , explain this then https://www.google.se/url?q=http://www.svt.se/nyheter/lokalt/orebro/i-morgon-smaller-det%3fmobilmeny%3d1&amp;sa=u&amp;ved=0ahukewjt7-mivynqahuevswkhdyjc4iqfggnmaa&amp;sig2=x6m5jhxtiweisfvrppppqq&amp;usg=afqjcngmu0qtn6teouyvq65xgybgos1pxg, 
  yeah , especially there ... 
  so , only in england it is generally impossible to disinherit your kids ? 
  i thought it was more common . 
  nicely written summary , i hopes it 's factually correct too . 
  we live in a small ( 3000 inhabitants ) village 35 km from a 500k + city . 
  i walk to the bus stop , and take the bus to work . 
  about 45 minutes door to door . 
  we have walking distance to a grocery ( open 7 - 23 ) and a pizzeria . 
  that 's it . 
  i try to do my shopping while at work , but it 's common to have one car per adult here ( we only have one car in our family ) . 
  anything big for the house , we do on weekends . 
  for anything except work , we usually use the car . 
  kids are n't old enough to use it , so they take the bus if they 're seeing friends . 
  as always , i feel how we live in sweden is closer to typical american than typical european style . 
  cities are spread out and fairly young . 
  homesteading is the norm for the countryside , there are almost no farmers villages . 
  pop . 
  density is lower than the us , and we drive a lot . 
  your loss !, 
  it appears though you ca n't inherit from someone you kill ... 
  when you write `` sons '' , i hope you also mean `` daughters '' ? 
  no , we use a permanent structure , often a garage or [ something like this ] ( https://www.mellbygarage.se/imageres/index1,36.htm/w630/h300/c/1f0eb033163659084dd943e6fa2608c4c3f7d796.jpg ), 
  this is the first time i 've seen it in my soon 46 years . 
  ( swedish invention ), 
  i guess they use milk for cooking more than for drinking ? 
  so , no matjessill ? 
  itt : people on high horses . 
  organized prostituon is illegal . 
  buying sex is illegal . 
  selling sex is not . 
  it 's considered a very shady business , and of course it happens anyway . 
  i think some liberal party is against the ban , but it 's not a current political issue ( anymore ) . 
  [ this ] ( https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:and9gcsb1sf0z-bypr5i6z52drieudfndbqdz6tr24bhhcivmgo4stism4ksjfjq ) is excessive . 
  but delicious . 
  living farther away from the center of europe than the brits , i 've always considered them european , and not particularly special . 
  that 's not how kids work . 
  most americans , i have never encountered that sentiment except from across the pond . 
  and it 's a recent phenomena, 
  is n't it mostly us jokes ? 
  or are the brits into it also ? 
  are you referring to the airtrim ? 
  it 's a heat exchanger . 
  never used a scarf myself . 
  below -15 it starts to get cold . 
  but it can still be enjoyable on a cold winter night alone in the forest and a few dm of snow . 
  tough going , but builds character . 
  unfortunately , not that cold often . 
  have used an airtrim for cold days . 
  better than \u00d6land right now . 
  it 's hardly ever discussed , it 's sort of a non-issue . 
  there was drive from a small group a week ago to `` ban '' porn ( or regulate it heavily , i think ) . 
  it was met with silence as far as i can tell . 
  usually the kids show on tv have a pretty food grip on sex ed though , in a sort of fun and relaxed way . 
  nobody bats an eye .
