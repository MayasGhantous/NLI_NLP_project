  same here . 
  slackers , all of them . 
  buy a canal boat pass hop-on , hop-off . 
  have virus , will travel . 
  in g\u00f6teborg there 's a couple of large private facilities . 
  most of them work on privately insured patients only , but if they do accept `` cash '' - patients it 's a couple of hundred euros per visit , plus x-ray etc. 
  i had no idea there was something besides the leave stalks . 
  you 'll be safer from news when you get here . 
  not any swedish show i know of . 
  was it a long time ago ? 
  danish royalty https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexandra,_countess_of_frederiksborg and our own king married a brazilian . 
  and if you have two separate phds , it 's herr doktor doktor . 
  that was the first that came to mind . 
  remember it clearly . 
  we never use herr/fru to begin with . 
  fru talman and kungen are the only exceptions that i know of . 
  it varies between countries . 
  a swedish ph.d would n't mind being called sven , but a german might prefer herr doktor kugelschlag . 
  he got you again . 
  so , yet another `` why do you hate america '' - thread . 
  the outdoors , forests . 
  peace and quiet . 
  is this a thread where we are supposed to acknowledge how big and important all american events are ? 
  because those who do n't , immediately get criticised by americans . 
  the tsunami is more remembered and there 's more talk in media about it every year . 
  500 + swedes were killed in the tsunami , and i think only one in nyc . 
  one bike , one tractor and one not currently functioning land rover . 
  a car and camper shared with the family . 
  shame on me for not knowing american english , then . 
  i never went to college , but to university . 
  moved 4 hours by car/train . 
  already had left home , though . 
  you never heard of it ? 
  you 're in for a treat . 
  well , you know ... 
  they are a bit self-centered perhaps . 
  [ petter northug ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2a7q0n39fvo ), 
  you do n't give kids any kind of alcoholic drink in our part of europe . 
  basically illegal under 18 . 
  where could i fid one of those to try , in helsing\u00f6r for instance ? 
  i used to tip taxis . 
  especially when ericsson paid ... , 
  normally tip taxi , nightclubs and fancier resturants , say 2-10 % . 
  / u/vonadler delivers . 
   you ca n't choose your monarch . 
  of course you can , we chose jean bernadotte . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charles_xiv_john_of_sweden we have a long tradition of chosing kings . 
  if not / u/vonadler will surely correct me . 
  oh come on , calling austria eastern europe is n't very common . 
  subbed rather than dubbed . 
  yes , they have become quite popular the last 10 year or so . 
  mostly older people without kids . 
  i 'm sorry , but i do n't understand what you are trying to say . 
  do you disagree on how romanians are viewed in sweden ? 
  maybe you should read a bit better . 
  language , culture and history are three things that connect people . 
  do n't you agree ? 
  i 'm not proving anything , i was answering your question . 
  apparently you did n't like my answer , which is ok . 
  you 're wrong on a couple of accounts : 1 ) i said `` the langugae and ** culture ** are simliar '' . 
  not only language , but also the culture . 
  2 ) finland does speak swedish - it is still mandatory to learn it in school - and was swedish for a couple of hundred years . 
  of course we feel connected to them . 
  language is one way , culture and history other ways . 
  now when the syrians and afghans have come over here en masse , the romanian/bulgarians have been bumped up a notch or two ( except the beggers ) in the rankings . 
  as an educated romanian , i do n't think you will have a problem, 
  too many romanians ? 
  where 's the contradicton ? 
  i think it 's more commonality between germanic countries , than just the language . 
  no , because switzerland is not nordic and has n't been part of sweden or have a sizeable swedish speaking minority . 
  because language is a big part of ones identity ? 
  well ... yes ? 
  the langugae and culture are simliar compared to for instance polish . 
  no , work ethic is n't about how many hours you spend at your job , but how dedicated/concentrated/loyal you are when you 're there . 
  matti nyk\u00e4nen is legend !, 
  no , not really . 
  according to google , it takes just as long driving the scandinavian peninsula as it does driving seattle - houston ( 34 h ) . 
  it was easier to leave sweden and go to denmark than the reverse . 
  on return , you always got the dreaded question `` n\u00e5got att f\u00f6rtulla ? '', 
  buying alcohol in denmark was much cheaper , but you were only allowed a bottle of booze and a bottle of wine per adult . 
  have you ever been to germany or sweden and noticed how common it really is ? 
  it 's latvia , is n't it ? 
  those romans are all the same to me too . 
  sudden increase in crime rate ? 
  no , there has been a steady increase in reported crime since ww2 . 
  i read that and thought `` yeah , we do that too '' . 
  then i realised we talked about faux pas ... 
  it would bee nice with cooler winters in the south . 
  sjunde inseglet , fucking \u00c5m\u00e5l and mannen p\u00e5 taket . 
  never seen in a grocery ( never looked ) , but we have them in the basket of free fruit at work . 
  right now , the weimar republic . 
  and irish are american europeans ? 
  one is good , the other bad ? 
  i was n't really looking for a word , but thanks anyway . 
  yesterday you lived in poland ... 
  because it 's askeurope and not askreddit . 
  what country are you from ? 
  i think it 's a term rednecks use for progressives . 
  and * both * are centered . 
  it 's `` only '' 25 % in sweden , and that 's the vat you will pay .
