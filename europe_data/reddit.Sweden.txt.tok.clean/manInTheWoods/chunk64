  real tractors have the gear lever centered . 
  a mix between laibach and einst\u00fcrtzende neubauten ? 
  i found it easier to drive on the left with a rhd . 
  shifting with your left is easy after a minute or so . 
  interesting movie , have n't seen it even though i remember the incident . 
  i also did my military service in karlskrona a couple of years later . 
  we had a decent defense then , i wonder what would happen if anothe submarine was to run aground now ? 
  have any new info surfaced since the fall of the ussr ?

  salmiakki , is n't that saltlakrits ? 
  no mumintroll , though . 
  hetroed ? 
  it does not worry me . 
  i believe it will have its drawback , but we 'll hopefully gain even more . 
  we wo n't be defenceless , we 're still 500 + million in the eu , with the second largest economy . 
  it 's enough for defence , as long as we do n't face the us . 
  do n't worry , it 's only an american trope . 
  sort of a right of passage if you want into scandinavia . 
  your call ...

  i loled . 
  it depends entirely on your idea what a european is . 
  and rest assure that different countries have different vies from yours, 
  does edinburgh count ? 
  or cdg ? 
  hmm , i lean more towards norway . 
  i guess it depends where in sweden you live . 
  if an eastern european muslim moves to the netherlands , is he then a western european muslim ? 
  we will get an endlessamount of questions about if its safe to travel , from americans . 
  i think it 's easier to get a long with english in amsterdam than london . 
  the natives can be hard to understand !, 
  morality is associated with moral majority in the us , no ? 
  not in a good way , mind you . 
  yeah , so it varies , some countries are small and cramped , and some countries are not so small and less densely populated than , for instance , the us . 
  maybe you should travel around europe a bit , before you summarize it ? 
  if you 're a tourist , you will have the tourist experience . 
  the `` true '' europe varies between who you ask , and it 's different for sven living in sweden and for ole living in denmark . 
  travel , enjoy the world , live your life . 
  it 's not a competition . 
  i do n't think you can compartmentalize your life experience that way . 
  i 'm constantly experiencing europe by living here . 
  when i went to the us , i was eperiencing the us , of course . 
  but there 's no start and no end to your experience ( except birth and death , obviously ) . 
  it 's life . 
  i have a hard time believing it 's possible to experience all of europe in one lifetime . 
  or all of the us , or all of south africa , or ... 
  i was going to suggest [ s\u00f6dra sk\u00e4rg\u00e5rden ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/tomtning_p%c3%a5_nordv%c3%a4stra_vr%c3%a5ng%c3%b6_i_g%c3%b6teborgs_s%c3%b6dra_sk%c3%a4rg%c3%a5rd_1.jpg ) , but you came before me . 
  best value for money in this part of the world . 
  in the majority of cases , yes . 
  did you just recommend a quarter of sweden ? 
  a quick note : there 's no minimum wage in sweden . 
  i know , that 's why i do n't consider belarus fully european . 
  eh , i do n't care . 
  according to eu they are a terrorist organisation . 
  they are for the most part from turkey , even though they are fighting against turkey . 
  i was just commenting on the cultural differences in perceived seriousness of drunk driving , not the political results . 
  cheap : alexandras soppk\u00f6k expensive ( - ish ) : sj\u00f6baren, 
  no death penalty , and democracy . 
  that 's of course not unique to europe . 
  you mean like pkk ? 
  has anyone resigned due to speeding ? 
  ca n't remember any right now, 
  i think this infraction might be seen minor in continental europe , but not so much in sweden . 
  we have a tradition of strong teetotal organisation that cleaned up the drunken sweden of the 19th century . 
  this means that there is no tradition of going down to the pub , there 's no one drinking any stronger than milk at work , and having just one beer or glass of wine at dinners etc is not common . 
  on the other hand , when it 's play time we drink a lot . 
  ( this is from my experience , others might disagree ), 
  more annoyed by the ( often ) continental europeans thinking all of europe is the same . 
  they should know better . 
  as this is askeurope , assume that we are talking about cities in europe ... ( i 've been to oakland and portland , but not cleveland . ), 
  sounds like n ordinary swedish engineering-student . 
  i was the same , ended up with the same debt , still not payed off ( ca n't be bothered ) . 
  a couple of 100k euro for mortgage is n't uncommon either . 
  are there even any big cities ending in - land ? 
  i was thinking more ... svalbard ? 
  british english mostly . 
  some americanizations also . 
  edit : just realized it 's ` americanisation '' in british english . 
  and ` realised ' ... 
  have to ask , is there a difference in pronunciation ? 
  i 've never heard of it otherwise . 
  but then again , how often does one discuss french military accomplishments in real life ? 
  all of them . 
  yes , soon . 
  until then , it 's a bit trickier . 
   and driving to portugal where * i will * live yes , they live in the us and will move to portgual . 
  they do n't live in portugal . 
  we eat reindeer ? 
  i 'll allow it . 
   we are both residents in the us, 
  well , georgia tech is legit so i do n't think the `` online '' will sound bad . 
  but call it distant learning instead , sounds much better . 
  the degree and the university is much more important . 
  but will you respect statistics ? 
  2015 had fewer reported ( to police ) cases of sexual violence and rapes in sweden than 2014 , which in turn were less than in 2013 .
