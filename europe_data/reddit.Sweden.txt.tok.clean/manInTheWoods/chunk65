  does that quiet you ? 
  the far right party in sweden ( sd ) has polled lower and lower since december 2015 . 
  probably becasue people realize that the fear of immigrants were overblown . 
  horses kills the most swedish people , about four per year .

  moose . 
  what 's the danish one ? 
   we also have this in denmark hmmm ? 
  no , but in written form we probably understand 90 % of each other . 
  yes , that 's the point . 
  rowan berries are sour , but grapes are n't . 
  as the fox could n't reach the grapes , he said `` ah , they are n't ripe anyway , they must be unripe and sour '' . 
  he downplayed something he could n't get . 
  but who would ever want rowan berries anyway ? 
  have you eaten them raw ? 
   so , the saying does n't really work translated . 
  would 've worked much better with a sweet fruit like plum or pear . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/four_square a simplified version of that game is often played in school yards . 
  most sport takes place in clubs or at school , and paretns are n't so involved . 
  also , [ handball ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol2cq7xmxs8 ), 
  winter seldom colder than -5 c for more than a week .

  it 's here too . 
  it 's from the fables , but mistranslated grapes for rowan berries . 
  really does n't make any sense , does it ? 
  drove from the netherlands to germany two weeks ago , hardly noticed i entered a new country . 
  the same ( i.e. 
  nothing ) happened when i entered germany from the ferry in kiel . 
  the information is public though , as is your exam results , so e.g. 
  a journalist can check the result of the exam 's for the pm without problem . 
  restrictions apply when it comes to publishing on the intenet though . 
  it 's also very annoying to bystanders . 
  are rural white farmers called `` white trash '' ? 
  hrmph . 
  * sigh *, 
  drivers license . 
  mostly used when collecting various internet purchases from our mail/dhl delivery points . 
  i 'm old enough to not get carded anymore . 
   passport when going to the uk every other year . 
  am now on vacation in holland/germany , nobody has asked to see our brand new passports . 
  i guess you then realize what a stupid question op is asking , as even more legislation with even stronger protection has been passed within the eu ? 
  it 's a better chance of happening in the us than any country in the eu to turn off human rights for select people . 
  i 'm sorry , but the us has a closer history withe segregation and also does not respect human rights as much ( cf death penalty ) you do n't have a flair , can i expect you to be from the united states ? 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/racial_segregation_in_the_united_states yes , it is relevant , op exemplified with segregation in the us during the war . 
  it could happen in the us , because they already had segregation which continued after the war . 
  the us is not a very good exampe when it comes to human rights , they are to this day still using the death penalty . 
  it 's always uzbek . 
  sorry , i 'm a bit out of me league here . 
  ask in / r/svenska !, 
  good question . 
  i think it relates more to how the movies sounded when bergmann made sjunde inseglet . 
  also , southern/west coast of swede uses this r-sound . 
  this video sums it up . 
  so , who should have the right to own a gun ? 
  the entire thing about sexy swedish girls . 
  wish i knew that when i was younger . 
  oh no , and we 're just going there !, 
  should we cancel and go back to swedistan ??

  stereotyped by whom , exactly ? 
  who cares . 
  people that far from reality is never going to listen to reason , anyway . 
  really , what larger cars were available at that time ? 
  swedish right wing nationalist party has been on a ( small , but still ) decline since last year . 
  ebay.co.uk or amazon co.uk works well for me . 
  what is upwork ? 
  cab drivers accept credit card in sweden . 
  you can pay almost anything with a card . 
  mobile ice cream stand ? 
  no problem . 
  vending machines for parking tickets . 
  they have started to implement pin-free payment in shops etc. 
  up to a small amount ( 20 eur ) in sweden . 
  i think the merchant can chose to accept or not . 
  i think it 's pretty stupid to limit at what age you can buy , but not what age you can be gifted . 
  to buy wine or booze you have to be 20 and only at special stores ( systembolaget , limited opening hours ) . 
  to be served at a resturant , you have to be 18 . 
  you can however let underage persons have a taste , in certain circumstances . 
  buying and giving away to underage people is illegal . 
  sweden has an alcohol policy based on restriction , yes . 
  no , yo 're not allowed to leave the bar with a beverage . 
  willfully ignorant is being unwilling to look up population stats . 
  europe is twice the size of the us . 
  most bars card you in the door . 
  often min year is 20 to enter . 
  it 's important kids use flouride toothpaste , and our water has up to 1.5 mg/l fluoride . 
  spoken , it 's defintely a difference . 
   fluent : english , norwegian , swedish vad s\u00e4ger du , danskj\u00e4vel ? 
   thought it was impossible task to speak swedish , norwegian and danish fluently . 
  dreamhack is a big event . 
  15-30 euro for an gp or er visit . 
  pay once , and all care are free until that injury/illness is fixed .

  i do n't know of any that claim to not afford it . 
  completely free below age of 25 . 
  dentist are not covered by this .
