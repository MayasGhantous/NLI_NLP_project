  what could happen though , with a left minority government , is that the right side still present a common budget , and sd chosing to support that one rather than presenting their own . 
  that would mean that the left side would have to enact the rights budget suggestion . . 
  i really hope it only means that she means that eu wo n't object to ukraine willingly belonging to the eurasian union while still have a trade deal with eu . 
  however , i ca n't help but feel it 's like a women 's shelter sending a woman back to her abusive man , because it gives russia more reason to try to push ukraine towards it . 
  monkeys ? 
  really ? 
  fair enough !, 
  just shows my ignorance , but that white area was so tempting a target for it . 
  so am i !, 
  you can really play `` spot chernobyl in ukraine '' on that map . 
  my personal take on the reason for him saying that is that he put the opposition in a tough spot . 
  either they have to campaign on a no reform platform , invent money ( or overspend ) and seem financially unreliable or cut costs associated with immigration and expose them for the risk of being seen as racists . 
  but that 's just my uninformed take on it . 
  there was another poll that was reported a few days ago ( [ link in swedish ] ( http://www.dn.se/valet-2014/majoritet-for-att-ta-emot-flyktingar/ ) ) 26 % think sweden should accept more refugees , 36 % think the level should be the same , 32 % would like to decrease the amount and 6 % said `` do n't know '' . 
  in an election where 3758951 voters voted for 20 seats in the parlament , meaning that each seat takes about 5 % of the votes , or 188000 votes . 
  just to keep the perspective . 
  that 's how you get invaded . 
  ah , no , the swedish state radio has a program each summer where different more or less famous people get 1 show each where they tell their story and play some music . 
  i did not listen though , so i do n't know what he was talking about . 
  few swedes have heard of gustav trolle , but everyone learns about kristian tyrann and stockholms bloodbath ( and sometimes they get told ( incorrectly ) that he 's nicknamed kristian den gode in denmark ) . 
  left-wingers does n't like mannerheim ? 
  how come ? 
  swedish wikipedia had no information about any controversy and i thought he was considered like the greatest finnish person of all times ? 
  [ josef fritzl ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fritzl_case ), 
  i like your thinking !, 
  luckily he is n't known by many above the age of 30 ( well , unless they listened to him on radio this summer ), 
  so did israel . 
  is n't that because of the investor protection parts though ? 
  as far as i know , there does n't exist anything like that between membership countries in the union ? 
  well , he did kill off most of his opposition in [ stockholms blodbad ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stockholm_bloodbath ) and he was king of sweden for awhile , so i think he counts . 
  nah , he 's more of a footnote in swedish history . 
  he was king on paper for awhile , but not in reality . 
  and after his failed war he was deposed . 
  to be honest i do n't think _ that _ many swedes know we shared king with poland for a few years . 
  i have a hard time coming up with anyone for sweden really . 
  the closest i can think of is a danish king called [ christian ii of denmark ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christian_ii_of_denmark ) ( or as we call him kristian tyrann ( christan the tyrant ) . 
  but that 's so long ago that we do n't really hold the danes directly responsible anymore . . 
  fair enough !, 
  i just recall reading those amas a few months ago , and i liked them so much and i just remembered that tidbit about him and dyson . 
  but the reddit legendar / u/touchmyfuckingcoffee ( who basically is the reddit go to guy when it comes to vacuum cleaners says that dysons are n't as good as other brands . 
  [ his first ama ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/1pe2bd ) [ his second ama ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/24rx7e/hi_reddit_im_here_to_make_your_day_suck_better/ ), 
  no more un-employment !, 
   in his speech at the 1974 nobel prize banquet friedrich hayek stated that had he been consulted on the establishment of a nobel prize in economics , he would `` have decidedly advised against it '' [ 24 ] [ 28 ] primarily because `` the nobel prize confers on an individual an authority which in economics no man ought to possess ... 
  this does not matter in the natural sciences . 
  here the influence exercised by an individual is chiefly an influence on his fellow experts ; and they will soon cut him down to size if he exceeds his competence . 
  but the influence of the economist that mainly matters is an influence over laymen : politicians , journalists , civil servants and the public generally . '', 
  from [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nobel_memorial_prize_in_economic_sciences ) . 
  i think it 's an interesting quote that deserves some thought . 
  it 's not the nobel price in economics . 
  it 's [ the sveriges riksbank prize in economic sciences in memory of alfred nobel ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nobel_memorial_prize_in_economic_sciences ) . 
  saying otherwise gives it more gravitas than it should perhaps have . 
  would n't it be better to set up a temporary tribunal like was done in haag after the jugoslav war ? 
  or is the keyword here suspect so that would not be possible ? 
  i wish they would have shown more eu cities , because of the ones named , london was only behind vienna , paris and budapest , while it had prague slightly behind london and athens and sofia quite far behind . 
  the reason for political refugees from sweden is because we have compulsory education and that you are not allowed to home school your own kids as you see fit . 
  so there are a few cases of people that can not accept this and thus move country . 
  ( then we have people moving to other countries for other reasons as well , but not as refugees ) . 
  apart from iceland , i also suspect norway could get fast tracked if they had had any wish at all to join . 
  also i suspect that a independant scotland would be a member before 2020 as well . 
  but of other states i see no realistic candidates . 
  getting drunk for ukraine . 
  hm , i like the sound of it . 
  can we apply for eu sponsoring , something something culture event ? 
  the german hostage i suppose in this case . 
  will this cause eu to back down or will we stand firm in the face of the bully ? 
  out of curiosity , these same links that you spam ( in different threads according to your posting history ) how do they relate to the topic at hand ? 
  care to actually share your thoughts on it ? 
  i do n't see the relevance of the drought in western usa to the problems facing the polish logisitics companies , but then , i 've always been a bit thick . 
  i think we need to be a group of people doing that , those shipping costs looked a bit excessive for one person to go all in and buy a few beers . 
  sadly it only seems that systembolaget in sweden sells different kinds of ukrainian vodkas . 
  ah , see , this is where your knowledge of the english language has you at a disadvantage then !, 
   because to me ( i was going to write us , but i 'm not going to pretend to speak for someone else ) it 's more like `` it 's better to cause a little discomfort to ourselves rather than having someone else cause massive discomfort to us '' so to me ( thanks to my ignorance ) it was a witty comeback . 
  and getting shot in the head is referring to oneself 's position in relation to russia if one did n't take action against them . 
  so to me ( with limited knowledge of english ) it made complete sense . 
  this would be so amazing . 
  [ almedalen week ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/almedalen_week ), 
  i was going to complain that i did n't see any sex , then i clicked the second link . 
  i could see the roof of my house !, 
  do they have an internal competition in russia who can come up with the silliest reason as to ban products or something ? 
  was that one of his polish tweets ? 
  because none in english claimed that . 
  the closest was his retweet that said :  got to check out more convoy trucks this morning . 
   one closed trucks was opened for press . 
  this is n't [ / r/danmag ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/danmag/ ), 
  because it had nothing at all to do with a broader definition of rape ( going into effect around the time you mention ) , counting each instance of rape as 1 case ( even though it can be a person reporting being raped every day for a year = 365 cases ) and in general a high tendancy to report the crime here compared to other parts of the world . 
  what an unpleasant man . 
  yeah , i read the entire thing before i noticed that . 
   danske bank is the part of the danske bank group , the largest bank in europe and one of the leading financial organizations in europe . 
  danske bank group is headquartered in copenhagen . 
  [ source that says otherwise ] ( http://www.relbanks.com/top-european-banks/assets ) what does danske bank group [ say themselves then ] ( http://www.danskebank.com/en-uk/about-us/pages/about-us.aspx ) ? 
   danske bank group , headquartered in copenhagen , is the largest bank in denmark and one of the leading financial enterprises in northern europe . 
  i 'm not saying i distrust putin 's propaganda machine , but if they do n't get their copy paste information correct , i 'm not sure about the rest of the content . 
  i 'll have to admit not knowing what fields wto would regulate , but were n't the west sanctions for financial services and things like that ? 
  would russia care about paying cancellation fees if they break a lot of other wto rules ? 
   enjoy your `` local militias '' with `` store-bought '' armor and heavy weapons  i do n't think a visa requirement would stop those though . . 
  `` a trillion here , a trillion there , pretty soon , you 're talking real money . '', 
  [ misattributed reference ] ( http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/everett_dirksen ), 
   an authoritarian and nationalistic right-wing system of government and social organization . 
  i think you 'll find it somewhat hard to argue sweden fitting that description . 
  in sweden , anabolic -- androgenic steroids are illegal to buy , own , make , sell , give or bring into the country .
