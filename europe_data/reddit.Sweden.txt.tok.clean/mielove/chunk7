  which is good , i guess ... 
  the usa is a great country for tourism , really . 
  all this does is make me wary of bringing my laptop there when visiting ... 
  it depends on the context . 
  danish is n't especially beautiful so i 'm not a fan of danish in ballads or so on . 
  but danish can - like german - sound very badass . 
  i listen to nephew almost exclusively because i like how danish sounds in their songs . 
  yeah , just wish the greeks had a similar attitude when it came to their politicians . 
  but , then again , the greek situation is a bit more complex and it 's easier for them to put up a united front and lay blame elsewhere ( germany ) whilst berlusconi has pretty much singlehandedly ruined the credibility of the italian government and the italians are n't alone in not trusting them . 
  : / it also occurred to me how this question can be interpreted differently . 
  when i hear a question like this about trusting a country i automatically assume they mean the representatives of said countries . 
  but it could also be interpreted as meaning a countries inhabitants , which is another question entirely . 
  anyone know specifically how these questions were asked ? 
  man , the comments here ... especially amusing since the party she represents actually wants to limit immigration . 
  but you wo n't convince the racists anything good will come out of this . 
  fact of the matter is that highly-skilled immigration ( including from non-eu countries ) is exactly what most countries in europe want/need . 
  and attracting said group is easier said than done . 
  but simplifying the immigration process involved is definitely a start . 
  they definitely exist . 
  internationally speaking young men are the most likely to emigrate . 
  problem is that said countries tend to be the ones with the most poverty . 
  small island living is n't most people 's cup of tea . 
  finding anyone willing to live there is fair enough . 
  you have the same problem with small towns in most countries . 
  i know in northern sweden they 're having this issue and have started inviting in russians to live there . 
  i think it 's ridiculous that some choose to focus on the ethnic and/or national `` purity '' of said area instead . 
  you can keep on preaching that from your armchair whilst i think it 's safe to say these communities care more about their survival and livelihood than that . 
  i 'd say they keep putting it on there to spread awareness more than anything else . 
  it 's also relevant that 15 would be considered legal in most of europe . 
  in sweden it 's 15 . 
  ephebophiles have their primary age of interest at between 15-19 , so acting on their interest would be completely legal most of the time ( whilst the same can not be said for pedophiles acting on their interests ) the human brain stops developing at around 25 years of age . 
  yet below that is the age of consent for the vast majority of the world ( and consent for other things ) . 
  so it 's not a black/white issue . 
  i tend to view a 30 + person being with someone that much younger the creepier the younger they are . 
  no amount of it being legal will make it not-creepy that a 30 year old is with a 15 year old since 15 year olds are idiots . 
  but even though i personally find it weird i do think it 's an important distinction to make . 
  sweden performs pretty average when it comes to education worldwide . 
  it used to be better though and the current education system is seen as one of sweden 's biggest problems . 
  it 's hard to say . 
  my personal favourite is [ nu t\u00e4ndas tusen juleljus ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndwia4e4jje ) . 
  it 's a psalm though but most traditional swedish christmas songs are . 
  but on a different note , the most popular mainstream song ( most played on the radio and such ) is nearly always triad 's [ t\u00e4nd ett ljus ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4kcbavmh7k ) . 
   ** an organisation ** protesting against an organisation - which represents an ideology - makes far more sense than protesting against random people committing crimes . 
  the only time that really happens is if they 're protesting against the justice system if they disagree with their sentence . 
  was n't the only person seriously injured in the clash a neo-nazi ? 
  so what `` assault '' do you assume these people are protesting ? 
  rather they 're not protesting a random assault at all but rather the ideology of this organisation ( srm ) . 
  this is genuinely a great attitude to have when something 's out of your control . 
  hell , i know people who are bothered by waiting in a queue for too long . 
  it 's why i bring my ipod everywhere so i can wait in line happily and stress-free . 
  because one is a person ( who also died ) and the other is an organisation ? 
  the people in parliament obviously did n't , and they 're the ones you 'd consider taking into account since it 's their dining room the painting is in . 
  do you want them to hold a referendum for the general population every time they do some interior decorating ? 
  we only found out some people in the general population have a problem with this ** now ** , after the fact . 
  and like i said if there 's a media uproar about it they 'll no doubt change it back . 
  similar things have happened before - like with the tintin thing for instance . 
  this is not some big conspiracy . 
  you 're just giving this situation more weight than it deserves . 
  til the eu used to have an aaa rating . 
  i was sure it had been downgraded already ( as so many other western nations already have been ) - the euro is n't exactly the most stable investment at the moment . 
  sweden is not much of a hierarchical society . 
  and the parliament is extremely laid-back and casual in comparison to other parliaments . 
  it 's believed in theory , like i said , that everyone 's opinion should carry some weight . 
  and since there is no counter-weight - because no one gives a shit - there 's no legitimate reason to not do this . 
  it 's for that same reason that i can gaurantee you that if they were provided a different opinion by a greater number of people ( with petitions or a media uproar ) that they would undoubtedly change it back . 
  so if this personally offends you you 're free to get right on that . 
  it 's a very swedish logic . 
  swedes above all like peace and good relations between everyone ( and the idea that everyone 's opinion carries some weight ) . 
  getting into petty arguments is n't a good thing , surely ? 
  what paintings are hung in a dining room is something most people would n't give a shit about . 
  susanne eberstein obviously disagrees but her personal opinions are clearly minority ones . 
  you 'd find very few avid feminists who have a problem with art . 
  in fact most hardcore feminists support the showing of women 's bodies as natural . 
  point is that replacing that painting clearly makes her happy so what 's the problem ? 
  no one was hurt doing it . 
  if you do something that makes someone happy without taking away happiness from someone else that 's a clear win . 
  that 's a very swedish type of logic . 
  surprised that it surprises you . 
  what feminists or muslims is this offending ? 
  the only person who seems to have a problem with it is susanne eberstein . 
  and they say they switch up paintings from time to time which seems likely if they 're just going to change a picture based on one person 's opinion . 
  so i do n't think this is much of a story unless others had an attachment to the painting ? 
  it 's like if a random person decides to repaint a room - it 's only an issue if others have a problem with it . 
  the logic being that if she 's happy to have it gone why not let her if you have no problem with it ? 
  she may be a weirdo but it makes for a good working environment if people are n't fighting over every small thing . 
  there 's a difference between not respecting privacy and spying . 
  in sweden we have the fra law which enables surveillance of information that passes through sweden ( so largely from our neighbours , including russia ) . 
  this is no secret and therefore hardly qualifies as spying . 
  it should n't come as a surprise either since sweden has always been more about transparency than privacy ( even though the fra law is certainly not without controversy ) . 
  however , all countries have intelligence agencies which no doubt do spy . 
  our foreign minister straight up says we do . 
  but we 're a small country and i sincerely doubt we 're spying on brazil at all . 
  spying in itself is n't too controversial in either case - it 's when you spy on someone you claim to be an ally of that shit really hits the fan . 
  it 's why no one gave a shit when it was well-known that the us spied on iran but lost it when it was revealed they spied on germany and france . 
  is it just me or does reino unido sound like a really good name for a football team ( or a band ) ? 
  also , i hear it 's even more common in portuguese ( and spanish ) for people to mix up sweden and switzerland . 
  now i see why . 
  heh , swedish/finnish fighting has been going on for decades . 
  hell , just look at / r/swarje . 
  do the contents there imply sweden is `` moving away '' from denmark ?
