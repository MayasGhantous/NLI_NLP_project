  :d there 's nothing really different in swedish-finnish relations . 
  they 're no doubt choosing to focus on the baltics for investment opportunities though . 
  but sweden does this too . 
  finland of course has an advantage in estonia though due to linguistic similarities . 
  but both our countries have always had a vested interest in the baltics due to geographic reasons and historic ties . 
  this is not a new thing . 
  i would say so . 
  the fra law was voted in in 2008 after all , and was big news in finland as well ( precisely because most finnish traffic goes through sweden ) . 
  and then people stopped caring there as well as here . 
  immigrants ? 
  i think the biggest immigrant group to austria is germans though but since they speak the same language that does n't count . 
  hets mot folkgrupp is exactly what it sounds like . 
  hets = persecution . 
  if you 're following a black person around shouting insults at them that 's hets mot folkgrupp . 
  being on your own or with friends and talking negatively about black people is n't . 
  people have been cleared before for saying racist things in public by proving it was n't aimed at anyone . 
  and this makes perfect sense to me . 
  the law was put into place to crack down on a certain type of harassment . 
  and i 've never heard of the law being used in the way you imply it should . 
  no one is doing anything illegal here ( or else the newspaper people would report them rather than write about them ) . 
  they 're just responding to assholish behaviour by being assholes themselves . 
  but that 's tabloid journalism for you . 
  you do n't say ... that 's pretty much been the status quo since the cold war . 
  naturally the fra law has been controversial in sweden since it was voted in but that 's because people thought it would be used to spy on swedes . 
  one of the main arguments for implementing it was that it would allow for intelligence gathering of foreign sources ( predominantly russia 's ) . 
  so it 's not like this is a surprise to anyone ( including russia ) . 
  iceland , forever forgotten . 
  precisely . 
  pasta with sausage and ketchup is practically a traditional swedish dish . 
   you can eat it with pasta and meatballs or meatsauce too . 
  but always with pasta . 
  eating ketchup with potatoes or rice is n't something that 's done . 
  seriously , i wonder what people in other countries use it for . 
  hotdogs or hamburgers i guess , but how often do people make those at home ? 
  you 'd be surprised how often this is n't the case . 
  ideally this would be true ( since why else have an eu passport ? ), 
  but it does n't always happen in practice . 
  so sd 's proposal is n't as outlandish as some would think and could technically be legal . 
  it does sound chinese but there 's something quite slavic sounding about it too . 
  i 'm betting it 's a central asian language or a northern chinese one . 
  or how about mongolian ? 
  if i were to take a wild guess that 's what i 'd go for . 
  i 'd be interested in knowing as well . 
  it 's a very pretty language . 
  spain is quite well-known for having a bunch of different regions wanting independence . 
  recognizing a breakaway region in another country would not be in their best interest . 
   you answered 9 of 20 questions correctly . 
  i 'm happy with that considering i know very little about the balkans . 
  i 'd say the idea behind it is that citizens should have more rights than foreigners . 
  banning swedish citizens from begging would be deemed to be more of an infringement on personal rights . 
  non-citizens on the other hand are n't privy to the same rules as citizens in most things . 
  i 'd like them to focus more on the organised crime aspect of it though . 
  it 's that which should be illegal , not the act of begging in itself . 
  people who genuinely beg ( and i 'm sure there are a few even in sweden ) should n't be on the run from the police . 
  i 'd say they 're in a pretty dark and desperate place as it is ... 
  til . 
  we say `` murcl '' here too . 
  i 'm talking continentally - not the actual southernmost/easternmost points since islands tend to be a bit of a special case . 
  yeah , it 's not . 
  using the more `` extended '' definition of europe the continent ends in the south with turkey and in the east with the caucasus countries ( armenia , georgia , azerbaijan ) and russia . 
  kazakhstan is a central asian country geographically . 
  that 's not to say it 's all black-and-white though . 
  the reason it 's no doubt included in / r/europe is because many so-called `` eurasian '' countries are torn between identifying between europe and asia . 
  kazakhstan does after all have quite strong historical and present ties to europe . 
  both `` europe '' and `` the middle east '' are highly subjective definitions . 
  by many definitions the caucasus region is indeed a part of europe . 
  there 's no reason not to include them here . 
  we can only draw definitions of what ** certainly ** is n't europe - if you 're reached central asia you 've gone too far east and if you reach the so-called `` core '' middle-eastern countries of iran , iraq and syria you 've gone too far south . 
  anything inbetween is borderline . 
  everything i know about azerbaijan i learnt from [ this song ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4-u6tgx1t4 ) . 
  * accusation ( by one person - hardly the clinic coming `` under fire '' )  the doctor who filed the complaint charged that the clinic , located in v\u00e4stra g\u00f6taland in western sweden , had violated sweden 's personal register law ( personuppgiftslagen - pul ) . 
   `` as far as i know , this is ** not in accordance with pul to register ` origin ' , that is , ethnicity for a person in healthcare , if there is not reason , ** '' he wrote in his complaint . 
  * response :  when probed by data privacy watchdog , the county health board defended the practice by ** explaining the `` non-nordic '' registry helped alert authorities to families that could belong to certain risk groups ** through travelling to countries where diseases might be prevalent , such as tuberculosis or hepatitis b. 
  * solution :  however , health officials admitted that ** registering `` non-nordic '' as a `` diagnosis '' in patient health charts was a mistake ** that occurred in the wake of a efforts to coordinate data between paediatric clinics and primary care clinics . 
  [ ... ] the data inspectorate advised the board to ** improve and to clarify its procedures ** for how it records information when it comes to newborn babies . 
  so to sum up this is a non-story . 
  one doctor complained about `` non-nordic origins '' being listed as a diagnosis and the paper-work is now being rewritten to include a more appropriate section . 
  it 's true that sweden does n't do ethnic registry but it can be noted ( as the accuser even says ) when there is need for it . 
  and naturally lukashenko [ sends his greetings ] ( http://www.tvr.by/eng/news.asp?id=11430&amp;cid=20 ) . 
  what a pair ... 
  what is taught here is that what is now finland used to be part of sweden and swedes and finns ( and others ) used to live in the same country . 
  so yes , as a part of us . 
  not surprising that that 's not the way it 's seen in finland but that is how it 's seen in sweden . 
  of course finns were seen as being under swedish rule - so were swedes . 
  finland is not seen as having been a colony though if that 's what you mean - and sweden has had many colonies in the past . 
  look at it from the swedish viewpoint for a second . 
  it 's not like the name `` sweden '' or the term `` swedes '' always existed . 
  the area called sweden was home to a number of different ethnic groups ( including finns , svear , g\u00f6tar , sami , etc ) . 
  the people with scandinavian heritage were clearly predominant though and is how swedish became the language of administration . 
  but the others continued to live in sweden like everyone else . 
  it helps that sweden was never a feudal society so there was less of an ethnic class conflict . 
  and then in 1809 sweden lost one of its provinces to russia . 
  this was the province in which finns were the predominant ethnic group although like elsewhere in sweden it certainly was n't homogeneous . 
  point being that sweden did n't really change too much after this . 
  finland did - there was a nationalistic revolution in finland and the creation of a finnish national ( as opposed to ethnic ) identity . 
  but in sweden there continued to be a lot of finns ( finnish-speakers ) in the country . 
  it 's not like finns are immigrants to sweden ( which is something i feel most finns do n't realise ) . 
  finns have always lived in what is today sweden and continue to do so . 
  so yes , it 's a bit hard for swedes to see finns as `` being under swedish rule '' since they 're still a part of our country in our minds and some of us are finns ( and many of us have ethnic finnish ancestry ) . 
  in swedish we make a distinction between * finnar * ( ethnic finns ) and * finl\u00e4ndare * ( people from the nation of finland ) .
