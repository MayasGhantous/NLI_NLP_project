because giving people a place to live when their home is a war zone is the right thing to do no matter what skin colour they might have !, 
  bildt is extremely charismatic but politically he did some [ seriously questionable stuff ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carl_bildt#controversies_and_criticisms ) . 
  that does n't necessarily say anything about the immigrants . 
  it could just as well mean that we have to do a better job when it comes to integration in europe . 
  if you came from a war zone and you 're discriminated on a regular basis , ca n't find a job and feel like everyone wishes you 'd rather not be there of course it will be harder to become a part of the society . 
  no other country in europe comes anywhere even remotely close to sweden regarding the number of war refugees allowed to stay ** and ** bring their family ( that 's actually very uncommon within europe ) so of course there will be challenges but simply giving up just because it 's not easy is not an option , we 're talking about human lives here . 
   when you count unemployment , you only count those who are actively looking for jobs . 
  very true . 
  and some countries , like germany for example , are extremely good a making their numbers look pretty by not counting all sorts of people who do n't have a job but are in some kind of useless `` further education '' or `` training '' the job agency forced them into that has nothing to do with what they learnt or want to work as but keeps them out of the statistics . 
  i 'm not a fan of people on banknotes in general , love the backsides though . 
  did n't the americans do the same with the whole `` snitch out your commie neighbour '' thing ? 
  today 's `` if you see something , say something '' campaign were people freak out over muslim neighbours is n't too far off either . 
  regarding the rest : the police admitted that they were * not * attacked as they first said to justify their violence . 
  as for injured cops : this is the stuff they usually do n't tell you ( same thing happens at football games in germany all the time ) but almost all injured cops they mention were cases of `` oops , our own guys got hit by our tear gas '' which are counted to make the protests look more violent than they were . 
  and sit-ins might not be legal but surely are n't violent and certainly do n't justify the force used by the police . 
  you never went to a protest in germany then . 
  the german cops are brutal ( no , not all of them but there are certain groups within the police force famous for trying to escalate every protest into a violent mess ) . 
  nsfw : http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/bild-722939-136833.html this photo was made at a protest against the reconstruction of a train station . 
  the protesters were absolutely peaceful , the police was n't . 
  this guy lost an eye . 
  they also used plenty of tear gas against school kids . 
  and we 're talking about actual 12-year-olds here , not rioting teenagers . 
  dude , leave norway alone  : o, 
  so does stockholm . 
  after iceland ( 95 % ) , sweden has the highest share of people using the internet within the population ( 91 % ) and , except for maybe south korea , probably the best telecommunication infrastructure in the world which people can use for very reasonable prices . 
  that might explain why a rather small country has such an active subreddit . 
  that 's what i heard in the radio this morning as well . 
  i think they would have mentioned if anything but the security features will be updated ? 
  that 's a point a lot of people seem to miss . 
  many refugees do n't come to your country because they wan na suck you dry , they ** want ** to go home if they can . 
   where is this happening ? 
  which part ? 
  tolerating nazis was extremely common in german stadiums in the 80s and 90s . 
  and people whining about ultras bringing politics into sports ... just look around , it 's everywhere , even in this thread . 
   the opposite of these banners would be something like `` no more refugees '' or `` stop the refugees '' . 
  i do n't think those banners would not be welcomed . 
  those banners would get you your ass kicked and rightly so . 
  because they would be the sign of a morally bankrupt society . 
  what kind of sick bastard would someone have to be to tell people fleeing from a war to go away ? 
   all the major religions are intolerant in their very essence , yet we have to tolerate that . 
  tolerating something does n't mean you have to like it . 
  seriously ? 
  there 's a bit of a difference between christians telling you being gay is wrong and some people telling someone from a war zone that they can piss off . 
  i 'm bi and i 'm definitely not a friend of any kind of religion but i would n't dream of comparing the intolerance i have to endure from religious people with what the men , women and children go through who have to leave everything behind and run for their life because there 's a war . 
  come on . 
  i was pointing out how `` neutral '' fans never seemed to have a problem with nazis while now whining about anti-fascists bringing politics into sports . 
  personally i never assumed you can do sports without politics . 
  if you talk about ultras trying to keep nazis & racists out of the stadium : i would n't call that hypocrisy . 
  being a racist is n't having `` an opinion '' , it 's being an inhuman asshole and at some point you just have to draw a line because tolerance towards intolerance makes no sense whatsoever . 
  exactly this . 
  it 's mostly `` keep politics * that i do n't agree with * out of the stadium '' . 
  it was n't so long ago , in the 80s and 90s , when those people did n't raise an eyebrow over obvious nazis standing right next to them , chanting some rather questionable stuff . 
  i do n't know enough about them to give an informed opinion about where they stand politically but yes , they 're friends with usp so it 's safe to assume that they 're at least not leaning to the right . 
  it definitely did n't just disappear , they had some trouble with those folks just last season but at least they 're putting up a fight unlike some other fan scenes ( looking at you , aachen ) . 
  st. pauli is maybe the only club where the vast majority identifies as left-wing but celtic has pretty great supporters as well and they have a long-standing friendship with the st. pauli fanbase . 
  in most other german clubs it 's mostly the ultras who are antifascist . 
  the question is just if basic rights of minorities should be up for debate to the majority as other things are in a democracy . 
  that 's a good point i did n't consider . 
  my first thought was that the rights of minorities should not be up for vote for the majority . 
  i think because helping people from war zones is more important than pleasing the locals who were lucky enough to be born in a peaceful , comparatively wealthy place . 
  tell me about it . 
  someone like berlusconi having any amount of legislative power over us is something that makes a zombie apocalypse seem not so bad all of a sudden . 
  so that 's what they call a false flag . 
  but enslaving other countries really is not something one should be proud of : /, 
  i do n't know , when i read that part i thought `` what an ass to imply ending the colonisation of the world was some kind of failure '' . 
  an american , at least one voting for the republicans , might think imperialism is great and something to be proud of but the rest of the world would probably disagree . 
  nordic union , anyone ? 
  then everyone can be happy ;d, 
  i think estonians see themselves more as a lost sibling of the nordic countries rather than eastern europeans , no ? 
  are n't they even of finnish origin ? 
  vienna is a great place to see if you like cemeteries ` tho . 
  i absolutely agree , we spend one week in paris on a school trip and everything but the louvre was rather boring . 
  [ the crowd ] ( http://www.panoramas.dk/da-vinci-code/louvre-mona-lisa.html ) in front of the mona lisa is ridiculous so when my class mates tried to fight their way through it i took off to see the sculptures and they were astounding , probably the most beautiful things i ever saw . 
  no one can force them to pass certain laws or fine them for not doing so ` tho . 
  and i would n't be aware that eu citizens can vote on eu legislature , how would they ? 
  most parts of the eu legislative , especially the powerful eu commission , are not even democratically elected . 
  i do n't think it 's only right-wingers . 
  i 'd consider myself very far on the left and i 'm absolutely pro-immigration but i hate the fact that the eu can get so involved with national legislature since quite a few laws coming from the eu-level are right from what would usually be done in , for example , scandinavian countries . 
  germany would be another example . 
  conservative politicians tried to get internet censorship and data retention laws through there and failed due to fierce opposition from the streets but now the eu is working on getting the same stuff into national laws and since eu commissions are n't democratically elected they do n't give a fuck about what the people think about these orwellian laws . 
  oil or not , i 'm pretty sure norway is rather glad they never joined seeing what 's going on in the eu right now with other countries being told how to do their economics ( greece , italy etc ) , others being fined for not spying on their citizens enough ( sweden , germany ) and so on . 
  this was not in the german parliament by the way and they 're not members of the german parliament ( the bundestag ) , this party does n't have anyone in the german parliament . 
  it happened in the parliament of saxony , a german state . 
  that 's indeed exactly what they wanted . 
  actually the * only * occasions you hear * anything * from this party are when they put up wanna-be scandals like this . 
  it 's a known neo-nazi brand and was worn solely to provoke . 
  you could try [ this ] ( http://www.sportlemon.tv/ ) if you do n't care for hd quality , 
  why are we having all this red carpet + military music nonsense anyway ? 
  i 'm genuinely curious . 
  just photo op ? 
  yup , exactly my view . 
  if hurts so much less to pay taxes when you can see so many good things both for you and others to be done with your money . 
  maybe it can be seen as a sign of freedom ? 
  might be a bit far fetched but at least people feel like they 're able to make such decisions without worrying about religious stigmas and the knowledge that * i * can decide when and how to end my life was always something that made me live a better and happier life . 
  oskar lafontaine was pm there for ages and did a decent job , that 's why the left is going so strong there . 
  and it 's nice to see that people too smart to fall for the social democratic scaremongering regarding the the left . 
  technically germany does n't have a constitution either . 
  but you ca n't really read this map at `` this is the place to move to if you want to enjoy full gay rights '' anyway because , for example , while the uk is ranking first they do n't have gay marriage which is probably far more important to most people , for practical reasons , than something rather abstract like being mentioned in the constitution . 
  i guess they tried to avoid having to face the rather controversial topic of children getting born by males . 
  if you 're interested in the reasoning you could ask the politicians in the countries ( e.g.
