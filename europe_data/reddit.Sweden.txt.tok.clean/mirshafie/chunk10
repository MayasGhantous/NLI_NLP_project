  first of all denmark and sweden is not exactly the same , especially in food prices . 
  but for the sake of argument let 's assume they are the same . 
  then let 's make an example of costs from sweden for a family of five : 1 adult man ( 2310 sek ) , 1 adult woman ( 1810 sek ) , 1 boy aged 10-17 ( 2420 sek ) , 1 girl aged 10-17 ( 1880 sek ) , and 1 child of 2-5 years of age ( 930 sek ) . 
  that totals to 9350 sek per month , but as someone else pointed out these costs dont scale linearly so let 's assume that they actually save 10 % of food costs per month . 
  ( this is generous ! ), 
  that 's 8415 sek or 879 euros for food for five . 
  nobody is arguing that it is not enough money . 
  where do you live ? 
  that 's ok you do n't have to come . 
  exactly . 
  with 1470 euros you 'll easily get by even as a family of 5 . 
  you 'll be able to do normal things like go to the bathhouse or to the movies and you 'll afford a gym membership and stuff like that , if you handle your economy well . 
  but not terribly much more than that . 
  according to konsumentverket the typical lowest cost for food for a male aged 18-74 is 230 euros per month , and for females 180 euros per month . 
  ( i just took the averages , it 's higher for young adults and lower for senior citizens . ), 
  this assumes that you get all the nutrition you need , but that you cook all of the food yourself and get basic foodstock only . 
  nice math . 
  it makes for less than 10 euros for food and every other expense per day . 
  come on dude . 
  i clearly stated what i did . 
  the point is that even if every single homicide in sweden was commited in malm\u00f6 there is no way that malm\u00f6 homicide rate is nowhere near say 15 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants which would still be a third of detroit . 
  i 'm not comparing apples and oranges here , i 'm comparing an entire apple to a slice of another apple and pointing out that the entire apple is still smaller than the slice . 
  edit : the math in this post does n't actually make sense . 
  i 'm not interested enough to find the figures for malm\u00f6 ( not as easy as for detroit ) . 
  it should still be obvious that the comparison between detroit and malm\u00f6 is ridiculous . 
  yes . 
  as far as i know all other grenade attacks recently have happened in the malm\u00f6 area . 
  still , detroit has a homicide rate of 54 per 100,000 inhabitants , and sweden as a whole has 3 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants . 
  kinda silly to even try to compare the two . 
  shut up meg . 
  for sure , the internet is bringing us closer together . 
  this happened in botkyrka , just south of stockholm . 
  omg you are so adorable can i take you home ? 
  first of all , halal slaughter is not more cruel than any other type of slaughter . 
  industrialized slaughter has a lot of different cruel components , halal or not . 
  in fact , in some ways , halal slaughter is * still * better than western animal protection laws . 
  * still * after 1300 years . 
  wrap that around your head like a turban . 
  if you want to stand up for animal rights , stop eating meat . 
  at least industrially produced meat . 
  second , turkey does not enforce headscarves for women . 
  iran did n't enforce it until the `` islamic '' revolution , and most people in iran think that the dress code laws are a fucking joke , including the older generation . 
  saying that headscarves is part of their culture is true because lots of people would wear them even if they did n't have to , but it 's also stupidly misleading to the point of being ridiculous . 
  culturally , i 'd say iran and spain are closer to each other than sweden and spain . 
  it 's close , but not close enough . 
  lol can you just look at a map before you write something like that again ? 
  i think you 're confusing sweden with the uk . 
  there are almost no pakistani in sweden and those that do come here tend to be highly skilled . 
  piketen is not fucking swat . 
  [ this is a piketbuss ] ( http://utryckningsfordon.se/wopre/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/polis_vw_caravelle_-2012_-pn.jpg ) . 
  the biggest difference between that and a normal police car is that you have more space . 
  there 's also a lightly armored [ mercedes-benz ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/polisfordon_i_sverige#/media/file:mb316cdi-polisbil.jpg ) , inspired by the danish . 
  it is super unlikely that this was the kind of vehicle that was blown up because they do n't just stand around . 
  those vehicles are used with a purpose in mind not to just pick up drunks . 
  i 'm pretty sure this level of circlejerking is bad for you . 
  at least remember to take your phosphorus supplement . 
  that 's funny because i 'm uncertain what point you were trying to make . 
  not all the people that get turned down are illegitimate refugees . 
  brain development must start at an old age wherever the fuck you 're from . 
  26 % of first time asylum applicants to the eu are from kosovo . 
  the second-largest group is syria at 16 % followed by afghanistan at 7 % . 
  pakistan is at 3 % and senegal is not among the 13 largest groups . 
  there are other reasons to flee from your country than actual war , but the largest increase of immigration comes from syrians . 
  so war is easily the primary reason that people flee . 
  just to be very clear to your slow brain : * primary * reason , not * only * reason . 
  here 's some fucking reading for you , now get a clue before you bother me again . 
  well , i mostly know about sweden , but the way i understood it was that most european countries were the same in this regard . 
  maybe with the exceptions of greece and spain . 
  according to s\u00c4po / br\u00e5 ( swedish intelligence agency and the council for crime prevention ) , as of 2009 there had been 14 counts of murders committed by right wing extremists , and 211 counts of assualt . 
  of the assault cases 96 were directed against the general population ( gays , immigrants et.c . ) . 
  compare this to 0 counts of murder by the left wing , with 152 cases of assault . 
  instead we see a lot more crimes of a nature that do not put lives at risk from the left . 
  this report was made in 2009 and does not include peter mangs ( anti-immigration guy ) who killed two people and failed to kill four others . 
  he was suspected of 14 occasions of shootings in total . 
  his targets were the general population . 
  this is the source : https://www.bra.se/download/18.cba82f7130f475a2f180002415/1371914720927/2009_15_valdsam_politisk_extremism.pdf and wikipedia has a good digest of this report : https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/v%c3%a5ldsam_politisk_extremism_i_sverige now i might be wrong but i believe that the numbers are very similar for most european countries . 
  wow . 
  bleed blue and yellow , sucker . 
  i 'm reading about it now , and for anyone who is n't familiar with this , the guy was [ hans janmaat ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hans_janmaat ) ( apparently there 's a football player called janmaat that will clog up a simple google search ) . 
  it was a fire bomb against a hotel where politicians were holding a meeting . 
  another person had to have his leg amputated after having to jump from a window . 
  most of the hotel was destroyed . 
  so in reply to your comment , i was n't aware of this incident . 
  and as you implied , this incident does n't seem to be widely known . 
  the english wikipedia page does n't even mention the year that this happened . 
  that 's what swedes say about anything south of sm\u00e5land . 
  man , why did finns have to come to sweden . 
  last time i checked the map the baltic sea was inbetween and there was no war going on there . 
  typical welfare moochers , * and * they are way more criminal than the native population too . 
  / no s, 
  to add to your comment , i 'm not trying to refute the fact that left-wing extremists can be violent towards people . 
  a large percentage of the left-wing extremists that are violent are the `` football hooligan '' types ( they are often also involved in `` fanclubs '' , or they transition to them after giving up `` politics '' ) . 
  i know people that have assaulted others in the street just for wearing the wrong kind of clothes ( `` the guy looked like a nazi , worst case scenario he learned a lesson about dressing like a nazi '' ) . 
  of course , there are those other times when afa actually do good , such as when they defend gay pride parades from nazis armed with knives and blunt weapons . 
  i would claim that a lot of innocent people actually have the fuckers in afa to thank for their health . 
  oh man i love being the devil 's advocate . 
  tldr i 'm not trying to dismiss the problem . 
  i 'm just saying that the problems are qualitatively different . 
  come on man . 
  he wrote `` i wish it was acceptable '' , not `` i wish it was legal '' .
