  come on man , you add * nothing * to this discussion . 
  you have like 20 posts in this thread that add * nothing * . 
  step up your fucking game or be content with downvoting . 
  i live with your mother for now , and you are expected for tea this evening . 
  your question did n't seem innocent to me at least . 
  i 'm glad if you 're looking for an actual discussion , but i sort of understand why op felt it was ok to pay you back `` in your own coin '' . 
  as for me , there are certainly a myriad of problems with accepting refugees . 
  some of those problems are undoubtedly directly related to their culture or their experiences with war/extremism/other sucky things that probably turn you somewhat antisocial . 
  however , the problems are vastly exaggerated , and i believe europe has great ability to handle these problems * if * we do n't turn fearful and racist . 
  overall though , denying refuge to people that flee from war is not an option . 
  i ca n't speak for germany , but in sweden a majority of people feel or at least * felt * like ** a ) ** europe is strong enough to handle any number of refugees , and ** b ) ** even if we were to temporarily lose some of our high standard of living to accomodate refugees , it would be petty and indecent to deny people that are fleeing from war and extremism . 
  it 's not hard to enforce closed doors , it 's just exceedingly stupid and cruel . 
  not really . 
  you can describe shit in-depth without being a hopeless bore like tolkien . 
  the first seven pages of b. traven 's treasure of the sierra madre is a description of how ugly the facade of a hotel is , but it 's also funny as fuck . 
  it is a shit book . 
  the only part i really found interesting was when he was discussing how 1 ) every marriage is by nature inequal , in the sense that no two people are equal , and 2 ) any person sullying their blood with that of inferiors is a traitor . 
  so in every marriage , there is by necessity one traitor . 
  ( he did n't write that , but that 's what i take away from mein kampf . ), 
  i 'm just here to point out that afghans are n't arab . 
  i have a $ 500 bill . 
  that 's right , $ 500 . 
  bill . 
  this is from the time when the sanctions against iran were new . 
  bank transactions was n't possible anymore , but europe was still buying oil from iran . 
  so they sent ships stuffed with ... $ 500 bills . 
  the bill is quite ugly . 
  it 's a map of europe and a bridge going west over the atlantic , but america is not showing . 
  my dad tried to exchange like $ 5000 worth of this kind of money at a bank once and the teller had to ask her boss if it was real . 
  dude are you serious ? 
  we 're talking about a situation where * they made an 11-year-old marry a grown man * . 
  and your response is just `` if he gets flak from the family , fuck em '' . 
  i do n't think you have any inkling of what this kind of oppression is like . 
  i 'm supposing that they are claiming that because it 's the truth . 
  you are the one that suggests that they only claim that to get better treatment in the asylum process , but that does n't make any sense to me . 
  not necessarily . 
  think about it . 
  a culture that makes an eleven-year-old marry an eighteen-year-old , does n't just stand by to leave them be after they are married . 
  they 're gon na watch that girl 's belly for changes until it starts growing . 
  this is not a single isolated man that is a paedophile , this is a problem with an * entire * fucked up culture . 
  these marriages are arranged , often without the true consent of the groom as well as the bride . 
  but that of course does not change the criminal matter of their marriage . 
  how dumb do you think they are to falsely claim that they performed an underage marriage ? 
  please do n't project your own stupidity on others . 
  yeah i understand that , but as far as i know it has n't been established that there is a safe way to determine even that . 
  age 20 is the age when dental x-rays basically fail completely , but even before that , it gets progressively less reliable . 
  hand structure x-rays has failed . 
  dental x-rays seem better at first glance , but for me , the jury is still out on whether it works sufficiently well across populations . 
  the problem is that different populations grow at different rates . 
  sometimes vastly different rates . 
  age assessment for one population is not automatically applicable to another . 
  and the critical age of around 18 is harder to determine than younger ages . 
  i mean , the entire narrative of `` it 's not politically correct to use age testing '' is utter bullshit . 
  at least in sweden , we have all kinds of pseudoscientific methods to determine where refugees come from , by speech analysis and interviews . 
  any viable scientific test would be welcomed . 
  people that insist that these tests are not used for * political * reasons are either ignorant or plain morons . 
  okay , but if you read the title of the article you link to , you will find that the study is based on children and `` emerging adults '' . 
  i believe that to find actual information about how good the results are for ages 17 + one might need the full article , but in general , results of dental age assessments dwindle sharply in the late teens to becoming practically useless over the age of 20 . 
  you might also be advised that the paper is researching the viability of dental age assessment . 
  which should tell you that it is n't a readily available technology for young adults . 
  this technique is commonplace for children ( ages 2-8 ) , but is an emerging technology for anybody else . 
  the most common technique for people in ages 17-25 is as i understand it hand radiology , but that technique sucks . 
  what about r/europe ? 
  age tests do n't work the way you think . 
  maybe do some research before you suggest that it should be used . 
  in iran , every girl/woman above the age of 9 is required to cover their hair in public . 
  there are dresscodes for men too , but that dresscode does n't differ in any interesting way from a western point of view . 
  of course , there are some deviations to this in practice . 
  most women actually just wear a scarf loosely on their heads , showing lots of hair . 
  sometimes the head scarf is far back , and occasionally you spot someone that just left her headscarf at home . 
  while diplomats and visitors are showed a certain amount of leniency , the law still applies to everyone . 
  you are of course right that imposing dresscodes is ridiculous , and the fact that many european countries have started banning certain garments is appalling and dangerous . 
  i believe that iran is about 20 years away form removing the hijab requirement . 
  i agree , they are underachievers in all aspects of life . 
  because he killed three people because of political motives , with a clear intention to also cause fear in society as a whole . 
  terrorism is n't about how many people you kill , it 's about instilling fear . 
  that 's why he dressed up as the boogeyman . 
  yeah , it seems that the immigration policy has just been a weird way to push its inadequacy in front of us . 
  it 's obvious that if we 're going to have no interior border , we need to have a common policy for our exterior border . 
  making it necessary to allow people to apply for asylum from the outside of the eu , or to enter in a safe way , which would of course save many lives as well . 
  yes , because israel 's policies have certainly proven to be effective in stopping terrorism , and soon after getting the wall up the pendulum swiftly swung back to the left !, 
  yes , schengen has really been a failure overall . 
  i 'm sarcastic , of course . 
  do sunnis really await mahdi ? 
  i thought they were done with prophets ? 
  the article does n't mention gothenburg being largest in the article , so since you seem to know , would you mind pointing me to the source of the claim ? 
  i remember seeing a map of this recently but i do n't think there was a per-city breakdown that time . 
  the article would n't load for me at the time of writing . 
  but , as i expected , there is nothing in the article to support the claim in the title . 
  sweden is definitely up there if we 're talking contribution per capita , which would push gothenburg to be up there as well . 
  my problem with the title is that it sounds absolute , and that even if we take relative size into account , is still likely to be false . 
  considering that the overwhelming majority of the people from europe that have joined isis are from france , i would assume that this article is wrong . 
  it 's the price you pay for using a cheap form of humor . 
  this sub has no sense of humor , so always remember to end your posts with '' / s '' . 
  the point of a social meal is the shared experience . 
  there must be more to this story than this . 
  foreign diplomats * in iran * are allowed to drink alcohol in private , wine or whatever . 
  ( in fact , alcohol can be prescribed to anyone by a doctor . ), 
  it 's just a fact off life . 
  more education = less kids .
