  check out idiocracy if you want a humorous take on it . 
  but you were first . 
  make the americans change their name !, 
  iranians do this too , but only for words that are foreign to them ( ! ) . 
  they have no problem pronouncing * s * otherwise . 
  i do n't * choose * to interpret you incorrectly . 
  i 'm trying to interpret you correctly , and i think we 've talked this over enough that i think i understand your actual position . 
  the problem is that your original comment gives an entirely different vibe . 
  it is not just me that feel that way , several people feel that way . 
  that 's why i 'm suggesting that you think about how you communicate . 
  it is a two-way street after all . 
  i 'm not here to fuck with you , i 'm here to explain how and why i reacted to your comment . 
  so if you feel like i interpreted your comment incorrectly , that leaves us with a couple of options . 
  it 's either because i 'm malicious , or perhaps stupid , * or * you need to think about how you phrase things . 
  ok , let me spell it out for you . 
  stating that they were n't consulted is just plain false . 
  they were consulted , it 's just that they happened to clearly be a minority . 
  that 's the first part that should have the warning bells ring in your own head . 
  the second part the overall phrasing of your comment . 
  being unhappy about being in a minority is not a green flag for violence , something that you seem to agree with . 
  the phrase `` it 's like some people are unhappy '' is not the emotional equivalent to `` some people are unhappy '' . 
  we all know that some people are really unhappy with germany 's policies , we 're not fucking stupid . 
  but you go on to imply that their concerns are justified . 
  `` giving their country away parcel by parcel '' is clearly something we are supposed to wince at . 
  so the overall interpretation of your comment is that * germany is not a democracy * these poor people have no way of controlling their lives peacefully * germany as a country is being destroyed bit by bit * these poor people had to act * they did , and we 're supposed to * understand their `` concerns '' * rather than be concerned that they are using political violence against innocent people if that 's not what you meant , i would suggest that you think about how you phrase things in the future . 
   it 's like some people in germany are unhappy that they were n't consulted about giving their country away parcel by parcel . 
  super insightful . 
  your contribution is highly valued . 
  i was going to write a long-winded discussion about what democracy is , but ... come on man . 
  in the end you are actually making excuses for political violence in a democratic society . 
  yes , it is . 
  the primary reason that refugees favor certain countries , aside from already having family in the country , is the probability of positive response to their application within a reasonable amount of time . 
  he means that the people claiming to be syrian are not syrian in reality . 
  which is of course speculation on his part . 
  always remember : it is their job to prove that you are guilty , * it is * *** not *** * your job to prove that you are innocent * . 
  the reality is that the police uses many different techniques to make suspected criminals crack . 
  sleep deprivation is not that uncommon , where they keep the flourescent lights on day and night . 
  interrogations may last extremely long times . 
  the fact that suspected criminals may die in the holding cell should be some sort of indication , although i hav n't seen any such cases in the european news lately . 
  ( they do n't die as a result of direct torture , but as a result of willful negligence . ), 
  ironically , the swedish view of drug users is n't that they * have * a medical condition , but rather that [ they * are * vectors of infection ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/nils_bejerot ) in an epidemy . 
  were n't consulted ? 
  please stop insinuating that germany is not a democracy , it 's fucking pathetic . 
  word , that goes into the hall of fame . 
  source please . 
  no , that 's because people like you go around perpetuating the claim that our culture is getting gang raped by the foreign hordes `` because we 're too soft to do anything about it '' . 
  but frankly , i do n't care what clueless people think about sweden . 
  they * are * allowed to sing it , please do n't make unsubstantiated claims about my fucking country . 
  ok i 'm going to fill you in on the fucking news . 
  the pepparkaka bullshit was because of two separate incidents . 
  two silly incidents that * are not the fucking law * in sweden , as you seem to pretend from under your news-less rock that somehow also has internet access . 
  these were the two incidents : * one school ** class ** had a vote on which songs to sing for their christmas celebration . 
  they decided not to include the one gingerbread song that exists . 
  the teacher ( ** one fucking teacher ** ) decided that since there were no songs about gingerbread men , nobody should dress up as a gingerbread man . 
  but one kid wanted to be a gingerbread man and told his parents ( good kid , stand up to your fuckin teacher ) . 
  there was an outrage in the media and the dumbass teacher had to let the kid dress up as a fucking gingerbread man . 
  ** it had nothing to do with racism or allegations of racism , and it was rectified the moment people learned about it . 
  ** * the other case was because the churches wanted a `` traditional '' celebration of christmas , and they decided that your `` 200 year old '' tradition of people dressing up as gingerbread men was not traditional enough so they said `` not in our church '' . 
  they also said fuck the little santas , no such hedonistic nonsense in the house of god !, 
  oh but santa is white !, 
  who fucking knew and who fucking cares -- christians are crazy and it 's their right to be . 
  oh but please , do n't let facts stop you from badmouthing sweden on the fucking internet some more . 
   where the hell are you getting your news lol from his mentally challanged facebook feed . 
   i would need to move in order to keep my children safe while the country is being handed to foreigners . 
  it 's never been safer . 
   i hate that their culture is taking priority . 
  bullshit claim , pure and simple . 
  how do you come up with this stuff ? 
   we ca n't even sing the national anthem at schools anymore because it may offend people . 
  lol . 
   imagine all the ancestors we have that died for our land lool . 
  that is not what he said . 
  he said that he wanted others to understand his pain , not get revenge . 
  i mean he was batshit crazy but there 's still a difference . 
  the ikea stabber wanted swedish people to `` feel his pain '' or whatever . 
  a terrorist on the other hand , wants people to change their ways by fearing continued attacks . 
  in general , a terrorist has a clear message that is prepeared beforehand . 
  breivik is the perfect example of a terrorist : he spent years writing ( cut-and-pasting ) his political manifesto , and emailed it to loads of different journalists before his attacks . 
  it 's emotional versus political . 
  yeah , i know how you feel . 
  not a day goes by that i do n't hover over that unsub button . 
  the ratio of shitpost to argument is just way too low . 
  i do n't feel qualified to comment on that , but , there is the issue of how rape reports are made in sweden . 
  the definition of rape is quite broad , many crimes get reported twice , and there 's a relatively good support-network for rape victims which means rapes actually get reported . 
  that 's true . 
  actually , thank you for pointing that out -- i needed that . 
  there 's been a lot more emphasis on good news lately , what with tedtalks and many exclusively-positive facebook pages . 
  dude , think before you post . 
  also , sweden is safer now than ever . 
  and it was pretty safe to begin with . 
  it was n't even confirmed that anyone was chanting `` slaughter the jews '' or whatever . 
  in either case , every country has their nutjobs . 
  i 'm not going to call you out on what your right-wing extremists do , eventhough they are * way * ** way ** worse than anything we 've got to show . 
  man , do you actually have zero shame in your entire body ? 
  do you * always * have to spin every tragedy into your anti-immigration bullshit ? 
  the reactions are n't all that different . 
  we knew early-on that the perpetrator of the ikea murders were asylum seekers . 
  what more was there to know ? 
  the guy stabbed himself and could n't be interviewed until his condition was stabilized , when his motives were revealed . 
  it was not like he had a facebook profile or even any friends that could testify about him .
