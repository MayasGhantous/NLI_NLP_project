  there was simply nothing to say , and any reporting would have been speculation . 
  of course , bullshitters like you immidiately started with misinformation about how there had been a beheading and that the attacker had screamed `` allahu akbar '' . 
  these things were not denied by the police , because the swedish police does n't concern itself with heresy . 
  your lot took that as confirmation that you were right . 
  when in fact , that was ( obviously to anyone with half a brain ) utter nonsense . 
  the guy even turned out to be christian . 
  not that it matters of course . 
  now , i know that you personally did n't do any of those things . 
  you 're too smart for that . 
  but you fit very nicely into the flock of angry white males that need someone to articulate their fucking bullshit fears with well-placed half-truths or whole-lies that sound catchy . 
  the only person that loves to spread misinformation is * you * . 
  it 's impossible to choose one culture when you belong to two . 
  i 've grown up with two languages . 
  the moment i started to speak , i already knew that there were two equivalent ways to say the exact same thing . 
  i 've grown up living in two different countries , quite different in culture . 
  i do n't feel like i do not belong any less because of it . 
  on the contrary , i feel like i have a clearer view of what certain elements in my cultures mean . 
  or what certain proverbs really imply . 
  choosing is not an option . 
  both cultures are elemental to my entire being . 
  being black does n't prevent you from being racist . 
  i got my hair cut by an arab yesterday who complained about all `` negroes '' being impossible customers . 
  but i suppose he 's not a racist either . 
  people never want to hear the good news . 
  wallowing in psychological dirt is as human as human can be . 
  `` they '' , the mainstream media , are not the ones that report the ethnicity of the attacker . 
  does n't matter if they are white or not . 
  they report the nationality and that 's it . 
  we only know that the attacker was white becuase expo and other secondary news sources reported it . 
  or , we could have of course checked for ourselves . 
  it has nothing to do with pushing an agenda , it 's about * not * pushing an agenda . 
  if your first thought is `` he may have done it because the color of his skin '' then you 're really oversimplifying how minds work . 
  yes , skin color can definitely influence your motives , your perception of your place in society , societies perception of you , etc. 
  but it is not likely to be a primary reason for any act . 
  in this case , it seems like the attacker 's skin color ( white ) seemed to be related to the skin color of his victims ( black and brown ) . 
  but it is a secondary relationship . 
  the primary relationship will be that the attacker was mentally unstable . 
  he was probably painfully aware of the widespread hatred against people like the ones he chose for victims . 
  he chose them because he felt that at some level , the rest of our society would justify it . 
  this is a really interesting phenomenon about anti-social behaviour , how it is often strongly linked to how society as a whole perceives things , and thus has a component of social understanding and a will to be embraced by the crowd . 
  my point is that in a different society , he might have chosen his victims based on different attributes . 
  such as whether or not they believed in god , or whether or not the achieved well in school , et.c . 
  the psychology of being afraid and angry is probably the real connection here . 
  which is also the connection to right-wing extremism . 
  i unsubbed from that cesspool years ago . 
  it appears you were too toxic for the moderator 's taste . 
  and honestly , you should take a good look at how you express yourself . 
  probably coupled with an honest reevaluation of how you view others , as well as your own role . 
  i made a [ thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europemeta/comments/3pskdk/comment_appears_removed_for_me_but_not_for_the/ ) in r/europemeta . 
  [ yes . 
  holy hell are you obtuse or what ? 
  [ click parent until you find the deleted comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3pi4c1/swedish_slaughter_the_jews_rally_slammed/cw6mjd2 ) , and * hopefully * you will realize the context . 
  well , you removed your comment , and i did n't remember your username . 
  i thought someone else was asking what my comment was about . 
  and since the overall narrative on r/europe is that only muslims are anti-semites , i thought it was necessary to point out that that is n't the case . 
  i do n't know why you feel the need to hide your identity , though . 
  if you do n't feel insecure about it , the what is the issue ? 
  i respect it if you do feel that way , but i would like to understand why . 
  and i do think that you 're wrong about the left embracing bigotry . 
  sweden rules , dude . 
  `` welfare '' as in cash money from the state , help with paying rent , et.c . 
  people that get those things are `` on welfare '' . 
  things like free health care , and school for the children have been negotiated recently , because it was fucking * disgraceful * that anyone would go without those things . 
  however , the person in question was claiming that * they get welfare * . 
  they do n't . 
  the person in question went on a rant about how sweden sucks across the political spectrum , and that he feels helpless for having to hide his jewish identity at university . 
  i will not try to pretend that antisemitism does not exist , and frankly , it is * not * ** not ** # not just a problem with muslims . 
  many ethnic and normal swedes have antisemitic sentiments as well , eventhough it 's hard to weasel it out of them . 
  so while i understand his frustration , i do think it 's a bit overexaggerated . 
  we need to be vigilant against racism , and we do have work to do in that department . 
  but hiding his identity is ultimately his own choice , not something that he is forced to do out of necessity or out of safety concerns . 
  even jews that are assaulted on the streets are attacked verbally , not physically . 
  the same goes with vandalism . 
  physical attacks with antisemetic motives actually went down in the past years . 
  edit : gahahaha i love how i 'm getting downvoted , [ go check br\u00e5 ] ( https://www.bra.se/bra/statistik/hatbrott/anmalda-hatbrott/antisemitiska-motiv.html ) you fucking cretins . 
  it 's always good to keep history in mind , to be humble , and to be vigilant of what may become . 
  but overall , europe is fine . 
  we 've been through ten years of depression , but all it really meant was some cuts in luxuries . 
  people are still getting their educations . 
  we still reduced emissions . 
  we still improved infrastructure . 
  although things are a bit scary right now , i think it 's so much easier to see the good things . 
  things are getting better all the time , yet people always want to pretend like they are getting worse . 
  life is so confusing sometimes . 
  nah , i got you now . 
  as i 'm growing older i 'm starting to find the eurovision-monsters more and more cute , though . 
  and i do understand that it 's unsettling with antisemitism . 
  i mean , as a non-jew , i find it disturbing , but i know from personal experience that racism directed toward one 's own group actually hurts even more , eventhough it should n't and no matter how little you actually identify witht that group . 
  in this particular case , it does n't seem like they are actually chanting `` slaughter the jews . '', 
  but in either case , i do recognize that antisemitism is on the rise . 
  my jewish friends in malm\u00f6 do n't seem to dislike it here , though . 
  what , you 're saying you did n't feel welcome because of eurovision , because you 're a jew ? 
  are we memeing or what 's even happening here ? 
  it 's not even confirmed that they are chanting `` slaughter the jews '' . 
  several people in this thread that speak arabic deny it , including an israeli guy . 
  sweden is n't perfect . 
  xenophobia is a problem . 
  but to say that jews are n't safe is completely baseless . 
  physical antisemitic attacks are virtually non-existant . 
  now , i do n't want to downplay the effect or seriousness of non-physical attacks , vandalism , or hate-speech , but i think it 's important to keep in mind what we 're actually talking about here .
