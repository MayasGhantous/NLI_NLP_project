  why did n't you feel welcome ? 
  i 'm seriosuly curious . 
  there were a surge of attacks in the 90s , but i think this time they really outdid themselves . 
  arson attacks against refugee centres is sadly not a new thing . 
  dude , take a deep breath and let that knot in your belly loosen up a bit . 
  of course not , you have to compare either of those numbers to the total for that year . 
  in either case it 's awkward to compare either of those numbers to the total cited in the article , without further information . 
  that was my point . 
  how do you derive the number of people allowed to stay dispite asylum rejection to be 2/3rds ? 
  again , i do n't read german , but that does not seem to follow . 
  you ca n't just ascribe that status to the remainder . 
  do you mean [ this ] ( http://www.heute.de/asylpaket-im-bundestag-abschiebepraxis-in-deutschland-40551060.html ) article ? 
  ( thanks for letting me dig up the link , that was fun . ), 
  i do n't read german , but does n't this say 190k is the total figure * at the moment * ? 
  if so , the number that has willingly left or been deported need to be added to the total before calculating a ratio . 
  the number of deportations seem to have been 10900 in in 2014 , plus 8178 for the first 6 months of 2015 . 
  but deportations doens ' t necessarily translate to amount of people that have left . 
  anyway , just using these numbers ( which i 'm sure is * not * enough ) , would yield that 9 % have been deported since 2014 . 
  what we do see according to the article is that a high number of people go into hiding rather than be deported ( 52500 , ~ 25 % ) . 
  many of those may have already left germany . 
  the source of all of these figures is reported to be dpa , not destasis or whatever agency that collects the data . 
  and so to my opinion : people that stay in hiding is terrible from a humanitarian point of view . 
  however , they are not a strain on the economy . 
  yeah , the metro and tram stations at solna centrum look deceptively close on the map , but as far as i know they 're actually about 1 km apart . 
  i 'm not sure about the rest , i do n't live in stockholm . 
  but it sounds very strange to me that you had to walk a long way outside . 
  stockholmers are notoriously intolerant of inconvenience . 
  there is usually some trick to things like this in my experiece , like it 's way better to change to a bus at some point . 
  but as a tourist you often just want to stick to the railways . 
  yeah . 
  i mean , it 's going down to the level where you are now , not down to another level below you . 
  i think that 's why they made the distinction . 
  but it 's weird . 
  i 'd like to believe that a large group of people can fathom the effect of genes on our personalities without shouting race war . 
  i 'm afraid that basing opinions on faulty information is the bigger threat . 
  science itself is neutral , but the conclusions drawn from it are never neutral . 
  rape is n't always about physically overpowering the victim . 
  but even then , weapons and threats can be used by anyone . 
  additionally , erections do have an autonomous component to them . 
  just like lubrication of the vagina is not necessarily a sign of `` arousal '' in the `` i * want * sex '' kind of way , arousal is n't required for erections . 
  apparently this is sometimes used in torture : rig a live wire over their dick and force them to have an erection . 
  the blue line connects closely at fridhemsplan , but then only to the green line . 
  but the walk at t-centralen to the other two lines is quite long , 500 m is probably a good guess . 
  there 's a 100 m walk between the metro and the tram station for roslagsbanan at stockholms \u00d6stra . 
  the reason why they are not connected directly is that the metro is underground while roslagsbanan is entirely above ground . 
  it should be noted also that roslagsbanan continues a long way beyond what 's shown on the map . 
  the tram routes are longer with fewer stops and fewer trains . 
  it would n't be viable to have metro to liding\u00f6 or roslagen , the population density is just too low . 
  the metro is 109 km long and has 100 operating stations . 
  [ here 's a map ] ( http://www.urbanrail.net/eu/se/stockholm/stockholm-map.gif ) ( the new inner city light rail is not shown ) . 
  when you quote a figure , please provide a source . 
  otherwise it 's hard to distinguish between personal opinions and informed estimates . 
  i just want to point out that nobody is allowing anyone to stay just willy-nilly . 
  the non-refugees that apply for asylum are supposed to be deported , but they still have to get their claims processed fairly . 
  the process of doing so may be very ardous but it does n't change the intention . 
  they are even [ openly discussing race war ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3osfyb/billionaire_donald_trump_brands_angela_merkels/cw09hwx ) now . 
  the stress level of these people can not be healthy . 
  all the factors that you describe do have an effect , and when compounded they can be said to account for a significant change in fertility rate . 
  yet , [ if you look at the graphs for fertility ] ( https://www.google.se/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=sp_dyn_tfrt_in&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:swe:deu:cze:gbr:can:ltu&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ) and pay special attention to the year 1992 when czechoslovakia was dissolved , you can see that a similar dip was also seen in sweden and lithuania for example . 
  i 'm not saying that it 's a random coincidence , because the economy and stability of europe are affected by all of the other countries . 
  but it 's a bit too simplistic to say that economic incentives for parents alone have a significant effect on fertility . 
  so the problem is n't kindergarten accessibility , it 's that she wanted to work from home , which i admire and understand . 
  but you see , even incentivizing that sort of parenting ( which i 'm in favor of ! ), 
  * still * would n't have a significant effect on fertility rate . 
  [ and the reason for that is that your original statement is completely unfounded .

  and yet , you have a [ higher fertility rate than germany ] ( https://www.google.se/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=sp_dyn_tfrt_in&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:swe:deu:cze:gbr:can:ltu&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ) . 
  sweden and the uk have vastly different views on child care and economic incentives for parents , yet have the same fertility rate . 
  i mean of course , it sucks that child care is not more accessible . 
  but the statement that child care availability is a main factor in fertility rate is unfounded . 
  social and economic incentives for parents do have an effect on fertility , but it 's very small . 
  browsing r/europe you will notice that there 's a certain group of people that like to pretend that the low fertility rate in western europe is a problem ( which it is n't ) and that it has been engineered by creating a situation where parenting is hard . 
  of course , the rights for parents have never been better than they are now . 
  source ? 
  in what developed country is child care inaccessible ? 
  something along the lines with `` if you want to see islam spread , you need to be a decent person and influence people by your own good example , not by being a total fucktard in a tribal clusterfuck . '', 
  you 're right , i 'm chaning it . 
  the 10 % figure was from one of the articles i read . 
  considering that many school shootings came with a warning , it 's understandable that they want to take it seriously . 
  however , it is of course not feasable . 
  lund university is a large part of the inner city of lund , and has campuses in malm\u00f6 and helsingborg . 
  it has 50000 students and 10000 staff , so ~ ~ 10 % ~ ~ 4.7 % of the population of sk\u00e5ne is affected by this . 
  the original oregon threat seems to have been translated using software , or more likely having been translated in the * style * of translating software . 
  a 4chan user [ posted a jodel screenshot ] ( http://boards.4chan.org/int/thread/49169849#p49170088 ) , mocking the reactions to the threat and claiming responsibility for the post further down in the thread .

  for the same period , hate crime directed towards people of african descent increased by 24 % , with vandalism increasing by 68 % and hate speech by 72 % . 
  most of these crimes are not directed against any indivudual in particular , so the absolute number of people of african descent that experience it should not matter .
