  this depends heavily on what kind of work you do now , on any education you may have et.c . 
  if you tell me more about yourself i might be able to give you some direction . 
  you can of course apply for a work permit while you are already in sweden . 
  ohhh look it 's mister sense and reason , creeping up from behind and owning me . 
  what can the government do realistically though ? 
  those people are not spawned in a vacuum . 
  `` separation of religion and state '' . 
  indeed . 
  sadly , the deteriorating state of sweden 's mental health services have been known for a long time , but there seem to be no political will to make any improvements . 
  even with the murder of [ anna lindh ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anna_lindh#murder ) in mind . 
  i 'm not sure what the rest of europe is like in this regard . 
  conservatism as in the political philosophy , not the political movement . 
  i gave you that label because you 're arguing that the rate of political change should be at a certain level , which is the main argument of conservatism . 
  ( an unrealistic argument , in my opinion . ), 
  i do n't think you 're a racist . 
  i have no idea , you 're an internet stranger . 
  based on statistics i assume that you are not a racist . 
  i think either me or you ( or perhaps both ) are getting a bit confused . 
  you 're claiming that the change in europe over the last decades to social freedoms ( women 's rights etc. ), 
  were not cultural . 
  yet the regression in these rights ( by elements of immigration ) are cultural , i take it ? 
  i would say that europe has changed culturally , and quite fast !, 
  it 's not perfect but the things that have happened to the attitudes towards homosexuals is astounding . 
  overall , we 're more embracing of differences . 
  i personally hate tattoos but , i remember as a kid people with tattoos would not be able to find jobs , and now it 's probably more common for young people to have tattoos than not to have them . 
  that 's * us * changing culturally . 
  it 's not in front of our eyes , it 's within us . 
  either way , the things that you do list as cultural are quite trivial . 
  except for your community rights and responsibilties , i do n't think you can have expectations on any of those . 
  maybe i 'm the one who 's wrong here , i will acknowledge that i find it hard to empathize with your sentiment that celebrations for instance are important because i personally have never cared for such things . 
  but all of those things sound highly personal to me , and also things that will not change negatively due to immigration . 
  finally , you 're asking if posting on the internet is not a way to contribute to change in our cultures . 
  to a small extent yes , but if it is muslim immigrants you 're worried about then i would say only indirectly so and probably not in any positive way . 
  ah , the bleatings of conservatism , the plea for less rapid change . 
  it 's adorable . 
  but change is the only constant of the universe . 
  if you do n't like * the way * things are changing , then you need to go out and actively influence them to change in some other way . 
  but if you do n't like * change itself * , then you 're fucked , my friend . 
  because things change . 
  the version of islam that is spread and shaped by saudi arabia is an immense threat . 
  however , the threat is not that of a cultural shift , but rather the actual things that their culture result in in terms of destruction and violence . 
  it should be abundantly clear that their ideology is weak . 
  it can only exist through foreign money . 
  it can only hold its position by force . 
  the muslims that come to europe will pick up the positive things from our cultures , and we can pick up positive things from theirs . 
  violence can only be prevented through better and more open societies that creates opportunities for everyone to pursue their way of life . 
  that 's a fact that applies to any population whatever its demographics . 
  if there is a government in place that guarantee to not use torture or the death penalty .

  it 's so funny how you dance around the answer but do n't seem to actually be aware that you do . 
   interference in the flow of information . 
  this is a bit bold . 
  i 'm someone who will * always * defend the right to free speech , even hate speech for all i care . 
  but what they are talking about is policing content that is already illegal in germany , i.e. 
  catching hate speech . 
  that 's not the same as censoring negative articles about migrants . 
  i 'm not sure about that . 
  what can be said is that the number of reported antisemitic hate crimes have gone up by 39 % since 2008 , and that about 30 % of the reported hate crimes come from malm\u00f6 . 
  however , the number of violent hate crimes against jews have * gone down * by -18 % in the same period . 
  [ source , anti-semitic crime rates start at pg 50 - swedish only . 
  ] ( http://www.bra.se/download/18.6b82726313f7b234a5839/1372231125861/2013_16_hatbrott_2012.pdf ) 29 % of anti-semitic hate crimes directly involve nazi symbolism . 
  in [ interviews with jews in malm\u00f6 ] ( http://skma.se/blogg/2015/03/berit-wigerfelt-och-anders-s-wigerfelt-att-leva-med-antisemitism-ny-studie-av-situationen-i-malmo/ ) , many claim that the perpetrator is often a person from the middle east . 
  however , somewhere around 55 % of anti-semitic hate crimes are unresolved . 
  ( this by the way means that you could in practice go and check exactly who the perpetrator of ~ 45 % of the hate crimes are . ), 
  according to br\u00e5 , the main reason for the low rate of solved crimes is that a large percentage happen anonymously . 
  the by largest ( and fastest growing ) category of hate crime againt jews is hate speech , and that by far happens mostly on the internet . 
  what i personally take away from this is that different groups of perpetrators are responsible for different categories of hate crime . 
  from the interviews , it seems that if you were to be attacked ( verbally , physical attacks are almost nonexistant ) on the street , the perpetrator is more likely to be of middle eastern origin . 
  but that only makes up a small percentage of anti-semitic hate crimes . 
  it is worth noting that anti-semitic hate crime makes up for 4 % of the total hate crimes in sweden ( the same as hate crimes against roma ) , and that [ hate crime * in general * is on the rise ] ( https://www.bra.se/bra/brott-och-statistik/hatbrott.html ) . 
  that one has very limited news value internationally . 
  the second attack however * carries immense value * , because it shows that the authorities are not handling violent people in the asylum process in an appropriate manner . 
  try reading the article . 
  no , i think you 're wrong . 
  the language in the press release you linked to is ambiguous , but if you click the link to the smi supplementary appeal you can read that * `` unhcr is planning for ** up to ** 700,000 people seeking safety and international protection in europe in2015 . '', 
  my emphasis . 
  that 's the total of refugees expected in europe by the end of 2015 . 
  * the same number is planned for for 2016 , possibly higher . 
  * `` unhcr 's activities in sub-saharan africa for addressing the protection risks of refugees and migrants moving irregularly will target more than 208,000 people in 2015 and 236,000 people in 2016 . '', 
  those are targeted outside of europe . 
  * `` for the purposes of this appeal , the north africa subregion has a planning figure of 27,000 people in 2015 and 55,000 people in 2016 . '', 
  again , this includes efforts outside of europe . 
  submitted again because automoderator . 
  [ it was on r/europe again with updates , 2 days ago . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3mw1fm/in_swedens_ikea_attack_two_migrants_two_slayings/ ), 
  and it 's gone up even more since then . 
  according to google pde , they were at 2.1 in 2012 . 
  economic incentives do have an impact , but the effect is limited as far as i understand . 
  bear in mind that these articles are not scientific ; there might be a number of other reasons for why fertility has gone up in france . 
  sweden is also getting back towards its 1990 level of 2.13 . 
  the improvements made since then mostly include opportunities for the father to stay at home with the child , which is an economic boost to the family overall given that the man usually has a higher salary ( money given for staying home is based on salary ) . 
  [ ( pg 39 ) , swedish only . 
  ] ( http://www.scb.se/statistik/_publikationer/le0201_2010a01_br_x10br1001.pdf ) however , it is difficult to say whether it is those changes that are the reason for the rise in fertility or something else . 
  well , this is confusing . 
  you 'll have to excuse me but if your purpose was to explain laboe 's comment , then i still need some clarifications . 
  for example , you started your comment off with :  nowhere did he/she mention that `` janne is the only one telling the truth '' [ 1 ] or that `` leftwing violence is the bigger threat '' [ 2 ] . 
  even `` this is not talked about in the media '' [ 3 ] is completely wrong . 
  but laboe states that  [ 1 ] janne jofesson is basically the last honest journalist left in sweden . 
  ...  [ 2 ] most of [ the political ] violence actually came from the far-left ...  [ 3 ] since most journalists are left-wing this fact [ that most political violence comes from the far-left ] was often overlooked .
