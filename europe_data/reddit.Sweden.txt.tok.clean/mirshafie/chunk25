  to point out that those are falsehoods is not to get the sentiment of his/her comment wrong . 
  and the impression that you give when you write something like that is that you are about to give * your own * reasons for why you think those statements are correct . 
  of course you did n't really reinforce anything he said factually ( which would be impossible because what he wrote is not supported by facts ) , but you did repeat them , claiming that his points `` still stand '' . 
  are we not supposed to take this as your own personal support of these views ? 
  then we have ikolla claiming that since laboe 's comment was so heavily upvoted ( it has more upvotes than the thread itself ) , it speaks volumes about the userbase of r/europe since this is not by any stretch an isolated phenomenon . 
  this interpretation would be valid * even if * laboe 's comment was factually correct . 
  sadly , i believe that the vast amount of upvotes come from non-swedes with no actual knowledge of what sweden is like , that have been given a certain image of sweden due to this exact type of lie given over and over and over until it started sounding like the truth . 
  to continue to echo this type of lie is harmful to any sort of constructive debate . 
  well , she 's asleep so i ca n't exactly ask her , but let 's try . 
  [ here 's a link to another comment i wrote that has some basic information about the benefits you can get , that i know of . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3n3tcx/asylum_stabber_attacked_senior_swedish_minister/cvkyudr ) according to [ this ] ( http://www.forsakringskassan.se/wps/wcm/connect/0cace1dd-3163-4d59-be7f-e609ff928ecd/4058_a_barnbidrag_och_flerbarnstillagg.pdf?mod=ajperes ) , my sister would get 3754 sek in barnbidrag each month . 
  she also got a first hand contract with no wait , because it was a rivningskontrakt ( the landlord plans changes which will require her to move out in a few years ) . 
  she got the contract from the public housing landlord ( not sure how to translate kommunalt bostadsbolag ) , so this was not one of those cases where you call 50 landlords and get lucky . 
  according to [ kassakollen ] ( http://www.forsakringskassan.se/privatpers/kassakollen/kassakollen ) she would receive somewhere between 2300 sek and 4400 sek in bostadsbidrag , depending on how they calculate her income . 
  this is based on a 5000 sek rent . 
  with an 8000 sek rent you would get a bit more . 
  since i do n't know what her level of f\u00f6r\u00e4ldrapenning is , let 's assume that she gets the lowest level ( which she does n't ) . 
  that would be 180 sek per day , so let 's call that 3960 sek per month ( based on 22 days per month , not sure if that 's reasonable but whatevs ) . 
  she will get that for a total of 1140 days , given three children . 
  that 's four years . 
  that 's a total of 3754 +2300 +3960 = 10014 sek per month at the absolute lowest of lowballs . 
  it will certainly be higher in reality because you ca n't be at both lowest level of f\u00f6r\u00e4ldrapenning and lowest level of bostadsbidrag simultaneously . 
  after paying her hypothetical rent of 5000 sek she has 5014 sek for food and diapers . 
  ez money ez life . 
  after the 1140 days are over , she will continue receiving 6054 sek per month at least until the kids turn 16 ( can be extended to 20 ) . 
  that pays for the rent and some more where she lives ( where jobs easily exist ) , and would almost pay for the rent in one of your 8000 sek apartments in stockholm ( especially considering the added amount you get with higher rent ) . 
  ** edit : ** i acknowledge that she was quite lucky to get the amazing apartment that she did without any wait ( seriosuly it 's amazing , they have a community gym and chicken pens and everything ) . 
  but in her city , a reasonable wait would land her a similar apartment , perhaps a bit further away from the city center . 
  she does n't need a bus pass which is great and daycare is in the same building , so yeah , she saves a lot of money that way . 
  still though , her lifestyle is not unreasonable . 
  i 'm not saying that your figures are unreasonable , i 'm saying that they are at the extremes . 
  many people will be facing the situation that you describe , but * very * few will face worse . 
  it should also be noted that the jobs you describe can be found in smaller cities as well , where the rent is not nearly as high and it 's easier to find a first-hand contract . 
  ok , so my sister is a single mother with three kids . 
  prior to getting pregnant she had no job and no education . 
  she worked her ass off to get a reasonably high f\u00f6r\u00e4ldrapenning . 
  we 're talking during pregnancy , so not the full 280 days that the f\u00f6r\u00e4ldrapenning is actually based on . 
  she has n't even completed primary school so she worked the lowest paying jobs , mostly taking care of senior citizens . 
  so her f\u00f6r\u00e4ldrapenning will still be nothing compared to any job that has * any * sort of entry requirements . 
  she could afford a car and rent during the first year , no problem . 
  using the money she gets each month , she moved to spain for 1,5 years where she just chilled . 
  now she lives in sweden in a reasonably big city , in the city center , in a three bedroom apartment . 
  she 's * putting money away * each month . 
  this is with her ex-husband actually * stealing * more than two months of all her benefits to spend on a motorcycle . 
  you 're highlighting a broader problem of a housing crisis in sweden . 
  i 'd rather solve that than sink money into further government allowances . 
  but anyway , with a 20000 sek income and 8000 sek rent you get 1400 sek in bostadsbidrag . 
  ( for any non-swedes reading , a 20k wage is easily in the low end , especially for a big town like stockholm , and 8k rent is at the high end . ), 
  1400 sek bostadsbidrag is a small amount of 8000 sek , sure . 
  but then the second parent gets * at least * 5400 sek at the lowest level of f\u00f6r\u00e4ldrapenning ( 180 sek per day ) . 
  i think you can make it work . 
  get to bed , mate . 
  yes , even the hillbillies that complain about seeing immigrants on their way to their fas3 `` jobs '' that they voted into existance . 
  but the main reason they come here is because we have a relatively generous familiy reunification program . 
  it * was * on the international news . 
  you also get f\u00f6r\u00e4ldrapenning ( a total of * at least * $ 9120 for staying at home with your child for 480 days ) and bostadsbidrag of * at least * $ 160 per month until the child turns 18 . 
  this is not a cash problem . 
  in sweden , you get * barnbidrag , that is a small amount of money per child that is given unconditionally each month until the child turns 16 . 
  this varies from $ 55 - $ 110 depending on the child 's age . 
  an extra amount is added if you have more than 2 children . 
  * f\u00f6r\u00e4ldrapenning , that is 80 % of your working wages for 390 days per child . 
  the lowest amount given ( if you were unemployed is ) $ 19 * per day * , 7 days a week . 
  in additon everyone is also given 90 days of the lowest f\u00f6r\u00e4ldrapenning , that is $ 1710 for staying at home with their kids . 
  * bostadsbidrag , that is money for rent . 
  this is based on your rent , but the * lowest amount * is $ 160 per month -- that is if you have no rent . 
  this applies to all families with children below the age of 18 , and to all persons below the age of 29 . 
  * free child care even during the time you 're at home with your kids . 
  * everything else is free , such as doctor appointments and whatever . 
  that does n't work . 
  sweden already does that . 
  there have been studies that show the effects of these incentives are negligeble . 
  here 's the [ wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/total_fertility_rate#factors ) . 
  the true factors are education and health care . 
  [ fertility rate is falling rapidly as countries develop .

  i do n't know about germany , but sweden gives plenty of incentives for people to have children . 
  there have been numerous studies in this field , that show that government mandated incentives play a * very * minor role in affecting birth rates . 
  the effects on fertility rates come from ** a ) ** health care and ** b ) ** basic education .

  it 's possible because sweden does n't take mental health seriously . 
  honestly , to let a guy like that live in a crowded place . 
  that 's just madness . 
  if we know that he 's dangerous and possibly has ties with isis , then why would we send him to some place where isis will take advantage of him ? 
  for all we know , he might have gotten some sort of punishment . 
  ( not any sentence that would keep you away from computers for 6 months though , that would be both illegal and disingenious . ), 
  although it seems like he really needed psychiatric treatment . 
  people like this should not live in crowded places without supervision . 
  allright , thanks for mentioning that . 
  i do n't watch tv since 15 years back so my thumb sort of fell off the pulse of sweden . 
  well , you never know . 
  it might be that the statement is taken out of context as well . 
  reading the article again , it seems that he has only been investigating eskilstuna and is only talking about a certain period . 
  given that , a 95 % rate is not * too * unreasonable . 
  these things are very periodic . 
  it might be that rf in eskilstuna were super active for a certain period in time when the far-right was weak . 
  yeah . 
  this is super important to remember , because , it frees us to question the frameworks that we do have . 
  if the frameworks do n't suit us , we can change them .
