  we 're human , not calculators . 
  if i present data that says `` a is mostly x , b is mostly y but there is some overlap '' and then summarize that data verbally as `` a -  x , b -  y '' then that 's not a dishonest representation , provided i link back to the original data . 
  i feel like you are intentionally trying to misinterpret what i wrote which is tedious , honestly . 
  anyways , i edited my comment to appease your needs . 
  yeah i know what i wrote , but you 're taking it out of the context of this discussion . 
  back up 2 comments , read it , and you 'll be fine . 
  i have no fucking idea how you read my statement as `` they do n't do x * at all * '' , when i 'm the one who posted the statistics . 
  just to make absolutely sure that you do n't misread again : the stastistics show that they use violence * to a lesser extent than right wing extremists * . 
  ok , go check the statistics and talk to me after that . 
  people in this sub have zero idea what sd stand for . 
  it 's so sad that they go out of their way to support them . 
  this is a social and disciplinary problem . 
  the immediate thing that needs to happen is for the police to take this type of crime seriously . 
  the social problem is harder to solve . 
  religious groups need to develop closer ties . 
  the education in schools need to be better . 
  there probably needs to be social programs directed towards adults , in particular parents . 
  ah , the cutting edge linux user . 
  that explains it  but i agree , it still should n't crash your desktop . 
  ok , this guy 's nick means `` affirmative action nigger '' and is claiming that sd is a left wing party . 
  i would take anything he writes with a grain of salt . 
  furthermore , it does n't take `` inside information '' to read expos mission statement , which is to work against intolerance , racism and right-wing extremism . 
  that does n't exclude intolerance from left-wingers , but it 's quite clear what their goal is . 
  they are also very good at what they do . 
  they are serious journalists , and to compare them with fria tider is just pathetic . 
  wait , html5 crashed your desktop ? 
  that 's really strange . 
  if this was some time ago , there might have been bugfixes . 
  you obviously have no idea how reddit works . 
  anyway , you 're more than welcome to create your own sub with blackjack and hookers . 
  i 've had other firefox users complain about similar things lately , and i would assume that it 's not a problem with html5 support but rather a problem with plugin priority . 
  it might help to investigate if there 's a way to make youtube prioritize html5 over flash for youtube . 
  then i misinterpreted what you meant by `` cause no physical harm to anyone or anything '' . 
  the number of completely nonviolent * brott mot allm\u00e4n ordning * can be discerned by subtracting the number of * v\u00e5ldsamt upplopp * , so that would be 391-253 = 138 occasions . 
  however , one should remember that all it takes is one person to throw a bottle , or for someone to break a park bench for it to count as * v\u00e5ldsamt upplopp * . 
  it does n't necessarily mean that anyone was put in danger . 
  the [ s\u00c4po report ] ( http://www.sakerhetspolisen.se/download/18.635d23c2141933256ea1fcb/1381154798654/valdsampolitiskextremism.pdf ) that this wikipedia article takes its numbers from is more detailed , if you 're interested . 
  there are some tables in the appendix , starting at page 191 . 
  category | left | right : -- | : -- | : -- murder | 0 | 14 ( +2 for mangs , in additon to 4 counts of attempted ) assault | 152 ( mainly political opponents ) | 211 ( 50 % political opponents , 50 % general populace ) that 's all you really need to know . 
  i 'm not saying that the rest is inconsequential , but any attempt at comparing the other categories to these two will fall flat . 
  in other words : * in general * the right wing hurts people , and * in general * the left wing hurts proprety . 
  in my opinion a qualitative distinction that is extremely important to keep in mind . 
  ** edit : ** okay so you edited your comment and i feel like i should answer . 
  you really have to pick and choose to come up with that ~ 50 % figure , and it 's also hilarious that you will point out that the left is more likely to commit non-violent crime . 
  that was my point all along . 
  i mean , i can understand if you would discount the by far largest category which is hate speech , because that 's targeted against right wing groups and does n't make for a fair comparison . 
  but it 's beyond me how you thought it was clever to group together nonviolent crime ( except hate speech ) as proof that the left is violent .

  he means that the jews are to blame for multiculturalism and that multiculturalism is to blame for anti-semitism . 
   sweden has had a big problem with political violence for a long time , and most of that violence actually came from the far-left . 
  [ to put it mildly , that 's simply not true .

  well , they start their arabic classes in the second grade ( english in third , unless there has been changes since i went to school there ) . 
  the teachers are generally quite good as far as i know , and the books are okay , so there is definitely an opportunity to learn . 
  as to actual numbers , i have no idea . 
  according to [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/languages_of_iran ) 2 % speak arabic , and i assume most of those are actual arabs . 
  in addition to that there will be others who have decent arabic skills . 
  my guess ( based on personal experience ) is that somewhere around 35 % will be able to read and comprehend a reasonably simple body of text in arabic , and about 15 % will be able to exchange simple phrases . 
  these numbers might be a bit conservative . 
  so , maybe about 2-4 % more that are fluent , in addition to the 2 % listed above ? 
  cellphones have come a long way . 
  you got me . 
  and i tried so hard to shitpost . 
  perhaps we experience the media differently . 
  in my experience very little is said about most perpetrators in general , regardless of who they were . 
  i do not see the pattern that muslim perpetrators get a special treatment . 
  if that was to be the case , it would of course be a problem . 
  another interpretation is that the facts on this crime are coming out just now , because they have been able to intreview the perpetrator . 
  he was undergoing medical operations directly after the murders and after that there has been an investigation . 
  i find it hard to believe that he would have been treated more favorably if he was a muslim . 
  your friend is probably right overall . 
  we ca n't stop this kind of thing from happening entirely . 
  but * some * people can probably be helped by psychologists , and others can probably be contained if we see the signs in time . 
  there has been several cases in my hometown link\u00f6ping in recent years . 
  one was the murder of two people in 2004 . 
  it was a little boy ( an immigrant boy for what it 's worth , age 8 ) that was stabbed to death . 
  a ( ethnically swedish ) woman that saw it happening and was also killed . 
  dna evidence suggests that the murderer was of nordic origin . 
  he 's still at large despite extensive efforts to find him ( as in they literally tested the dna of thousands of young men , including me ) . 
  he is considered to be mentally unstable . 
  [ wikipedia ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/dubbelmordet_i_link%c3%b6ping ) there was the case of an ( ethnically african ) man that beat two people to death , a boy and a woman . 
  this man was known to be troubled . 
  [ svt ] ( http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=83&amp;artikel=5693018 ) the other case i can think of was a young man ( in his 20s ) that stabbed a woman to death at night . 
  she was on her bicycle , on her way home . 
  this was in 2009 . 
  again , no motive . 
  the man was an immigrant for what it 's worth , angry with his life , heavily influenced by drugs at the time and had brought the knife with him in order to commit suicide . 
  [ mordkartan ] ( http://www.mordkartan.se/ ) finally , a 24 year old ( ethnically swedish ) man recently stabbed three women , seemingly at random on the street in the neighboring town norrk\u00f6oping . 
  he was also known to have mental issues , in fact he had spent four weeks in a mental institution three years earlier . 
  his mother had begged for help with his situation . 
  this was exactly one week after the ikea murders , but of course , no reddit thread . 
  thankfully , * nobody died * . 
  [ dn ] ( http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/knivmannen-i-norrkoping-laggs-in-pa-rattspsyk/ ) i 'm sure there 's more .
