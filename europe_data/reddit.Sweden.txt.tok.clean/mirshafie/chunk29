  they were two people who were picked at random . 
  their family might not want to speak about them publicly , although i 'm sure they are loved and missed . 
  so are you saying that germany is not prepared to process 800000 applications then ? 
  i seem to remember that this figure was based on 30 % coming from family reunification programs . 
  no it 's not true . 
  but it is comical . 
  you 're funny . 
  holy shit 54 downvotes . 
  you have my respect loliger . 
  it 's ok , negative karma is the real type of internet points on r/europe , 
  well , he is a human after all . 
  if we want to have any chance of bettering our societies and make them more safe , we could benefit greatly from understanding the motives of criminals . 
  where do wp imply that the general media claimed it was an islamist attack ? 
  they refer to flashback and to facebook , which they describe quite accurately . 
  and it is not an exaggeration that these sources had * immense * publicity at the time . 
  you might recall what this sub looked like during that time , with tons of people claiming that these were islamist beheadings . 
  if you had bothered to read the article itself , it would be quite clear to you that the man is described as deranged . 
  he did , after all , try to kill himself too . 
  i could n't agree more , it is so frustrating that people choose religions that they do n't even believe in to identify themselves . 
  but i guess that realistically , we are all affected heavily by religious traditions . 
  an atheist jew may still have strong jewish influences culturally speaking , just as i have christian values ingrained in me whether i like it or not . 
  the solution as you pointed out is better parenting ( and to some extent education ) , which is something i think society as a whole is tending towards . 
  i do think that multiculturalism is a strength in the sense that it presents multiple choices and a competition for the best practices . 
  i believe that all cultures have strengths and weaknesses and that we could benefit from combining the strengths of different cultures to form better societies . 
  however , all of this must be based on certain fundamental rights . 
  the fact that the rights of many girls from muslim families are denied is a disgrace and should never be accepted . 
  agreed , there is a lot of work to be done in that department . 
  i 'm personally not a fan of banning political expression as has been the trend in europe in the last decades . 
  there must be better ways to ensure open societies , and the road we go down now is a dark one that will only lead to less trust and less freedom . 
  those laws * are * up for discussion ( there are no taboos to me ) , but if we 're really going to undermine human rights we 're going into a deep shithole where majority rule wo n't mean anything anyway . 
  i would also say that on the whole , these laws enjoy immense public support . 
  i write `` on the whole '' because public support must be seen in a probability density manner , since it changes too quickly to base laws upon . 
  the qur ` an is a very special religious element , as you point out . 
  however , there is still tons of room for interpretation and moreover , many muslims `` pick and choose '' . 
  my experience is almost exclusively with shia muslims . 
  okay , then let 's put that aside . 
  it 's true that i have a certain way of defining democracy that may not be the most popular definition . 
  i do however like to point out that my definition is the legal one . 
  because it 's not one of those polar things where it either is or is not . 
  for example , representative democracy does n't even present us with the opportunity to express our views on many matters . 
  yet it also presents the opportunity for people to impose their views on others in matters where they do n't even affect them . 
  so it 's perhaps not the ideal form of democracy , but it still presents us with way more power than many alternative systems . 
  we definitely need to work to make our societies more democratic , and i 'm ready to sacrifice a lot of things for that to happen . 
  however , i 'm not ready to sacrifice human rights for it . 
  let 's take a simplistic example . 
  suppose that 9/10 people hate your t-shirt . 
  it can be argued that they are affected by your t-shirt just because it exists , so they should have a say about whether you can wear it or not . 
  but that does n't even matter to the view that `` democracy = majority rule '' , because they are the majority . 
  so they can vote your t-shirt into the trash . 
  in this particular case , slovakia has signed up on human rights treaties as well as treaties with the eu . 
  they have done so by the albeit flawed ways of representative democracy , but they have done so nonetheless . 
  now their people want to suddenly back out of those agreements . 
  they surely have the right to change their minds , but for this to work on a large scale there needs to be a process that ensures fairness ( otherwise the system will be too easy to manipulate and your vision of democracy falls over ) . 
  realistically though , do you see how this sort of behaviour would be unsustainable for a civilized society ? 
  the view that i 'm presenting you with is not some radical mumbo jumbo , allthough i assure you that the views that i personally hold on this matter * are * radical mumbo jumbo . 
  the fact is that western societies are based around personal freedoms and rights , of which having votes of equal value is just one among many . 
  yeah i 'm using only my own experience with muslims as source . 
  about 60 people who i know well of whom about 25 have expressed support for lgbt rights . 
  some of them have had those values put to the test by being confronted with gay people in the family . 
  at least 50 of these people are in favor of equal rights for women and men , while i only know of 2 ( who happen to be women ) that support the traditional muslim views . 
  they live in an islamic country . 
  i 'm only counting the people who identify themselves as muslim here , not the people who say that they do n't really care about religion . 
  although in my experience that does n't skew the ratios on views of social rights , which is why i think the premise of this discussion is flawed . 
  actually those are some of the exact causes that many muslims do support . 
  well , to answer your question more directly then , i think there are big problems with islam that legitimately need to be critisized . 
  however , we should not apply our views of islam to people that call themselves muslims automatically . 
  the brushstrokes are extremely broad in this sub and that 's why i 've got sand in my vagina . 
  the point of critisizing islam is either that ** a ) ** the people that call themselves muslims listen to us and change or ** b ) ** they become secular and simply put less emphasize on their religion in their lives . 
  for that to happen we need to actually make sense in our arguments . 
  yeah , of course i 'm biased , how could i not be . 
  it 's called being human . 
  the most infuriating thing is a person who thinks he holds objective views . 
  it 's also the most telltale sign that the person really does n't know what he 's saying . 
  it 's not simplistic . 
  it 's just very simple . 
  he also said his mum would flip her shit if he told her that he 's not a muslim , so i would say that islam does affect his life . 
  this is not a contest in who had the worst muslim upbringing . 
  just because your upbringing was worse does n't invalidate his feelings . 
  but for the record i disagree with him too . 
  it 's not a solution to just avoid conflict . 
  it 's your interpretation that stoning et.c . 
  is part of islam . 
  many muslims do not feel that way . 
  they are still not secular , just not violent , either themselves or by proxy . 
  really ? 
  because last time i checked germany was part of the eu . 
  and in the eu , the countries vote on their common interests . 
  but whatever i must be wrong . 
  tl ; dr if you do n't want refugees , then do n't sign treaties that say you will accept them . 
  many societies throughout history have been called democratic , but none of them have been based purely on the idea of majority vote . 
  i submit to you that majority vote is a dreadful idea on its own . 
  there needs to be a framework for it to work . 
  by western standards , we have the right to free thought and free expression for instance . 
  those should be obvious parts of such a framework . 
  majority vote would be a waste of time without them . 
  i 'm not even going to list the rest of the necessities for majority vote to mean jack shit . 
  the point is that whoever complains that their democratic rights are being violated because people come to seek asylum is a clueless twit . 
  that still does n't change the fact that plenty of muslims do `` pick and choose '' . 
   muslim that follow less they religion are better ? 
   the polls don \u00b4 t have simply grain of truth , they show that large ( ranging from 30 to 80 ) groups of muslim worldwide hold certain beliefs that are bad .
