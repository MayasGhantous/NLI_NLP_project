  flags are not that common even on the countryside , and it 's really uncommon in the city compared to most other countries . 
  honestly , i 'm not sure what you 're implying . 
  would appreciate it if you care to elaborate . 
  why ? 
  words evolve . 
  and why the fucking fuck would n't they be allowed to do that ? 
  please , never * ever * write anything about sweden again . 
  thank you . 
  not sure i even understand what you 're saying . 
  anyway , anti-semitism is n't equal to nazism . 
  not every anti-semite is a nazi . 
  does it matter ? 
  but to answer your question : no , it is not normal to fly flags at all in sweden , and if you do fly a flag it 's usually a swedish flag or something non-nontroversial like norway or greece . 
  many jews are not terribly open with their ethnicity/religion , and malm\u00f6 is known for being both anti-israel and having problems with anti-semitism . 
  it 's ok i think . 
  the core of the nazi movement in sweden is very limited and they routinely lose members to exit . 
  `` l\u00e5ngtbortistan '' is my favourite . 
  people from stockholm take some kind of creepy weird pride in calling any place 14 km outside of the city centre but still within sweden 's borders * `` landet '' * , meaning `` the country '' or `` the countryside '' . 
  most of the time it 's not even used in a belittling manner but used casually or in all seriousness . 
  it 's sometimes endearing . 
  * jukkasj\u00e4rvi * is a name of an actual place that is sometimes used as a placeholder for anywhere in the north , mainly because it sounds funny i think . 
  ( it 's a finnish name and finnish just generally sounds funny and above all strange . ), 
  i 've heared people use * `` k\u00f6ping '' * for this purpose for places in the south . 
  k\u00f6ping is an actual town , and the word originally means `` town '' . 
  many towns in sweden have the '' - k\u00f6ping '' suffix , like s\u00f6derk\u00f6ping et.c . 
  i would assume that countless people have used this to construct names for nonexistent towns in the heat of the moment , but as far as i know none of them have stuck . 
  ( * `` flugskitk\u00f6ping '' * would be flycraptown , not as funny as flycrapton , but i might start using it nevertheless . ), 
  being quite backwater myself i 'm not aware of any witty names like the ones op posted . 
  i 'm not even sure there are any worth mentioning . 
  swedish people are n't that funny . 
  you do n't need to tell me about my country . 
  neither do you need to tell me , or an irish person , about the situation in ireland . 
  and just to be very , very clear : everyone is borrowing . 
  everyone is in debt to everyone and when it all comes down to dust it 's all about trust anyway . 
  unskilled immigration or unskilled labour is not the thing that is destroying the swedish welfare state . 
  the main problem in sweden right now is * over-education * , meaning that too much time and money is spent on educating people for things that they do n't need an education to do . 
  this is an accepted truth on all sides of the political debate , yet there is no simple political solution to it , because having that education is what decides who gets the good job . 
  but in reality , it 's a huge drain on time , money , and early-life energy . 
   that you need to put a huge investment in these people for very little return . 
  this is your problem right here . 
  the investment is in fact not anything close to `` huge '' by any stretch . 
  the return you get from these illegal immigrants is usually insanely good . 
  from a business standpoint it 's the dream . 
  from a social and moral standpoint it 's crap but * do n't * use the money argument if you do n't know how it works . 
   genuine refugees are turned away from the eu ? 
  please provide sources . 
  i do n't even know if i should dignify this with an answer . 
  sweden sends back homosexuals to iran with the claim that they do n't have to be `` openly gay '' and therefore do n't have to risk their lives . 
  sweden regularly send people `` back '' , that speak swedish perfectly and swedish only ( and english plus whatever extra they learned in school ) . 
  people that have no family or connection to the place where they are being sent whatsoever . 
  people that we 've already actually invested money in and that are or are about to become tax-payers , but that we refuse to take the returns from . 
  but most of all , anyone seeking asylum must get to the country where they seek asylum . 
  the people that you call `` genuine refugees '' wo n't be able to even make it to spain , let alone sweden . 
  so , refusing `` genuine refugees '' is built in to the system . 
  a genuine refugee can not seek asylum legally , it 's simply not possible , and it 's completely intentional . 
   what was pessimistic about my questions ? 
  you 're saying that they wo n't contribute anything ever and will only be a drain on an already strained economy . 
  or did i read you incorrectly ? 
   our borders are completely open to genuine refugees . 
  wow , okay . 
  whatever you say . 
   i was over in south africa with the niall mellon trust in 2007 . 
  just out of my teens . 
  the locals stood around and watched as we built houses for them . 
  they teared every last one down and sold the materials for scrap by 2009 !, 
  do you have a point ? 
   then why ca n't they build similar houses for themselves . 
  i guess we did n't establish the issue of * there is no trust , no sequrity , no will to create housing because not even the most robust house will stand a decade * . 
  by the way , i 'm not saying that it 's easy and does n't require education to design good houses , but i am saying that the bulk of the actual work can be done by children basically . 
  not that it should be done by children , but it could . 
  it 's got to suck to be this obnoxiously pessimistic . 
  i know you think that you 're a `` realist '' but you 're not . 
  reality is that wealth is created by people in need . 
  reality is that the world as a whole is tons and tons richer now than it was 10 , 20 , 30 , 100 years ago . 
  reality is that the foundation of the monetary system is trust and hope !, 
  the fact that we do n't open the borders to let more refugees in is the perfect proof that there is no real crisis . 
  in a real crisis , all you need is a workforce and food ( and there is no shortage on food ) . 
  ( and no , they do n't need a fancy education . 
  the building you live in was probably built by people with less education than the average african today . 
  so that 's that . ), 
  most refugees do n't come to first world countries . 
  if you think about it , that should answer your very strange question in full . 
   you just need to be exposed to it for a few weeks , then you 'll catch on very quickly . 
  after all our languages really are just dialects of the same language . 
  yes , but it 's too embarrasing because danish people seem to understand everything that swedish people say . 
  really ? 
  you think swedish people sound like they always sing ? 
  i think norwegian people always sound like they are about to drop the punch line to a great joke . 
  love it . 
  sadly , i can never understand what danish people say . 
  but in fairness , how exactly could he add anything here ? 
  maybe he could actually offer a steady grip but anything else would just be for show . 
   polish law does n't allow people who are not members of the family to pay fines for other people . 
  can anyone provide some insight to why they have this rule ? 
  it 's so funny how kebab pizza is considered the swedish national dish by many .

  good burgers and good fries . 
  the only downside is the slightly remote location compared to the inner city . 
  it 's not exactly streetfood but the best restaurant overall is kabab-khaneye safin ( `` kolgrillen '' ) on industrigatan . 
  free soup ( you do n't even have to be a customer !,
