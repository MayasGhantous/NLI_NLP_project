  ) , best barbecue , reasonable prices , great ( and fast ) service . 
  unfortunately many locals do n't know how good it is and they get put off by the fact that the police is sometimes filming you as you go in , so it 's mainly a meeting point for middle eastern and arab people . 
  it 's also a bit remote unfortunately . 
  i have got to agree . 
  i feel like max is n't as good now as it was 10 years ago . 
  it might be the change in leadership or it might be nostalgia , but either way , it 's overrated . 
  yes , and i 'm talking about the far left . 
  what part of the far left is openly anti-semitic ? 
  an inactive maoist group . 
  yeah . 
  i 'm sure you can find better examples than this . 
  i am aware that leftwingers kill people . 
  but it 's not comparable to the physical violence directed at humans that comes out of the european far right , it 's as simple as that . 
  how can you even start to compare gue/ngl with the likes of front national ? 
  are you completely off your rocker ? 
  you either link to recent ( as in past 30 years ) murders by leftwingers in europe or you do n't link at all . 
  i wo n't deny that the left has problems with anti-semtism , but i do n't think that it defines the movement in any way . 
  i am not aware of a `` constant barrage '' of anti-semtic hatred . 
  anti-jew ? 
  who got murdered ? 
  i think the voters know that f !, 
  will form alliances with leftist parties . 
  it has n't exactly been a secret . 
  they are looking to join gue/ngl or the greens . 
  and statistics show that most of their voters are formr v supporters . 
  in other words , they are feminists . 
  feminism recognizes that both men and women are disadvantaged by sexism , however , it specifically recognizes that women are * way more * disadvantaged by it . 
  people that like to call themselves egalitarians seem to have lots of trouble with this concept . 
  for a proper analysis of sexism it is absolutely integral to see how women are relatively more disadvantaged by it . 
  it also directly affects the methods that are proposed to find a solution . 
  really , none of those things are nearly as provocative as a lot of stuff that you can say about all the other parties . 
  also half the stuff you 're writing is n't even true , you 're just bunching the general feminist movement together with the fi !, 
  party . 
  false . 
  over 80 % of fi !, 
  voters describe themselves as on the left of the political spectrum . 
  feminism and egalitarianism are not interchangeable . 
  the aim is the same but the analysis and methods are different . 
  yes , the support structure for raped men is even worse than that for women . 
  well , you 're right about sweden 's high incidence of rape in the statistics have nothing to do with how many cases of rape we have . 
  it 's mainly caused by two things : ** a ) ** very strict and broad definitions of rape and sexual assault ** b ) ** high incidence of reporting thanks to changed social pressures in the last two decades , as well as a good job overall by women 's shelters . 
  the second one is something that i think most swedes can actually * feel * happening , which is why it 's a bit frustrating that the rest of the world wants to pretend that a high incidence of rape * reports * is a bad thing . 
  we 're proud of achieving that . 
  you 're absolutely right that it 's impossible to know for sure exactly what the ratio of false rape allegations are , or indeed exactly how many people in jail for any crime are innocent . 
  that 's why we do n't have the death penalty , that 's why we generally do n't go after convicted people in the media ( in sweden -- they still suffer for other reasons of course ) , and that 's why we have the phrase `` beyond reasonable doubt '' in convictions . 
  beyond reasonable doubt does n't mean `` proven guilty '' in a cosmological sense , only in the context that court needs to carry out a conviction . 
  it is not the role of the police to prove that anyone is innocent . 
  they collect evidence that can lead to a conviction . 
  a lawyer will then try to discredit that evidence , and as one can see from the very low incidence of rape convictions , lawyers do a great job of that . 
  to the court , the accused is supposed to be considered innocent until it has been shown `` beyond any reasonable doubt '' that they are guilty . 
  the reciprocal of course is that to the court , the plaintiff is lying until it has been proven `` beyond any reasonable doubt '' that they are not . 
  that is not always the case , we do n't live in a perfect world . 
  there are definitely biases here that we need to find ways to circumvent . 
  but it 's good to remind ourselves that those are the functions of our legal system . 
  i think he means the [ table that summarizes rumney 's review of the literature ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/false_accusation_of_rape#rumney_.282006.29 ) . 
  one of the studies ( stewart 1981 ) lists a 90 % rate of false rape allegations . 
  of course , just below the table there are some examples of how rumney puts many of those studies into question for sample size but more importantly for methodoligy . 
  those two paragraphs are gold for anyone who thinks false rape allegations are prevalent . 
  especially stewart seems to be an actual nitwit . 
  no , lots of women do not lie about it . 
  there are those who do and that 's tragic for several reasons , but they are n't many in comparison to the amount of actual rapists . 
  you 're thinking of assange ? 
  and it does n't seem like those women * lied * about what he did . 
  it seems like he legitimately behaved like an asshole to two women separately in a way that is considered rape in sweden . 
  but anyways , the investigation can not be carried out because assange is afraid sweden will extradiate him to the usa , which given sweden 's record i can sort of understand . 
  the point is that we should not place suspicion on the victim , because that hurts * all * victims of rape and it dramatically decreases the chance to come to terms with this problem . 
  there should be a normal investigation and only a conviction with evidence . 
  that 's it . 
  this is why it 's important that the media has good work ethics . 
  they should never pursue individuals , that 's simply not the job of a journalist . 
  many people feel like they have the `` right to know '' who 's been convicted of a crime or even who 's on trial , but that 's garbage in my opinion . 
  those people can check the criminal records for themselves , the media do n't need to feed them . 
  as for why these allegations often come up later is because it often takes time for the victim to come out of the shock and talk to people about it , and that 's when they are encouraged to report the crime . 
  it 's still good for statistics and if the perpetrator commits more crimes in the same area , but it 's very hard to solve a cold case like this based on just one report . 
  i would say that on the whole , he 's right . 
  he 's still an asshole , and his predictions about the future are probably wrong , but the description of risk factors for crime having a genetic component are probably true . 
  and it 's not just brain size but genetic factors that contribute to certain traits too , such as paranoia or aggressiveness . 
  it 's not just true on a broad scale , but also within local groups . 
  of course , socioeconomic reasons still weigh in . 
  the fact that african americans are more prone to violence can much more easily be explained by socioeconomic factors than by genetic determinism . 
  i 'm writing this because i think that we * can * handle this sort of information without descending to bigotry . 
  actually , according to his source ( 3 ) east asians have the highest average cranial volume . 
  the difference between east asians and europeans is almost as large as the difference between europeans and africans . 
  so chinese master race i guess ? 
  anyways , it 's bullshit all over . 
  some risk factors for crime are probably somewhat hereditary , but social risk factors still weigh heavily . 
  false accusations are not irrelevant , but there should never be convictions without * evidence * . 
  i know that this is at odds with the need to convict rapists , since rape is a difficult crime to prove . 
  but the * first * thing we need to do as a society to remedy this is to support victims of rape so that they have the courage to immediately get to a hospital after being raped . 
  that way the likelyhood to collect evidence improves dramatically . 
  we should never treat a person that reports rape with suspicion . 
  that sort of attitude drives people away from reporting these crimes in the first place . 
  victims are stigmatized enough . 
   because they do n't have masses of tens of thousands of similar-looking people who are moving between countries to disappear into . 
  there are * far * more europeans moving accross the borders than migrants . 
  of course , the statement that all migrants look the same to a larger extent than europeans is so retarded that it can not be refuted . 
  you got me there , good job . 
   if you seriously think the odds of bringing this rapist to justice are the same as bringing any other eu citizen who began doing this to justice , i do n't know what to say to you . 
  the odds of bringing any rapist to justice are really low , so i 'm not sure that it 's even possible to compare probabilities here . 
   this story also features the victim being told not to report the crime in order to avoid anti-immigrant sentiment .
