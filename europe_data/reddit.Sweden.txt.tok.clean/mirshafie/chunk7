  that 's my opinion at least . 
  nobody important will call you racist for critisizing islam . 
  however , when you start critisizing muslims , we have a problem . 
  because then you 're adressing a wide variety of people that are much more than just their faith , and what you 're critisizing about them has other factors than just their faith . 
  this is something extremely basic that so many people seem to have trouble grasping . 
  also , preemtpting with `` plz do n't call me racist '' or `` many will prly call me racist but '' is to set yourself up to fail . 
  you should know that you 're doing something wrong if you know what the response will be , but do n't understand * why * you will get that response . 
  religion itself is problematic , but right now islam is connected to the most difficult problems in the world . 
  i think it 's very important to point out that this likely has nothing to do with islam as a faith compared to any other religion . 
  you ca n't find your answers to why islamic countries are not so nice in the quran , any more than you can explain the irrational behavior of for example christians with the bible . 
  so , we should critisize behaviours and attitudes . 
  however , when people refer to their faith in defense of their destructive behaviors ( which they often do !, 
  ) , it 's important for us to dissociate this type of argument from the religion itself . 
  because otherwise it 's easy to start judging large groups of people unfairly . 
  i 'm writing this because i 've had a ton of frustrating discussions with muslims growing up , and i had a time in my life when i messed up with my own arguments because i was so frustrated . 
  it is often said that muslims are in some ways `` protected '' from scrutiny by a self-censorship or a wish not to be islamophobic , which i know is sometimes true . 
  ( i used citation marks because i do n't think that censorship is protection at all . ), 
  however , the opposite is also sometimes true : that muslims are expected to take a bigger responsibility for their religion than christians , or that analogue traits in both religions are not judged as equal . 
  to claim that muslims are a group that is ignored and gently danced around is of course not true . 
  however , the rights of many muslims and children of muslim parents in europe are ignored because we often decide that they can sort their own problems . 
  in short : equal responsibilites and equal rights please . 
  yeah that 's not a thing . 
  nobody has the right to have a family . 
  that 's not a human right . 
  so there . 
  this suggests that the largest group by far is syrians . 
  nothing about them being economic migrants rather than refugees though . 
  i 've fired a pistol and a hunting rifle . 
  the hunting rifle is self-explanatory . 
  i fired the pistol because a friend of mine , who 's a hunter , insisted . 
  it is * super * hard to get a pistol in sweden unless you 're in a shooting club and go to regular meetings ( or buy it illegally ) . 
  he was able to get one because he hunts badgers , and to kill badgers safely you need a pistol . 
  i 'm very glad that we do n't have more guns though . 
  there 's no reason why we should have guns in the first place . 
  if the dead start walking i will set up traps , they just walk into sharp sticks and impale themselves anyways . 
  and your proof ? 
  that refugees try to make it to countries that are more likely to process and grant their applications is not proof . 
  stop talking , just do it . 
  it 's funny how when you take educated immigrants , your braindraining poor countries . 
  and when you take uneducated immigrants you 're replacing your gene pool because you 're suicidal . 
  by the way , of course i agree that we need to help locally more than anything else . 
  but it 's not exactly an option when there 's a war going on . 
  this is awesome , thank you !, 
  wow , way to over react . 
  good luck with your life dude . 
  anyways , there are problems that are way bigger than the fact that some immigrants choose to live close to each other . 
  do n't dodge the question . 
  are you claiming that integration fails because swedes are too scarce ? 
  societal pressures could play a role , but i do n't see any evidence that it does . 
  iran for example has a fertility rate if 1.92 , down from 6.52 in 1980 . 
  by comparison sweden has a birth rate of 1.91 . 
  saudi arabia and iraq are also steadily going down . 
  [ here 's an interactive graph from google with some more examples . 
  ] ( https://www.google.se/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=sp_dyn_tfrt_in&amp;idim=country:irn:sau:irq&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=sp_dyn_tfrt_in&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:irn:sau:swe:nld:irl:irq:syr:srb:bol:mex:eth&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tstart=-293594400000&amp;tend=1378936800000&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ) in short , contraception and economic incentives both have very small effects on fertility rates . 
  the big decline in fertility rates are universally marked by ** a ) ** literacy and ** b ) ** low infant mortality rates , i.e. 
  education and health care . 
  as for the smaller variations , i can not tell . 
  according to [ this ] ( http://humupd.oxfordjournals.org.ludwig.lub.lu.se/content/16/6/590 ) there may also be an effect from change in values , but i ca n't seem to open the full article at the moment . 
  as for your question of how to deal with low fertility rates , i do n't know . 
  clearly in the long run we can not rely on foreign labor as those populations will also attain low fertility rates . 
  edit : added some more countries to the graph . 
  the only way to increase child birth rates is to * reduce * social security . 
  the trend is quite clear . 
  it 's called having shit social security , prompting people to get more kids for a ) a higher chance of survival and b ) as a retirement plan . 
  yeah dude , on purpose . 
  also look at for them chemtrails they 're totally gon na get you . 
  i do n't know about germany , but at least in sweden there are so many economical insentives to plop out babies that it 's ridiculous . 
  sure , yeah , it 's even * better * if you already have a full time job when you get knocked up , but it 's in no way necessary . 
  what more can you ask for ? 
  a pep talk ? 
  are you suggesting that immigrants can not integrate in sweden because there are not enough swedes around to mingle with ? 
  well , there 's no telling if they will actually come to any sort of conclusion . 
  in the end we need to cooperate more on the europe-level , i suppose . 
  you 're right . 
  i know you that try to help them and i know that hungary is a great country where many of these refugees could do well for themselves . 
  however , that does n't change : 1 ) that hungary has a very low rate of granted asylum applications , [ eurostat ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/asylum-and-managed-migration/data/main-tables ) 2 ) that you have to apply for asylum in the country where you first register . 
  [ dublin convention ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/html/?uri=celex:32013r0604&amp;from=en ) , ch ii , article 7 \u00a7 2 . 
  yes dude . 
  it 's invalid because they want to come to an agreement , not wave their dicks around . 
  do n't you fucking get it ? 
  this is n't a debate . 
  it would n't even matter if they were the largest party , it still is n't a debate . 
  it often happens that political parties invite a few others for a talk , because they think that their views in a certain field are aligned . 
  say , the social democrats may invite the left , the greens , the centre and the liberals to a meeting , and leave out the christian democrats and the conservatives . 
  then the other parties may of course decline , or they may feel that yes , we can come to a fucking agreement , let 's talk . 
  it 's been * way * less of that since the four right wing parties formed alliansen , which was basically a move to align their own politics and to shut out the other three from decision-making . 
  that 's not undemocratic , it does n't reflect on any democratic value at all . 
  it 's an effectivity or organizatorial issue . 
  further down in the thread you have a guy claiming that people travel throught the length of sweden just to get to finland . 
  i 'm obviously not trying to make the case that you should apply in sweden rather than finland , i 'm making the case that you should apply in say sweden or finland rather than hungary or buglaria , for instance . 
  but since you brought up approval ratios , i pointed out the problem with looking at those . 
  let 's quote you :  it 's precisely why you have to look at whether approval rates are similar . 
  see why you 're wrong ? 
  one has 79 % approval rate , the other 14 % . 
  yet the same probability of approval . 
  see . 
  how . 
  you 're . 
  wrong ? 
  sigh .
