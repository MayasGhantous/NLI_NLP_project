  i 'm going to bed , you can check eurostat on your own . 
  i 'm not arguing the fucking politics i 'm saying that from a refugees perspective it 's retarded to apply for asylum in a country that has granted a dozen applications in six years . 
  approval rates are not similar at all . 
  did you even read my comment or what ? 
  that being said , approval rates can not be compared because the difference in the ratio of decisions made to applications is so large . 
  as an example , let 's take finland and sweden . 
  total applicants were 26k and 290k respectively . 
  decision rates were 5,3 % and 32,6 % respectively . 
  approval rates were 79 % and 14 % respectively . 
  so , finland makes very few decisions , but the most of their decisions are positive . 
  sweden makes many decisions but most decisions are rejections . 
  yet , sweden accepts more than 10 times the amount of refugees that finland does , which is also part of the reason that sweden gets more applications ( family reunification programs are a * huge * part of applications and a * huge * part of why refugees try to get to sweden in the first place ) . 
  i 'm not blaming , i 'm explaining why applying for asylum in serbia is a stupid idea . 
  that 's why i wrote `` granted asylum applications '' not `` refugees currently in the country '' . 
  actually , romania has the highest approval rate in the eu at 15,5 % . 
  so yes , this is explained by a relatively small amount of applicants . 
  however , the other eastern countries have extremely low approval rates , despite the very low number of applicants . 
  bulgaria for instance has 0,6 % and hungary 0,4 % . 
  obviously have 0 % since 0 is also the absolute number of asylums granted . 
  slovakia is at 1,3 % . 
  to say that eastern countries have similar rates to western countries is simply not true . 
  we have the outliers italy ( 0,7 % ) , luxembourg ( 2,4 % ) , switzerland ( 1,9 % ) and belgium ( 1,5 % ) . 
  except from those literally no northen , western or central country is below 4 % . 
  the eu-28 total is 6,4 % . 
  you do realize that certain countries grant very very few asylum applications , right ? 
  making it very , very stupid to apply for asylum in those countries . 
  here 's a random list . 
  the number denotes total number of asylums granted since 2008 , including subsidiary protection . 
  * serbia ( 0 ) * estonia ( 0 ) * slovenia ( 0 ) * portugal ( 0 ) * lithuania ( 15 ) * latvia ( 30 ) * slovakia ( 55 ) * malta ( 55 ) * bulgaria ( 140 ) * spain ( 170 ) * hungary ( 295 ) * poland ( 415 ) * czech republic ( 585 ) * finland ( 1390 ) * italy ( 1555 ) * romania ( 1595 ) * denmark ( 2250 ) * austria ( 10195 ) * sweden ( 13555 ) * germany ( 28880 ) * france ( 44045 ) * uk ( 42975 ) maybe that should shed some light on your `` welfare shopping '' theory . 
  but how exactly is it any better to formally invite them ? 
  that seems so much more dishonest . 
  the meeting is n't a pr move . 
  it 's a serious meeting and actual results are expected . 
  to then have one party there that completely disagrees with accepting refugees in the first place is just a waste of time and energy . 
  uh , in the talk that these parties are setting up amongst themselves , yes . 
  how in the fuck do you fail to grasp the concept of voluntary meetings ? 
  well , no argument there . 
  they * are * all shit . 
  wow . 
  representative democracy means that 51 % gets their way . 
  in this case , 87 % agree on one thing . 
  so if you 're going to invoke the rules of representative democracy , then you just need to accept that sd simply has no say . 
  this talk is * not * a public debate . 
  they are going to try to arrive at a probosal of what to do for thousands of people in dire need of help . 
  people that are fleeing from a dictatorship and the fucking isis . 
  this is * not * a time to measure dicks . 
  this is * not * a time to be friendly to sd for some pretentious idea of inclusion that is n't even sincere . 
  this will be a talk of what can be done , and then there will be a parliamentary vote . 
  sd can voice their opinions then . 
  simple . 
  look , i do n't like any of those parties . 
  in fact , i do n't like representative democracy at all . 
  but just because one party is doing their utmost to destroy representative democracy and the rest try to scramble to save it , does n't make them the cool badboy rebel in opposition . 
  that just makes them an annoying piece of shit . 
  they represent 13 % . 
  whatever support they may have now is irrelevant . 
  they can voice their views anytime and they can do so formally in the debate that will take place in parliament . 
  i live in malm\u00f6 ( 200 m from roseng\u00e5rd ) and you 're full of shit . 
  maybe if you 're a retard . 
  hahahaha sole opposition party dem storhetsvansinne, 
  holy shit do you even think before writing ? 
  nobody is under any obligation to talk to anyone . 
  any sort of talk is voluntary . 
  this still holds true if you are a political party . 
  is this really that hard to grasp ? 
  you have no clue what you 're complaining about , do you ? 
  this is not a debate . 
  this is a meeting regarding how to handle the refugees . 
  they will work on a proposal ( after this initial meeting ) , then present it in the parliament , then discuss it , then vote on it . 
  they have zero obligation to include anyone in this type of meeting . 
  they invite those that they think can contribute . 
  and it just so happens that 87 % of our representatives believe in humane asylum politics . 
  sd would * only * be disruptive at such a meeting . 
  only a fucking retard would complain that `` they have a right to make their voice heard '' as it is completely inconsequential . 
  it 's not a fucking debate . 
  holy shit you make total sense . 
  honestly , this was very well-phrased . 
  can we just be a bit more careful with these numbers ? 
  it tends to go a bit overboard with the hyperbole . 
  not all asylum applications are granted . 
  not even close . 
  in 2014 , germany accepted 48000 out of 202000 asylum applications ( ~ 20 % ) -- that 's in total !, 
  if you figure in positive outcomes for subsidiary protection status and authorization to stay for humanitarian reasons , the figure goes up to 45 % for eu-28 , but is probably a bit higher for germany . 
  i mean , i often get people here say `` will sweden accept 1 million syrians next year ? '', 
  and it 's just so out of whack that i do n't know what to respond . 
  there 's not even anywhere near that many applicants . 
  sweden accepted 33k last year ( 40 % of applicants ) . 
  source : http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/asylum_statistics#decisions_on_asylum_applications, 
  the point is that most syrians that apply for asylum in one of those `` safe countries '' will not get their applications granted . 
  it 's not enough to just * get * to a safe location , you have to make sure that you 're actually allowed to stay for the duration of the conflict . 
  because hungary is far more likely to reject their application for asylum , and since it 's schengen they can only apply once for the entire area . 
  it 's a bad system . 
  these concerns were raised in the beginning ( of schengen ) , and yet , here we are . 
  really ? 
  unless that bag was some sort of magic bottomless kind of deal , i think the kids that did n't push their way to the goodies went away empty-handed . 
  i studied in iran in 2001 , i was 14 years old at the time . 
  there was a guy in a small kiosk on the school ground that sold food , and at lunch time it was crowded . 
  the first day i was one of the first at the kiosk to get my food , but i was pushed away by everyone else . 
  finally the guy in the kiosk had enough and said `` stop pushing that boy , it 's his turn '' . 
  after that he always made a point of trying to get to me when he thought it was my turn .
