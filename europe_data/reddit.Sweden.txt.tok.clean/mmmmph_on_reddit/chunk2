  & nbsp ; this has been a particularly bad problem in the emergency healthcare . 
  http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/stockholm/dramatisk-okning-av-installda-operationer/ rough summary : operations are being cancelled because there are not enough hospital staff to man the hospital beds . 
  this is much higher than the previous year . 
  & nbsp ; to summarize , our healthcare system is facing huge problems , such as too many people needing care and too few there to carry it out . 
  this problem has many factors , and yes , immigration is a part of it due to it bringing in more people than the system is meant to handle . 
  but there are many other factors involved as well , such as underfunding and not enough people wanting to become doctors and nurses . 
  the underfunding can also partially be attributed to spending on immigrants , but this is far from the only reason . 
  so immigration has some to do with the problems our healthcare is facing , but it 's only one factor among many . 
  this is of course just an example , but do remember that things are very rarely black or white . 
  i think he knows , was n't that the point of his comment ? 
  it 's actually true that norway is more democratic than sweden , and as a result is better for it . 
  sweden 's political system has lately had problems with corrupt politicians who refuse to listen to what people want , which is extremely concerning to me . 
  america is one of the more corrupt countries in the world . 
  america is also a very bad democracy , much worse than this index gives it credit for . 
  i did n't say that you should follow this graph necessarily as your rule of thumb . 
  even the most democratic countries have at least some corruption . 
  but they have * less of it * . 
  corruption and how democratic a country has a ** direct ** connection . 
  because corruption , to oversimply , is in essence just power being concentrated in fewer people . 
  a good rule of thumb is that you can decide roughly how corrupt a country is based on how undemocratic it is . 
  as in less democracy = more corruption . 
  the thing is , if you count prison rapes , the usa goes all the way up to at least third place , unfortunately . 
  was n't it legal in the past to go without hijab in iran , before the iranian revolution/coup d'etat ? 
  edit : sort of changed some formatting . 
  persia sounds better than iran in my opinion , even if it is technically wrong . 
  it 's like when people say great britain , but the real name is * actually * the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland . 
  ukgbni ? 
  maybe i should just start calling youknowwhichcountry ** ni ** since uk and gb seems to be disproportionately used ? 
  neither does the united states , britain , germany , poland , hungary , russia , china , persia and many more . 
  can grammar speak very well . 
  what about russia ? 
  some of the areas hungary lost has hungarian majority . 
  i think it 's unfortunate hungary lost areas where there are a majority of ethnic hungarians . 
  most of the territory she lost was n't primarily hungarian though . 
  the world is not always black and white . 
   why in the fuck would a company go into other markets if there are no consumers in those markets ? 
  do they just breathe in and inhale all the monies ? 
  last time i checked , there were still people in europe . 
  i do n't see what you 're trying to say here . 
   the eu , and its origin , is factually to stop a repeat of warfare in our continent . 
  to say otherwise is to prove you are a moron , negating history . 
  the eu is also , factually , a customs and economic union , in it 's orgin , heck even before it was called the eu . 
  if you 're going to relativise the influx , then why do n't we also relativise that sweden has 20 % higher gdp per capita than germany sure . 
  does n't really change anything , does it ? 
   are your patients dying for lack of attention ? 
  are children not afforded their injections ? 
  are hospital beds put out in the middle of the fucking street ? 
  your nhs is fine , and your government can invest more in infrastructure you have a remarkably lower standard than i do for what would be considered * ` fine ' * when it comes to health care . 
  also , built infrastructure with what money ? 
  the swedish state is already running on a deficit . 
   no housing projects ? 
  oh wow , who thought that a trade unionist president , and a commie in charge of the budget could have repercussions to the real economy ??!?!?!, 
   prove to me that there is n't a vetting process . 
  i fucking dare you to tell me people who are let in with criminal records , or no record at all . 
  i know there are refugees that lie about their age , and idiot government workers are too shy to challenge the claim ; but i will blindly defend that no government worker is going to allow in murderers and looters for the sake of being `` politically correct '' https://www.svd.se/manga-flyende-saknar-id-handlingar this means that hundreds of thousands of people have been let into the country in spite of not having proper documents , and then been given housing , welfare and free medical treatments . 
  in my world , this is not a proper vetting process . 
  futhermore , a whistleblower at our migration authority revealed that it was an internal order that anyone that looked under 40 should be regarded as a child if they claimed to be one : http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=96&amp;artikel=6448704 and if the migrant is * classified * as a syrian child refugee , he/she could pretty much stay for the time being and recieve all of the priveleges of being a swedish citizen , without any of the responsibilites of course : https://www.migrationsinfo.se/migration/sverige/papperslosa/ if you were an is-fighter for example , all you have to do is throw away your legal documents , find your way to sweden and then claim you 're child and then they would obligated to let you in . 
  again , in my mind , this is not a proper vetting system . 
  things have finally gotten a lot stricted now , but still , tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of people that have no legal right to be in this country are still here . 
   if you refer to victims of warfare , of fucking course they 're going to be on welfare - they 're running from fucking war !, 
  do you know what fucking war even is ? 
  there is no reason for them to keep shaken after learning the language and knowing they can live in peace , but this process is not overnight , and it certainly does n't help to do a cost-benefit analysis with a stopwatch what i was talking about was mass migration , taking in hundreds of thousands of migrants from all over the world , often without documents . 
  more specifically , i was talking about how that is going to be detrimental to the economy and the financing of the state . 
  i 'm not against taking in a number of refugees from syria as long as they are properly vetted and that we take in a number that we can actually deal with . 
   you need to have an election , and have a conservative party that respects helping the needy , but also puts in plans to make the required changes in your government . 
  in spain , pp has become increasingly unpopular because of making the right calls to fix the economy - reduce influence of unions , liberalise the economy , make firm commitments for outside investments to pour in all sectors of the real economy . 
  and elections mind you are the fucking essence of a dynamic democracy - we can and should fucking change direction every 4-8 years ; what business plan is n't revised every fucking 5 years ? 
  i absolutely agree . 
  sweden needs serious cuts in spending and taxes , or perhaps some sort of tax reform that makes the taxes less punitive for economic growth , ( but that 's a discussion for a different day ) . 
   give me a break with your racism . 
  who the fuck says all these immigrants are low-skilled and have only low-prospects ? 
  many are well-educated , and have only a language to unlock their potential ; others have a gap in education , and will grasp the swedish education opportunity with both fucking hands ; and others still will find their niche in the market , working their way up to small businesses that go beyond and add jobs to your economy . 
  if we are talking about properly vetted , refugees that are coming from syria , or properly vetted migrants in general , these things are true . 
  but when you have a system that lets in anyone and everyone that are essentially completely unvetted because they do n't even have to provide documents , and then give them free money once they come here , guess what kind of people you end up with . 
   migrants , statistically , have a net-positive contribution to the economy - they use health services less , they commit less crime for fear of deportation , and have a propensity to either be successful or move to a more lucrative location . 
  i 'm sure all these things are true for properly vetted and legal migrants . 
  but these things have not been true for the migration wave that has come to sweden during the migrant crisis . 
  it has not have positive contribution for the swedish economy , it has in fact had a very severe damaging effect to the financing of the swedish state at essentially no economic gain . 
  it has only lead to an increasingly strained health care system . 
  and from what little stastistics we have ( the bureau of statisitcs pretty much stopped doing statistics on migrant crime when the migrant crisis begun , * wonder why !? 
  * ) migrants in sweden commit more crime than the native population ( that being , non-migrants ) . 
   if you have thousands of migrants choosing stockholm , it is because your economy is very attractive , and they want to participate in it for a future to themselves and their families back home . 
  that 's not true for most of the migrants that have come lately . 
  for some of them , it 's just because they get free money . 
  for some others it 's because they 've fled from a war . 
  that latter of which i can of course sympathise with . 
   i also disagree with self-segregation , but there is no objective reason saying that the rise of ghettos are inevitable . 
  families of any background do n't want their kids raised in shitty neighbourhoods . 
  it 's because they can not tolerate a non-islamic society . 
  if you do n't believe me , you can go to a muslim self segregated community and ask them yourself and they will tell you that . 
   the new swedish model of integration needs to be brave enough to face a changing democracy and embrace new neighbours , with sound new economic plans for investment , and less taboo about saying when problems arise ( so they do n't blow out of proportion into full on xenophobia ) . 
  there is always opportunity in change very little has been done to integrate these immigrants . 
  an sd victory would overturn the current status-quo , as i defined it . 
  if i wanted to know what people thought about globalisation , i would ask what they thought about specific issues , such as if they approved or disapproved of : customs unions , tariffs , freedom of movement , migration control , trade deals , military cooperation , foreign aid and/or other issues relating to globalisation . 
  of course , you can be more specific than that as well , like specific trade deals , how high tariffs should be , if the eu is good or not , which country should recieve foreign aid and which should not . 
  as long as people actually know what they 're being asked and can thus answer correctly and also that the question has any relevance to what you want to find out ( in this case politics ) : then it 's all good . 
  there will a current status-quo government until at least 2022 . 
  by * current status-quo * i mean the seven parties that have dominated swedish politics for the last 25 or so years . 
  what you said in your previous comment was , among other things :  the business side of it is only a symptom , that enterprises permeate into geographies because of extended customer base . 
  which is false .
