  i do n't know why we have n't given it to you already !, 
  oh hai fellow swede !, 
  `` or foreigner '' ? 
  a bit uncalled for . 
  i 'm a swede in slovenia , and it 's funny to me how interested people here generally are in my home country . 
  also flattering . 
   we also like to make a bunch of not-quite sensitive stuff `` secret of the state '' for vague reasons . 
  but as a swede , you should know that we have more liberal laws regarding public documents than any other country in the world . 
  our system for public documents is more or less unique . 
  yes , ownership of the media is one of the major issues . 
  however , what sweden mostly gets critic for is the press support . 
  which is ironic , because it is there to ensure that newspaper can exist . 
  but people who do not understand the system of the swedish press support , criticize it by claiming it makes news organizations dependent on the money from the state and therefor partial . 
  do n't just blame the capital though . 
  because he has had his fair share of scandals in ljubljana , for example the construction of novo stozice . 
  the thing to remember is that he manages to keep a positive image through very propaganda-like measures . 
  he is known for walking open on the street ( i 've seen him several times as well ) , and talking to everyone , whether they are tourists or just regular slovenes . 
  basically , he 's known as a `` good guy '' , a `` nice person '' , and everyone forgets the allegations against him . 
  so today i learned that in other european countries than sweden , people are even bigger bigots when it comes to the roma population . 
  even the question in the title is bad put . 
  i 'm from that area and while i was surprised , it 's still explainable . 
  there 's higher unemployment , quite high use of drugs now ( in relation to amount of people living there ) and quite high use of alcohol . 
  plus , i can imagine there 's some family feuds and what have you . 
  it 's not fair to say that many of them have nationalist and/or racist tendencies . 
  because many of them do n't . 
  i grew up in a village with lots of these people , and some were plain racists , but most were regular people who just have a passion for cars -- and like a lot of swedes , not many of them cared much about politics . 
  so you downvote * nationalistic * serbs . 
  which is fine , in fact , anyone can downvote whoever they like . 
  and i 'd downvote someone who has a distorted world view as well , like nationalistic * anything * . 
  but people , a lot of the time , see serbians as one type of person . 
  but serbia is not much different these days from other european countries and it 's a wonderful place to visit with nice people , in my experience . 
  serbia was an incredibly closed country by many means . 
  the media was very controlled , so when clinton for example said that `` they '' have to choose whether to get rid of milosevic , based on the grounds that he is accountable for all the killings , or keep him and face the consequences , he was really talking to people that first of all could n't hear him . 
  and second of all , had no idea what mass killing he was talking about . 
  the war was very poorly reported in serbia , and the entire serbian tv was a enormous propaganda machine even before the war . 
  i think it is reckless to say that srebrenica did n't happen . 
  and i did n't claim that srebrenica was the primary motivation for the bombing campaign -- because it was n't . 
  to say that ethnic cleansing prompted the military airstrikes in the first place , is like saying wwii started with a humanitarian strike in poland by hitler . 
  because the clinton administration started bombing on the ** false ** assumption that ** 100,000 ** albanians had been killed . 
  a number that is so preposterous it 's ridiculous . 
  you have to remember that a `` humanitarian strike '' does not exist in the un charter . 
  there is no humanitarian exception . 
  you have to prove your case before intervening in a conflict , and there was no proof of ethnic cleansing in kosovo . 
  edit : and i 'm not going to respond to the rest . 
  because you 're basically war-mongering and advocating for genocide if you think that any civilian or any civilian infrastructure in a nation is a legitimate target . 
  the state serbia was in after the collapse of yugoslavia was much worse than croatia . 
  you guys left along with slovenia , ready to stand alone , with multi-party elections etc. 
  ( which i think is good , do n't get me wrong ) , but serbia was left with only one man : milosevic , still high on the idea of yugoslavia and desperately grasping after every option to keep yugoslavia intact . 
  i 'm completely with you on that point . 
  however , a serb ca n't express an opinion in any forum outside of the balkan without being denoted simply because that person is a serb . 
  it 's a sad truth . 
  seriously , if there 's anything serbians can complain about , it 's the 80 day bombing campaign of their country that killed civilians and mostly civilian infrastructure . 
  this is a bombing campaign that has been widely criticized by people from all around the world . 
  but because they are * serbs * , they ca n't criticize it ? 
  when it comes to heavy bombing , america seem to be able to carry a gloria and deny any allegations that it was a wrongdoing . 
  just look at the outcries as soon as someone criticizes the atomic bombs as well . 
  what you do n't seem to understand though , is that when a country like serbia goes to war in the way it did , not all people are on board . 
  not everyone is a fucking soldier in that country . 
  they are * innocent * civilians who are going about with their daily business , as well as they can in the state of war , and then get killed for what exactly ? 
  and then you excuse it with `` it was justified '' , a sentence that can only be finished with '' ... to kill your fathers , mothers , daughters , sons , cousins etc. 
  that were completely innocent . 
  because * a few * military vehicles were destroyed , and * a few * soldiers died '' . 
  the whole 80 day bombing campaign was planned on false grounds , and carried out on civilian targets deliberately , because they ( the us ) wanted to get to end the conflict in a desperate way -- even though peace negotiations were making big progress , something that 's not so popular to talk about . 
  just like the circumstances with the atomic bombs ... 
   there are plenty of shitty decisions made during the bombings but i do n't think the bridges are the most controversial . 
  shows what a shitty fucking bombing campaign this was in the first place , if civilian bridges being bombed was n't the most controversial act . 
  well , there was an anti-war protest in moscow with over 50.000 attendants . 
  so it 's not all hopeless . 
  russians are n't stupid . 
  this video really need some context and additional information . 
  but those medics are really brave . 
  plot twist : they were n't making fun of themselves . 
  nice ... 
  yes , because hitting kids have been proven scientifically to be very helpful against bad behaviour . 
  while i think it 's important to be a strict teacher , you also have to be a human . 
  leaving someone outside of the classroom for the remainder of the year sounds incredibly harsh -- and furthermore , a lot of students might 've done what you did , just keep on at it , but what about those that does not have as strong of a confidence ? 
  being overstrict works on people who will already do their homework . 
  but those who struggle with school , for * whatever reason * , will fall behind . 
  the entire article is based on one book , written by a journalist living in the us . 
  so essentially , an advertisement ( as / u/nastyasty said ) for said book . 
  do you really need to ask the question , then ? 
  even if i ( i 'm a swede ) would read about kids in the us , i could never be confident enough to write an article with such a certain tone , like this is really the truth . 
  we have spoiled brats , yes , but probably not more than any other very democratic and rich country has . 
  sweden is a very post-modern society , with all its various definitions and entangles included . 
  for example , slavoj zizek puts it nicely when he describes how in a post-modern society , you do n't tell a kid `` you have to go see your grandmother . '', 
  and that 's that , but you said `` you know how much your grandmother loves you ... '' , and in the end , not only do you have to go to your grandmother -- but you have to like it as well . 
  i think this describes sweden well , however , kids can also see through these passive/passive-agressive ways of dealing with them , so it becomes a game of manipulating each other . 
  with that said , i think kids today in sweden seem to be very smart . 
  they speak well , understand quite deep conversations if you just give them the chance and they 're generally well-behaved . 
  at the very , very least drive it 'til the engine is warm . 
  but ideally , drive it to a parking garage if the weather is really harsh and let it de-ice and dry completely . 
  and another thing , do n't drive violently with the engine cold !, 
  leave the fun skidding and rally driving to when it 's warm . 
  do n't worry , i am in the process of severe self-punishment right now . 
  all in the sake for the betrayal of my motherland . 
  my soul will soon be sucked out of me and the king has sent out his men for my execution . 
  i have doomed myself . 
  but know this : i shall carry the swedish flag to my grave thanks to you , foreign friend . 
  no , really , it 's just a c . the n got shot before he could get here . 
  because i do n't know my country 's flag , apparently .
