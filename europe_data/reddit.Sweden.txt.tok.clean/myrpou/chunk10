  what ? 
  it 's not like you 're going to smoke 10 joints a day as a cannabis smoking teen . 
  the cannabis will calm them down . 
  finland is set . 
  well cannabis is probably healthier than tobacco smoking . 
  jenkem or go home, 
  it 's really fashinating , i 'd like to visit . 
  the swedish song just feels like a generic swedish eurovision song to me , boring . 
  i have n't heard any of the others though . 
  you 're right it 's not . 
  no it 's sausage in a baguette with i think some kind of garlic/mustard dressing . 
  [ this ] ( https://danskmadpaaengelsk.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/fransk_hotdog619x340.png ), 
  fucking simon wiesenthal centre . 
  lol, 
  they were smart . 
  i really have no idea . 
  who are these people ? 
  [ hello ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3s6tfia8c8 ), 
  finland is great in design norway has great composers denmark has great movies and food, 
  did people think they did n't mean something ? 
  was actually thinking this too . 
  [ i think ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfrguyw1v8s ), 
  it 's just insane and sexist , i have no words . 
  oh man , anything is anti-american nowadays . 
  bullet dodged . 
  one free alcohol day in all of europe one day every year . 
  the ball is round , it will be interesting no matter what . 
  these teams have n't met in 12 years . 
  oh yeah croatian food is fantastic . 
  great to see juve back to a cl final . 
  they have a bad record in cl finals though unfortunately , and barca is a better team . 
  i still really hope they win though , italian football needs to go back to what it once was . 
  juve probably has the best midfield in the world , so at least there 's that . 
  yes we intentionally seek out islamic extremists to come to our country , that 's how this works . 
  pretty sure it 's more than that , just different sources . 
  housing is the problem , not area . 
  it 's not like we can release refugees into the forest . 
  in average a child refugee in sweden costs 7000 sek ( ~ 754 $ ) a month for the tax payers . 
  they blame the people who rent out houses that expensive of course . 
  they would never take responsibility themselves for the cost . 
  pretty much as sweden then . 
  the migration agency are renting hotel rooms for refugees and have bought up luxery resorts to place them in . 
  how many times has this story been posted now ? 
  that 's original . 
  it 's because they ca n't call themselves anti-racists and feminists at the same time as being racist and sexist without coming up with an excuse for their bigotry . 
  having the cake and eating it too . 
  definitely not . 
  but guaranteeing a person wont be extradited is not standard procedure . 
  you do n't do that before a court case no matter what it is . 
  few people care to be honest . 
  you think it 's good pr to deviate from standard procedure just because some guy is famous ? 
  not in my world . 
  the speciality principle of the uk supreme court means sweden would not be allowed to extradite assange to a third country without permission from the uk . 
  no i was explaining why guaranteeing him not being extradited is pointless . 
  i very rarely see the uk refered to as a shitty member . 
  that would be deviating from standard procedure , everyone should be treated the same according to the law . 
  anyway should the uk send him to sweden he will not be able to be extradited to the us anyway , only with permission from the uk . 
  so basically should assange just show up he will be in exactly the same position as today regarding possible extradition to the us . 
  it 's all in the hands of the uk . 
  maybe he should just show up ? 
  [ even jews ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mischling ), 
  in between svenskarnas parti and nationalsocialistisk front they were called folkfronten . 
  do we though ?

  maybe she should apologise for her hate speech against men as well ? 
  what an embarrassing idiot she is . 
  why would you join a culinary school if you 're a devout muslim ? 
  it 's like studying to become a nurse and being scared of blood . 
  taste pork or drop out , simple . 
  eating pork is the norm here . 
  let 's remember that you can buy likes for others as well . 
  i do n't like when politicians and political commentators use these kind of maps to show how tolerant countries are . 
  one big problem is that things like having hate speech legislation gives you a top score , because that is the opposite of respecting human rights . 
  russia going up , always a good role model for the world . 
  no just incorrect . 
  those are so bad . 
  you really think an american state is as relevant as a country ? 
  i do n't get this . 
  it 's that squary one . 
  why would that even happen ? 
  let 's pretend we 're not on / pol / for a minute . 
  what was the ukrainian population before wwii ? 
  we do n't have blasphemy laws, 
  holy fuck , you need to read some history . 
  i care :(, 
  eh who likes children anyway ? 
  since the source is german we must realise they could have handpicked these to make germany look better . 
  i think it 's obvious to everyone that germany won all the important ones . 
  aww well done you, 
  in general yes . 
  your system leads to more stress . 
   they ca n't be that different culturally . 
  i 've no idea why norway is n't listed , perhaps they educate their people better on stis and stds ? 
  plenty of explanations are possible . 
   sweden is the european mecca of stis . 
  i love how you can only accept that there are differences between norway and sweden if they point to your conclusion . 
  you 've already set your mind , you have no interest in what the truth actually is so fuck it , i 'm done here . 
   you 've just sucked that out of your thumb . 
  i said i do n't think it is and that 's what i think because i know sweden has a very strict legislation on this . 
   which is why i only stated denmark and norway as i knew you 'd pull the `` we 're too different '' card .
