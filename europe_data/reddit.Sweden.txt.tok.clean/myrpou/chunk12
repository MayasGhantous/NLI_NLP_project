  it 's kind of complicated but greenland used to be a part of the eu but are n't anymore despite being a part of denmark . 
  that map is n't showing that . 
  the us probably has more non-religious people though , just not in percentage . 
  why do you think it should be a crime ? 
  religion is an idea so it needs to be mocked . 
   and they think denmark caves too much in to islam and go on compromise with our own values because of muslim demands . 
  what sort of things are they refering to ? 
  they 're probably more german at this point . 
  that happens when you become less evil . 
  yeah we vote for our governments to do that . 
  pretty logical to me . 
  i 'm not norwegian but understood a lot well , they did a good job . 
  their loss , we get to keep monkeys . 
  unbecoming even . 
  your score : 100 % 01:44, 
  he ruined the relationships with more than half of europe and now obama has fixed them . 
  first one is stockholm . 
  certainly not scandinavia . 
  being very tall countries they actually have very changing climates . 
  it 's normal to think that countries you know nothing about are flat complete wastelands though . 
  what animals do you have ? 
  different kinds of rats ? 
  i do n't think you know much about swedish politics . 
  especially germany, 
  we 're also culturally asathru still . 
  i 've read about it happening a couple of times . 
  but if the law being enforced makes the news i 'd take that as a sign that it 's pretty rare . 
  sure but the law is n't exactly working is it ? 
  not really no . 
  good i hate dancing . 
  ^ ^ ok ^ ^ im ^ ^ not ^ ^ actually ^ ^ that ^ ^ selfish , ^ ^ i ^ ^ wish ^ ^ they ^ ^ would ^ ^ get ^ ^ rid ^ ^ of ^ ^ this ^ ^ nonsense ^ ^ law, 
  i kind of wish we would be light green . 
  they 've tried removing the traffic lights in some towns and it actually decreased the number of accidents . 
  of course you would have to do this in a longer period of time to get proper results . 
  they might get less careful over time . 
  a lone student goes crazy in a classroom ranting about islam and the police comes and escorts him away . 
  yep sure sign of an islamic caliphate . 
   sweden needs to do something about their radicalization and immigration problems neighbours are feeling that we will soon have fundamentalist muslim/islamist nation as neighbour ... lol what makes you feel that ? 
  it 's one of the most beautiful cities i 've been to , and it 's up in the mountainous regions so it also has very nice nature surrounding it . 
  it was n't very touristy at all when i was there , but to be fair that was almost 10 years ago so things may have changed . 
  when i was there you could still see half blown up buildings from the war , it 's a nice journey if you enjoy history that 's for sure . 
  i recomend the surrounding countries too . 
  why downvoted ? 
  he 's correct, 
  granted, 
  this is why it 's important that we do n't give up on nuclear energy . 
  it 's developing really fast , becoming more efficient and nuclear waste is decreasing in production . 
  we might even stop storing nuclear waste soon and use it for energy . 
  serbia seems neat , let 's do this . 
   the modern name `` jura '' dates from the norse-gael era and is from the old norse dyr\u00f8y meaning `` beast [ wild animal ] island '' . 
  animal is `` djur '' in swedish , i guess it 's probably prnounced like `` dyr\u00f8y '', 
  hydro power is a brilliant energy source but it has ecological effects . 
  do we really want to destroy all of our rivers ? 
  you 're right i should n't have said only , i was talking about the direct dangers right now . 
  but i think the risks with nuclear waste is often wildly overestimated . 
  in 100,000 of years it wont be dangerous and it 's very safely stored plus not in as big volume as people seem to imagine . 
  the absolute majority of the nuclear waste is low level waste that decays in 50 years .

  if we 're insignificant why does it matter ? 
  if you count deaths per kwh produced ( which is the only logical way to count safety ) , then nuclear power is the safest energy source there is . 
  why do n't you just have sex already at that point ? 
  `` worldy '' celebrities and politicians have started doing it here , it 's fucking nonsense . 
  it 's silly wording yes i agree . 
  we know it 's not going to change anything , sometimes you just have to do what 's ethical though without thinking about the results . 
  not sure what you 're trying to say . 
  [ i liked this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kzqjwrzecq ), 
  a draw for the us would be an upset . 
  they just dodged that . 
  i do n't even think it is a sport , it 's like wrestling , they 're just doing a big rehearsed play and everyone pretends they understand it because noone wants to admit they do n't . 
  this is not about feminism , this is just a crazy lady . 
  http://i.imgur.com/r4nrfh4.jpg translation :  ** `` woman reported happy woman for harassment '' **  ** norberg . 
  ** on thursday around 13:00 a woman was walking in the area of the norberg camping . 
  she met another woman who was out running . 
   the jogger looked happy , was laughing and said hello , the woman says in the police report , but as she did n't know the other one she felt harassed and reported the incident to the police . 
  worrying . 
  is sexual harassment defined the same everywhere though ? 
  it is n't surprising . 
  denmark was expected to win this despite not having a national team a week ago . 
  just a friendly yes , i have no fucks to give . 
  you 'll manage somehow . 
  no he did . 
  pretty sure he would be much funnier . 
  [ also ] ( http://www.iforidiot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/bean.28.620x413.jpg ), 
  louie spence ? 
  actually i 'd watch that . 
  it 's not like it comes as a surprise that jeremy clarkson has one of the most stupid fanbases . 
  `` but we got loads of signatures on our petition '' he punched his fucking producer . 
  [ this exists there ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmuo-8s_0wg ), 
  are you sure they will even make an article about sacking one of their employees ? 
  rowan atkinson would be 10 times better than clarkson . 
  i doubt that . 
  that thing looks a bit like the logo for my [ fictional online football club ] ( https://image.xperteleven.com/clubsign/yewdxxnwd3.gif ), 
  i mean we do n't like talking that much . 
  to be fair we 're not even able to hold a conversation in swedish . 
  fitting nick, 
  it actually does kill some bacteria but it kills both good and bad bacteria . 
  every fucking thread ? 
  that 's actually the case with swedish in finland , it 's an official language there . 
  how can you never have heard about light pollution ? 
  yeah it 's all bullshit .
