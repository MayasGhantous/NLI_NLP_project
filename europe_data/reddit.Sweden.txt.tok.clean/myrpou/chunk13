  beautiful, 
  maybe it 's like lappland . 
  there 's both a finnish and a swedish one ? 
  finland is zerg, 
  and for italy : likes to stab people 's butts . 
  oh , i thought people were over that by now . 
  i made that ( \uff9f\u30fc\uff9f ), 
  i there an actual definition ? 
  i would n't call spaniards or italians non-white . 
  more than what ? 
  eh , are n't middle easterners white ? 
  hm maybe you 're right . 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's argentina cause peru is biting its ear . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  well that would be consentual at least so i do n't see the problem . 
  i get that you 're joking but i think you 're misunderstanding swedish rape legislation if you think it 's ridiculous , it really is n't . 
  no that 's not rape . 
  rape is having sex with someone in their sleep , which he is accused of . 
  ah pat condell , the master of collecting myths and treating them as truth , even the for so long proven wrong suicide myth . 
  because of different definitions in what constitutes rape . 
  there is not much more to add . 
  oh stop it , japan, 
  who are the german speakers way to the east ? 
  it 's a great undiscovered cuisine , only just recently are people around the world starting to see its greatness . 
  i feel bad for narrow-minded people like you though who can judge a whole cuisine before even trying it , personally i like to try everything , i 'm a big fan of escargots . 
  you sound like an insular twat , i would bet you have never even tried nordic cuisine . 
  is that a lot or a little ? 
  yes . 
  i did n't mean they would buy only american arms , but they would buy some . 
  i doubt it . 
  point is though that the us happily sells arms to us , it 's one of the things that makes their military spending possible , it 's a circle of profit and if european start spending more on their defence budgets they will buy american arms and it will gain the us financially . 
  regarding gripen the us is very aggressive in their fighter plane sales , choosing our planes over theirs is something some governments are reluctant to do to remain a good relationship with the us . 
  they have even done smear campaigning against gripen . 
  nice colours !, 
  the king of sweden 's birthday is today . 
  [ this brand new poll ] ( http://www.svd.se/ny-svd-sifo-klar-majoritet-vill-behalla-monarkin ) says 65 % of swedes want to keep the monarchy . 
  i have a feelings these polls are ** very ** different to each other . 
  yes , it gains the us a lot . 
  our neighbours are buying your planes instead of ours in order to appease you . 
  why is it shitty ? 
  alright i 'm back on your boat . 
  charles xii ? 
  who lived in turkey for a load of years ? 
  fuck you we can stop whenever we want . 
  let 's not go too far here , there is n't a sight of general acceptance or tolerance for islamists in sweden . 
  good point . 
  canada is an associate member , not a full member . 
  do you get good oysters there ? 
  i love the window in your room . 
  luckily trump would never resort to that . 
  i do n't think that 's really what they want . 
  the european left wants to dismantle nato . 
  ok to me it looked like you did imply just that . 
  fair enough then . 
  hopefully they 'll respond by leaving . 
  i have never seen such a bunch of completely useless incompetent mongs in power before . 
  then you should realise your answer does n't make sense . 
  germany is not in scandinavia . 
  let 's not do it this time . 
  ah sorry , i should read before asking . 
  where is the mountain landscape picture taken ? 
  i would think it 's clouds or fog , possibly light pollution . 
  depends , you 're making it more simple than it is . 
  you end up making a few individuals responsible for the actions of an entire country . 
  that 's every trailer nowadays . 
  i just watch teaser trailers if i 'm interested in seeing the movie . 
  name was better in english than danish . 
  the silver bible and devil bible from prague were some of the finest finds . 
  like reddit . 
  reading them without ads is punishment enough . 
  lol i thought this was just a popular reddit myth that only circlejerking american redditors were pondering , not actual normal people . 
  ireland : jolly , ignorant , distracted , welcoming , dysfunctional, 
  austria are the relaxed ones . 
  i get where this is going . 
  hollande . 
  pilkington and ragnar\u00f6k, 
  i certainly did n't . 
  for sweden i think it 's more of a caf\u00e9 culture . 
  the phenomena of `` fika '' became an important part of socialising , you could meet up with your friends and sit in a caf\u00e9 and talk while having coffee with various pastry and naturally caf\u00e9s popped up everywhere with each trying to create the best experience with the tastiest coffee and pastry strenghtening the caf\u00e9 culture . 
  who would want to go to starbucks for overexpensive coffee when there 's loads of cosy caf\u00e9s all around ? 
  ( fucking teenagers that 's who ) . 
  imagine if scotland had gone with yes . 
  england , wales and ni leaving the eu would be set . 
  in sweden we have the gustavian epoque starting with king gustav iii 1772 to 1809 . 
  from this also came the gustavian style , examples : [ 1 ] ( http://blog.wilsonkelseydesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/gustavian-1.jpg ) [ 2 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/swedish_castle_skottorp.jpg ) [ 3 ] ( http://www.sfv.se/filtered/17680/rszww472h474-90/7c46ac553e26469084c7aa4dc1e35086-561378396-rszww472h474-90.jpg ) [ 4 ] ( http://gamla.hbl.fi/sites/default/files/styles/block_630x352/public/2014/09/hillestrom-i_kungliga.jpg?itok=bo8bhupb&amp;stmp=1412066087 ), 
  if it 's bland and tasteless you 've definitely done it wrong . 
  ikea meatballs should definitely not represent swedish meatballs . 
  nooo we use soft tacos . 
  souvlaki with fucking loads of tzatsiki . 
  thank you greece . 
  langos is very popular festival food in sweden . 
  was n't the big seller in israel for a long time `` clash of civilizations '' ? 
  that 's not how forestry works , you replace the forest all the time . 
  it 's a bit like a country with a big cattle industry , them killing more cows than other countries does n't mean they have less cows , it means they have more . 
  northern sweden, 
  a few kilometres ? 
  what 's even the point of taking the bus at that point ? 
  fire risk increases a lot allowing them to cook for themselves . 
  considering it 's a country with a massive forestry it 's high . 
  if we stopped that industry the forests would decrease fast .
