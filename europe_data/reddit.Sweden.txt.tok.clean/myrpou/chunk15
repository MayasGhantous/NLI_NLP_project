  sorry man . 
  hope he beats it . 
  map ? 
  their reputation is shaky as fuck at the moment , they need to appear to not be biased . 
  no there is outrage , but a part of the population will tolerate anything . 
  i 'm abolsutley appalled by this , this is a massive scandal and i fear this is just the tip of the iceberg . 
  this is a massive scandal , i 'm absolutley appalled by the police . 
  there must be big consequences . 
  e-cigarettes should be marketed , adviced for smokers and have decreased restrictions . 
  e-cigs will become the norm for nicotine use and it will save millions of lives , unless they 're stopped by governments or politicians . 
  blopians from blop ? 
  `` i 'm walking here '', 
  sweden only goes up 6 years . 
  i thought ordering six cheeseburgers was quite a fat-shameful act itself . 
  not sure what you think is not allowed in sweden . 
  do you think it would be banned in sweden or the uk ? 
  france is n't exactly exceptionally free speechy . 
  you do n't even know my position , why talk about it ? 
  i do n't live in sweden but i think that 's a stupid reason to leave it . 
  why are people so utterly obsessed with immigration like nothing else matters ? 
  i 'm not pretending to be shocked , just saddened by the stupidity . 
  it 's actually a good cuisine , sadly rather undiscovered by the world though . 
  what swedish dishes have you tried ? 
  oh god . 
  why ? 
  i would put swedish over british without a second of doubt . 
  i guess it 's what you 're brought up with . 
  ok what exactly does this mean ? 
  which countries are which ? 
  i feel like these titles should be changed for / r/europe as we 're a european audience , not british . 
  `` estonia is the best country in europe in which to find a new job , glassdoor survey finds '' fits better here than : `` the uk is the third best country in europe in which to find a new job , glassdoor survey finds '' . 
  but i can understand why people want to keep original title also . 
  at the europa baggage reclaim you find out your baggage is on it 's way to pluto . 
  yes i know snsb ( swedish national space board ) has 70 % of budget as esa contribution . 
  or were there like innuits or eskimos there ? 
  such a shame , they should team up with the feminists in their struggle to deprive women of their right to their lives . 
  but that 's not the case in any country . 
  i would bet a large part of them have already done conscription themselves and are too old now . 
  we clearly need some carolean films . 
  you read those counter jihad blogs do n't you ? 
  do n't they often use a german nordic cross flag or is that something else ? 
  what land would you give away ? 
  no , i do n't think we have any other words for h\u00f6st . 
  fucks wrong with you denmark ? 
  i was joking , i agree with you , switzerland should n't be left out when talking about europe . 
  maybe you should join the european union ( of humans ) then . 
  it 's legal to boil and eat swedes in almost all of europe :(, 
  yes . 
  thankfully very rarely enforced and most pubs do n't bother to get the licence . 
  sweden has a requirement for dancing permits for every pub , club , restaurant or public event , otherwise it 's an illegal activity . 
  i once got pulled over for not having headlights on , policeman then saw i was wearing sunglasses aswell . 
  do n't worry i almost never drive . 
  `` fuck that 's expensive , better scroll down ... toyota '', 
  people overuse headlights . 
  it 's better to let your vision adjust to the dark i think . 
  especially when you 're alone and there 's snow , the snow reflects so much light . 
  well it 's rounds so every drinks as much , if you do n't drink as much you do n't participate . 
  a friend of me got in trouble when going out in sweden with a portuguese guy and a swedish female friend . 
  they went to the pub and started ordering rounds and when it was his swedish friend 's turn he told her `` huh i guess it 's your round now '' and she went to order . 
  the portoguese guy got absolutley livid with him and told him women are not supposed to buy drinks for men . 
  i only have this example so i do n't know how close to reality it is but in sweden the thing where men pay for women when going out is almost dead . 
   schedules are approximates especially for buses , at least if sometimes the bus showing up 10:50 is approximatelly `` never '' . 
  i do n't think it 's an exclusively british thing , maybe compared to places like italy or greece but queuing certainly is a serious matter in northern europe aswell . 
  i disagree with the french secularism . 
  i think the best kind of secularism is the one that treats religion as something insignificant . 
  like you do n't discriminate religion either positively or negatively , it simply should n't be a concern for the state . 
  in universities ? 
  i 've not seen this . 
  there was also a plan to steal the goat with a helicopter and put it down on a square in stureplan , central stockholm .

  i like how the most common negative criticism of mona lisa is that it 's small . 
  that 's the guy who closed down bauhaus , what a dick !, 
  actually i have this theory that hitler never really gave up his art career but he moved on to using germany as his canvas and politics as his colours . 
  if you look at nazi germany it 's a lot about aesthetics from his perspective . 
  hitler tried to make reality out of the national romantic art , remove everything that goes against it . 
  how dare you suggest a non-european ? 
  claude monet for his work or picasso for his innovation . 
  for art from today i really like lars lerin , he 's brilliant at capturing [ the nordic melancholia . 
  that 's no moon . 
  probably done with undemocratic rule . 
  there was also another divide . 
  bird streets and berry streets . 
  i 'm born in the late 80 's . 
  i did n't play street hockey , but some vattenkrig and sn\u00f6bollskrig on the street . 
  in my time it was mostly old people who called the area lillsj\u00f6n and the rivalry was with torvalla , v\u00e4stra odensala and tavelb\u00e4cken . 
  if i remember correctly . 
  i 'd call the area odensala or \u00d6stra odensala . 
  lol well i do n't live there but my parents live in the area . 
  i took it . 
  it 's odensala . 
  or if we hang them from trees instead of having them stand on the ground . 
  we had a little bit of snow in the middle of sweden : http://imgur.com/a/6f7yl, 
  but p\u00e5 sp\u00e5ret is nice . 
  very positive . 
  nuclear energy is the safest , cleanest and most efficient source of energy we have today and we should research it to make it even more efficient and reduce nuclear waste .
