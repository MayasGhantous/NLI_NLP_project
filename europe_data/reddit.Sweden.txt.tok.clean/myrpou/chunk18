  guy 's a clown . 
  he says he 's going to build a wall to mexico and make mexico pay for it . 
  he 's been trying to buy a small piece of land from a farmer next to his golf course in scotland for fucking seven years and still have n't managed . 
  this subreddit has turned to so much shit . 
  no i 'd hope the vatican would be given to the public ( italy ? ), 
  and taken care of . 
  sounds nothing like what you just said . 
  good . 
  so should we treat muslims like muslim countries in general treat `` infidels '' ? 
  that 's a negative outlook . 
  is n't population growth decreasing in most of africa and most countries improving every year as a whole and poverty rate decreasing aswell ? 
  nordic media is absolutley awful though , especially swedish . 
  their accusements or racism should n't be taken seriously , they need to start actually debating instead of throwing the word racist at anyone who disagrees or the people will soon be tired of their bullshit ( already starting ) . 
  why ? 
  the priest opposes to removal of christian symbols , the bishop is the one who suggested that . 
  what 's so bad about any of this ? 
  if anything churches and all other religious institutions need to get more liberal . 
  she suggests making it an open praying place ( like those in airports ) . , to invite people of other religions . 
  this seems pretty logical to me , not at all controversial . 
  muslims need the direction to mecca in order to pray , so it 's just helpful to have it pointed out . 
  ** country : ** sweden ** favourite neighbour : ** denmark ** least favourite neighbour : ** finland, 
  [ she said she was hanseatic ] ( http://www.sydsverige.dk/media/artikler/jakriborg-by-5.jpg ), 
  i ca n't imagine living with my parents now . 
  i moved out when i was 18 and if i stay with them for more than 2 weeks on a holiday it gets too much , i feel the need to get out of there . 
  my parents feel the same , they say `` it 's nice when you visit but even nicer when you leave '' . 
  what a beautiful country . 
  not a right winger ( not a left winger either ) . 
  which papers are you comparing to swedish ones ? 
  swedish tabloids use scare mongering not only as a political tool but throughout every subject they cover as entertainment to make anything newsworthy , they 're basically the fox news of newspapers if it had a child with buzzfeed . 
  i feel like this thread is too stuck on politics when rating newspaper shittyness . 
  granted svd and in some regard dn are better at this . 
  uk tabloids are at least balanced from an overview perspective . 
  you have the sun and daily mail balanced up by papers like the guardian and the independent . 
  plus no matter how biased the daily mail are they 're at least blatanly biased and pushing an agenda , swedish tabloids are sneaky and overall onesided , besides politics their papers basically consist of gossip and scare mongering shitty pop science . 
  swedish newspapers somehow manages to be even worse than british ones . 
  they 're all pushing agendas , they 're all decieving the people , they publish sensationalism and scaremongering to distort people 's views on aspects of society to whatever direction they want . 
  they 're fucking scum . 
  wear a backpack with a scottish flag on . 
  do the engish really think they 're hated in europe ? 
  i had no idea about this . 
  i was 6 when it happened and scared of big boats for many years after . 
  they 're all pathetic . 
  not respecting yitzhak shamir was more understandable . 
  a body is a body, 
  probably both, 
  shit plan so far, 
  and i thought * i * was a cynical bastard . 
  i wish na was any north american hockey player not from canada and usa . 
  europe is already ahead of the us in ice hockey , europe has several countries just as good or better than the us . 
  if team europe is made up of the shitty hockey countries of europe , does that mean team north america is made up of the rest of the shitty north american countries ? 
  so it 's like mexico and jamaica or something playing hockey ? 
  in sweden and several more countries hockey will always be ice hockey . 
  it 's a very complicated issue , let 's not pretend that it is n't . 
  definately . 
  as northern sweden is so empty i can think of a number of battles missing just from the top of my head . 
  can you even imagine the massive database needed to create this accurately ? 
  if someone has a source to this it would be nice . 
  i 'm not sure how i feel about this , i support euthansia for adults but i 'm not sure about minors . 
  at the same time it 's quite sad thinking about children suffering immensely while their parents have no way of stopping it . 
  it 's so tragic when you think about how teenagers long for turning 18 in order to get to drive cars and go to pubs and be adults while some might just long for that day so they can end it all . 
  who judges the judges ? 
  could we order the golden confetti aswell ? 
  it 's fucking hipsters that want them . 
  is it worth the smell ? 
  kind of isolated no ? 
  the faroe islands ? 
  are you sure ? 
  as does iceland, 
  germany , poland or back to sweden, 
  thin crust is standard in sweden . 
  artichokes work perfect on pizza . 
  desperate times call for desperate measures . 
  sincerely myrpou, 
  sounds bad but i think it could be good , i 'd have to try it first . 
  maybe a bowl of licorice yoghurt with a load of raspberries and granola and maybe some rhubarb or kiwi with that . 
  the world is slowly starting to learn . 
  licorice is a new favourite among chefs it seems . 
  do n't ban anything , stop banning things , it does n't solve our root problems . 
  we did n't achieve the great freedom that we enjoy today by banning things out of fear . 
  eh i do n't live in sweden but what you described fits mostly how they 've done in sweden aswell . 
  i think at most they will get some media attention then forgotten . 
  so do we keep or send off timbuktu ? 
  they 're feminists , just the extreme sexist type that does n't believe in equality at all . 
  do n't we use marinades and sauces aswell ? 
  from what experience ? 
   regardless , would n't you state that it 's germany [ modern and democratic ] has some sort of responsibility to defend israel ? 
  no this is absolutley ridiculous . 
  maybe internet has severely warped your perception of other countries ? 
  no he is mixed race . 
  no it is not illegal in sweden and it is technically private property not government property . 
  so what is australia ? 
  you 've got it right france . 
  sometimes war is necessary . 
  decades from now people might ask why we did n't do anything about north korea when we knew a whole country was suffering for such a long time . 
  maybe they did n't , chances are leave voters were just more passionate about the vote . 
  reminds me of the ugly duckling story . 
  i 'm not talking about the general shit here , just the current election in the us . 
  israel is not even in europe at all . 
  because they 're in uefa . 
  uefa loves collective punishment though .
