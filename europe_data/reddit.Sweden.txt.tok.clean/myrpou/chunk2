  4chan circlejerk has reached reddit , people are easily influenced . 
  i you think moderate muslims are going to get angry about criticism of the islamic state then you 're pretty islamophobic yourself . 
  all this fear of touching anything negative about islam with a ten foot pole is not going keep islamophobia down , on the contrary it 's almost certainly counter productive . 
  they are doing nothing but giving fuel to the ideas of certain movements that have an interest painting the picture of western world countries as bowing down to islam and giving special treatment to muslims , which of course scares people inte believing that eurabia is a upon us and thus resulting in growing islamophobia . 
  let 's just forget what religion anything is and treat everything and everyone the same so we can get rid of this us vs them mentality . 
  when i see titles like this one i 'm always extremely careful . 
  i remember when `` der untergang '' was called `` hitler glorifying '' by media . 
  there is a thin line between a historically accurate depiction of nazis and nazi glorification it seems . 
  that 's not nordic at all . 
  norway , germany , denmark mostly i think . 
  not chemicals !, 
  which means you ca n't visit them . 
  not by a church . 
  well northern parts of scandinavia were christened very late too , j\u00e4mtland some time around 1050 . 
  yes true but sony ericsson went from being one of the most popular brands in the swedish mobile market to a minor one in a really short time , at least that 's how i remember it . 
  was n't it an even bigger scandal that she apparently has used untaxed illegal diesel for the boat ? 
  it should be added that she is n't just the minister of environment but also a party leader for the green party . 
  pat condell talking out of his arse again , he seriously needs to learn to do better research before uttering himself on these things and a little source criticism would n't harm . 
  because of fashion today , these days you ca n't tell wether the shirts are inside out or not . 
  pretty much killed the mobile phone industry in sweden too . 
  this should work . 
  that second one is pretty special , made by eero j\u00e4rnefelt depicting a burning of a field for future agriculture . 
  because ships are going to find a new route to asia , through the north pole . 
  would a lightsaber stick into the ground like that ? 
  anyone know star wars physics ? 
  there 's something rotten in your username . 
  pirates !, 
  i assume that fence is for sheep , i hope it 's for sheep , i like sheep . 
  goats are also alright . 
  when the north pole melts narvik or nordkap could be a new big port for europe . 
  oh lol , i did n't know . 
  yes dreamhack is the largest from what i 've heard . 
  i live in j\u00f6nk\u00f6ping and the bible belt of sweden . 
  this town is run by moral panicy conservatives . 
  strip clubs are not illegal here , but the local authority does n't like strip clubs so decided to use our money to buy up a strip club in the outskirts of the city with our money to get rid of that filth . 
  thing is the strip club owners knew they were desperate so they could demand a rather big sum of money for that place , so much money that they could afford an even nicer place in the city centre right next to a primary school to open a new strip club . 
  then there was a caf\u00e9 that had opened for muslim women who were victims of honour crimes and abuse from their husbands . 
  it did n't took long until it turned out that the people who ran this caf\u00e9 had an agenda to convert these people to christianity . 
  otherwise it 's a [ nice town .

  i was expecting a picture [ like that ] ( http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/73319000/jpg/_73319925_73319920.jpg ), 
  some isles *, 
  i do n't think they 're ugly but i do n't think banknotes should be minimalist , they should have a maximalist look , representing what they are . 
  cool, 
  beatrice ask, 
  i thought everything was legal on isle of man . 
  i think they 're over that . 
  the swedish newscaster is from a comedy show , he says this : `` the christmas present of the year 2008 is an experience , hui research has not yet specified what the experience is , but considering the economical situation it leads towards the experience is poverty '' `` maud olofsson ( minister of enterprise ) says that she is going to invest in the school for the upcoming election in 2010 , until then she hopes to have a complete high school grade .

  my favourite city in norway is trondheim , i like to go there when i get the chance . 
  what sort of social engineering ? 
  being half black only counts as full in the us though , your stupid one drop rule . 
  i dunno , too short ? 
  that reminds me of how [ settlers often vandalise street signs in the west bank to remove the arabic .

  your french sounds more like a 1 or 2 if 10 is fluent but alright . 
  exactly ? 
  i 'm assuming they mean fluently . 
  but it 's autumn, 
  so what 's the situation with this now ? 
  is the guy okay ? 
  is his family infected ? 
  is someone new infected ? 
  that 's not what i mean by rich caf\u00e9 culture . 
  i 'd forget about what they think and think more about what people will think of what we actually did now in the future . 
  i know , i 'm just asking if you think it 's right in retrospect . 
  so they 're implying ukraine = nazi ? 
  it 's not our responsibility , but say it was the 30s or 40s europe and persecuted people were fleeing european countries before their countries were invaded by germany , would you just say let them die it 's not our responsibility ? 
  scandinavia has a really rich caf\u00e9 culture actually . 
  great . 
  cause she fucked some guy . 
  [ a union of peace , love and bass ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zhprfer0p4 ), 
  says a guy on the internet . 
  depends what you count as the start , it 's from a really old comic from / pol / originally and now people on reddit are making a thing out of it . 
   sweden , yes !, 
  people on / r/europe are really sucking into this trend are n't they ? 
  tragic . 
  i have heard this number as the expected amount of asylum seekers , not the expected amount of refugees granted asylum . 
  i think the link is incorrect . 
  all governments are retarded , in their own way . 
  you 're absolutley clueless . 
  which ethnicities will take over ? 
  and how ? 
   sure it might taste good but with every bite gustavus adolphus spins in his grave . 
  i seriously doubt that , i bet that he would have the same attitude as charles xii when he brought in cabbage rolls to sweden from turkey . 
  i think this song could be the most popular right now : [ thomas stenstr\u00f6m `` sl\u00e5 mig h\u00e5rt i ansiktet '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbb-husetps ) ( punch me hard in the face ), 
  this one is old though . 
  i agree , i forgive you though . 
  lol we come anyway, 
  [ dancing ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cblwmudee64 ) [ tank drifting ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5awaw2hea4 ), 
  no they would both get greedy and start fighting each other . 
  not jealous of you up here with our hydro and nuclear power . 
  fuck i wanted to complain that sweden is n't represented . 
  this label is shitty though , who reads anything but `` energ '' ? 
  do n't you think this new rise in anti-semitism is due to immigration from the middle east ? 
  we 've seen a rise in anti-semitism in sweden too , but only in areas with high immigration . 
  i think it 's mostly an imported problem . 
  this is happening in more places in the world , honestly i do n't know it 's hard to determine exactly what the right thing to do is when you 've only watched it on the news . 
  so nato bombs the fuck out of is for a bit , then what ? 
  this feels so weird .
