  i should go to benelux . 
  the icebreakers are ale , atle , frej , oden and ymer . 
  thank you !, 
  wish this map was 14 years later . 
  you could download the imgur app . 
  what great news , happy christmas everyone !, 
  i cant remember the last time we had a designated driver . 
  you just solve transport in another way so everyone gets to have fun . 
  this is like a political satire comic . 
  i 've heard people say things along those lines many times on reddit . 
  might come off as a bit shallow but it could be used as showing respect . 
  does lighting a candle count as caring ? 
  does flying a flag half mast count ? 
  it 's kind of hard to tell . 
  internet is way too cynical sometimes though , always on a hunt to write people off as attention whores and the like . 
  better than getting a `` slight condemnation '' . 
  made a [ small improvement ] ( http://imgur.com/zhuk89g.png ), 
  shitty almost 10 year old nikon d60 , but with a great sigma 50mm lens . 
  i live there , makes it easier for logistical reasons . 
  that 's nicely framed by the trees , good shot . 
  oh shit op had hungarian . 
  do you think schools in europe should be allowed to celebrate ramadan ? 
  hungarian ? 
  english | swedish : -- | : -- athens | aten belgrade | belgrad brussels | bryssel bucharest | bukarest copenhagen | k\u00f6penhamn helsinki | helsingfors lisbon | lissabon luxembourg | luxemburg moscow | moskva prague | prag rome | rom vienna | wien warsaw | warszawa yerevan | jerevan the rest are the same as in english . 
  i mean they are [ mountains ] ( http://www.fiskflyg.se/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rapadalen-21.jpg ) , not the alps but still . 
  the rest is n't flat as fuck either , many hilly areas there . 
  edit : ugh sorry about this , i 'm fun at parties . 
  second one looks amazing . 
  [ well i had to play with it ] ( http://imgur.com/zohmfed.png ), 
  had a lot of time this year . 
  you 're right about the light , looks almost like a painting . 
  i do n't like pediga much but it 's a shame we need police to protect their freedom of expression from antifa scum . 
  if it was n't for the police the `` antifascists '' would have created a fascist society . 
  it 's taken from the top of the police at-at . 
  why though ? 
  old camera most likely . 
  good point , same in sweden . 
  what sorts of problems ? 
  i think it 's possible . 
  media gives so much attention to muslims that their presence seems much higher than it actuaally is , that combined wit people living in high immigrant rate areas could lead to such a distorted view . 
  why are we doggies ? 
  is it ? 
  [ this ] ( http://www.svenskdam.se/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/kungen-11.jpg ), 
  a friend in edinburgh said the most scottish thing he 's ever seen is a guy who went up to a door and had a piss on it to then take out his keys and lock it up . 
  you should hope that , imagine several german divisions getting stuck at n\u00e4ssj\u00f6 train station for a month because the train gears have frozen stuck . 
  funny thing here is you 're worried about germany . 
  has r/denmark picked a side yet ? 
  we will be on the other one . 
  `` we 'll deport you to turkey '' plane lands in somalia . 
  no it 's more ethnicity . 
  he 's american , this has gone to his head already . 
  it 's sad , almost everyone i know here lives with housemates in old shoddy built houses . 
  i love dublin but everything about the housing is absolute shit . 
  it 's not about jesus . 
   integration does not mean that we should accept their customs in our own countries , it means that they should accept those of the host country . 
  so be christian or forget christmas bonus ? 
  that reminds me of jitza like they have in muslim countries where all non-muslims have to pay a special tax . 
  some of you christians are an awful lot like the muslims . 
  christmas is n't even christian , they just adopted it . 
  i do n't care about religion , i just demand the same amount of days off and the same bonus opportunities as everyone else on my position in the company . 
  in my world that 's a 100 % unquestionable request . 
  16 works since one is crossed over . 
  yeah bit of a silly translation . 
  so why are you talking about a map of independent states then ? 
  are you calling scotland an independent state ? 
  well the clear difference is that no other people than the ones from the uk expect their country to be represented in a `` map of countries '' like this one . 
  where is j\u00e4mtland , sapm\u00ed , glass country , scania , laponia etc ? 
  to take a few from just sweden . 
  it 's a bit weird to call scotland ( or england , wales , ni ) a country though since that would be absolutly unique for the uk in the world . 
  there does n't seem to be any reason to call scotland a country other than that they say they are one . 
  / r/sweden is the biggest non-english subreddit on reddit . 
  it 's because of the question `` could you hold a conversation in english ? 
  '' , the results would be the same if the question was `` could you hold a conversation at all ? '', 
  well of course it 's not good then . 
  you obviously ca n't rate a cuisine by the food they eat in the national service . 
  why did you eat it every thursday for a year then ? 
  ok that 's not my experience . 
  that 's not a realistic concern . 
  what ? 
  i would absolutley love some pea soup with pancakes now . 
  i do n't think our traditional food is bland . 
  but the investment in those options have to be massive to break the dependence on russian energy . 
  nuclear will do that most efficiently and is probably still the greenest option . 
  aw so no scandinavia then ? 
  nuclear power is without doubt the easiest and most rational way to go . 
  i get this picture , but i find especially nordic food in general to be severly underrated . 
  most foreigners have n't even tried it though . 
  living in ireland i miss swedish food so much . 
  have you tried food north of them ? 
  man this subreddit ** really ** hates us . 
  he also killed an innocent pupper, 
  i 'm waiting for trump to utter the words `` fortress america '' . 
  also he could make puppet mexico pay for it easily . 
  why are they so far up ? 
  denmark is the other way . 
  yeah but they moved it to the [ top of the nk building ] ( http://resources.mynewsdesk.com/image/upload/dpr_1.0,f_auto,q_80,w_690/paylyhlsapr0g46568if.jpg ), 
  sweden is most nordic and finland almost more nordic than denmark ? 
  maybe danes truly are frisians . 
  oh god do n't visit the toilets . 
  if you have time it 's just a 5 min walk to connelly train station which has public toilets that by european standards are fucking fantastic and free .
