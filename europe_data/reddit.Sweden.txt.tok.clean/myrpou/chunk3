  i know it was a joke . 
  this is a great illustration of how much we hate our family in scandinavia . 
  should n't british women come here for the sexy single alpha men though ? 
  i do n't get this . 
  eh , we do not think that .

  we 're counting gdp per capita . 
  because pizza is more of a universal thing , they 're widespread all over the world and has been influenced by local cuisines and thus turned into local variants . 
  the same can not be said about kebab in the same way , kebab does n't have the same history . 
  [ it 's beautiful ] ( http://24.media.tumblr.com/d8fbdaef8238f035cd901a8fef05f1c4/tumblr_mia0bcwvrx1rlo1q2o1_1280.jpg ), 
  israel does in no way speak for judaism , they are irrelevant . 
  why would you complain about a sarcastic comment after just making one ? 
  why ca n't you imagine that ? 
  also you disliking something does n't magically mean it 's bad . 
  i love snails . 
  i 'm not a massive fan of bacon but pancetta is the best . 
  it 's great that all 300 million americans have easy access to brooklyn and knows which place sells proper kebab . 
  why are you sure about that ? 
  do n't be insular . 
  there 's really no lack of italian restaurants here that 's for sure . 
  `` get down on the floor ! '', 
  apart from the buzz they make , yes . 
  oh i see what you mean , i 'm a bit thick . 
  my city makes them . 
  when i was delivering post on nights one summer in a rich area almost every single garden had one . 
  it was cool how they all would start at pretty much the same time , and since it was really early in the morning there were no life visible , so they were good company . 
  czech republic has all kinds of beer , pilsner is the most popular though yes , but that 's not very surprising since it was invented there . 
  he did n't say it was sarcastic . 
  `` is '' means `` ice cream '' in norwegian , i 'm sure this is just the new ice cream truck tune . 
  take the [ alcohol belts ] ( http://www.healthytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/alcoholbelt.jpg ) in consideration , and also i 'm not sure this map shows unrecorded beer consumption . 
  russia would be far ahead of everyone else if this was total alcohol consumption . 
  czech beer is some of the best in the world . 
  with very high certainity . 
  i do n't think a whole country has ever had muhammed as the most popular , only certain cities . 
  i think they would be names like cornelius or agata . 
  kelly c, 
  comedy value, 
  well it 's missing montenegro and kosovo at least . 
  boris johnson pm ? 
  that would be fantastic . 
  i guess we already know , it 's going to be stefan l\u00f6fven . 
  19/50 countries . 
  are n't we going to call them is now ? 
  but it 's not a mandatory tax so you can hardly even call it a tax , you just need to pay if you want to be a part in keeping up the church and its activities . 
  i think i read 8 episodes . 
  seems reasonable no ? 
  what if cameron conveniently retires before the end of the year ? 
   to bring down white civilisation ( looking at you sweden , you 're the first to go down in the looming race war ) . 
  when is it starting ? 
  of course it 's hard to assimilate if you ca n't get a job , but if more immigrants would make a bigger effort in assimilating then maybe they would be more attractive on the job market . 
  [ iceland ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yspcyovnjew ), 
  we do n't do it for them but for their families . 
  come back in a coffin or do n't come back at all . 
  my friend , he has styled it and named it . 
  it 's embarrassing . 
  i like calabrian , n'duja is wonderful . 
  it 's hard to pick one . 
  italian , french , greek , spanish are all fantastic , but i also like german cuisine and scandinavian cuisine is really underrated in my opinion , we have many flavours that hardly exist in any other european cuisines , like [ moose ] ( https://www.coop.se/episervercommunity/modules/imagegallery/thumbnails/46/246/21204_76167.jpg ) , [ reindeer ] ( http://karlstein.nu/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/renskav-001.jpg ) , different kinds of [ wild berries ] ( http://www.svensksmak.se/images/recept_1238_1267215220.jpg ) and a much more extensive use of various kinds of [ fish ] ( http://pernillaelmquist.se/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/inlagd-sill-2.jpg ) , [ mushrooms ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7rylybmyaok/tiarofdpi0i/aaaaaaaaad8/mp4vgn6i7j4/s1600/kantareller.jpg ) , [ dill ] ( http://receptbloggen.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/ugnsbakad-laxfile-1020558.jpg ) and other stuff than other european cuisines . 
  i think we all have something great to offer to food . 
  what 's the difference from the potentional independence declaration by scotland and say canada then ? 
  scotland is not planning to leave the commonwealth are they ? 
  at least two users besides coffeh have claimed to have voted for him . 
  you ca n't form an alliance outside of the parliament , it 's wasted . 
  bullet dodged , they wont get in, 
  well that 's not what this specific referendrum is about . 
  you could also ask why canada , australia and new zealand did n't become republics . 
  we 've got socks man . 
  that 's so different in all of europe , in sweden we have a joke about how zidane headbutted materazzi for calling his sister a whore . 
  in sweden the reaction to that would be `` you know my sister ? 
  yes, 
  i just learned this . 
  we can call it whatever we want , the galactic european empire sounds good to me . 
  we like you guys but we do n't want to move in with you . 
  we 'd have to taught you manners like taking off your shoes when inside . 
  i guess what i mean is i 'm surprised the ` bigger is better ' idea is so strong here , just in your country you have two regions wanting independence . 
  i 'm walking here !, 
  the confederate states of europe . 
  despite knowing this subreddit is very pro-eu , i 'm quite surprised so many here want to give up their sovereignity . 
  unless they were right from the start . 
  there is a huge difference between saying that islamism is a threat and saying that islam or the muslims is a threat . 
  on that point i think his after ukip comment was more sensible . 
  i believe they declared war later because they were on holiday . 
  it was just a joke , not meant to be as hostile as it came out . 
  even if it 's the sun it 's hardly biased towards the yes side , they 're more likely to side with bitter together . 
  they should go with a stuart instead . 
  it was a mandatory move . 
  basically any of carl michael bellman 's classic songs . 
  to be fair slovakia would have looked weird owning that bit , poland just made the map more aesthetically pleasing . 
  nemiroff it is , let 's get drunk for ukraine now / r/europe !, 
  look , an armchair warrior !, 
   monaco - audi you disappoint me . 
  i like to use [ this map ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/grossgliederung_europas-en.svg/683px-grossgliederung_europas-en.svg.png ) as a guide . 
  but i think many would argue that the baltic countries and croatia are not parts of central europe . 
  [ hyperbole ] ( http://www.globalfirepower.com/countries-listing.asp ) as usual . 
  march towards poltava ? 
  benelux , france , italy , spain or germany would n't have any trouble . 
  shit i think i need to invest in eastern poland . 
  everyone panic, 
  what happened in your country this week ? 
  he 's a troll , do n't bother .
