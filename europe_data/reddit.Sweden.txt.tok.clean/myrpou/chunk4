  because of the public . 
   the finns and the swedes do n't spend 2 % of their gdp on their militaries and they 're not going to start just to be allowed into nato . 
  what makes you think that ? 
  they very well might , there 's a lot of talk about this . 
  as if this is anything new , both sweden and finland has been very close to nato for a long time , it 's not that finland and sweden are leaching off nato , there 's a mutual interest here . 
  oh lol , i meant the state of course . 
  you misunderstood me , i 'm not saying it is n't art . 
  just that it 's irrelevant to bring up to the debate about what is art just because it 's a black square . 
  then we agree . 
  hate speech laws . 
  i disagree with him but that is not any sort of proof . 
  is that black square art just because it has been displayed at art galleries and been considered as art by a large amount of people , artists and intellectuals ? 
  is that what defines art ? 
  well yes , that 's according to law , unfortunately law can never perfectly seperate art from non-art . 
  the only reason why you would need to seperate them is if you have laws infringing upon freedom of expression . 
  you two disagree what art is because both of you have different definitions of what art is , and that 's basically the answer to what art is . 
  art is subjective . 
  do n't waste your time trying to debate the definition of art with someone else because ultimately it 's meaningless . 
  art is not some sort of moral vacuum that means you can do things that you ca n't do otherwise , although some works of art may have different intentions and a deeper meaning than the direct message that it sends out . 
  not at all , i 'm just saying the law is counter productive for it 's purpose . 
  even if it was n't counter productive i would still be against the law . 
  i disagree with the law . 
  how do you determine if an artwork depicting racism is racist ? 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkwj3eflxbc is the end of this sketch racist ? 
  is it joking about black people being violent or is it joking about the idea that racist 's have that black people are violent ? 
  granted in this case it 's pretty clear , but in others it 's not . 
  i think things are getting reported more often but the laws themselves have never allowed these kinds of expressions . 
  or look at central europe where many nazi and fascist symbols have been forbidden for a long time and even just the thought of not accepting the number of casualties in the holocaust can send you in jail . 
  how many would have known about his art had the government not gone after him ? 
  now it 's known and seen worldwide , good job . 
  depends on the artist , in this case i think he 's provoking in order to challenge the width of our freedom of expression . 
  hate speech is bad , but it 's still free speech . 
  depicting racism is n't necesarilly racism , i might be completely misinterpreting dan park 's art now , he could be a full blown racist but the thing is that 's irrelevant . 
  you must be able to depict racism in art or we have a situation where anything treating racism in art can be seen as racist in itself , even if the intention is the exact opposite . 
  no it has been infringed upon for a long time , it 's just becoming clearer to us today . 
  it 's provocative art , only nowadays the only `` provocative art '' we see is feminists painting with menstruation blood , which does n't really upset anyone but conservative old people , most just finds it a bit repulsive but certainly not worthy of the overused label provocative art . 
  lars vilks and other artists who cause massive provocation , death threats or risk legal prosecutions without actually doing anything criminal except expressing themselves with art are the true practicers of provocative art . 
  so i would definitely add dan park to the list of good provocative artists . 
  not worth any sort of punishment . 
  is n't this old reddit oc ? 
  seems like we need northern africa and jordan in eurovision . 
  one of us !, 
  cool, 
  salmond pretty much dominated , it seems darling had only prepared for the currency debate . 
  i doubt it will shift votes though . 
  consistency is key . 
  nickname explains everything . 
  it 's much easier to run a majority goverment though . 
  yes me too , i think many people would be pissed if s chose to collaborate with others . 
  but if s+mp+v does n't reach a majority on their own , chances are s will look to the right . 
  yeah it wont happen , possibly s , mp , c and fp . 
  not a country but [ j\u00e4mtland ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noxpebbyxmm ) has a good one . 
  i hope the social democrats chooses to form government with the people 's party and the centre party , i 'm sick of todays left party and green party . 
  possibly , but in what ways ? 
  we do n't actually have any places for them left , the government has bought up [ big old mansions ] ( http://norrteljetidning.se/nyheter/nyheter/1.2260799-skebo-herrgard-tillfallig-bostad-for-flyktingar ) , hired [ whole hotels ] ( http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=125&amp;artikel=5908596 ) and there 's even been talk about letting them live on [ boats and oil platforms ] ( http://www.svt.se/nyheter/regionalt/ostnytt/svart-ordna-bostader-at-flyktingar ) to make room for them at this point i think helping refugees where they are is the best , most efficient and responsible solution and focus on taking care of the refugees we already have . 
  as for the rest of europe i think some countries could do more , but that 's up to them . 
  i do n't know , you hear so many different stories now , some say nothing was thrown , some say ammonia bombs and stones were thrown at the police before the charge and some say it was n't ammonia bombs but surstr\u00f6mming bombs . 
  they used to be called `` national socialistic front '', 
  antifas . 
  do n't throw stuff at the horsies and do n't get trampled . 
  your choice fucking imbeciles . 
  a fried unicorn ? 
  red foxes exist in every european country except iceland . 
  well if you report something that is n't considered rape in denmark but is considered rape in sweden obviously the rape rate is going to be higher in sweden even if they would actually be the same . 
  i 'm against jihad as perpetrated by islamist terrorist organisations , but that 's irrelevant here . 
  the anti-jihad or counterjihad movement is an ideology that stretches beyond that , instead of just focusing on islamists , their idea is that islam as a whole is evil and they often support completely banning muslims from moving to western countries or the building of mosques in western countries , effectively denying them their freedom of religion . 
  even between sweden and denmark there are vast differences over the definition of rape , with the much broader definition we obviously get a higher rape rate than other countries , ingrid carlqvist either does n't understand this or she intentionally leaves it out . 
  ingrid carlqvist is a part of the anti-jihad movement , be careful with taking what she says as fact . 
  ** swedish : ** harvest moon - sk\u00f6rdem\u00e5ne ( literal translation ) rainbow - regnb\u00e5ge ( literal translation ) fairy rings - h\u00e4xring ( witch ring ) , \u00c4lvring ( elven ring ) or \u00c4lvdans ( elven dance ) spitting ( fine rain ) - duggregn ( regn means rain and dugg means `` very little '' or `` next to nothing '' ) cats and dogs ( a lot of rain ) - sp\u00f6regn ( regn means rain and sp\u00f6 means `` giving someone a beating '' ), 
  yes , also a popular term among photographers to describe [ these kind of photos ] ( https://www.google.se/search?q=bl%c3%a5+timmen&amp;rlz=1c1svee_ense461se461&amp;espv=2&amp;es_sm=93&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=xdtwu5vghenhywpwo4dabw&amp;ved=0cagq_auoaq&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=955 ), 
  that site seems to be using different sources for each country , are you sure it 's trustworthy ? 
  look at this : http://www.svenskaolframjandet.se/bryggerier, 
  why ? 
  regarding beer ? 
  where do you get that from ? 
  london is two cities ? 
  here are [ some more ] ( http://www.visitaarhus.com/sites/default/files/styles/galleries_ratio/public/asp/visitaarhus/attraktioner/museer/aros-your-rainbow-1024x576.jpg?itok=5gpe-f0a ) [ pictures of it .

  polish people in the us are diluted , the polish people in london have lived in poland and are culturally polish . 
  i think israel being in uefa has made them come closer to europe culturally . 
  australia has only been in afc for what ? 
  a couple of years ? 
  that lasted for just a few years . 
  yeah when they visit / r/sweden they 're either there to ask us how to move to sweden because they 've read on reddit that it 's great here . 
  or they visit to post pat condell videos of him telling us how the downfall of sweden as a country is imminent . 
  great fun . 
  they gave you a statue , you gave them a disneyland then there was some warring in the middle of that i think . 
  there 's no big relationship between france and the usa today though , i remember talking with an american about france , he was talking about how france were cowards and going on about how they always needed saving , turns out he was from lafayette , lousiana . 
  the mate-inmate joke was the worst one . 
  no sorry the worst one was ameristralia . 
  ** indian summer : ** ( we have three words for this in sweden ) brittsommar - a reference to saint birgitta . 
  fattigmanssommar - poor man 's summer gr\u00e4vlingssommar - badger summer ** milky way : ** vintergatan - the winter street ** the sunshower : ** vitterv\u00e4der - vittra weather ( vittra are a little people that lives under the ground in northern sweden in folklore ), 
  the french one is more impressive though . 
  and uefa . 
  yerevan looks magical , with the mighty mountains in the background and a massive peaceful old city . 
  that smoke going up in the distance , so nice . 
  same thing happened to me , pretty annoying , and you ca n't add pictures to albums if you do n't have an account logged in . 
  the people who blame the russian people for the actions of the government are idiots . 
  i 've actually seen something like this a few times in / r/soccer but different . 
  every time a russian club has a racist incident you get a load of posts saying `` fuck russians , racist bastards '' and shit like that , but when a racist incidence happens by fans of say english clubs , all the comments are `` we know these people are not representative for the whole club '' , while when it 's russia they can generalise a whole country of 150 million people for the actions of a dozen .
