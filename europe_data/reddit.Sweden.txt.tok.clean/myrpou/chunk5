  i 've seen it a few times and i have defended russia . 
  what i meant by the votes do n't matter is that they do n't matter for the truth , you can upvote a lie a thousend times , it does n't become anymore true . 
  i agree that the commonly held views on reddit may have an effect on the image of russia in the western world . 
  why would i be apologetic ? 
  i 'm not responsible for the weapons trade , if you 're interested i am definately against trading weapons with dictatorships and countries in war . 
  i actually agree that russia gets a massive amount of undeserved criticism and even hate on reddit , just remember that how reddit votes does n't determine what is true , that 's completely irrelevant . 
  this le s [ weed ] en bullshit is getting old though , yes a part of reddit has an insular and irrational view of sweden as some sort of utopia , but they 're idiots . 
  it 's all a bit old now though , today it has shifted a bit , nowadays in every thread about sweden on reddit some users have to spew hatred towards us just to counter the supposed circlejerk , i just wish people would stop treating countries differently for the same actions all together , but it 's never going to happen , it goes in waves though , i think the anti-sweden circlejerk is bigger than the sweden circlejerk today . 
  oh man sorry , got a bit too defensive there . 
  you said `` you sicken me '' as if todays swedes are responsible . 
  and really is not getting involved really so absolutley despicable ? 
  do you think belgium would have declared war on germany in case they had n't invaded you ? 
  you fought for them ? 
  on what front did you fight ? 
  most countries did n't, 
  [ i wrote about that ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2dj6ud/today_sweden_hasnt_formally_been_in_war_in_200/cjq2lvz ), 
  i think you missed the whole cold war . 
  able to defend in 41 ? 
  yeah maybe but it would still be just a question of time for how long we can hold out , a longer war just means more casualties , more cities bombed . 
  i do n't know , there may be some good reasons why we did n't it 's good if not all states are in the war in the end . 
  this operation could for example not have happened had sweden not been neutral : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/white_buses, 
  oh well then , i stand corrected . 
  why are you being mean ? 
  incorrect , there were no casualties . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anglo-swedish_war_ ( 1810 % e2 % 80 % 9312 ) it was n't really a war , sweden and britain were allied in the napoleonic wars . 
  there is [ hearts of iron ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rot24mhpszk ) though . 
  [ ah but you know how it usually works out ] ( http://i.imgur.com/orvyh3s.jpg ) did n't you know that the only reason sweden stopped with war is that it would be unfair to everyone else ? 
  they allied germany when operation barbarossa started . 
  which i do n't think you can blame them for . 
  i will not . 
   yeah - `` sweden has n't declared war in 200 years . '', 
  it 's really nothing to brag about when you 've done exactly nothing to protect other nations that protected sweden from nazi and soviet domination . 
  there is no bragging i do n't know where you get that from . 
  which countries did anything to protect other countries from germany or soviet before they were thrown into the conflict against their will ? 
   no , not like everyone else . 
  believe or not , not every nation has been as cowardly and short term focused as sweden . 
  countries like the uk courageously made the difficult decisions and sacrifices necessary to ensure their own long term freedom and security , which goes beyond their own borders . 
  freeloading and refusing solidarity with countries that had the balls to actually do something is nothing to be proud of . 
  it 's easier to be courageous when you 're big country with a strong military and do n't have the most powerful and ruthless country in the world surrounding your land border , but yeah granted the uk were one of three countries who did declare war on germany , but that was before germany 's dominance in europe . 
  why would you interpret this post as bragging ? 
  it 's an interesting fact and quite a rarity in this world . 
  are n't we the same ? 
  who is bragging about it ? 
  the only countries who declared war on germany was france , the uk+c ommonwealth and brazil . 
  people today can go `` why were n't you in the war you cowards '' but the truth is that everyone tried to stay neutral just like us until germany declared war on them . 
  sweden is not neutral anymore , this is 2014 not 1939 . 
  we 're in the eu and we are very much involved with nato . 
  you have n't provided any facts , just made a few overly simplified and ignorant statements . 
  i guess we 're the only ones who profit from war . 
  sense of self righteousness ? 
  sweden has never taken credit for wwii . 
  we 're just glad we managed to stay out of the conflict like everyone else tried to . 
  france and the uk did declare war . 
  congratulations on your horribly simplified view on the conflict . 
  let me try and explain why i think sweden appeasing nazi germany was a good thing to do . 
  first off the swedish military was extremely weak in 1939 , after wwi we had started to disarm our military , we would n't have stood a chance in a german invasion . 
  another point is that sweden had taken a lot of refugees from denmark and norway , almost the entire jewish population managed to flee to sweden before the germans came beause of an excellent collaboration between denmark and sweden . 
  raoul wallenberg had introduced swedish safety passports in hungary to ~ 100,000 jews who all survived the war because of this . 
  and in the end of the war another swedish diplomat managed to save ~ 25,000 concentration camp prisoners and take them to sweden . 
  so let 's say sweden decided to refuse germany 's demands . 
  they would have invaded us , taken the country in maybe weeks or even days . 
  * thousends of danish , norwegian and swedish jews , political enemies and etc would have been sent to camps . 
  * ~ 100,000 hungarian jews would have been sent to camps . 
  * sweden would have been bombed and then be under occupation throughout the rest of the war . 
  * all of scandinavia would have been under nazi rule . 
  * no swedish aid to norway or training of norwegian resistance fighters in sweden would have been possible . 
  * germany would hold sweden 's resources . 
  people can say it was a cowardly move but i think humanitairianly ( ? ), 
  and strategically it was a brilliant move . 
  no we helped both sides throughout the entire war , read some of the other posts . 
  we helped norway during the occupation , their resistence movement trained here . 
  allied planes were also allowed to land here during the war after bombing germany and not having enough fuel to go back . 
   and some of the countries took it upon themselves to defend what in their eyes was the right thing to do . 
  no country took it upon themselves to defend what in their eyes was the right thing to do , they were all attacked . 
  i think i 've heard some weapons were sold to the axis aswell . 
  as it is known sweden helped both sides in the war but when we helped germany it was mostly to prevent an invasion . 
  another example of sweden helping the allies is the sinking of bismarck . 
  bismarck was first spotted by hms gotland of the swedish navy who informed the navy of it 's location which latered warned the british royal navy that it was coming so they could begin chasing it . 
  no that was one of the exceptions . 
  proud is not the right word , not ashamed either . 
  we did what every other country would have done but could n't do . 
  essentially ? 
  that 's a bit of a stretch in my opinion . 
  we allowed temporary access to allied nations aswell at some points , for example we allowed american planes to land here and transport materials into norway . 
  i guess we could say sweden was n't completely neutral to any of the sides but we stayed out of the war and that 's what mattered . 
  yes . 
  bombing civilians ? 
  yes but it was necessary to keep the peace . 
  eh , they should n't be . 
  edit : what i mean is i think they should understand that we had to do certain things to remain out of the war and i think in the end norwegians gained more from sweden staying neutral than getting invaded by nazi germany . 
  many norwegian refugees fled to sweden and the norwegian resistance trained in sweden , also sweden sent aid to norway during the occupation . 
  all countries who were invaded can say that we were cowards and they would have heroically saved all their neighbours and never agreed to terms from nazi germany to prevent an invasion , but i think in reality that 's bullshit , all countries had to think about themselves and their people first , that 's why only three countries actually declared war on nazi germany throughout the war until 1945 . 
  ( france , uk+c ommonwealth and brazil who had the luxary of being on another continent ) . 
  announce neutrality and remain neutral but be prepared to make exceptions . 
  although we 've been involved in peacekeeping missions in some countries . 
  calm down man , read the post i made in this thread , i took all the dishes from wikipedia 's page , i did n't have time to make an extensive research on every fucking country 's cuisine . 
  i have also apologised if anyone felt they got the wrong dish for their country . 
  yes i 'm aware of this , a discussion of which national dishes are more suitable is most welcome . 
  i forgot to upload these : ** sweden : ** [ k\u00f6ttbullar ] ( http://i.imgur.com/eoy5vmd.jpg ) ** georgia : ** [ khachapuri ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7cpkc_dtnly/tmxaoyp9m4i/aaaaaaaagz4/dtu0cvb7pzu/s1600/khachapuri%2b-%2bajaruli.jpg ) source is : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_dish , for those countries who had several i decided to pick the first dish . 
  if there is something incorrect , please share .
