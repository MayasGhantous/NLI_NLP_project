  ** edit : ** sorry many of you are not happy with the dish i choose for your country . 
  i guess pretty much every country is up for discussion over what their actual national dish is since there does n't seem to be many official ones , these are just the national dishes according to wikipedia i guess . 
  take this thread as a chance to discuss what dish is most appropriate as a national dish for each country instead of fact . 
  i like these posts where all of europe is represented , there 's something for everyone . 
  thanks / u/horg, 
  yeah . 
  much shorter trip !, 
  it 's only like 2 meters shorter than the statue of liberty . 
  i think gamla stan deserves a spot . 
  here 's one cool and uncool thing at the same time , miyazaki was planning on making a movie out of pippi l\u00e5ngstrump but lindgren refused . 
  [ here ] ( http://comicsalliance.com/pippi-longstocking-film-hayao-miyazaki-astrid-lindgren-studio-ghibli/ ) is the concept art he drew while visiting visby for the film . 
  and [ this one showing visby .

  i have it on my bucket list to touch them all ... at least see them . 
  but i said it so that 's what matters is n't it ? 
  i meant in here . 
  flairs, 
  silly mexicans they ca n't handle viking food . 
  but seriously people need to stop having these stupid `` surstr\u00f6mming challenges '' and learn how to prepare and eat it properly to be able to enjoy the delicacy that it is . 
  eating surstr\u00f6mming like they do is the equivalent of picking up a snail from the ground and swallowing it and then claiming escargots is bad food . 
  the can is best opened under water to avoid as much of the smell as possible , and the fish needs to be gutted ( really ? ), 
  and is best served somewhat [ like this ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_0stik9slgl0/tev0l9a-oki/aaaaaaaahq0/hdb41syo-4i/s1600/dsc_0621.jpg ), 
  jokes on you i do n't need to . 
  you 've clearly not been here then , hamburgers are popular in many restaurants here and many people eat them . 
  i had a nice avocado burger last week . 
   * the mackintosh building at the glasgow school of art was severely damaged in a fire [ 1 ] , just a few days before the annual degree show . 
  the building is regarded as one of the finest examples of art nouveau architecture in the world , and the scottish and uk governments have already pledged money towards its restoration . 
  big tragedy , i 'm a fan of mackintosh . 
  are you saying the nazis are bad ? 
  which continent though ? 
  oh we might keep this . 
  it was a joke , in america the social media confused czech republic with chechnya . 
  so germany is in egypt now ? 
  [ this is how the eu does it ] ( http://www.medaltracker.eu/ ), 
  it made this shot so much better . 
  i thought it sounded indian , i feel bad leaving states empty so i 'd rather just take a wild guess . 
  east prussia fucks everything up for everyone , it 's understandable . 
  as a citizen of high standard of living i think this person did well . 
  had to play it safe . 
  i gave it a shot a while ago when this was a thing on reddit .

  i have never seen a person wanting to be assasinated as badly as david cameron . 
  [ whaaaat ] ( http://weknowgifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/what-the-fuck-is-going-on-gif.gif ), 
  was he clear about his intentions on this before the election ? 
  mouth watering . 
  remove the pineapple and i love it . 
  [ gordon ramsay still believes ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucml5mvsg18 ), 
  but you still choose to call your food fine dining as opposed to ours . 
  also the principal himself had protested the idea . 
  a nose ? 
  is this 2001 ? 
  i was very much expecting this , basically every country has about 5 potentional correct first capitals depending how you look at it . 
  it says ** current ** countries , do you realise how cluttered this map would be if it showed all countries that has ever existed in europe ? 
  also no the uk has been given 4 capitals , not 5 . 
  that 's a fuckload of cities, 
  many of these countries are not sucessors of todays countries . 
  a few things corrected : http://i.imgur.com/q7ylnxb.png, 
  i used this one http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/burgundian_netherlands maybe wrong ? 
  it said ` gniezdno ' was the polish spelling . 
  the napoleonic kingdom of italy in 1805 had milan as capital . 
  the source for this is mostly wikipedia , obviously i 'm aware that there probably are many mistakes here so please inform me if you see anything so i can correct . 
  it was also difficult to have a consistency in what you consider the birth of the country , as you can see this does n't show the first capitals of ancient greece and macedonia , i was n't sure how to decide when they `` started '' , so if you have any ideas of how to best decide that , please share . 
  bosphorus is . 
  how did they get to the netherlands though , it seems like they would have to cross a load of other airspaces first . 
  how ? 
  they have big brother for kids now ? 
  that 's just harmless fun , not anti-americanism . 
  middle east : /, 
  noone cares norwegian . 
  it 's hard to say with just these few pictures but i too hope the french will behave as well they can . 
  i meant the bit about europe . 
  you 've got it all wrong i 'm afraid . 
  that muslims are more likely to be super religious ? 
  i agree . 
  i 've lived in suburb where most people are muslim , it 's really nice and peaceful place in my opinion . 
  the thing is what people see on the news ( which is the only way many people hear about muslims ) is terrorism , riots civil war and stuff like that , but in reality most muslims are perfectly normal people , especially immigrants , they 've fled their countries for the opression , they have no wish to establish it in our countries , but of course there are some bad eggs who are more loud than everyone else . 
  do you really ? 
  i 've never heard that before . 
  i would say norway is our closest friend . 
  maybe because i grew up in j\u00e4mtland , i guess for a scanian maybe denmark is the closest friend . 
  i 'm deeply hurt, 
  it was incredible . 
  4-4 was nice for us . 
  let 's just all go to syria . 
  well when they start breaking into their summer houses to move in i think we will hear differently from them . 
   the survey says 31 percent of respondents said they would be willing to accept a refugee in her home . 
  who are these people ? 
  why are n't they living up to their word right now ? 
  and do n't they realise there were people needing homes long before the current refugee crisis ? 
  i think 95 % of those people are bullshitting . 
  how did that happen ? 
  britain is like a little kid , you know that time you had a fight with your parents and decided to move out of the house . 
  you make some sandwiches , bring some juice and fold it into a piece of fabric and head out telling your parents `` goodbye forever '' . 
  their response is `` sure '' . 
  10 minutes later you 're back in the house again , you completely forgot tom & jerry was on . 
  well i know ptsd is super common , but for all of them to go through it seemed a bit much so that 's why i wondered if there was something else behind it . 
  not because it was the first thing i thought but because it was possible . 
  i did n't go to a big school but you could choose between eating what was served or vegetarian . 
  to have vegetarian you have to get your name on a list . 
  damn .
