from the german public to the swedish public . . vattenfall is 100 % state owned . 
  modern economies run on mindless consumerism though, 
  one humanist and statesman is far better than the old despot kings though !, 
  bridges are boring . 
  i can imagine they have higher symbolic value in denmark , tying the country together with asphalt i guess , but they are man made , concrete , gray and boring ... 
  always the most modern . 
  upvote for brunost on a banknote . 
  forgot to update the watermark . 
  thanks !, 
  the differences in trends is quite puzzling and interesting . 
  i 'm swedish by the way . . ( and employed and 25 < me < 30 ), 
  you should probably wander between austria and slovenia then i think . 
  just because you do n't have job at 25 does n't mean you do n't have a future . . not necessarily . 
  republic of garden gnomes . 
  cool map . 
  france is the only one of the biggest 5 eu countries with no red ( so i guess , no regional development fund for them ) . 
  ahem , that 's c\u00f4te d'ivoire though, 
  skimming through it looks like all the members will get the same pestering mail from the european commission , but only those in the eurozone can be fined . 
  it appears all member states are `` tracked '' for their performance according to the stability pact criteria , but i wonder if the legal requirements differ . 
  [ link to some `` monitoring '' of member states ' status here ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/economic_governance/sgp/corrective_arm/index_en.htm ) a lot to read !, 
  well you can do one thing right at the same time you 're doing something else wrong . 
  devomax : give the land back to various sami , finnish and nordic tribes . 
  close the cites and make all the urbans become independent farmers . 
  finally those hipsters get some amish to go with the beards . 
  revive the tradition of going viking instead of exporting pop music and volvos . 
  it 's the germans who are insane ( ly great ) . 
  very large installed capacity in a very densely populated country , with less or equal sea access than denmark .

  * * rykepungsv\u00e4gen * translates to `` jerk scrotum street '' . 
  not a surprise , if we count in beer and beer culture every czech is indeed very rich :-) . 
  and we import and love your beer ; i bet there is n't much beer flowing the other way . 
  unsurprisingly , the * national anthem * of the czech is titled [ * where is my home ? 
  students have access to `` members only '' pubs with much lower prices . 
  ( ~ 3 $ for a good imported .33 cl ) it 's ridiculous really . 
  prices do vary but the cheapest you will ever find in a regular pub is 35-39 kr ( 3.8 - 4.2 $ ) . 
  normal price is indeed around 55 - 60 kr ( 6 $ and more ) . 
  in a sports bar or english pub style bar probably +1 $ more . 
  edit : oh and high five currency cousins , swedish krona vs czech koruna, 
  very cool website . 
  [ sweden vs czechia ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_countries_result.jsp?country1=sweden&amp;country2=czech+republic&amp;displaycurrency=eur ), 
  i like it too, 
  in spain you get ca\u00f1as , like a small glass of beer normally . 
  i 'd guess it 's around 0.25 l or even 0.20 l. 
  but danish intonation is closer to german ; it 's a bit flatter . 
  where i was there was actually a sign for that , it said : `` vorbild vor kinder sein '' next to the red light ( `` be a good role model for kids '' ) . 
  yes . 
  there 's no way scotland can join schengen -- it can only have open borders either with the schengen treaty or with the uk . 
  obviously they have to choose to have their actual land border be the open border . 
  the cirklejerk has lasted 13-14 years now , hardly related to transient phenomena like the wc :-), 
  there 's a huge cirklejerk about zlatan in sweden in general . 
  as a swede , i 've always suspected that in ratings like this they just calibrate their metrics so that sweden ends up at the top and then go with that . 
  it seems like it , it 's kind of ridiculous . 
  i suppose this is free software foundation europe . 
  10/10 really ruled those shower waves . 
  thanks this will be my morning anthem for today, 
  i think a community service year would be awesome , like in germany . 
  it should n't replace the military service , just be the alternative . 
  it 's the other way around , game of thrones is the england & britain reference . 
  all the talk of possible difficulties of joining the eu is just fear mongering from the status quo supporters i suspect . 
  there is no sensible way to have the breakout countries first leave the eu only to re-join later . 
  if there was n't so much at stake , i hope the politicians could just have said of course you will have a place in the eu when you are separated . 
  that 's what i wonder , the big eu countries do n't want to share power with big turkey . 
  that 's the one angola was supposedly buying right ? 
  oh yup my bad, 
  it could be the netherlands . 
  i 'd call it [ the nordic council ] ( http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council ) . 
  since before the countries joined the eu ( some of them ) , but also presently , the nordics have a deeper integration of job market , healthcare , education than with the eu . 
  the passport union is also technically less restrictive than schengen . 
  for example even eu citizens have to ask for a residence permit to stay in sweden . 
  a nordic citizen does n't need to ask anyone for a permit to settle in sweden . 
  fwiw , the nordics are n't circled together either . 
  it 's the origin of zlatan ibrahimovic . 
  what about karl xi who planned to deport a large portion of sk\u00e5ne 's people to the baltic states . . sk\u00e5ne being the region that really suffered from the wars with two countries ' armies going over it back and forth . 
  i 'm not an europhile but that does n't make me eurosceptic . 
  if you extended it on the right side , you could have had the bay of riga , estonia and eventually finland \u2192 look where gotland is in this image and on an [ overview map ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/europe_satellite_orthographic.jpg ), 
  kill the frontline soldiers and let the big fish get away , i guess ? 
  london is across the schengen border though , so it 's not likely . 
  swedes like most other people are blind to what their own culture is , thinking of themselves as the most civilized peoples and perhaps even being `` past culture '' , i think you are right about progressiveness is part of the culture . 
  it 's really expensive, 
  the cms is only one of the two general-purpose detectors used to confirm higgs ( the other is atlas ) . 
  did you mean england ? 
  life is suffering , so have another snickers ^ tm,

  serfdom did n't really occur in sweden, 
  thanks . 
  i 'm swedish , and some people here seem to think this argument is valid even when they try to use it themselves . . ( `` they do n't do it the swedish way ^ tm , so it must be a bad idea '' ), 
  sweden is the largest and most active swedencirclejerk in the world !,
