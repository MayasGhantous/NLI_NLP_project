  this reminds me , apparently eu is directing a change in how gdp is accounted , to include parts of the invisible economy , like [ this article about accounting for prostitution in denmark ] ( http://politiken.dk/oekonomi/gloekonomi/ece2308211/danske-prostituerede-skal-taelles-med-i-bruttonationalproduktet/ ) / [ ( translated ) ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=da&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fpolitiken.dk%2foekonomi%2fgloekonomi%2fece2308211%2fdanske-prostituerede-skal-taelles-med-i-bruttonationalproduktet%2f&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ) just remember to be critical if everyone is reporting a small boost ; it would be strange if it does n't if you change the way you measure it . 
  the panic button is kind of what you 're seeing in spain i guess ? 
  uk and iceland should just settle their differences through trial by combat . 
  i think iceland could find a good champion . . 
  ok . why do you think she should have voted against it ? 
  it looks like she abstained , but i fully accept that you can interpret that as a failure . 
  poltical discourse in sweden is very narrowly focused on some particular themes at a time , and the media situation is pretty bad too ( pirate party was excluded from the biggest tv debate ) . 
  your summary is very violent !, 
  thank you germany . 
  i 'm very sad to see amelia andersdotter losing her seat ; _ ;, 
  great persons can make a big difference still . 
  there were only 19 swedish meps , so it 's relatively easy to find out which of those you thought did a good job . 
  ex-yugoslavia was n't in the warsaw pact though . 
  do you want to adopt iceland ? 
  elections are always on sundays in sweden . 
  you could vote by mail/prevote today if you want to continue detachment without worry though . 
  imagine our life ( english as second language speakers ) . 
  every day reading/writing on reddit , listening to media or entertainment in english , reading textbooks and writing reports in english bur never or rarely do you open your mouth to speak it . 
  that 's what i think is weird . 
  language diversity is good , not bad . 
  that only means that russia goes on to the finals right , where the booing can reach a much larger audience . 
  ireland should get bog . 
  agreed, 
  it 's ridiculous to blame him for anything , he 's but a clueless pawn in putin 's annexation of crimea . 
  me too . 
  french girl speaking german ... < 3, 
  the dutch accent sounds exactly like swedish to me , once i 'm tired enough ( i 'm swedish ) . 
  fdr absolutely , for how he influenced the vision for postwar germany and europe . 
  sweden < 3 norway . 
  it sounds about right . 
  that 's how he got the nato job i guess, 
  um , it revealed that swedish fra did lie to members of parliament and broke the law in sweden , so it was important for us . . 
  [ looks like a man in this version :-) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:stockholm_vapen_bra.svg ), 
  who is the woman on stockholm 's flag ? 
  it 's nice , i like that it 's a distinctly non-national flag ; a different style is good for a city symbol . 
  i have n't seen it in sweden . 
  i did love to have that as a snack along the autobahn in germany though . 
  i do n't think anything is more german to me than the bakery shops everywhere and various things you can get in a br\u00f6tchen like fleischk\u00e4se or herring . 
  we swedes eat herring in lots of different ways and all the ones i practice are delicious , but that does n't grab any headlines ~ ~ one example : curry pickled herring . 
  yum . 
  i think indian food is relatively popular in germany . 
  how can you choose that over [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:th%c3%bcringer_rostbratwurst.jpg ) ?? 
  :-) i 'm definitely on the german side of the wurstgrill . 
  two amazing dishes that are hard to get in sweden : * [ bigos ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bigos ) ( poland ) * [ boquerones ] ( http://casadejuanico.blogspot.com/2013/03/tostas-de-pimientos-del-piquillo-y.html ) ( spain ), 
  wo n't be friends with bullies is a great reason to not join nato for me , since it 's lead by the nation that invaded iraq . 
  it 's perfectly possible to get people to take a beer after work , but not every day . 
  i wonder what color the vatican is . 
  should n't there be something , is n't this concept related to nietzsche ? 
  it 's [ there now ] ( http://www.votewatch.eu/en/european-single-market-for-electronic-communications-draft-legislative-resolution-article-23-paragra.html#/##vote-tabs-list-2 ) -- see comment by oln deeper in this thread too . 
  [ his face is everywhere like this ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-p5c6hubcqeq/tzomkkyeyhi/aaaaaaaaalu/x2f-mye6vuo/s400/schaeuble-stasi-2.0.svg_.png ), 
  that 's interesting !, 
  according to [ andersdotter , yes . 
  `` in the future we will have fair usage bills '' ] ( https://twitter.com/teirdes/status/451463348820148224 ), 
  * thank you european parliament !, 
  the election is soon . 
  make sure to vote for someone that supports net neutrality . 
  historically , there is a big party group difference and left-wing , green or pirate parties are much more protective of citizens ' rights when it comes to international treaties ( like acta/ttip ) , internet privacy and copyrights . 
  you are great !, 
  the kingdom of two cyprus confused me for a bit, 
  [ original link ( in swedish , including audio ) ] ( http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=83&amp;artikel=5823349 ) . 
  for me it 's weird how the saab exec uses very nonchalant language to dismiss the questions . 
  majority atheist suspects are foremost former eastern germany and czech republic . 
  given the risk assessment , it seems right that only those who volunteered did the recovery . 
  no this was not what i intended . 
  imagine if you have family ties or had grown up in two or more countries , for example both in france and the uk . 
  in reality you will be welcomed with irish stereotypes and nobody knowing what the different factions you 're talking about even are . 
  i thought this sub was a place to unabashedly bash the americans together !, 
  surely that 's the meaning of europe . 
  hey i 'm not mad , this is fun . 
  great party !, 
  also remember common sense everyone . 
  i 've only experienced debate here and found that the other did n't debate my post at all , they were just ranting about their frustration with my country as if i was responsible for that ( `` why are you always x. . '' ) . 
  basically every step a strawman based upon my flag . 
  of course , most redditors are not like that . 
  only a full myspace page in my flair can represent my personality personally . 
  yup i agree with you . 
  like many have noticed , it 's just common sense : just because someone has flag x , does n't mean they stand for the same actions , opinions , stereotypes or even historical stuff as the country x. edit : also , have fun , but do n't be a dick to someone just because you do n't like/accept their country x. 
  ironically , phones have this smart input system where you can browse characters to insert . . on a computer i 'm powerless and i ca n't find the promille sign ... 
  feel free to talk about bulgaria all you want . 
  all we want to do is remember we are all individuals who are not just defined by a single flag , whichever it is . 
  that 's what i 'm saying . . some of us have multiple flags we could stick to our name -- `` normal people '' have complex identities !, 
  when people ask me `` do you feel more x nationality or y '' i usually have to answer that it does n't really matter . 
  either way , sometimes you ca n't do anything on reddit without having someone attack you for it . . it 's mostly in the noise though , just ignore it . 
  aww , only 10 % . 
  thanks for considering it though :-), 
  you can criticize countries all you want , just do n't bring me into it if i happen to have the same flag as that country . 
  this discussion is just an idea of creating some common understanding on this topic and maybe adding it to the guidelines so that it 's not forgotten completely . 
  i do n't envision it to become a rule or something to `` police '' at all , just something that regulars here will have in the back of their mind somewhere . 
  that alone could be enough to have subs bring it up for example when someone goes wildly over the line . 
  it 's not that hard . . countries have names . 
  if you hate what the vatican is doing , just say * `` why is the vatican doing x , it makes me sick '' * , instead of * `` you make me sick '' *, 
  that sounds like the same idea to me . 
  sure , it 's not a massive problem . 
  but it merits thinking about , it has annoyed me in the past -- you ca n't debate something here if for example the other part debates your country 's ( perceived ) position rather than the content of your posts . 
  people on this sub need to stop addressing other commenters as if they are official representatives of the flag next to their name . 
  they are not . 
  many of you could identify with multiple of the flags and not just one , just to underscore how the flag is just a tiny bit of who you are . 
  [ * what can we do to reduce this problem ? 
  any ideas ? 
  maybe an addition to the rules ?
