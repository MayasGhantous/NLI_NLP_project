  if you lived in a euro country that bailed out a private bank 's loan , then i think you would like your money back . 
  the states decided to take over a bank 's loan , what did they get in return ? 
  is it legitimate to move this burden from the bank to the state ( and its citizens ) ? 
  this * created * a situation where you have to pay if the debtors ca n't . 
  there is clearly room for criticism here , and arguments both pro and against bailout . 
  with bail outs we are constructing a financial system where there is no feedback , no system of self correction for bad lenders . 
  and we pay collectively for their mistakes . 
  how do you know who in the audience you are talking to ? 
  depending on the language , i guess it may be very many or few ? 
  i 'm happy he 's coming home . 
  more people will actually understand yiddish i guess ( since it 's similar to german ) . 
  that 's just been the `` patriotic '' view of history that could never be challenged . 
  i thought it was dead by now though ? 
  i always cringed at the thought of living on karl xii 's street ( when i did ) . 
  either you were being pillaged , or you were `` hosting '' a `` friendly '' army which you had to feed . 
  no doubt normal people were suffering either way . 
  from is to isbj\u00f8rn, 
  nobody has learned their lesson until we regulate the finance sector again . 
  you absolutely can not walk on the tunnel + bridge . 
  sweden has open borders with non-eu norway and they have free access to each other 's job markets just fine ( these are nordic treaties ) . 
  whew , they did n't say they ca n't defend sweden ;-), 
  hitherto is a real naysayer that does n't believe in islands . 
  interesting story . 
  how sad to have the whole island depopulated . 
  the toilets also happen to be of the three colors of the norwegian flag . 
  ultimate fix for climate change , ( human ) cancer , and aids . 
  i think the uk should change election system instead , abandon first past the post for a more representative system . 
  that 's the more important reform . 
  we always need to consume less , use less resources . 
  the logging industry and paper industry do in the end use a lot of . . yes , oil and petrol for power & transport . 
  do you mean that it was n't spain before 1492 ? 
  congratulations and happy assumption of the virgin mary !, 
  that 's the norwegian name . 
  swedes use it ? 
  ah that illustration, 
  how can you stand to look at mercator though ? 
  [ this is ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/winkel_tripel_projection ) often used for data presentation on a world map . . 
  five eyes bacon !, 
  it 's close . 
  i also read these when i was little , and i just found they are being republished in several volumes . 
  really neat , just got vol i so far . 
   short name  former yugoslav republic of macedonia , the sure, 
  l\u00f6rdag is so yesterday, 
   swedish idol judge alexander bard said the arrest was not racial profiling , but related to the swedish authorities ' pursuit of celebrities . 
   he told billboard : `` this arrest was not racial profiling , which is an american [ phenomenon ] not a swedish phenomenon . 
  but it was clearly a case of celebrity profiling . '', 
  ridiculous argument . 
  racial profiling can exist in sweden , it 's not a fairy land . 
  you do n't need to do anything but being a legal resident i guess to be insured , so there is no card . 
  well i do n't for example have any insurance card , other than the ehic itself, 
  ugh , it 's just more resonances from the particle zoo !, 
  is n't that right where the german minority of brazil is the biggest ? 
  wow , did n't know the president of the parliament was so snarky . 
  distasteful, 
   stralsund could be [ carl wilhelm scheele ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carl_wilhelm_scheele ) actually , the swedes usually count him as one of `` their '' scientists . 
  scheele discovered several elements . 
  one of them maybe . 
  financial institutions that are completely unaccountable is another reason for the world wide mess . 
  confirmed, 
  the banks have loaded over the debt on sovereign states by now ( like germany and france ) , it is too late to hope for them to take anything of the fall anymore . 
  why are the us & uk so abysmal at having women in parliament ? 
  then follow that up with germany 's gdp, 
  so do you think every comment on reddit is an attack ? 
  it was just a comment , you do n't have to `` do better '' , it 's fine . 
  norwegian car though, 
  i bet she 's going to be a careful driver . 
  this is the end of wikiterrorism, 
  and if you 're catholic you might end up in the sacred [ bl\u00f3t ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bl%c3%b3t ) tree yourself . 
  ^ wait ^ a ^ minute , ^ you ^ said ^ switzerland , ^ not ^ sweden . . 
  nobody would even associate norwegians with the word migrant though . 
  sigh , getting ready for eurovision . . 
  war tension with norway increasing . 
  yesteday dn.se ran [ this story ] ( http://www.dn.se/nyheter/varlden/norge-anklagas-for-att-omhanderta-barn-pa-losa-grunder/ ) [ ( thelocal english version ) ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/20150512/norways-child-welfare-slammed-by-swedish-press ) with the heading `` norway uses nazi methods '' . 
  they always fix their fucked up headlines later , after having caught enough clicks . 
  not in those videos . 
  oh , so assholes do n't care and break the barrier , innocents presumably die because the barrier is missing . 
  great . . 
  poland wtf ? 
  i 'm intrigued by these 0.0 safety countries . 
  must be something fundamental missing from the safety protocol . 
  do it . 
  support community-developed software and an open project you can trust with your privacy ... we need to use firefox to show we are serious about privacy . 
  community-created software has different incentives and serve the user better in some aspects . 
  example : `` copy protection '' marker in pdfs , free software evince does n't limit you by arbitrary markers like that . 
  this reminds me of `` just because there is a lack of jobs does n't mean there 's nothing that needs to be done '', 
  yes . 
  i wonder why this particular feature is so good at jumping across languages, 
  useless fuzzy questions . 
  the ** r ** map makes me think of a question that had before : how can the ** r ** change have spread across languages , and so effectively ( blue in the map ) ? 
  allegedly it comes from french ( ? 
  what 's the connection to the topic of this subreddit ? 
  i do n't understand . 
  context-less posts have a harder time , i guess . 
  it 's good to start practicing while it 's easy . 
  i thought uk and ireland were in a passport union ? 
  no eu money for connecting member states ? 
  edit : we also need norway to ~ ~ help us ~ ~ pay for a fast link from oslo , g\u00f6teborg , copenhagen down to hamburg .
