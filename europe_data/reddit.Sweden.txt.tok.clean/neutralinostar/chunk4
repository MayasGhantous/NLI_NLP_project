  is it really political ? 
  utc is just the name for it with a more precise technical definition . 
  italy ? 
   in spain , cows outnumbered people up until the 19th century . 
  the country 's name should 've been tierra de vacas xp i think if the cows would have decided democratically , they would have called it * moo !, 
  and you found out that there is an european dictatorship that is even worse ? 
  surprising . . ;-), 
  why restore a human-created desert again ? 
  this is a bit puzzling . 
  yes . 
  i think it 's cool how these names are included in other languages without translation , for example groenlandia for greenland in italian . 
  coincidentally , tomorrow it is good friday and dancing in establishments is not permitted in some l\u00e4nder of germany . 
  you can fold the f-35 contract into paper airplanes, 
  got goosebumps from winged hussars and chills from the horrors of bombed cities . 
  great video !, 
  no reason to accept anything created in such an antidemocratic way anyway . 
  the whole treaty process is despicable . 
  pretty stupid communists in that case . 
  the communist party in russia is just some kind of useful idiots for putin . 
  watch out they have atomium , the pinnacle of european culture . 
  it 's called a straw man argument . 
  new government are still young and idealistic , they 'll get corrupted and cynical later . . israel and ksa are already mad , i think that sounds like they are doing stuff right . 
  they treat islam very similar to isis , tbh . 
  destroying old temples and monuments of their own culture 's past has already happened in meccah and jeddah . 
  this is sad . 
  scandinavians are africans . 
  transitively . 
  i knew denmark was just a stunted germany all along .

  animal species reproduce exponentially by nature to fill up their niche . 
  what we need to do is to stop in time before we overshoot ( many say we already have ) , because overshooting your resource limits leads to a painful correction down the line . 
  more humans = more poverty , for everyone . 
  we do n't need to be more . 
  quality over quantity . 
  blown up without proportion . 
  ah that brings me to trentino/south tyrol in italy , also blue . . 
  because every week , scandinavia has to be in your face about its scores on some randomly selected statistic . 
  my explanation is that all these people just calibrate their methods by checking if scandinavia is on top or not . 
  if not , they do over . 
  so you 're saying these are good tourist destinations if i 'm russian ? 
  the [ k-index is going crazy ] ( http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/planetary-k-index ) !, 
  . . no idea what it means . 
  queueing for trains and buses in sweden ? 
  it 's rare . 
  it does n't happen when it matters ( when there are tons of people ) . 
  half god , half souvlaki, 
  yes . 
  it 's the new clash of civilizations . 
  [ this was just plain weird ] ( http://m.thelocal.no/20150313/scandinavia-accused-of-meddling-in-israel-vote ), 
  [ here 's some background ] ( http://rarehistoricalphotos.com/joseph-stalin-mugshot-held-okhrana-tsarist-secret-police-1911/ ) to his mugshot, 
  media keeps referring to his `` love child '' . 
  i though that was an apt way to describe his girlfriend . 
  you know you 're a dictator when . . . . you 're gone for 5 days and everyone is entertaining the thought of you being dead . 
  yup that 's this map : [ `` only 2 percent of the australian population lives in the yellow area '' ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1q7p36/only_2_percent_of_the_australian_population_lives/ ), 
  and there 's a chemical element named after it . 
  [ wow , it 's quintupled in value in 10 years ] ( http://www.nbim.no/fondet/markedsverdi/ ) ( unadjusted for inflation i guess , but still . . ),

  our incineration plants are a marvel to the world . 
  [ naples ] ( https://www.google.se/search?q=naples+garbage ) should look into getting one . 
  you 're talking about the uk , right ? 
  i 'm not a leaver in any way either . 
  i know that adult eyes are a bit different than children eyes , so i may even be wrong about how a textbook should be written . 
  it reads like an ad , not a textbook . 
  i 'm not overly critical , but the infographic here does not have a factual tone . 
  weird that there are so many numbers & statistics , those change pretty quickly . 
  attack her policies instead of attacking how she phrased something . 
  lol it 's so tiny , hanging around in a corner like some french territory ( not pictured ), 
  finland has the worst economy in the eu . 
  lol , that 's a joke, 
  you use a lot of tar, 
  we had that government that made everyone happy by lowering taxes . 
  wonder where the money came from . . 
  does anyone ever do this survey in sweden ? 
  that 'd be interesting . 
  unfortunately this skit does not have subtitles :( it 's about pizza sallad . 
  norwegians know their cheeses : brunost , gulost , pultost . 
  a simple system for the three cheeses of the world !, 
  pascal 's wager potentially pays of when you 're dead . 
  building better communities is something you can enjoy while you 're alive . 
  reminds me of this comic http://imgur.com/up6yu, 
  a lot more intelligent than the new swedish bills ( basically : these old famous culture people ) . 
  right , so the french legislators can look at sweden and norway to see what effects this kind of law had there . 
   first of all , regulated prostitution is completely victimless . 
  this is not a reality anywhere though , even in countries like germany , there are many trafficking victims . 
  with this situation you have to be pragmatic , we do n't have the luxury of using arguments from liberalism/consenting adults theory when in practice so many are coerced . 
  is there another name i can use ? 
  or do i have to figure out which of the things is correct to say about the big country and say that and ireland ? 
  no way , [ max von sydow ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/max_von_sydow ), 
  it sounds like jau to me, 
  he looks a bit intellectual to me . 
  he should be careful . 
  interesting . 
  i always imagine that higher prices can indicate stricter regulation .
