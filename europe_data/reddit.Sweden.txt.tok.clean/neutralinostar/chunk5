  like it does in sweden , to some extent . 
  how is antibiotics use in livestock in switzerland ? 
  sweden , do n't forget to eat your kroppkakor . 
  germanic club, 
  the u.k. is a low level of corruption country compared with many other member states , and that 's just one of the reasons they are a good ally to have in the union . 
  we need more of us to influence the rest . 
  you can blame everything that mixes people or makes the world smaller , everything that happened the last 100 years and most of what we think of as progress . . 
  what do you think of the decisions of european institutions to take over the loans from private actors ? 
  this has put us in a very uncomfortable position . 
  the original lenders got off scot free . 
  yet they have the realistic policy of debt restructuring when european institutions just want . . what ? 
  someone to pay that ca n't . 
  lenders need to suffer for lending out money to those that ca n't pay back , it 's a mistake just as much in their judgment . 
  what happens is that people will eventually start cooperating and talking if something unusual happens . 
  for example , when the bus was very late , about 1 hour into the waiting , people started to talk to each other , like coming together to solve the problem . 
  not that we could do anything but complain . 
  the bus finally showed up after 2,5 hours . 
  it was also winter and cold . 
  which is a myth that never seems to die . 
  wikipedia lists france significantly above sweden in suicides per population . 
  right , this is something ttip could have done . 
  give some , take some . 
  we need something on that scale ( u.s & europe at least ) to truly combat tax flight . 
  this is truly in the public interest , and there 's no lobbyists to represent it . 
  pls send villy s\u00f8vndal to eu instead, 
  i guess sweden and finland are more distinct to others , but i do n't have to travel further than germany to meet people who really ca n't tell denmark and sweden apart in any way . 
  the nordic countries certainly bleed into each other into a common stereotype . 
  not pre-europe but pre-nordic integration . 
  nordic agreements still grant much greater mobility than european / schengen . 
   yes , of course it hurts when buds are breaking . 
   why else would the springtime falter ? 
  [ * yes , of course it hurts ( en ) * ] ( http://www.karinboye.se/verk/dikter/dikter-mcduff/of-course-it-hurts.shtml ) / [ * ja visst g\u00f6r det ont ( sv ) * ] ( http://www.karinboye.se/verk/dikter/dikter/ja-visst-gor-det-ont.shtml ) tree poems !, 
  not my photo : [ beech , 2011 , winter , southern sweden ] ( http://obj.fotosidan.se/obj/docpart/8c/8c6ab7ec15ec9ed7586b0eadfa130c2a.jpg ) , [ ( source ) ] ( http://www.fotosidan.se/blogs/fredrikboo/index.htm?date=2012-01-01 ), 
   sweden has the highest suicide rate in the world also popular . 
  sweden is comparable to lots of other european nations . 
  it 's nowhere near the top , france is significantly higher than sweden , for example . 
  this is also why conscription is important for a democracy . 
  war is not a hobby project , every family is affected , so we 'd better think twice about joining an iraq war or something else . 
  per t wrote a column dedicated to this [ * the man without language / mannen utan spr\u00e5k * ( sv ) ] ( http://www.sydsvenskan.se/opinion/per-t-ohlsson/mannen-utan-sprak/ ) with obligatory reminiscing of g\u00f6ran persson . 
  how can you even pronounce a word that starts with phi theta ? 
  well , with more than 2 colors a legend is needed . 
   china the source simply says  * china did not ask this question of xi jinping . 
  it 's the safest choice . 
  seafood as a single category , really ? 
  the centerpiece is really home-pickled herring in at least 5 varieties . 
  none of the sugar abusing stuff you get premade . 
  losing the nordic passport union is a far bigger thing . 
  ok , good to know, 
  there 's one for us and state capitals too here : http://roadstorome.moovellab.com/countries each point has a road to the capital it connects the fastest to . 
  install speedboats to f\u00f8royar or lose it, 
  it 's supposed to be all capitals , and the shortest roads to those . 
  each point has a road to the capital it can reach the quickest . 
  so scotland is closer to dublin than to london . 
  andorra , san marino , liechtenstein , vatican are wrecking their bigger neighbors . 
  literally two kids in a nato sandbox though . 
  if only at least we could get some equity for the concessions . 
  what about an equilibration of corporate tax rules as part of the trade deal ? 
  yeah and germany too , despite germany being the country sending the most people to the ep , only 57 % understand how they are elected . 
  no , absolutely not . 
  political corruption and regulatory capture lead to the crisis , and it was avoidable . 
  there 's certainly positive sides to iceland . 
  you have to ask yourself though , how could they get into [ their financial crisis ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008%e2%80%9311_icelandic_financial_crisis ) that was not good governance , in fact , the government [ was running the banks ' errands ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regulatory_capture ) . 
  nepotism is entrenched in iceland . 
  eu has n't done anything about it yet ( nor did i claim so ) . 
  we need a big bloc to have the power to change this . 
  how to get this done though , no idea . 
  so everyone has their issues they focus on and seek to maybe leave to have better progress on them outside of the eu . 
  it 's sad because i have mine ;-) that the we need eu for : we need a powerful bloc to tackle regulation evasion and tax evasion by multinationals . 
  a single country is powerless . 
  also interersting , border controls will remain , interior minister says  thursday the cabinet will decide to extend the border controls , interior minister anders ygeman said yesterday . 
  the extension will be in place 20 or 30 days , but according to ygeman may they remain until `` the exernal borders of the eu are working and if other countries can take their responsibility in the refugee situation '' . 
  ergo indefinitely . 
  [ source ( swedish ) ] ( http://www.sydsvenskan.se/sverige/skanetrafiken-lagger-om-tagtrafiken/ ), 
  it 's basically both caramel and cheese !, 
  yeah moving from sweden to germany , it took me around 6 months until i finally had learned that i ca n't get groceries on a sunday . 
  ( by learning = adapting and planning better . ),

  this is an explanation for a child . 
  either way , we do n't have conclusive proof that it is painless , only apparently painless . 
   there is no pain . 
  citation needed !, 
  yeah no doubt , but i was curious of why they thought the eu had any influence on the u.s. in this case . 
  that sounds like a good idea . 
  the u.s. is an industrialized nation , if they really want those they can produce it themselves . . 
  i 'm pretty sure that `` lethal injection '' is one of the crueler methods of killing someone , though . 
  how did the eu have any influence ? 
  i was just blown away by all the grown on iceland vegetables . 
  they do n't even have land . 
  it 's just lava and ice . 
  cool, 
  \\ # 2 looks good . 
  what 's the connection to coat of arms or other symbols ? 
  thanks . 
  i think any logo must associate to the coat of arms in some way .
