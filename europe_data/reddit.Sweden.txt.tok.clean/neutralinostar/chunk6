  only # 1 and # 7 qualify , # 7 is the best . 
  peasants had rights in medieval sweden while in many other european countries , they were trapped in a feudal system . 
  it 's one example of a longstanding tradition , but i do n't know what to call it ; it was n't democratic , nor socialist . 
  nice video . 
  it 's like cgp grey , but better . 
  this is a straw man argument , because no conspiracy is claimed . 
  it is legitimate to describe a party 's actions and its implications . 
  there is no real claim as to * why * bbc has acted this way , just that it * does * and that doing so is ( allegedly ) not objective reporting . 
   `` there are many adjectives one can apply to the bbc 's behavior here : `` objective '' and `` neutral '' are most assuredly not among them . '', 
  i just learned that [ * there are 36,681 communes in france * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/communes_of_france ) . 
  wow !, 
  is that going to be reorganized too ? 
   as the accomplice of bush in dragging the west into this * debacle * i think ** war ** is a good word for it . 
  100,000 dead iraqis during the conflict , disorder , chaos , refugees ... war should cover it . 
  how can he rule if he 's busy larping all the time ? 
  i 'm actually not a clog expert , especially not on the global reach of clogs . 
  are `` swedish '' clogs a sweden ( and close area around ) only thing ? 
  never thought about it . 
  please do n't address redditors as if they are official representatives of their flag flair . . 
  everyone knows australia is a continent , curious minds will want to know what other german speaking countries are continents too !, 
  we need a strong antisepptic !, 
  it 's eeuu when written though . 
  it 's freaking weird to give awards to government officials of another country , while they are still in office . 
  americans will appreciate that the tax authority declares people dead . 
  i mean , combining the two certain things into one . 
  do n't you see that more southern europe = more drugs ? 
  the solution is easy , ban southern europe . 
  the nordic agreements mean that social services are available to all nordic nationals in finland . 
  this is more generous than the european union agreements , and thus the jobless swede is welcome by default .

  now would be the time for a brit athlete to do this , if they wanted to make a splash . 
  i guess most of them do n't want to involve politics . 
  i do n't think the sentiment of english being `` your '' language is that strong anymore , it 's a world language now . 
  there must be some kind of political theory about why it was acceptable to reduce it so much . 
  anyway , it was a big bucket of budget money that each government could take from to fund the popular thing they wanted to do . 
  economics is political . 
  it 's not bias , it 's politics . 
  absolutely . 
  it 's his best series ever , and it 's very gripping . 
  88 % , i love quizzes . 
  i 've never even been to uk really , but i guess i 'm ready to invade . 
  the 2 millennia old coin on a coin is my favourite ( greek $ 1 ), 
  that 's going to change when the twilight generation comes into power . 
  having family in both countries , it is a bit heart breaking to look at this and seeing the countries going opposite ways . 
  even though we of course have a lot of very important things in common including the nordic treaties . 
  in russia , the mafia in charge has basically eradicated actual politics . 
  do n't worry , the financial system has been fixed , there are new regulations , and there wo n't be any recessions again . . / s, 
  it 's their standard propaganda , pretty boring . 
  big breweries in sweden and denmark really do n't have much to offer . 
  mikkeller is great , and there 's a lot more diversity beers like that in denmark that are interesting . 
  i think i prefer the german beers in fact when it comes to lager . 
  ( which is not a surprise since german beer culture is basically a competition where everyone is making the same beer the best they can . ), 
  spanish beer is totally normal lager beer and it 's good to me . 
  the lowest level court is also called tingsr\u00e4tt ( hovr\u00e4tt , h\u00f6gsta domstolen are the two above ), 
  it rather seems to be the reverse , a language without a country has no power to protect itself . 
  and when it has power , it often suppresses the regional minority languages . 
  irish is a privileged and empowered language to have the protection of a country , very few languages are like that !, 
  ( even if the country in question does n't seem to regard it as its most important language . ), 
  there are lots of awesome things about eu . 
  just remember that being a big empire is not how we measure success . 
  it 's very hard for schengen to happen . 
  scotland should obviously primarily be in a passport union with the countries on the same island . 
  like some ukrainians said , betrayed by a brother . 
  that 's how you get more than 100 %, 
  1970s version of `` capitalism '' is not the same version we are using now . 
  not in sweden , not in other europe . 
  \u00d6 and \u00d8 are equivalent , so it 's no big deal . 
  they found these four positive people at least http://www.sydsvenskan.se/2017-03-02/malmoungdomar-positiva-till-varnplikt, 
  one of the very popular corruption indices is just based on perceived corruption . 
  i do n't like it since it skews the results ( only some kinds of corruption are noticeable ) . 
  i like that , that differences in pronunciation are visible . 
  how did iceland end up with \u00e6 and \u00f6 ? 
  just that it 's a mix of swedish and danish choices for those . 
  you can have many of the same one instead !, 
  norwegian has somewhat more common accent usage than swedish , to separate homonyms for example * for * ( english : for ) and * f\u00f4r * ( english : fodder ) . 
  oh god someone please fix the y axis . 
  i wonder where the laptop ranks . . 
  kickbacks ? 
  easy way to funnel away money , is my guess . 
  http://www.reuters.com/article/greece-corruption-trial-idusl5n0vl3v820150211 this is international corruption , facilitated not just by politicians that take bribes but companies that pay them out ( which is usually illegal ) . 
  edit : http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/complicit-in-corruption-how-german-companies-bribed-their-way-to-greek-deals-a-693973.html, 
  and forest . 
  lots of trees . 
  rest of northern europe and the netherlands maybe ? 
  interesting news , uninteresting angle . 
  farmer , difficulty : ~ ~ hell ~ ~ norway . 
  there is both hope and despair in this , how often we hear about things that only change because a new generation was taught something different . 
  if we want to change something big ( corruption and so on ) we need generations !, 
  my parents have made me understand that this kind of change happened to make people stop throwing garbage in nature , too . 
  i think debit cards are the absolute rule in sweden too . . 
  ah so maybe i can find lots of og that agree with me, 
  why did the germans decide that it was correct to write three l ( * `` ell '' * ) in a row , it looks so wrong . . ? 
  like this : * volllaststunden *, 
  the original memeification with the song & the leek was before youtube and all that . 
  it was a flash thing like this http://leekspin.com/, 
  the `` rational '' month names are really nice , too . 
  it would n't be news if the pony just stuck to the rules and had its bike . 
  there 's no reason to not have horse meat in them except that it should be declared somewhere what the food item contains . 
  it 's the normal name in norway . 
  it sounds a lot more original than the swedish name .
