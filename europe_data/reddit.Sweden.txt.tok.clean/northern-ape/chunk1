your comment confused me as we do it in sweden , but i looked it up and it turns out it 's fairly recent . 
  we adopted it from continental catholic countries after ww2 . 
  that realization is hitting this whole country like a bucket of ice water right now . 
  2003 , world cup . 
  well , the rest of the world was n't really a day at the carneval for the past 1000 years either . 
  there is snow in the north now , so definitely white walkers . 
  we know it very well , thank you . 
  only in lesser scandinavia . 
  swede here . 
  we definitely say it with a circular mouth , slightly bigger than if you were to say `` o '' . 
  kinda like you are deepthroating an invisible dick . 
  i want to add germany and the netherlands to the mix . 
  not sure if they 're relatives , but we are definitely in the same clique . 
  drunk at 4:30 in the morning . 
  regular danish breakfast , i take it ? 
  [ i do n't care if it 's risky , dmitri . 
  i wa n't them to like me . 
  i need this . 
  we do have more than just that one mountain , you know . 
  i do n't know the names of the others , but i 'm pretty sure i 've seen pictures somewhere . 
  yeah . 
  it is also worth noting that there are two ongoing gang-wars , one in malm\u00f6 and one in gothenburg that have resulted in quite a lot of murders which cranks up the statistics a bit . 
  the police in gothenburg recently arrested two guys for planning a retaliation against a guy who had killed killed their friend , so they probably have a good idea of the situation . 
  the number of guys involved in the war in gothenburg according to the police is something like 30 , i think , and this is a city of almost half a million . 
  it 's a horrible situation , of course , but the murders are contained within small groups . 
  [ you are correct !, 
  ] ( https://sv.wiktionary.org/wiki/g%c3%b6ra_en_h%c3%b6na_av_en_fj%c3%a4der ) good call , though i would expect a dane knows his andersen . 
  fair enough . 
  what are you getting out of pretending to be swedish ? 
  singular is krona , not kronor . 
  you are not fooling anyone . 
  `` swedish '' pfft . 
   reddit are serious companies hahaha , google translate satte just dit dig . 
  svensk my ass . 
  hahaha , i understand you absolutely mean this as a compliment but i still ca n't help but feeling a bit underwhelmed . 
  i completely understand it , though . 
  swedes even refer to sweden as `` lilla landet lagom '' which basically translates to `` the little land of not-to-much and not-to-little '' . 
  if it makes you feel better : i 'm swedish , but i had a grandfather who was half austrian half bavarian . 
  he fled the war to go to sweden ( had heart problems ) before the shit hit the fan for real . 
  i asked my mom once if we had any family left in germany and austria and she mentioned my grandfather had a brother who `` went to brazil and was never heard from again '' but she did n't really want to talk about it . 
  i later read about exile nazis going to south america . 
  that 's right , folks . 
  secret nazi uncle . 
  thanks , man !, 
  ceau\u0219escu and the whole dictatorship ordeal , mostly . 
  haha , had this thought , but i did n't want to step on any toes . 
  no idea if you guys are willing to joke about that part yet . 
  around these parts it usually goes the other way around !, 
  oh , that kind of `` party van '' . 
  i had a suspicion , but the possibility of him being brought to a vip-van with the best party in town was too absurd and hilarious to ignore . 
  thanks , man !, 
  what is this `` party-van '' . 
  why is he escorted there in handcuffs ? 
  please , tell us more !, 
  haha , wtf ? 
  context , please !, 
  so what you 're saying is `` it 's like this , but it 's a joke , but not really '' . 
  in swedish `` aldrig '' can be pronounced with either a silent or outspoken `` g '' , so do n't worry . 
  you spell it in the true , proper manner in which i 'm sure it was intended . 
  yeah , it really would , haha . 
  reddit has a thing where it picks something and praises it to high heaven until someone finds something that shatters the image . 
  then people get disappointed and starts to hate it for `` lying '' to them in the first place . 
  it happened with unidan and it happened with sweden . 
  i hope it wo n't happen to you guys because it 's seriously tiresome . 
  i ca n't open a single thread in a post related to sweden because it just derails into a discussion about immigration or feminism . 
  wow , that 's seriously fucked up . 
  any clue why norway ? 
  shit , was that him ? 
  i just picked it off google . 
  yeah , fuck that guy . 
  they say you should always eat carbohydrates before you drink , so i usually have a few beers before i start . 
  haha , that 's actually a pretty nice pic of good ol' g\u00f6ran . 
  pointy nose , high cheekbones and squinty eyes . 
  * some * finns have a very typical and slightly mongol-looking quality , except for the pigmentation . 
  i ca n't look at anyone and see if they 're finnish , but if someone has the features i just mentioned they very often have a finnish background . 
  some examples of what i 'm talking about : [ woman in the middle ] ( http://res-5.cloudinary.com/kuva-api-production-eu-cld/image/upload/w_270,dpr_1.0,f_auto,q_80,d_yle-radio-suomi.jpg/13-1-2675403.jpg ) [ this guy has the eyes i 'm talking about ] ( http://www.nato.int/sfor/nations/various/finland/finnish.jpg ) [ eyes , cheekbones and thin , pointy nose ] ( http://wenatcheeworld.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/ww200710711090031v2_t310.jpg ) [ high cheekbones ] ( http://www.fivb.org/visasp/getphoto.aspx?type=press&amp;no=40871&amp;maxsize=450 ) [ this guy ] ( http://finntimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/dsf2546.jpg ) [ little girl ] ( http://www.gofinland.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/fashion-for-kids-in-finland.jpg ) the saami people who live in northern norway , sweden , finland and northwestern russia have [ similar features ] ( http://www.famgus.se/pictures/sagokonst40a.jpg ) . 
  me too . 
  i 'd say it 's not uncommon for guys to trim their pits to avoid armpit mohawks when wearing a tanktop , but guys having a bit leg/armhair is seen as an admirable thing by both girls and guys here . 
  man , i sit down and pee all the time . 
  not for any political reasons , but i live by myself and it 's less of a cleanup . 
  also , sitting down is more comfy and i can reddit at the same time . 
  eh , i trim with an electrical trimmer when it starts to stick out . 
  i have really light , straight , blond armpit hair and it looks like i carry fair strawed paintbrushes in my armpits if i do n't . 
  no complete shave though . 
  that sound uncomfortable . 
  the trimmer scares me . 
  only safety razors on my scrote . 
  last reactor shut down in 2005 . http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/barseb%c3%a4ck_nuclear_power_plant, 
  you felt the need to hijack a thread about the history of sweden and denmark to tell us how small and insignificant we are ? 
  what the fuck is wrong with you ? 
  we used to warm \u00f6resund with the cooling water from the nuclear power plant barseb\u00e4ck , but you made us shut it down . 
  it 's not true . 
  the law has nothing to do with immigration . 
  it basically makes it easier for people who have been on the receiving end of online bullying to push charges and go to court . 
  we have had a pretty recent case with teenage girls who have been harassed on instagram and facebook , just to name one , and they are increasingly common . 
  the law is just adapting to the times . 
  this is a load of bullshit . 
  there is no such law being passed . 
  the law that * is * actually being passed makes it easier for people to file charges for slander/defamation , source ( in swedish ) : http://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-lagar/utskottens-dokument/betankanden/arenden/201314/ku17/ it literally has nothing to do with immigration . 
  the purpose of the law is to extend the rights for people who have been subject to online bullying .
