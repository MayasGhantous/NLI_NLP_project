  i still disagree with the rest though . 
  the facts and information they dig up , are not affected by any connection they may have to anyone else , or what someone has done in their teens . 
  its not relevant . 
  what ? 
  you can not do research on right wing extremism without also doing research on all other types of politics , or else you are not trustworthy ? 
  that makes no sense . 
  and this rhetoric is used against every group that researches right wing extremism , racism and no-nazis . 
  it seems the only way of not being `` biased '' is pretending it does n't exist . 
  i am not lying . 
  this is what you said :  uhh some places in sweden the cops need to take two cop cars . 
  one unit to guard the cars while the other unit responds to the emergency . 
  since if they leave their cars without anyone guarding it it will get destroyed  then we got the same area throwing stones and sometimes molotov cocktails against the cops ( cocktails only against cops ) & ambulance and firefighters . 
  you did not say `` it has happened in rare occasions '' . 
  you made it sound like there are areas where this happens . 
  are you kidding ? 
  i 'm not the anti-swedish one , spreading false rumors and myths about sweden . 
  some people want researchgruppen to be `` criminal '' and `` left wing extreme '' so they can dismiss their research into right wing extreme groups . 
  the source used is not surprisingly a right sing extreme propaganda site , incredibly dishonest and untrustworthy . 
  most media in sweden is right wing . 
  https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/lista_%c3%b6ver_svenska_tidningar_ordnade_efter_ideologi the right wing in sweden always plays underdog , so they claim everything is `` left wing '' , as long as its not right wing . 
  even neutral media . 
  just like op does . 
  its more a way of racist to avoid any critizism . 
  that is why it became so popular over in r/sweden . 
  no matter how racist a comment , anyone pointing it out will be mocked for not falling in line : `` oh so you think he is a death-drug-nazi-monster lol ''  yellow journalism no , yellow journalism is the opposite of that . 
  swedish media often gets criticized for * not * being yellow journalism , something that the racist wants it to be . 
  pure information about racist groups is not yellow journalism , but the sensationalism that sd wants is . 
  the source for this claim is a right wing extreme propaganda site . 
  its simply not true . 
  notice those pointing this out gets downvoted . 
   and sometimes molotov cocktails the police has said this is just a myth . 
  edit really ? 
  even this gets downvotes ? 
  the police is lying now ? 
  is there no myth about sweden we are not allowed to debunk ? 
  but this is what you said :  why ca n't the swedes keep their culture and way of life within swedish borders ? 
   this is about sweden meddling in other nations affairs officially this is clearly not the case . 
  its / r/europe being as anti-swedish as ever . 
  and is the uk immune from criticism ? 
  why does / r/europe gets so rabid every time its connected to sweden ? 
  that is what is interesting here . 
  from this thread , it looks like ukpolitics is just another racist propaganda sub . 
  https://np.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/3hy8vo/sweden_critical_of_uk_policy_on_calais_migrants/ they openly lie and smear sweden to spread racist propaganda . 
  the commentators are batshit , tin foil mad hatters . 
  but maybe its just that one thread ? 
  look at the rest of the thread . 
  you are not fooling anyone . 
  we all know how / r/europe looks these days . 
  look at what is upvoted . 
  no , not really . 
  the biggest change is how it looks online . 
  racists online have really targeted sweden the last year . 
  because they outnumber non-racist swedes its difficult to get the facts out . 
  there are subs with thousands of members focusing on spread racist myths about sweden , to the rest of reddit . 
  its getting less and less common to see threads that is not just racist propaganda on worldnews or / r/europe . 
  how they use upvotes and downvotes makes it close to impossible to get the word out . 
   they use right wing exteme sources , spreads racist propaganda , and lies to scare people , and downvote facts . 
  if you do this then you are racist . 
  if '' * everyone * '' were to do that , then they would be all racist . 
  there is no other reason to do it . 
  if / r/europe keeps rewarding racists and right wing extremists with upvotes , and downvoting facts and information , then its difficult to deny . 
  https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3hty3a/antiimmigrant_sweden_democrats_now_the_biggest/ https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3hn6j5/antiimmigration_party_swedish_democrats_biggest/ these are only two resent threads about sweden , of many that look the same . 
  anger , lies , racist conspiracy theories , right wing extreme propaganda . 
  everything else gets mostly downvoted . 
  there is a reason people who spread racist conspiracy theories and right wing extreme propaganda gets called racist . 
  very good reason . 
   how about we just stop labeling any dissenting opinion as `` racist '' ? 
  because they keep proving that they are racist . 
  they use right wing exteme sources , spreads racist propaganda , and lies to scare people , and downvote facts . 
  non-racist would not do that . 
  there is a clear agenda . 
  every thread about sweden is raided by right wing extremists lying through their teeth . 
   honestly , the source seems extremely keen on slandering the svt-chief and researchgruppen for no other reason than they exposed high-up sd-politicians for posting bigoted and racist comments online . 
  this is almost every thread about sweden on reddit . 
  everyone must be attacked for not being right wing extreme , supporting sd , or having written something about racism . 
  it very frustrating to watch this take control over most forums . 
  glad to see some people realize this . 
  gets so used to just getting insults for correcting a myth or fact checking claims about swedish politics . 
   our media is mostly biased and left leaning do you have a source for that ? 
  because we hear that a lot , but there is not sign of it . 
  on the other hand : https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/lista_%c3%b6ver_svenska_tidningar_ordnade_efter_ideologi this shows almost all media in sweden , apart from neutral svt , is right wing . 
  the reason svt gets called `` left '' is because its not as right wing as the rest . 
  neutral is to much `` left '' for the right wing . 
  the source he uses is a right wing extreme propaganda site . 
  its nonsense . 
  she gave the prize to researchgruppen ; which are neither criminal or `` left wing extreme '' . 
  they have done research on right wing extremists , and if you do that you are always labeled `` left wing extreme '' . 
  the only thing that is scary here , is how right wing extremists on reddit keep managing to trick non-swedes on what happens in sweden . 
  its every thread that mentions sweden now . 
  neutral media in sweden is neutral . 
  right wingers want to play underdog , so they complain about everything that is not right wing , including neutral media . 
  the `` study '' that claimed most on svt are v or mp has been heavily criticized since it has nothing to do with political journalists , and those journalists say they would never answer such a poll . 
  when ever someone turns out to be left and works for svt they make a big deal about it , but we know there are right wingers on svt , who also right for right wing papers . 
  for some reason no one complains about that ... 
  are you just joking , or are you as butthurt as the rest of r/europe ? 
  can not always tell who is serious any more . 
  why cant the right wing extremist on / r/europe stop lying about sweden then ? 
  we are not the naive ones , blindly believing right wing extreme propaganda about sweden . 
  you are not following the racist narrative . 
  downvotes !,
