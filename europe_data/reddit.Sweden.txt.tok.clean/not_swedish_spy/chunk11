  what color is the sky in your world ? 
  this thread is like all other threads about sweden on r/europe . 
  conspiracy theorists and right wing extremists . 
  love how you all prove how right i am . 
  which is ironic , since sweden treating them as equals lead to dislike of sweden on r/europe , and has sweden described like you do . 
   ikolla is a professional victim no , that would clearly be you . 
  we also have this : http://www.dn.se/nyheter/politik/sifo-rodgrona-ater-storre-an-alliansen/ they are not the biggest , they are 3rd biggest . 
  these news are not allowed though . 
  heavily downvoted . 
  pathetic how people go on about `` democracy in work '' . 
  racist can manipulate and scream and silence people as much as they want , but disagree with them and its `` anti-democratic '' . 
  oh and by the way http://www.dn.se/nyheter/politik/sifo-rodgrona-ater-storre-an-alliansen/ sd is 3rd biggest at 18 % . 
  s 26 % , m 24 % . 
  wow , all that for david hasselhoff !, 
  getting pretty tired of all this bullshit . 
  there was nothing reasonable about your comment . 
  grow up . 
   do you not even know how stupid you sound ? 
  this makes no sense what so ever . 
   that does n't make me racist , rightwinger or dishonest . 
  so why are you atatcking those that dare to talk about the problems with racism ? 
  r/europe is pretty extreme , so why defend it ? 
  why do you defend the racist bubble , but accuse me of being in one ? 
  that is higly suspect , no ? 
  what is then your agenda , if not racism ? 
  because if it was purely anti-immigration , there is no need for those tricks . 
  everything about this screams of / r/europe moving towards r/european . 
  more racist propaganda , more lies . 
  threads about sweden will be even more dishonest . 
  very bad news . 
   he does n't even hide it . 
  neither do you right wing extremists . 
  bjarkebjarke often shows that he is nothing but a right wing extremists . 
  that he always gets upvotes for it speaks volumes about what is going on here . 
  they are just ding their thing as usual . 
  how old are you people ? 
  you sound like you still in middle school . 
  no wonder the immigrant threads look like they do , with right wing extremists like you dumbing it down . 
   i 'm not even a rightwinger or racist . 
  heheh , no , no at all ... you just had to force it , and try to insult me for no reason what so ever . 
  no reason at all . 
  several childish comments in response to this . 
  like you all know just how right i am . 
  fuck this justification of the misuse of downvotes . 
  these threads are patetic . 
  unless you are aggressively anti-immigration , racsit or right wing extreme then you get downvotes . 
  there is a reason there were a need to put them in mega-threads . 
  and we see it now again , as they take over the forum . 
  if you bring facts into it , or just being rational , then just downvotes . 
  um , you understand that the point of affirmative action is to improve a situation and work against discrimination , not the other way around ? 
  ( facepalm ) r/europe please . 
  about the `` relaxing the moderation '' , i cant help but worry that these changes will move / r/europe more towards r/european . 
  for example , threads about sweden are almost always filled with racist propaganda and turns into a political platform for a racist party . 
  if mods do n't control the subs , then racists will .

  and why is europeanguardian so popular , if they are not racists ? 
  http://www.europeanguardian.com/78-uncategorised/europe/604-danish-politicians-mock-sweden-s-introduction-of-dark-plasters they just like racist propaganda and lies for no reason ? 
  https://sv.reddit.com/r/european/comments/3h9uzq/after_an_increase_in_police_resources_along_with/ well ? 
  its 99 % . 
  stop playing stupid . 
  anti-immigration people do n't want to `` talk '' . 
  they just scream about censorship or `` we are we not allowed to talk '' when someone do n't agree with them . 
  they have have made any debate in sweden impossible , with their hatred of anything non-racism . 
  they spend more time attacking non-racists for talking about racism , then they do about immigration . 
  there is an picture of him eating his food in front of his hitler altar . 
  he has arranged his meatballs as a swastika . 
  there was a right wing extremists found with 500kg of dynamite in sweden , and he said he `` could be bigger then breivik '' . 
  i do n't think i need to point out what sweden-threads always looks like . 
  they often raid sweden-threads , together with / r/swedenyes . 
  they seem to actually fool / r/europe quite often . 
  and the whole `` sweden is racist and opressive '' speech never happened . 
  once again imagined by the politically incorrect and paranoid . 
   edit : oh look , you deleted your comment . 
  real brave . 
  sigh ... no , the mods removed the entire thread because of the racist hivemind . 
  is it because danes are so obsessed with screaming about `` pc !! '', 
  that you make shit up ? 
  no one was called racist . 
  once again this is just danes going crazy over nothing . 
  `` a debate started , but in denmark not sweden . 
  danish media reported on a claimed debate in sweden , where `` plasters where accused of racism '' . '', 
   it seems like everything in sweden has to be so pc , and honestly , it 's sickening to look at . 
  you people are like a sect . 
  conspiracy theorists that just imagine things that are not there , so you can scream `` pc !!! '' . 
  danes are obsessed with it . 
  you realize that its denmark being sensitive and naive right ? 
  there was no debate in sweden , no one was called racist , its just in danish media , doing their thing as usual . 
  yes , it looked like whiterights or / r/european raided . 
  just racist conspiracy theories and propaganda . 
   please stop fixating on the colour of their skin , you seem to be obsessed . 
  really ? 
  those retorical tricks are older then the internet . 
  who are you trying to fool ? 
  if you know so much about scandinavia , you should know by now that dansih media often makes shit up about sweden . 
  the only story here is that their fm was naive enough to believe a false story that originally came from a right wing extreme blog , and then spread to danish media . 
  yeah danish media is very much fox news . 
  they have their spin on everything about sweden .
