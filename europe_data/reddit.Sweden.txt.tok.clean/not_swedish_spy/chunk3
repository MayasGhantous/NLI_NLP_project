   going out and trying to tell others ( finns ) how to think about things is plain silly . 
  sooo ... what about all these threads about telling swedes what to do then ? 
   i hope they did n't called them racists or xenophobes out of the blue . 
  if they do , they will probably have a good reason . 
  and the others will then pretend racism doesnt exist . 
  that is not what she says . 
  she says she disagrees with those that claim we are `` full '' . 
  if `` sensible '' means overreacting to sensationalism . 
  looks like they give plenty of shits . 
  they built a human wall to stop a some refugees . 
  did thee circlejerk make you all forget what the post is about ? 
  looks like / r/europe already did that , but the other way around , as usual . 
  we are only allowed to have an opinion if we agree with you then ? 
  um , some have family members in finland . 
  but nice try . 
  r/europe is delusional about sweden as usual . 
  that is tino though . 
  they sound like r/sweden . 
  racism doesnt exist , except for anti-white racism , that is the only real one . 
  if you think racism against black people or immigrants exist , you are racist against `` real swedes '' . 
  yeah , its a dumb place . 
  me neither . 
  he is one of few that brings sanity to all the `` sweden is taken over by muslim monster-mutants '' - threads . 
   it 's merely a very small , yet powerful minority um , no . 
   sd are pretty damn normal . 
  dont get your worldview from comments on reddit or avpixlat . 
  since no one in here noticed , the social democrats grew with the same amount . 
  and this is the party that calls everything `` undemocratic '' when other parties do n't want anything to do with them . 
  but they ditch their youth party because they did n't like how they voted ? 
  and it was the sd top that did it , without any voting on the issue . 
  giving a good taste of what sd is like with some power . 
  you vote for one of the serious parties with real solutions without a racist agenda . 
  people leave the party because they turn out to be even more racist behind closed doors , then they first thought . 
  one of the high ups called it a `` racist sect '' . 
   sd which are close to normal . 
  wow ... / r/europe are really creepy these days . 
  the social democrats also grew by 1,4 no one here seem to notice . 
  what weak fucking culture dies from a few immigrants and refugees ? 
  we have been taking in immigrants and refugees in large numbers before , and its been fine then to . 
  just because we have idiots in sweden , you dont have to repeat it . 
  and here we go . 
  even in this thread we get the alarmists . 
  no , sorry , i did not mean you personally . 
  it was many downvotes from many other redditors . 
   `` we must not implement sensible immigration policies because it will only encourage our conservative nationalists . '', 
  nothing but a straw man, 
  like barismancoismydad said  this clip shows a very minor brawl and police separating the two sides in a very effective manner . 
  these kinds of incidents happen each time there is a football derby aswell no need to overreact . 
  dont worry , it will mostly be straw men . 
  i remember those foreign journalists that came here and took a look at the swedish `` ghettos '' . 
  they thought they had gone to the wrong place , they did n't realize that they were in the `` ghetto '' . 
  the only thing i can find is an online survey were they got 9 % , and sds supporters are known for linking to online survey and telling their followers to vote . 
  that nationalistic parties `` have always had a very high share of the gay vote '' makes no sense . 
  im going to repost this every time you people spam downvotes . 
  this is the type of shit that needs fact checking . 
   what is perhaps most ironic to me is that the nationalist parties have always had a very high share of the gay vote in sweden . 
  for those that dont know , sd is out by far most homophobic party . 
  but racism exists in all parts of society . 
   before sd were mainstream they were at 15-20 % in informal surveys among gay readers of magazines/websites etc. 
  source ? 
  the only thing i can find is an online survey were they got 9 % , and sd supporters online often link to those and tell their followers to vote . 
   the nationalist parties have always had a very high share of the gay vote do you have any source for this ? 
  [ the view from my window ] ( http://i.imgur.com/w5v6fzy.jpg ) keep telling the truth r/europe, 
   this clip shows a very minor brawl and police separating the two sides in a very effective manner . 
  these kinds of incidents happen each time there is a football derby aswell exactly . 
  people in here make it sound like ww3 . 
  would not surprise me if most here did n't even watch it , they just went straight to circlejerking . 
  so , less violent than football supporters ? 
   but criticism of it is silenced because `` racism '' . 
  this is racists propaganda :  watching sweden self implode because of its own white savior complex is both sad and hilarious at the same time . 
  outside of reddit that is . 
  in here anything goes . 
  slappymcnutface makes more sense then most here , yet gets downvoted :  you are n't going to lose your secularism , for fucks sake . 
  germany is taking in the most refugees ( 800,000 ) and even that is only 1 % of their population . 
      do you really believe that 1 % is going to dictate the culture for the other 99 % ? 
      you guys are so afraid and full of shit it would almost be funny if it was n't fueled by such hate . 
   we are n't racists or xenophobes yet you spend a lot of time spreading racist and alarmist myths . 
  yeah , i have been keeping track of what the racist subs make up about sweden , so my youtube is now half-full of racists and white supremacists `` telling the truth about sweden '' . 
  democracy means the majority rules . 
  13 % is not majority . 
  i have never ever heard so many people over and over again claim that its `` undemocratic '' to not agree with 13 % . 
  imagine if it was the other way around , that the racists had 87 % , would reddit then say its undemocratic to do what the 13 % non-racist want ? 
  i think not . 
  then why are you also playing along in the racist narrative about sweden ? 
  what is your agenda there , if not a racist one ? 
   their displaced spines . 
  you mean because we are not afraid of immigrants and refugees ? 
  try harder, 
   do i need to keep linking ? 
      https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3kqzks/swedens_ugly_immigration_problem/cuzw1ua, 
  its difficult to prove my point if you keep spamming downvotes , hiding away the comments , but i guess that proved my point in a way . 
   https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3kqzks/swedens_ugly_immigration_problem/cuzut50     shit like this gets upvoted , compare to what gets downvoted below that :     https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3kqzks/swedens_ugly_immigration_problem/cuzwg9b, 
  im repeating because of the downvotes being spammed :  what integration improval attempts are happening in sweden ? 
  i 'm genuinely curious . 
  helping immigrants learn swedish quicker , helping them into the workplace , school , updating already existing degrees , and so on . 
   and how do you know sd is spreading xenophobia rather than expressing already existing xenophobic sentiments ? 
  one point of right wing populism ( of the racist kind ) is manipulating people into thinking what the racist wants is what is good for the people . 
  the more sd controls the debate , the more scared people get . 
  maybe you can move to reddit . 
  he also had a tattoo that said `` death to kings '',
