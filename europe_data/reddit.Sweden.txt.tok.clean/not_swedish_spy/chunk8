  then why is racist propaganda the only thing that is allowed ? 
  why are sensible comment downvoted https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3k7pbx/swedish_newspaper_metro_today_welcome_to_sweden/cuveo46 and racist propaganda upvoted ?

  he embraces everything this sub stands for !, 
  its beautiful . 
  * patriotic tears * not like those evil brainwashed swedes !, 
  wow ... https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3k7pbx/swedish_newspaper_metro_today_welcome_to_sweden/cuvgrjv, 
  i would add the dane spitting on refugees as a [ hero europe deserves . 
  this is your comment . 
   in sweden currently . 
  yesterday i saw a ** propaganda piece ** on the ** fucking children 's channel ** ( barnkanalen i think it 's called ? ), 
  with a ** creepy cartoon explaining ** how we need welcome refugees . 
  if any swedish redditors know what it 's called then feel free to name . 
  its like taken directly from whiterights or european . 
  just like the rest of this racist thread . 
  every thread about sweden . 
  unless you hate immigrants and refugees as much as the racists its `` propaganada '' and `` brainwashing the kids '' . 
  help us european brain bad ughhg blark, 
  that sounds horrible !!, 
  the cartoons have a nice message ? 
  how could they !, 
  the propaganda !, 
  its like stalin runs the country !, 
  help us r/euorpean !, 
  yeah they are so silent ... like 5 year olds in a supermarket . 
   immediately turned around as racist opinions . 
  if you lie about immigrants to scare people and spread racist conspiracy theories , there is no way you are not a racist . 
  yeah we have never seen any positive message in american kids show right ? 
  these threads are pathetic . 
  having a meeting without sd ? 
  in what fascist hellhole would that be illegal ? 
   pretend like the problem does n't exist . 
  they are ** literally ** meeting to talk about solving problems and handling the situation . 
  they have ** never ** `` pretended it does n't exists '' . 
  how in the world can you people keep this myth alive ? 
   it feels like some type of mass-paranoid psychosis is going on . 
  it really is . 
  the rest of reddit are laughing at sect-like organizations like the westboro baptist church or scientologists , but this racist party and their fanatical following is no laughing matter apparently . 
  the top of / r/europe is now a post about sd not invited to a meeting . 
  what other party gets that attention ? 
  im going to the bathroom now . 
  is it ok if i go alone , or do i have to invite sd to watch ? 
  real democracy where no one is forced to agree with right wing extremists ? 
  and can work together with those they agree with ? 
  where people are free to have meetings with whomever they like ? 
  cool . 
  keep hating r/europe . 
  or go look up the word `` democracy '' , you might learn something . 
  ^  to so violently silence a party will just cause more people to flock to their banner . 
  and yougov had fi at 18 % , but they got less then 2 % . 
  i seem to be older then most here . 
  i remember them in the 80s and 90s . 
  most importandly im not ignorant of them today . 
  you know those leaving the party describes it as a `` racist sect '' right ? 
  its not a debate , its a meeting . 
  are you all trolling me ? 
  its not a debate . 
  its a meeting . 
  between x amount of parties . 
  like a lot of other meetings . 
  the only reason they manage to spread myths about `` undemocratic '' bullshit , is because no one here cares what it actually is . 
  chirst ... 
  this is a meeting between parties with similar opinions on what they think is best . 
  just like any other meeting between parties with similar policies . 
  no one calls it undemocratic then . 
  and / europe certainly do n't give a shit then . 
  i have seen these threads before . 
  many of them . 
  if its sd we have to do what they want or its `` undemocratic '' according to / europe . 
  for some reason parties that disagree with them can not talk to each other about better solutions . 
  it makes no sense , but that is the narrative . 
  you think every party is part of every talk ? 
  the right wing block do n't invite the left to all their talks . 
  why would they ? 
  where is the outcry then ? 
  so the right wingers should ban nuclear power plants since the greens want that ? 
  and what about the 6-hour workday that the left want in the public sector ? 
  wow , the right wing is not going to like this . 
  sd is comparable with the worldview of earlier more racist generations , in the 20s ? 
  got it . 
  real democracy where no one is forced to agree with right wing extremists ? 
  and can work together with those they agree with ? 
  cool . 
  apparently , since we all have to do what sd wants , no matter what the majority wants . 
  or / r/europe gets sad :(, 
  yeah totally unlike sds scare propaganda that they spam everywhere . 
  * those * heavily biased poll are perfectly fine . 
  and one more thing . 
  since / europe loves democracy so much , i am sure you will respect the majority of swedes being positive to welcoming refugees , and that the percentage of swedes being positive is growing . 
  and that the percentage that want less refugees * is decreasing * . 
  right ? 
  edit if this comment also gets hidden away , i will repeat it , so at least some will have a chance at learning something about sweden for once . 
  these propaganda threads are usually about tricking people . 
  i 'm getting pretty fucking tired of right wing populist and racist hiding away facts and information that you do n't want to be seen . 
  its taking over the entire sub . 
  of course !, 
  the know all about ironpipes and if jews can be swedish !, 
  meanwhile in the real world : `` swedes gets more positive to help refugees '' http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/sifo-svenskarna-mer-positiva-till-flyktingar/, 
  does anyone in this sub know what democracy means ? 
  anyone ?
