  parties that have similar stance are having a meeting . 
  a meeting between x amount of parties . 
  like a lot of meetings . 
  edit i checked and , once again , this has also been linked to / european as well . 
  that explains why this thread look like it does . 
  what the hell are you talking about ? 
  this makes no sense at all !, 
  in what world do is it against democracy to invite some politicians for a talk , but not others that you know are not interested anyway ? 
  what the hell is wrong with r/europe ? 
  every fucking time with sd not being part of something or are offended / r/europe becomes experts on swedish politics all of a sudden . 
  should we rename this sub / r/sd or something ? 
  i did n't hear you complain when right wing parties had had talks without the left . 
  and why would they invite sd ? 
  they will , as always , not contribute in any way . 
  or is it that * a lot * of redditors have an agenda , and someone has to uphold the rules of the forum ... 
  yeah , `` liberals '' in sweden often sound like they watch fox news . 
  borrowing the top comment . 
  this is the full 9 min interview .

  and it should open a medium sized window .

  of course they get more criticism . 
  they are the most extreme and dangerous thing we have had in power . 
  yes . 
  right wing extreme . 
  vonsnoe gave the right answer , which on this populist and racist sub means downvotes . 
   eh , no they wouldnt . 
  they would still be far right since they are more or less a mix of neo-facists , hardcore conservatives , christian fundamentalist and nationalist . 
  that a sub like / r/europe has started to promote and defend a racists party in such a sect-like fashion is more then a little creepy . 
  this rhetoric of giving sd immunity from criticism , or not allowing a correct description of them , is pathetic . 
  they are all those things vonsnoe said , and we will not stick our heads in the sand , no matter how much you people spam that crap . 
  / europe looks like a sect , in how defensive you are of a racist party . 
  for those that really do n't know what sd is built on , read up on them . 
  r/europe has a way of trying to ignore the nazi background . 
  often by playing stupid . 
  do you really not understand what that actually means ? 
  they are ruining the internet . 
  most ironic comment in the thread . 
  whats wrong r/europe ? 
  i thought you would be happy that we are sending back someone that needs help . 
  i hope i 'm not the only one that sees the hypocrisy in / r/europe ... 
  wait i thought / europe had decided that immigrants were destroying swedish culture , but now it turns out there was no culture to begin with ? 
  this is so confusing !, 
  the same as the one linked earlier . 
  `` the ideological orientation that is best placed to contribute to the creation and maintenance of a good society is a social conservatism of clear nationalistic basis . '', 
  so you already forgot this post ? 
  well they get all the upvotes it seems . 
  helmut is at 50 now . 
  you mean straw man . 
  calling saudi arabia out on their bullshit is `` feminist '' ? 
  while everyone else kept their mouths shut ? 
  you anti-feminist are getting more desperate by the day . 
  lets play `` r/europe or r/whiterights '' !, 
  and i think r/europe is getting fanatical . 
  no more fermented herring for you . 
  it was the flag right ? 
  i would have gotten away with it otherwise . 
   idiot foreign minister decided to start an argument with the saudis one of the few with balls enough to call the saudis out on their bullshit . 
   it is sad to see so many british redditors ( but not all luckly ) on here that are anti-immigration . 
  not only that but they are aggressively going after anyone that does n't follow that narrative . 
  downvotes and everything . 
  you were right . 
  cut the bullshit . 
  britain is a member of eu , that means they are part of the debate . 
  they do n't have immunity in this just because of certain political leanings on internet-forums . 
  yeah , / europe knows alright . 
  you all `` know '' . 
  all the racist blogs have informed you well . 
  found the sweden democrat ... 
   looks like he spoke to the torygraph directly , so it is either his shitty but subjectively excellent command of the language , or his ** typical swedish na\u00efvet\u00e9 about how global affairs work ** . 
  likely both . 
  this one is my favorite . 
  r/europe is working hard at insulting everyone that does n't follow the narrative . 
  guys guys , calm down !, 
  you are all swedish . 
  you win this round italy . 
  as a prize , here is a swedish song about italian food . 
   and yougov had fi at 18 % , when they got less then 2 % . 
  yup . 
  swedeyes , coontown , r/european , have an obsession about spreading racist propaganda about sweden . 
  most europeans do n't really care about sweden , so its easy for the extremists to control those threads . 
  exactly . 
  different polls show different things . 
  my point is / r/europe has picked one after their own biased , and ignores all other polls . 
  and its also known that sds supporters organize themselves online like no other , and brigade polls . 
  so the way / r/europe decides to go with what they * want * to believe makes no sense . 
   downvoting people using personal attacks and calling everybody who disagree racist is a perfectly valid response . 
  why is it that every time right wing extremists and racist raid a thread , this excuse comes up ? 
  you know i can see the comments right ? 
  i 'm not saying right wing extremism or racism for no reason . 
   use arguments instead . 
  i do . 
  downvotes are used to silence redditors that do n't follow the right wing extreme narrative . 
  https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3hyfgx/sweden_critical_of_uk_policy_on_calais_migrants/cuc35gc this comment i responded to . 
  people that do n't use arguments , but only right wing extreme propaganda gets upvoted all the time . 
   until rg has done research on the left wing extremist ( or any other political party ) i do n't consider them unbiased this is what i reacted to .
