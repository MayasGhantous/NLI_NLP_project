edgy, 
  yeah , i really do n't get why this would be newsworthy for europeans . 
  i 'm sure every country has people doing stupid shit like this . 
  right , forgot about that . 
  that 's ^ just ^ ^ batshit ^ ^ ^ retarded, 
  do you mean [ this ] ( https://jeablom.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/aa.jpg ) guy ? 
  if so , that 's wrong . 
  he got invited to his former school by the principal to inspire the kids because he 's some sort of athlete . 
  he then took a short jog with the children and had that picture snapped . 
  then the daily mail reported on it as him winning some sort of race while posing as a 14-year old . 
  my apologies if that 's not who you mean but i see this picture now and then and people believe that swedes are batshit retarded for `` letting that happen '' . 
  i 'm sure there are other true cases though , where the age does n't fit . 
  at the end of may the government is going to tighten the requirement for `` relative immigration '' making sweden one of the countries in europe with the strictest immigration law . 
  there are id checks at the borders which would 've been unheard of a couple of months ago . 
  they 're planning to send 80 000 migrants back , which to be fair is a lot easier said than done , but it 's still said . 
  as for the general populace there has always been a healthier view on immigration than what you might read in the papers or hear from politicians . 
  i disagree . 
  nah , we just do n't care about you and your shitty story . 
  yes , so that makes the title pretty misleading . 
  that 's weird because just a couple hours ago the police released [ this ] ( https://polisen.se/aktuellt/handelser/halland/2016-03-07-1740-misshandel-grov-kungsbacka/ ) statement on an assault against a girl . 
  translation : `` three men , ca 25 years old , two of them with defined stubble , clothed with `` big jackets '' . 
  all of them with foreign origin according to the victim . '', 
  i 've always wanted to go skiing on europa , i wonder if there are any good spots ? 
  yeah , it should be easier to detect a sub during exercises . 
   because out of 118 oil producing countries in 2014 , norway ranks 15th on oil production . 
  which does n't really say much . 
  the top 6 oil producing countries combined produce more than the other 112 countries . 
  it 's better to look at norways ' % produced of worldwide production . 
  but then again , if you factor in per capita they 'd be up at the top although i doubt counting per capita makes much sense . 
  that 's the dumbest shit i 've read all day . 
  `` good '' that they lose tourism money/jobs or `` good '' that there are terror attacks ? 
  ah okay , no worries . 
  you could do that bit other kids will probably think your kid is a bit weird if it brings its own food . 
  or they 'll get jelous that they ca n't have chicken , idk . 
  why ca n't your kid eat vegetarian 1 day a week though ? 
  let me get this comment out of the way . 
  sweden is : ruined/collapsing/literally in civil war swedes are : islamists/feminists/nazis i hope swedes : suffer/die/come to their senses sweden should : deport everyone/take everyone/fuck off, 
  but why ? 
  i honestly did n't think i had to put / s in my post . 
  obviously portugal is n't `` lost '' in any sense of the word . 
  in fact , it 's a lovely country . 
  and so is sweden . 
  the fact that op thinks we are `` lost '' because of bad immigrants is frankly absurd . 
  it 's a problem for sure , but other countries have much bigger problems and somehow they are n't lost . 
  weird , huh ? 
  i have no idea why you replied to me with this . 
  and i think portugal is lost because you 're all poor farmers living on scraps , right ? 
   sweden a little too self-worshiping and smug as always . 
  even though we 're the best nordic country , there 's still room in our butts for you denmark . 
  yeah man , fuck you and your skin color , whatever it may be !, 
  https://np.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/60jut9/nigel_farage_investigated_by_ofcom_after_rape/df7i6i8/ that dude explains things pretty well . 
  have a read if you 're interested . 
  albania is pretty nice though ... ^ ^ just ^ ^ sayin ', 
  thank you , so we can agree it 's not a no-go area then . 
  i do n't get how what i wrote is mental acrobatics ? 
  i think you should re-read this comment chain in detail and maybe you 'll grasp what it 's about this time . 
  and i disagree that it 's a `` no-go zone '' since the meaning of that label is per definition : '' ... a group of people who have weapons prevent the police , army , and other people from entering '' . 
  that 's not the case though ? 
  the riots started * because * the police entered and arrested someone , not because they * tried * to enter . 
  and that 's why it 's retarded to argue over this phrase since it always turns into this shitfest , instead of discussing the real problems/solutions . 
  why are people always jerking of to the words `` no-go zone '' ? 
  does it really matter what it 's called ? 
  it 's an area with a lot of problems mostly due to bad integration . 
  discuss the solutions instead of getting hung up on that stupid phrase . 
  can everyone please leave us the fuck alone . 
  as a scandinavian i ca n't take all this attention !, 
  god . 
  we never had a chance ... 
   44 % of immigrant students struggle at school . 
  total immigrants or immigrants from mena countries ? 
  again , would need some source or this debate is rather pointless . 
   64 % of swedes think that the media is being censored this i would have totally agreed with 1 year or so ago . 
  today , in my opinion , the news are more nuanced . 
   so we do have huge problems with having such a huge minority . 
  i see , that may very well be the case then . 
  you know your country better than i do . 
  and i agree , our problems are different . 
  i do n't see how my country will fall into chaos because a fraction of our population do bad in school at the moment or because we have ghettos . 
  those are , unfortunately , part of almost every society . 
  but do n't take this the wrong way . 
  i 'd gladly see a total stop for taking in refugees for a couple of years to sort our problems . 
   i genuinely do n't see sweden is coming back from this . 
  soon you will be broke and flung into chaos . 
  well , i think that 's a bit ridiculous . 
  we certainly have problems and i agree we need to cut immigration . 
  but we do n't have more problems than the rest of europe . 
  you guys have 30 % of your population with foreign background but i ca n't imagine you feel that estonia `` will be flung into chaos '' ? 
  edit : also , i 'd appreciate a source for the 600 000 + muslim statistic . 
  the * absolute * highest number i could find was 400 000 , but most of them predicted around 100 000 - 120 000 . 
  [ source ( in swedish ) ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_i_sverige ), 
  damn brits ruined britsland . 
  why ? 
  lol, 
  i guess it 's working though since our economy is doing very well whilst yours is shit , : shrug :, 
  yes , obviously . 
  have you seen western birth rates ? 
  do n't be a twat, 
  i also got one , totally forgot i signed up though . 
  what a nice little surprise . 
  surrounded by pussy - i 'll take it,
