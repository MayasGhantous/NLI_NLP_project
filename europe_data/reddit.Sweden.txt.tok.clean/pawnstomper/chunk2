   swedish ( as much as it pains me to say , it could be handy to know a bit more swedish ) it 's really easy : hej . 
  ( hello . ), 
  ( good bye ! ), 
  i speak swedish , english , danish and ( a very tiny amount of ) german . 
  if i had to choose another language i 'd go with spanish . 
  there are quite a lot of cool places where they speak spanish . 
  french is also like that . 
  but , you know , it 's french . 
  l\u00e5neord : ( bi ) cycle .

  maybe because it does n't generally count loan words ? 
  it 's also hard , because a world like `` vischan '' will screw with the map . 
  old spelling is visjan . 
  but then again , i think it comes from romani so might count as a loan word , even if it 's been in the swedish language over a hundred years . 
   crossbows are very accurate nowadays . 
  but not exactly widely used . 
  well it was wierd the first time it happened . 
  now i just expect it . 
  apparently quite a lot of people have no idea what sweden is . 
  * standing around . 
  just looking at the views and shit . 
  a local who happens to be passing stops to say hello . 
  this question always comes up : * `` whe yu fwoam ? '', 
  `` i 'm from sweden . '', 
  i knowah sweheden ! '', 
  `` you do ? 
  cool ! '', 
   * points at wrist * `` watches ! '', 
  `` no . . that 's switzerland . 
  i 'm from sweden ... '' '' ????????? '', 
  or rather did n't !, 
  i have no idea what you said . 
  but sure , have an upvote !, 
  worked for me after a reload or two . 
  edit : try this : http://edlnews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/11057669_10152651909256854_1859559230_n.mp4?_=1, 
  rikssvenska is the new riksnordiska . 
  so is sweden and norway , though . 
  the point of the post you replied to was to say that the map is useless as it is , not to dispute what it 's showing . 
  the whole point of it being useless relies on it showing the nominal price levels . 
  [ we 're catching up to you !, 
  ] ( http://jakubmarian.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/english-eu.jpg ), 
  do n't read the title literally . 
  it could make russia out to be biggest security threat to sweden , all categories . 
  that is not the case . 
  the possible confusing lies in the meaning of the word security . 
  the word * underr\u00e4ttelsehot * is a word in two parts : * underr\u00e4ttelse * which means intelligence , and * hot * which means threat . 
  that means the sentence translates as : the largest intelligence threat { as in from a foreign intelligence service } to sweden last year came from russia . 
  specifically they accuse [ gru ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/main_intelligence_directorate_%28russia%29 ) for their wide spread activities ( stealing , spying and recruiting new spies ) in sweden . 
  tl ; dr ; russia wants swedish technology without having to pay for it . 
  and ireland has seven of these : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pilatus_pc-9 http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/pilatus_pc-9_of_the_irish_air_corp_flying_in_formation_9.jpg, 
  oh good . 
  i was almost worried . 
  it can only be one thing : http://i.imgur.com/q6cscfi.png, 
  yeah . 
  it should be : in soviet russia , travel times you !, 
  because i time travel all the time . 
   what about national parks ? 
  i think you misunderstood the whole point of a national park . 
  they are protected . 
  you ca n't ju go around blowing them up . 
  that would be east sweden . 
   we 'd have to conduct a wide poll to have a proper answer to your question . 
  and i suspect it would be `` i do n't know much about it '' an equivalent poll in sweden would give the result : `` battle of poltava ? 
  oh i heard about that !, 
  who won ? '', 
  i do n't know how relevant this is ... wait ... this is always relevant : http://youtu.be/p5awaw2hea4?t=10s, 
  awww . 
  look how cute it is !, 
  next up is kazakhstan and then we 're off to palau !, 
  shush !, 
  do n't tell the world why the russians never dared go beyond crimea . 
  it always drives me nuts that it 's shooting `` the wrong way '' . 
  yeah i know it does n't have to be that way . 
  but it looks like it does . 
  no he 's not . 
  ikea is worth a shit load , that 's true . 
  but thanks to clever tax evasion he is not quite that rich himself . 
  most of the money is in a fund to supply for his family long into the future . 
  why do n't you undelete your post and read what you actually said in the first place ? 
  if you have a point spit it out . 
  because you just made my point ... 
  i grant you the 47m is not the problem here . 
  it 's the alleged 341m that is the problem , because it has been artificially lowered to avoid taxes . 
  i would find it a lot more probable that they used numbers from very different sources . 
  sweden has had just a little too much and is spending her time telling everyone what great people they could be , if they were just a bit more like sweden . 
  i know this from somewhere ... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qc7hmhrgtuq, 
   its not more efficient than a modern central gas heating system . 
  i have never even heard of a central gas heating system . 
   however the heat produced in an electric power plant would overwise be wasted , so it certainly more efficent than wasting that heat and using the power to create heat again . 
  a swedish central heating plant is typically not producing any electricity . 
  we burn rubbish to produce heat . 
  well there you go . 
  something something royalty . 
  the sentio polls are always coughing up ridiculous results from their online surveys . 
  sifo ( who make actual statistical studies ) published their survey on the 19 : th . 
  sd got 15.8 % . 
  i feel russia is a bit misleading . 
  lithuania can not into south ? 
  it was -15 c and no beer in sight . 
  now you tell me this ?
