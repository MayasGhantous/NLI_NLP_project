  correction , that is what feminism ideally should be about but not necessarily practised in reality . 
  for example gender quotas is something feminists in sweden are pushing yet the way they suggest them to be implemented seems to always assume you deserve to be punished as a man for being a man . 
  and or the assumption that women could not be beneficiaries of a gender corrupt system . 
  so ideally feminism is great , the way it is practised in sweden is debatable though , especially when it is enough to be called a misogynistic bastards by implying you are a egalitarian ( true story ), 
  it doesnt matter , i said `` well in situation b '' and you go `` but situation a is much worse '' , yes , thats why we are talking about situation b and not a , you seriously dont see how what you are saying is irrelevant to what i am saying ? 
  you are not arguing against me , you are off topic . 
  also http://www.orestat.se/sites/all/files/ladda_hem_kapitlet_traffiken_over_oresund.pdf might actually want to check some facts before throwing hyperboles around . 
  yes you are completely right but totally off topic . 
    if the oresund is the only road , are people supposed to use ferries something ? 
   people use ferries still , its cheaper iirc and doesnt take any longer ** depending on where you want to go **, 
   what a pompous asshole , jesus . 
  yes , i am the asshole who assumes everyone lives in malm\u00f6 or helsingborg trying to get to k\u00f6penhamn or back . 
  you are the one that assumes stuff , i just explains that depending on where you want to go , the ferry isnt that bad , for most of swedens population its going to mean 20 minute extra ride . 
  of a 5 + hour journey anyway . 
  stop being so malm\u00f6 centric , it is stupid . 
   doesnt take any longer depending on where you want to go now go back to second grade and practice your reading comprehension . 
  also , 20 minutes longer if you come from anywhere else in sweden , at about the same price . 
  people use ferries still , its cheaper iirc and doesnt take any longer depending on where you want to go, 
  still a person !, 
  a navigator is a person . 
  ok , say we do it like you want , lets uncitizen any terrorist . 
  lets assume you are french and you have a citizenship in whateverland , in 25 years there is a growing dissent about some kind of bullshit i ( i = government ) is passing around , no matter what it is , it is not widespread but there is an active opposition , this opposition typically holds rally , so what do i do ? 
  oh yeah , i start bending the definition of what constitutes an act of terror to include violent demonstrations , i mean its violence to show dissent of a political idea/promoting its own , as in the definition ideology through terror , no problem right ? 
  great , now i go from the other direction , how do i make you a participant of a violent demonstration , i mean you havent raised a hand and make sure not to , you are just a voice of the people , well then lets bend some more , your participation can be seen as promoting violent demonstrations , and/or the inaction against said violence is seen as support of it , i mean you are an inciter why not ? 
  so basically you are a terrorist , off to whateverland with you !, 
  and dissent situation managed . 
  now i am just an armchair-dictator that spent 10 minutes thinking about this shit , imagine someone that really wants you gone that have years upon years and resources to do it with , all with legal tools , because that is where real power , do you think the nazis gained power in one night ? 
  no it was a ramp-up of decades of work with laws edging here and there . 
  what terrifies me is that we are discussing citizenship rights and you think referring to pre wwii politics/climate as `` hyperbole '' makes me scared , have you not thought anything about how laws and rights work ? 
  this is the reason you shouldnt be able to revoke anyones citizenship . 
   uh , ah yes so because we speak about kicking out known terrorists we are litterally pushing innocent people in ovens for their religion by the millions ... / s i have no idea what you mean with the / s because sarcasm doesnt fit into this discussion , on the off chance that you dont know , the holocaust started with the ability to revoke jews citizenship , they became stateless which basically gave them no right and nobody that would help them , this wasnt just 1 law suggestion that enabled it , but a very long process over a decade that started with something similar to this situation . 
  just by opening up something that is so clear , simple and solid as your citizenship rights by making it a complex set of laws is horrifying because each little nuance can get bent and suddenly you can deport dissenters in 25 years or worse . 
  look , you dont seem to get it the problem is that you are france , you decitizen a person that just got decitizen by his second country , lets call that franceb . 
  now you dont care that he doesnt have a citizenship there anymore it is francebs number . 
  you are franceb , what do you do when a stateless terrorist comes knocking on the border ? 
  maybe ... just maybe if you cant think logically on the internet about this tiny tiny little hypothetical problem , then maybe you shouldnt start talking about removing peoples citizenships , you dont seem to be able to think even one step ahead on this issue , there is a reason un wants to remove the capability of making a person stateless , and make it impossible for a state to remove a citizenship ( ** in any situation imaginable ** ) . 
  last time someone made a similar suggestion and it got passed into law into europe the friggin ** holocaust ** happened . 
  and no , that is not a an exaggeration , that is literally the reason you cant just take away someones citizenship . 
  look , you might think it is a great idea at first , but really there is so many problems and loopholes it can open up that you would rather just live with the tiny inconvenience of incarcerating a terrorist indefinitely, 
  ok , let 's say we do it like that . 
  now when he lands in your country what do you do , he does n't have papers to be in the country . 
   country of the other nationality/origin where they lived before ; what if that country is another france ? 
  that removed their citizenship . 
  internationally they would be considered stateless as much as i have triple citizenship , swedish , republic of pbostromia and peoples republic of pbostromia, 
   but it stops there you ca n't say how i live , you ca n't force it on others . 
  see , thats where they disagree with you , and anything you have to say about it doesnt matter to them . 
   never forget that our governments are selling arms to places like uae and saudi arabia iirc there is no weapons exported from sweden capable of subjugating a population  no weapons for you !, 
  i dont know what i would do with a anti-ship robot or a radar station really , if i wanted a semi automatic i could just go get a hunting license and then just buy/import one so i think that is just your country , but you can own and use a http://www.ruger.com/products/1022/ no problems in the uk , if you want bigger pieces of metals flying you need to get a single action rifle . 
  next step is to define what is a terrorist and then you get a puppet state to give out citizenship automatically to dissenting `` terrorists '' , then you can deport anyone you want !, 
  it is when you tell others they have to stand in line , like telling someone you dont recognize his renouncement of citizenship , even though the country in question has recognized it . 
  you basically just erased somebodies rights , with a carte blanche of deciding when and where to do it . 
  lets assume you are a french and dual citizen . 
  lets say you are the opposition of me . 
  now with this law all i had to do was prove that you are a terrorist and whoops , you have to leave france . 
  now you might say `` yes but how would you prove that i am a terrorist '' easy , i petition a law changing the definition of what constitutes an act of terror to something that aligns with what the opposition deals with , say participating in a semi violent demonstration , now i would only have to find a picture of you participating in that demonstration this law proposal is a shitty idea , not because it will punish terrorists , but because it is a tool that can be used against non terrorists . 
  i mean , do i have to really really reference how hitler managed to gain power and manipulate himself through democracy up to absolute power ? 
  really ? 
  have people learned nothing about how that shit all managed to happen ? 
  fascist much ? 
  you cant make a person citizenless , its in the un charters iirc , all hell would break loose, 
  a norbalt currency union would be cool imo, 
  tell that to the war on drugs and the war on emus, 
  i got called a nazi for explaining how a very large gala `` the whole sweden scrambles '' , basically a music/entertainment gala to collect money for refugee crisis , during the hours they ran it they collected less than what it costs in sweden to receive refugees for 20 minutes , it didnt even offset the cost for the duration it was running , and this was a primetime show , with probably a million viewers ( sweden got 9.5 million in population ) she could not imagine that these numbers were real and i must be a nazi for believing this ( until my friend pointed out that i like numbers and such , not hating immigrants ) . 
  right now yes , but at first was it really that sophisticated ? 
  that is a very very very small one . 
  business , its easy to implement a region wide block like the great firewall of china . 
  what if i told you that you could get neither for free !, 
  i mean , it is in the op title , any backdoor is a back door for terrorists is basically what it means . 
  but then again why put all eggs in one basket , we are still talking about english natives only speaking one language while other countries do 2 minimum , some do 3 and some got 4 in progress . 
  why not hedge a little bit . 
  china is growing as a consumer market . 
  because if you arent giving them power they are going to take it anyway , every other company i have worked with is doing business directly to china , it is because china is good business , now imagine half of europe has great business with china , we speak mandarin ( mandarin isnt that uncommon nowadays in my circles ) and you dont , then you are going to get fucked  not even all of china speak mandarin and they are learning english on a massive scale . 
  on paper everyone knows english , in reality it is probably as common for a brit to know french as it is for a chinese to know english when you walk the streets ( ok maybe not as bad , but they are very good at cheating at tests in china ) . 
  it is also the lingua franca of the future in africa , china is investing in african immensely , they invest in southeast asia and they invest in south america , in africa the children are starting to learn mandarin instead of english , because that is where business is . 
  you better start learning mandarin to get ahead of the game in 25 years once china has bought everything . 
  well ... not really or at least they have their oil fund , we have bunch of heavy industry stuff norway doesnt , but back then before they had oil norway was a rural poor-as-fuck fishing society , sweden built jet fighters and had one of the worlds most sophisticated engineering industries , we were the real winners of ww2 economically speaking , norway was skinning fish . 
  over here it is almost pointless with unflavored water , you could just drink it from the tap if you wanted, 
  yeah , that is kind of obvious right now . 
  but this is how i imagine it works , a refugee lands in turkey , they dont like it there because it is a downgrade from their old life ( obviously ) and they are one of millions of refugees , there is this scummy fella that said `` we should all go to europe it is much better ! '', 
  and another fella that sells them the idea that germany and sweden is great and you will get xyz stuff when you get there , then they pay this guy a small fortune to help them get through , meanwhile they get fed with the idea that all other countries are nazis and doesnt want them there but germany and sweden do ! . 
  then when they get to sweden they get told they will get taken care of , lots of good apartment and life opportunities and if they place you in a center or out in the country side they are told to haggle ( which is also what you do normally in every other country but sweden ( we dont haggle ) ) until you get what you want . 
  its easy to see how they can get sold on the idea of paradise and when they get it in their sight they cant imagine living in the shithole of nazis that is denmark ( jk , denmark is nice , but thats what they are probably fed ) . 
  we are also talking about people who lived their whole lives in a bigger city than stockholm , people that would probably be considered upper class in syria or wherever , maybe they were doing management at an engineering firm or whatever , i can imagine if i take all the s\u00f6dermalm ( like brooklyn but more fancy ) desk job hipsters and put them in a ski resort and told them to live there for a while they would go insane , where is the mall ?!, 
  but how do we order food ?!, 
  where is the subway station ?!, 
  ( sidenote i had a person ask me where the subway station was in my town of 10k ) , if you are unprepared then it might be quite awful . 
  tldr : it all depends what kind of information you are fed, 
  i think the problem ( in their mind ) right now is that we dont have housing and tent camps isnt that popular when you have subzero temperatures for 4 months straight . 
  glaciers melt , thats what they do , it would be terrifying if they didnt melt, 
   5 year old should be able to figure out . 
  yes , in a normal voting system , in the system we use in sweden it is the equivelant of agreeing with the majority . 
  the alternative is that it is a vote for anarchy because you vote for nothing as your representation . 
  if you truly cared about the current government is wrong then you can vote for one of the 30 registered parties , or register one yourself . 
  voting against our voting system ( which is what a blank vote is really if you think about it if you want it to be dissenting ) is pointless , might as well just go live in the woods . 
  in anyways it is a counted as a vote for majority , and you need to realize that your blank vote helped the current government to get in power . 
  voting blank is not a dissent vote in sweden , it is mathematically a vote for majority , only a sub 4 % or a minority vote is considered a dissent vote . 
  so you say you didnt vote them in but the result of you voting blank gave the majority a larger share as opposed to if you voted kalle anka partiet or sd . 
  so yeah . . thanks for ruining sweden !, 
  your analogy doesnt work either , they key is not the consumer/supply it is the power situation , the dealer is in a power position in regard to his customer in the same way the client is in a power position to the prostitute . 
  because while sex is addicting , it is quite rare to sell your kidney for it .
