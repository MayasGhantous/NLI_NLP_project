  the developments have been underway in the party for some years by now , and this just happened to be the straw that broke the camel 's back : a few years back the [ socialist people 's party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/socialist_people%27s_party_%28denmark%29 ) decided to actively pursue being part of a government rather than taking its usual role as a supporting party . 
  it would probably have worked out as well , if not the most recent parliamentary election completely demolished the party , leaving it with too few seats in parliament to seriously influence government politics , yet still in the government and thus unable to perform it 's own politics and push its own political agenda to the extent many voters would have hoped for . 
  as a result , the party became highly fractioned into two groups consisting of those that would still prefer the current situation and those who felt that too many compromises have been made . 
  meanwhile , voters have largely left the party to either side of the political spectrum . 
  ultimately , as we see today , the pursuit of being a governmental party did not work out for the socialist party . 
  it 's probably for the better this way ; many of the politicians eager to join government have adapted to [ social democrat ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_democrats_%28denmark%29 ) politics anyway .

  [ here 's a neat ted talk ] ( http://www.ted.com/talks/eli_pariser_beware_online_filter_bubbles.html ) about your parenthesis . 
  for me , personally , it has come to the point where google is no longer as useful for research because it always suggests the same 10 research papers that i 've read the most times , hiding others that might be more relevant . 
  probably sticking to any one search engine is problematic , but there 's plenty of alternatives . 
  if you like google , [ start page ] ( http://startpage.com ) acts as a decent enough proxy . 
  true , and the whole setup is highly idealized as well ( the earth is n't really spherical , temperature might not behave quite continuously in the mathematical sense of the word , and so on ... ) . 
  yeah , i think i 'm following you ; the more the parameters change the more likely it seems that they 'll end up coinciding at various points . 
  for your question , the mathematics do not really care about the altitude : all that matters is that things vary continuously . 
  ( i thought about using wind magnitude instead of pressure but decided that that 's probably a bad example because you have things like tornados where wind does not really behave continuously . ), 
  in fact , why do n't i just try to come up with a plausible explanation for why the claim is true ( and sorry that it 's a little long ) . 
  instead of considering the full claim about the earth , let 's just consider the following 1-dimensional analogue : `` at every given time , there are two places * on the equator * , on opposite sides of the earth , having the same temperature . '', 
  let 's see why this could be true : suppose you go to the amazonas in brazil , and i go to the complete opposite side of the world ; that would be a place in indonesia . 
  now , if both of us record the temperature and find that they 're exactly the same , then we 've found the two places , but that 's probably not going to be the case . 
  instead , suppose that one is warmer than the other -- i 'll just assume that the amazonas are hotter than indonesia . 
  what we do now is check what the temperatures are around the equator ; i 'll check them in one direction , and you choose the same direction ( but still on the opposite side of the world ; that is , the temperatures we now measure are still on opposite sides -- [ crappy illustration ] ( http://pred.dk/dump/crappyillustration.png ) ) . 
  when we have checked temperatures half the way around the world , i 'll be in the amazonas , and you 'll be in indonesia . 
  now my thermometer shows a higher temperature than yours which means that somewhere along the way , the thermometers have gone from yours showing the highest temperature to mine showing the highest temperature . 
  at this point of change , our two thermometers must necessarily show the same temperature ( because temperature varies * continuously * along the equator ) , so we 've now find the two places on the equator , on opposite sides of the world , with the same temperature !, 
  the same sort of idea applies to the case where we consider the entire world , but i hope this sort of explains why it should be true ( and that indeed , i could have picked any numerical parameter -- for instance pressure -- instead of temperature ) !, 
  no problem ; math is sweet !, 
  hmm , i 'm not exactly sure what you mean by `` variants '' in your edit . 
  the more parameters we want the claim to be true for , the harder it gets , so in fact we will have to stick to two ; but if we liked , we could also just stick to temperature , and the claim would be that there are two places on opposite sides of the world with the same temperature , which is kind of surprising in its own !, 
  we ca n't do three though . 
  however , if the earth was 4-dimensional , so that maps of its `` surface '' would be 3-dimensional , we could do three parameters !, 
  alright , let me expand a little bit . 
  we begin by taking two things that vary continuously as we wander around on the surface of the earth . 
  as you say , temperature works for that purpose , and another good choice could be pressure . 
  there 's probably plenty of other interesting ones that one could come up with , but let 's just stick with those two for now . 
  now we ask ourselves the following question : can we cook up places on the earth where these two parameters have the same values ? 
  for instance , it could be the case that the temperature in amsterdam is the same as in berlin , but perhaps the pressure is a little different , so that 's no good : we really want both of those two things to be the same . 
  it turns out that the answer to the question is `` yes '' . 
  and not only that , we can actually find two such places on the earth that lie completely opposite to each other ; at any given time , there are two places on either side of the earth having both the same temperature and the same pressure !, 
  and even better , we can choose any such pair of data ; it does n't have to be temperature and pressure -- the only thing that matters is that both vary continuously !, 
  i 'm still a little confused ; does n't the ukrainian parliamentary system have some kind of notion of a [ motion of no confidence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/motion_of_no_confidence ) that would allow those opposing the bill to force the government to resign ? 
  here 's a cute and somewhat related mathematical fact . 
  let 's indeed say that temperature changes continuously around the surface of the earth . 
  let 's also pick a different continuous parameter like that . 
  i 'll let you choose one , but for now let 's just say barometric pressure or something like that . 
  then the [ borsuk -- ulam theorem ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/borsuk%e2%80%93ulam_theorem ) says that you can find two points on opposite sides of the earth , where the two parameters agree . 
  that is , right now , there are two points of the earth , lying completely opposite to each other , having the same temperature and pressure !, 
  i also have not really been following developments . 
  if government is a minority in parliament , why would not democratic procedures allow the oppositions to , well , at least be pissed off enough to vote out the government ?

  correct . 
  it sparked a fair amount of debate when right wing parties recently proposed the increased used of [ mandatory prison sentences ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mandatory_sentencing ) , as this was considered a huge attack on the [ montesquieu style separation of power ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/separation_of_powers#montesquieu.27s_tripartite_system ) that for now exists between the judicial and legislative branches in denmark . 
  we do have recent examples of mandatory prison sentencing though : an infamous example was introduced by a change of law in 2008 in which possession of an illegal knife would carry a sentence of seven days of prison . 
  as a result , in [ one often cited case ] ( http://nyhederne.tv2.dk/article.php/id-24777141:hobbyknive-gav-syv-dages-f%c3%a6ngsel.html ) , this meant that a guy who carried two [ workplace utility knives ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/utility_knife#workplace_utility_knives ) in his car -- according to his own testimony in order to be able to unpack boxes at his workplace -- was sentenced to prison . 
  this particular change to the law would eventually be reverted in 2012 .

  briefly put , one of the main goals of the commission was to investigate the basis for the danish participation in the war . 
  for example , in denmark , as in other places around the world , the participation was based -- at least partially -- on the assumption that one would find wmds in iraq . 
  since them , evidence arose through [ an intelligence agency whistleblower ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frank_grevil ) ( at the price of his imprisonment ) that the danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen exaggerated this perceived threat when briefing parliament . 
  having light cast on this issue , in my opinition at least , would be one of the main upshots of the committee 's works . 
  i 'm sure other people might have had different hopes for it as well . 
  the dismantlement comes immediately after the new government 's rise to power , and shortly after the announcements of the questionings of several central players , including fogh rasmussen .
