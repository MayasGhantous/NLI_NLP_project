  i hate to break this to you , but you just did it again . 
  giving him * \u03c0 * votes might have also caused some eyebrows to be raised . 
  and by giving this dude 0 votes they can avoid the entire `` well if we had rigged it , why would we give someone 0 votes when they are likely to vote for themselves ? '', 
  well played , riggers . 
  yeah , these maps seem to generally overly optimistically assume basic usage of all consonants ; in danish for instance , all of h ( hvor ) , g ( og ) , r ( bord ) , and j ( sej ) have counter-examples to the listed pronunciations . 
  so is naziislamisme . 
  difference between aalborg and copenhagen seems surprisingly high .

  *** ### leaked bill gives intelligence service access to telecom companies * the government proposes in a leaked bill to grant the [ danish defence intelligence service ] ( http://fe-ddis.dk/eng/pages/english.aspx ) unit [ centre for cyber security ] ( http://fe-ddis.dk/cfcs/pages/cfcs.aspx ) physical access to telecommunications companies in denmark to collect information -- without a court order . 
  very questionable , says telecom industry . 
  * *** at every given time and without a court order , centre for cyber security , which is a part of the defence intelligence , should be granted physical access to telecom companies in denmark . 
  this is what the government proposes in a [ leaked bill ] ( http://www.version2.dk/blog/cfcs-nye-magter-75498 ) , published by it expert poul-henning kamp . 
  '' centre for cyber security can , at any time , presenting proper proof of identity , and without a court order access telecom providers ' sites for imformation gathering , `` the bill says . 
  in addition , centre for cyber security is provided ` on request access to telecommunications infrastructure used by the providers ' . 
  this will happen to allow the centre for cyber security to monitor whether the telecom companies meet some unspecified safety regulations that the centre itself specifies , according to the bill . 
  but this is highly questionable , says jakob willer , director of the [ teleindustrien ] ( http://teleindustrien.dk/ ) , the danish telecom industry association . 
  '' it is contrary to the general principles of due process , and it is very difficult to see what the justification would be to introduce such an intrusive tool in an area where there is a need to strengthen transparency and confidence in the authorities and actors , `` he writes in an email to information . 
  jakob willer explains that he knows about the bill because the industry has been invited to a '' dialogue `` with centre for cyber security . 
  he emphasizes that there is a '' preliminary draft `` and that the telecom industry is '' happy to have been involved at an early stage in the process . `` '' and it is possible that they have listened to our input and concerns . 
  we do have hopes that they did , `` he tells information . 
  according to the bill , the purpose of the proposal is to generally '' promote network and information security in society `` . 
  since the leaked version does not contain so-called explanatory notes , it is not possible to determine the specific details . 
  for example , it is unclear what information centre for cyber security will be able to obtain . 
  still , jesper lund , vice president of [ it-political association of denmark ] ( http://itpol.dk/ ) , is strongly critical of the proposal so far . 
  '' my fear is that what is meant is access to the content of citizens ' communications , `` says jesper lund . 
  in a written comment to information , the ministry of defence emphasizes that the draft is preliminary : '' as part of its work with the bill , the ministry of defence has had a desire to involve the telecom industry and therefore invited the industry to a dialogue on a preliminary draft . 
  the industry gave a variety of imput and comments which are now included in the further work towards a more final bill . 
  before a final bill is presented , there will be a formal consultation process where a wider audience will have an opportunity to submit comments on the bill . `` according to the government 's current legislative program , the plan is for [ defence minister ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/defence_minister_of_denmark ) [ nicolai wammen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nicolai_wammen ) to present the final bill for [ the folketing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_folketing ) in february .

  *** ### the danish national police wants to increase surveillance of mobile phone location * the danish national police force ( rigspolitiet ) wants to reintroduce a controversial form of surveillance of citizens ' use of the internet . 
  at the same time , the police also wants to log the physical location of mobile phones when they are used to visit websites or send emails . 
  * *** the government abolished the controversial form of monitoring last year , but now rigspolitiet wants it reinstated . 
  this form of monitoring is the so-called session logging , which until june last year required telecommunications companies in denmark to record information about the use of the internet by all danish citizens . 
  this was [ uncovered by danish newspaper berlingske ] ( http://www.b.dk/nationalt/politiet-vil-genindfoere-overvaagning-af-danskere-paa-internettet ) on thursday , using documents originating from rigspolitiet . 
  but rigspolitiet does not simply want the session logging reintroduced . 
  in the documents , there is at one point talk of an extension of the monitoring , critics say . 
  documents from rigspolitiet show that , in relation to mobile data traffic , rigspolitiet desires to log information about the locations of mobile phones . 
  in other words , the mobile phone 's physical location will be saved when it uses the internet . 
  '' this is more comprehensive than previous registration . 
  especially because your mobile phone constantly sends and receives data traffic , `` says jesper lund , vice president of the [ it-political association of denmark ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/it-political_association_of_denmark ) . 
  today , telecom companies are already required to log a mobile phone 's location when it makes calls or sends text messages . 
  '' but if you only have a couple of calls a day and do not send many text messages , the data traffic will form the majority of the location records , `` says jesper lund . 
  christian panton , co-founder of internet policy think tank [ bitbureauet ] ( https://bitbureauet.dk/ ) , is also critical of rigspolitiet 's proposal . 
  '' if all data packets are to be assigned a location , we are talking about a complete location surveillance of people , `` he said . 
  ## serious problems according to the documents from rigspolitiet , it appears that rigspolitiet organized a meeting with the telecom industry `` at the request of the ministry of justice '' . 
  the ministry of justice itself has previously acknowledged that the existing form of session logging was associated with `` serious practical problems '' when the police wanted to take advantage of the tool . 
  this the ministry wrote in a statement that was made public in early 2013 . 
  according to the ministry , the reason for the problems partly were that the telecom companies had implemented the scheme in a way which made the surveillance virtually `` useless '' . 
  secondly , there was a problem with the `` technological maturity level in danish police '' . 
  at a european level , the collection of information on citizens ' telephone and internet traffic has also been challenged . 
  in april last year , a ruling by the the european court of justice invalidated the so-called [ data retention directive ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/data_retention_directive ) which required member states to collect certain information on citizens ' telephone and internet traffic . 
  this happened with reference to the european citizens ' right to respect for their privacy and personal data protection . 
  the court also held that the gathering of information , as required by the directive , was of a type that could `` create a feeling for the people affected that their privacy is subject to constant monitoring '' . 
  ## minister : nothing is final when former minister of justice karen h\u00e6kkerup ( [ s ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_democrats_%28denmark%29 ) ) abolished the session logging in june last year , it came not with reference to the ecj ruling . 
  instead , the ministry of justice concluded that the danish logging law was not in breach of the [ eu charter of fundamental rights ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charter_of_fundamental_rights_of_the_european_union ) . 
  but the ministry nevertheless held that it was `` doubtful , whether the parts of the law dealing with session logging can be considered suitable for achieving their objective , which is to allow for the information to be used as part of the investigation and prosecution of criminal offenses '' . 
  rigspolitiet does not wish to comment on the case but refers to the ministry of justice . 
  however , it has not been possible to get an interview with minister of justice mette frederiksen ( s ) . 
  but in a written reply she said : '' today criminals often use phones and the internet to organize crime . 
  therefore it is essential that the police have the necessary tools to fight crime . 
  it is also essential that the logging rules guarantee respect for the fundamental rights of citizens . `` '' the government has launched a comprehensive review of the logging rules , and as the government has also expressed earlier , the telecom industry and other stakeholders will be involved in the audit work . 
  and i want to emphasize that neither the government nor i have committed ourselves to how the new rules can or should be drawn up . ``,

  *** ### proposed anti-terrorism legal bundle allows danish defence intelligence service to monitor danes abroad -- without needing warrants * the [ danish defence intelligence service ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/danish_defence_intelligence_service ) ( ddis ) will be able to monitor danes staying abroad on a loose basis raising concerns of legal certainty , if a new proposal from the danish government is implemented , according to legal think tank [ justitia ] ( http://justitia-int.org/en/ ) . 
  [ amnesty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amnesty_international ) and [ the danish institute for human rights ] ( http://www.humanrights.dk/about-us ) are also skeptical . 
  * *** the government 's proposal to give the ddis the facility to carry out targeted surveillance of danes abroad without the need of a warrant draws criticism for providing the service with too extensive powers . 
  specifically , the government will provide the service the capability to monitor extremists from denmark abroad when there is '' reason to believe that the person intends to participate in activities that may involve or increase a threat to denmark , danish interests , or the security of other countries `` . 
  this is apparent from a proposal for a new `` terror package '' introduced by the government thursday . 
  danish extremists should know that we '' will listen and we will breathe down their necks if they put together vile plans against denmark or other countries , `` as [ defense minister ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/defence_minister_of_denmark ) [ nicolai wammen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nicolai_wammen ) said at a news conference . 
  but the wording that the surveillance can happen only if there is '' reason to believe ... `` is criticised by jacob mchangama , director of the legal think tank justitia . 
  he believes that the wording is very broad and imprecise , which risks providing the service with too much power . 
  '' when on top of that you depart from a requirement of a prior court order , this opens the potential for abuse , `` says jacob mchangama , adding : '' it could be , for example , that the service monitored the majority of people who travel to turkey because it is a transit country for syria . 
  it would be a very broad interpretation of the wording . `` legal adviser at amnesty international in denmark , claus juul , is also critical . 
  '' if you really want to make a general authority that the ddis can monitor danes abroud without a warrant , that is problematic . 
  you do not operate conditioned by a substantiated suspicion , and the legal constraints that would normally be in place when a person is in denmark , are completely gone , `` he says . 
  ## will scrutinize bill carefully with the new proposal several legal uncertainties arise , says jacob mchangama . 
  the proposal would also mean that danes who are in denmark could be monitored if they are communicating with a dane abroad who is monitored by the service , he assesses . 
  '' this would then also be possible without a court order in any of the ends , `` he says . 
  today , the ddis can -- on request from the danish security and intelligence service , conditioned by the requirement of a court order -- carry out so-called '' physical gathering `` targeting danes abroad . 
  this , for instance , could be via an individual source abroad . 
  but current legislation does not allow the ddis to carry out target surveillance of individuals abroad , as far as electronic communications are concerned . 
  this can only happen through so-called `` by chance findings '' that occur when the ddis intercepts the data of danes in connection with a surveillance directed at targets abroad . 
  this is apparent from the so-called `` legal remarks '' in the existing legal framework governing the service . 
  jonas christoffersen , director of the danish institute for human rights says that he is generally skeptical about the ability to monitor danes abroad without a court order . 
  '' one has to be when departing from the principle of requiring a warrant . 
  the human rights require that there must be an independent and effective control of the authorities . 
  but depending on how the ` authority supervising the intelligence services ' ( tet ) becomes involved , it may well prove to be consistent with human rights , `` he says . 
  '' we will , when we see the bill , scrutinize it very carefully to assess whether or not it is consistent with human rights not to set up requirements for judicial control `` . 
  ## new court ? 
  at yesterday 's press conference , nicolai wammen stressed that the ddis will brief the ( tet ) when the service in the future makes use of the proposed power .
