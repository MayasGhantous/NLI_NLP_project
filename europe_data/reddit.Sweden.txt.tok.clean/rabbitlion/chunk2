  rumuni in polish means romanian and is a different ethnicity . 
  i suppose it 's possible that the meanings have shifted or that people simply do n't know the difference . 
  most people in sweden are aware of the difference between ethnic romanians and ethnic romani , though that distinction is blurred more and more as media etc do n't want to use even the term romani and just calls them romanians ( which is n't exactly wrong . 
  other than that we do n't know much at all . 
  even if the primary purpose was not to exterminate africans , it 's hard to deny reckless intent , i.e. 
  the slave kidnappers/transporters/traders realized their treatment led to the death of thousands or millions but did not care and continued anyway . 
  if nazi germany would not have executed the jews but merely utilized them as slave labor , causing millions to die from guard treatment , diseases and hunger , it would still have been a genocide . 
  as far as i can tell , the turkish government does not deny the actual events , that a government-ordered relocation caused a massive loss of armenian lives . 
  they only deny that the intent behind the relocation was to exterminate the armenians . 
  intent is a curious subject though . 
  should `` reckless intent '' and `` negligent intent '' count for defining what is genocide ? 
  in the end the only one of these examples that is completely black and white is really the holocaust , with the others falling somewhere on the greyscale between tragedy and genocide . 
  the biggest difference with the american examples is simply that they happened so long ago . 
  only a few people alive have ever met someone born before the civil war , and the actual possible genocide in that case happened long long earlier than that . 
  the only reason the vietnam war is considered an atrocity is that the us lost and a lot of american soldiers died . 
  if it had been a swift and decisive victory like iraq it would still be viewed as a success today for beating back communism . 
   the transatlantic slave trade resulted in a vast and as yet still unknown loss of life for african captives both in and outside america . 
  approximately ** 1.2 -- 2.4 million ** africans died during their transport to the new world . 
  [ 67 ] ** more died soon upon their arrival ** . 
  the number of lives lost in the procurement of slaves remains a mystery but may equal or exceed the number who survived to be enslaved . 
  [ 68 ] so 1.2-2 .4 million , plus more than that , and an unknown number that died/were killed while still in africa . 
  clearly this should be considered a genocide ? 
  does it not qualify because the purpose was not primarily extermination but enslavement ? 
  most indigenous americans died as a result of disease or starvation . 
  this was a direct result of the europeans outspoken plan to conquer the land to use for their own . 
  similarly in the ottoman empire , while a few people were summarily executed , most deaths came as a result of disease and starvation due to the forced relocation . 
  note that i 'm not trying to deny the existence of the armenian genocide , i 'm merely trying to shed some light on why turkey are so unwilling to admit it and point out similarities to other more respectable countries that effectively do the same thing . 
  and yet , just like turkey you still refuse to call those situations genocides . 
  swedish isp bahnhof has already stopped collecting data and deleted all previously retained data . 
  https://bahnhof.se/press/press-releases/2014/04/08/efter-eu-domen-bahnhof-upphor-med-all-datalagring-omedelbart ( swedish ), 
  no , it says nothing about protecting borders . 
  it says that usa , uk and russia can not invade or threaten ukraine . 
  sorry about your computer . 
  except russia and china ? 
  it 's a bit hard to know what you 're referring to since your links never seem to support your claims . 
  the only relevant thing here that i could find is :  sweden is also made a less interesting market for traffickers . 
  raids conducted by the swedish police often involve two to four victims , whereas in several countries across europe such raids often involves up to 60 victims . 
  the law is therefore viewed as a success . 
  this is an incredibly vague claim in the first place . 
  estimating the total amount of trafficking based on number of victims found in successful raids is not going to give you very accurate numbers . 
  going back to what i said earlier , the reason why swedish police never bust any large operations could very well be because buyers will never tell them about it . 
  if someone suspects trafficking is happening in germany or the netherlands they will call the police , in sweden not so much . 
  in the end this is all a completely moot point , because swedish police were n't busting any 60 victim trafficking operations before the law went into effect either . 
  it 's weird how they can attribute it to the law without providing any numbers of the earlier situation . 
  there could be many reasons why trafficking operations are rare in sweden , but there has n't been anything to link it to this relatively new law . 
  if anything , the fact that procuring is legal in germany/netherlands is probably what makes it easier for traffickers there . 
  first link says :  seeking to explain the emergence of anti-trafficking initiatives , scholars have explored two sets of ideas -- national security and gender equality -- thought to shape policy . 
  in this study , we examine whether such ideational influence accounts for sweden 's evolving anti-trafficking policy over the past decade . 
  i 'm not sure how that is relevant at all as it 's more a study regarding political opinions and policies . 
  the second link talks about the famous and controversial 2010 study . 
  the study does not show any evidence of reduced trafficking . 
  the fact that overall prostitution is reduced is only a good thing if you accept the premise that prostitution is bad . 
  also , the study did not even attempt to investigate internet-based prostitution . 
  with or without a law it 's reasonable to assume that a large part of prostitution would have moved to the internet in 1998-2008 . 
  visible street prostitution did reduce significantly more in sweden than other comparable countries for the period , which is not surprising since people generally avoid committing crimes in public view . 
    criminalizing prostitution is the opposite of making it a social issue  we have n't criminalised the prostitutes - just the buyer . 
  they are allowed to sell , you are not allowed to buy . 
  regardless of who is criminalized , the entire business is forced to move out of public view . 
  if hiring a prostitute is illegal , people will not want to do it in places where they could be seen/caught . 
  therefore , prostitutes are forced to offer their services in non-public locations if they want to get any customers . 
  this makes it harder for authorities and organizations trying to support the sellers to initiate contact . 
  if there 's a rumor that a prostitute is in contact with the police , buyers are likely to stay away . 
  in the end there is zero evidence that such laws do anything to reduce trafficking and forced prostitution . 
  in my opinion they probably do the opposite . 
  if hiring prostitutes is illegal , buyers are less likely to contact police if they suspect the seller is a victim of trafficking . 
  there 's little reason to assume that the lower rates of trafficking in sweden ( do you have a source for that ? ), 
  is due to the ban of consensual prostitution . 
  looking at the [ trends for trafficking crimes ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4efqi0e.png ) shows an increase since the law was created . 
   in sweden it is more of a social issue , as in trying to get the women/men into programs etc. 
  what ? 
  criminalizing prostitution is the opposite of making it a social issue . 
  the fact that it 's a crime drives the people involved away from authorities and programs . 
  ah , cool . 
  the remaining 6 % does n't go abroad . 
  it 's hidden . 
  write `` ok maps '' in the search field to cache the current area in gogle maps . 
  on my street , from one day to the next there were suddenly ~ 20 beggars , spaced evenly 100m apart from each other . 
   however , the bank appealed the next day , and the decision was ultimately nullified on the grounds that a justice of the peace did not have the power to make such a ruling . 
  completely true . 
  depending on the vest it may protect against projectiles , sharp objects , or both . 
  i ca n't tell which type she 's wearing but it makes sense to me that knifes would be at least as big a risk as guns for this application . 
  in normal circumstances , aiming for the head is much less effective than aiming for center mass ( torso ) . 
  even if the vest is visible it provides significant protection . 
  it also helps against knife attacks . 
  to be fair , if you asked 100 `` fusion scientists '' now , i think all 100 would agree that in hindsight , all the paths to completion in that diagram was extremely optimistic and would n't have happened even with the funding they wanted . 
  from the article :  the us circuit court of appeals in san francisco ruled that because carol sachs had bought a eurail pass from a us-based company the case had enough connection to commercial activity in the us . 
  maybe she 's hoping this us-based company will be forced to pay . 
  introduction dates should n't mean a whole lot since all 3 planes will have received massive upgrades since they were first built/introduced . 
  if anything a brand new plane will be more prone to software bugs and faulty designs . 
  i have my home city cached in google maps and when i go abroad i usually cache it before i leave home . 
  even if i would n't be using wifi to download the maps it 's usually not more than 1-5mb for a city , and i do n't travel _ that _ much . 
  streaming music radio does add up fairly quickly i suppose . 
  in the end i suppose you use what you got . 
  if you have a contract that allows you to use 70gb without problems there 's no need to bother with cached maps or offline playlists . 
  still , 70gb without heavy tethering use seems extreme . 
  1gb is fairly standard in sweden as the default without paying extra . 
  you can get 5gb for something like $ 8 per month or completely unlimited for something like $ 30 per month . 
  i just have n't felt a need for it , especially as i can usually use google maps and surf on the limited speed even after it caps out , should that happen . 
  1gb is low , but it 's not really absurdly low . 
  if you set google play , spotify and such to only download when you have a wifi connection the data amount never actually becomes that big .
