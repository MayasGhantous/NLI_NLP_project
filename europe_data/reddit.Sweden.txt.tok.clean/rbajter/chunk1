this does n't make sense to me at all . 
  the european defence agency ( eda ) have been running military research since 2004 with its own budget and all . 
  just look at it !, 
  [ eda ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_defence_agency ), 
  i would just like to add that viking was an occupation , not a culture or people . 
  you would go viking , kind of like hiking except with swords . 
  [ european values study ] ( http://www.europeanvaluesstudy.eu/page/about-evs.html ), 
  i graduated from the college in question in 2000 . 
  its a decent school with some good programmes . 
  foreign students used to be able to enroll at all swedish colleges and universities for free , just like the locals . 
  that changed a few years ago and now foreigners have to pay tuition to attend . 
  the programme in question : [ mdh ] ( http://www.mdh.se/utbildning/program/analyticalfinance ) click `` in english '' at the top for the english version . 
  a two year program will not earn you a degree though . 
  that was comprehensive . 
  north denmark . 
  i remember scraping frost from the windscreen of my car using a credit card one august morning in adelaide . 
  of those only about 20000 are actual police officers . 
  from the official migration agency [ site ] ( https://www.migrationsverket.se/english/private-individuals/protection-and-asylum-in-sweden/when-you-have-received-a-decision-on-your-asylum-application/if-your-application-is-refused/if-your-application-for-asylum-is-refused.html ) :   the migration agency can also make decisions about supervision or safekeeping . 
  supervision means you shall register with the migration agency or the police within a certain period . 
  if you have received a decision about safekeeping you may live in rented quarters while waiting to depart . 
  you may also receive a decision about forbidding you to travel back . 
    if the migration agency is of the opinion that force will have to be used to carry out the decision , the responsibility to carry it out is turned over to the police . 
  sweden has the same issues with morrocan migrants , mostly minors . 
  authorities have been working with morroco to get them to accept them back with increasing success . 
  now sweden is working together with germany to return the youngest migrants by setting up orphanages in morocco . 
  it 's simple ; they 're hiding from the police . 
  that 's a bit rude . 
  tall buildings are not human scale though . 
  the golden rule is : do n't build houses taller than the trees surrounding them . 
  they start to look weird . 
  the pedestrian street where this happened was protected by concrete blocks , but i guess they were n't heavy enough to stop a big lorry . 
  you can see them scattered in the street in some photos, 
  the last attack in 2010 apparently was because of the artist lars vilks and our involvement in afghanistan . 
  [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_stockholm_bombings ) not sure about this one yet . 
  this can possibly be explained by the kind of ticket validation system used . 
  in many swedish cities , like stockholm , you need to validate your ticket with the driver ; hence queues . 
  in gothenburg they have an open validation system so you can enter anywhere on the bus and use the machine where you entered . 
  i know berlin uses open validation too . 
  there are many old things in modern countries . 
  in the case of sweden , the crown has always ( mostly ) cooperated with the lower classes , usually to keep the nobles in check . 
  so forces trying to change sweden into a republic have not been successful . 
  however , many of the parties in the parliament want to change sweden into a republic , including the current ruling party ; the social democrats . 
  the last of the real royal powers ( except for immunity from prosecution ) was signed away by the current king , carl xvi gustaf , when he ascended the throne in 1973 . 
  even so , the last time a swedish actually used his power was in 1914 . 
  somewhere between 38 and 47 percent . 
  turns out sweden is ahead of the pack on this . 
  the us is around 30 percent . 
  well , if you live in a detached house you will still have your own heater hooked up to the district heating , which is a closed loop , so you ca n't go to your neighbor to complain . 
  are n't you proud and humbled that your culture has such an impact on the ancient cultures of the world ? 
  europe in this case . 
  to me it 's weird that your country is n't more open to other cultures ; movies , music and books . 
  at least here in europe we 're always stealing each other 's culture and making them our own . 
  german , french , italian or whatever is the most popular at the moment . 
  right now it 's american . 
  enjoy it while it lasts !, 
  they 're most likely thinking about all the promises of increased welfare spending ( school , police , healthcare , etc ) they made to their voters . 
  increased profits for swedish companies also means more income from taxes . 
  i think it ebbs and flows . 
  right now the ebb is quite low . 
  every time i have needed help from the healthcare system it has worked flawlessly . 
  i guess the problems are localized to different areas and types of healthcare . 
  ers for instance . 
  this thing might be useful right about now : [ 3d world population ] ( http://metrocosm.com/globe-population.html ), 
  miss grass grower 2016 finalists . 
  such impressive growths !, 
  during the miljonprogram the state provided credit for the construction companies so they could build larger areas at once . 
  today they build a smaller part , wait to get their money back and start building the next one . 
  it 's part of the problem . 
  but i do n't think anybody really wants to start a new miljonprogram . 
  we tried that once . 
  if you want to get out of the tourist crowds crowds in gamla stan you just need to switch from v\u00e4sterl\u00e5nggatan to \u00d6sterl\u00e5nggatan or any of the other smaller streets inbetween . 
  gamla stan is full of hidden gems but you need to get off the tourist highway - v\u00e4sterl\u00e5nggatan - to find them . 
  abuse is n't funny, 
  i believe they were swedish and dutch . 
  was in antwerp last week . 
  overdosed on bolleke and kriek . 
  filled up the car with said goods and headed back to the frozen north . 
  sadly kulminator was closed so i will have to come back for that . 
  see you soon !, 
  just adding fuel . 
  fortunately , our neighbors are well behaved and never use their military to try to influence the politics of european countries . 
  [ easter 2013 ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/12139943/russia-simulated-a-nuclear-strike-against-sweden-nato-admits.html ), 
  sweden just reintroduced conscription after being without it for about seven years . 
  not a bad flag . 
  something missing though . 
  colours are off . 
  \\ #fecc 00 and \\ # 006aa7 ? 
  yours are \\ #ffd 500 and \\ # 005bbb . 
  totally different !, 
  depends on how you do it . 
  if you dress in black or brown , shave your head and walk down the street shouting racial slurs , i 'm sure that you will . 
  if you wave the flag in hagaparken or on skansen today wearing light clothes and a picnic basket , it will just be a nice day out . 
  it 's weird that nobles want a new king from their own group when their current one starts butchering them . 
  ok , here ya go : [ spring ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/v\u00e5r_i_sverige ) [ summer ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/sommar ) [ autumn ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/h\u00f6st_i_sverige ) [ winter ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/vinter_i_sverige ), 
  kinda hard to find an official description not in swedish , but i found this blog post which explains it pretty well : [ swedish seasons ] ( https://somethingswedish.wordpress.com/2012/09/28/swedish-seasons/ ), 
  thank you . 
  we appreciate you fucking us . 
  come again !, 
  actually in sweden we mainly use the meteorological definition for seasons . 
  so when the average daily temperature has been above 10 \u00b0 c for five days it is considered the start of summer .
