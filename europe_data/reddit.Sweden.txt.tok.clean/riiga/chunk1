this summer was terrible . 
  my apartment reached an unbearable 32 \u00b0 c and stayed like that for days , had to sleep without any blanket at all . 
  and outside it was even worse since the sun was shining all the time . 
  does n't help that the sun rises as 3 in the morning and sets at 11 in the evening . 
  you get used to it . 
  unless it 's below -10 \u00b0 c , snowing heavily or strong winds there 's no need for anything extra on your head or face . 
  i do n't wear a scarf or ski hat until it gets there . 
  especially australians who shitpost in every thread thinking they know everything about europe . 
  good riddance .

  it looks like the former red-green coalition consisting of the social democrats ( s ) , left party ( v ) , and green party ( mp ) will win , but they wo n't get a majority in the parliament . 
  the sweden democrats ( sd ) who want to restrict immigration ( the only party with that agenda among the 8 big ones ) are looking like they will double their last result and get about 10 % of the vote . 
  as such , they might have the chance to act as weigher between the two sides . 
  the current government , the alliance consisting of the moderates ( m ) , centre party ( c ) , liberal party ( fp ) , and christian democrats ( kd ) is the big loser in this election . 
  ** sweden ** * election tonight . 
  it 's all that matters , and all that 's been in the news the past week . 
  ideally : dissovled . 
  realistally : dissovled . 
  it may almost seem like we used to be the same country ... 
  how about you respect freedom of speech instead ? 
  the site is hosted in the us after all .

   most importantly , the release is before the swedish version !, 
  only because it takes much longer to learn danish .

   seems like we have n't had a gypsy or immigrant hate-thread in a while . 
  thanks to fascist mods . 
  we call it `` eastern lake '' for a reason . 
  or it would make sense to have speed limits according to the conditions in the country . 
  assuming for example that norway was part of the eu , having a eu-wide 130 speed limit on motorways would n't really work ( they 've just recently started trialing 110 on some stretches ) , and neither would having 110 to account for bendy motorways in the mountainous countries make sense on the german autobahn . 
  if we still put the speed limit high , then countries that wanted constant lower limits would have to sign them all over since it would be regulated that the speed limit was , say 130 otherwise . 
  we 've successfully standardised road signage in the world to some extent , which i 'd say is more than enough . 
  regulating stuff like speed limits should really be up to the national transportation agency to decide , not eu bureaucrats . 
  why ? 
  is n't it better for the countries to decide according to their road culture and conditions ? 
  ah , yes . 
  the swedish summer is the best day of the year . 
  one difference is that our winters mostly are dry which makes the cold quite pleasant compared to the wet and rainy winters in western and southern europe . 
  also , most houses have double or triple glazing and proper insulation which makes indoor temperatures stay at 20 c no matter how cold it is outside . 
  it 's a downside during summer though , as it makes the heat harder to get rid of , but the scandinavian summer is short anyway . 
  yes , but if the person failed to read the names and just looked at the pictures , then it would be much harder , and i guess this was the case . 
  you can hardly blame him . 
  the nature , building styles , city planning , etc are almost identical . 
  they 're out in the open , but you 're allowed to bring your own papers if you 've previously taken/gotten any . 
  most people though take a few different ones from the stand and bring to the polling booth , discarding the ones they 're not going to vote for . 
  it 's not really an issue . 
  indeed . 
  we had preliminary results two hours after the polling stations closed . 
  only parties expected to win seats or gain a notable result are counted first though , which is usally around 7-10 parties . 
  in sweden we have [ these ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/valsedlar_europaparlamentet_2009.jpg ) . 
  they come with the party name and a list of candidates . 
  you can mark one candidate or you can use the [ version of the ballot that only has the party name ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/81/kalle_anka_partiet_voting_slip_sweden.png ) if you prefer not to vote for any specific candidate . 
  there are also empty ballots ( lower left corner in the first image ) where you may write the name of the party ( or anything really ) . 
  all votes no matter what is written are recorded . 
  czech and slovak languages are mutually intelligible . 
  it makes very little effort to speak the other language . 
  english is taught in every czech school yet only fraction of people have enough of courage ( and opportunity ) to use it in practice . 
  the beauty of a having a centralised public population register . 
  eh , '' [ rysk ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/rysk ) '' is the word `` russian '' in swedish . 
  russian gas - rysk gas . 
  well , we ( and probably the rest of the nordic countries ) do n't use that kind of heating . 
  a lot of households in sweden use some sort of [ district heating ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/district_heating#sweden ) which is quite environmental friendly . 
  the others use direct electric heating or live in the countryside and have an old oil heater , or a more modern pellets heater . 
  i 've also never encountered a gas stove in sweden , except for in an old house in stockholm . 
  an induction stove is almost as good . 
  we use [ district heating ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/district_heating#sweden ) . 
  instead of landfills we burn the waste to produce electricity , warm water and use that warm water for district heating too . 
  also has a great [ cover version ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbrhtmvr9bq ) . 
  they do n't call it `` the good old swedish times '' in estonia for nothing , 
  2 + 2 = 5 , have n't you heard ? 
  sad to hear , we could really use more nordic cooperation and trade . 
  perhaps some swedish fighter jets ? 
  neutrality . 
   he has as much right to comment on sweden as everyone else . 
  i have n't said otherwise . 
   he 's not wrong just because you dislike his view on the political landscape . 
  please , i corrected him on facts , not opinion . 
   the sverigedemokraterna ( sd ) is the only anti eu party around .
