  as for the rest of your post , i 'm not here to debate , i was merely correcting him . 
  just stop it . 
  you really need to stop acting like some sort of know-it-all commenting on stuff you have no clue about . 
  a simple basic glance at the swedish political parties will tell you that both sverigedemokraterna and the left party are anti-eu . 
  the greens used to be against it too , but nowadays they 're just against further eu integration and the emu . 
  what about the president of the european council ? 
  but that would be democracy !, 
  ca n't have any of that in this corrupt union . 
  seems like ~ ~ russia ~ ~ the ussr also got hold of / r/swarje, 
  in sweden it 's illegal if you 're under 15 years of age . 
  most people in built-up areas rely on district heating rather than electricity for heating . 
  it is . 
  indeed . 
  the city where i live has a large waste-to-energy plant that among other uses that energy for [ district heating ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/district_heating#sweden ) . 
  they also use food waste for producing biogas which [ our buses ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:biogasbus.png ) run on . 
  related : [ diagram of swedish electricity generation ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dnmox9d.png ) hydropower ( red ) and nuclear power ( blue ) make up about 85 % of the total generated electricity . 
  wind power ( brown ) accounts for about 4-5 % . 
  that 's what we get for staying in the eu . 
  i 've said nothing on that matter , just that i admire the swiss for their integrity when it comes to matters like democracy . 
  it 's nice to see that that switzerland still has proper democracy and people that will stand up for what they believe in . 
  i can only agree . 
  `` only '' $ 100,000, 
  got ta love european `` democracy '' ... 
  ** sweden ** you learn the historical provinces ( * landskap * ) of sweden , 25 of them to be exact , and very often the municipalities/communes ( * kommuner * ) in your province . 
  these provinces however have no role in administrative matters though , and we use a slightly different set of regions ( * l\u00e4n * ) .

   mcdonalds intrudced a mcnip burger which people seem to think is a big deal .

   the net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it .

  by banning something as prevalent as porn the politicians only shoot themselves in the foot . 
  [ sw\u00c4rje !, 
  ** sweden ** there are no formal requirements for forming a party , and you do n't need to register the party to run in the election . 
  you can even order ballot papers without being a registered party . 
  if you choose to register though , you are guaranteed sole right to the party name in elections . 
  registering requires proof of a central council , a decision by the council to register the name , a person responsible to put on the registration form and a number of signatures from citizens depending on the type of election . 
  the number of signatures required are : * 1500 for national ( * riksdag * ) or european parliament elections . 
  * 100 for regional parliament elections ( * landsting * ) . 
  * 50 for local parliament elections ( * kommun * ) . 
  official information in swedish : [ forming a party ] ( http://www.val.se/det_svenska_valsystemet/partier/bilda_parti/index.html ) and [ party registration ] ( http://www.val.se/det_svenska_valsystemet/partier/registrera_partibeteckning/index.html ) . 
  as for the rest , most of sweden is still on vacation . 
  it was a joke , as indicated by the '' :-) '' .

  because it 's part of europe , hurr-durr .
