  when america does isolationism its okay but when europe does we are bad human beings !, 
  germany . 
  if us scandinavians are brothers and sisters , then germany is that awesome somewhat distant cousin . 
  it 's culture is like ours yet have significant differences that make it interesting . 
  the climate and geography is pretty sweet too . 
  it 's much more diverse than we . 
  swede  [ s\u00f6rml\u00e4nning ] ( http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/s%c3%b6dermanland )  scandinavian  nordic  european  human . 
  they 're probably still pissed about schleswig-holstein . 
  do you mean accents or dialects ? 
  it sort of looks like gotland . 
  they have that `` savanna '' feel too .

  in the cold dark winters here in sweden , gl\u00f6gg ( mulled wine ) is the way to go . 
  you are correct . 
  socialdemokraterna ( s ) are socialists while v\u00e4nsterpartiet is close-to-communist . 
  hell they dropped the `` communist '' in their title 1990 . 
  i think that ` eastern realm ' would be a more fitting translation . 
  i 'm 18 . 
  all my friends do n't drink water and they get hangovers . 
  it 's always so lonely after a night out . 
  i 've never had a real hangover since every time i 'm out drinking with my friends i drink a shit-ton of water on the side and before bed . 
  works like a charm . 
  it 's quite funny regarding dutch . 
  i think i was in 7th or 8th grade and our swedish teacher made us read a chapter of anne frank 's diary .

  france !,

  we do n't give them anything because we know the money does n't go to them . 
  that 's because we know that they 're brought here by criminal organizations who take the money for themselves . 
  this is common knowledge here . 
  every german on / r/europe now : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uh4s9rqv5os, 
  we swedes are a bit worried . 
  we 're afraid that the russians are gon na snatch gotland away from us and for the first time in 10 years ( ! ), 
  we put eight of our leopards 2 ( s ) back onto gotland to defend . 
  i feel really sorry for our neighbors in the east though . 
  holy roman empire . 
  habsburg empire . 
  austrian empire . 
  i really like the history of the austria in general also maria theresa was one bad-ass queen . 
  i was on holiday in hungary two years back . 
  awesome place . 
  i happen to love trying other cultures food and nagy v\u00e1s\u00e1rcsarnok was like ~ ~ heaven ~ ~ valhalla . 
  oh god i wish we had l\u00e1ngos here . 
  only time i 've seen them here in sweden is when there 's the annual fair in my town and the hungarian immigrants/descends set up a stall and sell them . 
  also google fiber plz . 
  wow !, 
  i though europe was best when it came to the internet . 
  i hope they get to pass these reforms . 
  we 're not that friendly of romanians . 
  the stereotype is that all of them are gypsies who only come here to sit in our street and beg . 
  i would say that we all are a bit xenophobic . 
  as you can see i answered in english below . 
  you see root beer where i live are sometimes unbelievably hard to acquire or surprisingly easy . 
  one to two stores sell it near me and when it runs out it takes like 50 years for them to acquire more . 
  i live in str\u00e4ngn\u00e4s , s\u00f6dermanland so a 88 km trip to stockholm is not appropriate to acquire root beer . 
  root beer . 
  holy shit is n't that good . 
  any russian speakers able to translate what is said in the video ? 
  i 've been playing metal gear solid v : the phantom pain lately and the soldiers in one region are speaking afrikaans . 
  it 's quite cool to hear them speak since i can sometimes understand entire sentences without reading the subtitles . 
  language is amazing . 
  `` it has never been a question ** if ** the russians are coming ... only ** when ** . '', 
  he has also acted as a radical feminist who wrote articles in a newspaper . 
  '' ... responding to arguments by attacking a person 's character , rather than addressing the content of their arguments . . '' he 's not addressing the content of my post . 
  he 's attacking me . 
  that 's a personal attack or ad hominem . 
  i never mentioned race . 
  i never said these people were inferior because of their skin color . 
  you 're talking out of your ass . 
  do n't you fucking dare to discredit me with your ad hominem . 
  what i am saying is things that have happened to me and things that i 've seen . 
  also how i am racist !? 
  have i even mentioned race ? 
  if it was norwegians that did this i would say the same fucking thing . 
  of course i 'm referring to them . 
  okay . 
  let me tell you about the hungarian revolution . 
  tons of people took the opportunity to flee the soviet rule over hungary . 
  they spread out but many people came to sweden . 
  the hungarians were extremely thankful for us letting them stay there until they could go back to their country . 
  they needed to pay us back . 
  that was their mentality . 
  the hungarians slaved in low-paid jobs and factories while they lived in tent-cities and low-income housing . 
  when the revolution was over , some went back and some stayed . 
  when the soviet union fell in the 90 's a lot of them went back . 
  do n't tell me everyone does it . 
  this is a phenomenon exclusively to the third world . 
  if they really are refugees fleeing from terror and war then would n't they just head to neighboring country ? 
  if war and terror broke out in sweden .
