  i would probably head to finland or norway . 
  i would n't travel across the fucking world to get to australia . 
  these people are economic migrants . 
  they 're not going to head back to their country when the dust settles . 
  they get so many generous grants and they allotted housing . 
  why work ? 
  that 's why they do n't stay in italy , greece , serbia and macedonia . 
  these people are literally welfare lechers . 
  they do . 
  sweden has the same problem . 
  it 's obvious agenda-pushing . 
  the current ceo of swedish television handed out a prize to a violent ( axe through doors of disseinting people , beat someone down in the street violent ) extreme-left organisation . 
  it 's quite scary actually . 
  `` only reporting facts '' . 
  everyone has their biases . 
  i do not contest that . 
  yet people and media should strive after being as objective as they can in reporting the news . 
  reporting should not take sides . 
  let that be in the editorial section of the newspaper . 
  i fear that a lot of newspapers are agenda-pushing more and more ( right and left ) instead of being honest journalists that fights to uphold journalistic ethics . 
  sadly . 
  it 's just easier and earns more money to push out some shitty clickbait article with no fact-checking and no investigation . 
  it can also be a `` gotcha '' moment too . 
  you tut while wiggling your finger sideways . 
  two more of my favorite national alcoholic beverages are : punsch and svagdricka ( like kvass i believe ) . 
  in sweden it 's almost mandatory to put small swedish flags on our christmas trees . 
  i thought it was supposed to be a day or two . 
  not just a couple of hours . 
  this was just unnecessary . 
  attentat is also used in swedish . 
  it 's really good for romania that they are shaping up and that they are exterminating the widespread corruption in the country . 
  it warms the heart to see a country develop for the better . 
  let 's hope that these two women 's crusade succeeds . '',

  this question has always perplexed me regarding these migrants . 
  why are there no women or children ? 
  why is it almost exclusively young men ? 
  why would n't the migrants bring their families ? 
  you are able to see windows on the roof so they are probably attics . 
  they might be multi-story attics too because of how the windows are positioned . 
  coupled with us swedes tendency to `` listen and believe '' what ever comes out of our established media . 
  that established media where they sing praises about immigration and how if do n't like immigration you are a racist and a horrible human being .

  no , you left out the last part of his sentence either by malice or neglect . 
  having a british passport makes you a british citizen yes but it does not make you british . 
  and your point makes no sense . 
  is guus hiddink a south korean just because he has a south korean citizenship ? 
  is angelina jolie a cambodian because she has a cambodian citizenship ? 
  is french actor g\u00e9rard depardieu belgian because he has a belgian citizenship ? 
  citizenship does n't equate to being a member of that national group . 
  just because someone lives there , speaks the same language and has a citizenship does n't make them a part of that national group . 
  look at [ this picture depicting the cultural iceberg ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4egsm00.png ) . 
  i personally believe that a person can never really change their culture . 
  culture is so ingrained in our brains and define how we act , what we believe , how we talk , how we feel etc. 
  that only their children can change culture . 
  if their offspring ( second or third generation ) spends large amount of time absorbing the other culture and that their parents try as hard as they can to change . 
  only then that transition can happen . 
  having a british passport makes them a british citizen . 
  it just means that they enjoy the privileges and obligations that it entails . 
  being british means that you are so culturally , ethnically or both . 
  example : in april 2013 , raoul wallenberg became the first person to be granted an honorary australian citizenship . 
  dose that make him australian ? 
  he 's swedish . 
  ethnically and culturally . 
  the swedish media loves doing this too .

  `` six swedes arrested for rape on a cruise ship . '',

  - metro . 
  `` several swedish men arrested for rape on cruise ship to finland . 
  `` six swedes arrested for cruise-ship rape . '', 
  - tt all of them were somalians with somalian citizenship . 
  they were not born in sweden . 
  they were not swedes , ethnically and culturally . 
  yet the media reported that they were swedes and it 's in line with this [ document/code of conduct from swedish state media ] ( http://www.svt.se/svts/article5384068.svt/binary/sverigespegling%20p%c3%a5%20svt%20nyheter.pdf ) . 
  `` avoid the word : immigrant . '', 
  `` we rather use swedish than swedish citizen to not distinguish between people . 
  if you want to be more precise , in cases where terrorism is involved use `` swede who have dealings with militant islamists . '', 
  `` language is power . 
  language is also politics .
