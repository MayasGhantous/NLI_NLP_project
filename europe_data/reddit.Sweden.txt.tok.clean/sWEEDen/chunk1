it 's just swedish culture plus what 's on your list and tango . 
  smirnoff is/was russian and absolut is/was swedish . 
  yeah , that would be sweet . 
  what a challenge though . 
  and finland is just the eastern part of sweden . 
  as a swede i would prefer a tunnel between germany and sweden . 
  in swedish : 1 . 
  nam 1 . 
  klunk 1 . 
  snark 1 . 
  hurra 1 . 
  shhh 1 . 
  aaaaaa 1 . 
  n\u00f6ff 1 . 
  tsss 1 . 
  ring ring / pling 1 . 
  historically we just `` den '' , but some thinks that is rude these these times . 
  can you elaborate on that , i do n't get your point . 
  i totally not dig having to pick the pamphlets openly in the hallway then walk in to the election booth with all those pamphlets clearly visible . 
  what if i went with my parents , neighbours or anyone else and at the same time want to seem certain about what i 'm about to vote on do i really have to grab 3x8 pamphlets just to keep the three i need ? 
  as long as we do n't change to an electronic voting system that would be even worse . 
  mona sahlin ( s ) had the toblerone scandal a long time ago . 
  gudrun schyman ( fi ) peed on the floor of a cinema or something , which was a scandal too . 
  do n't know if they are the biggest earlier blunders politicians in sweden has made or if there are other good examples . 
  yeah , the witchhunt will be on now . . 
  some people want to end their friendships with anyone who will admit that they voted on the sweden democrats . 
  on twitter/instagram it must be even worse . 
  not a whole lot of people would openly support the party , i think the more intellectual supporters keep themselves out of spotlight out of fear of getting branded . 
  if you come out as a sweden democrat the media will treat you like a pariah . 
  let 's just cede the whole country to germany . 
  [ quasimodo ] ( http://images4.fanpop.com/image/photos/18800000/quasimodo-quasimodo-18873431-960-536.jpg ) ? 
  that 's clever . 
  this is the official result site , which also updates live . 
  it 's pickled herring that we eat mostly . 
  surstr\u00f6mming or fermented herring is more of a traditional dish from norrland ( the most northern part of sweden ) . 
  we just like to brag about it because it 's rather unique . 
  how come devon has their own flair in this subforum ? 
  is there a strong wish there to break away from uk ? 
  nice speed but this is what ping should be like . 
  hey , scotland belongs to us . 
  they are our viking brethren . 
  argh , that 's sad to see . 
  i think it 's funny that riga used to be the largest city of sweden for a while . 
  this is great , i hope more people will sign . 
  you got it right , you are supposed to touch wood or knock on wood to prevent yourself from getting jinxed . 
  or at least that 's how it is here as well . 
  honestly i 'm starting to believe that the reason they grant this many asylums is to get more people willing to accept lower wages than they would have else . 
  it seems like what economists and politicians fear most is an increase in wages , what they want is a stagnated income rise . 
  what they do n't mind are inflations of prices of goods , services and housing . 
  no , not here in stockholm as the city takes it water from [ m\u00e4laren ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/m%c3%a4laren ) , it 's a fresh water lake until it reaches [ slussen ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slussen ) and connects to the baltic . 
  i do n't know if there 's any regulations in the city for as how much water you can use , but i have n't heard about it so it must be cool . 
  i was growing on my balcony before i got the allotment , but my cat always massacres them, 
  i grow plenty of things . 
  my vegetable garden has two kinds of sallad , mangold , spinach ( although the roe deer ate them all two nights ago ) , red onions , yellow onions , shallots , chives , japanese chives , potatoes , paprika and chili pepper , zucchini , tomato . 
  then there 's plenty of herbs like parsil , dill , oregano , spearmint and peppermint , lemon balm , hysop , thyme , sage , rosemary and lovage . 
  rhubarb too but i do n't know what category it falls under . 
  i also have three apple trees and a newly planted cherry tree . 
  some black and some red currant bushes , gooseberry and raspberries . 
  thats everything you can eat . 
  i got plenty of flowering and foliage plants too . 
  but everything is crammed together because it 's an allotment . 
  yeah , i know . 
  it 's not likely to happen . 
  the politicians here probably think they can reform them with welfare . 
  i 'm starting to doubt it . 
  wow , i 'm really jealous . 
  i 'm just waiting for the night temperature to rise again so my garden plants can grow properly now . 
  plus they do n't get fully pollinated now as the bumblebees and solitary bees are either slow or still not awake . 
  we do n't need [ wahhabi ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wahhabi ) muslims here in europe . 
  their ideology is dangerous and a threat to democracy . 
  i hope sweden will have the same courage if it will be needed . 
  hey , who stole our summer ?

  * tjottahejti i do n't know the etymology of the word though . 
  our top three guesses for your english dialect : 1 . 
  welsh ( uk ) 2 . 
  us black vernacular / ebonics 3 . 
  south african our top three guesses for your native ( first ) language : 1 . 
  norwegian 2 . 
  swedish 3 . 
  english i got no clue why they thought my dialect was welsh . 
  maybe i ca n't spell or something . 
  it 's easier as a swede to learn english then it is for a finn , because swedish and english are both germanic languages . 
  is n't the main concern protection of information and technology . 
  protecting business secrets is as far as i understand their goal . 
  at least we swedes , are very jealous of how liberal germany is compared to us . 
  an how well organized your country seem to be . 
  i feel like there 's no will to improve infrastructure and housing here . 
  ok , this is puppets theatre [ here ] ( http://goo.gl/maps/qx8k3 ) . 
  now just for the other building besides the road . 
  edit : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kiev_academic_puppet_theatre edit2 : i found a google maps picture with this description of the building . 
  https://ssl.panoramio.com/photo/64857023  monument to honor progoloshennya nezalezhnosti ukraine `` orans-ukraine '' then there is a comment on that picture describing the architecture of it . 
   plan : buildings - arch . 
  1936 - new interior design architect . 
  1943 - building and burned the book fund . 
  1954 - restoration architect .
