  there is a good chance we will not see the same pattern in the future if schools and health care keep going the way they do . 
  its funny how communists like you allways refer to wikipedia , try taking a university class and cite proper works that are not digestable over a sip of coffe . 
  liberty is a uniquely western idea , with us since the first hoplite charge in defense of his city state . 
  we have had periods of democracy and tyranny and everything in between , but the conversation is allways ongoing , and still is , or what do you think the eu is for ? 
  its funny you would cite colonization as an example of poor 3rd world countries when in fact , the only benefactors of of colonization were the local slavetraders and warlords working with european powers . 
  ultimately , had there been no colonization , all evidence points to africa still being uncivilized . 
  handing out a bounty of 150 000kr ( by the way , 1-2 % of total cost is a number pulled straight from the ass ) will turn every afghan father into an investment banker , he now has on average 11 different checks for 150 000kr if he can get them all across the swedish border to cash in . 
  i also dont see why immigrants would think to take 1-2 % of what the left wing is ruining the country for to give them . 
  they want the other 99 % of the cash , iphone \u00b4 s and messi jerseys are not cheap . 
  what are you going to do with the other 80 000 migrants who are going to get this 99 % ? 
  did they become free of charge because you sent the other 80 000 home with 150 000 ? 
  the day we deport 80.000 people is the day i regain confidence in this communist shithole . 
  i dont see how there are even 800 people that will be forcibly deported , you would have to be retarded as a migrant to actually get deported . 
  its sort of like a classroom thats overly full with roudy pupils and you say all cheaters will get caught , unless someone willfully turns themselves in to the teacher there are 0 people getting caught cheating . 
  u made sense in the beginning but this is just retarded , weve had partisan politics way before nazism , the moderates come from a period of a 2 party system that succeeded the monarchy + councillor system , they are in fact reactionaries to begin with . 
  you are very extreme and hold dangerous views , in sweden most industries are nationalized . 
  i agree that the social democrats fucked up the migrant crisis , to me it proves just how bad this model of taking ppls money to pay other people to do nothing really is . 
  i guess to you it proves that jews run the system and that we are committing genocide . 
  woah man , social democrats are wayyy to the left . 
  we have the highest taxes in the developed world , approaching 60 % + . 
  i \u00b4 d argue if half of the produce of your own labor is not your own , there is no longer any private property to speak of . 
  even more to the left of social democrats are v\u00e4nsterpartiet and milj\u00f6partiet . 
  v\u00e4nsterpartiet was formerly the swedish communist party , they just changed their name after the worst atrocities of communism became known in the west . 
  i vote for the moderates , i am not at all happy with the direction of the swedish centre-right as it is a traditional conservative movement and thus is essentially empty . 
  when they took power in 2006 it was because they made a huge turn to the left , giving up institutional reforms that would have been tough but needed . 
  i am actually increasingly thinking of turning in my citizenship and applying for norwegian citizenship or something thats more liberal . 
  there is a growing number of educated people who are leaving sweden . 
  yes precisely because i \u00b4 m swedish , i am exposed to a lot of communism on a daily basis . 
  the current socialist government is formed on support from communist parties which have about 10 percent of the vote . 
  socialism itself is a form of diet communism , not to be mentioned . 
  if you think greece is the result of capitalism , it shows this sort of simple-minded , deductive linear thinking of left-wingers . 
  see poor-people -  form emotional attachement -  see rich people -  errect false dichotomy which lets a correct sense of proportionality -  result in a conclusion that the rich people took the poor peoples money . 
  greece borrowed heavily at interest rates they would have never been able to get had they been outside of the eu . 
  that was their decision , nobody forced them to take on huge piles of debt . 
  greek voters just like the voters of any country have an insatiable appetite for goods and services , having been relatively poorer than other europeans , this creates jealousy and even envy and the low interest debt allowed them to rectify that , or so they thought . 
  there was an insane news report from an athens school during the crisis where a teacher was without pay just as the semester was starting , and she was standing there with the brand new ipads the school had bought for the students . 
  if greece had spent the money on more sensible things that could be termed investment , they could have earned a positive return on all the sovereign debt and paid off the debts at a profit . 
  but nobody likes that , saving , investing , working ... uhhhh boring !!, 
  i want an ipad like the rich kids . 
  those basic emotions is what makes the world and the economy tick . 
  what i never understood is how communists can accuse the upper class of greed and corruption , but never afford the lower classes the same criticism . 
  in the case of greece , lower class greed in the form of wanting things you cant afford met the upperclass greed of companies like apple to earn money . 
  match made in heaven . 
  greed is a very human trait , and all classes of society are human . 
  indeed , if anything , i \u00b4 d say the middle class is the only societal class that promotes a departure from the primitive human condition , but there are no size fits all solutions . 
  there are greedy upperclassmen , there are greedy lowerclassmen as well as nice people on both sides . 
  hey man , i appreciate your honesty and zeal , but i will never be able to agree with the slightest thing here . 
  i \u00b4 d encourage you to pick up a sport or go hunting in nature and tell me if you really think the way the world works is through conspiracy and repression or through individual effort . 
  to me this exchange has ** proven my original assertion that europe is a communist haven ** and this is why ** we dont see left wing extremists denounced the same way ** we see right wing extremists denounced . 
  so what you are suggesting is that the end justifies the means . 
  even if the communist utopia was possible which it is scientifically proven not to be , not 1 human life should have to be adversly affected for the outcome to happen . 
  also , what communists take seriously or not is not a good measuring stick , they dont value research and freedom , the fact that large numbers of them dont value stalin is because he has a poor brand value in the west . 
  you see people fond of trotsky still , even though he would have been just as bad . 
  its like how investment banks today dont advertise as much because they want to fly under the radar for a while . 
  i think i saw one this one time but he is gone now i think, 
  if you are a useless left winger and all you can do to make a living is pointing out flaws in the past with the benefit of modernity , you get to decide since in a democracy whoever is most numerous has power , and there are more useless people than useful . 
  again , you just proved my point that there are still communists out there and its socially acceptable to be positive of marx . 
  no , marx is not right , not even slightly . 
  the only correct part about your post is that you used the word debunked as it pertains to conspiracy theories , which is exactly what das kapital is, 
  do you and other people not see how much your own comments are proving my point ? 
  communists usually go on to say but stalin was a pioneer of communism , of course there were going to be mistakes but his hand was forced much of the time due to external threats like hitler but also internal turmoil like trotsky and others , he paved the way for revolution in latin america and china , etc etc, 
  i wish it were so , unfortunately communism is still considered a pg-13 ideology while nazism is synonymous with the devil it was . 
  there are still plenty of communist-parties in parliament in many western countries who would look at this picture and say `` well stalin was bad , but ... '' whereas there are no people to say the same thing for hitler . 
  im interested to hear more if you have the time !, 
  obviously the paper industry and other produce from timber is down , not gone completely but down , however it could be rechanneled into furniture/eco tourism or whatever . 
  as for it , i dont know if there is stuff nokia didnt produce , they certainly were huge , if you look where that stuff is all at now its in asia , i dont see how finland cant use their many skilled engineers to channel that into products for the service sector that are more on the intelectual side of property rather than hardware . 
  yes i agree , but institutional reform is no election-winner so thats why i think it will have to get a lot worse before something happens . 
  and sweden is going to be there in 1-2 decades as well when the last remnants of our industries are gone . 
  sweden and finland are both very similiar , we had forestry and it . 
  sweden had some other heavy industries like cars and shipping , but only some of the automobile industry remains and probably not much longer . 
  right now with low interest rates would be the perfect time to create scandinavia 2.0 , but instead we are borrowing money to finance immigration and our social costs like pensionsystems ... 
  its not just nokia \u00b4 s inability to adapt , finland has such a wonderful population with highly educated guys and girls but is married to a large wellfare state like the rest of the nordics . 
  norway is going south now too , people are blaming oil but it goes deeper than that . 
  small populations cant have a backup industry for everything so its important that the economy is dynamic and can shift rapidly , this unfortunately means that you cant have employment contracts to the grave and benefits without provisions . 
  i hope finland can get back on track , i suspect it will have to get ugly before it gets better though as i see no large innovations that could create the economic shift finland needs . 
  what surprises me is that they show such high levels of motivation in this instance , they built an impromptu fucking battering ram , but as soon as they reach a wellfare paying state , they become apathetic scroungers ... ? 
  obviously our climates are harmful to them or something . 
  they are polling at 16 % and unfortunately ruined swedens chances at having a pro-market government for the next decade . 
  they will be totally inconsequential since other parties refuse to accept their existence and it has sidetracked the entire country for the sake of not being labeled `` racists '', 
  heard of sweden ? 
  they had a nationwide concert here for refugees welcome with all the top billing talent . 
  songs about fuck borders , nobody is illegal and other far leftwing extremism was cheered on and raised millions in funds . 
  you think it \u00b4 d even be possible to mention a concert were top level artists sing `` dismantle wellfare programs '' `` free markets without regulation '' ? 
  people over here lose jobs and are ostraziced by the union if it is found out you vote for the sweden democrats , which are basically ukip . 
  i dont vote for them and neither will i ever be in a union , but fuck that shit hard , i have to put up with all this left wing shit and pretend to applaud so i \u00b4 m not `` outed '' as conservative , free market etc. 
  i agree with the reality you describe , not just the uk but all western education systems are this mix of classic style education meant to enhance kids intellects and modern style which is more vocational training . 
  the result of which is horrible , schools use ipads to teach kids how to read/write and do basic maths worse than with pen & paper and call it `` progress '' . 
  i think it comes down to the following question : even with a perfect education system , do you think all kids are able to be educated for the modern world ? 
  i have strong doubts . 
  its a struggle to get 100 % litteracy rates , now add html and the code of law ... that was sort of the meaning of my first post , i think the coming times will be difficult for a lot of people who just cant clear the higher bar placement . 
  why not both ? 
  its not teneable for lifelong taxpayers to perpetually subsidize the inability of certain people to realize their desires for higher standards of living . 
  that goes for all people , native or not . 
  its horribly dishonest to call this kind of economic activity `` investment '' , its charity , which is totally fine and amicable but dont mandate it on a government level . 
  a fucked up eu makes the uk leave however , which these pro-eu scroungers dont understand . 
  i would say its extremely illiberal and instead conformist political correctness . 
  if homosexuality was as hated as free-markets in europe , nobody at eurovision would bat an eye if a performance sleighted gays , as it would serve the status quo . 
  i know that ukraine wasnt the issue , but the thing that bugged me was the censorship , i dont believe it should have been censored for any reason . 
  yeah thats a real tough one to crack , maybe it has something to do with censorship ? 
  wild guess , totally not mentioned in my post and therefore doesnt cast any doubt on your reading comprehension skills .
