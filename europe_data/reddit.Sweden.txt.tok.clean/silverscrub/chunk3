  so fascist ? 
   clinton should be too . 
  it is n't racist , they are just shit presidents a more extreme version of * i have a black friend so i 'm not racist * . 
  on a serious note , are you saying you 're not racist just fascist ? 
  lynch the political opposition ? 
  i 'm sure you can imagine all these things . 
  tell me what a high effort meme is . 
   to be fair , obama was a really shitty president and probably should have been hung for treason if we actually still did that thing racist ways to start a reply to `` obama should be lynched '' : * to be fair . 
  was n't it turkey that blocked wikipedia by the way ? 
  turkish page has zero sources ( in the picture ) . 
  are you including pollution from producing for western countries in those estimations ? 
  that would kind of defeat the purpose of the comparison in the first place . 
  ca n't say it does n't exist but i have n't seen it outside of comedic sketches and stuff . 
  it 's not like alcohol is forbidden like during the prohibition in usa . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/systembolaget this only goes for selling alcohol in shops . 
  you 're allowed to sell alcohol in bars , restaurants and pubs if you have a permit . 
  when lidl came to sweden like 15 years ago people were talking about how they were preparing to sell alcohol in supermarkets , since the swedish state used to have a monopoly on selling drinks with more than 3 % alcohol . 
  they used to , and they still do too . 
  his legs stopped working and now he can only move by pulling himself forward . 
  [ i was curious how the map changed the last millions of years . 
  was n't it in 2015 that barely any countries wanted to help with the refugee crisis and the un refugee convention was n't enough since it was written for a case were most refugees had already migrated -- the issue that traveling across one country to seek asylum in the next one did n't exist back then . 
  not entirely sure what the immigration quotas are but it definitely sounds like something necessary in dealing with today 's refugees . 
  flair checks out . 
  sure !, 
  i did n't see anything against posts like this in the rules but i 'll try than subreddit instead . 
  * it 's not a long a complicated word if you separate every component with a space . 
  i doubt most people subscribe to the idea that muslims are terrorists , but the caricature of a conservative christian in usa is still a milder extreme so it probably gets passed as something with an ounce of truth to it . 
  there are always many different interpretations of a text . 
  i doubt the people who wrote the sign hade that one in mind . 
  i think christians gets a bad rep from how it 's depicted in usa . 
  not all of them think `` god hates fags '' and that god blessed the american invasions of countries in the middle east . 
  any particular reason why poland does n't like him ? 
  did n't they get fucked over pretty hard by nazi germany ? 
  hardly a top cartoon , but i put [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/r3fuh8h9bzi ) together this week . 
  at first it was just going to be the raw footage but i noticed it was really hard to seamlessly cut together sentences . 
  trump * constantly * keeps his mouth open between words . 
  but her emails in victory , but his emails in defeat .

  got any example of communism going to shit without the evil dictator ( like kkk would be an example for national socialism ) . 
  is that part connected to the ideology or the evil dictator ? 
  for me it 's mostly that ( in a simplified way ) ... * nazism = your people and your nation are worth more than others * communism = everything belongs to the people add an evil dictator and well things go to shit . 
  the holocaust goes in line with the ideology of nazism when taken to extreme lengths where as the killings by communist leaders is only indirectly connected to communism as an ideology ( perhaps as a mean to take control over the people under a false sense of `` the people own the state '' while it 's really being controlled by the dictator ) . 
  okay let me rephrase if you misunderstood me . 
  do you think trump will have an effect on the french election by showing france that * right-wing tactics * are bullshit ? 
  i do n't know , but do n't tell me trump was ever predicted to win . 
  i thought le pen had the same populist ideas with focus on the nation over cooperation with the region ( a la brexit , no tpp etc ) , anti-immigration and so on . 
  trump tactics does n't necessarily have to involve narcissistic lies and rants on twitter . 
  are you saying le pen voters do n't identify with trump voters ? 
  from what 's been going on here on reddit i 'd say they have a lot in common , or at least they seem to think so . 
  kind of like how left-leaning politicians in europe might identify with bernie sanders even though his politics might be considered closer to right-wing politics in that countries due to cultural differences . 
  i meant in the sense that what trump pulled on the american voters wo n't work again for le pen because you ca n't use the same hollow trick twice . 
  i wonder if trump 's presidency will have an effect on the french election . 
  it seems like similar parties got an upswing when he won but the longer he 's in office the more it turns out he 's really kind of shitty . 
  if america did n't liberate themselves from britain they would 've all spoken english today . 
  not sure . 
  it 's derived from the swedish pronunciation e-u-ropa . 
  probably does n't work as well with the english you-ropa or the german oi-ropa . 
  the euxtremists are coming . 
  [ have you tried using google translate as a proxy ? 
  ] ( https://www.labnol.org/internet/google-proxy-server/28112/ ), 
  i can agree to that . 
  do you mean like this ? 
   `` erdo\u011fan detractors have noted that under erdo\u011fan , more journalists have been incarcerated in turkey than in any other country , including north korea . 
  ** [ 24 ] ** '' i 'm guessing that the official story as told by erdo\u011fan differs from the one his detractors tell which is why it 's useful to know who said what . 
  you 're right in that the statistics ca n't be taken at face value but one could also make statistics over the number of coups , which are certainly not a sign of a society thriving in democracy . 
  i guess the `` including north korea '' could be a bit generous in it 's interpretation , unless we 're supposed to believe the source that north korea has incarcerated 0 journalists . 
  changing it to `` but due to the nature of these countries unrecorded incidents are to be expected '' would be a bit more neutral . 
  should probably take the statistics with a grain of salt . 
  the source has no registered incarcerated journalists in north korea . 
   erdo\u011fan detractors have noted that ** under erdo\u011fan , more journalists have been incarcerated in turkey than in any other country , including north korea . 
  ** [ 24 ] detractors have also pointed out the fact that the april referendum essentially nullified the traditional legal `` check '' of parliamentary fiscal review , that parliament had previously held over his executive branch of government . 
  [ 25 ] detractors have claimed that ** erdo\u011fan 's unceasing efforts at broadening his executive powers while also minimizing his executive accountability may amount to the `` fall of turkish democracy , '' [ 26 ] and the `` birth of a dictator . 
  '' ** [ 27 ] source : [ wikipedia . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/recep_tayyip_erdo%c4%9fan ) [ ( mobile version ) . 
  ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/recep_tayyip_erdo\u011fan ) [ there has also been people changing his title to `` dictator '' ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/special:mobilediff/775816964 ) . 
  erdo\u011fan probably does n't think very highly of wikipedia . 
  edit : i pointed it out in one of the comments but since people are unlikely to read all comments i will put it here too . 
  [ the source ] ( https://cpj.org/imprisoned/2016.php ) cited in the wikipedia article claims that turkey incarcerate more journalists than north korea but the only evidence for that is that north korea does n't appear in any of the statistics of the source . 
  that does n't take away from the fact that turkey appears in the stats every year since the start in 2000 ( except 2007 and 2008 ) . 
  they also top the stats in 2016 and 2012 , with 81 and 49 incarcerated journalists respectively . 
  it 's not just `` that one coup '' and '' * perhaps * not worse than north korea '' is not a good grade . 
  i know , and i said scotland wanted to say so they probably do see themselves as european . 
  do you think democrats in america all of a sudden agree with trump because he was elected ? 
  scotland wanted to stay and thus they wanted uk to stay . 
   also no , they just had a referendum on this and decided to continue taking decisions with the rest of the uk this part was a joke right ? 
  if you did n't cut off my sentence you 'd literally be agreeing with what you 're replying to . 
   scotland wanted the uk to stay this means uk including scotland stays . 
   they were n't asked about just scotland staying this means scotland breaks with uk and become their own country . 
  not something they necessarily want to do just because they feel different about the eu . 
  yes , and so i said that i thought the scots wanted to stay . 
  so all americans are automatically on the #maga train just because trump won too then ? 
  i thought scotland wanted to stay ? 
  not sure if you 're joking or not but usa is rated ` flawed democracy ' so not even then pass the test anymore . 
  i meant that he is already dividing the country over something that is bound to happen anyway . 
  sure , but  human -  human with tool is different than  human with tool -  just a tool, 
  yeah , it seems like he just put on his act rather than actually critiquing the food . 
   what happens if robots were to become that ubiquitous is yet to be seen and we do n't even know if it will happen any time soon or ** even ever .
