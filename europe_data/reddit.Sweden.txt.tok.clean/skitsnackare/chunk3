  this is n't the 1950s anymore where we needed finnish immigrants for our workforce . 
  sweden has at least 8 % unemployed rate , and this only includes people over 25 , those not going to school , and who are written as unemployed . 
  over 25 % of people under 25 in sweden are jobless . 
  most of our `` better '' immigrants are in school in sfi ( swedish classes ) . 
  and a good chunk of people are n't written as unemployed because they get support from their family instead . 
  this all makes a lot different statistic number . 
  sweden 's workforce does not need more people !, 
  it needs more actual jobs ; there is already a huge supply of educated potential workers . 
  wage dumping is all that will happen with taking in more workers , and it already happens way too much . 
  tl ; dr : most immigrants the us lets in are those who have money or already have a job set up . 
  yep . 
   give them greater control over it how does the eu have more control over the flow of refugees without the dublin rules ? 
   more immigrants that 's not what i said though  usa has only double the amount of refugees that sweden has ( in an outdated statistic ) , yet its land is over 8 times larger . 
   if syrians do come to the united states now how are they going to do that , exactly ? 
  they wo n't be able to get in the planes to get over there due to controls , unless they go through illegal methods and pay a lot for it . 
  all i was wondering is why the us government does n't seem to want to share any of the asylum burden . 
  they have a military presence already in syria , lots of airplanes and cargo ships going back and forth ... surely it would n't be too hard to take a couple thousand back with them every once in a while and give them `` the american dream '' ? 
  according to `` the economist '' , * increasing * wage dumping and increasing the burden on social welfare services is a positive thing to a country 's economy . 
  boy have i been wrong !, 
  not attacking you , but why does n't america take more refugees anyways ? 
  after all , usa is `` the big melting pot '' , innit ? 
  also a lot more open land etc for them to go to .

   i was not able to watch movies while traveling what do you mean ? 
  i could play netflix fine with traveling , as long as i did n't have vpn turned on . 
  only thing lacking was some stuff that did n't exist in my traveling region ; is that what you mean ? 
   i remember daredevil was delayed this is most likely because they had trouble getting subtitles made in time . 
  especially since they release the entire season at once : / swedish subs are usually made quickly so there is n't usually too much of a delay , but i know this happens to finnish netflix sometimes . 
  for some reason they require localized subtitles to be made before putting it out in those regions , so it 's a bit unfortunate to us who are fine with english . 
  her solution to lack of integration in sweden is to continue to increase the amount of newcomers we get . 
  because obviously the system is n't overloaded , so throwing all these people into slums that contain very few swedish people will totally make integration happen . 
  she can keep backpedaling all she wants , she is an awful person and hopefully no one eats it up . 
   negativ h\u00e4ndelse som intr\u00e4ffar * utan avsikt * fr\u00e5n de inblandade a plane crashing because of ( for example ) bad weather conditions is an olycka . 
  a plane crashing because someone broke into the cockpit and removed the pilot is not an olycka . 
  so i think she fully understood that olycka ca n't be used for an intentional act . 
  she says such stupid shit all the time ; there is no way it 's not part of her plan . 
  a native swedish speaker , such as \u00c5sa romson , would never use olycka as anything other than something that is purely accidental . 
  an olycka is * never * something that has intent in it . 
  so she knew damn well what she said . 
  but are n't those who enter [ fas 3 ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/fas_3 ) not considered as unemployed by scb ? 
  and those who go back to school when they ca n't find work -- even though they already have high qualifications -- also not counted in scb 's aku statistics ? 
   disgracing `` a foreign nation or a foreign state , its superior official , head of state , flag or other recognized symbol of nationality , the flag of the united nations or the flag of the council of europe '' is a criminal offence under art . 
  95 of the criminal code . 
  the punishment is a fine or imprisonment for up to two years . 
  in the case of a `` gross offence '' , the punishment may be imprisonment for up to six years . 
  the same punishments apply to disgracing , insulting or uttering defamatory insinuations about `` other employees of a foreign state present in [ iceland ] '' . 
  if you want to make an example of a country that is a bit more plaintiff-friendly in defamation suits , you 'd want to try usa . 
  but this wo n't work anyways , he would n't get asylum for this . 
  all we can hope for is the courts work it out and rule in b\u00f6hmermann 's favor and remove the law . 
  if not , maybe he just pay a small fine to appease some people . 
  there are many high-up germans who want b\u00f6hmermann prosecuted , particularly those who have not been happy with his previous acts . 
  most of those people who claim the prosecution is to respect erdogan 's honor is n't giving their full feelings on the matter . 
  the uk ? 
  even after the 2013 defamation act was passed , libel suits in the uk are generally not very plaintiff-friendly . 
  i imagine if b\u00f6hmermann was trialed in the uk , he would not win . 
  sounds weird that someone would think their neighbors would care less about your nation 's security than another country half way around the world ... but if you consider that the usa has just 5 % of the world 's population -- yet around 50 % of the world 's military expenditure , and adding onto how `` world police '' they are , i guess it 's not too unrealistic for people to see the us as the biggest ally . 
  how does my name check out ? 
  it was a policy change in 2011 to give permanent residence permits to syrians instead of the normal temporary permits . 
  previously , the policy was generally to only give temporary permits and have them be renewed after 2 years . 
  but because migrationsverket are lazy and has said that `` the situation does not seem likely to improve in the near-future '' , they changed the policy . 
  ich will has still been censored ? 
  i thought they just did n't air the music video when it was supposed to be due to the attacks . 
  kinda sad if so , it honestly has a good message . 
  did she apply and get a ut-kort as your sambo , or is she here as an eu citizen ? 
  if she got an ut-kort , she should make sure she is written as arbetsf\u00f6rmedlingen . 
  if she is also under 25 , and has been written there and searching work for the past 3 months , she will be allowed into `` jobbgaranti f\u00f6r ungdomar '' program and get around 3000 a month from f\u00f6rsakringskassan . 
  if she is over 25 i think there is another program , but need to wait more months to be let into it iirc . 
  not a super lyx thing but could help with a bit of money if it 's an issue at all . 
  eh , bostadsbidrag is still pretty generous . 
  sure you are n't going to get a place on norrmalmstorg with it , but there are still decent places . 
  ( of course this is considering you can find available housing in the first place ... ), 
  it depends . 
  originally they were supposed to be just temporary residence permits , which is for 2 years . 
  then when they renew , there is a chance it will become perm . 
  once they have that , it 's pretty difficult to make them leave . 
  one big fuck-up that sweden has made now in the past 5 years is from laziness : by default , anyone claiming to be a refugee from syria is given a permanent residence permit , not the normal 2 year temporary permit . 
  so these people will probably never leave , other than on their own decision ... which i ca n't say i am too expecting of . 
  well , adultery is/was criminalized during the years clinton was in office ... so technically what he supposedly did was n't fully legal , but i think most people do n't get charged for it unless it 's in a divorce court . 
  so basically you want to be prescribed marijuana for your ptsd ? 
  sorry then , i do n't know much about that ; have you asked those people who were successful from uk/scandinavia ? 
  i just am not too sure how one would be able to arrange it ... even if one were prescribed marijuana in the netherlands , would a pharmacy in their home-country dispense it -- much less even have it in stock ? 
  but i wish you luck , hopefully you find a solution . 
  what is your illness and current country of residence ? 
  [ ehic ] ( http://www.imtj.com/news/european-health-insurance-card-ehic-not-medical-tourists/ ) is not intended to be used in the way it sounds like you are describing . 
  the formal way to go about doing would be to become a resident in the other country , with plans to stay there for a long amount of time after your treatment is handled ( aka pay back in taxes etc ) . 
  otherwise , you are doing medical tourism which is not the intention of ehic and is generally not very nice to the country you are visiting . 
  unless you 're describing just getting medicine prescribed ? 
  the way you explain it without much backstory makes it hard for me to understand if you are needing some special operation ( `` illness not treated well '' ) , or if there is some drug you need prescribed that is not allowed in your country ? 
  so please give more backstory if i did n't explain good enough , 
  yeah , and i assume it 's the same in spain as it is in sweden ? 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urgcz15cdga still awful what they did , no one should be attacked , but the beggars are typically not refugees . 
  i use chrome if i am watching netflix , the subtitles are really big though . 
  just another reason why sometimes it just becomes nicer to open the file in vlc/etc instead . 
  if i have to do anything bypass netflix 's geographic restrictions , for me the easiest solution is to find a 1080p bluray rip/web-dl of the content with english subtitles built in . 
  ( ignoring really obscure or old stuff , of course ) have n't tested any alternatives in sweden sadly ; if i want to watch some tv series it 's usually on svtplay/tv4play/some other official site . 
  even in that case i usually end up using svtplay-dl and playing it through vlc ... maybe i am weird , but it always feels best to simply have video files if possible . 
  i do n't typically try to avoid giving the publishers money ... but if i need to go through hoops to get something to play in good quality and have flexible settings , the more straightforward decision is that with no drm/etc . 
   the rapes were n't reported until several days after ah yeah , there 's the kicker . 
  if only they went into the hospital for one quicker , they could have hopefully gotten a trace then . 
  none of those who were assaulted ( in ways other than `` just '' groping ) had any kind of rape kit taken ?
