  i saw this too . 
  specifically the cops standing on the right corner of the tall black scaffolding structure , around 08:15 gmt +1 ( jan 22 ) . 
  they threw all the molotovs they could get their hands on , along with rocks , straight at the civilians . 
  i 'll throw in a packet of butter for good relations . 
  i * did * say  not that i see boxing as a problem i was commenting on  if you 're an adult you should have control over what happens to your body examples of behavior that heavily affects medical costs is the use of tobacco and alcohol . 
  now , in sweden these products are heavily taxed , but the taxes far from cover the total medical costs of the consumers , and the load is placed on everyone , even if you never smoke a single cigarette or drink a single bottle of beer . 
  physical exercise is great , including boxing , in my opinion . 
  and if you absolutely have to punch someone , who better than someone willing to be punched ? 
  and do n't get me wrong , i like beer too . 
  `` what happens to your body '' ends up in hospitals paid by me and all the other tax payers . 
  not that i see * boxing * as a problem in that context , keeping yourself fit is just good and keeps you out of the hospital more often than not . 
  get out of here with your facts , you 're ruining our intrafennoscandian rhetoric . 
  ... finland ? 
  i did n't know you were so ... * queeer * . 
  except vampires . 
  but you have four digits in your number . 
  that 's different . 
  do n't question the facts and accept that we 're in the lead . 
  or last , depending on perspective . 
  i do n't see what all the fuss is about . 
  never mind finland . 
  they can sneak up on the us navy , they can probably hide from russians . 
  well * duh * , they 're not supposed to be found . 
  that 's actually the only reason estonia has n't into nordic yet . 
  they do n't fit into the nordick model . 
  do n't be ridiculous . 
  would you rather see it go `` stop , or we will bomb moscow '' ? 
  that 's anecdotal evidence , not empiricism . 
  not from my perspective . 
  you do n't bomb the belief , you bomb the actual people who rape and pillage . 
  it * is * a pretty effective method to make them stop raping and pillaging . 
  tl ; dr : the mg42 is a gpmg , general purpose machine gun . 
  heavy machine guns are generally in calibers larger than 12.7 mm , where the mg42 is in 7.92 mm . 
  at least she 's not asking random people to push stop buttons . 
  oh , you 're one of * those * guys , are n't you ? 
  do you have a yellow reflex vest too ? 
  suck it , danskj\u00e4vlar !, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ love ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ you ~, 
  i 'm actually looking at one right this moment . 
  i 'm a swedish guy and i do n't know any male person who shaves their armpits . 
  russia is known to do that . 
  they are presently invading ukraine . 
  come on , it 's not like you 're * danish * . 
  why would they ever do that ? 
  wait , is portugal to spain like denmark to sweden ? 
  interesting . 
  please finland . 
  canada is america 's sweden , not the other way around . 
  also you are also sweden . 
  you have a nice cock . 
  i like it . 
  swedish cooperation with finland is one of the best things we did during ww2 in my opinion . 
  finns are good people . 
  those look delicious . 
  and they sure are buns . 
  [ here you go !, 
  ] ( https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/herp-derp-for-youtube/ioomnmgjblnnolpdgdhebainmfbipjoh ), 
  why not use latin ? 
  it worked for the romans . 
  maybe an armed revolt ? 
  well , being gay in secret would n't turn all the poor unsuspecting children into gayness now , would it ? 
  do n't worry , we also learn about eastern european hate for queer people . 
  we get enough of slavic languages in online gaming . 
  for example , i know that `` good work team '' is `` cyka blyat '' in russian . 
  your gaming community does n't help your image . 
  i 'm starting to get prejudice against russians from just playing multiplayer games . 
  you 're gon na summon something if you keep that up . 
  or maybe we already speak english and spanish/french/german well enough not to need duolingo , so it 's primarily used by people coming from abroad trying to learn swedish . 
  in particular [ the transition * from * communism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/privatization_in_russia ) . 
  cut them off !, 
  but her emails ? 
  that 's interesting . 
  but how do you prove your age when buying alcohol then ? 
  wait , you do n't ? 
  i 'm not so sure , do you really think nice could fill the void of all of britain ? 
  political motivation . 
  the whole video feels like one of those tv hidden camera prank sketches . 
  i was just waiting for the driver to step out and point to the camera and they all have a laugh . 
   except of course if we were standing side by side with them , in which case we could look down upon them . 
  is this an evolutionary trait in order to survive in case the sea walls fail ? 
  it 's a little harsh calling trump `` imitation cheese '' . 
  `` also , in unrelated news , i will be holding a cheese a cheese party for my most influential friends . '', 
  and perhaps israeli ? 
  such is his natural state . 
  he 's showing quite some restraint , but the nodding approval shines through . 
  that 's actually how their government works . 
  the president absorbs the happiness of the rest of the finns . 
  what a waste of * a * money . 
  could someone tell me : * is that a real sub ? 
  * is it about man holes or manholes ? 
  i 'm kind of interested in manhole porn , but not so interested in man hole porn . 
  in a pineapple under the sea ? 
  where did they put the swedish flag from the old photo ? 
  thanks for an interesting article . 
  that makes your already awesome coat of arms even better . 
  heraldry is interesting . 
  edit : the broken chains are also worth mentioning . 
  that 's interesting , why 's that ? 
  i thought those were the high speed intercity bikeways . 
  what about the children losing their families and being forced out of their homes due to war in their home countries ?
