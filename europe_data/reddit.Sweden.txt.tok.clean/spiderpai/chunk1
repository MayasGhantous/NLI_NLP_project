i am not aligned with any party or block but i say , that we can always do better . 
  at first i read it as random ... 
  oh well , i have been living pretty close to them , they have always seemed proud to be part of the scandinavian family , 
  i am currently working in helsinki and usually i say : southern sweden/scanian . 
  in feelings/categorizing it would go something like : human  scanian  swedish  scandinavian  european  earth citizen . 
  where did you hear that ? 
  fair enough  it does show up as the oldest city in sweden on google . 
  there is also a really neat medieval festival week each year in visby , recommend going there  :, 
  the best one to show from sweden would probably have been visby , never heard of sigtuna ( doenst even look old :p ) :o there are plenty of good alternatives : examples : http://media2.retromance.se/2014/02/gotlandsbilder-visby-dimma-ringmur-db292_4133.jpg http://media.gotlandsbild.com/2014/01/gotland-visby-johan-m%c3%a5lare-vinter-1.jpg http://instructor.se/onewebstatic/29135ddd77-visby%20del%20av%20miur.jpg, 
  yes , and then buy new ikea furniture . 
  the stockholm dialect is quite close to the stereotypical `` gay lisp '' http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gay_lisp ( though it is probably more the \u00d6stermalm dialect but people insist that scanian is one dialect so why not generalize this one as well ? ), 
  i do not think anybody considers it a delicacy :p , it is more of a traditional/daring thing :3, 
  well apparently very acceptable since sweden did similar things but on a larger scale and worse with freedom fighters in east denmark , now southern sweden . 
  the current situation and history of sweden and finland is almost identical to this . 
  germany has more slots though :p, 
  well that is what they are , a tourist attraction . 
  it isnt as if we have real monarchies . 
  i know quite a lot of history , enough to not praise it all and acknowledge the bad parts that get hidden with state propaganda . 
  there is no real point for the current monarchy though ( that couldnt be done by a representative/president ) , monarchy is just a very old name for dictatorship . 
   is even taught in our schools , did you miss it ? 
  no need to be condescending i did learn german in school , it also helps if you supply the reference of your quotation . 
  though i admit i kind of said what my impression was a bit too straight forward . 
  it was mainly stockholm that became a german trading hub ? 
  in majority of the cases its not really loan words since we are both germanic languages . 
  this makes me think that you are from stockholm , most have the stereotypes of stockholm likes this : stockholm - arrogant and obnoxius but fabolous, 
  yea , i imagine that you need to either be into economics or live in stockholm to be aware of it . 
  i have never heard of it though , and i am a swede of higher education ... 
  i mean i probably would have guessed something by that name would exist but still . 
  technically if you do not gravel or salt your road during winter , that could happen . 
  real sorry about that :(, 
  that might have to do with the large influence of american pop-culture , but it is not really a mature thing anyhow . 
  first of , he is nordic not scandinavian . 
  secondly he is a fin , they are like this to everyone . 
  thirdly it is pretty obnoxious of you to refer to scandinavians as if it is as unified as uk and not separate countries . 
  yea it is really annoying , malm\u00f6 is probably my favorite city and the one i feel the most safe in , of the larger swedish cities . 
  they are still kind of considered outrageous . 
  i know a lot who voted on center who got reaaaally disapointed . 
  most immigrants are from finland , denmark and norway though . 
  it is usually a good thing that people prefer your country to others . 
  there obviously is a lot of back and forth though between these countries . 
   storkyrkan and riddarholmskyrkan are something like ~ 40 sek . 
  many other beautiful churches in stockholm that are free , but woops thats correct . 
   this is fairly common in stockholm , as well , but then again everything is incredibly expensive ... really ? 
  yeay , go space !, 
  go uk !, 
  :d i recall that there is a danish company as well . 
  i really hope some swedish companies will join the race soon , 
  eh , eu is one of the reasons it is so easy to work inside of europe . 
  i dont say that i trust all the old economy people and i dont really believe they are going to be nice to the younger generation ( but this would still be the same with or without eu ) . 
  the european union in itself is a great thing for europe and the world . 
  pretty much all finns say swedes are smug , but what does that come from ? 
  pretty much all finns hold grudges towards sweden , even if they do n't like to admit it . 
  :( the cause is usually one sided black and white history lessons and because they have to learn swedish all the way up to university . 
  would love some reference for this stuff , i know that this is the general idea about nato but i have never heard that it was similar before we joined eu . 
  als you guys went all in with the euro and all , 
  good job  !, 
  honestly it feels pretty good that southern countries get to top some lists considering all the shit you guys have been getting . 
  huh , i was pretty sure i read that it was raised since the paris incident . 
  the reason it got raised to level 3 was because of the deash insanity in paris . 
  this usually inspires unstable twats , just like with school shootings . 
  we also have some small forces still in iraq to help things out , who knows anything is apparently reason enough . 
  i wouldnt be too worried though , especially compared to a lot of french cities which has constant shootings . 
  i am also moving to g\u00f6teborg soon , 
  honestly the `` tjena , tjena '' feels very insulting when it is used by gypsi beggars :( it is supposed to be a warm and friendly phrase . 
  instead it is learned for the sole reason of trying to make people give you money , gives it a creepy vibe . 
  people should not give money to beggars and instead help them get rid of that lifestyle , it is not as if our society has failed them . 
  honestly people are way too naive if they think it is coldhearted to not give to beggars . 
  we swedes had a nuclear bomb facility at one point though . 
  shrug , dunno . 
  world police terms , its not illegal , but they are not super stable country neighbors . 
  all about mood and lighting  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/riksdagshus_entre_2007_1.jpg, 
  reminds me of https://youtu.be/vlmrzdgkwi0?t=170, 
  it 's so stupid though , we dont have that awesome castles and cathedrals and we already have mini mountains as a skyline . 
  rather have smart living spaces . 
  if it helps we do that too \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af , fortunately for us you guys take the spotlight because you guys are a larger nation . 
  we do get a lot of shit for other stuff though . . 
   my favourite thing about this is that all the anti-eu brits can complain about ` europe ' all they want - we are european regardless of eu membership this !, 
  it puzzles me how british papers always write about europe or mainland europe as if it would be a separate entity like asia or the us . 
  truth be told , they are about as separated from europe as sweden , malta is probably more disconnected than britain . 
  almost a delusional amount of distancing , no offense meant , i like you guys even with your questionable decisions . 
  good joke !, 
  we swedes sure like ourselves a good bullying time . 
  i 'm doing my part !, 
  okay , i see your meta thread reference there . 
  sure thing !, 
  \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af i only wanted to make a joke . 
  but that does n't seem to be allowed !, 
  no , we are all barbarians , you just take your siesta and let the world roll by . 
  for what it is worth , i loved budapest . 
  and now you are making me hungry . 
  or maybe its a combination of being a semi island nation like britan and a lot of not being a huge dick and compromises . . oh wait technically we do look like a huge dick geographically but you get the point . 
  like we even lost \u00c5land without starting a war about it ... 
  lol , you cearly dont want to read and understand history but soley have a blame game . 
  it is only cold when you can taste the blood . 
  because it is in the moment of turning its torso . 
  turned torso doesnt sound as good  https://en.wikiarquitectura.com/images/thumb/d/d5/turning_torso_concepto.jpg/250px-turning_torso_concepto.jpg to be fair though , i thought the same when i was younger . 
  it will be a bit bad , but it will be extremely bad for the uk, 
  we never were speaking english because of you . . 
  well there was sweden at least . 
  can you give back the german phrase books from ww2 first ?
