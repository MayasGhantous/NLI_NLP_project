when generally eu-cautious nordic pms warn of this ... do note that the current swedish prime minister has been at the job for less than two months . 
  what he says should n't really be compared to what the previous prime minister ( 2006-2014 ) said or did . 
  the previous prime minister ( fredrik reinfeldt ) was moderate/conservative , while the current prime minister ( stefan l\u00f6fven ) is a social democrat . 
  nah , when east asians do it it 's lacism . 
  most swedish cemeteries have the little gardens too . 
  * skogskyrkog\u00e5rden * ( `` the forest cemetery '' ) is an exception , as its name implies . 
   not that hard to understand . 
  that 's what i thought too , until i met someone from the far north . 
  it 's interesting to meet someone who supposedly speaks the same language as you , but who you ca n't understand at all . 
  not one word . 
   finland swedish speaker i would say . 
  the two diverged about 60 years ago , and there are actually pretty significant differences now . 
  no more different than swedish dialects are from each other . 
  as someone from southern sweden , it 's much easier to understand someone from finland than someone from northern sweden . 
   every moroccan i 've known adores their king , everything that seems so silly to me is just normal for them . 
  there 's plenty of european royalty too . 
  england , sweden , denmark , norway , spain , etc. 
  most of them are popular ( or they would n't still be around ) . 
  of course , most of them also do n't build any new palaces . 
  sounds like something a politician would say . 
  unfortunately , not everything can be solved by talking . 
  it only works if both sides are willing to listen and both sides are open to the possibility that they might be wrong . 
  less than that , as i recall . 
  this was more about the principle of the thing than the amount of money involved . 
  the fact that it ends up being a much bigger burden for poor people than rich people probably did n't help its popularity either . 
   swedish decision to circumvent the peace process and impose her own will is more offensive than words . 
  you do realize that [ most of the world ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_recognition_of_the_state_of_palestine#mediaviewer/file:palestine_recognition_only.svg ) recognized palestine long ago ? 
  virtually everyone except western countries already recognizes palestine , and several eu member countries already did . 
  sweden 's recognition is actually quite unremarkable . 
  plenty of other countries have done the same . 
   ... their straight no-bullshit talk ... 
  this is n't straight no-bullshit talk . 
  this is offensive nonsense that does more harm than good . 
  it 's an excellent example of what ** not ** to say in international politics . 
  it 's like he 's actively * trying * to offend every country in the world . 
  the starting point is shortly after wwii , right as the cold war started . 
  the spending was justified at the time as there was a very real threat to defend against . 
  hopes for and welcomes , certainly . 
  expects , not really . 
   i am kind of happy never 2014get did n't become the new national trauma . 
  possibly because you ca n't actually pronounce it without ruining the joke . 
  the offer was n't in any way `` free '' . 
   my guess is some swedish politicians would love to see sweden joining the nato . 
  the right-wing parties are leaning that way . 
  the left-wing parties seem sure that war is n't going to happen ever again in scandinavia and that no threat exists . 
  during ww2 , both sweden and finland had actual armies . 
  today , not so much . 
   overtly invading another peaceful sovereign nation without provocation , without any kind of casus belli or justification , other than `` let 's just take this land lol '' ? 
  they 'd obviously make up some excuse . 
  i guess there 's not a whole lot to do in greenland except murdering each other . 
   you love foreigners there , but you have restrictions on the amount that can work there !, 
  maybe that 's why they love foreigners : none of them are allowed to overstay their welcome . 
   there are open source projects which would be more than happy to accept your money and bring you ( and everyone else aswell ) a lot better solutions than what proprietary tech can . 
  if the solutions were better to anyone other than the people coding them , they could have just sold that . 
  far too often the underlying code may be good , but the interface is unintuitive or needs polish . 
   unless you want to do 3d effect ... why would anyone want to do 3d effects on a website ? 
  other than web designers who love making sites that users hate , that is . 
  it 's presumably in both italian and english inside already . 
  i guess what language it should be on the outside is debatable . 
  currently my swedish passport has everything in both swedish and english inside but only swedish text on the outside . 
  most legalese only has to be repeated once , though . 
  updated each year to represent the current state of the economy ? 
  it 's an extra fast passport . 
  neat but hideous . 
  nice use of color on the inside but a very dull outside that tries to be `` quirky '' a bit too hard . 
  i think the overall effect would have been cooler if the outside was square . 
   a bunch of non-kurds going to fight for the kurdish forces is strange . 
  should n't be too odd considering they 're getting other aid from the west . 
   should n't there be repercussions for refusing , and trying to delegitimise outcomes ? 
  it 's mostly about voter perception . 
  the decision is seen as less legitimate but the people abstaining are seen as childish . 
  both will have some effect in the next elections . 
   why do the pm and cabinet get to vote in parliament in the first place ? 
  because they were elected . 
  cameron is an elected member of parliament . 
  he gets to vote because he 's one of the members of parliament , not because he 's the prime minister . 
   what happened to separation of powers ? 
  a prime minister is not at all equivalent to a president . 
  the post is elected by parliament , not directly by the people ( though parties are clear in advance about which prime minister they 'd nominate ) . 
  there has been at least one polish astronaut , actually . 
  poland also joined the esa in 2012 , so there will probably be more in the near future . 
  quite a few differences , actually . 
  it 's clearly the same painting , but the lights in the windows on the left have been changed ( some are more orange , some less ) , the lantern on the left has been moved ( and now actually has a reflection ) , there 's a new gate in the wall on the left , the tree in the top right has grown much bigger , the house on the right is lower and has a door where there was a window , and the buildings in the background are slightly different . 
  judging by all the reports of people going there and then realizing what a terrible idea that was , the best way to educate people about how stupid it is to want to join isis seems to be to let them meet isis . 
  they might , but not by a lot . 
  the social democrats have far too many pro-nuclear voters to actually do much . 
  they have to appease their green coalition partners by making vague anti-nuclear statements while at the same time not alienating all the industry workers who vote for them by risking higher energy prices . 
  the same tradition exists at lund university . 
  same time every day during exam weeks , like clockwork . 
   i do n't know why but i get an 80 's -90 's vibe from that pixel art . 
  probably because that 's when the style originated . 
  back then it was necessary due to technical limitations . 
  most pixelated artwork these days is going for a retro style ( unless it 's just going for cubism in general ) . 
   if you are someone like max huber or jan tschichold i would listen your constructive criticism about the design of these banknotes . 
  but i doubt you even know who they are . 
  this is exactly the kind of attitude that results in shitty banknotes that everyone hates and ugly buildings that no one likes . 
  if people do n't `` understand '' the art , that 's not because people are too uneducated to appreciate the art . 
  it 's because the art sucks and fails at the basic artistic virtue of communicating . 
  if your goal is to convey something and it 's not conveyed , it 's not the recipient that failed - it 's ** you ** . 
  if most people think your art is ugly , your art is ugly .
