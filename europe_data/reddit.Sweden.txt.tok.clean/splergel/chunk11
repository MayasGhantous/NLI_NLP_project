  objection . 
  by * most * reasonable measures , male circumcision is * less * harmful than female circumcision . 
  saying it 's `` far '' less is subjective and adds nothing but emotion to the argument . 
  it can also be argued that male circumcision is worse on account of being more widespread ( i personally do n't think that 's a good argument , but it is a valid point ) . 
  either way , the argument is n't really about which form of genital mutilation that is worse , but whether we should be treating it as two completely separate issues or as two aspects of one larger problem . 
   but calling it male genital mutilation shows your ignorance . 
  it does involve mutilating the genitals of male infants , so the name makes sense . 
  i do n't personally think it 's a very good term and would n't introduce it into a conversation , but since the poster i was replying to called it `` mgm '' , i used that term too . 
   wtf . 
  democracy just means majority rule . 
  stuff like free speech belongs to not democracy but to liberalism i.e. 
  to liberal democracy . 
  free speech is necessary for a democracy to actually function in practice , though . 
  if you 're not allowed to discuss issues , you ca n't make any meaningful decisions on those issues . 
  democracy means majority * rule * , not just majority-gets-to-put-paper-in-a-box . 
   what you 're saying is that i should accept that men have stronger feelings about a much less harmful involuntary surgery done to men than a much more harmful involuntary surgery done to women . 
  just because * you * consider it `` much less harmful '' does n't mean everyone else has to agree with you . 
  whether something is harmful enough to be a serious problem or not is entirely subjective . 
  there 's also little to say that all the people disagreeing with you are men . 
  and even if that 's the case , their gender is entirely irrelevant to the validity of their point . 
  you may argue otherwise , but unless you can actually * prove * otherwise that 's just , like , your opinion , man . 
   however , it 's impossible to have a discussion about fgm on reddit without it getting absolutely drowned in comments about mgm . 
  reddit has a branching threaded format , so it 's possible to have multiple discussions in one thread . 
  the fact that someone brings up mgm in a thread about fgm does n't mean all other discussion has to stop . 
  just accept that some people have very strong feelings about that subject and move on to the other comments . 
   because london went through the exact same process once . 
  that 's entirely irrelevant in the context of `` most toxic town on the planet '' , which is what the headline is saying . 
  if you only look at the western world , you can proclaim london to be the most toxic town * in the western world * , but as it stands the title is bullshit . 
  i think the more relevant question is at what point hate speech should no longer be covered by free speech . 
  just because something is hateful does n't mean it should automatically be illegal . 
  any time a government tries to dictate what its opposition can or ca n't do , you should be wary regardless of which side you sympathize with . 
  it 's not always a question of what the current government can use those laws for , but what whichever government comes after can do with them . 
  i do n't think there really are two sides to the coin . 
  the second you ban political views to protect democracy , you lose the democracy you 're trying to protect . 
  if you accept the idea that legislators are better suited to determining whether someone is fit to rule than voters are , you might as well do away with elections entirely . 
  a choice between parties that have been approved by the currently ruling party is not a choice at all - it 's just a charade . 
  german and nordic languages have that feature , yes . 
  it tends to add some level of meaning beyond just the combined words , though . 
  for example , the swedish * skadegl\u00e4dje * consists of the words for injury ( * skada * ) and joy ( * gl\u00e4dje * ) , but the order of the words tells us that that it describes a joy that is caused by the injury . 
  the same as the german * schadenfreude * , which is similarly constructed . 
  english does n't really allow for that same level of implication . 
  he already removed the dash from it . 
  seems the brits are n't the only ones you 're exporting to . 
  i was staring at both kinds of bacon in the store yesterday , both from denmark . 
  went with the former , obviously . 
  for some reason the only swedish bacon available in sweden is the lousy kind . 
  i 'm not trying to defend the swedish press , just the swedish freedom of the press . 
  it 's in the constitution ( * tryckfrihetsf\u00f6rordningen * , which is somewhat confusingly a * grundlag * and not at all a * f\u00f6rordning * ) . 
  the political correctness of swedish media is entirely self-imposed . 
   sorry mate but you have a faulty understanding of how police forces work . 
  and i think you have an overly pessimistic view of the loyalties of the average police officer . 
  they 're not paid enough to take part in any grand conspiracy , so if you change the law they 'll uphold the new law . 
   they are n't actually democratic though . 
  depends on which country you 're in . 
  even when the system is n't perfect , it 's usually possible to enact social change through the system if you have enough support . 
  and if you do n't have enough support for that , most people do n't * want * you to be in power and would just overthrow your new government if you did manage a successful revolution . 
   the only successful revolutions that can be argued to have overthrown capitalism were not `` democratic '' in the sense you are using `` democracy '' - liberal electoral politics . 
  most of those new governments collapsed , though . 
  with china effectively having reverted back to a mostly capitalist system , there are n't really any communist countries left that are n't destitute . 
  so there arguably have n't been ** any ** successful revolutions that have overthrown capitalism , democratic or otherwise . 
  that does n't mean it ca n't or should n't be done * somehow * , just that no method has a good track record . 
   there 's no point in attacking cops if there 's no chance of a revolution occurring and the cops are trying to stifle it . 
  how about left wing activists like afa attacking non-violent far right manifestations ? 
  the typical result is just the alienation of people who might support the cause if the extremists had been more tolerant of people with different opinions . 
  with the soviet union in recent memory , people are obviously ** very ** wary of any left wing movement that does n't tolerate political opposition . 
  no one wants to give * any * power to people who aspire to tell others which opinions are acceptable and which ones are not . 
   they exist to ensure that no consciousness of workers actually translates into real meaningful change or any alteration of the current class structure of society . 
  the police exists to uphold the current laws . 
  if you do n't like what they do , there are democratic systems in place to allow you to change what those laws are . 
  the police is n't for or against any side . 
   people who do the above no matter what will almost certainly never achieve their goals . 
  it 's not possible . 
  short of a full revolution that successfully overthrows the government , violent methods have a terribly poor track record in terms of achieving goals . 
  far more political change has been achieved by democratic means than nondemocratic ones . 
  no social change is going to last unless you can get a majority of the population on board anyway . 
  there are plenty of people who want to create a classless and stateless society who do n't feel the need to throw stones at the police . 
  it 's a good guess and usually right . 
  it is still just a guess , though . 
  they should be free to fly the flag if they want to , though . 
  regardless of how you feel about israel , flying the flag of a country does n't justify violence . 
   oh wait , it was a peaceful protest and it was actually the neo-nazis that came and attacked the demonstration throwing bottles at families and others . 
  it goes both ways , yes . 
  extremists on both the left and right are equally shitty . 
  there 's no shortage of examples of peaceful right wing manifestations that got attacked by left wing activists . 
  the swedish press is free to write pretty much anything they want as long as it 's not slander , and even that is very rarely prosecuted . 
  most newspapers voluntarily adhere to unusually strict press ethics , though , and generally do n't publish any details about someone suspected or convicted of a crime . 
  they 're not legally forbidden from doing so , but choose not to . 
   svea hovr\u00e4tt for any non-swedes reading this , a * hovr\u00e4tt * is a swedish court of appeals , the second highest level in the swedish legal system . 
  there are six such courts each serving a region . 
  svea hovr\u00e4tt serves the stockholm region , which is 600 km away . 
  it has never had any jurisdiction over malm\u00f6 ( * g\u00f6ta hovr\u00e4tt * predates the [ treaty of roskilde ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_roskilde ) ) and no crime committed in malm\u00f6 is ever going to end up in svea hovr\u00e4tt . 
   there are more bad news from malm\u00f6 because that is where they happen . 
  not really . 
  there 's more violent crime in gothenburg and stockholm than in malm\u00f6 . 
  it 's just less interesting to write about , because everyone `` knows '' that malm\u00f6 is the problem city . 
  you wo n't notice it if you actually come here , though . 
   i 've no idea of the standings . 
  well , in case you want to be able to pretend that you 've been keeping up all along , it 's currently down to the semifinals with germany facing brazil tomorrow and the netherlands facing argentina the day after . 
  no obvious winner in either game , but a 50 % chance that a pair of neighboring countries will be duking it out in the final on sunday regardless . 
  if you mean that it 's ( in ) conveniently far away from where all national media is based , getting covered by journalists who have never actually been there and themselves only know what they 've read about it ... yes .
