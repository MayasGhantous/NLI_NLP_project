  that 's the highway speed limit . 
  most roads are 90 km/h , and speed limits within cities vary between 30 and 70 km/h ( with 50 being by far the most common ) . 
  would they be able to fight it without vodka , though ? 
  morale would be terrible . 
   you ca n't have too much of `` worse evil '' , as some point the system will break ; but you can have a lifetime of `` lesser evil '' that just keeps going and going . 
  so go vote for the greater evil to speed the process along . 
  it 's not that much of your time . 
  i doubt there 's anything you can do with that time that would have a bigger impact . 
   do you get paid for being an official ? 
  we do . 
  how much you get depends on what you 'll actually be doing , ranging from ~ $ 250 to ~ $ 300 . 
  depends on where you are . 
  i 'm fairly certain it would count as a blank vote here . 
   how does a blind vote help anyone ? 
  it wo n't be completely blind , as you probably know * something * . 
  and even if it * is * completely random , it still helps negate populist voting . 
  if you do n't vote at all , the people who do will decide for you and they 're not necessarily qualified to do so . 
   it 's voting for the least evil , but still voting for evil . 
  still better than letting evil win because you do nothing . 
  voting blank does send an actual message too , so that 's a perfectly respectable choice . 
  not voting at all means you lose your right to complain , though . 
  it also means that people who have no idea what they are doing but lack the insight to see that will be a bigger part of total votes . 
  which is still less bad than the worse evil . 
  the thing is that you ca n't opt out . 
  not voting wo n't spare you from any of the consequences . 
  ignoring the problem will not ever make it go away . 
  you either vote , or someone else votes for you . 
  not voting wo n't make it better . 
   i 'll hit the election office at 13:00 and stay there till the end want to trade ? 
  i 'll be there from 07:30 until the end , which should be around 23:00 , then off to city hall to hand in all the counted ballots ... 
  then write `` blank '' on it , i guess . 
   why should i vote ? 
  to prevent that from happening again ? 
  well , we did constantly pillage their coastal settlements for a thousand years , so i guess that 's only fair . 
  87.2 % of the european parliament seats are non-german . 
  i think you grossly overestimate the influence that germany has . 
  because you 're handing your political power to other people , most of whom you probably do n't agree with . 
   ... especially in a small country like the netherlands . 
  that 's why there are parliamentary groups at the eu level . 
  the party you vote for may only get a handful of votes , but it 'll still be one more seat for a party group you sympathize with . 
  with only 766 seats , each one does matter . 
  it might not make a difference in every single vote that 's brought up , but sooner or later there 'll be a motion that passes or fails by a single vote . 
  if you vote , you can make that deciding vote be one you agree with . 
   why somebody who has no idea about economy society and law should vote ? 
  because a whole bunch of people who also have no idea but lack the sense to realize their own limitations ** will ** vote . 
  low turnout does n't mean that only the people most qualified will vote . 
  you can either vote to the best of your ability , or surrender all political power to people who do n't know better . 
  ca n't you prevote or vote by mail or something ? 
  i 'll be working all day sunday and ca n't vote that day , so i prevoted two weeks ago . 
  it 's not too late . 
  vote !, 
  or some crazy hillbilly or militant neonazi 's opinion will matter more than your opinion , because at least he voted . 
   you can expect 1-2 epp , 1-2 s&d , at least 1 from radical left and 1-2 other people from different parties one or two seats ** can ** make a difference , though . 
  in the 2010 swedish parliamentary election , the previously governing alliance were only two seats ( out of 349 ) away from securing a majority in parliament . 
  those two seats have had a huge impact on the last four years of policy in sweden . 
   ... democracy only occurs when the lobbyists decide which laws should be written . 
  which is why people * really * need to vote . 
  stating your displeasure is meaningless if you do n't also vote accordingly . 
  then at least show up and vote blank . 
  that sends a message that you do care , but disapprove of the current state of politics . 
  not voting just sends the message that you either do n't care or that you 're so completely disillusioned that you 've lost all interest in politics . 
  the former means politicians have a reason to care about you . 
  the latter means they can do whatever they want , because you 're not going to be a threat to them ( by voting for someone else ) anyway . 
   but i do not like going for the next best thing . 
  if you do n't , someone else will vote for the worst thing . 
  csu and cdu are both in the same party group in the european parliament , so at the eu level it 's not that different . 
  a vote for cdu indirectly helps csu . 
  i do n't wholly agree with the party i ( pre ) voted for , but in practice a single party wo n't have that much influence anyway and they 're in the parliamentary group i most agree with . 
   even if the ballot included the tories ukip and the bnp . 
  democracy would be in a bad state if it did n't . 
  take comfort in the fact that even people you despise get to run for parliament , because at some point you may find yourself on the despised side of things . 
   but for those of us disenfranchised with this futile exercise and would rather focus on more productive things bettering our lives and those around us , i 'm with you . 
  what could you possibly do with an hour of your time that 's more productive than voting ? 
  or rather , what are you going to do * that hour * that 's going to yield better results than voting ? 
  you can do all those other things and also vote . 
  no amount of education is going to change anything if people do n't use the opportunities they have to actually * do * something . 
  this is an opportunity to cause positive change . 
  are you going to take it or are you just going to sit at home and complain that it 's not positive enough ? 
   by voting for them i 'm legitimizing them despite not agreeing with then . 
  and by not voting for anyone else , you 're enabling their rise to power by inaction . 
  there 's no moral victory to be had here either way . 
  i think the sad part is n't that educated people vote more , but that less educated people vote less . 
  pick whichever one is least bad on whatever issue you care the most about . 
  or at least whichever candidate seems least corrupt , if only to keep one of the even worse candidates out of parliament . 
  blank and invalid are counted differently , at least here . 
  if you vote blank , you 're sending a message that you care about the elections but disapprove of all the candidates ( meaning you 're a potential voter that politicians should care about ) . 
  if you scribble something on that blank vote , you 'll be bunched up with all the people who vote for imaginary parties in the statistics ( meaning that politicians should just ignore you , because you 're clearly not intelligent enough to vote for * anyone * anyway ) . 
  election official ? 
  that 's what i 'll be doing all sunday . 
  the * true * north already has king harald v , king karl xvi and queen margrethe ii . 
  the islanders can get their own king too if they want , i suppose . 
  everything or nothing , depending on how many votes each party gets . 
  if a really nutty party group gets 51 % of the european parliament , all kinds of shit could happen . 
  it 's on sunday , but you can vote any day before that too . 
  less waiting in line that way , as most people wo n't vote until sunday . 
  swedish elections are always on sundays as most people have sundays off from work . 
  the day does n't really matter anymore as you 've been able to vote by mail for a month , but that was the original reasoning . 
   and the grey wolf is n't on the list of endagered species anymore . 
  to expand on that , they 're no longer nearly as widespread as they have been in the past and are gone from many areas , but as a species gray wolves are doing just fine . 
  they 're still found in large numbers all over russia , canada , kazakhstan , mongolia , and a whole bunch of other places .
