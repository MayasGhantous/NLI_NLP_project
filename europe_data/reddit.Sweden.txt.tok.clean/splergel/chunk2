  the end . 
   the pixel side of the notes is ... ugly . 
  ( imo , of course ) the worst part is that they justify it as being modern , to contrast the traditional motifs on the front . 
  the problem being that pixelated art does n't really say `` 2010s '' as much as it says `` 1980s '' . 
  if that 's your idea of modern , you really should stick to classic stuff because you have n't kept up with the times at all . 
  the people going off to fight seem to be mostly second and third generation immigrants . 
  people who left syria are n't going to be very keen on going back while the war is still ongoing . 
   why would you think that they intentionally destroyed them to hide malice ? 
  because the most likely explanation is that they destroyed their papers because their papers showed that they 're from somewhere that wo n't get them asylum . 
  if you 're from syria you get asylum as a war refugee . 
  if you 're from jordan you do n't . 
  so if you 're from jordan and want asylum somewhere less poor , you destroy your papers and say you 're from syria . 
  problem solved . 
   ... and what recently happened in sweden . 
  not a whole lot is happening in sweden when it comes to nuclear reactors . 
  there are members of government who 'd love to see all the reactors shut down , but they 're token ministers from the greens and do n't really have much say in the matter . 
  unless the social democrats agree to shut down any reactors , it 's not going to happen . 
  and they wo n't . 
  and even if they did , they still would n't have a majority in parliament without the support of the sweden democrats , which is even * less * likely to happen . 
  so there 's a lot of talking but nothing actually happening . 
  only if god chooses to grant them that . 
  none of the supernatural stuff is up to them . 
  they do n't necessarily think that they can communicate telepathically with god , just that god can communicate telepathically with * them * . 
  god can hear your prayers , but you ca n't personally send your prayers to god if he is n't listening . 
  the key distinction being that they do n't believe themselves to have any supernatural powers . 
  geographically , it makes about as much sense as canceling a trip to spain because it 's too close to the ebola outbreak . 
  nothing good . 
   just throw more money at it . 
  maybe they figure that spending money on printing money is somehow a good investment ? 
  first and only . 
  it does n't seem like he infected anyone else . 
  there wo n't be any epidemic . 
  just like there was n't any bird flu pandemic or swine flu pandemic , or any of the other times that journalists have claimed the end of civilization was nigh . 
   it 's going to spread and spread unless borders are closed , this is basic science . 
  no , it wo n't . 
  if you looked at the * actual * science rather than sensationalist news articles , you 'd find that no one who knows anything about ebola thinks it poses any threat whatsoever to western countries . 
  the fear of a western ebola epidemic is entirely fabricated by journalists who have zero knowledge of medicine . 
  this article is a perfect example : the headline has very little to do with what who actually said . 
  it should n't . 
  as a european , the average flu season is more deadly than an ebola outbreak would be . 
  because an ebola outbreak would n't be much of an outbreak , as the disease spreads very slowly and poses no real threat if you have access to modern health care . 
  right now , fear of ebola poses a much bigger threat to society than ebola itself does . 
   i do n't think the nurse licked the patients eyeballs - yet she still got infected - despite wearing special , supposedly ebola proof clothing . 
  she was working day after day around people who were showing symptoms and handling infected blood . 
  unless you 're going to have someone bleeding all over you on the bus every morning , it 's not really a relevant comparison . 
  yes , there might be a tiny chance of getting it on the bus , but as long as each new case infects fewer than one more person on average , there wo n't be any epidemic . 
  and they would n't . 
   she then went on holiday , and presumably came into contact with lots of people who were n't wearing ebola proof suits as far as i know , it 's not contagious until you 're showing symptoms . 
  having worked around ebola patients , she presumably identified those symptoms very quickly . 
   at least i know the odds are going down . 
  you do n't have any guarantee that they 're ** actually ** going down , though . 
  attacks were rare enough even before any measures were taken that there 's not a whole lot of data to compare to . 
  the risk it poses to you is minimal anyway , as you 're several thousand times more likely to be killed in a traffic accident than by a terrorist . 
  you 'd achieve more safety at the cost of less freedom by simply jailing anyone who was involved in a car crash , on the off chance that their poor driving skills were at fault and they could cause more crashes in the future . 
   perhaps , but when it comes down to it i would rather be mostly free and an old man with happy memories of a life that was worth living than be completely free and too dead to appreciate it . 
  relatively minor stuff like this is n't going to be the difference between 100 % definitely alive and 100 % guaranteed dead . 
  the risk of anything actually happening to you or anyone you know is very small . 
  the real question is how much freedom you 're willing to give up to reduce a 0.0001 % chance of dying in a terrorist attack to a 0.00001 % chance . 
   ou have to be pretty fucked up in the head to join isis with all the information circulating around . 
  assuming you believe that information . 
  if they met someone who had actually fought in syria , they might have trusted that person 's perspective more . 
   ` cos if procedure was followed , and this still got out - then things look very scary indeed !, 
  actually , no . 
  it 's not airborne and the rate it spreads at is very slow . 
  it is n't really a problem if you can get infected people to hospitals to prevent them from infecting anyone else after they start showing symptoms . 
  the problems arise when there are no equipped hospitals around to get people to . 
  and no , it 's not going to spread so quickly that hospitals get filled up , because it really does spread * very * slowly . 
  since it 's not airborne , you wo n't infect random people you meet on the bus unless you lick their eyeballs or something . 
  ebola poses no significant threat to western countries . 
  even if you could detonate some kind of `` ebola bomb '' in central paris , the disease would still kill fewer people than the average flu season in france does . 
  considering that / r/worldnews wanted to permanently quarantine africa for entirely unrelated reasons already , i 'm not sure if that 's worth much . 
  we do n't do things just to spite the danes . 
  we merely do things * right * , which happens to annoy them . 
   we have n't seen the sun for years . 
  now imagine if you had actual winters too , and not just autumn that lasts until early may . 
  i 'm not so sure about that . 
  plenty of democratically elected parliaments have consistently terrible approval ratings . 
  no one in the us seems to like congress . 
  you can be pretty confident that all the congressmen are at least moderately intelligent and somewhat politically capable , though . 
   this video also seems to be one the bias side of things , considering that just quick google `` coffee harmful '' will show a lot of studies that show negative effects that he neglected to mentions . 
  dosage is important . 
  caffeine is bad in excessive quantities , but you need to drink a ridiculous amount of coffee to reach those levels . 
  up to about six cups per day , it has a net positive effect on your health . 
   ... or whatever organ is used to cut the lactose ? 
  the small intestine . 
  you also screw up the caffeine extraction process by using a different solvent , so you ruin both the vodka and the coffee . 
  the end result has less alcohol * and * less caffeine . 
  water is for sailing on , not drinking . 
  that 's just because if you buy enough liquor on a single trip , the savings amount to enough to make the ferry trip free , which is obviously nice . 
  people from southern sweden do the same thing on the ferries to denmark , germany and poland . 
  it 's not something you do more than once or twice in a year , though . 
  with no stores that sell alcohol open on weekends , we have to plan ahead anyway . 
  bah , * you * try living in a place that cold and dark without a few cups of warm caffeine every day . 
   if you have one cup per day ... 
  but really , who only drinks ** one ** cup in a day ? 
  i think the average swedish adult drinks * at least * two cups of coffee in a day , and that 's barely even a national stereotype for us . 
  brewing stronger stuff also increases the consumption for both tea and coffee . 
  being irish , they 're probably doing it just to spite you . 
  i believe the legal term is `` processed cheese product '' . 
  they 're not actually cheese , but they do * contain * a little bit of actual cheese as one ingredient .
