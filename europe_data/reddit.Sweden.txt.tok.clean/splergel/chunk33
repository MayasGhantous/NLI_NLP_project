  if you want to be a neo-nazi or publicly support isis , you pretty much * have to * know those laws , or your hateful career will be very short . 
  probably teenage vandals who just wanted to see the reactions . 
  actual neo-nazi groups tend to prefer their own flags for pr stunts and stuff . 
  and the main reason we had to invade them that time was because we insisted on invading them even earlier . 
  but the last interventions in libya and iraq went so well !, 
  what could possibly go wrong ? 
  removing assad helps isis . 
  it would give them one less enemy in syria to worry about . 
  levant as in syria . 
  that place where people have thought it was a great idea to give weapons to rebel groups . 
  the smugglers are n't going anywhere , and they 're the ones shooting . 
  they just transport people , then go back home again when they 're done . 
  the migrants arriving by boat have n't really done much aside from ignoring visa laws . 
  it 's the ones in the balkans that you could argue are invading . 
  organized crime . 
   i say , let them in , teach them the language , teach the law , let them integrate . 
  have a successfully integrated person from their home country show them around . 
  explain the culture , the habits and everything . 
  this only works if the rate of immigration is very low , so that you actually have such people who can explain the culture . 
  it does n't really work if the only job that person has had is showing new migrants around . 
  because to get to america you have to cross the atlantic , which costs quite a lot of money and is n't really possible unless you have a visa . 
  refugees have neither . 
  ergo none ( or very few ) of american muslims are refugees . 
  they all had something when they arrived . 
  that first person would n't have any problems getting in now . 
  of course , they would n't have to stop at the checkpoint to begin with ; they 'd just talk to a european university , get invited , and then arrive at the airport with all the paperwork already in order . 
  what 's the point in having a union with the world 's highest gdp if you ca n't use all that money to buy whatever you want ? 
   ... how would some '' rebels '' operate such vehicle with no necessary supplies or experience ? 
  they 'd suddenly find all the relevant manuals , mysteriously misplaced at the nearest library . 
  and right outside would be an abandoned truck full of ammo for it . 
  most fortuitous . 
   how could they seize and use a mobile artillery that is always kept war behind the front lines and is well defended at all times ? 
  hypothetically ? 
  encircling action or capturing one that was immobilized by a lucky artillery hit or covert sabotage and had to be abandoned during a retreat . 
  blame the older generations for picking all the stones out of the fields already . 
  if so , they could have just driven them off to some forest or something for disposal . 
  getting away with murder should be relatively easy if they trust you and wo n't be reported missing . 
  leaving them on the highway shows that someone most likely panicked . 
  the bodies had been in there for a while and had started to liquefy . 
  they 're going to have to clean it all up and look at the bones to know how many bodies there were . 
  co2 seems most likely . 
  the only way it could be co is if the exhaust from the truck somehow ended up in the compartment , and even then the co2 would become a problem sooner . 
   i dislike generalization , but the majority of news involving arrests of smugglers in hungary mention romanians . 
  sure , but people should still at least * try * to provide some kind of source . 
  not just `` i read x '' . 
   the company logo is still on the truck , because the buyer is not required to remove it . 
  i guess that company policy may change soon . 
  carbon dioxide poisoning does n't affect your breathing ; it instead turns your blood acidic . 
  which , unsurprisingly , is not particularly fun or healthy . 
  with lack of oxygen you `` just '' suffocate , and the result is pretty much the same as if you were strangled . 
  and just to confuse things , carbon ** mon ** oxide poisoning * does * affect your breathing , as it ends up in your red blood cells and prevents them from transporting oxygen . 
  so same end result as lack of oxygen , basically . 
  in the case of that last odd number 73 , i guess they knew in advance if they would make a difference or not . 
  the actual vote is mainly a formality ; at that point the outcome is already known . 
  why would they ? 
  they 're not your corporations . 
  if you want a corporation that cares about you , start your own . 
   it 's hard to not generalise about the `` lazy black man '' stereotype when you see shit like this to be fair . 
  it 's more about education . 
  if you do n't speak dutch or english and can barely read in any language , your chances of getting a job even as a janitor are almost nonexistent . 
  when many jobs require you to become fluent in two new languages , you 're going to get stuck on benefits for quite some time . 
   whilst i agree that perhaps they should n't have the same benefits as taxpayers , i am also sympathetic towards them . 
  not everyone is , and in a democracy that has to be an acceptable viewpoint too . 
  arguing facts is one thing , but arguing that everyone should have a particular emotional reaction to something is quite different . 
   in sweden you get treated as royalty if you are an immigrant . 
  hardly . 
  the money is okay , but other than that it 's pretty shit . 
  the money also is n't as good as it looks on paper , as the cost of living is pretty high . 
  i do n't think naming the country quarantinia is going to be very good for tourism , though . 
   op is just another of these few days old accounts peddling his racist garbage . 
  ca n't the racist garbage be judged on its own merits and up - or downvoted depending on whether it 's actually interesting and relevant ? 
  any migrant entering sweden will do so covertly , so trying to blend into a crowd of them will just make it more likely that you 're caught . 
   ... which means `` at the attack against the police this friday real handgrenades were used . '', 
  more specifically , * one * handgrenade was used . 
  it was a biker thing , and they upped security a lot after that , along with emptying any stockpiles they could n't guard properly . 
  these are pretty much guaranteed to be imported , unless someone has been sitting on a crate of grenades for two decades and is suddenly selling them off now . 
  highly unlikely that it 's the migrants . 
  there 's enough smuggling going on already to meet demand . 
  local rumor is that they 're from the balkans . 
  that could be way off , though . 
   i would n't be surprised if this will have the opposite effect in the long term this might largely be shaped by who wins the war . 
  if russia loses , it shows the limits of russian power . 
  if russia wins , it shows that not doing whatever russia tells you to do will have bad consequences and there 's nothing you can do about it . 
   to be fair , the russians are at least pretending that they 're not there , so they might not be able to do that either . 
  if they just went in full battle-rattle , their casualties would probably be a lot lower ... 
  casualties would be ** much ** lower if they could just go all-out with artillery and air strikes ( the russian air force is one of the largest in the world , so they 'd gain air superiority within an hour ) , rather than letting the ukrainians have the skies pretty much uncontested . 
   `` i told you to not drive the company car ~ ~ outside ~ ~ * into the western parts of * the country , ivan ! '', 
   suprised or not depends for me on wether the stuff i read about radical feminism in sweden is true or not . 
  it 's probably true that * someone * expressed whatever views you heard about , but the loud lunatics are few and have no seats in parliament . 
  the radicals are good at getting attention , but none of them have any actual political power . 
  or you could argue that all of latvia ** is ** a tunnel . 
  no need to ever go over any mountains !, 
  it 's not really remarkable for a chef 's knife . 
  not something you can keep in your pocket , though . 
   can you even walk straight when you are that drunk ? 
  you definitely can if you have some tolerance . 
  the average second or third year university student can deal with 0.2 % just fine . 
  they 'll be very obviously drunk , but can walk and talk mostly fine . 
  i doubt that they could do anything other than lose spectacularly in a fight , though . 
   i 'll try to handle that carefully .
