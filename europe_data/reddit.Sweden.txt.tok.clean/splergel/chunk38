   i 'm also very bewilderd how many people in this thread defend cheating and cheaters . 
  people are n't defending cheaters . 
  people are just saying that doing it once does n't make you a horrible person forevermore . 
  people fuck up . 
  it 's usually the end of that relationship , but life goes on . 
  it does n't mean they 're any more likely to cheat in their current relationship . 
   nothing , not even condoms , does n't keep you 100 percent safe nothing ever keeps you 100 % safe from anything . 
  you could be mauled by an escaped circus bear tomorrow . 
  all we can do is to minimize * plausible * risks , and this is n't one . 
  otherwise the best thing you can do is to just stay at home , because if you ever go out together you might end up in a traffic accident and die . 
  it 's not really an argument . 
   ( b ) accept that your moral standards are too strict and cheating is n't that bad since a lot of people do it . 
  i think you 're reading too much into these statistics . 
  the question is `` have you ** ever ** '' , which is worlds apart from `` have you in your current relationship '' . 
  all it takes to end up in the `` cheater '' category is to do one dumb thing once as a teenager . 
  that does n't mean that person is any more likely to cheat later in life . 
  the point is that the infidelity itself is n't necessarily that upsetting . 
  you 're more upset about the fact that the relationship is over than the specifics of how it happened . 
  most characters are somewhere in between , though . 
  you ca n't really place characters like arya stark or the hound on either side of the spectrum . 
  they 're both good and bad . 
  and in many cases ( like arya ) , they 're easy to sympathize with but do n't really have any redeeming qualities beyond that . 
   i assume it would be either an alternate or futuristic world in that case . 
  it would have to be , unless they 're going to postpone production indefinitely . 
  any country with a working economy sympathizes more with finland in all this . 
  and other countries ca n't actually offer any help even if they wanted to . 
   that finland should use stimulus spending to pull itself out of this slump is an absolute no-brainer . 
  the question is n't whether finland can afford it , but whether it would actually help . 
  if the problem is a trade deficit , spending borrowed money is only going to make that worse . 
  there is if it goes bad before you can eat it . 
   good , tell me 5 places you visited outside the cities . 
  most people do n't really go on vacations like that , so if that 's a requirement then 99 % of people visiting belgium are disqualified from having any opinions about the country . 
  which is going to make any data horribly skewed , as it 'll only be from people who liked the country enough to want to see more of it . 
   ... the common thing here is to only make it about the muslim victims . 
  which makes sense , considering that most of the refugees who came to sweden were bosnian , and they 're the only ones really working to draw attention to the conflict . 
  there was a lot of interaction a thousand years ago , yes . 
  there were also numerous failed attempts at invading and christening estonia . 
  there 's really no general term for that in swedish either . 
  * br\u00e4nnvin * covers some drinks that are n't particularly clear , like [ b\u00e4sk ] ( http://www.systembolaget.se/imagelibrary/publishedmedia/6gxa89ueu4r0g5pcmdtw/12907.jpg ) . 
  and if you want to bridge that gap some more , it 's ** gummi ** in swedish . 
  basically the same word . 
  that 's how much of finnish works . 
  it 's amazing how far you can get in finland just by speaking swedish and adding - i at the end of words . 
  you 'll get most words wrong , but enough will be right that they often get what you 're trying to say . 
  it 's ridiculous and * should n't * work , but it does . 
  does n't work very well , at least not in swedish , as it 's `` l\u00f6dder '' in that context . 
  nah , the worst is when it 's a se/dk/no mashup that ends up being longer than it would have been to just write all three separately . 
  but the packaging * does * have three gibberish languages . 
  it 's just masked by the fact that two of them try to write normally . 
  you ca n't be a nordic country if you do n't have ancient rivalries with every other nordic country . 
  iceland being the exception , i suppose . 
   sure sign this sub is going to shit , my top voted comment here is a complaint i do n't think it 's a sign that the sub is going to shit , just that the sub is aware that you ca n't really have political discussions here . 
  the same thing applies to 95 % of the internet and real world , but a lot of the time you can get away with it simply because everyone agrees on politics anyway ( or anyone who disagreed has already left , like in / r/politics ) . 
  this sub is by its very nature too diverse for that . 
  / r/europe is n't any less tolerant than other subs ; it 's just too diverse to be able to pretend that it 's welcoming . 
  i wish i could say that she wo n't be reelected anyway , but it seems like it does n't matter who people actually vote for , because mp somehow get to dictate immigration policy anyway . 
  which is unfortunate , as they are by far the least qualified to do so . 
  sd obviously would n't cooperate with them in that regard , but they have no realistic chance of winning before 2022 anyway , so you still get stuck with mp in 2018 . 
  because it 's * a * response . 
  no one thinks it 's a good one , but many think it 's better than nothing . 
  at the moment there are n't a whole lot of competing suggestions other than hoping for the best . 
  is is fighting for its very existence at home . 
  i doubt they have any hordes of zealots to spare . 
  those zealots are busy fighting in syria and iraq . 
  i think most of their budget goes to the local war effort and recruiting more people for that war , though . 
  they 're more or less surrounded by enemies , so any terrorism acts that do n't directly help their war effort are likely to be targets of opportunity when some foreigner who was already at the target decided to join . 
  no one is really vilified except the teutons , who arguably were n't all that nice anyway . 
  the only issue seems to be just how important the russian forces present actually were . 
  there are lots of reasons to illegally set fire to things , including insurance scams . 
  it would n't surprise me if someone took the opportunity to burn down their own building as a peaceful protest passed by , then blaming them . 
  if it 's anything like reports of immigrants in malm\u00f6 `` attacking '' things like ambulances , a seven year old kid throwing one small rock in the general direction of the target counts as an attack . 
  serious incidents do happen , but they 're very rare . 
  yeah , but no one wanted the refugees in the eu to begin with ( or at least no one is both willing and able to pay for it ; ability being key as it 's easy to be generous with other people 's money ) . 
  no one is going to happily embrace them just because they managed to illegally sneak in . 
  the mediterranean is huge . 
  you ca n't guard all of it unless you 're willing to spend a massive amount of money on it . 
  they 'd just take detours to go around the blockade . 
  geographically , spain is in the south west . 
  if you have to pick one , south seems most fitting . 
  spain is more similar to italy than to england in most ways . 
  this is what you get for being conquered by the moors . 
  you should have though of this a thousand years ago and fought harder . 
  only people outside of the nordic countries care about the word `` scandinavia '' . 
  when people from scandinavia use it , they invariably mean `` nordic '' . 
   at least if you do n't count the caucasian republics ( and we do n't ) . 
  a small part of azerbaijan is inside the historical definition of europe ( i.e. 
  north of the caucasus mountains ) , so it 's a bit like turkey and russia ; the country is in both europe and asia . 
  the other caucasian countries are entirely on the asian side , so there 's not much to discuss there other than political wishful thinking . 
  i guess violent protests are less fun when the other people are shooting back . 
  not people who can go home once their work is finished . 
  note that guns would have made no difference in this case . 
  they wo n't stop someone from shooting you in the back . 
  this is n't your street , so that does n't say much . 
  unrealistic . 
  no one in sweden would ever be that enthusiastic about anything unless they 're < 13 years old or drunk . 
  the point was that at that point they 're no longer fleeing from war . 
  they 're fleeing from extreme poverty , which is sensible and understandable , but fundamentally different and often not an accepted reason for being granted asylum . 
  yeah , that part seems spot on . 
  it 's hard in words like * gamla * and soft in words like * gev\u00e4r * , as well as in `` gj '' words like * gjuta * . 
  they 're pretty weird when you watch the show too .
