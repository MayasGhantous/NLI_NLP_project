  it also does n't apply to the government . 
  the article mentions that there have been arrests , including someone who had left the country but was arrested in germany and sent back to sweden for trial . 
  so they are working on it , but are warning people about the problem until it has been dealt with fully . 
  it 's not an * exact * translation , but it 's close enough that i would n't consider it misleading . 
  the original wording is a bit milder . 
  that 's * really * vague when talking about europe , and covers a number of groups that do n't really have much in common . 
  you might as well just say `` non-muslim european '' , because that 's all you end up excluding . 
  if you count england going from monarchy to parliamentary democracy with a monarch figurehead as the same state , rome should get to count both the roman kingdom and the roman republic as being part of the empire , in which case they 're up to ~ 1200 years even without counting the period after the capital was moved . 
  and if you * do * count constantinople , it 's up to ~ 2200 years . 
  either way , it 's a ** very ** long time . 
  history shows that ** all ** states fall eventually . 
  it 's just a matter of time . 
  the roman empire was around for much longer than any currently existing state has existed , so the fact that it fell and most modern countries have n't ( yet ) says absolutely nothing . 
   i wonder how this superstate is planning to prevent from minority takeover in the long term . 
  it would n't exactly be a long-term problem , when the whole union would consist of a bunch of minorities right from the start . 
  there would n't ever be any majority group in any politically meaningful sense . 
  so you either deal with the issue right away or the whole thing falls apart within a year . 
   i know in the uk and the us for example that girls are outperforming boys a lot in education . 
  i 've also seen studies indicating that it 's not just a difference in performance , but also grading . 
  comparing standardized test scores to final grades , girls will on average get a disproportionately high grade compared to their test scores , while boys get disproportionately low grades even if they got the same test results . 
  and if they were irregular before , it can be a while before you consider it to be unusual . 
  then even at the point where you should perhaps consider it to be unusual , you might not think about it , as it 's much easier to notice abnormal things happening than things abnormally not happening . 
   every country will always look for ways to cut down it 's own spending though . 
  sure , but harshly taxing only some individuals of one gender is a rather odd way of balancing the situation . 
   it would be idiotic to not do legal abortion , even if you want a child . 
  you would get free handouts from goverment this way and you could support the child if you wanted to , so double the money . 
  depends on the implementation . 
  normally you do n't get aid just because you 're in a certain broadly defined situation , but because you * need * aid . 
  you would n't automatically get money just because one of you signed a piece of paper . 
  you 'd still have to apply - and qualify - for welfare . 
  and if you live together , that 's probably not going to happen . 
  and if you do n't , you 'd save more money by moving in together than you 'd get in financial aid anyway . 
   the law is set up with child 's interest in mind . 
  it 's done in a way that 's clumsy and sexist and does n't necessarily help the child , though . 
  if it 's just an issue of money then the state can provide , as it does for single parents . 
  taking the father 's money just makes him resent the mother and the child , which is hardly in the child 's interest . 
  how much and how quickly it becomes visible varies with the person . 
  it 's entirely possible to not know , especially if you have unrelated medical issues that mask other signs . 
   it was their both decission to have it , unless that was a rape . 
  but the mother can back out of it after the fact . 
  the father ca n't . 
  that 's a ** huge ** difference in how much they have to say about it , and it means the situation of the mother and the situation of the father are not in any way comparable . 
  also consider the situation where the man wants to keep it but the mother was n't ; his wishes are ( legally ) irrelevant . 
  saying that he already made his decision because he agreed to have sex is not fair when she gets to change her mind afterward if she wants , but he does n't . 
  you could use the exact same argument - without any modification or even rephrasing - to argue for banning all abortion that is n't medically necessary . 
  ah , sweden and finland just lazily switching places . 
  i guess being two halves of what used to be one country will do that . 
   google street is awesome when you have to go somewhere and you do n't know how the place looks like . 
  it 's also * really funny * when you need to go somewhere . 
  going to a country you 've never been to before and knowing your way around because you recognize some of the buildings is kind of surreal . 
  they 're basically sea dogs , both visually a taxonomically . 
  they 're cute !, 
  if you have one or more military ships , that 's a navy . 
  and as long as there 's at least one guy on that ship , that 's your admiral . 
  the danish navy [ has a decent number of ships ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_active_royal_danish_navy_ships ) , and the five biggest ships in the danish navy each weigh 15 times more than the slovenian navy does put together . 
  the next four danish ships are a bit smaller , and only weigh eight times more than the entire slovenian navy . 
  and so on . 
  nothing , apparently . 
  which is suspicious . 
  i think saudi arabia is the biggest surprise . 
  while they 're at the top , that 's mainly due to the number of vehicles . 
  their ratio is n't * that * bad , especially not when considering their reputation for reckless driving . 
  it 's terrible compared to countries like russia and the us , who have more vehicles but much fewer violations , bus till . 
  they 're at 1/3 of lithuania 's stats . 
  that 's not * entirely * unfair . 
  if britain insists of charging you money just to drive in the city where embassies pretty much have to be located , it 's not * that * strange that diplomats would argue that britain should cover that expense . 
  they do n't have unlimited diplomatic budgets , and they ca n't really relocate to a cheaper city . 
  makes sense . 
  it 's relatively close , it 's a big city with lots to do while you 're there , and it 's a country that looks good on your resume . 
   the home country can revoke that immunity the host country can revoke it too . 
  diplomatic immunity does n't mean you ca n't be kicked out . 
  no , but it 's less serious . 
  it 's offenses that you get a ticket for , not offenses that you 'd normally go to jail for . 
  the diplomats are n't driving recklessly and endangering lives ; they 're mostly just abusing immunity to not have to pay for parking . 
   ive never understood this diplomatic immunity bullshit . 
  it prevents countries that are n't particularly friendly from accusing each other 's diplomats of all manner of made up charges , imprisoning or executing the embassy staff any time there 's an incident . 
  with everyone immune , even countries that hate each other can still have ambassadors and have some kind of dialogue . 
  it 's more polite . 
  they respect it so much that they brought it with them !, 
   the stereotype i know is that swedes are super tolerant . 
  swedes like to * think * they 're super tolerant , but the ones preaching tolerance the loudest are usually also the ones who live in the whitest neighborhoods . 
  typically a trendy gentrified previously-lower-class area where they can pretend to have less money then they do , without having to give up any actual comforts . 
  they may have one or two `` immigrant '' friends whose parents came from somewhere twenty years ago , but they could n't tell you the last time they spoke more than three words with someone who personally fled from anywhere . 
  there are exceptions , but that 's the rule . 
   nah , most of the world ca n't afford german weapons ... then they shall be enslaved by the ones who can , driving up demand !, 
  op used the website 's title , more or less . 
  blame that . 
   same thing happened with basically every place ever at one point . 
  there are exceptions , though . 
  many places are populated by more or less the same groups since humans first migrated into those lands . 
   also , asylum seekers is the correct them . 
  that 's a rather pointless term , though . 
  i could file the paperwork to apply for asylum in my home country tomorrow , and due to them being overworked it would probably take a month or two before it got rejected . 
  during that time i would be an asylum seeker . 
  those numbers do n't necessarily mean they support * all * her policies . 
  not everyone thinks immigration is the most important issue , especially not in areas that are n't really affected by it . 
  even in cities that have a lot of problem areas because of failed integration , most neighborhoods tend to be unaffected . 
  at least in sweden , you can figure out which areas have a lot of immigrants just by looking at the voting stats after elections . 
  districts near areas with a lot of immigrants have disproportionately high numbers for sd , who are for reduced immigration . 
  districts far away have disproportionately high numbers for mp , who are very pro-immigration .
