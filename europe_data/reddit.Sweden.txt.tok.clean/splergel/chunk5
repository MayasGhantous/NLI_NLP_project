  they 've also shaped the debate such that every time you insult them you just end up helping them . 
  each time \u00c5kesson spouts some random statistics and everyone else replies by talking about not accepting racism , he ends up looking like the only one who can stay on topic and use facts ( made up or otherwise ; does n't matter as long as no one else has any statistics ) and comes across as the most sensible person in the room . 
   please , enlighten me : why not just have one ballot like other western places ? 
  i 'm not saying that sweden should n't . 
  i 'm just saying that the current swedish system is ** also ** secret . 
  the people saying otherwise are simply misinformed or unwarrantably paranoid . 
  with the swedish system are expected to grab multiple ballots and you can grab a blank ballot and write in anything you want . 
  you can also bring a ballot with you from home . 
  and most people really do grab multiple ballots on principle . 
  i spent all day yesterday working in the elections and i 've done so for the last twelve years , so i 'm very familiar with exactly how the swedish voting system works . 
  sd are very tame compared to the kind of comments you frequently see in / r/worldnews . 
  there are plenty of far-right parties in sweden , but sd is n't really one of them . 
  it does look like we 'll have a social democratic government , after having a center-right government for the past eight years . 
  compared to the support they 've grown used to over the past fifty years , both s and m are actually losing . 
   hm this will be an interesting attempt at forming a government . 
  it will be the same as it was for the past four years , except with a minority government lead by the social democrats instead of a minority government lead by the moderates . 
  little actually changes . 
  the elections ** are ** secret . 
  the system is a bit odd , though , and a lot of people are n't aware of the fact that you can write any party you want on a blank ballot . 
  people also underestimate just how common it is to take a dozen or more different ballots from the stands . 
  it 's what most people do , but you do n't really see the trend unless you work in the elections . 
  i think you can , but it 's pretty much never done . 
  the center party and the christian democrats had some kind of deal going in one election ( but ended up both getting 4 % anyway in the end ) . 
  i do n't think any other party would want to form such an alliance with fi , though . 
  they do n't see sd as the village idiot party . 
  sd have been very good at turning media attention to their advantage and using other parties ' reluctance to cooperate in their favor . 
  the past eight years , they 've been far better at the political game than anyone else . 
   they can and they do . 
  we have swedes in this very thread saying people saw them taking ballots for parties . 
  ** most ** people will take multiple ballots , though . 
  you grabbing several ballots including sd is not at all remarkable , because most other people do the same . 
  if everyone who grabbed an sd ballot actually voted for them , they would have had 60-70 % of the votes . 
  you also do n't need to use a party ballot at all , as you can write your preferred party on a blank ballot . 
  you do n't have to use the party ballots at all . 
  you can take a blank ballot and write on it . 
  that 's what the pens are there for . 
   i totally not dig having to pick the pamphlets openly in the hallway then walk in to the election booth with all those pamphlets clearly visible . 
  grab multiple ballots , yes . 
  you can also take a blank ballot and write whatever party name you want on it . 
  or you can do both and grab a bunch of ballots including a blank one . 
  checking in again now that we know the results , the above is pretty much spot on . 
  the sweden democrats got 13 % , and neither the right-wing alliance or the left-wing red-greens managed to secure a majority . 
  most . 
  some went to the social democrats too . 
  interestingly , the other alliance parties have been relatively stable , but the moderate party has lost much of its support . 
  [ here 's an example from malm\u00f6 ] ( http://www.val.se/val/val2014/valnatt/r/valdistrikt/12/80/0901/index.html ) . 
  [ and from stockholm ] ( http://www.val.se/val/val2014/valnatt/r/valdistrikt/01/86/0117/index.html ) . 
  you can vote for sd without ever touching a sd ballot , actually . 
  just take a blank ballot and write `` sd '' on it . 
  there are pens in all the booths . 
   how can you possibly justify forcing people to pick up valsedlar out in the open , where anyone watching can see ? 
  because : 1 . 
  most people grab a whole bunch from various parties . 
  the people who want complete secrecy will grab one ballot for every party . 
  you then go in behind a screen and place whichever one you want in a sealed envelope , then put the leftover ones in your pocket . 
  you do n't have to use the party ballots at all . 
  you can just grab a blank ballot and write any party you want on it . 
  there are pens specifically to allow you to do this . 
  if you really wanted to , you could even take a ballot for one party , cross that out and write in another party name . 
  the votes are counted manually ( in public ) , so as long as it 's obvious what you meant the vote still counts . 
   look at the other answer i got . 
  from a swede . 
  even the elections are n't secret . 
  the election is completely secret . 
  i spent all day working in it , so i know exactly how it works . 
  if you have any questions , feel free to ask . 
  all the complaints have been about media debates , not the election itself , and the link you posted is from four years ago ( so before sd got into parliament ) . 
  the situation this time around was very different from how it was in the 2010 election . 
  nope . 
  it 's entirely proportionate to number of votes received . 
  the only exception is that if you get less than 4 % of the total votes , you get nothing . 
  you ca n't just hold one or two seats . 
   i thought the greens were polling at around 10 % . 
  what 's happened there ? 
  they lost a lot of voters to fi , who then failed to reach the 4 % required to enter parliament . 
  if everyone who voted for fi had voted for mp , they would have had ~ 10 % . 
   do you think the fact that you do n't have secret elections keep their numbers down ? 
  what do you mean ? 
  swedish elections are secret . 
  that 's his point : people vote for who they sympathize with , then lie about it when asked by pollsters . 
   problem is that moderaterna have stated that immigration is a huge cost yet have n't actually given much of a platform on immigration issues which is what many of their voters wanted . 
  not just immigration . 
  defense is also a big issue for a lot of people , and sd are the only ones really willing to talk about it . 
  the moderates have been so busy trying to attract social democrat voters that they 've lost a good chunk of the people who used to vote for them . 
  looking at traditionally moderate districts , they party has gone from 50-60 % support there to < 40 % . 
  they 're indistinguishable from a parody party . 
  they count on the fact that people will vote for them without actually reading their party program ( and people do ) . 
  it 's not just stockholm . 
  [ some parts of malm\u00f6 ] ( http://www.val.se/val/val2014/valnatt/r/valdistrikt/12/80/0205/index.html ) are even more hipster . 
   sadly that is not enough since other parties ignore sd . 
  they might have to change their minds on that , though . 
  so far , ignoring sd has sent them from 0 % to 13 % in two elections . 
  they 're the third biggest party and are n't going to go away just because people ignore them . 
  not cooperating with sd has n't worked out all that well for anyone either . 
  the election results are basically `` sd wins , everyone else loses , whichever block lost the least number of voters to sd gets to govern '' . 
  largely because of him , though . 
  they could form a coalition with sd , but not with reinfeldt as prime minister . 
   he was n't born looking like that . 
  maybe he 's just old ? 
  i hear some people get wrinkles as they age .
