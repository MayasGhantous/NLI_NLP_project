  it 's just easy to make while still getting good results , and it 's pretty cheap . 
  sweden does more or less the opposite . 
  you have your last exams in may or so , then you have another few weeks of lectures anyway ( mostly stuff that 's part of the curriculum but which does n't need any written test ) , then you graduate in the morning and party the rest of the day . 
  disclaimer : the exact details vary a bit from school to school . 
  i would be very disappointed if the finns do n't also drink copious amounts of alcohol . 
  looks almost exactly like what we do in sweden , except that it happens in june . 
  the tactic , not the people doing it . 
  attacking troops while they 're moving is just sound strategy . 
  the explosion was in a suburb outside the city . 
  this is a bit more central , but still outside the center of stockholm . 
  nothing has actually happened , though ; so far it 's the bomb squad raiding an apartment . 
  g\u00e4rdet is mostly just a really big park , so it does n't really say much . 
  this seems to be further to the west , closer to the center of the city . 
  it 's at least a few blocks away from the subway . 
  it 's like cartoon mysteries with masks over masks over masks ? 
  for kids and the elderly , mainly . 
  anyone who ca n't understand a normal interface . 
  or a * falser flag * ? 
  but that would imply it causes people to blame someone else entirely . 
  by that definition , alexander and caesar were terrorist leaders . 
  it makes the word rather useless . 
   p.s. 
  sudden attack and flee on military convoys was their fort\u00e9 that 's a perfectly legitimate military strategy . 
  always has been . 
  it 's what kept the romans from ever conquering germany . 
  soldiers do n't stop being military targets just because they 're moving . 
   not sure by which standards . 
  most ( ? ), 
  democracies have laws punishing libel , defamation , etc. 
  there is a list of cases where it 's not acceptable , but the rest of the time it 's fine . 
  unless your lies harm someone , they 're legal in most places . 
  you can say the sky is green or that caesar was a turnip as much as you want and no one will arrest you . 
  pretty much . 
  it 's always the first thing to come up and usually the last thing too , right before desperate attempt to change the subject . 
  this is one of those suburbs that has been a shithole for a decade or more . 
  it 's not like this happened in central stockholm . 
  not even remotely . 
  you can go there just fine , though most people would never even consider living there . 
   btw the first one is actually a train station ( triangeln ) in malm\u00f6 if i 'm not mistaken . 
  it is triangeln , but i 'd argue that it qualifies as a subway station on malm\u00f6 's tiny subway line . 
  the `` real '' trains go around the city . 
  it 's * kungstr\u00e4dg\u00e5rden * and it 's the trippiest place ever , so it would n't surprise me . 
  the place is very unsettling if you 're drunk . 
  it does n't help that the station is very deep down , so the escalators up/down feel like they never end . 
  combined with some weird pattern painted on the ceiling that makes you dizzy if you look up , of course . 
  i have no idea what they were thinking when they built it . 
  it 's the city hall station in stockholm . 
  it 's really just rock that 's been selectively painted red , with some creative lighting . 
  the station is neat compared to many other places , but it pales compared to moscow .

  that 's really impressive .

  and if the state of their stolen volvos is anything to go by , they should be in excellent condition . 
  nk seems to take maintenance very seriously when it comes to vehicles . 
   finnish unfortunately has a shitload of germanic words mostly from swedish . 
  and as a swede visiting finland , it 's hilarious . 
  half the time you can just say the swedish word with an i at the end and actually be understood . 
   we do n't really know the origin of the word caesar though . 
  it 's believed that it comes from `` hairy '' . 
  it was n't even known back in caesar 's day . 
  he personally preferred an explanation that attributed it to some form of the word `` elephant '' in a language that probably does n't exist anymore . 
  point being that it was already a very old name back then , and did n't really mean anything other than being a name . 
  just read it as sarcasm . 
  if they got as far as greece , they 're not going to want to be welcomed by any hotspots . 
  the city has had countless names throughout history , yes . 
  roman emperors seemingly enjoyed renaming it , notably constantinople , which stuck after emperor constantin i decided that byzantium was n't a good enough name for his new capital and renamed it after himself . 
  istanbul comes from the greek name that the locals used all along . 
  so arguably the turks were the first to * not * rename the city . 
  it all depends on what 's in them . 
  a justified rant in this case . 
  some of the bushes look radioactive . 
  i believe the danish custom is to serve pork with a side of more pork . 
  you do n't really associate pasta with stereotypical greek food . 
  sweden cleverly covers both the purple and the red area by having a king named carl/karl . 
  so he 's * kung carl * , or * king king * . 
   you should not be more important than someone else because you came out of the good womb . 
  you 're not more important . 
  you just have the opportunity to get a certain job , which is hardly unique to monarchies . 
  unless your parents are wealthy and well connected , you 're never going to become the ceo of a major multinational company . 
  at least monarchies are honest about it . 
   and our president , even if he 's an idiot or whatever , is legitimate . 
  because we chose him . 
  some of you chose him . 
  many voters did n't . 
  the monarchy could be gotten rid of in four year if there was actually public support for a republic , but there is n't in sweden . 
  the monarch is always more popular than any prime minister . 
  if you were to have an election for who gets to be monarch , carl xvi would crush all opposition in a massive landslide . 
  the only other people who could stand any kind of chance against him are the queen and the crown princess . 
  today , sure , but if all fossil fuel engines were to be replaced with electrical ones , the roles may be reversed . 
  that 's assuming every computer scientist only has one computer . 
  keep in mind that one hunter may have half a dozen rifles or more depending on what they hunt . 
  the army and police may skew the statistics a bit , depending on what counts as a gun . 
  a soldier can easily have three weapons , plus spares locked up in an armory . 
  depending on how the police is organized , they can also have 2-3 guns each . 
  it wo n't bring the number from 7 to 30 , but it might explain some of the difference . 
  wizards do n't count . 
  it 's not like he can be arrested anyway - who 's going to put handcuffs on him ? 
   i do n't think i 've seen a gun irl my whole life , even on policemen . 
  having carried around both an assault rifle and a machine gun at the same time a lot , this seems almost otherworldly . 
  there will always be something to fight over .
