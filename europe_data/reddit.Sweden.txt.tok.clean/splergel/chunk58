  or people are tired of seeing the same statistic cited in every thread about sweden , despite the fact that no one can produce a single statistic supporting their case that does n't include a footnote saying the swedish number is n't comparable . 
  the whole `` sweden is the rapiest country ever '' myth is spread by people who just look at the numbers in studies and ignore all the text . 
   they are . 
  they are not . 
  read the actual studies/reports and not just the data table . 
  they 'll all have a footnote about the swedish number pointing out the legal differences , frequently pointing out that it 's completely useless but included anyway just for completeness . 
  seriously . 
  you ca n't just read the numbers . 
  nothing wrong with talking . 
  they 're not going to be actually joining . 
  erdogan does n't even want to join , especially with the ongoing migrant crisis . 
  turkey would be stuck with all the refugees and - realistically - no significant help from anyone else . 
   yea , like , everyone knows them ** other ** norwegian journos are basically the kkk and aryan nation all in one !, 
  the idea was to deflect the blame , not accept it . 
  that 's the one thing you 're never allowed to do . 
   i just fail to understand why ? 
  because when you 've spent the last decade or two telling everyone how awesome immigration is and will continue to be , you 'll seem like a criminal if the public 's view of it changes . 
  so rather than stories about large groups of immigrants sexually assaulting people , you get sob stories about two syrian refugees with university degrees who could n't get jobs because they do n't speak the language . 
  you also get opinion pieces saying how this is n't the fault of immigrants , but a men 's issue and the problem is that swedish men do n't speak to immigrant men enough ( ignoring the fact that the language barrier makes this impossible ) . 
  and * that * gets published in major newspapers . 
  it 's at times so absurd that you could n't even make it up . 
  note that the opinions of swedish journalist are not in any way representative of swedish people in general . 
  in polls about what parties they vote for , their sympathies are * completely * different from actual election results . 
   where did the tall refined human elf come from ? 
  they were * kind of * there all along , but in folklore they 're more magical and elusive , generally choosing not to interact with mortals at all . 
  tolkien just made them slightly less spooky . 
  later fantasy authors then made them considerably less magical . 
  in tolkien 's work the elves still all have weird magical traits . 
   that sort of ridiculous false dichotomy going on it puts the validity of the results very much into question . 
  i 'd say it 's less `` puts the validity of the results into question '' and more `` makes the study complete garbage '' , or arguably even `` means the conclusions are lies '' . 
  the results are 100 % useless . 
  it 's like having a poll about whether people like apples or oranges , with no option for both , and then concluding that anyone who answered apples dislikes oranges . 
  confusion . 
  you believe both but you 're only allowed to pick one of them , so which do you pick ? 
  it would probably be more or less random . 
  ... back to canada . 
  depends on where in denmark you are . 
  if you 're in copenhagen ( according to the article she lived 50 km away ) and spend some time making the right connections , you could probably get your hands on some . 
  the hardest part is staying below the radar . 
  but considering that she got arrested , that 's not a difficulty that we need to consider in this case . 
  spoiler : it 's not actually milk . 
  it 's nitroglycerin . 
  that shady milk salesman was isis . 
  if someone is arrested for making explosives , why not throw on some extra charges on top ? 
  if you go that far , you probably took that facebook group seriously . 
  and considering that isis does much of their recruiting online - and manage to cause quite a few deaths that way - the fact that it 's facebook does n't in any way make it less serious or less dangerous . 
  or at least do n't get upset if your kids do that , because that 'll just make them want to do it even more . 
   teens dress and behave far more conservatively than previous generations . 
  that 's how they rebel . 
  it 's instinctive to want to distance yourself from your parents and become independent at that age . 
  there 's no specific way of doing it . 
  in fact , if you 're rebelling the way others expect you to rebel , you 're not doing it very well . 
  hawaii has a lava lake . 
  things are bound to happen . 
  because that 's kind of what they do ? 
  at times it feels like half of europe 's * everyone * lives in the red areas ... 
  nonsense . 
  clearly this is an issue of * men * being violent . 
  that 's probably more related to the months of darkness . 
  keep in mind that it 's over a short period of time . 
  counting casualties per day , it 's comparable to the battle of the somme . 
  it 's not much compared to what happened in the years afterwards , but it 's a huge number compared to any other conflict in human history . 
  it just does n't look that bad because later events overshadow it . 
   are you really arguing that the arab world is not profoundly anti-semitic ? 
  read it again . 
  they 're saying that * islam * is not inherently anti-semitic , and that it has historically been very tolerant of other religions . 
  they 're saying it 's the arabs who are intolerant , and that they ca n't blame their religion . 
  the arabs do n't hate jews because their religion tells them to . 
  they hate jews because they 're bigoted assholes . 
  tell that to the 360,000 french soldiers who died during the german invasion in wwii . 
  despite having every advantage , the germans still lost 164,000 men taking france , so it was n't as if it was a non-violent campaign . 
  more than half a million people died , not counting the occupation or the eventual liberation . 
  because germany = hitler ? 
  i 'm pretty sure building one would be illegal in germany . 
  not sure if that makes germany or russia look better . 
  in a country the size of russia , you 're going to get the occasional loonie no matter how much you invest in education . 
   but why do i keep hearing americans pay less tax and earn more ? 
  because americans have to pay for a lot of things out of their own pocket that the government pays for in other countries . 
  health care , prescription drugs , athletic activities , college tuition , and sometimes things like bus and train fares are subsidized . 
  exactly what 's covered obviously depends on the country . 
  there are also differences in how taxes are paid that make income numbers difficult to compare . 
  in some cases , the employer pays social fees and such to the government before any money goes to the employee , so their salary is less on paper than it is in reality because they pay more taxes in reality than what shows up on paper . 
  even without the government involved , the may exist similar deals between the employer and some company , such as paying for health insurance . 
  that money could have gone towards a higher salary , but now instead it goes toward something else and does n't get counted . 
   by definition 50 % of the people can at least afford that , so a majority will end up having average of higher standard of living . 
  no , ** exactly half ** of the population will have average or higher . 
  if you 're just below the average , you 're still up there at the top of the bell curve being as normal as it 's humanly possible to be . 
  keep in mind that half the people who are * roughly * average are below the average , but are living lives that are more or less identical to those of people who are just above the average . 
   just because our future is cooler and healthier does n't mean it will be as good . 
  it kind of does . 
  there 's a lot more you can do from home today than fifty years ago , and it 's much easier to stay in touch with friends and family . 
  you 're probably going to have a retirement that 's both more social and more enjoyable . 
   our medicine may become much better than it is today , that will mean nothing if we can not afford to get it as long as nationalized health care is still a thing , that 's for the next generation to worry about . 
  and it will be , because seniors will vote against anyone who suggests otherwise . 
   or any luxuries for that matter . 
  most luxuries are pretty useless anyway if you 're very old . 
  boats , planes , and fancy cars are n't any good if you ca n't use them . 
  as long as you can afford last year 's mass market electronics , you 're fine . 
   of course relative income alone is not that important to elderly , because they often have significant savings to complement their pensions . 
  and lower costs .
