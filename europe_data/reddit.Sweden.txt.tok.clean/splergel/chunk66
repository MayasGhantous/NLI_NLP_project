   try dressing up as a beggar and go sit nearby . 
  i frequently see both them and homeless people sitting on either side of the doors to the local grocery store , so while that may be true in some places it 's definitely not universal . 
  there was an extensive police investigation about that in sweden , and it turned out that while the beggars were organized ( i.e. 
  lots of people sharing an apartment and maybe a car ) , no one made any money from the whole thing . 
  they only got just enough to cover food , rent , and fuel . 
   gee you 're a radical islamist but you just went to syria on vacation ? 
  innocent until proven guilty . 
  can you prove anything ? 
  there 's also a ** huge ** legal difference between not letting someone leave and not letting them come back . 
  the latter would leave them stateless , which is one of rather few things that no state is ever allowed to do according to international law . 
  executing them for littering would be perfectly fine , but leaving them stateless is not . 
  because if they 're not entitled to any benefits and do n't have any residence permit , they 're not entitled to any education . 
  and no one has any reason to talk to them . 
  so even if they want to , learning the language is hopeless . 
  the general approach seems to be that if you ignore them long enough , they 'll give up and go back home . 
  and these people are `` suspected jihadists '' , so it 's safe to assume that they have in fact ** not ** declared themselves to be jihadists . 
  or at least they deny it now and there 's no proof that would hold up in court saying they did in the past . 
   if by suspects you mean people who went in syria to support isis they 'll probably deny that second part , and you have no proof of it . 
  their only crime was going to a country that it was perfectly legal to visit at the time . 
  they can easily come up with a hundred justifications for going there . 
  only if you look at 2015 and nothing else , but the only reason to not look at a longer term average is because you really want to get the result that terrorism is the biggest threat and do n't care if it 's actually true or not , as long as you can get the statistics to show it . 
  but you ca n't draw any meaningful statistical conclusions from just one year on something like this ; preventing horribly misrepresenting statistics like this is pretty much why averages were invented . 
  it depends on whether you look at it as a purely theoretical hypothetical , or if you look at societies that have actually done it . 
  in practice , those laws never get enforced equally . 
   the fact that they had 168 possible leads tells me they were trying to play some sort of long game . 
  or that they had 168 cases of `` maybe '' where they thought there * might * be something , but most likely not . 
  considering that they averaged one weapon found for every five or six places raided , they seem to have been correct in that assessment . 
  most raids found nothing , as predicted . 
  the real question would have been whether to raid a place where you thought there was a ~ 10 % chance of something illegal going on , and a ~ 90 % chance that you were mistaken and they were innocent . 
  before the attacks , the answer was `` no '' . 
  after the attacks , that changed to `` yes '' . 
  it 's completely harmless . 
  they do n't bother anyone ; they just sit there . 
  also note that they 're not homeless , just unemployable due to not knowing the language and not eligible for any welfare for whatever reason ( most likely being that they 're economic migrants and not refugees ) . 
  it would certainly be preferable if this was n't the case , but as long as people insist on giving them money then it 's not going away . 
  it still exist , and is n't really any worse than it 's been in the past . 
  it could certainly use more money , but so could a lot of things . 
  it seems like you could fill in a lot of the `` hollow '' areas with isis color , because it 's not as if anyone else controls it . 
  most of it appears to be uninhabited desert , and if isis controls all the roads through it then they pretty much control the whole area . 
  peace is nice , but jobs are better . 
  / most voters, 
  unlike in the civilization games , there is not victory screen . 
  otherwise the world would have ended somewhere around 100 a.d. with the roman empire claiming victory . 
  just because someone has `` won '' does n't mean you ca n't beat them and become the new champion . 
   china just decided to end one child . 
  that does n't undo their current population demographics . 
  it was sensible to implement it and sensible to change it , but the full price of fixing overpopulation still has n't been paid . 
  that was a thousand years before the first turks came anywhere near modern turkey , though . 
   shit , turkey would send the count ? 
  they prefer to [ not say his name out loud , though ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-wd-q3f8km ) . 
  clearly they 'll send anti-movie squads into europe to kidnap movie stars !, 
   good , the kurds , along with the yazidi , are the good guys in this ... 
  there are no good guys . 
  they 're just as corrupt as everyone else . 
  they just behead fewer people , or at least do n't upload the videos online . 
  no , the most recent suggestions are a bit more about kicking people out . 
  nothing too radical , but all sensible stuff . 
  probably not . 
  student unions just were n't as whiny a century ago . 
  if i was in charge , i 'd also be tempted to just ban everything in order to not have to deal with them anymore . 
  if you 're not allowed to talk about * anything * then clearly no one can be discriminated . 
  or at least claiming that someone is being discriminated is itself already banned . 
   yep , refugees were handing out flowers the other day here too , and a lot of people assumed they were trying to sell them . 
  it 's a reasonable assumption to make . 
  if a stranger hands you a flower , they either hope to get paid for it or they 're trying to guilt you into talking with them while they try to sell you on some product , charity or political ideology . 
  99 % of the time , the sensible thing to do is to not accept it . 
  the really important thing seems to be a strategically useful location and lots of oil that you 're willing to sell . 
  greece was part of byzantium , not the other way around . 
  it was founded as a greek colony , but the romans were largely responsible for making it important , and the population was a mix of greeks and romans . 
  that probably still means european . 
  while istanbul is located on both sides of the bosporus and spans two continents , ancient byzantium was located on a peninsula on the european side , today the district of fatih . 
  it came from a lot of places . 
  i believe some parts were written in greece . 
  i do n't think the origins for all of it are entirely known , but the events are spread across three continents . 
  probably depends on what shape she 's in . 
  there 's presumably a doctor involved . 
  my grandmother would have been fit to go to jail until she was 90-something ( had she committed any actual crimes , that is ) . 
  others are unfit at 70 . 
   ok she 's telling nonsense . 
  it 's not nonsense . 
  it 's very deliberately composed lies that fit into a political agenda with illegal end goals . 
  she 's not taking a random historical event and saying it never happened . 
  the choice of subject is very deliberate , as is what she 's saying about it . 
   i remember you people saying bahar mustafa should not have gone to jail for her speech . 
  are you sure the `` you people '' saying this are the same people as the `` you people '' saying that ? 
  because it 's possible for more than one group of people to independently disagree with you without necessarily agreeing with each other . 
   and who gets to decide what 's the `` true '' history ? 
  that argument would have worked if the german view of events was different from anyone else 's , but virtually the entire world agrees and all the evidence points to that being true , and the only people disagreeing defend those beliefs by ignoring all evidence and eyewitness accounts as being unreliable on account of saying things they do n't want to hear , there 's really not a whole lot of room for moral ambiguity . 
  are you implying people should n't be allowed to get away with things simply because they are old , women or both ? 
  is her being an 87 year old woman actually relevant to the case ? 
  should it be ? 
  at least in swedish mainstream media , the pictures * mostly * represent reality . 
  pictures of women and children are * somewhat * overrepresented since that sells better , but it 's not as bad as you may think . 
  you just remember those pictures and forget about all the pictures of male refugees in other articles ( which is exactly why they put kids in the pictures to begin with ) . 
  but if you dig through the archives and count the people in the pictures , you 'll find it 's pretty accurate . 
   maybe a naive question , but why did n't the swedish people elect more capable politicians to office , after the failure ? 
  we did . 
  the old government got kicked out back in 2006 , but later the new government unexpectedly decided to make a deal with the most extreme opposition party about immigration . 
  which is a big contributing factor to why they lost in 2014 and the old prime minister was forced to retire from politics . 
  the current government is actually willing to do * something * , but it might be too little too late .
