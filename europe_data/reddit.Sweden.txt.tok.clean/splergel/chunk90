  it just means it does n't follow the normal channels . 
  or that it 's * conditional * immunity from prosecution . 
  misbehave a little too much and your family gets sent home . 
  misbehave far too much and you 'll be prosecuted , no matter what your home country feels about it . 
  it happens occasionally . 
  well , he 's in the country . 
  they can arrest him if they want . 
  but i do n't think there are any cases of a persona non grata not being sent home , as it 's something of a national embarrassment for the ambassador 's country . 
   ... but they ca n't prosecute him because of his immunity . 
  it should be noted that * portugal * gave him immunity , not iraq , so if the portuguese really really want to prosecute him then they can . 
  it 'll just make the iraqis upset that they 're going back on an agreement , and will make every other country wonder what other treaties portugal is going to suddenly back out of . 
  that 's the real reason this is a problem . 
  people do n't invest in it because you risk having your brand new plant shut down a year later by some populist politician . 
  and private nuclear insurance is actually a thing . 
  depending on where you are , you can call [ neil ] ( https://www.nmlneil.com/ ) , [ american nuclear insurers ] ( http://www.amnucins.com/ ) , [ nri ltd ] ( https://www.nuclear-risk.com/ ) , [ nni ] ( http://www.atompool.com/welcome/pagetxt.php?id_pag=9 ) , etc. 
  it 's maybe not a good idea , but none of the options are good . 
  they all suck , and nuclear does n't really suck any more than the rest . 
  at least people take nuclear safety seriously , and they require very little materials to build ( you get a ** lot ** of power from just one plant ) . 
  nuclear certainly has downsides , but people tend to overestimate just how problematic those are while ignoring the downsides of everything else ( like how wind plants require a lot of rare metals for the generators , have a relatively short life span , and often do n't have any plan for how to recycle those materials when that time is up ) . 
  the cuba crisis was the soviets moving nukes in response to us nukes in turkey and other places . 
  the end result was that the soviet transport ships turned around and the us then quietly dismantled the nuclear silos closest to the ussr . 
   you ca n't hack a non-networked computer either . 
  it has been done , with great effect . 
  the cylons were just lazy . 
   mine collapses do not have the potential for region-wide devastation . 
  [ sure they do ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_baia_mare_cyanide_spill ) . 
  it happens [ disconcertingly often ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ajka_alumina_plant_accident ) . 
  and [ another ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_gold_king_mine_waste_water_spill ) . 
  and [ another ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bento_rodrigues_dam_disaster ) . 
  and [ another ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mount_polley_mine_disaster ) . 
  some of the worst ecological disasters ever , and that 's just ones that happened after 2000 . 
  you do n't want to do a bunch of minor upgrades on a nuclear power plant anyway . 
  bad code has more consequences there than on a mail server . 
  mine collapses are pretty scary too , but you need those metals to build generators , regardless of where you plan to put them . 
  the only option that does n't come with huge downsides for both workers and nature is to use less power . 
   `` ecologist 's '' who were deeply opposed to nuclear power ... ... because they heard it was bad , from people who do n't actually know how it works but think `` nuclear '' sounds scary . 
  whether it 's better or not is irrelevant , because the opposition to nuclear power is 90 % irrational fear-mongering and 10 % being willingly blind to the downsides of the alternatives . 
  it 's basically immune to any kind of cyber-terrorism , which may become a bigger issue in a not-so-distant future . 
  you ca n't hack a light bulb . 
  that 's really the only effective defense , as illustrated by the people who hacked a car remotely through the tire pressure gauges . 
  they have cheap beer and tasty sandwiches , so definitely . 
  you would n't want to live there , but it 's a great place to visit . 
  it 's interesting to see how many of them still follow the old scandinavian color scheme , [ like this one ] ( http://www.realityhomesinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/manufactured-houses-portland.jpg ) and [ this one ] ( https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1391/813247680_33adb29283_z.jpg?zz=1 ) . 
  [ this should show some swedish examples ] ( https://www.google.se/search?q=tr%c3%a4hus&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=934&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjdj_su18noahugfiwkhdb6cpcq_auibigb ) . 
  it used to be made using waste from copper mines , which was rich in various metal that could n't be extracted . 
  so basically a partially metallic sludge that kills microorganisms but is otherwise harmless . 
  perfect for treating wood . 
  of course , the actual mechanism for why it worked so well was n't discovered until much later , but people noticed that it did . 
  the red ones may not have gone faster , but they lasted longer , so people started to paint everything red . 
  a few shady cases will certainly slip through , but will it be 38.000 erdogan supporters ? 
  it would be a convenient time to release anyone convicted of attacking his political opponents . 
  no , that would just mean someone else would be released to make room for you . 
  first in , first out . 
  maybe they 're just racist against arabs and assume that they 're overrepresented in prisons worldwide ? 
  what they 're doing * is * pretty standard in every western country , though . 
  people get released early all the time , with conditions attached to that release . 
  as long as your chances of release are n't tied to your political affiliations , this can be a good thing . 
  if it is ... less so . 
  tanks have a very impressive presence too . 
  it just is n't really conveyed very well by pictures . 
  the noise and the way the ground trembles a bit as they get near is very impressive . 
  they were invited . 
  you might not like it , but that 's how democracy works . 
  meh , we 've still got the whole universe to play with . 
  not all cultures are content to stay inside the petri dish . 
   in that case you should know you pay for quality , not only looks . 
  dressman stuff lasts for ages , though . 
  it 'll be horribly unfashionable long before it 's worn out . 
   it 's not that there is a lack of food on earth , there is lack of will to live together . 
  there 's no lack of food , but there is a lack of food that people want to eat . 
  there 's no shortage of space , but there is a shortage of acceptable housing in places where people actually want to live . 
  everyone could have a bare minimum of everything , but that means that everyone who has things right now would have to settle for less . 
   ... we would need a small portion of people working towards everybody . 
  and that portion is quite small , i bet that there always would be enough volunteers among us . 
  if you get paid more or less the same regardless of whether you work or sit around and sing songs , no one would work . 
  sure , many people would still sort of work , but they 'd only do the things they felt like doing , not the things that were actually needed . 
  and they 'd work until the work got too difficult , and never actually finish anything . 
  plenty of programmers , but no one working in testing and quality control ( or if there are , their complaints go unanswered ) . 
  more importantly , no one would ever do anything that involved any kind of long-term responsibility . 
  designing a dam might be fun and all , but to risk being the one people blame if it breaks ? 
  not happening . 
  everyone shops at dressman , but you never find out because it looks * exactly * like every other male clothing brand . 
  the entire purpose of male fashion seems to be to look as nondescript as is humanly possible . 
  that 's not going to magically start working better than it is now . 
  it would be great if it did , but it wo n't . 
  it 's not a realistic plan . 
  pretty much all their stores are in east asia and the middle east , with a third of them in china . 
  the reason you 've never heard of them is that they barely do any business in europe . 
  but they * are * a greek clothing company and they * do * sell a ton of clothes , so it 's probably accurate . 
   i very much doubt that most of france is wearing louis vuitton or that giorgio armani is dominating the italian market . 
  i want to believe . 
  if it 's anything like sweden , women 's clothing is mostly h&m and men 's clothing is mostly dressmann . 
  you ca n't turn a corner in any city without stumbling onto both . 
  they 're the same concept , really - sort of boring but good quality for the price . 
   ... and it is now tied to expected average age . 
  as it was when it was first set , and as it should have been all along . 
  when a set retirement age was first introduced in sweden , it was set * to * the life expectancy at the time . 
  so if we worked for as long as they did then , we 'd retire at 82 . 
  that 's not entirely reasonable , but if we want to retire 17 years early we 'll have to fund those years somehow . 
  reason .
