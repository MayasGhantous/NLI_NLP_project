  and 99 % of voters would never watch it , because not having to learn about boring international treaties is the whole point of having a representational democracy in the first place . 
   how are the people gon na read it if officially , there 's nothing to read since the agreements are mostly secret ? 
  let 's not pretend that they would even if they could . 
  even if you mailed everyone a printed copy , they still would n't . 
  that 's hardly news . 
  my point is that if it 's going to be the same bullshit as regular elections , why waste money on a referendum ? 
  the winning side is going to be whichever group of politicians sounds most convincing anyway . 
  all a referendum does is invite a bunch of lobby groups to the party . 
  for big things like the eu and emu , most people will actually read up on it and form their own opinion , but no one cares * that * much about the ttip . 
  because you have no idea what it 's supposed to smell like since you 've never read * any * international treaty or paid attention to any international treaty negotiations before . 
  the ** only ** reason you think it 's fishy is because someone told you it was fishy , and you probably ca n't even say why ( * all * treaty drafts are kept from the public , as they 're not done yet ) . 
  i 'm not saying that ttip is a good idea , just that the public really ca n't say , and even if they could then they still wo n't put in the time it takes to do so . 
  having a referendum is meaningless , because you can count the number of voters who are going to actually form their own opinion on your fingers . 
  everyone else just goes with whoever sounds most convincing , in which case we might as well just leave it to the government ( sounding very convincing is how they got that job , after all ) . 
  at least the bigger parties will have at least * someone * who has actually read it . 
  the loud parties to the far left and right ... maybe not so much . 
  that 's because it 's not done yet . 
  but let 's be real - almost no one would read it even if they could . 
  when was the last time you or anyone you know even * looked * at any kind of diplomatic treaty ? 
  or even so much as went to a webpage where you can download a . pdf of it ? 
  never . 
  and almost no one would do so before the referendum either . 
  how many of them do you think are going to actually read the agreement and make up their own mind , and how many are just going to vote yes or no based on how successfully other people manage to scare them into thinking it 's terrible ? 
  it 's going to be a referendum where * no one * makes an even remotely informed decision . 
  it 's going to be * `` it 'll reinstate slavery !, 
  '' * on one side and * `` trust us , it 's awesome !, 
  '' * on the other , where even most of the politicians arguing have n't read it . 
   a large share of the voters wouldnt even know in depth about what ttip actually does ... 99.99 % of the people voting would n't even briefly consider actually reading it before making a decision . 
   what if instead of being allocated to companies , the welfare recipients were set to do jobs that no one benefits financially from ? 
  that 's still open to abuse when budgeting . 
  no need to cut down on expenses when you can just cut down on the budget for street cleaning or park gardening and fire everyone , then rehire them for much less money under some program . 
  reduce your expenses that way , point to how great the city 's finances are now , cut taxes , get reelected , and hope that the public does n't catch on to what you 're doing . 
  or at least that they do n't until after you 've moved up in politics and gotten a seat in parliament . 
   if exploitative , anti-capitalist tactics give you a competitive advantage : also fine . 
  that makes no sense . 
  abolishing the free market ca n't possibly be a valid move within a free market system , because at that point it has stopped being a free market . 
  worth noting is also that you do n't need any government agency to prevent this - the entire problem is that the government acted when they should n't have . 
  capitalism ca n't fix politics ; it 's just an idea . 
  this is shitty policies at work , and it says nothing about any ideology . 
  sort of like how stalin 's tendencies toward genocide do n't say anything about communism ( his successors were considerably less nuts ) . 
  it 's also worth noting that this is the exact opposite of free market capitalism . 
  here the government intervened in the market to provide cheap labor to some companies , screwing with both competition for contract and competition for/among workers . 
   my guess would be that it 's simply cheaper . 
  if it is n't , whoever is in charge should be fired . 
  it would n't take much negotiating to get a better price when you 're buying that kind of quantities of beer than when you 're buying it as a lone consumer . 
  plus you can probably buy it straight from the brewery , or at least the supplier , without getting a store ( that wants their cut ) involved . 
  nah , he spent years preparing . 
  that 's why the coup failed . 
  he 's been playing the long game for quite some time . 
  do n't underestimate him . 
  oh , do n't worry . 
  we would have found * some * excuse to not give them eu membership anyway . 
  i do n't think either side ever expected that to happen . 
  in 2116 , maybe . 
  would n't that * be * the ancestors of norwegians ? 
  they showed up after the last ice age . 
  no one was there before . 
  the sami showed up from the north later . 
  if so then that problem is literally ancients . 
  the romans left graffiti everywhere . 
  painting penises on ancient temples and such . 
  they were surprisingly immature . 
   north korea however is for decades a strong fortitude against any shred of human-right . 
  you have been banned from / r/pyongyang . 
   it 's really impressive , therefore it deserves a mention . 
  you have been unbanned from / r/pyongyang . 
  by carving . 
  we just need to find a bronze age skier to do it . 
  even if you can fix it , it 's not the original anymore . 
  hence priceless . 
  it 's impossible to buy a replacement , even if you have all the money in the world to spend . 
   anyhow , a tiny rant from my part : it 's 2016 and it 'd be time to start having homogeneous rules and regulations for things like this throughout the eu . 
  standardization has been ongoing for a century , but switching signs is expensive . 
  just a single steel sign with a reflective decal is n't cheap , the work required to put it up is costly , and multiplied by the number of such signs in a country it ends up being astronomical sums just to make driving a little bit more convenient . 
  sort of like how one of the big arguments for the us not putting more effort into going metric is that the cost of just replacing speed limit signs would be in the billions . 
  and if something happens , you can be damn sure that the court will rule that it was because the phone affected your driving . 
  we ** really ** like the rule of `` odd number times ten '' for speed limits in sweden . 
  30 near schools , 50 in urban areas , 70 outside of urban areas , 90 on `` national '' roads , and 110 on highways . 
  more or less . 
   and the pyramids will be there for another 1000 years , people can wait to go see them ... only if they expect to live a thousand years . 
  but yeah , it does n't help this year or next , but it 'll bounce back eventually . 
  other countries might not . 
  numbers still matter . 
  tanks are good out in the open . 
  planes are good against targets that you can see . 
  unfortunately , much of the world allows for neither clear fields of fire nor visibility . 
  infantry still rules supreme in cities , forests , mountains , etc. 
   second largest army but that does n't mean best . 
  sometimes you need * a lot * of troops more than you need * good * troops . 
  and they 're probably at least decent . 
  tanks and planes are cool and all , but there are whole regions where they 're fairly useless . 
  the whole sanction war in general . 
  it 's sort of working , and it 's hurting russia more than it 's hurting the eu , but it * is * still hurting the eu . 
  it 's preferable to war , but it 's still not fun for anyone except the politicians . 
   look at egypt , tourism is now dead there from what i can make out . 
  and egypt is still egypt . 
  no matter what happens , they 've still got the only standing wonder of the world , a lot of ancient history , probably the most famous river in the world , and some ( very minor ) biblical relevance . 
  tunisia and turkey have none of that . 
  egypt 's tourism industry will recover eventually . 
  that 's not a given for other mediterranean countries ( except maybe italy and israel ) .
