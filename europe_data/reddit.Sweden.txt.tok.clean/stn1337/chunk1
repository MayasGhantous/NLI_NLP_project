welcome to capitalism , brother . 
  our nordic socialist welfare-dream is soon dead because of our corrupt governemts . 
  it was good years tough , as long as we stood up for it . 
   fuck off islam ( chanted in english ) thanks for translation, 
  when did nato bomb russia lately ? 
  we dont have any gas from russia anyways, 
  denmark accepts more refugees per capita than germany , just sayin , 
  kickstarter not done yet , after wwiii they wont need the saudis when they own the country themselves . 
  usa is already on it : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-sdo6pwvhq, 
  nothing wrong with the building , just feels so disgusting that saudi plays the `` mr nice guy '' and can easily pay for mosques in sweden but accepts zero refugees from their neighbour countries . 
  what does islam say about that ? 
  here is a list from the swedish social advice and guidance centre for young people examples for sexual harassment : - touch someone in a way they do n't like . 
  - to send messages about sex to someone who do n't like it , for example trough sms , chat or mail - to show yourself on a sexual way for someone who do n't like it on for example webcam - spread pictures of someone who dont want it . 
  - to show sexual pictures that may feel uncomfortable for others - to spread sexual rumors about someone , that the person had sex with many others . 
  - to make something sexual with your body-language to someone who do n't like it . 
  - __ to watch someone on a way that can perceive as sexual or uncomfortable __ - to talk to or joke about sex with someone who dont like it its the one who feel exposed who decide if it feels uncomfortable or not . 
  already happened in sweden . 
  yes , everything from verbal assault to an abusive rape is classified as sexualcrime . 
  if your having sex with someone while they are totally fucking drunk/asleep most country count that as `` taking sexual advantage '' while in sweden its pure rape by law after a change in the law about 10 years ago . 
  which germany do n't have or what are you trying to say ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rape_in_sweden `` there have been several international comparisons made , placing sweden at the top end of the number of reported rapes . 
  however , police procedures and legal definitions vary widely across countries , which makes it difficult to compare rape statistics . 
  for example , sweden reformed its sex crime legislation and made the legal definition of rape much wider in 2005 , which largely explains a significant increase in the number of reported rapes in the ten-year period of 2004-2013 . 
  __ the swedish police also record each instance of sexual violence in every case separately , leading to an inflated number of cases compared to other countries . __ additionally , the swedish police have improved the handling of rape cases , in an effort to increase the number of crimes reported . 
  raised awareness and a shifting attitude of crimes against women in sweden , which has been ranked as the number one country in gender equality , may also explain the relatively high rates of reported rape . '', 
  you have the numbers right in front of you , sweden counts in one way . 
  other countries count rape differently , what you believe in is up to you . 
   i do n't care about what is more believable well then , good talk romania .

  our count is fucked up as well , if a woman says she have been raped everyday for the last 5 years by her husband , swedish police is forced to report 2000 cases of rape while in almost every other country its reported as 1 ( ! ), 
  rape-crime . 
  i think sweden is the only country in the world counting rape this way .

  so your saying that killing children with shotguns is considered normal in turkey ? 
  not the impression i 've got when visited turkey , haha . 
  i wonder where they will go after sweden : http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article19583980.ab '' swedish asulymhouse is worse than jordanian refugee camp '' and the article continue : `` the situation is catastrophically '' and this was one year ago , this year is even worse . 
  have you seen the border at france/uk ? 
  thousands of people lined up to get smuggled in each day, 
  perhaps , i think we are to soft with the welfare as well . 
  if you ca n't speak the language within a year or two you should n't be eligible for benefits . 
  on the contrary only 1.4 % of the swedes ( people born in sweden ) are unemployed for a long period of time , so . . we got that going for us , yay !, 
  he does have a point , only 1.4 % of the swedes ( people born in sweden ) are unemployed for a long period of time , of course the employment will increase by the native population when you import unemployment . 
  http://www.di.se/artiklar/2015/4/24/nordea-har-ar-det-full-sysselsattning/ im not saying our market is racist , just that he does have a point . 
  we swedes benefit greatly from the low-educated immigration . 
  on the contrary only 1.4 % of the swedes ( people born in sweden ) are unemployed for a long period of time , so . . we got that going for us , yay !, 
  we are both destructive and naive with our immigrationpolitics . 
  german are the same but i dont dislike germans more because of their politics . 
  but i understand , the mediareport reflects alot in these polls . 
  cheers mate !, 
  wow , poland , you like americans better than swedes ? 
  well fuck you to then !, 
  i think i saw something the other day , #makeamericagreatagain ? 
  the suburb to stockholm , 
  so hipster in californa buys alot of our highly advanced military systems and weapons ? 
  http://www.svd.se/lagenhet-till-flykting--for-60-000-i-manaden because shit like this , companys renting out apartments for 6000 euro ( 60 000 sek ) per month to one refugee . 
  the government just smiles and pay . 
  and that exclude welfarebenefits such as free healthcare etc. 
  do n't be sad now east-sweden , we all know what the scandinavian capital is . 
  you mean reddit ? 
  understandable , who the hell wants to live in france located so close to the united states ? 
  please , educate yourself before speaking . 
  `` better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak and to remove all doubt . '', 
  what ? 
  it 's like saying that mining diamonds in south africa is funny because buying diamonds its a bigger market in other countries . 
  have n't the richer north always provided for the poorer south in italy ? 
  correct me if im wrong . 
  i think most mosques just frame this picture and use it on the wall . 
  what ~ ~ people ~ ~ idiots dont understand is that most muslims/arabs are antisemetic . 
  during ww2 hitler even had a muslim army . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/relations_between_nazi_germany_and_the_arab_world `` in speeches , hitler made apparently warm references towards muslim culture such as : `` the peoples of islam will always be closer to us than , for example , france '' . '' ', 
  hitler corporated with muslims to kill jews outside of europe . 
  in some parts of sweden jews have been forced to move because of the antisemitic arabs , and this is 2016 . 
  next time , send a picture of the star of david or something . 
  it will probably be more insulting . 
  true , ingvar have 60 billions , way above stefan persson, 
  north americans from now on, 
  dont group me up with these filthy danes as just calling me a nordic , please hate me for being a swede !, 
  but still the uk violate human rights and the eu steps in to overrule them . 
   protection of human rights . 
  i was n't aware that the uk was in such a ghastly state of affairs . 
  well , they actually do . 
  [ `` uk mass surveillance is facing a ruling from europe 's human rights court '' ] ( https://blog.zenmate.com/uk-mass-surveillance-is-facing-a-ruling-from-europes-human-rights-court/ ) http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2015-07/17/uk-surveillance-laws-are-unlawful, 
  i 'm a swede and this is my point of view . 
  the swedish monarchy handles foreign politics relation very very well . 
  they are really good at it !, 
  and some countries respects the title king more than prime minister . 
  to think that we taxpayers just pay their salary and they sit on their big fat ass doing nothing is so far from the truth it can be . 
  the tourism and net gain from having castles and the monarchy still in place is huge . 
  for example , when victoria and daniel got married they estimated the gross profit for swedish shops to increase with 3 billion dollar . 
  tl ; dr it 's a huge economical boost and they handle foreign relations very well . 
  if you went trough the winter and darkness in sweden , you would understand . 
  google up runkbulle . 
  `` no logic '' sums up finland . 
  pretty common here in sweden . 
  model is called 80/90/100 . 
  once you reach the age of 62 you can work 80 % , get 90 % of your salary and 100 % of your salarypension to your pension .
