i think many expected [ our new foreign minister ] ( http://www.svd.se/bilder/artikelbilder/3431020.svd/representations/c/margot-wallstr%c3%b6m.jpg ) to be a bit ... withdrawn , compared to our previous one , carl bildt . 
  so this is a fun to see . 
  this piece on them is simply [ spectacularly awesome ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dljet2ku33i ) . 
  i remember reading that it holds a strategically important position and that if you hold it it 's easier to expand across all of donetsk . 
  agreed , i love norwegians , they 're so friendly and their accent is remarkably lovable . 
  and of course you can talk swedish with them and they can talk not using dialekt and we understand each other near perfectly . 
  if finland joined nato then us intelligence would get such a huge reach in to russia with their intelligence-collecting aircraft that it 's silly . 
  russia would go more apeshit than it ever has since the cold war finished . 
  it just is unacceptable to them . 
  indeed , and sweden/nato already have these sorts of agreements on other areas . 
  for example sweden has fit their aircraft to be able to refuel using nato aircraft while flying , and similar stuff . 
  your comment made me think of the sacred band of thebes , a greek troop that was the only ones throughout history ( i think i can recall reading ) who made the spartans lose a battle where the spartans were outnumbering their opponent . 
  more : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_leuctra, 
  you clearly do n't know anything about this incident . . 1 . 
  several of these neo-nazis got arrested / their id 's checked at the spot . 
  police intercepted text messages the day before the attack between neo-nazis where they talked about gathering to attack etc. 
  ( it was a scandal that this intel never got passed on , hence why so few police at the demonstration ) . 
  the neo-nazis ( you can see their faces in some videos ) do `` sieg heil '' etc in front of the cameras with the over half of their faces shown . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/fangelse-for-tre-av-de-atalade-nazisterna/ ) are some of the 7 neo-nazis that got convicted for rioting etc. 
  also the `` muslim attacks antifa '' video is because antifa was in roseng\u00e5rd to fight neo-nazis , and the muslims in the area were pissed off that antifa and neo-nazis used their area as a battleground , giving their area a bad reputation in the press . . 
  i also find the left wing horrible , any extremism is horrible . 
  but here we 're talking about right wing . . do n't try to shift the focus to them . 
  `` do n't iron pipe my friend '' - `` 199 puns about the sweden democrats '' . 
  ( sweden democrats is the anti-immigration party in sweden ) . 
  in 2010 three top sweden democrats ( the economic policy spokesman and the judicial spokesman and another ) had been in an argument with a famous ( foreign born ) comedian and one of the sweden democrats had called a white woman a whore when she tried to defend the comedian . 
  they later got in to an argument with another foreign born guy . 
  a fight occurred but the foreign born guy was so drunk that he stumbled and could n't really do anything . 
  this guy later got arrested by the police . 
  some parts of all this was recorded and seen online later . 
  in 2012 a film clip was unveiled , the judicial spokesperson of the party had filmed the night on his phone and somehow this had leaked . . 
  this clip showed more clearly when his friend called the girl a whore and after they had been in the fight with the foreign born guy they went away and they picked up some [ iron pipes ] ( http://www.dn.se/images/2012/11/15/sdbauta.jpg ) to beat up the `` blatte '' ( demeaning word against middle east immigrants ) . 
  but by the time they got back he was being arrested so that did n't happen . 
  i agree , it is a very thin line !, 
  you feel like a very nice person judging by your comment history . 
  a bit confused about spain there , any numbers on what they got ? 
  also i 'm starting to really like afp , they 've done some great coverage recently on turkey since the mine disaster , and before that on ukraine . 
  had n't followed them at all before that . 
  how is that even relevant ? 
  for your first link , see [ here ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meetdocs/2009_2014/documents/libe/dv/11_revframework_statute_/11_revframework_statute_en.pdf ) where a suggestion that came up to the european parlament would make it illegal to make homophobic/anti-semitic and anti-feminist opinions . 
  that 's what the woman in the article was echoing that you linked . 
  2nd , you link an article of a islamophobe being fined for hate speech . . 
  he was not merely `` criticizing '' islam , he was committing what the court judged lies and hate speech and got sentenced for it . 
  how is this relevant to feminism ? 
  sweden as a state would fine them ? 
  or would swedish citizens fine them ? 
  according to what law ? 
  and why ? 
  sadly i do n't like the woman they sent to the european parlament too much , at least i think her argumentation skills are pretty bad . 
  however the party leader who has almost single handedly built this party by touring a lot year through year is very charismatic and a good role model for feminists . 
  she has a generally more positive outlook on feminist issues . 
  well they do n't fit the definition of extremist '' * a supporter or advocate of extreme doctrines or practices . 
  * '' in swedish political climate ( almost all party leaders are feminists ) . 
  but in a way they are , they focus on womens rights only . 
  they have n't had any bad press in sweden apart from some criticism from social conservatives like the swedish anti-immigration party . 
  their party leader is the former party leader of the swedish left party . 
  i 've had the pleasure of being to a lecture she has had twice when she was at my university . 
  i did n't vote for her but she is a very charismatic woman who only wishes well to every single person out there except those she deem racists . 
  slightly wrong , sweden is coloured as 50-60 % when it was 48.7 % turnout . 
  cool !, 
  i saw this in the news last week that bisons from a place in sweden was gon na go there to hopefully start inhabit the carpathians . 
  it was scary how much a bison could make their transport wagon shake when they stomped around in there . 
  i 'm really disliking the direction hungary is [ heading ] ( http://zik.ua/en/news/2014/05/13/hungary_opts_for_selfgovernment_for_ukraine_hungarians_487310 ) . 
  it 's the eurovision song contest , and the numbers on the left are how many points each country got . 
  france has 0 points and when the french `` spokesperson '' who was going to give out the french points to other countries was talking she did it all in french , while everyone else did it in english . 
  so it 's just fun to mess around with the french a bit :d i have a bunch of french real life friends and they always think it 's funny to tease each other with stuff like this so did n't expect so many people to get annoyed when i crossposted it here though . 
  i even shared the french contribution ( and i really like the french song , top 5 definitely for me ) to some of my french friends who have n't even seen it , and they were so ashamed , really funny . 
  i live in link\u00f6ping and i heard something that sounded like 1 firework going off after midnight while browsing reddit . 
  i brushed it off instantly but i remember wondering if i 'd ever hear a gunshot in the city and how it actually would sound . . also the guy who got shot is `` previously known to the police '' and he 's related to the recent spat of gang violence in the town . 
  a journalist on the ground said this `` donetsk referendum leader tells me putin `` was kidding kiev '' with his remarks about delaying the vote this week . '', 
  agreed !, 
  it 's not really an issue imo , i just think it 's a fun thing to mess with the french about , just like we love to mess with all people of europe in this subreddit . 
  well he did sing `` i want a moustache '' . . 
  i talked with a french friend last night and he had n't even seen the french song , he called it a bad stromae song and he said he was ashamed haha . 
  i really hope no one gets upset here because it 's only eurovision and it 's fun to jest and make jokes about stuff like this . 
  personally i think the french song is in my top 5 ( france , italy , sweden , austria , norway ) , but the studio version of the song is better than live , same goes for italy . 
  do n't take it too seriously , it 's all done in good jest . 
  just making fun of the french people like i make fun of the danish and norwegian people every day as a swede . 
  you should feel honored !, 
  just to reply here , we would not save money . 
  right now 1.2 % of the budget is going in to the military , to join nato and to continue being a member you have to be spending 2 % of your budget on the military . . 
  though agreements and exceptions can be made . 
  what do you mean ? 
  i was merely saying to thetonn that a large audience did n't get them to the finals instantly , it 's because uk ( and spain , germany , italy & france ) pretty much fund ebu . 
  also it 's a sixth not a fifth !, 
  while austria did get a few more votes due to the `` progressiveness '' then also take in to consideration that other moral values in other countries like belarus for ex ( where politicians wanted to prevent that song from broadcasting ) made them vote less on austria . 
  it 's about donations to ebu not largest audience , 
  / u/langbard just described half of sweden . 
  culturally a lot consider themselves christian , but many do n't believe in the christian god ( primarily there are deists & agnostics in sweden ) . 
  also : today was the start of swedish top football league `` allsvenskan '' , and a supporter of a team was killed after having a bottle thrown at his head ( i believe that was how it happened ) . 
  football scene in sweden is in shock , it 's the second time someone has died from football related violence in sweden , and this was the first day of the season so it 's really bad . 
  the previous time a person died from football related violence was in 2002 . 
  russia bringing in more troops to crimea from the russian border : http://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/truckloads-of-russian-troops-land-in-crimea-by-ferry-ukraine-344177, 
  sky news made it . 
  russian defence ministry says there has been no ultimatum and calls it `` complete nonsense '' : http://www.vedomosti.ru/politics/news/23525211/minoborony-ukrainy edit : there were however journalists at the docks who heard a russian warship say over loud speakers to an ukrainian war ship docked , that if the crew does not leave they will be attacked . 
  not sure if any specific time frame was set though . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.facebook.com/euromaydantranslations/posts/10203364635064682 ) is what euromaidan reported 40 ( !! ), 
  minutes before reuters or any other news media picked it up . 
  i thought it was just the silliest of rumors because it was such a big thing but twitter was quiet , no reaction to it whatsoever . 
  i deleted my post that i made earlier about this so discussion does n't get split here and there . 
  also , [ here 's ] ( https://twitter.com/alecaxelblom/lists/ukraine ) a link to a twitter list i made of appropriate people on twitter to follow concerning the crisis ; journalists on the ground , other well connected journalists or relevant accounts like russian mfa and euromaidan pr .
