  yesterday i read somewhere in swedish media that swedish nationalists were gathering to fly down to ukraine together to `` unite with other nationalists around europe '' . 
  i guess that 's why russians wanted the airports blocked to avoid further escalation . 
  i 'd seriously think that 'd be fun to have as a statue in my home town . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanians#history looks like you 're wrong about lithuania . 
  because this coalition could easily turn in to an anti-immigration coalition instead of a eurosceptic coalition . 
  it is `` relatively '' ( to define exactly how much is hard ) accepted to be anti-immigration among people in sweden , if you put in the way that `` immigration needs to be reworked '' ... 
  however if a party had racist undertones shining through sometimes , that would not be acceptable by the average citizen . 
  the sweden democrats party leader has kicked out all party officials that say racist things , to try and make the party `` clean '' for the average swedish voter . 
  to then mix with other parties who are n't as strict on this area could definitely mean backlash in sweden and sends the wrong message . 
   le pen and the netherlands ' geert wilders create a new euroskeptic party within the european parliament . 
  from what i heard , both ukip and the swedish democrats have refused to be associated with them . 
  i read a few days ago that the danish `` sister party '' of the sweden democrats said they would cancel their cooperation with the swedish party if the sweden democrats decided to follow through on joining the coalition ( because at that point it looked like the sweden democrats would go through with it ) . 
  that was bloody awesome , thanks !, 
   btw nobody 's watching you do n't have to be that vigilant about it . 
  so you think if i want to protect some peoples rights i only put on that as a show for other people to see to get upvotes ? 
  haha i have a fun anecdote concerning this . 
  i was in moscow a few months ago and it was my group there and from what i saw , a spanish family in the long queue to get in to the kremlin . 
  many russians kept skipping in line and eventually the spanish dad went out of the line and started yelling at the kremlin guards that so many were cutting in line and the guards did nothing . 
  the guards yelled it was none of their business so the dad started blocking the stairs for people to cut in line until his family got in . 
  cool guy , wish i would 've went to him after that and given him props when i saw him . 
  everyone in our swedish group just tightly clenched their fists in their pockets , like true swedish stereotypes . 
  dota for now at least , not sure if they have broadcasted starcraft 2 as well or will in the future perhaps . 
  not even remotely close , never even saw that connection before because that is not at all linked to this debate . 
  the arguments that the left youth party use were more about sexism and idealisation of women . 
  `` the international '' : http://www.tv6.se/international/vad-%c3%a4r-international-0, 
  he was going to post his new liverpool tattoo that he got on his leg , while he was at the beach ( nude ) . 
  he uploaded it to instagram and after that it went viral in sweden . 
  people took it with a sense of humour though , some politicians actually making fun ( ! ), 
  jokes about it all . 
  i disagree on your last point , i do n't like the guy that much myself ( i even posted [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/sweden/comments/164iy5/anton_abele_kopierade_ordagrant_obamas_tal/ ) and [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/sweden/comments/ob5oa/anton_abele_klassiker/ ) ) . 
  but he resigned because politicians merely see fault in other politicians views instead of trying to think of new ideas and solutions to help solve the problems we have in sweden , and 99 % of the motions put forward ( according to him i believe ) were shut down . 
  any idea what he said when the two guys kissed during the middle-act ? 
  not a big surprise due to the current president of the czech republic . 
  it 's not an unanimous decision however to support russia , it looks like .

  we had the same sort of article in a swedish newspaper ( my fav newspaper ) from earlier this month : http://www.dn.se/nyheter/varlden/de-ar-putins-soldater-pa-natet/, 
  that 's probably not all , there was one finnish guy dressed as a kkk member at the border to greet refugees , what kind of welcome is that . . 
  finland has taken 7,000 refugees this year . 
  that 's not much compared to sweden . 
  recently sweden has sometimes received over 1000 refugees per day . 
  and still you say that sweden is doing the wrong thing here and that we should keep more in sweden . 
  when it was n't even at its worst , last year , sweden took over 80,000 refugees . 
  and now with this crisis finland has n't taken even 10 % of that within the first 8 months of the year . 
   finland 's economy is relatively much weaker right now than sweden 's economy , and you still keep piling up those refugees on our shoulders . 
  umm a lot of swedish energy comes from russia , we import from other nations that themselves import from russia , and some year ( s ) ago 42 % of swedish oil imports was from russia . 
  i assume you 're kidding . . malm\u00f6 is a great city and i love it here . 
  swedish police arrested a couple of people driving refugees across the copenhagen-malm\u00f6 \u00d6resund bridge yesterday and also warned how it is against the law to take refugees . 
  think the security is tightened but also i know , as i live in malm\u00f6 , there are quite a few people out in town meeting up with refugees greeting them with cinnamon buns and coffee . 
  in my opinion you should always keep bitching , keep the government on their toes and demand as much as you can get , that 's how progress is made when politicians want to preserve status quo . 
  i think he meant myths and lies about immigrants need to go away . 
  no need to put words in his mouth . 
  / another swede from malm\u00f6, 
  i do n't believe they are doing that properly , it 's a few sd members who have done `` pride '' - rallies in the past and i assume other sd members . 
  most gay community-members will probably be walking in the `` anti-racist pride-parade '' which has been set up . 
  yea many do n't get this , the sweden democrats are very anti-hbtq . 
  this is not a real pride-parade , most of their politicians ( and many members , of whom i know in the party ) would be disgusted at the thought of really supporting hbtq-rights . 
  this is 100 % a troll bait aimed at muslims to try make them look bad if they do anything to counter the `` pride '' - parade . 
  so basically the sweden democrats want the swedish people to see that `` hey , these muslims do n't like gay people , hence they must be bad ! '', 
  while at the same time the sweden democrats do n't themselves like gay people . 
  weird . 
  italy disliking russia that much surprised me the most , thought they had a decent relationship . 
  surprised also that greece dislikes us so much , thought they had a pretty close relationship . 
  also obama has been on hollande 's side of things , rather having investing in to the greece economy than doing what germany wants . 
  hehe yes , like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnhow9jvyzs ), 
  it 's been like this for a few years now , gang violence . 
  even have gangs in my town of 140,000 citizens in sweden with people getting shot . 
  have n't noticed it myself in the town where i live because it 's always violence in the immigrant areas ( where a lot of students live as well ) , but in malm\u00f6 it seems to affect the city center a lot . 
  indeed i 'm not but if you look on the map that circulated here recently most attacks etc that happen are in city center, 
  news like this does n't raise many eyebrows anymore in sweden . 
  i 'm moving to malm\u00f6 next week yaaay, 
  frp in norway have economic policies to back them up from the past making them have more legitimacy . 
  whilst in sweden the sweden democrats are completely built on immigrants , hence seen as racist by many . 
  the `` false denunciation of imaginary criminal acts '' was about him reporting a tear gas attack to the police , an attack which never occurred . 
  anything in particular today that i missed ? 
  the last month or so sweden has had quite a few posts hitting the top of / r/all , which you can see [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/sweden/top/?sort=top&amp;t=year ) . 
  / r/sweden is the only non-english subreddit that has come up there , maybe that 's why there 's a bit of a buzz about sweden . 
  about immigration . . 
  in / r/sweden the anti-immigration party is the biggest party among the users according to the last census . 
  so of course you 're gon na hear a lot of trash about immigrants coming from swedes as well . 
  i 'm personally not among that group , i do think sweden should take in less immigrants however as in the long run this is n't sustainable . 
  i read some statistics yesterday from a swedish apolitical statistician who said that if the amount of immigrants today coming to europe was split evenly among the eu nations based on the eu nations citizens , sweden would only take in 10 % of what they currently take in . 
  and only 16 % if you split all immigrants evenly across the gdp of all eu nations . 
  meaning . . that if the rest of the eu took as many immigrants as sweden does based on our population , there 'd be 1 450 000 * more * immigrants in europe . 
  per year . 
  so yes , other nations need to take a bigger share of the immigration in the eu . 
  sweden takes in the 2nd most immigrants of all nations in eu unless i 'm mistaken ( maybe it was only syrians , not all immigrants , do n't remember with certainty ) , only coming a bit after germany . 
  http://www.migrationsinfo.se/demografi/utbildningsniva/ 24 % of swedes and 24 % of immigrants have had +3 years of uni ( or similar ) education . 
  the only uneducated people coming to sweden are from somalia . 
  generally the people coming to sweden are really highly skilled . 
  this is partially because of being able to flee you have to be rich to pay etc , and rich people generally are educated and have good jobs . 
  fun fact : children of iranian immigrants attend university at a higher rate than ethnic swedes . 
  saying that the people coming here are uneducated is ridiculous . 
  italy and greece etc have a much harder time with refugees because their refugees are mainly unskilled and uneducated from african countries . 
  the biggest problem with work etc is the language barrier . 
  source : dad worked with svenska f\u00f6r invandrare . 
  the major at the time government party , the moderate party ( liberal-conservatives ) , generally have competent politicians recently but they do n't mind selling out morals for money . 
  they did so most recently when they ( in some ways ) opposed the government criticism of saudi arabia . 
  and they have in the past been against swedish work to fight apartheid in south africa because they were afraid of losing business opportunities . 
  in 1985 the moderate party leader said this about a potential boycott of south african goods . 
  `` om vi bojkottar deras varor blir de stackars negrerna i sydafrika utan jobb '' - ( my translation ) : `` if we boycott their goods the poor n * ggers in south africa lose jobs '' .
