\u0427\u0435\u0440\u0442 , do this make me go to gulag ? 
  homogay nazi law does n't apply to stronk rossyia, 
  my bad , but the point comes across . 
  well you 're not boring , i 'll give you that . 
  i 'm stretched out on the couch enjoying you being butthurt about a polandball comic and dropping threats about russias ability to nuke the u.s. not to mention your initial post , the blatant lack of background knowledge and nonexistent consideration of international law regarding crimea 's as well as your apologetic stance towards russia 's pretty entertaining . 
   arguing with people like you is n't very fun  russia could nuke the shit out of you . 
  does n't seem very fun to argue with you either . 
  except you also participate with conventional forces , you do n't just arm the rebels . 
  deploying conventional forces to conduct combat operations in ukraine is an invasion . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xatqcyizrpm the full documentary . 
  my bad , misinterpreted it . 
  nevertheless , russias involvement is far from similar to said nato intervention . 
  first of , the recent history in the region in terms of genocide and war crimes prompted worries . 
  and secondly , the intervention stopped a prolonged conflict from taking place via the initial airstrikes on the yugoslavian armed forces and the latter implementation of kfor . 
  whilst not supported by un resolutions , the reason of the intervention is n't even remotely similar to the reasons of russias presence in ukraine . 
  the stated goals of the interventions :  - an end to all military action and the immediate termination of violence and repressive activities by the milosevic government ; - withdrawal of all military , police and paramilitary forces from kosovo ; - stationing of un peacekeeping presence in kosovo ; - unconditional and safe return of all refugees and displaced persons ; - establishment of a political framework agreement for kosovo based on rambouillet accords , in conformity with international law and the charter of the united nations regarding russias presence in ukraine , here you go : http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-un-iduskbn0oh2sk20150601 https://news.vice.com/video/selfie-soldiers-russia-checks-in-to-ukraine https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c66maks1zfm https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2015/09/22/russias-6th-tank-brigade/ https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2015/09/29/russias-6th-tank-brigade-pt-2/ https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2015/11/13/136-brigade-in-donbass/ http://europe.newsweek.com/killed-action-ukraine-putins-secret-funerals-327893?rm=eu, 
  they allowed nato to expand how much they want in an agreement signed back in 1997 . 
  russia have no right do dictate the routes taken by it 's neighbours , them wanting a buffert zone is n't a valid reason for any of their actions . 
  their neighbours clearly does n't want to be that buffert zone , they tried that for like 50 years . 
  was n't too fun . 
  there was in bosnia . 
   russia has repeatedly denied a military presence in the conflict , despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary . 
  but the russian president conceded there were ** military ** ** intelligence ** ** officers ** operating in the country in a marathon press conference on thursday . 
   asked by a ukrainian reporter an hour into the briefing about two russian military intelligence officers captured by kiev and currently on trial in ukraine , putin said : `` we never said there were not people there who carried out certain tasks including in the military sphere . '' he insisted this was ** not ** ** the ** ** same ** as regular russian troops . 
  and the lies continue . 
  there 's undeniable evidence of a large scale conventional involvement by russia , admitting the presence of intelligence officers hardly cuts it . 
  hell there 's even russian intelligence officers present in sweden , as in many other eu/nato countries as well . 
  wait what ? 
  kadyrov 's probably the least likely succeeder of putin , beaten only by like navalny . 
  he 's a thug and an islamist , he 's not even viewed as russian , nor does he appear identify himself as it . 
  the dissatisfaction would reach epic levels . 
  except ukraine was n't committing genocide on the russian minority , nor did nato deny their involvement . 
  not really , it 's a case of russia initiating a conflict only to freeze it in order to create a buffert and to destabilize ukraine , rendering them unable to join neither the eu nor nato ( impossible due to the ongoing conflict/disputed territory ) . 
   tell this to obama who just moved his troops to syria . 
  or to some eu countries . 
  a small number of sof are embedded with the sdf , that 's about as far as the troop presence goes in syria . 
  and regarding the eu i 'm not sure what the fuck you 're implying . 
  the countries hosting u.s. military personnel are also members of nato . 
  the presence is not connected to the eu membership of the countries in question . 
  the presence was either approved or requested by the government/parliament of each country . 
  whilst i do n't think this should be aired by svt , given the bias and inaccuracies of the documentary . 
  i saw it , and it 's essentially a well made and subtile version of the pro-russian lies about the conflict filmatized in a documentary . 
  it 's completely wrong of the ukrainian embassy to interfere in matters of this kind , but it 's been subjected to criticism domestically as well . 
  given the amount of criticism and the actual content i fully support the decision not to air it . 
  tv4 or other non state funded channels should be free to air it , but state funded media such as svt should keep it 's distance . 
  i 'd rather not have my taxes pay for russian revisionism on swedish tv . 
  http://www.svt.se/dokument-utifran/ukraina-revolutionens-morka-sida svt : s explanation , i 'd could translate it if any non-swedish speakers are interested . 
  edit : svt has decided to postpone the airing of the french documentary '' ukraine : the dark side of the revolution '' until further notice . 
   the film 's interesting and important , but during the work with the swedish version some uncertainties have come to our knowledge . 
  we 're currently working with investigating these in cooperation with the director of the film , says axel arn\u00f6 , project leader at svt : s dokument utifr\u00e5n . 
  do you mean that it contains inaccuracies ? 
   no , we have yet to find any inaccuracies . 
  however there are uncertainties regarding the description of the influence of far right groups . 
  i see no reason in publishing it if it turns out that the film provides a misguiding picture . 
  this is something that we require more time to decide on . 
  should n't you have checked on that before you bought the film ? 
   one might think so . 
  but i 'm no expert on every conflict . 
  paul moreira 's a experienced and awarded investigating reporter who 's the source for many films about conflicts around the world . 
  i have had no reasons to question his information before . 
  but in this case you do ? 
   it 's not that simple . 
  the conflict in ukraine is both complicated and infected . 
  in connection with us airing the film i was noticed about parts of it being interpreted as controversial . 
  which i have nothing against , but we 'll reassure us about what we 're airing is correct and relevant . 
  many feel like it 's cowardly of you to back off . 
  it ca n't be this easy to stop a film . 
   it 's not !, 
  but we 're happy to listen to everyone who can provide us sober and qualified assessment of our offers . 
  will you air the film ? 
   that 's the plan . 
  when ? 
   allow me to return with an answer . 
  i still see a possibility , 2 % might be overly optimistic but more than 1,5 % should be doable . 
  fb15 seems pretty unstable , and there 's no shortage of external factors such as this that will prompt parties to reevaluate their stance , but given their track record i might be too optimistic . 
  polls indicate that we 're closing in on a majority wanting to join nato rather than remain militarily unaligned . 
  49 % - 34 % with 17 % unsure were the latests numbers i could find . 
  seems like the rotor dislocated from the fuselage in flight , fucking horrible . 
  edit : forgot the source , http://www.tv2.no/v/1039640/, 
  swedish and finnish participation was requested by the icelandic government . 
  i do n't know about the finnish participation , but ours was done as a part of the norwegian deployment in during the first third of 2014 . 
  do n't know how many fighters we deployed , could be anything from 2 up to 6 . 
  all of them , but they have zero fighter aircraft which renders them unable to conduct qra by themselves . 
  i mean we could do it , we 're heavily connected to nato in almost every aspect . 
  not sure if we have the recourses to provide the baltic states with qra ourselves though , but we could definitely participate in bap and/or coordinate our efforts more . 
  we 've already participated in air policing in iceland , which is a nato mission . 
  we are n't neutral though , if we were to be pedantic . 
  have n't been since we joined the eu , we 're somewhat unaligned but that 's it . 
  the recent increase in defence spending is a good sign , it 's pretty much the first time since the mid 90 's we 've seen an increase instead of cuts , even if it is n't much . 
  given the relative majority in favor of joining nato , plus an increased will from politicians to actually fund our defence , 2 % is hardly impossible in the future . 
  especially if we are to remain outside of nato . 
  [ no we 're not ] ( http://i.imgur.com/iecibbk.png ) , there 's a significant relative majority in favor och joining nato as of 2015 . 
  source : msb . 
  also , nato 's an intergovernmental organization . 
  it does n't work like the eu where some bureaucrats in brussels tells you how you can use your tobacco , every nato member enjoys national self-determination . 
  the effect of russian aggression and threats on the opinions of swedes regarding this is quite clear in the polls . 
  the support for joining nato has grown continuously since putin and the boys got all soviet nostalgic and expansive , according to a poll done by our civil contingencies agency the support for joining nato is currently at 49 % iirc whilst the opposition to a membership is at roughly 35 % . 
  so in a larger context it seems like it works like reverse psychology , and the support is bound to increase given statements and threats like this . 
  the eu does n't grant us military support via article 42.7 , it only states that every member state is obliged to support another member in case of an attack etc. 
  you could fullfil your obligations by donating food or whatever .
