  you got 4 out of 8 parties in the parliament pushing the issue and a relative majority of the population supporting it . 
  both sweden and finland have signed the host nation support agreement and are close partners to nato , hence the attendance at the meeting . 
  also regarding the possibility of sweden ignoring it 's hypothetical future article 5 obligations , i do n't think that 's something to be concerned about . 
  we 've expressed a statement of solidarity towards our nordic and baltic neighbours stating that we wo n't stand idly by if they were to be attacked . 
  now i do n't know what that 's worth , but i do n't view us as the ones most likely to ignore the article 5 obligations . 
  no worries !, 
  i have plenty , if you speak swedish or norwegian . 
  however i recall seeing a seminar ( in english ) where swedish , finnish and norwegian analysts/experts participated , discussing nordic security politics . 
  i 'll see if i can find it !, 
  edit : [ part 1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kl2pouaqkx4 ) , [ part 2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7oya_un91e ), 
  joining nato together with you guys is mentioned at times , so you 'll know !, 
  national defence has n't been on the agenda for quite some time , it was n't until 2013 that people realized that perhaps we should n't have focused entirely on international operations at the cost of our national defence capabilities . 
  basing units strategically was n't really considered for quite some time . 
  to me it would be logical to have a air defence company on gotland , and one battalion within each of the two brigades ( as it is now ) with the battalions based together with the main components of their brigade to ensure availability . 
  and i would n't object to providing the air force with long-range sams to ensure protection on the strategic level . 
  i 'm flattered , though the occasional article related to security politics here is enough for me !, 
  both air defence battalions are based in halmstad . 
  the general explanation given by analysts is that gotland could be seized in conjunction with some kind of crisis in the baltic states . 
  i 'd guess that the political consequences of doing it today would pretty much fuck them up , take a look at the effects of the sanctions imposed due to crimea , mh17 etc. 
  invading an occupying parts of a eu country with strong links to nato would result in much harsher sanctions , tensions would be through the roof and relations to europe/us would be catastrophic . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://karlisn.blogspot.se/2015/03/isolerat-angrepp-mot-sverige-varfor-inte.html ) a pretty informative piece ( in swedish ) on the issue written by karlis neretnieks , former principle at the defence university , head of swedint and brigade co at gotland . 
  u137 , a soviet whiskey-class submarine which went aground deep inside the blekinge archipelago in a military exclusion zone back in 1981 . 
  they 'd have a hard time moving anything other than a small amount of light infantry though . 
  perhaps we should 've bought one of the mistrals from france ... 
  the subsurface fleet is one of few things we 'd be able to seriously pose a threat with , i 'm hoping we 'll keep a pair of the gotland-class ones after we get the new a26 's . 
  you forgot a c , 
  there 's several . 
  you got the borderline pacifist leftist claiming that nato would force us to go to war , that we 'd be a puppet to the us ( used by the far right/nationalists as well ) , that they 'd base nuclear weapons on swedish territory etc. 
  then there 's the more realistic arguments saying that we should build a credible defence of our own and avoid joining nato not to the escalate tensions in the baltic sea etc. 
  you get a lot of people saying that our policy of unalignment has been beneficial , and who questions why we should leave a policy that they believe works fine . 
  we 're not in nato , that 's the difference . 
  using military force against us would n't trigger article 5 , nor would it necessarily mean that they would precede to do the same to a nato country . 
  they would n't invade the swedish mainland either , it 's gotland that they 're interested in . 
  which they 'll be hesitant to do as we are n't members ,, 
  [ invisible indeed ] ( http://hjak.se/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/grundet.jpg ), 
  yeah , i mean this could n't possibly in any conceivable way be related to the actual actions of russia . 
  it 's just the security police being all russophobic and trying to influence public opinion . 
  yes , they had to be deployed to gotland from halmstad . 
  and the rbs 70 is a short range air defence system , i.e. 
  far from adequate to counter the air threats which would be present during a conflict on gotland . 
  what we need is 3-4 samp/t or patriot units on gotland . 
  what ? 
  we 're talking about intelligence personnel from the gru and svr , not infantry battalions . 
  they 'd pretty much have to be based in sweden as well if they were to participate in combat operations around gotland . 
  this alliance with finland everybody talking about is essentially a toothless tiger , it might look good on paper but in practise the effects and efficiency of it will be minimal . 
  there 's no reason to discuss a mainland invasion of sweden , as that 's highly unlikely . 
  what the russians are interested in is gotland , and we would n't be able to resits an attempt to take the island as of now . 
  the threshold will be higher when the battle group 's in place , but that will only delay an attack . 
  i explained it in a post further up , it could be taken in a day or two . 
  spetsnaz seizes control of the regional administration , a vacationing vdv battalion takes visby airport and the navy seizes slite harbor . 
  then they go on to deploy mid/long-range sam systems and establish a maritime presence in the vicinity of the island . 
  might be harder when the battle group 's in place , but that would only delay them for a couple of days . 
  besides gotland , a mainland invasion is extremely unlikely no matter how high the tensions get . 
  bleking might be of interest , but that 's about it . 
  how ? 
  seems weird to blame you guys just out of the blue , so given how there already was a dutch submarine present in our waters for exercises , that 's what lavrov went for . 
  that 's a wonderful excuse , given how the submarine had just participated in a joint exercise with us and was traveling at the surface through areas where everyone at shore could see it . 
  support is growing and polls indicate at relative majority in favor of joining . 
  but whilst i 'm pro-nato , we ca n't see it as a cheap quick fix . 
  first and foremost we have to strengthen our own capability , given the current spendings and state of the organisation we wo n't bring much to the table . 
  and we ca n't expect nato to have a couple of brigades ready to support us over night if we were to be attacked , realistically we 'd have to wait for a couple of weeks . 
  and during that time we need to be able to defend ourself . 
  nor could they , finland lacks an expeditionary capability , just as we do . 
  they could provide maritime support and possibly deploy fighters , but given possible retaliations from russia that 's no guarantee . 
  also , there are n't any bilateral agreements obligating neither of us to support each other militarily should we be attacked . 
  we 've continuously been cutting down on defence since 2000 , which most people realised was a bad idea after russia pulled it 's shit in ukraine . 
  defence spending 's roughly at 1,1 % currently . 
  we 're getting mid/long-range sams now , but they wo n't be operational until 2020 and i 'm fairly certain they 'll all be based in halmstad ( i.e. 
  on the west coast ) with zero on gotland . 
  so we 'd have to do a couple of c130 flights to gotland in order to deploy them there , which is only possible if there 's indications prior to a russian vacation . 
  it would definitely mean military support , but we 'd have to wait for a couple of weeks before this could be properly provided , similar to how norway expects it to take 3 weeks . 
  nato or not , we need to be able to defend ourself without any significant external support for a couple of weeks ** at ** ** least ** . 
  if it happened tomorrow there would be some skirmishes and a few losses on either side , but that 's it . 
  they could take gotland with a vdv battalion on vacation along with sf and support by air assets as well a maritime presence in the vicinity to deny us the ability to reenforce the island . 
  by 2017 a permanent battle group ( i.e. 
  a smaller battalion ) will be based at gotland , a mechanised rifle company , tank company along with a css coy . 
  it will mean a higher threshold , but we 'll still lack air defence systems etc on the island . 
  any lighter infantry force will be in trouble though , but the battle group will be extremely vulnerable to air threats . 
  the strategic advantages gained by attacking finland ( provided the attack is successful and the goals fulfilled ) would n't be that big . 
  if they want to project power/deny nato freedom of movement and the ability to support the baltic states , then gotland is the key . 
  and the door 's currently wide open , if they are n't frightened by a home guard battalion . 
  if we were attacked ? 
  entirely dependent on the form of attack , but it would be met with force . 
  with that said we would n't be able to sustain defensive operations for very long , and if gotland is attacked prior to 2017 it would be taken without resistance . 
  we wo n't have any permanent military presence on the island besides the home guard before 2017 . 
  this is of course hypothetical . 
  just noticed that , pretty weird that it has n't been reported until now . 
  this is definitely worrying . 
  so far the defence committee has called for a meeting with the military intelligence and security service ( must ) , but that ( and `` increased security '' at telecommunications masts ) is pretty much the only reaction so far . 
  they 're still buthurt about narva . 
  no definitely not , they 're obliged to do * something * . 
  what that * something * is in practise remains unknown , . 
  the president of estonia explained article 42.7 by saying that the obligation could be fulfilled by donating a bunch of olive oil . 
  regarding swedish/finnish military support for one another . 
  neither of us would be able to provide any serious support to each other in case someone was attacked , we both lack the expeditionary capability needed to transport any meaningful quantities of ground forces over the baltic sea . 
  any military support would be limited to aircraft and possibly navy vessels . 
  what would the eu do ? 
  article 42.7 does n't require a military intervention in case a member is attacked . 
  and given our lack of nato membership , a nato intervention would be very unlikely . 
   fucking duh , what did you expect , honestly ?
