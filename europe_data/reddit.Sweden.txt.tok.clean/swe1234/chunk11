  that russia would n't violate international law by annexing crimea and go on to initiate a war in eastern ukraine , i 'd guess . 
  but i suppose that was too much to hope for . 
  if it was sabotage by a so called foreign power , i 'm fairly certain who it was . 
  it 's not divergent from the current pattern of activities on our soil . 
  but we 'll have to wait until the investigation is done or more information is released . 
   why should russia invade in sweden or in the baltic states ? 
  it 's not likely to happen , but given the current tensions and uncertainty of what the future holds it 's not impossible . 
  the baltic sea is where nato and russia meets , and in case of a conflict parts of swedish territory would be of paramount importance for russia ( and nato ) if they are to be able to conduct operations in the baltic states . 
   this is paranoia nr .1 argument to dismiss any claims of russian aggression . 
  never mind the sabotaged telecommunications masts or explicit warning of increased russian intelligence gathering , psyops and military preparations . 
   by the way , do the swedens found the russian submarine ? 
  the presence of a submarine was confirmed , the nationality or type was n't . 
  kinda hard to conduct proper asw when the systems needed are n't yet operational . 
  the fallen telecommunications mast has been confirmed to be a case of sabotage according to the police , the armed forces and security services are involved in the investigation as well . 
  whilst it 's to early to blame someone , the fact that one of the main theories they 're investigating is sabotage by a `` foreign power '' is worrying . 
  conservative , but sure , love me . 
   after nato reopened the cold war . 
  the fuck are you talking about ? 
  i do n't recall nato initiating it 's fair share of frozen conflicts in europe ( i.e. 
  invading them in direct violation of international law ) and illegally having a military presence in neighbouring countries . 
  they did n't annex parts of ukraine either . 
  ok , sorry for slandering the socialist paradise of venezuela . 
  i 'll reconsider my choice of media outlets and instead use alternative and unbiased sources such as rt , sputnik and telesur . 
  ca n't trust the bourgeois media and their ruling class agenda . 
  well that 's a pretty fucking retarded way of putting it , unless you deliberately want to misinterpret shit for it to fit your narrative ofc . 
  and i get what he 's rambling on about , and he 's wrong . 
  that 's one way of putting it , and it 's wrong . 
  but if you want to misinterpret shit for it to fit your narrative , be my guest . 
  i can only speak for myself , but i do n't restrict my trust to sources who are critical towards something i do n't approve of . 
  with that being said , it remains pretty damn foolish to trust a media outlet funded by the venezuelan government for information on venezuelan affairs . 
  unless it fits your narrative of the big bad us pulling the strings behind every misfortune . 
  telesur 's partly funded by the venezuelan government , go find something a little less biased . 
  ca n't see why you 're all hung up on and offended by that post , you rambling on about what you think i ment is n't getting you anywhere , quite the opposite . 
  i 've explained what i ment , period . 
  also , i 'm 23 , so you decide if i fit into your idea of the younger generation . 
  well as i 've explained i did n't include any personal opinions in that post . 
  i was giving someone a hint to whom op might have ment , but you 're free to interpret it however you want . 
  i never relayed my opinion , i was encouraging someone to read the headline as it might answer their question . 
  hint : do n't make senseless posts . 
  no it 's not . 
  kaliningrad has always been heavily militarised , even before there was any considerable nato/us presence in the area ( besides the bap ) and when relations to the west was n't as shitty as they are today . 
  except they were n't just transporting stuff , they were approaching airspace which nato : s bap is tasked with protecting and were intercepted as per usual . 
  the russians do this ** all ** ** the ** ** time ** , it 's a way to test the reaction time of the qra . 
  hint : read the headline . 
  the presence of sigint platforms such as the so called `` spy plane '' is due to russian activity in the region . 
  given how the us is allied with the states in the region , it 's only natural that they support them with capabilities they lack . 
  the us have six allies in the region and two close partners . 
  non of the us 's allies or partners object to their presence , hell some of them even requested it to begin with . 
  no one denies that . 
  you still have to be able to discuss the atrocities committed by a specific actor without having to take everyone else 's atrocities into account . 
  ah , some good old whataboutism . 
  while we 're at it , you would n't mind providing me with a better alternative to housing like a hundred thousand captured combatants ? 
  it 's not like letting them go could possibly backfire in any way . 
  hardly comparable . 
  the baltics as well as many other ee countries were quite keen on joining nato and the eu to distance themselves from russia , russia has itself to blame . 
  do n't want your neighbours ganging up on you ? 
  do n't occupy and oppress them without consent for 50 + years , stop waving your dick in their face , annexing your neighbours territory and making recurrent threats and statements about how stronk and powerful you are . 
  to a degree , however i interpret the rest of the post as being negative towards to missile defence shield and the us : s stance towards russia . 
  i 'm all for being clear and honest regarding the threat the missile shield 's intended to counter , what i oppose is how it 's being received as antagonization of russia . 
  til a defensive missile defence system in a country who 've explicitly supported it is needless antagonisation . 
  it 's not like russia via it 's recent actions ( increased funding of the strategic missile troops as well as bolstering it 's nuclear arsenal ) have provoked counter actions such as this . 
   muslim ** and ** crazy or just crazy, 
  camping trips with complementary showers . 
  [ insufficient evidence ] ( http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/098/084/243.png ), 
  sucks , accidentally commiting a terrorist attack 's the worst way to start the day, 
  the same deputy pm who called 9/11 an accident . 
  missed by no one !, 
  do n't even bother , the sheer amount of stupidity , twisted logic and hypocrisy in his post speaks for itself . 
  only to replace hitlers tyranny with their own for about 50 years . 
  and do what ? 
  no one has suggested anything even remotely doable , it 's all `` deport them '' ( even though most are second generation immigrants and have citizenships ) or `` demolish those areas '' ( when there 's no housing to replace it with ) . 
  i suggest we fund the police , hire more officers , get law enforcement back in order and clean the shit up . 
  we 're not too happy with the situation either . 
  then why do n't you hook them up with some of your internet expertise ? 
  not sure if i 'm amused or bothered by your blatant lack of background knowledge . 
  mostly gangs and local youths , most recently arrived immigrants stay at asylum centers . 
  the problems are largely connected to the state of the police organization . 
  underfunded , underpayed , undermanned and drowning in a sea of horrible administration , making it hard ( if not impossible ) to do their job . 
  a lack of political action to actually solve the problems play a role as well , this is n't a recent occurrence , those areas have been shit for well over a decade . 
  how about we end the discussion here ? 
  there 's obviously no reason to hold a realistic discussion with you . 
  they 've been saying that for quite some time . 
  differences being that the complaints and warnings of officers on the streets are n't acknowledged by articles such as this . 
  regarding the grenades , it has happened once ( grenade being thrown at the police ) , which is bad enough . 
  the rest have been thrown by rivaling gangs at each other . 
  might be a plausible solution in theory , but it 's impossible in practise . 
  we have no housing to replace it with , there 's not enough police officers to go around , and the dissatisfaction would reach epic levels . 
  you 'd have thousands of people rioting . 
  and by deportation i assume you mean from the areas in question , deporting them from the country wo n't work as most of them are citizens and born here . 
   go in and fuck the troublemakers over properly , but skip the collective punishment . 
  i explicitly said that we should fight them , and do it hard . 
  i 'm only sceptical to demolishing the housing of hundreds of thousands of people of whom a vast majority are n't involved in any criminal activities . 
  i did n't say that poor economical conditions was a legitimate excuse either , i claimed that they use it as a motive to pull their bullshit . 
  i agree that the government is to blame , both the current one and the former ones . 
  ehh , i 'm all for properly enforcing the law in these areas , as are everyone except for some green party voters in central stockholm . 
  not wanting to demolish entire areas and making hundreds of thousands of people homeless is n't that weird . 
  when has collective punishment on the scale that demolishing the housing of this amount of people ever worked ? 
  you do n't think making people who 're already living in what 's essentially a parallel society homeless would create even more problems ? 
  they already use the imagined lack of jobs and economical inequality in the areas as an excuse to throw rocks at the police and burn cars . 
  making like a hundred thousand people homeless wo n't do anything better , quite the opposite .
