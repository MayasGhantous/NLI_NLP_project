  you ** could ** conclude ( albeit incorrectly ) that due to both germany and russia being in favor of nord stream they are therefore allies , though it takes more to be considered allies than having ** one ** mutual economical interest . 
   i do n't know , germany seems to be doing well . 
  then again they are n't an ally of russia , they 're a business partner ** at ** ** most ** . 
  that 's already a task obliged to intelligence/security agencies and the police , which i assume you knew already . 
  unless you favor the creation of the ministry for defence against radical islam of course . 
  was n't even included in the discussion , but how could russian wrongdoings be discussed without mentioning the us ? 
  it would n't be that farfetched to assume that you 're wrong either . 
  no , though you 're right , had a look at the budget , mbt 's would be a money drain . 
  for the purchase and operational costs of a relevant quantity you 'd get more bang for the buck by investing it in vehicle mounted at missiles , more javelin launchers/missiles , used cv90 's etc. 
  official sources says non were killed , but 11 wounded : https://twitter.com/uacrisis/status/811888004361048064, 
  solid , that ought to equal at least a mechanized battalion + some left over for usage elsewhere . 
  any plans to acquire more and/or complement them with mbt 's ? 
  huh ? 
  perhaps , though i think it 's a reasonable way to describe what the baltics got from the soviet occupation . 
  nice to see the cv90 's in use , how many were bought ? 
  give me a break , the implementation of `` the soviet ideas '' in the baltic states led to nothing but misery , anyone with half a brain could conclude that that 's why they 're not overly fond of russia . 
  who would be ? 
  russia in it 's current form does n't exactly encourage a different attitude towards itself either . 
  not intervening in libya would n't have been any better , the civil war would have be prolonged indefinitely and you 'd have a similar situation as in syria . 
   2 ) the us bombing in syria also stemmed quite a number of civilian casualties , most notably blowing up of a doctors without borders clinic , killing children and medical volunteers . 
  not in syria , but once in afghanistan , and they launched an investigation into the matter , stood responsible and paid compensations . 
  the hospital ** bombings ** ( there have been several ) in syria have all been either russia or the syrian regime , no responsibility has been taken whatsoever . 
  i you re-read my comment you 'll see that i was n't referring to the response to this event , i have n't even had a look at the thread on / r/russia . 
  i mentioned the sub among the other two whilst referring to the general content of the comments on / r/worldnews as a sub . 
  i 'm well aware , the comments often comes of like a cancerous mix of / r/russia , / r/conspiracy and / r/the _ donald . 
  one of the top comment on the / r/worldnews thread is already calling it `` a perfect intelligence job aiming to harm turkish-russian relations '' , wo n't be long til the cia/mossad/shapeshifting lizards theories goes ballistic . 
  an actual army of a sovereign country is n't a proxy army by any name . 
  60 airframes will indeed be take out of service and stripped of components for the new ng version . 
  there will still be roughly 30 c/d aircraft left , aircraft which could be leased , sold or kept in service . 
  we 'll have to wait and see , swedish defence politics are very dynamic and unpredictable right now . 
  lets just say that they have less than friendly intentions given the pattern of activities aimed at us . 
   you can look at kiev 's actions in donbass to guesstimate how such democratic and legal referendum would go . 
  it 's only natural that you respond to violent separatism orchestrated by a foreign power with force . 
  there 's a large difference between the course of actions in eastern ukraine and what would have been the case if there had been a legal referendum , primarily due to the later requiring the consent of ukraine and having to be done in accordation to the constitution . 
  now given the circumstances , it 's only natural that ukraine would n't hold a referendum when the region wanting to secede is a russian proxy . 
   and again , kosovo did n't have a referendum at all , and sweden still recognized its independence . 
  am i responsible for sweden recognizing kosovo ? 
  i was n't even allowed to vote in the election when the government responsible for said recognition took power . 
  how about focusing on the topic at hand instead of diverting the discussion to an entirely different topic ? 
   because in that case u/swe1234 will be angry at us . 
  whether or not i 'll be angry is completely irrelevant , they did however anger quite a large portion of the international community and got some nice sanctions imposed on themselves . 
  kinda cute that you buy the kremlins excuses of intervening due to humanitarian reasons to save the terribly oppressed russians . 
  the motives could n't possibly be strategical , like they were out the maintain access to a sweet harbor and increase their ability to project influence in the black sea . 
  given the misery caused by their proxy war , it would n't be farfetched to assume that they give zero shits about the russians they so passionately claim to be out to protect . 
  you do realize that russia is the legal successor state of the ussr right ? 
  well there you said it , guess i wo n't need to repeat myself . 
  no , it 's a conspiracy theory due to there being little to no evidence supporting it . 
  that i dislike it is irrelevant . 
  american and european politicians expressed their support , they did n't arm the protesters , orchestrate a coup or launch an invasion of the country . 
  it 's different from what russia has done/is doing in ukraine in every way imaginable . 
  yes , but russia does n't have the right to seize sovereign territory with military force . 
  i 'd have zero problems with crimea seceding from ukraine if there had been a democratic and legal referendum , now that was n't the case . 
  the legitimacy of a referendum where the observers are masked russian spetsnaz is non-existent , the annexation was in violation of the budapest memorandum and a grave violation of international law . 
  every syllable in your post justifies russias actions in georgia and ukraine . 
  afghanistan and the taliban regime harboured the individuals responsible for 9/11 , they most certainly did attack the us first . 
  iraq was another deal , and i wo n't defend it . 
  concerning libya , that was more of a european gig , plus it was un mandated , and rightfully so given the bloodbath which would have followed if there had n't been an intervention . 
  the us did n't attack syria , the escalation to the current shitshow ensued when the regime responded with force to what initially were peaceful protest . 
  as for ukraine , get your ass over to / r/conspiracy if you want to masturbate to rt theories about euromaidan being a us coup . 
  of course they are n't , they 're actively supported on all levels by russia . 
  does n't change the fact that euromaidan ** was n't ** a us coup . 
  not really , sounds equally stupid . 
  no concern to be shown in that case , because the us did n't overthrow yanukovych 's regime . 
  if that 's what you 're implying . 
  not even remotely , i 'm saying that the map shows nato deployments in member states bordering russia . 
  i 'm just as opposed to russian foreign policy and its expansionism as you . 
  the map only includes nato deployments ** on ** russias borders , hence the absence of other deployments . 
  that 's exactly why it 's retarded . 
  soviet hegemony under stalin sure sounds fun , unless you 're somewhat reasonable of course , and do n't fancy mass deportations and genocide . 
  without the lend-lease program to the uk and ussr , they would n't have been able to sustain the war , and without american involvement an allied offensive on the western front nor in italy would n't have been possible . 
  sure , the war might have ended with an allied victory , but it would have been prolonged , a shitload of people would die , and you 'd end up with global soviet hegemony . 
  sounds like a fucking blast does n't it ? 
  in some cases absolutely , though there have been examples when party representatives went full retard and expressed their support and admiration of putin and his policies in general . 
  a * might be added to the sweden democrats as well . 
  the party itself is n't pro-russian , their official stance is quite clear on that part . 
  they do however have a significant amount of representatives and supporters expressing those kind of views . 
  re-introducing the system without notifying the defence committee and not having the media pick up on the story . 
  it 's not controversial , it is however surprising that it was done entirely in house , in a manner that seems secret . 
  a hasty solution to say the least , barely a month after the decision to immediately re-militarize gotland before the permanent unit arrives next year . 
  it has n't been specified yet , but it 's most likely the mkii version already in use aboard navy corvettes and the gripen fighters . 
  are they really a stable presence though ? 
  they 're actively involved in syria , lebanon , palestine , yemen and iraq via its proxies . 
  and how 's the iranian regime showing signs of moderation and liberation ? 
  they still engage in medieval type punishment and executions for petty crimes , holocaust denial as high as on state level etc. 
  now i fully support the nuclear deal , and it would be foolish to abandon it . 
  but i ca n't see why we should support a repressive theocracy with a horrendous , ongoing , human rights record any more than we do by supporting the preservation of the nuclear deal . 
  why pick sides ? 
  both are shit , fuck them . 
   syria  started by the usa wat ? 
  not relevant , like at all . 
  this is a result of incompetence and lack of security within a departement . 
  yes , swedish , danish , german and dutch as well . 
  at the request of the malian government and the un . 
  sure thing bro , all western precense in africa is colonialism . 
  never minds the massive popular support for foreign military presence in mali , for example . 
  edit : there are eu training missions in several african countries as well , and guess on who 's request . 
  hardly a relevant comparison given how that occurred during the 15th and 16th centuries , this is happening right now . 
  yeah i 'm sure you of all people would know that . 
  what else are the jews \u2122 responsible for ? 
  no it 's not , it 's backed by * individuals * who happens to be jews .
