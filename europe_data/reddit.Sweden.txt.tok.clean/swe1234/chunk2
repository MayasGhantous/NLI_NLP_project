  the article specifically states that it does n't undermine an eu members commitments under nato . 
  we are n't even neutral . 
  we 're militarily unaligned to some extent , but not fully given our eu membership and the nato host nation support agreement . 
  they 've ordered 12 f16 's from portugal , which is n't much , but it 's better than flying old mig-21 's . 
  given how many air force 's are phasing out their f16 's for the f35 , romania ought to be able to get their hands on some of them . 
  i 'd be happy to lease/sell them som gripen c/d 's as well , similar to what we 've done with the czech republic and hungary . 
  that initiative was n't connected to sd as a party but initiated by supporters running a pro-sd site . 
  i do n't oppose the principle of doing it , it 's a good thought and a big fuck you to all regressive religious cunts out there . 
  what i find remarkable is the hypocrisy behind it , given how the individuals behind the initiative are borderline homophobic otherwise , and are n't doing it in support of the sexual minorities effected by the bullshit imposed on them by regressive islamists in said areas . 
  i 'd like to see a wider initiative from all of society in doing something similar , not just something cooked up by a bunch of sd supporters who use it to get medial attention and do n't really care about the actual issue . 
  standard pro-russian operating procedures in other words . 
  a source for your claims would n't hurt , your essentially spreading the exact version provided to the russian population via state controlled media . 
  the u.s. spent way more on ukraine than russia after the collapse of the soviet union , see / u/mogerroor 's reply . 
  it 's a threat , regardless of the context . 
  if you feel threatened by purely defensive measures being taken to reduce the harm of your offensive capabilities , and voice your complains in a way such as this , then you might be the aggressor . 
  and i 'm merely a grunt , not an nco , not an officer , just an ordinary guy doing my job . 
  my training did n't include security politics and geopolitical strategy , what i know and think about it i 've learned by myself . 
  or not enough rt perhaps ? 
  as i 'm sceptical towards russia and the threat it poses rather than obnoxious and naive . 
  and i 'd like to remind you that you expressed concern about the u.s. initiating a war with russia in an earlier post . 
  russian revisionism , how refreshing . 
  it totally was n't caused by yanukovych 's government suspending preparations for signing the ukraine -- european union association agreement with the european union in order to seek closer economic relations with russia . 
  [ here you go ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/russia-threatens-denmark-with-nuclear-weapons-if-it-tries-to-join-nato-defence-shield-10125529.html ) . 
  you might also want to look up the recent zapad exercises , especially the one back in 09 . 
  i 'm swedish ( part german if that matters ) and employed by the armed forces , as my personal life apparently 's relevant for the discussion . 
  there 's also ** zero ** u.s. military personnel stationed in sweden . 
  and why should n't i be worried about russia ? 
  it 's not like they 've done anything in europe recently that might be a cause of conc ... oh wait . 
  criticize u.s. foreign policy all you want , does n't change the situation in europe . 
  who initiated a war in ukraine and denied their involvement , annexed crimea , was involved in shooting down a civilian airliner , practically seized what is formally georgian territory by initiating frozen conflicts , threatened to use nuclear weapons against nato members and held exercises simulating nuclear strikes and conventional attacks on eastern europe ? 
   us starting a war with russia i see you have a good imagination . 
  no but seriously , how 's that course of events likely ? 
  given who 's responsible for the ongoing destabilisation and aggressions in europe you might want to change the order of the two parts . 
  so far kdu 's the only ones who 've put it that way , which is n't much given they 're a youth organisation . 
  whilst wanting to increase our participation in operations against them , neither m nor kd have been that straight forward in their rhetoric , sadly . 
  it 's undoubtedly a mentality which is common in some parties/among individuals with certain opinions ( socially left-leaning liberals , socialists etc ) . 
  you 'd do best not to generalise like that though , a significant majority opposes liberal immigration policies and coddling with individuals such as these . 
  for reference , the current government is supported by less than 30 % according to a recent poll , and the green party is supported by less than 5 % in the same poll . 
  i see it more as an attempt to promote their interpretation of islam and gain medial attention to their cause , using a political party as a platform . 
  sure , i 've yet to read about anyone with these radical beliefs promoting restrictive immigration , but i do n't think their primary intent is to promote liberal immigration policies . 
  thing is , they were pretty good at hiding it . 
  it was n't a particularly well kept secret , but they did their best to hide behind the soft and feminist label of the party , which apparently worked . 
  there 's still representatives of the party defending them and who opposes the decision . 
  it 's first now , when a minister was forced to resign and another representative left his positions , that light has been shed on the matter . 
  the responsibility lies entirely with the party , if you 're so blinded by your political correctness that you refuse to acknowledge the incompatibility of islamist ideology with the progressive values you so passionately say you base your politics on , then you might have a problem . 
  and a pretty serious one as well . 
  i do , thanks for noticing !, 
  definitely , there was even threats aimed at switzerland , as well as claims of cells being present there . 
  goes to show that you risk being targeted regardless of your position in the campaign against them . 
  we do have a special forces contingent in iraq , not sure if your average isis member 's aware of that though . 
  it 's much easier to get into europe disguised as a refugee . 
  getting cells into the u.s. is n't exactly easy and at the slightest hint of this going on security services would be all over it . 
  and who in their right mind would enter openly ? 
  i 'd expect that the fbi , homeland security , cia , ice etc. 
  have better knowledge of isis activities and who 's in it than anyone else , plus they have pretty extensive cooperations with their european equivalents . 
  if you got fucked over upon arrival , you 'd blow the whole shit essentially as the authorities would be aware of it happening . 
  `` if we want a party which reflects the society we live in , everyone has to feel welcome '' - brita wessinger , a regional green party representative . 
  i suppose this is what extreme naivety and utopian thinking gets you . 
  there are sympathisers at least , there 's been a couple of attacks attributed to them . 
  i 'd have a hard time believing they have any significant isis cells similar to what exists in europe though , the possibilities to communicate and coordinate efforts with the ones in syria/iraq is limited . 
  pretty damn hard to reach north america in a clandestine fashion as well , and being a member of isis certainly does n't make it easier . 
  the f-22 can not be exported under american federal law , this is to protect it 's stealth technology and other features . 
  it 's the f35 that 's exported , and there 's a lot indicating that it did n't turn out quite as good as everyone hoped it would . 
  debunking russias ridiculous conspiracy theories and desinformation = hating russia . 
  edit : my sense for sarcasm appears to have been lost, 
  no they did n't , it was approved/requested by your government/parliament . 
  also , which country is it you 're talking about ? 
  yes i believe that , since all decision making in nato is based on consensus . 
  you 're more than welcome to provide me with proof indicating the opposite . 
  and yes , nato is largely funded by the us , which is n't that weird if you think about it ... 
  you 'd have nothing to win by leaving , and you do n't have anything to loose by staying , at least from my point of view . 
  being a member of nato grants you influence in the alliances decision making , facilitates better intelligence cooperation and allows you do partake in both large and small scale exercises , which in turn is important to further develop the operational efficiency of your armed forces . 
  not saying that the eu would n't do anything , they most certainly would do ** something ** . 
  but i find it very unlikely that it would be anything militarily . 
  which country ? 
  not really . 
  article 42.7 does n't require a member state to provide military support if another member was to be attacked , as opposed to article 5 in nato . 
  you could donate 1000 bottles of olive oil as your support , as said by the estonian president . 
  the article also states that it does n't undermine commitments under nato . 
  then why does n't he drag his old ass to russia ? 
  just to see if his retarded idea is as nice in practice as in theory . 
  you 'd have to specify that , came of as you were one of those guys accusing germany for greece 's self-inflicted financial fuck ups . 
  but in that case , germany ( west germany to specify ) has payed compensation to greece . 
  funny thing though , when they managed to fuck up their economy even more , the pm came out demanding that germany pay complete reparations which oddly enough has n't been demanded by anyone else than greece . 
  what has russia ever done to compensate for any of the atrocities inflicted by the soviet union ? 
  i ca n't think of any . 
  there 's a major difference though . 
  greece was n't continuously raped in all imaginable ways by germany for 50 years , nor did they have communism shoved down their throat . 
   from what ~ ~ you ~ ~ every sane person call occupation ftfy, 
  what a complete fucking load of crap . 
  but sure , allow a minister in a western democracy to associate with islamists and ultranationalist/fascists/terrorists ( not even sure which term 's the most fitting to describe them ) all he wants , after all , he 's an ally in the fight against the far right . 
  antisemitic might be an overstatement , but it 's distasteful as fuck nevertheless . 
  and yes , he hung out with islamists . 
  he was even the chairman of an islamic group with connections to the muslim brotherhood , and seemingly close friends with individuals who have been to egypt to support the muslim brotherhood . 
  he also dined with the ultranationalist and borderline fascist `` grey wolves '' , also present at the dinner was the now renowned fuckhead who called for the death of `` armenian dogs '' . 
  he should resign from all his political positions , and his pathetic joke of a party should shit-can him . 
  edit : could n't get the wikipedia article on the grey wolves to work within the text itself , so here it is : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grey_wolves_ ( organization ), 
  he might be member of the party , but nothing more . 
  from what i 've heard he had to resign after the parliamentary election of 2014 , if he did n't get enough votes or if he was shit-canned by the party remains unknown . 
  does n't make it legitimate , it 's an illegal annexation .
