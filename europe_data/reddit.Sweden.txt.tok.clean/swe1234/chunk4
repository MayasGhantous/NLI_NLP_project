  the bap qra ( manned by denmark at the time ) scrambled two f16 to intercept a 6 ship formation of russian fighter/strike aircraft who had violated swedish airspace . 
  we had no qra on readiness at that time ( night time during the easter ) weirdly enough . 
  i 'm more than happy to have a discussion based on facts , but if you 're gon na go with some sputnik level conspiracy theories i 'm just gon na ask you to fuck off , sincerely !, 
  hit me up if you want some tinfoil to that tinfoil hat of yours . 
  you 're missing the point . 
  all decision making in nato is based on consensus , hence you need consensus within the organisation in order for nato as an alliance to do something . 
  nato ca n't control what the u.s. does outside the alliance , such as the iraq invasion ( which to clarify was n't a nato operation in any way ) . 
  i do n't know where you got all that shit from , but it 's completely wrong . 
  difference being the context of the violations , two of the u.s. violations were by civilian planes , and one by a rc-135 which turned away after being asked to do so by air traffic control . 
  they have also initiated talks with our mfa in order to avoid similar incidents in the future . 
  russia never acknowledges or apologises for it 's violations , violations which at least once have taken place whilst conducting exercises simulating strikes on targets in sweden ( 29th of march , 2013 ) . 
  way to go !, 
  we did n't discuss what the u.s. has done , we discussed the nato presence in eastern europe . 
  and no , nato is not a platform for the u.s. to project it 's power . 
  all decision making in nato is based on consensus , which gives every members a kind of veto . 
  you might also want to take a look at how two prominent nato members , france and germany were some of the most prominent critics of the iraq invasion . 
  a 6 ship formation of russian fighter/strike aircraft violated our airspace during an exercise simulating a nuclear strike back in 2013 . 
  a pretty deliberate incursion , given how the entire formation entered swedish airspace . 
  if that 's not a case of russia violating sovereign airspace i do n't know what is . 
  there 's a reason why most eastern european countries are members of nato , and the reason is 50 + years of constantly being raped and oppressed by russia . 
  as long as russia 's waving it 's dick around , breaking international agreements and invading and annexing territory from it 's neighbours , nato have every reason to be present in russias neighbouring countries . 
  it 's not like nato annexed or forced these countries into the alliance , they all choose to join . 
  plus russia signed an agreement with nato back in 1997 , an agreements in which russia agrees that everyone is free to join nato . 
  yet they whine like a bunch of 5th graders about being surrounded and shit . 
  here 's parts of the agreement : `` to achieve the aims of this act , nato and russia will base their relations on a shared commitment to the following principles : - development , on the basis of transparency , of a strong , stable , enduring and equal partnership and of cooperation to strengthen security and stability in the euro-atlantic area ; - acknowledgement of the vital role that democracy , political pluralism , the rule of law , and respect for human rights and civil liberties and the development of free market economies play in the development of common prosperity and comprehensive security ; - refraining from the threat or use of force against each other as well as against any other state , its sovereignty , territorial integrity or political independence in any manner inconsistent with the united nations charter and with the declaration of principles guiding relations between participating states contained in the helsinki final act ; - ** respect ** ** for ** ** sovereignty ** , ** independence ** ** and ** ** territorial ** ** integrity ** ** of ** ** all ** ** states ** ** and ** ** their ** ** inherent ** ** right ** ** to ** ** choose ** ** the ** ** means ** ** to ** ** ensure ** ** their ** ** own ** ** security ** , the inviolability of borders and peoples ' right of self-determination as enshrined in the helsinki final act and other osce documents ; - mutual transparency in creating and implementing defence policy and military doctrines ; - prevention of conflicts and settlement of disputes by peaceful means in accordance with un and osce principles ; - support , on a case-by-case basis , of peacekeeping operations carried out under the authority of the un security council or the responsibility of the osce . '', 
  or russia could stop behaving like a whiny 12 year old who 's provoked by everything and everyone . 
  that pilot 's gon na be flying a cargo plane full of rubber dog shit to hong kong . 
  one could also argue that russia 's the one creating unnecessary tensions in the baltic sea , tensions that forces the u.s. to support their nato allies in the region . 
  the baltic states has even requested an increased u.s. presence in the region , and why could that be ? 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but i 've yet to see or hear anything about non russian fighter jets doing flybys less than 30 feet of vessels belonging to a country you 're their not exactly friends with . 
  `` we 're totally objective and neutral on all matters '', 
  agreed , the recurrent semi-sarcastic comment on how doomsday 's coming and shit are pretty annoying . 
  i share the concern about the matter , but that shit 's just pessimistic as fuck and destructive ( in lack of a better word ) towards the overall discussion , it would be nice to have a filter . 
  every time i scroll sweddit someone 's reminding me about how bad shit is , which i know , i do n't need to be reminded of it every second hour or so by a link to fria tider . 
  i agree with you to some extent , you ca n't go on / r/sweden without encountering masses of posts related to immigration , something which has grown to be quite annoying . 
  concerning the racism part our perceptions differ , the concern about immigration is understandable , and there 's not to much racism ( in the actual sense of the notion ) going on . 
  there is some bullshit , but just ignore it if it bothers you . 
  straight out racism usually gets downvoted anyway . 
  where can i get a toy saddam ? 
  well that 's fucking retarded . 
  this have yet to be implemented anywhere else as far as i know , and you 're completely free to voice your opinions on immigration without having measures taken against you , as opposed to what you implied in the earlier post . 
  do you have a source ? 
  because i have n't heard anything about it , seems straight out illegal to take measures against a student for voicing his opinions on immigration . 
  this is like the 10th time this has been posted in less than a week ... 
  always had a thing for the baltics , fucking depressing what the russian turned parts of it into . 
  understandable . 
  would the 30 % refer to the russian minority ? 
  i 've been told the integration of them has n't been without problems . 
  not even sure if your average joe within in said subculture knowns what any of those things actually means . 
  they are n't a particularly academic bunch , i 'd guess they use it `` because it 's cool '' . 
  `` we 're no racist cowboys . 
  to us the confederate flag is a rebellious symbol as we aim to free ourselves from the norms of the society and powers in general . 
  the music we listen to and our car culture is native to the american south . 
  hence the relevance of the confederate flag . '', 
  - [ the hard on for the american south as described by a raggare . 
  quite surprised you got them as well , given how you barely accept any immigrants at all . 
  [ these guys ] ( http://www.pinupsandkustoms.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/raggare-ett-nordiskt-fenomen-image-4.jpg ) , commonly known as `` raggare '' . 
  not really . 
  poland has less than half your population and a much smaller gdp , yet they still have 120 000 active service members ( you have just under 180 000 ) and are n't to far behind you in terms of vehicles and other material . 
  plus i 've worked with german units , these billions are n't anywhere to be seen according to the guys i spoke with . 
  my guess would be that you 've fallen into the same shit as we have . 
  spending billions on shit that never reaches the units nor contributes to operational efficiency . 
  i 'm unsure wether or not its an obligation or a recommendation . 
  what i objected to was your statement about how germany spends four times as much on military expenses as poland , which yet again does n't mean anything given the fact that your gdp is larger than polands . 
  the obligation/recommendation exists to make sure that every member state provides the alliance with as much as 2 % of their gdp ( or more ) can offer . 
  you seem to be missing out on what the nato requirement means . 
  it 's not about how much money you spend in $ , but how much of your gdp you spend . 
  and the nato requirement is as you may know 2 % . 
  spending 2 % on military expenses hurts polands wallet just as much as it would hurt your . 
  yes , because your gdp 's bigger than polands . 
  dude at 0:22 got it . 
  that has to be the most farfetched and bizarre comparison i 've seen for a very long time . 
  there is undoubtedly some fucked up shit going on in the cultural sector and on some universities . 
  but being reported for something does n't mean anything , any idiot can report someone for literally anything . 
  most of this bullshit is ridiculed by anyone with half a brain as well . 
  individuals reporting bullshit exists everywhere and happens all the time , nothing will happen juridically . 
  one individual reported a teacher for a bullshit reason = parody of a country . 
  totally makes sense . 
  never . 
  but there are , as i suppose you know , other ways to distinguish hostlie intents . 
  a drastic increase of intelligence gathering carried out by russian autorites towards both sensitive military and civilian infrastructure , air force exercises aimed at targets in sweden , aggressive behaviour towards swedish aircraft in international airspace , testing our qra 's reaction time recurrently , and violations of our airspace so intentional it 's embarrassing . 
  the reason for this ? 
  the strategic importance of gotland , to give you a hint . 
  russia 's doing that just fine by themselves , no need for the u.s. to spend time or resources on it . 
  sure , he want `` peace '' with russia , but on what terms ? 
  european security certainly is n't a priority for him . 
  while he might land some sweet agreement with his new best pall in the kremlin , europe is left to it 's own with russia , completely lacking the deterring factor that the u.s. presence and commitment provided . 
  and no , hillary do n't want war with russia . 
  i do n't like her and i do n't want her , but come on . 
  the u.s. and russia have completely opposite interests regarding security , and they have obligations ( which they have been quite keen on emphasising recently ) to assist in the defence of europe , just as any other nato member . 
  if taking your security interests ( as opposed to some appeasement bullshit ) and obligations seriously makes you a war monger , i 'd rather just call it quits and end this discussion here . 
  if you 're looking for an argument against him , how the fuck is he supposed to get mexico to pay for his wall ? 
  it 's his fucking idea , how about he fund it himself ? 
  other than that , he 's a grave risk for security and stability in europe . 
  his positive attitude towards putin combined with his scepticism towards nato will destabilise the entire alliance and potentially withdraw the most potent and deterring factor in nato , the u.s. military . 
  even with the european nato members spending the recommended 2 % , the baltics will still be in a bad spot . 
  combine this with fucking up relations with china and you 'll have a new hotspot in the pacific , plus a china more likely to turn towards russia . 
  ** edit : ** shutting down parts of the internet and killing terrorists families might not be a good idea either . 
  well , there has been isis cells attempting to establish themselves in the pa. 
  thank the israeli security services for said attempts being thwarted .
