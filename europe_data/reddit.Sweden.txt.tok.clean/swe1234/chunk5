  isis would be more than glad to see that logic put into practise . 
  [ good enough ? 
  the nazi salutes should qualify them for that label . 
  not impossible . 
  i mean , i 'd rather have a jdam ( or a shitload of unguided bombs in this case ) dropped on my position than be captured by is . 
  alright , take your pick . 
  one organisation is lead by a belgian nazi and has stated that it shares the values of vladimir putin , the other 's a democratic organisation with a proven track record of unbiased monitoring of ** legitimate ** elections , among other things . 
  hell , osce have even been accused of having a pro-russian bias for their activities in eastern ukraine . 
  wether or not that 's true i 'll avoid commenting , but it kinda speaks for itself . 
  if osce allegedly has a pro-russian bias , why did they consider the crimea referendum to be illegitimate ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/organization_for_security_and_co-operation_in_europe https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eurasian_observatory_for_democracy_and_elections, 
  point being ? 
  aidar is undoubtedly a bad bunch , but they are a legitimate military unit under the command of the ukrainian ministry of defence . 
  in what way was the referendum legitimate ? 
  osce declared the referendum as unconstitutional and did n't send observers . 
  observers from the eurasian observatory for democracy & elections , which is a far-right russia-based self-proclaimed election monitoring organisation , was present . 
  what they reported can hardly be considered to have any value whatsoever given the obvious bias of the organisation . 
  this was aimed at the eutm facilities in bamako , no sf there to my knowledge . 
  a friend of mine did a deployment there , all conventional forces training malian military and law enforcement . 
  they are n't involved in any operations . 
  it 's not fucking colonialism if said country invites european nations to train their military and assist them in providing security . 
  also , as it seems you 're implying that the cunts responsible for bullshit like this is fighting against foreign occupation . 
  aqim is a mismatched bunch of islamists from the entire sahel region , it 's members are n't necessarily native to mali . 
  they 're just there to impose their bullshit because it says so in some book . 
  you 're a special kind of retard . 
  [ these ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/al-qaeda_in_the_islamic_maghreb ) are most likely the ones responsible for the attack , which was aimed at foreign military personnel present in the country at the ** request ** and ** invitation ** of the malian government . 
  if aqim are n't terrorists , then who the fuck are ? 
  edit : just noticed your username , things makes much more sense now . 
  fuck the establishment !!, 
  the amount of overtime each officer works is absolutely ridiculous . 
  they are insanely undermanned as far as ordinary public order duties goes , there are n't even enough to do desk jobs such as investigation or just simple hr . 
  they might very well have received a call deemed more urgent than escorting journalists , i 'm not even sure they were tasked with providing escort for them . 
  there are n't enough officers to spare for tasks such as that , nor have i heard of journalists receiving escort in similar areas before . 
  only indirectly when embedding with police , which 60 minutes did n't . 
  i wo n't argue against the first statement , they are indirectly enabling it to some extent . 
  however the police are working their asses off and doing what they can , despite insufficient funding and being gravely undermanned . 
  not to well . 
  they still have to respond to crimes committed in these areas , so naturally they have to go there . 
  it 's not at the level of some french suburbs yet . 
  of course it is , but the police force 's undermanned and underfunded , rendering them unable to properly deal with it . 
  so what ? 
  she 's still not at fault and should n't even be on trial . 
  edit : thanks for the downvotes , does n't change the fact that a ukrainian citizen was abducted from ukrainian territory by separatists lacking legal authority . 
  fair enough , they 're pelted with stones and all kinds of shit several times a week in these areas . 
  for them to be on the receiving end of this they would need to go there . 
  good enough for you ? 
  wrong , they go there daily . 
  source : friend in the police who works quite a lot in these areas , shit aint pretty . 
  you seem to have missed out on the fact that jeremy corbyn 's running shit now . 
  if labour under his leadership 's only a leftist party in the sense that they 're called labour , how far left does a party have to be to be considered left ? 
   he added that he decided to go to russia , a country which he describes as `` a country with freedom of speech , and rights for journalists ! '' that 's some / r/nottheonion shit right there . 
  seems like it 's way past bedtime for my part , sorry for the misunderstanding !, 
  very few of these parties are actually part of the government in their respective country . 
  they are in power in the sense that they sit in the parliament , but to say that they `` are the government '' and are pushing their opinions on people is simply untrue . 
  might want to add that i 'm not to happy to see them gaining increased influence , and i despise some of the parties depicted , but come on dude . 
  your entire argumentation suggests the opposite , make up your mind . 
  that does n't really answer the question . 
  again , what is the ukrainian army supposed to do when receiving artillery fire ? 
  walk away ? 
  for all they know it might be the russians shelling them , on ukrainian territory where they have ** zero ** rights to be . 
  took a look at his recent posts , the influence of russian propaganda never ceases to amaze me . 
  last time i checked , raqqah was still the self proclaimed capital of the islamic state , and they controlled a significant part of the eufrates in syria as well as the bordering countryside . 
  i 'm very fond of the original idea , but not overly satisfied what it has evolved into . 
  that being said , i still support it enough to hope it survives . 
  i was n't referring to the assailants . 
  see the quotation in my post above , as the comment i replied on has been removed . 
  men , regardless of ethnicity was ported from one swimming hall on one day . 
  he 's trying to make it into a race issue . 
  the decision is fucking retarded , but it 's not what he 's making it out to be . 
   first native white swedes are told not to go to swimming pools what ? 
  we 're deporting like 50 % of the asylum applicants in 2015 , so there 's that . 
  there has also been somewhat of an `` awakening '' ( cringeworthy term to use in the context ) among centre right parties regarding immigration . 
  hell , even the current social democratic/green government are taking quite heavy measures against it , despite being very liberal and naive on the matter previously . 
   they are likely to manage to stay out of a conventional between russia and nato . 
  no , in case of a confrontation in the baltics , swedish territory would be of major importance for both nato and russia . 
  nato would need it in order to sustain operations in the baltics ( easier to access the baltics via sea and air than via land ) , the russians would need it in order to deny nato said option to support the baltics . 
  this is clearly stated in the recent rand study . 
  are we sure we should allow russia to dictate our foreign policy ? 
  our police force is horribly managed ( the individuals in charge are n't even police officers ) and undermanned ( officers from as far north as ume\u00e5 are deployed in malm\u00f6 for border controls to take an example ) . 
  they have to make the best with what they have , if they left , they most likely got another call deemed to be more urgent than acting as an escort for journalists . 
  there simply are n't enough officers to go by . 
  why 's he downvoted ? 
  avpixlat is fucking miles from being a local news service . 
  it 's a blog typ site entirely devoted to insanely biased articles about immigration , often balancing on the border between legitimate criticism and straight out racism . 
  russia 's soviet nostalgic actions are n't in the interest of europe , regardless of what rt tells you . 
  `` europe 's dirty jobs '' and the context in which you mentioned it comes of as you mean dirty jobs performed by russia in the interest of europe . 
  but yes , georgia and ukraine are both cases of russia initiating conflicts in europe in violation of international law . 
  define `` dirty jobs '' . 
  there are worse traits than being able to consume large quantities of alcohol !, 
  found it to be worth the watch , if you look past the unrealistic settings . 
  ca n't seem to get why it 's being labeled as propaganda etc , russia 's not the only part being portraid as a baddy in the show , the eu and us are n't portraid too kindly either . 
  to be fair , i 've yet to meet an irishman without an aptitude for drinking . 
  rf has dissolved since the documentary was filmed . 
  seems like all it took was some arrests and following prosecution of several prominent members . 
  if that was enough to shaken their resolve , one might wonder how the hell they intended to do their socialist revolution . 
  and russia respects ukrainian sovereignty . 
  it 's exactly like young labour . 
  this is a proposal from ** one ** district of a youth party , a party that compromises no more than 1600 members . 
  as of now , the proposal is more or less being ridiculed and is receiving it 's fair amount of criticism , from the right and left alike . 
  but sure , we 're fucked because some naive kids decided that they think it 's kosher to fuck your dead sister !,
