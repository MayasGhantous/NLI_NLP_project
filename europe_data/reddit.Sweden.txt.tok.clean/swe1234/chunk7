  go ask the baltic states if they think nato is a cold war relic . 
  anyone who bombs anyone risks bombing civilians , nature of the business . 
  not in iraq , but france had a pretty substantial presence in afghanistan . 
  the gign is the primary intervention unit of the gendarmerie , which is a branch of the military tasked with law enforcement tasks . 
  hard to compare them to any possible equivalents in germany given how you do n't have a gendarmerie . 
  the national counter terrorism/intervention unit of the national police would be the french equivalent to the gsg9 . 
  here it goes , someone without any inside knowledge about the case nor police work goes on to criticize the police for shooting an armed attacker and comments on training which he has no experience of nor any insight in . 
  as usual when the police shoots someone . 
  lots of `` they should have '' and other bullshit , easy thing for you to say when you 're sitting in your couch being all wise after the event . 
  a whole other story for the officers faced with an armed suspect running at them with an axe . 
  sweden , guy ran around a high school like [ this ] ( http://w.cdn-expressen.se/images/f8/2e/f82e3f39250344c2ae98e025f790baa4/16x9/760.jpg ) and stabbed students with immigrant backgrounds . 
  he was shot dead by police when going all banzai on them . 
  age checks are done now though . 
  and no , that 's a guy who was invited to his former school to participate in the run . 
  go read up on it . 
  it was misinterpreted . 
  he was n't participating as a 14 years old , he was invited to participate in the run at his former school to inspire students or something . 
  that 's a rather arrogant approach , do n't you think ? 
  you come of as someone with a massively grandiose self-image who thinks of him/herself as enlightened and free thinking whilst slandering any views which opposes yours as garbage . 
  it 's immature and i 'm starting to guess that you 're the one who 's brainwashed , given the blind trust in some kind of alternative truths and inability to accept different views . 
  by taking actions which resulted in harsh sanctions ( which he certainly knew would be a consequent of said actions ) , by denying the population basic democratic rights such as freedom of speech etc. 
  the list goes on . 
  he screwed the ethnic russians in his proxy republics over quite severely as well . 
  this is quality comedy . 
  someones opinions does n't align with your  ill informed brainwashed zombie . 
  do n't even bother , he 's all caught up in some grandiose self-image of himself as a `` free thinker '' , and that somehow led him to believe that the russian way 's the only way . 
  your standard lunatic pro-russian moron . 
  i 'll reluctantly respond , not to let the desinformation pass without question . 
   which the eu and the us brought upon them and which hurts the russian and eu economies and relations the most . 
  i 'd imagined it was implied * why * the sanctions were imposed in my previous post . 
  russia brought them upon itself by its actions in ukraine , if i need to clarify that . 
   in direct response ... and it 's written hypocrisy that 's a rather disproportionate response do n't you think ? 
  concerning the pretty huge size difference as well as announcing exercises prior to holding them . 
  and until russia went all soviet nostalgic and stronk , nato was entirely focused on counter insurgency half a world away . 
  the shift to a conventional focus started when russia initiated its massive military build up and forgot that they have zero rights to intervene by force in its neighbours internal affairs , unlike the good old days . 
  thanks for the grammar lesson though , appreciate it . 
   you can find so much truth in media like rt. 
  you should be thankful for an interpolar world . 
  in the interpolarity oyu find truth , do n't pick sides you damn fool !, 
  you 're callling me a fool for picking sides , while you 've been explicitly pro-russian and apologetic towards their actions from the very start . 
  checks out though , anyone with a world view that does n't align with your enlightened , free thinking one is a fool . 
   you are brainwashed and wrong . 
  that 's one way of responding to criticism . 
   god you are dangerously misinformed . 
  you are like a drone that simply repeats what it 's being told . 
  brainwashed zombie . 
  while you 're an enlightened free thinker who 've seen the truth , got it . 
   sanctions which they brought upon themselves  military encirclement sovereign states making their own decisions concerning their foreign and security politics , as is their right . 
   military exercises ( aggressions ) oh the hypocracy . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://gdb.rferl.org/771e2a58-cf5c-4970-922e-7d42ff3c9bfb.png ) a good overview of excersises held by nato and russia respectvily . 
  russia holding much larger , unannounced , exercises at the borders of nato member states certainly is n't provocative . 
   propaganda/media war against russia and fearmongering goes both ways . 
  and by looking at what russian state controlled media shits out , both for domestic and international receivers , in comparison to the equivalent in the west , any reasonable person would notice a much more aggressive tone , more lies , more fearmongering on the russian part . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1oq8tevqe https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr_a3o6ss_s  aggressive , dishonest and confrontative diplomacy if you behave like an asshole , you 'll be treated accordingly . 
   us missile defense shield along the russian border in europe if it was intended to counter russian nuclear warheads specifically , basing it in romania would n't be optimal . 
  funny that you mentioned fearmongoring , as far as i can tell your entire apologetic rant is a big load of fearmongoring . 
  and given the sheer amount of lies , cherrypicked half truths , twisted interpretations and hypocrisy expressed in the initial part of your post , further discussions seems rather unnecessary . 
   the west is the aggressor . 
  how ? 
  i 'm honestly curious . 
  correct , it was even caught on video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6v9hgr3hhg, 
   nato has very little to offer finland ( ** and ** ** sweden ** ) unless we want to build a defence similar to what we had during the cold war , nato is our only option . 
  spending roughly 2 % and having the security guarantees of article 5 is a cheeper alternative as well as a better deterrence . 
  our claimed non-alignment policy wo n't exclude us from a hypothetical conflict in the baltic sea region , it 'll only leave us weak and alone , plus we 're balls deep in nato already , but we lack a full membership , thus rendering us unable to affect the alliances decisions making and disqualifying access to intelligence , command structures etc. 
  two naval bases are more than one , and it does provide their air assets with a larger operational range without having to refuel , plus their naval aviation in the region is entirely based out of crimea . 
  there 's a pretty significant military presence there , and also on crimea in general after the annexation . 
  with the peninsula firmly under their control , they 're naturally going to exploit the strategic importance of it in the black sea region . 
  smells copycat, 
  whilst it would n't fly in estonia and latvia , due to eu and nato memberships , they 'd probably be able to muster a fair share of local support . 
  the russian minorities in said countries are pretty substantial . 
  partly , but i would argue that the cause of their actions are geopolitical/strategical . 
  crimea was sized to guarantee access to the naval base in sevastopol , and in the long run as a means of increasing the russian influence in the black sea region . 
  i 'd guess that the stalemate in eastern ukraine is deliberate , russia has essentially created a frozen conflict rendering ukraine unable to join the eu or nato for a foreseeable future , plus the self proclaimed soviet nostalgic fuck ups they call republics can be seen as a buffert zone . 
  much like in georgia . 
  the diversion this creates from domestic problems is a side benefit though . 
  you forgot to mention the jews and shapeshifting lizards . 
  the soviet union supported palestinian terrorism way earlier , if we 're to play the blame game . 
  in estonia , yes , but not in latvia . 
  this years baltops was conducted in early june though . 
  `` protecting russian minorities '' is merely an excuse and a cover , the reasons for their actions are geopolitical . 
  see crimea and `` novorossija '' ( or whatever the fuck they call it ) . 
  yes , only to enslave the eastern territory occupied by the germans themselves . 
  to me you seem more concerned about how the purchase would affect the european economy rather than what it would offer in terms of operational efficiency . 
  from a military perspective it would n't , it 's much less efficient in the role than the apache . 
  think about the personnel that will be operating the system , and the troops which will be supported by it . 
  i 'd much rather have an apache covering my ass than a tiger . 
  generally you do n't buy something just to benefit the economy , at least if the military gets to decide . 
  you buy what gives you the most bang for buck , and in this case it 's the apache . 
  sure they could 've bought the tiger , but they 'd get a helicopter much less efficient in the role it 's intended to fullfil . 
  or , god forbid , you could launch a joint development project ( see nh90 ) and be forced to wait for a decade and remain uncertain about the quality and efficiency of the product . 
  speaking from a military perspective , ** do n't ** base purchases of military equipment on civilian logic and what 's most beneficial for the overall economy , buy what 's best for the job and that comes with a reasonable price . 
  period . 
  he 's retired , so losing his job wo n't be a problem . 
  he should be worried about the internet mob instead . 
  participation in isaf was n't mandatory , it was a un mandated security operation led by nato . 
  whilst being capable of conducting those kinds of operations , it 's not a outlined aim of the organization nor is participation in any kinds of operations outside the obligations of article 5 mandatory . 
  the core purpose of nato remains defensive , and no obligations within the organization goes beyond actual defence . 
  you 're oversimplifying it . 
  a general term to describe individuals associated with a left wing ideology ? 
  it 's not rocket science .
