of course , this is a sub with mostly european citizens . 
  obviously a military conflict on european soil will be considered worse for the people who live in europe . 
  it 's not that weird . 
  amen . 
  i 'm still too hungover to see the difference . 
  [ yes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbh3uaz4wum&amp;feature=kp ) , and we 're all pretty hungover today . 
  just as american democrats hijacked the term ` liberal ' . 
  giving up and abandoning parts of the eu is not giving up europe . 
  eu does not equal europe . 
  over my cold dead body . 
  in your previous comment you said this :  what i mean is that there is nothing socialist about the ps . 
  they are purely capitalist , just in favour of a bit more government influence on some issues . 
  you might want to look up want the word capitalist means as well ... 
   also , i would add that in most european countries , lots of essential consumables are vat free never heard of this , which countries ? 
  what does that have to do with it ? 
  they had their [ press conference ] ( http://junilistan.se/2014/02/17/pressmeddelande-junilistan-siktar-p ) less than a month ago and the campaigns have n't really started yet so i do n't blame you . 
  however , they have been noticed in mainstream media at least [ a couple of times ] ( http://www.svd.se/search.do?q=junilistan ) . 
  we also have the june list party making a comeback in the eu elections this year . 
  that [ commercial ] ( http://vimeo.com/57445812 ) almost convinced me that norway is worth protecting . 
  / r/civpolitics /, 
  they 're a lot of things , `` heaps of junk '' is n't one . 
   we still do n't know how many weapons there are . 
  he has licences for 557 , and we suspect he has at least that many , but we 're not sure yet . 
  they 're not sure yet . 
  i 'd guess it 's like / u/igeloktten says , that it comes down to non-approved storage of the weapons and maybe also the grenades . . 
  the swedish krona was the 11th most traded currency during 2013 so there 's no problem in exchanging really . 
  and we 're happy with it , there 's no solid public support for the euro whatsoever . 
  over my cold dead body . 
  just kidding , but no . 
  it wo n't happen . 
  i regret to inform you that there 's no such thing as a `` european citizenship '' . 
  there is however an idea of a so called `` eu citizenship '' which is something you automatically become when you have acquired citizenship in a nation that belongs to the eu . 
  it 's not the united states of europe . 
  malta is an independent democratic nation , as is all other countries that have joined the eu . 
  i 'm sorry to hear that as it 's this kind of ideas that fuel euro skepticism . 
  effectively reducing national democracy and the power of the voter . 
  well , this is as stated by the page of the so called `` eu citizenship '' idea :  it is for each eu country to lay down the conditions for the acquisition and loss of nationality of that country . 
  and by the way , regarding `` eu citizenship '' , have you even read the treaty on the functioning of the european union ? 
  it 's not that much of a big deal . 
  i ca n't really see the downside of this type of immigration whereas there are downsides ( and upsides of course ) to other types of immigration . 
  that 's a pretty twisted view on democracy and the right for malta to choose what 's best for themselves . 
  edit : also from eu 's own page on `` eu citizenship '' :  it is for each eu country to lay down the conditions for the acquisition and loss of nationality of that country . 
  [ doom and gloom ] ( http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/doom+and+gloom ), 
  so you consider yourself in a position to determine how an independent and internationally recognized state should issue their citizenships ? 
  should n't malta independently get to decide who becomes a citizen of their country ? 
  not sure why you 're down voted , feel the exact same way . 
  actually i do n't think i 've ever met anyone that 's 30 + and still live with their parents , sounds sad to be honest . 
  me , i moved to my own place before i turned 18 , best decision of my life . 
  i was there last week , i ca n't give you a count but there are a lot of people at the site . 
  by ukrainian constitution ( third chapter , article 72 ) they should be able to hold referendums as long as they collect 100 000 signatures , do you know if this has been done ? 
  would they be approved with the rate of corruption they have anyway ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  i was actually at the demonstration site last week , it was ( thankfully ) very calm at the time but it was very interesting to see . 
  it 's like a small city within the barricaded perimeter . 
  not sure if the demonstrations are the best solution , yanukovych was still elected democratically . 
  just get rid of him in the elections 2015 . 
  haha , there 's probably some backstory to it . 
  not that i 'm aware of though !, 
  yes , this is a very extreme case but it does make the point fairly well . 
  they would most certainly not call the police , even though we do not greet each other in that way here , 
  it 's real . 
  [ this ] ( http://prussiluska.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/glad-kvinna-i-norberg.jpg )  this thursday around 13 o'clock a women was out walking in the neighborhood of norbergs camping . 
  she met another woman who was out jogging . 
    the jogger looked happy , laughed and greeted the woman as stated by the police report . 
  since the woman did n't know the jogger she felt molested and reported the incident . 
  no , i know . 
  and it 's too bad . 
  converting the fee to a tax might happen in a couple of years though . 
  here both the left and the right supports it more or less , even though the right seems to a bit more in favor of converting the fee to a tax . 
  i think a tax is the right way to go , given that public service is significantly shrunk down to one tv and one radio channel and only programmes that are public service and not entertainment . 
  how about we force everyone that owns a mailbox to pay a `` mail box fee '' which funds a government printed newspaper and then we call that free press . 
  does n't sound like free press to me ? 
  we have more or less the same system with public service consisting of 6 different tv channels ( svt1 , svt2 , svt24 , children 's channel , education channel and svt world ) and four radio channels . 
  the fee of 2 076 sek ( $ 230 ) is mandatory if you own a tv , radio , computer , smartphone , tablet or an internet connection . 
  basically anything with a screen or radio receiver . 
  for me personally , i do n't even have a tv and i do n't own my computer , phone or tablet ( the company i work for owns it ) . 
  however , i have any internet connection at home and because of that i have to pay for 6 tv channels and 4 radio channels which i do n't consume at all . 
  it 's a deeply flawed system with public service that has turned into something way bigger than serving the public , i ca n't understand how anyone would support this , even less the danes who has an even more outrageous fee . 
  the difference is n't at all that big but you 're right , it 's slightly more expensive . 
  however , most of these companies have started in the last two to three years as the demand has been increasing a lot , mostly due to mobile data . 
  markets do n't change overnight but prices are going down , without government intervention . 
  the only reason roaming charges remain is that they provide revenue which is much needed for the expansion of 3g and lte networks , rates change constantly to be competitive as you probably know . 
  what will happen when you cut this revenue and still demand improvements in infrastructure is that subsidizes will have to put in place , so instead of paying the charges which are going down you 'll pay it through your tax statement . 
  in the latter case which you seem to promote there 's also the overhead of bureaucracy , of course . 
   if it moves , tax it . 
  if it keeps moving , regulate it . 
  and if it stops moving , subsidize it .

  you do n't need enforced planned economy like rates , the market is solving this rather well . 
  it 's not black or white . 
  the choice is n't between super high tax society and no society at all . 
  you think income tax is all tax we pay ? 
  the total tax paid by citizens when you start from the amount that the employer designates for the wage is around 70 % for mid-low incomes . 
  that 's theft . 
  there 's no solidarity whatsoever involved in the massive theft commited by our socialist democratic states . 
  60.1 b $ for cap . 
  almost half of the 135.5 b $ . 
  screw that . 
  i would n't label russia as an enemy because that 's outright wrong .
