i can totally understand how my comment could be interpreted to read as such . 
  vista probably * is * slowing down my laptop , but i have n't noticed because i do n't really have anything to compare it to . 
  [ vista 's all i 've ever known , man . 
  * it 's all i 've ever known . 
  i 'm not * that * computer savvy , but something tells me windows 8 wo n't fix my `` a drive in a raid 0 volume is failing '' issue ( not to mention the broken usb ports or the glitching graphics cards ( which have already been replaced three times ) ) . 
  * fascist * jew islamist lgbt * q * nazi cia , please . 
  running vista on a 5 year old laptop here as well . 
  it 's dying a slow and painful death though , so i 'm desperate for an upgrade . 
  same here .

  might be the [ hallands\u00e5s tunnel ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hallands%c3%a5s_tunnel ) . 
  construction began in 1992 with a planned opening date of 1995 . 
  cue groundwater ingress , rock that was softer than expected ( resulting in the drill breaking down after 18 meters ( 59 ft ) when it was supposed to drill 100 meters ( 330 ft ) per week ) , and a poisonous sealing compound which leaked into the environment and killed local cattle , fish and made workers ill . by 1997 the project , which was still going on , was halted . 
  construction resumed in 2005 with a projected completion date of 2012 , which was later revised to 2015 . tl ; dr - tunnel construction project that was supposed to take three years and cost about sek 1 billion actually took 23 years and is estimated to cost more than sek 10.5 billion ( and also poisoned the environment ) . 
  [ seems like it . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regasification ), 
  i 'm only speculating here , but since at full capacity the terminal can cover the demand of almost the entire baltic region , `` minimum operations '' might refer to the needs of lithuania and only lithuania . 
  if russia suddenly decides to cut off the gas supply to the region , then lithuania will have to somehow source more lng to help cover latvia and estonia as well . 
  from the article :  norway 's statoil asa ( stl ) has a contract to supply the terminal with lng for five years to cover its minimum operations with the first delivery scheduled tomorrow . 
  it 's not simply a tanker but an off-shore liquefied natural-gas vessel/terminal . 
  it converts lng into natural gas and pumps it to the mainland . 
  if running at full-capacity ( 4 billion cubic meters ) , it could cover 80 percent of demand of the entire baltic region , including latvia and estonia . 
  disclaimer : i know nothing about this kind of thing except for what i 've read [ here ] ( http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-10-27/lithuania-grabs-lng-in-effort-to-curb-russian-dominance ) . 
  from the article in [ this post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2kg2cc/lithuania_grabs_lng_in_effort_to_curb_russian/ ) :  after less than three years and spending of 350 million litai ( $ 128 million ) , an off-shore liquefied natural-gas vessel is anchoring on the former soviet republic baltic coast today and will convert lng into natural gas and pump the commodity to the mainland . 
   the aim is to free the country from its dependence on russia 's oao gazprom ( ogzd ) , the world 's largest gas supplier and the sole source for lithuania . 
  years before the ukraine conflict renewed fears of another winter gas shutoff from russia , lithuania requisitioned the independence , a south korean-made ship the length of three football fields . 
  it is docking in the port of klaipeda and may replace all russia 's annual 2.7 billion cubic meters of gas supplies . 
  i do n't drink coffee and i have never had anyone bother me about it . 
  the most common reaction i get is `` oh , you do n't drink coffee ? 
  would you like some tea instead ? '' . 
  2 is the worst , though . 
  sometimes american relatives come to visit us and in one case they walked all over the house in their shoes while we gave them the tour of the place . 
  my american mother did n't seem to mind but i was having an apoplexy in the background the entire time . 
  that paragraph makes me feel all tingly inside . 
  ** sweden ** - the russians are coming !, 
  yeah , there seems to be a lot of different variations ( targeting women ; jumping onto people 's backs ; sucking people 's life force ; sinking people into the ground ; finding peace through receiving a name ... ) . 
  the only constant seems to be that they 're the ghosts of abandoned , unbaptized infants . 
  there 's also the [ myling ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/myling ) ( from the old swedish word * myr\u00f0a * ( myrding ) , meaning `` to murder '' ) . 
  they are the ghosts/spirits of unbaptized children left to die in the woods or other remote places , forced to haunt that place and roam the earth until they can find rest , either in hallowed ground or by receiving a name from a passerby . 
  they would chase lone wanderers at night and jump on their backs , demanding to be carried to a graveyard , and would grow heavier as they neared the hallowed ground ( gradually sucking the life force out of their victims , to the point where any person carrying one ( or more ) would sink into the soil ) . 
  if their victim should prove unable to make it into the cemetery , the myling would kill it in rage . 
  edit : also , [ storsj\u00f6odjuret ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/storsj%c3%b6odjuret ) ; sweden 's only lake monster , first reported in 1635 . 
  it is described as a serpentine or aquatic reptile with fins across its back and the head of a dog , and supposedly measures approximately six meters long with ( as some accounts describe it ) several humps . 
  yup . 
  [ here 's a real one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cnomubqenu ) with bengt magnusson , may he live forever !, 
  seeing as norway has a fish on their new 200 kroner bill , i 'm not gon na complain . 
  never forget . 
  i 'm swedish/american , but born and raised in sweden . 
  some days i 'll feel more swedish than american ( and vice versa ) , but i do n't ever feel 100 % of either ; i 'm both , in varying degrees , depending on the situation/context . 
  my american grandparents did an amazing job of sending me educational books and tapes during my childhood , so i think i have a stronger connection to my american heritage than i would 've had had i only been exposed to swedish media . 
  since i 'm bored , here are the songs that have spent the longest time on sweden 's [ svensktoppen ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/svensktoppen ) , a weekly record chart that has been on the air since 1962 ( until 2003 the songs had to be in swedish to qualify , and the chart was thus dominated by [ dansband ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dansband ) ) : 1 .

  [ i 'm partial to the uddevalla bridge myself . 
  there 's a picture of the candlestick [ here ] ( http://www.dn.se/sthlm/krogare-far-sparken-for-rasistisk-dessert/ ) , in the original article . 
  i 'll second those and add : 2004 [ s\u00e5 som i himmelen ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0382330/ ) 2003 [ psalmer fr\u00e5n k\u00f6ket / salmer fra kj\u00f8kkenet ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0323872/ ) ( swedish/norwegian collaboration , so i guess it kind of counts ? ), 
  that 's it . 
  thanks . 
  i was drawing a blank and was too lazy to fire up google . 
  every kommun is divided into geographical districts ( munkedal has seven ) , along with one `` collection district '' ( a fictitious district ) in which all the `` late '' advance votes are gathered . 
  when the votes from the collection district are registered and you begin to add the ones from the geographical districts it can result in a temporary voter turnout of over 100 % until all geographical districts have been registered . 
  according to the article a way to avoid this is to do it the other way around ( register the geographical districts first and * then * add the collection district ) . 
  i ca n't make much sense of it at this time of the night , but that 's pretty much the gist of the article . 
  the true voter turnout for munkedal is at this moment ( with one district left to register ) [ just under 82 % . 
  it 's a temporary error due to all districts not having been counted yet . 
  it 's happened in a couple of other kommuner . 
  [ here are some notes i took for class last year . 
  that might be helpful . 
  hopefully someone more knowledgeable than me will be able to shed some light on this . 
  while looking for the lyrics i actually found other versions of the song , in swedish as well as norwegian and danish , that had the line `` sovjetski soldatski '' in them . 
  there seems to be a lot of variants floating around , and people call it everything from a children 's ditty to a lullaby to a `` rysk k\u00e4rleksvisa / russian love ditty '' . 
  i do n't really know if it 's a scandinavian thing or an actual russian song ( i 'm leaning towards the former ) . 
  the scout song book i linked was the only source i could find that was n't a blog/message board post . 
  i found the lyrics [ here ] ( http://www.ssf.scout.se/upload/folkunga/scoutkarer/hanekind/storasangbokena4.pdf ) in one scout troop 's song book :  # 18 . 
   ah ah hej  ah ah ah hej hej have n't been able to find any audio , though . 
  according to svt , this year the viewership ranged from 2,740,000 ( the `` second chance '' episode ) to 3,405,000 ( first semi finale ) , meaning that at its worst melodifestivalen still managed to snag 28 % of the population , with its best being 35 % . 
  just about the same number ( 3,364,000 people ) watched the eurovision finale . 
  there 's even [ an entire wikipedia page dedicated to the issue ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gender_differences_in_suicide ) . 
  because who needs cannabis when there 's fika ? 
  also , there is no bikini team . 
  whoa , a whole army ? 
  we 're talking defense against russia here , not galactic domination . 
   potatoes . 
  just like the previous one , i probably ate potatoes at least five times every week . 
  like my grandfather used to say : `` if i did n't have potatoes for dinner , i did n't have dinner . '', 
  so ... as a former swede , now sealander , where do i sign up for the pro-baltica separatist movement ? 
  ^ ^ ^ sealandsj\u00e4vlar ... 
  dammit / u/axtolip , i 'm an engineer , not a linguist !, 
  bah , semantics !,
