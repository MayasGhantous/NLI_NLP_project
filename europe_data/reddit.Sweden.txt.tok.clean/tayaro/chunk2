  i pronounce b\u00e1r\u00f0arbunga as `` bungabunga '' in my head every single time , no fail . 
  source : the police and all major news outlets . 
  apparently the protestors threw ammonia filled balloons at the police , especially targeting the ones on horses . 
  all sources say that they were `` especially targeting '' the mounted police . 
  also , they usually wear some kind of armor if things are expected to get violent , such as plastic eye shields , leg armor and nose guards . 
  most of the news sources do n't mention * how * it was done , but i found one source stating that the rioters filled balloons with ammonia , which they then threw at the police . 
  edit : the police are now saying that the ammonia was in plastic and glass bottles . 
  i do n't know much about it either , to be honest . 
  but i figure that police horses are chosen for their temperament and are trained to keep their cool in situations like these , kind of like seeing eye dogs . 
  i 'm not really sure . 
  i guess horses are more effective when it comes to dispersing crowds , since protesters are more likely to throw themselves in the path of vans or cars than they are a pack of galloping horses . 
  when you throw ammonia at the mounted police i feel like being trampled by horses is a suitable punishment . 
  according to [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lagom#etymology ) :  ** the origin of the term is an archaic dative plural form of lag ( `` law '' ) , in this case referring not necessarily to judicial law but common sense law . 
  ** a translation of this could be `` according to common sense '' . 
  ** a popular folk etymology claims that it is a contraction of `` laget om '' ( `` around the team '' ) , a phrase used in viking times to specify how much mead one should drink from the horn as it was passed around in order for everyone to receive a fair share . 
  ** this story is recounted widely , including on the website of the swedish institute . 
   parallels can be drawn from `` lagom '' to the law of jante , which in short says that a group member should not think they are better than anyone else , which indicates that `` lagom '' could mean `` the appropriate amount , according to the law of jante '' , for example , the phrase `` take lagom with sugar '' would mean `` do not take more sugar than one should '' . 
   but that 's so long ago that we do n't really hold the danes directly responsible anymore . . hey , speak for yourself !, 
  `` lagom '' is n't average . 
  it 's something that 's not too much or too little ; something that 's just right . 
  `` lagom \u00e4r b\u00e4st '' would translate into `` it 's best not to have too much or too little , but just the right amount '' . 
  would n't that technically violate the geneva protocol ? 
  that is the exact reason i spend 90 % of my time on reddit , in the safety of my own home . 
  do n't i know it !, 
  yes , i am an active christian . 
  christianity is definitely not dead in sweden , though we 're not very numerous nowadays . 
  no , i 'm christian . 
  religion first , and then nationality . 
  according to the swedish wikipedia entry for the milky way , the name `` winter street '' probably comes from the old thought that one could foretell the coming winter weather by studying the bright band of stars in the center of the milky way , which can sometimes be seen in the sky during dark and clear nights . 
  ... alrighty then . 
  that 's some impressive eisegesis you 've got going on there . 
  oh , please . 
  go on then , explain what sd * really * mean by `` vigorous efforts against crime , more support to crime victims '' . 
  the sweden democrats could launch a campaign proclaiming the sky to be blue and some people would still get offended and try their best to have it banned . 
  in swedish `` by '' is village . 
  city or town would be `` stad '' . 
  the decision to build a plant in ringhals was the result of a * long * process , including * years * of investigation , during which the government scouted many , many locations , until they finally came across the one site on our west coast where the conditions were * just right * ( taking into account the tides and atmospheric circulation , etc. ), 
  that , if the plant ever experienced a meltdown , it would hopefully take out a chunk of denmark as well . 
  or at least provide them with a good deal of nuclear fallout . 
  thanks for the correction . 
  i have indeed * not * been enjoying it . 
  the heat must 've gotten to me . 
  it 's been kind of hard to tell lately , with the temperatures we 've been enjoying !, 
  wrong country . 
  they hate our * v\u00e4lf\u00e4rd * . 
  you too !, 
  b\u00e4stkusten has certainly delivered so far !, 
  i 'd rather not be too specific , but it 's on one of the larger islands . 
  [ visiting my parents at the moment . 
  archipelago off the west coast of sweden , with the mainland visible in the distance . 
  well , we obviously ca n't do that now that you 've brought it up . 
  it 'd be too awkward . 
  thanks , jerk . 
  three norwegians are walking through the forest during winter . 
  suddenly they come across tracks in the snow . 
  `` i think they 're moose tracks , '' the first norwegian says . 
  `` i think they 're bear tracks , '' the second norwegian says . 
  the third norwegian is just about to speak when the train hits him . 
  also , avoid eye contact . 
  in fact , do n't even look at anyone , period . 
   a sweden democrat politician lied about his crime history . 
  i thought the swedish democrats confirmed that his past convictions ( from the early '90s ) had been known to them since the 2006 election ? 
  can confirm . 
  currently enjoying my breakfast on the deck in the sun , watching the sea . 
  if anyone has any rain to spare feel free to send it our way . 
  it 's getting a bit dry out here . 
  i always preferred * [ s.o.s ( the tiger took my family ) ] ( http://youtu.be/ftqgpqjkefo ) * , myself . 
  but let 's not forget dr. bombay 's relatives ; his scottish cousin dr. macdoo ( who reached number 4 on the swedish charts with * [ under the kilt ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggajfthcq1c ) * ) , and his lesser known mexican cousin [ carlito ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klyjhot0riu ) . 
  seriously . 
  this thread 's giving me nostalgia flashes and * i like it * . 
  in sixth grade my school arranged a class trip from sweden to denmark , and we must have played this song on repeat for most of the journey . 
  looking back , i 'm amazed the bus driver did n't kill us all . 
  wow , when they say `` green '' they 're not kidding !, 
  always the bridesmaid , never the bride ... 
  it truly is a beautiful process . 
  i read it as `` moon base '' and wondered how i 'd managed to miss such a historical event . 
  from what i can gather ( from reading [ the wikipedia page ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/denmark_in_world_war_ii ) ( someone correct me if i get anything wrong ) ) : denmark was occupied by germany during d-day and their navy was under german control , except for thirteen vessels that had managed to escape to swedish waters ( by 1944 they were considered a danish naval flotilla in exile ) . 
  while the danish resistance movement did manage to sabotage the danish rail network on d-day , delaying the arrival of german reinforcements to normandy , it seems that the only danes who actually took some part in the d-day landings were civilian fishermen . 
  from the article :  for the first time ever , denmark has been officially invited to take part in the anniversary of the landing of allied forces on the beaches of normandy during the second world war . 
    ** the ceremony , which will be held on june 6 , officially recognises the 800 danish sailors who took part in the d-day invasion 70 years ago during operation overlord . 
  **   `` there has long been doubt whether the danes were on the side of the allies or were a puppet of nazi germany , '' jens ege , the head of the veteran association danske veteraner 1940-45 , told tv2 news . 
    ** `` but the navy men and the resistance movement ensured at the last minute that denmark would be recognised as an ally . '' **, 
  shh ... give him time . 
  it 'd be kind of a crime to talk about swedish music and not bring up [ dansband ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dansband ) :  dansband ( `` dance band '' ) is a swedish term for a band that plays dansbandsmusik ( `` dance band music '' ) . 
  dansbandsmusik is often danced to in pairs . 
  jitterbug and foxtrot music are often included in this category . 
  the music is primarily inspired by swing , schlager , country , jazz , and rock . 
  the main influence for rock-oriented bands is the rock music of the 1950s and 1960s . 
  examples : * [ * eloise * - arvingarna ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vltgzvzs32s ) * [ * oh julie * - lasse stefanz ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wi0modwdxlg ) * [ * tv\u00e5 m\u00f6rka \u00f6gon * - sven-ingvars ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sk4prvqc7py ), 
  one of our national treasures . 
  i love this . 
  what really gets me is about 2:30 min into the video when , after spending a lot of time talking about finding the stone and having the runes translated and carved into the surface , he suddenly chokes up and says `` i 'm born in ' 33 , so i 'm 81 years old , so this will be ... 
  this will be the last thing i do , before ... 
  there wo n't be anything about me [ written on ] this stone , just ... '' and then he looks away from the camera , but you know he 's not upset about not leaving a physical , lasting mark behind , because the stone tells the story of his late wife , and all he really wants is for his love for her to be remembered , and now it will because as one of his final acts he made sure of it . 
  i find that beautiful . 
  that just ai n't healthy . 
  the sooner you accept the fact that life is just so much better on this side of the border , the sooner you can begin the healing process . 
  what else is there to do out there ? 
  75 % match for the party i 'm intending to vote for , and 63 % for the party that 's my second choice , with all the other parties at around 40 % . 
  seems about right .
