  may you be judged as harshly as you deserve . 
   our second in line for the throne has armed himself .

  i 'm surprised a patriot such as yourself would forget about hrh princess estelle . 
  you had * one job * , norway !, 
  one job !, 
  i think you mean the golden girls . 
  that is ... utterly * fantastic * . 
  you forgot the most important headline of the week : * minister of finance anders borg gets a haircut . 
  norwegian says something like `` should not be covered '' while the swedish is along the lines of `` covering will produce a fire hazard '' . 
  ... i am so sorry . 
  because * yikes * . 
  yeah , that one 's actually pretty nice . 
  that 's quite a downgrade . 
  this reminds me of a couple of years ago when they redid the logotype for gothenburg/g \u00f6teborg . 
  the ad agency spent a year working on it and ended up charging close to a million kronor just to come up with [ this ] ( http://event.goteborg.com/logotyper/gbg_office.png ) .

  if someone was to show me a picture of that boy and ask me what nationality he was , i 'd guess southern european .

  he might be blond and blue eyed , but his features do n't look even remotely swedish . 
  it 's not because i 'm afraid , it 's because i * hate * it when people drop by unexpectedly . 
  oh , you did n't bother calling ahead to hear if it was alright to visit ?

  going by the username , my guess would be sweden .

  they polled 26,5 % in a survey released yesterday , making them the largest party in sweden . 
  in the last election ( which took place almost exactly a year ago ) they got 12,86 % .

   `` do you want this new law that would require you to buy new expensive automobile in the future ? '', 
  but all the cars were already left-hand drive , so that did n't play into the result of the referendum . 
  the only vehicles that were right-hand drive and had to be replaced/updated were trams and buses that had the door on the wrong side . 
  cars in sweden have always been left-hand drive though , which meant that prior to the switch everyone was driving lhd cars on the left side of the road , making maneuvers such as overtaking very dangerous . 
  first thought : 1 694 400 vs 40 000 is kind of overkill . 
  no wonder they won . 
   this survey places sd at 25 % when all other institutes places them at 15 % . 
  what are you talking about ?

  in sweden they use the suspect 's age and sex . 
  `` the 34 year old man ... '' , `` the twenty year old woman ... '' . 
  how dare you . 
   the picture of an elephant is very misleading . 
  i thought it was pretty obvious . 
  when i think `` elephant '' the first word that pops into my head is usually `` snabel '' ( `` elephant 's trunk '' ) . 
   alfakrull i do n't think i 've ever heard that one . 
  yes . 
  they were mother and son , from northern sweden but in v\u00e4ster\u00e5s to visit family . 
  two legends from where i grew up in the archipelago off sweden 's west coast : the first is that in the late 1500s , when the spanish armada sailed to invade england , one or several of the ships were lost in the ensuing north atlantic storms . 
  they drifted aimlessly until they found themselves in [ the skagerrak ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/skagerrak ) and the ships were destroyed on the rocks when they ran aground the islands off the swedish coast . 
  the spaniards , unable to communicate with the locals and unable to get back to spain , ended up marrying local girls and integrating with the local population , and this is the reason why so many of the people on that region are still of much darker complexion ( skin , hair , eyes ) than the average swede . 
  the second one concerns a ship that was wrecked upon the skerries off h\u00e4r\u00f6n island on the night of december 13 , 1717 , in a storm documented as one of the worst of its time . 
  the ship -- * jungfru elisabet * , which had set off from hamburg , destined for stockholm -- had been carrying household utensils and other precious cargo belonging to frederick of hesse , who was married to princess ulrika eleonora ( the youngest child of king charles xi ) , including a small cradle of gold which had been intended as a votive offering for the princess , a gift from a german princely house , and which was covered in precious gems and considered very valuable . 
  now , here 's where the legend comes in : when the next morning dawned the * jungfru elisabet * was in pieces , its crew was gone , and , much to the joy of the local islanders , the cove in r\u00e4bbehuvud was filled with flotsam . 
  the locals stole whatever valuables they could from the wreckage of the ship , including a cane with a golden knob which they used to buy the silence of the parish provost , mikael kock . 
  according to oral tradition , years later kock , a riksdagsman ( member of parliament ) , traveled to stockholm on a parliamentary visit . 
  wanting to appear refined he brought the cane with the golden knob with him , but had the bad luck of running into frederick of hesse while visiting parliament . 
  frederick , who by this time had become king frederick i of sweden , immediately recognized the cane in kock 's possession and grabbed it , unscrewed the golden knob , and , to kock 's surprise , revealed a roll of gold coins that had been hidden inside . 
  kock was arrested , and a large troop of soldiers was sent to tj\u00f6rn to find the golden cradle . 
  however , the farmer who had found the cradle was forewarned of the search party and buried the cradle in one of his fields , and after some time spent searching the king 's soldiers had to return to the capital empty handed . 
  years later , on his deathbed , the farmer confessed to the parish priest the location of the buried cradle , but once the priest had left the farmer suddenly felt better and had a change of heart ; summoning the last of his strength he got up , unearthed the cradle , and moved it to another hiding place . 
  soon thereafter he died and took with him the secret of the cradle 's location . 
  to this day many believe that somewhere on tj\u00f6rn , in a field , under a few feet of dirt , there lies a golden cradle covered in gems , just waiting to be discovered . 
  whoops , my brain added `` gift '' to the `` wedding '' in your original post . 
  weird choice for a wedding gift as well as a wedding . 
  that 's because it was n't :  peskov told the business newspaper rbc that the watch was a wedding gift from his wife , tatiana navka , and that he received it on saturday , the day of the wedding . 
   [ ... ]  there was just one wrinkle . 
  why , opposition bloggers asked , was peskov wearing the same watch more than 15 weeks ago in a photograph posted by his daughter yelizaveta on instagram ?

  podgari\u0107 ( # 4 ) is my favorite . 
  it looks really alien and imposing . 
  i kinda like it . 
  it 's like they 're straight out of some gritty , post-apocalyptic sci-fi movie . 
  police have confirmed that one of the men killed held a senior position in one of the local gangs . 
  they 're not releasing any details about the cause of the explosion , but there 's a lot of speculation that it could be gang related -- either a planted explosive device , or explosives that were being transported in the car and accidentally detonated .
