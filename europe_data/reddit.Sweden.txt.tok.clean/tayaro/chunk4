  - three adults and a four years old girl were killed when their car exploded , also in gothenburg . 
  - popular tv show host , actor , and comedian magnus h\u00e4renstam died at age 73 after a long battle with cancer . 
  he 's known , amongst other things , for hosting the swedish version of * jeopardy * for 14 years , and also the classic '70s kids ' show * fem myror \u00e4r fler \u00e4n fyra elefanter * ( * five ants are more than four elephants * ) . 
  i was looking for sweden in the 0-25 % category . 
  55 % is double what i thought it 'd be . 
  but ... but ... :( / half american,

  [ you 'd be surprised ... ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ukblm5w.jpg ), 
  before people get all excited because it 's starred in the title , `` elf '' is an old spelling of '' \u00e4lv '' , meaning `` river '' . 
  \u00c4lvdalen translates to river valley , while the swedish word for elf is alv ( or alf ) . 
  elfdalian / \u00c4lvdalska is not the language of the elves ( or short , hairy , cat eating aliens ) . 
  [ anyway , here 's a clip of a lady reading a swedish text in \u00c4lvdalska .

  ah , there we go . 
  thanks !,

  well , they ca n't run aground every time . 
  because we obviously need more ways to confuse sweden with switzerland . 
  the swedish dialect i grew up around ( and ended up speaking a lite version of ) actually does n't have the sj-sound , so i pronounce both stj\u00e4rna and k\u00e4rna as `` k\u00e4rna '' . 
  it 's a conscious effort to remember to do a proper sj-sound whenever i speak . 
  british english , that is . 
  the short version of \u00c5 represents [ ipa / \u0254 / ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/open-mid_back_rounded_vowel ) . 
  the long version of \u00c5 represents [ ipa / o\u02d0 / ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/close-mid_back_rounded_vowel ) . 
  can confirm : my mother 's been living in sweden for 40 + years now ( and has been speaking the language for just as long ) , and she still has n't gotten the hang of it . 
  [ and this is what it sounds like \\ ( 0:25 \\ ) .

  well , it 's not like it 's an option to ship them off to another country . 
  though if it were , i 'd be fine with it . 
  my complaint is n't the cost , but that our prisons are far too nice for this kind of person . 
  ah , but the gnat has a lifespan of a mere seven days . 
  how much less so in the gastrointestinal tract of a mighty bear ?!, 
  the mighty bear will endure , and soon the lone gnat will no longer be a nuisance . 
  also , you assume that the mighty bear does not wear pants to shield it from the troublesome gnat . 
  such an assumption will be your downfall . 
  it 's very flattering . 
  by the time you 've weaned yourself off drink and rallied your forces i will have already conquered the land . 
  you will be no more threat to me than a lone gnat would be to a mighty bear . 
  hold that sigh of relief , my friend !, 
  i 've never had a drop of alcohol in my life , and now that i know a life of mass murder and conflict is inevitable , you 're first on my list . 
  ( quick and dirty cleanup of google translation ) : ** the police are no longer able to do their job . 
  a strong contributing factor : the criminal young men in and around stockholm central station that occupy great resources from an already strained police corps . 
  ** the question is sensitive , but the problem with the young moroccan men dwelling in the center of stockholm is not unfamiliar . 
  only yesterday reports surfaced that morocco is in political discussions with interior minister anders ygeman and that the whole thing is a `` common concern '' and that they `` must find ways to identify these people . '', 
  estimates claim that hundreds of young men from morocco and other countries in north africa are in sweden right now . 
  and the group is a problem for the police and other authorities . 
  ** they steal stuff everywhere ** svt nyheter have been in contact with a police officer who wants to remain anonymous but who , among other things , has worked with groups of young men moving in and around stockholm city . 
  `` these guys are a huge problem for us . 
  they steal stuff everywhere and abuse the stewards at the central . 
  they grab girls between the legs and slap them in the face when they object . 
  all police officers know of this , '' he says . 
  on a direct question concerning the working situation of police officers in stockholm the answer comes quickly : it is disastrous . 
  `` i would never let my children go to the central station . 
  no police officer would , '' he says . 
  the problem and the frustration concerning the situation is being discussed extensively . 
  bj\u00f6rn cewenhielm , the commanding manager ( ? ), 
  for alma , stockholm region , explains . 
  `` you bring in the same guys over and over again and then they are released again , and it 's a never ending cycle . 
  it is not rare that a guy is back out on the street before the police who arrested him is , or so i 've heard . 
  and that is of course extremely frustrating for the police officer in question . 
  we the police sincerely welcome cooperation from morocco , '' he said . 
  svt nyheter has spoken to several police officers who work with young people in stockholm . 
  `` this is the only thing we 're working on and has been for a year . 
  as investigators we know who are involved and that you ca n't obtain any identification on them , '' says one of the policemen . 
  ** this is of course taking up a lot of resources ** that the young people take up a great amount of resources from the police , resources that would otherwise have gone towards preventing other juvenile crimes , is readily admitted . 
  `` this is of course taking up a lot of resources from preventing regular juvenile crimes such as theft and drugs . 
  so it is a problem . 
  but we have a clear order of priority now that it 's 2016 and the migration issues are number four on that list , and that is high up . 
  what tops it is , among other things , serious crimes and emergency alarms . 
  we must work with this , '' says bj\u00f6rn cewenhielm . 
  svt nyheter has previously reported on how the swedish authorities are at a loss as to how to deal with groups of unaccompanied minors from morocco . 
  many do not even accept the help offered during the asylum process . 
  instead they run away from the children 's homes they are placed in and live off crime . 
  ** `` i know that what is done is not right '' ** the policeman who svt nyheter talked to describes how , to `` keep your head above the water '' , the police have started to solve the problem `` in another way '' . 
  an air of resignation is clear throughout the conversation . 
  several of the policeman 's colleagues have already resigned . 
  `` we book them for public disorder instead , or lob ( law regarding disposal of the intoxicated ) . 
  then , at least , there 's some kind of punishment ; eight hours in a cell , '' he says . 
  * do they really have to resort to such measures ? 
  * `` i know that what is done is not right , but i see no other way . 
  they should not be out messing with other people . 
  i think the best thing would be if someone at the swedish police authority was questioned on the issue and had to answer . 
  but then we will have even more to do . 
  we 're on our knees now , '' he says . 
  the managers do not recognize that description . 
  `` i really hope that this is not happening . 
  lob is a law used to help people , and a person must be a danger to themselves or others for it to be applied . 
  the situation varies from case to case and it 's up to each police officer to assess the situation and how intoxicated the person is or if they 're intoxicated at all , but it can not be applied this way - no matter how frustrated you are , '' says bj\u00f6rn cewenhielm . 
  * will police officers working the central station get tired and resign or go on sick leave ? 
  * `` there always a risk . 
  there are such tendencies in all tough situations and of course it 's frustrating for them . '', 
  * sometimes these guys are transported to other cities as a solution . 
  how does that system work ? 
  * `` you can place them in foster homes , for example in other cities , but children are n't locked up , which results in them returning to stockholm quite quickly again . '', 
   assar , hallgerd , torbj\u00f6rn , alf , astrid , viv/viva and tyr , for example , are rare today [ according to scb ] ( http://www.scb.se/sv_/hitta-statistik/statistik-efter-amne/befolkning/amnesovergripande-statistik/namnstatistik/30898/30905/samtliga-folkbokforda--fornamn-och-tilltalsnamn-topplistor/31042/ ) astrid placed # 78 in the top 100 names for women in december 2014 ( up from # 79 in 2013 ) . 
  i would n't say torbj\u00f6rn is that rare either , compared to the other ones you 've mentioned . 
  fairly common , i 'd say . 
  not in the top 100 , but definitely not an unusual name . 
  probably that since they were drinking alcohol , they were n't true muslims . 
  the / s was implied .
