  fucking breitbart is doing a story where they pay a journalist $ 2000 to spend a day in malm\u00f6 , we fucking laughed at that in sweden but what people in other countries who do n't know about malm\u00f6 respond to that is completely different . 
  what the us is doing could be described as anti-swedish propaganda and they are being a terrible ally to us . 
  but about the same as st louis . 
  crime is steadily decreasing in malm\u00f6 , [ see chart below in this ] ( http://www.sydsvenskan.se/2016-04-16/rekordfa-brott-anmals-i-malmo ), 
  swedish politics right now is what i could only explain as a clusterfuck . 
  in this case it was to the right . 
  sd are social conserveratives , so economically they are fairly left wing . 
  ukip called them `` too extreme '' btw . 
  i 'm well familiar with this . 
  how would anyone know ? 
  there has n't been a penalty yet . 
  you 've had plenty of opportunities to remove it but they 've been voted down . 
  neither do i but i would n't suggest we should ban expression that is considered ineffective . 
  beliefs and ideas should never be respected , they should be challenged . 
  several european countries still have blasphemy laws . 
  oh no did you touch it ? 
  the effect is not instant . 
  i thought they were super popular everywhere . 
  when i was a kid my sister said you died if you touched one . 
  feels to me that the first finding is the biggest part . 
  you 're right that 's exactly how it is , the two loudest sides are both opposite extremes . 
  swedish media has never refrained from reporting violence in the suburbs as far as i know , but the reporting is rather shallow . 
  i do n't think many swedes know much about life in the immigrant suburbs of those who have n't lived there . 
  we try to not touch those * too * much , but yeah true hydro powers a lot of the country . 
  catch up finland, 
  seems to me like he was joking just like you and it was you who took is all seriously . 
  what are you getting at about british food then ? 
  british food definitely has its bright spots like hearty roasts , pies and cheeses and much else , it 's just that reddit is probably one of the most insular places you can go to when it comes to food . 
  it 's funny that you think the reason europeans hate british food is because they like pineapple pizza , a fucking american invention , it 's almost as bad as your other invention broccolli pizza . 
  do n't judge a cuisine based on their take on a dish from another cuisine though , that 's just fucking stupid . 
  who would out ketchup on pizza ? 
  on hot dogs its fine . 
  i eat porridge with milk and lingonberry jam , it 's the best way . 
  hot dog if anything but i do n't eat at matches . 
  i think it 's underrated . 
  oh you 've missed a lot then . 
  big if true, 
  oh i thought this was office only . 
  sweden yeah ? 
  what a cozy place . 
  lol we do n't have windows . 
  living in ireland i can agree for the most part . 
  how efficient . 
  i never said i thought it would happen . 
  probably not but if that 's the case i 'd rather live in a society where people are naive and trust each other than one where people are paranoid and do n't trust each other . 
  same situation with me . 
  / swede living in ireland, 
  i guess communist thinking is still in them . 
  if i ca n't do well noone else should either . 
  supporting free speech does n't mean you defend everything it covers . 
  but not all hate speech does , that 's why i believe hate speech laws should be removed and certain cases can be covered by the law against incitement of violence . 
  yeah it 's complicated . 
  let 's not forget that ~ 100,000 hungarian jews had swedish safety passports which saved them in the war but would have been invalid if sweden was in war with germany . 
  what would have been the best outcome ? 
  you 'd know, 
  i like `` the anglo-celtic isles '' . 
  really why ? 
  my favourite church . 
  exactly , when was any country great ? 
  you 're misunderstanding me , i think america is great today and i think many other countries are aswell . 
  if someone said `` make sweden great again '' i would feel the same , * if sweden is n't great now when was it great ? 
  certainly a great achievement , but it 's still hard to pinpoint the time when it was great . 
  obviously you have to judge a country based on the state of the world at the time and the time period itself . 
  i mean if someone says make america great again it makes me wonder if america is n't great now , when was it ? 
  america actually has [ entire towns run by religious law ] ( https://i.imgur.com/b1yekqv.jpg ) closest you can come to sharia law . 
  what do you mean national team ? 
  hard to get a good view on the middle pitches . 
  not really, 
  that 's deluded, 
  well let 's not go too far , women leading ? 
  beautiful !, 
  i bought explorer vodka more often , cheaper . 
  why would she be queen when we have king carl xvi gustaf to have as king of europe ?!, 
  ridiculous . 
  i do n't think that 's it . 
  if finland is anything like sweden they mostly drink black coffee but drink milk to meals often and consume a lot of dairy products . 
  we 're the mcpoyles of europe !, 
  i guess you hang out with people like yourself . 
  i have the complete opposite experience . 
  ok what would you pick ? 
  is it a fiasco if it 's lead to a museum generating loads of money for decades now ? 
  very relevant username, 
  you mean the one in [ filipstad ? 
  must be boring to have no interest in history . 
  it 's the best preserved 17th century warship in the world . 
  if you have the slightest interest in history this museum is absolutley incredible . 
  oh no wish i was there . 
  i think they have a miniature model of their airport at the airport aswell , have you seen that ? 
  for sweden i would put [ visby ] ( https://x.cdn-expressen.se/images/6b/4a/6b4ac878edde4335b9ca4e68efbb8bf4/4x3/original.jpg ) , medieval town , cute little streets , roses everywhere and a wall around . 
  germans with schadenfreude . 
  i have a thing for miniature things . 
  i want to go to miniatur wonderland . 
  what a fucking cretin, 
  does this mean ireland is 4 times as efficient as bulgaria ? 
  very finnish post, 
  i did n't know we used to have an orbital ring in the 1600s . 
  we do love dill but only the isterband and r\u00e4kmacka has it here . 
  [ palt ( dumplings ) ] ( https://www.norrmejerier.se/bilder/user/stor/54004a70-255f-4cd4-9cc6-c1f00a8c8571.jpg ) yum !,
