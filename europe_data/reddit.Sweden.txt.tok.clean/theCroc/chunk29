  when they are hanging out with like minded assholes however they open the floodgates on this behavior . 
  that 's why we fairly normal men do n't realize how often this happens , because we never see or hear about it . 
  any random woman you ask on the street however will tell you it happens several times per week ever since they were 14-15 or whenever they first started growing boobs . 
  definitely . 
  it is a common phenomenon that when someone is brought from being a part of a majority culture to suddenly being a minority they tend to cling harder to their culture and be more extreme about it . 
  several generations later swedish descendants in america are still celebrating midsummer and such more hardcore than the swedes themselves . 
  likewise a comparatively moderate muslim family can easilly become more extreme in their interpretation of their culture because they are afraid of losing it etc. 
  i think his point it that a culture cant be put in a classroom and taught manners . 
  it cant be locked up in jail for being bad . 
  only individuals can . 
  so instead of `` blaming '' the culture , which is unproductive and leads to no change , we should look at the factors we can affect and start there . 
  and no locking out an entire culture because a minority is misbehaving is not a viable solution . 
  then no one at all would be able to live in the country . 
  well the effect is twofold . 
  it proves that the air defense is very vunerable . 
  as you say it could have been an armed drone or a spy plane . 
  this is why two generals got fired immediately after . 
  the teddy bear is a symbol of dissent in belarus . 
  people who are not allowed to protest have staged fake gatherings with just teddy bears posed as if protesting the government . 
  dropping teddy bears on the capital is not just a silly prank to the government . 
  instead they see it as part of that same dissent and fear that it will bolster the dissenters within the country . 
  so what should just be a formal complaint about compromised airspace is seen as an attack on the government itself . 
  according to the edda he was blown off course by a storm . 
  after he realized that he was way off he turned around and found greenland . 
  later they sailed a proper expedition and created a settlement that only lasted like 15 years . 
  on the other hand columbus accidentally stumbled over land in his attempt to reach india . 
  well i think that part is implied . 
  maybe you can ask romney . 
  i 'm sure he has one of those sitting around that he does n't want . 
  discovery is not universal . 
  every discovery is from the perspective of the discoverer and the people he/she communicates with . 
  yes the natives discovered the land path over the bering strait a long time ago and yes leif ericsson discovered noth america about 1000 years ago and yes columbus accidenntaly discovered america in 1492 . 
  each discovered it for their people . 
  it 's just that by columbus time we were interconnected enough in the world that the discovery spread to more or less everyone within the next 100 years . 
  that 's why he gets the credit . 
  he discovered it for western european culture . 
  i 'm sure the asians had probably landed there once or twice as well . 
  but we were the ones to go out and make a big deal about it . 
  basically he screwed up royaly but got lucky and ran into land where no one expected it . 
  the argument can be made that he discovered it for scandinavia but we did n't really pass on the news to the rest of europe . 
  so they had to discover it for themselves . 
  well discovery is always a matter of perspective . 
  europe discovered america whereas the natives already lived there , having themselves discovered it far earlier . 
  the fact that they discovered it earlier does n't take away from the fact that europe discovered it later . 
  just like leif ericssons discovery of america does n't take away from columbus accidental discovery 400 years later . 
  the very word discovery means finding something that was already there . 
  we have to channel all that excess viking aggression somewhere . 
  otherwise we 'd be back to the same old story about southern europe whining about `` raiding parties '' . 
  if they did n't want to get raided they 'd buy more metal albums . 
  please point me towards the debt free haven in which you reside . 
  decapitated eagles ** on an american flag ** the details are important . 
  a lot of those are actually griffins . 
  in sweden it is pretty much `` the other gay festival '', 
  also the 30 year war seems to be missing, 
  yes . 
  first rule of political success : avoid comparing yourself to nazis . 
  but it 's just so cheap !, 
  that 's because we provide them with cheap temporary labour . 
  we 're norways mexico . 
  ** g\u00f6teborg ** is a 35 year old industry worker . 
  he is pretty well off and has advanced to linemanager . 
  in his position he is well paid and well liked and has contact with lots of different people and places . 
  however he does n't give much for staying in style or keeping up with the trends . 
  instead he prefers to spend his money on good old entertainment like sports events , going to the pub etc. 
  he does n't recognize class and is perfectly willing to talk shit about his snobby wannabe art-director cousin in the northeast . 
  ** malm\u00f6 ** is a 20 something woman that is well on her wait to moving up a few socioeconomic levels as soon as she can get her older and more established cousins to take her seriously . 
  she had a period of unemployment and still has trouble keeping her home life in order but is at the same time much hungrier and more active in chasing the opportunities . 
  ever the underdog she leans a lot on her old and jovial friend copenhagen for support . 
  exactly ( except for the ron paul part ) . 
  that is why gdp is a crap measurement . 
  one of the fastest ways to grow some sweet gdp is to outlaw something everyone does and then borrow money to pay for special taskforces to fight said thing and put lots of people in prison . 
  another way is to borrow tons of money and spend it all on the military . 
  also a lot of money is spent on lobbying , representation , hotels , banqets , security , administration etc. 
  gdp is not a measurement of actual production but rather of money turnover . 
  also crammed full of corpulent old men with heart diseases collecting lobbyist money . 
  what does that even mean in relation to my comment ? 
  it seems like you left out the whole context of that thought . 
  a country with an aging population only has too many immigrants if they marginalize the ones that come in . 
  if instead they are empowered and able to contribute and allowed to become part of society they go from being yet another problem to being the solution to the aging problem . 
  a lot of far right groups form out of anger and resentment . 
  they seldom have the same ideas for how to solve their problems . 
  this causes infighting . 
  it does n't help that a lot of them are deeply nationalistic as well since they 'd have to cooperate accross borders . 
  notice that all three are nations that europe invaded or colonized at one point or another and neither of the three have ever attacked europe other than through low price exports . 
  ok once again , no one is saying that all children must have halal . 
  i 'm just saying halal should be an option just like vegetarian is in most schools . 
  no one would be focred to eat it . 
  they would be able to grab some bacon if they so wish . 
  however they should be given the option to follow their most deeply held belief when it 's something as harmless as a dietary code . 
  it would be different if they demanded that the girls should be taught separately from boys or that girls should n't recieve the same education etc. 
  that stuff is actually harmful to the child . 
  halal meat is n't . 
  also worth noting is that the muslims in france are n't actually demanding this . 
  this whole article is based on a fantasy scenario pitched by sarcozy et al. 
  to scare narrowminded rightwinger into voting for them . 
  what a load of tripe . 
  no one is saying all children should eat halal . 
  they simply want the option to eat it themselves . 
  just like there are options today for vegetarians or children with allergies . 
  the rest i will not even comment on .
