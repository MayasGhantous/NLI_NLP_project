yes . 
  and fuck off man . 
  i live in stockholm and this did n't change shit . 
  we know it was a random madman . 
  swedes are not stupid . 
  i walked there today . 
  my cousin walked there 20 min before the truck . 
  brainwashed and brainless . 
  fox, 
  the massive downvote . 
  they 're just presenting the real facts . 
  that law is there to prevent segregation . 
  it has nothing to do with muslims . 
  grouping immigrants in areas is bad for integration . 
  i like this sub . 
  ignorance , be gone !, 
  or somalia is n't as bad as you think . 
  or the us is n't as good as you think . 
  make a pick . 
  edit ... 
  looked at it . 
  you really ca n't read statistics . 
  wow . 
  [ alibaba ] ( http://www.alibaba.com ) would get a lot of work . 
  but honestly , europe can manage with china instead . 
  my swedish passport is the most precious thing i have , beside my life . 
   sweden is n't perfect [ erhm !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z13qnzuqwui ), 
  i 've been there . 
  many times . 
  it 's no different from 10 years ago unless you deal drugs and shoot people . 
  most people do n't do that . 
  was there this weekend for beers and fun . 
  yeah ... i 've heard the swedish school is n't that great anymore . 
  but wow , were the worst in scandinavia . 
  big brother is falling behind . 
  a lot of people blame the private schools but i think it has to do with how the public school is run . 
  it used to be controlled on state level but now it 's every region on its own . 
  i think . 
  other swedes know this better than me ... 
  thats my point . 
  the end is positive and the world is a better place, 
  you know why they need it . 
  but it 's not as simple as you think . 
  and it wo n't ruin sweden, 
  well , you know , sweden is a country . 
  of course we send them money when they need it . 
  i 'm more focused on the end than the war . 
  the long peace . 
  im not ignorant to what 's happening . 
  there 's a lot happening in sweden now . 
  but we 're not getting destroyed by it . 
  people are exaggerating the consequences . 
  i 've already explained the white flight thing with a single link to scb . 
  but people do n't care . 
  sure , there 's a lot of swedes moving out . 
  but there 's a lot of swedes moving back too . 
  and where do you thing they `` flee '' too ? 
  norway . 
  for work ... 
  hen just dont like that i told the truth . 
  you 're in russia man !, 
  do n't even talk, 
  im not gon na read further than the first sentence . 
  ethnic swedes ... wtf is that ... i 'm part german . 
  what am i ? 
  im in malm\u00f6 eating kebab right now . 
  its just as chill as 10 years ago . 
  dont be a retard, 
  you dont know me man . 
  i 've lived in suburbs and cities . 
  people move . 
  and right now i live in stockholm . 
  but my dad lives in a small town . 
  they say they 're the most unsafe village in the region . 
  but no . 
  they have the least crimes in the region . 
  people tend to believe things that are n't true, 
  we dont have no-go zones . 
  3rd link, 
  no we do n't . 
  we 're not stupid . 
  i know what it means . 
  what i meant was . 
  why does it matter ? 
  most people understand that, 
  and i love it . 
  this thread turned out better than i thought . 
  i 'll keep checking in through the night !, 
  we talk . 
  i hope my german relatives feel like you, 
  yes !, 
  the best bubbel, 
  finally !, 
  i 've been waiting for this comment . 
  the fact that it took this long is ridiculous . 
  we have over 500 comments and the sources are right there . 
  i have not .
