oh , please . 
  he 's doing no such thing . 
  he 's merely explaining ( some of ) the underlying causes of the attacks . 
  if you want to prevent these kinds of attacks in the future then you have to know what you 're dealing with . 
  she was never going down there to join isis . 
  her boyfriend allegedly was going to syria to join al-qaeda and she went with him , but they were both `` arrested '' by isis in aleppo . 
  isis and aq are bitter rivals in the me , something people often fail to understand when they lump islamic fundamentalists together . 
  it 's a very tragic story . 
  i feel disgusted by certain people in this thread that are gleeful about it . 
  ** it 's a pregnant 15 year old girl ** , for fucks sake - yeah , joining up with al-qaeda is a pretty stupid thing to do , but have some compassion . 
  if a pregnant child getting thrown into the living hell that is isis ** is your idea of justice ** - well , maybe * you 're * the monster . 
  that was close to 300 years ago , how is this relevant in any way ? 
  nowhere in the article did it say that just eat was from sweden . 
  maybe you misunderstood this sentence , it 's pretty clumsily written :  [ ... ] the uk is home to more unicorns than sweden -- including zoopla , just eat and wonga [ ... ] and i do n't think it 's particularly wrong to call spotify a swedish company . 
  it was founded by swedes with money from swedish venture capital firms and their hqs are in london and stockholm . 
  not that i do n't agree with you , but you 're glossing over centuries of european migration to the americas . 
  europeans back then were fleeing europe because they were starving , and today africans are fleeing africa for the same reason + conflicts . 
  thank god foreign policy informed me of these dire news , lest i would have stayed in this literal shithole . 
  i had no idea my beloved country went ahead and died while i was looking . 
  how could i not notice such an obvious thing , that there 's nothing left in this country anymore ? 
  how could i have been so naive ? 
  it seems i have been deluding myself these past few years . 
  i 'm now packing everything i have ( misery , poverty , social unrest ) and moving to better horizons . 
  i do n't think there 's an easy answer . 
  if i 'm allowed to speculate i would argue that it 's mainly due to a gap in the expectations that people have on boys and girls . 
  girls are generally more pressured to perform in school than boys are . 
  this is a huge disservice to boys . 
  and the old adage `` boys will be boys '' can be pretty pervasive and damaging ( boys * are * more rowdy by nature , but that should n't preclude them from getting a good education ) . 
  this holds true for many countries . 
  as to why the gap is particularly large in sweden ? 
  i think it 's because of a lack of political will due to perceived historical injustices done to women . 
  girls are doing really well in an area historically dominated by boys and that sounds good in media . 
  it 's a very worrying trend , though . 
  women are studying more and more ( which is a good thing !, 
  ) , but the men lag behind . 
  add to that the fact that men are * much more * likely than women to stay in the * avfolkningsbygder * where they grew up ( towns currently undergoing depopulation due to disappearing industry ) and we have a growing societal problem of unemployed men living in areas with a lack of women . 
  not a pretty sight . 
  however , in the end it 's not the teacher 's faults . 
  the students , both girls and boys , are a reflection of society . 
  if society encourages girls to do well in school more so than they encourage boys , then the gap in the education comes naturally . 
  as is tradition . 
  i know nothing of art , but i quite like [ wassily kandinsky ] ( http://uploads1.wikiart.org/images/wassily-kandinsky/study-for-circles-on-black-1921.jpg ) 's abstract pieces . 
  normally i dislike abstract art but something about his paintings is really intriguing . 
  [ gustav klimt ] ( http://uploads1.wikiart.org/images/gustav-klimt/cartoon-for-the-frieze-of-the-villa-stoclet-in-brussels-fulfillment-1909.jpg ) is nice too , i guess . 
  but my favorite has to be ** odilon redon ** . 
  he created such dark and weird paintings . 
  here 's a [ painting of christ ] ( http://uploads7.wikiart.org/images/odilon-redon/christ.jpg ) , [ the apparition ] ( http://uploads6.wikiart.org/images/odilon-redon/the-apparition.jpg ) , [ caliban on a branch ] ( http://uploads7.wikiart.org/images/odilon-redon/caliban-on-a-branch-1881.jpg ) , [ lenore ] ( http://uploads7.wikiart.org/images/odilon-redon/lenore.jpg ) , [ the crying spider ] ( http://uploads5.wikiart.org/images/odilon-redon/the-crying-spider-1881.jpg ) , [ spirit of the forest ] ( http://uploads8.wikiart.org/images/odilon-redon/spirit-of-the-forest-1890.jpg ) . 
  every other artist but redon seems boring to me , in comparison . 
   the further claim in the title that this makes native english speakers `` the world 's worst communicators '' is deliberately inflammatory and insulting . 
  apparently we now have to pick sides on language barriers . 
  i found it to be a bit tongue-in-cheek . 
  native english speakers are `` the world 's worst communicators '' only because english is the only true global language . 
  hence there 's no competition . 
   oh i was wrong then , for some reason i was under the impression that you guys have to pay a small fee for the information . 
  is it possible to look up information without the person you are checking knowing you did it ? 
  i have no idea if we do , sorry !, 
  i have n't seen those kinds of lists in a few years , so maybe they 've already implemented fees or something else . 
  the court system uses fees if you want to see court documents these days . 
  i think it used to be free , but because it was abused through a website ( lexbase.se ) , they introduced fees . 
  it costs 8 euros per document . 
  it 's the same in sweden . 
  i absolutely hate how some newspapers are creating localized lists of how much rich people earned the last year . 
  it 's disgusting . 
  i still support that the data is public . 
  i say this as someone who barely earned any money at all in the last years ( for personal reasons ) . 
  i would n't get my name in any newspapers , but i would hate if people knew about my meager means - especially since i 'm poor due to my own decisions and not to any external factors . 
  but maybe they should introduce some kind of small/medium fee per tax record . 
  this would enable journalists to do investigatory work on politicians , royalty , powerful business people et al. 
  yet prevent so-called newspapers to create lists of thousands of people to publish . 
  whataboutism is maybe the most pathetic defense you can make . 
  you 're not credible . 
  usually ambassadors and others with diplomatic immunity are declared persona non grata , and is told to leave . 
  sweden , several : * everybody is asocial and quiet * sweden is a socialist paradise * sweden is becoming a caliphate * everybody is blonde , hurrdurr * not a stereotype , but ikea * `` rape capital of the world '' ( people should stfu about issues they do n't understand ), 
  the world * as a whole * is getting better , no question about that ( and that makes me happy ) , but in europe * in particular * i feel as though things have been getting worse . 
  mainly economically - some countries have n't even rebounded from the crash of 2008 , ** eight years on ** !, 
  and so many low - to mid-level jobs have been lost to automation or globalization . 
  and then we have all these terrorist attacks claiming lives on a scale not seen for however many years . 
  no , europe is n't doing that good . 
  lovely people in the comments section ( in wps article ) . 
  *  poles , do not be intimidated by those who would like to control your country for their own benefit . 
  continue the reformation of their country . 
  take an example of hungarians !, 
  *  the polish people voted their leftist government out as have spain , italy , hungry , norway , et al. 
  the same thing with britain on a de facto basis with brexit . 
  now the jew bankers are schatting their panties due to the billions they will lose in fees for servicing the british eu conversion fees & other business . 
  *  obama needs to shut his leftist pie hole regarding eastern europe 's politics ... they are one of the few areas of the globe that `` gets it '' , having lived under leftist totalitarian regimes they know what a damaging political institution it really is . 
  paid kremlin trolls or just idiots ? 
  hard to distinguish . 
  great article , thanks for sharing . 
  yep , it 's true and it 's not just facebook - telia ( sweden 's largest mobile carrier ) also does n't charge customers for data when they use twitter , whatsapp , instagram , and a few other services . 
  i first heard about it when they ran commercials on tv . 
  i thought it was a joke first . 
  particularly troubling is that the swedish government is the largest stockholder in the company . 
  i do n't even know what to say , it 's just fucking awful . 
  it 's a national disgrace and even more so that we 'll seemingly have to rely on the eu for net neutrality . 
  it 's embarrassing . 
  what are these , settlements for ants ? 
  jokes aside , very cool pictures , especially the miniature models . 
  i think physical 3d models do a better job of conveying how people lived in ages gone than computer models or sketches . 
  erdogan 's really grasping for straws .
