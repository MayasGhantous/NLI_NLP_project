well by existing as a male i 'm already oppressing females so i guess it 's just a matter of time . 
  well the agreements are often about more than just minimum wage . 
  so for instance an employee can get no paid overtime ( paid overtime is usually a part of the agreements ) and instead get a higher base wage and more vacation . 
  the agreements are seldom only about minimum wage , a lot more things are included like amount of vacation etc. 
  kind of , but nothing forces a company to participate in those agreements . 
  most big companies do , but many opt out , in some cases it can benefit both the employees and the company . 
  so in practice it is very hard to employ people for less than what the unions and industries have collectively agreed too , but it is possible . 
  0 in sweden , so a lot of percentages higher than here . . 
  not voting does not mean you do n't mind the current policies . 
  for me it 's a boycott against an immoral system . 
  so either you are in serious risk of famine or you are receiving american aid ? 
  seems unbiased . . 
  as a swede i 'd have to go with this too . 
  up until pretty recently german parents scared their children to bed with the line `` go to sleep or the swede will come and get you ! '', 
  we entered the war on the pretense of helping protestants and carved out an empire in germany . 
  while not only a result of swedens actions it is estimated that 20-40 % of the population in germany perished during the war . 
  with swedish armies reportedly destroying roughly a third of all towns in germany . 
  i 'd argue that it is indeed healthier . 
  snus does n't cause chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , lung cancer , etc. 
  ( of course it is responsible for other ills , but i 'd argue that it 's not as bad ) . 
  also there 's no 2nd hand exposure . 
  of course . 
  your first sentence just made it sound like you considered them equal . 
  there 's a big difference between smoking and snusing though . 
  [ tell me about it . . ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/15a4j2/what_is_currently_the_biggest_public_debate_in/c7kqqsf ), 
  it would be `` det '' ( or `` den '' but never mind that . . ) in swedish . 
  it cant really be used when talking about people , it would be very derogatory . 
  i think `` hen '' is best illustrated like this : he = han she = hon `` hen '' is a combination of the two . 
  sometimes people will write `` h * n '' when they want to emphasize that the person mentioned can be of either gender ( since only the middle letter differ ) . 
  i think it would be equivalent to writing '' ( s ) he '' in english ? 
  some people would argue that `` hen '' should be used instead only in those kinds of cases . 
  a few extreme ones wants to replace `` han '' and `` hon '' with only `` hen '' . 
  it is my belief ( but i have no data to back this up ) that most swedes do not care or find the debate too silly to care . 
  but then i am biased towards that point of view . 
   you 're a racist if you think the reason that our boring strip of woodland is decently wealthy is anything other than the fact that we 've always had lots of wood , ore and shitloads of guns . 
  seriously ? 
  i mean i know you were on a rant and all , but that does not even begin to explain why europe ( and sweden ) is wealthy at the moment ( of course neither does our genes ) . 
  from sweden : * random stuff about the new nationalist party ( sd ) in the parliament . 
  mostly resulting in the debate about immigration getting pushed further up the agenda . 
  * the use or non-use of `` hen '' , a gender neutral pronoun . 
  * the weather, 
  i was going to say this too . 
  i dont know about vienna but in sweden oxfords are pretty formal for a university , it would work fine but most people will have sneakers like those you posted . 
  part of it is pay , sure . 
  but i would guess that part of it is that a military career does n't really seem viable for most people . 
  there is also little to no prestige in being a member of the armed forces of sweden as compared to other countries , which does n't help . 
   the renegotiated sum was 8 billion short of military 's request apparently . 
  yes , and no . 
  it was the military 's * absolute minimum * request that was 8 billion more . 
  so basically they decided to critically under finance the military for the next five years and then told the world that sweden is enacting a major defense budget increase . 
  one part is that we 've spent a lot of money in order to send soldiers to afghanistan rather than to defend sweden . 
  another part is explained in this blog post : https://translate.google.se/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fcornucopia.cornubot.se%2f2015%2f03%2fforsvarsmaktens-utforsaljningar-av.html&amp;edit-text= i 'm not sure how well google translate works for that blog post but i 'm too tired to translate it for you , sorry . 
  and i 'm sure there are a few things more that i am unaware of . 
  would the eu and the us really declare war against russia and risk nuclear war if russia invaded and occupied the whole country before nato had time to react ? 
  far easier to let it slide and give a stern warning to russia not to do it again . 
  i do n't know , no-one can , unless we have alliances . 
  which we do n't . 
  so we do n't know , and since we do n't know : do we want to gamble everything on russia not attacking even though they basically just have to drive to stockholm ? 
  while it is an increase from previous years , it 's not really an increase if you consider the circumstances , let me explain . 
  when the soviet union collapsed we scrapped a lot of our military . 
  the thinking was that we had a window of about 10 years to rebuild and modernize the armed forces before we 'd face a real threat again . 
  but after the army pretty much was disbanded no politician wanted to waste money on a military , so instead of giving the armed forces the funds they needed to modernize they got close to nothing . 
  so now when we increase the budget by 10 billion sek it seems like a lot but considering that we need at least 40 billion sek in the same time frame in order to finance the reforms that was planned it 's not really an increase , but rather a small step towards normal funding . 
  with 40 billion sek extra we would be able to defend sweden against russia for about a week , which is already laughable , but with just 10 billion we wont get anywhere near that . 
  sweden has double the population of any other nordic country and our army is probably the weakest . 
  it 's a fucking disgrace . 
  im thinking of the 2008 financial crisis . 
  which probably still puts icelands 2014 numbers lower than they would have been before the crisis . 
  i 'm just speculating though . 
  well , they did have a major economic downturn so the big change might be more of a recovery than `` new '' growth . 
  how does that fine even work ? 
  i mean by what authority can the international cycling union issue a fine . 
  i guess she signed something when she entered the competition that allows them to fine her . 
  i wonder if it 'd be legally binding if she took it to court . 
  no , this is a nonsense report . 
  it will be dismissed , but the media and the equality ombudsman is too pc to say so directly . 
  that would be insensitive . 
  this has already been answered here : https://m.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/40dc1w/swedish_police_covered_up_abuse_at_festival/cytf9zr, 
  every big newspaper has it on their first page . 
  my guess is it will be featured on tv tomorrow and the international press will probably pick up the story as well . 
  yes , see my comment [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/40dc1w/swedish_police_covered_up_abuse_at_festival/cytd973 ) . 
  not much to be honest , it is similar to the uk from what i understand . 
  we have the state funded television , svt , and the state funded radio , sr. 
  they are supposed to be unbiased , but are often criticized ( i wo n't go into details here though , because that will spawn a new debate ) . 
  they are also supposed to be operated independently from the state . 
  so the prime minister ca n't directly influence what they do or do n't do . 
  but from my understanding the heads of the organisations are appointed by politicians ( i 'm not 100 % sure that this is the case though ) . 
  other than that the state also gives financial aid to newspapers around the country based on their number of readers in order to help them operate . 
  but i 've never seen any reports of this being used in order to try and control the media in any way . 
  so in short all newspapers are private but a few tv and radio channels are state funded . 
  most articles i have read describe them as mostly ( or only ) non-swedes . 
  the sources vary but the police report that dn cites states that they were migrants . 
  i think that this is just svt being careful . 
  i honestly do n't know . 
  i would guess that they want to appear as really good people on facebook . 
  the kind of people who are progressive and care about the plight of the poor in the world , etc. 
  never mind if the policies actually work or not . 
  as long as you appear to be doing good they get likes on facebook and that 's all that really matters . 
  or maybe i 'm just too cynical . 
  hah , i like it .
