for now it is . 
  the social democrats have spent the last eight years bashing the ruling right wing coalition . 
  they would lose huge amounts of prestige and credibility if they suggested such a thing right now . 
  but if it comes to reelection , who knows ? 
  if the fringe parties ( sweden democrats and feminist initiativ ) grow in a reelection at the expense of the other small parties , a centre coalition might make more sense to the big parties . 
  because , to be fair and as many swedish pundits have argued , they are not very far apart on many issues . 
  not really . 
  the sub used to be very left leaning when i started using reddit 2 years ago . 
  since then there has been a shift and quite a few immigration/immigrant-critical websites are being linked in on a daily basis . 
  but the language and attitute is generally not overtly rascist and hateful as it is in i&i on flashback . 
  if i want to make someone laugh i just exaggerate my [ accent ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5l4wt_xo88&amp;list=pl424504e7f650c732&amp;index=3 ) a little bit and it 's practically a joke in itself . 
  ** sweden ** 6th of june was national day in sweden . 
  newspaper articles and opinon pieces celebrating/berating the national state galore . 
  train strike . 
  the union seko are taking their members to strike against the train operator veolia over temporary employment contracts . 
  most notably , the trains over the \u00d6resund bridge is affected by this . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.svd.se/naringsliv/sydsvensk-tagstrejk-nu-ett-faktum_3618130.svd ) the princess madeleine is baptizing her first born daughter . 
  porn for royalists . 
  h\u00e5kan hellstr\u00f6m sets new audience record for the stadium ullevi in his hometown gothenburg with 69 349 people beating bruce springsteens old record . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.svd.se/kultur/rekord-nar-69-349-sag-hakan-pa-ullevi_3638174.svd ) the hosts of the extremely popular radio talk show series `` sommar '' were announced . 
  the concept is to give some famous person an hour to talk freely about whatever they want . 
  [ link ] ( http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=95&amp;artikel=5879742 ) aaaand a lot of other stuff . 
  this is mostly weekend things i guess because my memory is poor :(, 
  you mean the lakes ? 
  i did n't say we would save money by joining nato . 
  i said we would save them by being allied with finland . 
  besides 1,2 is obviously too little since we do not have a working defence force . 
  we do love sweden , but they 're our rivals in sports finland is our rivals in hockey , denmark in football and norway in cross country skiing . 
  ideally yes , but there is no support in sweden for it . 
  this would be a reasonable compromise that could find support with the voters . 
  this is good . 
  i find it somewhat unnerving that we are non-allied and have an army in complete disarray . 
  there is little chance of us joining nato also since it has little support with the population . 
  i find it quite wasteful that we should both try and maintain our own complete and independent forces . 
  if we focused on different responsibilities we would probably save some money . 
  in a finland-sweden alliance , finland could focus on holding the eastern border and sweden could focus on defending gotland and keeping a powerful air force . 
  i do n't think i 've ever seen a consumer product made in russia . 
  hear hear, 
  not even slightly offended, 
  swedes get the pride flag ? 
  why i 'm i not surprised ? 
  songs from the movies and tv-series based on the books by astrid lindgren . 
  lyrics by astrid and music by georg riedel . 
  you will be hard pressed to find any swede who does n't know of songs like [ idas sommarvisa ] ( http://open.spotify.com/track/2lo43epq8yaawuszrksmom ) , [ h\u00e4r kommer pippi l\u00e5ngstrump ] ( http://open.spotify.com/track/7dnifrxmbpyzbi8hbett0e ) and [ du k\u00e4re lille snickerbo ] ( http://open.spotify.com/track/13xkaf7sfcvg4ixmfkniwr ) . 
  the shows are from the 60s , 70s and 80s but are still popular with kids today . 
  maybe people who are looking to preserve ethnic purity should move to these depopulating areas themselves and make an actual contribution . 
  just skip all the consonants, 
  surely the british police would n't misuse such powers if it was given to them ... 
  we can set up a refugee camp for you in lapland . 
  ... said most people 10 years ago . 
  seriously , if you are a qualified electrician with all the right certificates and such and possibly some work experience , i would say finding a job as such in sweden should n't be impossible . 
  but you would need to learn swedish . 
   it literally translates to white russia . 
  i do n't know about other languages but in swedish belarus is actually called white russia ( vitryssland ), 
   they build good traktors . 
  heh got me thinking of an old comedy skit . 
  http://youtu.be/7dj1mxmw0qq sorry it 's not particularly funny or relevant :(, 
  the left party is also staunchly feminist . 
  my guess is that the proposal for a ban was based on the belief that porn is oppressive of women . 
  went to aiya napa when i was 18 and behaved like a drunken idiot . 
  sorry about that . 
   adventure games were really how i built vocabulary , especially sierra 's ( `` ken sent me '' -- btw. , look what just appeared on steam ... ) . 
  descriptions and dialogues were in text and you had to type out what you wanted to do . 
  fellow larry-tutored english speaker here . 
  10 years old with a dictionary on my lap trying to get a balding middle aged bunch of pixels laid . 
  taught me good :d, 
  i 'm surprised by spains high numbers here . 
  weird how it sticks out from the rest of southern europe . 
  for sweden the following are the biggest ( i think , i did ` nt really do any research ) way out west , gothenburg sweden rock , s\u00f6vlesborg ( small town in southern sweden ) peace and love , borl\u00e4nge, 
  agnetha f\u00e4ltskog would be the abba-womans name . 
  maybe you got ljungberg from the swedish footballer fredrik ljungberg ? 
  are you presuming this kind of number manipulation only occurs in sweden ? 
  kinda funny how unemployment still is the hottest political topic here even though we are among the top countries in this statistic . 
  short sentences for young criminals are very common in sweden . 
  i believe he was 16 when he the murder took place which would give him a sentence relief of 3/4 . 
  also , placing people under 18 in prison is uncommon if it even occurs . 
  hence the juvenile detention . 
  futhermore , the case might also be tried in the highest level of courts in sweden , to set a precedent for what punishment is appropriate according to the law in a situation like this . 
  while immigration might be relatively high , it 's hardly uncontrolled . 
  using hyperboles are not very constructive . 
  youth unemployment is a hotly debated topic here . 
  dat [ hurts ] ( http://www.ikea.com/se/sv/catalog/products/10192824/ ), 
  just yanking a bit on you , let 's quit now before there is crying , 
  pfff , ca n't take the pressure so you decide it was a joke ? 
  that 's kinda lame ... 
  that might be true , but if you think people are ready to build spare bedrooms to accommodate immigrants , then you do n't know anything . 
  well , then you do n't know anything . 
  the might be the reason , but the argument is still what i said . 
  wow , that would n't fly in my part of the world :d, 
  they 're called queue jumpers and boat people by the media ? 
  in sweden the ( conventional ) media would rarely group people by skin colour these days . 
  the word `` f\u00e4rgad '' ( literally : coloured ) has definitely fallen out of favor and i do n't think referring to someone as `` svart '' ( black ) is especially common either . 
  if the media need to refer to a group of people i think they would most commonly use the ethnicity or nationality of the people in question . 
  the last few years the term `` illegal invandrare '' ( lit : illegal immigrant ) has increasingly been replaced with `` pappersl\u00f6sa '' ( lit : paper less , referring to their lack of valid visa , id and so on ) . 
  the argument is that it would be immoral to refer to any person as illegal . 
  sweden agrees, 
  no , not at all . 
  pathetic as it may seem ... 
  pronouncing it is the easy part . 
  there are about 20 ways to spell it :(,
