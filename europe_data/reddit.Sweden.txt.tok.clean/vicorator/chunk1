an now unhanited town of [ upp\u00e5kra ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/upp%c3%a5kra ) in sweden is dated back ti the first century bc . 
  like you could beat us in football . 
  pfff, 
  i think this one of the best things about norway . 
  you are a role model for the whole world in this way . 
  that 's what i got too . 
  maybe op is from norway . 
  i agree . 
  calling them nazis is a bit much . 
  yes they are far right and all but i 'm pretty sure they are n't blaming everything bad on the jews and trying to owerthrow the goverment . 
  modern germany 1990 - now . 
  what 's your point ? 
  how many % does a party need to be let in ? 
  living in kiruna , sweden i ocasionally but very rarly hear me\u00e4nkieli , sami and/or finnish while walking around town . 
  althoug i take great shame in not being able to differentiate the three . 
  icelandic worsr must be lj\u00f3tur which is translated to ugly . 
  it 's not a slang for ugly , it 's actually the word for ugly . 
  the good news is that there are at most like 3 old guys named it now . 
  she was legal when she started driving in denmark . 
  excuse my ignorance but does n't schengen allow romanains to enter and stay in sweden at there own desire ? 
  edit : thanks for clearing this up . 
  in an interview , a fireman at the scene described the road as straight and not icy at all and thus wondered how the bus drove off the road . 
  it is also important to note that an investigation is underway and will hopefully describe the cause of the accident soon . 
  the concept of never seeing snow seems so unreal for me . 
  being born in iceland , lived in sweden and most recently in [ the arctic ] ( http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/40119000/gif/_40119162_sweden_north_map203.gif ) i 've experienced a lot , even in the summer i can find snow around the mountains . 
  pretty good , but it relies on the weather . 
  amazingly beautiful nature , small town and nice people . 
  it can get very cold here ( -46 \u00b0 c personal record ) but for me the worst part is there is hardly any sign of spring until may . 
  otherwise i 've loved it . 
  chill is exactly what you would do . 
  it 's -25 \u00b0 c here and just taking this picture got all of me freezing . 
  luckily it 's not my car !, 
  in icelandic it 's pronounced p\u00f3l\u00f3, 
  prins p\u00f3l\u00f3 is so delicious !,

  i hope you enjoy populism . 
  well let 's not forget the thousands of norwegian and danish jews which were given asylum and safety in sweden during the war . 
  swedish actions were indeed questionable on some occasion but these kinds of accusation and acting like it 's we and them are ludicrous . 
  it was not our generation of leaders nor we who made the decisions just like this did n't directly effect you . 
  stop this nonsense blaming . 
  indeed, 
  it 's a joke you pisshead , that 's my point . 
  and this post is a satire over the recent style of posts . 
  ever heard of the apollo program ? 
  i do n't have to identify with either party to disagree with you . 
  oh definitely not . 
  but that is not why they 're closing down . 
  for some perspective : the company that runs the festival has not been doing so great profit wise . 
  an svt analytic says this is probably an excuse for the company to hide behind . 
  haf\u00fe\u00f3r himself made a statement on facebook that he was indeed being sued by his ex for abuse and that he is n't willing to comment any further on the matter , [ link here ] ( https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10158741346475391&amp;id=760890390 ) . 
  so yes , the accusations are real , but if they are true is for the courts to decide . 
  recently in icelandic media , he has been quite controversial since he has been accused of domestic abuse against his girlfriend . 
  since then multiple ex-girlfriends have come forward and described similar treatment by haf\u00fe\u00f3r . 
  yet in international media , he is still idolised slot including english written icelandic media . 
  source in icelandic : http://www.visir.is/g/2017170619262 edit : i just want to address u/avar comment and that i disagree with his/her comparison of v\u00edsir with the daily mail but agree with him/her on the witch hunting part . 
  my goal was not to smear his image in any way , shape or form but to inform foreigners of news which are n't being covered and providing sources ( i realise now that i could have done more on that front ) . 
  v\u00edsir ( and its paper form : fr\u00e9ttabla\u00f0i\u00f0 ) is one of two major news outlets in iceland . 
  it 's true that others have not yet reported on the claims but the evidence for them is in my judgement satisfactory for at least bringing the to people 's attention . 
  haf\u00fe\u00f3r has confirmed the lawsuit on facebook and denies the accusations . 
  it might be a part of siberia but it 's still south of denmark . 
  mostly yes . 
  kiruna is closer to the norwegian coast then the swedish one . 
  the norwegian mountains stop slot of that heat coming ourway . 
  indeed, 
  the keyword is money . 
  what do you do if you get lost in an icelandic forest ? 
  stand up, 
  traitor of what ? 
  my european citizenship ? 
  yes !, 
  thank you to the people of france for making a sensible choice for the whole of europe . 
  inform me, 
  beautiful,

  birgit friggebo also had one of those moments . 
  in a town hall meeting full of upset immigrants she thought it would be a good idea to ask everyone to sing we shall overcome . 
  if american culture would stop glorifying the constitution and be more willing to replace it with something more adjusted to modern society . 
  now i feel odd because i like country . 
  i 'll set up a colony on the delaware again . 
  i do n't think norway will be joining the eu any time soon, 
  maybe `` welcome to sweden '' would be a good start for you . 
  it 's a comedy about an american guy who moves to sweden with his swedish girlfriend . 
  also solsidan is very populer i. sweden . 
  unfortunatly not . 
  i 'm originally from iceland so i spend most of my vacations there . 
  but next semester i will be attending in a school in kiruna . 
  so hopefully i will be able to see more of the northern part of sweden . 
  my icelandic sister is attending chalmers in gothenburg next semester . 
  i think they have english courses . 
  no reason really , just never yraveld in sweden any more south then gothenburg . 
  not much , i 've never been down south so i ca n't really say . 
  in sweden we have blocket.se and tradera.se which is the swedish version of ebay . 
  i have n't seen any trouble caused by gypsies up here . 
  neither in media or first hand . 
  i guess it 's a bigger problem doen south . 
  k-marked is a swedish culture-mark . 
  it means that you ca n't change the looks of the building . 
  my house is around 160 years old . 
  it 'd k-marked so we ca n't paint the outside any other color then it already is .
