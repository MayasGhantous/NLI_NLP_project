no , preferrably not . 
  i 've tried monogamous and polyamorous relationships , and i 've found myself more at ease in the latter . 
  even worse and weirder , it was a * sword * attack . 
  it left four people dead , including the assailant when he approached the police aggressively with a drawn sword . 
  it 's in their culture , you know . 
  i think it 's called the napoleonic wars, 
  like any other * civilised * country , shoes are taken off in private homes , so that the socks are the only thing separating feet from floor . 
  bohemia imperator !, 
  all shall bow to hussite wagenburg !, 
  why the fuck is that ? 
  not sure if that 's a compliment or an insult . 
  ** but anyways , here it is in swenglish : ** tj\u00e4ll aj comp\u00e4r di to a sammers dej ? 
  to be fair though , the moon is called europa in english too . 
   if you think refugees should die at the border , you do n't belong in the eu . 
  plain and simple . 
  word . 
  exactly . 
  if they reject it , fine , they supposedly have the right to do so even though it 's inhumane to refuse aid to the helpless . 
  but countries ca n't just pick and choose anything when it comes to the union . 
  benefits and investments are inseparably coupled with responsibilities and plights , and that applies to any and every eu country . 
  i suspected as much . 
  are the county flags controversial too ? 
  how would you go about getting a non-controversial one ? 
  i do n't have much relation to it . 
  the flag is flown at public buildings on public holidays and such things . 
  i mostly see it at sports games and the like , or for identifying as swedish here on reddit . 
  when i was a school kid , it was flown at school on graduation day each year before the summer . 
  for me , the flag symbolizes all the positive things about sweden in all its loveliness . 
  but we do n't really have as much of flag tradition as some other countries . 
  that 's not because we do n't like the flag or afraid to fly it , but just a matter of different traditions . 
  interesting !, 
  is there any suggested flag that is n't controversial ? 
  trump can fuck right off . 
  interesting perspective . 
  as a swede who speaks english very well , english with a swedish accent makes me want to cringe . 
  tl ; dr not really . 
  but a little . 
  like u/fridgerunner said earlier in this thread , rising water levels on the mid-to-northern east coast of sweden will be largely offset by the [ postglacial rebound ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/post-glacial_rebound ) . 
  ( tl ; dr the land rises slowly ) [ here ] ( https://www.lantmateriet.se/globalassets/kartor-och-geografisk-information/gps-och-matning/referenssystem/landhojning/bilder/nkg2005lu_stor.jpg ) is a picture of how much the land rises in scandinavia . 
  in the far south however , the land is very flat and not rising at all or even sinking very slowly ( about 1mm/year ) . 
  i think we 're going to see some measures taken to combat the sea level rise , but so far none of them have left the visionary stage . 
  the county administrative board of sk\u00e5ne , sweden 's southernmost county , produced a [ report ] ( http://www.lansstyrelsen.se/skane/sitecollectiondocuments/sv/samhallsplanering-och-kulturmiljo/planfragor/planpm/stigandehavsnivaplanpm1.pdf ) in 2008 ( in swedish ) about the future of the region though . 
  in the stockholm area , the main concern is preventing that the sea level ever rises above the level of lake m\u00e4laren , which provides the drinking water for about 2.5 million swedes . 
  given that the lake is currently about 0,8 meters above sea level , this should n't be a problem . 
  ensuring that the lake remains made up of freshwater has been an important part of urban planning in central stockholm where the lake drains into the baltic sea . 
  sweden : our cauldron fucking sucks , but at least it 's better than everyone else 's . 
  so the swedes stay put . 
  sure !, 
  meck-pomm and wismar can come too . 
  no , it 's just not very fun to watch i think . 
  we have an agreement . 
  all hail the king , carl xvi gustaf . 
  are you suggesting a personal union between sweden and estonia ? 
  because i 'm * totally * up for that . 
  indeed !, 
  to be exact , 8,61 % of the swedish foreign-born population was born in finland . 
  ( but just 1,54 % of the entire population ) . 
  really ? 
  i 've never met anyone who considered themselves norwegian because they were from there . 
  if anything , j\u00e4mtlanders have a tongue-in-cheek republic going on . 
  oh , of course not . 
  the only thing that 's gon na be raging is the music and singing . 
  i 'll even bring a photo of the codex argentus . 
  \\* germanic five *, 
  \\* exits swedishly *, 
  i 'll bring the elderberry aqvavit if you want some . 
  a bad case of the habsburgs . 
  all too common in european royalty . 
  ** cities : ** * ** stockholm : ** a city populated by self-absorbed hipsters , indulgent brats and politicians . 
  apparently nothing is a problem to these people unless it affects them personally . 
  * ** gothenburg : ** pun-loving fish-eating hipsters and dock workers * ** malm\u00f6 : ** you merely adopted the falafel . 
  we were born in it , molded by it . 
  ** areas : ** * ** sm\u00e5land : ** cheap bastards . 
  they love god and ikea . 
  * ** the coastal north : ** civilized part of northern sweden . 
  * ** the inland north : ** these people vote social democrat . 
  also , they hate wolves . 
  the love to hunt , especially for wolves when it 's the season . 
  sami people live here and , like , herd reindeer i guess ? 
  * ** gotland : ** medieval-crazed shepherds . 
  * ** v\u00e4rmland : ** [ snus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/snus ) - loving people who wish it could be the 1950s again . 
  which it kind of is back there anyways . 
  no one goes here except passing through between stockholm and oslo . 
  * ** sk\u00e5ne : ** basically denmark . 
  but we 're not giving it back because fuck you denmark . 
  * ** dalarna : ** the sweden of sweden . 
  conservative but also socialists , however that works out . 
  also , fuck wolves . 
  neither , since the sikh community in sweden is very small . 
  if i saw one , i would assume he 's from here somewhere . 
  no , sadly not . 
  but it was awesome . 
  he 's still putin 's cock holster . 
  for my region , it 's a sort of friendly rivalry between stockholm and the ever-jealous gothenburg , as they are envious of our eternal splendor . 
  ( totally not biased here ! ), 
  for countries , we have sports sibling rivalries with our nordic neighbours , but they vary depending on the sport . 
  in football ( real one , not am . ), 
  it 's denmark and to some extent norway . 
  in ice hockey , it 's finland . 
  generally though , fans can enjoy each other 's company after the game .
