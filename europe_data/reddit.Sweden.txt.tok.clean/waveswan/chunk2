  because putin literally has to keep on showing muscle to remain in power in order to distract his people away from how badly they are being screwed . 
  it is unlikely he will be stupid enough to try to pull an invasion of a nato country , but expect a load of provocations and sabre rattling . 
  putin 's problem is essentially that he is trying to run a civilian government as if it was an army . 
  you ca n't do that . 
  a military has an external source of funding and can kick out low-performing members . 
  it relies on strict discipline enforced by threatening to dismiss anybody who does not fall in line . 
  if you try to do the same with civilian society you end up with fascism , cannibalising your nations resources , while suppressing creativity and creating a highly resentful class of poor people . 
  you ca n't just kick dissenting people out of society the way you can dismiss them from a military , unless your plan is to kill them in a stalinist sort of way . 
  now even if you are a total socio-path and think it is ok to do so , the consequence will be that people are afraid to point out problems or discuss honestly if there is a better way to do things . 
  it is a hopelessly inflexible system which only works until some external change or unforeseen issue triggers a sort of resonance cascade which causes the whole rotten framework to crumble under the weight of its own corruption . 
  the proper way to build a prosperous economy is more similar to a coral reef . 
  you need a solid structure , but the it 's purpose is mostly to support a diverse ecosystem filled with all manner of species . 
  this is more or less why western europe and north america are prosperous . 
  for all our problems we do have a fairly balanced political philosophy . 
  china and india are moving in the right direction , but the former has a serious issue with corruption and dictatorial leadership , while the latter is struggling trying to lift hundreds of millions of people out of severe poverty while battling everything from religious extremists to illiteracy . 
  if the west had any sense we would do a lot more to support india as they are likely to become a very important trading partner . 
  if we helped them with a powerful investment in advanced tech and healthcare , they would likely be able to take advantage of their absolutely massive workforce in order to reform their agriculture , manufacturing and infrastructure . 
  of course , they would never trust us unless we offered them guarantees to keep our companies in line and not let them rape and pillage the local economy . 
  north korea is a bad example for many reasons . 
  in particular china backing them up . 
  russia does not have that luxury . 
  it 's like when people compare israel and south africa as if that whole holocaust thing and three decades of arab invasions never happened . 
  analogies are useful , but you kinda need to be honest about their limitations . 
  geopolitically , the way to interpret a statement of this kind is along the lines of `` go ahead , take your pound of flesh , but if the scale deviates by even as much as a hair 's width , if you slip up even once , if we catch the slightest possibility , we 'll come down on you like a tonne of bricks . 
  you 're a tiny little mouse running around just out of reach of a crouching kitten , and we would love nothing more than to watch you limp around bleeding and squeaking while we play with your body . '', 
  basically , it 's a bit like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vevvrfuvk30 ), 
  documents released under those `` many decades now '' rules various countries have has revealed that historically the us considered it worthwhile to defend sweden even though it is not a nato member . 
  the most likely reason being a combination of us sharing military technology , intelligence information as well as friendly diplomatic and economic relations . 
  much of the controversy over sweden 's wire-tapping program is pretty much that its entire purpose is to spy on russia so that we can give the information to washington for `` strategic '' purposes . 
  i.e our defence policy is based on the idea that the nato countries appreciates our shady deals enough to wish to defend us . 
  finland would almost certainly be defended for similar reasons , the fact that it 's one of the actually responsible eurozone members , as well as its importance to sweden . 
  de-facto we 're part of nato . 
  it is sort of like israel 's `` strategic ambiguity '' over the nuclear weapons . 
  it is not officially official for political reasons , but everybody knows about it . 
  we spy on the russians and make all kinds of cool military tech for the americans . 
  finland is a buffer between russia and northern europe , and the continent would probably help us because it 's nice to have trading partners that do n't fuck up their economy twice a decade . 
  ** wall of text ** the reason people are not getting anywhere is almost always due to problems with social policy , thus when they leave the consequence tends to only be that other people fall down into the same misery . 
  such policies also cause intelligent people to leave the country , resulting in brain drain and problems for business . 
  when you know exactly the types of problems these people struggle with , what they value , and so on , it becomes possible to speak to the moderate ones ( defined as those who want to collaborate and compromise ) at which point you can actually start to address the problems . 
  fail to do so and you will lose not only the poor , but also many of your skilled and talented who go elsewhere . 
  for instance , the romanian government is losing its doctors to germany , and if they do not address the social issues that push the roma into poverty and desperation , they will be unable to fix their economy and hence continue to lose their best and brightest to the west . 
  problem is , in order to explain this you must demonstrate that it is possible for the roma to be part of society and productive . 
  many people in romania believe this naive and impossible . 
  the same is true for muslims . 
  treat the ones in your country well , show the world how their problems are not due to any inherent inferiority , and with time you will be able to put much more political pressure on the governments that refuse to listen . 
  my country has been doing this for more than a century , and throughout it we 've always been told how we are at the brink of disaster , yet the doomsday prophesies keep failing to become reality . 
  they said teh same about bosnians , the greek , vietnamese immigrants , jewish people when sweden accepted them during ww2 . 
  in each case it was supposed to be different from the one before it . 
  in each case they were said to have many children , rape women , drink alcohol , and be unwilling to adapt . 
  in each case the doomsday scenarios failed to materialise . 
  now we 're being told that he muslims are different from all these groups . 
  we 're being told so by people i can guarantee you have spent very little time actually talking to the immigrants and refugees . 
  i know this because i do talk to them . 
  i do know what they are like , and in general the media and rumours are about as reliable as they are for other things . 
  also , for completeness sake . 
  i do n't vote for the feminist party , and i consider the left wing party to have good intentions , but poor understanding of economic concerns . 
  the parties in our government that are the most sensible are the libertarians , the social democrats the centrist party , and the greens . 
  the latter is relatively new and have had to learn to moderate their policies the hard way , but they will come around eventually . 
  our right-wing business party has some smart people in it , but they just ca n't help themselves but trying to create jobs by squeezing the poor , and that is why they never get more than one or two terms in office before voters are disillusioned with their ideology . 
  much like thatcher , reagan and pals they see some brief prosperity by pushing hard for short term economic benefits at the expense of long-term sustainability , and thus a few years latter people hate their guts while their supporters long for the good old days . 
  i do suspect angela merkel will suffer the same inevitable outcome . 
  germany is strong right now , but such things do not last forever , and when hard times come their right-wing will blame the left and insist they need another merkel , and that tax-cuts with austerity measures is teh way to fix things . 
  to some degree we need those people from time to time because the progressives also have a tendency to go overboard with ideology , but it tends to take a little longer than with the authoritarians . 
  typically what happens is that when things have worked out for a while some left-wing radical surges to power and voters have short memories , not realising that this has happened many times before in history . 
  oh well , i went of a bit on a tangent there , but yea , that 's how i see things . 
  what are russia 's most important exports to europe aside from things like gas ? 
  is there anything consumers can boycott themselves which we can inform others off ? 
  moreover , can this not be exploited aggressively to tear a new one for those politicians that refuse to take action on fossil fuel dependence and advertise all kinds of alternatives ? 
  nothing brings people together like fighting a common enemy , and putin has loads to lose if support for renewables and energy saving measures soar . 
  there is a sort of `` uncanny valley '' where it is hard to tell if your problem is that you expect too much or too little from the people you talk to . 
  explain why you disagree in too much detail to a person who understands , and they will be offended because it is patronising . 
  explain too little to somebody who does not understand , and they will be offended because they perceive it as an attack . 
  on the internet you get to deal with both at the same time . 
  it was too much at once and too suddenly , with too little recognition of the problems and difficulties involved . 
  people are slow to trust contrary opinions , and tend to assume the worst when faced with them . 
  the difficulty is to explain it thoroughly , while being very brief , and recognising the dissent without aggression . 
  my post can easily be read as very arrogant . 
  the lack of body-language and tone in on-line communication makes things worse . 
  it is difficult to predict people 's reactions when you know almost nothing about those who will read what you write . 
  a great many arguments arise from this simple fact . 
  when the normal clues for the intention behind a statement are missing , people substitute their own assumptions instead . 
  consider as an example how incredibly arrogant this very post can be seen to be , if one simply assumes that i believe myself superior to other people . 
  somewhat ironically some posters suggested i must be an extremist man-hating feminist , while i was just now banned from / r/feminism for explaining that i figured it would be easier to convince people if one stuck to the term `` egalitarian '' , even though most mainstream interpretations consider them to have the same meaning . 
  such it is like to stand in the middle . 
  you try to understand everybody , and a great many hate you for it . 
  oh no thanks is necessary , we made sure to charge a hefty price for it by tapping all their phone lines and giving the information to the british . 
  as you may be aware , a combination of cryptanalysis , radar and conventional intelligence more or less won them the battle for britain . 
  we prefer to export tonnes of weapons to our allies and supply the us with intelligence information . 
  same effect , but far more profitable . 
  you are making quite a lot of assumptions about me without knowing . 
  i did for instance never claim that all problems can be solved in this fashion . 
  what do you really ** know ** about me ? 
  you call me naive , yet appear to believe you can deduce all these things with very little actual information . 
  again , what am i to think about you , based only on what you write ? 
  i know nothing of your age , education , experience and so on . 
  all i have to go by is the fact that you make very many assumptions about me , many of which are wrong . 
  why is that ? 
  it is complicated to say the least . 
  also note that the universal healthcare system is not organised the same way everywhere in europe . 
  some countries use insurance based healthcare ( subsidised by the government ) , others use a voucher based system , and some make extensive use of single payer government provision .
