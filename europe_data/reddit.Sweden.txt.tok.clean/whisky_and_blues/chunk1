his comment was not radical in any way , whatever his opinions may be , and refering to `` nationalis socialists '' was not warranted . 
  whoa . 
  i always thought it was the beatles, 
   instead of supporting deranged national socialists whoa slow down there . 
  are you trying to make a point , or are you trying to derail ? 
  edit : \\  thought it was beatles \\  is clown, 
  i think it may be the exact moment of impact, 
  it 's a great song !, 
  the soviets will * never * reach them !, 
  if i buy a stack of the dutch ones for my company and just rotate them myself , will my accounting value shoot through the roof ? 
  betcha they are all russians who have been living there for generations without being given citizenship, 
  repression does n't work in the long term . 
  i think people mind that guy because he is a pretty-boy , a disco-turk and an asshole . 
  the age-thing is only because they try to make it political, 
  [ in this thread ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axu8w336ogs ), 
  so many redditors believe for some reason that they are the inventors of truth and logic . 
  well i mean us stockholmers do understand some of it , but we usually have to lean forward three times each sentence with a confused look on our faces and say `` va ? '' . 
  it 's a pain speaking to danish people . 
  and then there 's the * language barrier . 
  i hear they sparkle and are great at sex, 
  if that was the case there would n't have been a conviction at all, 
  no , op is presenting straight facts that are pretty easy to interpret . 
  and being behind only scandinavia and luxembourg in per capita is pretty good . 
  the fact that you argue this ( that everybody already understands btw ) with a capitalised `` lmao '' to emphasize your enthusiasm over having found something to contradict the article with , just makes you seem a bit slow . 
   where are all the `` oh these people are educated and we should be taking in as many as we can '' fellas who usually inhabit these immigration threads now ? 
  not as active during office hours, 
  do n't look a gift horse in the mouth please, 
  \\  shows up in thread about bomb-threat against spd \\  complains about spd stay classy edit : the deleted comment above was from a sweden democrat complaining about spd rethoric . 
  but there are atleast two times that russia has invaded finland without much cost so she 's got some ignorance to fix regardless, 
  it was an svt car that had three eggs thrown at it, 
  but they aired it lol, 
  some football fans i 've met have a favorite british one ( \u00edn premier league i think ) . 
  or they cheer for barcelona for no good reason, 
  you named your cat from the book `` the idiot '' ? 
   they considered it as taking their revenge . 
  as did the serbs in srebrenica, 
   fyi : the gas mask on the right is purely cosmetic golden dawn confirmed !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, 
  something something dirty girl, 
  but bulgaria fought for the germans ... 
   802.11 which means lots of potential fun . 
  does this mean you can set it off with any old `` browser phone '' from 2005 ? 
  when my old ones broke i went and bought a new pair that was exactly the same . 
  why mess with success you know ? 
  max . 
  i did n't name him myself . 
  he is ultra-needy and always wants to be on the desk and he constantly presses down the spacebar key . 
  but he is very nice company when he is facing away from the keyboard like in the picture !, 
  needs more monitors, 
  thanks . 
  that 's pretty neat, 
  it 's not very good, 
  i should clean [ my desk ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jfwmzzz.jpg ) : /, 
  explain explain explain, 
  i think that may be because people know that 's how much fun they 're gon na have on their entire trip . 
  stores should be cheaper than a plane i think, 
  this thread makes me feel like i 've been missing part general knowledge, 
  pm me if you 're ever in sweden with cheap booze, 
  what, 
  i 've never heard of the guy . 
  what has he done that is treason ? 
  yes , let 's murder 150 million people / s, 
  let 's not go to russia . 
  well from my perspective * the belorussians * are evil !, 
  \\  be u \\  looks at map \\  concludes russians are asians mfw logic, 
  kek 'd but seriously thought , has there been any critizism like that ? 
  i mean it 's russia that banned the food imports in the first place , so why would the eu care if serbia sold them fruit ? 
  especially since serbia is n't in the eu . 
  it would n't be crazy to think that falling oil prices could give room for other sectors to grow , but i think reluctance to invest in russia diminishes the possibility of that happening . 
  can we assume that : 15 gets pregnant and is afraid to tell her family about it and she does n't know where to turn to get help . 
  her much older boyfriend ( who is an al-qaida fanboy ) easily persuades the girl that they can go live with al-qaida as husband and wife . 
  the end . 
  whenever somebody links to dailymail on reddit , a british redditor inevitably shows up and points out that it 's a shitty paper that will print anything . 
  the article made it seem like he was ousted because of corruption . 
  i can never make up my mind about foreignpolicy as a news outlet . 
  that assumption is a great way to isolate the real world from ones perception of it . 
  the eu is n't much for protectionism . 
  i think poland is big stronk enough that other countries would be inclined to invest in fighting russia there tbh . 
  i was gon na say that even * sweden * has increased defense spending this last year but then i recalled some bullshit parliament crap about the budget so ^ never ^ ^ mind ^ ^ ^ that, 
  that 's why you rinse . 
  that does sound like a stupid gang you do n't wan na hang with . 
  but could it have been * bad * propaganda that you saw ? 
  i had no idea there was active fighting going on about this, 
  these are two examples of incidents where [ swiss ] ( http://www.rt.com/news/swiss-fighters-office-hours-514/ ) and [ swedish ] ( http://archive.defensenews.com/article/20130502/defreg/304290022/russian-attack-raises-questions-over-sweden-s-readiness ) jets were not scrambled because the airforce does n't have 24/7 readiness at all . 
  now i know neither of these countries are both nato and eu members , and that these embarresments have caused atleast sweden to keep at least some 24/7 readiness , but it does show that not all fighters are kept ready to scramble immediatly at all times . 
  i 'd guess that most fighters are only on alert if there is a very serious risk of a war breaking out . 
  okay i would never have guessed . 
  but i still do n't think 1000 aircraft could be scrambeled to the baltic that quickly even just after lunch on a tuesday . 
  i seriously doubt that number . 
  do you have a source ? 
  it means the rouble has lost value and now you have to pay more of it for the same result . 
  it 's more expensive for the average russian to bribe them , but do n't worry , we can still buy the future of russia with our evil western money at roughly the same cost / s edit : and by that i mean that russian bribe-prizes seem to not be tied to the russian currency, 
  wow i did n't remember that scene being so terrible, 
  i did n't know that . 
  it 's very interesting . 
  do they make executive cars like the mercedes c-class and such ? 
  more like a generic non-democracy imo . 
  what makes it facist ? 
  it 's not like you ca n't quit your job or stuff . 
  this is amazing, 
  you must have brain damage .
