  ~ ~ my god you are stupid . ~ ~ edit : politeness, 
  you did n't answer the question, 
  history of norway in the 1800s summed up into one sentence : /, 
  it 's * happening * !, 
  we are becoming irrelevant !, 
  : s nooooooo, 
   would i go there ? 
  i do . 
  it 's also where i got my cheap smuggle-vodka when i was young . 
   would i live there ? 
  i do n't want to live in any suburb at all . 
  i do n't really see how this is relevant ? 
  would i live in a depressing and poor neighborhood rather than where i live now ? 
  edit : phrasing, 
  if you say so . 
  i was n't being too serious , i just remembered something i 'd heard . 
  now i can only speak for the different parts of industry in which i work , which is around stockholm , but eeh ... u wot m8 ? 
  there was some journalist talking about him on some radio show in sweden when he was imprisoned , and she said * `` i wo n't miss when he shouted heil hitler and did the nazi salute , but i will miss his refreshing in-your-face-attitude blah blah blah ... '' * . 
  i have n't actually managed to find a picture of him doing a nazi salute though , but it did seem like he shared the stage at some rally with nazists . 
  mr heil hitler ca n't run against mr anschluss ? 
  ca n't someone good do it ? 
  now i 've heard it all !, 
  1st link says nothing about a no-go-zone . 
  i descibes one time a decision was made to not act against a `` mob '' . 
  there is no context whatsoever . 
  2nd one is a known and outrageous problem . 
  the problem is that gangs of kids throw rocks against ambulances , and imo that should be combated with rubber bullets , arrests and foster care . 
  i do n't know why more is n't done about it . 
  it may be a `` no-go-zone '' for unescorted ambulances , but the fact is that the ambulance did go to the location completly unmolested , after hesitating . 
  the article is 6 years old btw . 
  the last link is a report on criminal gangs in certain neighborhoods that seems to state that the police has n't been present enought in the neightborhoods . 
  it seems to be the basis for some kind of strategy that is to be decided , on how to combat it . 
  did you even read it ? 
  it does n't say anything about a no-go-zone . 
  oh yeah lots of no-go-zones here so scarry very spook, 
  germany - [ stalingrad ( 1993 ) ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108211/ ) a really cool war movie that i feel is a bit older than most movies that do n't portray war as just awesomeness and glorious action . 
  and it is n't pretentious or anything , it 's just a movie about the war . 
  i thought knossos was awesome . 
  i just wish the reconstructed part had been original , but the reconstruction was really nice anyway . 
  a drunk , nationalist five year old at that, 
  their milk is already owned by danskj\u00e4veln anyway, 
  you 're right . 
  this post clearly does not belong in this sub !, 
  * chairs are for sitting *, 
  * pulls out chair *, 
  and these are n't two different things ? 
  thanks for the info !, 
   `` and , i wo n't talk about the politicians who organized this , '' he said , and added that although albanian pm edi rama `` came to us after the incident they caused '' he was unharmed . 
  is it just me ? 
  i do n't get any good info on this , please update !, 
  what is happening with the ` mobilization ' and right sector expecting the army to come for them ? 
  is there something big happening ? 
  but that could only be affected indirectly , through increasing budget allocation towards law-enforcement , and the budget is really only decided on once or twice a year and even then the ukrainian economy is very troubled and increasing spending could cause very serious problems for the country . 
  the whole placed was fenced , i do n't think those hooligans were supposed to have access to the place at all . 
  yes , he could n't get burritos at home . 
  why are the sturmabteilung doing this rather than police , if it 's widely known that there is a crime ongoing ? 
  edit : oh just saw , they were corrupt . 
  fighting crime is very much an executive thing . 
  i do n't see how being in parliament would give you many possibilities to do that . 
  screw the greeks , * i 'm * doing that !, 
  the paper yesterday made it seem like they are getting somewhere . 
  the creditors seem to be willing to compromise . 
  so they are truly an actual conservative party ? 
  how exotic !, 
  i think i have the same thing with russian . 
  i may know all the words in the sentence , but i have no idea what it means . 
  `` deradicalize * this !, 
  attention is what he wants . 
  now * there 's * an idea, 
  sturle was being melodramatic . 
  no reason to get butthurt over somebody making a joke, 
  well the natives suck, 
  but reddit is absolutely terrible for news, 
  he seems pretty calm tbh, 
  i think we 've been there for quite some time actually . 
  at least according to / r/polandball, 
  dude, 
  what . 
  the . 
  alright , how about [ this paper , page 8 ] ( http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/pdf/expert/2011-10_iacovou_expert-paper.pdf ) . 
  not * you * again . 
  housing in sweden is looking way better than almost all other eu countries . 
  it 's shit in the cities , like everywhere else , but the mean age of swedes who move into their first home is 21 , and that is excellent . 
  to the right , under where you see the picture of europe with the capitals marked in wellow , go straight down and under the subscribe buttons you will se an option to `` how your flair '' and then you click on the little text that says `` edit '' . 
  you see it at the bottom of [ this pic ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/d9731187a4e804b238cf3791d60f1b2f.png ), 
  a common problem for the urban regions in europe . 
  sucks balls , and it aint gon na change . 
  flair up , m8, 
  i 'm gon na start out by saying booze and vehicle emissions taxes, 
   you mean exactly what you 're doing right now ? 
  though it may appear ironic , i was infact talking about your response to my comment . 
  so you just grabbed a half-truth you think seemed clever there . 
  and nice of you to tell me what my comments should be saying . 
  that way i could make comments that you ca n't play stupid about . 
  i did n't ask for your party manifesto . 
  i was musing that you talked about european charity in a subreddit that has very little of it . 
  seems lately whatever comment one makes in this sub somebody replies by starting an unwarranted discussion where they always must have the last word no matter how far from the point they have to go to get it . 
  you said we are cheritable in a thread ( infact , whole subreddit ) about how immigration is costly and where nobody wants to allow immigration because they percieve it will impact their welfare . 
  unless it 's with immigrants, 
  it 's as hillarious every time they do it .
