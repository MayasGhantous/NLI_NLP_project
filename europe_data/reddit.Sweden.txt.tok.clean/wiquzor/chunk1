since they navigate by the stars and are unable to fly during daytime , they are easy to catch , especially during summer . 
  [ like this ? 
  ] ( http://linaahlen.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/passionsfrukt.jpg ), 
  or perhaps i got a stroke . 
  who knows , 
  prosit !!, 
  \u00e4s we sej in sweden . 
  well , we do like our instructional videos to be specific so that we can learn something from them . 
  ok , how long until the first death by drone failure ? 
  we also love our `` l\u00f6sgodis '' . 
  translated roughly to `` loose candy '' =p, 
  i second this . 
  well , it at least got into orbit . 
  that would have counted as a success if this was kerbal space program . 
  til : there is a word for when it rains and the sun is shining at the same time o.o, 
  [ here is mine ] ( http://i.imgur.com/65rdwij.png ) i guess going to the same place in the alps multiple times does n't count for much when doing this kind of thing . 
  yeah , it 's pretty much a requirement to understand swedish to get the jokes . 
  [ this one ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/sweden/comments/2d2ggz/marsvin/ ) for example is pretty funny . 
  marsvin = guinea pig mars = the planet mars vin = wine mars vin = wine from mars, 
  ok , you got me . 
  but to be honest , you could get away with calling it high school any way since it 's approximately the same level of education . 
  after looking at the high school wiki page every country has it own definition and i think it 's confusing as hell . 
  but to be clear for anyone that 's wondering , sweden has something close to that is described under [ norway , here . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/high_school#norway ), 
  hehe . . sounds like fun actually . 
  but throwing bears around is more fun because vikings and stuff  changed bear to beer ;p, 
  well yes . 
  some one usually takes the responsibility to organise the dump truck and then the students go and buy their own cheap beer to waste . 
  well , that sounds like ... fun ? 
  indeed he did . 
  but since we live in stockholm it gets even weirder . 
  when they graduate they go around town on dumper trucks , playing loud music and spraying cheap beer everywhere . 
  - [ example ] ( http://youtu.be/zgrjrcmnm2m ) e. bear to beer . . that sure was embarrassing : s, 
  hehe , yeah . 
  it 's a leftover from when my brother graduated high school before summer started . 
  no one has bothered to remove it . 
  then you should go over to / r/sweden , there is an influx of puns posted there . 
  http://i.imgur.com/b5f66x3.jpg this is the view from where i am sitting right now . 
  just north of stockholm drinking some home made softdrink . 
  it is 26.5 c and partly cloudy . 
  how nice , 
  exactly my point ;p, 
  looks kinda cramped , it must get hot inside when it 's full . 
  one of the perks of being a member of the eu  no but seriously , personally i would prefere to include every one in europe . 
  oops . . well , yeah . 
  guess i got influenced by the other comments . . 
  i really like these `` x of the eu '' posts . 
  maybe we could get a `` parlament buildings of the eu '' next time , or something . 
  e. changed `` europe '' to `` eu '' . 
  indeed . 
  third place is not so good . 
  nope . 
  only been to the northern parts . 
  thoght 89.4 was for lichtenstein and 50.9 for san marino and 58.0 for italy and that the vatican is not included . 
  kinda surprised it 's so low in italy . 
  any specific reason for this ? 
  i only took a quick look since i am on the phone atm . 
  it sounds like a plausible plan for dry areas like spain and such . 
  but do n't really see the need for it up here in the nordic . 
  it has been heck of a summer this year and there has n't been any major droght , that i am aware of at least . 
  i know that it 's just an anecdote but still . 
  i know nothing about this and need to read up on it before forming an opinion on the matter . 
  but if there is no change to the quality and cost i tend to say go for it . 
  is n't 20 000 a bit too small of a number ? 
  only finland has something like 50 000 lakes . 
  well . . we got a carp ton of aircrafts , although i doubt they would send them up so that they can save some fuel or something . 
  also shooting at the trigger happy americans is never a good idea . 
  well . . [ you could . 
  ] ( http://www.dogecard.sl/ ) but one thing worth noting is that it was a campaign from btcx.se which is a bitcoin-exchange . 
  it was also not supported in any official way by the bus company . 
  you can always click * random * * article * , 
  ** sweden ** - a token report * [ link ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2014/08/02/us/us-spy-plane/index.html ) - us spy plane ends up in swedish airspace without permission . 
  `` as a result of this incident , the united states is discussing the matter with sweden and letting officials know there may be further occurrences where american jets have to divert so quickly they may not be able to wait for permission . '', 
  so they are basically saying though luck , what are you going to do about it ?

  i know . . you could just go to thelocal.se and get the same news =p, 
  great minds think alike !, 
  posted the same thing pretty much the same time you did :p, 
  those living in stockholm had to put up with [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d31ibu_qxky ) all summer, 
  indeed , [ it is . 
  ] ( http://www.svk.se/start/english/operations-and-market/nordic-system-map/ ), 
   now , while using hydrogen for vehicles appears unlikely with the emerge of high energy density batteries personally i believe that hydrogen is the most viable option as a fuel there currently is . 
  bateries wears out and are slow to recharge whilst hydrogen would be more like petrol . 
  even if they invent some kind of super fastcharging super battery that does n't wear out the amount of rare minerals and such that would be needed to create all the bateries needed would be enormus . 
  til : i am not most people, 
  ... ready the longboats !, 
  indeed , i am quite surprised myself . 
  i can see my house from here !, 
  harder to get in to nordic then space , 
  thees reports are kinda lacking but ca n't really add anything since this is half the reason i come here + on summer holiday , 
  there is a fun myth about the danish people calling him for `` christian the good '' and similar names . 
  this apparently started in old swedish textbooks ( i do not know if it still there ) and then got more traction when swedish authors picked up the nickname . 
  the idea being that the danish people were assholes and approved of the bloodbath in stockholm and thus increasing spite against the danskj\u00e4veln . . 
  i meant , the danish people . 
  i am sensing a hint of sarcasm , but in the off chance you are being sincere i 'll tell you to pull your head out of the sand . 
  i did study spanish for 4 years and then german for 2 . 
  personally i would no where near consider my abilities to speak german , good enogh to hold a decent conversation .
