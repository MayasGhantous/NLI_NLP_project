  just adding a simple `` store brand aldi nord ... '' in the title would go a long way . 
  i had literally never heard of aldi before today . 
  what is aldi ? 
  does it not take like a day before they usually do that ? 
  is it not more like 19.7 % ? 
  voter turnout 72.2 % , leve votes 51.4 % , want death penalty 53 % 72.2 * 0.514 * 0.53 = ~ 19.7 %, 
  imagine what an epic bar crawl that would be . 
  but to be fair , roghly half of the countries in europe are members of the union . 
  also most of the bigger countries are in the eu , making a larger number of the population to live inside a memberstate . 
  so i think it 's valid to post stuff about the union here . 
  there is also the matter of the translation issues when posting country specific news , as well as relevancy ( just as an example ) . 
  of course there are some bad eggs on here , but i doubt any one actually `` hate '' the uk . 
  althogh i think many see uk leaving the eu as a mistake and are happy to express that opinion when ever a thread allows for it . 
  what ? 
  no . . lies , all lies . 
  [ ] ( #fastleftparrot ) ** glorious !, 
  very cool !, 
  well . . 
  if she actually understood what they were saying , it was probably swedish tourists . 
  the thing that gets me the most is that trump say that cancelling `` limiting legislation '' will bring back jobs . . like there are no jobs in renewable energy . 
  guess it 's all about sucking up to certain states where coal and oil is produced . 
  [ * good , good . 
  * ] ( https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/zdsxbufwtxx1mj.1l40ymq--/yxbwawq9aglnagxhbmrlcjtzbt0xo3c9odawo2lspxbsyw5l/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/news/afp.com/6f638e7749699718297041c2c33ca810b07b85df.jpg ), 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agxbiswcqtm ) is probably why . 
  i do n't really think that the numbers of nukes really matter so much compared to losing the economy of the uk . 
  might be a bit of nitpicking , but it really depends on what you mean with '' . . years of peace '' . 
  i took it as meaning as not having wars between countries . 
  the conflict in irland come pretty close to being a war between member states , while the war in the balkans was technically not between member states . 
  the falklands war falls under '' ... and external conflicts '' witch you could argue that many of the recent wars in the middle east and africa also falls under . 
  well . . not really since they only joined the eu in 2013, 
  ... * not counting non eu members and external conflicts, 
  silly uk , it 's just ` ord ' with an extra w. 
  the amount the person who shall not be named says [ `` believe me '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdtemnhuptc ) is so weird . 
  it 's almost like the rest of what he say is not credible so he needs to add that to the end of every sentence . 
  well . . you can go to restaurants/pubs and drink whatever at 18, 
  [ she approves .

  it has to do with the [ economics of scale ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rk2hprenk8 ) . 
  cheaper to build many batteries under the same roof rather then spreading out the production in many smaller factories . 
  also . .  the name gigafactory comes from the factory 's planned annual battery production capacity of 35 gigawatt-hours ( gwh ) . 
  taken from the [ tesla website ] ( https://www.tesla.com/gigafactory?redirect=no ) . 
   weeeeeeeee !, 
   wooooooooo !, 
  is that the sound of a siren i hear ? 
  flairen checkar ut . 
  to be honest . 
  i 've only been to \u00c5re once and to austria like 7 - 9 times . 
  the alps are hard to beat , 
  heck no !, 
  the swedish mountains look something like [ this ] ( https://jonasinsalen.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/img_4167.jpg ), 
  indeed !, 
  here is one of my [ favourite images ] ( http://i.imgur.com/axflurn.jpg ) in the slope , 
  well . . do you have proof ? 
  have you conducted similar surveys and gotten another result ? 
  unless you do i will probably keep relying on the numbers provided . 
  so only looking at that particular video , keeping in mind that i am no expert on the subject , and only being able to speak for myself and my opinion on the issues he brought up . 
  id ' e agree on that . . * i think that the immigration policy have been a bit to open during the worst period 2013-2015 . but seems to be back at `` normal levels '' [ ~ 30000 in 2016 ] ( https://www.migrationsverket.se/om-migrationsverket/statistik.html ) * there is a problem with integration where migrants are being placed in specific areas , that combined with not having a job or other activities are creating these things that you see and read about in the news . 
  * migrants might be over represented in the crime statistics . 
  probably true ( i do n't know ) . 
  * there is/has been a problem with determining the age of unaccompanied `` children '' with some people arguing that the medical way of doing it is too inaccurate and unethical . 
  but since [ september last year ] ( http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/nytt-system-for-att-aldersbestamma/ ) it was accepted to use x-rays of teeths and knee joints to determine the age . 
  and some had to retroactively take the test . 
  * the so called `` housing crisis '' is a problem , but i am not sure that it would have been avoided by not accepting additional migrants . 
  it 's the same statistics that is reported by [ br\u00c5 ] ( https://www.bra.se/bra/bra-in-english/home/news-from-bra/archive/news/2011-01-18-how-common-is-rape-in-sweden-compared-to-other-european-countries.html ) and could be considered a valid statement . 
  other [ statistics ] ( https://www.bra.se/bra/bra-in-english/home/crime-and-statistics/rape-and-sex-offences.html ), 
  if you take enough left turns you will end up going to the right . 
  i did some googling and the photo is most likely taken [ here ] ( https://www.google.se/maps/@59.34536,17.8887316,3a,75y,233.41h,86.83t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1siw6gkospnd8p7qbfr2xshq!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) . 
  obviously it 's the translator that tries to make her look bad . . / s, 
  it 's been like this for a few weeks now . 
  iceberg lettuces are about 6 - 9 $ / kg, 
  great !, 
  i love avocados but they are a bit expensive ~ 1 $ a piece . 
  nice !, 
  btw , what are some products that we might expect to be importing from mexico ? 
  and [ katla 's ] ( http://gfx.bloggar.aftonbladet-cdn.se/wp-content/blogs.dir/428/files/2015/01/skarmavbild-2015-01-15-kl.-14.43.47.jpg ) !, 
  not to speak of [ this . . ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vprfp_teq-g ), 
  time to make europe great again !, 
  the stations look very good and i wish they would make more of an effort here in sweden . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.svt.se/nyheter/lokalt/stockholm/har-ar-citybanans-nya-station-vid-odenplan ) is a newly built station on a new line for commuter trains in stockholm . 
  very bland and boring in my opinion . 
  uhm . . crazy thought . . what if se does n't fly to belgium on monday ? 
  and here i am asking myself why people go on cruises ... ^ ^ ^ \\ ( not ^ ^ ^ counting ^ ^ ^ metal ^ ^ ^ cruises ^ ^ ^ or ^ ^ ^ drunken ^ ^ ^ party ^ ^ ^ cruises ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ finland ), 
   golf-states haha =p, 
  well . . those germans sure got their asses kicked . . again . . 
  they just need to send a torpedo through the exposed exhaust vent . 
  sweden : i think that of course we should help those in need , but that being said this situation could be handled better . 
  however what would you expect from a union of countries with different political agendas . 
  in sweden criticizing the system is pretty stigmatized so making any decisions are `` hard '' . 
  the best meal that i have had was actually in a restaurant in a small community just north of w\u00fcrzburg . 
  a sturdy meal with meat , potatoes and a fantastic sauce . 
  i guess it resembles swedish cousin a bit . 
  for the worst , i ca n't really say since , of course you might happen to end up in a bad restaurant . 
  that being said , the only bought meal i have gotten sick from was a macdonald in denmark . . so lets get on that bandwagon  3 . 
  for the movie i 'd suggest [ kopps ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0339230/ ) and for the book i do n't really know . . 
  football is by far the most popular sport , but depending on the season of course both hockey and cross country skiing are fairly popular as well . 
  [ normal weekend ] ( http://i.imgur.com/czq8oqn.png ) 2 . what ? 
  not that i know of . . 
  especially if you live in v\u00e4ster\u00e5s , 
  but they were not killed by the snow , it was the cold that got them . 
  a small amount of snow has never killed anyone .
