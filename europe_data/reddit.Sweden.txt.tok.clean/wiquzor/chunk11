  stockholm - ~ 81 $ for a 30 day ticket edit : will increase to ~ 85 $ on jan 9, 
  yes , then we only would have illegal cabs undercutting everyone not having to pay taxes and skip out on licensing and safety checks . 
  sounds great . 
  it 's still not a record for burning the goat down after its inauguration . 
  it took about 8 hours to burn it down this year . 
  the record is 6 hours , not counting the times it got burnt before the inauguration . . 
  not when you are [ fudging the numbers ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pk3xkq6.gifv ), 
  it 's all a scheme by the old vikings . 
  the ones who settled the area did not want competition from other viking tribes so they decided to name the green island iceland and the icy island greenland in hopes that others would continue westward . 
  how did i do ? 
  although a bit rusty . 
  i would not say that `` to slide in on a prawn sandwich '' really mean to have an easy life . 
  it 's more like when for example your friends have made plans for ( insert your culturally significant holiday ) . 
  every one that will attend this celebration have gotten specific tasks such as bring alcohol , make sure there is snacks , make dinner and so on . 
  at first you did not plan on attending the celebrations because you were working . 
  but in a surprise twist of fate your boss decide to give you the day off , so now you can attend the celebrations together with your friends . 
  then you will be `` sliding in on a prawn sandwich '' since you just have to show up and do n't have to prepare or bring anything . 
  it 's a shame that the walking dead is not set in europe . . 
  the shoveling season and snot . 
  i know of no reason why the shoveling season should ever be forgot !, 
  perhaps he gives trump some pointers how to handel his victory . 
  so people , do n't be surprised if trump stepps down from the presidency before the inauguration . . 
  what is the reason for not draining more of markermeer or ljsselmeer , or are there any plans in work ? 
  if you are in denmark , then you already are in purgatory . 
  62kg of cheese in the car , take one down , pass it around . .

  i am so glad that i live in a region with reasonable temperatures . 
  this summer has been pretty perfect so far . 
  mostly sunshine with some cloud and 20-25 \u00b0 c at most .

  how long is an imperial year in metric ?

  well . . france somehow needs to keep their military spending above the 2 % mark . 
  to put it in simpler terms , it 's roghly 96 800 tons of bananas . 
  * insert joke about going from germany to belgium throgh the lowlands *, 
  yeah , my comment is somewhat ignorant . 
  but the article did state that china was second with 16 % . 
  this is somewhat the same as the order of gdp for the countries ( us  eu  china  japan ) acording to wiki . 
  then we have a few countries that clearly does n't fit my assertion , like india and turkey . 
  imagine that , the largest countries are the largest markets . 
  would be cool if they actually did something like that . 
  althogh you could not fit many spectators along the river . 
   neither too hot nor too cold imho .

  i read `` destillers '' instead of `` desilitres '' and since you claimed to be from finland it made sense in my mind =p, 
  how should i know ? 
  ; ) but i imagine that it would work something like [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/kszuiqvjjg4 ) to achieve the vacume seal . 
  but as you say , there is still the problem with the stresses created by the pod and how to keep the tube in place . 
   i mean seriously , simply because of metal expanding at higher temperatures their `` train stations '' will literally move back and forth for dozens of meters even between medium large city distances as the night and day cycle goes on , especially during summer ... 
  i totally agree with that the hyperloop have quite some problems and i do n't think that it will really take of as a transportation method . 
  but as a layman i see the specific argument that the stations have to move a bunch , due to metal expansion , to be somewhat silly . 
  could n't you just make the tube segments overlap eachother , with some rubber seal , allowing for some expansion ? 
  im still betting that cracks and warping would be a huge issue , but whenever someone mentions the stations having to move a bunch it seems like they are overly critical to me . 
  ah . . yes . 
  article claiming to have stunning images of auroras over europe , taken from space , and then only containing one image of the aurora , taken in canada , from the ground . 
  -_- also linking to a bunch of articles from another site , one of which contains a bunch of different images taken by french a austronaut . 
  well . . 
  i sure did n't feel safe with [ these guys ] ( http://i.imgur.com/a5vmdxb.jpg ) in the street . 
  i am some what confused . 
  only reading the headlines on reddit the perpetrators were both hit by batons and tackled by police , then there was the romanian guy who hit one with a crate and then they got shoot ? 
  guess i should actually read a few of the articles ... 
  well ... 
  in my mind it 's an acceptable stop if you are on a road trip where you do n't want to spend any time at all searching for a restaurant and eating . 
  but i would certainly choose a real restaurant any other time . 
  i do n't think any one is saying that we should n't explore the viability of the ` hyperloop ' . 
  most people are just voicing their daubts about aspects of the concept that seems likely not to have an obvious solution . 
  the best way to find fixes to these issues are to build testing facilities and computer models . 
   yeah , until 2020 or impeachment . 
  i have a feeling that the only thing that will stop with trump are the tweeting ...
