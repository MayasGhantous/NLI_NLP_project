  thanks, 
  so what is the 3rd and 4th about ? 
  i miss the snow :'(, 
  well . . 
  sine we vote for the parties in sweden we leave it up to the parties to choose whom will lead them . 
  so there is n't really anything inherently wrong with the party choosing a candidate if the system actually is set up in such a way . 
  but of course they think it 's in their right to appoint whomever they think will do best , or can grease the wheels the most , as their candidate ... 
  but when taking the pains to hold an actual election they really should be hands off , not manipulate votes , and respect the result . 
  meddling with votes and election result is really shitty anytime , anywhere in my opinion . 
  according to the [ bbc article ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-39972987 ) there was some booing at the netflix logo , as well as the amazon logo in another film . 
  yes , quite so . 
  i have pondered over how to respond for some time and then it hit me , why not suggest that for europe to remember greece hinges on greece paying back their loans . 
  absolute genius i say !, 
  do n't worry , we wo n't . 
  now pay them debts . . 
  just to be clear that is an opinion pice and also relevant part . .  video-sharing platforms will be included in the scope of the avmsd only when it comes to combat hate speech and dissemination of harmful content to minors .

  well that 's the point is n't it ? 
  the conservatives think they are in a good position now and can secure more seats now than after the eventual hit they will take during/after the brexit negotiations . 
  they 'll also get more time to work on the aftermath of brexit before the next election in 2022 instead of 2020 ( unless another early election is called before that ) . 
  well . . if it was n't for the poorly photoshoped part in the centre/bottom right , it would be a pretty nice image . 
  the photoshopped part is hiding a somewhat [ ugly building ] ( https://www.google.se/maps/@48.8541788,2.339814,91a,35y,278.53h,79.14t/data=!3m1!1e3 ), 
  ehh . . do you think our [ runner up ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whz71a60coo ) would have been much better ? 
  i was kinda rooting for the [ third place . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnc09zwkixy ) ( could n't find a version of the performance that was not geo-blocked ), 
  we will happily provide the black and white striped clothing ( or equivalent ) to support their re connection with the past . 
  we have epic sax guy ( with a not so epic song this time ) , yodel rap and single duet . 
  although we probably need more . . 
  with russia not participating this year i guess we need some one else to boo at / s, 
  but it might be important = s, 
  i do n't think i heard the words love or peace once in th danish song, 
  hey norway !, 
  why not just send alexander rybak again . . 
  i 'd vote for that . 
  it 's obviously a sad , upside down , electrode . 
  only did a quick search and found [ this ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-33650713 ) article on top . 
  i am by far not an expert on the subject and are only speculating . 
  but that event took place almost 29 years ago and i would assume that there has been some research into making the cargo hold safer since then . 
  i 'm just speculating that it probably would be easier to make the cargo containers take a blast without extensive damage to the plane itself rather than what a blast in the cabin section would . 
  not that they currently are bomb proofed . 
  what are you on about ? 
  it 's obviously the rest of the eu that does not tax enough !, 
  after staring at the european map for hundreds of hours in paradox games i feel that i got good grasp of where all the countries are located . 
  although i have to admit that the balkan area is by far the hardest to remember correctly ^ ^ ^ sorry, 
  i guess it would be easier to bombproof the cargo bay / containers to some point as well . 
  nice song . 
  but imo euruvision contributions are one part the song and one part showmanship . 
  this is kinda lacking in the second department . 
  why do we care what the dimwits over at t_d think ? 
  is that not what he is saying tough ? 
  royalty benefits business that pay taxes funding stuff like healthcare , pensions and other stuff . 
  but with trickle down economics you basically remove the step where the business pay taxes and then expect the company to raise the employees salary when they are able to undercut the competition . 
  just south of the north pole, 
  * nani ? 
  top kek, 
  it 's better to have a memorable sculpture than a perfect replica of the real thing imo . 
  ** remember : ** please state your country when you reply . 
  especially if you have weird flair . 
  or no flair . 
  or an eu flag . 
  ^ i 'm ^ talking ^ to ^ you ^ secessionist !, 
  ^ ^ i ^ ^ thought ^ ^ that ^ ^ i ^ ^ would ^ ^ bring ^ ^ that ^ ^ one ^ ^ back , ^ ^ tihi . . -------------- if someone from your country has made a news-round-up that you think is insufficient . 
  please make a comment on their round-up rather than making a new top level post . 
  to reduce clutter . 
  it would be interesting to hear how the rest of europe is celebrating this weekend . 
  so feel free to post what you are up to  here in sweden both good friday and easter monday are holidays . 
  so it 's a 4 day weekend for most of us . 
  iam spending this easter with my family , eating salmon , pickled herring , and drinking schnapps while singing ofc . 
  it 's pretty much a watered down midsummer  what ever you are up to , i wish that you have a nice time whether you are with family , friends , work , or alone . 
  i know i am kinda vague when i say `` manipulating '' since it can differ both in extent and severity , the same goes for what constitutes a threat . 
  for example we have seen how russia have tried to interfere with both the us and french election by realeasing miss information . 
  also , russian state media does n't shy away from spreading rumours about sweden at home . 
  so they are probably doing the same thing abroad to some extent . 
  i am not too worried about it thogh but even so it is a threat that exist . 
  and yes , it is probably like you say since it 's always easier to reaffirm believes than create new ones . 
  it 's probably worse if his world of tanks account gets blocked . 
  short answer : yes . 
  long answer : i think that the biggest threat is in manipulating public opinion and cyber attacks to strengthen the russian position towards other countries . 
  and the threat of russia invading is next to nonexistent imo . 
  this mostly because i have a hard time believing that russia could invade an eu member without all hell breaking loose , both in terms of monetary and military punishments ( even if there is no current defence deal between eu members ), 
  for me , czech republic and all bordering countries + perhaps hungary . 
  what ? 
  how is a small scale brawl between far-right and anti demonstrators anything new ? 
  and really , what does it have to do with the ass hat in chief ? 
  now i know that the us probably does n't have the same rules about demonstrations that [ we have in sweden ] ( https://polisen.se/service/tillstand/demonstrationer/ ) , where it 's basically a close cooperation between the police and organizer of the demonstration making sure it 's safe . 
  but really , i personally view the recent violence in charlottesville as a failure of the authorities to protect it 's people , by either allowing such a gathering taking place in the first place , or not providing adequate protection ( on both sides ) for it to take place peacefully . 
  idiots with vehicles are always a problem and hard to protect against . . = /, 
  i like [ dijon mustard ] ( https://d1hr6nb56yyl1.cloudfront.net/product-images/9763-560.jpg ) , but if i want something sweetet i go with [ johnnyy 's grovstarka senap ] ( https://www.mathem.se/varor/senap-grovkornig/senap-grov-o-stark-500g-johnnys ) . 
  for ketchup heinz is the only right choice . 
  so , question . . 
  if i have sandals , should i wear socks or not ? 
  assuming ofc it 's in the summer and hot outside . 
  did they say `` that 's the guy we want for president '' ? 
  on a planet called earth . 
  well . . he 's british after all \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  no , not really . 
  however you can often see [ the flag of scania ] ( http://skanskaakademien.se/images/allmant/sk\u00e5neflaggan.jpg ) in scania . . 
  well . . lets say you are going on a ski tripp with the family . . where would you put all your bags and stuff ?
