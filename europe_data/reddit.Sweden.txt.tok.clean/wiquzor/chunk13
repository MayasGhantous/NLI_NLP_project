  as you probably already know , we sing snapsvisor on special occasions like midsummer , easter and christmas in sweden which is basically an elaborate cheers . 
  to be honest , romania and bulgaria joining the eu ( in combination with the financial crisis ) have had a more noticeable , every day , change with all the beggers that are sitting outside every food store , than the events you mentioned . 
  althogh the migrant crisis have been in the news quite a lot , it really has n't changed anything for me personally . 
   and i 'd imagine that you likely would struggle to rent it out for an amount that would cover taxes + hiring someone to manage it + maintenance . 
  hmm . . idk . 
  was talking about this topic with my aunt during the weekend . 
  she have a friend that bought a house for 15 000 $ in the forest , a few miles ( mile = 10km ) outside \u00d6rsk\u00f6ldsvik and was renting it out for about 1000 $ / week . 
  apparently it was going pretty well . 
  not op , but from what i have read in this thread it sounds like you are some left version of what `` v\u00e4nsterpartiet '' ( the left party ) stands politically . 
  i 've just been in this place before !, 
  i like baguettes , own a black and white striped shirt , do n't smoke , do n't own a beret , nor have a moustache . 
  so i am definitely 2/5 french . 
  oh wow . . now i feel really stupid . 
  i have always thoght it was called `` jail walking '' because of the implications , til i guess . . = 3, 
  to be honest i thought it was the other way around . 
  on my mothers side i apparently have ancestors that came from norway in the 12 century something , according to my grandmother that did some research . 
  also . . 
  if you pick seven different flowers on midsummer eve and then put it under your pillow . 
  then you 'll dream of the person you 'll spend the rest of your life with . 
  ok , so i think it 's bad in general to rely on gas or coal for power while shutting down nuclear power plants ( looking at you germany ) \u0ca0_\u0ca0 however it has been a hot political potato here in sweden since gazprom wants to rent some harbours during the project to base equipment and such for a shit ton of money . 
  of course there are some security concerns , but i am thinking that if we ca n't stop it being built why not take the money \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  hmm . . maybe , vic 2 is a 7 year old game at this point , and leans more on the cpu , so it will probably run on most things these days . 
  oh absolutely !, 
  you can probably get vic 2 + all dlc for ~ 10 $ when on sale . 
  it ** is recommended ** you get the all the dlc though , for the best experience . 
  some ppl might say europa universalis or crusader kings 2 is simpler to get in to , but i disagree . 
  here is a simple explanation about the combat since you do not seem to be familiar with paradox gmaes : the map is split in to smaller regions/municipalities , movement of military units are done in real time but takes a few days/weeks ( ingame time ) to move between areas , and if you manage to catch an enemy unit before they have moved out of the region , they fight . 
  i am not really an expert at the finer details , but it 's pretty much the same as in eu iv or ck ii . 
  you have infantry for the first line , horses for the flank , and artillery ( canons ) for the second line . 
  in vic ii i really enjoy playing as the netherlands for some reason . 
  the first mission of every game is to reclaim the lost clay of belgium  and in eu iv i like to play as venice . 
  ~ 2000 $ probably ( assuming it 's 3000 $ after taxes ), 
  almost always barefoot . 
  i have some warm slippers for when it gets cold . 
  talking to the neighbours . . the horror ^ ^ ^ ^ / s i think the main reason to use blinds in sweden is to block the light in the evening , night , morning , and during the day . 
  ehh . . why is it that miami uses the indian flag as their own ? 
  i think it 's normal to spend maybe about 40 - 60 min in a coffee shop if you are out on the town with friends and decide to have a fika ... 
  bielefeld , there is literally nothing to do or see there . 
  i feel to be anti gmo in it self is kinda stupid . 
  although i think it should be regulated such as no company have monopoly on seeds and there is enough diversity within the crops to avoid crop failures . 
  granted i know very little about the subject and this is just my initial thoughts about it . 
  meh , three of them are basically the same and english you get for free / s, 
  even so . . you are guaranteed to stand down wind to a smoker when waiting for the train about 70 % of the time ( even if they are not allowed to smoke there ), 
  i put the watermelon in the fridge , take it out on a warm day , split it in half , and eat with a spoon . 
  i have not tried watermelon with salt thogh ... 
  \\* * swoosh * \\* went right over my head =p, 
  presuming they have come a long way for the liveable surface of our planet , it would be kinda stupid to nuke it , depending on the aliens tolerance for radiation ofc . 
  it would probably be better ( in that case ) to use high velocity projectiles or slam us with asteroids . 
  unless , of course , they have death rays . 
  but in my opinion a tailor made biological weapon would be their best choice , preserving everything , except the pesky humans . 
  yes, 
  i do n't really see why the `` invading '' aliens would team up with either side . 
  why would they not simply blast us from orbit ? 
  probably . . ex machina - alicia vikander, 
  [ blodpudding ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/blodpudding ) and generally dishes made from blood/liver . 
  althogh i will definitely try everything new at least once . 
  - make sweden ( just right / moderate ) again !, 
  the same as me then , 
  ahh . . the old `` foppatoffla '' . 
  i think they are used by mostly younger people at the beach or at the summer house . 
  i would say swedish -  english -  spanish -  french -  german in that order . 
  details ; ), 
  sure it 's doable , but i think most people go on such trips when they have three , or more , full days free from work . 
  if you do it on a normal weekend you basically have 1.5 days in the city you are visiting , and you ca n't really `` do '' a city in such a short amount of time in my opinion . 
  did a hous-swapping thing with some friends of my parents that lived in orlando when i was 7-8 in ~ 98 during the summer . 
  i have nothing but good memories from that trip . 
  we visited pretty much all the sites disneyland , kenedy space center , seaworld , some crocodile ranch in the swamp , drove down to key west and saw some one catch a shark at the pier . 
  the worst things by far was that i could n't go very far out in the water at the beach in fear of sharks and that my metal belt buckle triggered the metal detector at the airport = 3 edit : oh . . and the breakfast at the disneyland cafeteria was horrible . 
  you could only get sweet bread and [ inedible cereals ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/froot-loops-cereal-bowl.jpg/220px-froot-loops-cereal-bowl.jpg ) , so we went and had waffles and pancakes at one of the parks . 
  this is not very helpful since your not visiting sweden , but . . 
  it 's fairly common , at least in stockholm , to find open wifi in some public spaces ( libraries , train stations ) , coffee shops , and malls etc. 
  also i think all mcdonald 's have free wifi . . 
  naa , they are airing the norwegian one texted in swedish . 
  yeah , but it got crazy big in sweden when svt started airing it . 
  i guess everyone and their mother is watching `` skam '' ( shame ) . . 
  i have not seen it though . 
  the only series i am currently watching is `` fallet '' ( the case ) . 
  it 's basically a humoristic crime drama , pretty much a mix of the movie `` hot fuzz '' and the series `` bron '' . 
  ehh . . the whole of finland is north of stockholm =p, 
   there are a bunch of cats . . where ? 
  i would think that most cats you see outside belong to someone , but there are ofc cats that get lost or get kicked out by ass holes . 
  but are there really that many cats living all their life in the wild ? 
  what ? 
  i have never heard of that one before and even if it 's true with a dam at gibraltar you could easily regulate the mediterranean water level against the amount of evaporation occurring . 
  perhaps you have looked in to it already , but what about taking an overnight train ? 
  that might be an option ? 
  yes, 
  i think in most cases it 's against the housing contract to have stuff hanging from windows and balcony . 
  but you can ofc decorate it with plants and other stuff . 
  yeah , that is probably true for most countries . 
  but it 's just a good way to get some perspective . 
  when spending 1.5 % we still would spend 3-4 times more than russia which could be considered the `` primary threat '' of the eu . 
  russia would probably get more for their money as well compared to the eu . 
  so perhaps 1 - 1.5 % of the gdp should be enough then ? 
  that would be closer to what china is currently spending on its military . 
  if the army is supposed to be used as defence and for maybe some peace keeping missions maybe a lower % should suffice . 
  well . . with the amount of cooperation between the swedish and finish military you could probably say that we are allies in all but name . 
  probably b\u00e9arnaise sauce in my opinion . 
  they have by far the best public broadcasting in the world , producing great shows like qi , broadchurch , downton abbey , sherlock , dr who , just to name some . 
  i guess it kinda depends .
