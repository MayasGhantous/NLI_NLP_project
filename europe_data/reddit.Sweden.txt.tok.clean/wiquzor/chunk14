  this year there were about 2.8 million watching the esc finals and last year there were about 3.6 million watching . 
  [ here ] ( http://bloggar.expressen.se/tvbloggen/2017/05/15/sa-manga-sag-robin-bengtsson-tittarsiffror-for-esc-finalen-i-svt/ ) you can see the numbers for the last couple of esc finals . 
  ... i would actually say the finally of melodifestivalen , the competition that decides who we send to the esc . 
  it 's pretty hard to ignore ... -_- apparently the finally was viewed by 3.8 million viewers this year which was a record since 2013 , but over all the viewership has been declining last few years .

  who wants to go to finland ? 
  :3 but in all seriousness i do n't think it really matters much where you go , unless the place is world famous or something . 
  all your future employer will see is that you studied abroad any way so . . 
  they are fairly strict at checking your id when buying alcohol and when entering clubs . 
  you might be able to have a friend that is over 18 to buy something for you in a bar but you 'll probably be denied entry to any clubs . 
  worth noting is that even if you are legally able to enter clubs at 18 , many of the more popular clubs tend to have a higer age restrictions ( 20-21 ), 
  on average 1 l/day perhaps . 
  i bet that all the political parties are flinging shit at each other . 
  then you have outside parties trying to dig up and fling shit at whichever side suits them . 
  the different political parties really should have their shit locked down by this point considering what has been going on lately . 
  but fighting fake shit is kinda hard when it spreads like cholera in 1850th london on social media . 
  men dalah\u00e4st ? 
  it is probably more or as common as the moose in souvenir shops . 
  one point that i have n't seen being made in this thread is that there are simply less physical space for stadiums in europe . 
  when i look at random stadiums in the us using google earth , they tend to go with massive parking lots surrounding the arena . 
  in europe there seem to be way more focus on visitors using public transport to get to the stadium . 
  the arenas seem to be squeezed in fairly central and combined with public transport . 
  this makes me think that some limitations of the size of the stadium might be due to the effectiveness , size and reach of the public transport in the area as well as safety concerns when there are a lot of people moving around . 
  this is only speculation of course ... 
  i only have it on pancakes together with raspberry jam ... but then i rarely eat pancakes so ... 
  well . . 
  i skied in dubai a few years ago , the slope was a bit heavy , but well pisted , no powder to speak of and a bit hard to go off piste . 
  the best part was hitting the beach afterwards , 
  yes , up to a point . 
  but it 's also included in preemptive and rehabilitative treatments by the tax authorities , so it 's [ free from taxes ] ( https://www.skatteverket.se/privat/skatter/arbeteochinkomst/formaner/halsoochsjukvard/forebyggandebehandling.4.7459477810df5bccdd4800014763.html ) under some circumstances . 
  yeah . . 
  i am sad to say that chiropractics is viewed as a viable treatment and that you can get subsidised treatments . 
  do n't know about the history though . . 
  i prefer football , `` soccer '' is to close to the word for sugar ( socker ) in swedish . 
  that [ documentary ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx3rotthg4e ) was pretty much the first real ` encounter ' with trump that i had . 
  he really comes across as the douche he is in that one . 
  eeh . . 
  i 'd say yes and no on that one . 
  while the series basically is built on highlighting cultural and social quirks of swedish people , it often overdoes it for comedic effect . 
  copyrighted , but i assume it 's [ this one .

   2017 terror attack in stockholm . 
  it shook us quite a bit . 
  not saying that it was not a despicable attack . 
  but i would say that it 's in our memory because 1 . it was recent and 2 . it 's marked as a terror attack that killed a few people . 
  of course there will be a lot of discussion if things could be done differently just after the attack and it will have much media attention . 
  but i 'd say it 's probably to early to tell if it 's a truly notable event . 
  for example . . 
  there was [ that guy who blew himself up ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_stockholm_bombings ) during the christmas shopping near drottninggatan in 2010 , but i guess that one is not memorable because the only one who died was the terrorist . 
  then we have the guy who [ drove through a crowd in old town in 2003 ] ( http://www.dn.se/sthlm/vard-och-skadestand-for-vansinnesforaren/ ) killing two . 
  but that 's not memorable because of 50 yo swede with mental health problems . 
  i think the swedish government does pretty good , although there is always more that could be done . 
  personally i think goverments in general could be more pro nuclear energy rather than using cole/gas . 
  2 . not really 3 . 
  from what i can tell it probably wo n't be a serious problem for me personally during my life time . 
  but that does n't mean it wo n't be a problem for later generations and/or food production in the future . 
  clearly it 's a problem that require a lot of for sight and global cooperation . 
  4 . ehh , nothing really . 
  buying locally and riding the bike / public transport . 
  ok , well . . it said on the swedish wikipedia page that . .  dikterna anses huvudsakligen vara tillkomna i v\u00e4stra norge och p\u00e5 island under \u00e5ren 800-1000 . 
  translated . .  the poems are mainly considered to have originated in western norway and iceland during the years 800-1000 . 
  all the poems have been narrated orally for a long time and the original authors are unknown . 
  but you are correct in that the actual texts are from codex regina made in the 13th century . 
  if i remember correctly we had some excerpts from codex regius with some swedish translation by the side . 
  but the teacher made us try to read the original first and revert to the swedish version if we could n't get the words ( which was all the time ) . 
  i actually thoght it was illegal until i saw these comments :3, 
  first thing that comes to mind is some excerpts from [ eddan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poetic_edda ) that we read in 8-9th grade . 
  ( a collection of norse poems from ca year 800 - 1000 ), 
  hmm . . perhaps osthyvel , i always bring one when on vacation . 
  nature always finds a way ... 
  while i agree with your post , i think that reddit is might be a fairly good representation on the age group 18 - 30 . of course we still get the problem of the loud minority on issues and that people generally are seeking out like minded subreddits . 
  in sweden they are called `` kolonitr\u00e4dg\u00e5rd '' / `` kolonilott '' . 
  pretty much the same in sweden . 
  third largest religion with ~ 45k members in 2011 . 
  it really varies from place to place in sweden . 
  but generally toilets are free if they are connected to a petrol station , a restaurant or other establishment , with the understanding that you should be a customer to use it . 
  regarding toilets in malls in the city there is about a 50/50 chans of having to pay something to get in . 
  i 've heard that the brits buy a lot of german cars and that is about it . 
  so i guess that they are in a fairly week bargaining position to start with . 
  i think [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/lxmwsmkieuc ) is a good summary , although some what melodramatic imo . 
  i think that the actions taken by russia/putin is mostly to protect oil/gas and the interests of the oligarchs . 
  whether that means securing territory or puting a finger on the scale making your neighbours align with russian intrests . 
  it was fairly common to see some ( what i presume was ) indian exchange students play cricket during the weekends at university . 
  hmm . . what is there to do in helsingborg ? 
  maybe visit slottshagen and then walk down to the harbour and take the 15 min ferry to denmark ? 
  san marino is well worth a visit . . although that 's technically not in italy i guess, 
   not sure what they think the rest of us do instead . 
  i do n't know how the rest of europe does it , but we gather one prominent politician from each region and place them on an uninhabited island in the baltic sea where they will battle it out . 
  the televised event goes on untill only one politician remain that can claim the title of prime minister of sweden . 
  repeat this every fourth year . 
  i think it 's some what strange that there are no famous swedish scientists like alfred nobel or carl linnaeus on there . 
  maybe the thinking behind it is that they already get enough exposure or something like that . 
  also at the summer holiday ceremony ( or what you would call it ) and at graduations i guess . 
  * galaxies ( unless you subscribe to the multiverse hypothesis ) but yeah . 
  looking at the data from the [ nasa kepler mission ] ( https://www.nasa.gov/kepler/discoveries ) earthlike planets that might possibly support life as we know it are fairly common . 
  about less than 1 % of the planets discovered . 
  i ended up pretty much in the middle of the left libertarian square . 
  no worries , 
  by watching way too much movies and tv-series ? 
  there would be a drastic drop in movies and tv-series so that would n't be great . . on the other hand i 'd probably get more stuff done .
