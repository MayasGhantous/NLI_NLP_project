  i 'd probably be able to get understood and understand some basic replies . 
  that being said my spanish skills do n't stretch further then being able to order a beer or ask for the toilet . 
  but i agree . 
  i do think that 1/5 is a bit high . 
  \\ - hi \\ - hallo \\ - how are you ? 
  \\ - fine thanks , and you ? 
  \\ - just fine , do you want to hang ? 
  \\ - sure . . \\* akward silence ensues \\*, 
  indeed . 
  you choose a language to study for about 4 years . 
  you can mostly choose between french , german or spanish . 
  french and spanish being the more popular choices . 
  then in high school you can either continue to learn the same language on a more advanced level or pick another language to learn during 2 years . 
  yay ... 
  welcome to the party . 
  yeah , that one worked just fine, 
  that link was not available for me either . 
  crazy frog - [ axel f ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k85mrpqvmbe ) ^ ^ thanks ^ ^ for ^ ^ dredging ^ ^ this ^ ^ thing ^ ^ up ^ ^ again . . -_-,

  interesting . 
  does this mean that ministers have to take some kind of obligatory course in programming so they are able to reprogram highly advanced robot cars ? 
  no coverage at all or close to it from what i have seen . 
  haha . . just awesome !, 
  comment of the year ^ ^ unless . . ^ ^ you ^ ^ know ^ ^ a ^ ^ better ^ ^ comment ^ ^ comes ^ ^ along . 
  nope =p, 
  oh god . . what a cockup = s, 
  or perhaps we are looking at the ikea from north to south ? 
  right = / = east , 
  what !, 
  they did . . dammit . . where is the launch key !, 
  oh well . . over to [ plan b ] ( http://i.imgur.com/9whoinh.jpg ), 
   neither of us has a lot of control over the fate of our nations . . pff . . what are you talking about ? 
  i am ready to launch the whole swedish nuclear arsenal at a moment 's notice at all times . . 
  so you better be nice to me !, 
  just jumping in the video a little , after seeing the comment made by / u/tvjunky . 
  i am getting a some what anti germany vibe from that guy . 
  he say stuff like `` serbia , the leading little state within yugoslavia fought with the us in two world wars , they were our allies . 
  and we bombed them into defeat , because we allied our self with germany , under allot of pressure from germany . 
  who was our enemies in world war one and two . 
  witch they started , both those wars . 
  and they are going to start world war three in the same fashion . 
  that is what your bible say , that is what it says '' and then advertising a book named `` germany 's conquest of the balkans '' a few moments later . 
  ~ ~ do n't ~ ~ ~ ~ bother ~ ~ ~ ~ going ~ ~ ~ ~ in ~ ~ ~ ~ a ~ ~ ~ ~ gondola , ~ ~ ~ ~ it 's ~ ~ ~ ~ a ~ ~ ~ ~ freaking ~ ~ ~ ~ rip ~ ~ ~ ~ off ~ ~ sorry about that, 
  it is something similar in sweden . 
  are 20 % under the age of two ? 
  yepp , taking big steps forward -_-, 
   . . this year 's election turnout has actually been very good - better than what they had feared . 
  all thanks to that video encouraging young people to vote . 
  it was discussed when the program first aired on may 7 in [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/sweden/comments/24z9lp/tilltron_p%c3%a5_m%c3%a4nskligheten_%c3%a5terst%c3%a4lld_tack_vare/ ) post . 
  although it 's probably mostly downvoted because of the obnoxious desync between what is actually said and the english subtitle . 
  i really like the videos from the esa , but then again i am interested in these sort of things . 
  and you still did n't give us a single point in this years esc . . traitors !, 
  well that 's a pretty bleak future . 
  i dug up [ the actual . gif ] ( http://thepiratebay.se/static/img/ppse.gif ) , for those who are interested . 
  i could buy that story . 
  hmm . . well , there is no paywall on pc . 
  ( or at least for me ), 
  hu . . but i could read it just fine . . 
  so it 's basically fact . 
  dammit . . sweden did n't make the top ten . . = /, 
  is . . this . . the end ? 
  a fox news article in / europe , hell must have frozen over . . 
  cool visualisation . 
  england sure like to tweet a lot . . 
  oh god . . this video pisses me off to no end !, 
  ok , to sum it up . 
  greece is building a jeep sized , automatons vehicle with super powerful laser backed by the uae . 
  i think i got it right ? 
   . . wondering if i 'd ever hear a gunshot in the city and how it actually would sound . . 
  i live like less then 100 m from the previous shootings that took place outside the student pub hg . 
  even though i know that i was awake when it happened i ca n't say that i heard anything outside the ordinary . 
  but then again i might have had my headphones on . 
  indeed . 
  you would get the same results by creating a post asking the same thing and then just watch the replies . 
  that 's funny that sweden only has 37 % in that survey . 
  a company named inizio recently conducted a similar survey by the request of the newspaper aftonbladet . 
  they had about 2500 replies and the data showed how many that would be expected to vote in the upcoming election . 
  it showed something like close to 48 % were expected to cast their vote and the lowest participation rate were among the young people born in the 90s with about 40 % . 
  but then again being interested and actually going out and vote might be different things . 
  [ source in swedish . . sry ] ( http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article18847026.ab ), 
  does he bring gifts ? 
  so . . what 's up whit this then ? 
  well . . you ca n't interfere with the esc - scandinavian tour . 
  next year it will be held in norway according to the schedule i am looking at . 
  me neither . 
  [ this ] ( http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/danderyd_ ( kommundel \\ ) ) is what the wiki say . . ( sorry no english ), 
   i auditioned for a part in that movie the first or the second one ? 
  i had a hard time reading that as well . . at first . . 
  that sounds about right . 
   polandballizing is that the official term ? 
  oh man , i ca n't imagine the uproar that kind of `` voting '' would cause here in sweden o.o, 
  touch\u00e9, 
  is that a compliment ? 
  i truly do n't know . 
  every one i know do celebrate easter in one way or another ( mostly because it 's a national holiday ) . 
  but that does n't mean that there is n't some one that does n't celebrate it . 
  so why would i exclude them from having a nice weekend and being able to write about what they are up to as well ? 
  e : sorry if i came across a bit dickish . 
  just reading your comment in a hurry before dinner i thoght you were questioning the initial post , but after thinking it over it might not have been your intention . 
  if there are any one out there that does n't celebrate easter , it would be interesting to hear the reason surrounding that .
