  sounds like fun ( not really ) , is it ? 
  how does your easter egg hunt work ? 
  we have these decorated , autriche egg sized , paper eggs filled with candy that then are hidden some where . 
  then the children go out looking for clues that lead to the eggs . 
  if you can call it relaxing . 
  i am hiding in the outhouse right now to get away from the kindergarden inside the main house . 
  you must have a nice time , and you better enjoy it !, 
  yeah . . you really see the flaws in thees kind of things when you got a rudimentary understanding of orbital mechanics . 
  i can no longer enjoy many of my sci-fi movies as i used to . 
  dam you ksp !, 
  not really , it 's more like confirming already existing suspicions . 
  so i watch bbc world news some times and recently they have covered the [ pistorius trail ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-27018395 ) quite a lot . 
  the thing is i 'm not sure why this has gotten so much coverage as it has . 
  do you know why ? 
  i would n't really recommend drinking the water though . . 
  out of 49870 people seeking asylum in sweden during 2013 , 24498 was granted ( ~ 49 % ) . 
  of these 13158 came from syria ( 11394 granted ~ 87 % ) .

  well yeah , i agree . 
  just thought it some what peculiar since this is not the usual kind of content you see here . 
  not to sure what this has to do with europe , but i do like witcher , 
  and here i thought i was in / r/swarje /, 
  yepp , that 's the story so far, 
  speak for yourself . 
  although asking some one how often they exercise is kinda open to interpretation . 
  you could take a walk once a month and claim that you exercise regularly .

  well . . we are supposed to learn how to write cursive in school , but i have never been very good at it . 
   i 'm convinced handwriting is the longest running joke in history . 
  when my father is writing it looks like an ekg from a patient with arrhythmia . 
  i would n't say that [ my handwriting ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tk3r9cz.jpg ) is much better . 
  thank god for computers , 
  scandinavia !, 
  1 in twisting statistics to our favour since forever , 
  well . . 
  i rather liked it -_-, 
  you know what would come next if we did , do n't you ? 
  ok , thanks for the information , 
  are there any statistics on how much other european nations contribute to this fund ? 
  i know right !, 
  and you do n't even have to learn how to ice-skate , 
   tastes like crap . . 
  it taste like yoghurt but with a somewhat thicker texture . 
  at least the skyr i ate when visiting iceland tasted like that . 
  you do n't need an expert to know that . 
  glad nordens dag , 
  it 's somewhat hard to comment on this since i always do my best to ignore the swedish subtitles . 
  but i ` de say that if the person making the subtitle is not completely incompetent , the jokes often translate pretty well ( bedsides for some cultural differences that is ) . 
  poland can still not in to space . 
  well . . 
  i would n't count on their [ navigational skills ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_submarine_s-363 ) , 
  well . . we just have to trick the finns to join nato some how . 
  then we will have a nice wall of nato members protecting us from the big bad russians . 
  do n't see why latin would be more preferable over english . 
  why would we start learning an outdated language that is rarely spoken by anyone . 
  especially when english already is taught world wide as a first or second language . 
  then you could visit the bank and the beach at the same time , 
  that pore farmer that suddenly gets a fence , a minefield , and not so pleasant troops to deal with . 
  wonder if they get hazard pay . . 
  he was one of the best , most prominent reporters this last decade . 
  a well known voice has been silenced , and it will surely be missed . 
  well . . as you can see on that pie chart nuclear ( the blue part ) makes up something like 38 % , while hydro power makes up 48 % , and wind power 4 % . 
  48 + 4 = 52 % so i would say that it 's accurate ( at least for sweden ) . 
   21\u00ba c yesterday . 
  are n't you jealous rest of europe ? 
  not really . 
  10 - 15 \u00bac is just right when not on vacation imo, 
  [ i will just leave this here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/1u8fy6/someone_tell_me_if_this_is_legit_light_your_water/ ), 
   is it really easier to get gas from iran to asia than to europe ? 
  well . . technically iran is in asia . . so yes ? 
  but on a serious note , i think selling to europe would probably be easiest due to existing pipelines through turkey . 
  but / u/cai _ e makes some good points as well . 
  i must be the only one that does n't really like the ` one kilo of flour ' sketch . 
  although they have done some other stuff that i do like . 
   [ here is a good yt channel that does some fun stuff ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wezkioa6-fe ) , there is english caption so you just have to turn it on .

  just love it < 3, 
   sweden 's mens hockey team is in the final against canada - playing in 1 hour . 
  the video is down, 
  it 's really fun to see how other countries view your own country ( area ) . 
  or at least that 's what i think . 
  many like it , i do n't . 
  he did move at the end . 
  but he is certainly in need of medical attention asap . . 
  it figures . 
  i really need to take a trip out east . 
  the furthest east i have been in europe is pretty much the northern tip of gotland . 
  hmm . . they look kinda tasty . 
  but the again most things placed on a grill look tasty . 
  some do some do n't . 
  i visited a place in croatia last summer and they took about 15 $ / 30 minutes . 
  compared to the roaming charge witch was at 120 sek ( ~ 13.5 $ ) / mb . 
  granted this was just days before they officially joined the eu so it might have changed by now ? 
  in the rest of the countries i visited that summer ( italy , slovenia , austria , and others ) the price was the same 7.73 sek ( 0.87 $ ) / mb, 
  how powerful of a bomb are we talking about ? 
  a nuclear bomb can be anything between a few ton too several megaton of tnt,

  i am probably the wrong person to answer this since i really do n't know .
