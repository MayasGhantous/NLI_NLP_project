  hope a fellow swede can answer this question . 
  but i would suspect that there is some kind of local association in charge of hiring cable companies and letting different isp 's to access the cable . 
  not too sure how representative this is for sweden since the only experience i have had with this is in a student home but . . where i live now you only had to plug in the internet cable , start the computer and try opening the browser . 
  then you got redirected to a site where you choose what isp you want . 
  then just fill in some relevant information and you are ready to go . 
  i tend to watch allot of series from the us . 
  but i think that it 's mostly because they produce allot more shows in english then any one else . 
  but quantity does not necessarily mean quality ( many series are kinda shit ) . 
  the bbc does make some quality tv but i am kinda pissed that they do n't have any concept at all on how long a season should be . 
  for example `` sherlock '' one season = three episodes . 
  sure it 's an awesome show but come on , i do n't want to wait 6 - 24 month for the next three episodes . 
  that being said swedish television is ok , with a good mix of different shows . 
  i would describe it as bbc but with a smaller budget . 
  in the video it say `` mk '' , i am not sure what currency that is supposed to be . 
  yeah . 
  it 's pretty much treated as the swedish mastership in singing o.o, 
  an article in the local paper `` corren '' in link\u00f6ping claim that they get roughly 200 sek ( ~ 22 $ ) a day . 
  also it 's apparently common that people buy food for them . 
  [ article in swedish ] ( http://www.corren.se/ostergotland/linkoping/att-tigga-i-linkoping-ger-ungefar-200-kronor-per-dag-6390443-artikel.aspx ), 
  keep in mind that this was before all the athletes entered the arena , so the lower seats were probably reserved for them . 
  but then again the upper seats are far from full . . 
  joking aside . 
  they actually did that . . o.o hehe . . well , i do n't know why i expected anything less . . 
  yeah , you seem to be right . 
  after doing some digging i found [ this image ] ( http://i.imgur.com/i6gjcgy.png ) witch appears to be the original . 
  can we expect that agitators claiming that the ring did n't open will disappear one by one ? 
  or maybe they are already have . . no one knows . 
  well . . it 's a bit far to the ski slope in stockholm . 
  alliance - dota2, 
  maybe he/she lives in sk\u00e5ne . 
  many swedes jokingly say that it should belong to denmark ( as it once did ) , mostly because of accent , flat land , and close proximity to denmark . 
  some just want to watch the world burn . 
  this is a bit hard for me to say , but . . good job ^ ^ ^ danskj\u00e4vel, 
  it 's more disturbing that there is no snow imo . . 
  well , does n't that say something . . 
  that 's some shitty defence . 
  [ rogan ?

  are you looking for trouble or what ? 
  but both cities are really nice although stockholm is clearly the superior one ^ ^ obviously, 
  yay ... 
  we just need to discover fusion . 
  then this wo n't be a problem any more . 
  would be kinda bad otherwise . . 
  what i take from this is that we need to drink more coffee , 
  did ukraine actually get darker or is that just an illusion ? 
  was at least what my grandfather drove back in the days . 
  granted you do n't see many of them nowadays . 
   head of the farmer 's party was fired . 
  any specific reason why he/she was fired ? 
  ** also : ** sweden 's justice minister faced ridicule for posting a spoof article about marijuana-linked deaths on her facebook page along with comments about her zero-tolerance against drugs . 
  was kinda hard to miss . 
  / r/sweden kinda went all out with the jokes on this one . 
  as some one who know nothing about this subject and you should n't really listen to , i 'd say that france is the place to be . 
  they are at least famous for their food ( ? ) . 
  also what ever you choose to do , it 's a good idea to try to learn the language . 
  even though you probably would do just fine with just english , the amount of people that know english in france / italy is kinda low . 
  [ i know it 's from 2005 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:english_foreign_and_second_language_eu.jpg ) , so feel free to post an updated version . 
  edit : good luck what ever happens , 
  he , i never realized that it actually came from him misspelling `` kung '' . 
  have always thought it just was a random thing to say `` knug '' =p, 
  [ relevant ] ( http://satwcomic.com/coat-of-arms ), 
  dam that looks tasty . . 
  who does n't ? 
  well . . 
  i usually go on the car ferry trelleborg - rostock when travelling to the continent . 
  coffee < 3, 
  as the swedes we are we have statistics on pretty much everything . 
  but i think they allow asylum seekers from troubled countries ( such as syria ) or people in danger for their lives pretty much a card blanch ( or let them stay for some time and then put it up for review ) . 
  http://www.migrationsverket.se/english/about-the-migration-board/statistics.html i am on the phone right now so cant really view the data but the . pdf at the bottom of the page look like they are containing some useful information . 
  i were about to make a remark about how that would n't work because of the mild climate and lack of ice , but then i remembered that there is a bridge now , 
  filling up rockets with the water and sending them to mars . 
  two birds with one stone , 
  it will be interesting to see how this turns out in the end . 
  u/slyratchet apparently felt it necessary , so maybe ? 
  and all the screaming . . 
  the horrible screaming . . had to drown myself with schnapps . 
  perfectly harmless , said no movie ever . 
  we will reclaim all the land that was lost . . eh . . 
  i meant create a union . . damit . . 
  well . . you know us swedes , we are kinda boring = /, 
  i think they were building a road . 
  ha . . then i simply do n't care any more . 
  gl hf with the fee . 
  ( if true ), 
  funny as that sounds , you could just have a plastic pocket in the window and just switch the ` stickers ' for every new country , 
  is ** 8 of august 1993 ** more relevant maybe / s, 
  they really should have a cheaper options for people just passing through . 
  like 10 $ for one month or something . 
  i bet they will have the same system as in austria ( and other countries ) . 
  you buy a sticker at a gas station near the border and put it in the car window . 
  that i actually knew , although i 'm not all that sure about the circumstances . 
  i know there was a war and that it was pretty much a ffa , but not much else . 
  not really , no . 
  but i 'm trying to better myself , i promise . 
  til : bulgaria is europe 's texas, 
  oh god . . 
  i feel kinda ashamed to admit that i almost know next to nothing about the history ( even recent history apparently ) of eastern europe =( my first reaction to this was something like , `` hm . . revolution ehy . . 1989 !, 
  holy crap that 's recent ! '', 
  i better go and read some wiki pages in a corner now .
