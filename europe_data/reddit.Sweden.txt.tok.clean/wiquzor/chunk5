  we also need hats, 
  finally , christmas is here !, 
  you are on your way to the sauna then i guess . 
  do n't forget your bottles of koskenkorva . 
  [ they also makes uavs ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/saab_skeldar ), 
  imagine an exact replica of the milkyway for our 4x-games , 
  [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/s1ccf7p.jpg ) was posted over at / r/sweden with a headline that roughly is translated to `` to handle defeated has never been one the french strong side '' . 
  [ relevant maybe ? 
  well . . obviously they need to `` space proof '' it , just saying it would be cool with a live stream from space , aimed at earth 24/7 . 
  might get expensive and there is no real money in it , but still . 
  hmm . . now that you mention it , you are probably right . 
  he was one of those who got extra coverage from expressen . 
  they went to his private home with a camera and confronted him with what he had written on the site . 
  he tried to explain that , more people than he , had access to his account . 
  and claimed that a friend and/or daughter might had written some of the things they confronted him with . 
  expressen confronted other people as well but his confrontation gained most traction . 
  i am just waiting for the day some one puts one of those micro satellites with hd-camera ( s ) ( alternatively mounting some cameras to the iss ) in to orbit and are able to stream live footage to some public site . 
  if this already is a thing , please provide a link , 
  i bet much has to do with a long history with spaceflight on the us side and that europe was divided by the wall up till 1989 . 
  at this point us was done with the apollo mission long ago ( 1975 ) and the space race was over . 
  the money is probably better spent on infrastructure and development . 
  even though i really like the idea of a big space program like back in the golden days . 
  i 'm just glad that some one is doing the science that has to be done , 
  i 'd say go straight for the space elevator instead . 
  finally a currency i understand =p edit : well . . we do n't have it , but close enough, 
  hmm . . 
  i like the look of those borders , 
  they ca n't get 30 % off on something they do n't receive . 
  let 's just call it 100 % off on gas prices . 
  hmm . . 
  i ended up just playing the tetris , without really caring about the new bank note , and getting really disappointed when the different `` stages '' end . 
  to me dutch sound something like 40 % german , 40 % danish and 20 % i 'm not to sure about . 
   we have the best in the world ( norwegians ) assisting us in our goals . 
  be careful with the norwegians . 
  if they find something they might declare independence and take it all for them self . 
  you could try selling it to a mafioso , not saying it would be easy , but still . 
  hmm . . weaponized lego , well played . 
  that sure is a huge amount of lego, 
  salam alaikum dear friend . 
  i would say improved , insha'allah . 
  have you even tasted kebab ? 
  he almost have the same blank stare as [ this guy ] ( http://www.chris-gaynor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/scarface-wallpaper_52027_2470.jpg ), 
  that 's just silly, 
  hmm . . 
  i better stay `` neutral '', 
  i would n't want to drink beer that 's diluted with seawater from the storm that passed this weekend . 
  but what if it 's true =p, 
  i know , i know . 
  but it 's hard when this is pretty much the only kind of news that makes it over the water  edit : but i do n't feel like sweden is much better then denmark in this regard with sd ( swedish democrats ) on the rise . . = /, 
  we have pretty much the same joke in sweden . 
  in this particular joke it 's usually a russian , a german and `` bellman '' . 
  bellman is a [ famous swedish songwriter , composer ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carl_michael_bellman ) . 
  but more often then not bellman is swapped out for a norwegian . 
  but you do make it easy for the media . 
  the most recent example was the parents that did n't want to send their children to a school in malm\u00f6 for a few day as an exchange program thingy . 
  the parents were worried about how dangerous malm\u00f6 is , especially roseng\u00e5rd ( a part of malm\u00f6 with a high concentration of immigrants ) [ swedish article ] ( http://www.expressen.se/kvp/danska-foraldrar-radda-for-malmo/ ), 
  why are all the milk cartridges in the norwegian store open ? 
  it say `` open here '' on them . 
  well apparently you still ca n't make butter out of that oil you have . 
  so enjoy your breakfast without butter !,

  reporter : what is . . what is the most practical or the funniest thing about internet ? 
  finnish guy 1 : yes . . it is actually . . yes it is . . yes it is . . have not soup in . .

  we are from finland, 
  so , while we are at it . 
  does anyone remember playing the [ moomin pc game ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvltnrexyks&amp;ab_channel=zxspectrumgames4 ) as a child ? 
  the u2 spy plane fly at ~ 21.3 km ( 70000 ft ) - [ view for reference ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jijroj2qwsc&amp;ab_channel=bbcworldwide ), 
  \\ - do you know what the norwegian who got shot in the forehead said ? 
  \\ - that was close to the eye . 
  \\ - why do the norwegians put contraceptive pills in their noses ? 
  \\ - they do n't want snotty kidds . 
  yikes . . these jokes did n't translate well = /, 
  hehe . . the norwegians did n't even make the list !, 
  guess you dont have to be innovative when you got oil ;p, 
  some simply got the ear for danish . 
  personally i understand spoken german much better then spoken danish . 
  after the latest trip to austria last spring me and my friends got a new favourite artist to terrorize parties with . 
  [ pandab\u00e4r ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwyuk1pxidw&amp;ab_channel=meinherzschl%c3%a4gtschlager ) [ das rote pherd ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yovvypuvdao&amp;ab_channel=martinmohr ) [ pommens mit senf ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgu-ffm6yf8 ) markus becker & mallorca cowboys is the shit =p, 
  well . . the general consensus , so far , over at r/sweden is that henrik arnstad embarrassed the whole of sweden by saying stuff like `` you are using the arabic numerals every day . 
  so every day you are promoting islam . 
  with your racist views of the world , you should start using roman numerals instead '' to the danish debater ( i am paraphrasing here ) . 
  [ link to youtube clip in swedish ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xww63bkipza&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;ab_channel=kennygren ), 
  the right answer to this question is `` yes and no '' . 
   for a european citizens ' initiative ( eci ) to be successful , it needs to reach 1,000,000 signatures overall and a minimum amount of signatures ( also refered to as `` country quorum '' ) in at least seven eu member states . 
  we have already surpassed these thresholds but we continue to gather signatures because we want to demonstrate how strong public opposition is to ttip and ceta . 
  yes . 
  our guide just called for the virgin princess , locked up in the tower , to let down her golden hair so that we could climb up . 
  the view was great !, 
  any moment now they will bring up the battle of poltava . 
  yeah , me neither . 
  have you ever seen a zombie on ice ? 
  well , i ` de think it 's more defendable then a school yard or something . 
  also it 's easier to spot approaching looters . 
  i love the idea of these types of islands . 
  they will be perfect in case of a zombie apocalypse , 
   the most boring of boring state institutions . 
  what !, 
  who does n't love statistics ? 
   `` sexualbrott '' in swedish law usage also include the purchase of sexual services .
