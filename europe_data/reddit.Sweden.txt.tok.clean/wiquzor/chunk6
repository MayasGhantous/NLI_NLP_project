  i wonder if these are included in numbers of the graph . 
  yes , `` sexualbrot '' is pretty much everything from flashing to rape . 
  according to [ `` nationella trygghetsunders\u00f6kningen 2014 '' ] ( https://www.bra.se/bra/brott-och-statistik/valdtakt-och-sexualbrott.html ) ( sorry , in swedish ) there was 20300 cases of `` sexualbrott '' reported , from which 6700 are rape cases ( in 2014 ) . 
  i have now checked the programs that was on `` barnkanalen '' yesterday at around 20 ish and could n't really find any cartoon matching your description . 
  from what i could gather the only program talking about the issue was `` lilla aktuellt '' ( a short news program for a younger audience ) that was aired at 19:15 and again at 20:55 . but there was no cartoon in that program . 
  what time was it when you saw it ? 
  yeah . 
  i realized it was wrong when i actually read through what i had written . 
  why is that ? 
  this is as exciting , or even more , than when they ~ ~ was ~ ~ were building the lhc , 
  i do n't think it 's very commonly used in sweden . 
  i usually eat peanut butter when on pancakes together with raspberry jam , but i rarely eat pancakes so . . 
  i tried to find another source on this , instead of the swedish wiki page , but failed . 
  apparently it 's estimated ( in 2008 ) to cost about 1.5 - 2 billion sek ( ~ 158 - 209 million euro ) to build 10 km of a double tracked tunnel in sweden . 
  i am guessing that it 's the number for solid rock rather then porous rock / mud mixture . 
  pfft . . that 's nothing !, 
  we have been building [ hallands\u00e5s tunneln ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hallands%c3%a5s_tunnel ) since 1993 . 
  it 's a architectural marvel , 18 years behind schedule and 11 times over budget , saving you about 10 minutes on your trip . 
  would n't that logic apply to most meats from the sea ? 
  sure there are fish , shrimps , and mussel farms and such but most of the sea creatures are captured from their `` wild '' habitats . 
  hey , look here !, 
  cannadianjesus from germany gets it , 
  yeah , i realize that and do n't say that you are wrong in any way . 
  i just got curious how big of a percentage of the population actually fall under the stated parameters , so i went and looked it up . 
   i do n't think sweden consists of 30 % immigrants . 
  well it does if you consider ** the wording ** in that specific graph . 
  it takes all `` foreign born '' , `` born in sweden with two foreign born parents '' , and `` born in sweden with one parent born in sweden and one foreign born parent '' and lump them together . 
  according to [ statistiska centralbyr\u00e5n ] ( http://www.statistikdatabasen.scb.se/pxweb/en/ssd/start__be__be0101__be0101q/utlsvbakgtot/?rxid=c2d01aa8-7887-4e93-9239-1f65dd28c774 ) ( specify region , category , and year ) it 's about 2.8 million ppl in 2014 . 
  compared to the category `` born in sweden with two parents born in sweden '' it 's about 28 % of the total . 
  why not just call it the eastern provinces of sweden and call it a day . 
  we battle regularly in the esc every year . 
  indeed , but is that reason to delete the thread/comments ? 
  would n't the best way for people to find information on this event to go to this thread and read updated comments like yours ? 
  i just want to interject and say that the soldier that was attacked might just have been on his way too or from work since there is a fairly large military `` base '' located in that area . 
  [ julmust ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/julmust ) and hmm . . [ pickled herring ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pickled_herring ) perhaps . 
  [ i like this one the best ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj-tutqgqb0 ), 
  and still you only have one guy maintaining the dino parks systems, 
  hope they have ample security for every eventuality . 
  this behaviour also exist in stockholm . 
  however it does n't seem to exist in the rest of the country . 
  i am guessing that it 's because of the subways . 
  ~ ~ according to swedish news two are dead and the last on is in operation atm . ~ ~ edit : i should check the article before writing, 
  if he did n't have any commercial areas were did the cims get their food . 
  imagine living in a city without any sort of shops ( works a while in the game since starvation is n't simulated i think ) . 
  kinda ashamed to admit that i only got 8/19 = /, 
  understood . 
  i still have some questions since most people wear shoes and technicaly do n't touch the ground , unless they are on the beach or something like that . 
  but i 'll let it slide  * sweden * norway * denmark * iceland * germany * austria * lichtenstein * switzerland * great britain * czech republic * slovenia * croatia * italy * san marino * turky * france ( r\u00e9union ), 
  does passing through a countries airspace count ? 
  what is the definition of `` have been to '' in this case ? 
  this sounds like the setup of an agatha christie book . 
  well . . me and my mother got in to a ski lift with a british lady and one of her friends when skiing in austria . 
  she started blabbering on about how how hard it is to rais children and how dissapointed she was at her children . 
  my mother ( who is a kindergarden teacher ) and i just looked at eachother and tried to not laugh when she clearly described some completely normal stuff that usually happens when raising kids and which she thought was so very , very hard things to deal with . 
  she didnt stop talking once during the maybe 6 - 9 minute ride . 
  only if it 's about all black people and not one specific black person . . or . . wait . . is that right ? 
  i do n't see how the norwrigians can be a joyless people . 
  the joke in sweden is that even if a norwrigian is depressed he/she still sound happy when talking . 
  are you sure you 're not talking about yourself ? 
  now the news site that originally reported on the news are reporting that it 's probably the submarine that sank in 1916 . so it 's probably it . 
  i think people are getting a bit irritated on the police because they do not seem to do anything about it . 
  well . . recently they have detonated [ some grenades ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/20150724/third-grenade-attack-in-a-week-rocks-malm ) . 
  indeed . 
  it would make much sense to build a railway tunnel between helsingborg - helsing\u00f6r to alleviate the pressure on the \u00f6resund bridge from cargo transports .

  for fuck sake it was hot today . 
  it was about ~ 30 !!, 
  hope it returns back down to 20 - 25 soon or i 'll have to move further north . 
  bara om ni delar med er av oljep\u00e4ngarna  * only if you share that oil money *, 
  indeed . 
  they are also easily rigged by people pushing their own agenda ( not saying that this one necessarily is rigged ), 
  i would say that it 's ok to arrive smething like 10 min before , or at most 30 min after the appointed time . 
  indeed ( 08 here ), 
  would n't next step be a road going finland  \u00c5land  sverige, 
  are you crazy . 
  you ca n't hold an election during the midsummer holiday !, 
  yeah i know how it sounds . 
  it was just something that was mentioned at the end of the news article that i linked . 
  the police do n't want to jump to conclusions since the preliminary investigation has yet to be completed . 
  according to [ gp ( g\u00f6teborgs posten ) ] ( http://www.gp.se/nyheter/goteborg/1.2745940-en-av-de-doda-ledande-person-inom-kriminellt-natverk ) the 32 year old man had previously been shoot at during `` conflicts '' in the same parts of the city and had previously been convicted for involvement in some gang related murders back in 2008 . 
  so one could ** speculate ** that this was either murder , or they had explosives in the car that accidentally went of . 
  edit : a thing that implies that it is n't a gang related deed is that most of the higher ups in the main rival gang is either in jail or in custody . 
  it was confirmed today that one of the persons killed was a known gang leader . 
  thanks for translating it to a real unit of mesurment . 
  if you have met some one multiple times , or are friends , it 's acceptable to give them a friendly hug . 
  in worst case small talk consist of words like `` hi '' , `` how are you '' , and `` good !, 
  you ? '', 
  we love them ?? 
  as it is now i think it 's pretty distracting , so it will require some more work . 
  i ` de suggest something like the layout over at / r/sweden . 
  but of course i 'd prefer that layout since i spend allot of time over there . 
  guess that sounded more fun in swedish then english ( fis = fart ) ^ ^ ^ or ^ ^ ^ perhaps ^ ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ tired ^ ^ ^ # 3:40 am, 
  guess our [ traditional instrument ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sfbcwvvubs ) is n't too bad then , 
  thanks . . but how do we convert them to krownies ? 
  i was right . 
  then i do n't have to remove this post =p, 
  you got five reasons not to be . 
  iceland < 3, 
  haha, 
  whoo !,
