  my god this is intense !, 
  greeeeen screeen !, 
  are you kidding !, 
  i am on the edge of my seat !, 
  indeed, 
  a real nail biter this one !, 
  thank you finland < 3, 
  i think they would just choose the runner up, 
  time to vote vote vote . . ^ ^ ^ ^ prefferably ^ ^ ^ ^ for ^ ^ ^ ^ sweden, 
  nothing wrong with that , 
  what are you talking about ? 
  they do n't have any animated people that can be your friend . 
  i think [ blackadder back and forth ] ( https://youtu.be/8vefabsjwec?t=27m10s ) described this situation pretty well =p, 
  i think i 'll join you . 
  i do n't think they had phones back then . 
  i doubt there were any scots in moscow . 
  i might have miss read some things here ... 
  ehum !, 
  nothing to see here . 
  prepare for utter disappointment if you click on that =(, 
  we also have wet leaves on the tracks during autumn and signal failure and / or railroad switch failure all year round . 
  hehe . . this is sweddit level of material , 
  when we have seeded five or more planets and/or moons . 
  yeah , and the smokers always seem to be standing upwind when you are waiting for the train = /, 
  it 's just a matter of perspective , 
  what the actual fuck !, 
  i do n't see the continent moving any time soon . 
  uniting the world since the 16th century, 
  more like the nordic countries 101, 
  for school children , yes . 
  but for us working folks it 's just an extra long weekend . 
  i am sure the knowlage is som where in the back of my head . 
  but all i really care about is that we get friday and monday off and have a weekend that you can spend together with the family , 
   how are you going to spend it ? 
  well . . was n't easter yesterday ? 
  not that i really know but , the egg hunt was . 
   has anyone here met creationists in real life ? 
  honestly . 
  yes , yes i have . 
  and we have had some real `` interesting '' conversations ... 
  if they can do `` sharknado '' they can do `` the terror owl '', 
  brought down ? 
  last i heard he still intended to stay on his post . 
  we make up for it by being about twice as many , 
   our country has the memory of a clownfish ... and here i thought it was blue tang fishes that had short memory . 
  i think it 's ok , although if i had to change one thing it would be to make it easier to distinguish between already visited links and new ones . 
  at this point it 's a bit hard imo . 
  yes , send them all back because of the action of a few . 
  i randomly dropped in to frankfurt just to find [ this !, 
  ] ( https://www.google.se/maps/@50.1103089,8.6822058,3a,75y,98.76h,69.48t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1s-bs3v4bf870i%2fvgl3qbmklti%2faaaaaaaadz8%2fmcbhomyu76y!2e4!3e11!6s%2f%2flh6.googleusercontent.com%2f-bs3v4bf870i%2fvgl3qbmklti%2faaaaaaaadz8%2fmcbhomyu76y%2fw203-h101-n-k-no%2f!7i7168!8i3584 ), 
  wow . . it feels like i am sitting in a time traveling delorean in the late 90 's, 
  ahh . . the renowned citizenship timeout `` error '' . 
  what !, 
  there is no such thing as a organized begging . . or is there . . naa , impossible . . yes there is . . 
  yes !!!, 
  ( sums up the coverage over the last years about this issue ), 
   which direction ? 
  in the direction of sweden ofc . . how else would you get to [ norway ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hell,_norway ), 
  so ... when will the 600k survey take place ? 
  pfft . . 
  it 's just nato trying to scare us into joining / s, 
  just goes to show that every one have their own way of eating them . 
  i just had n't seen a variant that basically cream on bread . 
  personally i think the almond cream is the best part . 
   you do n't have to add any cardamom , either . 
  you can skip the almond cream , too . 
  wtf, 
  europe in 200 years ? 
  more like \u6b27\u6d32, 
  [ indeed . . ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juvgb3h8hyy&amp;ab_channel=smokesriker125 ), 
  [ stockholm ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6x-7j52smnq&amp;ab_channel=bj%c3%96rnhultmedia ), 
  speed 3 : the surfacing !, 
  and i pay ~ 20 $ / month for 100/100 = /, 
  really ? 
  it 's basically a kebab-roll with extra sauce and pommes, 
  well then . . see you again in 6.4 years , 
   . . so it became common to wave a white ( = french ) flag back then . 
  that one sure backfired on them , 
  so we do n't have any satellites in orbit around europa ? 
  that 's a shame since i think europa is one of the more interesting places in the solar system . 
   but seriously - bbc ? 
  this sketch is getting silly . 
  well . . 
  they are the baddies after all , 
  well . . that feeling when you return home , frozen to the core , and get to cover yourself with a warm quilt and drink something warm is pretty awesome . 
  good !, 
  better safe than sorry when it comes to danish subs , you never know what the danes are up to . 
  is the link safe for work ? 
   and europe had no part in that one , so ... yeah , i just meant that we probably would need a simillar level of dedication , from every one involved , to that in the us during the apollo missions . 
  that would intail willingness to spend a lot more money and increased cooperation between esa members . 
  personally i do n't think a moonbase is possible ( at this point in time ) without the cooperation between all the space fairing organisations simillar to how the iss was built . 
  and even so , 2030 is very optimistic/unrealistic . 
  2030 would probably be possible if every one got their ass in gear and worked on this project with the same dedication as the moonlandings . . but as things are now it 's very optimistic . 
  i saw it for the first time last night , but i guess it 's a thing in sweden as well . 
  yepp , 9:00 pm gmt tomorrow, 
  we are talking about the 1/3 that actually matters / s, 
  norway / sweden got plenty of wind for every one atm . . you will just have to go and get some , 
  god jul !, 
  celebrated yesterday so today we will take it slow and eat leftovers ,
