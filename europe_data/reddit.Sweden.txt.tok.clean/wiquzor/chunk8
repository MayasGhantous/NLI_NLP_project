  do n't worry about it . 
  i know i can mess up words some times , and it 's especially obvious when i do n't have a proper spelling program to fall back on . 
  any ways . . happy holidays ;-), 
  mild dyslexia and the phone 's auto correct will do it, 
  how do you sink a danish submarine ? 
  you knock on the hatch and they will open and say `` we are not as stupid as the norwrigians '', 
  i got a similar one . . 
  there was a swede , dane , and norwrigian stranded on a deserted island . 
  one day they found a magic lamp on the beach . 
  a genie appears and say that he will grant them one whish each . 
  the swede whish to be home in sweden and dissappear in mid air . 
  then the dane whish to be home in denmark , he also dissappear from the island . 
  the genie turn to the norwrigian and ask what he wishes for . 
  the norwrigian looks around and then say `` it 's so lonley here . 
  i whish my two friends could be here '' . 
  `` as you whish '' says the genie and * poof * both the swede and the dane appears , back on the deserted island , and then the genie dissappear . 
  well . . imagine if that shit storm would have gone off = /, 
  whoops . . my bad then = /, 
  well . . technically lucia is not a holiday ... 
  i would suggest . . 1 . christmas 2 . midsummer 3 . easter 4 . new year 5 . valborg mostly based on how many days each event usually take . 
  it 's pretty much a coin toss between christmas and midsummer for the number one spot . 
  easter got its own softdrink so it clearly grabs no 3 and new year is just a fun evening with good food / drinks together with friends . 
  valborg is jus an excuse to burn some twiggs snd get shitfaced . 
  worth noting ~ ~ ( and not mentioned in the article ) ~ ~ is that this only will affect the x2000 trains that usually go across the bridge . 
  i think i read some where that it 's about 5 departurs / day in either direction . 
  \u00d6resundst\u00e5g will still run trains over the bridge ( feel free to correct me if im wrong ) . 
  that sounds like a pain in the r 's =p, 
  http://vecka.nu the most useful one purpose site ever !, 
  well , that 's just because his plot armor is too strong . 
  the only thing that stops a bad guy with a sword is a good guy with a sword . 
  i ` de let my children go on that trip ( if i had any ) . 
  sure it 's easier to hitch a ride on a train going over the bridge than taking the boat . 
  but the biggest failure is the policies leading up to now and not the bridge it self . 
   huge costs what huge costs exactly ? 
  i guess season 4 is [ confirmed ] ( https://imgur.com/3ciquuq ) - [ / sweden thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/sweden/comments/3vbo64/sp%c3%a4nnande_nytt_avsnitt_av_bron/ ), 
  yes , but that is only half of the story . 
  * picks up phone * hello , mr putin . 
  we got the guy that shot down your jet plane so there are no need for any sanctions against us . 
  i would want to say midsummer more than any thing . 
  i know that it 's celebrated to some extent outside the nordic countries but here in sweden it pretty much rivals christmas in cultural importance . 
  then we have [ `` kr\u00e4ft skiva '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crayfish_party ) ( crayfish party ) that is pretty common as well , but there is no official holiday or anything for it . 
  i just made a rough sketch from memory , 
  the text saying that it 's '' . . a royalty free image that can be used for your personal , corporate or educational use '' is for me the funniest part . 
  [ yeah . . 
  well . . it kinda depends on what constitutes as a city in this case . 
  if you are talking [ judicially ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_cities_in_sweden ) we have none , but counting [ population density ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_urban_areas_in_sweden ) we have a few depending on the cutoff point . 
  did any one say submarine ?!, 
  \\* puts on tinfoil hat \\*, 
  i mostly watch shows made by bbc sherlock , dr who , qi , black mirror , luther and midsummer murders and so on and on . 
  sweden actually put out some really good shows now and again , bron/broen being perhaps one of the bigger ones with both a uk and us adaptations . 
  [ `` jordskott '' ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2309405/ ) - `` soil shot '' ( ? ), 
  is also a more recent series that has roughly the same feel to it as bron , but deals with supernatural creatures in a small rural town in sweden . 
  i have seen les revenants as many other also have mentioned in this thread and it was pretty good . 
  otherwise i mostly consume anime and series from the us . 
  fore those with some spare money lying around [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdormt0iric&amp;ab_channel=topgear ) could be an option , 
  please do n't let that happen = /, 
  it is ? 
  i thought it was kinda similar to [ vikings ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2306299/ ) from what i gathered from the trailers , which made me put it off . 
  [ i 'm giving it all she 's got !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt8cri9k4bo&amp;ab_channel=usefulresponses ), 
  that 's some legit music , 
  indeed . . these god dam swedes !, 
   we 've all been there it must be really hard to assemble a functioning suicide vest then . 
  i think he/she just made a joke, 
  all the nations on earth will have to band together to prevent this cattastrophe . . 
  if you are looking at cnn they often tend to exaggerate things before they really know . 
  bbc is reporting 40 deaths at the moment . 
  but it 's still a horrible situation = /, 
  it sure do n't feel promising does it = /, 
   they always typically locked too , something our nordic cousins do n't seem to be bothered with according to the dramas . 
  i usually lock the door when home alone or at night before going to bed . 
  how cute , 
  how is drinking coffee the italian way !!, 
  i am offended !!, 
  what kind of bat ? 
  fruit bat , vampire bat , or just a normal bat ? 
  nice summarize of the zones . 
  i live in the north-eastern part of v\u00e4stra g\u00f6taland so it might exists a better electricity plan for the area , but i am not sure if i can change plans since i live in an apartment . 
  i 'll have to check . . 
  i got my first ever electric bill last month , and according to that my electricity was 34 % nuclear , 13 % renewable , and 53 % from fossil fuel . 
  i were kinda surprised by those numbers since you often see this type of article that op have posted . 
  i guess there still is some work to be done . 
  well then maybe we could hire the `` eu-migrants '' from romania to construct these shantytowns , they seem pretty good at it . 
  then they wo n't have to beg for money any more and we will have enough housing for the other migrants / refugees that end up in sweden . 
  two birds with one stone , 
  not to mention launch pad for space rockets , 
  i do . . but pretty much only once a year . 
  the experience is better than watching a movie on the computer , but is clearly not worth paying the 13 $ it cost . 
  mounty mcmountaintop, 
  what an exceptionally bad idea , but with all going on lately it will probably happen -_-, 
  it 's the same here according to the long term report at yr.no it will be 5 - 8 + c on wednesday next week :'(, 
  how come you do n't really see the bigger car companies make headway with electric cars the same way as tesla ? 
  would n't it be easier for an already large and established company to start making electric vehicles than starting one from scratch ? 
  say the guy with the flag of scania / s, 
  what are you talking about ? 
  during the 1600 the swedish empire was on top of its might . 
  and i think estonia at the time would be considered nordic as well . 
  wow . . 
  i have n't heard an austrian cellar joke for quite a while , until now . . 
  only if we can assemble it ourselves,
