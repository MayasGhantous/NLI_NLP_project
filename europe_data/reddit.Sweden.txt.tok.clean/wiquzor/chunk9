   germany 's merkel ... does n't that sugest that there are more of them somewhere ? 
  that 's why they 'd put the real plans in the briefcase the next time . 
  i think western sweden is more accurate . 
  right . . 
  i think we all know who 's truly behind these latest [ snow attacks .

  interesting read . 
  i find it fascinating they considered using 213 , 1.5 megaton fission-explosions as a digging tool for the purposed canal . 
  i do think that i understand what you are getting at , but it was not all that obvious from how you stated your [ original comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5a5n9c/world_war_ii_justified_by_former_german_soldiers/d9dxccb/ ) . 
   i would say that american army killed less civilians throughout entire 20th century than germans in that one week in warsaw not sure if time works the same for you as for the rest of us ...

  now you are just trying too hard . 
  well earthquakes often follow each other . 
  looking at a list of [ larger earthquakes in italy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_earthquakes_in_italy ) you can clearly see that the larger ones are somewhat grouped together . 
  well . . the election is n't for another two weeks , so what is there to discuss before we know the outcome ? 
  we europeans ca n't do anything about it anyway . 
  it looks to me like the snow is pretty wet . 
  ( the worst kind of snow imo ), 
  city in the winter , countryside in the summer . 
   only 5 per cent of millennials were unfamiliar with the former us president - his decision to invade iraq took place within recent memory - while 18 per cent were unfamiliar with stalin . 
  sigh . . = /, 
  i think it 's just the randomness of the weather and how the way anecdotal evidence work , 
  edit : `` e '', 
  we usually get some snow in the middle of november that then melt and then come back at/after christmas . 
  but i can only really speak for the area around stockholm . 
  the greatest chance for snow is pretty much in january . 
  4:32 am - sweden reporting in edit : it 's raining . . have been all week -_-, 
  yeah , i thought it ran on the hopes and dreams of the russian people / s, 
  actually correct . . that image must be taken at sunrise due to the location of stockholm city hall ( the tower pretty much in the center of the image ) . 
  i 'd imagine that it 's taken from v\u00e4sterbron . 
   we typically get snowfall as early as middle november at times , typically late november . 
  that is pretty much what we get here as well . 
  and then in december the snow melt and there is about 50/50 chance of a white christmas . 
  the greatest chance for snow in sthlm is pretty much early january . 
  that step is only applicable when looking at villages after 2050, 
  i thought it had something to do with that they used to fight under a white flag , even though they were fairly successful . 
  true , but that does n't necessarily mean that they have low murder rates because of the death penalty . 
   in various parts of iceland ` s capital , street lights have been switched off from 10pm-11pm , on september 28th and . .  by jane leguardiajane leguardia sep 29 , 2016 , 11:03 am feels like every single time you read about things such as auroras or asteroid showers in the `` news '' it has already happened ...

  the three page comment is just below this comment at the moment, 
  26/8 ( the date the reindeers died ) = 3.25 if you then take 3.25 * 100 - 2 ( the millenia we are in ) = 323 also the numbers of dead reindeers . 
  i think not !, 
  that inception music sure gives the feeling of impending doom .

  look to the left of the image of the boat and compare the number of stones in the wall of the house . 
  then you 'll see that the water is in about chest level of the person standing near the stop-lights .

  you might get a better response over at / r/askeurope as for swedish music you could go with some swedish versions of [ abba ] ( https://play.spotify.com/user/uisgebeatha/playlist/6iecajgphaqzvnzorh1ckf ) songs , but ignoring that for a second .
