yeah , i know it 's a pastery , but ... 
  firefox and qwant . 
  i like firefox because it 's open source and mozilla cares about the open web . 
  i like qwant because they care about privacy and unlike duckduckgo and startpage use their own algorithm . 
  i do n't want to even indirectly support google by using their algorithm . 
  not much with day to day things . 
  but my downstairs neighbour must be a bloody carpenter or something , i hear powerdrills and hammers more often than reasonable . 
  do n't know why he does all that in his flat though . 
  about half . 
  in favour , but let 's keep the eu name . 
  * i * however live on this big island in the baltic sea , and hope this war does n't happen . 
  first trimester , always legal . 
  i just use my own accent . 
  which a bit of a mix , i think . 
  i use the hard r 's from ae , and the flap t ( the one that sounds like a d ) . 
  i tend to use the harder a from be , though , in words like `` master '' , `` faster '' , or `` ca n't '' . 
  i tried copying american accents in my teens , but now i do n't care , and wan na do my own thing . 
  bought it second-hand for a really good price . 
  i 'm not really in a financial position to choose brands . 
  first season was great !, 
  if the skin is easily breakable using teeth , no . 
  otherwise get that stuff out of here , i 'm trying to eat . 
  the live action film asterix and obelix mission cleopatra must be my favourite comedy ever . 
  shorter than me , is all i know . 
  180 sounds about right . 
  hammering the nato drum way too much . 
  sweden 's liberal party . 
  turkey i 'd say . 
  i have n't been around much . 
  did you see the kent farm ? 
  i know a few lines of the first verse , and then the chorus ( or i think it 's the chorus ) . 
  been a long while since i 've heard it now . 
  [ eyeem ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.baseapp.eyeem ) is kind of like instagram , except the photos are good . 
  based in germany . 
  it 's trendy in sweden ( again ) . 
  i ca n't grow one though . 
  edit : please no `` lol muslim beards '' jokes . 
  considering we barely keep up with norway economically , and finland militarily , are we even the `` greatest '' nordic anymore ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  closest thing would be the sami up north , i guess . 
  there are a few that live pretty old school , i believe . 
  maybe not as old school as the amish , though . 
  i do n't use cash often here in sweden , but when i do the cashier react like they have n't used a cashing machine in months . 
  side note : this is why i do n't really get why the gypsies even bothered coming up here to beg outside supermarkets ; * we do n't have any spare change , people !, 
  * editing to add : i do n't want cash to go away though . 
  there needs to be universal ways to pay for stuff anonymously . 
  economic left/right : -1.25 social libertarian/authoritarian : -6.15 justa bit left of centre , pretty far down . 
  green quadrant . 
  i like the straight-up salted ones the best . 
  i want it to taste like chips . 
  at least my old cat could open doors himself . 
  though it took a few attempts , so i 'd still wake up from him jumping up and slamming down the door handle . 
  looks like the kind of cat other cats go to for advice and wisdom . 
  depends . 
  i get really bad second-hand embarrassment from a swede with a heavy accent , but those are dying out now when a new generation is stepping in . 
  i 'd have to say french , otherwise . 
  what site is that ? 
  does it have an app ? 
  edit : sorry , this is a joke about the digitalisation of our daily lives . 
  not common at all outside . 
  it 's common to see mini-deskflags on people 's office desks in schools though for some reason . 
  most say `` krona '' or `` klave '' like someone here already said , but i say `` this side '' and `` that side '' because i ca n't remember which is which . 
  i do n't mind at all . 
  yup . 
  manual all the time . 
  the only time i appreciate automatics is when i do stuff i should n't be doing while driving anyway , like eating . 
  hey , thanks mate !, 
  pretty much non-existent . 
  not sure how we do it . 
  are you sure diesel is the ` typical ' car ? 
  i would 've said petrol is more common . 
  [ i was making a `` firefly '' reference . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znxfrgql5dc ), 
  we shall call it ... `` this land '' !, 
  mine once left her phone on , so i got a 15-minute voice mail with her ranting to herself while going through the kitchen about how i never answer the phone or come over . 
  it was heartbreaking . 
  talking to most of you guys . 
  older people seem to think we are all so different , but a lot of you are more similar to me than the old people here . 
  no , but my grandmother is n't convinced . 
  low-cost . 
  i only need a chair . 
  though i 've never flown longer flights than ca 5 hours . 
  but i do n't think the low-cost ones even fly inter-continental . 
  i do n't know . 
  maybe change the cross to something else . 
  something from norse mythology . 
  but it 's not really a big deal . 
  i 'm not sure , our `` christians '' are so watered down that they are n't really christians anymore . 
  if someone would * actually * believe in creationism or something like that , they would n't be taken seriously . 
  i thought the northern irish flag was the white one with a big red x ( diagonal cross ) . 
  the part of the union flag that is n't english or scottish . 
  bacon & mac-n-cheese chips : http://brentreser.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/cheddar-bacon-mac-and-cheese-chips.jpg, 
  i do n't really have a word that i ca n't pronounce correctly . 
  but i have a few that i 've gotten the habit of saying wrong due to wrong assumptions from reading them . 
  * danish * i say `` dane '' correctly , but i tend to say `` danish '' as `` dan-ish '' ( like the name dan ) instead of `` dane-ish '' . 
  * iron * recently found out that it is said like `` fire '' but without the f and adding an n. * bomb * you only say one b in bomb , i keep forgetting this . 
  and one that i mispronounce on purpose because the true word is dumb : `` kilometre '' . 
  i say it just like `` kilogram '' , and not like i get a stick rammed up my butt mid-sentence like others do . 
  typical for swedes as well , and the other `` th '' and also `` ph '' become f. though native speakers have mostly abondoned `` ph '' as well . 
  also it took a while for me to notice that z is not pronounced the same as s in english .
