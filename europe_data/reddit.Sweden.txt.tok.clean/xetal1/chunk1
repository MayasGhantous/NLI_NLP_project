that 's because in most other ways they fuck with you it 's not as tangible . 
  any restriction like this with the internet is immediately felt and seen by many , especially when it comes so sudden . 
  thank you , looks like i stand corrected . 
  do you have any source whatsoever for any of this ? 
   in the middle of a desert not even close , it 's just by the [ coastline ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/localizaci%c3%b3n_de_melilla.svg/690px-localizaci%c3%b3n_de_melilla.svg.png ) , in a small heavily populated area . 
  what makes that golf course more meaningless than any other ? 
  well of course , all i 'm saying is that iceland was worse than most . 
  actually they have great genetics , because of the massive selectiveness that comes of first getting to a far away island in small boats and then staying alive on such an island for 1000 years . 
  no easy way , and only the strongest survived . 
  yeah . 
  however , they 're not completely out of the picture . 
  they won municipal seats in lots of cities . 
  not austria and switzerland ? 
  these people live in their own bubble out of touch with reality and appeared to be 100 % convinced they would get in , which i guess makes the loss quite a bit harder for them . 
  sv ** p ** is the nazi party . 
  svd is a major newspaper . 
  well i do notice a pattern ; - written swedish - easy - spoken swedish - easy - written norwegian - easy - spoken norwegian - easy - written danish - easy - spoken danish - wtf sometimes i wonder if it all is an elaborate practical joke to mess with us :(, 
  i hear both socialist utopia and islamic overtake too often . 
  especially americans tend to have that first view and go all out about it . 
  i just think of it as a pretty good country , equal to the other nordic and the german ones . 
  source ? 
  sweden is a bit wrong . 
  with some exceptions , they 're usually 9 . 
  it really has a nostalgia angle , though . 
  yeah sure , but it 's easier to choose between good and bad than between two goods . 
  seems like it would make more sense to make the buses you try to phase out seem evil rather than raise sympathy for them . 
  i think it 's more wo n't than ca n't . 
  with such a price difference a small one actually is worth buying . 
  here a small one is 2,20 and a big one 2,50, 
  as a reference , sweden had 93 000 , giving us a higher per capita than any other european country . 
  everybody , according to russia . 
  that sounds more like unproportionally forcing towards the middle :p, 
  that brings up the question though ; should clueless people really be forced to vote ? 
   english ( 150 million ) * right *, 
  indeed , it 's not a big number . 
  after all , it 's only like half the amount of syrians the usa has taken in . 
  bear in mind that eu does n't have any unified immigration policy , it 's all up to the countries . 
  some countries , sweden and germany for example , take in tons and tons of immigrants whilst other countries like spain , latvia or bulgaria give zero fucks . 
  let 's go back to sweden for a second . 
  in the case of syria we have taken in , ** 5000 ** times as many per capita as usa has . 
  everyone getting here is granted permanent residency , and the full-suite package of integration and welfare . 
  i 'd trade that for a handful of bhutanese every day . 
  [ syrians have been coming to sweden , after taking a detour to the states ] ( http://www.dn.se/nyheter/varlden/syriska-flyktingar-tar-vagen-via-usa-till-sverige/ ), 
  surely he gets it . 
  he is not stupid , it 's just that his ego and pride is bigger than the acceptance of a compromise . 
  territory under european reign ! = europe, 
  sahara desert is most certainly not in europe . 
  this . 
  it would be great if it showed not only news from all countries , but movies and entertainment from each , exposing people to the different languages and cultures . 
  that 's because the rest killed themselves already . 
  for now . 
  that is not an adequate comparison however , as we are only talking about one factor - the size of the car/network traffic . 
  in that case the billing should be of the size itself rather than arbitrary selected big cars . 
  all network traffic of the same size has exactly the same costs of maintenance and thus should be billed only for their size , not of their content . 
  restrictions would like mentioned would have to go to the root issue though . 
  in the case of the suv the inordinate effect would likely be because of some factor it shares with other types of cars , size or steering for example . 
  hence that property would be what should be regulated against and not suvs themselves . 
  in the same way , the root cause of streaming having inordinate effects on networks would be the data load , and then we 're back at square one again , are n't we ? 
   i never said that i was against regulation . 
  regulation of the internet is important . 
  regulation of isp ! = regulation of internet  you misunderstand car tax . 
  car tax has nothing to do with the usage of the car , it is levied on the type of the car . 
  it was an allegory . 
  and even in that , i did n't say anything about usage of the car but instead type ( as implied by ` bigger ' ) ...  it happens already with cars . 
  give me one example of arbitrary billing/restriction of cars based on market agreements . 
  and why should movie streaming be treated any different from other data of the same size ? 
   that 's not a free market . 
  a free market would be allowing isps to offer plans to people which exclude certain high usage sites and allowing people to opt for these plans if they choose . 
  did you even read what i wrote ? 
  free market is not the same thing as jungle of the law . 
  it has regulations for reasons . 
  for reasons of sustaining a market as free and competitive as possible . 
  the nature of internet infrastructure - just as with roads - renders it impossible to have an unregulated market on it , especially as these can intercept other markets - free markets - which are depending on that backbone , such as internet content providers . 
  also , how do you justify excluding arbitrary content ? 
  how would that not kill the free market sphere that internet is ? 
   people with bigger cars already have to pay more tax . 
  i never hear anyone complaining about that . 
  it makes perfect sense . 
  why should people with smaller cars be forced to subsidize those with bigger ones ? 
  clearly , a government ( or whoever owns the road ) should n't be allowed to make tax deals with certain car manufacturers , but that does n't mean that governments should n't be allowed to have higher tax on bigger cars in general . 
  of course they should be allowed to tax bigger cars . 
  just like isps should be allowed to bill larger connections . 
  it 's when the road owner or the isp starts billing ** certain ** cars or connections based on their deals or liking we got a problem . 
  again , did you even read what i wrote ? 
  well , if i pay for certain speed - and possibly a certain amount of data - every month , should n't my choice of data be solely between me and any content provider of my choice ? 
  of course , that is what a free market is . 
  you seem to place the free market part on the isp . 
  one has to remember , the ability of competition is essential to the free market principle and markets where monopolies/abuse is inevitable must be regulated , perfectly in accordance with capitalism and market principles . 
  an example of this would be roads or postal service . 
  now , imagine a privately owned free-market road , where every driver pays a regular fee based on the weight of his vehicle . 
  the owner of the road notices heavy vehicles makes more wear on the asphalt . 
  different types of heavy traffic goes on the road , let 's say transport trucks , tank transports and large private cars . 
  as he thinks of the private cars as useless wear on his road he decides to crack down on those . 
  adding an extra weight-fee on that type of traffic only would be questionable already , but he wants to go even further . 
  as he realizes the ability to drive on the road affects the customers decision on what brand of car to buy , he sees potential to charge - blackmail - the car manufacturers for permission for their cars to drive on the road , with the excuse of them being heavy ( which is , of course , already paid for once by the road customer permit 's weight-fee ) . 
  of the current heavy car manufacturers most will opt out of this road , and only a few paying large sums to the road owner will be left . 
  as different car manufacturers get deals with different roads , you are now left with a broken inconvenient infrastructure . 
  there wo n't be any new aspiring car manufacturers either , because due to fees out of their league these wo n't have roads to drive on . 
  you are now stuck with a oligopoly . 
  i guess we could just open up fifa14 and do some trial-and-error .
