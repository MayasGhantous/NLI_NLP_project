  you 're right about that , it is n't realistic - right now at least . 
  the last part was merely hypothetical , and the harsh truth it that it 's never possible to give everyone the same chance . 
  never the less , it 's the goal we should aim for ; bear in mind that is n't something people take for granted even in good times . 
  yes , i am also from sweden . 
  i have also witnessed the severe abuse and decay of the social democratic system , and i despise that as much as you do . 
  however , the most important thing is to give everyone an equal chance . 
  as much as i 'd like to crush the leeches to the ground , i 'd rather feed 100 leeches than let one decent person be revoked of a proper chance . 
  thing is , many people do n't want to be leeches . 
  if having a proper option , i 'd rather work for my money than have it be given to me . 
  not everyone has an option , though . 
  except for the bi-part , yes you did . 
  it is worth it though . 
  proper shows , objective news ( compared to all other channels at least ) , and no commercials . 
  to spare you the slideshow 1 . 
  sweden 3 . 
  norway 4 . 
  finland 5 . 
  australia 6 . 
  new zealand 7 . 
  the netherlands 8 . 
  germany 10 . 
  japan, 
  i was referring to your percentual numbers , which you referred to wikipedia . 
  keep in mind that immigration comes in waves , and 2008 - where your numbers are from - was a year with way fewer immigrants than most other years . 
  it is a bit trickier than that . 
  in sweden , we have 2 major political blocks , the democratic socialists and the center right coalition , both being highly pro-immigration . 
  the third option , the nationalists , as you probably can imagine , got a more restrictive view on the case . 
  however , they 'd be incapable of actually running a country , and hence do n't get that many votes . 
  so at the end of the day , we are stuck with 2 coalitions due to them being the only ones established enough to actually govern a country , both sharing the same view on immigration . 
   did i mention watches ? 
  you forgot cheese though . 
  it 's easy for us to make fun of them remotely . 
  but if they 'd truly been as ridiculous as they are often portrayed , the north koreans would have been liberated ages ago . 
  of course kim along with the rest of party tops understands how much of a joke they look like to everyone else . 
  they 're not stupid . 
  one ought to keep in mind these jokes are in charge of [ one of the largest armies in the world ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_number_of_military_and_paramilitary_personnel ) , which possesses some [ decent soviet-era weapons ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/korean_people%27s_army#capabilities ) , and have been for decades . 
  so despite everything going on for the show , they know how to handle their stuff . 
  that depends on the reason for them not joining . 
  even when the norweigans are angry , they sound happy !, 
  rest in peas, 
  the picture of latvia almost makes me wish the ussr never fell . 
  it 's ad hominem if it 's used to undermine ** an argument ** , not if you question their credibility as a ** factual source ** which is perfectly reasonable to do . 
  thank you for making the research . 
  got any source backing her role as a journalist ? 
   and last time there were elections before `` their time '' was in 1956 or so . 
  well given ireland 's history and situation it would n't be the best call to deny someone else unification . 
  some 1970s nasa [ studies ] ( http://settlement.arc.nasa.gov/basics/wwwwh.html ) suggested larger orbiting stations as a logical first step in colonization before moon bases . 
   but how does a party like this moved in the gender politics ? 
  mostly due to the former leader [ anna troberg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anna_troberg ) who was very invested in those questions . 
  as with the german counterparts , gender-politics . 
  that could n't possibly account for norway 's gdp per capita dropping from 97k to 81k though ? 
  i was looking at this [ nominal ] ( http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2015/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=2012&amp;ey=2015&amp;scsm=1&amp;ssd=1&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=%2c&amp;br=1&amp;pr1.x=34&amp;pr1.y=13&amp;c=914%2c946%2c137%2c962%2c193%2c912%2c181%2c913%2c124%2c921%2c943%2c918%2c138%2c142%2c156%2c924%2c964%2c182%2c960%2c968%2c423%2c922%2c935%2c128%2c135%2c942%2c939%2c936%2c961%2c172%2c132%2c184%2c915%2c134%2c174%2c144%2c146%2c944%2c176%2c178%2c186%2c136%2c158%2c926%2c112%2c111%2c941&amp;s=ngdpdpc&amp;grp=0&amp;a= ) table for 2015 . 
  what is up with the huge sudden drops ? 
  well , democracy is n't really about * a * leader , is it ? 
  and that is precisely what op said . 
  yeah . 
  all i can think of whilst reading this is the hilarious street sign that was posted in / r/sweden the other day http://i.imgur.com/de9rkil.jpg, 
  regarding dysfunctional , arguably state-less countries like libya ; would it be a completely unfeasible idea to just swoop in and make them eu protectorates , re-colonize so to speak ? 
   living paycheck to paycheck is the reality for most people in europe now that is an extremely unlikely claim , do you have any source to back that up ? 
   earn extra of your free days in order to buy yourself something you really do not have money for but want that 's usually how it works , if you want something and do n't have money for it . . 
    could you name one measure of `` freedom '' in which arabia has more than europe ? 
   explained above are you implying people are not able to provide for themselves in europe ? 
  that people do n't have the most basic necessities ? 
  that 's not what the discussion is about . 
  * you * suggested it is something to be envious about , * from a european point of reference * . 
  the contrast in question being greater wealth contra basic liberties implicitly made that the question . 
  while you are not wrong about a person not being free if not able to provide himself , how is that relevant ? 
  if there is a choice between `` basic necessities and freedom '' , then that is n't freedom , and practically speaking this reasoning only applies to third world countries . 
  could you name one measure of `` freedom '' in which arabia has more than europe ? 
  that depends on whether you value wealth or personal freedom more . 
  well of course it is never a good idea to walk in the dark , but the severeness of it varies by city and the state of this is what i asked . 
  well i think the problematic raised by `` white european '' was n't relating to matters of religion but rather that a western-looking person would be assumed to be rich and thus more prone to get mugged . 
  is there much mugging , robberies and petty theft in khartoum ? 
  no , of course an economy can be helped . 
  when usa helped germany after the war , was that colonialism ? 
  or when eu helps greece and romania , is that also colonialism ? 
  plot twist : muhammed actually looks like reddit silver . 
  the quran also does not mention the existence of electricity , kangaroos , or the continents of america . 
  what are we to make of everything the quran does n't say anything about ? 
  still , it is only harmful to talk about it as something to `` believe '' or `` not believe '' in , as if it was some kind of speculation . 
  instead ask if they acknowledge it . 
  then you say `` i would mind '' . 
  `` i would n't mind '' is a positive response . 
  nominal and ppp are different figures . 
  or rather , how clever are the european intelligence services he managed to evade ? 
   this video aims to remind everyone where right-populism lead us before as much the 1930s is a reminder of what happens with fascists in power , it ought to be an equal reminder of what happens when you disregard those who feel disenfranchised and pass them off as morons . 
  while i * respect * that people have religious beliefs , i 'd * prefer * they did n't . 
  i do n't see any contradiction in that . 
  do n't be such a braggart . 
  while card ( or otherwise digital ) payment is the * most * used method for sure , almost everyone handles cash on a fairly regular basis . 
  to name one example that 's directly palpable at least for people in the south it 's that trains to denmark are fewer , severely delayed , and you need to bring identification . 
  no european kazakhstan though . 
  sorry , that was a typo . 
  i meant 10 ton . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/davy_crockett_ ( nuclear_device ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tactical_nuclear_weapon that 's less than * a thousandth * of the hiroshima bomb . 
   now imagine 91 of them . 
  would n't have to imagine , there are tested devices that are as strong as 3000 hiroshima bombs . 
  i 'm sure the general populace here can totally evaluate the doings of jinping , modi , and rauhani and totally are n't just voicing their general feelings about those countries . 
  there are precision-nukes small enough to only heavily damage the buildings within some hundred meters . 
  they can be as small as 10 ton tnt .
