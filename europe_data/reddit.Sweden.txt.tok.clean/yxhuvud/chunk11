  they are not adjusting retroactively , meaning that the statistics went apeshit in mid 2000s . 
  the socks stay clean because we are able to keep the floors clean . 
  leaving your shoes by the door is standard , because then all crap from outdoors is not spread out all over . 
  if you ever visit anyone in sweden , you should know that it is very rude to keep your shoes on while indoors . 
  eh , because people does n't agree about what the truth is . 
  how would you do that ? 
  previous times the west have done things in middle east have not produced anything like stability . 
  you have no need of migrants in norway ? 
  i 'd want to see what would happen to oslo if all the migrants went home . 
  hint : it is almost a third of the total population . 
  well , that could do interesting things to low-end wages in the west . 
  not really . 
  the election result in question is nothing more than a strong recommendation to the parliament . 
  we have had several elections here in sweden that have been neglected . 
  in some cases i 'm very happy the will of the people was ignored , such as the election about what side of the road to drive on . 
  then choose some small part of it and improve that . 
  a lot of the reason sweden managed to grow so much during the waves of emigration to usa and the decades after that was that so many of the people that emigrated later migrated back - upwards 25 % . 
  they brought home ideas and knowhow from having done and seen stuff that was n't possible in their home town . 
  right . 
  everyone knows you are mongols . 
  both the danish and finnish numbers are pretty lackluster compared to the swedish numbers though . 
  that explains slovakia , then . 
  a default without quitting the eurozone would probably not have left you better off . 
  competetiveness is not gained fast and you would have run out of money quite fast . 
  if you had quit the euro though , and also had substantial haircuts to make the debt payable , then yes - that would have left you in a better place . 
  i find it funny that people think that default would have meant that they would n't have been able to get loans . 
  history shows that is n't the case , except for maybe a really short period around the actual default event ( s ) . 
  well , what the status quo actually is changes over time as the values and morals of society change . 
  conservatives of today are not fighting the same battles as the conservatives a few decades ago did , because they would look even more retarded if they tried to do that . 
  no , they are not saying nothing . 
  they are protecting the status quo , which traditionally has consisted of heterosexual marriages where the man works and woman stays at home taking care of the kids , while at the same time being detrimental to people that break that pattern , such as women with agency or being against homosexual marriage . 
  fuck that shit . 
  mostly because the other counties treat them so bad or are so bad at english . 
  can someone please take all those family values and shoot them behind a shed please ? 
  they have been fought against by both liberals and left-wingers for more than a century , and we are much better off without them . 
  as long as he does n't start to roll back education efforts , then time is on your side . 
  but sadly , the demographic changes that is needed to overcome this may take decades . 
  old people entrenched in the old need to die off , and younger people with more open views need to grow into power . 
  i just hope the time in the interim do n't end up too harsh for you . 
  yeah , written dutch is what you get if you mix german , english and danish . 
  spoken dutch also mix in a throat disease . 
  well , i certainly do n't understand the more obscure of our dialects . 
  norwegians are always intelligible , but sound as if they are high . 
  danish are seldom intelligible , as they sound as if they are talking with a potato in their mouth . 
  ok , so that chart shows a trend of sharply falling unemployment that has been going on since the peak in 2009 . 
  that fit my claim pretty well , you know . 
  no jobs in sweden ? 
  eh , you may be a decade or two out of sync . 
  there is loads of jobs in sweden and our economy is doing fantastic . 
  well , they do . 
  just like norwegians sounds like swedes that are high on something . 
  would have been more balanced with texas on the mainland . 
  found the wot-player . 
  perhaps the law should be written in a way so that it can be efficient ? 
  on the other hand , the way popular protests work is that if they get big enough while the government does n't budge , then it will almost always escalate . 
  also , escalation is seldom a good thing for the government unless they are ready to use deadly force to disperse the crowds . 
  and of the american . 
  this is a clear trend , sadly . 
  if enough people to do a general strike strikes , then it does n't matter if it is through a legal channel or not . 
  they can not imprison enough people for it to matter . 
  that is more or less how the labour parties gained the legal and organized strike rights in the first place . 
  no new pope ? 
  what am i seeing ? 
  romania has more of a stake tradition . 
  we used to have 1000sek notes , but ended up removing them as only criminals used them . 
  i use my visa card . 
  seriously , get with the times . 
  remove the 10 center while at it . 
  i really hate the huge amount of crap metal i end up with after visiting a euro country . 
  the difference though is that the swedish prisons are underpopulated , so we ate slowly cutting down on prison space . 
  well , at least the arabs articulate their words and do n't mash everything together like the sounds we are hearing from you . 
  he was obviously talking out of his ass then . 
  also the amount of growth area in sweden has not been static over time - it actually topped out in the 1920s and since then production has boomed and the area shrunk quite a bit . 
  i 'm reasonably certain germany does n't have more subsidies than we do here in sweden . 
  or do you have subsidies beyond what eu provides ? 
  also it ends up getting other kinds of refugees when you have successfully integrated other easier kinds . 
  for example , sweden received several waves of immigration from finland , italy and other countries before starting to accept large numbers of people from further away . 
  yikes , if you forgive them they 'd just do it again . 
  it stands for ` hemv\u00e4rnet ' , ie home defence . 
  yeah , but it was quite a while ago now . 
  heinlein was definitely thought provoking ( as opposed to goodkind , to pick at an author that is bad at both writing and politics ) but still very out there . 
  heinlein is the perfect example of how you can have horrible politics but still be a really good writer . 
  hopefully not . 
  we already knew libertarians were batshit . 
  yes , but it is the swedish military you are talking about , so you 'd end up having a fika . 
  good that you explain that to the german . 
  irony can be hard for them . 
  hv has people that thought it was fun to be in service . 
  some of those thought it was fun because they were ** good ** at it , but those are probably not a majority . 
  combine that with the fact that people tend to recruit their friends and you get the end result that the quality of hv is everything from really good to bad , with huge regional variance . 
  nah , the danes are just jealous that they never got to loot prague , so they are trying to make up for lost time . 
  the difference is that the referendum was accepted by the uk . 
  the green men that invaded crimea was not accepted by the ukrainian government . 
  we has basically solved it , and it is the main reason our economies work as well as they do . 
  you do n't fix emigration by having the places that people want to go to be worse , but by making yourself more attractive . 
  get your shot in order and less people will leave and you will be a lot richer . 
  the countries that tried the hardest to fight corruption post the fall of the warsaw pact is the ones that have grown the most economically . 
  distribution does n't really say anything about the absolute levels of wealth in the country , even for regular people . 
  it just says stuff about the distribution of it . 
  you are currently about 15 % behind in gdp/capita , but the difference used to be ** a lot ** larger than that , and even if you have a better distribution , that still does n't say that the poor in sweden is worse off than the poor in finland .
