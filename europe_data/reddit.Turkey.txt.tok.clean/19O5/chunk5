   how about helping nazi in the region ? 
  classic excuse for russian fascism is ` they helped nazis ' . 
  did the same with many other ethnic groups within the former ussr , especially with crimea by settling ethnic crimean tatars to central asia , and settling russians to crimea . 
  lol . 
  i 'm such a bad person for not liking the pkk :( i 'm also subscribed to / r/watchpeopledie . 
  what a bad person i am :(, 
  bro , i 'm atheist for three years and still could n't try or eat pork , it smells so different . 
  everyone 's talking bout how awesome bacon is and i 'm like ` yeah i never tried it and probably never gon na try that ' :(, 
  peace talk with kurds ? 
  you mean peace talks with the pkk ? 
  they 've turned the whole of southeast anatolia into a huge ammo after the last peace deal . 
  they were stupid enough to end the ceasefire , now they 're getting hammered day by day . 
  yeah , the peshmerga is the army of the krg . 
  they are as a matter of fact the only legitimate kurdish military group . 
  they are superior because they 're muslims you filthy dirty pork eating kuffar . 
  you will burn in hell . 
   i do n't know how she convinced herself it would be fine . 
  she seems to be like the retards who would welcome arriving refugees with #refugeeswelcome banners at the train stations . 
  these people live a complete dream, 
  i 'm just surprised because many bulgarians i 've met deny the turkic roots of bulgars and act like it 's an insult , lol . 
  oh fuck me how complicated can it be ? 
  \u0130t took me some time to get that you guys use sz for s but s for sh , while eastern slavic people use sz for sh for example . 
  but it 's pretty cool that our grammars are similar . 
  the thing is if there was no isis , it 'd be much easier for assad to gain control and authority over the rest of syria . 
  davuto\u011flu and erdo\u011fan have many times stated that the priority is to topple assad . 
  but that did n't mean that they 'd be supporting isis . 
  but what do you expect from a bunch of 15 year-old middle east experts who could n't show you on a world map where turkey even is . 
  greatest human being ever , srs . 
  he gave us so much . 
  he basically won anatolia back , made turkey a republic , promoted secularism and human rights , modernized our language and gave back our turkish identity . 
  and he was the most charismatic and most handsome person i 've ever seen whether [ on the battlefield ] ( https://cubuklukoyu.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/ataturk-canakkale.jpg ) , when havin a cigarette [ like here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/aeu4tpu.jpg ) or [ like here ] ( http://www.ataturkinkilaplari.com/depo/ataturk_posterleri/gbhyrv-ataturk-orman-cifliginde-dinlenirken-posteri.jpg ) , or [ when having a cup of turkish coffee like here ] ( http://www.mehmetcik.org.tr/content/images/ataturk-galeri-8.jpg ) . 
  also , for example he adopted a girl named sabiha g\u00f6k\u00e7en who would later become the first female turkish pilot ever and the first female fighter pilot in the whole world . 
  probably to highlight the belonging of countries to different regions as in ` scandinavia ' or ` baltic countries ' or ` caucasian countries ', 
  i think so . 
  in turkey ` felemenk\u00e7e ' is regarded as dutch while flemish ( flamanca ) , hollandic ( the dialect ) are regarded as dialects of ` felemenk\u00e7e ' . 
  no wonder we called them ` rumlar ' for centuries . 
  is hungarian ` gy ' the same as j as in jungle ? 
  because the c in turkish is the same as the j in jungle and i 'd expect the magyars to be calling the same as we call them in this case . 
  by the way how do you pronounce dzdudzsak ? 
  it 's funny that he seems to be mocking the azerbaijani letters since the armenians have letters like this ' \u0539 ' which looks like some scrawl by a two year-old . 
  i 'm positively surprised you guys know about tengri . 
  let 's leave islam and christianity behind and unite under k\u00f6k tengri like in the good old days . 
  you 're now officially my third favorite romanian ever after gheorghe hagi and gheorghe popescu . 
  i do n't think so except for they are close to us or were some time ago under ottoman control . 
  if you look at western and central europe you 'll see that all those countries are named very similar to how they are known in european languages . 
  maybe \u0130sve\u00e7 ( sweden ) and \u0130svi\u00e7re ( switzerland ) would be a bit different but it 's the same though . 
  sounds very complicated , thank you for the insight . 
  hellenes , ionians , greeks , romans - fuck me there are many ways to refer to modern greeks in different languages . 
  what a fantastic post . 
  thank you for your great contribution . 
  and here are the names of european countries in azerbaijani turkish . 
  are you guys aware that we call greek in anatolia and cyprus ` rumca ' and the greeks ` rumlar ' which both derive from roman ? 
  i feel it 's weird , that for example a greek cypriot speaks ` rumca ' or a pontus greek would speak ` pontus rumcas\u0131 ' . 
   i now wonder if austrians use the same word as germans , or if they have/had another term with magyar as its root . 
  it 's ungarn as in standard german . 
  you might be not wrong , i just went with the flow of current submissions . 
  oh yeah my mistake . 
  the word fes comes from that area . 
  officially it 's belarus cumhuriyeti . 
  but they are used interchangeably . 
  if you remove the \u0130 you have ` svi\u00e7re ' very much like the \u0130talian svizzera . 
  but the word we use comes actually from french ` suisse ' . 
  it 's also called beyaz rusya ( white russia ) . 
  but the mfa recognizes them as belarus cumhuriyeti ( republic ) . 
  birle\u015fik ( united ) krall\u0131k ( kingdom ) : england ( \u0130ngiltere ) , scotland ( \u0130sko\u00e7ya ) , northern ireland ( kuzey \u0130rlanda ) , wales ( galler ) arnavutluk ( albania ) , the name for albanians come from arvanites . 
  the name for greece ( yunanistan ) comes from ionians . 
  the name for morocco ( fas ) comes from ~ ~ the word fes ~ ~ the region fez inside morocco . 
  the name for montenegro literally means black ( kara ) mountain ( da\u011f ) . 
  dutch in turkish is felemenk\u00e7e although the country is named hollanda . 
  polish is leh\u00e7e in turkish . 
  greek outside of greece ( anatolia , cyprus ) is rumca , and greeks outside of greece are referred to as rumlar ( pl ) or rum ( sg ) . 
  the name comes from romans . 
  always wondered why polish is in turkish ` leh\u00e7e ' but poland is ` polonya ' . 
  now i got the answer i was always probably too lazy to look for . 
  that comes from ottoman turkish though . 
  in ottoman times vienna was ` be\u00e7 ' , later we 'd call it ` viyana ' . 
  yup he 's a mp . 
  here 's another mp of hdp :  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkalsjz6alw ` nobody should test the power of the kurdish people [ ... ] pkk has the power to make you drown in their [ pkk 's ] spit ' . 
  he also stated in another speech that the pkk is a peaceful movement and is no terrorist organization ( lol ) but what do you expect from a party whose leader says stuff like ` we 'll build a statue of \u00d6calan ' fuck these people . 
  they think they represent the kurdish people but they do n't . 
  and that 's why they 've lost many votes in the last elections . 
  except for the turk possibly . 
  proud to see one of my fellow countrymen among them . 
  / s however , he might have just turkish documents maybe . 
   why a higher number is dangerous for germany and in what aspect ? 
   #culturally ? 
  lol . 
  oh look the pkk supporter is here to lecture us about what 's good and what 's bad . 
  you lots and the islamist terrorists can fuck off , simple as that . 
  our country would be better off without both of you . 
  and hot blonde chicks . 
  \u0130t 's really hard to translate but : the ones ( state ) who test our ( pkk ) battle potential in the cities , have to expect a total warfare including western cities ( \u0130stanbul , \u0130zmir etc. ), 
  and rural areas . 
   istanople ???????? 
  and one peruv\u0131an casualty ( dead or injured i do n't remember ) update : 2 injured are severely injured . 
  \u0130t was a suicide bombing , performed by a syrian . 
  it 's what they think since it would fit the agenda of isis to cause chaos by terrori attacks on civilians . 
  either he meant ` western ' or he 's full of shit . 
  it 's not you mug . 
  know your shit before you start talking .
