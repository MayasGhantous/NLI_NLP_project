  long topic but as i stated above turkey has less prohibitions and bans on alcohol than western countries . 
  i guess european countries and united states are islamists aswell . 
  sigh . .  uskudar these are the reustorants where you can drink alcohol . 
  https://www.zomato.com/tr/istanbul/%c3%bcsk%c3%bcdar-restoranlar%c4%b1?bar=1 there are also thousands of tekels and carrefours , migros , macro center , sok , etc. 
  in uskudar . 
  oh btw i appreciate if you do n't reply back , i ca n't tolerate more stupidity . 
  that 's actually what you like to think . 
  just go visit any kurdish forum and see for yourself if you do n't believe me . 
  ypg is formed by pkk members and kck leads them . 
  ypg and pkk is like al-qaeda and al-nusra . 
  i still like obama and stuff but this plan is not going to work and its really a dick move . 
  imagine turkey telling usa to work with al-qaeda to defeat the isis . 
  it would be all over the news but its okay , usa and western europe can promote terrorists who does n't threaten them beause turkish lives are not as valuable as lets say french lives . 
  other than that regardless of the consequences , one thing is crystal clear that turkey will not sit there and watch kurds conquer arab cities all the way to mediterranean sea and have a port since pkk is getting aided by turkey 's ** allies ** and again these same allies are more than okay with kurds changing demographics of the region so if they also hold a port i 'm sure they can actually be a threat to turkey . 
  so its probably a better idea to go for an all out war on ypg and whoever supports them now or it will only get worse in the future . 
  for fucks sake who is secular in that region other than turkey ? 
  assad ? 
  russians ? 
  al-qaeda ? 
  isis ? 
  kurds ? 
  moderate rebels ? 
  the entire region is being run by sharia rules even your so called progressive , feminist ypg fighters which only make up the 0.000001 percent of the total kurdish population . 
  besides , what does settling refugees in syria have anything to with secularism ? 
  your anti-turkish sentiment is driving you mentally ill since every single post in your history is about the turks . 
  u should get help . 
  but it is * precious * to them . 
  i know you 're kidding and all but armanians are considered to be the best miniority in ottomans untill 1900s . 
  our best ally in the middle east is kurdistan regional government . 
  yeah u get executed for being gay in others , at best you get arrested . 
  in turkey its not illegal for nearly 200 years . 
  both . 
  we hosted the biggest lgbt-parade in the southern europe.tho we got much more problems to fix as you can see and i do n't think its realistic to expect parliament to pass the law right now . 
  we will definitely go for it once the liberal parties form a coalition tho . 
   for instance how many women did wear hjab 15 years ago , and today how many women does wear hijab ? 
  decreased from 70 percent to 50 percent . 
  they are just more visible , turkey is not getting religious at all . 
  in fact islam is in decline in turkey . 
  * censhorship of nudity , alcohol and even some kissing scenes in tv . 
  its nothing new and turkey is not the only country to ban it and it has absolutely no relation with islam because turkish tv-shows are completely against the islamic lifestyle hence why islamic countries ban and censor it . 
   * alcohol ban after 11 pm . 
  first of all we got no ban or prohibition on this matter except for selling it on grocery stores after 11 pm but you can still drink in the night clubs , cafes , etc. 
  everywhere with alcohol license . 
  turkey is more liberal than most of the europe and usa on this matter . 
  for more ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prohibition  * censorship of pornoghraghy and nudity on internet . 
  pornoghraghy is legal in turkey except for child porn . 
  but the guys who run this tib ( the presidency of telecommunication ) are bunch a couple of retards with no clue what to do with tons of bureaucratic shit . 
  so it takes very short to ban a website but it takes years to re-open it . 
  i can pm you the legal pornoghraghic websites in turkey if you like . 
  also for more info ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pornography_by_region https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pornography_in_turkey  * ban for public drinking in some districts governed by akp . 
  which district are you talking about ? 
  mayors have no authority to do that . 
   turkey is not an ally fuck off . 
  turkey worked for interests of western block more than any other country except usa and uk . 
  a modern world would be quiete different than what it is now if turkey and greece joined the soviet block in the 50s . 
  it would n't be easy to destabilize or even overthrow soviet allies in the middle east without turkish intelligence and host . 
  also this safe zone stuff is proposed to fix the refugee crisis . 
  you people do absolutely nothing but just bitch about everything . 
  ** turkey will not let refugees settle in turkey , period . 
  ** either eu takes them or we send them back to the syria , u must decide now instead of waiting usa to tell you what to do . 
  no those religious schools were kinda banned . 
  we had 500k imam hatip students in the 90s when our population was 50 million , we still have 500k imam hatip studens in 2016 when we have now 80 million population . 
  both islam and religious life style is in decline in turkey and i can proove it and also persuade you easily on this matter , even with the government 's statistics . 
  since they also admit that its happening hence why they stopped with the ` islam so good omg best religion ever ' speeches . 
   plus , i do n't have to mention all the authoritarian policies and laws of akp . 
  most of them due to nothing but islamism , even if they do n't mention islam directly . 
  i follow the politics closely but i must have miss some of these stuff . 
  care to explain , what are they ? 
  thats true , i did n't mean to imply that current turkish administartion to be as democratic as , lets say scandinavian countries , not even close but calling him ` islamist ' or ` dictator ' is unfair . 
  afterall we got a nice opposition who threatens his posistion as it happened in june 2015 elections , he simply said i respect the election results . 
  as for him being islamist ; he is in power for more than 10 years , he could easily put some islamic laws if not all . 
  at least some baby steps but he did n't go for ** any ** islamic law . 
  its not about pushing his agenda , its just fear mongering and it happens in every country . 
  we are supposed to be sharia country when akp took power yet after more than 10 years we are discussing gay-marriages and ** all ** islamic laws are still banned in turkey with zero exception . 
  same goes for eu . 
  refugees will be % 0.2 of total population of eu therefore destroy it . . 
   saudi arabia and ** turkey ** are both ** run by islamist ** governments . 
  http://factsanddetails.com/media/2/20120510-800px-countries_with_sharia_rule.png current turkish government is less islamist than lets say polish government being christanist . 
   like i said , this is not an anti is coalition . 
  100 percent propoganda post . 
  turkey has no interest in losing soliders for the future of arabs and kurds in syria . 
  i ca n't talk for saudis they are probably aiming to topple assad but turkish army will not move further than planned zone for refugees in turkey . 
  erdogan has no authority to do that but u guys would love to think that a muslim majority country must be an undemocratic dictatorship . 
  holy shit i was gon na type the exact same thing before clicked to the comments section . 
  come now we had anti-government protests each day for a straight 5 months with over 15 million people in nearly every corner of turkey in 2013 . we ( 20 million opposition voters ) are a bigger and way more serious threat to erdogan than 5 milion kurdish party voters . 
  why did n't we get killed by the government ? 
  i do n't want to jump to conculsions but perhaps it 's because we did n't hold ak-47s or rpgs . 
  no ataturk signature , 2/10 . 
  at least you know what to listen when driving through . 
  basically a mosque with an imam who says the exact words from quran . 
  you just ca n't let that happen because there are lots of sexist , intolerant , discriminatory and violent stuff in quran . 
  the armanians and kurds were majority on those cities ( eastern anatolia ) . 
  so let 's just blame it on the kurds and call it a day . 
   omer knows the histories of many revolutions . 
  `` the soviets , mao , fidel : '' their struggles have inspired him . 
  nice ufo at upper left . 
  ataturk is nearly worshipped in turkey . 
  do n't get fooled by the fear mongering of turkish users here . 
  even erdogan has a giant ataturk picture in his room and praise him multiple times a year when he visit ataturk 's mausoleum . 
  talk shit about ataturk and you will be quickly famous in turkey ( in a very negative way ) .
