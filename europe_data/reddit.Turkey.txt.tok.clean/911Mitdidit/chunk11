   but is there that much of a cultural difference between arabs and turks ? 
  if so , what are they ? 
  short answer : pretty much everything . 
  you can take a take a look at this thread . 
   i would have expected arabic ? 
  why ? 
  turks are pretty racist towards arabs and nearly noone has any sympathy for them . 
  to be perfectly honest , i have no idea . 
   are english classes mandatory in turkish schools ? 
  yes but its on a shitty level in public schools and somewhat okay in private schools . 
   are there several different languages offered and you just chose english ? 
  no , we just learn english , altough in college ( at least in my college ) you can learn pretty much any language you wish but i 'm assuming that you ca n't fully learn a language without also learning their culture . 
  i might be wrong tho since this perspective probably comes from my faculty ( i study pr ) . 
   or did you pick it up interacting with people online ? 
  internet certainly helps but i felt confident after interacting with foreigners ( erasmus students and tourists ) . 
  very informative , thank you . 
  i wonder if these teachings ( or something like that ) actually applied to the belief system . 
  for example ; i see that we turks are hanafi but i do n't see how hanafism applies to even the most conservative and religious turks . 
  i mean i just looked at wikipedia and it sounds crazy even for the caliphate ottoman-era . 
  yea but when you translate something , you should also consider the daily and formal speech of that culture . 
  how do you translate ` aln\u0131m\u0131zda enayi yazm\u0131yor ' and make it a headline . 
  in this kind of situtation a native english speaker would say ` you are not fooling anyone ' . 
  of course i 'm not a native speaker but i think , saying ' i am not a sucker ' sounds weird and lame while grammatically correct . 
  thanks , but it wo n't happen . 
  most of the turkish diaspora are from the lower economic class of turkey and there is a correlation in between economic class and religiousness level . 
  i do n't even know what do they mean . 
  what is the difference in between salafis and hanafis ? 
  you guys will be very sorry for not forming some sort of ministery of religious affairs and keep them in check . 
  islam or muslims will not be modernised in europe when saudis fund the mosques . 
  secularism my ass , it wo n't save you when you get considerable amount of radical muslims in your country . 
  i unintentionally heard this speech when i was driving back home . 
  title is kinda misleading , he said ; un says we should open the gates and take refugees and at the same time we should close our gates to the europe . 
  we are not fools ^ 1 , what is the use of un , why do you exist if you are going to ignore the sitation and impute the refugees on turkey . 
  ^ 1 = fools or idiots . 
  both would be ok words to translate . 
  the word enayi ( turkish ) is an adjective which means someone who is extremely naive and easy to trick and its not as offensive as idiot or fool . 
  ca n't argue with that lol . 
  i think sometimes he just blow some cocain before making these kind of speechs . 
   yes you do , see the news about oil truck caravans . 
  your country is funding isis , straight up . 
  there are probably 1000 times more news about how usa arming al-qaeda , do you believe that shit too ? 
  not to mention there are same amount of news about assad and russia buying oil from isis too . 
  words of a ` senior offical ' or journalist from the other side of the earth is no evidence . 
  bring me a video of trucks entering to turkey from isis held territory and i will believe that shit otherwise do n't bother me . 
  17th biggest economy in the world needs isis oil when entire world watch the syria . . right !, 
   your country is arming these guys . 
  that does n't mean they are automatically becoming our bitch . 
  as i stated before any military officer would know that u do n't shoot an enemy pilot so its pretty clear that they are a very small and stupid faction in this conflict . 
  what they do is nearly irrelevant in the bigger picture . 
  there are already considerable amount of turks who voted for kurdish party in the western turkey . 
  we could support more their cause if they killed less civilians or off-duty police officers in front of their families . 
   stop buying isis oil . 
  we do n't . 
   shut down the turks at north syria . 
  they are not turks . 
  they are called turkmen and they are citizens of syria and a small faction in rebel block . 
  turkey has no authority over them and probably not even enough influence since turkey would stop them from shooting a military pilot and advise them to take the pilot as hostage . 
  pilots are the most valuable hostages since they know every single information about the battle plans . 
   only war party that seems to be doing something against isis , then all good . 
  incorrect , every faction is at war with isis and right now they are losing in all fronts . 
   also t72 and 152mm field artillery is not exactly terror weaponry . 
  very easy to take out with air strikes too ... exactly my point . 
  i already said that it wont be effective but it will just hurt the relations . 
  even if the entrie nato members betray turkey and accept the situation the war would n't stop there since there are 70 nuclear war heads in incirlik base ( one of the six european nato bases with nuclear warheads ) and turkey has its own long range ballistic missiles . 
  its more about harming the relations rather than fear mongering . 
  pkk will achieve nothing even if they are armed with heavy weapons . 
  what would you feel if isis attacked your country multiple times ( we are n't close allies with finland so its not even a good comparison ) and then a turkish spokesperson come up with ` we do n't think isis is a terror organisation but we respect your opinnion . 
  oh btw we will arm them because they fight with pkk ' ? 
  when isis attacked that kurdish town in syria , these guys attacked turkish civilians and burned down buses so do n't look for any logic . 
  it reminds me of this meme . 
  http://i.imgur.com/alnmjqd.jpg translation : al bagdadi : burning that public bus was a strategic strike to us ( isis ) . 
  attack on the ptt ( mail service for turkish government ) led us to dissolving phase . 
  hdp teached us a good lesson . 
  well you know , never ending fight in between greeks and turks on which country invented yoghurt , baklava , coffee and stuff . 
  what makes you think russia wo n't bomb them on russian border when they do in syria without hesitation ? 
  well at least they would kinda feel like as if they are back at home . 
  eu would be recognizing northern cyprus in that case . 
  nice plan !, 
  erdogan did n't refuse it tho , parliament vetoed it . 
  erdogan wanted to both host the usa/uk soliders and invade iraq with them . 
  we robbed a swiss bank . 
  time to halt the cuisine war on youtube and actually help greece . 
  they can still be in custom union , right ? 
  in the same convention turkey put geographic restrictions . 
  turkey insisted on taking refugees only from the european countries twice , both in 1951 and 1968 . because we knew what kind of shit will happen in our backyard with full of islamist dictatorships . 
  eu wants turkey to change this policy if they become a eu member therefore turkey softened these laws in 2014 and took refugees from syria but its ** temporary ** . 
  they are not supposed to stay and live here forever . 
  most likely they will tho but i 'm just stating our international protection law hence why we got no legal obligations unlike rest of the europe . 
  refugees ca n't melt european fences . 
  turkey changed the roe only on turkish-syrian border after syrian regime shot down an old turkish f-4 without a single warning . 
  i 'm sure usa and russia would change their roe aswell after shooting down each others jet . 
   ** turkish girls , like most of the middle east ** , be cray thou . 
  why does russia want right wing parties to rise in europe ? 
  erdogan is not bombing anyone in the syria . 
  turkey bombed isis less than 10 times and shelled twice some territory as warning shot to ypg . 
   where do you think isis sells all there oil ? 
  literally to everyone in that region . 
  i ca n't think of any . 
  when you face 35k people lined up at your border what can you do to stop them ? 
  i guess refugee crisis was n't really a thing for europe back then and not many people remember what happened in turkish border .
