  if its something still acceptable in 2016 , i believe turkey has the power to conquer bunch a couple of lands aswell and they should go for it ? 
  hatay is a turkish city and it did n't get invaded at all . 
  they joined to turkey because turks were and still are the vast majority in this city and there is a small arab miniority and kurds made the 1 or 2 percent of total population of the city in 1936 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hatay_state https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hatay_state, 
  you are trying too hard . 
  safe zone is all about defeating isis in northern syria and creating refugee cities . 
  kurds have different plans ( such as conquering arab cities all the way to mediterranean sea ) so they would n't be landlocked , thats why they complain . 
  of course not but i though u mean the turkish redditors . 
  other than that half of the people always complained about governments . 
  i ca n't think of any turkish government which people did n't shit on for all the wrong doings . 
  there will be always two wings who both support and oppose an x action done by the government unless there is some sort of extreme case . 
  have you ever been in r/turkey or just generally see any pro-erdogan/government comment in here ? 
  its just you guys are just criticizing turkish administration for all the wrong reasons . 
  such as turkey killing innocent kurds , erdogan being islamist , hating west and stuff like that . 
  what does my comment have anything to do with national pride ? 
  i 'm stating the obvious that syrian civil war has nothing to do with turkey . 
  its a sharia country which is governed by a dictator and the fight is all about the islamists ( assad ) , more islamists ( fsa ) and extremists ( isis ) trying to gain power . 
  any group you support would be islamist anyway . 
  rest of the things u typed are pretty crazy and on liveleak comment section level . 
  turkey will not declare war on russia , iran , kurds or anyone in any case . 
  turkey did n't distance itself from the europe , its the direct result of actions of eu . 
  i ca n't blame them tho they are happy with the current stance of turkey being in custom union but does n't take part in desicion making or recieving net . 
  the situation ca n't be any better for germany and france . 
  as for economy your claim is even funnier than turkey declaring war on countries . 
  turkey quadrupled its gdp in 10 years from 196 billion usd to 822 billion usd and doubled its gdp per capita . 
  eu talks and nato membership have nothing to do with us bases in turkey . 
  in fact turkey shut down these bases when relations gone ill in 70s and they still need the approval of turkish government to use this base in operations so its not something huge for usa . 
  they could just build bases on the puppet states such as iraq , krg or rojava and do whatever they like to do . 
   when the us has finished its pivot to asia and redrawn the shia-sunni balance . . like they did in iraq , lol . 
  its probably true because these islamists rebels want to destroy the culture of progressive local people of syria . 
  they ca n't even go for their daily lgbt-parades anymore so they had to flee to the turkey and it has absolutely nothing do with assad bombing cities . 
  bulgars ( ancient turkic tribe ) had nothing to do with modern bulgaria ( our neighbor ) . 
  what do you think happens in harems and dungeons ? 
  have you ever been in turkey ? 
  i only felt patriotic during gezi park protests . 
   the former president saakachvili who was predictably super anti-russian now has an arrest warrant in georgia and became a minister in ukraine til . 
  i do n't think there is any realistic war plan to invade russia from turkey or invade turkey from russia unless you are willing to give heavy casualities over black sea or spread the war over georgia , armania and azerbaijan . 
  in fact these countries will be the main war zones and get fucked because of russia and turkey 's stupid war . 
  to be perfectly honest , i do n't have much knowledge about georgian politics but i heard the defense minister of georgia backed turkey after the jet incident and u know war and stuff in between these countries back in 2008 . http://www.worldbulletin.net/caucasus/166812/georgia-backs-turkey-over-russia-warplane-incident, 
  nice try , brochure guy . 
  why ? 
  when things come to that turkey can easly handle russian military in * syria , mediterranean and black sea * since they are very small and old compared to turkish military units in the region but a full-scale war is scary and in that case fighter jets in adana would n't help turkey at all . 
  they better operate in eastern europe or north east of turkey and may be georgia ( i guess they hate russians ) but then again its not likely to happen since its no secret that war in between these countries will collapse their economies and future goals . 
  statement of turkish ministery of foreign affairs : http://www.mfa.gov.tr/no_-33_-30-january-2016_-press-release-regarding-the-violation-of-turkish-airspace-on-29-january-2016-by-a-rf-aircraft.en.mfa statement by the nato secretary general on russian air space violation : http://nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_127562.htm turkish president erdogan 's speech about the violation : http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/cumhurbaskani-erdogandan-onemli-aciklamalar-40047406 its in turkish , so i will just sum it up : he says ruaf has been warned by turkish officals in both english and russian this time . 
  repating these actions will have consequences . 
  russia wants to ignite the crisis in the region and they kill civilians etc. 
  he also mentioned that russia does n't fight with isis and trying to sustain the assad regime . 
  these actions bring no benefit to russia federation , russia-nato relations or global and regional peace . 
  we could at least reduce the damage done by building refugee cities in northern syria . 
  turkey did n't even asked eu 's help to do this but international community freaked out because they wanted to let kurds take over arab cities . 
  right now eu should just shut up and take it because whats happening today is the result of their incompetence . 
  sanctions will not break turkey 's economy . 
  also eu is not a federal state and i 'm sure these sanctions will hurt greece and italy 10 times more than it hurts turkey . 
  also i 'm not sure if uk ends it relations with turkey just because eu told them so when they are so eager to leave it . 
  other than that eu is main ` export ' partner of the turkey . 
  russia , china , germany ( no more if sanctioned ofc ) and iran are the main import partners , mostly due to energy . 
  also having shit tons of trade paths , turkey could easly export its goods to other countries , sure it will hurt the prices but its definitely not going to be ` squashed ' . 
  `` what exactly do you want ? '', 
  one of the students shouted . 
  `` that 's what women can expect if they walk around there at night ! '', 
  no one in the classroom protested . 
  ** the girls were silent . 
  ** whats wrong with these people ? 
  they should have scream , yell and outrage . 
  you just defend your rights if you wan na keep them . 
  i totally agree with you but you got ta understand that turks are not united under one idea or anything . 
  to change these laws takes insane amount of work , time and cooperation and all political parties have completely different agendas . 
  changing constitution is nearly impossible . 
  it needs 330 mp out of 550 for referandum and it needs arround 376 ( or was it ? 
  i ca n't really remember ) to change it . 
  let me put it this way . 
  even when turks attacked on constantinople there were 600 turkish soliders ( nearly 10 percent of the total defence force ) defending byzantium . 
  politics are always a mess in turkey and we will divide on pretty much anything :d . 
   well the danish cartoons could easily be classed as that due to all the idiots who rioted over it . 
  u 're right but these kind of laws are not enforced . 
  one of the oldest and respected newspaper cumhuriyet published charlie hebdo after the incident . 
  another example would be that we got this stupid hat law ( its about abandoning fez and wearing normal hats instead ) . 
  its one the most stupid and weird laws to have in 2016 but its still there to respect the memory of ataturk but its not enforced . 
  insulting president was also this kind of law ( not enforced ) but last 3-5 years akp got very aggressive and they sometimes charge people for it but its not something on a crazy level . 
  they randomly pick 5-10 people a year to charge for it and they just pay arround 300-500 euro so they are getting fined instead of rotting in jail . 
  it is more of a hate speech thing actually and the case is all about '' if such act causes potential risk for public peace . '', 
  its only if extreme cases go viral . 
  like i mean there are bunch a couple of weird people who film themselves ripping quran apart or shitting on it ( lol ) but even not all of them end up in being fined . 
  other than that u do n't rot in jail for insulting anything . 
  in worst and extreme case u are fined for maximum 600 euro or 6 months jail if u ca n't afford it . 
  but then again there were like one or two cases on this matter . 
  its same like german law , nothing like middle eastern style ( u get executed if you deny the existance of allah in most muslim countries ) . 
  its cool , we got used to other muslim countries ruining our image . 
  in fact i just read a comment with 40ish upvotes on r/worldnews which says ` blasphemy is a crime in turkey ' ... 
  iran always had this , my way or highway attitude after the islamist revolution . 
  you should n't expect iran to respect your people or culture . 
  respect hollande for standing up , unlike italy . 
  well you 're right but i wonder what will be the next excuse when cyprus reunifies . 
  can confrim , military guys say russian navigations stopped making any errors after the incident . 
   hitler is n't remembered for his vegetarianism . 
  til . . i thought he eats babies for breakfast . 
  i got offended by this because it includes crescent and star . . it should have been black banner of mohammed or something like that . 
  wearing tin foil hats and bras should be also mandatory when going outside . 
  i think there are two agreements ( ** erasmus = ** eu countries plus turkey , switzerland and norway . 
  ** non-erasmus = ** non-eu countries ) on student exchange stuff at least in my school , they say so . 
   atat\u00fcrk managed to abolish the caliphate , napoleon and garibaldi failed to do the same with the papacy .
