  vote rigging is beyond impossible in western cities and extremely hard to do in central turkey . 
  its kinda easier in eastern cities but they are full of akp and hdp voters so its kinda irrevelant since hdp wins all the kurdish cities . 
   both are biased , and i do n't think the turkish military intended to destroy the town like things were in operation hammer , but the turkish military certainly did n't held back ; so that probably skew the views of both sides . 
  indeed but if u wan na avoid civilian casualities u shouldnt really hide behind civilians in the first place . 
  if these uneducated backward retards would be any clever they wouldnt take arms in the first place . 
  turks do vote for kurdish party and want kurds to have equal rights with turks . 
  i actually sometimes wonder if pkk works for erdogan 's interests but then again u go to kurdish forums and see that they actually support pkk . 
  they also think that pkk saves the kurdish people from turkish military as if turks aim to destroy kurdish towns but pkk saves kurds with their ak47s and rpgs lol . 
  i believe we would be talking about referandum for autonomy or may be even independence if pkk or any armed groups didnt exist in that area . 
   controlling the external border and applying sensible standards for entry is not at all the same as imposing a policy of `` you shall not pass ! '', 
  agreed , putting a gandalf on every border would be a way better idea . 
  fun fact : palestine was one of the first arab country to betray ottomans and cause its downfall during world war 1 . not sure why this current government so obsessed with palestine . 
  i 'd understand having influence on neighbor countries with rich oil reserves but whats up with palestine ? 
  not sure what they are trying to accomplish with these retarded statements . 
  if turkey was 10 percent evil as they think or if turkey wasnt a complete buffer zone in between armed lunatics of middle east and europe , i wonder how would they deal with all this shit . . 
  christianization of russia worries me under the rule of christianist dictator putin day by day . 
  they cant be open minded like western europeans or turkish president erdogan about lgbt rights . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bp6grwsija edit : for those who are not getting the irony . 
  ypg has a fantastic image to the international community and its a fact that their weapons will turn on turkish state eventually . 
  therefore turkish state will never support them as long as they have alliance with pkk but ca n't really attack them neither since they have good image . 
  assad is no enemy of turkish people or state . 
  he is just a war criminal and turkish state doesnt attack the groups which already fight against him . 
  its not like erdogan hates assad because he did anything wrong to him . 
  current turkish government aims to have influence on this new syria state/states for economical reasons . 
  just like turkey-kurdistan regional government relations . 
  but this doesnt mean turkey and isis have same ideological goals . 
  ffs forget the turkish people , even erdogan visits bars and meet and coopetate with actress who played in pornographic/erotic movies . 
  he also talked positively about lgbt rights . 
  after all these events i dont want to jump into any conclusions but i dont think erdogan and isis share the same ideology . 
  another strong evidence which can not be disclosed now but we 'll proove it soon . 
   turkey has blatantly provided material support to the isil because they share an ideological connection . 
  whoever believes this crap needs a brain examination . 
  indeed but my point is insulting erdogan is not a brave thing to do since millions of turkish citizens do it daily and get away with it . 
  its not as brave as u think . 
  millions of people swear at erdogan openly on facebook , twitter and even on live tv etc. 
  and only 100 people charged for insulting erdogan this year . 
  gib balkans back and we happily give east to the armanians and kurds . 
  got warned for ten times before they entered the airspace . 
  we eat babies for breakfast afterall . 
  its very good reason to believe . 
  turks have reputation for every single negative thing in europe it seems . 
  that turkish hate wow . 
  what have we ever done to you ? 
  crimea belonged to the tatars for centruies and tatars were majority in it for nearly a half milennium . 
  adana is getting more progressive it seems . 
  normally the adana people which we know would lynch them in 30 seconds but instead they let police handle it wow . 
  yea but nazis conquered nearly all europe . 
  russians defeated nazis and finns defeated russians . 
  they 're the best right now . 
  if every country shoots down their planes ( or helicopter in this case ) , they ca n't declare war on everybody right ? 
  eventually one of them will step up and say ` hey , its not really such a great idea to enter 10 km into foreign countries with our military equipment ' . 
   turkish straights gives nato leverage so do turkish homosexuals since russia is anti lgbt . 
  bolek i lolek was very patriotic imo . 
  there were only 2 warning shots which was fired from ** turkish territory ** to not pass trough the euphrates river . 
  its not like they could n't find where the ypg headquarter is lol . 
  also kurds are in turkish border , turkey doesnt even need to enter syrian airspace . 
  turkey bombs only the pkk faction of kurds which is equal to % 0.001 of total kurdish population in the middle east . 
  they are in northern iraq ( nearly 2.000 km away from russian bases in syria ) . 
  turkey just bombed them yesterday by the way . 
   yeah , now there 's heavy sam in the area does n't mean anything for turkish armed forces since they do n't bomb assad , opposition groups or russia . 
  turkey bombs iraq for decades ( there is no russian presence in iraq ) and bombed isis targets bunch a couple of times ( again no russian presence in eastern or even central syria since they mainly focused on rebels in north-west ) . 
  this all s-400 stuff is complete show off or save face and its not like turkey does n't have ground troops in our border . 
  they can be easly destroyed by surface to surface missiles and artillery or even with tanks if there is actual war in between these two countries . 
   russia is probably thinking how to arm the kurds . 
  there is no actual war in between turks and kurds . 
  bunch a couple of brainwashed kids take arms and go to mountains and then end up being dead . 
  pkk accomplished absolutely nothing over 30 years and turkey was pretty weak back then . 
  other than that russia would be arming terror organization and in return turkey would supply sovereign states such as ukraine and georgia . 
  not sure which one gets in more trouble in the eyes of international communities . 
   besides , turkey violates greek airspace all the time . 
  the area is disputed . 
  turkey-syria engagement rules are changed after downing of turkish jet . 
  neither turkey nor greece aims for global dominance and they are allies . 
  if greece was so sicked of it they could change their engagement rules . 
  oh and turkey doesnt kill greek miniorities in a civil war in ** lets say ** macadonia or bulgaria with the request of their blood thirsty dictators . 
  he has a point tho , russian planes did stop violating turkish airspace after the incident . 
  istanbul is no kebabland tho , u should go for adana ( and probably urfa ) . 
  raki & seafood with the bosphorus view . 
  u do n't get to do that everytime or anywhere besides turkey . 
  i wonder why his daughter is still single in her 30s and works instead of taking care of her children ( not that i think its wrong to be single in 30s or not having kids ) . 
  its hard to call ** child ** to the 17 years old people . 
  one year does n't change anything . 
  i wonder why these lawmakers are so freaking stupid to make merriage age to 17 so we can have bad image but whatever . 
  avarage first merriage age in turkey is 25 . for more merriage/divorce statistics : http://www.tuik.gov.tr/prehaberbultenleri.do?id=18628 also for those who are curious about why some turkish people marry this early . 
  because its forbidden to have sex without merriage in islam and one third of them respects this rule . 
  how do you know if a person is muslim or not ? 
  do u simply ask them or register them as muslims ? 
   give back eastern ukraine to russia and troubles will end . 
  irrevelant . 
  extremism has nothing to do with buildings design but the people . 
  u appoint your guy instead of some jihadist maniac who secretly wants to destroy the western civilization . 
  problem solved . 
   also look how having a religious affairs worked out for turkey of course it did work for turkey . 
  which group has the agenda to demolish secular and democratic turkish republic ? 
  and no the ones who want turkey to be more religious does n't count . 
   a society that becomes more and more religious and islamism that is on the rise for decades . 
  we use this term as a propoganda since secularism is a higher value than sharia in turkey ( at least for 90 percent of the population ) . 
  there is no islamic law in turkey . 
  there was 500k religious school students in 90s . 
  now there are 450k religious school students and the total population of turkey increased by % 50 .
