  i do n't have much clue about mosques and muslims in europe but i 'm curious about one thing . 
  why dont u guys form a religious affairs thing like turkey does . 
  appoint your imams who graduated from respected theological faculties and keep them in check . 
  make their speechs ready or just approve/disaproove their speechs . 
  and if they talk about extreme stuff just fire them and replace with someone else . 
  in that case it wouldnt be so catastrophic to attack istanbul . 
  not sure if serious . 
  ** turkey ** * ** turkey gives france authorization to use turkish airspace in anti-isil operations ** the turkish government has granted france permission to use its airspace in the fight against islamic state of iraq and the levant ( isil ) , diplomatic sources have told h\u00fcrriyet daily news . 
  `` france asked us for authorization to use our airspace in the context of the fight against deash [ isil ] in syria . 
  this authorization was given on condition that the general principles outlined for the coalition countries are followed , '' the source said . 
  france is to `` intensify syria operations '' after the nov. 13 paris attacks , said french president fran\u00e7ois hollande , while police raided the homes of suspected islamist militants across france overnight , arresting 23 people , after french aircraft began intensifying bombing isil targets in the caliphate 's capital , raqqa , on nov. 15 . 
  meanwhile , german defense minister ursula von der leyen will visit turkey on dec. 3 to conduct talks with her counterpart , \u0130smet y\u0131lmaz . 
  although no official decision has been taken yet , german and turkish officials have been working on finalizing a memorandum of understanding on the basis of germany 's proposals , diplomatic sources told the h\u00fcrriyet daily news . 
  germany wants to send six tornado reconnaissance jets , refueling aircraft to \u0130ncirlik airbase in southern turkey , a frigate to protect a french aircraft carrier in the mediterranean sea , and up to 1,200 military personnel to the region for one year , in response to a french appeal after the terrorist attacks in paris that killed 130 people .

  `` when a party-member presidential system is on the table , then it would be a different version of france 's system . 
  that would bring a different strength too , '' erdo\u011fan told reporters onboard a plane returning to turkey from qatar on dec. 3 . 
  responding to a question on the possibility of a system where the president was elected from the ranks of a political party , he said this could be a solution if no other amendment can be achieved . 
  erdo\u011fan also said the country 's `` dual-headed system '' of rule has to be removed , referring to the powers currently held by the president and the prime minister who were both elected to their positions by the public . 
  `` we must remove this duality . 
  otherwise , regardless of how much you like each other or how long you have worked together in the past , there may be problems , '' he said . 
  he also said that any amendment to the system should be voted on in a referendum . 
  recalling that the recently elected government 's announced program included transforming the parliamentary system into a presidential one , erdo\u011fan said the government did not have the power to realize that transition without the support of opposition parties . 
  `` this can be done with the support of other parties in the parliament or through an amendment of the constitution in a referendum . 
  a constitutional amendment can be made in this respect , but it would have to be voted on in a referendum , '' he said . 
  according to the current constitution , if a constitutional amendment is passed with over 330 votes in the 550-seat parliament , a referendum is necessary to approve the change .

  the workshop , titled `` the crime of insulting the president 's contradiction with the constitution and proposals for a solution , '' was hosted by the ankara bar association on dec. 4 . 
  many academics hold the conviction that article 299 of the turkish penal code ( tsk ) which covers `` insulting the president '' breaches both the european convention on human rights ( echr ) and rulings by the european court of human rights ( ecthr ) , according to hakan canduran , the president of the ankara bar association . 
  serious violations of human rights have been experienced because judicial bodies do not favor freedom of expression while making their decisions on issues related to this article , canduran said . 
  `` a person who defames the president of the [ turkish ] republic shall be imprisoned for a term of one to four years and the penalty to be imposed shall be increased by one-sixth if the offence is committed publicly and by one-third if it is committed by way of press and media , '' states article 299 . 
  since former prime minister recep tayyip erdo\u011fan 's election as president in august 2014 , the number of prosecutions for insulting the head of state has risen and largely targeted artists and journalists , as well as schoolchildren . 
  problems surrounding `` the crime of insulting the president '' are not merely legal , murat arslan , the president of the judges and prosecutors union ( yarsav ) , said . 
  `` we have to see this also as a political problem notwithstanding that it is a legal problem . 
  that 's why we need to raise a political struggle , '' arslan said . 
  mustafa karada\u011f , the president of the union of judges , also echoed arslan 's view . 
  `` the matter is political . 
  politically , ` the crime of insulting the president ' should disappear , '' karada\u011f said . 
  `` they want to silence all of our voices by saying ` insulting the president ; ' it 's all about it , '' he said .

  one soldier was seen in footage of the boat passing holding a ground-to-air missile , drawing an angry reaction from turkish foreign minister mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu . 
  the soldier held the missile on his shoulder in the shooting position during the passing of russia 's `` caesar kunikov '' warship . 
  `` this is provocation , this is a harassing passage , '' \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu told reporters on dec. 6 in his hometown antalya . 
  `` the russian warplanes ' violation of our airspace and the passing of the russian warships through the bosphorus are two very different things , '' he added , referring to the montreux convention regarding the regime of the bosphorus and dardanelles straits . 
  `` the passages should be made in accordance with the international agreements , whether it is a russian ship or of another nationality , the rules have long been determined , '' \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu said . 
  he added that the `` necessary answer will be given in situations deemed to be a threat . '' http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkish-fm-slams-russias-missile-provocation-in-bosphorus.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=92121&amp;newscatid=341 * ** turkish military to have a base in iraq 's mosul ** turkey will have a permanent military base in the bashiqa region of mosul as the turkish forces in the region training the peshmerga forces have been reinforced , h\u00fcrriyet reported . 
  the deal regarding the base was signed between kurdistan regional government ( krg ) president massoud barzani and turkish foreign minister feridun sinirlio\u011flu , during the latter 's visit to northern iraq on nov. 4 . 
  at least 150 turkish soldiers , accompanied by 20-25 tanks , were deployed to the area by land late on dec. 4 , anadolu agency reported . 
  turkish army sources told anadolu agency on dec. 5 that they had been training fighters across four provinces in northern iraq to fight isil . 
  according to the military , the peshmerga forces have been trained for fighting with homemade explosives , heavy machine guns , mortars , artillery and also received first-aid training . 
  more than 2,500 peshmerga , including high-ranking officers , have attended the turkish training , the military added . 
   well , he 'd be hard pressed to shoot it to europe from there . 
  its about 500 meters to 3.5 km . 
   if he shot it towards istanbul he 'd be pretty fucking stupid though , cause aa weapons are n't known to be very effective when shooting surface to surface . 
  which is why i said ** accidently ** and it does n't matter how effective your weapon is . 
  u would still be attacking the largest populated city with the 5th highest gdp in europe . 
  ca n't imagine what would happen if he accidently fired it to the most populated city in europe . 
  i can easliy say that noone in turkey takes this guy serious . 
  even avarage akp voter facepalms when he talks . 
  now , now , bombing syria does n't make you terorist . 
  it makes you normal like the rest of us . 
  do n't bomb the western countries and we are okay . 
  air defence ( surface to air missile system ) projects were started arround 2007 or something . 
  i think we needed them once the syrian civil war started and therefore had to buy chinese stuff but i think they changed their mind . 
  probably prototypes are good enough to mass product , tho i could be very wrong about the last one . 
  by the request of kurdistan regional governent . 
  really ? 
  tom saved hobbits from wights which was sent by witchking to barrow-downs during arnor-era and he changed the fate of middle earth for 2 reasons : 1 . ), 
  obviously saved ring . 
  gave merry the daggers which was enchanted with the power to harm the witch-king of angmar himself by a weaponsmith of arthedain and it indeed did help kill the sauron 's right hand witch king . 
  doesnt justify to kill 2 million innocent people . 
  or glorfindel . 
  senior offical confrimed to the journalist from the exact opposite side of the earth . 
  yea sometimes transformers and sometimes dinosaurs . 
  u never know whats gon na happen in the next day in ankara . 
   the oil is bought through turkey from syria , and it 's sold to black market traders who function throughout the levant nothing new , pkk smuggles stuff into turkey for 30 years . 
   the majority of them have traveled through turkey . 
  this was never denied since all of them disguise themselves as refugees and refugees are not in custody , they are always free to get back to their country . 
  % 0.0006 of them happens to be isis member . 
   middle eastern allies , including saudi arabia and qatar , direct weapons to moderate syrian rebel forces . 
  this was never denied aswell . 
  turkish government supplies turkmens openly and may be fsa aswell . 
  they are n't unsung heroes tho . 
  in fact they are one of the few british people in history i ever heard of . 
  gollum actualy saved the middle earth . 
  that no-good halfling changed his mind and did n't destroy the ring at the end . 
  if it was n't for gollum middle earth could n't be saved and nazguls would catch frodo at the end therefore let sauron destroy the middle earth . 
  this doctor guy actualy complimented him by implying erdogan is the savior of middle east . 
  in other words its leaving people to die under crazy dictators and jihadists groups because your economy would be damaged and its not even really a big strike . 
  if a country like turkey can look after 3 million refugees , richer eu countries than turkey easly could do the same . 
   financially , it 's a burden we do n't need . 
  thats so harsh . . just wow . . they are people not a burden . 
  i hope u never have to go trough this process after a pointless civil war but a little bit empathy would n't hurt . 
  i was doing a research about greek public diplomacy and many articles claim that greece changed its policy towards turks in the late 90s . 
  it is n't correct ? 
  do politicians in greece still see turks as enemies ? 
   better save the fuel turkey u2 \u03b3\u03b5\u03af\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd\u03b1\u03c2 . 
  lots of people got the wrong idea of turks and greeks are still enemies . 
  greece already has a huge airforce and s300 systems anyway . 
  they do n't care as much as avarage redditor cares .
