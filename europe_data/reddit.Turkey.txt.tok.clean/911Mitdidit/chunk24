  islamists are still not allowed in military . 
  its just a legitimate government , no point to overthrow . 
  see u ca n't blame eu for disliking turks . 
  i do n't understand how kuwait , qatar and united arab emirates has the highest perctange for chp votes lol . 
  i do n't think its a great idea to split the country in 3 just because it has a rich culture but i would be more than happy if we get autonomy for each region . 
  diaspora kurds want south east to secede but i 'm not really sure about what kurds in turkey think about this matter . 
  even if they want ( i do n't mind and i actually would be happy for economical reasons ) one thing i 'm sure of is that they will be the most isolated country ever existed in human history . 
  about the liberal vs conservative conflict its nothing crazy at all majority of the people respect their differences even if they do n't get along but then again you are on the internet . 
  people overexaggerate pretty much everything such as akp being islamist , we are about to have civil-war , we support isis , we shoot down russian planes etc. 
  turkish armed forces  deep state  media  cemaat  supreme board of judges and prosecutors  pkk i wonder what 's next . . 
   we have like 80 million people living here . 
  if everyone gives a push i think we can do it . 
  makes perfect sense . 
  at least i feel safe drinking at 3 am while u get stabbed by homeless people in tarlabasi . 
  kilicdaroglu 's chp contained his votes while mhp and hdp had to fk everything up . 
  akp stole their votes how can u blame chp ? 
  the fuck are you talking about !? 
  anatolian side of istanbul is 10 times better than european side and no it has nothing to do with me being from the anatolian side !, 
  it has been discussed before . 
  buying greece or colonizing some other planet would be a cheaper project . 
  get with the times man . 
  only if they are from the cankaya district . 
  aight its time for plan b. http://i.imgur.com/avzojxx.png we can pay your debts btw , what do u think ? 
  being religious has a different meaning for everyone . 
  lots of people call themselves ` very religious ' but drink everynight , have sex without merriage , wearing bikinis , showing clevage and all the other stuff islam bans . 
  dictating your religious laws ( supporting sharia law for exampe ) and lifestyle on the otherhand is what people are concerned about . 
  good guy sero making everyone sure that nobody steals any vote . 
  you are n't talking about their deputies neither . 
  he cant deny the existance of a legitimate government . 
  we cant say anything right now because we dont form the majority . 
  but if we do may god help him preventing whats rightfully ours . 
  thats partly true and which is why i vote for chp in the first place but it doesnt mean mhp is any worse than dictator 's fartlover akp or hdp who sucks terrorist d. 
  4 times here plus the referendum . 
  as i mentioned in my post earlier i do not vote for mhp and definitely not interested with pr for them . 
  its the exact opposite what it says in wikipedia . 
  they used to burn down buldings , kill people etc. 
  now the most crazy thing they do is making silly statements or stupid jokes . 
  as retarded as he sounds i would n't call that extreme these days . 
  in fact he was makin fun of people ( they werent really mhp members ) who attacked the koreans . 
  on the other hand a hdp deputy said kurds and pkk can drown turks with their spit ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwunv_udoni ) . 
  not to mention akp is on a whole a lot of different level with the rest by making retarded statements everyday . 
  i 'm estimating somewhere around 0.000000001 % . 
  sorry i though u are implying ; 1 - chp is liberal when it comes to the social policies but not in the economic field . 
  which is totally wrong after all those projects such as ` merkez t\u00fcrkiye ' and encouraging foreign inverstors and promoting free market . 
  2 - they 're social democratic party so not religious at all . 
  you imply that democrats are irreligious . 
  political views has nothing to do with religion . 
  what does being liberal has anything to do with religion ? 
  it used to be but people finally started to realize that nationalism is banned in islam . 
  actually the exact word is ` racism ' but u cant favour an athiest turk over a muslim arab . 
  ever since we established turkish republic there is this thing called presidency of religious affairs and they control the imams and make their speeches ready for them . 
  so if an imam says ` kill the infidels ' next day there will be an investigation and he 'll probably kicked out . 
  therefore people dont have much clue about islam in turkey and so yeah nationalists were also religious back then but not anymore ( thanks to internet and atheism vs islam debates ) , they are either religious or nationalists now . 
  obviously nationalism but not in an extreme way . 
  they act more like a center right party rather than right wing . 
  its just in the name , everyone thinks mhp is more center party than akp . 
  they are not popular because they dont offer anything but instead support the major parties ( mostly chp and sometimes akp when military action is needed ) . 
  other than that they support chp 's pro-business and liberal policies but dislike the fact chp lifted erdogan 's politics ban . 
  they even allow kurds to join the party in case you wonder if they hate kurds . 
  mhp is secular and pretty much cleaned all the extremists from the party . 
  90 percent of the people who votes for mhp favors secularism over sharia law second only to chp with 92 percent . 
  other than that mhp gets along with chp and they trust each other . 
  the moment both parties mp combined can reach to 276 mp u can expect to see a coalition in the next day . 
  i would like to add more info : akp wins the elections if they get 276 mp . 
  erdogan wins the elections if akp gets 330 mp to change the constitution and the main guy will be president instead of prime minister . 
  other than that as much as i hate akp its kinda unfair to call them islamists . 
  even if they are , they didnt make any laws based on quran or islam when they easly could . 
  chp is pretty much the only sane political party in turkey . 
  mhp is n't ultra nationalist at all . 
  it was horrible in the past but kinda ok atm . 
  hdp is the least secular party in the parliament . 
  their leader demirtas is a good guy and pretty much everything u typed defines him but not the hdp itself . 
  pretty much in all the polls , people who vote for hdp has the highest percantage for supporting sharia law . 
  oh well rip brussels . 
  on a serious note they should watch out for islamists , not to the muslim people who gives a 0 fuck about islamic lifestyle . 
  if i recall correctly from my humanities class during ottoman era christian population was so high , half of the parliament was non-muslim in 1800-1900s but we still had sharia law . 
  right now christian population is bellow 1 percent and we dont have a sharia law . 
  not to mention the most islamist party akp in turkey made 0 law based on quran or islam in 13 years . 
   majority of the ** people ** ( including conservatives , nationalists , democrats and liberals ) ususally ** think ** that we should send 4-5 divisions and wipe everyone ( especially isis and pkk ) out '' inside our borders '' . 
  there are pkk camps in turkey around hakkari and \u015f\u0131rnak provinces tho . 
  its not like a military base obviously they would get bombed the shit out therefore they are operating in caves in those mountains . 
  truth is akp is letting these events happen just to proove to the people ` see everything is worse now since the last elections , we need to be in power without coalition ' . 
  i hope this backfires to them this sunday . 
  other than that majority of the people ( including conservatives , nationalists , democrats and liberals ) ususally think that we should send 4-5 divisions and wipe everyone ( especially isis and pkk ) out '' inside our borders '' and then send all the refugees back to syria with the famous ` safe zone or refugee cities inside syria ' . 
  but akp wants to expand this over syria and iraq but they dont have the balls to make that call because many soliders will die during this operation for the future of kurds and syrians . 
  everytime our parliament authorized the military to do this , people freaked out all over the country , saying ` what the fuck are we doing in syria or iraq , politicans should send their children to fight if they are so eager to fight inside foreign countries ' . 
  thats pretty much why we had to supply fsa lunatics to make them fight for our interests . 
  its the perspective . 
  buses also look very small in the photo while their size are this much big . 
  we had our first islamist party in the parliament in the 90s and got shut down due to their islamic activites . 
  then they played the victim and won the elections in early 2000s . 
  even tho muslim population is low in belguim u better watch out . 
  these guys have no ethics and would do anything to reach their goal . 
  absolutely stunning and brave . 
  he was about to finish his nasheed single . 
  no isis summer hits for next year . 
  as if all israelis are racist . 
  there is no country w/o racist people . 
  i 'm sure racist population in turkey is bigger than entire israel population . 
  serves him right .
