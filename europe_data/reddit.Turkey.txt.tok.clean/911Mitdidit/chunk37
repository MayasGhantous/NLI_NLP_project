  do you think any country from any continent with greek majority population can join the eu ? 
  then why did cyprus allowed to jump in ? 
  it is 100 percent in asia . 
  that 's the joke . 
  turkey is considered as an infidel western puppet country in the muslim world . 
  non of them are eu members . 
   president himself equated drinking outside during ramadan with the attack . 
  this is incorrect . 
  he said both parties are at fault because of the hostile conversation in between groups . 
  oh please . 
  back then we used to mesaure the progressiveness of cities via getting weird looks or not if you eat/drink on ramadan . 
  at the moment deputy prime minister literally called isis to the people who started a fight against a group who drink alcohol . 
  people think that turkey is getting more intolerant or conservative have absolutely zero clue about the 20-30 years ago . 
  a massive group of people burned down a hotel chanting allahu akbar and our female prime minister ( turkey was so progressive in 90s they had female pm omg ) said ' i hope ** the people outside of the hotel ** are okay ' . 
  what makes you say that ? 
  there are nearly thousand five star hotels and complexes in turkey . 
  you do the math . 
  can confirm , i launched two rockets on a kurdish neighborhood when driving back to home last night . 
  first the great hunger and now this . 
  you owe us two ireland . 
  not really , there are '' conserative gays '' who are best friends forever with erdogan . 
  it is a matter of taking sides rather than sexual identites . 
  no need to distort the reality just because the guy above you is being dick . 
  greek civilization is what created and shaped the europe to what it is now . 
  topic for today is of course getting equal rights such as merriage , adoption etc. 
  but that can be counted as progressive speech for 15 years ago . 
  i do n't think eu is that stupid . 
  the effects would be short term due to geographic location of turkey and the results would be bad for eu aswell . 
  i do n't think everyone would be happy losing 800 bn large economic partner in eu . 
  turkey would bring massive intel , technology and strategies to russia and china . 
  might aswell as veto any nato expansion . 
  not to mention , usa sanctioned selling arms to turkey in the 70s or 80s and look what happened to turkish military today for example . 
  i tried to imply that they were slaves by ` they are not freeborn ' . 
  you keep saying the same thing for a month . . you have no stick . 
  just ask ` what would be the effects on greek or bulgarian economy if eu sanctions turkey ' to someone who has a little bit knowledge about economy or you know just a brain . 
  i do n't know the etymology but it is some sort of system which is basically taking christian kids from vassal states and raising them as high ranking government officials . 
  this way the khan/sultan can execute them without trial since they are not freeborn . 
  wich part is the truth ? 
   erdogan getting erection over the event just because he does n't drink , does n't mean he is happy about it . 
  he regularly visits bars and restuarants which serves alcohol and his top journalists ( or more like minnions tbh ) go to debates with whiskey bottles . 
   no more german tourists since 90s . 
  i 've seen it in 2010 . germans have the highest numbers of tourists in turkey for decades not russians . 
   terror attacks every week also incorrect . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:terrorist_incidents_in_turkey_by_year there has been some attacks but i wonder how many months could hungary survive if they shared border with syria and iraq . 
  in 90s we had less than 10 million tourists each year and last year we had 40 million tourists so your argument is pointless . 
  the selection of the news are getting worse day by day . 
  at this point i would n't be surprised to see news like ' a random turkish citizen hates atheists so fuck turkey ' . 
  someone should open r/shitonturkey or something like that so people can get it over with it . 
  you 're welcome . 
  if we combine our powers we can defeat that dick . 
  it already happened several times in taksim . 
  im fact the biggest lgbt parade in se happened in taksim . 
  it is however a risky place and takes too much effort to secure the area for large meetings where 100k + people attend . 
  there was an another parade 2 weeks ago on an akp majority city . 
  it is not allowed in the taksim square . 
  there was another lgbt parade in denizli last week for example . 
  not the best year for meetings in istanbul but i wonder if they will ban all kind of meetings . 
  probably not . . 
  not even per capita actually . 
  * grabs popcorn *, 
  they do n't even know what these terms means . 
  i do n't deny the genocide . 
  i 'm just explaining the perspective of the turkish people . 
  the event was called ` zorunlu g\u00f6\u00e7 / tehcir ' ( forced emigration ) but it ended up millions of innocent people dying . 
  however . . i fail to understand the big difference in between those two events . 
  millions of turks are forced to move away from balkans ( the population of bulgaria dropped to 3 million from 4.5 million for example ) and millions of turkish civilians are killed . 
  i guess it is n't called genocide when you wipe out ( literally ) one city at a time . 
  armenian genocide view has nothing to do with erdogan . 
  there are still millions of families in turkey who fled/forced to leave from balkans . 
  it is the same case with armenians . 
  a million armenians forced emigrate just like millions of turks from the balkans . 
  thousands of armenians died during the event just like millions of turks in the balkans therefore the term genocide will not be accepted by the majority in turkey . 
   erdogan has full control over the media , this is not correct . 
  top 5 newspapers ; http://i.imgur.com/nnlvuje.png as for social media , opposition is dominant in nearly ever single turkish online platform . 
   economy yes or no , basically shitting on the eu by openly saying `` get fucked brahs '' ( not a quote obv . ), 
  and still getting what he wants is a sure way to impress all the voters in turkey , who value a `` strongman '' . 
  erdogan had the record numbers of members of parliament when he was best friends forever with the eu . 
  he could even change the constitution without referandum . 
  now he does n't even have numbers to go for referandum and in fact he could n't form a government in 7 june 2015 elections . 
   grounded in article 14 of the universal declaration of human rights 1948 , which recognizes the right of persons to seek asylum from persecution in other countries , the united nations convention relating to the status of refugees , adopted in 1951 , is the centrepiece of international refugee protection today . 
  the convention entered into force on 22 april 1954 , and it has been subject to only one amendment in the form of a ** 1967 protocol , which removed the geographic and temporal limits of the 1951 ** . 
  dude its not like i do n't respect your opinion or anything but in 1967 your country said they would take the refugees in . 
  it 's only natural for you to not want 3 million refugees in your country but you say italy has no obligation while turkey has . 
  its simply not true . 
  in fact it 's the exact opposite . 
   do not foul me on kurds saying they are your best allies . 
  it is a fact . 
  go ask barzani . 
   erdogan closed the border at kobane cutting their retreat and their reinforcements from tukish kurds , letting them being slaughtered . 
  do you negate this ? 
  it is not a crime . 
  turkey like any other nation has every right to open and close its borders especially to foreign military units . 
  not sure about that . 
  economy became the most important factor in turkish politics after decades long economic crises . 
  there are many conservative parties in turkey and non of them get any votes . 
  erdogan 's party did n't actually solve the issue but they took all the credits in 2002 . so there is this perception and they also did n't fucked it up for nearly 15 years . 
  one could declare islamic state or ban islam as long as the economy is good , people would n't care . 
  ataturk is our national hero and erdogan is our current president . 
  technically speaking yes those countries have to take them . 
  now now i 'm not argueing if it 's the right thing or wrong thing to do but it is just a simple fact .
