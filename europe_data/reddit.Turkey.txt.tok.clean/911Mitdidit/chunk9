  my theory is that if you act super nice to the people or governments they feel ashamed for not answering your demand or threating you badly and i believe this worked for gezi because people prevented retards from doing retarded stuff . 
   there can very little difference in daily life of a normal person in totalitarian versus properly functioning non-totalitarian system . 
  i 'm sure they have a thing to say . 
  you go ahead and tell that to the people who actually live or lived in the totalitarian regimes . 
  you are confusing erdogan 's possible intentions with what he is doing right now . 
  as i stated above i attended to the protests along with millions of people which led him to lose the majority in the parliement for the next the elections . 
  what do you think happened to the opposition parties or their openly supporters ? 
  nothing , he simply just said i respect the election results and hope to form a coalition which was a lie but its not something a totalitar dictator would say or do . 
  a totalitarian regime would simply ban the opposition or install puppet/fake opposition parties like russia , azerbaijan , iran , syria etc. 
  as far as i know even pkk did n't declare war on turkey ( which is of course a lie but nvm ) . 
  the only country or armed group who declared war on turkey is isis and they declared war on half of the world so , not sure if it should be taken serious . 
  i know it sounds shitty on the media and all but the reality is so different . 
  i 'm 25 years old and i traveled half of this country . 
  the scariest thing government ever did to me was that one night a police officer asked for my driving license and wished me a good evening afterwards and that was all . 
  if i never read the news i do n't even notice the existance of the government . 
  and yes i attended to the gezi park protests for like 15-20 days and i saw lots of police officers aswell and that was also scary . 
  its pretty clear that this peace process thing was abused and pkk geared up for a civilwar at this timeline ( for 5 years ) which they eventually failed . 
  they planned to the same thing in syria ( we fight against evil people for our freedom ) did n't really work out since turkish security forces risked their lives and shield themselves for the kurdish civilians during these operations and vast majority of the locals welcomed them in their homes . 
  also the things you see in cizre is the direct result of this retarded so called peace process . 
  for more you can read this post after the second paragraph ; https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/469nk5/explosion_in_turkish_capital_ankara/d03itox we had 3 kurdish presidents and our current deputy prime minister is a proud kurdish ( he says all the time ) and speaks kurdish on live tv and to the press . 
  well the thing is pkk uses civilians as human shield while security forces make themselves shield to the civilians . 
  technically speaking , they are not the same . 
  its just turkish fb servers going crazy due to the incident , there is no ban . 
  what kind of fucked up argument is that ? 
  should we also attack lets say german or french police officers because their administrations have links with pkk ? 
  a group which carried also suicide bombing in turkey multiple times . 
  - hey officer i did n't mean to . . + yeah right . . you 're like the 50th person who denied it today but your excuse was the worst . 
  yea it was just great yesterday and this morning but suddenly its kinda cold again . 
  you block the cold airwave and we block the refugees , deal ? 
  it was like 27 degrees yesterday . 
  you do n't take gdp per capita to measure anything other than gdp per capita . 
  libya is like a city of turkey , you ca n't compare them . 
  plus i do n't think qatar or luxembourg are strong countries , they are just rich . 
  i 'm not sure if we do n't even have a public diplomacy department at all or if we are downright stupid who ca n't even present themselves but these kind of comments drive me crazy . 
  is this hollande guy responsible for isis attack in france ? 
  france supplied fsa like 2-3 more times than turkey and messed up with lots of countries right ? 
  so it must be his fault not the terrorists . . i would like to clarify that erdogan is at fault somehow because of the so called peace process . 
  pkk was nearly disbanded before erdogan got elected . 
  he let these terrorist scumbags to form up again just to show that he is so pro-kurd and he stayed in power with kurdish votes for more than 10 years . 
  especially last 4-5 years were complete shitshow . 
  military forces were banned from taking action against pkk without the approval of the governor . 
  they saw terrorists moving arround from the termal cameras and stuff but they could n't take action and pkk geared up so much over these years , they carry these attacks now . 
  edit : oh yeah i forgot to mention that freaking pkk members were eyewitnesses in the turkish court and high ranked turkish military officers and even lots of generals were sent to jail by the testimony of pkk members . 
  i have a shitty memory so there were more fucked up stuff but i ca n't really remember all of them . 
  i use dns to access to the banned websites . 
  vpn and tor do n't save you if goverment really wants to find you . 
  there was a huge wall of text on this matter by the owner of one of the most popular turkish websites who worked for microsoft in the past . 
  `` we 've gone from 2,500 arrivals per day on the islands to around 200 . 
  yesterday evening nearly zero arrived ... it 's too early to draw conclusions , but it confirms that turkey holds the key to the influx , '' he said . 
  your welcome . 
  `` greece has honoured its commitments -- we expect that others do the same , we must see if europe wants to keep its sense of solidarity , or become a space where everyone wants to shut themselves in their own little castles . '' yeah right . . good luck with that . 
  no , why ? 
  you just have to use open dns . 
  oh i got this all wrong , sorry about that . 
  bahar means spring ( as a season ) in turkish . 
  pretty sure its illegeal to share it . 
  i 've seen links everywhere but i do n't wan na get charged for cyber terrorism or something like that . 
  acting against national security is serious shit in here . 
  it does n't even matter if you accidently clicked it , share it or wan na make news for your newspaper . 
  you are even in deep shit if someone else commits a crime when connected to your wi-fi . 
  pretty sure you get more information on her/his facebook or instagram page than police . 
  assuming all of this thing is true and you are older than five years . . yeah you probably are . 
  tldr : they released the encrypted 2010 database from the turkish police . 
  some say it was leaked by the guy who made the database long ago and it kinda makes sense since we can only see the data from 2010 . when people decrypte the file ( again some people claim they did ) they can reach to the id cards of turkish citizens and their home adresses and stuff like that . 
  so it has nothing to do with ` government corruption ' but potential risk for those who had psycho ex-boy/girlfriends . 
  we take this chart over ` turks genocide kurds ' anyday . 
  seems like a perfect place to get high . 
  valley means koyak in turkish but nearly everyone uses the word vadi which has arabian or persian origin . 
  but france is in the family , who cares about what happens to the turks . 
  turkey should just let russia and her allies do whatever they like and send half of the syrian population to turkey but at the same time turkey must stop them from reaching to the eu member countries . 
  oh also do n't mess with kurds and let them reach to the mediterranean sea because we ca n't arm them enough to fight with turkey when they are land locked . 
  - ** in the past : ** nemesis : russian scum closest rival : venice - ** rigth now : ** worst enemy : russia rival : used to be greece until they bankrupt . 
  good god , what have we ever done to you ? 
  except that one time invasion or two . 
  ^ no ^ ottomans ^ doesnt ^ count . 
  ` with military force ' for more than thousand years . 
  really ? 
  as for rojava its a single party dictatorship . 
  who is the main opposition ? 
  i will buy that ` we are so progressive omg ' shit when you stop arresing kdp members . 
  do you have eyes ? 
  what the fuck is ypg doing in tel abyad and why are they moving towards aleppo ? 
  if anyone who fights with isis automatically becomes a good guy we should give nobel peace prize to anyone in the middle east including al-qaeda . 
  yeah you would know better than the kurds . 
  every kurd claims it as a brother/sister group and to be honest they do n't have to be the same group to be a threat to turkey . 
  http://www.todayszaman.com/diplomacy_turkish-military-seizes-us-made-uav-in-anti-pkk-operation_410258.html i 'm assuming ypg did n't give this drone to pkk , its santa 's christmas gift right ? 
  i 'm assuming you are just doing this to piss me off . 
  http://www.turkhukuksitesi.com/showthread.php?t=8524 read all of it , instead of just the headline . 
   ceasefire has been agreed on . 
  ceasefire with who lmao . 
  putin said he will bomb every opposition except ypg . 
   any comments on `` not participating in the civil war '' ? 
  i literally said turkey sent weapons to turkmen groups at above so turkey is involved in a way but its nothing comparable to saa , fsa , russia or other factions . 
   it 's new . 
  in the 90s , turkish tv broadcasting was way more liberal . 
  you can see the difference if you watch nostalgic videos from youtube . 
  not really putting a foreign erotic movie after 00.00 does n't make any liberal . 
  90s tv-shows were 10 times more conservative compared to today . 
   still , it 's a stupid ban . 
  what 's the point ?
