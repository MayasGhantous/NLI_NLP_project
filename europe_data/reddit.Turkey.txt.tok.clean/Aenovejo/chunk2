  how much for a meal like that , burger + chips + beverage ? 
  i 'll definitely go to riga and vilnius . 
  i have friends there ( both ) so it 'll be fun . 
  i 'm saving your recommendations for later use , they sound really nice . 
  thanks !, 
  i 'll be at tallinn university . 
  i 'm really excited for the city and country . 
  what 's a non-popular , rare thing to do , see or eat there ? 
  nice experience !, 
  i 'm actually going to tallinn next year . 
  i hope it goes well . 
  you 're welcome , european bro, 
  because your vote is already counted in `` 2 '' . 
  so it 's ( 1 your vote + 1 other vote ) . 
  when you down vote yourself , your vote goes from 1 to -1 , so ( -1 your vote + 1 other vote ) equals zero . 
  unless i 'm missing something , you 're talking about this ? 
  i think in most languages , a to english , english to b works much better than a to b. 
  except probably close , same family languages , it works this way better . 
  that 's no moon . . it 's a space station .

  edit : http://imgur.com/a/x6v8i nestl\u00e9 , you 're next !, 
  no , but apparently she is emine 's favourite actress . 
   to be honest though , inonu supporting the coup and military made him an easy target for islamists . 
  yes . 
  to be honest it was a very hard decision , i presume . 
  inonu could either stay silent about the junta 's activities or trust menderes and make the junta public . 
  which would presumably followed by a purge of officers in the military and arresting of the opposition . 
  i think it 's hard to trust menderes when there is a [ committee ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/committee_of_inquest ) in the parliament whose mission is to control chp 's `` dangerous activities '' . 
  if there was no coup , chp was favorable to win the next elections , but if the `` coup attempt '' was made public , menderes could gain votes because of it . 
  the primary mistake was not preventing the executions of the government officials . 
  he did try to prevent by sending letter to the coup leaders , but if he had defended them publicly , officers would have no chance but listening to him . 
  and he would maybe be remembered as a democrat . 
  same as inonu . 
  successor of ataturk . 
  he was the right hand man of ataturk through the independence war , signed lausanne treaty , lead the nation through ww2 , allowed greater democratization and liberalization after the war . 
  none of his reforms or actions are or have been supported by the people and for a very long time islamist people scapegoated him to criticize kemalists , since they could n't attack atat\u00fcrk publicly . 
  i 'm not saying inonu is the best , i do n't support most of his actions too , but he is not that bad , especially when you look at the late turkish politicians . 
  yes , turkish secularism is directly influenced by the french . 
  almost all intellectual movements in turkey is directly influenced by the french . 
  we call it `` laiklik '' in turkish , from `` la\u00efcit\u00e9 '', 
  it could be that , but it could also be our mental understanding . 
  the person who made this image is most probably ( 99 % ) learned to write right-to-left first . 
  maybe a person whose mother language is arabic would comment on that better though . 
  also rise of political islam in turkey takes it 's roots from us-turkish governmental efforts of countering ultra-nationalism and communism . 
  in my experience , ( my experience is not radical muslims , but regular muslims ) people tend to think of good parts of islam , when they think of islam . 
  so you can ask them if they want to be ruled by islamic law . 
  if they say yes , it does n't mean they would want harsh punishments for non-muslim people , taxes for non-muslims etc. 
  they would n't even think of punishment types like stoning , beheading , etc. 
  they think `` those are the products of their time ( 600s ) and we should n't use the historical applications of the religion word by word , we should update them with contemporary life-style and knowledge '' ( not update the religion , but update the application . ), 
  on the other hand , i think there 's a really fast radicalization of religious people and akp supporters , without even control of akp . 
  using fear and victimization every day , will be very bad for our country someday when all of them are getting out of their hand . 
  i think these borders ( and other limitations comes with sevres ) would only lead to a turanist-fascist government to emerge just like germany and they would be allies of germany in wwii . 
  and then it would be `` liberated '' by soviets and turkey would be a communist/red state like most other eastern european countries . 
  not in normal circumstances . 
  i mean whoever wins this referendum , results will be very close . 
  so you ca n't arrest % 50 of the population . 
  also votes are secret and people are generally respectful of each other 's democratic rights on voting days . 
  there are radical people who are n't but i 'm speaking of general public , without any party affiliation . 
  in some rural areas , disputes between voters happen but that is more common in local elections . 
  it exactly means `` woman that is aged beautifully , got prettier with age '' . 
  so it is n't much different than `` to be aged like wine '' in english . 
  usa was the superpower of the world in 1970s . 
  did they win in vietnam ? 
  arrested people can vote . 
  only people serving their sentence can not vote during their imprisonment . 
  these guys wo n't be convicted , but even if they eventually would , there is n't enough time until referendum too finish their cases . 
  so it 's not that . 
  it 's just this time they are really worried that it 's gon na be hay\u0131r .

  maybe . 
  the situation today , is what he gained by the coup attempt . 
  all those executive orders , purges , being immune to opposition , martial law , all of them are what he gained in 15 july . 
  we call it futbol , as you can see , so i do n't know why they translated like that . 
  i really really suggest [ denge oyunu ] ( http://www.idefix.com/kitap/denge-oyunu-2-dunya-savasinda-turkiyenin-dis-politikasi/selim-deringil/arastirma-tarih/tarih/cumhuriyet-tarihi/urunno=0000000056808 ) by selim deringil if you 'd like to explore more about this . 
  it tells the details of political discussion inside turkey about ww2 . 
  they were of course scared that nazis will attack turkey , and they were more scared that , if nazis attacked , soviets will `` save '' turkey . 
  from 1941 nazi-turk non-aggression pact to battle of stalingrad , nazi sympathizers in turkey make turkey really close to joining the war on axis side . 
  ( and inonu must also consider the chance of nazis taking down russia , so he can not go full against nazis . ), 
  also it 's strange to see so many nazi sympathizers in ankara during the war . 
  according to deringil , nazis had a great network of spies ( mostly turkish ) in ankara and they were doing propaganda against western powers . 
  these guys were hoping by allying with germans , after russia has been defeated , nazis will give turkey the turan lands . 
  there were parties thrown in ankara after every nazi victory , with fireworks and stuff . 
  cumhuriyet was also a nazi sympathizer back then . 
  [ greetings from kemalist turkey to fascist italy !, 
  ] ( https://www.wikisosyalizm.org/images/a/a5/fa%c5%9fizm_t%c3%bcrkiye2.jpg ) [ praising varl\u0131k vergisi ] ( http://www.salom.com.tr/uploads/news/b_080220168uc51b0yvkc6neju4jsqjsser.jpg ) [ an article praising german war efforts and total war ] ( http://tarih.blogbartu.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/img_0223-768x576.jpg ) my point is that it 's a very interesting subject that we do n't hear much about . 
  we probably do n't want to admit that we were really close with germany even though we were allied with britain and france . 
  and this book is a great read all around . 
  edit : i assumed you know turkish , so i linked turkish version of the book , but for everyone interested , here 's a rather expensive [ english version . 
  ] ( https://www.amazon.com/turkish-foreign-policy-during-second/dp/052152329x/ref=asap_bc?ie=utf8 ) highly recommended . 
  read hitler-in\u00f6n\u00fc letters , even they talk about germans and turks fighting together in the last war together and not wanting to be enemies this time . 
  so they talk about it like that too . 
  no but , he 's saying `` seeing fascism in rotterdam is mad '' not `` turks are mad , for seeing fascism in rotterdam '' . 
  there is no need to make a blanket statement , when instead you can focus on the problem . 
   if most of turkish people are ok with this then who we are to complain ?
