  i didnt pick one . 
  just saying it will not mean war when incidents like this happen between two nato ally . 
  also two jets crash into each other not down by a missile . 
  read the article before you post . 
  both nato countries . 
  and got border , airspace problems about aeagen border . 
  its not a functioning mosque . 
  its a museum . 
  nope http://www.f-16.net/f-16-news-article619.html  a former turkish naval commander confirmed on monday that a greek warplane had shot down a turkish f-16 fighter in the aegean in 1996 . 
  the incident , which cost the life of one of the two turkish pilots , captain nail erdogan , was attributed to an accident at a time of heightened tension . 
  yeah after locked in and fired at turkish airspace . 
  http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/downed-russian-jet-violated-turkish-air-space-nato.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=91633&amp;newscatid=352 this russki wan na be nationalists lol . . edit : nice `` remove kebab '' flair still listening this ? 
  http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/59bf/production/_85957922_syria_us_russian_airstrikes_624.png russian bombings at syria . 
  they not really bombing daesh/isis . 
  more like they 're covering assad . 
  yeah also downing a plane in his airspace also only turkish problem . 
  ca n't understand why everyone butthurt about this . 
  its not like turkey downed a malaysian civilian plane and killed 290 civs . 
  turkey did change his engagement rules after 2012 tho . 
  now shit got serious . 
  just one i guess http://www.f-16.net/f-16-news-article619.html  a former turkish naval commander confirmed on monday that a greek warplane had shot down a turkish f-16 fighter in the aegean in 1996 . 
  the incident , which cost the life of one of the two turkish pilots , captain nail erdogan , was attributed to an accident at a time of heightened tension . 
  since when serbia discuss about nato matters lol . 
  stop your remove kebab song and read this to remember https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_deliberate_force also cyprus not an nato member , neither you . 
  nope just a coincidence, 
  meh they are some teen 's not knowing about nato history . 
  turkey and usa was two sides of the nato since 1950 's . 
  korean war , cuban missile crisis etc. 
  and also bordering russia and soviets since beginning of cold war to russian crimea situation, 
  which , they did before http://www.f-16.net/f-16-news-article619.html  a former turkish naval commander confirmed on monday that a greek warplane had shot down a turkish f-16 fighter in the aegean in 1996 . 
  the incident , which cost the life of one of the two turkish pilots , captain nail erdogan , was attributed to an accident at a time of heightened tension .

  none of them is serious . 
  maybe other countries see greece and turkey as a historical enemy - rival etc.but none of the countries people did not think like this . 
  we are bros after all . 
  lol, 
  yeah i like how russian kiddos trying to kicking someone out of nato . 
  ca n't find exact source but ; mostly on seaside , high educated and seculer profile is voting for chp far left-wing and kurds voting for hdp conservatives and some nationalist vote for akp far right-wing nationalist vote for mhp and there 's even a akp minister statement that ; when education levels goes up our votes are going down . 
  also greece violates turkish airspace all the time . 
  its because of the aegean border is just so fucking complicated . 
  its ' not like this at syrian border . 
  it 's not . 
  since like 3-4 weeks turkish military keep asking for stop the border violations at syrian border . 
  they even called russian ambassador for this situation last week . 
  tell me one thing about turkey being not seculer in practice . 
  so is japan too . wow the more you know !, 
  no man its mongolia amirightguys ? 
  we are not asking for it we made a deal for it . 
  if you cant handle it cancel the deal so everyone can get what they want . 
  this . 
  fuck off erdogan just let the immigrants go where ever they want no one cares . 
  it 's a schengen area deal.plus its just a tourist visa for 6 months top . 
  we 've seen enough coup 's to know what it really means . 
  guns never good for anyone . 
  i hate erdogan more than you can imagine but i 'm not gon na support a idiotic coup . 
  well https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_shootings_at_parliament_hill,_ottawa, 
  can you give me a source ?
