  it 's absurd . 
  if the eu keeps doing nothing in support of the refugee crisis in turkey , jordan and lebanon , eu should definitely expect many more refugees . 
  imagine the butthurtness of the europeans when turkey starts flooding the eu with hundreds of thousands of refugees . 
  that would have been beautiful, 
  nah , the other europe, 
  i really do n't understand why we are trying to stop them . 
  we should just let them go to europe . 
  are you being serious ? 
  great logic right there, 
  world war 3 - europe 's awakening-immigrantic boogalo, 
  deport to where ? 
  how do you deport someone who was born here ? 
  also , we too , do n't want those people . 
  just throw them into prisons and do us all a favour . 
  edit : it 's back again .

  yea , how dare we . 
  as if 2 million refugees from syria and irak are n't enough for us . 
  sorry , but if a bunch of savages were jumping onto my car , trying to smash the windows and beat me up with metal bars , you can bet i would drive them all over . 
  it 's called `` defending yourself '' ( notwehr ) . 
   all the `` armed wing 's '' head are all mit or mit sleepers or friends of mit . 
  just like pkk then ? 
  seriously dude , i do n't want to insult you , but i seriously see no point in arguing with such clueless and ignorant people as you . 
  where was the swiss police when [ pkk kurds were cowardly lynching random turks ( including a young girl ) and attacking their cars in bern a few days ago ?? 
  ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/turkey/comments/3l10e5/hdpkk_sympathisants_attack_long_version/ ) if it was n't for those 2 heroes who drove their cars into the pkk crowd they would have killed those turks they were lynching . 
  the police ca n't always protect you . 
  you have seriously no fucking idea what you are talking about . 
  the grey wolves have nothing to do with erdogan and his party ( akp ) . 
  the grey wolves are the armed wing of the nationalist party called mhp ( turkey 's third biggest party ) . 
  bahceli ( the head of mhp ) recently even said that he will let the grey wolves march towards erdogans palace if the current situation seriously escalates . 
  i 'm glad they exist , because the grey wolves are the only ones who will protect the diaspora turks when it comes to shit like this . 
  pkk is a kurdish terrorist organization .

  meh , i do n't mind / u/helpasaddoge following me around , because he always gets ridiculed . 
  it 's entertaining seeing him so butthurt . 
  seems like he has some anger issues . 
  poor kid, 
  sure buddy . 
  that 's a sick thought . 
  we all are the same , including you !, 
  i agree . 
  their behaviour is just embarassing , but there is not much i can do . 
   someone spotted the fight from the other side of the stadium and decided to join in by running across the pitch , while the game was still on . 
  hahaha , that 's so turkish, 
  this is simply not true . 
  there is a conflict going on between the turkish state & pkk , but [ that 's nothing new ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkey%e2%80%93pkk_conflict ) . 
  the situation is similar to the israeli-palestinian conflict . 
  but that 's far away from being a civil war . 
  why would you want to see your own country go to shit ? 
  you are no better than those immigrants you dislike so much , if not even worse . 
   `` i and that other guy ( probably ) have been living in europe for several years now but now i 'm gon na go fuck him up because of his nationality , i.e. 
  because of his place of birth . '', 
  did i get this right ? 
  no , you did n't get it right . 
  they are fighting because of this : [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkey%e2%80%93pkk_conflict] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkey%e2%80%93pkk_conflict ), 
   one turk drove his car through a group of kurds . 
  after kurds were attacking his car with metal bars . 
  why those statistics are utter bullshit : [ http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2011/feb/11/islam-population] ( http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2011/feb/11/islam-population ) [ http://blogs.reuters.com/faithworld/2011/01/27/will-pew-muslim-birth-rate-study-finally-silence-the-eurabia-claim/] ( http://blogs.reuters.com/faithworld/2011/01/27/will-pew-muslim-birth-rate-study-finally-silence-the-eurabia-claim/ ), 
  yea , because germany is slowly becoming like turkey . 
  every d\u00f6ner you eat turns you slowly into a turk . 
  germany will be turkey 2.0 in about 50 years . 
  a random abstract from a random dude , what am i supposed to do with that ? 
  it 's just south eastern turkey . 
  that region has always been a shithole, 
  ataturk was n't even ruling turkey while the armenians and turks were killing each other en masse . 
  ataturk had nothing to do with the armenian genocide . 
  please educate yourself before talking about things you have no idea about . 
  usa = / = europe . 
  the turks/kurds who immigrate to the us are mostly educated people , while the ones who go to europe are mostly poor , uneducated and conservative . 
  also , usa is n't that xenophobic as europe , since the entire nation was build by immigrants . 
  people tend to assimilate & integrate faster and better , when they also get treated better . 
   caliphate is just a foreign sounding word for state you have no idea what you are talking about, 
   so you are saying , because some pkk members dress as civilians , turkey is free to kill every kurdish civilian because he could be pkk ? 
  where did i say that ? 
  do you have reading comprehension problems ? 
   back then there was nothing like democracy in the middle east . 
  even ataturk was a dictator who didnt allow anyone to rule except himself . 
  being a dictator does n't automaticaly mean bad . 
  a benevolent dictator can be one of the best government types if needed . 
  sometimes , democracy , secularism & progressivity must be forced upon the population . 
  and ataturk knew that . 
  without him , turkey today would probably have been like iran . 
  [ classic civilians ] ( https://i.imgur.com/vvebrgh.jpg ) imaginge immigrants in europe going around like this on the streets , with ak 's and rpg 's . 
   if you see yourself as a german of turkish ( or whatever ) descent ; i am fine by that . 
  but if you view yourself as a turk ( or whatever ) living in germany ; that is not the way it should go . 
  you guys have a different understanding of what defines your national identity . 
  according to you guys ; you are that , in what state you live ( you live in germany --  you are german ) . 
  according to us , you are that , what your parents are ( your parents are turkish --  you are turkish ) . 
   let 's say that both sides are at fault to an extent i agree . 
  generally , it 's always both sides , and never just one side . 
   while i am a nationalist myself i do n't understand the phenomenon of having nationalism for a country you left . 
  generally , immigrants tend to be more nationalistic and idiotic than the people in the countries they left . 
  it 's a phenomenon which can be easily explained , but i 'm too lazy for that right now . 
  i 'm sure you can find a good article about that if you google it . 
   keep that at home i agree . 
  i 'm not a fan myself of those immigrants , or `` kanaken '' as you probably call them sometimes . 
  did you watch the video ? 
  one of those cars was being attacked before he drove them over . 
  the other one was a little bit more clever , as he did n't let the kurds come any closer . 
  also , you can clearly see those kurds lynching someone .
