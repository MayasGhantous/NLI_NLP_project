  stop defending those idiots , because they are clearly the ones who are causing the trouble , and you know it . 
  that 's the fault of the german/french/etc state . 
  if you fail to integrate the immigrants , it 's the state 's fault , not the fault of those immigrants . 
  especially france does a shit poor job at this . 
  you need some love ? 
  i already did . 
  if you watch the full video you will see that those `` peaceful '' kurds were attacking random cars only because turks were in it . 
  you can even see them lynching an old turkish guy on the street . 
  the car who drove over them was just trying to protect himself and his family . 
  you can watch the full video here [ https://np.reddit.com/r/turkey/comments/3krqkp/more_proof_kurdish_fascist_pkk_terrorist_attack/] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/turkey/comments/3krqkp/more_proof_kurdish_fascist_pkk_terrorist_attack/ ), 
   yes , they should think as german when thinking as themselves , thats succesfull integration that 's not integration , that 's called assimilation . 
  you can be integrated without giving up your identity . 
  sorry , but those kurds who wanted to create a caliphate had the same ideology as the rest of the jihadists . 
  the only progressive caliphate that existed was the ottoman empire , and that was because it was rather a turkish empire than islamic . 
   a car deliberately drove into groups of kurdish protesters in the swiss city of bern the video is not showing the entire video . 
  if you watch the entire video you will see that those `` peaceful '' kurds were attacking random cars only because turks were in it , while chanting `` kill them kill them ! '',

  go eat potato, 
  because it 's a shithole ? 
   so your saying that killing children with shotguns is considered normal in turkey ? 
  yea , it 's actually one of my favourite activities . 
  lol no , what i meant with `` normal '' was that fucked up things happen on daily basis here ( like police/soldiers/etc getting killed ) . 
  if something happens everyday , it 's kind of normal , or not ? 
  like suicide bombings in irak for example . 
  suicide bombings are wrong and not normal , but in irak , it 's normal , it happens on daily basis , and everyone is used to it . 
  it happens every day . 
  so it 's considered normal for irak ( but that does n't mean that this would also be considered normal for a different country ) . 
  you know what i mean ? 
  more like kurdish refugees . 
   there have n't been any polls done by neither side . 
  pkk does n't want polls , because it would most likely result in a `` against independece '' majority , and they know that . 
   because if a kid got blown away by a shotgun in london i 'm pretty sure the sky would fall . 
  this is turkey my friend , not london . 
  you ca n't compare turkey with the uk . 
  things happen here on daily basis that are considered normal , but in reality , are n't normal . 
   a civil war is a very likely scenario . 
  probably not though . 
  does n't matter how fucked up our situation was ( 50s-90s ) , the civilian population never really started to kill each other en masse . 
  people here make it like turkish and kurdish civilians would start to kill each other , but that never happened , not even during the peak of turkey-pkk conflict . 
  i 'm not scared of turkish & kurdish civilians starting to kill each other , but what i am scared of is erdogan and his followers . 
  those guys are unpredictable psychopaths and would do everything to stay in power . 
  can we join ? 
  this was after pkk broke the ceasefire , when they killed 2 police officers in their sleep . 
  it was pkk who broke the ceasefire , not turkey . 
  because terrorism is one of the main tactics this group is using for it 's political aims ? 
  pkk delibaretly targets civilians : just a few days ago , [ pkk killed a doctor in diyarbakir .

  you ca n't make terrorism go away , but you can reduce it . 
  israel does an excellent job at this . 
  the only way to handle terrorists is to bomb the living shit out of them, 
  pkk delibaretly targets teachers & doctors who are n't pkk friendly .

  lol , the us and secular . 
  compared to europe , you guys are still backwarded, 
  netherlands , austria , germany , switzerland & norway ( belgium and denmark probably too , but i have n't been there yet ) so , pretty much all `` germanic '' countries . 
  * open minded people * excellent infrastructure * welfare state * good education * progressive * peaceful * drugs * an overall good quality of life, 
  lol, 
  he asked first tho . 
  atleast we have potatoes, 
  give back rhodos !, 
  so what ? 
  just kill random people with full beards , because they may be collaborating with isis ? 
  what the fuck ? 
  those kurds ended the ceasefire by starting to kill turkish civilians and cops . 
  what the fuck did they expect ? 
  turkey is n't going to sit and watch how pkk terrorizes entire towns and cities . 
  of course we are going to retaliate, 
   the kurds ' ideology of secularism and socialism is scary for the leaders of turkey . 
  lol !, 
  kurds are turkey 's most backwarded people . 
  fgm , honour killings , incest are part of their culture . 
  such progressive people !, 
  come and get it, 
  sorry , but this will never happen . 
  as if we want to ... 
  so , thanks turkey ? 
  gypsy pls, 
  the armenian ` genocide ' was also not a genocide . 
  just war, 
  do n't worry neighbour , we are really not interested in invading your country . 
  about 50.000 had attented in 2013 , but not sure about this year . 
  but i guess it was around the same , probably even more .

  i will bring raki . 
  then we can get really warm and drunk too :d, 
  seriously , when i just see 400 $ in my bank account i already feel like a king,

  it 's going to be an akp-mhp coalition . 
  this may sound bad , but it 's still better than akp ruling alone . 
  wikipedia says a lot of crap . 
  mhp may be considered as ` far ' right , but they are n't nearly as bad as akp . 
  in the past , they sucked , yes , but their current leader , devlet bahceli reformed the party to the good . 
  he was the guy who put an end to the right-left conflict , and told it 's followers to stop with the violence and to leave the streets . 
  and atleast , even though mhp is conservative , it has secular tendencies , unlike akp . 
  an akp-mhp coalition is probably still going to be a shit government , but atleast akp wo n't be able to rule alone .
