  you just proved my point . 
  thanks, 
  i do n't understand polish neo nazis . 
  do n't they know what hitler did to them ? 
  it 's like they have never read a history book . 
  i swear , polish far-rights/neo nazis are one of the most retarded people on earth, 
  where did he say such a thing ? 
  deport them to where they came from . 
  yea , that 's why isis declared war on turkey . 
  what a genius you are, 
  seems like they learned from the russian officials . 
  not as much as russian brigading though . 
  i mean , kremlin has an entire troll factory dedicated to spread pro russian propaganda and misinformation all over the internet . 
  [ http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-08-12/inside-russia's-troll-factory-internet-forums-social-media/6692318] ( http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-08-12/inside-russia's-troll-factory-internet-forums-social-media/6692318 ), 
  you got a problem with that ? 
  lmfao , our navy alone is more powerful than the entire dutch military . 
   turkey has couple hundred f-16 's , a jet from the 70 's our f-16s are modernized/upgraded . 
  [ http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/air-space/support/2015/04/12/turkey-receives-last-upgraded-f-16/25679711/] ( http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/air-space/support/2015/04/12/turkey-receives-last-upgraded-f-16/25679711/ ) those f-16s are more advanced and reliable than any other russian jet that exists right now . 
  russia is n't interested in defeating isis tho . 
  they are targeting fsa and other anti-assad rebels , but not isis . 
  yea buddy . 
  turkey is the sole reason for this clusterfuck . 
  you fucking genius you, 
  npd is still by far more stupid . 
  lol sry, 
  russians or persians, 
  russia is trying to destabilize entire europe . 
  lol , no . 
   turks in space lmfao, 
  yea , he should be glad that we did n't annex the entire island , after what they did to the turks there . 
   so this is the guy we want in the eu who is `` we '' ? 
  lol . 
  glad you 're showing your true face, 
   not attacked any civilian institution like a school for many years fucking bullshit .

  oh fuck off dude . 
  this is not the first time pkk has attacked schools . 
  you disgust me, 
  lol no, 
  see it as a further step towards our accession . 
  maybe if we truly get out shit together , it might happen . 
  who knows . 
  but the cyprus re-unification is still a good thing , does n't matter if it affects our accession or not . 
   just simplistically throwing everything to europe wo n't help . 
  it will help turkey tho . 
  sorry , but that does n't even make sense . 
  good for you . 
  because you do n't want 3 million more refugees ? 
  or do you ? 
  lol , as if we care, 
  actually , yes . 
  not sure about free housing , but they do get free education and healthcare . 
  they also get [ work permits ] ( http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkeys-granting-work-permits-to-syrian-refugees-published-officially.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=93905&amp;newscatid=345 ) . 
  because they are fucking refugees . 
  you ca n't fucking send them back to a country where there is a full blown war going on . 
  that 's inhumane , and fucked up . 
  europe should be better than that . 
  turkey already proposed ( several times ) a safe zone inside syria , to settle down some of the refugees there , but the coalition did n't agree on it , and now europe is living the consequences for that . 
  and then turkey decides to send 3 million refugees to europe . 
  have fun with that , you genius, 
  we have close to 3 million refugees . 
  more than entire europe combined . 
  it 's just common sense to send them to europe , if europe does n't want to support us . 
   governments are n't going to kill innocent civilians just because they are in bad terms with their country . 
  neither i , nor he said such a thing . 
  both of us meant the regular citizens , not governments . 
  he meant germans attacking turkish immigrants ( to my understanding ) , and i meant , turkish immigrants defending themselves with also violence . 
  but either way , neither the german government , nor the turkish government would ever let such a thing happen , you are right on this . 
   even the most fascist countries like russia , israel or . . turkey would n't do that . 
  the only real fascist country ( in it 's true definition ) right now is saudi arabia . 
  and look at yourself before you call others stupid . 
  what do the turks in germany have anything to do with syrian refugees there ? 
  you want to punish the turkish immigrants for the incompetence of your own politicians ? 
  if the turkish community in germany got targeted ( in large scale ) , you can expect berlin burning . 
  you do n't want that happen . 
   maybe your government is concerned with the safety of turkish citizens abroad , if you know what i mean no , i really do n't know what you mean . 
  care to elaborate ? 
  i guess it 's time for another refugee wave into eu !, 
  ( : i seriously do n't understand why we are not sending more of those refugees to eu . 
  would be hilarious to see the euros even more mad than right now . 
  you seem ignorant as fuck, 
  to make people like you butthurt, 
  stfu if you ca n't read the article . 
  you 're the fucking liar here, 
  it says right in the title ... do you even understand turkish ? 
  genius, 
  hehe, 
  i do n't understand why we even share intelligence with those countries , if they refuse to do the same with us . 
  they are literally supporting terrorism against us . 
  uk has always been cool to us . 
  france , germany and belgium not so much . 
  i really do n't get it . 
  i also find it funny that those 3 countries prefer more middle eastern refugees in their countries than granting us visa free travelling, 
  i do n't know . 
  turks mostly drink raki and beer . 
  man , they are still sooooo butthurt . 
   it is the central government who decides if a foreign army can enter it 's borders , not some regional government . 
  which central government ? 
  that government whose military ran away and left all it 's military toys to isis ? 
  the iraqi government is an utter joke and failure .
