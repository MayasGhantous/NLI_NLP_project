  britain now dominates a thoroughly stagnated atlantic europe . 
  the most controversial section of the treaty is the article providing that only america will have access to militarize space , while other countries will only be able to have commercial activity . '', 
  assad too buys oil from isis , just sayin, 
  u got a problem ? 
  imagine if erdogan arms the ukrainians , chechens , dagestanis etc. 
  that would also be cool . 
  does russia even have any major trading partners left ? 
  entire europe is sanctioning them , along with the us . 
  it 's only a matter of time that russia goes bankrupt . 
  and being involved in so many conflicts ( ukraine , syria ) is n't really helping their economy . 
  damn , the russians are butthurt . 
  poor poor putin, 
  sure buddy, 
  how exactly is all this relevant to this thread ? 
   you are coming from a country committed genocide in armenia stopped reading your comment after your first sentence . 
  turkey 's version of godwin 's law, 
  russia today went full retard after we shot their jet down . 
  some of the articles they published were seriously laughable . 
  quality journalism right there, 
  i think you may have reading comprehension problems, 
  you have no fucking idea what you are talking about, 
  assad used chemical weapons on his own people . 
  assad is not any better than isis . 
  russia will still keep denying though . 
  remember how they lied that there were no russian soldiers in crimea and ukraine . 
  or how they denied the downing of mh17, 
  ukraine , you have our full support . 
  it was n't the first time though . 
  a few weeks ago turkey complained to the un that russia was violating it 's airspace and that they will do something about it if it continues . 
  russia still continued doing it , and turkey responded this time . 
  and now the russians are whining, 
  `` that will show em ! '', 
  it was just a factory accident ... 
   were n't most of those kurdish protesters ? 
  no , most of them were leftist turks . 
  leftist kurds also died , but most of them were turks . 
   turkey bombs kurds in syria that fight isis turkey never bombed the kurds in syria . 
  turkey bombs pkk positions in ** northern iraq ** . 
  turkey wants assad and the ypg/pkk gone . 
  isis fights against assad and ypg/pkk . 
  so , turkey tolerates isis . 
  for us , it 's basically terrorists killing terrorists . 
  but saying `` turkey supports isis '' is wrong . 
  if they supported isis , why would they bomb and arrest them ? 
  turkey arrested more isis terrorists than any other country . 
  isis also committed the ankara and suruc bombings , which killed about 200 turkish citizens . 
  if turkey really supported isis , why would isis commit those attacks ? 
  isis also said they want to conquer istanbul , along with other european cities . 
  a war between turkey & russia would cause a world war . 
  use your fucking brain before you spew such bullshit, 
  when istanbul burns , moscow burns too . 
  you have no fucking idea what you are talking about, 
  just like mh17 !, 
  armenia has a military ? 
  greece does the same thing ... 
  it 's not even a big deal, 
  you mean mh17, 
   when did russia shoot turkish jet ? 
  they shoot down civilian airliners tho * cough * ^ ^ ^ mh17 * cough *, 
  me too . 
  sometimes , when i 'm in the metro , i wonder what would happen if i suddenly screamed `` allahu akbar ! '', 
  while riding the metro . 
  lol , i 'd probably get beaten up, 
  classic isis supporting turkey ^ ^ / s first they warned france twice about the paris attackers , and now this . 
  it will be da bomb, 
  ** hahahahahahaha **, 
  lmfao indeed my scottish friend so funny im dying right now wow i cant even u such a funny scott, 
   the un predicts sweden to be a third world country in 15 years lmfao, 
  lol , i asked myself this too pretty often . 
  hmmmm dead people , makes me feel warm and fuzzy . 
  nah , dont u know , ataturk was a zionist atheist jew working for the american & european imperialists . 
  some people ( islamists ) seriously believe this , i 'm not joking . 
  a better source would be nice . 
  that 's not even true . 
  funny , when a t\u00fcrke knows more about merkel 's policy than a german living in germany . 
  there even have been wars over it, 
  lol , your article does n't even say that, 
  bulgarian 's are just turks who got christianized  yogurt is definitely a turkish ( central asian ) invention . 
  i read autism and was confused for a few seconds lol, 
  same for me with raki . 
  as a teenager , i nearly died once because of too much raki . 
  since then , i ca n't drink it without puking . 
  alone the smell makes me nauseous . 
  i love vodka tho . 
  but beer is still the best, 
  i laughed too , and then i cried . 
  and then i nearly got a panic attack , i kid you not . 
  they are islamists . 
  i dont know . 
  maybe if we were n't such a backwarded and retarded nation , some would like us ?? 
  even i , as a turk , fucking hate most of my own people . 
  i seriously would n't mind if 50 % of our population just got eradicated, 
  bahceli is one of the most pathetic politicians of turkey , along with erdogan . 
  fuck this country, 
  yea , because afghanistan is so safe and peaceful . 
  greece or georgia edit : oh shit , totally forgot azerbaijan lol . 
  azerbaijan number one neighbour, 
   yes geopolitics do in fact care about emotions . 
  not really . 
  if you really think so , you have no idea .
