  tengri is our god , you guys are just jelly . 
  turkish word for `` god '' is `` tanr\u0131 '' which comes from `` tengri '' .

  [ they demolished a historic ottoman castle to build that clock tower ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ajyad_fortress )  in 1780 , the ottoman turks built the fortress in order to protect the kaaba and islamic shrines in mecca from bandits and invaders . 
  at the time , many of the bandits and invaders were ** wahhabi ** ** radicals ** and the ottomans wanted to keep them out of the city . 
  note that the main title says `` kurdish militants '' and does n't give any information about which kurdish faction these militants are from which is pkk .

  they killed 14 cops today . 
  not even them , according to hdp they does n't want indepenence but `` more rights '' . 
  * without turkey there is n't a single political party in turkey that supports an independence `` kurdistan '' . 
  especially in turkish lel, 
  they are n't fighting against them ( hdp is kinda like their political wing not officially of course ) but it looks like they have some disagreements lately . 
  hdp does n't show any support for violence and they condemn the pkk attacks but also do n't want them to unarmed . 
  i really do n't know what 's happening . 
  this is also can be just pr or some sort of power fight between them . 
  many turkish leftists strategicaly voted for hdp so akp ca n't form a majority in parliament . 
  they ( and i ) had a naive hope like hdp will cut all of it 's connections with pkk but unfortunately they did n't . 
  i do n't find any logic in pkk 's latest actions . 
  it was so stupid for them to broke ceasefire in the first place . 
  pkk fights against the turkish state , not particularly against a political party but most of the kurds do n't like atat\u00fcrk because of the things like [ these . 
  ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/sheikh_said_rebellion ) so i do n't think they like chp which atat\u00fcrk is founder of the party . 
  you must also note that pkk conflict started in the 1970 's when chp was the ruler party . 
  i 'm a chp voter and i hate how akp/erdo \u011fan handles the kurdish problem . 
  they are too pussy to do anything . 
  erdo\u011fan fucked up everything with his `` peace process '' . 
  we should take israel 's war against the hamas terrorism as an example .

  [ well , our camps are definitely more comfy than jordan 's . 
  ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/magazine/how-to-build-a-perfect-refugee-camp.html?_r=0 ) our main problem is we simply ca n't host all of the 2 million refugees in those camps . 
  nowadays you can see a lot of syrian beggars in the \u0130zmir , \u0130stanbul etc. 
  there is also an economic side of this crisis of course .

  the solution is not encourage this people to have a dangerous journey to europe but setting up safe zones in their own country where there are n't any language and cultural barriers . 
  turkey proposed these the un nearly 4 years ago . 
  russia and china vetoed it . 
  nobody in europe interested to help us . 
   those huge camps in lebanon and turkey are mainly paid for by the gulf states . 
  i need a source for that . 
  humanitarian aid does n't mean gulf states pays for that camps .

  [ your numbers are old . 
  ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/refugees_of_the_syrian_civil_war ) we have nearly 2 million refugees right now . 
  those countries are islamic theocracies with archaic sharia law . 
  many of these refugees not only escape from assad regime but also from isis so i am not sure it 's a good idea for them to migrate the countries which are the main source of this shit called `` wahhabism '' . 
  my georgian is kinda rusty but i can translate this commonly used proverb . 
  `` one ring to rule them all , one ring to find them , one ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them . '', 
  why would they do that ? 
  everyone except you guys and refugees , knows that austria is a county of germany . 
  lol the downvotes , i thought that was one obvious joke ... and are you trying to be edgy or what ? 
  because you know there is n't any prohibition to drinking alcohol here and one of our national drinks is an alcoholic beverage which you have to drink once in your life to be considered a `` grown up '' . 
  you mean drinking vodka from tea cups , amirite ? 
  edit : jeez ** / s **, 
  they did n't steal the money though . 
  do n't mind that waste of oxygen neighbour , hellas needs you !, 
  * woosh *, 
  god dammit kurds pls lol, 
  i do n't agree . 
  the west pretty much adored erdo\u011fan for like 5-6 years after his first rise in politics and even in that time period turkey 's eu membership was n't likely . 
  the thing is from a purely political view , turkish self interests and eu 's interests is often very different from each other on some serious topics . 
  this is important because turkey has a bigger population than germany -- the most populous country in eu -- which means a lot of seats in the european parliament . 
  so the biggest problem of turkey 's eu membership is about its size/population . 
  you mean the illusion of power . 
  cyprus 's veto is one of the last things that blocks turkey 's eu membership . 
  tasty . 
   we no offense but you do realize cyprus does n't really have any say in important eu actions , right ? 
  not just cyprus though even a country like uk does n't have any power against the franco/german leading eu . 
  always think kostantiniye/konstantinapolis is much cooler than \u0130stanbul < eis tin poli  , both names are technically greek anyway, 
  lets call it selanik instead of thessaloniki and stop this meaningless name dispute :3, 
  last time we had a female pm here , we nearly start a war with greece . 
  hope it works better for you guys lol,

  stop guys , turkey-greece war is simply not gon na happen .

  google is the most common internet search engine but yandex used mostly for street view , maps . 
  [ i blame this on greece . 
  * for their hooman, 
  * sigh * the kurds = / = pkk . 
  saying that is pure racism . 
  for example iraqi kurdistan ( krg ) is one of our important allies in the region . 
  they help us in the operations against pkk ... 
  what is the problem you have with safe zone ?
