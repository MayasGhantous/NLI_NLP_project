  turkey have nearly 2.5 million refugees right now . 
  we need that safe zone . 
  we do n't even know how many of them are people escape from assad/isis or isis jihadis themselves . 
  while there are comfy refugee camps in south of turkey ( which locals of these places are not very happy about it , there was some fights between two groups last year ) . 
  a lot of them are n't in those camps . 
  they are in big cities of western/central turkey , living in streets , begging all day ( not all of them but a very sizeable minority ) all the syrian refugees will be under security and most importantly in their ** own ** ** country ** . 
  this also will reduce number of syrian refugees in europe because some of them swim into greek islands like kos then seek asylum to eu . 
  i totaly agree with you . 
  kurds are not a monolithic group of people . 
  saying all kurds are members of pkk is simply racism . 
  one of the most meaningless disputes the world has ever seen,

  [ turkish strategy ?!, 
  what the hell ? 
  look at our pm , look at it !, 
  what do you mean ? 
  northern cyprus is rightfully turkish clay . ^ / s on a more serious note , yeah we pretty much isolate ourselves from the middle east clusterfuck ( kind of like game of thrones lol ) and give the field to israel , saudis and iran . 
  both of our countries fucked up bad recently . 
  i blame the german tourists though . 
  we angered poseidon by letting so many of them to blessed shores of aegean . 
  eleos , have mercy on us !, 
  that was one pretty cliche , poor taste joke, 
  * turkish by nationality , kurdish by ethnicity . 
  do n't mess with dutch flower trade russia . 
  we gave them some tulip bulbs then couple of decades after they gone full psycho about flower business . 
  oups that 's right , thanks . 
  none of the islamic sects tolerate the homosexsuals , all of them have death punishment for it but ottoman empire which was the last caliphate if you do n't count isis ( most muslims do n't btw ) , decriminalized homosexsuality in 1858 . 
  edit : my english sucks ; _ ;, 
  well , i copypasted it to this thread because op 's link is not in english . 
  i agree blog is pretty shitty one and purely hate filled but that does n't change my point . 
  means , full of danger or risk ; causing danger ; perilous ; risky ; hazardous ; unsafe etc. 
  while the actions of fearmongering sweden democrats party is questionable ( well not really , considering they are homophobes as well ) , it is really a fucking shameful fact that gay parades can be dangerous in a country like sweden because of muslim immigrants . 
  edit : i agree that blog was horrible , sorry . 
  1 hour account lol, 
   * turkey and so on do n't provide anything of sorts [ here a nyt article about how comfy our refugee camps are . 
  ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/magazine/how-to-build-a-perfect-refugee-camp.html?_r=0 ) they are given everything they need from basic things like food , home , water to university level education . 
   * cultures are similar oh , boy . 
  there were refugee camps attacks in se turkey / hatay by local population . 
  people here definitely are not happy about refugees . 
   * languages are similiar . 
  in what way arabic is similiar to turkish ? 
  totally different language families , different scripts . 
  just a few shared words from ottoman era but still we probably have more shared words with balkans/greece ...  * lack of proper border control it is n't the most humane thing to do but we can easily shut our borders . 
   push other countries ( libya , turkey , tunisia ) to accept said regulations as well . 
  oh , please . 
  how are you gon na push us ? 
  do you realize we already have 2 million refugees ?

  [ ethnic map of asia minor and caucaus in 1914 . 
  ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:ethnic_map_of_asia_minor_and_caucasus_in_1914.jpg ) [ `` kurdistan '' map from a kurdish propaganda site claim parts of central anatolia , hatay , parts of yerevan and ankara , south part of georgia , basically all of the eastern turkey exept northen parts . 
  ] ( http://www.kurdistan24.com/home-picture/kurdistan-1.jpg )  the influx of kurds into the city has accelerated since the beginning of the kurdish -- turkish conflict with the kurdistan workers ' party ( i.e. 
  since the late 1970s ) . 
  [ 169 ] about two to three million residents of istanbul are kurdish , see kurds escaped the se parts of turkey because of the pkk activities . 
  they literally had to run away from their homes to safe western turkey where pkk does n't have power . 
  how you can be so sure that they abondon their everything just to go shitty areas of the country from devoloped cities of turkey ? 
   i see , so a uk national questioning your motives , and i am branded the entire history of people 's from these sceptred isles . 
  i did n't mean it in that way . 
  a cute little neutral swiss also is n't in a position to draw turkish borders . 
  it is simple just not your business but i like how you mention history of your country btw . 
   you do know how many ottomans died there ? 
  do you know why our flag colour is red ? 
   why is the occupation not legal ? 
  is this a real question ? 
  in what way an occupation of another country can be legal ? 
   if it 's not legal , why does it persist idk pick one : stupid nationalism ? 
  unsinkable aircraft carrier in mediterrean which near the russian base in tartus/syria ?

  fuck with greeks ? 
  dude i just give you a scientific , % 250 historically accurate polandball article . 
  how dare you question that ? 
  i know it is not a total fact like shopska salad being a serbian dish but still show some respect . 
  good because they were turkic . 
  [ my source is a polandball comic called `` evolution of turkey '' . 
  do macars really claim huns as part of their history ?

   my opinion on the crimean referendum in neither here nor there , on one hand the voted overwhelmingly for separation but on the other hand * there * * were * * lots * * and * * lots * * of * * accusations * * of * * rigging * . 
  if it was fit your narrative , you would stop a second and realize % 59 of the crimean population is ethnic russians . 
  kind of shows the results , huh ? 
   how are you not able to spot the difference between the two examples ? 
  it obviously makes no sense for an immigrant pakistani to be able to come to the uk and then lobby for independence in the area he/she lives in , the kurds however have been living in that region for at least as long as the turks have been in anatolia . 
  did you ever see the so called `` kurdistan '' maps ? 
  nearly % 90 of this turkish kurdistan region consist former armeanian lands which armenians were living until the genocide . 
  so no kurds were n't even a notable minority for like a century ago . 
   not to mention that kurds are overwhelming living in the south eastern corner of turkey and make up over 11 million people , whereas immigrants into the uk are spread throughout the whole country and all immigrant groups combined make up only around 12 % of the uk 's population . 
  kurds are a majority in some southeastern cities , it is a fact but if you think all of the 11 million kurds lives in se turkey , you are dead wrong . 
  there are 4 million kurds in istanbul alone , i am not even count other western cities like izmir , bursa ...  not exactly true now is it ? 
  both your south and eastern borders were drawn due to ottoman territorial losses in ww1 as well as turkey 's western border being drawn by your defeats against the south slavic and greek nations . 
  ottomans loses in balkans and middle east is not really have anything to do with [ turkish war of indepence led by atat\u00fcrk ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_war_of_independence ) ( you can see the ottomans in the ** enemy ** section ) . our borders drawn as a result of this victory by [ treaty of lausanne ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_lausanne ) . 
  not this colonial shit that ottomans signed called [ treaty of s\u00e8vres . 
  ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_s%c3%a8vres )  ok , so answer me this if the kurds overwhelmingly voted for a pro kurdish independence party and then that party began to campaign for a kurdish independence referendum would you support it ? 
  no , not really . 
  i do n't want my country to divide into pieces . 
  we lost important parts of our national identity by fucked up things like armenian genocide , greece/turkey forced population exchange , pogroms . 
  i do n't think turkey can handle another wound . 
  portakal means orange ( fruit one ) in turkish so there is that . 
  also you guys are my favourite mediterrean country that does n't have any mediterrean shores :3, 
  oh , so all the minorities around the world has right to form their own country , huh ? 
  i thought you guys were against the crimean indepenence referandum ? 
  i 'm pretty sure south asian immigrants like pakistanis ( which has pretty high birthrates like kurds btw ) in england can form a tiny country in a couple of years , no ?
