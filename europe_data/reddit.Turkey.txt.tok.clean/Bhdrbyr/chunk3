  unlike some other countries in the region turkey 's borders is n't drawn by imperialistic western powers . 
  we fought and shed our blood for every inch of it . 
  and it 's one of the atat\u00fcrk 's legacies to us . 
  he gave lots of speeches about indivisibility of our lands so no . 
  i 'm all for minority rights and voted for hdp in the last elections with a naive hope like they will cut their connections to pkk . 
  but unfortunately they did n't . 
  i am very unhappy about how akp handled the `` peace process '' . 
  i personally like the us 's stance against this kind of situation better . 
  a simple `` we do n't negotiate with terrorists '' . 
  most of the victims were n't etchnically kurdish . 
  they were socialists university students from all over turkey . 
  tell that to israeli citizens that will die by iranian funded organizations . 
  seriously if you think iran is different than saudi arabia you are so naive , my friend . 
  they also have freakin sharia law for fucks sake !, 
  iran is a theocracy . 
  like 3/4 days ago they hanged a 14 years old child for being gay ... 
  stop the occupation of cyprus ? 
  i agree . 
  acknowledge armenian genocide ? 
  ok , agree with this too . 
  kurdish self-determination ? 
  well , no . 
  uk is n't in a position to decide other countries ' borders and attack their sovereignty . 
   sorting the cluster fuck on their asia minor borders what do you mean by that ? 
  you do n't even know where asia minor is , do n't you ? 
  i sense a little gallipoli butthurt . 
  * turkish intervention do n't forget it was totaly legal . 
  what is not legal and the real proplem is occupation which happening still . 
  let 's just hope both communities agree on a unification plan soon and this time without guarantor powers . 
  a peaceful cyprus for just cypriots . 
  well , as a 1/4 greek turkish i was feeling pretty bad about recent `` bashing greeks '' circlejerk in r/europe and if it gon na make you guys friends again , im happy being the evil enemy < 3, 
  good , kudos to romanians !, 
  i also do n't want my tax money to spend on religious buildings . 
  i do n't think article nr 5 has anything to do with terrorist attacks . 
  not from a european country but i nominate [ this b * tch ] ( http://www.kaosgl.org/resim/turkandagolu.jpg ) / t\u00fcrkan da\u011fo\u011flu . 
  mp from akp ( erdo\u011fan 's conservative party ) . 
   in 29 may 2013 , a parliamentary research motion regarding the lgbt rights in turkey were proposed and discussed in the parliament of turkey . 
  akp mp t\u00fcrkan da\u011fo\u011flu ** cited ** ** the ** ** scientific ** ** articles ** ** on ** ** homosexuality ** ** published ** ** in ** ** u.s. ** ** 1974 ** , saying `` homosexuality is an abnormality . 
  same-sex mariages may not be allowed . 
  it would cause social deterioration . '', 
  she is a `` doctor '' . 
  they have some shitty , expensive af sandwiches for hipsters, 
  it is wrong , burgerking  mcdonalds for turkey . 
  jeez , it 's just our weekly foreplay/military training . 
  stop making news about it guys . 
  civilians did n't deserve it . 
  it 's also a shameful thing to describe human lifes as `` collateral damage '' . 
  this is a good example of tasteless satire . 
  he is albanian - just like you - not turkish , my dear `` leftover '' friend . 
  close saudi funded mosques , stop illegal immigration etc. 
  seriously guys come to r/turkey , we have much more relaxed mods when it comes to criticising islamists and refugee policies :d, 
  how many people have to die before it 's too late ? 
  france does have an extremism problem within their muslim community . 
  lets fucking hope left wing parties realize that this time . 
   you are right though , it is abnormally high , but then so is turkey 's . 
  the moment the two shake their dicks and let the pissing contest cease will be a great moment for greece 's creditors . 
  can you please explain how our military spending is `` abnormaly high '' ? 
  did you just forsake eastern thrace ? 
   fucking minarets guys , everything is not a dildo even if you are brave enough . 
  it 's an internet lie . ^ believeme, 
  turkey is turkey . 
  it is n't european or middle eastern . 
  our whole thing is being a bridge between western and eastern cultures . 
   thats the problem you talk about the assad regime and ypg like they are a greater evil when there is no such enemy as barbaric as isis . 
  yeap , isis are bunch of barbaric islamic nutjobs but they are not a serious threat to any modern army . 
  turkey can finish them easily with a proper military operation as long as they are in syria/iraq trying to form a state not in a `` southeastern turkey guerrilla warfare '' . 
  which is what kurdish separatist terrorist organization are doing in past 30 years . 
   whose side is turkey on ? 
  simple question . 
  you do n't need a political article to answer that . 
  turkey is on turkey 's side . 
  like all the countries around the world turkey has its own interests too . 
  surprise , eh ? 
  we support iraqi kurdistan 's president barzani 's political party kdp in kurdish politics against ypg/pkk . 
  we train and arm krg 's peshmergas against isis and also for a possible conflict with other kurdish groups . 
  we support various rebel groups against assad regime and isis . 
  we mostly turn a blind eye to isis fighters crossing syria because they are also fight against assad regime , ypg and some other islamist rebel groups that we do n't like them to have too much power over syria 's future . 
  basically whole war is a win/win situation to us exept refugee problem . 
  europe does this too . 
  how jihadis from europe can fly to countries around syria so easily with intelligence agencies like yours ? 
  because you also want them to go there . 
  it 's better them to die in a syrian desert than a terrorist attack/suicide bomb in europe/turkey . 
  probably not russians but personally i would be damn happy if we can switch syrian refugees with ukranian ones . 
  it 's in our genes to do so . 
  i ca n't help it . ^ / s, 
  and native americans suffered enourmously , just saying, 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/prostitution_by_country#/media/file:prostitution_in_europe.png green : prostitution legal and regulated blue : prostitution ( the exchange of sex for money ) legal , but brothels are illegal ; prostitution is not regulated red : prostitution fully illegal orange : illegal to pay for sex . 
  client commits a crime . 
  prostitute commits no crime, 
  i 'm not a european but i must say that if your `` defining characteristic '' is being religious ( muslim/christian etc ) then you are n't living in modern age . 
  a healty , progressive society ca n't coexist with some rulebooks from thousands of years ago . 
  i do n't know other countries such as lebanon but our refugee camps definitely not `` places to pitch their tents '' . 
  [ syrian refugees costs us around $ 17 billion . 
  ] ( http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/04/turkey-iraq-syria-cost-of-crisis-16-billion.html# ) [ infact there is a new york times article about how comfy our camps are . 
  ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/magazine/how-to-build-a-perfect-refugee-camp.html?_r=0 ), 
   that 's because the turkish islamist crazies are supporting al nusra and the other `` moderates '' ( lol ) of the syrian civil war . 
  us and turkey both support rebels against assad regime . 
  we arm a lot of rebel groups . 
  this is not a secret.there is some `` speculations '' about where this weapons go . 
  i 'm definitely not the happiest man about erdo\u011fan 's syrian civil war policy but i do n't think he armed al nusra .
