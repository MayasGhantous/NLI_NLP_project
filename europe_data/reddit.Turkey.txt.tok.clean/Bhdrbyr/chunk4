  this war hurts us more than any other country in the region with 2 million refugees and most importantly he is not that stupid to want al qaeda 's syrian branch as rulers to a neighbor country . 
  our right wing is gross , have serious problems but there is n't really a competition among muslim world . 
  i mean standarts are really low . 
  it is n't . 
  this is so fucked up . 
  compare us and france ( both secular states ) : turkey , a muslim majority nation that borders isis with 81 million population : 600 fighters . 
  france , a christian majority nation with 66 million population : 1,200 fighters . 
  better start to vote le pen guys . 
  radical islam is way too much overkill for an average akp voter . 
  our capital is ankara not \u0130stanbul, 
  you lost . 
  even with this shady election , akp do n't have enough seats to govern alone , 
  dude i 'm asking these questions to myself like for ten years, 
  hollanda . 
   dubai and qatar are not european and yet they have lots of * slaves * . 
  fixed for you . 
  here in turkey we have muslim romani minority . 
  they are pretty chill . 
  to be honest i pretty much adore their bohemian lifestyle . 
  ** greece ** ~ souvlaki , gyros , dolmadakia , baklava < 3 ~ beautiful beaches , islands and historic buildings everywhere . 
  ~ friendly mediterranean people . 
  * and you can always cross the aegean to get better versions of all of these , 
  why would i vote for a party that supports a separatist terrorist organization ? 
  tengri is glorius turan god , no uralic people pls . 
  it was so cringeful, 
  in ottoman empire not turkey . 
  ottoman empire legalized homosexsuality in 1858 and it has always been legal in turkey since her foundation ( 1923 ) . 
  [ i want old turkic runes back :( ] ( http://resim.beyince.net/yazi/orkhon-old-turkic-alphabet.jpg ), 
  [ according to wiki , first it called olivye or russian salad but during the cold war it changed to american salad due to ideological issues lol ] ( http://tr.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/rus_salatas%c4%b1 ), 
  [ mongolians are n't turkic but some historians say that chengis khan 's mother was from a turkic tribe . 
  ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkic_peoples ), 
  it called american salad in turkey . 
  unfortunately she is turkish ... 
  yeah sure but you know , we have a genocidal neo ottoman maniac over here called erdo\u011fan and nearly half of the country support his political party like mindless zombies . 
  that can be * a * * little * problematic :3, 
  yes and no , we should be under the same state !, 
  well in the western part of turkey they are mostly uneducated , unqualified labors but hardworking people . 
  i really do n't know much about southeastern turkey but probably most of them do n't even speak turkish so yeah ... 
  seriously this kind of shits makes me `` kurdistan '' supporter , they can take all of their tribal culture and form their own country based on shits like honour killing , fgm as long as they get the fuck out of other parts of turkey . 
  it also can be sort of buffer zone between us and iraq/syria . 
  oh , do we count pronouns ? 
  if so yeah `` o '' can be the shortest . 
  the longest : '' * muvaffakiyetsizle\u015ftiricile\u015ftiriveremeyebileceklerimizdenmi\u015fsinizcesine * '' ( 70 letter ) means `` as though you are from those whom we may not be able to easily make into a maker of unsuccessful ones '' shortest : any word with 2 letters ( ? ), 
  it 's so beatiful , happy national day !, 
  what is the opinion of gagauzians about unification with romania ? 
  i heard that they were pro russian, 
  muh tax money ... 
  this is wrong on so many levels ... 
  india is the second most populous country in the world , we are talking about over 1.2 billion people . 
  poverty is not a result of democracy . 
   for instance , belarus is doing a lot better than a democracy like india . 
  india is a regional power , a nuclear state , third largest standing army in the world and a major economy which is one of the fastest growing economies . 
  belarus ? 
  a small landlocked eastern european country that has little to no relevancy ? 
  [ `` goshuk '' is not a turkish word , does n't even sound like turkish . 
  i did n't give you an anectodal example . 
  election results show the mindset of * majority * ( which still does n't mean other people of n.cyprus are sharia lover nutjobs like you compared them to . ), 
  only solution is * la\u00efcit\u00e9 / laiklik * instead of standard anglo-saxon secularism . 
  you have to fully divide religion and the state like france ( and turkey used to be ) . 
  ban people for going full ninja mode and close the wahhabi funded mosques . 
  it 's a terrible idea . 
  northen cypriots recently voted for a lgbt rights supporter , you have no idea what you are talking about . 
  rich yes , developed no . 
  most of them are syrian but yeah there are a lot of kurdish refugees too, 
  public opinion is very bad . 
  i think refugees should treated as such and should n't even allowed to leave camps that created for them but erdo\u011fan sees them as potential akp voters so he plans to give them turkish citizenship ...

  is it really true that a republican senator threw snowball on senate to disprove global warming ? 
  i mean like * seriously * ? 
  guys it 's not racist if a turkic person says so dont downvote , amirite ? 
  yeah civilian massacres are totaly legit because their country invaded those places some 500 years ago amirite ? 
   erm , we , the `` west '' , also condemn these atrocities . 
  we do n't deny they never happened . 
  see the difference ? 
  turkey do n't deny these massacres . 
  it 's a ** term discussion ** . 
  i wish but do n't think so . 
  nagorno-karabakh issue needs to resolved before that can happen . 
  we can say samething about armenian genocide : europeans are not relavant here . 
  they have higher percentage of akp voters than turkey so yeah they are . 
   also you all think the balkans owes you an apology for kicking you all out ... 
  it just pisses everyone off [ did you just justify civilian massacres ?

  at this point it does n't even matter , words ca n't describe how much i hate this guy anyway . 
  we forced house osman into exile right after the creation of turkey , 
  [ well , unlike you we rock at quidditch :p here is a match from this years quidditch cup .

  thanks to algerians lel, 
   you misunderstood what i said . 
  i just said that the winner always occupies the loser republic of turkey did n't lose a war ? 
   the truth is , your country was born from disrespect of a war treaty . 
  as i said treaty of sevres signed by ** ottoman empire ** . 
  after the revolution there is no more an empire named ottoman but a republic named turkey . 
  then allies and turkey signed the treaty of lausanne . 
  rebuplic of turkey = / = ottoman empire . 
   and finally , i do n't know where you brought 16 countries from . 
  honestly , i can just remember of the french mandate of syria and lebanon , the british mandate ( jordan and israel/palestine ) , the hashemite kingdom of iraq , the kingdom of hejaz and turkey itself .
