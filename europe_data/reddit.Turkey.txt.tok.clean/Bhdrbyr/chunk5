  [ i was wrong actually ottoman empire divided into 15 different states.look at the `` succedeed by '' section . 
  ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ottoman_empire ), 
   kicked invaders that were there in the first place because you lost the war . 
  wtf ? 
  did you look at the map ? 
  since when brits , italians and french considered anatolian ?!, 
  turks live in anatolia since 10th century ...  and if in a hypotetical situation the central empires had won the war , would you praise a rebellion and war that disrespected the treaty that acknowledged that you won the war by territorial loss of the loser ? 
  [ `` ottoman empire '' lost the war and signed that piece of shit . 
  atat\u00fcrk lead the indepenence war / turkish revolution against ottoman empire and allied forces . 
  the result is the rebuplic of turkey . 
  ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_war_of_independence ) modern day turkey founded after the world war 1 . 
   and what about austria-hungary that was butchered by the allied powers ? 
  so what ? 
  ottoman empire butchered into 16 different states ... 
  `` treaty of serves '' seriously ?!, 
  [ so you want this map , huh ?!, 
  oh , i am so sorry that we won our indepence war , kicked invaders out and did n't turn some british , italian , french colony !,

  shall we tell them that europe , the place they want to migrate , are majority christian ? 
  at least our turkic brothers doing good ^ turanstronk, 
  i know wiki called it in different names . 
  i just point the title which used the turkish word . 
  thanks for the article though , it was a good read . 
  til an icona of proto-daouli/davul found in central india ( 100-75 bc ), 
  except they do n't even look similiar o.o ? 
  whatever , we have a lot in common . 
  fighting over food , music etc. 
  is kinda hard in this part of the world . 
  i can accept that * kemen\u00e7e * is byzantine greek but not * daouli * , even your wiki article refers it as * davul * ^ ^, 
  tl ; dr yeap we did bad things.many people suffered under our rule but you know what ? 
  we also build hospitals , schools because you know that is what imperialistic colonial system is for !, 
  our purpose was develop these poor countries and turn them into what they are today `` super \u00fcber developed industrialized countries '' . 
  i mean it is n't like we did n't have any benefits but as i said some of the money we gained from them , used for them is n't that great ? 
  [ and ofcourse our glorious empire never committed crimes like slavery , that is what filthy ottomans did . 
  not if you count us too ^ turkeystronk, 
  at least you guys have mykonos and lesbos which are super fabulous !, 
  mayor has a transformers fetish so plans to build some otorobot theme park , people tired of his shits and sued him for wasting public resources . 
  but he does n't care and uses social media to choose otorobots for his playground . 
  [ which robot is more handsome guys ?

  oh gawd some people like evil turks , how can this happen ?!, 
  humans should hate eachother.this is totaly a disaster , we should teach our younglings to hate kebap !!,

  are n't most of the mosques in europe funded by saudi arabia ? 
  if so i seriously think he is right , considering how much people joined isis from europe , you guys really need to do something about spread of wahhabism . 
  its weird that i can connect all of them without dns or vpn 0.0, 
  well , i really hate that jerk but you guys must understand that he is a popularist not an islamist , he just manipulates uneducated folks that live in rural parts of country and conservetives to keep akp as ruling party for his financial gains.he is more like us 's republicans.the most religious move that akp has ever done was lifting the headscarf ban in public buildings . 
  even with akp government you cant compare turkey to other muslim majority countries or a `` caliphate '' like you said.other half of turkey hate akp so much because they are damaging turkey 's `` traditional secularism '' / turkish * laiklik * which comes from french word * la\u00efcit\u00e9 * . 
  * laiklik * is basically `` hardcore secularism '' and one of atat\u00fcrk 's main principles . 
  he is * trying * to change it , as far as i know turkey is still a parliamentary republic .

  well , i said that it is hard :d, 
  i guess you mean prince islands in the marmara sea , istanbul ?

  not economically but they are definetly deserve the `` western european '' term since greece is basically the birthplace of western civilization . 
  fun fact , turkey does n't have desert . 
  and i 'm white as fuck #thanksgreece, 
   it 's not about the immigrants being chill  if there are any terrorist attacks by muslim immigrants umm what ? 
  elaborate `` bad time '' . 
  jordan is a monarchy ... 
   the turkish government offered compensation for the families of the killed , who according to turkish officials were mistakenly killed in airstrike , identifying them as pkk militants . 
  turkish president erdogan expressed personal regret over the killing . 
  `` freedom fighters '' ?!, 
  i really do n't know much about anc but i am pretty sure in all civilized countries , any separatist groups that chooses * guerrilla warfare * as their way of reaching freedom ( which is not the case , they directly demand land and want to form their own nation , not more rights under turkish government ) counts as terrorists . 
  are n't they syrian branch of pkk ? 
  just because they killed some smelly islamic nutjobs for defending their land does n't change the fact that they are a terrorist organization.even fucking hezbollah recruits men against isis ... 
  pkk is a thing you know, 
  well they are `` anti islamist '' as turkish left , europe 's left is `` muslim apologists '' , maybe they tried to convert it for you guys idk, 
  we were doing good in the past but you know `` erdo\u011fan '' happened ... 
  do you really think that they are the same group of people ? 
  atat\u00fcrk was sentenced to death by vahdettin ( last sultan ) . 
  ottoman empire wasnt a democracy , you cant blame the common folk for the actions of a sultanate ... 
  i prefer running in circles and scream thinkin about gyspy version of vlad the impaler . 
  ~ ~ romanian beggars ~ ~ * \u00c7ingenes * dunno why but this triggers me so hard, 
  his flair shows the original cyprus flag not the northern one . 
  he is a leftist northern cypriot and often criticize turkish government for occupation . 
  also there are turkish people living in that island for many generations/centuries i think it 's fair to say that they are ` native ' not settlers . 
  arabs and turks do n't get along very well and by saying `` very well '' im just being positive . 
  turkish nationalist with a cyprus flag ? 
  georgian wine ? 
  turks - reigned by : tyrant kek . 
   if i hire a prostitute in turkey , and get caught , can i defend myself by saying `` but it is legal in my country to hire a prostitute '' you do n't have to do that , prostitution is legal in turkey ... 
   s\u00f6zc\u00fc is n't this ridicilous s\u00f6zc\u00fc is not ridicilous at all . 
  disgusting if it 's true . 
   fanatical islamic countries azerbaijan is not an islamic country , it 's a muslim majority country with a secular constitution ( ** huge ** difference ) and its population is definitely not religously fanatic at all . 
   a whole soccer stadium of turks were chanting allahu akkbar during a moment of silence . 
  uhhhm they did n't ? 
  of course i agree it 's not always possible to catch them but this is not the case here . 
  this guy caught while trying to cross syria . 
  he is deported from turkey under heavy suspicions .
