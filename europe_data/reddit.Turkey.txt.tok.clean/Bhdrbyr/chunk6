  it 's understandable why he released maybe there was n't enough proof but you could have at least monitored the guy , right ? 
  im sure there are n't many belgians arrested in our southern border ... 
  literally my next paragraph  i know maybe i should n't criticize since we had 3 terror attacks last 2 months but in our defence we have a bloody civil war right next to us that force us to open our borders to millions of people ( potential isis and pkk members ) and we need to deal with separatist terrorism . 
  most importantly while all of this shits happening our country ruled by this stupid piece of human garbage called erdo\u011fan , he is the worst politician in our republics history which says something cuz we had really bad politicians before . 
  we have erdo\u011fan , what 's your excuse ? 
  i seriously ca n't believe how incompetent european intelligence agencies/law enforcers are when it comes to terrorism .

  still we detain some of them and inform european counterparts but seems like they just ignore and wait for them to go full snackbar mode ... 
  why are you so biased ? 
  only 6 days ago a suicide bomber of [ kurdistan `` freedom '' falcons ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kurdistan_freedom_falcons ) killed 37 people in ankara ( most of them were highschool/uni students ) and they proudly [ claimed ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35829231 ) responsibility . 
  i wonder why people suspected kurdish groups this time too , racist turks / s, 
  turkey has a minimum wage, 
  this is so sad . 
  thanks to you op , now i ca n't enjoy my delicious sucuklu yumurta :(, 
  well there is muhte\u015fem y\u00fczy\u0131l ( magnificent century ) if you like ottoman stuff . 
  last year they started a sequel to it , k\u00f6sem . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he5i1znptyq ) is one of its trailers . 
  prostitution is also legal in turkey unlike some other european countries . 
   good for turkey , islamic countries ... * triggered *, 
  * turkey * wealthy pick one, 
  can confirm this . 
  mezes are more important than raki itself lol, 
   nationality well it ca n't be kurdish xaxaxaxaxa, 
  brb gon na try something, 
  turkish sentences are even weirder than the english ones . 
  i 'm a native turkish speaker but it was really hard for me to get what they wanted to say untill i read the google translate version . 
  i just hope arabic translation is more succesful lmao, 
  these comments are r/cringe materials, 
  no not really , turkish word `` laiklik '' comes from french `` la\u00efcit\u00e9 '' and it 's a stricter version of standard anglo saxon secularism . 
  [ \u0130stanbul ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lmpqhtom4w ), 
  [ well yeah let 's not talk about this one .

  apparently european counsil controlled by mighty lithuania/croatia block which eventually will take over the eu . 
  union will lose its democratic values and the federalization goal . 
  instead of these it will turn into european empire then use esa funds to colonize the whole galaxy . 
  head of the empire will be ms \\ mr darth lithuania or croatia . 
  but according to the nature of dark side there ca n't be two sith lord at the same time so the battle of dark side will begin . 
  the force needs balance but franco \\ german block are facing the worst migrant invasion since the migration period . 
  light side of the force cornered by all sides . 
  leaders of the jedi order unable to beat power of populism and bring balance back . 
  only the uk master of lingua franca can stop them and bring balance to the eu but when europe needed her most she ~ ~ disappeared ~ ~ lost her relevancy . 
   russia has also been less confrontational with the west . 
  thanks to merciful skydadies that i did n't live in the cold war era then  turkey is replacing america as enemy # 1 . oh shit, 
  originally it 's a persian ( which makes it \u0130ndo european ) suffix for ` place of ' / ` land of ' . 
  used in turkic-iranian languages in central asia , such as tataristan , k\u0131rg\u0131zistan , \u00d6zbekistan ... 
  but we can also assume , he is one sexy bad boy that all these countries want to associated with lol, 
  well to be fair turks in western europe , are also considered ` special case ' here in turkey . 
  they were n't normal migrants , they got invited to europe in the 60-70s as part of gasterbeiter program - and the likes of it - to fill the unskilled labour need of germany/western europe . 
  they were n't people who had great lifes here too . 
  they specifically chosen from deep central anatolia or eastern turkey aka turkish hinterlands ( some of them did n't even have the ability of speaking proper turkish ) . 
  important to note that there was n't any significant integration effort from germans too since they saw them as temporary ` guests workers ' not immigrants . 
  while i agree that there is still lots of proplems need to be solved about these people i do n't think it 's fair to compare them to recent migrant from na/me . 
  t\u00f6r\u00f6korsz\u00e1g looks/sounds cool , thank you macaristan !, 
  h\u00fcrriyet daily [ link ] ( http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkey-plans-to-introduce-work-permits-for-syrian-refugees-minister-says.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=93686 )  bozk\u0131r 's statement came around a month after the international labor organization ( ilo ) stressed the need for a comprehensive measures to regulate the employment of syrian refugees in turkey as well as to minimize the negative impact on the local labor market and to turn the issue into an opportunity rather than a threat . 
   turkey is the world 's biggest host of refugees amid the greatest global movement of refugees ever recorded . 
  more than 2.2 million syrians have sought refuge in turkey from the civil war , now in its sixth year . 
  another 200,000 iraqi refugees also shelter there , while migrants from iran , afghanistan and africa all use turkey as a transit point to europe . 
   `` more than 50 percent of the population of kilis , 25 percent of the population of \u015eanl\u0131urfa and 22.5 percent of the population of gaziantep is made up of syrians . 
  these cities are beyond their infrastructure capacity , particularly in the areas of municipal services , health , education and social services . 
  getting access to social services both for host communities and for syrians is becoming increasingly problematic , '' the ilo report stated . 
  [ number of syrian refugees rivaling locals in 10 turkish cities ] ( http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/number-of-syrian-refugees-rivaling-locals-in-10-turkish-cities.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=87041&amp;newscatid=341 ) [ oecd 's 2015 turkey unemployment report .

  which one annexed \u0130stanbul , bulgaria or greece ? 
  lol, 
  wtf ? 
  this has nothing to do with us why would we put them in jail here ? 
  first streotype in [ this vid ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9cj0xkm5dlg ) explains it pretty good, 
  turkey too . 
  last years [ lys ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/student_selection_and_placement_system ) was in middle of ramadan and that 's an unavoidable exam if you want to enter a university . 
  yeah about that . . you do realize our so `` effective '' police were clueless about ankara attack right ? 
  like our capital ankara . 
  definitely [ \u0130zmir . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c4%b0zmir ) fuck \u0130stanbul and it 's rude people . 
  dude that 's a damn good way to keep your virginity no one will dare to touch your pink willy unless they want to invoke article 5 :(, 
   `` article 5 '' seems to be a deep obsession in the ~ ~ u.s. ~ ~ reddit really . 
  putin needs to arrest at least ten more journalists to reach erdo\u011fan level of fascism sorry ivan but u cant beat hakan in his own game , 
  http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/18/turkey-threatens-expel-armenians-genocide  `` there are currently 170,000 armenians living in our country . 
  only 70,000 of them are turkish citizens , but we are tolerating the remaining 100,000 , '' he told the bbc turkish service . 
   turkey experienced a huge influx of people from armenia after the country 's devastating earthquake in 1988 . 
  thousands of ** illegal ** ** armenian ** ** immigrants ** work in low-skilled jobs in turkey , although there is dispute over the exact number . 
  deporting illegal migrants is not equal to deporting all armenians like you said . 
  he is a jerk and definitely a racist but he never threatened to deport all armenians in turkey . 
  this deserves more upvotes top notch banter lmao, 
  to play with snow of course , we only have snow for like 3 weeks a year so basicaly no way to keep the children sitting in classrooms when there are snow outside . 
  most importantly we are lazy as fuck and we need more excuses for not w\u00f6rk w\u00f6rk w\u00f6rk all the time like some german machines disguised as homo sapiens, 
  here in \u0130stanbul ( well lets say everywhere in turkey except southern parts ) it 's pretty common to snow in this time of the year `` balkanlardan gelen so\u011fuk hava dalgas\u0131 '' `` sibiryadan gelen so\u011fuk hava dalgas\u0131 '' stuff like these are generally what we hear in weather forecasts lol, 
  that 's an answer though . 
  my fav painter is this awesome gentlemen called ren\u00e9 magritte . 
  this is such an embarrassment there are literally dozens of active churches in turkey ( especially in \u0130stanbul ) and they are hardly full in sundays etc. 
  since there are so few christians here but these guys had to rent some ugly ass basement for christmas ... 
  oups k then google translate lied to me . 
  it translated `` gora '' as forest :|, 
  serbians be like ; we roman\u0130a now, 
  til montenegro is crna gora in serbian which means `` black forest '' in turkish , montenegro is `` karada\u011f '' which means `` black mountain '' like the english one hmm that 's interesting, 
   palestine was one of the first arab country they were n't even `` a country '' back then . 
  what today they claim as `` palastine '' was part of two different ottoman vilayets , vilayet of beirut and sanjak of jerusalem . 
  but there is a kurdish political party in the parliament already ... 
   comparing the pkk to isis is grossly inaccurate , both has blood of our citizens on their hands , thats more than enough similarities to me,
