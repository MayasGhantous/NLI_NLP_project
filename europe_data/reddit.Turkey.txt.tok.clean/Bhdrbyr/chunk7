  damn ... lucky albanians dude , im so jealous right now !, 
  yer a nazi harry, 
  it was n't really a fair deal for the greek side and i 'm saying this as a turkish patriot . 
  most importantly the proposed flag was so fuckin ugly , especialy compared to current one . 
  this is not a personal opinion . 
  look at this [ beauty ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_cyprus.svg ) and this [ shit ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/annan_plan_for_cyprus#/media/file%3aproposed_flag_of_the_united_cyprus_republic.svg ), 
  trt ( t\u00fcrk radyo ve televizyon kurumu ) owned by turkish government . 
  they are basically turkish version of rt and probably the least trustable source for news about russia right now, 
  wut santa / [ saint nicholas ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/saint_nicholas_of_myra ) is from modern day [ myra/demre , turkey ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/demre ), 
  for turkey only obama and dilma have positive ranks lol,

   mandatory daily worship in schools  sharia courts wtf is wrong with uk lately ? 
  even erdo\u011fan could n't manage to fucked up secularism that bad here ( yet ), 
   untill russia kicked them all, 
   well because the russians ( or gullenists ) would use it against you day 1 for a start and a couple other consequences like that ? 
  well , pardon me but `` undeniable proof '' that you ca n't prove shit with sounds like a conspiracy theory . 
  are you by any chance sub r/conspiracy ? 
  i really do n't understand your goal in the second paragraph of yours . 
  do you think skykes picot is our fault ? 
  also what the fuck is `` raising the turkmen population in se turkey '' asaik there is n't any significant numbers of turkmens here in turkey in general let alone south eastern parts of the country . 
  a senior western official that we do n't know who says he/she has an undeniable proof/documents that we do n't know shit about . 
  you have ** undeniable ** documents to show turkey 's isis support then why the hell article does n't give us any information from that proof besides that it is undeniable ?!, 
  a former isis member that captured by kurds and still in the kurdish prison when he gave that `` le other members told me to not be afraid of turkey statement '' is trustable huh ? 
  btw your history knowladge is kinda rusty . 
  turkey 's borders are not some `` artifical lines '' drawn by your forefathers . 
  [ your forefathers wanted these borders . 
  ] ( https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:and9gcqjmbriisqvekuncegbwmkuxjtkumyrsm8e1lcbka8jmqycib2v2ienblhf8w ) they tried to force these neo colonial bullshit but thanks to atat\u00fcrk they got their ass kicked nicely . 
  so no , our borders did n't drawn by your grandpa 's pleasures . 
  +1 karma for pointing out armenian genocide that im very aware of . 
  if you look at my comments in r/turkey , you can see my flair and opinion on that topic . 
  your accusations that has a source of #twitterkurds means/proves nothing . 
  you are the one who try to lecture me about pkk . 
  did you even know anything about pkk until this syrian crisis ? 
  my country has a century old fight against separatists terrorism and we are not gon na forget that fact because of some new genocidal islamist nutjobs with gross beards ( which happens to be very common in this particular damned geography / thanks wahhabis for their lovely contribution to world i guess ) . 
  [ al qaeda declared war against isis . 
  ] ( http://abcnews.go.com/international/al-qaeda-leader-al-zawahiri-declares-war-isis/story?id=33656684 ) what a bunch of peace loving people , fighting against the only evil on our world . 
  topkek, 
  implying one kurdish organization ( which is an illegal militant group and listed as terrorists by both eu and nato ) fund itself by trafficking is not `` reusing everything to push their * antikurd * * racist * * agenda * '' is he also an anti semite , homophobe prick who support gender discrimination just because he wrote some facts about an outlawed faction of kurds ? 
  reddit 's circlejerk power and pc culture never ceases to amaze me . 
  iran 's khamenei also pointing gun at them so the guy with red star represents pjak too . 
   it would have bypassed turkey https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nabucco_pipeline, 
  looooooooooool, 
  well that 's nothing new , pkk has received support from soviets during the cold war . 
  we also could n't stop pkk fighters crossing that border for like 4 decades ... 
   isis were to gain more and more power and eventually take over turkey wut are you high ? 
  is that how pkk propaganda works nowadays ? 
  using pictures of woman fighters to gain the symphaty of the west ? 
  that 's totally not objectifying female fighters , right ? 
  whatever one of my idols is a female fighter pilot , in fact she is the worlds first female fighter pilot . 
  [ sabiha g\u00f6k\u00e7en ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sabiha_g%c3%b6k%c3%a7en ) , atat\u00fcrk 's adopted daughter which knowns for bombing the shit out of the kurdish rebels .

   the recent bombing of bangkok ( although not a suicide bombing ) is also suspected to have turkish involvement . 
  he had a ** fake ** turkish passport . 
   so if you are not going to solve `` the kurdish problem '' by ** speaking ** there is a kurdish political party in the parliament ( which has more seats than the turkish nationalist party and have lots of turkish supporters ) . 
  i 'm sure they can speak for the kurdish citizens . 
   with ** the ** ** kurds ** pkk is `` the kurds '' , huh ? 
  i do n't see them as a group that represents kurds . 
  not all kurds are terrorists here . 
  a lot of kurdish citizens left the southeastern turkey ( aka pkk 's stronghold ) and migrated to the western parts of the country ( where the only force is government ) after the conflict with pkk escalated back in the 90 's . 
  turkey has mandatory conscription . 
  after graduation from uni there is a high chance that i will be one of those soldiers in the southeastern parts of the country . 
  there is a high chance i will die at the hands of pkk terrorists . 
  pardon me if im not very cool about it . 
  whoops ok then that 's totaly possible if that school have turkish students . 
  as a turkish youth i also would n't want any pkk affiliated militant organization member in my uni btw . 
   asad khan that 's not a turkish name . 
  there are lots of kebab types . 
  you are comparing it only with d\u00f6ner . 
  [ souvlaki ] ( http://www.google.com.tr/imgres?imgurl=http://cookiesandnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/souvlaki-gr.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://cookiesandnoodles.com/2011/10/26/a-walk-into-greece/&amp;h=1936&amp;w=2592&amp;tbnid=x4uo_cl03ptwem:&amp;docid=zw56luaqxhc0nm&amp;hl=tr&amp;ei=bqbfvrsflogxsahww7sq&amp;tbm=isch&amp;client=safari&amp;ved=0cfcqmygsmcxqfqotcls6vkj-jmkcfyellaod1ueoagis ) is greek equivalent of [ \u015ei\u015f kebap ] ( http://www.google.com.tr/imgres?imgurl=http://selalepide.com.tr/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/tavuk-sis.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://selalepide.com.tr/category/kebap-cesitleri/&amp;h=500&amp;w=486&amp;tbnid=edj3u9h9mfwo4m:&amp;docid=z_hkgqfly53acm&amp;hl=tr&amp;ei=q59fvu_vaogtsggoopywca&amp;tbm=isch&amp;client=safari&amp;ved=0ceoqmygfmb9qfqotck-dk8v9jmkcfygjlaoddhehhg ) . biggest difference is meat types though . 
  souvlaki mostly made from pork while \u015ei\u015f kebab usually made from lamb or chicken . 
  that comment was perfect until the second paragraph . 
   muslim union oh jeez i think i am gon na puke ... like wtf ?!, 
  that 's the most stupid idea i ever heard . 
  what makes you think turks wants to be a part of a muslim union ? 
  what does turkey share with morocco and indonesia besides from religion ? 
  do you think our understanding of islam is same with those countries ? 
  maybe some nationalists akp voters dream about the glorious ottoman times but that was n't a * union * . 
  it was a colonial empire under the turkish rule . 
  if you are living in a country where greek migrant population significantly bigger than the turkish one , you should definitely eat gyro instead of d\u00f6ner ( they are nearly identical anyway ) . 
  for example i would not recommend anyone to eating d\u00f6ner / \u0130skender in us even if you somehow find one . 
  afaik we do n't have a porn festival here anyway :(, 
  '' * failure * * to * * dismantle * * turkey * * following * * the * * treaty * * of * * s\u00e8vres * * was * * a * * major * * blunder . 
  * '' rip , you wo n't be missed where i live . 
  we also have dotless i  '' \u0131 '' i\u0131\u0130i, 
   not to even mention that like half of the country ( which happens to include many significant breweries ) is covered by denmark 's data . 
  same . 
  western coast of the country is covered by germany 's data and i am pretty sure we have more than 10 breweries here . 
  caucasian folk dance rocks !, 
  [ this is from a talent show here in turkey .

  it 's not turkey 's ** migrant ** policy , it is turkey 's ** refugee ** policy . 
  second biggest party in the parliament is irrevelant , huh ? 
  is that how swedish democracy works ? 
  i knew the swedish politics is retardedly corrupted by political correctness but seriously i wonder when social `` democrats '' understand that it 's totaly fine and not racist to think about your own people and their future ? 
  which is exactly what chp doing right now by opposing more refugees here . 
  h\u00fcrriyet is one of the most realible turkish newspapers ... 
  i know this is an unpopular opinion thread and i should n't downvote you for * strongly * * disagreeing * but i did downvote you anyway .
