  are n't sanctions lifted after the nuclear deal though ? 
  \u0130stanbul is ugly and have some large conservative areas compared to other wt cities . 
  go to \u0130zmir and you will se how liberal muslims can be . 
   saudia should be the one on which eu and us put sanctions , not russia why not both + other gulf states that have sharia law and iran ? 
  we ca n't keep people here if they want to leave for germany or other sweet welfare states , they are n't prisoners . 
  also before blaming turkish government ( which currently hosting 2.5 million refugees , way beyond her economical power ) maybe just maybe you can blame your own government for not protecting its own borders ? 
  because you know it is n't our duty to do so . 
  yeah , youtube comments ... 
  money is n't worth shit if you ca n't spend it however you like . 
  i have no idea about other countries but young people are n't more religious than older generations in turkey for sure . 
  i need a source on that . 
  probably because they do n't want refugees to come europe in the first place . 
  turkish people are one of the most nationalistic/racist people on the earth , especially the diaspora ones . 
  arabs are backstabbers/traitors , religious nutjobs , dirty and stupid people/easy to manipulate according to turkish nationalists . 
  they are even worse than kurds ( only * slightly * though ) . 
  there will be so much shitstorm if they wo n't be able to drink rak\u0131 in places like neuk\u00f6ln lol, 
   it is legitimate for the turks to try to defend themselves '' tell me what is wrong with that sentence ? 
  are we supposed to sit back and watch when pkk killing our policemen and soldiers ? 
  implying the middle east can be peaceful . 
  well , you are right . 
  german turks are much more conservative than people here but honour killing is not a turkish thing . 
  i refuse to believe that girl was turkish by ethnicity . 
  i do n't want to sound racist but it 's a common practice among kurdish tribes in se turkey ... 
  can you give a link ? 
  a turkish girl or a girl with a turkish passport ? 
  because that 's fucking different you know . 
  honour killing is a eastern turkey thing which populated by kurds . 
  sunni-shia nonsense is n't a thing in turkic muslim communities . 
  azerbaiijan , our `` best friend '' is a shia majority country too . 
   but you do realize they are ** also ** a theocracy , right ? 
   but they are n't as ** large ** as saudi . 
  right word is rich . 
  population wise turkey and iran are much larger countries than sa . 
  i like iran . 
  they are culturally much more similiar to us ( turkic people ) compared to arabic countries . 
  but you do realize they are also a theocracy , right ? 
  they have freaking sharia law for god sake dude ... 
  nope . 
  we do n't want a deserty shithole , filled with sharia lover nutjobs . 
  oil is nice though but still nope nope . 
  well it can be but it can also be some ridicilous annan-like plan which greek cypriots would never agree but akp thinks it 's good etc. 
  i hope you are right tho since we really need some positive news lately :(, 
  it should be noted , aa is a government mouthpiece so these are what akp thinks . 
  i wish nothing but the best future for cypriots . 
  islam is fascism in religion form so no they ca n't, 
  maggie smith . 
  nuff said, 
  imagine the amount of salt . . 
  vice made a short documentary about his cult . 
  well if you are into plastic bimbos . . [ here ] ( https://www.google.com.tr/search?q=harun+yahya+kedicikleri&amp;rlz=1c9bkja_entr612tr612&amp;hl=tr&amp;prmd=ivn&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewish_et4ubpahvfxrqkhaetc6kq_auibygb&amp;biw=1024&amp;bih=653#imgrc=s39csk8bwxceom%3a ) this is how his ` kittens ' looks like, 
  * son in law, 
  you do n't want to watch turkish tv believe me . 
  it 's kind of weird that we do n't use a turkic word for beer but hungary does . 
  when you mod r/outside way too much , you should expect few text glitches like burqa . 
  i heard r/europe and r/islam are not compatible . 
  was an inside job blame \u00e7ipras, 
  good news for humanity, 
  one restaurant in paris doing some stupid shit does n't mean france went full retard . 
  my perception of brazil was very different before the rio olympics . 
  kudos to polish athlet though !, 
  hey it 's not exactly clear who make this awesome food first so there is a high possibility that we are the ones who `` borrowed '' it from you guys lol, 
  we call that [ \u0130zmir k\u00f6ftesi ] ( https://www.google.com.tr/search?q=izmir+k%c3%b6ftesi&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewimyyfrx9_oahujarqkhzzicy0q_auiccgb&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=667&amp;dpr=1#imgrc=s2jc59tons70om%3a ) here . 
  it is my fav type of meatball strongly recommend, 
  i definitely would support a public burqa ban , not only it is archaic and represents slavery of women but it also creates a security problem since it 's not possible to identfy someone wearing it and let be honest here nowadays europe are certainly not in a position to allow this kind of security loopholes . 
  i also support [ headscarf ban ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/headscarf_controversy_in_turkey ) in government institutions and public schools as it goes against the founding ideas of my country such as [ laiklik . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/la%c3%afcit%c3%a9 ) this is a bit more tricky though since not all countries have the same understanding of secularism even in europe . 
  burqa is a tradition that belongs to archaic times only . 
  its very origin is slavery of women in islamic societies . 
  its mere presence in the west should be seen as an insult to women rights . 
   well , yeah but the kurds of syria have nothing to gain from aggravating turkey pyd/ypg is a member of [ kck ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kurdistan_communities_union ) which means it has direct/organic ties to pkk . 
  this is not some disputed thing this is a fact and this fact alone is more than enough to aggravate the turkish public . 
   they lol, 
  that 's like me saying armenians wants turkey without turks . 
  so ya know that 's ' a bit ' rude and jerky, 
  in turkish , it is `` tanr\u0131 en b\u00fcy\u00fckt\u00fcr '' . 
  pretty sure we can do both, 
  \u0130zmir is the center of secularism in turkey , \u0130stanbul is politically pretty conservative actually if you compare it to other western turkish cities . 
  there are a lot of ` definite ' enemies down there but only one of them is truly dangerous for the future of turkish state and that one is n't assad . 
  * triggered *, 
   which do not enjoy economical prosperity of coast , ankara or istanbul i wonder why, 
  [ \u0130stanbul skyline ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/modern_istanbul_skyline.jpg ), 
  funny thing is ~ ~ op ~ ~ u/anephemeralthrowaway is actually a british turk and voted to leave . 
  those wealthy countries are `` radical islamists '' in the first place, 
  `` t\u00fcrk ' \u00fcn t\u00fcrk ` ten ba\u015fka dostu yoktur '' a very common saying here in turkey means `` the turk has no friend but the turk '', 
   saudi arabia or qatar above that . 
  got ta love political islam . 
  they are not our allies , they never been . 
  grand-grandfather of saudi house got executed by ottos in \u0130stanbul . 
  they never got over that shit and akp is still way too much `` liberal '' and `` secular '' for salafists/wahhabis . 
  the only reason akp cooperate with them is syrian crisis . 
  erdo wants assad gone and will do everything to achieve that but if you look back at egypt , it 's very clear how different his interests are with sa . 
  our only ally in me is \u0130srael . 
  erdo\u011fan tried to screw this for some sweet post arab spring political show but our relationship never really declined in the traditional sense for example trade actually doubled in latest shitshow of erdo . 
   why should i fuck offf ? 
  you should fuck off beause you are trying to whitewash a terrorist attack as i said in my first post there are plenty of places in this whole fukin country where you can target police/military without any civilian '' * collateral * * damage * '' . 
  middle of the fukin lstanbul and uni bus stop is not one of them . 
  so please gently fuck off random greek gamer dude on the internet that probably holds some meaningless histrical grudge before saying more stupid stuff and embarass yourself . 
   you can have secularism without banning the headscarf in schools for example . 
   we need avoid polarization  cahil anadolu \u00e7omar\u0131 ? 
  * sigh *,
