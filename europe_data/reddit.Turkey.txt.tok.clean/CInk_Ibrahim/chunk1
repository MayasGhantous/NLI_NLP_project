i do n't know if it still stands but that link only describes the current building and tells that `` it got disused after 1922 as there no orthodox community left . 
  it managed to survive until today because it was included into military area . '', 
   the only groups who have maintained some sort of ethnic identity differen to that of mainstream turkish are those groups that had become muslim before the ottomans ( kurds , circassians , tatars etc ) . 
  what is really odd is that some of them actually preserved their identity ( with various degrees ) yet still considers themselves turks . 
  as an example , a friend of mine is from a georgian muhacir ( refugee ) family . 
  he call himself georgian , considers his muslim identity above anything but he and his whole family are also hardcore supporters of mhp ( nationalist party ) . 
  here , i had found it in the past ;  when the island was occupied by greek navy [ in 1912 ] , greek soldiers were sent to villages and stationed themselves in the public squares . 
  some of us children ran to see what these greek soldiers , these hellenes , looked like . 
  `` what are you looking at ? '', 
  one of them asked . 
  `` at hellenes , '' we replied . 
  `` are you not hellenes yourselves ? '' he retorted . 
  `` no , we are romans '' . ^ [ source ] ( https://books.google.com.tr/books?id=iws0lh57nvwc&amp;lpg=pp1&amp;pg=pa42#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ), 
  they were mostly turkified . 
  ottoman [ millet system ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/millet_ ( ottoman_empire \\ ) ) meant that people were inside clearly defined groups based on religious affiliation . 
  adopting islam required change of whole lifestyle and leaving your community and joining another . 
  when a large community changed religion ( like albanians ) then preserving identity was easier but when it happened gradually , only choice was assimilation to larger one ( turks ) . 
  adding to this turkish ethnicity is quite adaptable and diverse thus it 's easier to be accepted by turks than greeks whom were quite exclusive . 
  also considering turkish lang . 
  ( either turks or palace educated people who got turkified ) dominated government bureaucracy , you can see how desireable it 's to adapt turkish and join the state apparatus . 
  as far as i know there were no big migration of greeks ( or anyone really ) until after ww1 . 
  how is it jewish ? 
  just because jews also use same name does n't mean anything . 
  kaplan literally means tiger in turkish . 
  and it 's a common surname . 
  is n't that how you have been acting all the time ? 
  how many years has it been since you have been dangling that eu membership carrot ? 
  how many of your demands we had to bear ? 
  just reject us already so that we can stop wasting time . 
  good idea but i would be even happier if we started using `` devlet-i aliyye '' officially . 
  wow , this is just absurd . 
  why in the hell would they release an isis suspect ? 
  but which interpretation does that support ? 
  how can you tell it supports `` literal '' interpretation and not orthodox one ? 
  especially since `` literal '' interpretation is quite recent movement . 
  and from what i understand that part says quran being the book ( for muslims ) without any doubt . 
  ~ ~ you have to give more context to this verse as it does n't really support your assertion . ~ ~ this [ link ] ( http://islamawakened.com/quran/2/2/ ) shows that it does n't say anything like you meant . 
  merely it being `` without doubt guidance for muslims '' . 
  it does n't even need 5 mins of googling ... 
  how does that give any support for `` literal interpretation '' ? 
  it merely says quran is guidance for muslims . 
  as a native i suggest visiting in september . 
  sea is a lot better since it is warm and heat is just right for visiting historical places . 
  though , visiting aspendos for opera festival is also great . 
  turkey , but it is more like reverse nodding . 
  edit : interestingly we make normal nod for yes , so it must be even harder for foreigners to differentiate . 
  well , it is kind of complicated but gist of it is that we are all turks , we speak `` language of turks '' ( turkish ) but we are all talking in different dialects . 
  i do n't tell my dialect name when it is not needed but i actually speak `` istanbul turkish '' ( with antalya accent ) . 
  an azerbaijani is also a turk and speaks `` azerbaijani turkish '' as you can see there is no one that speaks just `` turkish '' . 
  there is no logical parent group and we are all subgroups . 
  we get to use it mostly because we rarely interact with other turks and we are the biggest group among turks . 
  nationalism fucks this up so it is a lot more complicated in reality . 
  well , sorry for not meeting your expectations , i guess ? 
  seriously , i do n't like any gender segregation because i do n't think it is useful and prone to very big problems . 
  but i do n't think it is something illogical . 
  men and women are not exactly same physically . 
  there seems to be enough physical differences that makes it justifiable for holding sports separately . 
  and men ca n't be pregnant as far as i know and this also changes things . 
  there is also the idea that changing status quo is not worth it unless there are clear advantages . 
  it seems a lot easier than defending religion or politicians and people do those all the time . 
  why not ? 
  please explain and i can play devil 's advocate on this . 
  i think i can defend that position quite well . 
  sadly i am busy right now but feel free to start and i will try to answer with a good argument . 
  you are moving the goalposts and trying to fill the blank with a stereotype . 
  all these things you said are different things with different level of support from both erdogan and turkish people in general . 
  we can talk about them as well but first i shall ask again ;  so , why would she ask her husband about this ? 
  both the article the op posted and the article you used did n't imply whether she should ask her husband ( or anyone else ) about her opinions . 
  you take you preconceptions and act as if they support it . 
  maybe they do but then you did n't give any source showing that . 
  and i explained that when muslims say they do n't support equality , they can also mean something else than what european people understand . 
  we are not you , we have a different culture and mentality . 
  and you have to take into account who said this , where they said it , and whom did they say this . 
  else you take it out of context and risk slandering people . 
  you take things you heard about muslims then fit them into a stereotype and act as if erdogans also support it . 
  how do you know it is `` actually oppression '' ? 
  i know people ( including women ) that support similar things and they are quite sincere about their thoughts . 
  you do n't have to support it but it is not `` sick '' and it has logical consistency . 
   also who is to decide which rights are proper for men and which rights are proper for women . 
  who is to judge this ? 
  * same ones that decided it before . 
  for turkey it is turkish people , not you or anyone else . 
  did europeans ask us when they were doing their laws ? 
  no they did it themselves according to their own culture and situation . 
  now they are trying to force their values unto us . 
  act as if we are monsters for being who we are . 
   as far as mr & misses erdogan ... it looks like an oxymoron one to say that not all `` roles '' are proper for women ( actually says stay home with the kids ) and the other one to call women to take more `` roles '' in society . 
  one of them is a hypocrite it seems . 
  i do n't see him asking to ban women from taking different roles . 
  where did you read this ? 
  not on the articles of op and you posted . 
  his own daughter and wife are very active on social projects , so he clearly does n't mean only `` stay home with the kids '' . 
  wanting different roles for men and women or putting what he called `` motherhood '' does n't necessarily mean women have to stay home . 
   so if i may ask you ... how can you not see that ? 
  i see many wrong things supported by erdogan but i do n't read into his `` intents '' because that is fallacy . 
  you can claim things are going become like that but then talk about those , not this or that individual . 
  many muslims see men and women as unequal but nuance here is they do n't mean that as men should have more rights . 
  they see both men and women as having different rights and duties . 
  as in equal amount of rights but not same rights . 
  they do n't ask for women being slaves , only different rights for both of them .
