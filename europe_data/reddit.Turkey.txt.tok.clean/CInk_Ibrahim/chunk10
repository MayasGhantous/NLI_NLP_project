  thus he and his followers were the pivot that created the safavid state . 
  it was iranians that bowed down to turkmen , not the other way around . 
   just because shah ismael was of turkish origin , and it had some religious mumbo jumbo , the safavids do not become turkish . 
  it does . 
  one does n't lose his ethnicity after conquering some place . 
  we conquered eastern roman empire and we are still oghuz . 
  todays ancestors of todays azerbaijani turks were the ones that created the safavid state . 
  and those ancestors include thousands upon thousands of people that came from anatolia and other turkmen groups nearby . 
   safavid empire was not turkish state . 
  it was . 
  did it become more persianized as centuries passed , yeah . 
  but its foundations stayed same . 
  it can be either considered turkic or turco-persian . 
  just like ottomans . 
  by the way all turkic beyliks in anatolia ( including karamanids ) used persian for their state work , do you also consider them persian ? 
  this is ridiculous . 
   for your information , mehmet the second was half greek . 
  does ottoman empire become greek or what is this logic really ? 
  blood does n't determine ethnicity but culture . 
  mehmed was culturally turkish . 
  his native language was turkish , he was the leader of a cultural branch of oghuz , called himself han , etc. . 
  pretty much every outsider saw him as a turk . 
  anatolian turks are genetically closest to the native anatolians but we are not fucking hittites . 
  i certainly am not a greek or a lycian . 
  imho those that became turks out of choice were smart ones , those that did through sword were weak shits . 
  better this way . 
   safavids were referred as `` ajams '' by the ottomans . 
  care to know what ajam means ? 
  iranian in arabic . 
  and central anatolia was called `` rum '' until few centuries ago . 
  does that make turkmen tribes and beyliks greek ? 
  iran was predominantly populated by iranians for centuries . 
  that is why we called it ajam . 
  yet they were ruled by turks until very recently . 
  ( even today , some people call azerbaijani turks are sometimes called `` acem '' . ), 
  also no , ajam has a complicated history and meaning . 
  certainly not just used for `` persians '' . 
   that 's like saying turkey is full kurds . 
  ridiculous . 
  they are minority in iran . 
  turks were minority in ottoman empire for a while as well . 
  does n't change anything . 
  iran was ruled by turks for centuries and they did it while being a minority . 
  power of sword changes a lot . 
  albanians taking roles in the government did n't make ottomans non-turkish . 
  ( not to say they do n't have a share . 
  it is not a zero sum game . ), 
  safavids were at least turkish as it was persian . 
   this has nothing to do with safavids not being turkish , i did not say our history started with ottomans . 
  seljuks and ottomans were of turkish dynasties , granted . 
  safavid ? 
  you got ta be kidding me . 
  and are azerbaijani turks not the other branch of oghuz turks which made up the seljuks ? 
   fetret means period of leaderless rule . 
  history is full of these . 
  hungary had a baby king for fuck sake . 
  it was a civil war with ottoman state being split up and fighting against each other . 
  it was completely different than regular dynastic wars between princes . 
  edit : i think i explained my points quite well . 
  i am not gon na argue for minute details . 
  also stop playing definition games like europeans . 
  just few days ago , there were also a guy in / r/turkey who doubted turkish people being t\u00fcrkmen . 
  what you are doing is no different . 
   give me a break . 
  safavid empire was not turkish . 
  you were going somewhat well until this part . 
  * shah ismail was a lot more turkish than yavuz and literally has a whole fucking diwan written in turkish . 
  ( not to disrespect yavuz but it is true : / ) he was also the sheikh of a sufi order that was one of the most influential among turks . 
  it had hundreds of thousands of adherent and today has millions . 
  it is called safaviyya/ardabili order and its adherents called q\u0131z\u0131lbash / alevi . 
  he was brought up among these people and his whole fucking army consisted of them . 
  not to mention how fanatical they were . 
  shah ismail were certainly not assimilated . 
  what is next ? 
  are we also gon na discuss turkishness of pir sultan abdal ?!, 
   the empire set the modern ground of iranian politics by adapting shiite islam as state-ideology which even sets the iranian policies in middle-east today , and you guys believe that was turkish . 
  yes , it was turned into shiite state by turks . 
  and not even in a peaceful way . 
  but with sword , blood , and whole fucking heap of corpses . 
  persians only joined safavids after the victories . 
  and without much choice . 
  for fucks sake , even the anti-turk policies of iran state was led by turks !, 
   ottoman-safavid struggle was a power struggle between turkey and iran , over dominating middle-east . 
  yeah , so ? 
  by the way , both sides in the chaldiran was completely turkish . 
  many families had people fighting on both sides . 
  it was war between turks . 
   we should stop making everything turkish as this is getting ridiculously funny , and also embarrassing . 
  you are the one getting ridiculous . 
  turks are who we are and if you think we will cut off parts of our history for your convenience , you are very wrong . 
  and iran is still full of turks . 
  our history did n't start with ottomans and wo n't end with them . 
  * you forgot about fetret ( ottoman interregnum ) though . 
   ypg has always condemned pkk terror attacks against turkey lol [ look at the poster in this article very carefully ] ( https://www.dailysabah.com/politics/2016/04/06/ankara-suicide-bombers-posters-spotted-in-pyd-controlled-derik-in-syria ) ( yes , i know it is a bad source but poster is real . ) . 
  this is from al-malikiyah town under ypg control . 
  big guy is abdullah \u00d6calan aka founder of pkk . 
  one on the top left side is seher \u00c7a\u011fla demir . 
  she is responsible for the suicide bombing attack in the middle of ankara and caused death of 37 people and wounded 125 ** ( in front of a fucking bus stop in most crowded place in ankara ) ** . 
  one on the middle left is abd\u00fclbaki s\u00f6mer . 
  he is responsible for death of 25 military personnel who were ** doing their daily duties and were completely outside combat zones ** .
