  i think it is a reasonable position to argue . 
  i still do n't agree with it but this is nearly always misinterpreted ( probably on purpose ) . 
  so , why would she ask her husband about this ? 
   know that a rose without thorns has never been plucked we have a saying similar to that . 
  meaning there is no rose without thorns . 
  well , i think openly insulting people should be illegal . 
  i would n't want to live in a place where people can say anything they want about others . 
  though , there are a lot of things we should improve . 
  what is criticising and what is insulting should be made more clear . 
  public figures should be protected less than ordinary citizens . 
  but insulting ideas , beliefs , dead people who died long ago , etc ( victimless crimes ) should be free . 
  let 's call it the great savoyard wall . 
  you do n't need dlcs , everyone uses dlcs of the host . 
  i tried mp for the first time today and it was a lot of fun . 
  sorry for this . 
  but everything else i would want have been picked already . 
  so i would like to keep it if it is ok . 
  i will try it then . 
  i hate starting with big nations anyway . 
  i never player mp before . 
  is florence hard to play in mp ? 
  my kurdish friends are mostly islamist and prefer to put muslim identity over their kurdish one . 
  so idea of ummet ( unity of muslims ) is more important for them . 
  so they consider turkey as an inclusive state for all muslims , just like ottomans . 
  why would an islamist kurd who identifies as primarily muslim vote for huda-par when there are other islamists parties ( akp , saadet , etc. . ) . 
  there are also many kurds who also consider themselves as turks just like georgians , bulgarians , arabs , etc. 
  largest separatist movement is pkk because islamists in most cases are not separatists ( or kurdish nationalists ) . 
  akp and hdp splits most kurdish votes between them and , it is hard to tell who gets more since we do n't really differentiate between kurds and turks . 
  my guess is akp gets more in total but hdp certainly gets more in south eastern region . 
   the position of ` khan ' was nowhere to be found in their hierarchy even though the word itself is still in use in turkey . 
  actually it was used in conjunction with sultan . 
  if you check [ here ] ( http://www.kultur.gov.tr/en,31977/ottoman-sultans.html ) , you will see most of them added '' * han * '' to their names . 
  like '' * kanuni sultan suleyman han * '' meaning '' * sultan suleiman khan the law-giver * '' ( europeans used suleiman the magnificent ) . 
  first sultans used * ghazi * meaning veteran and warrior of faith . 
  but after ottomans got bigger became more than a mere frontier principality , they started using * sultan * and * han * titles together . 
   it all means that the word ` khan ' although might be used to title a king , is far from being the equivalent of the european title . 
  i think you are right about this . 
  while we continued to used * khan * for crimean tatar monarchs , it is not really same with european title . 
  difference is , there were some kind of hierarchy with european rulers but there was no such thing for us . 
  nobility passing and inheriting titles between dynasties did n't happen for turks . 
  after all , we did n't have aristocracy except for the main dynasty members . 
  ( if egypt governor [ ali ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/muhammad_ali_of_egypt ) had managed to win against ottoman sultan , he could have taken his position . 
  even though he was originally son of a merchant , no one would care . ), 
  closest thing to hierarchy for rulers was * bey * which literally meant * lord * . 
  not that i know of . 
  i just added - s to mean multiple . 
  just try with `` padishah '' . 
  but guessing from pictures , it must be number of gears that you turn on the padlocks . 
  my google-fu fails to find anything else about it . 
  i fixed my comment . 
  ottoman padishahs saw themselves above everyone else including holy roman emperors and rejected to be seen as equal to them so it is more like emperor than king . 
  as a side note , we never called our monarchs * kings * but always * khans * , * sultans * or most commonly * padishahs * . 
  as far as i know we use * kral * exclusively for foreigners . 
  edit : just in case there is not a misunderstanding , * padishah * actually means emperor . 
  that is why we never use it with names since there is only one padishah . 
  ( ex : * sultan murat han * is ok . * padishah murat * is not but calling him '' * our padishah * '' is also ok . ) . 
  it was a pleasure , thanks for reading . 
  eastern ( especially ottoman and byzantine ) gov. 
  systems deserve another look at how they managed multiculturalism and maintained stability without constant infighting between cultural groups . 
  now that i look at it again , i failed on grammar a lot . 
  i should stop writing things so late at night . 
   i would n't like that one bit . 
  me neither . 
  some people seem to think if nato kicks turkey , turkey will magically disappear . 
  i shall try to explain it as much as i understand . 
  i must ask you to not come to conclusions prematurely because when it comes to islam things are a lot more complicated and context changes many things . 
  i guess this is true for everything but if you take islam and evaluate it in comparison to christianity , you will surely misunderstand even most basic parts . 
  and yes , it will be long ...  i heard that islamic state are killing their fellow muslims in syria for minor violations of islamic custom , like eating in daytime during the ramadan , and that they justify it by accusing them of being apostates . 
  isis follows a relatively modern reform movement called salafism/wahhabism . 
  it is kind of similar to what protestant movement is to catholicism . 
  they are claiming to take islam back to its roots and purify it from later additions . 
  now , you have to understand that islamic law works , is similar to how modern law works with quran and sunnah being the framework , then building upon precedent rulings by other judges to decide on laws . 
  this is called taqlid ( imitating ) . 
  so these people reject these rulings and try to do it again but instead of taking past rulings they want to use primary sources ( quran/sunnah ) to decide on everything . 
  they are also literalist and strict as in they consider whatever is written should be applied even in cases of metaphors and application is without excuses . 
  this `` without excuses '' part is very problematic for mainstream islam as sinning does n't make someone non muslim . 
  another problem is declaring people apostates . 
  yes , there are precedents of such thing happening but it was extremely rare occurrence . 
  because as in many islamic laws , repentance is an important part on how judge decides . 
  one could n't just declare another person an apostate , only way for such a case to occur is it the perpetrator is openly declaring islam as a false religion . 
  anything less he will most certainly get away with lesser punishment . 
  and so long as someone says they are muslim , no one can really say he is not . 
  others can say he is a sinner and tell wrong things but he will still say a muslim . 
  in turkey many people drink and flaunt every principle of islam but they are still muslims according to sunni ( specifically hanafi ) school . 
  in theory people could be punished with death for thievery but in practice unless there were other big crimes accompanied , it never applied . 
  randomly googling i found [ this article ] ( http://dokuman.tsadergisi.org/dergiler_pdf/2008/2008-agustos/4.pdf ) talking about number of people accused with thievery during 16th to 18th centuries in the city of bursa ( one of the bigger cities in turkey ) . 
  across 2 hundred years , 1 to 9 people got killed out of 29 thievery cases . 
  what are the changes that there were only 29 thiefs in a big city ? 
  you have to understand one of the main intentions of law during that time is to make a warning to other people who might try . 
  so in practice only few people got killed even for such laws . 
  but if you look at isis they judge dozens to death every day . 
   are islamic state really practicing an authentic version of sharia law ? 
  if not , then how can muslims even believe that there is only one `` true interpretation '' of the quaran ? 
  in one of the suras inside quran tells that god will protect the quran from being corrupted unlike other holy books . 
  so for a muslim , quran is protected in case of both its writing and its meaning . 
  so whatever meaning quran has ( single or multiple ) , they are intended and it is still commands of god . 
  now , there are many differing views on this , but my own understanding ; ** single ** : there is no reason for god to put different views so there must be one meaning that is right every time . 
  just like how rights and wrong do n't change so must the teachings of islam must be universal . 
  ** multiple ** : times and cultures change so god must have considered its teaching to be right for each and every one of these cases . 
  so all interpretations can be true depending on context .
