  `` button for cutting internet . 
  may it be auspicious for our country . '', 
  reminds me of this : [ harley tevhidson ] ( https://i.redd.it/qav8vh9fjjgx.jpg ), 
  if you are interested , check [ this awesome thread at / r/askhistorians ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/4r17fc/what_lead_to_the_ottoman_empire_decriminalizing/ ) . 
  it talks about decriminalization in 1858 and also about how homosexuality were seen in the ottoman empire . 
  it is enlightening to say least ... 
  wow , you are like 1000 times more patient than me when arguing against trolls/delusional people . 
  much respect . 
  well , islam considers christianity to be corrupted after the death of jesus . 
  so while they accept that muslims and christians worship same god , they say christians are doing * shirk * . 
  [ * shirk * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shirk_\\ ( islam \\ ) ) is deitification of a lesser being or associating such lesser being with god . 
  in this context , trinitarian christians associate jesus with god . 
  islam considers prophets as an exemplary humans whom are loved by god but not divine beings . 
  the concept of the oneness of the god ( aka [ tawhid ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tawhid ) ) is very important aspect of islam . 
  so yeah , same god but trinitarian christians divide god into multiple aspects and even associate jesus with god ( which is a big no for muslims ) . 
  k\u00e2fir ( tdk ) : - someone that rejects existence or unity of the god g\u00e2vur ( tdk ) : 1 . 
  not being a muslim 2 . 
  being without a religion infidel ( google ) : 1 . a person who has no religion or whose religion is not that of the majority . 
  2 . adhering to a religion other than that of the majority . 
  -- according to these , gavur has nearly same meaning as infidel but kafir has different meaning . 
  - a kafir that rejects existence of the god can not be a muslim thus must be a gavur . 
  a kafir that accepts non-unitarian god might claim to be a muslim but most muslims ( % 99 + ) will also consider them as gavurs . 
  - a gavur might believe in the unity of god so does n't have to be a kafir ( ex . 
  nontrinitarian christians ) . 
  so kafir is a special case of gavurs that also rejects unity of god . 
  edit : afaik , we use `` gavur '' as a rude version of `` foreigner '' . 
  but kafir is used like `` nonbeliever '' so has bigger religious component . 
  but dictionary says otherwise , so i am not sure . 
  i will just leave this article that talks about claims of both sides : [ can gas save cyprus ? 
  the long-term cost of frozen conflicts ] ( http://blog.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/2013/03/22/can-gas-save-cyprus-the-long-term-cost-of-frozen-conflicts/ ), 
  yeah , they do n't shy away from using economic ties as a political leverage . 
  i think every turkish businessman will think twice before investing in russia or taking a gov. 
  contract there . 
  it says that every mosque in ottoman empire had tap water . 
  and hammams ( turkish baths ) were established in every region . 
  ( even in cyprus ) . 
  so yes , there was at least rudimentary sewage system . 
  more importantly there was water in every town ( probably not in villages ) . 
  in my experience , water and cleanness is a big part of our culture . 
  and every old town you visit will have at least few historical fountains . 
  building small fountains was considered an important charity and it continues today . 
  in istanbul there are thousands of disused old fountains every few streets . 
  and every old mosque has a place for storing water in the middle of courtyard . 
  it would be impossible to do namaz ( daily ritual prayer ) since it requires ritual cleansing first . 
  we also have many idioms about cleanness and some insulting ( sometimes racist ) remarks about uncleanness . 
  edit : [ here is ] ( https://books.google.com.tr/books?id=or3j_gnhjoac&amp;pg=pa266&amp;lpg=pa266&amp;dq=ottoman+sewage&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wx1j6pmvgh&amp;sig=wu__bq_--ysn7v75zwbefitxv5i&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiyvkccwotoahubvhqkhcnrb70q6aeiqjah#v=onepage&amp;q=ottoman%20sewage&amp;f=false ) a book that talks about problems of sewage in istanbul which got worse after 1590s because of neglect . 
  it also says there were 15 major aqueducts and total 120 kms of waterways , managed by a guild of professional hydraulic engineers filling as many as 1000 fountains . 
  his motives were obvious from the start . 
  eu only needed and still needs do one thing , ignore our internal politics . 
  stop interfering with our country and supporting some group or other based on broken understanding . 
  they do n't understand turkey or even want to . 
  then why in the fuck do they think it may be a good idea to interfere ? 
  maybe . 
  i do n't think anyone knows for sure . 
  and not everyone can be categorized as this or that group . 
  as you probably know , turkish people today have descended from people of various ethnicities that was assimilated to turkish identity . 
  if we are descended from greeks , when did they stop being greeks ? 
  after they changed religion ? 
  after changing language ? 
  after few generations ? 
  after they decided to identify as turks ? 
  after they left behind old customs ? 
  there have always been people that carries more than one identity with various degrees . 
  and many turks would consider language as the biggest identifier of being a turk . 
  so in my eyes they were as turkish as me . 
  as for their origin , who knows ? 
  the wikipedia page i linked says that they did n't adopt greek national identity . 
  so were they greeks if they rejected to call themselves greeks ? 
  can someone be a greek while rejecting ancient greeks but accepting being romans ? 
  i think these questions are not so easily answered . 
  i think its wrong to push contemporary identities onto people in the past . 
  as two nations that fought , intermarried , lived together hundreds of years , i doubt there is anything we can not both trace continuity from . 
  but well , fell free to do otherwise . 
  these turks became christians and wrote turkish using greek alphabet : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/karamanlides, 
  cahil : uneducated , without knowledge anadolu : anatolia \u00c7omar : someone who is rude , aggressive and without manners . 
  ( also herding dog ) result : anatolian redneck, 
   why ? 
  each country should be able to decide what can and ca n't be said in the country . 
   well , i did n't decide on european values nor about european laws . 
  your own people did . 
  i am a turkish citizen and we only obey international laws when they are convenient to us . 
  we are pretty unashamed about not only ignoring international laws but also our own laws . 
  they even gives us fines as punishment and we just do n't pay . 
  if you do n't mind ignoring `` rule of law '' like us , feel free to do so . 
  i think you should suggest your gov. 
  to leave eu and take of their signature wherever this thing called `` freedom of expression '' happens to be protected . 
  it 's your country and you have sovereignty after all . 
  :d  if i were to pubicly ridicule atat\u00fcrk and piss on a turkish flag i would get very different reactions in the us , turkey or russia . 
  and for a good reason . 
  you want to be a guest in our country ? 
  respect the house rules !, 
  well , the point is your own laws binds you to `` european court of human rights '' . 
  i think as per your house rules '' [ echr decisions are binding throughout the confines of the european council ; they set a precedent ] ( http://hakikatadalethafiza.org/en/the-echrs-ruling-on-perincek-does-not-invalidate-our-reasons/ ) '' so it 's ok to deny it in austria then ? 
  ^ disclaimer : ^ i ^ do n't ^ deny ^ genocides ^ of ^ armenian ^ / ^ greek ^ / ^ assyrian ^ / ^ circassian ^ / ^ ottoman ^ muslims ^ in ^ balkans ^ / ^ azerbaijani/etc . 
  so are you not bound by `` european court of human rights '' ? 
  look , i am fine with calling it a genocide but parliaments should not decide what is genocide ( a crime ) or not . 
  and `` general consensus '' is not a really useful parameter to decide it . 
  these things should happen at impartial courts with possibility of accused to defend itself . 
  i am not sure but did n't holocaust taken to the court and proven legally . 
  but armenian genocide is different .
