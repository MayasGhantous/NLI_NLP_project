  but uber and booking.com is not really same since booking brings foreign tourists . 
  instead of banning it , they should have prevented turkish credit cards from working at booking.com thus destroying money they take from local tourists . 
  of course , it depends whether booking would be open to negotiating for local taxes instead of leaving it like that . 
  yeah , it seems a foreigner that came to turkey during that time wrote it in a book . 
  but that is kind of extreme and i really doubt he said such a thing publicly . 
  whether he was an atheist or not is not certain . 
  simply because he did a lot of contradictory stuff on that subject . 
  and we do n't know what he actually thinks . 
  of course there are some things that no sincere muslim would say . 
  for example in one of his letters , he was calling a verse from quran something like `` nonsense '' which is a big no . 
  on the opposite side ; there was a religious singer h\u00e2f\u0131z * kem\u00e2l g\u00fcrses whom atat\u00fcrk is said to love listening and even give his surname . 
  and daughter of this singer quotes his father as praising atat\u00fcrk 's knowledge on islam and his use of arabic . 
  there are also accounts of him gifting people valuable copies of quran . 
  so we ca n't really `` conclusively '' decide which is right . 
  my personal opinion is that he was n't decided and was having doubts about islam . 
  but i doubt he was an atheist . 
  he was most likely deist or just cultural muslim . 
  * title for people who can recite quran from memory, 
  whole point of creating secular nationalist identity was to keep people together as much as possible with a single unifying idea . 
  they tried to steer it away from islam , not for the sake of itself but because it was not working . 
  islam was simply too loose of an idea and it was not keeping anyone together . 
  also arabs had rebelled ; our muslim brothers stabbed us in the back . 
  would n't people ask `` what about them ? '', 
  but secular nationalist identity was still based on sunni islam ( a subset of it , namely muslims loyal to the ottoman state ) . 
  that is why diyanet does n't include alevis . 
  ( at least % 10 of population . 
  why would they not include them inside diyanet and connect cemevleri/dedes , etc to the state ? ), 
  that is why turkish speaking christians were included in population exchange with greece . 
  single look at your comment history show that you spend your time on reddit mostly ( ~ % 90 + ) bashing turks . 
  honest question , just why ? 
  do n't you have anything else to do ? 
  do you really think you are not-racist ? 
  i mean ** a whole fucking year ** spent on attacking an ethnic group and you still complain about being labeled racist ? 
  -- ^ ^ ^ ( to ^ ^ others , ^ ^ go ^ ^ to ^ ^ his ^ ^ profile ^ ^ and ^ ^ ctrl-f : ^ ^ `` turk '' . 
  ^ ^ ~ 70 ^ ^ on ^ ^ each ^ ^ page ^ ^ and ^ ^ nothing ^ ^ else ^ ^ except ^ ^ turks , ^ ^ kurds ^ ^ and ^ ^ turkey ^ ^ after ^ ^ ~ 10 ^ ^ pages ^ ^ that ^ ^ i ^ ^ checked . ), 
  it is the akp 's ( erdogan 's party ) mouthpiece . 
  i also say this about many things but they are completely right this time . 
  there is only choice between bad and bad . 
  if they cave in , erdogan will say `` muh , we are stronk !, 
  '' ; if they do n't , erdogan will say `` they are nazis !, 
  do n't take his word because it is bullshit . 
  asian genes in modern turks are only about % 10 . 
  we are mostly descended from local anatolians and migrants ( balkan muslims , crimeans , circassians , etc. . ) muslim men can marry a christian women ( not vice versa ) , so mixed marriages were common . 
  and conversions caused most of the populace to `` become turk '' across centuries . 
  the slowness of this is the main reason for the converts to not retain their identity . 
  in places where mass conversions happened , they retained their identity quite well . 
  ( bosniaks and albanians . 
  maybe roma and pomaks as well . ), 
  to give an example , in 1583 % 44 of muslims , whom constituted the majority in trabzon , was either first or second generation converts . 
  so imagine , after 500 years after its conquest , half of the muslims were recent converts . 
  and since black sea was greek in the past , half of muslims were ethnically greeks . 
  edit : by the turkish conquest , anatolians had already been hellenized . 
  by 6th century anatolian languages became extinct , so they were greeks for at least 4 centuries . 
  yes , closing parties are part of the problem . 
  to be honest , whole thing is a mess of bad and changing politics . 
  i am too tired to explain it in detail but let me say that ; there is a good reason/justification but bad implementation . 
  sure , they are terrorism supporters/sympathizers but they also have embedded themselves into a section of population . 
  ( half of the kurds & far leftist/liberal turks with huge grey areas and ethno nationalistic/tribal nuances . 
  it is complicated . ), 
  root of the problem is not solved yet our politicians are pushing the problem under the rug , repeatedly . 
  it has come to a point that status quo has become unacceptable and i think it is going to blow up on our face . 
  and i am % 100 sure that no one will be happy with the outcome . 
  they do n't vote for different parties . 
  all those different names are for the same party . 
  merely different selection out of the alphabet soup . 
  they use it to bypass laws through dividing responsibilities under multiple registered parties . 
  they also use it to divide and muddle the ground between actual supporter and mere local participants . 
  not to mention dozens upon dozens of ngos who ** coincidentally ** share similar governing structures , colors , symbols , ideas and cooperate completely in a way that rival centralized organizations . 
  oh , yeah , all of these parties , ngos , local groups , etc are completely separate and have no responsibility if any of them do something wrong . 
  but of course , affiliated lawyers who also ** coincidentally ** uses `` similar governing structures , colors , symbols , ideas '' will be ready defend them against * fascists * . 
  sorry if i got too sarcastic , i am merely tired of this shit . 
  we , turks , should do same things in europe . 
  just seeing them freak out about `` turkish invasion '' and being unable to stop it within their current legal framework would be worth the effort . 
  here is percentages for each region in turkey : region | math | reading | science -- | -- | -- | -- oecd | 0:490 | 0:493 | 0:493 w. marmara | -2.2 | -0.6 | -0.2 e. marmara | -3.4 | 0.2 | -1.0 c. anatolia | -3.8 | 2.0 | -2.8 aegea | -5.1 | 0.0 | -3.7 w. anatolia | -6.1 | -1.4 | -3.0 istanbul | -6.9 | -1.4 | -5.1 e. black sea | -9.6 | -3.0 | -5.7 mediterranean | -9 | -4.1 | -6.3 w. black sea | -12.7 | -6.5 | -7.5 ne . 
  anatolia | -19 | -14.2 | -16.4 according to [ this table ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/turkey/comments/5v0dyl/pisaaverage_score_in_mathematics_europe/ddya1ac/ ) . 
  edit : these values seems to be wrong .

  thanks . 
  seeing how i am squeezed between bigger powers , i think it is going to be very challenging . 
  i would like to reserve qara qoyunlu . 
  that escalated quickly . 
  no , you are wrong . 
  leaders of those countries might have been mongols but their people were mostly turkic from the beginning . 
  that is why they adopted turkic as the language as time passed . 
  mongols were never really numerous . 
  retaining '' ** political and legal institutions ** '' does n't change ethnicity , only state system . 
  it was the rulers that turkified not peoples . 
  even if they did , their ethnicity is turkic now , simply because language is the main factor of ethnicity for much of the world . 
  and only thing that really divided mongols and turks were language as they came from the same region and lived side by side for who knows how long . 
  it is absurd to call them mongols . 
  bosniaks were part of * muslim millet * which were the ruling community of the ottoman empire . 
  ottoman culture was a product of dozens of ethnicities coming together and taking out bosniaks would be absurd . 
  and considering that bosniaks produced disproportionately more bureaucrats for the empire , i would say that they were as much part of ottomans as turks . 
  even today , most turks would be uncomfortable with idea of classifying them as foreigners .

  great post . 
   funny . . the exact same sentence can be said about when the ottomans occupied or captured constantinople . 
  it was a church and you came to our lands and took em and spat in our faces by making it a mosque .
