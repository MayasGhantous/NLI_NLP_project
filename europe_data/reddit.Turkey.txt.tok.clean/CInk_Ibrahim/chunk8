  see how it can be used both ways ? 
  if you 're basing your whole argument on `` they did it too first '' , you 're wrong cause you did it first . 
  i am not basing it on `` they did it too first '' , no need to assume stuff . 
  greeks are completely right to be salty about stuff we did . 
  i am giving the reasons why we are angry and why we should answer this disrespect towards us . 
  i do n't see the world as being white and black . 
   regardless , like i 've mentioned before , both are wrong the way i see it . 
  turning a church into a mosque or a mosque into a church are both shitty and petty . 
  i agree that it is shitty but pettyness depends on the circumstances . 
  hagia sophia was turned into mosque to declare islam being supreme and the conquest of constantinople . 
  it had a big propaganda effect which continues today , albeit diminished . 
   a lot of old small churches are left abandoned and without repairs as well . 
  there 's a shitload of them sometimes it 's not possible to restore them all . 
  there are many more important and bigger mosques that are being preserved in many countries however . 
  that 's not a justification for what turkey is doing . 
  yeah , not repairing them because of the lack of resources and other priorities is completely understandable but i am not talking about such cases . 
   not repairing a mosque is nowhere near as insulting or provoking as converting it into a worship site for a different religion ( considering it 's being done out of spite like you 've admitted ) . 
  yes , but question is why should we be the ones that stomach the insult when the other side did/does similar stuff . 
  let 's see what you think about these ; [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvr9q_bbssk ) is from a discussion about hagia sophia between historians . 
  it is in turkish but i linked the relevant parts at correct times , you will see they are showing some pictures . 
  - [ first one ] ( https://youtu.be/kvr9q_bbssk?t=18m48s ) is about a famous mosque ( made by pargal\u0131 ibrahim pasha ) in kavala turned into a ** tavern and its ceiling being covered with indecent pictures ** . 
  - [ second ] ( https://youtu.be/kvr9q_bbssk?t=19m10s ) is a mosque ( made by bayezid i ) in drama which is used as a church . 
  - [ third one ] ( https://youtu.be/kvr9q_bbssk?t=20m18s ) is a prayer stand ( made during time of mehmet the conqueror ) and other picture show that it was made into an orthodox shrine ?!, 
  - [ fourth one ] ( https://youtu.be/kvr9q_bbssk?t=20m42s ) was also made by ibrahim pasha in kavala , it is , as you can see , being used as a church . 
  [ sixth one ] ( https://youtu.be/kvr9q_bbssk?t=21m40s ) show how its dome looks today.ibrahim pasha must have loved jesus a lot for making a mosque with his picture . 
  / s - [ fifth one ] ( https://youtu.be/kvr9q_bbssk?t=22m18s ) is tomb of beyazid baba . 
  they even turned tomb of a ** muslim guy ** into a church . 
  mind that his remains are still inside . 
  i would say worse could happen but as we can see it already does . 
  - [ seventh one ] ( https://youtu.be/kvr9q_bbssk?t=22m29s ) is from macedonia about a mosque ( known as imaret mosque ) that got destroyed and replaced with a church . 
  - [ eight one ] ( https://youtu.be/kvr9q_bbssk?t=22m48s ) is faik pasha mosque ( they pronounced the location as `` navra '' but i could n't find the transliteration ) . 
  it was used as a brothel . 
  yes , a ** brothel ** . 
  - [ ninth one ] ( https://youtu.be/kvr9q_bbssk?t=23m12s ) is s\u00fcleymaniye mosque ( it think was a church before and returned back to a church ) . 
  this one is actually understandable and justified , others are not . 
  - they also talk about mosques in thessaloniki that were tuned into night clubs . 
  - [ tenth one ] ( https://youtu.be/kvr9q_bbssk?t=23m48s ) was musa baba shrine in chios . 
  it was destroyed or more like demolished with explosives . 
  here they comment about it like this ; `` there were things that got destroyed here ( turkey ) as well '' , `` we would n't be sad about ones that get destroyed but these ... '' , `` we demolished some as well but not this way ( referring to purposeful destruction with explosives ) '' - [ eleventh one ] ( https://youtu.be/kvr9q_bbssk?t=24m8s ) is called hasan baba shrine and it seem they tried to destroy it with explosives but failed : / i guess we were both wrong when we assumed mosques not being turned into churches . 
  much worse stuff is being done . 
  only difference is our side pretty much forgot ( or was forced to forget by the state ) about them yet your side continue to whine . 
  as if it was not enough , europeans continue to whine about it as well . 
  ----------- i wo n't answer other parts because it is pretty much fallacy and insults . 
  ( at least you real feelings are showing through . ), 
  kinda funny that you are continuing to act as if i reject not caring about culture . 
  we are not pretending about our intentions . 
  we mostly care about our culture and marginally about others . 
  we also changed those churches into mosques to humiliate our enemies . 
  difference between your people and mine is that we are honest about what we are , yet your people are not . 
  we do not try to whitewash the history with falsehoods and coverups , in our view reality is quite fine . 
  we do not say `` muh history and culture '' instead of our real feelings . 
  we say `` if you insult us , we will return it back '' . 
  let 's be honest , your people are as bad as mine . 
  be open about it and give us truth , then we will respect you . 
  let 's not pretend as if your people do n't actually want istanbul and anatolia back . 
  --------- you do n't have to answer back if these do n't change your view at least a little bit . 
  i only bothered this much because i am interested in the subject . 
  also forgive if if i was being too snarky , it is not personal . 
   russia , turkey , and spain have close to no representation , hmm , if we had 2 in a thousand which is close to middle , we would have 150000 users . 
  wow , it sounds awful . 
  when so many turks gather in one place , it quickly becomes a miniature of youtube comment section . 
   mehmed probably the opposite . 
   kemal too maybe , he is a complicated person . 
   erdogan do n't care about opinions of those that usurp rights of orphans ( public properties ) . 
   having it as a museum is by no means disrespectful to you . 
  if anything it 's a compliment and that 's the kind of thing people respected kemal for . 
  how is it disrespecting to you by having it as a museum exactly ? 
  because you pass on a great opportunity to flaunt your dominance over a great monument ? 
  when istanbul was occupied after the ww1 , christians ( both local and foreigners ) flocked to hagia sophia , trying to pray inside . 
  again and again they got permissions and support from british and pressured ottoman administration . 
  they did this despite it being clear that it was a mosque and the imperial mosque at that . 
  they came to our lands and spit on our face ( figuratively ) . 
  yes , giving respect and forgiving those that disrespected you is a virtuous action and deserves respect . 
  but doing it at the expense of your ancestors and people is anything but virtuous . 
  i consider the situation of atat\u00fcrk making it a museum suspect and do not believe he did it with full knowledge . 
  if he actually did it then he should be ashamed and i would consider such an action as unbefitting for someone like him . 
   as far as i know mosques in greece or bulgaria are n't turned into churches . 
  they were simply destroyed outright or left to disrepair ( for much of ottoman heritage in balkans , leaving it is same as destroying them ) . 
   on the other hand , turkey is not only trying to turn hagia sophia into a mosque , it has already done this with other churches but we 're not talking about that . 
  it is already a mosque . 
   we 're talking about hagia sophia because it 's a huge monument that you could preserve as a museum unlike what you 're doing with other churches . 
  we can also preserve it as a mosque and my people can go and feel the same things as their ancestors did . 
  i fail to see how using it as a museum is preserving anything . 
  taking it and turning it into a zoo ( not much different ) only preserves building and nothing else . 
  culture is something that lives , and continuing traditions for centuries while keeping to their original meaning is the thing we should do . 
  there are traditions around hagia sophia that we still know and can save before it is too late . 
   that 's gold considering the ottoman empire used the parthenon as a gunpowder storage and was half responsible for the single greatest of our monuments getting blown the fuck up . 
  i wo n't say we cared about your heritage , we did n't . 
  for us it was same as any building . 
  and that explosion also caused deaths of hundreds of people but i guess it was our fault for using `` gunpowder storage '' . 
  i can understand that it was negligence but it was certainly not on purpose . 
  many many sites made by greeks still exists and slowly restored . 
  we do n't destroy them because `` muh evil greeks '' . 
   name one ottoman mosque of the scale of hagia sophia in the balkans for me please . 
  do n't tell me about random irrelevant mosques cause we 're not telling you about random irrelevant churches in turkey either . 
  we 're talking about something the size and importance of hagia sophia . 
  i thought it was about history and culture but as you clearly show it is about symbolism . 
  those `` random irrelevant '' mosques are part of our history and they are the `` history and culture '' of turkish people . 
  funny how you disregard them because of their size . 
  and yes , i realize you do n't give a shit about neither your own `` history and culture '' or ours , it is all about `` size and importance '' aka its symbolic value .
