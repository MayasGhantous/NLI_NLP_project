you cry liar but only speculate m8 . 
  perfect summary . 
  ... with computer guided laser missiles that release an atrociously awful fart odor and play slayer on dangerously high decibels on impact . 
  no , to the fsa .

  bailout denied . 
  news report that the pride walk was not officially allowed . 
  in turkey , big marches require comfirmation from the state so that the police can take cautionary measures . 
  ( it works the same way in europe and usa afaik ) however their reasoning to not accept is dubious ; `` it 's ramadan '' . 
  still , i have joined many pre-planned lgbt marches without any hassle or whatsoever in istanbul in past years . 
  so i guess they dont want to mix ramadan and any marches, 
  yeah , turkey hates syrian people , thats why they have 4 million refugees accepted ( which raised the crime rates significantly , mind you ) in their country and spent more than 5 billion $ so far . 
  calm down dude, 
  thats understandable . 
  they want education in their own language , which is nothing but fair . 
  just like catalans etc. 
  . . a fake highway ? 
  not to defend erdogan , but i think it 's humanitarian aid as fuck when someone 's coming to rip your head off your neck . 
  wow , even erdogan doesnt prevent lgbt from marching , feels weird, 
  i think ottoman empire and turkey are much more relevant to the history of europe than some of the current member states ( especially scanidivian ones ) . 
  its about how you define it , i 'm sure half the europe would suddenly feel we 're more european if we ever find an oil zone big enough, 
  turkey to stay blue for 21230912 more years, 
  plant a turkish flag and claim turkey is eu, 
  :-( guys ... 
  i know what the germans dont want ... * ** cue evil laughter **, 
  impressed with the stupidity i guess , pilot wins, 
  who in world can force americans , the british or the french to give up land ? 
  they are superpowers , if you damage their economy you damage world economy . 
  turkey in the other hand can be easily hurt with economic pressure as long as we 're not in the eu . 
  i suppose this is why turkey is holding cyprus and the genocide as a leverage . 
  but that 's just my opnion . 
  there 's only 1 butthurt turk as far as i can see . 
  some of us know that genocide happened but we refuse recognition because we do n't want to give land/money back , we 're poor as fuck . 
  killing innocent people was never okay, 
  upvoting a racist remark on a thread despising genocide , man i love reddit, 
  / prison, 
  i 'm a turk myself . 
  i wonder the reason behind why our population responded in such a curve . 
  it 's either because we `` fought '' religion off of our state once and grew very scared of it or the sample data does n't represent the population ( more likely ) . 
  either way it 's flaterring, 
  damn no , we 're not that cruel ... yet ... 
  its not racist to expect people to be racist ( * if * the assumption is '' * there are racist people * '' rather than '' * a majority lithuanians are racist * '' ), 
  i think they are being funded by / r/nottheonion, 
  i dont know why / r/europe is hating on us at the moment . 
  we warned france intelligence about mustefai ( one of the attackers in bataclan ) in 2010 and 2013 . 
  this chant nonsense is spreading bullshit . 
  fans were booing isis , it 's a clusterfuck . 
  we just lost 100 people to isis in ankara . 
  people have to realize that the closer you are to isis , the more you suffer . 
  is it the parts which include hospitals / s, 
  i do n't know man . 
  i feel like i got played . 
  i wish i could just step into `` does n't matter had sex '' psychology but she was too special for me . 
  cant ignore the annoying pain , almost suicidal, 
  so i got cheated on . 
  i spent 2 months with her trying to give her miracles . 
  the next day she leaves the country for uni , she cheats on me . 
  such is life . 
  absolutely depressed . 
  i hate everything i used to like . 
  wow it 's almost like it 's easier to rule when everyone obeys, 
  eu sent only 1 mil $ ( cue trump jokes ) of promised billions of $ . 
  eu got turkey to keep millions of syrians for 1 million $ . 
  that must say something . 
  i agree . 
  turkey will never join shangai 5 or eu . 
  her geopolitics dictates to be neutral / a bridge . 
  interesting , any source ? 
  kind of clickbait after reading this isnt it, 
  yup . 
  dutch helped greek flag invasion of turkish flag . 
  dutch then helped turks to draw a new flag right next to it . 
  dutch then draw a little heart in the middle ( with dutch colors ) . 
  and then they disappeared . 
  after that the heart was drawn . 
  the dutch and their nazi practices . . what are they up to ? 
  are they really just a really cool group of people , like an upgraded version of belgians ? 
  cyprus, 
  iceland - it 's christmas lads . 
  sanctions alienates the people , it doesnt accomplish the imagined consequence, 
  and a rather unique one : exploration of americas and new goldmines instantly devalues ottoman currency , which was gold . 
  guys please trust no one, 
  background : pkk militants enter a village and steal food & home supplies from a house while the residents are tending the farm . 
  they then report it to the police , soldiers come and ask where they are , kid goes with the soldiers to show them and dies when militants open fire . 
  actually schizophrenic 's are more likely to be abused themselves than harming someone else . 
  at least dsm-v says so, 
  the way i see it these people are nothing but organized criminals who uses religion as a tool . 
  as soon as central authority is distrupted they pop out . 
  the world should stop creating authority holes in the middle east that criminals can fill and that can only be achieved with a functional state in syria & iraq . 
  there are countries which sunni muslims doesnt behead people for the fuck of it . 
  but thats just my turkish bias, 
  sociopathy and schizophrenia are very different things, 
  can we at least start the negotiations, 
   get your military out of cyprus . 
  my military ? 
  if greece did not want taf in cyprus , greece should 've avoided ethnic cleansing in cyprus during the dicta regime . 
  or win the war . 
  not here to warmonger .
