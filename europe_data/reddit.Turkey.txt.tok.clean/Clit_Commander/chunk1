nah , it 's more like our first , last and only line of defense . 
  turkish people love and strongly believe in conspiracy theories , and this myth is part of it . 
  edit : but like / u/zerocoolthephysicist and some others in this thread already said , those feelings are mutual and thus reassure turkish people that they are right in disliking others ... 
  i tagged you as `` best friend , would help me burry corpses '' . 
  [ did we just became best friends !?!?!, 
  ] ( http://weknowmemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/did-we-just-become-best-friends-yep.gif ), 
  yes , and can you please help me burry the `` donor '' ? 
  that 's our emotional shield , we expect nothing from others so we wo n't be disappointed when things go wrong . 
  lowered expectations are the key to a life full of happiness !, 
  i feel pretty comfortable with myself , thanks for asking, 
  according to ops username he has propably first hand information on this topic . 
  * fascisticinating ftfy !, 
  `` vienna is overrated , visit istanbul ! '', 
  < -- promotional `` visit turkey , the nation that founded , butchered and is refounding a multi cultural society '' < -- self critical, 
  rekt, 
  * temporary independence  jk , give peynir , kom\u015fu, 
  hands down, 
  the plot for `` taken 3 '' thickens ... 
  did these countries ascend to the boot licking phase in their eu relationships ? 
  this whole `` friends do n't spy on friends '' mambo jambo became not authentic . 
  it will make it harder to criticize other nations for spying . 
  the real problem for german politicians is that their hypocrisy is now obvious . 
  i was n't aware that there is a famine/lack of food in ukraine , did i miss something ? 
  read : http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/17k93l/could_someone_please_explain_the_armenian/ / r/askhistorians is a subreddit not partaking in the armenian genocide cirklejerk, 
  no , i said that not all facts are considered and the discussion is one sided , like : `` hurrrrrrrr armo genocide !!, 
  as i said , here we go again ... educate yourself on this subjects , than we can have a conversation , or you stay on your propaganda infested stand . 
  truth is such a big word ... cyprus : turkey responded to a coup de etat on the island seeking union with greece . 
  the whole armenian thing : it 's a fact that armenians in the ottoman empire started revolting/terrorizing turks and other people when the empire was fighting in ww1 . 
  it 's these `` little '' facts that people ignore when they speak about turkey . 
  the truth , my friend , lies in the middle east , and everyone who thinks he has found it should think again ... 
  here we go again, 
   roma-nia ftfy !, 
  so half the continent produces cars and the other half is busy pumping gas ... 
  i fucking love this cheese ... 
  yup every news regarding turkey pretty quick turns into propaganda either pro or con , mostly con . 
  beatufil pictures !, 
  so many places to visit , so few time :(, 
  simit instead of baklava for turkey ? 
  well ... as a simit lover i 'm ok with this , 
  you propose we all should commit suicide so the terrorists ca n't kill us ? 
  oh the irony , we do n't want them because they will be less democratic in the future after a certain , democratically elected leader won the election . 
  except turkish people never saw themselves as victims ... 
  we love to hate you too !, 
  yeah , i too think that the balkans need more microstates god forbidden , you guys could be relevant ... 
  it 's propaganda when no neutral news agency is covering the incident . 
  tbh propaganda is much more entertaining than real news ... 
   and i am so disgusted of [ azerbaijani lies ] ( http://armenpress.am/eng/news/771375/azerbaijan-tries-to-console-itself-by-inventing-imaginary-armenian-casualties.html ) i 'm sure armenpress.am is s totally neutral source for news ... 
  bottom left :  the canary islands ... are included within finesterre, 
   the mediterranean union would really , really suck . 
  unending streams of immigrants from north africa and the middle east , badly affected by climate change , overrun with crime and a broken economy without other regions to support it . 
  so practically nothing changes . 
  they used all their fun naming their volcanoes . 
  do some research , like / u/rabbitlion did . 
  his statement is 100 % correct , even op mentioned it in his 1st bullet point ... 
  ssssshhhhh ... europe choses to ignore this fact . 
  time to liberate the south ... again !, 
  never heard of that site before , but a good idea though, 
  and this is why nobody likes serbians, 
  til there is a jewish autonomus region ( oblast ) in russia edit : the kicker ?? 
  [ this is their flag !, 
  ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/j%c3%bcdische_autonome_oblast#mediaviewer/datei:flag_of_the_jewish_autonomous_oblast.svg ), 
  nope , dodged the bullet in two countries :p, 
  yeah lets build a new russia with blackjack and hookers !, 
  well my flair on virtually every subreddit is something like `` d\u00f6ner / kebap ... '' soooo ... and i 'm proud of beeing a kreiswichser !, 
  coming next on / r/polandball, 
  no , die partei is not a satire party , the fdp is . 
  it 's ok , the fn will be pro-european when it comes to cash in subsidies, 
  it 's hard being turkish in a hostile environment , but this just doubles the fun imho, 
  dude , this is the butthurt coaliton protesting . 
  maybe the alevis are the only turkish people in this crowd but the rest are chronically anti-turkish protestors, 
  to be honest there are many ~ ~ traitors ~ ~ people there who protest turkey and not just this dickhead in charge of the country ,, 
   a ** terrorist ** party that wants ... ftfy !, 
  - seperatist kurds . 
  check - armenians . 
  check - syrians . 
  check this is not an anti-erdogan protest , this is an anti-turkish protest . 
  i wonder why no one from the npd or afd showed up , they must have missed the memo ... 
  naaaah , i 'll be hungover from the cl finale . 
  i 'm so glad this election is very simple ( 1 vote + 1 local referendum ) . 
  do you get paid for beeing an official ? 
  we get ~ 50 euro and if you 're some kind of public servant ( like me ) you 'll get an day off from work . 
  yep , sounds much better and neutral . 
  i 'll hit the election office at 13:00 and stay there till the end :( or  do n't know yet ... 
  `` campaign worker '' ... sounds more like i would work for a certain party . 
  i did already ... and on sunday i 'm going to be a campaign worker ( is this the right word ? ), 
  is n't it ? 
  sorry , i did n't knew the 3rd ww was going to be quit . 
  afaik russian is an accepted language in bavaria , you can use it to substitute english . 
  there were some russians around when i was studying , we had to take english classes and those guys just took a class in their mother tongue ... 
  no news coverage in germany , that 's the first time i see something like a pro-russia demo here, 
  oh god , not that shit again ... 
  wyh should we fight for ukraine ? 
  there seems to be a north to south decline in usage , i guess the sun is the natural enemy of the internet :d, 
  go gerdi , it 's your birthday !, 
  take this , ttip !, 
  my thirst thought : `` sweet , a new guns 'n roses album ! '', 
  i should probably go to sleep now ... 
  polan stronk !, 
  my turkish identity : lobsterish red , drunk but very fun people my german identity : penalties are not that hard ... 
  definitely german !,
