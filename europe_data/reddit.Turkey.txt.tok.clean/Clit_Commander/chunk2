  you need a word for a new thing ? 
  just combine some existing words till it describes what you have !, 
  invented a new flying thingy ? 
  flugzeug it is !, 
  how do you call a place for a break at the highway ? 
  what to call the captain of the steamboat cruising the danube ? 
  beautiful !, 
  sure i am . 
  nonono , this thread is about romanians not bulgars, 
  yes , you ca n't live the pacifistic dream when people in your neighborhood start making trouble . 
  the european nations relied for too long on beeing protected by the usa just to cash in the peace dividend ... 
  yep , it seems like a natural thing to connect the power grids and create a energy union . 
  should be totally the next big project the eu starts, 
  funny , the romanian girl on my floor must be the ugliest woman i know , but she is a true bro ( to everyone ) and i do n't want to miss her . 
  welcome to the annual reddit cirklejerk , enjoy your karma because you 're not getting more than this . 
  so you demand nothing in return for an apology ? 
  tell this your statemen and the others in your country and i 'm sure we can get this working ... 
   once again , you just hear what you want to hear well i just quoted ** your ** demands ... 
  when did the current turkish government  ruthlessly slaughtering women and children you 're mixing up time lines , stay focused . 
  soon, 
  making utopian demands will take you nowhere . 
  noone in his right mind will give up territory . 
  but i guess that 's how the game is played in armenia , was very effective the last century ... 
   restore some armenian lands including mount ararat and that 's why nobody ( in turkey ) cares to talk with armenians , you have to respect the borders first and stop talking about `` western armenia '' when you mean central turkey ... 
  seriously , you made territorial claims in your 3rd sentence ... 
  like we use to say in germany `` gleiche scheisse , andere packung '' ( same shit , different packaging ) . 
   looking forward to the diy pipe bombs that land outside my window this time every year . 
  go claim something else ... d\u00f6ner is turkish and not german ... 
  hehe ... this will look funny when people start licking them ... 
  shuttings up monaco !, 
  `` red with a white cross ? '', 
  `` yep , here we go ! '', 
  their cars are still shit ... 
  jewish sources do n't count too !, 
  when i was an intern at siemens everybody ( aka the management ) wanted a paper free office , the staff countered this effort coining the term `` wir sind vom papierlosen b\u00fcro genauso weit entfernt wie vom papierlosen klo '' ** `` we are as far away from the paper free office as we are from the paper free toilet '' ** i think they were right , 
  i confused the words decade and century, 
  i confused the words decade and century :(, 
  yes we can , but changing our energy systems will take ~ ~ centuries ~ ~ decades and we ca n't survive without russian gas for 2 weeks tops . 
  imagine a winter without heating ... i mean a `` true '' winter not the bullshit from this year . 
  do n't know how it was in other countries but the german winter was very mild and warm and dry . 
  edit : 100 years are much longer than 10 years ... 
  i confused the words decade and century, 
  the title is a little misleading , this party was always against turkey to join the eu . 
  ironically a coalition including the csu started the eu - turkey cooperation ... 
  dude ... 
  it started in poland , the western nations were n't in a hurry to help poland though, 
  you missed a chance to shut up , would 've been wiser ... 
  pass the popcorn mate !, 
  just like you deserved the nato bombings ... edit : is n't it ironic ... 
  `` gandhi is a cheeky cunt '' - every civilization player ever, 
   the only way to stop the escalation and a potential war is by taking into consideration russian concerns about nato/eu east expansion and the destabilization of the ukraine . 
  i wish that would be possible but poland and the baltic countries will never accept this , they escaped the russian influence recently and will avoid everything to be again part of a `` soviet union '', 
  true , but as i was writing / u/new-atlantis [ posted ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/20jiba/crimean_crisis_post_referendum_diplomacy/ ) this in his thread :  a ) military escalation is out of the question . 
  russia is still a formidable nuclear power with a full deterrent . 
   b ) economic sanctions can only be symbolic because substantial sanctions will cripple europe just as much as russia . 
  moreover , russians are more used to belt tightening out of a sense of patriotism than pampered western europeans , who are in no mood for more suffering after 5 years of crisis . 
  we are talking about something that will not happen because european citizens will not tolerate a cut in their lifestyle for some foreign people far away . 
  edit : imho russia wins , people need to learn that you do n't play chess against russians ... 
  i do n't think that germany will do anything , the german economy needs russian gas badly and ca n't switch to other energy sources quickly . 
  oh i totally forgot the terrifying romanian and bulgarian navies !, 
  wishful thinking ... 
  i do n't think that russia will be impressed by some us warships , they will never give up the crimea and people should cope with it . 
  the referendum today is as legit as the kosovo referendum ( it is n't ) , but the western countries were pushing eastwards and the russians would 've made them stop sooner or later . 
  of course it is when you are as far away from the ( possible ) war as france is ... 
  first step of the war , we ruin their economy . 
  i 'm pretty sure that this will only bear good things !, 
  they would just have to move their troops from nagorni-karabach ( i do n't know what the region is called in english ), 
  the cool guys send faxes in this modern times !, 
  yeah you 're right , but a little fun every now and then is ok ... it 's not like this is / r/adviceanimal here ... 
   all men aged 15-60 were issued a pack of standard 0.5 l bottled beer best.invasion.ever, 
  why ? 
  op posted something silly , and the others are dicking around ... looks appropriate to me ... or are you secretly a humorless german !?!, 
  dude ... the boston bombing was done by them ... nevr forget !, 
  looks like he was hungary for slovakia the whole time !, 
  perfect !, 
  count me in !, 
  people in cities live in cities !, 
  upvote for your flair , 
  welcome to the reality ... i hope you got some cool new tanks or aircrafts in exchange for your shitty roads !, 
  sooo ... i think i missed the point of this vid ... 
  the race to the bottom accelerates even more ... 
   while in turkey they happen together exactly , we are way ahead of you !, 
  i do n't like this guy but compared with some/many eu countries he looks pretty normal . 
  the most ironic thing was when former german foreign minister westerwell criticized the gezi protest while at the exact same time an occupy camp in frankfurt was raided by the police . 
  right now he gets the shit because of the internet censorship but the uk do something very similar ... 
  skeptical ... must be the understatement of the year ... 
  why would someone with oil wanted to join the eu ? 
  while we are at the topic of romania , what happened to this whole stray dogs mumbo jambo ? 
  skynet is getting assembled . 
  there is no accounting for taste ... 
  the difference between those two individuals is that one of them was killed in custody , it 's the unsolved scandal that makes me furious . 
  i 'm not much of a philanthropist , i do n't really care about life or death of people i do n't know . 
  but if someone unable to move , manages to burn himself without anybody coming for help is something you would expect from a 3rd would country ... 
  good riddance ... 
  go on and fork it , too bad the name of the protocol would n't be as cool as tyyp : / /, 
  my bad , edited, 
  polandball joke turkey is kebap and serbia is the kebap removal service . 
  it 's a silly place , you should n't get there , 
  oi , the kebap is here to stay !, 
  for the last time , there is no skilled labor shortage in germany , there is skilled ** cheap ** labor shortage !,
