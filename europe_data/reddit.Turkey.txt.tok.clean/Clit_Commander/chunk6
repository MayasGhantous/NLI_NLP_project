  lets find the millionaire on / r/europe !, 
  yeah that 's bullshit , not even my older collegues call it a klammeraffe anymore . 
  an evil minded person would say so , yes , 
  there are quite a lot unknown places on this map . . 
  the german narrative goes like this : if it is good/popular , it 's german ( d\u00f6ner , mesut \u00f6zil ) otherwise it 's turkish and should be extradited, 
  comfort yourself with the idea that there are billions of people out there who do n't know your area in the first place so they could n't even forget it !, 
  grilled halloumi/hellim is the best thing since grilled meat . 
  and i do n't mean a cheese sandwich dear murricans, 
  i expected the comments to be more circlejerky , i stand corrected, 
  dang , i forgot to buy popcorn ... 
  ssshhh ... that does n't fit into the western narrative of the evil turk . 
  guy has balls , that 's for sure, 
  we love to hate each other , it 's good to have similarities !, 
  like you and the danish ... 
   ... and prince is sculptured with his hand allegedly pointing to ~ ~ constantinople ~ ~ istanbul , showing the turks to leave . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republic_square_%28belgrade%29#prince_michael_monument thats hilariously balcanic !, 
  did we just became best friends !???!? 
  the comment went on a roller coaster ride when the thread was more active . 
  the turkish flag is a red flag to some people here ... 
  i never said i feel uncomfortable here . 
  i am part of this society but do n't feel like a german , and besides why should i leave the country i was born into ? 
  culture and of course religion , it really seperates people and i think if turkish people were christians they would n't experience racism very much, 
  very interesting , never thought of this before . 
  i speak both languages equally ( vocubularywise ) but my turkish pronounciation is shitty and i tend to use only german even when only turks are around , because at some point i know i 'll have to use german/english words and this mixed languages/dialogeus just sounds awful to me . 
  uh well i tried to identify as a german , but integration is a two way street and the german society was n't ready to accept foreigners as germans . 
  edit : when the rest of the society tells you everyday that you 're not german even when you correct their grammar while doing it you just go `` fuck you , i do n't want to be in this exclusive club anymore '', 
  please again in french, 
  turkish . 
  edit : downvotes for feeling turkish ? 
  you 'll get you chance on the next forum , 
  here you go : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3b3q9r/israeli_diplomat_in_berlin_maintaining_german/csj4f5b, 
  born and grown up in germany i propably know as much as everyone else about the holocaust . 
  reperations were justified and surely had a good intention but somewhere in history the israeli community started milking guilt ridden germany . 
  for myself i * know * that during the holocaust horrible things happened , but i * feel * nothing . 
  could be because i do n't feel like i 'm german and because not even my father was born when those things happened . 
  gib fregatten and u-boots !, 
  what kind of camouflage type would turkey on this map be ?? 
  what is going on in ireland and how can i get involved ? 
  this comics are to free speech what `` dude its a prank for youtube ! '', 
  videos are to comedy , dont wonder when you get stabbed in the process, 
  this is trolling and not advocating free speech, 
  exactly , . 
  greece was always in the upper hand . 
  and now their situation is even better because all the debt is in public hand now, 
  i guess there will be no coalition at all , my bet is on a reelection with the akp hoping to push out hdp . 
  care to express your personal opinion on this case ? 
  i do n't think there was a case in history where people went to war over oil/gas, 
  the guy who made the map switched the numbers by accident : http://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/38wmet/most_common_foreign_citizenship_in_each_german/crygtgq, 
  your welcome , have fun watching the emperors new groove reenactment ( without all the funny parts ), 
  hey ... let them have it along with the verkehrss\u00fcnder kartei . 
  i might be partially the reason for it, 
  i live in germany so that would not cause much trouble . 
  ` ttomans !, 
  * liberated, 
  deal , you 've got an pm edit : bro do you chicken out here !?? 
  butthurt is the main export of the balkans . 
  nah they were not really thinking about attacking turkey ( i guess ) , but they made sure to go bankrupt with their military spendings . 
  562 years of butthurt sure leaves marks on the soul . 
  well , tbh the preparations for this event are one of the reason why the greek are in such huge debt now . 
  so , no this would n't solve the problem . 
  maybe not selling them over priced weapons would be a better way ... 
  yeah man that 's just like your opinion, 
  fuck yeah i would too because fatih akin is a damn good director . 
  implying there are many people who want to watch it . 
  we came for a visit and they sent their polish bouncers after us . 
  who need kebap when you can have potato amirite !?!, 
  it says `` bestonia '' , is this where the moops live ? 
  lets consider this as a running gag . 
  what will change or happen after everybody including turkey recognizes it ? 
  who the shit cares what foreign people call an 100yr old incident that happened thousands of km 's away . 
  my opinion on this : `` it '' happened , no doubt in this . 
  but i do n't see the point in backwards punishing and finger pointing . 
  after all the term genocide was coined decades after ww1 . 
  there goes the peace dividend . 
  apologizing is free , reparations are not . 
  just ask our fellow armenians how much of turkey they want to recreate `` western armenia '' ... 
  yay !, 
  another easter !, 
  i demand more free days !, 
  farming is the best !, 
  my grandfathers were farmers and they had to do actual work twice a year , the rest is chilling and doing other stuff , of course they were not rich ... let me break down german holidays to you ( and why working in germany is so awesome ) : - you 've got at least ( depends where you live ) 9 and a maximum of 13 legal holidays - on top opf that you get at least 24 days for cavation , most people have 30 though . 
  - pupils get 2 weeks off for christmas , 2 weeks for easter , 2 weeks for pentecost , 6 weeks for summer and 1 for autumn/winter . 
  most people use their vacation in school holidays so that 's the reason why i ca n't work now because many collegues are vacationing and basically we run in emergency mode . 
  cigarettes will kill you dude !, 
  think of your health !, 
  quit smoking now ( if you smoke ) . 
  i 'm wasting my time at work with no actual work to do because it 's easter holidays in germany , it gets a little stressy drinking coffee with the other guys :d, 
  he could change his name to `` i 'll be everyones bitch '' and if would n't change anything in the relations to armenia , you guys will only be happy if you get `` western armenia '' back ( without the pesty turks living there ) . 
  so , how 's your day going ? 
  i wish you a nice weekend !, 
  i hope you gon na credit me , indonesia !, 
  i 'm going to start a ladder company in turkey , the chances were never better !, 
  oh shit ... half the complexity he described was a test i did studying , it 's a mess programming such things . 
  its called b\u00f6rek , your welcome dear balkans, 
  sandra bullock was born in germany . 
  dieter zetsche , ceo of mercedes , was born in turkey . 
  they like it so much they want to own it,
