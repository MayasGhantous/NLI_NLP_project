  #bavarianbeermasterrace !, 
  then stop making delicious hefeweizen !, 
  putin is kill , they are preparing for the riots/festivities/revolution, 
  itt : how dare you being turkish !?!!? 
  i 'm too drunk for this shit ... 
  i like deppendorf most ( moron village ), 
  imho it was n't a real apology , it was more like `` i apologize buuuuuut i was misquoted blablabla '' people should be extra careful when writing about sensible issues and a professor should know that she represents her university . 
  this thread is epic ... 
  say `` please '', 
  error 404 - godlessness not found, 
  i was so fucking glad that i did n't had to attend ( christian ) religion classes ( in germany ) being a muslimic heathen i had ethics instead , which was imho really chill and interesting . 
  it is to me since like ... ever ? 
  i liked lordii though ... 
  i hope that someday this show will become irrelevant when serious artists will have no chance because bearded women , handicapped people or transsexual artists ( or the next iteration of freak ) get all the `` guilt '' points for being brave or whatever . 
  yes she did , but i think she was n't the firste woman to win this event ... and please stop being disrespectful to demons !, 
  i like that this whole eurovison bullshit is becoming more and more a freak show ... 
  better not to spend lent money on prestige projects and simultaneously fighting off the troika . 
  lend me moneyz , i want to donate it to bih ! '', 
  i do n't know how long we have to go back in history to see this happening , but afaik current day austria is what is left of the habsburg territories . 
  austria is full of bavarians ? 
  topkek, 
  no wonder vw wants a time out , they do n't have the money right now to put in e-cars . 
  the last time i saw someone sell weapons to both parties was at star trek tng , it was the ferengis . 
  no , thanks . 
  and risk getting the prototype damaged ? 
  [ in my hometown ] ( http://www.yelp.de/biz/sahverdi-schnellimbiss-n%c3%bcrnberg ) , but there will be many people thinking differently on this issue . 
  yeah cause hitlers birthday is still an important date ... 
  for germany : moser-roth , store brand from aldi . 
  it 's quite good , not spectacular but absolutely ok . their `` alpen milch '' and `` knusperflakes '' are yummy, 
  @op : you 're really milking the holiday facts you learned . . 
  in hindsight i should 've chosen another word ... 
  11 dead , many more injured , i fear that this count is not terminal . 
  agenda account , he is `` this '' guy by choice . 
  frankly , it is n't that hard , the only difference between him and the eu is the will to do it . 
  such is life in russia, 
  still much cheaper than having them in europe ... 
  you see tovarish , in soviet turkey when glorious president disagrees with constitution then the constitution is wrong . 
  i stand with my therory that his colon cancer treatment fucked him up really bad, 
   albania yes  macedonia yes  montenegro yes  serbia yes  turkey ( eu candidates ) no to erdogans turkey yes to a western oriented-secular turkey ( so pretty much a no for the next 30 years )  bosnia yes  kosovo ( potential candidates ) yes  georgia no  moldova no , maybe after the conflict in transnistria is solved . 
   ukraine no , maybe after the conflict in crimea and eastern ukraine is solved . 
  -- tl ; dr : yes to the balkans , no to the rest , especially when there are conflicts with neighbouring countries . 
   except turkey . 
  that 's funny as hell , while i agree that erdogans turkey should n't be allowed in the eu , it also shows the hypocrisy towards turkey : `` you can be as good or even better than the other candidates but go fuck yourself '', 
  [ do you even meme ? 
  ] ( http://urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=trolling+is+a+art ) https://franzejr.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/trolling-is-a-art.jpg http://new2.fjcdn.com/large/pictures/a0/5b/a05b98_1440930.jpg, 
  trolling is a art . 
   attacking the pentagon was n't terror , but attacking the wtc was . 
  let this one sink in , and when you 're done i 'll tell you who said it, 
  i love the reaction of the folks over there at / r/kurdistan : https://np.reddit.com/r/kurdistan/comments/469wu7/at_least_five_killed_in_car_bomb_attack_in/, 
  [ video source ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwclq2u7_w4 ), 
  i 'm cool with it when i get an explanation . 
  thanks for your service ... oida, 
  alright , i 'm submitting the article, 
  which one of the `` community rules & guidelines '' did i violate exactly ? 
  or is it the usual bullshitting done in this sub ? 
  yeah but we can smell the vodka anyway ... 
  i swear this asshat will go full pol-pot someday ... 
  i pee red and white !!, 
  maybe i should go see a doctor ... 
  and here i am in germany , thinking if the pen and cup i got from our consultant qualifies as a bribe . 
  someone should buy the weapons from the peshmerga and return them to germany for later use . 
  a g3 costs apparently 1450-1800 us$ , thats more expensive than i thought ... 
  metal as fuck, 
  no he did n't . 
  like / u/justretardedthings said on / r/turkey ( https://www.reddit.com/r/turkey/comments/3z0fcn/turkeys_president_erdogan_cites_hitlers_germany/cyi8x9g )  he first mentions hitler 's germany under `` unitarian presidency '' then mentions us under `` party presidency . '', 
  he didnt say `` effective goverment '' at all . 
  and here i 'm sitting in the rains down in germany ... 
  and every time our replacement teacher did n't feel like teaching ...
