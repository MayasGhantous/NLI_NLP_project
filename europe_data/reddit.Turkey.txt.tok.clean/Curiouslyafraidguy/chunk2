  making homosexuality illegal or barring women from voting or having an independent legal status from her husband , was probably enforced to prevent the society to turn into exactly what it is today .

  i 'm not sure the earlier philosophers of the enlightenment actually set the base of the things that are prevalent in 2017 european society . 
  especially the views towards lgbt , women 's rights and racial equality . 
  also biblical teachings spoke against killing and greed , but fell on deaf ears . 
  yeah i was wondering about the reason behind it . 
  i 'm pretty sure vietnam would look like a pillow fight compared to somme or stalingrad , which both did n't really trigger social changes despite their extreme brutality . 
  a lot of wwi/wwii veterans even confessed that they would do it again if their country was in danger . 
  i did n't say it does n't have older roots , but it picked up the pace in a very short time . 
  the theory behind the airplane wing also dates back to at least early 1800s , but a real functional airplane was developed in a very short period , that 's what i 'm saying . 
  3 finnish ladies were offended when i thought they were german . 
  i mean come on , i did n't mistake them for ugandans , why the long face ? 
  did you visit zimbabwe or something instead of turkey ? 
  i 'm not sure since it 's an independent nation . 
  similarity is like probably austria and germany, 
  according to [ ea ] ( http://www.futhead.com/16/career-mode/players/?bin_platform=ps ) , there is n't , at least not the last season . 
  is there a black in top 10 active footballers ? 
  i think immediately available ( battleworthy ) nuke arsenal of us surpasses those of russia . 
  [ there you go . 
  ] ( https://m.reddit.com/r/propagandaposters/comments/4psl8b/our_mother_europe_vichy_postcard_1942/?ref=search_posts ), 
  it wo n't be . 
  i wish we went through the cultural and societal change the europe did , from rushing to trenches facing machine gun and artillery fire than biting the face of an another young man then slitting his throat with your bayonet because he was born across the river to peace , prosperity , welfare , irreligiousness , hipsters , educated populace in less than four decades ( 40s to 80s ) . 
  but we did not , instead we still struggle with the mentality of circa 1914 . 
  and people who still struggle with the mentality of 6th century ad ( basically most of sunni syrians ) are rushing into our country by millions , i hope we can find a common ground with them and agree on that 13th century was great and we should live like that . 
  considering the ethnic makeup of the said regions today , it 's exactly what happened , unless native peoples decided to colonize mars because they were offended that normans and saxons just assumed their gender . 
  i mean come on , if peace movement , multiculturalism etc existed in 8th century ad , why not space travel ? 
  if it was n't for `` low religion '' , we 'd be a developed country dammit, 
  a lot of countries , such as iran , china , turkey , mexico , libya , kazakhstan also have high hdi . 
  i 'm not sure about the reliability of that measuring method, 
  what about ukraine and russia ? 
  well i was surprised when i saw that xavi and sergio ramos did n't speak a word of english , juan mata does though . 
  and what do you think will happen to bullfighting in the future ? 
  will it be banned ? 
  they did n't migrate . 
  they conquered and either decimated or enslaved the native population , and their soldiers landed , not immigrants . 
  if moroccoan army invaded netherlands tomorrow , killed as many dutch they could , then placed their own people , it would be maybe a similar situation . 
  geez , that 's why we call medieval period `` dark ages '' . 
  the world war ii and nazism ended just a lifetime ago , and memories of soviet empire are still fresh , barely 25 years has passed , do you really believe that people were all for equality , peaceful co-existing , progressivism etc. 
  goddamn a thousand years ago ? 
  last time i answered here , i was roasted by a danish gentleman for not being a european , but i 'm still going to answer anyway , to shed some insight , knowledge is n't bad . 
  the great world war i is taught in a positive , patriotic manner here . 
  `` we were good guys and evil imperialistic britain , france and russia wanted to partition and colonize our lands and kill our people , we fended them off heroically . '', 
  i know people are going to ask , the armenian genocide is n't taught , and majority of the population think it 's a hoax . 
  also european theater of war is n't taught a lot , most people do n't know about verdun or somme or tannenberg . 
  yes . 
  although it 's widely speculated to be suspended in less than a decade . 
  oh okay , i thought it was suspended in 2000 . 
  what was the age for it ? 
  35 + or 37 + seems more likely given the date, 
   plus everyone and their dog has been conscripted at some point so ... no . 
  did n't it end in italy like 15 years ago ? 
  yes , and i 'm pretty sure it 's much more than the us . 
  probably closer to early 20th century europe level . 
  edit : to clarify , most cult about military is shaped by two factions here : islamo-fascists ( akp ) and old school nationalists ( chp ) . 
  mhp is in between . 
  the ones that directly worship the military itself are the chp folks , they 're usually secular ones . 
  islamo-fascists usually have a cult of personality of erdo\u011fan rather than the military , military itself would n't be a big deal for them without erdo\u011fan and neo-ottomanism . 
  maybe difference is like ss and wehrmacht but i 'm not sure if it 's similar . 
  some of the syrians are `` fairer '' looking too . 
  but i suppose turkey is the fairest muslim country after albania . 
  1 . nobody can differentiate most people 's nationalities by looks if you mean that , unless they 've their passports strapped to their foreheads . 
  2 . it would be true in terms of countries and states , but ethnically , linguistically , culturally and religiously germans and french are two distant people . 
  of course you can mistake a german for a serbian , a russian for an englishman or whatever based solely on looks , but saying `` russians and english are practically the same , both are christians with fairskin '' would be a dumb thing to say . 
  however it 's okay to say `` turks and arabs are practically the same , both are muslims with brown skin ( not me or nobody in my family does look different from a `` white '' but whatever , let 's say we are unusual ) , because of eurocentric world view which led to slapdash generalizations of non-europeans especially by british and french colonial rulers , creating artificial countries in africa and middle east that 's problems still affecting today . 
  blame the middle east problems on yanks ( but i blame it on sykes and picot , but they 're europeans too , seriously how am i supposed to tell apart a white dude that goes to church and speaks a european language from an actual european , right ? 
  yeah . 
  they are called \u00e7omars here . 
  they probably make up to around 60 % of the population , but 40 % is no small percentage . 
  so what ? 
  you are slavs . 
  just like poles are slavs , russians are slavs etc. . . 
  most ? 
  more like all . 
  even natives used the ice land bridge in bering 10.000 bc to cross from asia to north america . 
  southeast is not ethnically turkish except the state employees who are stationed in there . 
  not trying to turn this into a `` we 're good others are the problem '' circlejerk , just stating a fact . 
  \u0130stanbul has both iraq-like and europe like parts , \u0130zmir is good but used to be much better when i was a kid in 90s . 
  a saudi arabian can understand a palestinian , a turk can not understand both to begin with . 
  both the alphabet and language . 
  chinese man ca n't differentiate a frenchman and german by looks , but he 'll surely know they 're different people after learning about their nationalities . 
  also slovenians and russians essentially descended from same people between 3rd and 6th centuries . 
  what about a redneck dude from alabama and a pubfighter from liverpool ? 
  both are english ethnicity , anglican protestants and lived in the same country unt alabaman dude 's ancestors decided to move out of uk in 1600s ( much more recent than any last turk-arab cultural interaction ) , so you would surely consider them same ? 
  hopefully we i wo n't see the days where we 're seriously compared with afghanistan ... 
  the similarity comes more from religion and less from language and mutual history ( in the case of slavs ) though . 
  i do n't deny that there are similarities , but some people think we 're identical or something . 
  we 're not more similar than a frenchman to a german really . 
  and most of these brown loud hairy dudes here are kurds , gypsies and arabic refugees instead of ethnic turks . 
  it seems like after world war ii , europe had undergone a massive cultural and societal change in a very massive scale that rest of the world did n't . 
  ( sure , usa did too , but not really as much as pronounced as europe , and this is r/askeurope ) , and considering this , do your world views/political views/way of life etc. 
  differ considerably than those of your parents , grandparents , great grandparents ?
