islamic fasting is no food or water from sunrise to sunset , for one month . 
  this year it was 16 hours per day . 
  this sounds very unhealthy , especially the no water part . 
  source : i live in a muslim country . 
  ( modern ? ), 
  catholic ( or was it protestant ) fasting is very simple . 
  you decide not to eat some things ( the example i was told was french fries ) and you keep it during the fasting period . 
  source : a german girl ( greek ? ), 
  orthodox fasting is the best in my opinion . 
  there are various levels with meat being forbidden and you choose if you eat diary products and eggs . 
  strict fasting means no oil too . 
  but some seafood is allowed , like octapus and mushels . 
  there is a 49 day fasting and you also fast two days per week .

  does your wife have a beard ? 
  it was a real coup attempt that failed . 
  they do it all the time . 
  my guess is they didnt know that they were lying , but they really dont care . 
  they decided to vilify g\u00fclenists , discredit all opposition and praise erdo\u011fan with anything , true or not . 
  that was real too . 
  the germans/westerners are jealous of us and/or they hate us . 
  they dont want turkey to advance . 
  many turks seriously believe ( after politicians told them ) that the gezi protests in 2013 were organized by germany/lufthansa/claudia roth because of the third \u0130stanbul airport and/or the third bridge . 
  if you understand our mindset , you can easily explain everything . 
   it 's interesting how low support for israel though . 
  israel is not exactly in europe , i guess that 's the main reason . 
  i wish , but no . 
  one of the largest tv channels in turkey . 
  it is real .

  a member of the parliament with the nationalist party mhp said g\u00fclen is armenian [ source ] ( http://haberciniz.biz/sok-iddia-fethullah-gulen-ermeni-mi-1903171h.htm ) ^ ( in turkish ) the president of the organization osmanl\u0131 ocaklar\u0131 , a nationalist-islamist ` culture ' club aligned with erdo\u011fan 's akp said he is sure that g\u00fclen is armenian [ source ] ( http://m.mehmetciktv.com.tr/haber/18784/osmanli-ocaklari-gulen-ermenidir.html ) ^ ( in turkish ) an islamist newspaper close to erdo\u011fan said g\u00fclen 's mother is a spanish jew . 
  [ source ] ( http://m.yeniakit.com.tr/haber/rabin-oglu-fetullah-23161.html ) ^ ( in turkish ), 
  this is a joke in turkey too . 
  this map shows the three parts , turkish republic , \u0130slamic republic and kurdistan http://imgim.com/qwtvupz.jpg alternative map : \u0130ndependent aegean republic https://s.instela.com/m/bagimsiz-ege-projesi-bep--i573064.jpg, 
  this has nothing to do with greek orthodoxy , the photo of the booklet shows this site : https://www.ptl.org who are evangelicals , probably american . 
  translation : the west , especially the us , supported islamic/conservative organizations ( legal and illegal ) and parties , as a counterweight against the left . 
  an example is the [ 1980 coup ] ( http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/120404041841-kenan-evren-vertical-gallery.jpg ) , supported or organized by the us , which was the nail in the coffin of the turkish left . 
  that sounds wrong . 
  the physical money held by the banks is a very small percentage of its capital , and the majority gets recycled . 
  if you give them 100 quid , the will put it in the atm and someone will take it . 
  source ? 
  because the article doesnt deny g\u00fclen 's involvement , it quotes g\u00fclen . 
  what do you mean ? 
  there are no other generals . 
  the turkish army had a total of 358 , more than 157 were discharged . 
  http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/infographics-turkeys-coup-attempt-in-numbers.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=102228&amp;newscatid=341 ( numbers are higher now since more generals were discharge or arrested ) special forces ( sat komandosu ) were decimated , almost all are arrested or fugitive . 
  many aircrafts were bombed ( we dont know how many , but according to descriptions it might be a three digit number ), 
  more than 213 pilots were discharge or arrested . 
  that 's a very odd way to calculate it . 
  more than 157 out of 358 generals were suspended , most of them arrested . 
  that 's 44 % of the generals in the turkish army . 
  you included the conscripts to come to that number , this is kinda misleading . 
  for a visitor , it is as great as it was 5 years ago . 
  i find your comment out-of-place but you dont deserve so many downvotes . 
  accept a virtual brofist . 
  this is true and many of us fail to recognize it . 
  g\u00fclenists were much more educated than the average conservative muslim turk . 
  yes , thats a risk . 
  70000 educated , previously well connected , disenfranchised people are dangerous . 
  i hope that , after cleaning up the state apparatous , he will provide will be some sort of amnesty and try to take the majority of these people with his side . 
  not all of them are putschists , most are just conservative religious members of an islamic cult . 
  [ 20 year old girl ] ( https://eumostwanted.eu/irodotou-efi ) gets involved in an accident , abandonds the scene , victim dies . 
  she appears in court and gives false testimony and a fake driving license . 
  is this girl really among the 25 most wanted people in the eu ? 
  yes , many of them were reinstated . 
  some of them will be reinstated , some were not needed and there are some people already trained ( eg there are 10s of thousands of unemployed teachers ), 
  there was a state of emergency for decades in the kurdish parts of turkey . 
  many people had suffered under it . 
  he used to boast that he abolished it . 
  maybe thats why he hesitated , and he only decided so when he saw it was necessairy . 
  funny comment in / r/turkey : did we all become kurds now ? 
  i obviously agree , but state of emergency ( the type declared today ) is not that bad . 
  here are some changes : https://www.reddit.com/r/turkey/comments/4tt87r/so_state_of_emergency_for_3_months_what_does_that/d5k3a59 calling everyone a nazi and acting as if it is the end of the world does not help . 
  we have three different types of states of emergency . 
  in the one declared now , the police can search you but not your property without warrant . 
  the detention period can become indefinite , but this should be voted by the parliament . 
  im just parotting what lawyers say on tv . 
  these 50000 were not arrests , they were suspensions of public servants . 
  there were a couple thousand detentions and arrests . 
  wrong sub !, 
  dont despair . 
  apply for masters in a foreign university . 
  if you are still a student wait until you take your diploma , learn the language of the country you want to live . 
  things will not be much worse in one month than one month ago !, 
  and there is always northern cyprus and azerbaijan . 
  the pilot who shot the russian plame down was arrested yesterday y the way .

  erdo\u011fan did it years ago : https://youtube.com/watch?v=caa-uehkbde,

  i can . 
  http://t24.com.tr/haber/sirri-sureyya-onder-erdogan-arayip-kandilde-ne-oldu-diye-sormustu-mahkemelerde-konusacagim,341355 `` erdo\u011fan called [ the hdp comission sent to the headquarters of pkk ] and asked about the talks with the pkk '', 
  leading and making propaganda for a terrorist organization , taking part to illegal demonstrations , inciting the people to commit hate crimes , inviting the people to illegal demonstrations , inciting the people to not follow laws and more . 
  the party has two co-leaders , demirta\u015f ( blue suit/tie , middle ) and y\u00fcksekda\u011f ( white shirt , brown trousers , right ) . 
  y\u00fcksekda\u011f is in jail too , and her seat in the parliament was taken from her . 
  edit : the previous ad of hdp supporting the `` no '' in the upcoming referandum was banned . 
  they [ made a new one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4rsw7gewz4 ) with demirta\u015f , but since he is in jail they used a construction worker . 
  a license to operate a taxi in \u0130stanbul costs 400.000 euros . 
  not the car itself , just the right to operate one .
