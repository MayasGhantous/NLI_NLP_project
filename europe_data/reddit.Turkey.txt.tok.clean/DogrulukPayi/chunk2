  he will be president until 2019 . 
  if the new constitution passes , he can be 10 more years , until 2029 , and then there are legal way to stay longer . 
  if the new constitution does not pass , he can be elected for one more term , until 2024 . 
  now imagine living in turkey and having to listen to this shit 24/7 .

  well in true islam women are not allowed to drive , which will certainly make your roads safer . 
  when did this happen ? 
  every citizen is assigned a ballot , your id is checked off a list when you go , but your vote is secret . 
  each ballot has around 400 votes . 
  they provide an excuse , usually : 1 . unlawful assembly , 2 . propaganda is forbidden here , 3 . insulting the president , 4 . group connected to terrorists , 5 . inciting hatred and hostility among the people, 
   even if `` no '' vote will pass ( if the results will be not faked ) , he probably will take a second referendum , jailing whoever had voted no in the previous one .

  they mean `` give the meat for free '' . 
   do normal people not see the danger ? 
  of course . 
  btw , there was an amazing campaign by a secular newspaper 8 years ago using the motto `` are you aware of the danger '' must watch : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mviswvkir7g https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfyds20yoo,
