  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/berkin_elvan if it was pkk or tak : erdo\u011fan is the main responsible for breaking up peace talks . 
  please find a girlfriend, 
  and `` bac\u0131lar '' means older women, 
  you are a known akp troll in / r/turkey , i will not comment on what you said . 
  government media alteady does : source in turkish : https://np.reddit.com/r/turkey/comments/5ldjfx/yeni_akit_sald\u00f6r\u00f6y\u00f6_f\u00f6t\u00f6_yapt\u00f6/ ? 
  they were secular muslims, 
  ummet = ummah , means `` the nation for islam '',

  foreign schools have a long history in turkey ( since the ottoman empire ) and they are some of the top educational institutions in the country . 
  the german highschool was founded in 1868 , the french galatasaray highschool in 1481 ( french since the mid 1800 's ) and the american bosphorus university in 1863 . 
  do we have a non turkish source with the apology ? 
  turkey switched from +2 to +3 this year ( or permanent summer time if you wish ) . 
  it is dark at 8 am when schools open , people complain that they are more tired and accidents have risen . 
  his advisor really said that . 
  i was replying to the post above me . 
  he asked `` who will erdo\u011fan blame for this ? 
  place your bets '', 
  yes . 
  not just erdo\u011fan . 
  a large part of the turks thinks that the west is trying to keep us weak and to divide us . 
  they think that you are scared of us and hold us a grudge because turks reached vienna . 
  i was replying to the post above `` who will erdo\u011fan blame ? '', 
  seriously : the west . 
  pkk , g\u00fclen , some opposition , some media and some businessmen are used by the west to keep turkey weak . 
  there is a rumour among religious/crazy turks , that pkk members are armenians or crypto-christians . 
  warning , it 's a blown up body . 
  edit : there is a media blackout , the turkish press still doesnt mention any deaths . 
  the turkish vice president said that women should not laugh in public . 
  according to \u0130slamic morals women should be silent in public . 
  it says so in the article . 
  they are trying to fix it . 
   this has happened in a society that traditionally was strongly patriarchal , where polygamy was common , honor killings accepted and girls not allowed to sit at the same table as their fathers . 
  pregnant women were not allowed in public , and women were admonished not to be seen laughing . 
  i like the debate , but i would like it more if your tone was friendly . 
  let 's take care of our sub and foster a more respectful discussion culture . 
  \\* touches his dreadlocks \\*, 
  you can find more leaflets [ here ] ( http://www.psywarrior.com/germanwwipsyop.html ) with details about psychological warfare during wwi . 
  this is an [ x-post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/turkey/comments/5h2lkp/turkish_propaganda_leaflet_during_gallipoli/ ) from / r/turkey , original poster is / u/youthanasian . 
  that 's the same in most ( all ? ), 
  countries . 
  kinda late , the rebels in aleppo started withdrawing/surrendering yesterday . 
  none of the traditional media can get into details . 
  opposition media just reported the leak . 
  some sites ( leftist * diken * , communist * sol * and ~ ~ kurdish ~ ~ terrorist * bir g\u00fcn * ) report in detail . 
  in one of the leaked phonecalls between erdo\u011fan 's daughter and erdo\u011fan 's advisor , they call them `` trolls '' . 
  that 's how this word entered in turkish . 
  leaked call in turkish : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhcaoorxht4, 
  at least 5 years ' worth of emails . 
  he was a ceo of important corporations and is now a government minister , some say he is the shadow prime minister . 
  most emails are fwd 'd from his associates and his wife . 
  you seem very down-to-earth , you must be a capricorn . 
  context : there are gold coins in various sizes minted by the government . 
  the market is free , anyone is allowed to buy or sell gold coins tax-free , you can find gold-trading shops in every corner . 
  when the prices are low , people queue to buy . 
  turks ` invest ' a lot in gold , a remnant of past high inflation . 
  it 's a tradition to give gold coins as birth/wedding presents or to team up with neighbours and friends to buy a gold coin . 
  i can vouch that all information regarding the content of the emails are true . 
  ( basically the * powertrans ' oil monopoly * part and the paragraph before . ), 
  some members of redhack ( who released albayrak 's mails a few months back ) sit in jail . 
  one of them ( ta\u015fk\u0131n yasak ) was release but he disappeared 4 days ago and his family is looking for him . 
  ignoring common law , what does this mean ? 
  what are some differences between napoleonic and austrogerman law ? 
  any examples ? 
  it 's not really a story . 
  it 's what americans call ` omnibus bill ' , germans ` artikelgesetz ' and turks ` torba yasas\u0131 ' . 
  instead of voting one law for each matter , they pass one law with unrelated subjects . 
  sometimes it makes sense , but in turkey such laws are passed too often . 
  he is an advisor of erdo\u011fan , but a really crazy guy . 
  dont ake him seriously . 
  he said that foreigners are trying to kill erdo\u011fan with telekinesis . 
  i think he was joking . 
  i hope so . 
  otherwise i have to take out my military uniform again . 
  my mum keeps it in a box , together with my baby clothes . 
  many countries have perpetrated genocide in the past , some more recent and much larger than the armenian genocide . 
  today turkey is being criticized because she still hasnt recognized nor apologized for it . 
  the role of some kurdish clans in the armenian genocide is indisputable . 
  ** but the kurdish representatives/politicians/organizations have recognized it and apologized repeatedly . 
  ** one example : http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/armenian-genocide-kurdish-leaders-set-moral-example-turkey-by-facing-their-crimes-1498053 edit : [ another apology ] ( http://www.radikal.com.tr/politika/ahmet-turk-ezidi-suryani-ve-ermenilerden-ozur-diledi-1252968/ ) ^ ( in turkish ) from 2014 : this kurdish mayor apologizes to the armenians and the other christians ( yezidis and assyrians ) . 
  * `` today , we feel the suffering caused by the massacre which our own grandfathers and father committed . 
  we caused a lot suffering to our brotherly peoples . 
  and we will not let this be forgotten '' * he said . 
  this mayor was thrown in jail two weeks ago, 
  no it 's not , it 's a reaction to the constitutional courts annulement of the previous law . 
  and this new law changes many other laws ( from bankruptcy to terrorism ) . 
  [ full law ] ( http://www.resmigazete.gov.tr/eskiler/2016/12/20161202-1.htm ) only article 13 has to do with sexual abuse . 
  yes , fixed . 
  no , but if you add the gold reserves that hover around 20b ( currently 16b ) you come very close to that number . 
  [ full data set ] ( http://evds.tcmb.gov.tr/cgi-bin/famecgi?cgi=$ozetweb&amp;dil=uk&amp;araverigrup=bie_abres2.db ) ( choose both items , press ` report ' ), 
  gross includes the commercial banks ' required reserves , held by the central bank . 
  commercial banks are allowed to keep a part of their cash reserves in foreign currency . 
  hehe . 
  last week he inaugurated a road junction . 
  he literally appears 1-3 times per day and talks for 30-60 minutes . 
  broadcasted live on most tv channels . 
  some data : the gross forex reserves have fallen by ~ 10 billion usd , from 106 billion to 96 billion in the last 3 weeks . 
  net reserves were 21 billion dollars at the end of october ( this figure is published once a month ) . 
  not really that high . 
  but the pm said ` net foreign reserve did not diminish by even a cent ' . 
  note : central bank reduced the required reserve ratio , which might explain the reduction of the reserves .
