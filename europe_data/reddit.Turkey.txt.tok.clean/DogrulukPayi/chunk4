  a haircut costs around 2 euros , a shave ~ 1 . 
  a three plate menu with drink costs around 4 euros . 
  you go to an exchange office , exchange your dollars and take the receipt . 
  then you show the receipt to the barber , waiter etc , and you dont pay . 
  these people are just naive patriots . 
  this is literally true . 
  you can see what hour : minute he says `` the interest rate needs to be reduced '' . 
  erdo\u011fan talks 1-3 times per day . 
  a large campaing going on since last week . 
  even some ` journalists ' close to the government started calling people who buy dollars ` traitors ' . 
  [ this sign ] ( https://i.redd.it/8zbut7gfs41y.jpg ) reads `` free haircut for everyone who brings a receipt of converting 300 dollars to lira '' . 
  or [ free food ] ( http://i.hizliresim.com/o0gl7m.jpg ) for 250 dollars . 
  edit for clarification : you exchange your dollars to lira in a bank . 
  you keep the lira and show the receipt to the barber . 
  as a `` thank you for doing our country a service '' , the barber cuts your hair for free . 
  dollar was under 2.90 six months ago , over 3.50 now . 
  they asked ~ 100 managers per country . 
  it is based on an ` executive survey ' , a poll among ~ 100 mainly ceos in every country . 
  not really ` survey of citizens ' .

  the dormitory belonged to another sect , the s\u00fcleymanc\u0131 's . 
  but akp loves them so nothing will happen . 
  does eu-citizenship exist ? 
  or are you a citizen of an eu-member country ? 
  why did you mention the ussr in the title ? 
  ( nvm , checked your post history ; you just dont like russians ) the main reason for the decline of the number of victims in the [ northern ireland peace process ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_ireland_peace_process ), 
  this was summer 2015 . 
  in summer 2016 ( when the agreement was in effect ) the flow was much much smaller . 
  it is easier to patrol the shore and the sea and take the refugees back . 
  the greek coastguard can and does patrol , but once they are in greek waters there is nothing they can do . 
  arrest them and they are still in the eu . 
  the main gateway are the islands . 
  they are very close to the turkish shores . 
  refugees buy a plastic boat and lifevest and cross the border . 
  hundreds of boats every day used to go to greece last summer . 
  look at these photos : https://www.google.com/search?q=greek+island+refugees&amp;tbm=isch even if the greek lifeguard caught them , there is nothing they can do , since turkey will not accept them back . 
  if they pass into eu , turkey will not accept them back . 
  you can not enforce border controls easily in the greek islands . 
  his exact words were `` look at me !, 
  if you go further , these gates will open . 
  know this ! '', 
  delete and repost before it 's too late !, 
  he used to accuse on a daily basis the central bank for raising the interest last year . 
  this time he seems softer . 
  he still warned the cb , but said he accepts its independence . 
  old news 2 . 
  it is not as bad as it sounds . 
  the new constitution proposal foresees a two-term limit , each term is 5 years , next elections in 2019 . 
  if erdogan wins the 2019 and 2024 elections , he will rule until 2029 . 
  the only undemocratic thing : he is now the president , which has a 2-term limit . 
  he is serving his first now , and will get 2 more , so practically a 3-term limit . 
  he is trying to prepare the public and turn a possible political hit from the vote into gain . 
  nothing to see here . 
  he does have twitter , but at the moment he loves trump . 
  trump supported him after the coup . 
  that 's a different kind of visa . 
  you pay like 15 euros on your arrival in the airport in turkey . 
  we need to apply to your consulate , wait a few weeks and submit like 20 documents , including a tax statement and our bankaccount details . 
  turkey : [ h\u00fcrriyet daily news ] ( http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/ ) -- mainstream , recently close to the government [ daily sabah ] ( http://www.dailysabah.com/ ) -- mainstream , belongs to the family of erdogan 's son-in-law [ yeni \u015eafak ] ( http://www.yenisafak.com/en/ ) -- very conservative , crazy , very supportive of the government [ anadolu ajans\u0131 ] ( http://aa.com.tr/en ) -- government owned [ trt world ] ( http://www.trtworld.com/ ) -- government owned ** [ bianet ] ( http://bianet.org/english ) ** -- alternative leftist , opposition , serious the english versions are much better and more objective than the turkish ones .

  it has only been withdrawn temporarily . 
  the general assembly would vote on it today , but the parliamentary committee will discuss again , might make changes and bring it to the assembly later . 
  i 'm copying my comment from the other post : https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5e9e7y/turkey_withdraws_child_rape_bill_bbc_news/, 
  yes , theodora1821 , i fixed it .

  things got funny when turkish nationalists beat up an uygur cook in a chinese restaurant , because they thought he was chinese . 
  it didnt pass because there were not enough mps present . 
  it caused an uproar and the pm himself did some small changes and now it will be voted again with the prime minister 's support this week . 
  i always thought it meant `` born early '', 
  it didnt pass because the opposition asked for an open vote , and there were not enough mps present . 
  all i remember from french is `` qui est a l'appareil '' and apparently it 's a phrase the french never use . 
  he got 52 % in 2014, 
  according to turkey . 
  according to the west , ypg is a legitimate force , supported by all western countries . 
  when g\u00fclenists [ uncovered some large corruption cases and started an investigation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_corruption_scandal_in_turkey ) , they were stamped as traitors , and the government started going after them . 
  this case led to the coup attempt in july ( im simplifying ) . 
  in turkey , if you talk about corruption you immediatelly become a traitor or a terrorist . 
  if you are an influential person or media , the government will diffame you and possibly arrest you . 
  now , according to this report , it is `` socially acceptable to report corruption '' . 
  if transparency international is so wrong about my country , i wont trust what they say about other countries . 
  there is no opposition inside mhp any more . 
  two of bahceli 's possible successors were ousted from the party ( meral ak\u015fener for being a `` terrorist '' and a few days ago \u00dcmit \u00d6zda\u011f for not supporting the presidential system ) . 
  hundreds if not thousands of less important party officials , local party officials , local party organizations etc have been fired/removed from the party . 
  google mhp ihra\u00e7 for names . 
  people who get married present themselves in the show . 
  next episode a candidate comes , they talk a little bit and if they agree they drink a tea off camera but on stage . 
  everything happens in one studio https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wi8-juq7g6q, 
  it often is different with each isp . 
  especially dns blocking comes a couple days later in some isps, 
  that doesnt make sense . 
  the party who you authorised to vote for you will go in the booth , you will stay home . 
  i agree , but in france `` you can designate someone ( which has the same station as you ) to vote for you '' , as / u/seszett previously [ said ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/671pja/current_queue_to_vote_at_the_french_embassy/dgn0aht/ ) , which is equally bad . 
   it has happened before and it could happen again the article says that the greek state ignored the church . 
  or maybe political and economical situation and culture . 
  one out of many arrested jailed detained etc journalists this week : https://cpj.org/blog/2017/04/turkey-crackdown-chronicle-week-of-april-16-2017.php every day journalists are arrested and media gets shut down . 
  there was an amnesty a few months back and 38000 + criminals were freed , to make room for opposition . 
  not a single mainstream tv channel or site reports on them . 
  i dont know , it is probably the [ shahada ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/shahada ) .
