  fine bro kardesim let me speak t\u00fcrk\u00e7e o zaman . 
  god damn it !, 
  speak only english !, 
  i dont care if you are a mod or not !, 
  this is an english subreddit !, 
  meh , erdogan sadly doesnt give a fuck about accessing to eu since he ( and pretty much whole turkey ) knows that we will never ever be admitted to eu . 
  never !, 
  nobody cares if luxembours is sanctioned or not . 
  they can not endure to sancture turkey especially after russia . 
  the hell ? 
  why dont you let turkish people vote ? 
  they are living there , they have the right to vote . 
  they dont have to support erdogan . 
  compare gdp 's not per capita . 
  what should we be aware of ? 
  why the hell would we have it in a country where the football is not the real football ? 
  yea , especially after russia they can not do anything . 
  they need to gulp it down . 
  indeed , erdogan is the uncool one there . 
  you are being unfair . 
  yea as always a power issue . 
  well then i hope island doesnt unite in peaceful terms . 
  turkey has nato bases too which basically means usa-uk-fr . 
  a base in cyprus would greatly enhance our influence in mediterranean . 
  cyprus ' strategical location forces it to be a hub for all great and regional powers . 
  if you guys tell us to shut down our bases yet say nothing to nato , uk , fr , israel bases then you are completely hypocrites and i hope island wouldnt unite under your terms . 
  if it unites we must be able to preserve our bases . 
  you lost that right when you started butchering your turkish citizens . 
  god , just stop . 
  cyprus is very close to turkey . 
  a base there may greatly help us however a base in pacific would be completely useless because we are not a world power and only thing we want is to defend . 
  showing the hypocrisy of those who want to unity cyprus . 
  their power is not enough to say anything to the big brother uk . 
  yes . 
  you see cyprus is a base for everyone . 
  uk has bases everywhere throughtout world . 
  we should at least have bases in cyprus and that should be accepted as one of the future treaties to be signed by turkey and cyprus . 
  and no that doesnt make us colonizer , just having an unsinkable aircraft carrier . 
  we should preserve our own interests while uniting the island . 
  you cant take without giving anything . 
  yep . 
  agree that its wrong to hold it . 
  we should maintain bases and give lands to cyprus . 
  we should never ever let go of bases until uk cedes 9 % of their lands in cyprus . 
  who guarantees isle will be all dandy wandy after we pull out ? 
  maybe you will declare einosis again and start butchering your fellow turkish neighbours ? 
  trust issues ... 
  oh how cute !, 
  all americans should go back to europe then since they have been only there for a few centuries  brain !, 
  use it !, 
  you know something else people dont ususally forget ? 
  yea ethnicity wasnt much thing back then . 
  religion was . 
  yea destruction of greeks in turkey was really sad . 
  relations with greece at the first few decades since our foundations were really good despite recent war . 
  istanbul lost its color without its greek community . 
  our government should act and offer citizenship and give property as gifts for their descendants not only greeks but armenians as well . 
  we could have been a better country with them . 
  i hope this happens in the future . 
  i really would like to see us bff with greece . 
  we have much in common we should end hostilities . 
  what you 've said makes no sense . 
  no the reason is religion and thats why i wish ottos had chosen christianity rather than islam . 
  if you really think roman empire gave its people only peace and prosperity you are definitely true s. / we are saying that they were good compared to the civs at that time not modern 21st century states . 
  you think all would be dandy in balkans if there werent any ottomans ? 
  whats happening today ? 
  * sigh * provocations on both sides . 
  why do people always want to see one side of the coin ? 
  yes devsirme is shocking ** when thought with 21st century mindset ** at that centruies it was better than seeing him killed . 
  yes christians paid heavier taxes but again they would live . 
  and as i said they let them do whatever they wanted in their private life , they wouldnt meddle with state affairs . 
  church conversion is a religious thing . 
  yea it sounds horrible now but it was like a monument of winning the battle and `` spreading faith '' christians destroyed mosques after their conquests anyway yet nobody mentions as always , who would have thought angel christian europeans would ever hurt anyone ? 
  they are merely fighting minions of satan liberating people along the way . 
  ( i am nontheist btw just so you know ) yea soldiers were allowed to loot the city . 
  wow so unique !, 
  s. / are you * seriously * comparing slavery in europe during colonialosm to ottomans ? 
  ottomans never had `` that '' kind of slavery . 
  people bought slaves as servants or even to marry them . 
  they did not work in fields with gruesome conditions . 
  soldiers were only allowed to loot the city for a certain amount of time . 
  after that everything they do would be considered as a crime . 
  i dislike late ottoman empire and hate some of their actions especially how they became pious after egypt 's conquest . 
  they could have forged an alliance with golden horde and mamluks since both were ethnically turkic ( mamluks were turk slaves brought to those lands and later rebelled ) but still they were a glorious empire to expand that much and live that long despite everything is not easy but they could have done some things much better . 
  well well havent you had enough time in reddit ? 
  `` remove kebab '' didnt come out of nothing . 
  it is a product of past . 
  oh and erdogan can go to hell . 
  at least closer than brazils , 
  on this day 562 years ago , constantinople was conquered . 
  werent much better ? 
  i love the hypocrisy in europeans . 
  whatever war happened in europe at that time were ( something hard to admit coming in ) ** as cruel as ** this one . 
  and at least ottos let their individuals do whatever religion they believed in/whatever they wanted to once the order was restored ( after all looting was done ) whereas in europe they were completely massacred if the enemy was catholic/protestant . 
  europe will never ever get past evil ottoman/turk circlejerk . 
  therefore europe and turkey will never be friendly in terms . 
  because they look us as barbarians/evil doers and say that we dont belong in here and if they could send us back they would . 
  fucking hypocrites , ignoring their past and blaming us for what happened centuries ago . 
  yea we are satan incarnation . 
  `` provocation '',
