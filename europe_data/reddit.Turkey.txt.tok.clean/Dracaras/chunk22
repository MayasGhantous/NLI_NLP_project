  even germans do not suffer as us . 
  thank you russia for being presented even more evil than us to europeans . 
  what about us ? 
  we have 2 million damn syrians !!, 
  so did every god damn empire, 
  we get downvoted to hell if we ever say the same thing about armenians . 
  double standarts ftw !!, 
  a post which blackens france 's history getting upvoted ? 
  impossible !!!, 
  if its bad then it must be about russia , turkey or china !, 
  because screw them all !, 
  how do you know him so well ? 
  it 's cute \u2764, 
  it is only haram if it is infestated haha , 
  he doesnt know what he is missing , 
  turkey : west : 30 % east : 2 %, 
  we need to make greeks accept that baklava is ours !, 
  the hell is wrong with your ministry of interior ? 
  she is responsible for everything that happens in the interior . 
  the hell happened to us ? 
  so they have been largely assimilated then ? 
  interesting . 
  why not ? 
  they even have their own dialect unique dialect . 
  yea i know but the seat and support they receive is very low . 
  they can be an ass and harden the process . 
  have they done that ? 
  also why is there no wales national party but scottish national party ? 
  why shouldnt they if they are in the embassy ? 
  they are not independent after all . 
  i am getting real sick of russia portrayed as mother of all evils . 
  they made great sacrifices in ww2 too . 
  they were a superpower and acted according to their interests i am not justifying that but come on no need to go back that much just look at what us of a did in recent past . 
  why are you so against independence ? 
  i think you should be free but thats just me lol . 
  irish struggled for their independence why havent you ? 
  english were friendlier to you ? 
  arent you afraid of being assimilated ? 
  because you are faaar more stronger and durable than us . 
  they are like a leech sucking our blood which we dont have much . 
  yes we are a poor country ( \u00b4 \uff65 _ \uff65 ` ), 
  why do some scots not want an independence ? 
  they would have north scotland oils . 
  somewhere between dislike and hate they are unreliable and ungrateful . 
  ( and much other i dont wan na type here ), 
  there was a deal with turkey and europe where we would try to prevent illegal immigrtion and they would ease the visas . 
  we are slowing down but i dont think europe will keep its promise . 
  we should have let those immigrants pass or they will bring our doom . 
  2 million syrians is no joke . 
  it is horrible . 
  europe needs to man up and take them !, 
  armenian genocide is a lie  ^ ^ ^ ^ probably ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ only ^ ^ ^ ^ case ^ ^ ^ ^ where ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ will ^ ^ ^ ^ get ^ ^ ^ ^ upvote ^ ^ ^ ^ for ^ ^ ^ ^ saying ^ ^ ^ ^ this ^ ^ ^ ^ on ^ ^ ^ ^ / r/europe, 
  this is such a shame . 
  though it is at least better than the jesus mosaic painting ... 
  let me tell you a story friend . 
  istanbul was the culture capital in 2012 before that the head of whoever decides this organisation which is a female comes to visit istanbul . 
  she also meets with the head of universities student council 's in istanbul and decides to go for a dinner with them . 
  before going to the restaurant they walk in istiklal avenue and then while walking she removes a headscarf from her pursue and asks `` when should i wear this ? 
  i have been told that ( her advisors ) if i dont wear it i will be beaten horribly '' university represents look back at her speechless and terrified . 
  can you believe this ? 
  i wouldnt believe if this was not coming from a trustable source . 
  i would tell that she was lying but no this was real . 
  this is how west looks to us . 
  what it was and will be unfortunately . 
  have you ever watched a documentary about istanbul by national geographic . 
  its like they deliberately collected shots from turkish women in turban ( the stupid cloth which covers nearly all of your body ) i am sick of how west represents us and how they see us . 
  they will never accept us and if they had a chance to magically make us disappear they would . 
  wish our ancestors had accepted christianity instead of curse called islam . 
  we would be appreciated then . 
  aww thank you . 
  but unfortunately most europeans consuder us demi arabs . 
  you are right about us moving away from secularism because of asshole erdogan but still europeans always had and will have prejudice against us . 
  it is sad but true . 
  you may not have that ( which i am very glad ) but still majority does :(, 
  because not many people click here . 
  just 22 upvote . 
  4/22 is a high ratio . 
  plus turkish people upvoting him . 
  it is undeniable that / r/europe is biased agains us . 
  for example you can see [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/turkey/comments/34rd53/you_guys_dont_get_enough_praise/ ), 
  welcome to / r/europe where people support everything against us and would call us evil at the first chance they have . 
  lmao . 
  hadnt realised . 
  wtf ? 
  it is religious . 
  i am sick of disgusting backwards mentality . 
  these kind of people is what pulls us back . 
  good . 
  it is disgusting . 
  wish we could remove it as well . 
  lmao !, 
  are you seriously comparing this ? 
  it is well known that ottomans followed a policy of tolerance and didnt meddled with their subjects personal life, 
  i am talking about pre french revolution . 
  turkish soap operas sells more than a terrorist attack ? 
  it 's raining men !, 
  nobody is blaming anyone . 
  but i an showing that what we have suffere is faaar worser than what those `` poor '' armenians suffered . 
  and i am sick of this west 's hypocrisy . 
  they are like `` do something !,
