  i dare you ! '', 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/persecution_of_ottoman_muslims what you kill 6 million ? 
  at least we will be hotter in tracidents whatever that is lol, 
  well well if you say that ethnic cleansing and genocide are the same then why dont you change circassian ethnic cleansing to circassian genocide ? 
   or call the colonizers actions as genocide ? 
  you cant because `` power '', 
  good for you ( seriously ) felt like our battle of sakarya , 
  please why 'd russian genocide them ? 
  they were actibg as a big bro for the orthodox faith . 
  they have a fair share of genocides in their history . 
  armenians were not really autonomous , they were allowed to the whatever they wanted as a policy of tolerance in ottomans . 
  it was an irony dumbass . 
  we dont deny the massacres , deportations we only challenge the word genocide and prefer ethnical cleansing . 
  yea a handful few left on drugs by your gov. 
  good job . 
  yes and whole kardashian family . 
  you are welcome . 
  what about muslims ? 
  i am faithless . 
  i dislike religions but i kinda hate islam . 
  for me it is one of the worst thing happened to our civilization . 
  i 'd be much happier if we had converted to christianity . 
  anyway some people may have been brainwashed and we need to show them the other side of the coin . 
  who cares ? 
  nope . 
  i am on rak\u0131, 
  some people can be bought . 
  some people can be bought . 
  nope . 
  we are sending the worst there . 
  have fun , 
  i know cartagena but what is kkk ? 
  who cares iceland ? 
  so how are your relations with turkey ? 
  eh you might want to add greeks declared einosis and started massacreing their turkish neighbours . 
  if these hadnt happened cyprus might not be divided . 
  but we helped you during your famine . 
  things cool down after a while . 
  on the azeri side however there is an ongoing conflict so wounds always stay fresh . 
  nope nope, 
  difference between gobernmemt and people . 
  it probably was when they accepted it . 
  yea but they are really weird and we are weak . 
  also they are ultra conservative they cant do anythong there but can in here . 
  i do want reconciliation with armenians as well but such thing is impossible with their attitude . 
  and you dont think armenians are westerners ? 
  `` armenians are just as western as turkish people . '', 
  may i ask why did you say that ? 
  i am just wondering . 
  russia should go on look at its circassian ethnic cleansing ( see how i used ethnic cleansing instead of genocide ? ), 
  and solve it before meddling with others businesses . 
  they are only doing it for political purposes anyway . 
  i was talking about the great fire of smyrna . 
  wow . 
  north cyprus analyzed as a country ? 
  awesome !, 
  and its better than south cyprus !, 
  double awesome !, 
  plus the unregistered ones and its unfortunately well over 2 million . 
  they cause a lot of problems . 
  we are not powerful enough to look after them . 
  powerful countries should man up and lift our weight . 
  brits and french killed eachother because they were believing to the wrong sects of christianity . 
  whereas ottoman did not care what their subjects believed in as long as they paid their tax . 
  you can take ** as ** ** much ** ** as ** ** you ** ** like ** from our selection of 2 million refugees . 
  yes this is true . 
  nobody talks about the atrocities committed against us unfortunately :(, 
  yes ofc he will launch an attack they were soldiers after all . 
  he foresees and warns that irregulars may take revenge on greeks , that doesnt mean he orders or wants it he even warns them to be cautious and that he can not fully control them . 
  before the great fire priests preached how they should burn the city to the ground rather than turks take it . 
  they said that it was god 's will and so they burned . 
  why would we burn a very valuable important city whose infrastructure was nearly completely demolished after the war ? 
  we were already a very poor nation . 
  greeks were on the run anyway and even their armies followed a scorched earth policy during their retreat . 
  it is amusing how westerners can calumniate their actions to us . 
  he even openly warned his soldiers that murdering innocent people will be punished by death . 
  anyone can edit wikipedia its kinda bullshit . 
  they just exaggerate what happens to westerners and downscale to what happens to us . 
  true they wanted war but they were skeptical about it . 
  those 2 ships have a much deeper history . 
  here read if you want . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pursuit_of_goeben_and_breslau they were only ottoman on the outside but all its crew was german disguised as ottomans and they took their orders from the germans . 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/2y4f08/carson_city_council_rejects_ataturk_monument/ they were glad that monument was not erected and there was a much bigger post where they passionately argued atat\u00fcrk was guilty but i can not find it now . 
  no we could but west only looks funny when they pursue us to accept it yet they disregard theirs . 
  me neither . 
  i guess it comes from the hatress against turkish and turkish state so they hate our national hero too . 
  there is no such thing as armenian holocaust . 
  you may only call it as armenian genocide . 
  there is only `` the '' holocaust which refers jewish genocide . 
  learn the terms m8 , 
  yea . 
  why surprised ? 
  maybe someday we will be able to make you look at our perspective and see how we suffered as well . 
  that is the problem . 
  germans literally dragges us into war . 
  this attack was orchestrated bt germans under ottoman flag to forcibly put them into war . 
  we hope the truth somehow prevails . 
  nope according to / r/armenia ataturk is responsible for genocide as well . 
  what ?!, 
  they declared war to us in balkans .
