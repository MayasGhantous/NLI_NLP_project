  since there was no intent to mass murder them it can not be called genocide . 
  genocide convention specifically defines the holocaust as genocide . 
  even your land of freedom america accepted this convention 40 years later but with the `` genocide '' of natives not accepted as one . 
  do tell me then . 
  why is this called ethic cleansing but ours is genocide ? 
  as i said powerful nations alter the history . 
  but its not the same . 
  there was a huge religion barrier between us . 
  if you had miracously switched to islam then relations would be like russia and belarus :d but if we were christians and mix with greeks . 
  what would happen ? 
  would we lose our identity as a turk ? 
  weird history lol . 
  and sorry to say : / but bulgarian culture got influenced by ottomans . 
  i say there were no intent . 
  only irregulars and a weak weak empire . 
  then i want all balkan countries to recognize turkish genocide as well in return , 
  yeaaa lol haaha me too . 
  if at the beginning seljuk turks , even before ottomams somehow converted to christianity then what ? 
  would we be the ones to assimilate into greeks ? 
  even still there could be some kind of united greece and it 'd be quite powerful . 
  locking down both straits and the aegean sea . 
  wow megali idea does feel good at least for greeks lol . 
  well fuck everyone genocided eachother then . 
  all balkan countries should pay us reperations for killing turks . 
  but its always about armenians . 
  ** always **, 
  well hindi or indonesian languages have many speakers as well but they are kinda useless : / countries make a language worth it or not . 
  surely there must be turkic gene in asian people . 
  and some genes must be more dominant in italians/greeks/bulgarians etc. 
  modern day turkish and greek people 's genes undoubtly must be similar than say turkish-african or greek-african . 
  but still all human genes are mostly similar . 
  yea . 
  so do they lose european status after they switched from christianity ? 
  so a lot of people are becoming non-believers are they not european as well ? 
  i wish ... 
  state ruling , archieve handling . 
  stuff like these . 
  lol those people have been living there before we arrived . 
  thank you man  you are liked here , 
  around 1 million *, 
  true and if we were to make a gene test some of us probably wont even have that turkic gene but we all call ourselves turkish . 
  calling them muslim greeks instead of greeks is just laughable . 
  haha sure . 
  send them in !, 
  i wish what would happen if ottos switched to christianity after istanbul 's conquest . 
  wow !, 
  that one is like a plague !, 
  its everywhere !, 
  from china to balkans !, 
  dead . 
  or living in an extremely poor country by the sea . 
  intent is the most important thing . 
  ottomans wanted to ethnically cleanse them not mass murder them . 
  that turkey would stand still if wr had lost against armenians . 
  and plus we wouldnt even have kurdish problem because those lands would be under armenia 's control . 
  yea well the reason is not so many turks were left after your independence anyway . 
  and even your government still refuses west thracian turks to call them as `` turk '' instead they use muslim greeks . 
  christianity makes sense . 
  but then what about albania , bosnia and ksosovo ? 
  yea ottomans took roman 's principles unfortunately not their religion . 
  ask reddit . 
  we deserve `` whatever happens to us '', 
  [ yeah ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_tripolitsa ) [ suuure ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/navarino_massacre ), 
  we only challenge the word genocide . 
  we accept massacres and such . 
  genocide definitely defines the holocaust . 
  what se see here is far away from what nazis did . 
  but we are the opposite of whatever ottomans were . 
  and ottoman empire was deeply influenced by byzantine . 
  if our religion was christianity then we would even be the continuation of them . 
  appearantly you havent had enough time on reddit . 
  yes because they are ** never ** mentioned . 
  never !, 
  idk . 
  my grandfathers father was persecuted from bulgaria after balkan wars . 
  so maybe i have some european blood . 
  who knows maybe there is a bit of armenian too or greek ? 
  and lets not forget hittits , ionians , asurs and oh surely there must be some sort of turkic blood as well . 
  lol, 
  lmao turkey could due without his eastern side and still can . 
  nobody cares about eastern turkey . 
  what matters is the western turkey . 
  we wouldnt be here if we lost against greeks , we would be if we had lost against armenians . 
  because russia acted as a `` defender of the orthodox faith '' ( still does , huh ? ), 
  general population was expelled from asia minor however due to ottoman 's little strength they were merely protected and raped and murdered and looted by turkish and kurdish irregulars . 
  why not ? 
  europe * still * hates us and wants us gone from the map . 
  lol is the only answer i can give to that . 
  appearsntly ottoman screwed europe soo much that the hatress still continues . 
  the birth of turkish republic is tied to this `` genocide '' ? 
  til !, 
  and they lost and now its called `` genocide '' it wouldnt be if they had won . 
  it is weird because you are the one on the `` always right , saint '' side . 
  i guess winners do write history . 
  really ? 
  nearly nobody looks germans bad today . 
  yet when it comes to turks its always evil , bad , satan incarnation . 
  see ? 
  this was what i am talking about . 
  you guys are hilarious !,
