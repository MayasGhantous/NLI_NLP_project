  hypocrites ... 
  armenians sided with russians before those events . 
  nothing is black and white . 
  everyone at some time conquered europe . 
  yet nobody holds a grudge except when it comes to us . 
  how about us ? 
  because it is typical west hypocrisy . 
  it is always how west how christians suffered . 
  nobody mentions how we suffered . 
  nobody knows [ this ] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/persecution_of_ottoman_muslims where we suffered faar and faaar more than armenians but it is ** always ** overlooked and whenever it is mentioned , it is ** always ** mentioned as how we deserved it . 
  aww dont be so hard on your language :( our language is pretty much useless too : /, 
  do you even know me ? 
  lol . 
  i just wanted to point out that he wasnt also loved by his fellow armenians . 
  dont think that armenian diaspora even protected the guy . 
  he also heavily criticized armenians saying that they could actually do something for their countries instead of never ending crying about genocide . 
  at least you are much much more powerful compared to us . 
  opposite for us unfortunately :(, 
  `` yeah sure '' you know we are one of the first to let women vite and be elected ? 
  hmm cool thanks for clearance , 
  then take us in !, 
  stronger together , right ? 
  you are welcome  they are super power after all . 
  they have a way of controlling and manipulating . 
  they also control a lot of other strategic positions throughout the world . 
  here is the complete list . 
  one of the most important one is gibraltar which they grabbed while spain was weak and now they wont give it back . 
  i think they somehow disregarded treaty of kars . 
  it was signed by newly born armenian and turkish states . 
  however russians invaded armenia just a day later and declared treaty null and void . 
  i dont know how is modern day armenia 's stance about this . 
  but considering that they are pawn of russia ... sooo, 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=akrotiri_and_dhekelia&amp;mobileaction=toggle_view_desktop they control 9 % of the island . 
  silly guy , 
  there was always slavery, 
  there was slavery which was way better than westerners . 
  nobody denies slavery in ottoman empire all i say is westerners did it much worse . 
  lol hypocrite europeans . 
  armenians massacred turks as well were they had the chance . 
  also they sided with russians and actively helped them . 
  plus ottoman empire was failing everywhere he couldnt control anything . 
  it did i am not denying but it was better than empires at that time . 
  got it ? 
  i am sick of repeating stuff . 
  apologize for colonizing america . 
  so we should dump like 75 % of reddit ? 
  lmao . 
  care to elaborate ? 
  because they are turks . 
  `` they had it coming '', 
  god !, 
  compare it with the states at their time !!!, 
  ita better than dieing !, 
  no we were far better than `` any imperial power '' we let them do whatever they wanted as long as they paid tax . 
  lmao what ? 
  people immigrate over time . 
  go ask britain to apologise for their bloody colonisation . 
  lmao . 
  this was how things worked back in centuries ago . 
  it wouldnt have changed if any empire else had conquered . 
  in fact ottomans at least let his subjects live however they wanted while other empires at that time massacred the people with heaten belief . 
  yea but its still terrible . 
  lol i dont know it has a special thing i guess . 
  they say that italy offered to give them to us but ismet inonu pm of the time rejected the offer . 
  god knows what they wanted in return . 
  but still everyone looks it as a missed chance and wants it back . 
  no they are not . 
  ethnically cleansing is exiling a group of people to somewhere else . 
  genocide is the true definition of what nazis did . 
  using every kind of manpower to systemetically kill a group of people in any way . 
  and i guess our nationalists ' dream is to retake western thrace and dodacanese and islands which are ridiculuously close to us . 
  wish we could put that effort to cooperation . 
  turkey only challenges the word genocide despite what reddit thinks . 
  it presents the events as some ethnic cleansing . 
  i think one of their promises was to retake istanbul ? 
  lol . 
  turkey is not denying massacres as well . 
  i dont see any country recognising it . 
  recognition of [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/persecution_of_ottoman_muslims ), 
  take us in plox we have baklava < 3, 
  and let them die there ? 
  seems logical ... 
  not them but balkans , western nations . 
  how about the atrocities comitted to us ? 
  ok i am leaving you alone, 
  yea yea we came to the top of cycle i guess, 
  hmm no, 
  yea nothing happened . 
  i hope 2 sides unite some day . 
  edit : including the british controlled region which seems to be even harder . 
  what is this supposed to mean ? 
  lol, 
  lol, 
  yea but its fun, 
  so i just looked through your comments ... 
  aha , losing ourcreativity , eh ? 
  do you have a book where you have written all these words ? 
  or are you just randomly making on your mind ? 
  dont you ever sleeep ? 
  where do you live loser ?
