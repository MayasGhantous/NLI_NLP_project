considering the flak we get in / r/europe , `` remove kebab '' and constantinople comments are the least of our worries . 
  actually such comments can be humorous . 
  i 'm ok with most comments as long as people do n't act like i 'm erdo\u011fan or satan or a genocidal barbarian or something . 
  they were muslims for starters . 
  and they were considered to be more of a middle eastern country . 
  got you to say `` not even a good troll '' so i guess it was good enough . 
  we are in / r/europe so i wo n't waste my time with comments like this . 
  kurds in turkey are even more religious and conservative than turks . 
  western propaganda tries to play them up as some kind of secularist master race . 
  do n't fall for it . 
  it 's true but i do n't see the purpose behind making brochures about it and sending them to houses . 
   then go to one of his rallies and try this thing out . 
  it probably feels amazing . 
  and he loved big brother . 
  senpai just called turkey yuropean !, 
  yay !, 
  wait ... 
   our own governments supported erdogan before ~ ~ we realized he was a douche ~ ~ he stopped being useful . 
  his douchebaggery was plain for all to see , especially the governments of european countries who collect intelligence about this type of stuff . 
  western governments are always in favor of islamist middle eastern rulers , democratic or anti-democratic , because they make for better puppets than secularists . 
  g\u00fclenists are still a politically islamist cult that should be eradicated together with akp . 
  g\u00fclenists had it easy when they had erdo\u011fan watching their back , now they are getting a taste of the medicine they have been delivering to secularists for years . 
  comments at the bottom almost made me hate humanity . 
  why are greeks on reddit this aggressive and rude then ? 
  go remove that heart and sabotage the turkish flag then lol it 's not me drawing that shit . 
  i find it cringy myself . 
  i do n't think anyone except nationalist retards on youtube comments are still pissed about 1453 . 
  i also have a problem with the turkish government . 
  invite s\u00fcmeyye erdo\u011fan to your court and seduce her . 
  or invite bilal erdo\u011fan to your court and matrilineally marry your daughter to him . 
  he might pass his imbecile trait down the line though . 
  tbh i never seen any turks hating on greece in reddit . 
  i did see greeks do it though . 
  it is kinda cringy to see turks and how much they like greece while greeks never showing the same feelings towards turks though . 
  like watching a goofy kid trying too hard to get the girl :d maybe we are too busy hating arabs we do n't have any time for greeks . 
  what 's the reality ? 
  that greeks/turks wake up every morning thinking `` dayum , what a fine day do remove kebab/gyro '' ? 
  vote with your wallet . 
  because we wo n't be able to vote at all if this keeps up . 
  ey dey havent disapper we just hid them for now and we will giv them back soon nothing to w\u00f6rry about, 
  there is fucking toxicity regarding all countries . 
  it 's the internet . 
  we do n't have to hug each other . 
  gets me pissed off too but just got ta roll with it . 
   because of `` unfair competition '' ca n't even get capitalism done right fucking retards . 
  why not just say `` non-white '' or something ? 
   if they vote no , erdogan 's cabinet simply ceases to exist no . 
  things will just continue as usual under erdo\u011fan . 
  i used to carry a bottle of water and tissues whenever i went to a restroom in germany . 
  unspoken culture shocks . 
  we are fighting against a greater threat than the people who live in christian states . 
  that 's why things are more strict . 
  in the end it did n't help us in turkey though . 
  it was a war . 
  of course atrocities happened , from both sides . 
  but atat\u00fcrk was n't ruling the country then . 
  wow you guys really think jizya still applies ? 
  what kind of a retarded education system you went through ? 
  even americans are n't this bad . 
  i mean i saw people thinking most of turkey is a desert and we ride camels , and that was just dumb , but this is just beyond retarded . 
  yes for turkey . 
   f * ck you are so kind to censor that bad word . 
  nah , he just knows his audience and he is doing domestic propaganda . 
  [ here is a more realistic scenerio ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3yytmx8.png ) not seen in this map : galactic colonies ^ ^ ^ nvm ^ ^ ^ my ^ ^ ^ flair, 
  `` these are some weird speakers ... whateves , here bro lem me work yours a bit '', 
   a land where education has been a priority for generations . 
  you mean brainwashing ? 
  cock ~ ~ roach ~ ~ sounds . 
  ^ ^ high-quality ^ ^ humor ^ ^ for ^ ^ mature ^ ^ people, 
  someone says `` the woman fucking died ! '', 
  at some point in the vid lol . 
  weird shit happens . 
  happened in turkey = probably not the onion . 
  happened somewhere else = probably the onion . 
  what can russia even do in french elections ? 
  le pen is a putin puppet no doubt , but russia is n't going to win her any elections . 
  we do n't exactly feel welcome anyway . 
  edit : ps . 
  i 'm an anti-erdo\u011fan atheist turk , though being a `` turk '' is probably enough to turn people off . 
  if anti-islam and far-right parties get elected in europe it would boost erdo\u011fan 's votes . 
  so yeah he 'd love to see that happen . 
  he 'll definitely rig the referendum . 
  nah he 'll just force reelections and pass the changes without a referendum, 
   but i do n't understand how erdogan has so much support when his referendum is literally `` give me personal property of the country '' . 
  why does big brother in * nineteen eighty-four * has popular support ? 
  some things happening in here are just not comprehensible by westerners . 
  you ca n't understand a concept if it 's too alien to you . 
  we hardly comprehend them as citizens of turkey living in turkey right now . 
  their attitude actually stems from an inferiority complex . 
   are turkish people really this blind ? 
  yes they are . 
  state propaganda and brainwashing . 
  you guys are so afraid of a couple of million refugees that you ca n't stand up to a wannabe sultan ? 
  oh you must love democracy so much and hate military dictatorships if you want to jail people for things like that . 
  the irony here is staggering i 'm amazed that you do n't see it . 
  in turkey you ca n't insult islam or erdo\u011fan and then expect no consequences . 
  even in / r/turkey there was a couple of comments defending this but they were heavily downvoted thankfully . 
  it 's sad really . 
  my compatriots do n't believe in free speech yet i 'm stuck with them . 
  who is going to downvote that on / r/europe ?
