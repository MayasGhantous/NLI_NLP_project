  also everyone in the balkans have a diverse trigger system too from what i have seen . 
   i guess i misinterpreted what you said to mean women would be triggered by the suggestion they wear the hijab and i got confused . 
  but yeah , suggesting they 're `` forced '' to wear it is a legitimate trigger , so long as people are free wear what they like . 
  when i said `` you have to wear that veil thing whenever you are outside in turkey '' it was based on a real event . 
  a friend of mine ( who wears no burka niqab t\u00fcrban hijab or whatever ... maybe bandana sometimes lol ) went to germany one time and someone literally asked `` you are forced to wear a hijab in turkey are n't you ? '', 
  while she was drinking beer in a bar . 
  she said she was like `` wtf '' when she heard that . 
  i should have been clearer . 
  although yes women who wear it are also triggered at the suggestion that they are forced to wear it ( even though they are even if they ca n't admit it , but that 's another story ) . 
  yeah just added that a few minutes ago . 
  my god we have such a diverse trigger system . 
  genocide only triggers me if it 's brought up in a whataboutist way . 
  a lot of turkish women wear hijab . 
  we call hijab `` t\u00fcrban '' by the way . 
  to clear misunderstandings , here are some t\u00fcrban photos so we know what we are talking about [ 1 ] ( https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.pembeoje.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2015%2f03%2ft%c3%bcrban-modelleri-1024x1024.jpg&amp;f=1 ) [ 2 ] ( http://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/736x/88/67/c3/8867c3341bc2b95e7e6ed4f405fd75d9.jpg ) . 
  but wearing t\u00fcrban is not a requirement or enforced by any kind of law . 
  if you want me to give you a percentage ... 
  i really do n't know . 
  in one city maybe 80 % of women wear it , in another city around 20 % does . 
  that black ninja outfit though ( still ca n't remember its ' name , covers the face and basically every cm of skin ) is very , very rare . 
  it 's usually arab tourists wearing that thing . 
  we like to live dangerously . 
  it should trigger anyone who is a rational human being . 
  relevant good news : the well-known turkish actor \u015eevket \u00c7oruh , who is in the cast of a turkish tv series `` arka sokaklar '' which is being shown in the same tv channel , has tweeted [ `` i 'm saying ` no ' too , fire me as well '' ] ( https://twitter.com/sevketcoruh_/status/830482347397091328 ) also the anchorman later said `` courage is contagious '' i think this was his point . 
  so things are not soul-crushingly depressing . 
  it 's just mildly depressing . 
  at least it basically turned into world 's most unique election campaign , no ? 
  now we all just need to get fired from our jobs and yes voters will maybe rethink ... or probably not . 
  haha , exactly !, 
  good one !, 
  ^ ^ ^ ... motherfucker ... 
  finland ? 
  you mean mongolia ? 
  yeah [ google said the same thing ] ( http://neredenegezilir.blogspot.com.tr/2014/12/karapnar-colu.html ) , apparently we have a desert !, 
  now people can double-troll us if one of us denies turkey having deserts by showing evidence that it exists . 
  i do n't know , people seem to have wildly different opinions about it . 
  as a turk i do n't agree with that but i can see why some would . 
  if by partly you mean thrace then yes i agree . 
   how to irritate ** europeans ** with one sentence -  has turkey on the map this will irritate enough people by itself lol . 
  anyway , there are a lot of things that can trigger turks . 
  the suggestion that arabs = turks is a good one . 
  most turks look down upon arabs and do n't like being associated with them . 
  other quality trolling questions : `` i bet you ca n't drink alcohol in turkey '' , ( if victim is female + not wearing a headscarf ) `` you must feel so free here in europe , you have to wear that headscarf thing whenever you are outside in turkey '' suggesting that a turkish food is actually not a turkish food but is a greek/bulgarian/serbian / whatever food will also draw angry comments . 
  after a bit of shitstorm someone rational will point out that these countries shared common history under ottoman empire so similarities in culinary are to be expected , this answer satisfies the turks but tends to trigger greeks/bulgarians/serbians / whatevers this time . 
  suggesting that turks still ride camels and most of turkey is desert is a good trolling method . 
  i 've seen people believing the latter a lot so if anyone is wondering , no , there are no deserts in turkey . 
  making overused jokes and memes such as `` turkey !, 
  dae thanksgiving ! '', 
  and `` it 's nobody 's business but the turks '' and `` turkish prison '' may force a facepalm but nothing major . 
  edit : i forgot the best one , the word constantinople does n't trigger turks but when foreigners say it by expecting to trigger us , it just annoys us that you think we are that simple . 
  we have more complex things to get angry about , like food , or someone claiming anatolia is rightful armenian/kurdish/greek clay or something . 
  edit2 : bringing up armenian genocide in online discussion to score an automatic debate win . 
  `` yeah but you committed a genocide '' * upvoted through the stratosphere * edit3 : if you make a `` is it safe to visit turkey ? '', 
  thread in / r/turkey , they will rape your karma . 
  edit4 : [ this is how my national pride looked like after going through my inbox ] ( http://i.on5yirmi5.com/image/2012/02/17/247365.jpg ) . 
  turkey stronk and relevant im not triggered there is something in my eye : ' c, 
  i like how this comment and the other turkish-flaired comment is different ( but same ) . 
  migration happened at least we all agree on that lol . 
  you people here left me with no more jokes to make . 
  `` european '' is a racial concept now ? 
  heh , apparently now this sub is all sensible and shit , are you playing some kinda game on us / r/europe ? 
  look at it this way : he did n't make the usual comment about turkey not being in europe . 
  yes , more so than central asia ancestry . 
  slavic , greek , armenian ancestry is more common . 
  that moment when you are all like `` 1453 best day of my life '' but you are actually a crypto-armenian-greek . 
  so crypto even you do n't know . 
  hungary and turkey , common ancestry is apparent from the names , we complete not only each other but also other people 's shitty overused unfunny jokes . 
  half of that bridge is in asia , not europe !, 
  the shit mods of / r/europe are allowing these days ... like , i 'm looking at the photo and trying hard to not see the asian half , but the fucking thing is just right there , how can i not see it . 
  absolutely scandalous . 
  it 's enjoyable to make fun of those comments at least . 
  actually like 90 % of turkey is in asia . 
  this photo is from a bridge that ties europe to asia , which , in my opinion , has its ' place in / r/europe , especially considering all the mexico-philia and trump news !, 
  this sub has gotten lately . 
  if you really feel the need to regulate this sub , go forth with your mighty keyboard report those threads . 
  ruin people 's fun , make mexicans run for their lives , crush fat trumpets with loud spacebar strikes . 
  afterwards you can start reducing the size of europe 's borders or something . 
  / u/candagltr !, 
  our greek friend is unsatisfied with your post !, 
  photoshop out the asian side of this bridge at once and leave only the european side , so we can all bask in its ' majesty without having to look at those barbaric uncivilized genocidal distant lands to the east . 
   i do n't hate turkey * makes irrelevant off-hand comment about some bad shit turkey does *, 
  by that logic all protests are comparable and relevant to each other . 
  ... maybe , but i 'm not seeing how is that relevant . 
  what 's maidan ? 
  edit : you meant meydan ? 
  square ? 
  the - \u0131 is accusative case . 
  sounds like a good backup plan if during the presidential elections , the people choose someone else . 
  mhp and akp just renews the elections until the people choose erdo\u011fan . 
  he can also market this as `` look !, 
  i 'm not completely god-like , parliament can dissolve me ^ ^ go ^ ^ ahead ^ ^ and ^ ^ try ^ ^ bitches '' too . 
  both of these make no sense . 
  where do you make such assumptions from ? 
  erdo\u011fan 's only goal is personal gain , his rhetoric is just what he wants the public to think of him . 
   btw , the people who have pushed the false meme of `` we will have more influence on turkey if they are in our ambit '' have been repeatedly and crushingly wrong . 
  they are n't proven wrong because turkey is n't in anyone 's ambit, 
  turkish liberals are civilized and pacifist people . 
  we do n't exactly specialize in killing other human beings , and most people never held a gun in their lives . 
  also it 's not easy to get guns and ammo anyway . 
  turkey is n't usa where getting weapons is easy and people are `` muh gun ownership rights '' and shit .
