  also fighting the cops and the army is bad enough but we have to fight off around half the turkish population . 
  so you got like a quarter of turkey , most of whom have never held a gun in their lives , most also has moral issues with killing other people , most leads rather civilized lives and ca n't transform into a hollywood freedom fighter in a day , etc , fighting around 30-40 % of turkey population , cops and army in a civil war . 
  what do you think our chances are ? 
  also even if we won , we 'll have free elections at the end of it , and people will just vote for another erdo\u011fan . 
  why the fuck we should risk it then ? 
  unless we plan on establishing our dictatorship which would be much more preferable . 
  why do n't you guys rebel any kill trump anyway ? 
  if it 's that simple ? 
   i did n't know chp was a terrorist supporter . 
  of course they are . 
  chp supports pkk and dhkp-c and fet\u00d6 and anything else erdo\u011fan tells us . 
   you 're going to have to organize and militarize . 
  yeah , no . 
  no `` liberal '' with a bit of brain in turkey is gon na start a civil war ( which we 'd lose anyway ) . 
  you watch too much hollywood . 
  erdo\u011fan 's supporters need to see the monster they created , let them sink to a hole of shit first . 
  though i do n't really have high expectations from them . 
  https://tr.wikipedia.org/wiki/t%c3%bcrkiye%27deki_intihar_sald%c4%b1r%c4%b1lar%c4%b1_listesi#.c4.b0ntihar_sald.c4.b1r.c4.b1lar.c4.b1_listesi and attacks in turkey did n't kill anyone ? 
  [ here is another very small list in english ] ( http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/01/01/turkey-attacks/96058890/ ) if a politician uses an attack to convince people to give power to him , then that 's fearmongering . 
  opposition parties in turkey regularly give `` captain obvious '' explanations like `` giving all the power to one person is n't democratic '' because the voters are just that thick and ignorant . 
  but of course the opposition parties are a bunch of terrorist supporters and their leader is alevi too so who is gon na listen to them right . 
  people are already paranoid about spies , if erdo\u011fan gets assassinated they would rally behind akp even stronger . 
  they would accuse kemalists , leftists , chp supporters , hdp , supporters of being involved in the assassination . 
  hell , it might give erdo\u011fan 's successor an excuse to ban chp and hdp . 
  talk to some akp supporters and half-jokingly propose a scenario where erdo\u011fan gets assassinated and ask what happens after . 
  erdo\u011fan need to die by rotting in a prison cell , that would be the best route . 
  not natural death , not assassination , by rotting in a prison cell . 
  i do n't think that 's gon na happen though . 
  if we kill erdo\u011fan , the people would see him as a martyr and vote for an even worse guy/party . 
   start collecting dirt on nasty people . 
  cameras and microphones come cheap nowadays . 
  do n't use it yet , i 'm afraid it is too early . 
   when they make a mistake and piss off part of their base , publish it en masse , try to make scenes , drag people to court . 
  but for now stock up on `` ammo '' , and quietly prep translations so intl media can jump on it . 
  what would dirt be useful for ? 
  they are doing everything out in the open , you literally can collect dirt by just reading the newspaper . 
  google `` turkey corruption scandal '' it did n't cause shit , akp supporters just did n't care . 
  [ i found this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xikjkz8xwoo9 ) but there were much more in turkish . 
  you seem to think scandals are ought to dissuade people from voting for them or at least some big uprisings , nope , akp supporters will support erdo\u011fan even if erdo\u011fan comes to their homes and buttrapes their mothers and sisters . 
  there is nothing that can change their mind . 
  so that approach is n't gon na work . 
  how ? 
  we are open for suggestions . 
  turks say `` as if we live in sweden '' as an idiom whenever they want to point out that people are being too idealistic , optimistic , naive , or childish . 
  % 80 yes from akp voters is a perfectly possible scenario . 
  the things that happened since 15 years , akp people supported it all . 
  corruption tapes , killed protestors in gezi , what makes you think they wo n't support this ? 
  at a later comment below you said this :  because akp declares anyone against them a traitor which would only make them more likely to vote yes or hide their vote intentions . 
  what do you think akp supporters think of gezi protestors ? 
  imho you have too high expectations from akp supporters . 
  you will be surprised as you probably were during corruption scandals . 
  some people do n't care about the actions , they only care who is doing them . 
  i kind of want france to elect le pen just to see what she does . 
  how much of these promises she 'll accomplish . 
  how earth will look like with trump , putin , le pen , erdogan . 
  party leader ( devlet bah\u00e7eli ) has sold out . 
  people say he has some sex tapes or some other scandal floating around . 
  he is basically erdo\u011fan 's dog now . 
  i think it 's because he made a deal with erdo\u011fan . 
  the deal is simple , bah\u00e7eli supports akp , and akp keeps bah\u00e7eli as the leader of mhp . 
  there were some dissidents in mhp that tried to shake bah\u00e7eli 's glued ass out of the leadership seat but that did n't work out . 
  akp will not allow that to happen . 
  mhp supporters being % 70 `` no '' is kinda higher than i expected . 
  i think this poll is a bit optimistic considering akp 's propaganda has n't fully started yet . 
  they 'll deceive some mhp supporters to their side after it starts so i expect at least 40 % `` yes '' nationalists are the easiest voter base to fool . 
  currently they are doing small-time things like calling no voters terrorist sympathizers and arresting no campaigners but when the propaganda really starts you 'll know . 
  majority of yes voters do n't know what they are saying `` yes '' to . 
  they just say yes because erdo\u011fan tells them to do . 
  watch any street interview the yes voters are always like `` well ... because ... no voters are terrorists '' or `` um ... because ... stronger state '' or `` because more stability '' just some random buzz words akp politicians say on tv . 
  boycotters believe one or more of the following : 1 . 
  elections are rigged ( small-time fraud does happen , there is evidence ) . 
  elections never change anything . 
  democratic structure of turkey does not allow fair elections ( % 10 election threshold , for example ) . 
  they think opposition parties are bad too . 
  they do n't want to make the government look legitimate . 
  ( so smart ) i suppose the only first two applies in this case ( since this is a referendum ) , boycotters are mostly just edgy anarchists but in general people are beginning to feel disillusioned with the `` democracy '' our country has . 
  nonetheless voter turnout is like 80 % usually which is higher than most countries . 
  turks use `` mersi '' too but it 's not very common . 
  black sea will go to shit soon too then . 
  or basically the meal of every ex-ottoman state [ .

  mandatory `` turkey not europe '' comment . 
  that `` esra < 3 \u0130lker '' carving on the table is a nice addition lol . 
  the foods on the table are things one would eat during breakfast . 
  dictatorships and foreign occupations are different things . 
  why do you think hitler ruled germany until he was defeated ? 
  because germans hate freedom ? 
  what about italy ? 
  or basically most european countries ? 
  i 'm curious about the way you rationalize this . 
  can i ask for an explanation if my inferior presence does not annoy you ? 
  i 'm curious about your thought process . 
  do n't you think there is something ironic about that for example ? 
  all turks = erdo\u011fan according to / r/europe . 
  those kinds of comments used to make me sad , then they made me think `` wow we made westerners butthurt '' but now they just make me laugh . 
  it 's not an excuse to become nationalistic ( although it 's hard to resist the push such comments give you ) , it should just make you realize that some people are not worth taking seriously . 
  becoming racist/nationalistic because of racists picking on you would be illogical anyway . 
  that was really racist , in the most ironic way ever . 
  i just happened to be born inside the borders of turkey to a turkish man and woman , therefore i have no right to criticize others ? 
  / r/europe classy as always .
