  when did this sub got this bad ? 
  i used to write here years ago . 
  people blame us for racism because of our race . 
  i ca n't be the only one who thinks this is illogical ? 
  lol that 's just too funny to be true . 
  i think he was trying to be ironic for humor 's sake . 
  because you know , / u/charmack90 said whataboutism was coming and then / u/serendipityquest complained of whataboutism while making a whataboutist comment himself . 
  or i was the only guy who saw that ? 
  edit : new itt : people are either ironical racists or ironical whataboutists . 
   what would your reaction be if germany denied the holocaust and published a similar picture ? 
  uykusuz is private , not government-controlled . 
  i do n't think caricaturists in uykusuz are to be blamed for genocide ( none of them were n't born yet to start with ) , but i 'd love to hear your arguments . 
  that 's like criticizing uk over something guardian published . 
  because when guardian publishes something , people do n't usually blame it on uk government , from what i have seen . 
  edit : [ here are the things uykusuz draws if you are curious ] ( https://duckduckgo.com/?q=uykusuz+comics&amp;t=ffsb&amp;atb=v46-5_s&amp;iar=images&amp;iax=1&amp;ia=images ) and some of their drawings of [ erdo\u011fan ] ( https://duckduckgo.com/?q=uykusuz+erdo%c4%9fan&amp;t=ffsb&amp;atb=v46-5_s&amp;iax=1&amp;ia=images ) . 
  i know you guys like blaming the genocide on every dead and alive and unborn turk but i advise logic in this case . 
  itt : turks are n't allowed to criticize anyone other than themselves . 
  why mods do n't remove submissions like this ? 
  i wonder if this counts the turkish war of independence . 
  that 's when most deaths happened . 
  it technically happened after wwi . 
  it 's the politicians and extremists fueling hatred between normal citizens . 
  a lot of people here is just agenda pushing . 
  check posting histories . 
  as long as murder and destruction does n't touch you , all is good then ? 
  if we killed your karma in / r/turkey it probably happened because people thought you were an erdo\u011fan supporter . 
  there are dozens of us !, 
  dozens !, 
  you too !, 
  why thank you . 
  turkey has friendly relations with iraq 's kurdistan region . 
  i do n't think either side will try anything funny . 
  and the tensions in east turkey is always sparked anyway . 
   turkey is against kurds . 
  no , turkey is friendly with some kurdish factions and hostile against others . 
  this `` turkey is against kurds '' thing is a western propaganda piece . 
  * laughs in turkish *, 
  if turkey is not european then stop eating them you two-faced sons of silly persons who ca n't even abide by their own principles . 
  oh fuck we need a new measurement we are not in yurop we should not be using the almighty celsius, 
  pure-blood altaic turk from the steppes . 
  we 'll send our erdo\u011fan loyalists to fight your twats . 
  win-win situation . 
  who 's up for some nice black tea after the battle ? 
  no milk though , i 'm not a bloody heretic . 
  you are spitting on the graves of billions we enslaved and murdered and raped by not giving the value coffee deserves . 
  not cool bro . 
   at least there 's not as much incest and familial assassinations here , so that 's a plus :d on the bright side yes !, 
  too bad we ca n't borrow gold from israel-flaired redditors and ban them though . 
  i need money for hoi4 . 
   constantinople is occupied . 
  bring forth thine crusaders to sack it once again then . 
  yeah . 
  we did all those . 
  but we also introduced you to coffee !, 
  man , * some * people are ungrateful : /, 
  also our currency is worth shit so that 's another advantage there too . 
  things are expensive for us ( meat ... especially meat ) but cheap for foreigners . 
  i 'm turkish , i 'm way past finding it annoying . 
  my skin is steel , my asshole is a volcano where butthurt is permanent , my heart is of stone , my brain jellified by the crushing power of a thousand memes . 
  erdo\u011fan is not an idiot to target tourists ( all despots need money to fuel their regime ) but tbh i 'm not gon na hold it against anyone if they change their vacation destinations because they do n't want to inject their tourist money in countries like that . 
  turkish tourism industry sucks dick anyway . 
  110 degrees ? 
  you are in an oven . 
  nobody should have the freedom to impose their ideology on others , especially in the matters of life . 
  mediterranean is on fire . 
  i think i actually sweated while taking a shower . 
  time to change turkey 's name into `` greater florida '', 
  far leftists and their puppy-eyed idealism . 
  everyone distrusts their government so much they prefer to trust the eu between the two , which they absolutely distrust . 
   at least with a two party system , you do n't need coalitions . 
  what 's so good about having one party dominate ? 
  depends on how much polarized the halves are . 
  if half the country wants to murder the other half , it 's not a good thing . 
  depends on how much polarized the halves are . 
  if half the country wants to murder the other half , it 's not a good thing . 
  balls are a necessary sacrifice for coffee . 
  whenever i feel bad about my country i just look at usa and their bloody idiot of a leader and feel slightly better . 
  woe is us . 
  may the holy and superior yuropeans one day overlook our damnably inferior ways and find it within their hearts to accept us humble t * rks . ^ ^ so ^ ^ we ^ ^ can ^ ^ conquer ^ ^ them ^ ^ from ^ ^ within, 
   would n't be shocked at all if he gives these contracts to friends , who then make a fortune of this . 
   no doubt a lot of corruption , cronyism , nepotism and stealing is involved in these projects . 
  spot on . 
  and it goes for more than just mosque constructions . 
  taqiyya is definitely a real thing . 
  why do n't you make a simple google search before flapping your gums ? 
  same thing with normal citizens and cults such as g\u00fclenists . 
  in turkey g\u00fclenists infiltrate the government and place their own people in high positions . 
  they also brainwash their members in meeting . 
  but in europe and us they act like a harmless charitable organization . 
  it 's the same with people , normal citizens . 
  they used to speak against headscarf ban because they saw it as something that was against liberty and freedom , because they are such liberal people , but now they want to impose their own lifestyle on everyone . 
  the freedom these kinds of people want is the freedom to crush your liberties , until then they 'll keep speaking of liberty and tolerance . 
  like most national subs . 
  \u011e doin it right ? 
  while immigrants living in europe for generations are honestly more conservative than the people living in their home countries and it makes those new immigrants a bit surprised at it , taqiyya is n't some new trope alt-righters made up . 
  islamists ( people who want to constitute islam as a political ideology ) have a tendency to feign open-mindness until the environment is more suited for their ideology . 
  erdo\u011fan used to speak in favor of lgbt rights before he became a president and we all know what kind of an islamist dickhead he is now . 
  a lot of liberals in turkey fell for erdo\u011fan 's `` mild islamism '' persona and supported him . 
  you extend one arm to the islamists they 'll rip it off your shoulder . 
  til : i 'm actually azeri or kurd .
