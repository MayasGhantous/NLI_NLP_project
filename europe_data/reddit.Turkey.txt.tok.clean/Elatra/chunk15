  these regions value hospitality too . 
  their craziness is more about their weird and funny logic . 
  and yes black sea is definitely beautiful . 
  maybe you should avoid southeastern turkey but do n't let my words stop you from visiting black sea . 
  laz are muslims . 
  basically they have assimilated to turkish culture . 
  laz live on the eastern black sea region ( north-east of turkey ) . 
  laz people are typically rednecks . 
  gun-loving , conservative , nationalistic , a little bit of crazy , etc. 
  southeastern turkey and some of inner anatolia is even more conservative . 
  while north is conservative more as a result of their nationalism , southeastern turkey is conservative with its ' tribalism and religiousness . 
  honor killings and tribal conflict is more common . 
  \u0130stanbul is the melting pot of turkey so there are neighborhoods that look like middle east and neighborhoods that look like any european city . 
  this is all a generalization of course . 
  basically the rednecks of turkey also a little bit crazy too . 
  trying too hard . 
  all people can act retarded regardless of their race . 
  it was probably a drug trafficker with the way they acted . 
  this summer is too hot for warring . 
  do n't really feel like marching at this heat . 
  i 'm already stinking like a corpse with all the sweat . 
  let 's wait for the next spring or something . 
  more like he won the referendum by cheating . 
  i said this on this sub a few times because i witnessed it happening right before my eyes when i was a ballot observer . 
  [ here is something to read further on . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/turkey/comments/6knx1o/election_forensic_analysis_of_the_turkish/ ) the ballot i was stationed at was n't that bad . 
  the only things that happened were an akp official coming in during the counting and telling us to count the unstamped votes too ( which definitely opens the way to fraud , counting unstamped votes is a fraud by itself ) , a lawyer stationed by the main opposition party getting thrown out by violence by erdo 's dogs , and the numbers on the ballot boxes being wrong . 
  also other boxes in the building i was at had several objections raised by observants . 
  worse stuff happened in other provinces . 
  observants were kicked out , some ballots reported that all votes were `` yes '' ( % 100 voter turnout and no single `` no '' vote is a little bit suspicious to say the least ) , video proofs of other forms of fraud , etc. 
  even with cheating he only won by the neck . 
  no wonder akp officials seemed oddly silent when they should have been celebrating after the referendum . 
  they are aware that they are pushing it now . 
  i 'm sure he will post some youtube comment from a turk to support his point now . 
  claims like are simply unprovable without extensive polling and pointless to argue about . 
  there are sick people from every ethnicity . 
  it 's actually bragging points for a turk to have a rich ancestry . 
  having , say , circassian ancestry is more interesting than being a `` pure turk '' ( if something like that still exists ) . 
  erdo\u011fan 's `` propaganda '' kinda helps pkk 's pr in the west than anything else . 
  i say this as a turk , that sub is a bloody disgrace filled with butthurt idiots and fragile national ego . 
  still better than the average turk though . 
   pkk seems like a great excuse to gather more power and strenghen his position exactly . 
  i do n't think erdo\u011fan and pkk want each other completely gone . 
  they indirectly benefit from each other . 
  letting pkk secede would be regarded as a political and military defeat , meaning any politician who does n't want to suicide their career would n't talk of it . 
  it 's going to feel more like giving a terrorist group victory and letting them get away with what they have done more than giving a peaceful group of people their reasonable demands in a democratic fashion ( `` all the blood we lost ! '', 
  `` we did n't fight for this ! '', 
  and all that crap rhetoric ) . 
  both sides are too much invested in this conflict with decades of emotional baggage so nobody is going to compromise . 
  hatred and desire of vengeance fuel this conflict . 
  i 'd say if pkk is destroyed there would be more hope for a diplomatic solution to southeast but we are way past that . 
  last ceasefire and diplomatic process was more like a breather period for pkk to recruit and get more supplies for the inevitable continuation of the conflict . 
  it 's all-in or nothing at this stage . 
  hell , if we were living in an ideal world i 'd want aegean coast of turkey to be independent and move there so islamist authoritarians can fuck up their lands without dragging the more open-minded and secularist turks with them . 
  what erdo\u011fan needs to do is make sure southeastern region has better infrastructure and education , but it 's not gon na happen because both pkk and erdo\u011fan has an interest in keeping the region uneducated and poor . 
  pkk gets more recruits this way and the conflict bolsters nationalist sentiments which means more votes for erdo\u011fan . 
  educated , free , safe and happy people who are hopeful of the future do n't make good militants . 
  it 's easier to radicalize the ignorant , this goes both for turks and kurds . 
  besides , pkk makes up a minority of kurds . 
  at most , kurds would prefer autonomy . 
  imo independence could be a solution , what good it is to have an arm if it 's turned black with gangrene and is slowly poisoning you ? 
  tl ; dr : nationalism is a fucked up concept . 
  edit : referring to the conflict with gangrene analogy , not the kurdish race . 
   even though they also rebelled as well but much later down the line . 
  understatement . 
  they basically made and unmade ottoman rulers with their uncontrollable political power . 
  they were still slaves in name tho . 
  it became some sort of a t * rkish meme . 
  but exclusive to / r/turkey . 
  constantinople may have fallen . 
  but the fall of constantinople gave rise to the dankest of memes . 
  [ at least they are photogenic ] ( http://haftasonu.com.tr/images/stories/yazarlar/2013/mayis/13054-gk-16.jpg ) [ maybe ] ( http://i.hurimg.com/i/hurriyet/75/590x332/55eacb71f018fbb8f8972e2d.jpg ), 
  whenever someone i just met handshakes me a bit too strong , my immediate thought is `` ok , this guy might turn out to be an asshole '', 
  erdo\u011fan 's goal with crap like this is to create enemies and polarization . 
  that 's how he aims to keep his rule over turkey . 
  [ mandatory `` turkey not in / r/europe '' comment . ], 
  free encyclopedia . 
  ironic . 
  i can tag a couple just now . 
  they hide in threads like this and save their bullshit for other threads . 
  keep calm and slap the \u00e7avu\u015f . 
  i can access with opendns . 
  probably an isp thing . 
  of course that 's the general sentiment . 
  me too . 
  at least 40 % must have said yes to it and that 's still a scary number . 
  erdo\u011fan supporters are n't the type of people who care about information . 
  because they are all a bunch of retards . 
  if they really love akp they can come here and live in the hell they are creating . 
  i 'd love to switch places with them . 
  if i had to live with them i 'd probably end up voting for afd , le pen , wilders and the like lol . 
  imagine living in turkey . 
  the best way to cope with it is by just joking about it . 
  and hey at least students will stop copying wikipedia articles now . 
  erdo , always looking out for education and science . 
  in dictatorship , dictator removes the democracy . 
  in advanced democracy , you vote to remove the democracy !, 
  ^ ^ minus ^ ^ the ^ ^ referendum ^ ^ fraud ^ ^ that ^ ^ is, 
  it 's basically a cesspool of propaganda wars . 
  just a bunch of people trying to prove that their side is right and all other sides suck , and some i guess are curious westerners trying to learn things ... on reddit .
