  chirp chirp ... chirp chirp ... nope , not dead yet . 
  unless a government agent snipes me from the top of that bu -, 
  turkey is n't the attacker . 
  pkk is the attacker . 
  pkk may see themselves as having the right to separate but turkey has the right to protect its ' borders against military threats . 
  why do you think turkey is the attacker ? 
  by that logic western powers are attackers against isis in middle east and isis has the right to self-defence . 
  we 'd probably lose anyway . 
  i do n't see how bombing and shooting people can fix a broken democracy . 
   shall we count civilian deaths on both sides of the conflict ? 
  how can you do something like that reliably ? 
  all casualties were turkish citizens . 
  are you going to look at corpses and say `` well , looks kurdish , which means he got killed by turks '' urban-guerilla warfare is n't exactly a type of conflict where you can easily understand who killed more civilians . 
  and pkk should stop using cities like human shields and explosive attacks if they really want to keep civilian casualties down anyway . 
  if turkey really wanted to kill civilians , there would only be rubble in southeast . 
   you 're much more likely to get hit by a car i heard this like a hundred times but it still does n't change the fact that terrorist attacks affect people psychologically . 
  even tourists do n't want to come to turkey because of that . 
  [ i wish there was an english page of this list of attacks ] ( https://tr.wikipedia.org/wiki/pkk_sald%c4%b1r%c4%b1lar%c4%b1_ve_%c3%a7at%c4%b1%c5%9fmalar%c4%b1_kronolojisi ), 
  i thought they were hated for being pro-akp especially after erdo called germans and dutch nazis . 
  i 'm not exactly fond of them either , do n't feel the need to be politically correct if that 's what this is about . 
  this retard again . 
  \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu ca n't be compared to littlefinger because littlefinger is actually clever and a good politician . 
  those disgusting blacks , always accusing good hardworking whites of being racists !, 
  i pity the other ethic groups then . 
  then you are naive . 
  a lot of turks are in prison as well for no other reason than opposing the government , but we are n't butchering our conservative neighbors just yet . 
  we 'd probably get european support if we start a civil war against islamists though . 
  pkk does n't even have popular support among kurds . 
  most kurds are also civilized normal human beings who are trying to get on with their lives . 
  most people in turkey would rather get on with their lives without worrying about some weirdo jihadi or nationalist kurd exploding or shooting something next to us . 
  people are less supportive right now but we were saying this earlier and we all saw how much the fake coup increased in his support . 
  even some of the anti-erdo\u011fan folk in ek\u015fi are blaming europe of secretly aiding the akp 's referendum campaign with moves like this . 
  akp has enough propaganda tools to spin every negative thing into a positive for their side . 
  i heard big areas in new york are now no-go zones and texas is basically a muslim state . 
   so they are so stupid , when others criticize their leader ( s ) , they 'll get radicalized ? 
  kinda . 
   but shared it anyway they share things like this to score `` evil yurop oppresses us '' points . 
  us support for grey wolves and the military coup was much more subtle and less-known than this . 
  til cops exist, 
  why all these people are spending their money on things like that ? 
  i 'm speechless . 
   or with our governments history of propping up shitty leaders we `` control '' . 
  why is the sarcastic quotation marks ? 
  except for the occasional loose cannon it worked well for us . 
  i do n't think most americans know what brexit is . 
  something about deporting the `` little anatolian fuckers who call us nazis '' remove kebab does n't offend me i got used to it long ago . 
  but i know the reaction i 'd get if i said `` remove armenian '' or something like that . 
  something ironically racist as usual . 
  most europeans are not racist , but when they are , they do it ironically . 
  in every thread about turkey , if there is a comment about atat\u00fcrk , there is always another comment making the decade old `` atat\u00fcrk rotating grave '' joke , and there is a butthurt greek comment . 
  then there is a `` this is not related to / r/europe '' comment somewhere down the line . 
  and someone who says `` and this country want to join eu , pathetic '' or something like that . 
  turkey not yurop 4 . 
  turkey ca n't into eu 5 . 
  armenian , greek , assyrian , kurdish , christian , orthodox , arap genocides . 
  if one of those comments are missing , the thread just loses its ' special taste . 
  in turkey , laws are enforced or not enforced depending on whom it benefits or punishes , so it does n't matter what turkish law prohibits . 
   kemalist predatory state has committed genocide [ 1 ] literally the first link i checked says `` pontian and anatolian greeks were victims of a broader turkish genocidal project aimed at all christian minorities in the ** ottoman empire . 
  ** '' and we are supposed to believe that this is the evidence of atat\u00fcrk 's genocides ? 
  oh who knew , ottoman empire was apparently a kemalist state !, 
  what a pile of propagandist bullshit . 
  why do you guys always get triggered whenever atat\u00fcrk 's name gets mentioned and always lie to stick his name into the mud ? 
  i do n't want to say that word , but it starts with `` b '' and ends with `` utthurt '' liberation of \u0130zmir is still celebrated every year , how do you feel about that ? 
  are you still angry about 1453 too ? 
  what a glorious day of genocide looting and rape that was , i still remember it to this day . 
  hey hey , maybe you are angry at 1071 too . 
  your comment history says enough . 
  how many copypastas do you keep ? 
  or are you an automated bot that pops out the appropriate copypasta whenever specific keywords get mentioned ? 
  whenever atat\u00fcrk gets mentioned there is always a greek blaming him of being a genocidal maniac . 
  i do n't like seeing atat\u00fcrk 's name in / r/europe . 
  his name has been dragged through enough dirt by erdo\u011fan 's propaganda machine anyway . 
   orgenicing organize . 
  organizing . 
  wow i 'm so triggered, 
  mwannalag . 
  sounds like the name of an egg mine or velothi tower . 
  in the referendum the nationalists are the defining factor . 
  most of them are undecided . 
  all parties are currently trying to attract these voters at the moment . 
  chp and hdp will be leading the `` no '' campaign so i guess chp will try to attract nationalists while hdp tries to attract kurds . 
  but most hdp mps are in jail anyway i do n't think they ca n't do an efficient campaign . 
   are the people in turkey aware that the government is seeking partnerships with germany hahahaha nope . 
  you think they 'd allow this kind of news to appear in turkey ? 
  no mainstream media is talking about it . 
  akp voters are n't aware of this . 
  but even if they knew i 'm sure they 'd solve the `` germany is terrorists and shit ! '', 
  and `` we need halp germoney halp us : c '' logical complexity with some quick doublethinking anyway . 
   and would the people in turkey think differently of erdogan if the economic situation should become worse ? 
  some would , not everyone . 
  i remember a street interview where the reporter is asking `` what do you think about the rising fuel prices ? '', 
  and the guy says `` i always ask the gas stations to add 50 liras worth of fuel to my car so it does n't affect me '' i do n't think that guy had the mental capacity to understand that as gas prices rise , he will be getting less gas for 50 liras . 
   is that something were germany and other countries could probably hurt erdogan e.g. 
  by not giving him the kind of partnerships that is apperently seeking ? 
  it would hurt erdo\u011fan 's votes but like i said some people are going to support him no matter what . 
  but we 'd see his votes dropping to somewhere between 30-40 percentages at least . 
  enough for him to lose his sanity . 
  trump , erdo\u011fan and putin might be the clones who went through extensive plastic surgery . 
  and half the nation still loves him despite all he has done . 
  that 's enough for him to do whatever he wants .
