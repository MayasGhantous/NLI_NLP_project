  turks are much much more different than germans . 
  there is islam to start with . 
  italians and greeks are at least christians . 
  they used to attack nationalists too to get kurdish votes . 
  most of kurds used to vote for akp . 
  hdp managed to grab some of those votes so akp is nationalist now . 
  akp officials used to be pretty close with pkk and \u00d6calan . 
  he says `` erdo\u011fan went a step too far . '', 
  they are probably still ok with erdo\u011fan , except for his last few remarks . 
  it was just a step too far , never mind all the shit he has done . 
  exactly . 
  they get to live with the luxuries of germany and its ' liberal environment while imposing their oppressive lifestyle on us . 
  better than i expected . 
  free media can be bought and suppressed while still keeping it `` free '' in name . 
  akp supporters are circlejerking on twitter about how strong a leader erdo\u011fan is and how germany is a terrorist-supporting country . 
  so not really . 
  it only damaged his international reputation . 
  domestic reputation is all he cares about . 
  i 'm really curious about the percentage of yes votes that 'll come out of germany . 
  probably at least 70 % . 
  is it democracy to let people vote for a dictatorship ? 
  is it tolerance to let the intolerant prosper ? 
  i / \u0130 \u0131 / i '' \u0131 '' and `` i '' letters are different in turkish . 
  in english , i only becomes \u0131 ( i ) if it 's capital . 
  this seems strange to turks just starting to learn english . 
  on the turkish keyboard i and \u0131 are on different keys , so we have to shift + \u0131 to make an i. 
  for lower case `` i '' we press the `` i '' button . 
  [ here is a turkish keyboard ] ( http://s.ecrater.com/stores/324543/55197f6748bf7_324543b.jpg ) [ more info at wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dotted_and_dotless_i )  \u0130stanbul / is\u02c8tanbu\u026b / ( starts with an i sound , not an \u0131 ) . 
   diyarbak\u0131r / dija\u027e\u02c8bak\u026f\u027e / ( the first and last vowels are spelled and pronounced differently ), 
  not to mention it 'll get le pen more votes . 
  ops in such threads are also usually obsessed with whatever country they are starting negative threads about . 
  happens with turkey too , which is strange , considering there is plenty of shit you can criticize with turkey enough to fill pages without ever needing to make up new ones . 
  \u00d6 \u00dc \u0130 scandinavia got nuthin on us . 
  think again . 
  you mean us harboring the cult leader that infiltrated turkish government ( with akp 's encouragement ) ? 
  yeah he still does but he is now spicing things up with germany . 
  maybe later he 'll return to usa . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xikjkz8xwoo video is shitty and translation is bad but it 's the only english version i found . 
  there are more recordings around . 
  lol please do n't !, 
  misunderstandings happen on internet . 
  and it 's not like all turks love greeks lol . 
  we have some real turkish heroes fighting in youtube comments section and such . 
  they would take being compared to greeks as an insult too . 
  in the end we are all humans . 
  it was funny seeing kristof going from `` greek tourism is so great ! '', 
  to `` facts are facts : c '' like watching a guy getting shot down by the girl he loves and he acts like `` mhm i did n't give a fuck anyway '' ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ not ^ ^ reflecting ^ ^ something ^ ^ that ^ ^ happened ^ ^ to ^ ^ me ^ ^ here : c, 
  because when a russian says that lithuanians are `` kinda like us '' it holds a patronizing , imperialist attitude . 
  but when a turk says it , they say it because they see greeks as a more brotherly nation . 
  i know erdo gets you guys angry at turks with the shit he 's saying and pulling at aegean , but he is n't exactly kind to us turks either . 
  when a turk says greeks similar to turks , that 's supposed to be a unifying comment , not a hostile or trolling one . 
  i do n't think greeks and turks are * that * similar , the hatred between our nations are easy to see even in platforms like reddit . 
  but turks do n't see that hatred that much . 
  you guys see news about erdo saying `` those rocks on the sea belong to us ! '', 
  or some turkish airforce entering into your territory . 
  what do we see ? 
  we see movies with greek minorities in turkey . 
  they are always kind and sympathetic . 
  if a turkish character travels to greece , he is always hosted as a well treated guest by greeks , and greeks are shown to have positive characteristics that turks share ( music , hospitality , etc ) . 
  we do n't share the same perspective . 
  both perspectives are flawed . 
  therefore , this misunderstanding happens . 
  lithuania and russia are different comparison . 
  it would make sense for a lithuanian to feel insulted or `` trolled '' for being compared to a russian . 
  all my friends who had their vacations in greece praised greek tourism industry . 
  almost all of them also think negatively about turkish tourism in comparison . 
  in turkey they 'll try to rip you off and give you the cheapest service they can . 
  they see tourists as stupid walking money bags . 
  in comparison greece comes out on top imo . 
  he was complimenting greece , but you guys just have to be mean assholes . 
  i knew some greek would take offense at this lmao he compared greece to turkey !, 
  if i was a mod i 'd ban him for degrading greece like that . 
  dear serbs and turks !, 
  do n't say something positive and unifying about this !, 
  ** it goes against our national stereotypes !, 
  ** * enter offensive joke about infidel serbs here * * enter jokes about kebab here * * something about ottoman empire * * something about bosnian war *, 
   all hail supreme leaders putin and erdogan and their divine alliance !, 
  and the occasional friendly fire to keep things interesting . 
   maybe then people will realize what went wrong and get rid of him for good . 
   people will realize  realize ahahahahahahahahaha ok stop making such sarcastic jokes now we are discussing something serious here ffs . 
  turkish rednecks . 
  looks like it for now , but you never know what they 'll try . 
  good . 
  turkish tourism workers are getting what they deserve . 
  let 's see them begging for domestic tourists now . 
  maybe now the big bosses will start questioning their policies and akp . 
  1.5 is too much for that film . 
  embrace the manliness and badassery . 
  majority of voters in turkey also voted for someone else . 
  but that 's the thing with having more than two political parties . 
  actually no . 
  they like the fact that one euro is four liras so they can come here with their cold hard euro bills and buy whatever they want for cheap prices , then they say `` turkey 's economy is so good '' turkey 's economy would be good for all of us in turkey too if minimum wage was n't 350 euros !, 
  i heard zimbabwe has even better economy , maybe they should have their vacation over there . 
  three more . 
  * atheists and leftists ( `` these are atheists , terrorists , leftists ! '', 
  - erdo ) * nationalists ( `` we took every kind of nationalism under our feet ! '', 
  - erdo ) edit : alevis too . 
  edit2 : fixed a word, 
  that 's fucking badass . 
  edit : now i have to show you something badass my nation has done right ?
