  it is as stupid to say americans are somewhere between mexicans and africans , just because those are part of america and american people , as turks are somewhere between greeks and armenians . 
  amazing photo xocam, 
  it is okay to eat them but not fight them ? 
  how can arabs be anti-semitic ? 
  they are semites . 
  was n't sodomy illegal in cyprus up until like last year ?

  morally deviant does n't equal inhuman . 
  in fact , there is nothing more human than this sort of behaviour , neither is there anything inhuman about it . 
  let 's not demonize others to distance them from ourselves to feel better . 
  how do you know ? 
  just because it is off the coast of colombia does n't mean the gold in it was mined there . 
  not to mention you are pretty much arguing about legitimacy of spoils of war . 
  by that logic every country that has ever been in a war has a lot to give back . 
  not to mention colombia exists because of spain , not like they can give it back to the mayans or the incas . 
  all gold and silver in any spanish vessel should belong to them . 
  turkey out of nato now . 
  the fact they exist and have legal application is inexcusable in the first place . 
  there are sharia courts in england ? 
  this has been going on since 60s . 
  akp and feto are both same shit . 
  just because incidents put them on opposite sides does n't mean i 'll be supporting either . 
  enemy of my enemy is still my enemy in this case . 
  do n't pretend eu countries are doing charity when turkey spent more than what they are giving is what i am saying . 
  the `` billions '' turkey has received is less than turkey has spent on refugees . 
  turkey holds more refugees than all of europe combined . 
  fetullah g\u00fclen was in on the akp 's corruption train until their interests conflicted , now his agencies are doing the propaganda like they have been before they had the falling out with erdogan , just on the other side of the coin . 
  i hope turkey has been buying oil from isis .

  i am inclined to think russia would be on assad 's side on the hypothetical confrontation between assad and kurds . 
  any particular reason why you think russia would want to secure autonomy for syrian kurds against wishes of assad ? 
  why would i be wishful about kurds being bombed ? 
  it is unrelated , it is simply geopolitics , if kurds pose a threat to assad 's rule , they will get opposed by russia . 
  1 ) ypg supports pkk . 
  2 ) a number of countries has 3 ) they will if it comes to that , currently islamic rebels are biggest threat to assad 's rule, 
  pkk is an internationally recognized terrorist organization . 
  also anyone that is against assad will get bombed by russia , regardless of what turkey does , russia is only using turkey 's actions as an excuse to what they have been doing already ( bombing rebels ) . 
  russia 's intervention and support of assad hurts europe and us as much as it hurts turkey , because assad is against qatar-turkey pipeline , as is russia , which would be beneficial to not only turkey but to europe as well . 
  oh i thought it was wrong to bomb militias fighting isis , i guess it is only wrong when turkey does it . 
  for pkk * kurds are n't a monolithic entity . 
  it was made by a german speaker , they label french as warmongers with a bloodlust because that 's how they have seen them and frankly , how they behaved . 
  it just works . 
  nice circlejerk, 
  the person who killed him was obviously against peace . 
  it is odd bosnia would become a stronghold of salafism . 
  i thought they were hanafi like turks are , since they are muslims due ottomans . 
  thanks based sweden . 
  turkish and greek air-forces dogfight very commonly . 
  damn , can i apply instead ? 
  it is not even because i am in a bad situation in my country or i dislike it , i just find portugal to be one of the better countries in the world , regardless of wages . 
  it has to do with 80s coup and that generation mostly . 
  not because religious people `` radicalised '' , turkey is more or less as religious as it was 10 years ago . 
  the difference is erdogan is good at manipulation and heavily controls media , so he gets votes from the conservatives while nationalists and leftists are divided on votes . 
  before that , it used to be opposite , conservatives were divided on votes . 
  turks feel turkish , what turkish means differentiates from turk to turk , some feel it is part of asia , some middle-east and some europe . 
   of course reality does n't change , but perception of it can have have huge consequences , especially in politics . 
  one can even say that reality has only half meaning in politics , domestic and foreign . 
  it definitely does , yet turkey ca n't stop european media can it ? 
  if they want to say turkey supports isis , they will say that . 
   so pkk is all there is to the kurds then ? 
  turkey bombs pkk , is against a state formed by their allies ypg . 
  turkey is n't against `` kurds '' , the notion is ridiculous , there is 20 million kurds in turkey , iraqi kurdistan is the closest ally turkey has in the area . 
  turkish military trains peshmerga . 
  of course sensationalist media enjoys writing turkey is bombing kurds , because it is n't really as big news if you say they have been bombing a terrorist organization they have been fighting for the past 40 years . 
  there is also more weight to it by making it seem like an ethnic conflict . 
   there is however a firm belief even among turks over here ( so i mean belgium to be perfectly clear ) that turkey is definitely abetting isis . 
  it is really irrelevant what diaspora turks believe . 
  what people believe does n't change the reality . 
   in this conflict turkey 's priorities are definitely not 100 % the same as our own whom ? 
   especially the kurd question is a painful points . 
  pkk is a terrorist organization as recognized by un . 
  but russia 's priorities are probably even less aligned with ours russia wants assad in control and cull opposition against him , does n't matter who they are . 
   there is one thing were turkey 's ( long term ) interests are aligned with our own , even more so than with the us : peace and stability in the middle-east do n't be so sure that is what us wants . 
  that 's what turkey is trying to do , if there was a sunni , turkey friendly government in syria , that also partnered with turkey for qatar-turkey pipeline , it would be the most beneficial and least risky agreement . 
  it seems like muslim women have been making those comparisons themselves . 
  in religion , it is taken for granted that if you do n't obey the god 's orders , you will receive punishment . 
  if they are religious and do believe in god , then they would want to , for themselves , to cover up . 
  there are plenty of muslim women that want to cover because they want to obey the word of god . 
  like how there are muslims that do n't eat pork or drink alcohol because they want to obey the word of god . 
  that 's what i think is part of harmful affirmative action . 
  i think cultural literacy is necessary to be thought to children of immigrants , not trying to promote multiculturalism . 
  i do n't agree with multiculturalism . 
  a culture can have multiple roots , aspects and elements in it from different sources , there is nothing wrong with that but they should be part of the same , unified culture , not random cultures from different parts of the world all promoted in varying levels . 
  assad himself buys isis oil , sorry but not every country can be sufficient in terms of oil , you have to think smart , us can supply its oil , europe can supply its oil , turkey ca n't . 
  one of the reasons why turkey supports rebels is because of qatar-turkey pipeline , turkey is heavily depended on russia otherwise . 
  not to mention turkey already has the highest price oil per gallon in the world . 
  turkey failed to police its border when fighting pkk , what makes you think they can do it with isis ? 
  it is a 800 km border mate , what do you expect ? 
  turkey dos crack down on smugglers , just yesterday some were arrested , also it is european nation 's responsibility the isis fighters do n't leave their country , not turkey 's to collect their trash . 
  turkey is n't abetting isis , it is abetting other islamic rebels , especially the turkmens in the area . 
  whether this is acceptable or not is up to debate but it is definitely not isis . 
  pkk is a terrorist organization and has been more harmful to turkey and development of southeast than isis has ever been , so turkey has its priorities correct . 
  i hate erdogan , you ca n't even know the degree which i dislike him but you are not aware of the history of turkey or region , you only know history of syrian conflict , which is not enough to judge turkey 's actions . 
  the reason it took so long for us was because us was n't in line with turkish claims and aims , neither was us decided on actually bombing them yet . 
  germany will likely also operate from turkey , but it can operate from other closer nato bases as well . 
  i guess if people saw that the reason europe got its current secularism was because it had complete religious freedom , then people themselves desired the secularism , as being religious was n't part of their identity any more , they might understand . 
  people call me a muslim because i want people to be atheists , weird . 
   because religion does n't let that happen you fucking retard . 
  if religion does n't let that happen , how come there are people who do let go of religion ?
