it can be easily verifiable by the kind of topic he removes . 
  okay ; use them as an argument , instead of sharing mod activity table and calling him agenda pusher based on that . 
   lol 'd at the ultra-pissed vocal minority if weakling lefties bitching here if you are talking about me ; really now ? 
  you just called me leftist , as an insult ( !?! ), 
  because i stated the obvious , kek 'd . 
  if not , why do you bitch about leftists bitching to me ? 
  do i look like i care ? 
  i dont even care if he pushes agenda or not , if you have good evidence for your claims create a meta thread here or on / r/europemeta . 
  thats how norrisobe lost his mod rights , in only 1 day . 
  easy , right ? 
  nahh , its not for some reason . 
  you guys actually really funny rofl, 
  why ? 
  that picture doesnt make/show / u/dclauzel as an agenda pusher , it makes/shows hes the most active mod . 
  recently , / u/norrisobe lost his mod rights because real agenda pushing , and he was one of the most inactive mods as you can see . 
  lol , you guys . 
  because they are poor and developing ( equals better healthcare , less child deads , less birth rate ) countries . 
  you can compare gdp per capita and population growth ( or fertility rate ) map and see the correlation . 
  [ wiki page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographic-economic_paradox ) about this topic . 
  also , good explanation from this thread , [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3kwguy/regional_shares_of_the_world_population_19502100/cv1lmdx ) .

  turkish and german is different in every aspect you could find though . 
  its hard to learn both or differenate them when you are just a child . 
  its not like learning swedish plus danish or english plus german in same time . 
  there are really different rules for turkish compared to german ( vice versa ) . 
  nah , its more like `` germans wont accept me , because im different ! '', 
  germans wont accept them because broken language , and give them names . 
  turks ( when they came turkey ) wont accept them because broken language , and give them names . 
  that what happens when you are the child of migrants , your parents try to teach you both languages ( or mother language in home , german in school ) and you suck at both . 
  even when you learn/speak perfectly after years , you will still have that trauma from childhood . 
  results of integration instead of assimilation . 
  most of time they accept situation and move on . 
  ask / u/clit _ commander , hes german turkish nationalist ( afaik ) , he can give more insight . 
  edit : similar comment in [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3kk2zq/turks_vs_kurds_clashes_in_frankfurt/cuy7ve5?context=1 ) thread explains it very well . 
  diaspora nationalism is a thing , and generally worse than normal nationalists . 
   they live in camps , get food and water `` turkey has taken in 1.7 million syrian refugees since the syrian conflict began in 2011 , but only 265,000 of these are living in 24 refugee camps , according to its emergency agency afad . '', 
  i dont think there is an agreement for that , because if there was , greece would be already using it . 
  but how do you prove them coming from turkey if they are * illegal * ( not documented ) in turkey too ( or turkey just * `` loses '' * documents ) ? 
  what if they claim to escape from coast cities of syria ? 
  anyway , i dont wan na argue refugees , but please dont fuck us we already have enough problems ty, 
  yes , theres a relevant agreement . 
  [ here ] ( https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1951_refugee_convention ) , read , especially article 32 and 33 . 
  now add dublin regulations and decide what * legal * ways eu members has to send refugees to turkey . 
   they are breaking the dublin agreements if they let refugees leave turkey for europe . 
  dublin regulation is eu only agreement , and [ turkey is not a participant ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dublin_regulation#/media/file:dublin_regulation.svg ) . 
  * d. turkey unoffically supports/help more refugees to reach europe . 
  refugees wants to live in europe , turkey just ignores them since we are already overwhelmed by refugees , pkk , isis threat etc. 
  sending refugees to turkey with threats would not backfire to turkey act and help refugees to reach europe at all . 
  ( / s ) i dont understand why / u/strukkstar wants to fuck turkey tho , when you could easily pay turkey for refugees ( and camps ) and guarantee they will fight smugglers instead of making relations shittier . 
   godwin 's law ( turkish version ) . 
   as an online discussion about turkey grows longer , the probability of someone mentions armenian genocide or constantinople approaches 1 . 
  you know , i actually created this account to write this everytime someone ** mentions armenia ( ns ) ** in turkey releated topic ** that has nothing to do with armenia ** , but i got bored of it at some point . 
  but you people never get bored of it , lol . 
  i actually shoulda write a bot to do that , but i know nothing about reddit bots and never bothered to research . 
   i think the article 's point is that both of them are causes . 
  of course , everything affects economy . 
  but read what you wrote again : you ignored all other factors and claimed isis and pkk is the main reason . 
  no , its not main reason and its not even close to being secondary reason . 
   so , you 're telling me that the pkk is avenging something before it happens . 
  makes no sense what ? 
  no i didnt say anything close to that . 
  suruc bombing happened in 20 july , killing of 2 policeman happened in 22 july , as a `` revenge '' to `` isis attacks . '', 
  makes sense , right ? 
  attack the country that targeted by isis and call it revenge , lol . 
   anyway , my point is that the spirit of the truce had been violated before suruc , as turkey helped isis ( directly or indirectly ) , just to undermine the ypg . 
  i think it sowed a climate of distrust that undermined the ceasefire and put everything else in motion . 
  funny , because pkk uses building dams and security posts as casus belli , but you say it was helping isis . 
  even pkk doesnt believe turkey helping isis or/and have evidence to claim that , so they didnt use it as casus belli , but you can claim easily it without even thinking . 
  an american ypg fighter claimed that turkey showed their positions with lights , attacked him and bombed ypg positions ** after ** turkey started pkk operations . 
  when someone asked for a single ** low quality ** evidence , he stopped talking . 
  they have photographers/journalists in every place , but couldnt take a solid evidence to show turkey helping isis ? 
  sounds believable , right ? 
  anyway , my point is ** it was pkk ** who announced and ended ceasefire , like it or not but stop pretending like erdogan did it for votes . 
  only thing you can blame erdogan for is , that he insisted in `` peace progress '' and allowed pkk to store weapons in cities . 
   we both know that turkey dragged its feet and only opened the border to refugees as a result of international pressure . 
  ahaha , international pressure , right . 
  israel has 0 refugees . 
  turkey could do same . 
  internal pressure from germany in eu couldnt force other eu countries to accept more refugees . 
  you are so funny actually , claiming more than 2 million refugees as a result of international pressure ? 
  lol . 
  yeah dude , turkey does nothing right , turkey is a shithole , worse than hitler etc. 
  we dont even host refugees without international pressure , yeah  erdogan could have shown some good will towards the kurds in kobane and syria and i do n't think the pkk would have had a leg to stand on . 
  i dont know how you can still expect more from turkey . 
  let me go with your flair then . 
  that refugee child , a kurd from kobane . 
  remeber that ? 
  [ canada didnt accept them ] ( http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/drowned-boys-family-sought-refuge-in-canada ) , so they tried to pass aegean sea illegally . 
  huh , ironic , right ? 
   who would have thought that getting in bed with the devil ( isis ) , starting a war with the pkk because of this ( see the kobane incident ) , so that erdogan can get the supermajority he wants would turn the economy into a mess ? 
  lol you wish it was related to that , but no its akp 's retarded economy policy , nothing more . 
  economy was * `` going down '' * since 2007 . 
  its funny because just yesterday somebody else asked similar thing , i answered it with [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjreudqhmgm ) video . 
  if you are interested in turkish economics , and/or why its going down , i suggest you to watch . 
  if you are interested in bs , well , good luck . 
   starting a war with the pkk because of this ( see the kobane incident ) ** he didnt start pkk war ** , pkk did with [ killing 2 sleeping policeman ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/turkey/11755018/two-turkish-police-officers-killed-close-to-syria-border.html ) ** as a revenge ** to ** isis attack ** ( suruc bombing ) , lol . 
  they even [ announced end of ceasefire ] ( http://rudaw.net/english/middleeast/turkey/120720151 ) 12 days before that . 
  get your facts straight . 
  erdogan saw the opportunity and followed it . 
  oh , let me get into kobane incident too .
