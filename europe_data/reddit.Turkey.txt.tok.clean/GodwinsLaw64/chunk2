  [ turkey hosted 200,000 refugees ] ( http://english.alarabiya.net/en/news/middle-east/2015/01/26/turkey-opens-biggest-camp-for-kobane-refugees-.html ) ** only ** from kobane siege , 60,000 returned after kobane secured . 
  rest still in turkey . 
  some european countries going nuts over 20,000 refugee ** by 2020 ** , we hosted 200,000 just from one siege of war . 
  so , what im supposed to see here ? 
  edit : numbers, 
   imf , nato , eu , un , germany , australia , france , spain do not . 
  if you wan na list countries , here , [ full list ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/macedonia_naming_dispute#naming_policies_of_foreign_countries_and_organisations ) with a [ map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/macedonia_naming_dispute.svg ) . 
  red - former yugoslav republic of macedonia green - republic of macedonia blue - unknown gray - no diplomatic relations so majority calls republic of macedonia , if that matters . 
  russia cant prevent nato intervention in syria , maybe iran , but they wouldnt risk it . 
  also , you can always go with `` its against isis ! '', 
  argument , and create * buffer zone * / * safe zone * in isis areas , dont forget that nato is already intervening syria by using isis excuse . 
  also : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_supervision_mission_in_syria / https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/u.s.%e2%80%93russia_peace_proposals_on_syria, 
  okay , if he wants to involve nato , why not just start a * peace keeping mission * ( or * buffer zone/safe area * ) by un ( if un cant , by nato ) for refugees ? 
  currently , all he wants is to push problem out of europe , to turkey . 
  why not aim to stop problem ? 
  do people really think turkey is happy with refugees ? 
  * `` but its closer culture !, 
  '' * yeah you have no idea what youre talking about . 
  [ yes its not ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/plates_tect2_en.svg ) . 
  also , [ cyprus is rightful ~ ~ turkish ~ ~ asian clay ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/europe_asia_transcontinental.png ) but no one argues if cyprus is european or asian . 
  all depends on how do you define a continent . 
  the scientific way ; europe is part of eurasia . 
  historically , ural mountains / caucasus mountains / turkish straits , which still makes cyprus outside of europe . 
  so , is it not arbitary now ? 
  you know , more than 10 million people ( recorded ) lives in turkish europe . 
  thats more than some european countries , and its 1/8 of population . 
  also , i forgot to mention , that turkish europe bigger than some of the europe countries if that matters . 
  `` not arbitary '' yeah sure . 
  i didnt even notice you were mod here , lol . 
  messaged admins , thanks anyway . 
  [ he does the same ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/turkey/comments/3hkv5e/8_soldiers_killed_in_mine_attack_by_pkk/cu8bqbg?context=3 ) , and hes old account banned because of it , thus hes trying to dodge ban ; so he cant talk to admins without risking his own account . 
  how do i know hes the same person ? 
  because , after i write `` he reminds me of x '' , he deleted more than 10 + comments from / r/worldnews about turkey and he was the only mod of / r/pkk ( empty sub ) , [ / r/pkk was requested by him ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/comments/3fxu2e/requesting_rpkk_only_mod_has_been_inactive_for_4 ) ( deleted , you can use any undeleter to see username ) , you can see he [ deleted his own rights ] ( https://web.archive.org/web/20150814022913/https://www.reddit.com/user/helpasaddoge ) and give mod rights to 0/0 account with 0 activity same day with my response . 
  he also uses same arguments with that banned guy , same formatting etc. 
  im actually gon na message admins right now . 
  [ case ] ( http://www.theliberati.net/quaequamblog/wp-content/no-to-av-maternity-604x270.jpg ) [ in ] ( http://mippr.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/no-to-av-soldier.jpg ) [ point ] ( https://greigdarby.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/no-to-av-rubiks.jpg ) uk and their campaigns man, 
  the main difference between bulgaria and greece is , greece has shitton of small to big islands in aegean , which many of them is really close to turkey . 
  migrants arent using land border but sea . 
  and as long as you are in greek territorial waters , and ask for refugee status , they cant touch you ( if they obey eu laws/refugee conventions ) . 
  and if they dont , its really easy to document ( again , really really close to turkey , and frontex patrols ) , which might lead to different consequences compared to bulgaria . 
  but you know that turkey related things are posted here even before this . 
  if you argue agaisnt that ; if you think that this post doesnt fit subreddit , just report it or send a modmail ; no need to start a discussion . 
  okay , i didnt say anything against that ( and same can be applied to this post too , you know , fits the rules ) ; but you seem to obsessed by term `` european '' , so i suggested that sub to you . 
  then continue posting on / r/european , easy , right ? 
  fyi , / r/european is a seperate subreddit ( and you already know that ) . 
  / r/europe has a map on top-right side , and that map includes from cyprus to armenia . 
  `` this is not / r/eu either , why cyprus is included ? '', 
  because , this is / r/europe . 
   third one is the same with the subtitled one . 
  i meant the length of video . 
   you assume an attack based on allegations of a fisherman out of a video that 's shit . 
  so refugees decided to use last chance to swim , since theyre in aegean sea ( best sea ) ? 
  lol actually i found 3 version of video , that was the longest one , i used that . 
  [ third one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=123nt5d174k ) . 
  i rewatched first video , they assume that coast guard popped boat at 0:22 , since they see a refugee in water . 
  boat is behind the ship , off screen . 
  okay , let me try again . 
  you can see ship in 0:46 ( first video ) . 
  this ship is gray ( or light blue , its hard to distinguish ) , [ turkish ships are all white ] ( http://www.sgk.tsk.tr/baskanliklar/harekat/platformlar/platforms.asp ) . 
  turkish ships either has turkish flag or red marking . 
  this ship does not . 
  since its captured with an old phone , its hard to distinguish whats writen on ship . 
  * ' [ helenictic coast guard ] ( http://www.hcg.gr/ ) ' * website  english is broken ( for me ) , i dont know if they have ship list ( i couldnt find it with google translate , at least ) . 
  so , i searched it on google , and closest i could find is [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/hellenic_coast_guard.jpg ) , but i dont know . 
  dont you think a planned propaganda video ( or conspiracy ) would have better phones ( to capture video ) , a copy/clone of greek ships with really clean greek flag ? 
  they could capture ripping apart part too . 
  heres full video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qigigkptmhg he starts capturing after greek coast guard `` pops '' boat . 
  he didnt expect a coast guard ship to attack refuuge ship i guess , why would he randomly capture a video ? 
  you can see refugees dropping to water , do you think they decided to swim to land ? 
  hes swearing to coast guard ship , really , really heavy in turkish . 
  if it was turkish coast guard , they would stop after swearing . 
  oh , it must be some conspiracy or propaganda against greeks , right . 
  [ rt ] ( https://www.rt.com/news/312594-greece-migrants-boat-sinking/ ) [ telegraph ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/greece/11803114/greek-coast-guard-deliberately-sunk-migrant-boat-in-turkish-waters-fishermans-film-alleges.html ), 
  i dont know either , most likely right-wing people here or greeks trying to hide it . 
  but well , whatever . 
  translation ? 
  because , in video i cant see turkish coast guard ( i mean how can i know it without flag or sideview ) . 
  and the photo they shared is directly from [ here ] ( http://www.sgk.tsk.tr/baskanliklar/harekat/en_platforms/platforms/sar33.asp ) ( i thought it was taken after video ) . 
  [ anoher one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb2emjbinuy ) . 
  i wonder if theres a relation between two ( 1 day difference ) . 
  edit : actually , same day . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ edit ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ 2 : ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ quick , ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ downvote , ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ hide ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ video !, 
  still , its better than nothing . 
  i dont know if / r/europe ever had platform pool or stats , but i do believe pc users with css is majority . 
   to be honest , i do n't think that the default 5 report reasons that reddit gives are really all that useful . 
  you can change them . 
  for example / r/dota2 and / r/globaloffensive has custom report choices . 
  start from here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iraqi_kurdish_civil_war and youll find more relevant links in this post . 
   your leadership made a decision to attack the pkk now ( ... ) a shift in the security situation that makes it easier for erdogan to end your democracy . 
  it does n't seem to be beyond him . 
  lets ignore that pkk attacked first ; after announcing ceasefire is over because turkey is building dams and security stations ( lol , yet they cry about isis passing border freely ) . 
  how convinient that they happen to attack right after ( same day ) isis attacks turkey , and trigger turkey to start operations against pkk ( `` hey , isis attacked turkey , lets use this chance to trigger attacks against us ( pkk ) , turkey-senpai notice us ! '' ) . 
  also , how funny that they announce that ceasefire is over ** after ** hdp gets into parliment , while their reasons for ending ceasefire ( announced ones , dams and security stations ) was a thing even before that . 
  they couldnt wait hdp to ask for whatever they want , for some reason . 
  its like erdogan is leading pkk , all they did was help to erdogan . 
  thanks , pkk / s, 
  relevant rte quote :  you cant be secular and muslim in same time !, 
  youre either muslim or secular !, 
  if they both exist , they will make * reverse magnetism * .
