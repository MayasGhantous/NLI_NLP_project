  from link :  there are over 1.7 million syrian refugees in turkey , more than any other country . 
  ** around 30 percent of these live in 22 government-run camps near the syrian-turkish border . 
  the rest do their best to make ends meet in communities across the country **, 
   \\ #twitterkurds : no way !, 
  it wasnt pkk , it was mit !!, 
  and if you think like this , pkk could instantly stop attacks , announce ceasefire , join ypg fully , help attacks against isis . 
  if not , why pkk is playing to hands of erdogan ? 
  why as soon as is attacks turkey ; same day , they start their attacks too ? 
  pkk confirmed lead by mit / s, 
  silly cyprus , youre not european ^ ^ / s, 
  hes talking about [ this ] ( http://rudaw.net/english/middleeast/turkey/120720151 ) ( 12/07/2015 ) , not [ this ] ( http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/pkk-announces-ceasefire-has-lost-its-meaning-after-turkish-army-airstrikes.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=85952&amp;newscatid=338 ) ( 26/07/2015 ) . 
   do n't spread misinformation and put your sources up after big claims , please . 
   did anyone notice that in that raid which arrested 200 or so ` is militants/supporter ' they also locked up about 100 pkk members well turkish goverment literally said this :  `` the state of the turkish republic is adamant on ** fighting all terrorism without distinction ** as it has always done , be it the terrorist organisation of daesh [ isis ] , the terrorist organisation of the ** pkk ** or any other international terrorist organisation . '' - [ source ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/24/turkish-jets-carry-out-strikes-against-isis-in-syria-reports ), 
  do you think it will be effective against isis , or russia ? 
  because , you know they were using saudi bases ( or aircraft carriers in gulf , i dont know which one exactly ) for a while now but they always insisted to use \u0130ncirlik base , because its close . 
  fyi turkey has 2 big american bases ; one in \u0130zmir one in adana . 
  only place that can be alternative to \u0130ncirlik is cyprus ; uk already has base ( s ) in cyprus . 
  and building new base to be alternatife for \u0130zmir is pointless . 
   point being , intercommunal violence does n't count as a cassus belli if it had ended years ago . 
  well , did i or turkey used it as a casus belli ? 
  breaking the aggrement was enough casus belli anyway . 
   greece and greek cypriots both wanted enosis , a simple referendum ( in line with the right of self-determination ) was denied to them because of turkish paranoia about a greek encirclement . 
  yet they signed agreement , yes ? 
  easy as that , you cant break a aggrement without all sides agree on it . 
   let 's put it this way , if the uk and turkey were n't involved cyprus would 've simply held a referendum and voted on its accession to greece . 
    let 's put it this way , if the ** uk ** and ~ ~ greece ~ ~ werent involved cyprus would be turkish land or independent state . 
     ^ ^ \\ ^ my ^ ^ point ^ ^ is ^ ^ not ^ ^ this , ^ ^ my ^ ^ point ^ ^ is ^ ^ your ^ ^ argument ^ ^ is ^ ^ not ^ ^ a ^ ^ strong ^ ^ one . 
  * they signed agreement * and thats all it matters . 
  well everyone can choose any flair they wish , he could be a greek living in netherlands , and he can write nationalistic things even when he isnt from that nationality ( diaspora propaganda is a thing ) . 
  and no , my response is not `` you misscalculated 3 years '' , my response is a decade for population is like nothing ; hence why i said '' ** yeah , a decade away ** '' without / s tag . 
   from what ? 
  how ? 
    wow , so you mean that if a ** turkey endlessly bullies ^ ^ citation ^ ^ needed ** cyprus into an independence its not like ** greece ** and ** cyprus ** signed the agreement , it was between turkey and uk , right ? 
    a plan that would legitimize an illegal partition resulting ** from ethnic cleansing ** . 
  literally in the first link i give . 
  and this response :   at least the russians did n't perform massive ethnic cleansing , mass rapes , mass imprisonments , mass theft etc. 
   intercommunal violence pretty much ended a decade before the turkish invasion , try again . 
  yeah , ** 1974 ** is a decade away from ** 1967 ** . 
  article covers aftermath too , but who cares ; why read it right ? 
  for rest , i sense a [ nationalistic butthurt ] ( https://i.imgur.com/rlmcgck.png ) so i wont waste my time . 
  yeah , minus the fact [ greek/turkish cypriots killing each other ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cypriot_intercommunal_violence ) for 20 + years , [ greek coup regime trying enosis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/enosis#cyprus ) of a independent country ( which is against [ treaty of guarantee ] ( http://www.mfa.gr/images/docs/kypriako/treaty_of_guarantee.pdf ) ) , and greek side refusing an [ un plan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/annan_plan_for_cyprus ) to stop invasion . 
  yep , pretty much similar . ^ ^ / s, 
  in case youre serious/not sarcastic : `` i < 3 cum . '', 
  on a side note , heres some [ * lokum * ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fxqwkm3ehsc/maxresdefault.jpg ) for you .

   is this realistic ? 
  http://interactive.guim.co.uk/2015/05/turkish-elections/embed/#simulator_simple  akp rigging the elections http://hilelisecim2014.tumblr.com/, 
   you 're not arguing semantics , you 're using semantics to deny it . 
  same thing ? 
   i see nothing in that guardian article coming close to erdogan admitting any turkish wrongdoing . 
  what did you expect ? 
  everyone in turkey knows what armenian deportion means , who did that etc. 
  and as i said , it was just random googling , you can find more that floats your boat . 
   only reason europe is talking so much about it is that erdogan 's a gigantic nationalist pan-turkish prick and we feel like annoying him . 
  only reason world is talking so much about is armenian diaspora lobbying , of course erdogan is helping too . 
  dont forget one of the main things obama promised was recognizing armenian genocide ( he didnt tho , lol ) , even before west started to think erdogan is a dick . 
  fact is , were not denying it either , its semantics we deny . 
  go ahead , ask it to whoever you want . 
  oh , right . 
  the thing is you wont pay any ~ ~ reputations ~ ~ reparations if you accept it or not , ~ ~ because noone asks for it ~ ~ because you dont accept it officially ( according to below comments ) . 
  even if they asked for reparations , it wouldnt hurt belgian economy as it 'd hurt turkish economy . 
  [ and dont forget land claims . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/psodblv.jpg ) turkey accepting a genocide would create a ground for international reparation trials . 
  and thats why armenians want it to be recognized as genocide , nothing more . 
  turkey officially admitted that forced migrations was wrong and caused armenian deads , countless time . 
  just a random googling : http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/23/turkey-erdogan-condolences-armenian-massacre but who cares , massacres doesnt give you right to ask for reparations ( afaik ) , genocide does . 
   leopold just wanted to exploit an ethnic group ... the fact a lot of people died was a side effect . 
  ottomans [ just wanted to prevent rebels ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armenian_national_liberation_movement ) in anatolia so they forced migrations of [ christian armenians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tehcir_law ) ... the fact a lot of people died was a side effect . 
  ultimately the [ technicalities does matter according to un ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnic_cleansing#ethnic_cleansing_vs._genocide ) ( atleast [ when it comes to killing muslims ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnic_cleansing#origins_of_the_term ) ) . 
  turkey does admit that a lot of armenians died because forced migration/ethnic cleansing of area . 
  my body is ready . 
  yes , as far as i can tell . 
  maybe armenians can clean that topic for us .

  ** turkey : ** people scared from radiation affecting [ tea ] ( http://www.cografyaharita.com/haritalarim/4cturkiye-yas-cay-uretim-haritasi.png ) and [ nuts ] ( http://cografya.cografyahocasi.com/haritalar/turkiye-findik-uretim-haritasi.png ) . 
  our science , industry and technology minister [ ( cahit aral ) drank radiated tea to to convince people ] ( http://gunhaber.com.tr/haber_resim/%c3%a7ay_bakan_ic.jpg ) that tea is safe to drink . 
  tea and nuts importation decreased significantly , our goverment distributed free nuts to students . 
  yeah . 
  [ og\u00fcn name comes from `` o g\u00fcn '' , `` that day '' ] ( http://ismininanlamine.com/ogun-isminin-anlami-ne-4919/ '' ) [ samast surname comes from samaso\u011fullar\u0131 \\ ( sons of samas \\ ) , from trabzon . 
  ] ( http://www.haberturk.com/haber/haber/12929-samast-nereden-geliyor ) [ more info ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/samanid_empire ) . 
  its possible hes greek since trabzon ' history . 
  theres also [ this ] ( http://www.yenimesaj.com.tr/?haber,7001440 ) , claiming samast is greek for `` church guard/keeper '' . 
  a greek can confirm or deny it for us ( i think its bullshit tho ) . 
  just basic googling . 
  but it doesnt matter who he is , greek or turkish ; he killed someone for nationalist ideas and hes from turkey . 
  its like theres no difference between civilians and officiers/army , rite, 
  to add , theres hadiths about how a goat ( yeah goat ) ate some quran pages about death by stoning . 
  well i give details ; details always sounds defensive . 
  its not a big deal for random turks , really . 
  and the reason goverment `` denies '' it can be found on any random armenian site or song ( see `` holy mountains '' for example ) . 
  `` gibb clay '' . 
  and also , actually turkey does not `` deny '' anything . 
  turkey just says its not genocide according to definition , since both sides suffered from it . 
  afaik turkey even invited armenian authorities to `` research '' together but they refused it .

  yes , you do have right to call whatever you want to them , nobody cares .
