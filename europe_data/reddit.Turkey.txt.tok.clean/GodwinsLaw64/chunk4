  but greece also enforces ( blackmails ? ), 
  other states and international organizations ( eu/nato/imf / un / ... ) to use fyrom name too . 
  at least pick a `` good '' name to enforce , what the heck is `` former yugoslav republic '' ? 
  would you liked to be called `` former ottoman eyalet of morea/yunanistan/greece '' ? 
  or do you also call other yugoslav states with fyrx name too ? 
  i would find it insulting if i was a macedonian . 
  [ hmm , reminds me of an old thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/turkey/comments/38pn2d/so_i_was_creating_a_historical_and_current_claims/ ), 
  [ :d should i start a link chain ? 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3sik4h/turkish_state_bombarding_its_own_citizens_in/cwxswzu?context=3 ), 
   in understanding , the kurdish/turkish conflict you have to go back and see the root causes . 
  i agree . 
   kurds , turks , greeks , armenians all lived stable in one empire for centuries , then in a couple of decades or so , everything was turned upside down so , do you wan na see root cause for this too ? 
  because its not what you think , im pretty sure . 
  ~ ~ but if you wan na argue that , please continue in mesage ~ ~ so we dont spam this thread with unreleated comment anymore . 
  edit : actually , long story short it was nationalism spreading through france to balkans to rest of empire . 
  tanzimat couldnt stop a snowball effect . 
   demographic reality of the region changed for good leading to the current simmering conflict . 
  that 's my point here . 
  armenian genocide is not the sole cause of this conflict , but it 's definitely a factor . 
  nah , turkish/pkk conflict has nothing to do with demographics changing . 
  kurds rebelled against ottoman empire before demographics changed drasticly . 
  its more about religion and traditions than anything else . 
  you should [ check timeline ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/timeline_of_kurdish_uprisings ) and see yourself . 
  only ararat can be connected to demographics , which is not entirety true , only with a push maybe ( van was majority kurdish even before genocide ) . 
  let me give you some info from my knowledge : pkk conflict has no connections with these rebellions ; rebellions that fueled with kurdish traditions and religion . 
  pkk started as a kurdish marxsist group . 
  they tried to reform kurdish traditions , like early marriage and fgm . 
  but their failture was that they were marxist . 
  coup happened , most of leftist groups destroyed ( killed ) . 
  cold war in a nutshell in front regions ( turkey bordered soviets , as you know ) . 
  pkk was mostly ` ignored ' and considered to be ' 3-5 plunderer ' ( meaning they are no threat to state ) by turkish leaders at time ( 74-87 ) . 
  later , pkk considered bigger threat , [ ohal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ohal ) ( a special emergency status ) announced ... they reacted like how israel reacts hamas ; destroy , burn villages , forced migrations and retarded stuff like that . 
  almost all the things you hear about bad things turks did kurds comes from this era . 
  pkk gets nearly destroyed ( memories are not ) . 
  then akp comes , lifts ohal as soon as they came power , tries to merge turks/kurds under islamism ( kurds are more conservative to turkish counterparts ) , pkk sees a new oportinity , reforms itselfs as kongra-gel , abuses ohal memories , akp doesnt react fast etc. 
  few attempts to peace , now here we are . 
  so long story short , it has nothing to do with armenians . 
   if armenian genocide did n't occur , today 's turkey would be much different . 
  thats / r/althistory 's topic . 
  how do you know that armenians would stay under turkish regime ? 
  soviets claimed turkish armenia even with almost 0 armenians living there , how do you know this wouldnt fire a war between 2 countries supported with soviet rebellions ? 
  nah , i wont argue althistory here , pm me if you want to !, 
  :d  the kurdish situation would be much different . 
  southeastern turkey rather than being a relatively backwards kurdish stronghold , would hold armenians , assyrians , who would change the whole dynamics of that region and of the country . 
  dont let reddit hear that , dont you know , kurds are most secular , feministic , democratic , western friendly people in me !, 
  meh , whatever , im just gon na eat lahmacun with ayran and be happy :d, 
  [ pssh , hes not the first one ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3sik4h/turkish_state_bombarding_its_own_citizens_in/cwxmtab ), 
   but with the genocide , the kurds got stronger . 
  if the christian minority still lived there , kurds would n't be like this , and the situation would be much more calmer . 
  by eliminating the christians , the kurdish pandora box was opened . 
  i agree , but that has nothing to do with this current topic , dont you think so ? 
  its like arguing how spain/portugal colonized and killed locals in south america in a thread related to riots in brazil . 
  or arguing how soviets killed locals with holodomor in ukraine/russia conflict . 
  heck , they make a lot more sense than this , because they at least have ** some ** a connection with countries . 
  but bringing armenian genocide in a current topic about turkey/pkk conflict makes 0 sense . 
  again : * `` so is this thread about `` turkey does something connected with the armenians '' ? 
  '' * --  the critical part of any state is its founding , am i wrong ? 
  no , armenian genocide has nothing to do with founding turkey , not even eastern borders . 
  treaty of kars would be more releated to it , since its about borders and signed by both armenia ( soviet ) and modern turkey ( ankara goverment ) . 
  even then , it has nothing to do with this topic . 
  we arent arguing how turkey founded here , right ? 
  if you wan na be smart about it , talk about dersim rebellion . 
  its both connected to modern turkey and somehow releated to turkey/pkk conflict . 
  but armenian genocide has nothing to do with ** this topic ** , ** nothing ** . 
   err no . 
  the current conflict with the kurds just did n't start yesterday , there are historical parallels and triggers for that , that 's why i brought it up . 
  you do know the main force used in genocide was local kurdish militias , right ? 
  you do notice that today kurdish populated areas are all old armenian or assyrian places , right ? 
  so , kurds were happy and ones the who `` benefited '' from so-called genocide , and turkish state did nothing to `` stop '' them from benefiting . 
  you see where im going ? 
  turkish/kurdish problem has 0 connections with genocide . 
  literally 0 . 
   if the us does something connected with the native americans , you bring up their treatment of those people . 
  so is this thread about `` turkey does something connected with the armenians '' ? 
  huh , i must 've missed that part , please help me . 
   if we were talking about ak party 's rise to power , it would n't be mentioned . 
  believe me , people mention it in every turkey releated thread , no limit with ataturk or akp or turkish state . 
  every . 
  one . 
  just search my post history with toolbox . 
  [ example ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/39l8nj/newlysurfaced_video_footage_corroborates/cs4iol2/?context=1 )  the ottoman empire and the modern turkish state are wholly different , because in the beginning of the 20th century , the remnants of the ottoman government greatly changed the ethnic balance in anatolia and that has had repercussions till today . 
  so , it has nothing to do with critical part of `` modern turkish state '' , okay . 
  even if it did , it what connection that has to this topic , i was actually asking that with my questions . 
  how is it critical part , explain please . 
  modern turkish state isnt even centered around east , its other way around . 
  anyway , even if you think its critical part , is it critical as any colonial nation , lets say usa ? 
  but i never see people mention genocide in ** every usa releated thread that has nothing to do with its history or genocides ** . 
  same with other colonial nations if that matters , do you see anybody mention genocides ? 
  do you mention it ? 
  no , you never mentioned it in any usa releated topic either . 
  but what about `` its critical part of the modern x state '' you say ?
