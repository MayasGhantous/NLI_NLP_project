lol this is a common gig at turkey . 
  every mother does that , it 's like a meme here nothing to sue about . 
  i said mosque because it was once used as a mosque and the architecture remained . 
  also , when wer u when constantinapol was kill i was at home sieging malbor ... no edit : ohh btw u meant the other mosque behind pillar sorry misread that  thanks / u/guckfuchs, 
  not for me, 
  nope !, 
  haghia sophia is well bigger and looks a bit different than your regular mosques . 
  http://imgur.com/a/oaf7l here is the bridge alone !, 
  one of my proudest pictures taken from my lg g3, 
  i heard a lot of syrian doctors plus syria was a developed country compared to other middle east countries before the war . 
  yep . 
  when turkey was so close to defeating pkk they immideatly started a peace process for later to keep the war going . 
  then to use it as probaganda . 
  for erdogan it is gulenists i would say . 
   i do n't know what happened post war , but it 's definitely evident . 
  it 's so weird now to see women my grandmas age not be covered at all , yet their granddaughters wear hijabs or burqas . 
  i even recall stories my parents told me where they would serve pork at their home that the city muslims would eat . 
  yep !, 
  reminded me of someone i met there . 
  this dude was a pretty peaciful kind moderate muslim . 
  i pretty enjoyed his company . 
  then somehow i met her mother . 
  as you said she wasnt wearing a headscarf but , the interesting is she went to pray with us at a mosque . 
  it 's probably because of a cultural thing before the war , even some muslims dont wear headscarves . 
  well at least wear a hijab or something , this looks stupid, 
  i was at bosnia this summer , sarajevo center pretty much looked like non muslim to me . 
  i didnt spot a woman with burqa . 
  and ilidza had a lot of moderate muslims . 
  this explains gollum . 
  this . 
  i hate erdogan and i hate pkk too . 
  also i would personally support a kurdish party that is not under the influence of pkk, 
   the only people who really pay for this mess are the kurds . 
  dont say this then . 
  also turkish troops dont target kurdish civilians . 
  yeah , who cares about the innocent turkish civils pkk killed ? 
  kurds have their rights as other turkish people do . 
  pkk do n't , for reasons . 
  let 's hug greek bro :( i hate seeing random retarded mutlistorey buildings near small apartments too :(, 
  what, 
  looks a lot like trams in mafia 1, 
  just a guick little note . 
  ottomans were enemies of timur . 
  it was just a prank eh . 
  just dont take turkish lira . 
  your efforts will be in vain . 
  yeah amazon have a turkish site for amazon.de, 
  no thats not true at all . 
  just wait . 
  you all mf ` ers be thankful you dont know turkish . 
  nah , when turkish pockets get light . 
  they come into realization . 
  seriously tho one of the biggest reason people support akp is because they improved the economy a lot . 
  \u015e\u015e\u015e\u00d6\u00d6\u00d6\u00d6\u00dc\u00dc\u00dc\u0130\u0130\u0130\u011e\u011e\u011e\u011e\u00c7\u00c7 the ultimate turkish battlecry, 
  there are lots of gulen movement members overseas too . 
  they might make up for it . 
  80 million people btw ( not including syrians , they are like 2-3 million ), 
  yeah it is delicious . 
  why are they using the picture of famous [ napoliten of \u00dclker ] ( https://images2.sanalmarket.com.tr/images/1000/urun//large/07163020_large.jpg ) ? 
  ahh yes , that famous scientist who invented kebab . 
  might be another case of balkans stealing our food ... ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ / s. 
  if only alex jones was italian ... 
  you have gulen people there ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  that teacher is goddamn moron, 
  hah well yeah i must admit turks like me get trigerred pretty easily . 
  i was referencing pkk, 
  but we make best baklava if you claim otherwise fite me irl, 
  no , not really . 
  turkish army only fights against terrorists who happen to be kurds . 
  there are no violence against kurdish civilians . 
  kurds are everywhere in turkey and we get along just fine . 
  ( note that i am an anti akp person , so no shilling here ), 
  * motherfucker *, 
  no it is constantinapole huehueheuheuheu . 
  baklava belongs to greek . 
  hello i am gay , will i get blown up the moment i put my step on the street ? 
  turkey = isis barbarian turks kill kurd edit : dammit people stop with smiley faces . 
  i already got [ triggered ] ( https://img.4plebs.org/boards/pol/image/1424/44/1424441248041.png ), 
  nah :d blood of the martyrs who fought for their country 's freedom . 
  turkish flag does, 
  cancer btfo, 
  - so , european amigo , why did you join the drug business ? 
  - the fucking average temperature man , anything for it . 
  yeah , better than actual criminals ( rapists , murderers ) tbh . 
  see ? 
  that 's the reason some people hate ataturk in turkey ^ ^ ^ ^ / s. 
  c\u00fcneyt ark\u0131n is our national chuck norris . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaykf5sjvqa https://youtu.be/ew6gil7agle?t=73 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnyzqfl15wi i remember many more absurd scenes that i saw on television but couldnt find them . 
  also this cracks me up : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ptd6fjfmws, 
  i 'll file a complaint to the authorities so hopefully they will deport your filthy coffee smelling ass . 
  funny thing is my brain thought they were ladies because of kotwworku until you pointed it out . 
  turkey be like : ohh look blue is winning , guess i am blue then . 
  ok then ban all discussions including the people 's who recognize the genocide . 
  when there is a post about the genocide just lock the comments . 
  you are giving ground to only one side . 
  i 've seen people with decent arguments ( both sides ) . 
  sorry if that has been your experience . 
  you can pop into / r/turkey and discuss with them freely if you want or look at the discussions that took place already . 
  i dont get it . 
  wouldnt it be a good opportunity to disprove the evidence of genocide deniers ?
