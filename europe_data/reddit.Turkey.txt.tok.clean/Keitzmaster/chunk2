  usa applied weapon embargo to turkey which caused turkey to build its own weapon industry . 
  there is no reason to usa to help turkey . 
  also turkey didnt gave a f to un and eu . 
  greece could do the same i guess . 
  i dont know the navy , air force numbers in that time . 
  but i guess turkey was atleast 5x + more soldiers and even numbers in navy and airforce . 
  there was no way turkey can lose in a full-war situation without any other countrys intervention . 
  on july 22 , turkey was sucessful we got % 3 of territory . 
  we did n't fail . 
   the turkish war of independence is the only war we 've ever lost in our modern history . 
  no it was n't ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greco-turkish_war_ ( 1897 ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_invasion_of_cyprus also in first balkan war , ottomans were n't fighting only versus greeks . 
  ottomans were fighting against bulgaria ( 350k + ) , serbia ( 230k ) , greece ( 125k ) , montenegro ( 44k ) . 
  greece army was worse than ottoman army i think . 
  also while in turkish indepence war , turkey didnt have any ally troops in his side either . 
  not meant to be underestimate greece army . 
  just stating facts . 
  not losing any war in modern history is not a parameter . 
  it doesnt define any military strenght . 
  for example usa lost 2 wars in modern history . 
  im from turkey and in schoolcourses ( dershane - students go to these after school to study more ) owned by gulen a girl and a boy couldnt sit together . 
  they are definitely not secular . 
  + first , kurds ! = pkk + we tried to make peace then all of sudden they killed 2 polices and 1 days later they killed our soldier , ended ceasefire ( second one ) . 
  and you are blaming turkey for this . 
  also tell me why we should try to make peace with those pigs instead killing them ????? 
  + first ceasefire was unilateral , pkk declared it . 
  then they started attacking again . 
  it has nothing to do with turkey . 
  + if we give autonomy or land , terrorists win . 
  what you are saying doesnt make any sense . 
  if we ever give autonomy to them , pkk terrorists would say `` turkey lost hahahahahha '' etc. 
  it would be disgrace . 
  its like usa giving al-qaeda what they want . 
  + kurds have same rights as turks now . 
  + the kurdish party you are talking about are supporting pkk . 
  they should be closed . 
  its so obvious they are supporting pkk . 
  they are like political wing of pkk .

  they are terrorist organisation . 
  by your logic , if isis changes its ideology and stops killing civilians will they became non-terrorist organization ? 
  + also pkk did n't stopped killing civilians . 
  they still kill civilians . 
  for you its `` accidential '' ... + tak and pkk are same . 
  they are just changing names to make people believe their `` pkk only targets military '' bullshit propaganda . 
  and looks like its working . 
  you believe that bullshit propaganda . 
  http://www.pkkeylemleri.com/ you can read the english articles at the bottom of the page . 
  http://www.yenisafak.com/en/news/nearly-7000-civilians-killed-by-pkk-in-31-years-2237092 pkk just targets military now because of their propaganda . 
  if they want to blow up civilians they do it under name `` tak '' . 
  they are same terrorists actually . 
  u can see a list of pkk 's crimes in this thread : ( with their proofs attached ) ( not even % 1 of their all crimes ) https://www.reddit.com/r/terrorist_pkk/comments/4u8k5k/crimes_of_pkk_terrorist_organization/?st=it7ft8jn&amp;sh=b6df75a0 there is literally tons of proof in turkish . 
  pkk killed thousands of civilians . 
  thats a fact . 
  we wont give terrorists what they want . 
  stop defending terrorists . 
  ruling balkan for 300 years then finally kicked out counts as loss ? 
  nice logic there . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_war_of_independence turkey winning against greece , france , italy , uk , armenia doesnt count real war ? 
  lol, 
  kurds \u2260 pkk stop this bullshit propaganda, 
  ofcourse they will refuse .

  before someone says its purge . 
  its not a purge . 
  these mayors ( hdp - pro pkk party ) were helping pkk . 
  pkk made these cities `` warzones '' . 
  planted mines in roads , set barricades everywhere , used state 's vehicles to ditch . 
  ( ofc pro-hdp ( pkks party ) was municipality here ) used civilis as shield . 
  hided in buildings . 
  pkk caused the harm in the city .
