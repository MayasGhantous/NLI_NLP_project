what turkish government has recently done to kurds ? 
  i have a hard time explaining this to people who think pkk are idealistic freedom fighters . 
  i mean , how burning villages and killing innocent people is supposed to further their cause ? 
  of course , it 's always the big bad turk who is responsible for everything . 
  actually , they killed each other . 
   five of the deaths were blamed on clashes between kurdish activists and supporters of the huda-par kurdish sunni islamist group which is sympathetic to is [ source ] ( http://www.france24.com/en/20141008-turkey-imposes-curfew-after-18-killed-pro-kurdish-protests/?aef_campaign_date=2014-10-08&amp;aef_campaign_ref=partage_aef&amp;ns_campaign=reseaux_sociaux&amp;ns_linkname=editorial&amp;ns_mchannel=social&amp;ns_source=twitter ) cops killed too of course . 
  but not as much as they did to each other . 
  turkish cops seem to be out of form . 
  as a veteran gezi protestor we will not give that privilege to them anyway . 
  nothing like starting the day with a gas canister headshot . 
  i have sympathy for kobane but i do n't really understand how rioting and burning ambulances is going to convince turkey to help them out . 
  or france for that matter . 
  a group also exploded bomb in taksim . 
  will shedding blood in turkey convince us to help them ? 
  akp is n't going to help them no matter what . 
  kurds are just seeing how two faced he is . 
  i read from a foreign source that hudapar and other kurds fought against each other . 
  does n't make much sense for me either . 
  this is a comparison , not an analysis . 
  i was talking about the death : / a long one is preferred in that case . 
  i have to fill the tank with beer before going to the graveyard . 
  ours is named recep tayyip erdo\u011fan , a man whom i will piss on his grave when he is finally dead . 
  a painful and long one is preferred . 
  neutral news source ? 
  what 's that ? 
  that 's alien to my culture . 
  i currently live in germany ( do n't panic , i 'm gon na return to turkey eventually ) , and i got ta say , turkish-german people are * really * conservative when compared to turkey . 
  i mean it 's like since they came from turkey some decades ago , and they stayed in that year and never tried to make progress and learn new stuff . 
  i do n't know why it 's like this . 
  it 's just my personal opinion but even my german ( language , not nationality ) teacher who came from turkey herself toyed with this idea . 
  maybe it 's because the immigrants usually came from poor villages trying to restart their life or provide money to their poor families or something . 
  also , i find it funny how most of them support erdo\u011fan and talk about how he strengthened the economy and ( bull ) shit even though they do n't wan na return to turkey . 
  i say try to educate them rather than complaining about them but i can guess how difficult that might be . 
  this is what erdo\u011fan does , he polarizes people . 
  leaving his own nation at each others ' throats did n't satisfy him , i guess . 
  damn , imagine this guy being the sole leader of nato or eu or something . 
  there will be a lot of people peeing on his grave , he should think about getting a toilet placed right in front of his fucking tombstone . 
  everyone in europe and asia . 
  but most notably greece . 
  we get along now . 
  both countries have too much shit on their hands to care about each other . 
  hate between individuals mostly stays on the level of 15 year old teens swearing at each other with broken english in youtube . 
  people mostly think we still hate each other or something . 
  there is at least one guy who brings up eu in every thread about turkey .

  thank you . 
  you may think turkey 's ascension process only started like one or two decades ago , and it is still relevant to turkey and there is still a chance . 
  but you are wrong . 
  the ascension process of turkey has been there since the foundation of eu . 
  no wait , it has been talked about since the dawn of time . 
  god created adam , eve , and turkey 's ascension process . 
  turkey 's ascension is the alpha and the omega -- the beginning and the end . 
  it is known . 
  ascension , ascension never changes . 
  ascension is coming . 
  i used to be an optimist like you , then i took an ascension in the knee . 
  in protests only . 
  but cops go out of their way to define what `` protesting '' means . 
  i have seen them spray water on people who are passing by any has nothing to with any crowd . 
   i do n't quite see where else they can go but a democratic european union . 
  lol no . 
  i think many turks feel butthurt over eu 's rejection , in turn politicans use more anti-west rhetoric and push this proud `` ottoman '' identity on people . 
  `` european '' identity did n't stick . 
  it was all the craze some days . 
  i remember a turkish tv series taking place in an alternate future where turkey joins eu . 
  i think there is some kind of an inferiority complex that built up as a result of rejection and people are nostalgic about the times their nation was respected and feared . 
  nobody really wants to join eu anymore . 
  i think latest poll ( in 2012 ) only 17 % of the population supported joining ( as opposed to around % 70 a decade ago ) . 
  those who want to join mostly want it for free travel . 
  only 94 % of turks ever had a vacation outside of turkey and that limits our perspective . 
  people compare the laws in turkey with europe whenever there is a new law being discussed and it 's completely bullshit/out-of-context/irrelevant most of the time . 
  this is n't eu 's fault , as turkey joining eu was already impossible to start with . 
  they did the right thing by giving such an illusion and keeping turkey close to them . 
  us has more to do with it since they supported erdo\u011fan when he was nothing . 
  erdo\u011fan went to white palace when he was n't even elected yet , when he had no title . 
  us was also very active in turkey during coup times , and they fucked many things up to crush communists . 
  i think turkey will turn north , to russia . 
  they will try to juggle relationships as long as they can though . 
  that will be fethullah g\u00fclen living in pennsylvania . 
  another islamist to fuck this country up . 
  here is the thing . 
  [ some company makes a political poll . ] ( http://secimanketi.tv/galeri/gezici_arastirma_sirketi_nden_cok_surpriz_sonuclar-9 ) . 
  `` if elections took place today , whom would you vote for ? '', 
  40 % say akp . 
  `` do you think turkey should go with the state system or do n't change it ? '', 
  18 % says should change it . 
  `` do you approve turkey 's policy regarding syria ? '', 
  only 29 % says yes . 
  `` do you think the government is successful with war on terror ? '', 
  30 % say yes . 
  `` do you think presidency system would create a one-man system , dictatorship , and authoritarianism ? '', 
  only 24 % says no it would n't . 
  `` do you think turkey should switch to presidency system ? '', 
  21 % says yes . 
  `` do you think the government can solve the kurdish problem ? '', 
  20 % say yes , 24 % say maybe . 
  it 's like akp voters do n't approve anything akp does but vote for them nonetheless . 
  because the other option is infidel chp . 
  by the way , the company who did that poll was raided by cops . 
  probably a big election fraud is coming and they want to keep polls silent .
