  ideals of isis will always be left over . 
  there are always groups that 's getting supplies from countries fighting proxy wars around the world . 
  when isis gets destroyed , another one will take its ' place . 
  what usa supported against soviets turned into al-qaeda later . 
  now we have new devils and new angels to destroy or arm . 
  this will go on until oil runs dry or something . 
  at least africa is free to fuck itself up all by itself . 
  i bet lots of foreigners are masturbating to these news . 
  also lovely coincidence that isis starts to attack as soon as pkk-turkey ceasefire breaks down . 
  turks tend to be lighter skinned than what is expected . 
  also after all the people seeking refugee in turkey during the collapse of ottoman empire and removal of kebab in the balkans , a lot of lighter skinned people moved in there and contributed to the gene pool . 
  there is n't really a stereotypical turkish look because of the diverse gene pool . 
  racism in turkey focuses more on identity than genetics as a result . 
  if someone says he is turkish , then that 's what he is . 
  we are n't culturally similar with arabs at all and even if we were , that does n't mean we can take 2m with a shrug . 
  let 's see hungary take 2m bulgarian refugees . 
  i 'd rather see ukrainian refugees here instead . 
  i can make fun of the situation because of the laughable comparison between 2m and 60k . 
  it 's 60k in one year and you guys call it invasion . 
  what should we call it ? 
  give us the 60k . 
  we wo n't feel the difference lol . 
  i ca n't really feel your pain when your politicians make retarded comments like this . 
  call it a problem . 
  but invasion ? 
  wtf ? 
  i 'll see what you call it when your refugee numbers reach 2m . 
  we are bad when we do n't take refugees , and we are bad again when we take refugees because some of them slip to europe . 
  also , inb4 `` turkish victim mentality '', 
  invasion ? 
  did another a few hundred immigrants invade hungrian cities again ? 
  lol eurabia when ? 
  we are n't victims . 
  every nation in europe were our victims at least once though and some still are . 
  those were the days . 
   yeah , you 're right . 
  at least the russians did n't perform massive ethnic cleansing , mass rapes , mass imprisonments , mass theft etc. 
  at least the russian annexation had the flimsiest of democratic trappings . 
  we are literally putin now . 
  what can i say ? 
  a turk needs a good ol' pillage loot and rape sometimes . 
  from what i can see , more popular a sub becomes , more it looks like that shithole / r/worldnews . 
  especially for political subs like subs about countries and regions . 
  ignorant people making unfunny comments without reading the link , and so on . 
  and lots of very unfunny comments . 
  we might as well do it in / r/worldnews . 
  a case of `` every party is shit , so let 's find the one that smells the least shitty '' is how i see it . 
  i can sympathize . 
  my neck thanks you . 
  like just a few thousand immigrants and it 's `` immigrants flooding a city '' ? 
  gim me a break . 
  take one or two millions of refugees in and then i 'll see you . 
  ` cuz yurop is not ` murica . 
  [ comma master race . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/decimalseparator.svg/300px-decimalseparator.svg.png ) ^ ^ can ^ ^ we ^ ^ into ^ ^ yurop ^ ^ now ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ probably ^ ^ ^ ^ africa ^ ^ ^ ^ will ^ ^ ^ ^ get ^ ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ ^ earlier ^ ^ ^ ^ tho, 
  meh , that kinda stuff probably happens every day with refugee ships invading eu nowadays . 
  singling out individual sad stories is really low . 
   `` when you stand in front of me and you are a very nice person , but you know in palestinian refugee camps in lebanon there are thousands and thousands ( of people ) and if we say you can all come and you can all come from africa and you can all come . 
  we ca n't manage that . '', 
  this sounds solid to me . 
  what was she supposed to do ? 
  make anyone a german citizen who manages to get enough tears out of people ? 
  we need people like you here to talk to kurdish separatists :3, 
  would vote as president of earth when aliens attack . 
  this makes me remember the time when some erasmus students were detained by the cops for protesting during gezi protests in turkey . 
  i blame evil foreign powers that may be . 
  he is armenian actually . ^ ^ ^ recognise !, 
  the guy who posted this link always posts anti-turkey stuff . 
  this would go unnoticed if he did n't pick this one up . 
  he does nothing but post stuff like this . 
  maybe try to export some peace to us and greeks then ? 
  ( but primarily on greeks ) :3 what you are saying is like getting angry at mexico for drug cartels and stuff , or cuba because of communism . 
  that 's just the way things have always been . 
  ca n't a bro invade his bro 's air space from time to time ? 
  also it 's good propaganda . 
  evil greeks invading our personal space and sitting right next to us on benches when there are like 10 empty ones and stuff !, 
  aww . 
  good times . 
  the sub which must not be named . 
  lol no . 
  youtube is filled with butthurt turkish and greece nationalists waging a holy war against each other . 
  it was probably a dumb guy like that . 
  i guess the cat is out of the bag . 
  i told about this to erdo\u011fan and he was all like `` more countries for me to fuck up , go ahead '' so i became the head of this project . 
  i sent greeks our ottoman empire v2 .0 ( but with less blood and more hookers and drugs ) offer and all i got as a reply was [ this message ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bjsuafto7y ) . 
  i still have hope . 
  now i 'm gon na tell erdo\u011fan that we should threaten greece so they 'll spend more money on military . 
  eventually we can buy out their country . 
  first order of business after grecottoman empire is founded is locking all golden dawn and \u00dclk\u00fcc\u00fc people into an arena and dropping machetes on the ground for them to culturally interact with each other . 
  after that , we 'll recruit s\u00fcleiman fans in balkans as our agents so they can convert people to our side , after they accept us as their overlords , we 'll peacefully annex them . 
  i have been saving diplomatic monarch points just for this . 
  i have plans for rest of the europe too . 
  just need to dump more turkish and greek workers in germany first . 
  muh taxpayer money !, 
  hundreds of thousands of refugees are free to roam around turkey anyway . 
  no country can build enough camps to put them all in one place . 
  just giving a city to all these 2m of people would be easier . 
   for me erasmus = some people who only post pictures of parties and drinking on facebook during their exchange , and now a year after doing it are still posting pictures of drinking and telling everyone about `` the erasmus spirit '' . 
  ugh , i hated that .
