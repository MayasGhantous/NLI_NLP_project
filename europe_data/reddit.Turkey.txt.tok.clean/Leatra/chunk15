  what 's the standard in europe ? 
  all islamists will eventually end up like erdo\u011fan . 
  that 's the essence of political islamism . 
  that 's why secularism is important . 
  i 'd rather have the nationalists rule the country in a coalition with chp though . 
  that sounds complicated . 
  we just kiss everyone twice . 
  selfish idiots . 
  they want the party who adopt their mentality to run a country they visit like once a year . 
  but i 'd expect all guest worker country to be heavily akp . 
  1.1 million according to the same website . 
  immigrants in germany , austria , etc come from poor regions in southeastern and eastern turkey . 
  conservative , uneducated , and religious . 
  they were poor and needed the high-paying but low-class jobs offered by them . 
  so those countries got the worst kind of immigrants . 
  spain was n't exactly a hotspot for immigrants for find work , so that would be my reasoning about why there is n't many akp voters there . 
  most of the immigrants who went to usa went there for education . 
  they also mostly come from western regions of turkey . 
  usa is also selective about who they take in . 
  about british turks , [ a british turk explains it ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/38zodo/turkeys_ruling_party_loses_majority_in_election/crzbps0 ), 
  yes . 
  but they only want autonomy for now . 
  heh , i wish they actually lived through the regime of the party they are supporting , rather than visiting turkey during summers and going `` oh 1 euro makes 3 liras eh ? 
  i 'm rich !, 
  turkey economy stronk ! '', 
  seems like germany , austria , netherlands and france got our worst lol . 
  even in ireland akp got only 20 % [ source ] ( http://secim.aa.com.tr/yurtdisieng.html ) . 
  spain only gave 6 % to akp which is interesting . 
  [ this is also a good link with cool visuals ( by a pro-government website but whatever ) ] ( http://secim.aa.com.tr/yurtdisieng.html ) to see voting percentages of turkish citizen immigrants across the world . 
  it 's in english . 
  europe seems to be pro-akp and america seems to be pro-chp . 
  [ this is also a good link with cool visuals ( by a pro-government website but whatever ) ] ( http://secim.aa.com.tr/yurtdisieng.html ) to see voting percentages of turkish citizen immigrants across the world . 
  it 's in english . 
  netherlands got % 64.23 according to it . 
  they did . 
  despite all the fraud , they could n't manage to tip elections strongly enough . 
  this election had lots of observers and ngos watching things . 
  hdp is n't anti-nationalistic . 
  they are kurdish nationalist . 
  basically every party in turkey has some dose of nationalism . 
  around 4 % of the votes they got in this election is from chp voters . 
  a lot of people strategically voted for hdp even though they would rather vote for another party . 
  greeks just obliterated you after that comment lol . 
  mhp is a strange party . 
  they are n't golden dawn level of nationalism but nationalism is still their strongest factor . 
  [ it was asked again in megathread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/38w5yu/megathread_turkish_general_election/cryvl4j ) and i think the answer is accurate . 
  chp will have to be mediator between mhp and hdp . 
  chp is more likely to make a deal with hdp . 
  they try to stay cool-headed and go for leftist policies with a small dose of nationalism . 
  around 4 % of the votes hdp got is tactical . 
  it 's not impossible to win a war against any military by using external help , propaganda and guerrilla tactics . 
  hdp and mhp representatives tend to go * nudge nudge wink wink * during their statements about how everyone should have akp as their common enemy . 
  if hdp does n't decide to shit all over turks who voted for them and ally with akp ( which is like alienating % 4 of the votes they got ) , they 'll have to silently support a chp+mhp coalition . 
  mhp is definitely not worse than akp . 
  mhp is just incredibly passive . 
  if mhp allies with akp , they 'll probably go below the threshold in the next elections . 
  muslims do n't really differentiate wine from other alcoholic beverages on the how-much-should-i-expect-to-burn-in-hell-for-this ? 
  scale . 
  if a muslim considers alcohol as bad , then all alcohol is bad for him/her . 
  most turkish muslims just ignore the parts they do n't like about islam lol . 
  so drinking can commence !, 
  interestingly , we had less fraud happening this time when compared to the elections last year . 
  some fights , attacks on swedish observers , suspicious cars without licensed plates and black sacks in their trunks but nothing too extreme . 
  cheers !, 
  waiting for erdo\u011fan 's traditional balcony speech to drink to erdo\u011fan :3, 
  people exaggerate mhp . 
  i feel like drinking to celebrate . 
  although i also drink when akp wins so i 'm probably looking for excuses to drink . 
  akp wins : i need a fucking drink . 
  akp loses : i need to drink to celebrate !, 
  chp + mhp is more likely . 
  hdp needs to play ball and not form a coalition with akp though . 
  any party that forms a coalition with akp can say buh-bye to their political career though lol . 
  they 'll never manage to pass % 10 threshold ever again . 
  mph will probably break off into two parties if that happened . 
  i do n't know . 
  i do n't know why some people are so anti-chp . 
  chp leader k\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu showed silent support towards hdp and said they are n't going to criticize hdp because `` they should be in the parliament '' . 
  i think that deserves some praise . 
  around 4 % of chp probably switched to hdp to get them to pass the threshold . 
  i hope hdp wo n't shit on those lent votes . 
  time to inhale cocaine from hookers ' belly buttons then !, 
  ] ( http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/923/887/2f4.jpg ), 
  if hdp does n't form a coalition with akp , yes . 
  unstable political situation . 
  i lived in germany for a year and stuff that makes you go `` wow , this is important '' happens at germany once every one month , happens everyday in turkey . 
  we go through lots of shit every day and there is so much happening . 
  it affects the average citizen 's life more , be it a man fighting starvation and poverty or a white-collar middle-high class who spends his time in offices and bars . 
  this situation politicizes the apoliticals . 
  that 's pretty usual stuff to be honest . 
  every opposition leader said they would n't form a coalition with akp , including mhp . 
  now we 'll see who will hold their word . 
  further away from touristy areas and more to the east you go , more conservative , uneducated , religious and redneck-ish the people get . 
  i would n't be surprised if you had unpleasant experiences there . 
  there is a reason why western coasts is also popular for domestic tourism . 
  despite this ( [ and all other fraud reports flooding in ] ( http://haber.sol.org.tr/turkiye/oy-verme-islemi-akpnin-hileleriyle-basladi-118882 ) ) , actually akp did n't achieve victory . 
  i 'm really surprised . 
  / r/turkey is throwing a party :3, 
  [ this comment explains how turks see their national heroes as nicely ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/turkey/comments/38kphn/good_propaganda_to_damage_islamist_efforts_to/crvwkyw )  almost all leaders of turkey and the ottoman empire are revered depending on one 's political background , for example , atat\u00fcrk by secularists and nationalists , leaders like menderes or erbakan and the ottomans ( definitely not only religious conservative people but especially ) by religious conservative/islamist people like erdo\u011fan . 
  you can also check the other comments in that thread for several opinions about what turks think of atat\u00fcrk .
