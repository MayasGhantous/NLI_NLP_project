  that law is only applied when it benefits someone at the top ... like all laws . 
  that 's how they banned youtube at the first time but nowadays they do n't really require an excuse to ban websites . 
  i hope we will get rid of that law one day ... 
  southeastern and eastern turkey , helping your country with low population , low workforce problems and culinary tastes since 1923 !, 
  w\u00f6rk w\u00f6rk w\u00f6rk w\u00f6rk ( that 's ^ my ^ laughing ^ voice ),

   how do these religious people reconcile their support for non-secular views with the admiration towards mustafa kemal ? 
  admiration towards mustafa kemal ? 
  akp voters hate him . 
  most ultra-religious people ( except mhp voters ) hate him . 
  they have zero admiration for him . 
  erdo\u011fan himself called atat\u00fcrk a drunkard . 
  turkey 's downhill from secularism is n't solely on akp . 
  implementation of secularism did n't stick . 
  religious people were marginalized and akp knew this so they abused it . 
  nowadays akp still milks those days . 
  nowadays , religious people are afraid of what may happen if akp falls . 
  akp demonized chp and people think chp is literally satan or something , so they vote for akp out of fear . 
  people think it will be back to coup times if akp falls . 
  a few days back in a chp rally , a citizen asked chp 's leader to recite [ kelime-i \u015fahadet ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shahada ) and he seemed convinced after chp 's leader said the words without mistake and the guy said `` okay , now i 'm sure of you . 
  i will vote for you '', 
  autonomous region . 
  yeah , turks in usa tend to be more open-minded and vote for chp instead . 
  turks who went to usa did it for education and decided to stay there , while turks in europe left turkey for w\u00f6rk w\u00f6rk w\u00f6rk and ( ger ) money since they were poor . 
  europe got the worst of migrants . 
  [ turkey was still portrayed as a great democratic pro-us country a few years back .

  i hope `` voting in your home country that you visit only during summer '' thing will be no more one day . 
  we have enough idiots to deal with here . 
  not sure how exit polls work , but people can track the results from the internet as the counting begins . 
  but it 's unreliable since in the last election you could actually witness as number of votes chp got decreased in some regions . 
   election itself is generally considered fair . 
  lol, 
  vehicles without license plates are cruising around and a citizen got the answer `` it 's beyond you '' as an answer from a cop after reporting it . 
  [ turkish link ] ( https://twitter.com/muratkaplansb/status/607513285320007681 ) . 
  i have also seen those cars . 
  [ some other reports of fraud ] ( http://haber.sol.org.tr/turkiye/oy-verme-islemi-akpnin-hileleriyle-basladi-118882 ) so not really . 
  [ photos of those cars ] ( https://twitter.com/aykuterdogdu/status/607518347312414720 ) cops have a right to vote wherever they want and some people say it 's very open to abuse . 
  edit : http://www.etha.com.tr/haber/2015/06/07/guncel/plakasizlarin-sirri-bagajda-oy-bulundu/ same thing happened in a grade school at sultangazi . 
  two cars without license plates were seen parked at the school garden . 
  a cop claimed it was a police car . 
  hdp sultangazi province co-leader herdem sara asked him why it did n't have a license plate and managed to bother him long enough for the cop to place back the plate anyway . 
  afterwards , another car without a license plate was spotted as someone picked up a black sack from its ' trunk and carried it inside the building . 
  sara asked what was inside . 
  the same black sack thing was also reported in the garden of atat\u00fcrk grade school . 
  lawyers have a written record of what happened . 
  gg wp akp % 50 lol edit 2 : the guy driving those unlicensed cars is caught . 
  [ here ] ( https://twitter.com/irmak_ye/status/607555501090570240 ) is his photo edit 3 : [ akp mp candidate attacks ballot officials ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/turkey/comments/38wgs5/akpli_adaydan_sand%c4%b1k_g%c3%b6revlilerine_sald%c4%b1r%c4%b1/ ) . 
  article is turkish but there is a video . 
  [ fraud has already started , so not at all really . 
  that expression . 
  `` tryin ' to catch me playin ' dirty . '', 
  that 's the reaction they were aiming for . 
  they did n't expect balkan muslims to go suicide bombing . 
  polarization and sowing distrust is always a good method . 
  and hey , it may turn moderates into extremists too . 
  it was a time period in usa when `` communism '' meant `` something we do n't like '' but yeah that 's just laughable . 
  rich ones go to central and western europe . 
  poor ones stop in turkey/greece/whatever . 
  this response satisfies me . 
  who moderates the mod of moderators ? 
  the guy is a mod of 135 subs . 
  i do n't know what they were thinking . 
  how can someone be `` aggressively in denial '' lol ? 
   she is likely parroting the same racist anti-armenian nonsense in regards to the genocide that the turkish government spews she lives in belgium . 
  i do n't think she follows akp 's propaganda . 
  it 's not that simple . 
  not all muslims are identical . 
  haha do n't say that . 
  people naturally think of the obvious one when they see `` s\u00fcleiman '' . 
  but it 's a very common name even today . 
  in my opinion , muslim circlejerking is not an enough reason to take in immigrants . 
  nobody wants to deal with this . 
  turkey also took in 2m syrian refugees but some of them have caused enough trouble by now for people to act racist towards all of them . 
  that 's not an ironic statement at all . 
  edit : `` people got angry at me , that means i was right '', 
  [ that was an another s\u00fcleiman though ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suleyman_shah ) . 
  it was the father of the founder of ottoman empire . 
  s\u00fcleiman the magnificent 's tomb is in \u0130stanbul .

  damn jews trying to stop turkey from becoming a galactic power / s, 
  we do n't like nicknames like that in this town bud . 
  turkey is a muslim country and it 's just too big to join eu . 
  but i agree that the things eu asks should already be what countries are doing anyway . 
  i think joining eu is simply impossible for turkey even if we get rid of this government and we are better off chasing more realistic ambitions . 
  well , even the secular young folks do n't care about eu beyond the `` eu means free travel fuck yeah '' benefit . 
  i 'm telling you the reason why people do n't care about eu anymore . 
  when did it become `` condescending attitude of eu countries is the reason why people favor neo-ottomanism , isolationism , and paranoia towards other countries more '' ? 
  i should have written those two sentences as two separate comments or something . 
  fuck it you can think whatever you want . 
  i 'm tired of trying to solve misunderstandings . 
  it 's stupid that a nation is turning its ' back on an important union on the basis of `` they all hate us '' but i guess we have bigger problems . 
  where the fuck did i say that . 
  geez , people . 
  i 'm criticizing my own nation 's `` some people hate us so let 's hate everyone '' mentality . 
  did i say that ? 
  aww , we ca n't join the cool kids ' club :( condescending attitude of eu countries is the reason why most turks do n't care about it . 
  sadly this means people favor neo-ottomanism , isolationism , and paranoia towards other countries more .
