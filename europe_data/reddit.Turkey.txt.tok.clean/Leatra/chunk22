  does it depend on race now ? 
  the deleted comments in here is much more interesting . 
  cringeworthy indeed . 
  sacredness of hospitality is common in all muslim countries . 
  which nation 's flag this fool had as a flair before it got deleted ? 
  probably turkish but i 'm curious . 
  i do n't care about his nickname . 
  arbitrary lines ? 
  you just drew them by limiting the rule to two genocides . 
  what about algeria ? 
  native americans ? 
  ottomans in the balkans ? 
  what about evidence for those ? 
  it just seems like `` rules for the sake of rules '' and what do you think `` denying genocide '' means ? 
  a simple `` it did n't happen '' ? 
  not even neo-nazis say that . 
  they just make shitton of excuses . 
  is that allowed ? 
  you ca n't create a rule for every scenario . 
  yeah i get it . 
  political correctness and shit . 
  but at least the rule should be just . 
  her hair can be seen . 
  that directly goes against the purpose of wearing that cloth . 
  i hope it wo n't be a simple election result or a painless death that ends his era . 
  let 's shoot arrows on horsebacks and shit . 
  tengri give me strength !, 
  you are n't going to hear about this stuff in western media . 
  [ take a look at this list of attacks and conflicts ] ( http://tr.wikipedia.org/wiki/pkk_sald%c4%b1r%c4%b1lar%c4%b1_ve_%c3%a7at%c4%b1%c5%9fmalar%c4%b1_kronolojisi_%282010%27lar%29 ) . 
  google translate sucks with turkish so good luck with that . 
  all media is biased . 
  folks like you are like robots who think they have free will . 
  they got you thinking pkk abandoned terrorist tactics so there is that . 
   has pkk claimed responsibility for this ? 
  terrorist organizations who want to keep a good rep in europe are not known for claiming responsibility for dead children and civilians . 
   is this state-terrorism ? 
  i do n't know . 
  did turkey claim responsibility for it ? 
  the sources are mostly from the west . 
   they have also renounced and abanadoned terrorist tactics in turkey and abroad they have ? 
  that 's what your unbiased media sources are telling you ? 
  why they continue doing them then ? 
  [ in 2014 , they killed a 76 old man named mustafa bingol for informing cops about pkk . ] ( http://www.pkkeylemleri.com/2014-katliami-76-yasindaki-mustafa-bingol-pkk-tarafindan-kursuna-dizildi/ ) . 
  oh how peaceful secularist and feminist freedom fighters they are . 
  i love folks like you who think they got everything figured out . 
  well , he 's dead now . 
  that was quick . 
   what i meant to say is that whether an organization is terrorist or freedom fighters depends on context and outcome of its struggle no . 
  people name armed organizations as terrorists or freedom fighters solely based on their ideology , which nationality they are killing , and which nationality the organization is composed of . 
  that 's how it always been . 
  this is turkey . 
  every kind of fuck-up is possible . 
  dhkp-c ( the people who are doing this ) are stupid as much as akp . 
  they think suicide bombing will save `` the people '' from `` the oppression '' and whatever . 
  they are playing unto akp 's hand . 
  i love the jargon they use though . 
  turns out ottoman was stronk because of the genius of a man from a pesky heretic country . 
  turk ca n't into artillery . 
  urban is a nice nickname btw . 
  for downgrading the glorious kebab power to luck . 
  butts full of hurt are invading with downvotes . 
  if you guys think i 'm being serious , apply [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/butthurt_ointment.png ) to the affected area . 
  practicing before the elections . 
  1453 best day of my life, 
   ottomans only gained entry to the balkans thanks to a huge earthquake nice excuse bro . 
  we have low standards . 
  the standards i consider while voting in turkey boils down to `` excluding akp , had the biggest vote percentage in the last elections '', 
   there are far more muslims than buddhists in turkey , and probably as well at that uni  this has become a fight against a certain political agenda and not for a buddhist temple thank you captain obvious . 
   no need to be all anti-islamic ( or as they call it in turkey , atat\u00fcrkc\u00fc ) atat\u00fcrk\u00e7\u00fc does n't mean anti-islamic . 
  but akp ass lickers love to associate atat\u00fcrk with anti-islamism . 
  this what akp supporters think the other governments and coups did . 
  a lot of people vote for akp because they think the opposition will ban islam and kill muslims in the name of glorious secularism or whatever . 
  this guy is probably a turk from germany who has no idea how things work in turkey . 
  their minds are stuck in the 20th century . 
  i , for one , welcome our new byzantine overlords . 
  as a buddhist , no government can take my right to go to a buddhist temple in turkey and do buddhist stuff !, 
  like wearing robes and stuff . 
  [ 14.499 supporters and counting ] ( https://www.change.org/p/rektor-itu-edu-tr-it%c3%bc-ye-budist-tap%c4%b1na%c4%9f%c4%b1-istiyoruz )  our rector has stated that the mosque was being built in response to sufficient demand , and that he will do everything as long as there is demand . 
  rightful demands from my buddhist brothers and sisters :  i ca n't practice my religion , the closest buddhist temple is 2000 km away so i ca n't go during lunch breaks . 
  -  i also want a satanic temple . 
  -  for freedom of religion , all temples should be built . 
  for example , when i 'm playing civ 4 i choose free religion and make sure all temples are built and happiness skyrockets . 
  -  if we want our country to be a world leader in terms of science and education , we should build religious buildings across all of our universities . 
  yes , you heard it right . 
  laboratory ? 
  library ? 
  buddhist temples are the only solution . 
  buddhists wake up !, 
  -  i ca n't practice my religion in this country , my monk friends ca n't even enter the university . 
   they enjoy american fashion , movies and music , but they have no concept of the american government . 
  they are happy consumers , exited by action movies , flashy clothing and cool-looking army tanks , the perfect society every government strives for in this brave new world . 
  that 's a very narrow view of relationships between states . 
  there seems to be a some kind of attraction in visiting a war-torn or lawless region . 
  this type of tourism seems to be increasing lately . 
  pkk is a secularist , feminist , human rights protecting , anti-nationalist , pacifist , badass freedom fighters who want to protect the american way . 
   reads like butter . 
  sounds good . 
  i 'm gon na use it . 
  that 's how i improve my english . 
  nationalistic feelings satisfied !,
