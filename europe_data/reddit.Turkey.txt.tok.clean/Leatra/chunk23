   no grudges now of course feels brutally like otherwise though . 
  working on it . 
  germoney . 
  boy , size really matters i guess . 
  just staring at it makes me feel hungry . 
  i should ask my mom to make some for dinner . 
  i agree . 
  my dad loves it and i tried it but it just tasted too thick or something . 
  there used to be street salesmen in turkey who sell boza while shouting `` boooozaaaaa ! '', 
  but now that tradition seems to have died out . 
  you could have get on the window and call the boza salesman up . 
   it 's so sad that ** balkan cuisine ** is so not well-known . 
  [ this ] ( http://cdncms.todayszaman.com/todayszaman/2012/04/01/ottoman_newsdetail.jpg ) is how i looked like after reading that sentence . 
  best way to inspire nationalism in a turk is to talk about food . 
  it 's our berzerk button lol . 
  you just said `` balkan cuisine '' you did n't even imply that b\u00f6rek has roots in balkan cuisine lol . 
  balkans : gets angry at you for invading . 
  claims the food you brought to them after invading as their own . 
  i love how we can racist even when we are just discussing food lol . 
  `` oh look a turk claiming something '' and this shit gets upvoted . 
  that 's true ( especially the food of gods part ) . 
  but if a group of people making false assumptions about a culturally unique food they tasted once or twice you curse , you are going to have an interesting life lol . 
   messenger i dunno why but i thought of msn messenger after reading that . 
  those were good times . 
  that was where we should have stopped . 
  yeah , it takes a lot for a suicidal person to actually commit suicide rather than just fantasizing about it . 
  to commit suicide in this way , it sounds really fucked up . 
  and he decided to crash a plane ? 
  full of people ? 
  rather than individually committing suicide like a normal depressed guy ? 
  / r/europe is n't as bad as / r/worldnews but it is n't perfect either . 
  not the first time i 'm seeing crazy `` this particular nation sucks '' copy-pastas in irrelevant threads getting upvoted . 
  in short , he is getting upvoted and i 'm getting downvoted because he is greek and i am kebab . 
  who is right or wrong is irrelevant . 
  edit : that was a quick downvote lol . 
  i do n't have time to waste with racists like you so i 'll be quick . 
  i and a lot of people around me realize the shithole we are living in . 
  some random statistic cnn made in 2012 does n't concern me . 
  hell , here is an earlier comment of mine / r/turkey that was [ posted before this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/turkey/comments/30amqr/i_honestly_feel_sad_about_our_country/cpqqhj7 ) . 
  you 'll see me bashing the current way turkey is taking . 
  i do n't have illusions of grandeur but feel free to treat all turks like one homogenous body . 
  those `` good greeks '' exist . 
  they are all over / r/europe . 
  we did n't create those distinctions . 
  the reason they are `` good '' is not because they `` are good partners for the ultra-nationalist turkish discourse versus `` bad greeks '' '' . 
  it 's because they do n't only see your nationality when they look at you . 
  they see you as a fellow human being , unlike you . 
  you just see me as the representative of all turks . 
  your `` genocidal turk '' point fell apart because i said i recognize it , so you pulled another statistic . 
  now as you are reading this , you are probably thinking about what to pull . 
  you are pitiful . 
  do n't waste your time with this shit . 
   dude , we get it you turks are ultra image conscious , and wish you control or dictate the impression of non-turks over turkey , but get over it . 
  oooh . 
  my secret plot has been discovered !, 
  i certainly wish to control or dictate ( like those are two different verbs ) the impression of non-turks over turkey . 
  that 's why i supported your first post by providing additional information . 
  say what ? 
  and you are the one posting shit about turks all the time on reddit . 
  `` control the impression of non-turks over turkey '' huh ? 
  too bad sigmund freud missed this . 
  out of context armenian genocide card again . 
  whenever you are arguing with turks , just pull the armenian genocide card and congrats !, 
  you won the debate !, 
  you proved that turks are the spawn of satan . 
  well , unfortunately for you , i 'm one of those folks who do n't deny it ( except when i want to troll someone like you ) . 
  i do n't spend every minute of my life apologizing though . 
  and that trailer was definitely bad . 
  i feel kinda proud to inspire such butthurt . 
  greeks are pretty great people and you diaspora folk are giving them a bad name . 
  the greeco-turkish war is over in case you missed the memo . 
  keep spending hours here doing copy-pastas about how turks are evil and stuff . 
  it 's funny knowing there are people who devote their hours to do propaganda like that . 
  i 'd say go get a life , but nope , you are adorable this way . 
  please write a wall of text to explain me how much of an evil islamist ultra-nationalist armenian , greek , kurd , assyrian , martian , system of a down genocider i am . 
  for me . 
  dude you had 2 more copypastas before this . 
  now it makes 7 i think . 
  and some of them are completely out of context . 
  we get it . 
  turkey is an islamist shithole where we marry 6 year olds lol . 
  all your comment history is about how turks are bad or something . 
  it 's kinda funny . 
  [ oh wait i remember you ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2znyom/the_armenian_genocide_2006_a_fair_view_of_the/cplh0ze ) . 
  well keep your anti-turkish propaganda going . 
  you do it subtly enough so it 's more fun to read lol . 
  [ this was pretty nice ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2zogw9/journalist_sentenced_to_prison_as_houses_of_two/cpljzm8 ), 
  i agree , though i ca n't help but notice you are copy-pasting this all over reddit . 
  why ? 
  you have an interesting comment history . 
  [ i found a more comprehensive turkish source ] ( http://www.milliyet.com.tr/turkiye-de-181-bin-cocuk-gelin-var/gundem/gundemdetay/28.10.2011/1456212/default.htm ) so i do n't doubt its ' credibility . 
  it says there are 181,036 brides younger than 18 in turkey . 
  in diyarbak\u0131r it 's literally % 50 which means one in every two bride is below 18 . 
  the percentage seems to skyrocket in eastern and southeastern provinces . 
  erdo\u011fan is rolling back all the secular progression in the country so i do n't see him doing something against this problem anytime soon . 
  turkey is too big and too populous to enter eu without france and germany losing some power and turkey is a dominantly muslim country . 
  even if we all convert to christianity in one day , turkey is just too big . 
  these two points are enough for eu to stall the ascension process for a century . 
  from the turkish side , well , people are simply not interested in eu anymore . 
  like a decade ago being `` europeanized '' was the thing but people got sick of it .
