  when you shave the hair in there , it just smells a lot less and the sweat evaporates faster . 
  also , the hair makes that area warmer , which means more sweating , but only a little . 
   lowering the risk of rashes & fungal infection . 
  that 's what soaps and showers are for . 
  i lived through hotter weather than 40 celsius and i always shaved my armpits . 
  you seem like you know what you are talking about , so you probably know hair just sucks when it 's hot . 
  of course . 
  that 's gross . 
  that place smells like shit if you get sweaty . 
  i guess it ai n't a problem with hairless western dudes , but pretty much everyone here does it . 
  please have [ this ] ( http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/107/006/ae2.jpg ) for fulfilling the role of the guy who brings up eu ascension process in the most out of context fashion possible in a thread about turkey , as usual . 
  only 17 % of turks want to join eu [ according to a poll from 2012 ] ( http://www.turkishnews.com/tr/content/2012/10/01/avrupa-birligi-uyeligine-destek-en-dusuk-seviyede/ ) . 
  you guys can stop the `` you ca n't join our cool club ! '', 
  card . 
  we do n't live and breathe dreaming about eu . 
  nowadays , i think average turkish people are more about the ottoman identity which is akp ( the corrupt islamist crazies party , erdo\u011fan 's hounds ) is pushing for , rather than the european identity which never stuck anyway . 
  [ you are definitely not going to be downvoted for talking about greeks like one homogenous body . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2ynn0x/greece_warns_that_it_may_begin_confiscating/cpba2cc ), 
  there is no such thing as being `` too young to be martyred '' for those people . 
  they probably respect him for doing it this early . 
  dude , after all the shit i have gotten for being turkish , that 's just nothing so do n't worry , 
  i hope armenia wo n't get any ideas lol, 
  i dunno , seems like a fair deal to me . 
  ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 )  sell greece in pieces to the turks, 
  ananas master race, 
  i heard similar stories from other minorities before . 
  rums and a lot of other people left and turks and kurds living in rural areas immigrated to \u0130stanbul . 
  hopefully we 'll get rid of this `` everybody wants us dead so let 's be super nationalist '' mentality one day . 
  i feel like i should feel offended for some reason . 
  lol , if we got angry at minor stuff like this , we would have a heart attack in / r/worldnews . 
  you can call it whatever you want . 
  we are n't going to get pissed off at something minor like this . 
  i have seen some comments here that used `` constantinople '' like we are holding a sniper rifle above this thread and shooting anyone who does n't say \u0130stanbul lol . 
  are you talking about the [ 1923 population exchange between greece and turkey ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/population_exchange_between_greece_and_turkey ) ? 
  nowadays anybody is welcome . 
  yeah , only metro . 
  it 's an undersea rail tunnel . 
  i think the only slight mistake was `` ka-ra-ker-ee '' . 
  `` ka-ra-koui '' would be a better substitute . 
  tried it with that voice in google translate lol, 
  dat iz a perfekt prononsuey\u015f\u0131n may firend . 
  a lot of people look at certain races this way , but i did n't except to see such a blatant version of it from a fucking professor . 
  it 's working !, 
  well , dreams of joining eu are a thing of the past and it 's very unlikely to return ( as most people do n't even want to join anyway ) but i hope he will share gaddafi 's fate one day . 
  he has enough wealth to buy a banana republic and live there without working for generations . 
  though i do n't have much hope left . 
  akp is definitely going to ante up the election fraud this time ( since he has been losing some voters ) so they can get 400 mps , which is the required number to change to constitution . 
  lolololol [ rums of highest power ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/justinian555ad.png/250px-justinian555ad.png ) [ ottomans of highest power ] ( http://s1376.photobucket.com/user/pillowfight/media/2015-01-06_00010_zps305ed727.jpg.html ) . 
  this is true because erdo\u011fan told me so . 
  we ar stronk edit : fixed rum agents trying to change the map of laughable rum highest power, 
  yeah , this and the turkey jokes ( the animal ) gets old after hearing it for the hundredth time . 
  i guess it 's still new for americans . 
   it 's not even accurate historically , lol . 
  even erdo\u011fan once complained about s\u00fcleyman chasing girls in every episode and dealing with game of thrones style court intrigue as opposed to the image of awesome warrior s\u00fcleyman running one battle to another and generally being a badass . 
  both are just wrong . 
  tourists are seen as naive walking money bags by some , so it 's regardless of gender . 
  it 's best to stick around in non-touristic areas when shopping . 
  bored riot cops you say ? 
  i ca n't tolerate idle riot cops in my city . 
  we 'll see to that . 
  i got a better idea . 
  have they ever been in a turkish prison ? 
  [ immediately thought of this pose ] ( http://radicaljournal.com/_media/soviet001_med.jpeg ), 
  not all police departments deal with protests . 
  older cops tend to be better and more reasonable than young cops , since young cops are usually recruited by g\u00fclen movement and that 's how they join the police force and quickly climb ranks . 
  i do n't know if you watched it enough to know the characters ( i do n't remember their names myself ) , but the aggressive `` bad cop '' always wearing black leather and a black cap who seems like a walking ptsd disorder reminds me something . 
  my father told me about a retired cop who walked into a k\u0131raathane ( they are like cafes ) and shot a guy dead on the basis of he did n't reply to his greeting . 
  i always remember that story after seeing that guy on tv . 
  cops can get really bloodthirsty when they are dealing with protests . 
  there was a [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8i7-lfyrbn8 ) of a cop shouting to another cop who is holding a gas weapon of some kind but he is reluctant to fire it upon the crowd . 
  so his superior screams at him `` fire it , you idiot , fire it ! '', 
  i do n't think it 's for creating a better image of the police . 
  propaganda is very blatant in turkey and somebody eventually uncovers it if it 's not . 
  i think it 's just a money grab . 
  they have been milking that series for some years now and it 's mostly repeating itself by now . 
  in \u0130stanbul , there are streets where even the cops are scared to enter ( just like any big city i suppose ) . 
  cops are better at fighting protestors than criminals . 
  cops are also less likely to go all police brutality on people 's asses when a protest happens in kurdish areas because political correctness and stuff . 
  you 'll see that kinda drug addicts around after midnight in certain streets and alleyways . 
  my friend once gave one of them paint-thinners ten liras and asked him to threaten a friend of his on phone for a prank . 
  people are generally sympathetic towards beggars and the homeless , except for refugees . 
  some people are skeptic about beggars ( there have been instances of beggars driving off with their expensive car after begging ) so people usually give to certain beggars and homeless they know , rather than randomly . 
  most beggars stick to certain territories . 
  both are shitty . 
  usa can just market its ' wars better . 
  invading a middle eastern country is n't deemed as bad as invading a country like ukraine too . 
  you practically have no excuse to invade ukraine . 
  people do n't really think about the dead innocents and displaced people when they say `` remove kebab '' i do n't care about it myself tho . 
  something happening miles away of your lands can seem funny to you , even if it 's serious business to the people living there . 
  seems like something fun to piss on . 
  i would definitely try it for lulz if i was shitfaced drunk . 
  haha , yeah those grafittis were awesome . 
  my favorites was the one which said `` i could n't find a slogan . '', 
  and the one where there was a big `` h '' like helipads and above that it said `` land here if you are a man '' referring to police helicopters . 
  8.8.8.8 is still working . 
  8.8.4.4 is my secondary . 
  internet is the most powerful thing they ca n't fight against . 
  [ turkey is also 69 % ] ( http://fc08.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2013/207/1/e/wily_and_eggman_s_evil_bro_fist_by_tanlisette-d6f7zqu.jpg ), 
  still , if i was a neo-nazi propaganda guy , i would place anti-muslim above anti-jew in my priorities . 
  i would get more fools to believe in my bullshit that way .
