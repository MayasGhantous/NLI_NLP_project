  here is a tip for neo-nazis ; ditch your anti-jew ideology . 
  anti-muslim is the new anti-jew . 
  go with the flow . 
  post some anti-isis news and call for the destruction of all muslims based on that . 
  then you 'll get half of / r/worldnews as your new recruits . 
  welcome to the club , portugal !, 
  give it a year and even your computer illiterate grandmother will learn how to use proxies and dns options . 
  all conservative votes are united under the banner of akp . 
  there are a lot of people who vote for akp but do n't like the way it 's going , because they think there is no alternative . 
  the parties who oppose akp ca n't stop bickering amongst each other . 
  it would n't be diplomatic of akp to give the finger to eu . 
  of course both eu and turkey is gon na act like that . 
  it used to be `` european '' identity was something people aspired to become . 
  now the european stereotype is nothing more than a pompous and racist bastard . 
  now the trend is `` ottoman '' identity . 
  well said kanka . 
  `` oooooh you ca n't be in our special club '' bi siktir git amk . 
  hating a nation because of their government sounds stupid enough , hating a diaspora because of their government back home is worse . 
  that might be the dumbest version of racism i have heard . 
  it 's like a few millions of greeks broke into hundreds of german banks and stole the money themselves . 
  sensationalist western media does n't help . 
  it works for me now too . 
  strange . 
  i guess it was maintenance or something . 
  if the website address is [ this address on the glass here ] ( http://img.hurriyet.com.tr/_np/7046/28157046.jpg ) i ca n't access it either . 
  i 'm using proxies so i think it 's not a block , the site is taken down completely . 
  i hope they 'll go for another domain or something and fire it up again . 
  btw , from what i have heard , these guys helped people facing discrimination based on their religion by lawyering the bad guys to justice . 
  no it does n't . 
  people should stop bringing eu up at every thread about turkey . 
  it stopped being relevant to turkish politics some years ago . 
  ascension , ascension never changes . 
  [ turks ' general opinion on eu ascension process ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fo5w2xv9fb8/uglj9bluhvi/aaaaaaaadno/gecqelar5yy/s1600/almost-gave-a.gif ) . 
  it 's laughable now when someone uses the eu card on akp when even the secularist turks do n't care . 
  same goes for greeks . 
  we are all humans behind the political bullshit . 
  syriza seems better but we 'll see . 
  compared to our government , everything seems fine to me . 
  akp is replacing normal schools with islamic schools . 
  we have a saying in turkey ; `` tree takes shape when it 's young . '', 
  younger minds are the easiest to give shape . 
  so , nope . 
  there were also a lot of g\u00fclenist schools who try to brainwash children and it worked well for them . 
  he also said `` you ca n't be a muslim and secularist at the same time '' once . 
  what he says means nothing since he always contradicts himself . 
  if they pass the next interior safety laws ( and they will ) , police will be allowed to arrest anyone at a protest without requiring anything . 
  this will also make it easier for them to kill protestors , and it will give the cops necessary power to intervene during elections . 
  next elections are in june . 
  i think they 'll get around 43-45 % or maybe 50 % if they ante up the fraud this time ( [ stuff like this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2qjavy/hamas_we_will_liberate_palestine_jerusalem/cn73mpt ) ) . 
  they need a lot of votes since they intend to change the constitution . 
  they declared their intent to do so many times . 
  if hdp ( kurdish party ) can pass 10 % election treshold , they will ally with akp . 
  they 'll strike a deal and support whatever akp wants . 
  thus , they 'll have the necessary mp number to change the constitution . 
  [ and when they change the constitution ... ] ( http://media.giphy.com/media/4knvpoujzoob2/giphy.gif ), 
  there are some parts i disagree , but ,  i also believe that the akp experience , including its dreams of re-islamizing turkey , is likely to be counterproductive and will serve to further accelerate secularization . 
  i agree with this one . 
  akp was one of the things that made me question islam and i gradually became a deist and then an atheist . 
  but this is mostly happening to people who live in big cities and/or people who have a broader perspective on life . 
  it might be not enough to create a counterproductive result when you compare the people who are getting brainwashed . 
  but i still think we have a long way ahead of us before akp falls . 
  at least a decade . 
  even if erdo\u011fan dies until then , not much is going to change . 
  people who vote for akp do n't mind anything . 
  by the way , some people justify what akp is doing right now by looking at what seculars has done to them earlier . 
  they see it as revenge . 
  i hope the cycle will be broken after akp falls , but i do n't have much hope for that either . 
  i wish i shared your optimism . 
  it may be true for people living in big cities , but in anatolia and eastern turkey , people are far too gone . 
  they agree with akp and not just for the coal and pasta bribe they get before elections . 
  those secular and vocal high ranking military officials have been all replaced by akp . 
  they are loyal to akp now . 
  1453 best day of my life, 
  they get reported so much by the media . 
  if all of the media in europe and us focused on , say , a random warlord in africa , then everybody would hate him and he would seem over the top . 
  westerners would start discussing whether they should bomb them and put boots on the ground or something . 
  i mean , / r/worldnews is literally only `` a sub about isis '' at this point . 
  that 's what everyone cares and talks about . 
  i bet most people in there probably have n't even heard of boko haram . 
  this is just too immature . 
  even russians probably do n't support this . 
  this is n't cold war or something . 
  eu is just trying to deceive turkey into doing their dirty work and europeans are buying it . 
  you guys really believe eu is gon na give free visa to a fucking me country lol . 
  anything eu says about turkey 's ascension process and visas for turks is a lie . 
   i know that some kurds are considered terrorists in turkey , but i 'd take that with a pinch of salt since it comes of erdogan . 
  some kurds are considered terrorists in turkey because [ they do things like this . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3g9kxl/very_disturbing_video_of_kurdish_workers/ctw84eo )  we often refer the corsicans as terrorists do corsicans kill your people , cops , teachers ? 
  burn buses , construction vehicles , schools , etc ? 
  use [ weapons like this ? 
  interesting comment ? 
  kurds are capable of being religious and in middle east most people are . 
  there are kurdish isis members too . 
  dont interrupt my butthurt monologues, 
  come on . 
  no `` this is / r/europe '' comments ? 
  vote for hdp then . 
  even k\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu is a lucky one for chp at least we do n't have an edgy ulusalc\u0131 running things . 
   they need to make some improvements to make me think they have an actual shot at winning the elections . 
  they 'll have a shot at winning the elections if people like you actually vote for them .
