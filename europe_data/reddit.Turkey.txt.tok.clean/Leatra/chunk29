  did that guy just say allahu akbar ? 
  and that 's enough for the average european to conclude that these cities are not european . 
  `` european standard '' has no room for anything islamic . 
  well it 's basically inside europe geographically but if it was an island right next to cyprus it would n't get in as cyprus did . 
  you do n't get to talk about taking revenge or what 's fair until your country stops fucking with ukraine . 
  they kill our civilians so there is that . 
  we do n't really need the approval of foreigners to defend ourselves from them so we are n't going to bend over towards pkk just because you think they are the `` group we should arm as the western nations '' of the decade . 
  i really do n't know what people expect us to do . 
  when al-qaeda kills people they are terrorists .

  they want help from the government yet they attack our soldiers . 
  this is what kind of people we are dealing with , pkk has been a threat for 40 years . 
  it sounds much less evil and less ambiguous when people say `` turkey bombs pkk '' `` bombs kurds '' has a better ring to it . 
  also it makes it sound more like turkey kills civilians . 
  westerners tend to think of kurds as one big homogeneous organization or hive mind rather than an ethnicity so it works . 
  people do n't even believe islamist kurds exist like kurds are not capable of being religious or doing anything other than freedom fighting . 
  hahahahahaha no . 
  hatay is n't cyprus mate . 
  stay butthurt . 
  turkey does n't bomb kurds . 
  turkey bombs pkk . 
  to be honest i do n't think a mostly muslim country can be considered `` european '' either . 
  ah , `` alleged '' . 
  and hey , `` speculation '' too . 
  what would the journalism business do without them ? 
  ^ ^ look ^ ^ i ^ ^ can ^ ^ shitpost ^ ^ twice ^ ^ too, 
  lol i remember random persons with beards got attacked in turkey twice because people thought they were isis members . 
  ah , `` alleged '' . 
  and hey , `` speculation '' too . 
  what would the journalism business do without them ? 
  some people are really still sour over the fall of constantinople so your sarcasm was lost on most . 
  man i do n't get this american hard on for putin . 
  you do n't live in europe so you do n't what kind of a neighbor russia is . 
  most pro-putin comments come from americans i really do n't understand this . 
  / r/worldnews is going crazy especially . 
  you call people ignorant but i bet you have no idea of russia 's past . 
  this is n't fair !, 
  flair up so we can refute your arguments by bringing up irrelevant events from your nation 's history too . 
  [ this is your greater turkey ? 
  ] ( http://www.biyokulule.com/sawiro/sawirada_waaweyn/greater%20turkey2.jpg ) you amateur . 
  [ this is what real greater turkey looks like !,

  our idea of checking for gas leakages is flicking a lighter in the general area . 
  the price we pay for their gas is so outrageous they can keep selling it to us and they still would be fucking us . 
  i remember the wtf moment i had when ghandi told me that he is going to nuke me . 
  a wild reditski appears !, 
  we miss you over at / r/turkey dude . 
  we would come visit you if we were n't all banned in / r/kurdistan . 
  this gave me the greatest idea of all time . 
  1 . recruit pilots who only know turkish , bonus points if they are deaf . 
  there is no step two !, 
  just violate whatever airspace you want with no repercussions !, 
  http://i.imgur.com/tlfztnn.jpg ( `` we did n't even finish paying off the installments you jerks '' for non-turkish speakers ), 
  europeans occupy neanderthal homelands . 
  you move first !, 
  time to go full nomad again !, 
  no i did n't . 
  but i guess that explains why all our neighbors are butthurt towards us [ !, 
  jihads and crusades , huh ? 
  screw crusader kings 2 . 
  time to go back to the real life . 
  i do n't mind giving away sinop and samsun but you ca n't just go around disputing turkish claim over hatay which is also known as [ turkey 's slightly misshapen red dick ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/hatay_in_turkey.svg ) . 
  freud was right . 
  all our plans are foiled !, 
  i mean , \u0130stanbul alone has more refugees than all of europe combined . 
  but keep thinking all refugees just flock to europe and that we have a magical switch to turn on and off to control migrant flow to europe . 
  ^ ^ ^ gib ^ ^ ^ some ^ ^ ^ yuros ^ ^ ^ germoney ^ ^ ^ pls, 
  [ here is our version of turkey . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/blankmapturkeyprovinces.png ) [ here is your version of turkey . 
  ] ( http://www.turkishforum.com.tr/en/content/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/partitioning-of-anatolia-map.jpg ) un 's leaders agree that first version is true . 
  so nobody cares if random people on reddit wo n't recognize hatay being a turkey province . 
  we would only have ankara if we listened to all claims . 
  edit : i know my answer was over the top but cmon you seriously ca n't be asking if hatay is a part of turkey . 
  also turkey violates greek airspace and genocides armenians , in case ya did n't know . 
  hover over my flair for more information !, 
  half of our lands are considered parts of some other country by neckbeards drawing `` greater [ enter country here ] '' maps and jerking at it . 
  `` til '' ... how convenient lol . 
  no idea , since people like that usually keep their disillusionment with islam secret at the start . 
  tell us which ethnicity we should arrest and we 'll get right on it . 
  friendly ? 
  we are bordering syria , a country where we are fighting a proxy war against russia . 
   turkish airforce have the tendency to violate neighbours airspace , will it be justified to shoot down everytime it violates the airspace ? 
  our allies also violate our airspace . 
  we do n't shoot them down because ... allies . 
  pilots are supposed to know english . 
  besides , our pilots are n't able to speak all languages around the world and use the correct one according to the aircraft they are chasing . 
  it 's more logical to use the language that everyone speaks . 
  by your logic , we can fly to moscow and back and ignore all warnings since russian pilots wo n't speak to us in turkish . 
  if turkey really wanted to shoot russian planes , i do n't know why turkey would go find a russian plane to crash and lie about it violating turkish airspace , rather than waiting for one to invade our airspace eventually which they have a tendency to do frequently . 
  hey , we are turkish . 
  we 'll rant about europeans at every opportunity . 
  why would the dutch and americans lie for us then ? 
  you are trying really hard to deny truth and substitute your own reality . 
   or does the turkish military act independently of the turkish government ? 
  look at the two times we had military taking control of the government with a coup , maybe ? 
  there is literally evidence of an audio file . 
  if you stopped only reading titles of threads on reddit ... 
  this is clearer . 
  that audio file was definitely fucked but this is much clearer .
