  dude some people want to kick turkey out and invite russia in over at / r/worldnews . 
  i really do n't care what reddit says about this . 
  citizens and pkk members buy smuggled oil sometimes from isis but in eastern turkey smuggling is running rampant anyway . 
  government always turned a blind eye to smuggling to some degree because of the poverty and lack of jobs there . 
  some people just do n't have any other source of income than smuggling cigarettes and shit . 
  oh no , we are waiting for the right moment to declare war on each . 
  every moment we are not warring against each other is a moment lost . 
  because we are historical enemies and we hate each other . 
  at least that 's what people seem to think, 
  so what ? 
  that gives them a right to violate our airspace ? 
  so fucking stupid . 
  yeah , it was akp that put me on the road to atheism . 
  akp alienated a lot of people . 
  i 'm not the only one . 
  yet majority of turks are still religious , they just seem less religious when compared to the average muslim . 
  well we did n't expect this to become such a trend . 
  too late to join a vault ? 
  op basically admitted to trying to `` help turkey live in a stone age economy '' and making us pay for our crimes [ in another thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3u7cl6/turkey_has_spent_years_allowing_jihadist_groups/cxct4lz ) whatever it means . 
  he is just pushing an agenda . 
  he posts links like this from time to time . 
  russia shooting our brethren through the usage of our airspace would have been so shitty of us . 
  greek planes also violate turkish airspace . 
  the reason why we are n't shooting each other down is because of the only membership we share which is nato . 
  and they sunbathe without bras on * giggle *, 
   and only beer [ you are cute . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tekel_biras%c4%b1 ) bomonti is life . 
  you really have nothing else to do than shitting on turkey all the time do n't you ? 
  a russian plane entered our airspace and we shot it down . 
  it 's that simple . 
  everybody tries to drag this to somewhere where they can make a point . 
  any political subreddit goes to shit eventually . 
  but recently i 'm lurking around / r/changemyview / . 
  it 's pretty good . 
  it 's not a political sub but politics comes up frequently . 
  yeah he is like that . 
  he is incredibly obsessed about erdo\u011fan and turkey . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3sik4h/turkish_state_bombarding_its_own_citizens_in/cwxrwys )  you are overdoing it . 
  i make a humble contribution to help turkey live in a stone age economy that suits the stone age mindset and ideology of mr. erdogan and the akp . 
  and i make this humble contribution not on reddit , but in professional and political life . 
   no , my life is doing good for progress and people . 
  it was not my choice that the citizens of turkey voted the ultimate enemies of enlightenment , humanism and the open society into state office . 
  and this is not my problem , it is their problem , and i am very glad to be in even more than one position to make them pay for that crime . 
  do n't take anything this maniac says seriously . 
  he speaks like a soviet propagandist . 
  his use of adjectives can be quite funny sometimes though . 
  turkey arrested plenty of isis terrorists and we were bombed by isis twice . 
  we also warned france about paris attacks beforehand . 
  i think turkey tried to use them like us and it exploded in our faces . 
  i mean the plan went up in flames . 
  so do n't make such bombastic statements . 
  there is also the small case of isis conducting paris-level bombings in turkey . 
  all the recent major isis arrests happened after those . 
  i 'm sure isis still has many cells in turkey . 
  you guys have weird definitions for `` supporting '', 
   yet ah yes , never forget that all shall embrace kebab one day . 
  then we will build our own world government , with halal blackjack and halal hookers . 
   '' beer '' . 
  totally haram . 
  real muslim men drink rak\u0131 . 
  turkey tolerates isis because they also fight our enemies . 
  terrorists are killing terrorists , so we try to stay away mostly . 
  i heard al-qaeda took out some higher leadership in isis . 
  isis has made lots of enemies . 
  things are also more serious when you actually border the country that this war is going on . 
  west solves all their problems by bombing away at them from a safe distance but we need to be more careful . 
  in my opinion we should just build a big ass wall on syrian border and never allow anything to go in or out . 
  we have crapload of syrian refugees and isis is really good at blending in with them . 
  one wrong move and those isis cells can be activated in the whole country . 
  people talk about that like it was a hdp rally . 
  no , it was a rally that hdp joined too . 
  turks were in there too . 
  if you really must categorize the victims so you can know whether you should support or hate them and fit things better into western black and white perception of middle east , you can categorize them as leftists with several ethnicities . 
  also turkey bombs pkk , not `` kurds '' . 
  we are n't equipped to bomb a whole nation nor we would have any reasons for it . 
  we have good relations with krg and we train peshmerga . 
  we like some `` kurds '' and bomb some `` kurds '' and the `` kurds '' we bomb tend to be the ones that we have been fighting against for decades . 
  this is n't new and this is n't related to isis at all . 
  there have been plenty of turkish operations done in syria . 
  we have n't just recently started bombing them to aid some other group or whatever . 
  saying turkey bombs kurds is like saying usa bombs arabs . 
  i mean the beers available in turkey . 
  you infidel as a turkish person on reddit , i have seen lots of stuff going on here . 
  fuck turkey , kick 'em out of nato , close the doors of eu , and send nukes , whatever . 
  but i have never felt this much insulted in regards to my nationality . 
  edit : and it was poles who invented vodka . 
  i knew it all along and totally did not find out after another redditor told me . 
  time to seduce and have sex with russian tourists !, 
  that 'll teach 'em . 
  triggered who do you think invented raki , also known as the awesomest alcoholic drink in the world ? 
  i hate it too . 
  just has a sour taste . 
  tuborg and bomonti is much better so try those if you are ever in turkey . 
  i also tried red tuborg shot which is a tiny can but really strong ... tastes like cologne . 
  good . 
  as much as i enjoy all these `` turkey vs russia who would win ? '', 
  scenarios written by people who at most played paradox grand strategy games when it comes to geopolitics , people leading these countries are more mature than us to not go to war over one downed plane . 
  i mean , world would have gone up in flames 4-5 times every year if it was up to reddit . 
  also ottoman ideas give +5 % discipline and +33 % land force limit just buy mercs like no tomorrow fill forcelimit and get a good general gg wp . 
  the comments in / r/europe are n't wonderful either , mind you .
