  in the thread about downed russian plane , one third of the comments were whataboutism about turkish invasion of cyprus , turkish airspace violations of greek airspace , turkish aid for isis , and similar shitty yet irrelevant things we have done . 
  but this place seems saner at least . 
  we did n't cry about it . 
  we certainly did n't say repercussions will be severe like putin . 
  erdo\u011fan actually said that this should n't escalate himself . 
  also nobody gave a fuck . 
  yet when a russian plane goes down everyone loses their minds . 
  so a russian plane makes a shortcut through turkish lands and it 's okay , yet if we do it it 's not okay ? 
  your knowledge in politics is astonishing . 
  ayy lol, 
  yeah , / r/worldnews is basically `` news about browns ! '', 
  at this point . 
  i remember seeing news about china once but it was about china banning islam or whatever . 
  china pressures minorities and it 's usually criticized but this time they had huge boners over it of course lol . 
  i 'm an atheist living in a muslim country . 
  and i see first hand how shitty muslims can get , but even i ca n't understand that sub . 
  they have a really black and white perception of middle east . 
  we used to have orientalism and now even with the information age we have this . 
  / r/europe and / r/worldnews share a customer base , so to speak , so i see similar comments here too , but it is n't nearly as idiotic as those in / r/worldnews . 
   anyways , it 's just fucking stupid to shoot down a 25 million dollar aircraft of the most powerful nation on earth . 
  but i guess they really love their is oil and we would have gotten away with it too , if it was n't for you meddling nato . 
  oh wait i thought we were the non-nato country and russia was the nato country here by looking at the comments . 
  you did it reddit !, 
  ^ ^ not ^ ^ really, 
  greece invades our airspace too . 
  and we do n't shoot them down . 
  cut out the whataboutism . 
  half the comments here are about turkey violating greek airspace . 
  also , whole turkish military doctrine is built around a possible soviet invasion . 
  lol half the comments here and in / r/worldnews are about turkey invading greek airspace , turkey aiding isis , turkey genociding armenians , turkey invading cyprus and so on . 
  we really ca n't do anything and justify it since someone eventually will pull one of those cards to refute our argument . 
  [ yeah , it really seems simple and easy does n't it ? 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/aegean_10_nm.svg ), 
  i saw a comment in / r/worldnews that said nato should kick turkey out and invite russia in . 
  i do n't really care what others say about my country anymore in that sub . 
  fuck that islamist shitbag but sadly he is representing our country so things he says also binds us . 
   it 's never the other way around not never . 
  they also invade our airspace . 
  but hey nobody gives a fuck because they are our allies . 
  it 's a different story with russia . 
  i do n't know ? 
  should turkey have shot down greek aircrafts violating its ' airspace ? 
  and neither should greeks . 
  we are allies and both nato members . 
  it 's a little more important when a country you are fighting a proxy war against violates your airspace . 
  no , that 's the perception you guys have about us . 
  in all of europe , greeks are the nation that 's most similar to us . 
  who does n't ? 
  and we became allies with most of them . 
  we are allies with greece now . 
  we are n't allies with russia . 
  here is the difference . 
  greeks and turks are allies . 
  turks and russians are fighting a proxy war , and turkey also happens to border where the said proxy war is taking place . 
  this might explain why people take russia 's airspace violations a little more seriously . 
  also , greece violates our airspace too . 
  but we do n't shoot them down . 
  because we both are in the sacred brohood of nato . 
  wow , seems like people got over crimea really quick . 
  then again in / r/worldnews there was a guy saying that nato should kick turkey out and invite russia in , and he got upvoted for it . 
  so that sub is completely bonkers anyway . 
  i bet it was / r/worldnews you ran into such statements . 
   what warranted that huge increase in airspace violations from 2013 - 2014 ? 
  no idea . 
  i 'm curious now too . 
  but i do n't understand why we are getting so much flak for this while greece does the same thing to us . 
  they ignored the warnings . 
  how do you escort them out ? 
  eh , nobody has much sympathy towards turks lol . 
  putin knows isis is the only thing westerners care about so he 'll pull the isis card to get sympathy points and stop people living in nato countries from sympathizing with turkey . 
  he also seems to be succeeding in turning nato nations against each other . 
  if reddit was running the world nato would probably kick turkey out of nato , invite russia in , and invade turkey together . 
  crimea is already forgotten about . 
  apparently putin knew about this all along but why he kept silent until we downed their plane ? 
  edit : you know the part where i said `` if reddit was running the world nato would probably kick turkey out of nato , invite russia in , and invade turkey together '' ... [ yeah ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3u2now/putin_calls_turkey_accomplices_of_terrorists/cxblgy3 ), 
  oh , they are buying from turkish middlemen , so they are innocent and only the middlemen are evil . 
  whenever there are some news about turkey 's anti-isis activities , it gets downvoted to hell . 
  that 's why . 
  it does n't fit / r/europe narrative . 
  greek planes also enter turkish airspace but we do n't shoot them down . 
   but if greece shoot a plane down it would be a full scale war in seconds . 
  of course it would . 
  if we shot down greek planes it would be a full scale war in seconds too . 
  we are allies . 
  russia on the other hand , just invaded crimea . 
  hell would freeze over before we attacked greece or started downing greek planes . 
  it 's a secret plan of ours to bankrupt greece by forcing them to use jet fuel during dogfights . 
   we are bros after all . 
  agreed . 
  i do n't mind if greeks invade our airspace . 
  we are bros. 
  unless they claim our food or something like that of course . 
  then it 's war . 
  that door is already closed and [ locked way better than this ] ( http://whatifgaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/sh4.jpg ), 
  just doing my duty as a keyboard warrior :d he meant `` cyprus has good relations with nato countries and turkey invaded them '' but the way he worded it was begging to get rekt . 
  armenian genocide is relevant to anything . 
  you are arguing with a turk and it looks like you are losing ? 
  bring up armenian genocide and you will automatically win . 
  turkey is n't shooting greek planes down too . 
  [ not in that list either ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/major_non-nato_ally ) you got so many things to blame turkey about and do whataboutism , why make things up ?
