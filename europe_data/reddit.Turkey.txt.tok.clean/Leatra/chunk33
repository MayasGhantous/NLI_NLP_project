  which is still a low number . 
   and it 's not a once off either . 
  they 'll keep getting immigrants but this refugee explosion will cool down eventually and they 'll start to get fewer migrants . 
  150k migrants in one year is really a low number though . 
  do n't come !, 
  islamists have already conquered europe and are beheading people left and right . 
  people walking around with guns sounds a lot unsafe to non-muricans actually . 
  how having easy access to firearms in a country would make anyone feel safer ? 
  no kidding . 
  i had no idea it was illegal in some european countries still . 
  it 's legal even in turkey lol . 
  they were chanting `` sehitler \u00f6lmez , vatan b\u00f6l\u00fcnmez '' = martyrs are immortals , homeland is indivisible . 
  it 's typically chanted whenever pkk conducts an attack in turkey . 
  they were n't chanting allahu ahkbar . 
  as if millions of faces were suddenly palmed ... 
  people who are sick of refugees and muslims i guess . 
  i did n't say turks in netherlands were european . 
   sounds very similar to a country situated in asia minor . 
  ... which is ? 
  inb4 some news about some kurds being killed by the coup government ( which usa installed by the way ) in 80s and a long speech about how this justifies pkk 's current actions . 
   all yurop cares about, 
  people do n't have to completely give up their old culture to become an american . 
  it 's europe where you have to be assimilated to be `` european '' . 
  pkk fights in turkey so she probably did n't want to fight in syria . 
  [ women fighters have their perks alright ] ( http://i.takvim.com.tr/2015/07/30/616x275/1438272130735.jpg ), 
  they end up killing us so we do n't want them here . 
  the guy you are talking to is delusional . 
  he probably thinks you are evil just because you are turkish . 
  just ignore him . 
  why do westerners hate muslims so fucking much ? 
  he even forgot antarctica and iceland . 
  wow , nice map . 
  it 's obvious that you were just pushing an agenda by starting this thread . 
  ethnic cleansing ? 
  no need for that . 
  in 100 years europe will be eurabia and turkey will be kurdey if the world does n't start using condoms more often !!, 
  kurdish leadership is secular . 
  people are not . 
  it 's like hdp the kurdish party in turkey . 
  the inner party is progressive , yet a mp says he wants to bring sharia , the voters do things like honor killings and child marriage , etc. 
  there are no good guys here . 
  only tools and others . 
  [ they kidnapped german tourists years ago ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2008/07/09/idusl09303259#ubhsfqbythwfbext.97 ) but people did n't seem to care much about that either . 
  `` turkey attacks kurds '' is like saying `` us bombs arabs '' . 
  we are allied with some kurdish organizations and at war with others for years . 
  claiming turkey wants all kurds dead is just typical western ignorance . 
  when france gets attacked by isis and they do a counter-attack , it 's normal . 
  when we get attacked and do a counter-attack , it 's outrageous . 
  we are n't going to bend over backwards to a group that has been killing our civilians just because they also happen to fight `` westerners ' islamist enemy of this decade which they helped create '' too . 
  us allying with pkk or ypg would be like france allying with isis or al-qaeda, 
   countries should share the refugee load , do n't you think ? 
  yeah . 
  i would n't mind sharing the 2.2 m we got with europe ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  so they can end up sleeping on our streets instead ? 
  everyone has ran out of space . 
   how to run out of oil, 
  well some refugees sleep on streets here in turkey . 
  around % 80 of refugees are not in camps . 
  i think shittiness of life in general for non-refugee-center refugees is what pushes them to seek better life in europe . 
  i know being an economic migrant is treated like an evil thing but if i had to work illegally for a shit wage and sleep on streets maybe , i 'd probably try my luck elsewhere . 
   dissident paramilitaries in northern ireland i know it 's irrelevant to the thread but can you summarize this situation ? 
  i did n't know they were still active . 
  islamic terrorism seems big because that 's the only thing people talk about nowadays . 
  i think it will get bigger soon though . 
  we also would n't have to deal with this shit if some countries did n't think staging coups , invading , sending arms , etc in middle east was such a bright idea . 
  but that 's why we have these country flairs . 
  so we know which side people are on and choose the correct approach when we want to shove our opinions down their throats . 
  that 's just good manners . 
  but do not despair , my imperialist gun-toting ignorant and fat friend , you are not alone . 
  for example , i 'm currently an isis-supporting genocidal maniac . 
  i do enjoy playing with my freakishly long beard and brushing my unibrow though . 
  we have good relations with krg . 
  krg does n't like pkk so we are cool . 
  i dunno why people think we want kurds dead . 
  it 's outside of our borders i do n't care . 
  it 's pkk we are fighting against , not all kurds . 
  but we did n't say [ something like this ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3t4ulm/russias_security_chief_says_a_terror_act_brought/cx34xf8 ) about russians either . 
  do you know how big akp 's youth organizations are ? 
  they do things like this all the time . 
  they assaulted a journalist this year with no repercussions . 
   why is no one caring about russian lives lost in the plane in egypt because they are russians . 
  they do it with us too . 
  what peace talks ? 
  how do you deal with radical islamists then ? 
  pick up bits of them and put them to jail after they explode ? 
  yeah eu stopped being a thing in turkey ... 10 years ago . 
  europeans talk more about turkey 's ascension process than turks ( and it 's usually something like `` huhahaha you are never gettin in '' or `` if you do our dirty work we will let you in ... in the next century '' ) . 
  you do n't need to be the president of the eu to grasp this simple fact . 
  you just need an out-of-eu perspective which all europeans apparently lack . ^ ^ it ^ ^ even ^ ^ motherfucking ^ ^ rhymes, 
  [ i 'll tell you the reason ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3t7gyw/turkey_soccer_fans_boo_moment_of_silence_for/cx43ub1 ) people here see something bad happening to a turk in europe and immediately try to bury it . 
  and when it 's turks doing something bad , it 's talked about for days . 
  same thing goes for ignoring isis attacks in turkey . 
  it 's disgusting they booed the moment of silence but people here are just pushing agendas nothing more . 
  i mean [ look at this ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3t4ulm/russias_security_chief_says_a_terror_act_brought/cx34xf8 ) . 
  the guy got a gold for it . 
  ^ ^ these ^ ^ football ^ ^ fans ^ ^ just ^ ^ want ^ ^ their ^ ^ gold ^ ^ :(, 
  having an insider in the muslim world lol you mean letting 80 millions of muslims in on your land ? 
  yeah no european in their right mind would allow that . 
  do you know how `` muslim world '' has always been dealt with ? 
  by supporting coups and raining bombs .
