  you do n't need anything else . 
  if we did something like this , there would be another `` turkey supports isis '' circlejerk lol, 
  but the day akp falls with their propaganda and unfair election tricks , they 'll lose a huge percentage of that . 
  german was widely taught in turkish high schools . 
  now we learn english ( if foreign language classes were actually good in turkey ) . 
  we even hate each other really . 
  we see the japanese as honorable and hardworking . 
  but it kinda tells something that the only country we love is the one that is so far apart . 
  i do n't know if we would hate them if we were neighbors lol . 
  we do like koreans though . 
  we did n't have any problems fighting for them . 
  this comment tree is getting too american for me to handle . 
  national unity ? 
  what is this alien concept you speak of ? 
  turkish football fans in this match were particularly bad because of things like [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3t79tt/turkish_fans_boo_minute_of_silence_for_paris/cx3qqma ) and [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/turkey/comments/3t84jc/can_anyone_speaking_turkish_explain_us_what/cx44s0i )  davutoglu was watching it live with tsipras , so they probably filled stadium with erdogan ( akp ) sheeps to prevent people protesting davutoglu ( like before happened with erdogan , then they introduced a tagging system called passolig and ban people based on what theey do in/after stadium ) . 
  so , i dont know what they are booing , i dont think sheeps know what they are booing either , they were just copying others . 
  -  apparently davuto\u011flu was at the game and since akp hates to be booed by football fans they often bring their own `` fans '' to the games they officially attend . 
  so most likely these meatheads were given free tickets to the game because they belong to some conservative pro-akp youth organization . 
  these organizations pick up slum dwelling futureless addicts , drop-outs etc. 
  and turn them into partizans by giving them money , clothes or provide kitchen supplies , fuelwood or coal for their families , and use them whenever necessary . 
  they do n't even know how to pay respects to their own dead , it 's no surprising they did what they did . 
  their masters are really angry at them too ( no one likes international backlash ) i guess it 's what mad dogs do when you walk them around without a leash . 
  what you are seeing is akp supporters in their natural habitat . 
  it appears youth-wing of akp was given free entrance to the stadium . 
  so this is n't shocking at all . 
  here you see typical akp supporters . 
  hating everyone who is n't them . 
  yes erdo\u011fan is fucking things up . 
  i 'm an atheist i can see cracks in secularism . 
  but people act like we have already devolved into a sharia country with islamists running around beheading people with machetes and enslaving the women . 
  we will have a civil war before that happens . 
  most european countries support pkk to some extent but because of the current context we are talking about france 's support . 
  i do n't blame greece for it since we were n't exactly allies back then . 
  1453 best day of my life . 
  one giant butthurt wrapped and made into a gift , to the western world !, 
  do you know why people here are angry ?

  % 40 downvote and only 41 comments . 
  but here you got % 15 downvote and 389 comments . 
  that 's the gist of it . 
  % 40 downvote ? 
  i guess everybody is flocking to [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3t7gyw/turkey_soccer_fans_boo_moment_of_silence_for/ ) instead lol . 
  well i hope you have fun jerking off to our misfortunes . 
  do n't get mad when others do it to yours ' too . 
   just as bad as isis thanks bro . 
  dude . 
  when people die in turkey it 's always the kurds . 
  what about french ? 
  just 100 dead people and suddenly they are the victims . 
   milli g\u00f6r\u00fcs you learn one word and never let it go . 
  people act like they go out of their way to fight isis . 
   i just read that the turkish kurdistan contains a majority of kurds , and since they are fighting isis i feel sympathy for them everybody talks about kurds like they are one organization but turkish kurds do n't fight isis actually . 
  only the ones that actually live in the lands that isis is slaughtering people at is fighting isis . 
   so he 's just wanted cuz he 's member of a party ? 
  that 's fucking weak man . 
  that 's the spin europeans give to pkk . 
  a illegal workers ' party farting butterflies and freedom fighting . 
  he is wanted by turkey for being member of a terrorist organization . 
  and i guess narcotics trafficking is cool by you ? 
  we are going to invite every ethnic group that has a claim on those lands and have a free-for-all royal rumble tournament . 
  the winner gets the clay . 
  there is n't any real evidence about that funding but let 's say it is real . 
  i guess you can understand how we feel then when france supports pkk . 
  and it 's a whole another thing to actually let a terrorist speak in your parliament . 
   z\u00fcbeyir aydar , one of the most wanted men in turkey ; known as one of leaders of kck ( umbrella organisation encompassing the pkk ) gave a speech in the national assembly of france . 
  you do n't get more pro-pkk than that . 
  weird how you ignore this . 
  how would you react if we took a isis commander to our parliament ? 
   my schadenfreude boner is suuuper hard . 
  and we are evil for booing this moment of silence ? 
  this hypocrisy is incredible . 
  are we jumping from pkk to erdo\u011fan now ? 
  my turkish senses are tingling !, 
  someone is gon na ask me about armenian genocide . 
  do n't get me wrong , what they did here , disrupting the minute of silence is disgusting . 
  but it 's annoying to witness `` it 's freedom fighting when done in turkey , it 's terrorism when it 's done in paris '' shit too . 
  we fought an independence war and drew our own borders . 
  that 's why we are so committed to preserving it . 
  it 's ingrained in our mentality . 
  when i said `` draw borders '' i meant all these fantasy kurdistan maps people are throwing around . 
  tbh it would actually benefit us if we got rid of southeastern turkey , but tell that to the nationalists . 
   she was ** shot dead ** in ** paris , france ** , on 9 january 2013 , with two other female kurdish activists , fidan do\u011fan and leyla s\u00f6ylemez . 
  she was the co-founder of a terrorist organization that killed thousands of us . 
  i think a french can understand me most when i say i do n't care if she died painlessly or not . 
  part of spanish homeland should also be catalonia in my opinion . 
  it does n't fall to foreigners to meddle in other countries and draw borders . 
  do n't you remembers the news about co-founders of pkk getting killed in paris and it being blamed on turkish intelligence ? 
  pkk members needs to be there in paris first to be killed right ? 
   okay so a reddit comment is your reference . 
  k . there are links given by other reddittors it 's not just `` baguette did that and did this they hate kebab bohoo '' you know , i was half-expecting this thread to just become a pkk thread but i did n't think it would be this quick lol . 
  [ france 's connection to pkk is explained here by other redditors ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3t0san/paris_attacks_turkey_told_france_twice_about/ ) . 
  i do n't have time to go into detail at the moment . 
  it 's there somewhere in the bottom comments . 
  i mean think about the reaction europeans would give if we took a commander of isis to our parliament to hear him speak . 
  also there is the whole libya thing . 
  people are angry at europe for this ( and angry at france for plenty of other reasons like supporting terrorism ) but it 's still disgusting to boo something like that . 
  it was just civilians trying to get on with their lives . 
  people in turkey are just too vicious when it comes to politics . 
  football fans are worse than hooligans in turkey . 
  majority of those people are akp voters , this is exactly what one would expect from them .
