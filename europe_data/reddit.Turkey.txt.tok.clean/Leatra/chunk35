  i know right . 
  that turk just has a victim complex , dying like that to blame the white man . 
  so this sub is much better and different ? 
  people here literally think refugees are launching an invasion . 
  do you know the normal response to an invasion ? 
  it 's this . 
  people claim `` islam is not a race so i 'm not racist for hating muslims '' but people miss that to everyone , a brown is a fucking muslim . 
  islam is not a race but people make it a race . 
  or maybe it is a problem ^ ^ :3, 
  he didnt say its a problem, 
  i do n't know when the ban was lifted . 
  i 'm on google dns all the time and ca n't tell if a website is blocked or not . 
  well how long did this ban took place for ? 
  3 days ? 
  ban on imgur seems to be lifted too . 
  i 'm convinced that this is a viral marketing trick . 
  we will ban reddit in a few days again to get you guys to talk about it . 
  seeing cats everywhere was one of things i miss while being outside of turkey lol . 
  i , for one , welcome our new feline overlords . 
  thanks , that 's exactly what i was doing . 
  skin color based rhetoric died and is resurrected as something completely different . 
  for example , nowadays brown almost always means muslim or someone of middle eastern descent . 
  nobody thinks of brazilians or darker skinned europeans when somebody says `` browns '', 
  everyone talks like they know everything . 
  it 's getting confusing and hard to understand what people mean . 
  `` kurds '' are n't one organization . 
  it 's an ethnic group . 
  they have lots of organizations that differ from each other . 
  it 's difficult to explain this to people . 
  everyone talks about the `` kurds '' as one homogeneous body . 
  that 's true , but i doubt it 's the reason why they did n't follow up on this tip . 
   reported every ethnic kurdish woman who owns a miniskirt lol . 
  you never fail to surprise me with your delusions . 
  are you going to delete this comment too ? 
   should turkish soldiers have been deployed in ireland ? 
  no , and we did n't harbor ira members either . 
  no , it 's a direct attack when only it happens in france . 
  it 's something to ignore when it happens in turkey . 
   reported every ethnic kurdish woman with a miniskirt lol . 
  you never fail to surprise me with your delusions . 
  france was already at war the moment allied forces started bombing isis . 
  europe was taking this too lightly . 
  something like this had to happen for people to realize how dire situation has gotten . 
  bombing away at terrorists from a safe distance without a counter-attack has gotten people complacent . 
  some of them , yeah . 
  belgium is also aiding isis . 
  [ how belgium became a terrorism hotbed . 
  for the past year , terrorist plot after terrorist plot has been tied back to belgium . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3sygz2/how_belgium_became_a_terrorism_hotbed_for_the/ ) because this is like , a completely obvious evidence of belgian support for isis . 
  belgium out of nato naow . 
  i am truly enjoying this circlejerking session my dear genocidal compatriots , but i can not stand idly by when you make such a big rhetorical mistake . 
  turkey is supporting freedom fighters , not terrorists . 
  because isis has not done any attack on turkish soil , only on our allies ' soil , which forces us to think of them as freedom fighters . 
  these are simply political activists peacefully reacting against us invasion of iraq , french activities in libya , allied airstrikes against territories of isis ( as we all know isis fights pkk , a terrorist organization , which makes isis the good guy and attacking the good guys makes you evil ) and similar actions taken by the imperialist west . 
  and those recent attacks in turkey that people claim to be done by isis , are actually done by grey wolves , an organization whose existence is as plausible as illuminati . 
  where was nato when isis attacked us ? 
  where was nato when we were getting attacked by pkk for decades ? 
  why did n't nato take actions on the countries that support pkk ? 
  spent half a second there thinking whether you mean the film or the organization from mass effect lol . 
  for example , [ this guy ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tu0oz4o.jpg ) is a pkk member . 
  he is a freedom fighter being oppressed by the turkish state . 
  [ just look at this link ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3g9kxl/very_disturbing_video_of_kurdish_workers/ ) . 
  tyrannical turkish state can be seen here stopping kurdish people denying their right to walk around with rpgs . 
  they are simply politically active kurds who just happen to be interested in rpgs . 
  until they fire those in paris , of course . 
  then , they are terrorists . 
   im perfectly sure some turks just called up some frances and said '' there be terotits comin ur way fronce '' i think you are onto an idea for an awesome polandball comic here . 
   they regularly alert germany about kurdish `` terrorists '' ( that wo n't ever be a threat to germany , or anyone but turkey ) [ pkk kidnaps 3 german tourists in east turkey ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/2008/07/09/uk-turkey-germany-kidnapping-idukl0930325920080709 ) terrorists are a threat to everyone . 
  turning a blind eye to a terrorist organization just because they do n't harm you is disgusting . 
  also putting quotation marks on that word wo n't change the fact . 
  [ z\u00fcbeyir aydar , a red notice ( interpol ) suspect from kck , talking in french parliment . 
  ] ( http://www.trthaber.com/haber/turkiye/kirmizi-bultenle-aranan-pkkli-terorist-fransa-meclisinde-215774.html ) of course they will ignore warnings from us when they are intentionally harboring the terrorists who we warn them about . 
  because as we all know when it 's done in france , it 's terrorism , but when it 's done in turkey , it 's freedom fighting that could use some support . 
  paris , that is what we have to live with here . 
  and they blame us of harboring isis terrorists . 
  which country is dealing with a terrorist organization that has western support for decades ? 
  brown and white stopped being only skin colors long ago . 
  having a western culture . 
  european or american . 
  if you ask `` what 's western culture ? '', 
  i do n't think i 'm qualified enough to answer that . 
  i do n't think eastern europeans are completely `` culturally white '' but anyway . 
  all european ethnic groups are basically `` white '' though . 
  at least culturally . 
  if you are talking about americans who talk about europe like it 's one single country and culture , yeah they are annoying . 
  yeah , pretty much . 
  jambon means ham in turkish too so i was confused for a second here also . 
  democracy in a country where the majority is uneducated idiots always reverts itself back to authoritarianism . 
  i lost my belief in democracy . 
  the only period we actually had a good leader was when this country was led by a benevolent dictatorship . 
  we have a long way ahead of us but when akp is finally gone , first priority should be education and secularization of the country . 
   still accurate in that it spells out the acronym of the group 's full arabic name  `` a bigot who imposes his view on others . '' poetic . 
  and here i was thinking it would n't get any more stupider than `` refugees are invading europe '' remarks . 
  that 's because you are turkish . 
  someone would have done it if i did n't lol . 
  [ usa is n't so great either ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/03/us-led-air-strikes-on-isis-targets-killed-more-than-450-civilians-report )  airwars project details ` credible reports ' of at least 459 non-combatant deaths , including 100 children , in 52 air strikes 459 people including 100 children . 
  that 's like more than two parises . 
  paris massacre and the outrage it caused in europe made me look at civilian causalities in middle east with a new perspective . 
  they suddenly stop being numbers that you look at from a detached viewpoint . 
  this is what refugees are running away from .
