  buying greece would probably be easier though . 
  here you go , a 100 dollar bill ... now gim me the 99 dollar change . 
   yeah ... no . 
  we have plenty of religious people in europe too . 
  the problem starts when you try to enforce your views on others . 
  you do n't need to enforce your views on others . 
  you start getting weird looks as soon as people think you are a muslim . 
  and plenty of religious people ? 
  you mean christians ? 
   look , i do n't want to insult you but that 's definitely inferiority complex . 
  well it stops people from treating me weird . 
  unless you are an armenian . 
  in that case awkward moments galore . 
  i know what inferiority complex looks like dude . 
  i could tell you a story if i had time . 
  i wish they just built a big ass wall on the border of middle east and vowed to never intervene really . 
  i mean [ your least extreme person ] ( http://i.imgur.com/c2qgih.jpg ) can be unreliable and [ fuck things up further ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/covert_united_states_foreign_regime_change_actions ) sometimes . 
  atat\u00fcrk 's mistake was being too lenient with islamists and trying to go democratic too fast . 
  should have hanged them all and continued the dictatorship for a while . 
  democracy with uneducated fools only means idiots get to pick who rules the country . 
  i laughed my ass off when i learned akp won . 
  i do n't know why . 
  he did n't do anything !, 
  that 's why he sucks !, 
  turkish history of politics has never seen such a passive politician ever . 
  you can name it `` republic of turks suck and greeks rule '' if it gets us outta this mess . 
  converting to orthodoxy ... well i kept up the appearance of being a muslim for years while subtly insulting all religions . 
  i 'll only have to act like an orthodox now . 
   switch to byzantine idea group i 'm pretty sure turkish idea group actually gives us negative effects as we unlock them so i do n't mind . 
   primary culture is greek or pontic greek get ready to spend some bird mana dudes . 
  i have a better idea . 
  [ nope the fuck out ] ( http://media.altersozluk.com/entries/1015/10151/543a9aff39535.jpg ) maybe we can saw north cyprus off and glue it to hatay as one final `` fuck you '' to eu , for old times ' sake . 
  he was always an extreme islamist . 
  he was a puppet of the west so you guys turned a blind eye to it . 
  akp has always been like this . 
  now they are powerful , they are less subtle about it . 
  abdullah g\u00fcl , one of the founding members of akp , said that republic has ran its ' course and he also said that they want to change this secular system . 
  he said those in 1995 . 
  never heard of it ? 
  not surprised . 
  there are rumors of fraud . 
  [ a guy here shows evidence of votes being higher than the amount of voters ] ( http://onedio.com/haber/bir-twitter-kullanicisindan-gelen-artan-oy-sayisi-tespiti-kafa-karistirdi-616582 ) also fuat avni ( a whistleblower spy-like dude who has a tendency to know things before they happen ) is also saying some fraud went down . 
  to be honest i do n't think fraud had that big of an effect but anyway . 
  [ i wrote about my take here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3qz4c7/turkey_heads_to_polls_tomorrow_info_thread/cwkn9c1?context=3 ), 
  but we love azerbaijanis and south koreans . 
  yeah they sure love you if you have like a tattoo on your forehead which says `` atheist freedom-loving normal dude '' or something similar . 
  otherwise they treat you like a typical brown trash . 
  i always try to point out that i 'm an atheist when people give me that look when i say i 'm turkish . 
  plenty of people hate turks regardless but that cools down the islam-hating folks . 
  takes a while to get around prejudices no matter what . 
  tbh i would hate turks if i was them too . 
  turks in europe are the worst kind of turks . 
  turkey deserves a lot worse with this election outcome . 
  not to mention our bloody history . 
  only thing that troubles me is they do n't allow turks into some clubs in germany lol . 
  you really think the mentality that did mad\u0131mak massacre would fight for secularism under threat of sharia ? 
  yeah it 's not about religion , but religion is the catalyst . 
  it will go to shit either way . 
   how would kurdish akp voters feel about a turkish invasion of rojava ? 
  to be honest people really do n't care that much about whatever goes on beyond the borders . 
  the split is big enough for them to kill each other over it . 
  h\u00dcdapar and hdp member clash sometimes . 
  h\u00dcdapar is basically kurdish hizbollah . 
  most kurds are very conservative and religious . 
  hdp leadership is secular and more to the left but their voters and outer-ring members are n't . 
  hell , a member of hdp once said they favor sharia law . 
  the only reason kurds were voting for hdp was because hdp was a kurdish party ( nationalism ) . 
  this is why hdp and akp share a voterbase . 
  akp is n't a kurdish party but they are n't nationalist at all when it comes to turkish nationalism . 
  so kurds are okay with it . 
  akp is islamist which is a big pull for kurds . 
  oh you were ` murica the world police . 
  thought you were germoney for a second . 
  yeah , you ca n't even imagine how insulting it is to talk about eu membership to a turk . 
  there are rumors of fraud . 
  apparently there are more votes than the number of voters in some provinces, 
  right wing voters are more organized and have higher attendance in elections worldwide . 
  akp sometimes pays people to vote for them , gives them bags of coal , pasta , etc , and sends buses to their houses to take them to ballots . 
  this means uneducated and poor are more likely to go through the trouble of voting . 
  dude at this point i want both hdp and mhp to stay below 10 % . 
  they both done incredibly stupid shit and they fucking deserve it . 
  i want akp to get like 90 % . 
  i 'm feeling like a masochist . 
  i want akp to have full power over turkey and i want them to take the blame when things go to shit . 
  drop a nuke on us or something i do n't care . 
  1.5 % from sp . 
  sp is basically akp but even more extremist . 
  they probably decided to vote akp when they saw akp having trouble with the last election . 
  those are people who are fed up with mhp being incredibly passive . 
  hdp lost 3 % . 
  i think those are the religious and conservative kurds . 
  chp pretty much remained the same and since a chp voter would never vote for akp , it 's irrelevant . 
  1.5 +5 +3 = 9.5 % also a big thank you goes to pkk for breaking the ceasefire and giving akp the opportunity get nationalist votes . 
  they are more worthless than mosquitoes i kill without a thought . 
  seriously nobody except non-turks care about turkey 's eu ascension and it 's getting annoying seeing europeans pull the eu card at everything . 
  ca n't use that as a stick with a carrot at the end of it anymore . 
  many anti-akp turks also dislike the west . 
  then next time you lose a war , form civilian resistance groups and fight an independence war rather than just backing down like a bunch of pussies . 
  oh man , i forgot about saudis . 
  those guys completely eclipse us in the `` going bananas in the name of your imaginary friend '' thing .
