  turks and syrians are still different but of course not as different as swedes and syrians . 
  but it 's still difficult to support millions of refugees no matter what their culture is . 
   also , turkey treats them as asylum seekers in the traditional sense , give them basic shelter , food , water , etc. 
  in massive tent camps , that reduces the costs of each immigrant massively . 
  actually , no . 
  only 20 % of refugees get this treatment . 
  the rest roam freely . 
  and since they work illegally they hit the labor market hard too . 
  why hire a turk when you can get syrian worker who you can treat like a slave and pay less ? 
  this life is the main reason why most of them want to go to europe . 
  also , millions of refugees of a different culture roaming freely also causes social problems too . 
  yeah we are all paid trolls . 
  but we actually get paid . 
  looking at your flair , i ca n't say the same for you . 
  burn . 
  turkey is 80 million people and we got 2.2 m refugees . 
  it 's not really that high . 
  though most of ours probably wo n't pull a `` family reunification '' , since we got a lot of women too . 
  if reunification thing goes through in sweden , well , things will get shitty indeed . 
   watch this subreddit to read how racist 95 % of the turks on reddit are when you ( westerners ) are not looking . 
  oh the horror !, 
  we are n't politically correct !, 
  [ oh man this is great ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/turkeysubredditwatch/comments/3ksaxn/gossip_trashtalk_about_westerners_the_turkish/ ) you are really obsessed with us are n't you ? 
  do you read all our links ? 
  do you analyze all our comments to find something to shit all over ? 
  do you stalk our comment history to find any hints of genocide suggestion ? 
  i 'm loving this lol, 
  man you are sad . 
  post the remove kebab copypasta instead next time . 
  creating a sub like / r/turkeysubredditwatch because of butthurt ? 
  who is low enough to slander a sub just because they hate the country that sub represents ? 
  go out and have a hobby dude . 
  and get laid . 
  edit : [ ok do n't get laid ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3pr5w5/pkk_bomb_attack_hits_public_offices_hospital_in/cw8ykoa ) . 
  no sex can fix you lol . 
  it 's not really a high number actually . 
  i was expecting worse . 
  dude has an army of lawyers . 
  his lawyers are numerous enough to siege a medium-sized medieval castle . 
  probably needs to dress them up like [ this ] ( https://i.imgur.com/9p4shov.jpg ) though . 
  or we can send the [ special commando team ] ( http://www.evrensel.net/upload/detay/ocak/caps1.jpg ) . 
   because there are millions and millions in concentrated in camps in jordan and turkey hell , a very big majority of them do n't even live in camps . 
  so they are n't expected to live in a tent in a desert ( we have no deserts here btw ) , they are expected to live on streets and work illegally . 
  their situation is much harder than people here imagine . 
  and when smugglers spin them a story where they can just go to eu and live without having work like a slave , that gives them hope . 
  that 's why they all want to leave . 
  europeans have every right to reject refugees . 
  i would not want them there if i was living in europe too . 
  but everyone must know the consequences and what will happen to those refugees when they are rejected . 
  also , it 's usually the richer folks who can make it to europe . 
   why should turkey blast a hole in it 's own labor market ? 
  in fact , those who are n't in camps work illegally . 
  if you were a boss you would take a syrian worker over a turkish one too since you can basically treat the syrian ones like slaves and they work for less . 
  the hole is already ripped open in our labor market by now . 
  and only a very small amount of refugees are registered and in camps . 
  the rest are free to roam . 
  only 20 % of refugees in turkey live in camps . 
  we do n't have enough camps for 2.2 m people . 
  the rest live on streets , work illegally or beg . 
  the reason they leave may be because they do n't want to live like a dirt . 
  oh sorry , i misread your comment . 
  i agree with you then . 
  ~ ~ yeah , that does n't seem to be case though . ~ ~ i agree . 
  [ i mean look at this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3pn0r6/benjamin_netanyahu_blames_holocaust_on/ ), 
  people here kinda expect them to be the least racist people in the world i think . 
  i was surprised too . 
  we have a saying `` kraldan \u00e7ok kralc\u0131 olmak '' literally means `` being pro-king more than the king '' . 
  it feels fit here . 
  calm your tits champ . 
  i did n't say anything like that . 
  that incident made the headlines here so i shared it . 
  we are too acquainted with the rise of racism in eu . 
  do you think i 'm trying to shift the blame to black people or something ? 
  lol, 
  do n't take the comments there seriously . 
  you 'll go insane . 
  you ca n't believe the shit turkey gets thrown at over there . 
  i stopped hanging in that sub when i realized i was starting to become more nationalistic and now i just write comments there to troll people or throw shit at us now lol . 
  a few days ago a black guy in uk attacked a disabled turkish guy on a bus for speaking turkish and told him to go back to turkey . 
  most people here were surprised that a black guy did this . 
  i 'd rather just play blood bowl than watch an american football game . 
  as a viewer you do n't do n't experience that strategy moment . 
  in normal football coaches literally shout instructions while the game is going on sometimes . 
  as a viewer you are n't experiencing any of that . 
  lots of strategy go in every sports game but in most games they happen while on play . 
  in soccer , managers literally shout instructions from touchline sometimes while game is taking place . 
  it 's not that bad actually . 
  i tried watching once and got bored because of those waiting times . 
  it 's like they invented a game with long breaks just so they can show commercials and sell stuff . 
  man you are obsessed . 
  go get some air and get a hobby or something . 
  half of american football seems like waiting . 
  i like the beer part . 
   if your attitude towards neo-ottoman political chauvinism and towards the agenda of erasing everything kurdish from the face of the earth were equally clear , that would be great . 
  you are a lunatic and i do n't have to prove anything to you . 
  nobody has . 
  stop asking people to do this . 
   `` my husband wants to prove my innocence . 
  for him , it is now a matter of honor . '', 
  what .
