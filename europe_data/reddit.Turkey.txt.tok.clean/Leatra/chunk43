  there is literally a video of it . 
   it makes sense that members of a culture know more about their traditional music , does it not ? 
  when i came to those kurds , i was looking for people to point me in the right direction in searching for the music archived on the internet , not for them to play it for me . 
  probably the ones you talked to had no idea what you were talking about . 
  i 'm turkish but several times foreigners showed me an old and traditional t\u00fcrk\u00fc ( traditional turkish song ) that i had never known . 
  plenty of people listen to music like that we have mainstream musicians ( [ ahmet kaya ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ealqswpmb5m ) for example is a well-known kurdish musician who passed away 15 years ago ) that most people listen to . 
   i do n't expect modern people to dance and sing for me in colorful costumes . 
  i find neo-traditional music to be tacky , and besides i 'm not an asshole . 
   haha no offense intended with my earlier comment   i 've had turks show me some excellent ottoman-era court music on the internet that led to me to a whole library of artists . 
  it 's just the way it works . 
  and when people come to vojvodina ( they never do ) , i try to show them the historical sites , tell them about the different peoples living in the region , and if they 're interested ( they never are ) , i 'll drown them in recordings of traditional music . 
  it feels like part of being a host to me . 
  the people you were dealing with were going down on the slippery slope . 
  that 's why they used you like a marketing tool ( like `` hey look a foreigner is supporting our cause ! '' ) . 
  you just got unlucky . 
  if you encountered normal human beings instead i 'm sure it would be a trip to love . 
  so i hope you make a trip here again . 
  this akif pirin\u00e7ci dude is more hilarious than offensive lol . 
  ca n't help but respect his creativity . 
   so on my first trip there , i decided to couchsurf with some kurmanji kurds in what was essentially a ghetto . 
  perhaps you 're familiar with nurtepe ? 
  i do n't even need to read the rest rofl i skimmed a bit and yeah , what did you expect when you were going straight into an ethnic nationalist activism orgy ? 
  hang with normal people next time . 
  ** edit ** : probably should have written a more detailed response since this reaction seems to be prevalent among westerners . 
  the western romanticized version of `` oppressed people image '' in middle east will never turn out to be what westerners expect . 
  this region is n't white and black as some people might think . 
  also , the year is 2015 not 1900s . 
  none of us wear weird traditional costumes and make that traditional music frequently anymore . 
  it does n't have anything to do with race . 
  if you hanged with a group of ultra-nationalist \u00dclk\u00fcc\u00fc pro-mhp turks you would feel weirded out too . 
  or go join a group of those chaining-myself-to-tree pro-green folks . 
  or commies . 
  in middle east , extreme become even more extreme . 
  if you really want to do some `` activist tourism '' ( is that a word ? ), 
  it 's better to avoid marginalized extremist protests . 
  especially nationalist ones . 
  nationalists are shitty everywhere . 
  for example , gezi protests were nice . 
  there were people from all group with a general leftist tone . 
   men are very friendly and touchy-feely with other men . 
  yeah we hug and kiss a lot . 
  nothing to do about that lol . 
  it 's surprising to see that from a `` macho '' culture but it does n't really feel homo to us . 
   if the chechen guy doing the ama would tell me that he finds totalitarian sharia ideology as much bullshit as i find totalitarian nazi ideology bullshit , i were all content . 
  do you know how it feels when people expect you to say , just because of your race , `` no i 'm moderate/atheist/not-jihadist '' all the time so they 'll feel comfortable around you ? 
  you feel like you are being treated as a fucking lunatic . 
  it 's alienating . 
  so do n't call a guy a barbarian dirty muslim beheader unless he tells you that he believes in that stuff . 
  do you want us to call you a nazi every time we see you ? 
  lol yeah i thought you were being sarcastic sorry . 
  dude you do n't know what we went through . 
  believe me , anything that eu says about turkey 's ascension process is a big lie . 
  there is a billion reasons why turkey ca n't join . 
  maybe in the next couple of centuries we might but for now eu is safe . 
  as long as they do n't just roam freely , i guess that would be okay . 
  we ca n't accept any more illegal roamers whatever the deal is . 
  80 % of the 2 million we got are living in cities and towns and working illegally as it is . 
  i do n't know how parliaments work in sweden but chp is pretty relevant and influential in turkish politics . 
  when we get rid of erdo\u011fan chp is the most likely party to rule . 
  calm your titties champ . 
  there is no chance turkey is ever joining eu . 
  she is just lying . 
  well not technically lying just throwing ambiguous and empty promises . 
  we are familiar with these kinds of eu ascension promises and they are just empty all the time . 
  it 's insulting that eu still pulls the ascension card whenever they want to make us do something . 
  they fear we turks will just abandon this land go live in eu lol . 
  because of brain drain our modern , educated and qualified folks will probably leave , which is not actually a good thing for turkey . 
  europeans are so ignorant about the cyprus issue ... 
  turkish cypriots hate turkey 's turks too . 
  that sounds plausible . 
  they still burned down turkish villages and killed civilians . 
  it 's a good analogy . 
  just let us get some popcorn . 
  people are also in denial about the deaths of turkish cypriots during this incident . 
   demographically turkey would soon become the largest country in europe and therefore would have the most votes and representatives in the institutions , above germany , france , italy and the uk . 
  [ that 's the idea ... ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xpf9kse.png ), 
   pizza is way more famous here than kebab =(, 
   as a final touch , and a sign of the eu 's good will , turkey would also be added to the list of ` safe countries ' people could be deported to does this mean we can get more people dumped at us ? 
  and it 's done purely as a sign of goodwill ? 
  because turkey was a safer country years ago . 
   creating volunteer squads of girls that 's pretty sexist . 
  and orwellian , as the other comment here pointed out . 
  no , [ this is for real ] ( http://www.diken.com.tr/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/aksaray-asker-yeni2.jpg ) [ and this ] ( http://media-cdn.t24.com.tr/media/sets/4728/uncut_page_sarayasker-cumhurbaskani-tayyip-erdogan-mahmud-abbas-ak-saray-bestepe_957208015.jpg ) [ and this ] ( http://www.evrensel.net/upload/detay/ocak/caps1.jpg ) [ and this ] ( http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/archive/2015/1/12/183294_resource/saray1.jpg ) [ and this ] ( http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/archive/2015/1/12/183294_resource/b7kdkbyciaex8rx.png ), 
  what about shooting at rocks and trying to kill them with ricochets ? 
  1/4 of lebanon population are syrian refugees . 
  lebanon , turkey and jordan combined are hosting more refugees than eu . 
  but we gib u soap operas bout kebab and u watch masochistic ? 
  to be honest i would oppose it if i was in eu . 
  most turks will back me up here with this . 
  although it will definitely be a crushing `` no '' outcome anyway so it would just be a waste of time . 
  it would n't pass even in turkey . 
  appeal of eu is fading away anyway . 
  foreigners are n't used to seeing mosques so everything they ( especially the conservative anti-islam ones ) see in \u0130stanbul is mosques . 
  it 's like a middle easterner going to scandinavia for the first time and being astonished with the cold and snow . 
  the most different thing you witnessed can eclipse all the other things that you deem `` normal '' so that will be what you 'll remember the most about your trip . 
  what have we done to eu to deserve worse than this ? 
  yeah you should probably leave the computer and get some air or something . 
  the way you are talking i 'm beginning to think it was us who genocided entire cultures in colonial nations . 
  yeah . 
  europe ca n't track them down while they are leaving but nobody blames them for it .
