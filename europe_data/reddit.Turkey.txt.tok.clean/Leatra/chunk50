  that 's it . 
  it happened in 90s . 
  pkk have no reason to exist now . 
  kurds have won their rights . 
  give me one good reason that can justify their murder of civilians and soldiers alike , and it better not be `` because turks oppressed kurds two decades ago '' . 
  that 's just revenge . 
  erdo\u011fan himself apologized for that. , we ca n't change the past , if that 's what all the pro-pkk people want us to do here . 
  people do n't ask this of germans but we still get blamed for things we have apologized for . 
  edit : no reason given , yet downvotes . 
  title is not good enough . 
  needs more bloodthirsty turks and innocent kurds . 
  when a guy builds a muthafuckin ' palace for himself you tend to say it like `` erdo\u011fan built himself a palace '' rather than `` turkey built a palace for erdo\u011fan '', 
  i 'd rather go with erdo\u011fan 's head planted over a pike . 
  that 's how we write his name in turkish . 
  his mind probably slipped to turkish . 
  german sources are always untrustable when it comes to pkk . 
  they still call it `` workers ' party '' , my ass . 
  rpg-toting workers . 
  yo , we miss you in / r/turkey dude . 
  your pro-pkk comments were worth a laugh . 
  you remind me of a redditor called kurdish-nationalist . 
  and you are talking out of your ass . 
   denial of real life democracy hdp , a kurdish party is in parliament . 
   denial of basic human rights of kurdish citizens of turkey ? 
  what are those ? 
  they are equal citizens with turks . 
   `` lynching culture '' ( al-monitor ) al-monitor huh ? 
  wow you sound so credible now . 
   i would still find your genocidal policies against them to be wrong what genocidial policies ? 
   my interest is neither turkey nor kurdistan i know your interest . 
  i talked for weeks to you in / r/turkey . 
  do n't make me dig through our old conservations . 
   the pkk are your brothers and sisters on humanity 's path into the light would be pretty sweet if they , like , did n't kill us . 
   some guy mustafa kemal was in charge . 
  if atat\u00fcrk lived to this day , pkk would be a bunch of body bags today . 
  all of your words are hollow . 
  it 's all just a meaningless `` murderer turks '' and `` freedom fighter kurds '' rhetoric . 
  there is no fact you have given as part of your argument . 
  maybe you are right . 
  3/4 of turks dislike human rights , democracy , and secularism . 
  ca n't get rid of the parliament sooner and return to monarchy . 
  most people are pessimistic . 
  a lot of people still hate chp for the oppressive regime years back . 
  not that chp is fully responsible for it but akp spins it well . 
  if chp just changed it 's name i bet it would get a 5 % more . 
  and akp does great propaganda . 
  akp supporters support their party like how a hooligan would support his team . 
  even if we came with more females we got rejected . 
  i guess it 's the ethnicity that seals the deal . 
  we ended up drinking at home more times than i can remember . 
  yeah , i guessed as much . 
  i and none of my turkish friends have the `` muslim '' look so we managed to get in showing our school cards sometimes . 
  i 've been drinking since i was 13 year old so i do n't turn bar fighter after a couple of drinks lol . 
  after getting rejected , we sometimes just bought a bottle of tequila and did shots at home and drank some beer after that to wash it through . 
  lol nope, 
  [ you have n't thought of actually checking a poll during that time ? 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/s4t4h8v.jpg ) 90 % of mhp ( higher than hdp ) and 50 % of akp voters think a country should be secular . 
  people do n't vote with only secularism and islam in mind . 
  not all nationalists are muslim . 
  a few nationalist people even regard islam as an `` arabic religion '' and believe in tengri instead . 
  but most non-muslim nationalists are atheistic . 
   mhp , akp , bbp , sp etc are just islamist parties i can say the time you spent on turkey was not well spent . 
  mhp is firstly a nationalists ' party . 
  not every mhp voter is anti-secularist . 
  everyone who lived in turkey should know that . 
  not everyone votes with only religion in their mind . 
   eh , no , mostly they do n't ; only one forth of them are into that . 
  you 're talking out of your ass . 
   well , more than 60 % of the turkey 's population votes for islamist parties , so , nope . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  akp got % 41 last election and not all akp voters are against secularism . 
  it 's all part of the plan to bankrupt greece by forcing them to overuse jet fuel . 
  we ca n't kick them out because only % 20 are in camps . 
  others are living , begging , eating from streets . 
  because we hate visas that much that 's why . 
  we are even paying people into registering to reddit and saying something about visas . 
  [ read this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/353fvv/emiratis_can_now_enter_europe_without_a_schengen/cr0r1ij ) [ and this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3npyni/turkey_to_be_officially_proclaimed_safe_third/cvqew5y )  i do n't think i even needed a visa for the last time i was in turkey . 
  god , i 'm so envious . 
  rather than dealing with all this process i 'd rather disguise myself as a syrian refugee and enter europe that way . 
  nah , that stopped being a thing a decade ago or so . 
  now we hate middle easterners and our favorite neighbor is greece ( excluding azerbaijan ) . 
  i do n't think he disagreed with that but yeah . 
  i went through all of what you just said . 
  i heard germans and americans have the worst reputation when it comes to consulate business . 
  they make you feel like a jew talking to hitler lol . 
  turks are not `` extremely pro-west '' . 
  turks admire western ideals such as human-rights , secularism , democracy , etc but we do n't love westerners themselves really . 
  we hate basically everyone , ourselves the most lol . 
  yeah . 
  it felt like all of this was a test of sorts . 
  tribes make you walk on burning coals , civilized nations set you on a quest to collect ~ ~ artifacts ~ ~ papers and endure sleep deprivation . 
  like a rite of passage . 
  i wish erasmus students would get special treatment though . 
  i know of several people who had to cancel their erasmus because of this . 
  well , the officials treat you very bad . 
  i think there was something written on my forehead , like `` this guy is gon na steal your jobs and live off your welfare '' . 
  bring one paper wrong and they 'll implicitly call you an idiot . 
  and it 's basically impossible to bring all the paperwork correctly if it 's your first time . 
  during the interview , they have a very domineering attitude . 
  i entered the wrong room and the woman just said `` how do you expect to live in germany if you ca n't find the correct room '' lol .
