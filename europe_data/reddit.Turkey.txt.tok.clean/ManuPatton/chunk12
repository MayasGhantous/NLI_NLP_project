  even hillarious . 
  do n't you know ? 
  they are precious white christians . 
  they have right to deny their slaughters and genocides . 
  you noob . 
  and you see here , the west hypocrisy at its best . 
  lol keep it up . 
   and the kurdish party never sided with erdogan are you a joke or what ? 
  lmao again and again . 
  lmao again . 
  lmao . 
  we do n't know what your values are so again an average turk may very much be better than you are . 
  an average turk may have better values than you do . 
  so we never know . 
  / u/2a1za is liar , i am not ultra nationalist by no means . 
  there is an ** excellent ** [ fact sheet ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_memo-16-963_en.htm ) released by european comission regarding to the deal . 
  anyone who is valuing human rights must read it and eu must keep up the promises for the sake of democracy , human rights . 
  did i mention that the fact sheet was excellent ? 
  you are spending far more money ? 
  as what ? 
  hungary or eu ? 
  so you take the deal then if one misused word make your blood boils ? 
  but do n't spend it on fences , ok ? 
  i hoped you d prove me wrong hence the question but as usual you are shitposting . 
  no shit sherlock !, 
  they did not own much of the cities . 
   much of istanbul , ankara and other western turkish cities were also owned by armenians and had everything stolen and handed over to turkish officials . 
  what ? 
  mixed race baby ? 
  of course there is not , was just a similar stupid remark as sultan . 
  are we talking bout pre erdo\u011fan era or not ? 
  there are christian popes ( ! ), 
  in certain countries ' parliaments and afaik they are having some success too . 
  mind to kick them out or is it exclusively islam ? 
  death penalty ? 
  banned back in 2004 , and not a single penalty since 80s . 
  relevant ? 
  economic development ? 
  i could agree on this tho you accepted countries pretty much in similar situations . 
  where is it in estonia ? 
  thank you for it btw , totally awesome . 
  `` clepto christianist '' merkel oppresses free speech . 
  out of eu please . 
  pretty much like these below ; [ kiymali pide ] ( http://www.incilipinarpide.com/panel/dosya/resimler/c97028505ccb5f006cf4671f0d7f9ac2.png ) [ kusbasili kasarli pide ] ( http://www.yesilyali.com/uploads/productsgallery/big/173_1437564482.jpg ) [ peynirli pide ] ( http://harbiyiyorum.com/wp-content/uploads/simsek_karadeniz_pide_011.jpg ) [ lahmacun ] ( http://yagizkebap.com/images/slider1.jpg ), 
  ok i am not saying it is wrong but i guess a bit nuance there is ; [ explanation of references to types of visa used in the statistics : visa data are collected on the basis of the place where the application is made , and not on the basis of the citizenship of the visa applicant . 
  ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/borders-and-visas/visa-policy/docs/overview_of_schengen_visa_statistics_en.pdf\\ ) ), 
   but the other way around ? 
  what ? 
  speaking of inhabiting thousands of terrorists , mind to revoke schengen since there are more than enough countries which breed them over in europe ? 
   turkey has too much people overstaying their tourist visa , to grant visa-free entry . 
  any numbers to back it up ? 
  you try to remove kebab by using spice ? 
  bitch please !, 
  and the pkk supporters hold the flags of the terrorist organisation and chant for them . 
  plus they are the ones always attacking physically to the others and clashing with the police in the recent videos . 
  it is very disappointing to see that the manipulation is being spread blatantly here . 
  why can not alevis and christians be turks ? 
  yes , it is . 
  why did you paint the turkish flag to sweden 's flag colors ? 
  we have [ guided `` mom 's slipper '' missiles . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/lml4f74hldi ), 
  ultimate turkish jammer technology . 
  i am not pro turk . 
  / u/2a1za is wrong . 
  i myself am blind to ethnicities and i am not blind to pro enlightenment , pro secularism , pro progress and pro open society . 
  since when ee is abbreviation of ethnic estonian ? 
  no converts in ee ? 
  while there was a guy who joined isis from estonia ? 
  you have the obligations legally , turkey does not have the obligations legally . 
  and i will do it . 
  as an opposite example , i will show your comments . 
  there are ultra nationalist turkish bike gangs ? 
  til, 
  or you can google `` hdp ` ye , pkk ` ya tepki . '', 
  there are tons of kurds who are sick and tired of pkk violence . 
  but hey you are the type of people who do not care bout kurdish lives for the greater cause . 
  fuck pkk and fuck state brutality . 
   as far as i know , the pkk is n't on the european terror list  so what do you want , us handing over someone who is considered a citizen ? 
  bureaucracy , and rules , are there for a reason and should be respected . 
  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/pdf/?uri=celex:32015d2430&amp;qid=1457362568874&amp;from=en then respect the rules and hand them over or trial them . 
  you are not the sharpest tool in the shed , my friend . 
  my condolences to the victims and their families . 
  stay safe . 
  yes . 
   i 've never seen drunk estonians in public transport now , let 's be real . 
  probably . 
  and your point being ? 
  who the fuck denies that there was oppresion against kurdish minority . 
  you give and example of a stiuation which ended at 91 . 
  move the fuck on . 
  just like asala wait till they hit them . 
  banned kurdish language ? 
  lmao . 
  is hdp political wing of pkk or not ? 
  make your minds up . 
  he meant that akp gains voters so they win and this makes them smart . 
  yeah i am speculating . 
  and you know what ? 
  i am also speculating that they can vote without becoming citizens . 
  this is freaking akp government .
