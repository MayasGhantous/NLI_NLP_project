  * e-voting is not safe . 
  * skype is not estonian . 
  well . 
  that 's a different discussion.your morals change with your interests and benefits in eu as we see lately . 
  it is not legally necessary for turkey to recognize it for the accession . 
  i have not replied to `` we do not care about europe '' meme . 
  i have replied to your wrong understanding and analyse of the situation . 
  and it definitely is not related with my ego you clearly lack of the dynamics of erdogan ' s inter speeches and his voters priorities . 
  also this demand is not solely the only bargaining of the negotiations . 
  the bargain you brought on the table , the agreement which you want to be accepted by turkey desperately . 
  so i do n't know why you are talking about turkey is `` fighting '' for the deal . 
  yep i agree . 
  but not this one . 
  biased and irrelevant and definitely not correct regarding to accession criteria . 
  even if you try to deny it , majority of his voters do not care about visa free travel because of the travel itself . 
  he will just promote it as a win against europe . 
  lol http://www.christiantoday.com/article/pro.lgbt.businesses.are.worse.than.isis.says.megachurch.pastor.robert.jeffress/86313.htm, 
  thugs have probably better grasp of manners than this guy .

  so original . 
  type more , we will head way up on the statistics in / r/europe . 
  do you guys even bother to read at least couple of comments ? 
  good morning . 
  i told you that you were gon na suck it up . 
  yea yea inferiority complex . 
  lol, 
  eastern thrace is europe . 
  i know it hurts but you will learn to suck it up . 
  there are european , middle eastern , islamist , secular and etc etc etc. 
  turks , kurds , arabs , georgians etc etc etc. 
  in turkey . 
  why would we fucking drop off diversity as long as the citizens are living in their sphere and beliefs without being violent . 
  bitching about erdogan who suppresses others and bitching about multiple identities in a country . 
  that is something you hypocrites can do . 
  lol, 
  turkey is anatolian , more unique than you boring europeans . 
  its just you get butthurt so easily even in this thread which is lightheaded and somehow funny topic . 
  and if spain is europe , western turkey is definitely europe . 
  lol, 
  damn tatars , taking over polish towns . 
  if you are not muslim , why do you have muslim towns ? 
  `` what sort of bullshit do you have to deal with when you meet people outside of your country ? '', 
   why is this in / r/europe ? 
  turkey is not europe . 
  `` backwards '' . 
  apologies if i sounded offensive . 
  cool story bro . 
  i do not want any backwards dutch in my country , we have more than enough pro akp guys here . 
  thank you . 
  have fun . 
  yeah and we attach a direct plane ticket to netherlands . 
  have fun . 
  oh how cute . 
  good to know . 
  now you can start to research how many political parties we have in turkey . 
  why would i want to censor you ? 
  speak your mind , afterall it is great to have a laugh . 
  lol how is the situation with savisaar ? 
  i guess he represents you since he is estonian like you are . 
  send my regards to your putinbot mayor . 
  and eastern europe is relevant to turkey ? 
  that is where the people go from turkey , rest is on your incompetency . 
  yes they were , check your facts and memory . 
  when turkey was one or two days late to open the border gates to refugees due to security reasons , eu was screaming '' barbarians . '', 
  to us . 
  to me it looks like you want to flood turkey with refugees/migrants , not the opposite way . 
  eesti , calm your tits . 
  you are cute and so on but you started to sound ridiculous . 
  are you sure ? 
  ah you disputed it with a column headline which consists of `` may not '' . 
  we fulfill all those responsibilities according to the agreements we are bound to do . 
  even more . 
  so better start to do your own fair share . 
  yeah i laugh at the eu one , indeed . 
  seriously . 
  you can not play the power politics alone in me or hack in the world . 
  countries would seek allies in desperate situations and russia would not complain to have us by their side i presume . 
  and tell me why kicking us out of nato would not hurt you ? 
  seriously . 
  oh really , we do not ? 
  http://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/country.php?id=224 turkey is holding the refugees on the land route , however it is hard to patrol all the aegean coast plus why would we actively prevent everyone while all the countries turning a blind eye to the people who is getting out of their countries ? 
  what decent person ? 
  we are trying to be decent by hosting millions of them and you are throwing tantrums over so called invasion and trying every possible way to get rid of em . 
  decent person ? 
  you meant `` acting stupid '' i guess . 
  why would not we ? 
  and that is why you do n't have approximately 3 millions of them in eu but we do . 
  why should we accept all the unskilled and unwanted refugees and migrants back while we are not even in your union ? 
  we have not stolen any us cultural artifacts . 
  german guys , are you ok with being called goat fuckers by a dutch ? 
  lol, 
  no , you put them back in the eu country from the eu country they escaped to . 
  we are not in the eu , buddy ; by your choice . 
  so , good luck . 
  good . 
  cancel the current one immediately . 
  i would rather call him `` crazy lone wolf '' . 
  sounds cooler . 
  agreed , would rather see you keeping your immigrants/refugees there .
