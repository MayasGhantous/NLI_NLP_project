  good . 
  i hope the current deal will be cancelled as soon as possible . 
  there was robert 's coffee in istanbul couple of years ago , at least 2 of em , i have been to . 
  but i do not know if they are still operating . 
  so i was watching this [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aldllrvgbbc ) and was just curious about the local instruments which would be cool to listen . 
  the instrument in the video is [ kanun ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/qanun_\\ ( instrument \\ ) ) which is a string instrument played in turkey , much of the middle east , central asia , and southeastern europe . 
  afro turks . 
   we are a generation of awakened europeans who havehahahahahahhahah ... https://www.identityevropa.com/#home, 
  they invent this `` the values makes you european . '', 
  because of eastern thrace and cyprus . 
  :d but it gets so messy when europeans themselves go full middle eastern with anti democratic values . 
  lol, 
  armenia and georgia not . 
  turkey is . 
  i dont know who they are but simple googling tells me that apored guy is not turkish . 
  faith no more . 
  suicidal tendencies . 
  watched them live both . 
  mike patton is not human . 
  estonia . 
  met with a person who was living with her mom and keeping the budget completely separated . 
  even the bread loafs and etc. 
   most countries in the west how do you know ? 
  manu chao and mike patton . 
  we have the most interesting case i believe . 
  enes kanter is insanely well known in the country i presume but i would not say in a popular fashion . 
  he is a member of fethullan gulen cult and publicly spoke against erdogan numerous times such as calling him devil , hitler , etc. 
  also his family disowned him . 
   went to a football match in turkey and it 's by far the most racist place i 've ever been . 
  i call this major bullshit . 
  being gay and atheist turk grants a refugee status ? 
  i highly doubt especially if you are turkish since whole other european countries are negative about your kind . 
  taller than average . 
  why ? 
  as far as i know this song is dedicated to one of their ex guitarists ( name \u00dcmit y\u0131lbar ) who died as a martyr in a clash while serving his military duty in 1993 . 
  epic song , sad story . 
  not a metalhead but listen to it . 
  [ pentagram ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtvnzrbs0ac ) [ moribund oblivion ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yophrq8p3zi ) [ cenotaph ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjf4au3cgxm ) [ murder king ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8uz8wltgq ) [ black tooth ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgdb-wnn9cq ), 
  there is absolutely nothing wrong about it . 
  you hear that it is something so alien from the guys who comment `` what is the point to hug/kiss my sister ? '', 
  yes for 3 weeks more , till be\u015fikta\u015f will be the champion of the season . 
  then i will take a break untill next season . 
  yes , a lot . 
  2002 world cup semi final against brazil . 
  freaking el fenomeno with his skills and ridiculous haircut . 
  edit : also ec 2004 qualification playoffs second match vs. latvia , they eliminated us . 
  everyone old enough to remember knows at least one latvian . 
  sounds like a guy who tries to fit in to the environment rather than an actual atheist to be honest . 
  : ) but i can second u/hegekan about delicatessen and plain pork meat difference . 
  i guess we are just not used to the taste of the latter . 
  i second that . 
  looks like [ this ] ( http://www.zeynepinevi.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/13.jpg ) , mostly more or less . 
  and murican rap mostly old school ( bone thugs n harmony for instance ) , never understand the lyrics fully . 
  so it should be counted . 
  : ) edit : oh i forgot the mighty azis from bulgaria . 
  manu chao for me as well and mano negra . 
  european : [ swedish ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggupsrsbbeq ) non - european : [ filipino ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk-tshrze6w ), 
   blaming of the us for any conflict in the world is seriously unintelligent . 
  lol . 
  eesti thinks very highly of himself . 
  as always . 
  we got it , you suffered under soviet occupation and you feel like it is absolute must to bring democracy ( ! ), 
  over oppressors but your lack of empathy towards those countries who got screwed by us interventions , fake coups , puppet governments , etc. 
  is seriously boring . 
  yes . 
  thank you very much !, 
  bonus info : when i tick the `` use subreddit style '' , res does not show me any thread . 
  that is the thing i hate most about this sub . 
  : ) or res i am not sure . 
  i do not give a flying rat 's ass if you are bothered with being called bro . 
  : ) check your post history for your answer , bro . 
  ahahha stalking now , bro ? 
  whole reddit calls your bullshit out , even your own countrymen . 
  so i do n't even bother , talat . 
  wrestling . 
  [ oily one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oil_wrestling ) . 
  rightfully so . 
  xd can you say the same for being a polak nazi ? 
   nazis xd poland flair . 
  of course it does look like gyros . 
  like you germans , greeks have stolen it . 
  / s or not / s. 
  yes it is not . 
  do not buy this pr from germans . 
  it is through and through and turkish dish . 
  so a bit european . 
   simple !, 
  if you want to sustain a 100 % d\u00f6ner based diet , you have to include some vegetables do n't you ? 
  wtf noob ? 
    guess who wins that competition . 
  turkish d\u00f6ner . 
  always . 
   cabbage why man whyy ????

  :p and ayran is the drink with it . 
  so far the best things i have eaten were ; - mussels , fries , beer combo - pork ribs and baked potato combo in belgium . 
  if we can include georgia ; - khacapuri and khinkali .
