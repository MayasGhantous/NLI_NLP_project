  shut the hell up already . 
  you are comical . 
  yeah your same geography knowledge which puts cyprus to europe culturally , right ? 
  lmao like i said . 
   we are the bastion of western values . 
  simple facts . 
  yeah . 
  only a wannabe crusader like you would twist everything on the previous posts and project stuff , gives irrelevant examples and put germany to central and eastern europe . 
  what do you expect from a guy who is from the most irrelevant country in europe . 
  jerking off on reddit . 
  ; ) be gone . 
  surely we are better than you wannabe crusaders . 
  funny that you guys think you are the bastion of western values lmfao . 
  you d be stoning people if you were born in the middle east . 
  you all are the same shit , different birth places . 
   turkey would never surpass central or east european countries in economic success . 
  based on what ? 
  we get that you are a deus vult crusader also belong to holy orthodox brotherhood at the same time but do not underestimate the country under the progressive leadership . 
  your wishful thinking at every thread is boring . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/khachapuri https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/khinkali every georgian restaurant should have those and they are really delicious . 
  stick with the georgian one , they have amazing stuff . 
  the stuff which are much much better than borsch . 
  if this batshit crazy neo sultan gone in the future i hope we can elect a viable government which will dedicate the country to fulfill the ascension process . 
  even tough eu do not let us in , it would be great for the development of the country . 
  still not . 
   biggest nation without a country yeah , no .

  '' , `` how is the situation in turkey ? 
  i basically agreed with you and added to the conversation . 
  good for estonians that they have the most unique language . 
  i guess that is the point ? 
  good , take care . 
  there are some grammatical similarities and some stress similarities while speaking but apart from that it is not very similar . 
  modern day turkish is richer hybrid language than estonian with combinations of different languages and loan words . 
  he wishes that , an average wahhabi is more intelligent than him and her .

  in the thread of `` stuffed turkey . '', 
  lol, 
  but there is only one ragnar . 
  based on my experiences people like you are the ones who always try to escape from duties while serving in the army .

  i know rednecks love their pick ups and gas tanks . 
  if you compare with yourself no doubt we are wittier . 
  generally we are average at best .
