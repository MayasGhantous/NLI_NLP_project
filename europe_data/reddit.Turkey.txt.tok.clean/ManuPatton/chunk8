  our fellow indenosian brothers are just exactly like us ... 
  if only such a country existed . 
  why is it easier for turkey ? 
  muh but it is just a joke . 
  so it is ok . 
  not . 
   `` all muslims are bad . 
   99.8 % of somalis are muslims . 
   somalis are bad because they 're muslims , not because they 're black . 
  there 's no reason to dislike all black people because some of them are muslims . '', 
  so you hate let 's say an icelandic muslim ? 
  agreed , but we have to keep in the mind that they are up to 2 millions of refugees in a very short time in turkey . 
  so state funded homes and benefits ( which actually they have here as well free health care , state funds etc. ), 
  like northern europe is dream for them , both refugees and pro migration europeans have to be grateful to those conditions regarding to the turkey 's own fucked up situation . 
  yeah and most of europe want them to drown in the sea or die on the route . 
  europe is full remember ? 
  really ? 
  eesti , please deal with into nordic . 
  you are funnier at that topic . 
   are n't part of a real nation only god knows , how far these absurde claims can go . 
  be more creative guys , i want to be amazed more by your delusions . 
  have fun with your nukes bud . 
  i am sure you will love them . 
  i guess you have mixed the real life with call of duty or red alert , you can not esc without saving in real life . 
  still was not that horrible , was welcomed whatever the reasons were . 
  because politicians being welcomed is core reason to decide if the country is fucked up or not . 
  so ussr was heaven . 
  so ussr was not that horrible , stalin was welcomed everywhere . 
  no complaints anymore dude . 
   minority students are usually slower top comment my estonian friend . 
  lol, 
  `` yemi\u015f '' means either fruit or nut in turkish actually . 
  why ? 
  indeed . 
  exercising is the huge difference as well as the plain simple white bread consumption i presume .

  me kebab , me no potato . 
  tho please stop choosing slow songs for eurovision . 
  amadeus ribs < 3 . 
  lithuania . 
  trakai castle . 
  also vilnius is the most beautiful baltic city amongst the ones that i have seen so far . 
  ah riiiiight . 
  sure mate , indonasians are also culturally similar to turks . 
  which part of turkey is much more similar ? 
  culture varies a lot within the border of turkey . 
  i am pretty sure that they can fit into slovakian migrant or refugee ghettos or camps culturally as well . 
  so take them you maybe ? 
  lol . 
  well syria , eritrea and afghanistan is pretty much the lands of war and opression at the moment . 
  so `` deculturation '' in turkey is not important as long as you pay less . 
  yeah mate , sure send more . 
  and left or forced to leave ? 
  direct affect of islamization of europe or is it just people leaving religious traditions or turning to atheism ? 
  are you against other holy religions as well ? 
  because i assume that all of them are against homosexuality ? 
  or are you picking one particular religion for any reason ? 
   de-christianization is finally happening really curious , where is this happening ? 
  / no s. 
  standards ? 
  which standards ? 
  never seen . 
  i do not know about estonian politicans too much but you know ours steal way way more than iphone . 
  he fits in erdogan 's party in that aspect . 
  ( well technically he is not associated with akp anymore but just technically . ), 
  i do not need any other extra reason . 
  just for fun . 
  you are welcome . 
  thanks for proving my point , that you are stubborn and bigot as much as those nutjobs . 
  well i am sorry but you are wrong again mate . 
  yet they have those nutjobs in even texas . 
  better deport them to texas and they can get shot happily , forever . 
  sadly i do not live there . 
  but `` i am from antioch . '', 
  i am on an exile for aaa long time already , and currently living abroad . 
  last time when i had been to my hometown was two years ago , and to be honest at that time i did not feel a difference . 
  but from what i read online and hear from the relatives now , yes there is increasing refugee numbers as well as camouflage dressed militas who are crossing borders in and out regularly . 
  ( thanks mr. sultan erdo\u011fan . ), 
  [ ancient antioch ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antioch ) / [ modern day hatay/antakya ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hatay_province ) . 
  well it really is actually however we still want to believe what you said there . 
  but if you try to look objectively at reddit there is huge anti russia and turkey trend going on . 
  i mean i do not give a single damn about downvotes but i do not have to express myself always `` oh yeah i am anti erdo\u011fan , we are sailing towards being islamic dictatorship . '' , etc. 
  on the irrevelant discussions . 
  because people always mention erdo\u011fan when they are lack of argument or simply try to provoke you , or whatever is going on their mind . 
  and for the real life in europe i do not want to even start . 
  lol, 
  i did not take the map seriously , if it was a serious topic i could have agreed that our state is well 3rd world tier ( sad but true , i am not in a denial ) . 
  but if someone tought it was well put list and only questioned turkey , i would not think he or she was not biased . 
  [ find this ] ( http://www.playriga.com/assets/images/food/karums_cheese.jpg ) , eat and pray for latvians for such a good stuff and independence . 
  and obama 's usa belongs ? 
  oh you will bash me for usa but all those south american countries ? 
  lol russia ? 
  it says bestest nations fyi . 
  why not ? 
  seems like uk invented the word , til after a brief googling . 
  thanks for pointing out . 
  tho i was just teasing . 
  what were you thinking when you called the game `` football '' while you are mostly playing it with your hands ? 
  soccer just hurts too much .
