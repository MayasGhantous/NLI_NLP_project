  says the one who started to curse over a sarcastic question . 
  which was so obvious and except you everyone got it . 
   your english is quite off and because of the lack of social skills and language deficiency , you decide to use the word `` fucking '' to emphasize each sentence . 
  i love how easily you are to trigger , basing your nonsense argument on a single comment . 
  lol you are a complete joke . 
  i am so not willing to discuss with a person who lacks some very basic manners . 
  do not come into my sight again , please . 
  what the hell are you snorting or smoking ? 
  bonsai , as it is the latest trend in turkey ? 
  improve your comprehension skills . 
  stop fucking labeling everyone , you are no different than motherfucking erdo\u011fan and his loyal dogs . 
  better ? 
  guess you need to fucking hear aggressive tone and curses to be able to understand stuff . 
  lol is not he glorious sultan ? 
  do not you see his holy highness ??? 
   i actually assumed that he would answer like you did but he didn \u00b4 t. 
  lol hillarious . 
  i am done with your ignorance . 
  well dude if you are ignorant about a stuff , the legit way is shutting your fucking mouth , not making assumptions about someting that you do not know . 
  believe me , you are not a normal human being . 
  so do i. believeing in magic and being stupid is subjective . 
  now prove that i have slaguhtered others . 
  oh boy , you can not . 
  because unless you , my life motive is not hatred . 
  your question is not legit since you consider all the muslims as loony killers , he is cool according to your norms , i am not . 
  period . 
  they can if they are as much as biggot as you are . 
  dude i do not want to escalade the stuff here ; but seriously since you did this ama , you do not have to answer all those islamophobic , racist stuff . 
  just saying . 
  because tax . 
  not european tho curious , how are the opinions from your fellow countrymen about our glorious president/sultan erdo\u011fan ? 
  ok , thank you . 
  are you fearing being minority under some certain ethnicity and culture ? 
  or speaking hypothetically , would you feel the same when the large number of ukranian refugees came to estonia or high skilled economical immigrants from western countries had been the majority ? 
  i do not claim that we are europeans but there is this ;  the treaty admitted the ottoman empire to the european concert , and the powers promised to respect its independence and territorial integrity . 
  treaty of paris ( 1856 ) we have been relevant to europe more than tunisia and morocco , etc. 
  and those culturally european countries . 
  okay.thanks . 
  i am not judging but i see that you are against taking refugees or immigrants . 
  why ? 
  estonia has one of the lowest numbers among eu . 
  we could not . 
  you ever heard of double check to be sure ? 
  have you ? 
  thank you . 
  here not the union itself . 
  ignorant about pisa here . 
  does this mean that every student in those different countries take the same level of ( or precisely same ) exam ? 
  it is more surprise to me that eu is pro putin now lol . 
   deported but not massacred . 
  nor had genocide committed against them . 
  apologies , i misread your sentence . 
  4 millions of people only in bengal famine , not so awful mate right ? 
  out of all those moronic `` honor killings '' that turks and kurds commited , you found out the homicide done by non turkish citizen ? 
  you deserve a fucking stupidity medal my friend . 
  because 5 years old ottoman kid was invader and deserved to die . 
  same rhetoric when it comes to non turk/muslim , it is the sicentific truth . 
  when we say the same thing `` butthurt nationalist turk . 
  '' , `` invaders must die . '' . 
  some europeans here are delusional , can not even realise their racism and xenophobia . 
  and that will provide him more support with a reason of `` west wants to destroy us . '', 
  just like putin does . 
  he pulled that card a lot already and still doing . 
  i am not saying that you should not raise your voice and criticise him but at the end turkish people have to wake up and realise that this guy is by the lightest term a thief who is stealing their future . 
  well you got ta keep in the mind that turkey is culturally very mixed and different according to the geogrophical location , hack even to the neighborhood in the cities . 
  east of turkey is pretty conservative compare to west , tho even in the west some families who consider themselves relatively modern can be upset when they hear let 's say their kid is non-religious but eventually will accept ( also experienced this from the first hand ; brother considers himself as an atheist , mom was tried to convince him but she gave up ) . 
  well government is as we know religious nutjobs , they are opressing everyone who is not on their side . 
  to sum up , on the behalf of my observation yes there is a pressure on non religious people in turkey . 
  some can disagree me tho . 
  your reading comprehension is really sharp . 
  is not it ? 
  lol idiot . 
  there was this french guy who was literally trying to explain how they improved algeria and north africa throughout the history . 
  got upvoted like hell and no one told that he was justifying imperialism . 
  bro it is crystal clear that some europeans here are nothing but hypocrites when it comes to politics and their history . 
  and i am amazed that baltic states ( especially estonian and lithuanian flairs . ), 
  are so passionate about being anti immigration or bashing the asylum seekers . 
  i mean they have literally the lowest numbers among eu . 
  yes there is . 
  it means that shit on turks at every possible occasion to get upvote . 
  with the help of treshold and corrupted elections they are the rulers . 
  they were always under the 50 % of the votes which technically is not majority . 
  but i get your point unfortunately despite all the shit that he is pulling through he has too much support , yes . 
  ( on the other hand at the presidental elections he got over 50 % yes . ), 
  is this danish ? 
  for the love of zlatan . 
  some turkish ones that i like .

  that is a joke right ? 
  the number of syrian refugees in turkey is up to 1.8 millions . 
  how about this ? 
  yep . 
  i am sorry mate but we truly belong there . 
  you know what is better ? 
  when the daughters of the minister of finance own the company which install all the cameras throughout the country . 
  ( around 2010 . ), 
  living in estonia for almost 3 years . 
  winter is much better than summer . 
  dude please go back and read again and realise , i have not insulted your country . 
  for god 's sake if only i would insult to estonia as much as i do to my own country and government , i guess you would hang me up in vabaduse valjak .
