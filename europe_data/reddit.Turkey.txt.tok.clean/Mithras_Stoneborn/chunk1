i guess this makes the iguana waiting at the top putin . 
  i am all for creating the united states of istanbul . 
  gagauz and turkish people have 80-90 % mutual intelligibility . 
  their turkish dialect stems from anatolia . 
  the most plausible theory about the origin of the gagauz people is that they are seljuk turks from the [ sultanate of rum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sultanate_of_rum ) . 
  they were named after [ kaykaus ii ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kaykaus_ii ) who brought these people to their current country because of mongol pressure . 
  byzantine emperor oversaw the settlement of these people to dobruja . 
  the relationship between byzantine empire and sultanate of rum is one of the most understudied subjects . 
  the traditional narrative says that these two states were in constant holy warfare but this must be no more than a nationalistic fable . 
  there was an unbelievable cooperation between them despite the wars they fought . 
  both states have religiously mixed populations . 
  sultanate of rum employed byzantine statesmen in the bureaucracy and did not prevent byzantine missionary activities in anatolia . 
  that explains the existence of a turkic orthodox population in anatolia called [ karamanlides ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/karamanlides ) ( although greek version of history insists that these were ethnic greeks who went through linguistic assimilation ) . 
  i wonder how this graph would change if we also throw in the weed smoking . 
  i agree . 
  bulgaria expulsed hundreds of thousands of turks in the 80s and 90s . 
  as a result , we gained many skilled workers we needed and the economy of bulgaria regressed . 
  not cool poland . 
  [ we 've waited for your deputy for more than a century ] ( http://poloniaottomanica.blogspot.com.tr/2014/02/where-is-deputy-of-lehistan.html ) . 
  we also refused to yield your embassy in turkey to the nazi germany after they invaded you . 
  edit : another gem . 
  in the first half of 19th century , fighters and refugees from many polish uprisings and revolutions were accepted to turkey . 
  they founded a village as / u/formtestudo pointed out . 
  among those refugees , there were polish officers accepted to the turkish army . 
  one of them was konstanty borz\u0119cki who converted to islam and took the name [ mustafa celalettin pasha ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mustafa_celalettin_pasha ) . 
  he was great grandfather to two great turkish poets , one of whom was the famous [ naz\u0131m hikmet ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/n%c3%a2z%c4%b1m_hikmet ) . 
   its not terrible its good , but their whole economy remains based on primary resource extraction . 
  selling gas , oil , wheat , iron etc  much much more money would be in selling iphones , banking services , and even vodka made from wheat . 
  you can not eat iphones though . 
   turku ( `` town square '' ) good to know . 
  now we can claim all the town squares :d, 
  turku belongs to the turks . 
  gib back pls . 
  as a turk , i hate the global capitalists stealing the properties rightfully belonging to greek people . 
   millet system was evil . 
  from my point of view , the french revolution was evil . 
  you forgot several important points like : * the public in the west was extremely weary of war . 
  so , uk could not raise enough public support to send additional troops to supress the turkish resistance movement . 
  canada and australia , for the first time , objected to the crown and refuse to participate in fighting additional wars in turkey . 
  so the british had to resort to the greeks to use them as the enforcers of sevres . 
  * france and italy were very dissatisfied with the british getting the best share of the spoils . 
  that is why the french and italian authorities in the occupied constantinople turned blind eye to the smuggling of weapons to anatolia from constantinople . 
  they even secretly helped the turkish national movement to the spite of the british . 
  yeah , who are we to stop the migrants ? 
  let us leave them free . 
  if all 3 million of them want to go to the wealthiest countries in europe to feed on the sociel benefits , so be it . 
  it is a good thing . 
  these people are needed to rebuild syria . 
  if syria loses majority of its intelligentia , what do you think will happen to the society left behind ? 
  besides , it is extremely hypocritical for us or eu countries to blame turkey for cherry picking the `` good ones '' , while they are doing the same thing . 
  [ montreux convention regarding the regime of the straits ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/montreux_convention_regarding_the_regime_of_the_straits )  non-black sea state warships in the straits must be under 15,000 tons . 
  no more than nine non-black sea state warships , with a total aggregate tonnage of no more than 30,000 tons , may pass at any one time , and they are permitted to stay in the black sea for no longer than ** twenty-one days ** . 
  given enough money , everyone turns into an idiot . 
  both eu and nato as we know them will cease to exist . 
  nato will turn into a us-uk alliance with nordic countries . 
  maybe it can still keep nederlands and belgium . 
  eu will turn into a franco-germano-italian power block . 
  this block will have good relationship with russia . 
  balkan and baltic states will be left alone to fend for themselves . 
  goodbye nato ( at least as we know it ) . 
  crappy article . 
  there is almost no discrimination against black people in turkey . 
  in fact , there is a general sympathy towards them . 
  `` zenci '' is not meant to be pejorative in turkish . 
  `` skin racism '' is a western construct which did not take root in turkey . 
   a highly developed and stable eu member which went through a terrible economic crisis and illegally confiscated the money of its citizens . 
  thank you but i 'll pass . 
  no one buys the shit that cyprus is a highly developed and stable eu member . 
  you are right . 
  it is not * absolutely haram * . 
  there is no consensus among the scholars on the subject of women imams . 
  the most tolerant view is that women can lead prayers for a community of women . 
  by the way , there * is * a wide consensus that it is not compulsory for women to join friday prayers , which is a must for men . 
  absolutely haram . 
  nato is in a serious crisis . 
  us/uk want their hegemony to continue but france and germany are trying to get free of the shackles . 
  all it takes is a big fella to leave nato and it will have a domino effect that will dismantle nato . 
  nobody wants to be that big fella who makes the first step and `` ruins all '' . 
  enter turkey . 
  us/uk always wanted eu to take turkey but france/germany rejected it . 
  now , it is obvious that turkey will never jointhe eu , which is the primary reason why uk wanted out of eu . 
  great powers are realigning . 
  fun fact : there are no words for the days of the week in old turkic because the concept of week was introduced after turkic peoples converted to islam . 
  modern turkic days of the week were borrowed from persian . 
  similarly , old turkic language does not have the words for 12 months of the year . 
  what the old turkic people had was their own version of the 12-year cyclic calendar similar to the chinese . 
  below is an example of dating from the [ orkhon inscriptions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/orkhon_inscriptions ) ( 8th century ) :  i gathered my turks , my nation and established the power . 
  after establishing the power , my father , the kagan , died ( litr . 
  flied away ) on ** the twenty sixth day of the tenth month of the dog year ** . 
  on ** the seventeenth day of the first month of the boar year ** we mourned over bukug tutuk ... ...  kultegin passed away ( lit . 
  : ` flew away to tengri ' ) on ** the seventeenth day of the sheep year ** . 
  we held ( his ) funeral on ** the twenty-seventh day of the ninth month ** . 
  we finished his mausoleum , the statues and paintings , and his inscription stone on ** the twenty-seventh day of the seventh month , in the monkey year ** . 
  kultegin was at age of forty-seven . 
  the tuygun elteber brought all of these sculptors and painters . 
  yes . 
  we have lots of vowels . 
  and cookies . 
  and kebab . 
  american imperialism should not be allowed to sneak into the caucauses .
