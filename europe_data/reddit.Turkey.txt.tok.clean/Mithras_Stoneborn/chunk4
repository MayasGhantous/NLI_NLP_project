  and here we are . 
   arresting tens of thousands of individuals ** without cause ** you have no idea what you are talking about . 
  turkish people are fully aware of the extent of the gulenist infiltration . 
  the state have been working for years to decipher gulenists . 
  they are only recently uncovering encrypted secret apps through which gulenists have been communicating . 
  one such medium has 40.000 people with national id 's saved in the database . 
   do you have any evidence at all that the us was behind this coup ? 
  without the backing of cia , this gulen guy ( who is a preacher who barely graduated from primary school ) could have never created a netwwork which is organized in 150 + countries world wide and governing some 200 billion $ of business . 
  the coup was excellent and it looks like it should have had at least several years of planning and perfecting . 
  the reason why this plan failed ( which was a close thing ) is that they had to start early and they failed to foresee the reaction of turkish people . 
  correction : us did not expect the coup would have failed . 
   probably because that 's what your state run media is telling you ? 
  state run media has nothing to do with this . 
  even the fierce opposition parties are with erdogan now . 
  people who didnot fear critizing erdogan harshly in 14 july are with erdogan now . 
   if we sponsored your coup , it would have succeeded . 
  you have shitloads of failed coups in your cv . 
   at the very least , erdogen would have been shot down as he was circling the airport for a good hour . 
  and you would create the second iran in the region , but much more dangerous than the first . 
   i 'd sure like one of you fanatical erdogen supporters to explain to me what we would get from sponsoring a coup . 
  you would get a puppet ruler who would do as you command . 
  just look back and tell me since when erdogan is depicted as a dictator in your media . 
  that is the time erdogan started acting against your interests . 
  because you know , us does not have any problems working with authoritarian islamist dictators , as saudi arabia proves . 
  times change . 
  against a crusading block , i am sure that turkey and iran will be on the same page . 
  of course turkey has to kick nato out first . 
  because 99.9 % of the turkish people see this failed coup as directed by cia . 
  probably your biased western media does not report the unification of the turkish people and the rise of anti-americanism in turkey after the coup . 
  this coup was aimed to destroy our independence . 
  in addition , this coup was a cornerstone in us plans to dismantle turkey and create kurdistan/armenia in eastern turkey . 
  the truth is revealed and turkish people say that enough is enough . 
  we are done with so-called `` allies '' who are trying to divide our country . 
  if you think that we can not do without nato , you do not know anything about turkish people . 
  i guess this same mistake is done by the cia experts who were expecting the coup to succeed . 
   but yeah , somebody wrong getting them , would still mean a high risk of abuse , even with deactivated ones . 
  * when * turkey leaves nato , it will simply tell us to pack their gear up and leave . 
  imagine western turkey airbases loaded with russian nukes . 
  those are the nukes that you should fear . 
   but it does need to keep the strategic alliance with turkey going if us wants to be our allies , it should stop betraying our alliance and staging coups against our elected leaders . 
  any small country in the balkans that accepts nuclear weapons would be fools . 
  that makes them potential battlefronts between two titans and it only helps to get them squashed . 
  turkey can afford to keep nuclear weapons but not small countries like greece or bulgaria , especially against russians . 
  by the way , do people not realize that fact that both greece and bulgaria are more pro-russian than pro-west ? 
  us and the west are not our allies . 
  they betrayed our alliance by carrying out black propoganda against erdogan and staging this latest coup . 
  we do not need you . 
  please gtfo of our country asap . 
  trump hands merkel a # 300 billion invoice for nato defense . 
  merkel refuses to pay in cash and offers greece instead . 
  it seems like trump will be content with greece . 
  eastern roman empire made an alliance with the [ turkic khaganate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkic_khaganate ) against the sasanian empire . 
  they exchanged envoys and since the turkic khaganate acquired a strong grip on the silk road , it should not be surprising to find byzantine coins from the second half of the 6th century in the region where the western turkic khaganate ruled . 
  actually you should have said `` up the nile '' . 
  and ottoman empire was very much involved in the politics of the horn of africa . 
  judging by the names only ; nikola and kosti were of greek , ardash and manol were of armenian , h\u00fcsn\u00fc was of arab and osman was of turkish origin . 
  that is the usual lighting . 
  this historic part of amasya was restored to be a popular tourist destination . 
  at the front , you see the ottoman era houses which are basically the same as you have in albania . 
  at the back , you can see the rock tombs of pontic kings dating from about 200 bc . 
  the famous roman geographer strabo was a native of amasya .

   no thanks for fucks sake , stop fuelling separatists . 
  i am sure that many ottoman officers in 19th century said this . 
   i believe we should grant them asylum in exchange for military intelligence . 
  why do n't you skip the foreplay and declare war on turkey ? 
  did she also `` explain '' how she violated the very same convention by the infamous agreement with turkey ? 
  then why do us/eu try to unite cyprus while trying to divide everywhere else ? 
  the last ceasefire was sabotaged by pentagon when they deliberately bombed saa positions and killed nearly 100 regime soldiers . 
  these soldiers were defending their position against isis . 
  soon after the pentagon 's airstrike , isis started a major offensive ( as if they were aware of the coming air strike by pentagon ! ), 
  and nearly captured the area which is under siege for years and still held by the regime . 
  who is keeping their promises now ? 
  [ gasser m1870 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gasser_m1870 )  the title ` montenegrin gasser ' covers a variety of six-chamber large calibre revolvers . 
  ** in 1910 king nicholas i of montenegro proclaimed that all male citizens were the militia and had a right and a duty to own a gasser pattern revolver . 
  ** the standard issue in the montenegrin military was the austrian gasser model 1870 in 11.2 mm which became known as the montenegrin gasser . 
  the sudden demand was met by producers in austria , belgium and spain . 
  montenegrin revolvers originally appeared as open-frame models , similar to the austrian gasser m1870 and usually in 11mm nominal ( 11.3 mm actual ) calibers . 
  single and double-action locks were used , grips were often in ivory or bone , engraving and gold inlay work was common , and the predominant impression was one of weight and bulk . 
  later montenegrin revolvers offered hinged-frame construction , with galand cylinder locks and a self-extracting mechanism . 
  most are marked ` guss stahl ' ( crucible cast steel frame ) , ` kaiser 's patent ' and similar phrases . 
  in turkey , this revolver was and still is known as `` karada\u011f tabancas\u0131 '' ( meaning montenegrin revolver ) . 
  according to the witnesses , the shooter said `` you will die here just like we die in syria '' and shot him . 
  seems like it is a vengeful act related to syrian rebels and their defeat at aleppo . 
  edit : the shooter is still inside and the police is carrying out an operation . 
  the entire turkish media went nuts . 
  many gunfires are being reported . 
  i hope the shooter is caught alive and both states act in unison to unravel this attack . 
  true . 
  also turkish republic refused to submit the polish embassy in ankara to the germans after they invaded poland during wwii , unlike austrian and czech embassies .

  hdp is not the only party kurds vote . 
  in fact , akp gets more kurdish votes than hdp . 
  majority of the kurds in turkey are conservative and religious , well above the average of turkey . 
  most of the religious leaders ( not necessarily kurdish ones ) come from the east and south east of turkey where kurds are prominent . 
  this has something to do with geography too because those places are natural extensions of middle east although in turkey . 
  there has always been a fundamental difference between turkish islam and arabic islam .
