it 's pretty obvious . 
  only thing is that erdogan is actually in power and has the means to remain in power , possibly indefinately . 
  whatever bro . 
  i do n't think i shitposted too hard . 
  obviously all african states are either dictatorships or completely fallen apart . 
   lol far right agitators , jesus christ . 
  there 's no way people who think like you actually exist . 
  there 's just no way anyone is that mentally deficient . 
  sick contribution bro . 
  lucky you deleted the rest of your brainmelting comments so people wo n't see how dumb you are . 
  oh were n't you deleting your comment just now ? 
   there 's no way people who think like you actually exist . 
  there 's just no way anyone is that mentally deficient . 
  funny , i think the same about you . 
  ad hominems are the only thing coming our of your comments . 
  expected of a trump ape . 
  why ca n't african countries have freedom of press ? 
  honestly it 's either this or specific national subs . 
  with us or against us ? 
  across the aegean too ? 
  just pay us and we 'll build it for you . 
  can we have estonia instead ? 
  what 's his res tag ? 
  yes i did . 
  i commonly initiate conversations with far-right agitators and they always lead somewhere after the initial shower of insults . 
  quite frankly i am dissapointed . 
  i hope you 're happy . 
  your bluetext literally links to `` jordanian occupation of the west bank '' , i do n't think the emphasis is on jordanian at all . 
  well , he ca n't ( yet ) put people in prison simply for disagreeing with him . 
  they need to do something insulting first . 
  it 's an old law too , turkey is atleast 25 % fascist . 
  huh ? 
  go to r/turkey and see if people do n't make fun of erdogan . 
  my condolences . 
  no , you need sultan erdogan , islam and turkish as the official language . 
  seriously though , how the fuck can any country have almost as bad press freedom as turkey ? 
  we are trying to make things better here , not much worse . 
  he knows that there 'd be a coup or popular uprising if he tried anything like that . 
  even in his own party , atleast 50 % are in favour of secularism . 
  uh , under ... yknow ... us . 
  as expected . 
  he would n't survive attacking secularism . 
  edit : fixed dumb spelling error . 
  europe is a product of homo sapiens sapiens imperialism !, 
  neanderthals # 1 , humans go back to africa !! 111 !!!, 
  you again ? 
  do you always post on anything related to islam or muslims ? 
  nope , bigotry is applying the same viscious stereotypes to 1.6 billion people . 
  vitriolic bigotry then . 
  what he means is that his examples are not like `` french people eat baguette and like wine , honhonhon '' , they are hateful . 
  dunno if his examples are relevant to the discussion though . 
  you simply could n't answer him , so you pulled the racist card card . 
  that 's what you took issue with ? 
  not the isis bullshit ? 
  ** crickets **, 
  before looking stupid , please read the study . 
   only 13 % of arab youths said they could imagine themselves supporting isis even if it did not use much violence ,  ** even if it did not use much violence , ** oh yeah fucking flawless logic incoming :  no , not all arabs , only 13 % . 
  but because of that 13 % , it 's not worth having that 87 % , as if that 87 % does not have cultural/identity issues that are anti-european . 
  tell me how exactly the 87 % are responsible for the 13 % again ? 
  should other continents ban europeans because some are nazis ? 
  of course not , this logic only applies to groups ** you ** do n't like . 
  yes , let 's discriminate against the remaining 87 % !, 
  remember kids , all arabs are isis sympathizers !, 
  seems about right . 
  although they didi n't ask about the countries that turks would actually like . 
  like south korea , japan and pakistan . 
  not doing it right mate . 
  ehm , i suggest you actually take a look at the dna studies . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/genetic_history_of_the_turkish_people  as a result , several studies have concluded that the indigenous peoples of anatolia are the primary source of the present-day turkish population , [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] in addition to contributions from neighboring peoples , [ 1 ] from the caucasus , balkans , and the near east , [ 8 ] i do n't see very many asian-looking turks , do you ? 
  is this a right-winger who understands the difference between turks and arabs ? 
  what the fuck ? 
  how the fuck are they advancing islam ? 
  nice isis logic . 
  and then the backlash gets a backlash and so on . 
  vojvodina annexed to hungary next ? 
  the ancestors of the turks were there though . 
  what should he fear then ? 
  the statistical billion to once chance that he will die in a terror attack or the guaranteed possiblity that it will advance the most muderous ideology known to man ? 
  but will no one think of the fellow countrymen ?!?!, 
  what is a few million jews/gypsies/lefties dead against a few of my fellow countrymen !, 
  clearly you ca n't do both , am i right ?!, 
  no , clearly you are pro-isis if you do n't ignore discrimination and racial backlash . 
  this thread is just alt-right saying they would vote for the left if they had the same xenophobic paintbrushing skillz as them . 
  that 's the point of the left , not dividing people and pointing fingers at all muslims for everything bad that happens . 
  he didi n't get elected because he promised to round up his political opponents , he was much more liberal and sane back then than trump is today . 
  u.s right now is just turkey in 2002 . 
  uh , what ? 
  we have 3 million syrian refugees ... 
  erdogan never wanted to ban people from his country . 
  tbh we 're not actual turks . 
  real oghuz turks originated from the transbaikal area , northeast of mongolia . 
   serbia, 
  i feel less ashamed of turkey now . 
  60 % upvoted . 
  lol, 
  nice , not typical of u/electro-n to draw damning statistics about turkey from his ass . 
  recent erdogan-affiliated polls have shown his public support climbed to about 53 % after the coup . 
  where the fuck did you get 70-75 % from ? 
  executing millions ? 
  yeah great idea , everybody will leave and turkey will basically be erdogan 's private peninsula .
