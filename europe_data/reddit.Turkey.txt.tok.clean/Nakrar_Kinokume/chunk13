  no , i was replying to ** sanctioning ** us , how about you actually read my comment and its parent before you go off on some rant ? 
  the guy seems to think the e.u can nuke istanbul if we do n't keep the refugees or something . 
   alright i 'll concede the point . 
  if turkish people want to move to europe i 'm super cool with them moving to countries that have somewhat similar cultural background where they would fit in and assimilate into majority culture without any considerable problems . 
  100 % support you guys moving to the balkans if you wish to do so . 
   especially since you got a sphere there and everything . 
  well , i do n't think any turks would move there , especially since its poorer . 
  the only turks moving to europe right now are young liberal turks who are tired of turkey , and this is a very small amount . 
  more people moving the other way , in fact . 
  also , ** we ** do n't have a sphere there , it 's our shared sphere due to byzantine and ottoman empires both having their cores in the southern balkans and anatolia . 
   if you wish to move into other european states that are culturally distinct from your own then i 'd be very picky on who to let in because of same cultural similarity you share with ex-ottoman countries is something that you do not share with norwegians for example . 
  you will stand out and you will stand out hard as a foreigner and as a muslims . 
  it 's double whammy basically so people who are let in need to be vetted in as being the `` right type '' of people . 
  usually well educated , secular and who want to come into these countries to make a better life and leave the past one with majority of their culture behind . 
  right , if you 're vetting people for the right values and high education , you need to do the same for everyone . 
  and most east europeans would probably not be even let in to the country , considering how racist they are . 
  the ones that are n't are fine . 
    i 'm not for kicking anyone . 
  what 's done is done . 
  but i do think that eu got bloated to fast and my eu would most likely be at least 4-6 countries lighter than it is today . 
  was n't even the point i was making . 
  start reading and replying to actual points instead of strawmanning shit . 
  i 'm talking within context of imigration . 
  the whole discussion is in context of imigration because turkey within eu makes as much sense as russia within nato . 
  so from perspective of imigration . 
  imigration . 
  eu was formed to shield against turkey ? 
  i know europe hates us but let 's not get too extreme here . 
  i have no idea what `` imigration '' is , perhaps you meant immigration ? 
  two m 's . 
   from perspective of imigration being a nationalistic venomous shit outside of your borders is a shitter behavior . 
  if you wave the crecent flag , if you talk shit about the country you are currently living in and praise the erdo land while living outside of turkey like in scandinavia you are being a shitter . 
  unless it is in a cultural context for the lol 's , like irish americans in the u.s or something . 
  otherwise , well yeah you 're being shitty , duh . 
   if you are being nationalistic within borders of your own country then you 're not really doing anything out of line , no ? 
  i do n't need to agree with the religious angle or occasional racism but maybe to you being proud of your country and waving the flag of your nation is something to be shunned and rediculed right but to me it 's just healthy nationalism . 
  nationalism is never healthy , do n't confuse it with patriotism . 
  nationalism is about your culture , race and people , it leads to hatred and genocide . 
  patriotism is pride of your country , and everyone in it ( including immigrants ) . 
   i also do n't care how you rate eastern europe since i do n't live there nor care about it beyond occassional argument from position of better knowlage through language and culture . 
  good for you , really . 
   technically russia is part of `` europe '' and i still do n't consider it as european nation . 
  would n't want it part of eu either . 
  would vet people who want to imigrate out of there more rigurously likewise . 
  that 's your problem mate , they are part of europe whether you want it or not . 
  you ca n't just decide they are uneuropean because they occupied your country , lol . 
   yes i 'm liberal minded . 
  in that i do n't consider skin color and ethnic background of a person as really important factors . 
  culture on the other hand , ideology they have and religious upbringing are of paramount importance . 
  i 'm for equality under law within national borders and for almost complete freedom of speech . 
  this is why i 'm so dead set on having imigration being more rigurous . 
  because once you let people in by law you ca n't prevent and should n't prevent them from being complete intollerable pain in the ass or downright subversive elements within society . 
  i view that same society should strive to help people within it who are truly in need or who life has dealt bad cards . 
  i do n't think it should be super strict though , just make sure they are n't racists/bigots or have a problem with people 's religions or beliefs , and they wo n't cause any trouble . 
  also no way you 're liberal . 
  maybe in saudi arabia you would be liberal . 
   sounds about alt right to you ? . 
  sounds right-wing for sure , i do n't know your exact positions , but it could be normal or you could be a bigot . 
  clearly you do n't know much about turkey though , yet you are filled with opinions about us . 
   also the point about blue eyed thing was that i could probably pass for a local while being from elsewhere but i still stand out in mannerism , in thought process and approach to problem solving from a local . 
  someone from even more distinctive cultural background will stand out twice as much . 
  hair color , eye color has nothing to do with it . 
  i can definitely tell when someone is slavic/east european . 
  you seem to be an okay guy , but most east europeans ( especially hungarians ) would n't fit in the west , considering their rampant racism . 
  in fact , russians are better in that regard , even if it 's really bad . 
   in what ways you say . 
  not willing to work while being hired through quotas because it 's a womans job . 
  not willing to do something because they feel like they 're better than a local who slaves at the same job . 
  being culturally exclusive to own little circle of ideologically and religiously similar kind with intent of building a piece of homeland in another populations lands that allow them to stay . 
  how is this applicable to turks ? 
  i mean yeah , the turks in europe are from eastern turkey , which might aswell be the middle east , with less sharia , but on what grounds do you accuse turks of thinking they 're better than germans ? 
  some probably do , but alot more germans think they 're better than us . 
  i do n't think german turks want to form their own country within germany either . 
  where in ee you from btw ? 
  edit : didi n't see a part lol . 
  why not ? 
  because some ( or most , depending on the definition ) muslims are white . 
  sanction us for what exactly ? 
  there is no basis in international law for forcing us to take refugees . 
  we , unlike eu countries , have no legal obligation to take refugees since we didi n't sign anything . 
   its like asking the turks to give anatolia back to greeks , turks = turkified ( byzantine ) anatolians . 
  so that does n't even make sense since anatolia was hellenized but never truly greek . 
  muslims ca n't be genocided !, 
  downvoted and blocked . 
  did you really just use white to refer to non-muslim ? 
  you mean kurds ? 
   turkey is not europe , rip eastern thrace . 
   the problem with that is it places the responsibility solely on europeans , still . 
  which is the mentality we need to break who is placing the responsibility on europeans ? 
  it 's the government that is expected to solve problems in society , not individuals . 
  how the hell is this relevant ? 
  i do n't want to kick out all foreigners but i do n't want them living in my freaking home either . 
  why should they believe there is an added risk of harm to themselves ? 
  is n't it called masis in armenian ? 
   at no point did i state that it 's incompatible . 
  it 's got it 's cultural and religious differences that make it distinctively more different and less compatible with european states . 
  but it 's not incompatible . 
  just meens that there needs to be more vigilance about who gets to come in . 
  again with these `` european states '' . 
  ex-ottoman countries are much closer to turkey culturally than to iceland .
