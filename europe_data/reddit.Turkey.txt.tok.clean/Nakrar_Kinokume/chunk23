   besides , you do not need to lie , everyone can simply see what i have added and what not . 
  i do not need to make anything `` look '' better , i am not worried about my looks accordig to some nobodies on reddit . 
  again , i just found it funny that you would attempt to hide your edit by adding a seperate `` edit '' part filled with meaningless drivel . 
   but you are free to quote my `` psychotic rage '' i would be intrested in reading that . 
  didi n't save it , sorry . 
   again , you did not even answer or presented any critical thinking about my points , all you have to say is `` but murica '' `` but not all ... '' , `` but you are a psycho '' . 
  okay then . 
  i answered all your points with studies . 
  you are currently attempting to distract from this . 
   it is not mu strange math , it is litteraly the outcome of the election , voting for satan and then answering `` sure i want liberal cute teddy bears walking around '' is not quite thr same statement . 
  i can also vote for hitler and claim i am actually i fav , of a secularist liberal party , does ' t mean much if i keep on voting for hitler thou . 
  i 'm telling you that there was a study that literally asked turks if they prefered a strong leader over a strong democracy , and most said no . 
   you asked why i think a society that votes for super islamistic fahists is backwards , i gave you an answer . 
  it is not too comolicated even if you like to make it seem like 50 % of a society voting for a backwards party is `` totally normal and fine '' . 
  if erdogan is a `` super islamistic fahist '' whatever that means , what is saudi arabia ? 
  seems like your scale of islamist starts at `` super '' . 
   most of the 15 million live on the asian part . 
  the tard literally thinks the population of turkey is 15 million . 
  and somehow he thinks the turks from thrace are n't real `` europeans '' . 
  typical american beliefs , his only interaction with our history has been from / pol / . 
  so sick of these people . 
  i do n't understand how `` retake constantinople '' could mean anything else than the violent reversal of turkish istanbul . 
  that would be genocide . 
  we are sooo sick of these comments , and the nerve of all of you , you just turn around and say `` well no i actualy dont men genociede hehe just jok '' , every single one of you always say the same shit . 
  i would be alot more comfortable with these anti-erdogan threads if they didi n't always end in genocidal `` jokes '' . 
   being racist in r/europe  latino name sigh ... 
  huh , this backfired on erdogan . 
  troll is ruined by your flair though . 
   sand people [ mfw ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_kwz4bqmmfpo/taaghdedexi/aaaaaaaabsc/yitzvixbwhs/s1600/angry_muslims_jidf.jpg ), 
  you seem unbiased . 
  for any poor readers , literally all of his comment is edited . 
  he deleted his originial psychotic rage and replaced it with something looking much better . 
  you can see how hard he thought out how he would make it look like the first pointless part about aisha was all of his edit . 
   america is not the topic here , even thou one should consider that america is not the greatest example for a non-backwards society . 
  ( btw totally funny that you put brainwashed islamist suicide bombers on the same podest like the military ) . 
  going by people who believe killing civilians is ok , mena would be the most progressive actually . 
   in 2015 about 49 % voted for akp , you might see that as just a number , it is n't . 
  12 % of the other half voted for authoritarian . 
  one could basically say , 62 % are in fav . 
  of an an authoritarian leader . 
  -- is not bullshit but the direct outcome of the votes from 2015 , but sure , lol . 
   again , if you call 60 % of votes for authoritarian a `` chunk '' , because 10 % are willing to live with that for the sake of economy , well i guess we have a few different views in what is morally right and what is not . 
  i cited a study , we should probably look at that instead of relying on your strange maths . 
  i see you 're conceding the rest of your points . 
  right , but why ca n't you answer any of my points ? 
  you 're just insulting me at this point instead of responding . 
  edit : i see you edited your comment . 
  wow , did i shut you down so hard you had to go on an unrelated name-calling rant ? 
   because 95 % think mohammed the prophet is actually a role model worth following . 
  12 % of those muslims support the idea od sharia laws to be imposed . 
  15 % think suicide bombings are sometime justified . 
  29 % of those think stoning is a justified punichment for adultry . 
  17 % of those think death penelty is justified for apostasy 70 % think a person needs to believe im god to be moral 85 % think homosexuality is morally wrong . 
  65 % think that women should obey their husbands most muslims will react either with `` that 's how it was back then '' or `` that 's a lie , aisha was older '' when confronted with those facts . 
  attempts to paint muslims as pedophiles are hilariously misguided . 
  http://content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/gallupspaces/production/cms/adgc/bzdvtb6ptuymkc1fzm_log.png nearly half ( 47 % ) of north americans agree that military or individual attacks on civilians are sometimes justified , compared to 13 % in mena , the lowest of all regions . 
  deport americans , they are terrorist supporters ! 11 !, 
  ! 1  in 2015 about 49 % voted for akp , you might see that as just a number , it is n't . 
  12 % of the other half voted for authoritarian . 
  one could basically say , 62 % are in fav . 
  of an an authoritarian leader . 
  http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/10/turkey-report-05.png bullshitting as usual . 
   only 25 % voted for a secularist party . 
  + 11 % for the environmenmental progressive one . 
  that still sums up to only 36 % there was a pew poll in 2015 that asked the question of secularism , and about 13 % stated that they want full sharia . 
  i can dig it up for you if you ask . 
   so for me , this is not a simple pro erdogan or not game , this is a society that has liberal influence , had media , knowledge and education with liberal influence from around the world and the majority is willing to go and vote for an authoritarian . 
   does that mean all turks are backwards ? 
  i did not say that . 
  but a society is not just formed by a few those do not agree to the insane things those are happening at the moment in turkey and those people are just as much victims of the current backwardness of turkey , as anyone else . 
  and i doubt that if you ask the majority of educated liberal turks at this moment , if they think theit society is backwards , they will answer `` no of course not , i am preparing yo leave my country just for fun , because we are so progressive '' . 
  i have never denied that akp voters are backwards , atleast most of them . 
  but there is a 10 % or so of voters that vote akp because they are scared of leaving the country weak , as we saw in last election . 
  there is a chunk of the country who are truly middle eastern in mentality , but they are the minority . 
  unfortunately , it 's a bit hard to know exactly what is what in turkey considering the total control of media that erdogan has . 
  he does n't portray himself as an authoritarian islamist in media , and the majority of this voters do n't think he is . 
  his voters are basically sheep that are pro-democracy but does n't really understand what it is . 
  so mr u/angiemcd is bullshitting then ? 
  what a surprise . 
  bourbon france ? 
  but i mean you 're right , everybody has fought everybody . 
  the only problem is europeans view us as an `` other '' and as bad . 
  so tell me ( a stupid member of a foreign race ) , what is your solution ? 
  there is a massive difference in education level of these groups . 
  you didi n't ask for the educated turks . 
  50 % are against erdogan , so why do you call the whole country backwards ? 
  tbh that 's kind of bullshit, 
  thanks :(, 
  you mean those two kurds that raped a woman ? 
  so they will convert over hundreds of years of societal pressure ? 
  very western and liberal . 
   the european part goes back to europeans . 
  lol , not even going to comment on this one . 
   most of the 15 million live on the asian part . 
  and here i thought canadians were n't as retarded as americans . 
  no thanks . 
  why, 
  i 'd love to hear a source for this claim of yours that muslims believe pedophilia is a virtue . 
   worship mohammed oh boy, 
  turks were the bad guys of tolkiens age , so the orcs were probably partially inspired by us .
