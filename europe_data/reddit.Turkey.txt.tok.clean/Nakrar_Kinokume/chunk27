  us as in turkey . 
  this guys comment history is gold . 
   allies . 
  lol, 
   i refuted your points by telling you that during revolutions innocents die and i do n't support the idea of greeks killing turks but it happened during a war times and also because the turks were seen as oppressors . 
  this is literally the logic people denying the armenian genocide have , could you be more unaware of yourself ? 
  leave your wet dreams out of this . 
  not even all of our neighbours could actually win an offensive war , nor would they ever want to . 
  yes , and america should n't have lynched negroes !, 
  this thread will be fun . 
  r/europe needs a monthly thread to unload their hatred for us , i understand . 
  well i do n't think that makes any sense , considering that you guys were just a backwater province while turkey/greece was literally the capital of the empire for a thousand years , or more if you count the ottomans . 
  how anyone can trust the u.s is beyond me , even russia is better since they are unlikely to try to fuck us over . 
  name does not check out . 
  i didi n't say terminal cancer , jesus christ . 
  self-haters of every form exists , i guess some kind of deep freudian complex is the culprit . 
  so you 're the token minority they can point at like a zoo animal and say : `` see we 're not bigots ! '' . 
  now , i do n't know anything about french politics but i assume that ca n't be a good thing . 
  no , the spectrum between left and right does n't exist in us muslims , we 're literally non-euclidean alians . 
  yes , dear leader recep tayyip erdogan loves doing referandums , in fact he is doing one right now !, 
  such a great leader and champion of liberal democracy . 
   doctrine of islam vs  parts of the doctrine . 
  wording my friend . 
  oh no , i have cancer so i better kill myself . 
  how you can be a minority of any kind and vote for the right-wing just boggles my mind , but everything exists i guess . 
  how dare you suggest that muslims have different opinions !, 
  ! 111 we 're a hive mind and anybody who disagrees is a pc regressive cuck leftist !, 
  why was this downvoted ? 
  * shut down *, 
  the salt is just incredible . 
  it 's so much it could probably give an elephant brain hemorrhages . 
  fucking poles , they had like 1 good moment and it had to be against us . 
  thanks bro . 
  maybe i 'll go once the eu decides to stop anal probing us before giving us visas . 
  yeah , how about you bring back to life the ones you murdered too ? 
  maybe it was n't millions , but neither was bosnian genocide . 
  oh , it would be cool if you guys would stop calling for ethnic cleansing of us just because we used to speak greek a thousand years ago . 
  the blue mosque across the street ? 
  anything mimar sinan did ? 
  edit : oh , he 's alt-right . 
  i do n't think you have anymore muslims to give us in a population exchange so no . 
  edit : maybe if you give us crete , and maybe let the descendants of those you lynched move back to greece ? 
  well , i do n't see how forcing us to walk to rakka is anything but genocidal these days ... 
  tbh istanbul is n't really the most roman city in turkey , its been anatoliafied . 
   i just criticised your dumb blabbering about ethnic diversity . 
  oh , so the problem is n't islam or culture its their * ethnicity * . 
  nice to see the truth come out . 
  did you get any immigrants from your colonies back in the day ? 
  because the longer a minority has been present in a country , the better they do ( generally ) . 
  t r i m o r e t a r i m o r e t a, 
  man i love that bottom-right picture , what is the street called ? 
  do they have burn centers in serbia ? 
  ** trigger warning **, 
  we 'll join you voluntarily and since turks will then be a majority in greece we 'll annex you . 
  : dddd ottoman empire 2 : electric boogaloo, 
  polls are never a good indicator of the results tbh , but the polls ( + anecdotes ) are saying no . 
  heyy , that aint bad . 
  welcome to our reality . 
  also til turkey has that much coverage , brb gon na check what the kurds are doing . 
  i 'll probably go at some point just to see pripyat . 
  not everyone can afford to go to turkish uni . 
  i do n't think 5000 is alot though , especially considering the amount of ukrainians in turkey . 
  was n't it like scythian or something . 
  i thought he wrote in mein kampf that the existance of the polish race is an insult to germany ? 
  is there alot of turks in the ukraine ? 
  hungary does n't deserve this . 
  you guys already fucked them enough . 
  the cold war social retardation really showing itself in this thread . 
  someone tell them that all slavs were considered unworthy of life by hitler . 
  well that is highly unfortunate wording then . 
   ** descendants from non-western nations ** so assimilating changes your descent ? 
  they already stopped . 
  poorer does n't mean less likely to vote for populism ... 
  turkey has mandatory conscription , i do n't know genders or percentage . 
  i do n't really see them that much , but yes . 
  goat/sheep cheese , especially bulgarian . 
  i do n't really know anything about it , except you guys did good . 
  that 's a strange map . 
  i do n't think armenia has any territory in europe . 
  anything + bread, 
  you only need english really , everybody knows it . 
  russian is also useful . 
  nationalists hate asians here , which is pretty strange considering turkish history . 
  i do n't think anybody else has anything against you guys though , i would stay away from anyone with shaved heads if you visit . 
  you could visit , but i would avoid istanbul or izmir . 
  though most other countries would be better imo . 
  oh boy , where to start ... 
  yeah , i think its fairly representative of young european men . 
  some threads get brigaded sometimes though , you can guess which ones . 
  hong kong but warmer ? 
  i do n't think this is how it works tbh . 
  iran 's government is doing just fine without tourists . 
   parliament notes with worry , that there today are areas in denmark , where the ** share of immigrants and descendants from non-western nations surpasses 50 pct . 
  ** it is parliaments viewpoint , that danes should not be a minority in residential areas in denmark . 
  how is this not racial ? 
  how many refugees have you taken in compared to denmark ? 
   i work in london and when i 'm in the office i hear it all the time from so called `` westernised asians '' they refuse to refer to themselves as english or british , they are always pakistani . 
  i mean , why identify as british if you risk people laughing at you behind your back ? 
  though my impression is that britain is more open to assimilation than most other countries ( xcept americas ) . 
  self-awareness level : teach me senpai,
