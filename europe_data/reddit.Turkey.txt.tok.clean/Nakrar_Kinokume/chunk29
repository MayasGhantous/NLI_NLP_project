   which one of our neighbours poses a threat to us ? 
  i mean , serbs do n't look european , and you 're culturally very different from western europe . 
  it 's kind of funny to see you talking about the west as if you 're western . 
  those two were puppets of the u.s. 
  i 'm sure if the u.s occupied turkey for 30 years and poured trillions into our economy we would also be liberal . 
  turkey have been trying to join since the sixties , and romania was let in while it was in way worse shape than turkey was back then . 
  it 's simply about islam . 
  also , recently a poll suggested that the majority of europeans want to ban us from moving to their countries . 
  how could we possibly be friends ? 
  yeah , but the question was n't really banning muslim conservatives , rather it was banning all people from muslim countries . 
  it 's a stupid poll , they needed more options . 
  not so sure about that . 
  there is nothing in the text about the method they used for the poll , so i will assume that it 's inaccurate like most online polls for now . 
  online polls do n't represent reality , if anything the american election showed that . 
  '' -5 '' i 'm sure this thread is n't brigaded . 
  banning hardcore muslim conservatives = / = banning people from muslim countries . 
  i wish they would have framed the question differently . 
  this is too complicated for most people to think about , unfortunately . 
  a majority of migrants to europe being of the more right-wing side does n't help either . 
  i think he was being ironic ... 
  online polls tend to be quite a bit slanted in favor of the right-wing , but not this much . 
  this has absolutely changed my view on europeans . 
   islamophobic xenophobic nazi nazi of course not , but mind telling me how people who want * permanent bans * on people from * all muslim countries * do n't qualify for being anti-islamic or xenophobic ? 
  edit : really , what is the defintion of `` xenophobic '' to you people ? 
  is it just nonexistent ? 
  turkish too, 
  it 's a new and worrying trend around here . 
  maybe due to a fresh influx of `` europeans '' from t_d ? 
  we do n't have a tent of our own , unless you mean azerbaijan and the russia-aligned turkic nations . 
  as i said , maybe you think you 're right . 
  let 's say you manage to convince me to think you 're right too . 
  but the turkish people is never going to accept this sad proposal . 
  well , the majority disagrees with you as we see in this poll and other irl polls , people do n't want to see us join even in a hundred years and we need to prepare for the inevitable , we need friends who see us as equals and not as outposts . 
   citation needed . 
  was referring in a tongue-in-cheek manner to [ this . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/solingen_arson_attack_of_1993 )  and you 're eating up the shit erdogan feeds you like it 's candy . 
  nice insult . 
  what if i told you that i didi n't vote for erdogan ? 
  i guess everyone you disagree with are brainwashed by erdogan now ? 
   if you pass all the tests that every other country in the eu passed then you should certainly be allowed in . 
  there would most likely be massive protests considering the public opinion on this . 
  it 's like asking us to guard the tent but sleep outside it , and occasionally you pass us some food through the door . 
  orrr we could go over to russia 's tent . 
  if you ca n't use your brain to think out why this is then i ca n't help you . 
  we wo n't be accepted into the eu and with our geography ** we can not afford to be neutral ** . 
  got it ? 
  and our other options is the middle east , who wo n't fully accept a secular country . 
  therefore we are forced into islamism . 
  you are deluded if you think the eu ever had the intention of letting us in , even if we had a positive future . 
  i will assume that most responders who are okay with a rich and liberal turkey in the eu would have picked the `` yes with reforms '' option . 
  yes , and europeans are not yet secular enough to accept religious differences in their union . 
   the greece-turkey fight . 
  not really a fight , more like saber rattling . 
  this is covered under the definition of `` reforms ''  borders . 
  right now , the eu enjoys a natural border ( obviously not impermeable ) along the mediterranean . 
  turkey does n't enjoy the same degree of isolation . 
  extending the eu into asia minor invariably means dealing more with illegal immigration and other issues in the area . 
  similarly , the us was pretty happy stopping at the pacific and atlantic -- makes for nice moats . 
  it is incredibly hard to stop people moving between turkey and the greek islands , while moving through turkey 's new border walls in the south east + across mountains is much harder . 
  i would n't expect an american to know anything about this though , but now you know . 
   population . 
  given the dutch referendum , i think that there 's more opposition to large ( especially large and poorer ) countries joining , since it obviously produces a much-larger effect in terms of subsidy and population movement . 
  turkey has about the per-capita gdp of romania , but has four times the population . 
  romania and bulgaria were much poorer than turkey when they first joined . 
  turks want to move away because they are afraid of the current government , not because they are poor . 
  i expect that wo n't be a problem if turkey joins the eu . 
  mate , read the damn survey . 
  this is not about erdogan or islamism . 
  a vast majority of responders will ** never ** or ** probably never ** accept turkey in the eu ** even with reforms ** . 
  stop raving about erdogan or authoritarianism . 
  we wo n't be accepted in europe therefore we have to turn to russia and the middle east . 
  and a secular liberal turkey would stick out like a sore thumb among our new `` friends '' . 
   religion has been more important these days to europeans because of fanatic muslims and their atrocious deeds nowadays . 
  not responding to this pie of shit , who are you anyway ? 
   edit : and what outcome would you want in ww2 : s one where germany won but hitler lost . 
  i just meant that even ww2 germany was more accepting of us than modern europe , which is hilarious really . 
  china and india . 
  mind elaborating ? 
  why should we be killing arabs ? 
  since isis are arabs , i thought i 'd start calling isis arabs since you are calling ypg/pkk kurds . 
   you are fucking delusional . 
  you want to see what hate is ? 
  if you ca n't criticise your government without going to jail never to be seen again . 
  if you denounce science to follow a blind religious doctrine without critical thinking were everyone who does n't have the right opinion is the enemy . 
  or you could just stay in your world were the only reason someone would criticise turkey is because `` they hate turks '' . 
  that 's on the same level of ignorance when americans say terrorist hate them because of their freedom . 
  how is authoritarianism on its own hateful anyway ? 
  as for germany , we ca n't even live there without getting burnt alive , so that 's that . 
  and i 'm still not talking about criticizing turkey or erdogan , you 're trying to deflect from the issue , or maybe you 're just dumb . 
  back when religion was less important to europeans we were pretty well treated actually . 
  especially some fascist movements were inspired by ataturk . 
  i just wonder if we 'd have been better off with a different outcome to ww2 , dunno . 
  the wrong side won in ww1 too , seems like everything lined up perfectly for our departure from europe . 
  you didi n't understand the question . 
  without the eu we would be isolated politically since we would be rejected by the middle east . 
  we have to be part of one or the other , and choose our internal politics after which bloc we are part of . 
  you are forcing us to islamism . 
   because first hate is the reason and when that argument does n't work you use another one . 
  no , you 're using erdogan to excuse european hatred for turks . 
   there is a real danger here that turkey would use this intel to kill kurds .
