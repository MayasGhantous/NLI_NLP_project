  : ddd, 
  you will betray your alliance because of oppression that occurred several hundred years ago ? 
  explains your country really . 
   no wonder that your country goes down the drain yeah buddy , clearly reddit turks are the reason for that . 
  fuck me the footage is terrifying . 
  i 've seen people getting shot in video games and movies a thousand times but it 's nothing like watching someone dying for real , even though it 's not even live . 
  edit : strange thing to downvote me , but it 's still what i feel about this . 
  should n't have enslaved people and brought them to the u.s then !, 
  and this woman is french . 
  must be the same thing that `` french '' guy has ? 
  we need to step up our agenda-pushing game bro . 
  60 % of people are stupid . 
  electro-n strikes again !, 
  r/turkey _ irl, 
  not sure whether to be offended or impressed . 
  everybody needs a hobby . 
  sique burn m8 no one claimed russia can do everything on a whim , but to believe that russia is too weak to influence western politics is hilariously naive . 
  no risk for saudi turkia , so do n't worry about it . 
  i disagree . 
  akp seeming to lose the ground it gained after the coup attempt . 
  [ click here for google translate link . 
  you think russia is some shitty little backwater nation ? 
  name checks out . 
  how does it benefit erdogan only ? 
  the eu is basically giving erdogan free domestic ammunition by doing this . 
  yes . 
  well , his movement is n't doing fine anymore . 
   constantinople will always be greek . 
  you stole it . 
  does n't surprise me that an american does n't know jack shit about history either . 
  i guess berlin will always be slavic !, 
   plus , your capital is ankara , which is outside of europe . 
  so the u.s is not a pacific country now ? 
  you called me non-european , i 'm asking you how exactly you know this ? 
  i could be from thrace ( like 20-25 % of turks ) , or an immigrant ( turkey has like 10 million immigrants from the balkans/north caucasus ) , or a turk from the balkans . 
  edit : and turkey 's continental belonging is not up for debate , sorry buddy . 
  especially not with someone who has no business in europe/asia . 
  debate your own shitty country . 
  this is a big deal because the top cleric is usually * for * religious laws , this time the backlash was so great that even this guy had to speak out . 
  i think that `` french '' guy from before has a few sockpuppets . 
  ** triggered **, 
  i thought it originated in old turkic and meant stronk . 
  wikipedia agrees !!, 
  ! 1 : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkic_peoples#etymology  however , it is generally accepted that the term `` t\u00fcrk '' is ultimately derived from the old-turkic migration-term [ 49 ] t\u00fcr\u00fck / t\u00f6r\u00fck , [ 50 ] [ 51 ] which means `` created '' , `` born '' , [ 52 ] or `` strong '' , [ 53 ] from the old turkic word root * t\u00fcri - / t\u00f6ri - ( `` tribal root , ( mythic ) ancestry ; take shape , to be born , be created , arise , spring up '' ), 
  no way what the hell : dddddd, 
   i personally support the right-wing throughout europe , username does not check out . 
  between the real french and ... * those people * . 
  flair checks out . 
  greece showed us our future if we join the eu . 
  they need major reforms or something , otherwise it would be really dumb for us to join . 
  okay , but you 're gon na have to brand it `` the christian union '' if you wo n't even accept albania or bosnia . 
  also stop pretending to be secular please . 
   so what this guy is saying , is helping noone but erdogan . 
  that and the fact that he 's been allowed to exist as opposition amidst that massive crackdown of everyone and their mother . 
  it shows to me that he 's nothing more than a ` puppet opposition ' putin style . 
  it 's shit like this that makes me wary of upvoted reddit comments . 
  this looks all fine and dandy for someone completely ignorant of turkey or reality , but only cringy for me or any turk . 
  chp is untouchable because arresting them would start a civil war . 
  you and the other idiots in this subreddit think erdogan is some kind of almighty god , you 're exactly the same as akp voters . 
  it fits perfectly into the r/europe worldview though , turkey is literally nazi germany , erdogan controls everything . 
  gulen does n't exist etc etc. 
  anyone turkish that disagrees even remotely with the narrative is branded erdoganbot , same bullshit being applied to russians . 
  why is this relevant ? 
  haha , mma fits perfectly for you badboy . 
  i know you 're not american , you 're even worse . 
   i just do n't want your retarded country in . 
  in where ? 
   the only dog here is the one that 's defending erdogan 's country . 
  ca n't even make sense of this , did you forget your pills ? 
  you 're sure you 're not american ? 
  you have the most american post history ever . 
  wtf is mma ? 
  i like how you came rushing to america 's defense though , good dog . 
   it 's not like turks are true europeans either . 
  true , but what context turkey should be placed in is no business of anyone outside of our local area . 
  who ? 
  why would they nuke eachother ? 
  i think i may have triggered you . 
  and how do you know i 'm non-european ? 
  just fuck off with your american rhetoric . 
  lol , how many days has it been ? 
  removed by whom ? 
  democracy is the only thing that should remove democratically elected leaders , i ca n't believe i have to argue about this . 
  no one democratically elected should be `` removed from power '' . 
   it can objectively proven that in europe increased muslim presence leads to increased terrorist attacks it has been objectively proven that the existance of humans leads to increased raping and pillaging . 
   and it is obvious political branch of islam hates west and considers itself at war with west this is true . 
   and it is impossible to determine who exactly is and is n't an islamist so instead of having another bataclan/charlie hebdo/nice/etc it 's better to not let muslims in . 
  might aswell cover the earth in nukes while we 're at it , to be extra sure . 
  nothing will change , turkey is the toady of the u.s , not the eu . 
  depends , i do n't think erdogan is gon na challenge either . 
  i disagree with you , we 'll just have to see . 
  trump is n't r/the _ donald . 
  he wants to prevent terrorists from getting into the u.s , does that make him hate muslims ? 
  he will ban anyone from hotbeds of terrorism , this may include parts of europe and may exclude parts of the muslim world . 
  though i 'm not sure what his relation to erdogan will be . 
   racial tensions ** sees flair ** please go away , this is n't r/north _ america . 
  most seculars in turkey have turned against the west . 
  we want to be allied to people who see us as equals . 
  it would have to be normandie but in greece : dd, 
  kek , shows how much you know if you think that city is liberal .
