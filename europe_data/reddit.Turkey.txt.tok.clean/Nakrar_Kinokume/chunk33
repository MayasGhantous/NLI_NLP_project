  i would rather not talk about it . 
  erdogan denies being against secularism and his voters obviously believe him , otherwise they would n't vote for him . 
  it 's not rocket science . 
  do n't forget gluten-free / s, 
  that was 2 months ago . 
   does turkey oppress religious people ? 
  depends on which religion . 
  yeah , but laws are for losers . 
  / s i guess they want to allow anyone to marry but not have consensual sex outside of marriage unless over 18 ? 
  just why . 
  and what are these `` concerns '' of yours ? 
  haha , ethnic cleansing is funny . 
  * on reddit, 
  wow our army must be shit quality . 
  so you 'll vote for the left the day they adopt right-wing values . 
  okay . 
  calling out bigotry is more risky and non-pc . 
  we need easy prey for our slave trade , do n't say that . 
   turks seem to run around trying to convince the europeans they are western and `` white '' etc. 
  that 's because we 're inbetween civilizations , secular turks push to join europe ( impossible because of anti-islamic attitude and ignorance ) and islamist turks push for the opposite . 
  also we more travelled turks see the ridiculousness in calling us brown but greeks white , something probably caused by the above mentioned bigotry . 
  just really annoying to read . 
  challenge accepted . 
  reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee, 
  wow , first time i see you in a thread that is not related to muslims . 
   he 's a jewish i 've spent so much time on the internet that i thought your first sentance was a negative one , just because he 's jewish . 
  fml . 
  hungary is like our soulmate or something . 
  it gets me too , we should fund a study into this . 
  all of cyprus is in ** asia ** , it does n't really hold any relevance to whether or not it is european enough for this sub . 
  the mods are n't purists .

  your words are duly noted , now stop spamming every thread with them .

  building is a good stimulant . 
  azerbaijan can into oil .

  u/electro-n is my favourite user . 
  i like seeing the nature too . 
  no , you 're not bulgars . 
  turkic is n't a modern ethnicity . 
  why germans ? 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/quranism already exists , just a bit hard to spread when like 90 % of the muslim world is incredibly far-right for varying historical and modern reasons . 
  you 're the one arguing turkey is some kind of nazi germany . 
  then again , your name is u/trumpsmightywall, 
  itt : slav trying to claim other people 's history . 
  again . 
  hey there dear reader . 
  you clicked on this thread despite being well aware of what it was going to be . 
  the same alt-right accounts commenting the exact same copy paste comments they 've been using for the last five years . 
  so go ahead and click out of the thread , and rest well knowing that these guys have been handed loss after loss in europe , and their numbers are shrinking even if the noise they make is massive . 
  polls do n't lie . 
  being against immigration = far right . 
  mass is a different issue . 
  do n't throw rocks in a glass house !, 
  bulgars are n't bulgarians , it 's a different ethnic group . 
  that 's just fact , no need to get offended . 
  meh , that was a turkic empire . 
  man i wish arab countries were n't so shit right now . 
  i 'd love to live in an awesome oasis or desert coast over there .

  i do n't think the dude is kemalist , or `` kamalist '' as he prefers to say it . 
  there are turks in isis too , does that mean the entire country is like that ? 
  there was like a maximum of a few thousand maniacs confronting the soldiers . 
  13 % are sharia supporters , pull your head out of your ass . 
  i 'm guessing that development of more strict seculars is disturbing you too ? 
  right , but there is clearly something wrong here . 
  you 're arab and not turkish ? 
  latvian can not into peaceful embrace of death , such is life . 
   timeturk lol what even is that . 
  http://www.pewglobal.org/2016/04/27/the-divide-over-islam-and-national-laws-in-the-muslim-world/ much better source with realistic numbers , you 're bullshitting and i ca n't figure out why . 
  what the hell is your problem ? 
  your arabic village in the south east does n't represent the direction of turkey , get used to it . 
  were, 
  come on dude , do you never get tired of this shit ? 
  negative strikes again . 
  u/operation _ room can be safely put on ignore . 
  he is either extremely misinformed or disturbed by the lack of anti-turkish comments and thus deliberately spreading false information . 
  meh , i walked on it no problem . 
  not founded yet . 
  going to be founded by dissidents from mhp . 
  a secular sane right wing party , will tear the akp into shreds . 
  your comment literally makes no sense . 
  can you re-read my comment above and actually reply to it ? 
  fyi we 're not talking about language or religion . 
  they shat all over fascism , that 's something . 
  latvians, 
  new party is already underway . 
  i would love to spam ** turan strunk ** right now but the whole situation is too disturbing .
