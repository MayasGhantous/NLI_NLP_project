  they are also one of the most xenophobic and previously most isolated nations on earth . 
  you think their example is worth following in this case ? 
  hey poland , i feel your pain . 
  the title is `` the highest point of all european countries '' not `` the highest point of all european countries excluding territory outside of europe '' . 
  yes ? 
  your minimum shekels are in the mail, 
  lol , you could probably get a job here honestly . 
  many people in industry speak russian if you know that . 
  grab a weapon and come , see how fun it sounds then . 
  would n't be so sure on that , they are building a ton of shit . 
  give me one example of this working without massive natural resources or a completely mentally destroyed society ? 
  even african countries throw off their dictators . 
   turkey is europe and with europe.stupid actions does n't make a country non-europe . 
  this is standard course for europe . 
  turks in germany that do something good are `` german '' , while the bad ones are `` foreign '' . 
  it 's always an american too . 
  no shit there will be dead people . 
  i 'm not saying it will end without bloodshed , that much is clear already . 
  hope i can keep my head down . 
  we 'll see , he can deal with the pkk but also 50 % of turks ? 
  no way . 
  minorities have the highest fertility rate . 
  most conservative families have since long moved to cities and their fertility has dropped . 
  and in fact , erdogan lost these cities in the last referandum , despite his chokehold on information . 
  most of the turks you see on here are children of conservative families that are rebelling . 
  basically r/atheism . 
  so it 's not like all or even most the children growing up in the cities are following their conservative parents ideologically . 
  incredible how someone can be this ignorant and still be classed as homo sapiens . 
  they are not the majority , but they are attracted to muslim related topics . 
  why are you against erdogan ? 
  he 's like the inspiration for cheeto benito , your beloved eternal leader . 
  i do n't think he 's a religious maniac . 
  h\u00dc\u00dc\u00dclooooog, 
  okay , how is that related to my point ? 
  what ? 
  its atleast 50 % . 
  hmm , would you like to elaborate ? 
  maybe its a bit personal but i am curious . 
  seems typical for megalomaniacs . 
  i think he 's miscalculating . 
   and often young turks are more religious than their secular parents ummmmmm i do n't even understand what your comment is supposed to say . 
  dat double parantheses . 
  as for your text , people are massive idiots and erdogan is very intelligent . 
  i do n't think he 'll be able to keep it up after he spends all his money to try and revive the dead economy . 
  it 's similar to donald trump support . 
  there is a 30-40 % that are absolutely mental goners and everybody else hates him . 
  he would be the luckiest `` president '' ever if he gets away with that . 
  ikr , people are so touchy when it comes to the borders of their christian civilization . 
  not anymore it is n't , he came to power on a democratic platform , which he since has thrown in the thrash . 
  i legit do n't know a single ex-akp voter that still supports him . 
  he 's cheating like a machine right now . 
  how are you not ashamed of being so uninformed ? 
  what makes you think grey wolves are n't also dumb kids ? 
  before christianity , europe was literally a bunch of tribes killing eachother with clubs and sharp sticks . 
  i 'm not saying christianity civilized europe , but the mediterreanean did . 
  plato is probably closer to david vs goliath than whatever corner of europe you 're from . 
  europe follows middle eastern religion , that 's why . 
  are you incapable of clicking on links ? 
  want me to help you ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cultural_muslim  according to win-gallup international 's global index of religiousity and atheism project , [ 5 ] countries with the highest proportion of ** irreligious muslims are turkey ( 73 % ) , ** kosovo ( 60 % ) , azerbaijan ( 51 % ) and lebanon ( 33 % ) . 
  also  furthermore , according to a 2016 pew research center report ; ** only 7 % to 13 % ** of all turks think that religion should affect laws directly ** or indirectly . 
  ** [ 9 ] what the fuck is erdogan trying to accomplish here . 
  he does n't even have 15 % support for this but his dumbass supporters are willing to look away while he does his social engineering . 
  i give this guy a maximum of 5 years more , if he is very lucky . 
  this is the first time he has started going directly against the wishes of his voterbase . 
  no , because most of it is n't in the marmara . 
  it 's turkey , or west turkey . 
  should n't take a teacher for you to do that . 
  lol , he most certainly can and will do so . 
  i doubt akp would get 30 % in a free and fair election . 
  could just as easily ask any christian why they dont respond to adultery with genocide . 
  again : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/cultural_muslim, 
  germany would be a cesspit like it has been previously . 
  they can be very thankful for their wise governance , some of us do n't have that . 
  yes ? 
  most of it is . 
   such a diverse continent we have . 
  almost like its arbitrarily defined . 
  normal turk here . 
   the role of a woman in society they are people so i should n't decide on that . 
   gay sex what kind of framing is this ? 
  you mean lgbt + rights ? 
  they need more , especially trans ones . 
   free speech i recall young turks were the most pro free speech in a survey done recently , so that should be enough . 
   freedom from religion , people from dumb families in east anatolia have oppressive religious parents , and i do n't like those families . 
   and how do you square those beliefs with islam and being liberal ? 
  wolves are the kids . 
  this is hardly a cultural issue , not in turkey 's case . 
  if you ( american ) think this is the place for 4chan turkhating you are in the wrong sub . 
  post history checks out , argues about `` white genocide '' . 
  warning !, 
  warning !, 
  american detected . 
  can we have a u / - golvan - bot ? 
  false flag detected, 
  people do n't support sharia , so that 's unlikely . 
  maybe if erdogan forces some light aspect of it , but that 's very risky . 
  atleast the weather is good . 
  seculars did not attempt the 2016 coup . 
  turkey is in nato , not erdogan .
