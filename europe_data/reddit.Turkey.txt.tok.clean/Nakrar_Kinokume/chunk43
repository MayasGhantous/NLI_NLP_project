  our horde stands behind you br\u00f6ther, 
  refugees reduced to `` islam '' . 
  forgot religion, 
  source needed, 
  lol , greece is white but we 're not ?? 
  have you ever seen a turk or a greek ? 
  til anatolia is greece . 
  hence again, 
  i really tried , sorry mom . 
  alexander was macedonian , not greek !, 
  yes ? 
  it 's part of our country so no . 
  it 's like saying we own the name novi pazar . 
  more like the line is drawn to exclude turkey as much as possible . 
  i 'm worried for you , please talk to a doctor about this . 
  are we using pirates as our navy again ? 
  hey , that 's our trademark . 
  i was agreeing with this thread until it started its natural descent into `` race realism '' , please go back to t_d , we 're not dumb enough to fall for astroturfing . 
  conquest and pressure to assimilate, 
  dat turk spread thou . 
  `` negrocity '' omg lol, 
  those guys are mixed in turn . 
  most of us are anatolian , not foreign , anatolia is next to greece , so do the math . 
  we are everything ! 11 jesus was turkic111111 ! 1 `` 121214dads, 
  let 's just ignore what happened to the galatians then ... 
  what in fuck . 
  why are glorious turkraki speak filthy language of inferior sheep people ? 
  shame you are on ancest\u00f6r . 
  t_d condensed into a single comment, 
  do n't forget to pass by our ** turkish ** mountain if you go to that part . 
  careful now , do n't hurt any feelings . 
  okay cool . 
  i was explaining what the user you replied to was talking about . 
  lol , so now trojans are non-anatolian . 
  all in your desperation to seperate us as much as possible from your own countries . 
  true , but it seems less malicious than the turkish ones . 
  if you identify yourself as closer to germans or whatever than to trojans , that makes you a weird-ass complexed greek . 
  even depression :(, 
  azerbaijan is surprising to you ? 
  armenia and cyprus does n't even have land in europe . 
  the edge is creeping me out . 
  it 's like anatolia , kind of a borderland culturally and historically . 
  most people in the third world is most likely hoping to get a better life in europe . 
  xaxaxa we trik u is actualy germany in 2100, 
  even non-turks are getting triggered by this shit . 
  you 're not wrong , atleast 1453 onwards . 
  lol , this is how most of turkey is , except for the private matter part . 
  found the murican, 
  they spread wahhabism everywhere , and no one does anything . 
  xd we need curry here so its ok . 
  lucky most of the world is n't india then . 
  this is one map i 'm very glad that we 're excluded from . 
  day 1453 . 
  the stupid austrians still do n't suspect a thing ... 
  yeah , i do that when i visit western countries . 
  just short of humans and pets seems like a good place to stop to me . 
  hdp is a leftist minority issues party . 
  it gets votes by the secular minority among kurds and kurds who are more nationalist than islamist . 
  that said about half of hdp voters are islamist and as you know , kurds are sunni , therefore `` one of us '' . 
  edgy af with random brigaders . 
  bulgaria is a pro-russia trojan horse that is almost completely useless strategically and is extremely corrupt and poor . 
  do n't throw stones in a glass house , no one is nato members out over a government they do n't like . 
  sure , if you want two russian fleets outside your coast in the middle of winter . 
  it 's not like its our nation that 's gon na be obliterated as soon as the u.s does n't feel like defending you . 
  which one is it ? 
  is he a fraudulent dictator or is the turkish people evil ? 
  you can only have one . 
  also we would have backup from the rest of nato in such an event . 
  the russian black sea fleet is just one part of their fleet , no way they can get through istanbul . 
  it 's like a sith lord and his apprentice . 
  out with hungary and greece then . 
  nazi ? 
  he 's lithuanian ffs . 
  ** n ** orth ** a ** tlantic ** t ** reaty ** o ** rganization only countries in north america and europe can actually join i think . 
  i like how independance to turks in bulgaria is `` stealing territory '' but no independance for kurds is literal fascism . 
  would be real shame if we stopped trying to contain all those people within our borders and instead began thinking about our own people for once . 
  why would he hate kurds ? 
  the guy is pan-islamist basically . 
  turk stronk , for the horde !, 
  wait ... 
  lol , now this is entertainment . 
  which ethnic group does he hate ? 
  seculars ? 
  not sure if positive or negative . 
  you legit do n't know with turks . 
  man , i wish mehmed ii could be our dictator instead . 
  always refreshing to watch people with a bigger complex than turks, 
  no , hungarians are just slavs and we are just anatolians, 
  that 's not how it works ... 
  considering his name he 'd most likely be deported . 
  turkey is `` north '' ... 
  it 's meant to be an anti-russian alliance of european and north american countries ( i.e north atlantic ) . 
  you do n't have to have cold climate for that lol . 
  romanians are great . 
  just felt like saying that . 
  the guy was raving about `` restoring greek land '' on r/worldnews before . 
  you can safely ignore this guy . 
  the legendary trio, 
  as far as salt goes , i would rate you somewhere inbetween league of legends and a greek nationalist . 
  meh , our ancestors made it .
