  nice threat . 
   or when they want a better migrant-deal ? 
  they can do nothing short of declaring war on turkey . 
  for what ? 
  for not being the garbage dump of europe ? 
  sorry mate but you are being pathetic . 
  was referring to the fact that erdogan would be considered far-right in europe . 
  now ** that 's ** ironic . 
  this comment gave me aids . 
  now that would be funny . 
  erdogan would trigger much bigger coup if he tried to attack you guys . 
  that would just be ridiculous . 
  they are just testing the limits so to speak . 
  he and everyone else knows that he ca n't claim that much . 
  it gives a general gist , even if it might not be completely accurate . 
  why are people still thinking that erdogan 's turkey can join the eu ? 
  stop the polls and negotiations please , they have no relevance until akp is gone . 
  i expect the polls will be much more favourable when ( if ) turkey regains its sanity . 
  yeah , just like poland is considered `` eastern '' in those games . 
  in civ 5 turkey has the same theme as africa . 
  that is wildly ignorant and ridiculous . 
  the building style didi n't change between byzantium and the ottomans . 
  i ca n't believe you are actually using that as an argument . 
  huh , our youth is pretty liberal . 
  okay then , good for you . 
  the right wing will be empowered by the stopping of fearmongering !, 
  no , we brownies get enlightened by the glorious presence of the westerners . 
  / s :d, 
   estonian you really are clueless . 
  yes , turkey is more important than france . 
  better position , larger army , bosporus straits denying huge chunks of russian power . 
  also hilarious that an east europea just had to bring political correctness into this . 
  what political correctness ? 
  in the fifties ? 
  what ? 
  it 's not like turkey is literally next door to russia and extremely useful or anything . 
  no , it 's political correctness . 
  now tell me , why is a small useless east european country in nato ? 
  sources please . 
  your literally making shit up . 
  why are you trying to educate r/europe on this stuff ? 
  they are all turkey experts who already know everything . 
  erdogan did it , coup was done by secularists who are now all purged . 
  99 % of turkey wants sharia law and gulen is just a random old man . 
  / s people on this sub think they know shit , let them continue thinking so . 
  nothing will change their minds . 
  the definition of europe is not geographical . 
   but this article is a bit of turkey that is in asia , so i just fired out an opinion , we can just disagree and move on . 
  you do n't need to be so bloody passionate and emotional about everything . 
  that bit of `` asia '' is highly relevant to turkey , and thus to europe . 
  it 's not complicated . 
  now , we can only guess why ** you ** always feel the need to complain over turkish news . 
  edit : beside , r/asia is for east/south asia only . 
  what you 're looking for is r/iranian , which we ** are ** included in . 
  so now you can stop crying . 
  every thread ... 
  lol , are we on the same sub ? 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europemeta/comments/4tgyes/turkey_is_not_in_europe_1_why_is_their_flag/ i linked this to you before in our other conversation . 
  but you never answered my points and gave up after a while . 
  anyways , this is mod stance on this issue :  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europe  turkey is a european country which holds territory on the european soil . 
  as a moderating team we recognize it as such , and will consider news from turkey to be relevant . 
  the same policy applies to russia , as well as armenia and cyprus . 
   this is a place to debate subreddit policies , not the place to debate whether turkey should or should not be a european country , to what extent it should be considered a european country , nor is it the place to discuss complex historical and cultural circumstances of turkish history . 
  and it is certainly not the place to discuss our subjective opinions on how european or non-european a country feels like . 
  so as you can see , turkey news is allowed on here . 
  if you dislike that then you can complain to the mods or use another subreddit . 
  i 'm glad your conceding your point . 
  maybe the wrecking was too hard for you ? 
  so you stopped reading . 
  okay then . 
   i see that i triggered you hard enough that you 're going on a `` turkey is n't europe omfg '' rampage . 
  you keep getting rekt by random people too , i 'm enjoying this so much . 
  nice downvote btw . 
  this guy is everywhere with his `` turkey is n't europe !!!, 
  ! 111 '' crap . 
   wait , i thought we were talking about the nation state of turkey ? 
  the nation state established in 1923 , is n't that when the borders distinct from the ottomans were set ? 
  you were hellenised by alexander the great ? 
  wow , you must be really old . 
  so history has no play in this ? 
  obviously not since it disfavours your argument . 
  haha . 
   i do n't know how things work over there in asia , but if i was to apply your logic to other parts of the world , then britain is american , well that just makes no sense . 
  no actually , you are just pathetically grasping for straws at this point . 
  our ancestors were hellenized in the same place where turkey is right now , your example makes no sense . 
   personally , i do n't know why you care so much , the odds of turkey in the eu during your lifetime seem extremely low as all it would take is one nation to block accession . 
  i do n't know , i felt like arguing with someone less endowed i guess . 
  veto is worthless , if the eu wants turkey in they wont be letting one turkophobic nation ruin it . 
  eu is fairly undemocratic . 
   seeing as the cultural differences are vast and plenty , i think it is safe to say that would happen ( and many have stated this publicly ) . 
  only public statement by the eu i 've seen is the eu deciding that the borders of europe is undefined . 
  has jimmie \u00c5kesson stated that turkey is uneuropean ? 
  well , too bad !, 
   but yeah , it is undeniable that 97 % of your country is in asia , so if we were to make a probability score of a random part of turkey being asian or european , then there is a 97 % chance it would be asian . 
  i think yeah , you are close to the edges of europe , but like morocco , close but no cigar . 
  0 % of cyprus is in europe . 
   is [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europemeta/comments/4tgyes/turkey_is_not_in_europe_1_why_is_their_flag/ ) your other account ? 
  lol . 
  read that thread , the dude is making the same kind of absurd argumentation as you , and its getting destroyed . 
  you 're so insanely ignorant that i ca n't even argue with you .
