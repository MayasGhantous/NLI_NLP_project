  just because bulgaria literally contributed nothing to anything does n't mean you ca n't pretend !, 
  * i really really like armenia and armenians . 
  * i wish we could get along better with our cultural region , they all pretty much hate us due to ottomans . 
  * i do n't think east europeans should feel pride over european civilization , since they didi n't contribute that much to it . 
  it 's sort of cringy and sad . 
  [ levent district ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/leventpano3.jpg ) in istanbul . 
  indeed , you guys just defended your allies , if anything it was serbia and austria-hungary 's fault . 
  my point is , how can he be proud of this ? 
  there is a reason germany fought most of the world , a popular leader lead them to destruction and slaughtered millions of people . 
  there is nothing to be proud of in ww2 , other than the brave germans and other people that stood up to the nazis . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/generalplan_ost  in 1941 it was decided to destroy the polish nation completely and the german leadership decided that in 10 to 20 years the polish state under german occupation was to be fully cleared of any ethnic poles and settled by german colonists . 
  [ 19 ] not sure you know what you 're talking about . 
  it 's pretty fun if you 're turkish , it 's basically a clusterfuck . 
  less probably , but you can get used to it . 
  turkic names like tolga or batuhan . 
  it 's 50/50 here . 
  50 % is , as you can see , enough to get you elected . 
  being in istanbul . 
  standard method of transport between cities here . 
  we have alot of airplanes and very little trains and bad roads . 
  poor people take the bus . 
  italy or us . 
  greek food is very edible too . 
  oh sorry , edited . 
  unipolar countries . 
  obviously they ca n't persecute their turkish minority if we `` persecuted '' them hundreds of years ago !!!, 
  iran * muh sunni-shia saudi arabia * muh sunni-shia and then there are seculars and nationalists who hate both . 
  literal shit , unless you 're going to private school . 
  trump is the scariest since we do n't know how he will be as a president , but probably not the worst . 
  coup attempt was the worst by far . 
  lol , this is surreal . 
  if i can try to answer your question , i do n't think you 'd have much success here in turkey or in the balkans as an asian man . 
  i imagine western europe is similar to the liberal parts of the u.s in dating . 
  poland * crazy government ( i can empathize ) * positives : i like their culture and flag * negatives : bad people and sad history romania * corruption and economy improving faster than us * positives : good people ( they like us ?!, 
  ) , beautiful country * negatives : gypsies everywhere , scary to drive through bulgaria * positives : they are similar to us , they have superiour cheese . 
  * negatives : ticking time bomb in nato and eu , persecuted us for decades and still are , bad people . 
  edit : spelling edit2 : used wrong word . 
  not our problem , just obama being childish imho . 
  it 's kind of like having a weird cousin that you fought alot with before but now you 're ok and he 's kind of nice when everyone else are assholes . 
  i 'm one of those turks , do n't mind me adelfos . 
  : dddd edit : spellink, 
  that 's fairly typical in non-white people living in western countries who do n't romanticize their home countries . 
  you 're trying to hate on other minorities to feel more accepted and more `` swedish '' . 
  also called uncle tom syndrome . 
  lehistan is really old , we say polonya . 
  erdoganistan / s maybe anatolian republic or something . 
  he 's a swedish jew , so probably inferiority complex . 
  if you speak turkish people will assume you 're turkish . 
  you think turks ca n't be blonde or something ? 
  culture : any neighbour really history : greece language : azerbaijan economy : germany/russia social : none, 
  turkey has always been multicultural , i do n't mind it either way . 
  yes . 
  none of it is desert , except a single valley in the central part . 
  i guess he thought all muslims were arabs and all arabic places are deserts ? 
  ye , but he was n't smart unlike you . 
  one guy asking if deserts are hot . 
  atilla is common in turkey . 
  iran , we got this shit . 
  well , comperatively . 
  i will admit the naturalisation numbers were much higher then i remember . 
  you may have misunderstood the immigration policy of japan then , they simply do n't take in anybody . 
  you 'd get a good chunk of the middle east with you if you consider those guys to look `` white '' . 
  they would n't blend in to denmark , thus would n't be considered danish . 
  that 's the original question . 
  we also have had diyanet since ataturk days , though that 's actually a good thing . 
  yes , so are arabs in the u.s. people from the balkans or dark people from the rest of europe/west asia stick out in scandinavia and would n't be able to `` blend in '' enough to make ethnic nationalists happy . 
  [ these guys look danish to you ?

   white bulgarian-born immigrant interesting , and very american , definition of `` white '' . 
  yeah , hence charming . 
  i 've unfortunately never had the pleasure to visit armenia , but i will at some point in the future . 
  it 's a bit too tense for me right now . 
  but i 've seen pictures of the city center , and i like it . 
  some liberal turks feel bad for the situation of some countries that used to be our colonies , but no not really . 
  it does n't exist in turkey or europe . 
  why would it ? 
   explosion of anger check  clearly does n't read/misunderstands other person . 
  check  serious lack of knowledge check  accuses opponent instead of presenting arguments check  very unsurprising comment history , general lack of character check this exchange is over . 
  my time is more valuable than your entire life will ever be . 
  i picked yerevan since most cities in armenia look kinda like that . 
  edit : you do n't go there for the cities though . 
  [ pic related .

  ugliest must be [ yerevan ] ( http://blog.kudoybook.com/wp-content/uploads/images/yerevan_149.jpg ) though i think it 's very charming , and the rest of armenia is beautiful . 
  as for ugliest in turkey , basically any anatolian poor city . 
  like [ erzurum ] ( http://kingofwallpapers.com/erzurum/erzurum-006.jpg ) . 
  as for landscape and nature , there is n't any ugly landscape . 
  maybe the arctic , but that 's very personal . 
  benelux has the least natural landscape and it 's pretty generic or swampy . 
  we 're not `` european '' , where have i claimed that ? 
  i 've only claimed we 're not middle eastern . 
  is that the only two descriptions you know ? 
   thought of as a middle eastern because you have far more cultural similarities with them ? 
  false , we share cultural similarities with the balkans , caucasus and iran . 
  shows how much you know . 
  why do you care so much to place us in the middle east category ? 
  tired of ignorant europeans ( more often americans hiding behind european flairs ) with a < 100 iq and a belief that reddit has taught them everything about the world . 
   just go to r/worldnews and read about anything concerning turks . 
  there is nothing wrong with being middle eastern , except that 's not an accurate label for us . 
  it 's telling when every article about turkey on r/europe has atleast one buried comment saying that it should n't be on r/europe , why do people even care ?
