  you confused soul . 
  :( anyways , the akp voters i 've spoken to fervently deny that the akp is `` islamist '' . 
  albania joining faces almost as much opposition within the general public in the eu as turkey joining does . 
  the young people are getting less and less religious though . 
  even the ones at imam hatip . 
  the only way the trend will be truly reversed is that the country goes to complete shit and an islamic ataturk ( shudders ) `` restores order '' and reverses the secularism . 
  even then it will take some time . 
   and it happened for a long time in europe as well !, 
  you mean turkey is n't europe ? 
  ** triggered **, 
  i thought you referred to the regular people since you talked about democracy and stuff . 
  most people who go to mosques probably represent that 12 % of turkey who are pro-sharia . 
  i do n't think politically secular imams are impossible here though , especially not in the west . 
  the enemy stuff is just stupid nationalism though . 
  we 're not the ottomans anymore . 
  unless you believe guilt goes by descent . 
  we are not fully european either , we are both european and asian , or neither . 
  some europeans do think we ride on camels and are brown , but a public campaign would solve that if the eu so wishes . 
  its up to the eu if they should take in the borderlands of europe ( turkey , the caucasus ) . 
  except that most turks today support secularism , and a huge majority of turks are against sharia law ( 88 % ) . 
  i can pull up the sources if anyone wants . 
  civilians would be shot as they try to leave . 
  resources would be smuggled through . 
  they would take several years if not longer to starve . 
  all in all , more civilians would die and the south-east would be harmed even further . 
  the ottoman empire decriminalized homosexuality before most of europe did , in the mid 1800s . 
  this does n't make islam less homophobic . 
  yeah , but even more countries in europe has gotten this curse now , poland comes to mind . 
  it 's really sad . 
  nope , your statement just does n't make any sense , as i 've explained . 
  i do n't think public opinion of say arabs and bosniaks are even comperable , even though they are both muslim and immigrants . 
  arabs are seen as something entirely other and different from europeans , and some people are too dumb to differentiate turks from arabs ( even though we are n't alike in any way ) and thus i get funny looks every time arabs group rape somebody . 
  it 's personal . 
  the cities were going to be turned into warzones anyway , you ca n't seriously expect turkey to not bomb fortified buildings because kurds used to live in them ? 
  yeah , you 're right . 
  yes armenia is pretty shit right now , but that 's not a valid argument . 
  u/tigranater is sour because his people would be discriminated in turkey . 
  before you whataboutism again , yes i know armenia is even worse for turks . 
  it has nothing to do with the point or the argument , get it ? 
  atleast 50 % of turkey is anti-akp , probably higher against erdogan , we 'll see . 
  not sure what you expected . 
  is there still people who are n't rabid racists in czechia ? 
  he denies being islamist ( defined as pro-sharia and anti-secular ) , but most of the opposition believes he has a hidden agenda . 
  this might be true considering the policy changes he 's done lately . 
  mustafa kemal beat back the greeks , so electro is butthurt . 
  i mean , it 's not really that special . 
  the last time i was in istanbul ( a few years ago ) i saw women in very short skirts and people drinking openly . 
  i hope it has n't changed that fast . 
  oh yeah sorry , turkey should have just given control of the cities to the pkk . 
  you 're everywhere spreading your shit , please take a fucking break . 
  http://www.gallup.com/poll/157067/views-violence.aspx read through this , americans are far more likely than muslims to accept military attacks on civilians . 
  in fact , ** 49 % ** of americans answered that military attacks on civilians are sometimes justified , versus ** 13 % ** in the middle east . 
  ** 49 precent ** and middle eastern people are the population that is ** the least likely ** to accept military attacks on civilians as acceptable . 
  scrolling down a bit , ** 85 % ** of mena people say that terror attacks are unacceptable , versus ** 77 % ** of america-canada . 
  ** 21 fucking percent ** of u.s-canada believes that individual or small group attacks on civilians are sometimes justified . 
  7 % is not high by any measure , i 'd bet a higher proportion of germans have far-right sympathies . 
  this is the muslim far-right , and it exists , but 93 % of muslims are against it . 
  that is really good numbers . 
   interests are not the same as a expansion of faith . 
  usa occupied japan , iraq and korea . 
  they did no proselytizing . 
  cultural and political expansion is on the same level as religious to me . 
  rip your argument . 
  how am i racist ? 
   `` protecting '' by any definition , does not mean that . 
  maybe you 're slow , but that is why i used '' '' . 
   an equivalent question would be to ask americans how many would support violence to expand christianity . 
  i 'm certain the number would be well below 7 % . 
  i 'm saying that a large amount of americans want to use violence to expand american interests , that is equivalent to using violence to spread christianity . 
  what the hell are you even talking about ? 
  of course there is racism in turkey , but there is more in poland , so according to your logic they need to be `` thrown out '' . 
  you 're the one claiming that turks are `` uncivilized '' and needs to be thrown out . 
  thus you are racist . 
  sorry if i hurt your feeling by using the r-word . 
  only on r/europe will you find someone defending muslim genocide because it is `` justice '' . 
  i guess genocide of lithuanians is okay now because they were forcibly converted to christianity ? 
  forcing people to convert outright is against islamic law . 
  my people ( anatolians ) converted voluntarily , we even changed our language and identity to the big bad islamic conquerors . 
  the issue is n't being grouped with immigrants , the issue is being grouped with arabs specifically . 
  arabs are considered a `` different '' type of mostly undesirable immigrant , and we get tarred by the same brush because we happen to be muslim . 
  i do n't care about arabs or somalis . 
  what negative categories are turks ** massively ** overrepresented in ? 
  i sure hope you 're right . 
  `` protecting '' means expansion of u.s dominance . 
  we converted voluntarily to islam in anatolia , so do n't use us as an example for your extremism . 
  what happened to muslim iberia ? 
  this having less upvotes than the rampaging rabid finn above has finally convinced me to take a break from r/europe . 
  nice , blanket racism . 
  turks are all `` uncivilized '' now ? 
  i realize i 'm going to get downvoted for this but i reckon racism is even bigger in poland then in turkey . 
  what is your definition of islamists ? 
  because they certainly deny being islamists and do n't support sharia law . 
  why did you reply to it ? 
  thatcher  prolapse  erdogan, 
  40 % of germans want to ban muslims ( including turks ) from entering the country . 
  that is extreme to me . 
  ask americans if violence is acceptable in `` protecting '' american interests , it will be way higher than 7 % . \u00a8 muslims always have to be perfect , no crazies and no far-right allowed , otherwise someone like you will come along and do the m&m fallacy or something ,, 
  she had an advice transplant . 
  i was talking specifically about skin colour . 
  i do n't know what you think your culture is either .
