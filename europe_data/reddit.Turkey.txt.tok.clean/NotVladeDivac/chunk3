  at least we 're not last place !, 
  correct . 
  greece simply being a part of the eurozone made it 's debt way more attractive because it eliminated currency exchange rate risk for eu investors, 
  curious , whats the driver for turkey being so low besides history ? 
  i was strictly speaking about eastern european countries , besides poland , who were usually ruled from abroad throughout history . 
  spain italy france etc have n't given up as much sovereignty as smaller countries . 
  not to mention that turkey , no offense , has more of a tradition of being a power and the populace would never accept the eu running the show . 
  the ecb has also come out and said , when the program began , that greece does not meet the requirements for its bonds to be purchased . 
  they put in a rule specifically to avoid buying greek bonds . 
  i would n't say hollande is weak , looking at his foreign policy especially . 
  i just do n't think france 's economic situation is in a strong enough position to speak when they have similar debt issues . 
  i think the significant downside is that germany is forcing greece to liquidate 50 billion euros worth of assets to secure this loan and give up more sovereignty with regards to fiscal reform . 
  i was gon na say haha , that 's suicide, 
  you said they should leave but there 's another option , having your own currency . 
  you recommended they ditch the eu , i pointed out why that 's stupid . 
  leaving the eu custom union would destroy their economy and hurt their tourism industry due to decreased integration with european institutions, 
  with qe already going on , it will be easier to soften a contagion on yields for other debt-ridden countries . 
  they veto greece getting suspended and greece in turn could block action against cyprus . 
  which is precisely why there 's an eu summit coming up to lift the responsibility of making a political decision off the ecbs shoulders, 
  how many votes do you have ? 
  jk i get what you mean, 
  putin minus the nukes and the confidence that brings . 
  i was correcting his, 
   it allows it to project it 's military strength ~ ~ in ~ ~ ** from ** europe . 
  what 's the benefit of that exactly ? 
  * you were supposed to be the chosen one !, 
  i 'm turkish american born and raised in the states lol . 
  nope, 
  lol i 'm also an american so . . no worries there, 
  i suggest watching some videos on bbq done in a smoker , for example . 
  american bbq is n't simply grilled chicken lathered with sauce . 
  gyro is the root for things like gyroscope ? 
  so it means some sort of rotation , tilt ? 
  d\u00f6ners root is ` to turn ' . 
  as is shawarma which is an arabicization of \u00e7evirme , also a turkish word . 
  if gyro means something what i think it is , it 's a translation and not a different word really . 
  bbq = / = grilling it 's a specific set of styles of slow cooking meat , with the use of smokers sometimes , that often uses various types of bbq sauces . 
  sure carolina style is different than in bbq texas style but afaik this general genre of grilling is uniquely american , in origin at least . 
  both of these cities are essentially military zones in an active civil war -- not comparable imo, 
  really ? 
  til . 
  what do you mean by regular coffee ? 
  i say this because in some places filtered-coffee ( regular coffee in the us ) is n't regular, 
  catalan , definitely . 
  russian , definitely . 
  tamil and arabic are pure immigrant languages . 
  do n't forget , turkish is a native language in eu member states bulgaria , greece , and cyprus . 
  bulgaria it 's around ~ 10 % and its higher in cyprus . 
  that 's what i thought initially . . 
  honestly , this makes it worse . 
  though it 's counter-intuitive . 
  to kill your child , you basically have to have something mentally/emotionally severely wrong with you to start with . 
  once that 's the case , how you kill them is less relevant . 
  if you 're not that child 's parent , you 're basically killing them out of rage/revenge/etc . . 
  the choice of method becomes way more disgusting at this point . 
  turkey was ardently , not just secular , but secularist for some time . 
  still was n't a fully democratic , free society . 
   b ) after reading comments here and doing further research , it seems they specifically targeted military personnel and there are no civilian casualties . 
  i think they attacked the vicinity of military installations , however , it happened in the city i believe and there 's bound to be dead civilians . 
  i mean , for example , the secretary at the desk at a military building is still a civilian . 
   a ) my absolute and sincere condolences to the families of the dead and to the turkish people in general . 
  thank man . 
   `` there were no violations of turkish airspace by planes of the russian air group in the syrian arab republic , '' the ministry 's spokesman maj. gen. igor konashenkov said last week . 
  ** `` [ even if there were ] , none of the [ turkish ] radars are able to establish the type and the nationality of the aircraft -- whether russian or of the u.s.-led so-called anti-isis coalition . '' ** does this guy know how radar signatures and flight path sharing among allies works ? 
  wait . 
  he 's lying . 
  that imam hatip education tho . 
  actually the main vehicles for anti-submarine warfare are naval helicopters and patrol planes, 
  i think there 's a nato summit/meeting very soon in brussels in which they 're going to be discussing syria/refugees, 
   where the turks treated badly in bulgaria for any reason ? 
  we had plenty of minorities during the iron curtain but those that ran away did it cause romania was fucking poor and authoritarian , not cause of abuse . 
  i think it 's mostly an issue of proximity . 
  if the turkish minority in bulgaria or n greece were to ever get too loud and try to invite in a turkish annexation of some areas because it borders us , it would be problematic for them . 
  so it 's easier to just oppress the minority than deal with turkey . 
  i guess that 's the thinking at least . 
  other issues ? 
  hmm . 
  maybe the turkish minority was n't a fan of the state atheism approach of communism but i have no idea about this . 
  just speculating . 
  probably more so what i first said . 
  bulgaria , north greece , and rumelia were the balkan territories to be lost . 
  so they were occupied longest during the wave of european nationalism , so probably went through more shit . 
  you guys were out of ottoman occupation much earlier right ? 
  also bulgaria has a large ( 10-15 % ) turkish minority who , well , have n't been treated well even after the iron curtain collapsed . 
  i 'm on mobile but if you search it up , we 've taken bulgarian based refugees within the last two or so decades and there were stories of rape/human rights abuse . 
  that 's good to hear . 
  we have our issues with bulgaria greece and the former yugoslavia states so i 've always thought turkey and romania should be tight as nato countries that are the big black sea states . 
  this man . 
  everytime i hear someone talk about how russia deserves to have buffe ** r ** s in eastern europe i just think about how much shit they put you through . 
  know what ? 
  you may not like us ( turkey ) for good reason , but when it comes down to confronting russia turkey 's got your back . 
  edit : buffers , not buffets . 
  no one would blame russia for looking for all you can eat food in europe , that 's a pretty innocent desire . 
  you realize turkey would just bomb violating ships with its airforce right . . 
  isil supporters are n't an ethnicity . 
  you ca n't ethnically cleanse a political group , that 's called something else lol, 
  that 's what i was thinking too . 
  this is clearly a political move, 
  i do n't think they 're really worried about the government budget balance in rubles . 
  that 's played up a little too much .
