  when it 's a deliberate attempt , yes you 're trying to destroy the language . 
   during the peak of ottoman power , persian and arabic vocabulary accounted for up to 88 % of its vocabulary , [ 1 ] while words of arabic origins heavily outnumbered native turkish words . 
  this was done by the state to be a proper caliphate . 
   ** ottoman turkish ** / \u02c8\u0252t\u0259m\u0259n / , or the ottoman language ( \u0644\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u0639\u062b\u0645\u0627\u0646\u0649 lis\u00e2n-\u0131 osm\u00e2n\u00ee ) ( also known as \u062a\u0631\u0643\u0686\u0647 t\u00fcrk\u00e7e or \u062a\u0631\u0643\u06cc t\u00fcrk\u00ee , `` turkish '' ) , is the variety of the turkish language that was used in the ottoman empire . 
  it borrows , in all aspects , extensively from arabic and persian , and was written in the ottoman turkish alphabet . 
  during the peak of ottoman power , persian and arabic vocabulary accounted for up to 88 % of its vocabulary , [ 1 ] while words of arabic origins heavily outnumbered native turkish words . 
  [ 2 ] consequently , ottoman turkish was largely unintelligible to the less-educated lower-class and rural turks , who continued to use kaba t\u00fcrk\u00e7e ( `` raw turkish '' ) , which used far fewer foreign loanwords and which is the basis of the modern turkish language . 
  [ 3 ] the tanzim\u00e2t era saw the application of the term `` ottoman '' when referring to the language ( \u0644\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u0639\u062b\u0645\u0627\u0646\u06cc lis\u00e2n-\u0131 osm\u00e2n\u00ee or \u0639\u062b\u0645\u0627\u0646\u0644\u0648\u062c\u0647 osmanl\u0131ca ) and the same distinction is made in modern turkish ( osmanl\u0131ca and osmanl\u0131 t\u00fcrk\u00e7esi ) . 
  from wiki . 
  well this is normal . 
  the ottoman empire at its beginnings , prior to its overexpansion , * was a turkish empire * . 
  and it ended as one too . 
  it 's just during the 200 hundred years in between , it was a caliphate , not turkey . 
  people in turkey call great britain `` england/ingiltere '' generally . 
  doesnt mean its right, 
  maybe more so that we were occupiers ? 
  regardless of religion ? 
   turkey turkey = / = ottoman empire you 're talking about a caliphate who destroyed our language . 
  the synonymous use of turkey and the ottoman empire really only becomes correct after the empire shrinks and responds to the wave of balkan nationalism , culminating with the rise of the young turks . 
  he probably just has the same mouse facial expression everytime, 
  no not d\u00f6ner either , let 's be serious here . . 
  latvia is western now ? 
  oh i forgot about kosovo . 
  shit . 
  we shoulda bombed the serbs first . 
  maybe if erdo was president then ( god forbid ) he wouldve played up the muslim suffering lol . 
  * add kebab *, 
  til . 
  hey . 
  we can protect you from your neighbors now . . wan na rejoin ... ?? 
   / s bro , why do n't we cooperate more lol ? 
  do you guys hear a lot about turkey in the news and such ? 
  for turks , hearing `` arnavutluk '' is like hearing about a long lost little brother ( not in an imperial way ) but i do n't see much concrete support . 
  i guess you guys are probably focused on eu relations , that 's why ? 
  yeah he could 've been a lot of things lol . 
  yeah well be fine . 
  truth of the matter is our old governments were n't just secular but secularist so they were shoving it down everyone 's throats . . were in a rough patch but we will reach an equilibrium and chill out eventually . . inshallah . 
  haha, 
  * sigh * we used to be a lot more like that . 
  it 'll normalize though in time . 
  cheers from turkey . 
  we still love you even if it 's one sided :d, 
  so it was mostly a christian rebellion ? 
  isnt albania pretty clearly majority muslim though ? 
  so what 's the major complaint of the occupation , besides well occupation , that albanians have considering most of y' all are muslim too ? 
  just curious because we 're only ever taught that we 're brotherly people, 
  happy independence guys !, 
  you guys still like us though right ? 
  just a little bit at least ? 
  true . 
  maybe i should 've said , compared to gaining those more powerful countries as an ally , it 's not worth buying the turkish heli even if it 's better ? 
  i 'd hope you guys would go with our helicopter because turkey would probably left you manufacture parts or whole units to sweeten the deal . 
  in the end , these deals are political . 
  you 're buying an ally , not just the helicopter . 
  i 'd bet 1 million dollars you buy the apache, 
  fair enough . 
  it 's more of a misunderstanding but there 's no chance i can convince you . 
  it 's easy to say stop daesh coming across . 
  it 's also not something europe has to deal with , having thousands of refugees fleeing active bombing and shelling all panicing to get across the border . 
  how do you screen isis members in that crowd when they could die if you delay them for 10 minutes ? 
  i like poles , so , i 'm not gon na get worked up on it . 
  at the very least we should cooperate on arms . 
  i read turkey offered the t-129 attack helicopter to poland in their competition for military procurement , so that 's exciting . 
  nato is stronger but we 're both trying to improve similar areas of our militaries , both have a fledgling but strong defense industry , and it does n't seem like west europe is as concerned with eastern security issues . 
  we must strengthen east-to-east cooperation . 
  nato . 
  i 'm talking about a bilateral one, 
  not even that but just the proximity to russia and ukraine, 
  if anything they might be a tad tighter than the russians . 
  the only thing liberal in russia is the girls putting out xddd, 
  who else applied sanctions ? 
  i think japan did but their financial markets are large as well, 
  france is more powerful than the uk . 
  also it takes half a decade at the minimum to put a new weapons system into operational service . 
  germany wo n't have time to do shit, 
  yeah uk and turkey are cool with each other for the most part . 
  its those damn continentals who really do n't like us, 
  nope . 
  turkey has redefined and reformed its combat doctrine constantly . 
  it 's ordered its defense industry to fill very specific needs to modern military requirements such as uavs . 
  currently turkey is the only european * country building its own uavs ( they 're in the prototype phase ) . 
  even the [ eads talarion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eads_talarion ) project in europe needed turkish input . 
  turkish military units are staffed and ready to go . 
  a lot of european countries have a lot of equipment on paper , however , it 's mostly in storage . 
  even worse , what 's considered `` operational '' is n't ready to go at all times and that 's very concerning . 
  when france conducted its heroic operation ( i dont mean this sarcastically , i do admire it ) to save mali from falling , they needed us logistics support and c-5 galaxys to shuttle their troops and equipment over . 
  when the uk/france led the libya operation , they needed the us for logistics and weapons support , and the us ended up flying a lot of sorties . 
  the mutual distrust between western nato allies and turkey has ensured that turkey can conduct its operations independently . 
  what you call power projection from european countries needs a lot of support from the us . 
  sure , turkey ca n't conduct a lightning operation into mali , but it 's only relying on its indigenous capabilities , that 's why . 
  kurds have no intention to capture mosul . 
  and they ca n't do it militarily either . 
  france is n't in the assad camp , they 're just willing to cooperate to defeat daesh but there will still be a political negotiation/settlement . 
  not like they 're supporting alawite conquests of all of syria, 
  i 'd prefer the cult and secularism to not having him at all and being like iran . 
  these acts of `` sophistication '' mostly came from islamic ideas of cleanliness honestly . 
  you ca n't engage in prayer without being completely cleansed . 
  some animals , such as pigs , were forbidden to eat in islam because they were dirty so the idea of sewage in the streets , uncleanly food were not even an option to muslims . 
  so it 's not really that we were more civilized ( specifically speaking about sanitation ) , more so we had no choice but to be sanitary . 
  it 's extremely ironic nowadays considering the arab world , and to a lesser degree other muslims countries , is extremely intolerant .
