good , then . 
  stop saying whataboutism to every fucking response , because it ai n't working no more . 
  over my dead body . 
  ** oh man ** please do n't bring that movie up i still have cringe ptsd from that . 
  pls, 
  no shit . 
  pls no i make kebab for u, 
  hmm ? 
  where is he wrong ? 
  dutch = nazi mods are dutch = mods are nazis, 
  glorious . 
  indeed it was shitty . 
  but on / r/europe it 's just the worst . 
  * everyone suddenly forgets about every other empire * and just thinks ottomans were literally the most demonic evil and worst empire in entire human history . 
  they do hate us . 
  do we live in different planets or what ? 
  because i 'm sure as hell that we 're one of the most hated nations of the world, 
  man you must have some serious balls to post this here . 
  i mean , really . 
  huh , i never knew the british empire controlled oregon at one point . 
  til, 
  sounds like you got triggered hard , bud . 
  if you get triggered so bad everytime someone insults turks , makes fun of turks or advocates atrocities on turks you wo n't survive a long time on reddit . 
  learn to deal with it , do n't give a fuck . 
  there are lots of turks saying the exact same thing to europe on twitter and such . 
  `` we will take back balkans hurr durr otttomans reborn ! 1 '', 
  damn man , now i wish there was a sub dedicated entirely for insulting erdo\u011fan . 
  lol . 
  i 'm a socialist and i would ** not ** hope for any coups this time . 
  it happened 4 times in our history and we know how well it turned out . 
  the turkish people voted for conservative islamists time and time again . 
  the problem with turkey is education . 
  the most important thing that should be improved is education , and education only . 
  a coup wo n't change anything , you will just make it harder for turkish people to vote for autocratic shitheads !, 
  but they will vote for them anyway , again  but if you educate them properly you will have larger chance to stop them from doing so again . 
  but as the current regime is not interested in doing that ... well ... 
  i 'm up for living under a secular military dictatorship instead of an islamic semi-democracy . 
  seriously . 
  it 's debatable if there was even democracy in turkey to begin with . 
  see you guys in a few hundred years or so . 
  hard times , friend . 
  these times will pass and a time will come , when our people are ready for democracy . 
  but in the meantime , we should learn from history and not make the same mistakes . 
  europe did n't get to their current situation by doing nothing . 
  there were revolutions and reforms and a whole bunch of other things , like what happened in 1789 and 1846 , and their people understand democracy . 
  turkey has never been democratic . 
  but there were attempts to make it more democratic . 
  like what ataturk did with his reforms . 
  or what the young turks tried to do , but failed , and did horrible things instead . 
  while the japanese became more westernised and powerful , we were dealing with minority revolts and wars with our neighbours in the 19th century . 
  i hope i live long enough to see * real * democracy in turkey . 
  where there is freedom of speech , freedom of media , and where people respect each others ' beliefs and thoughts . 
  and as if our clash with islamists and akp voters was n't enough , there are also people trying to kick us while we 're down ... 
  shit , as if the whole scandal with the netherlands was n't enough , now we 've pissed off france too !, 
   you can not be both secular and a muslim !, 
  therefore , it is not possible for a person who says `` i am a muslim '' to go on and say `` i am secular too . '', 
  and why is that ? 
  because allah , the creator of the muslim , has * absolute * power and rule ! '', 
  the akp and their followers today think that they are getting their revenge of that 1980 coup . 
  also whenever you start to argue with them they will say `` oh but the kemalists oppressed us poor muslims in the 80s !, 
   over a thousand turkish people screaming turkish stuff , and police blowing people away with watercanons pshh , that 's a regular monday in turkey . 
  how is it our self-interest to side with europe ? 
  they support groups like pkk and ypg and also support the idea of a kurdish state . 
  am i wrong ? 
  i also know russia supports ypg but that 's another entirely different matter . 
  you can even see this support in / r/europe . 
  i did n't know it was in our self interest to harm our own country ? 
  but yes you 're right we got along with europe better before akp . 
  and that 's because akp are assholes, 
  dont be fooled , europans are not allies nor friends . 
  i 'm all for criticising erdogan but referring to europe as an `` ally '' is kinda naive . 
  look at history . 
  look at recent history . 
  turkey and europe have never been friends or allies . 
  it 's the truth . 
  too many terrorist attacks have happened since these last years . 
  i understand why people do n't want to come here anymore . 
  i do tell them . 
  then they call me a european slave and a traitor . 
  totally not gay at all ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  i pity you . 
  one day you will realize how brainwashed you are . 
  soon . . 
  if you live in netherlands but still support akp then you 're a piece of shit anyway . 
  supporting an authoritarian/islamic party while you 're enjoying freedom in a country like netherlands ... 
  i feel bad for dutch-turks who oppose akp but will still be hated , though . 
  do n't be so sure . 
  no one is surprised that people judge all turks based on our government ... they are supported by around % 40 - % 50 of the country after all . 
  extremely true . 
  but i do n't think any one of us deny that our countrymen are xenophobic and backwards people . 
  we know this already , and we talk about it . 
  that is also why many of us want to move elsewhere . 
  it 's extremely bad . 
  and we know it . 
  the turks on reddit do n't even represent probably % 0000.1 of the turkish population . 
  salty, 
  while we do have * few * similarities , i dont think turkish people are anything like greeks , and vice versa . 
  it was the climate , landscape and food that made it feel similiar . 
  but that 's normal since we 're neighbouring countries anyway . 
  that is why i felt like i was still in turkey , but with no islam and akp .
