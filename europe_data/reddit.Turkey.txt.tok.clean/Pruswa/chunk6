  sultanate of rum were indeed rekt by the mongols , and the political chaos that followed led to anatolia getting disintegrated into small lordships . 
  i admit it was wrong to say that anatolia was disintegrated during the time the crusade happened . 
  but it was divided between various lordships around the time the romans were recovering from the fourth crusade . 
  it was something like [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/anatolian_beyliks_in_1300.png ) basically , with a lot of small muslim beyliks around ; these probably would have gotten conquered had it not been for the damage the crusaders inflicted . 
   this plan was established before they were approached by the claimant . 
  it 's main proponent was phillip from swabia . 
  huh ? 
  the claimant met bonifface when he went to visit phillip , the latter 's cousin . 
  phillip was the brother-in-law of the claimant , alexios iv . 
  so maybe phillip did come up with such a plan , but we will never know . 
   they did n't succeed because of incompetent leaders . 
  you are grasping at straws here . 
  ok , they succeeded because of one incompetent leader . 
  good enough for you ? 
   well they obviously did n't have any , because it was , again , too early for that . 
  yes ? 
  how is that relevant . 
   but it 's not safe to say that the empire would have survived had things developed differently . 
  well , we will never know , really . 
  would it have survived if not for the battle of manzikert ? 
  who knows . 
  would ottoman empire be still around if kamal was killed during wwi ? 
  who knows . 
  it 's a meme . 
  some turks used to write the word `` k\u00fcrt '' with an '' * '' because it can be used as an insult here . 
  then it became a meme , and now we censor everything we dislike . 
  it is more of a habit at this point . 
  defending , probably not , but there were muslims who did n't fight for the ottomans inside constantinople . 
  most probably received the treatment the japanese americans received during wwii . 
  there were muslims in the roman side during the battle of manzikert , though . 
  they ended up defecting . 
   turks were n't disorganised , they were recovering from mongolian invasions , and the sultanate of rum was collapsing . 
  anatolia would have probably gotten recaptured if not for the crusade , that made the romans miss the opportunity . 
  before the ottoman state was found anatolia was just full of tiny lordships . 
   venetians maybe in 1204 , but in another post it seems hungarians made cannons for them , and if i remember correctly the serbs and slavs helped the turks out too . 
  yes ? 
  it was n't really the evil turks vs. everyone else . 
  ottomans had christian allies and there were muslims inside constantinople when it fell . 
  how ? 
  the empire regressed back so much after the sack the then disorganized muslims of anatolia managed to surpass them . 
  had it not been for the sack anatolia would probably have gotten recaptured . 
  well , we will never know . 
  the siege proved to be harder than expected for the ottomans . 
   and for the sake of being fair we should add venetian barbarians in constantinople were slaughtered by romans few years ago before that . 
  correct . 
  but i still think the main reason was because d * ndolo was butthurt he had gotten blinded by a few hobos in constantinople some years ago . 
  but they literally are to blame . 
  i mean obviously the ottomans pulled the trigger . 
  but the venetians loaded the gun . 
  i am not `` blaming '' anyone who is alive today for something that happened 500 years ago by the way lmao . 
  ~ ~ basically , the seljuqs were rekt by the mongols . 
  anatolia was ruled by small lordships , and ripe for a roman reconquest . ~ ~ correction : all of these happened during and after the events i am going to tell you about , not before . 
  then the pope called for a crusade to take back jerusalem . 
  the plan was to sail through the mediterranean and land on egypt , and then march towards the levant . 
  the venetians would provide the ships for the crusaders . 
  however , it turned out that the crusaders could n't gather enough men to pay for them , after the ships were complete . 
  so the venetians , being venetians , would n't really just gift them the ships and be done with it . 
  a while later the crusaders were approached by a claimant to the roman throne , who promised to pay them for their ships , and also aid them in their campaign . 
  in return , the crusaders would put him in charge of his country . 
  a commander of the crusaders , a very old doge of venice who had gotten blinded in constantinople years before these events , was very enthusiastic about this plan . 
  so the crusaders and their venetian allies agreed to it . 
  the crusaders landed suddenly on the shores of the sea of marmara , at a time constantinople was manned by key units , led by very incompetent leaders . 
  the situation was so bad , the crusaders actually succeeded in their goal of desposing of the emperor and putting their guy in charge , despite constantinople 's massive walls and their lack of any artillery . 
  the guy was killed by the citizens of the city shortly afterwards , however . 
  then the venetians demanded his successor to keep his promises . 
  not only was there never an agreement between him and the venetian officers , the empire unsurprisingly turned out to be unable to afford paying for the venetian expenses anyway . 
  in answer , the venetians decided to sack the city . 
  numerous scholarly and artistic works , and artifacts were destroyed . 
  even the venetians were somewhat apalled by how savagely the other crusaders sacked the city . 
  the roman empire collapsed completely after its capital was conquered by the crusader forces , divided into three smaller states . 
  eventually constantinople was recaptured by one of the empire 's successor states , and the empire was revived . 
  but it never managed to reach its former might , even the might of the era that preceded the fourth crusade . 
  less than two centuries later , it fell pray to the ottomans , who had managed to create a foothold for themselves in anatolia and expand towards rumelia while the romans were busy recovering . 
  the venetians also refused to send sufficient help to constantinople during its final siege . 
  they literally were . 
  the breaches ottomans used to initially enter the city were opened by their cannons . 
  basilic could launch 500 kg cannonballs . 
  pretty sure that would have blown away pretty much anything given enough time , which it did . 
  romans could have stood their ground in constantinople if they received more foreign support . 
  hell , the people inside the city were hoping for a foreign intervention until the last second . 
   most minorities do realise this , not true . 
  obviously they do realize that the countries they are in are more prosperous than the countries they came from , but do n't think that `` western civilization '' is the cause of that . 
  they think that western countries are rich because they exploit the rest of the world , or immigrants . 
  that 's unconfirmed , and at that point the city was bound to fall anyway . 
  after the ottoman ships entered the golden horn , it was over for the two millenia old state . 
  actually they planned to burn them with greek fire , but the ottomans somehow caught word of it . 
  so blame the cunt who leaked it . 
  in fact , blame orban , some hungarian who built mehmed 's cannons . 
  better yet blame d * ndolo .

  they do exist ; most of the forces loyal to the syrian government are sunni arabs . 
  but they do n't call themselves `` moderates '' , because they are n't `` moderate '' compared to anyone but genuinely ok people . 
  `` assad was busy ignoring obama 's red lines '' ? 
  assad was fighting the moderate head choppers , who are backed by the west , and used to be allied with is . 
  if it was not for the western meddling , that would n't have happened . 
  ethnicity did n't really matter much in the ottoman empire , only religion . 
  the fallout between turks and kurds started after kurds refused to recognize the central authority of the turkish republic and the latter started a policy of assimilation to counter that . 
  apparently he got `` radicalized '' in libya . 
   we maybe worsened and prolonged it but that 's it . 
  you caused them to succeed .
