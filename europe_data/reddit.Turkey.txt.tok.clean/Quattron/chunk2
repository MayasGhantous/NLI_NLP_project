  nope no need to ask such stuff . 
  bomb someone 's country , they become `` terrorist '' . 
  a beautiful word to justify yourself and your past actions . 
  i do not support terrorism , i 'm just trying to make you understand why and how normal people become terrorists . 
  i have a 1 year old daughter , if a country kills her with a bombing justified with a dumbfuck reason , do you think i will care the `` innocent lives of others '' ? 
  world would collapse , nothing would mean anything . 
  did you ever see turkish , bosnian , albanian terrorists ? 
  they are muslims too , their countries were not bombed to death for the last 10-15 years . 
  that 's why they do n't resort to that option . 
  like how ca n't you comprehend it ? 
  i understand , you are trying push a narrative but at least do it more eloquently . 
  that 's not witty that 's the violation of geneva convention, 
  lets agree to disagree . 
  you are not looking like you are interested in a meaningful discussion , i do n't even know why i replied to your insulting post actually . 
  wait , i do think many of the turkish redditors are against him including me . 
  i do n't remember anyone sugar coating his actions . 
  at best maybe you came across to a couple of given up redditors who are just mocking his bullshit, 
  yup i 'm pretty dumb . 
  what can i do ? 
  local prison facility does not give me any opportunity to form an opinion . 
  the point is still standing . 
  he did not care if he held those rallies . 
  he wanted to alienate eu and wanted to get a reaction . 
  he got it . 
  now he will use it , the ones who are fired up wo n't see facts because of their clouded judgement . 
  if you really think `` dutch pm said fuck you '' was not an intentional exaggeration to prove a point then you do not get my point . 
   i know 3 languages that are completely irrelevant to each other . 
  turkish , russian and english . 
  believe me i get my information freely and as everyone on the internet . 
  strange that you think i do not know a lot about what happened . 
  i am trying to understand is it supposed to be like an insult or something ? 
  yup local prison facility and all that . 
  how `` modern and european and democratic '' of you . 
  please teach more about modernity and democracy while you insult me , i am really interested i am just observing the situation . 
  he needed an `` enemy '' and eu was that in this case . 
  eu played it very well in my opinion , it will pay off very well . 
  in eu nobody questioned why he does n't hold rallies in saudi arabia and other middle eastern countries but only in eu . 
  dont you think he didnt know this would happen ? 
  but oh well  yup im getting information from local prison facility . 
  it wasnt blaming . 
  as i said , its win-win for both parties . 
  fire up the crowds , boom you get all you want . 
  populism is lack of mental strength . 
  momentarily reactions are always bad . 
  perfect play from him . 
  and nobody is going to stop him from doing this because it also helps eu politicians too , mega super duper win-win . 
  dutch prime minister says fuck you erdo\u011fan !, 
  his votes increase . 
  erdo\u011fan says you see guys , entire europe hates us !, 
  they do n't want you to exist !, 
  they hate you !, 
  they hate prosperity !, 
  ( [ cue the alex jones clip ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cxunzrrm8i ) ) . 
  best propaganda for the upcoming referendum . 
  i thought europeans were emotion-free when it comes to making decisions . 
  you are just like us . 
  full on emotions . 
  he is doing this shit for a decade . 
  them vs us thing . 
  he tried to provoke as usual the internal dissidents , did n't work as much as planned . 
  now the eu is the `` enemy '' . 
  he will fucking win this referendum shit with the help of eu . 
  on a side note : of course germans will support our terrorists , thats how you play the game . 
  dummy you support their fascist groups , dissidents etc then why cry about it . 
  i voted for turkish elections dude not belarussian one . 
  i 'm not belarus citizen but i 've voted in the elections that 's is what this chart is about not dual citizenship, 
  fuck even in this chart there is no belarus data, 
  in turkey suicide is looked down and considered weakness in character to handle life , also religion plays a role , in islam you can not take the life god gave you , even if its your own , so if you commit suicide = instant hell people just do n't do it * generally * for these 2 reasons . 
  turkey does nothing : turkey = isis turkey does something : turkey = invader give me break . 
  well , it depends now to person to person . 
  * there are people who are crazy happy to have erdo\u011fan in power * there are people who are crazy happy to have right-wing party in power in poland . 
  * there are people who are crazy happy to have trump in power in us . 
  * there are people who are crazy happy to have duterte in philippines . 
  and there are people like me , who used to care about politics and all , but because of all this populist wave in the world , became numb to all this bullshit . 
  i used to be a conservative but last 15 years ( 2002 is when he came to power ) made me a fucking liberal . 
  so i 'm done . 
  but hey , we have less aids , so , yay ? 
  here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:linguistic_map_of_justinian_i%27s_empire_c._560.png, 
  https://www.ifitweremyhome.com/compare/us/tr i choose ** be 83.33 % less likely to have hiv/aids **, 
  as i understand , finland had to go with nazi germany because nobody helped them during their struggle against soviet union . 
  thats why im so happy that trump got elected . 
  now world knows our pain , both trump and his supporters act 100 % like erdogan . 
  a news , or a piece of fact that i do n't like ? 
  they are ** fake news ** . 
  now be gone i will enjoy my day , cant hear you lalallaa . 
  orrr are you a traitor to your country ? 
  welcome to our world people . 
  you have no idea how much support he has in redneck communities . 
  i would write here no he does n't have any public support he fabricates his support etc but its not the reality . 
  plus , imagine you are a redneck . 
  now , who gives a fuck about journalists ? 
  that 's the fucking disadvantage of democracy . . 50 % is on his side always . 
  think of it like trump supporters . 
  dude literally said you can grab women by the pussy and his supporters do n't care . 
  erdo\u011fan is the same . 
  the other 50 % is too fragmented , left right liberals etc. . so no matter what happens he seems to be the victor in this thing . 
  give us anything, 
  for you , 
  `` i am warning greece : you were saved owing to a cowardly [ turkish ] admiral in 1996 . 
  do not play the kardak game with us .
