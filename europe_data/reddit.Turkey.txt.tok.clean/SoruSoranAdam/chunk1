  #we 're \\ # 1 !!!, 
  nobody goes there because their surplus virtues are redistributed to sinners, 
  salami tactics . 
  she gets to fight turkish capitalist oppressors and go to commie heaven,

  [ there was also this incident with a turkish student ( ? ), 
  drinking at a bar in poland . 
  cities founded on thracian soil . 
  constantinople and thrace is a product of greek imperialism . 
  leave the thracians alone . 
  i would n't . 
  rojava does not want non-kurds . 
  now you know what we were talking about for years . 
  they 're sending lots of troops to west africa though , merely peace keeping you see . 
   there is evidence that it 's human nature to prefer those who are similar to you . 
  it happens on a subconscious level . 
  the nuance here is that what you consider to be similar to you differs . 
  or they 'd just be germans or russians . . 
  outdated and irrational . 
  the only reason it makes people `` work together '' is because it locks people in place from birth . 
  afaik the finns came later like indo-europeans . 
  we see immigration as a way to make more money or live in a place with a higher living standard . 
  they are simply turks who live outside the country . 
  i 'd say that a sizable percentage would move back if we were in better shape economically & socially . 
  they love rte because they 're idiots . 
  95 % of akp supporters are stupid or malicious . 
  kill brown people , play ps2 while sipping your coffee kill white people , get your testicles fried with a car battery,

  because they are/were not anti-us . 
  they were supported to counter leftist/communists and it worked really well , too well some might say . 
  hundreds of thousands of communists were tortured to death or ` disappeared ' . 
  i 'm not exactly sure if they were aware ` kemalists ' existed but they were isolationist anyway and did n't want us influence . 
  religious conservatives were in favor of privatization & pro-west while communists were in favor of getting into the soviet sphere which was an unforgivable sin for the us . 
  theory : yossi kohen is a code name used by multiple jews going back millenia . 
  it was downed by a turkish jet that took off from diyarbak\u0131r / \u0130ncirlik afaik .

  western europeans especially would rather us take the hit and not have to worry about actually confronting russia . 
  we have actual confirmed conspiracies . 
  [ 1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_gladio#turkey ) , [ 2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/susurluk_scandal ) . 
  but here 's a funnier one : [ atat\u00fcrk was actually killed by the english in libya ] ( http://www.suskunmedya.com/images/haberler//2013/11/yossi-kohen-kimdir-atat%c3%bcrk.jpg ) and was replaced by a jewish businessman called yossi kohen . 
  though i do n't know if this started as a parody of religious conspiracy nuts since there are [ so many parodies ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rxug1oma68m/umujkthboni/aaaaaaaaako/xoyxein-2-q/s1600/1401609_304528199686507_776798098_o.jpg ) of this particular image .

  if you take this down will they die ? 
  legal and regulated . 
  most prostitutes are ukrainian , russian , romanian , bulgarian and the like . 
  apparently you can just bribe the cops/bouncers to get in though . 
  it 's polonya in modern turkish but polish language is still called leh\u00e7e . 
  * . . or did you ? 
  germans take over europe , turks take over germany . 
  we will get the last laugh . 
  `` ethnic muslim '', 
  good for his career . 
  * minorities are unhappy ? 
  what 's with the empty spot in south sicily ? 
   turks often go to ukraine for sex with white girls .

  they come/are brought here illegally to work as prostitutes . 
  do n't know , in turkish he 's called `` kanuni sultan s\u00fcleyman '' which means lawgiver/lawyer since he reformed & cleaned up the legal system .

  that 's not even what happened . 
  lots of people fled west after mongols depopulated central asia ( completely destroyed the most populated city at the time , merv & killed 25 % of iran ) including a portion of my family . 
  turk dies by betrayal . 
  fitting . . 
  `` tirk oder griech '' on the original painting . 
  it just has to be about arabs does n't it, 
  why though, 
  that 's not what indigenous means , berbers are indigenous . 
  romans are not . 
  your id shows your religion .

  kant do it , busy now . 
  eh , being spineless should n't be illegal . 
  then they were disbanded , fled to the danube and started serving the ottomans . 
  seems like everybody is going `` haha they sure showed em xddd '' to something that never even happened . 
  he has a dragon under those robes . 
  i do n't think they actually sent this letter . 
  it 's a hoax/myth . 
  i think he 's just surrounded by yes men and losing touch with reality .

  terrific . 
  very high energy . 
  i know a lot of people , you know a lot of people say to me `` sorusoranadam , europe is not safe '' .
