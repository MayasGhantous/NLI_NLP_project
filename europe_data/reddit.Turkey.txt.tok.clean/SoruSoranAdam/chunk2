  i started learning english in 4th grade but i have literally never met anyone here who could speak even basic english with what they learned from school . 
  the internet made me fluent in english . 
  that 's a lie . 
  lots of people did , +90 % of my country did . 
  i myself know about 5 kurds ( from different families ) who fled the east and came to my little aegean town to flee blood feuds and honor killings . 
  3 of them are now in jail because they killed guys who killed someone from their family or whatever . 
  i 've seen a middle aged british couple full on shouting at each other at 1 am . 
  too much banter . 
  * why ca n't al qaeda kill american soldiers ? 
  i would love them *, 
  yes but the separate de/mi always seemed arbitrary to me . 
  i can play that game too . 
  kendili\u011finden = by itself/from itself kendilerindendemi = even from themselves ? 
  \u00c7al\u0131\u015ft\u0131r\u0131labilirlerlerinde = those available for work as well, 
  well we have our own mediterranean beaches , ski resorts , castles , etc. 
  we do n't necessarily have to travel outside . 
   what about stop . 
   inherently build on the values and rules provided by a religion big assumption with no evidence . 
   how can it have nothing to do with islam because only kurds do this ( in turkey ) . 
  it 's cultural . 
  ( gulf ) arabs tend to have lots of money and love spending it . 
  brits . 
  loud , spoiled and puke on the streets at 2 am . 
  * we * do n't have to keep the refugees in our country . 
  they 're not our citizens . 
  europe should take its share as the side that is much wealthier and more populous . 
  [ she joined pkk then magically joined tak just before she blew herself up . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-35829231 ) i 've been against erdo\u011fan since he was the mayor of istanbul . 
  clueless leftist . 
  it was a kurdish suicide bomber . 
  hello where is proof ? 
  should be fixed in the next update . 
  i ca n't get erection from the election, 
  i 'm sorry , i meant to say `` dependent territories '' . 
  right , romanians are slavic of course . 
  the coups are the reason the islamists are in power right now . 
  the us-backed military annihilated a generation of leftists and nationalists and never touched the islamists ( who now have the biggest persecution complexes around ) . 
  good thing i live in the slovenia of turkey then . 
  nobody will assault you or put you in jail for eating pork , they 'll just think you 're disgusting or gross . 
  hence my comparison with eating dogs . 
  there is no demand for it so most businesses do n't sell it here . 
  eating pork is as progressive as eating dogs . 
  there is nothing ` backward ' about not eating pork . 
  greek cypriots need to stop living in the past . 
  nobody cares what was what historically . 
  turks are n't going anywhere and if you want them to go , that 's exactly the reason why our military is there . 
  serbia was pretty easy to conquer , not so sure about switzerland . 
  is this is a trick question literally everyone including me says no . 
  agree on circumcision but the minaret ban makes no sense . 
   import * military aged * muslim males interesting use of language . 
  by interesting i mean misleading and spineless . 
  why ca n't our former colonies be this nice, 
   bigot victim mentality !!, 
  the central asians speak way too fast and sound primitive . 
  azeris speak funny . 
  got ta give credit to the chinese , they seem extremely efficient . 
   it 's funny how wanting to control borders or help the people in camps is linked to nazism or racism strange how only racists say this . 
  if you have to explicitly state that you 're not racist , you probably are . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/sweden/comments/471pfr/welcome_to_sweden/ ) is why people call you racist . 
  not really . 
  nobody cares about greeks anymore . 
  it 's either kurds or syrians now . 
  seems like he 's intentionally leaving out bosnian . 
  i can see southern europe from my window and i 'm not liking what i 'm seeing, 
  hungarian , [ sounds like turkish for kindergartners . 
  ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/lighterandsofter ), 
  guess it 's called * hell * sinki for a reason . 
  also exporting food while 6,000,000 + indians starved to death . 
  well half the users would n't be here because their grandparents would be gassed or worked to death . 
   does n't turkey , nato 's second most important ally celebrate the group and leaders who committed the armenian genocide ? 
  this is not unique to islam . 
  sv_pure bypass, 
  georgian is n't . 
  please upvote . 
  what animals go through daily in factory farms is nothing compared to halal ( which itself is fine ) . 
  they should stop producing meat altogether if they care so much . 
   you poor victim you . 
  they still want to pressure muslims . 
   muslim propagandists please habibi, 
  now ban factory farming . 
  nobody actually cares about the well being of those animals . 
  they just want to pressure muslims . 
  slovenia due to the yugoslav wars . 
   brutal campaign of kurdish repression elaborate, 
  that was a typo : i, 
  skanderbeg * which comes from \u0130skender bey . 
  means lord alexander in turkish . 
  nobody even mentioned it here . 
  generic slavic land locked country . 
  it looks pretty north korean . 
  [ ( roughly ) correlates to kurdish population . 
  ] ( http://earthquake-report.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/cedim-25102011-3.jpg ), 
  babies first steps to geopolitics . 
  come and tell me that when they burn belgian schools because they are used for state indoctrination . 
  you would flip your shit and demand deportation like all the other idiots here, 
  people are raging over something i never said . 
  that 's / r/europe for you . 
  please . 
  where did i say that ? 
  bomber is allegedly a syrian kurd refugee named salih necar ( pyd/ypg/pkk / theyreallthesame ) .
