  apparently they identified him with the fingerprints from his mangled body . 
  edit : * pyd , ypg , pkk are the same people with different names just like al-nusra and al-qaeda * . 
  we borrowed it from bulgarian . 
  hate sites are n't the best source for that and shame on / r/europe for upvoting this bullshit, 
  let me guess , they 're g\u00fclenists ? 
  pretty sure our cores have expired by now . 
   imperium * rojava * hmm , i wonder who could be behind this post, 
  they also still burn schools because they think schools are used for `` state indoctrination '', 
  how did they say this, 
  important to note that no arrests were made . 
  i suspect this was to intimidate them . 
  our closest rival was venice ? 
  laughable , iran fits better . 
  we do n't give a fuck how westernized you are . 
  there 's the impression that `` turkish-cypriots hate us '' because people think they are not grateful after we saved them from certain death . 
  he is a long man, 
  all neighbors except azerbaijan . 
  his name even means `` head of turkmens '' . 
   kebab is not welcome top analysis , i also get my news from memes . 
   mostly because of much lower cultural and religious differences . 
  usa is simply better at integrating immigrants ( among other things ) . 
  it ** is ** europe 's fault that they ca n't do this properly . 
  vague answers like `` cultural differences '' make no sense and is a part of the problem why you guys fail this over and over again . 
  here it is :, 
  what 's the purpose of preserving your nation ? 
  i approve this theory . 
   it 's also worth noting that camps in lebanon and turkey are essentially fenced areas filled with tents . 
  [ definitely no for us . 
  ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/magazine/how-to-build-a-perfect-refugee-camp.html?_r=1 ), 
  deport him, 
  figuratively post it then, 
  kind of a fitting metaphor for the balkan countries in general . 
  there are also rumors that he was raped as a kid . 
  naos memos, 
  but you are the european, 
  right wing bullshit . 
  all of this is bullshit . 
  you have n't seen actual self hate mate . 
   sweden democrats are n't racists doubt, 
  article says that rumor was made up by sidney blumenthal himself . 
   jesus is n't real . 
  muhammed is the god . 
  what & # 3232 ; _ & # 3232 ; muhammed is n't even god ( 200 % haram ) , he 's the messenger of god . 
  edit : checked his post history , dude seems to be mentally ill, 
  it 's the same here as well . 
  most cops/soldiers are ultranationalists . 
  patronizing bullshit , author goes off on quite the rant in the right . 
  oh that 's what it is . 
  less white people . 
  i 'm not sure about you but i would n't want to live in a ant-colony city like that . 
  i 'm literally so ambiguous that wherever i go people think i 'm a weird local . . 
  do you want to ? 
  it never was . 
  i do n't think romansch is indigenous . 
  basque is indigenous , romansch is n't . 
   if only the muslim world could open its eyes oh yeah , the muslim world so stupid it needs westerners to come and enlighten it . 
  only you know what 's * actually * going on . 
  * if you do not obey the laws of your country you should be deported *, 
  sorry but , what 's the difference ? 
  dagestan means `` mountainland '' in turkish . 
  i wand do dai xddd, 
  you bet . 
  it gets extremely bad especially in anatolia where most cities can be a couple thousand meters above sea level . 
  basically mini-tibet . 
  this happens literally every year but nobody does shit & # 3232 ; _ & # 3232 ;, 
  it does n't even rain here in mu\u011fla , i 'm walking around with shorts and a tshirt . 
  you 're not wrong . 
  `` a step in the right direction '' is n't wrong either . 
  got ta love how this generates outrage . 
  a step in the right direction . 
  how you say , they 've won my business . 
  both . 
  islamophobia is mostly racism . 
  that 's why people think white muslims can be `` saved/salvaged '' while brown muslims should be deported . 
  why not delete it after overwriting ? 
  just delete the fuckin comment , what is this ? 
  * contribute or leave leech *, 
  only morons would seriously compare the two . 
  edit : ccc, 
  sat\u0131lm\u0131\u015f ( it-was-sold ) , used to be pretty popular among the peasantry i hear . 
  i 've seen two guys named sat\u0131lm\u0131\u015f . 
  sure is getting / int / in here, 
  best example i could find . 
  [ here 's another . 
  i actually found one mark coin in my pants a few years ago . 
  i have never been in germany or know anybody who went there . 
  edward hopper . 
  i like the contrast in his paintings . 
  [ here ] ( https://ephemeralnewyork.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/nightwindows.jpg ) for example . 
  outside , cold and dark while inside is warm , safe and familiar . 
  do n't use your dots wastefully, 
  we 'll send a great general to take some land then . 
  there was an arms embargo by the us for a short while and the invasion is legally justified . 
  just bankrupt my shit up, 
  i was ( trying to ) mock the minaret & clothing bans . 
   israelis are a skeptical , pessimistic nation who have a lot of mistrust for islamic regimes . 
  they believe islamists will lie and cheat to achieve their goals , and then will be too powerful to stop . 
  a jew complaining about lying and cheating ? 
  * exactly * the same with islamists to jews . 
  not when it comes to muslims .
