  the gavurs know . 
  he never said kurdish rebels ( which they are not ) . 
  into the trash it goes . 
   turkey invades a country and calls for federalism slow down , what makes you think the government agrees with any of this ? 
  trnc is a formality since we could n't just straight up annex cyprus . 
  intriguing article for the well attention span 'd .

   do you have a video of rural turkish accent for comparison ? 
  [ inner anatolian ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vyw5nqzxv0 ) tho only the first guy can do it properly . 
  [ kurdish accent ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w6k4t-9thu ) from urfa . 
  well technically no . 
  ` truly native ' balkan languages would be pre-indo european . 
  black speech/klingon/japanese . 
  keep the passive aggressive bullshit to yourself snow-turk, 
  that 's how we fuck syria . 
  what the fug . 
  i disable inbox replies and just decided to come back here to see an aktroll sealioning me . 
  [ here . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znsftqydglq ) title : e\u011fitim seviyesi artt\u0131k\u00e7a akp oylar\u0131 d\u00fc\u015f\u00fcyor = as education increase , akp votes decrease what he says in the vid : as education levels rise , we see that the demographic that akp appeals to get smaller . 
  mi amigo we 'll hit you so hard you 'll fly into the americas, 
  they really are n't . 
  an akp representative literally said `` as education levels rise we see a decrease of votes for akp , we must fix this '' . 
  for example in their gallipoli videos they pretty much only talk about how bad it was for aussies with some `` also there were some turkish casualties but back to anzacs '' . 
  which now of course they do n't, 
  lindybeige is a moron who has his head up his ass , he should stick to swinging swords around . 
  they seem to have a bias towards the allies . 
  most battles are ` told from the allied side ' so to say . 
  would n't be / r/europe without some dumbass talking about race mixing, 
  here we go again . 
  really , do n't . 
  it 's your ( europeans ' ) fault . 
  there are less turkish people joining isis than minorities in europe . 
  # ** is turan happening ? 
   pure white, 
  what are you trying to say ? 
   is the eu openly playing geopolitics now as they always try to project themselves as this ambivalent being . 
  they do n't know !, 
  actually majority of turks support an independent kurdistan if most kurds are to be deported there first . 
  it is democratic but democratic does n't always mean moral or good . 
  they 'll always find ways to stuff unnecessary love plots in . 
  basically magnificent century from the greek side . 
  but really this would be literally awesome . 
  the type of slavery practiced in eastern europe and the americas were ** very ** different . 
   epitome of oligarchy and corruption they 're in good company then . 
  seems like everybody is content in bulgaria but poor italy gets completely balkanized , probably would be the same case here . 
  staring at people . 
  i think middle-aged and old guys tend to stare at * everybody * because they 're trying to assert what little dominance they have . 
   a russian soldier was seen carrying an air missile on his shoulder on board during the passing period . 
  this was the first time when soldiers were in ready position during a ship passing through a strait . 
  an anti-aircraft was also seen on board in ready position . 
  there is no containing when there 's player controlled france unless the player is new in which case they 'll suffocate under literally millions of rebels anyway . 
  i 'd pick ottomans but that 'd be no fun . 
  you should put in development limits to keep it interesting . 
  i literally posted a portion of the article that answers this exact question because i know nobody here actually reads the articles . 
   # ** [ the police ] made a note of the bouncer 's details , but told me that i should n't expect the same treatment in poland that i would get in the uk . 
  that in poland , white people and brown people are different . 
  '' ** he was punched because he was n't white . 
   in a post which has been shared by thousands , the 25-year-old said he was further appalled when police told him not to expect the same treatment of `` white and brown people '' in poland as in the uk . 
   he said in his facebook post : '' [ the police ] made a note of the bouncer 's details , but told me that i should n't expect the same treatment in poland that i would get in the uk . 
  that in poland , white people and brown people are different . '', 
   polish people have sent messages in their hundreds to the young man , condemning the behaviour of a minority of `` racist , dumb idiots '' in the country . 
   mr sawhney said it was not only `` ridiculous '' to be mistaken for a radical islamist , but irrelevant . 
   `` my heart goes out to muslims all over the world who are being persecuted because of the actions of terrorists , '' he told the international business times . 
  mmmm very nice my friend very, 
  we do n't really have to do anything , their own government is trying to prevent them from vacationing/working here . 
  gyro also appeared after 1974 . 
  before the greeks also called it d\u00f6ner . 
  if us was bombing sami rebels in karelia and had been harassing finland for decades , yes . 
  their objective is n't fighting isis , it 's knocking down the rebels to force a choice between assad and isis . 
   shooting yourself in the food . 
  oh no , do n't want to go hungry . 
  indo-europeans are nomadic invaders who came from the east and took over . 
  jets are not cars . 
  they can travel quite far in 17 seconds . 
  the air traffic message was in english . 
  i guess it does n't matter since the russians claim they did n't hear it anyways . 
  it was . 
  and if even nearby korean and japanese airliners heard the warning . . 
  easy for you to say half a world away . 
  i assume that whoever says that is at least 51 % wrong . 
  if you think you gain something by claiming that the truth is in the middle , clearly you do n't have much faith in your own argument . 
  they `` insist that the russian jets did n't violate turkish airspace '' , this was proven false . 
  [ in the audio record of the warnings ] ( http://www.aa.com.tr/uploads/videogallery/2015/11/25/1f38691e1a757125de988081b943e0ce.mp4 ) , they start with `` unknown ~ ~ aircraft ~ ~ ** air traffic ** '' although it 's a bit hard to hear . 
   you engage it , you set yourself on a parallel course , you make it change it 's course , that 's what ` intercepting ' means this is not an isolated incident . 
  it became such a big issue that the ambassador was called over this . 
  it was picked up by commercial airliners . 
  where is it ? 
  `` the truth is somewhere in the middle guys ! '', 
  it 's not . 
  turkey provided evidence , us confirmed it . 
  fin . 
  who in their right mind expects russia to back down ? 
  of course they 'll say they have evidence . 
   so , they 've been warned on approaching turkey airspace , not crossing it . 
  jeez , the mental gymnastics . 
  they were saying '' ** unknown aircraft ** , change your rotation or you 'll enter turkish territory . 
  change your direction immediately ! '', 
  it did n't , it was shot down . 
  you should trust turkey because turkey is the one with the cold hard evidence . 
  we use . s as ammo \u0131t 's expens\u0131ve,
