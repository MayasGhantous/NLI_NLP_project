  single issue voters in a nutshell, 
  that 's a tyranny of the majority . 
  minorities should n't be fucked over because the majority is too `` enlightened '' for them . 
  segregation is political correctness ? 
  what the fuck ? 
  at least the russian nationalists did n't rush the tunisian embassy . 
  [ also burned flags . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_pq-jnlydq ) [ aftermath . 
  ] ( http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/images/news/201511/n_91664_1.jpg ), 
  i 'll just submit the article then . 
  any objections to that ? 
  where does it say that it was shot in syria ? 
  [ look , fabric lying on the ground .

  seems like he has a llishp and nervous ticks . 
  source ? 
  ... source ? 
  this is a war zone , bit different than flying over finnish forests and the helicopter was shot down by rebels . 
  real mature . 
  all this over a russian airspace violation too . 
  yes , where did it happen ? 
  inside turkish territory . 
  how are we the ones attacking here ? 
  when and where ? 
  it 's a white supremacist dog whistle . 
  very common in / pol / and stormfront . 
  interesting use of :3 to seem less confrontational . 
  / r/europe in a nutshell, 
  there were massacres , ethnic violence & tension . 
  greece ( which was a dictatorship ) tried to forcefully annex cyprus , there could be no voting . 
  it 's not in europe so i assumed you mean the eu . 
  wait what ? 
  * we * attacked russia ? 
  you do n't look good emphasizing and capitalizing `` white '' either . 
  whataboutism . 
  just like how people go `` but what about greece ? '', 
  currently in the frontpage . 
  cyprus joined the eu after the invasion . 
  just shoot it, 
   calling colonial enslavement british india was enslaved , greeks were not . 
  they shared a state and dev\u015firme was amazing for its time . 
  it counts if they are well trained . 
  our body count is artificially high due to conscription . 
  and that 's due to secular dictatorships . 
  he went about 2km in that time and could reach a population center in 40 seconds . 
  did you know that there are different kurdish groups ? 
  some friendly , some not so much . 
  turkmen literally means `` i am turk '' , maybe he meant that . 
  [ leaked pic of turkish pilot who downed russian plane . 
  slav women tend to look amazing and slav men look mentally handicapped , that 's the stereotype at least . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3tpz8u/india_has_the_longest_queues_for_toilets_in_the/cx88h90?context=3 ), 
  that 's very old tech though . 
  also back in the day i remember seeing a bunch of `` savage arabs '' killing/stoning women on liveleak and such . 
  turns out all of them kurdish & # 3232 ; _ & # 3232 ;, 
  they were later rescued by turkish coast guard . 
  [ this is the second time they were recorded doing this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb2emjbinuy ) . 
  apparently they were literally going around in a motorcycle/car shooting anyone with dark skin . 
  i 've heard that the perpetrator committed suicide shortly afterwards but not sure about that one . 
  `` i do n't understand affirmative action '', 
  they also always separate statistics by race for example in the [ height by country chart ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_height#average_height_around_the_world ) in this article , while other countries separate by location/city , americans separate by race . 
  we lost, 
  because whenever they come a `` reign of terror '' happens . 
  hundreds of thousands of * leftists * being tortured , killed or intimidated . 
  the coups were a tool for the usa just like in latin america/greece to stop communism at all costs . 
   the balkans ~ ~ on this map ~ ~ are just a triggerfest . 
  he bragged about killing/torturing kids and old people . 
  he also failed to actually defend anything , his head was sent to mehmet ii . 
   cleared the country of thieves how can you look at your country and say this with a straight face ... 
  also fat brits . 
  nice of you to clarify . 
   so atheist   so poor   so small me irl, 
  we literally just took dabiq from isis today . . do n't throw shit at us , mi6 and cia have done and continue to do the same . 
  dutch king looks like a younger trump . 
  will northern ireland ( and maybe wales ) follow ? 
  for clarification : i 'm only talking about the [ veil on the left ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3kwedtw.jpg ) . 
  for the other two he 's right . 
  people here seem to be incapable of seeing things from the perspective of the women/muslims who actually choose to cover up . 
  by default people are assuming that dangling your ass in public ( or something of that sort ) is being free . 
  muslims think that 's simply indecent and want to preserve their sexuality for their husbands . 
  whatever your opinion is on it , this is how it is . 
  zone g\u00fclda\u011f / g\u00f6lda\u011f\u0131 ( pronounced like gueldaa/goeldau ) -  zone guldag/goldagi -  zonguldak . 
  life of muhammed & kuran . 
  same reason why people support circumcision . 
  [ reminds me of this . 
   going actively against it would plain and simple be outing yourself as a sexist . 
  [ you underestimate feminists ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jymn5yu-k_o ) . 
  it could 've been here decades ago if not for them . 
  the female pill obliterated traditional relationships like a nuke , the male pill will be similar and i 'm betting they will try to make it illegal or at least shame & harass men who use it . 
   poor guy . 
  he did n't like condoms and now has to live with the consequences of his decision . 
  it 's not the woman 's fault for trapping him , it 's his fault for trusting his partner . 
  feminist logic . 
  does n't seem healthy to have kids that late in life . 
   the trinity does n't mean there are three gods . 
  there is only one god , but his oneness is not one dimensional . 
  trinity = * there are three things which are god * no , god is one . 
  the other two are his creations .
