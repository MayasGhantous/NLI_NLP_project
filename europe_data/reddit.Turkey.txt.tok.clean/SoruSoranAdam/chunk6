  jesus is not god trinity = polytheism, 
  there 's a time and place for this kind of thing . 
  it probably took a negative connotation in russia because afaik the capital of the golden horde was called saray . 
  some colonial powers threatened to declare war unless whites ( christians ) were freed . 
  to be honest i 'm glad we did n't become communist . 
  it was a messy conflict but communism would 've been far worse . 
  north cyprus has been a part of turkey since the day it was created . 
  all the unrecognized state stuff is paperwork to avoid calling it annexation . 
  greek cypriots are right to not accept the deal currently proposed but they do n't have much choice . 
  pop singers are not artists . 
  all of that will evaporate the moment they realize how much power they 've got in their hands . 
  the eu is full of countries that ca n't wait to be taken seriously on the international stage . 
  eu will completely unify and probably turn us both into de facto satellite states . 
  besides some deviation , that 's exactly what happened . 
  seems like wishful thinking . 
  what 's with the polish and uk lately ? 
  we also have burdur which sounds close to mordor . 
  if you think this is vulgar wait till you see [ priapus ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezm1y-z6sfo ) . 
  could putin be behind this ? 
  you get thousands of sex slaves but you fuck one goat ... 
  corporations are people , my friend . 
  well the [ ` human 's cradle of civilization ' is n't doing too well right now ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iraqi_civil_war_ ( 2014 % e2 % 80 % 93present \\ ) ) . 
  that 's the turkish spelling ( with the geminated l ) . 
  hungarian/english is attila . 
   anatolia , very densely populated area . 
  population of anatolia in ww1 : 10m population of anatolia now : 80m for comparison : population of greece in ww1 : 5m population of greece now : 10m, 
  also dwarves are pretty clearly jewish . 
  greedy dudes with thick beards living in isolated communities making jewelry and good with technology . 
  russia without communism , that is . 
  i would be pretty optimistic . 
  he was pretty much as incompetent as a general could get but war with russia would 've happened regardless . 
  least we could do was choose when . 
  we could 've been living in the richest country on earth with all that combined oil money and wahhabism would not exist . 
  because they ca n't afford clothing ? 
  strongest chin . 
  for now . 
  i mean imagine if literally any other minority in usa were the head of most corporations , entertainment , politics etc and usa giving their country more aid than the rest of west asia combined and pledging unconditional support ... of course they are talented but it 's not a coincidence at that point . 
  [ related . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/warcollege/comments/3vye27/the_raid_on_pearl_harbor_or_no_the_japanese_were/ ), 
  means turning in turkish . 
  similarly , d\u00f6ner means spinning . 
  blatant misinformation . 
  what kurdish territory are we seizing ? 
  right now we 're racing with ypg to take as much isis land as possible . 
  i see the brexit propaganda was effective . 
  there are literally thousands if not millions of putin critics , some are going to die of unnatural causes one way or the other . 
  at least this dude was n't polonium 'd . 
  leave it to the scandinavians to inject feminism into everything . 
  one day , one day . 
  indo-europeans like turkic peoples were horse riders who came from the east , they were just a few thousand years early . 
  vast majority of rapes are committed by someone the victim knows . 
   i 've heard that in general slang terms a `` turk '' can describe a wide range of muslim immigrants , regardless of race . 
  i thought every muslim was arab ? 
  now every muslim/brown person is a turk ? 
  what is going on ? 
  i love how every right winger was using this factoid and now everybody is trying to explain it away . 
  well homosexuality was decriminalized in 1858 , nearly a century before sweden . 
  they tend to be whores but if they could just get over that they 'd be 10/10 . 
  there is a low level insurgency going on in austria right now , watch your posterior . 
  cyprus is in asia . 
  he 's right . 
   `` no we do n't support pkk ''  `` well yes we do but ( whataboutism ) '', 
  to be fair i threw food in the trash and tried to eat the packaging many times . 
  100 % german in language , culture , politics etc but `` different '' . 
  i think you know something else is being implied here . 
  western backing + oil money . 
  wahhabi rebellion was almost suppressed by the ottomans until westerners thought it 'd be better to have a vassal state that controlled a significant portion of the world 's oil . 
  saudis ( and salafism ) would be straight up eradicated if westerners did n't protect them but it 's too late at this point . 
  there you go . 
  how can you say this then expect them to '' * integrate * '' ? 
  as he said it 's just cognitive dissonance . 
  saudis are not very well liked in the wider muslim world . 
  the west saved them & continues to support the saudis . 
  blame western governments . 
  because you do n't face the consequences of your actions or what you say and you are being hypocritical/dishonest supporting akp in turkey and supporting some leftist party in germany . 
  we 're getting our own f\u00fchrerbunker !, 
  refugees who were ethnically cleansed from the balkans after the balkan wars were keeping the country standing but they are being massively outbred by islamists & kurds . 
   nope the kemalists are actually getting their jobs back thousands of people were kicked out , about 10-15 came back . 
  / u/melolzz is an akp supporter who lives in germany by the way . 
  probably votes leftist in germany and akp in turkey . 
  lot of people do actually . 
  nobody writes new york ( new amsterdam ) though for some reason . 
  would n't that mean `` dying for your country '' is mental illness ? 
  they do n't have to , he is one . 
  i 've heard they got this tall because there was a conscious effort not to have children with/by short men , is that true ? 
  you 're answering something that nobody said and getting defensive out of nowhere . 
  a gay person who rapes prisoners is not average . 
  there are probably some closet gays in the police force like everywhere else . 
   erdogan is very much a turkish nationalist . 
  he is whatever he needs to be in power . 
  giving citizenship to 3 million syrians disqualifies you from being a nationalist . 
  c i a, 
  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/anatolielimits.jpg east aegean is anatolia also and was populated by anatolians until greeks took over . 
  greeks were not the founders of most cities , how the fuck is this so controversial here ? 
   fezzes were found in the city center . 
  time traveling viennese , fezzes only became popular in the 19th century, 
  they were built by anatolians . 
  some cities in the coast were greek colonies but greeks took over most after alexander . 
  nope .
