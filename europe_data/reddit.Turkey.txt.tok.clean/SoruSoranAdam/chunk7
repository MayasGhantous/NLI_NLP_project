  op lives in uk by the way . 
  empty words . 
  kurds will take over in the 2050s . 
   there is still a staunchly ataturkist and secularist outlook on the western and southern coasts and they 're all soft hedonists who do not reproduce while the islamists have 3 kids per family and kurds have twice that . 
  that was me . 
  i think you threw in a us flag at a handegg field . 
  was that in 2014 ? 
   and *** see *** nothing too wrong . 
  there you go . 
  i know a lot of g\u00fclenists and they are * all * spineless , two faced and psychopathic . 
  it 's like evangelicals in america . 
  sarkozy ran against a woman in 2007 and hollande ran against him in 2012 , hollande is taller and won . 
   no harm done , he wo n't loose any vote due to this . 
  you sure ? 
  not sure how different it is in europe but in usa the taller candidates has won the vast majority of the time since tvs became popular . 
  i stand with the people of israel . 
  more like no interfaith marriage like in israel . 
  g\u00fclen is basically the final boss of televangelists . 
  dude is a billionaire with schools & such everywhere in the world that he uses to recruit people . 
  literally from the savanna to siberia . 
  tsk ( taf , turkish armed forces ) : the administration of the nation has been completely taken over, 
  or they were co-opted by fethullah g\u00fclen . 
  hope it 's the old guard tho . 
  i mean , they 'll never beat us regardless of spending 2 % or 20 %, 
  the balkans were a mistake, 
  women should n't be included for the sake of equality when everybody knows it will be massive waste of time and resources . 
  play whatever games you want with civilians but do n't fuck around with the military . 
  there is a reason why we do n't democratically elect our generals . 
  glory to arstotzka . 
  brown people go through this pretty much all the time . 
  seems like british xenophobes got a bit carried away . 
  only the `` sea power `` s ( england , france , nl , etc ) were successful . 
  land powers ( turkey , russia , china ) were wiped out . 
  / r/badhistory  western colonization built cities and actually tried to get more out of the areas it ruled . 
  that 's an interesting way of saying `` built railroads from the plantations to the docks to plunder everything as fast as possible '' . 
  literally the entire reason eastern europeans are so butthurt over the ottomans is because they were too weak . 
  you know damn well the eastern europeans would n't be nice if they were at the top . 
  how are we blackmailing ? 
  the refugees are n't our citizens . 
  it 's the other way around , the eu is extorting us . 
  i mean , it 's only going one way . 
  all other answers are cop outs . 
  the current one does n't seem fit for a permanent olympic host , they should build something lavish & huge in the ancient greek style . 
  * christianity destroyed the roman empire * . 
  not sure if sarcasm but what is it then ? 
  latin ? 
  turkic ? 
  greek ? 
   the uk does n't go around reassuring itself over its former colonies ~ ~ * because america would tell them to fuck off * because its evolved past that . ~ ~ because they do n't need to , they already get whatever they want through multinational corporations . 
  showing their commitment to nato/west , same as how we sent troops to korea . 
  # *** except ideology is a sp00k maaaaaan ***, 
  i do n't think your mom attended this event, 
   when the pleb will realize the crisis is solely caused by erdogan 's actions , the majority would abandon him , especially if there is a good right-wing alternative . 
  will never happen . 
  they would rather believe the jews infiltrated the government and caused bad decision making than blame rte . 
   asking us why we were lending support to an autocrat and an illiberal bigot to boot . 
  `` he 's not cutting off heads or blowing up anything ergo he 's a saint '' - post-911 west, 
  they could barely get to poland . 
  russia is a paper tiger . 
   they are well-organized and can be very dangerous organized to watch football while drinking tea maybe, 
  or maybe they keep us around as a zoo, 
  he 's also a [ *** jew !!!, 
  borrow as much money as you can -  fight everyone so you do n't have to pay back your debt -  plunder everything to keep the war machine going -  repeat 2 & 3 absolute genius that man was, 
  belgians despise you . 
  support turkey , nobody should assimilate to anything . 
  paying taxes & doing your job are the only things you `` must '' do . 
  you get 10 commies in one room you get 20 opinions . 
  communism , socialism , anarchism , anarcho-somethingism , etc. . 
  essentially [ this ] ( https://xkcd.com/927/ ) . 
  if only you could teach your commie friends these , seems like they 'll keep repeating the previous generation of commies ' mistakes over and over again, 
  western propaganda to agitate minorities, 
  you are a traitor and an enemy of the people ( probably a fascist too ) . 
  prepare to be liquidated capitalist scum, 
  so you are willing to sell your country for bananas ? 
  it was a paradise . 
  those were just traitors seduced by capitalist money . 
  because voters are corrupt as well . 
  they want a piece of the pie for themselves and if they take a stance against corruption they might get in trouble as well . 
  literal translation is `` ignorant anatolian dog/hound '' . 
   hardcore lol what, 
  * deport them . 
  well there are a few differences : - everybody but germans seem to be having children above replacement rates whereas in turkey everybody but kurds are having less children . 
  i think the germans should think about upping their fertility first . 
  - more turks go to turkey from germany than the other way around , kurds are n't going anywhere . 
  - ethnic conflict claimed more than 40,000 lives in turkey whereas in germany i doubt it hits 3 digits . 
  - it does n't necessarily mean the average turkish family has more kids than a german family ( tho i would n't doubt it if that were the case ) , it could also mean that the average turkish woman is more likely to start a family than the average german , therefore technically having more kids . 
  western women tend to choose career over family so that could skew the statistics . 
  - the average kurdish woman in the east has ** 6 ** children . 
  i doubt most urban families could even afford to have that many . 
  rojava and bashur are already de facto independent so as soon as they stop infighting they 're good to go and in turkey most kurds desperately want to keep the status quo . 
  maybe because they know they can take the whole pie with patience instead of taking a slice of it but that 's a bit conspiratorial . 
  yep . 
  worst thing is most people go `` so what if the majority is kurdish ? 
  we just need to get along : dddd '' . 
  not even going into how idiot muslims say `` we are all believers fam we are brothers '' ... 
  it drives me crazy . 
  i feel like i 'm witnessing yugoslavia going off the rails in real time . 
  they offer no explanation as to what actually needs to happen for us to live in peace * while we are in a mini civil war right at this second * . 
  it seems like people literally believe a miracle will happen and all ethnic tension will disappear over time . 
  what can we even do at this point ?
