  they expect one of us in the wreckage , brother . 
  whatthefvck, 
  have you started the fire ? 
  that was the deal , i have no problem with not getting the visas but then you have no right to demand us to keep refugees in our own cities when we * already have the most refugees on earth * . 
  if we did get free borders , most people going to europe would be kurds by the way since they are the most dissatisfied and poor . 
  they 'd just go to europe instead of going to western cities like \u0130zmir or \u0130stanbul . 
  [ babe there is nothing harsh about this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rmgrild.jpg ), 
  literally whoever tried to implement his incoherent philosophy ended up creating hell on earth . 
  % 40 of kurds do vote akp , how does that contradict what you said ? 
  there are 5 million kurds in istanbul alone . 
  what if your son prefers to stay at home ? 
  in the 1920s there were about 500,000 kurds in turkey . 
  the government at the time thought they were a negligible minority that would assimilate in a few decades . 
  now there are 15,000,000 + kurds in turkey .

  pretty funny with the goofy american accents . 
  thank you for your input . 
  they ca n't speak good turkish either . 
  very strange people . 
  we are always at fault and we always will be . 
  keep our borders closed : letting refugees die keep our borders open : letting in terrorists stay out of syria : watching as terrorists run amok get into syria : invading a foreign country become the country with the most refugees on earth : it 's our responsibility to treat them like they are our citizens and if we do n't we are blackmailing europe, 
  i agree . 
  al beni means `` take/buy me '' in turkish . 
  d\u00f6nme means religious convert or transexual in turkish , also from turning . 
  if it 's so easy they should n't be making mistakes like that , then . 
  mostly against secularists . 
  there are almost no christians or jews here so nobody cares about them . 
  that 's the entire point . 
  the coup was a desperate attempt to get erdo\u011fan before he could get them . 
  they failed . 
  he did n't articulate his point in the best way but he 's got some wisdom . 
  are you stupid because you were conquered , or were you conquered because you are stupid ? 
  hmmm, 
  that 's because most of arabia/north africa is uninhabitable so only the rivers have large settlements . 
  he never said this . 
  it was made up by an american journalist . 
  he did however use the phrase `` books that are thought to have come from the sky '' . 
  halfdan was here . 
  day of celebration !, 
  jets were on their way to shoot down erdo\u011fan 's plane but were warned not to by russia . 
  ca n't wake up, 
  she actually has a turkish father and tatar mother . 
  [ someone from security ] ( http://imgur.com/a/p52jb ) was the shooter . 
  hatay was annexed after his death . 
  also his last name would be kemal if his father had n't changed his name . 
  sounds like marxism to me . 
  just this week they were trying to bring in a law that made you not guilty of child rape if you marry the child you raped that 's because it was a distraction while they were passing another law that got `` atat\u00fcrk 's principles '' out of the constitution or something . 
  people fall for it every single time . 
  probably to give state protection to turks in cyprus . 
  true , but if somebody throws up an accusation of terrorism i will be mirroring that right back . 
  the invasion was to stop greek terrorists , actually . 
  why are you saying islamist ? 
  it was pretty clearly a regular nationalist war . 
  german politicians get applauded for `` standing up to '' rte , rte gets applauded for `` standing up to '' europe . 
  win-win for both parties . 
  pretty funny if you ask me . 
  this is why we do n't want the almanc\u0131s back . 
  let 's not pretend otherwise , the eu will unify . 
  it might be at a specific date or it could one step at a time with authority of individual states being stripped one by one until they ca n't actually get out of the eu because they no longer have independent militaries , institutions , infrastructure , etc. . 
  whether you think that 's a good thing or not is up to you , but let 's not pretend that it wo n't happen .

  the northern countries still use a ton of non-hebrew names like harold , frank , eric , alfred , carl and so on . 
  it would be boring otherwise . 
  armenians seem to have an unexpectedly high sense of self importance . 
  we do n't care about armenians and never have . 
  would trigger us more to put a kurd flag in there instead . 
  iirc more than 80 % of buildings in istanbul will not be able to withstand the coming earthquake . 
  everybody knows this but nothing is being done . 
  [ a similar one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_%c4%b0zmit_earthquake ) where 15000 + people died happened in 1999 . 
  not worth the time to put it on translate then figure out the meaning of each poorly translated sentence one by one just to see what some nut job said a decade or two ago to be honest . 
  that does n't blame greeks though . 
  this is about something the eccentric mayor of ankara said . 
  he also erected this [ 6m robot statue ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kqu6b8d.jpg ) then after people complained he was wasting tax payer money he got it removed and put this [ 3m dinosaur statue ] ( http://i.imgur.com/glnavdb.jpg ) in its place . 
  he has a bunch of [ these giant statues ] ( https://img.haberler.com/haber/802/ankara-da-kavsaktan-sonra-avm-onune-de-robotl-2-7281802_x_o.jpg ) for some reason . 
  interesting , i 'll just learn greek then read this article . 
  elaborate . 
  a massive earthquake is coming to istanbul . 
  tens of thousands will die but nobody does anything . 
  more jihadis in britain , more kurdish egalitarian vegan feminist freedom fighters in turkey . 
  why not ? 
  who 's going to build kurdistan if nobody wants to live there ? 
  well i guess you know what you 're talking about . 
  wish i knew people 's fantasies that well . 
  i wo n't comment on this issue as i would be banned permanently . 
  interesting theories but has putin ever `` praised '' himself ? 
  trump loves sniffing his own farts but putin seems to be entirely backed by his reputation . 
  what a smug fucking frog, 
  i agree . 
  we can still bring back the empire . 
  which they would , given the opportunity . 
  our conservatives agree with the government unconditionally , interesting . 
   also : let us count the boatloads of money we pay for refugees , including the bribes for turkey turkey has the most refugees ** in the world ** . 
  what europe pays to keep refugees out is n't even close to what we 're spending on feeding , sheltering and educating them . 
  we still have n't got the visa-free travel that eu promised while we kept our end of the deal . 
  we all knew eu was lying from day 1 but the stupid government agreed to it . 
  probably were threatened with something . 
  are the northerners doing any `` research '' / marine archaeology in the dogger bank ? 
  not an argument .
