  and we have never broken any of those agreements . 
  also a reason why we do not charge the ships going through our straits in istanbul and gallipoli . 
  we could if we wanted to , but that would be against the agreements we signed before . 
  we could make more money than egypt does every year , $ 40b . 
  it must be hard for people like you to believe , however turkey has evolved into a maturity level that it first wants to act within legality of international laws before its own interests . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bulgarian_empire alright , i stand corrected . 
  i knew that there were empires such as bulgarian empire , macedonian empire etc. . 
  i was just a bit lost in the dates . 
  but that still does not change the fact that we did try , and actually did also succeed , to invade that area while being under the flag of roman empire , which was before the creation of ottoman empire . 
  and if you paid some attention , there are maps in your source : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bulgarian_empire#/media/file:bulgaria_simeon_i_%28893-927%29.svg now tell me , what did bulgaria have to do with greece , serbia , romania , ukraine etc. . ? 
  right . . 
  they are ** empires ** afterall !, 
  so that must be it !, 
  multinational entities called as * empire * . 
  as you see , ** all ** the european countries ( almost ) had empires . 
  and in fact , almost all the empires created on this planet , were created by europeans !, 
  invading other countries was the trend at that time . 
  you mean the good ol' 15th century ? 
  well bad news for you , there was not a country named `` bulgaria '' or `` cyprus '' at that time to begin with . 
  and the nation of turkish republic is the same nation of the roman empire . 
  and our nation did not rule all those territories under the flag of ottoman empire in the first time . 
  roman empire did rule those places too . 
  think of it as just a change of name and language . 
  til saying a country is a terror state = i hate that country . 
  / s i love armenia and its people . 
  its culture also has so many similarities with our culture . 
  but nothing still legitimates armenia 's terrorizing actions in its region . 
  yeah i apparently believed you when you said you secretly hate all your foreign friends and all other foreign people . 
  what did armenia have to do with nagorno-karabakh in the first place ? 
  that area was none of their business to begin with . 
  i said turkey is a guarantor state of the island and its population . 
  it had and still has official and legitimate rights to intervene in its states whenever it sees it is necessary . 
  and about israel . . what ? 
  what is ` british palestine ' ? 
  if you meant like , going into palestine to stop the terrorism , yes , israel had and still has the right to do so . 
  that is also why israel 's blockage on palestinian territories are also legitimate . 
  but what does israel have to do with armenia occupying other countries ? 
  and about kurdistan , there was never a country named ` kurdistan ' to begin with . 
  turkey , ottoman empire , roman empire or persian empire ( all the countries related to that area ) never fought or invaded such a country in history before . 
  what does that have to do with armenia and its occupation with azerbaijani territories in the first place ? 
  but oh well ... 
  lets first get you out of your troll army and put you in conscious state of mind !, 
   why are you occupying cyprus and parts of kurdistan ? 
  first of all , what is kurdistan ? 
  i 've never heard of such name of an area , yet alone a country . 
  secondly , turkey , as a guarantor power of the cyprus island , had the right to intervene militarily when it sees there would be such a need . 
  after the coup in the cyprus , and greek massacres on turks on the island started , turkey did not just rush to invade the island . 
  turkey waited about 10 years before acting . 
  the usa tried to get the greeks in line with ` democracy ' for so long , but it failed . 
  after then , turkey used its international rights and intervened into the island and occupied an area of the island to create a space for the turks on the island to be able to survive . 
  well that escalated quickly . 
   finally , there was never a genocide '' . 
  what does genocide have anything to do with occupying a territory of azerbaijan ? 
  you are just a racist . 
  armenia is being nth but a terror state , doing nth but being a puppet of russia . 
  things will not end well for them . 
   you assume that unemployment benefits let you live a fine life . 
  no , i do n't assume that . 
  because i know that it is impossible as i know what economy is and how it works . 
  it simply is the circulation of money . 
  if all the `` wages '' would be given by the state ... what is the point of it ? 
  people would have to spend that money on something . 
  but when they do that , somebody else would have to earn it . 
  so the state would never get the same amount of money it would give by paying all the people in the country . 
  and thus such a system is unsustainable . 
  we call it ` communism ' when the state owns all the companies , so that the spent money can also be earned directly by the state . 
  but that system is a total failure and could not indeed let anyone live a normal life , yet alone a fine life . 
   1 euro in romania buys you a lot more than in denmark that alone shows the lack of capitalism the eu has . 
  which also proves the need of those kinds of implementations to create a balanced environment all across the eu for movement of capital , goods , services and investment . 
  hahaha , no . 
  state does not expect you to be productive while giving you unemployment benefits . 
  it expects you to live . 
  which country on earth gives all its citizens the same amount of free-money all day/everyday and it is considered as unemployment benefit there ? 
  ` murica . 
  minding to elaborate ? 
   it 's not . 
  it 's exactly the same . 
  i said that in response to your suggestion that this should n't happen . 
  no , it is not the same . 
  in your theory , the state also expects people to be productive somehow while paying them free-moneys . 
  in today 's world , state hands out funds to the unemployed for that they are out of job , so they need money to survive . 
  i am also wondering how the flying fuck can you expect a state to be able to give all the nation free money that might in your theory , contradicting the reality in every way possible , lead everyone to be productive in their own manners ? 
  what is that any different than communism in the first place ? 
  oh , right . 
  in communism , you 'd be paid according to how productive you are . 
  but in this system of yours , you 'd be paid the same with everyone regardless of what you do !, 
  god , it is even worse than communism !, 
   maybe it 's better for the state to pay people without giving them a specific task . 
  so you are talking about state giving people money and leaving them alone so that they can be productive in the ways they desire ? 
  how the fuck is that any different from unemployment funds we today have ? 
  for that to happen , we would need all the factories/farms etc to almost completely run human-free , all the work done by robots/drones . 
  humanity is not there yet . 
  that would have been in the benefit of all the europe . 
  a proper taxation union is necessary . 
  it is one of the biggest imbalances in the eu economy . 
  also minimum wage shall be equalized all across the europe . 
  and eu countries shall get the rid of social welfare funds for unemployed and shall adopt systems like `` job guarantees by the state '' , so if you are unemployed , it must be because you do n't want to work , so that * you need to pay to the state * instead of * the state paying you * . 
  belarus did that and it is very logical . 
  all the eu states would start having budget surpluses . 
  after that , a debt union and budget union could easily be created .
