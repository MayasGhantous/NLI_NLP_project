   you do have freedom , once you demonstrate you 're competent . 
  as i said before , that is unpractical . 
  how am i gon na demonstrate i am competent ? 
  just knowing the name of a political party or not knowing , might prove that i am competent or not ? 
   why do n't they allow people to just enroll in any university without entry exams ? 
  because it matters when it comes to professions . 
   is n't that against my freedom ? 
  you are agreeing to be tested by the education system once you decide to go to university , because there is a system . 
  voting is a right , where going to a university is a privilege . 
  the subjects of what you are expected to know for that exam is known and decided . 
  but again , * no one could decide what to ask people and what to expect of them to know * in order to be able to decide whether or not * the person is not a stupid * as you said . 
  well , there were no upvotes . 
  so you make the math . 
   do you think people should have basic knowledge of politics before they 're allowed to vote ? 
  yes , i do . 
   do you think people should be enforced to show that they have basic knowledge of politics , like having to go through a test when you reach voting age ? 
  no , i do n't . 
  because that is against the basics of freedom and democracy . 
  no one could also decide what to ask people and what to expect of them to know . 
  considering the downvotes , / r/europe is pro-isis . 
  [ head of pkk : `` the pkk is no longer aiming for an independent kurdish state . 
  we will try a political solution . 
  we do not want to fight against turkey any more . 
  we say , that 's enough . 
  neither us nor the turkish state has achieved our goals through war . '' ] ( http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkeys-fight-with-the-pkk-is-heading-toward-an-end.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=80913&amp;newscatid=409 ), 
   well they 'll be buying them soon . 
  well , not all of them is buying . 
  and defense industry , having such high level technologies and capable companies to provide those goods and services , are also dramatically important for the entire economy of the continent . 
  and more domestic military hardware = more trade surplus/less budget deficit . 
  spending such high amounts of capital on domestic markets = more jobs/faster circulated economy/more prosperity . 
  eu needs a new fighter , with features and capabilities similar to f-35 . 
   ... or turkey is illuminaty and they are behind all of this ... [ ^ ^ seems ^ ^ like ^ ^ ukraine ^ ^ needs ^ ^ more ^ ^ freedom . . ] ( http://i.imgur.com/f8asjrv.jpg ), 
  well , we need to start from somewhere . 
  the benefits of possible huge high-tech european companies in europe are also obvious . 
   it 's important to support a ) an european manufacturer exactly . 
  eu 's economies will only get united more with each other over time . 
  we need huge high-tech companies just like the us does . 
  their benefits will be felt all across the europe that way . 
  also it could dramatically increase eu 's trade surplus as well , by dramatically reducing already low imports and dramatically increasing already high exports . 
  it would also give the eu the power control mechanism between foreign espionage - privacy - anti-terrorism !, 
  well , others were also expansionism . 
  [ soon ... ] ( http://img-1.onedio.com/img/719/bound/2r0/551d3310b943c2ea0d102a55.jpg ), 
  that was not the news i 've seen , it has been a while . 
  about that specific news i just found googling : oh well . . xd i did not expect thailand . 
  yeah i kind of mis-explained it . 
  sorry for that . 
  wow lol . . 
  i first thought like `` wow . . 
  almost all the world allows it except for those arabs and . . oh wait a second ! '', 
  xd i still kinda could swear that i 've read somewhere that 3 males had married with eachother in europe before   . < < edit : http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2972542/they-look-like-new-boy-band-s-world-s-three-way-sex-marriage-gay-thai-men-tie-knot-fairytale-ceremony.html oh well . . 
  just wondered . 
  i kinda had heard that some country in eu allowed up to 3 people marriages . 
  is multiple marriages possible in netherlands ? 
  the problem is not that africans know more about sex than europeans do . 
  what makes the difference between the growth rates of populations of europe and africa is the difference of life style . 
  europeans should focus on that . 
  otherwise poverty and unemployment will also remain as big problems . 
  they are already solidly growing , and their debt is now in a decreasing pace . 
  austerity measures exist for a reason . 
  greece 's true sustainable gdp is far lower than what it is now . 
  austerity measures force them to adopt a sustainable economic model , with lesser deficit , lesser debt , bigger growth rate , more employment over time . 
  it was not germany . 
  and they paid it already . 
  * they would be sanctioned to the oblivion . 
  * a new euro crisis = !, 
  not good for any economy that exists on this planet . 
  * they get almost all of their daily things from outside . 
  how will they get euro/dollar necessary to buy those goods and services ? 
  so yeah , they would turn into dark age . 
  * and because they would also be sanctioned as hell , they will not really be able to interact with any world economy . 
  * already a communist party is at the power . 
  now think of what might happen if they might get sanctioned as well and their lives would go more chaotic , with no goods/services foundable in the country , and no currency to buy them in the first place . 
  they would join russian federation in an instance and become a total failed colonized state of another failed country . 
  * their gdp would free-fall as no one will be really wanting to use their currency . 
  * they would lose the only sector they have , tourism . 
  the country would literally go back to the darkages . 
  * there would be a real inflation then as there would be no goods/services and the currency would be useless at most . 
  * the unemployment would be far and far higher , and these all would happen even if they would not be sanctioned and kept tourism sector up . 
  good that atheists will be the far majority by 2100 . 
  do you actually understand the fact that it is not about merkel , but a european country nearby eu being invaded alive ? 
  scotland deserves representatives in the european parliament . 
  the same goes for wales too . 
   us ambassador : serbs are `` a bit schizophrenic '' ** for no reason ** yeah , nice source you got there :  ... the recent statement by u.s. 
  ambassador michael kirby that serbs are `` a schizophrenic people '' ** because they `` look towards russia with their heart and toward the eu with their head , '' ** ... http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics.php?yyyy=2015&amp;mm=04&amp;dd=07&amp;nav_id=93732 ** b92 ** * vs * ** inserbia.info **, 
  author apparently removed it . 
  probably not soon . 
  but eu really needs to have a proper economy union , including a debt union and a more active eu budget . 
  any other source ? 
  that would big a big deal and many news agencies would have reported it , right ? 
  other than that , i know we have claims on some of the islands in aegean sea . 
  afaik they are 4 small islands very close to our soil in the south of izmir side . 
  their names are not apparently mentioned in louzanne agreement , so turkey claims that they should have been kept under the official control of ottoman empire , thus turkey . 
  after the claims , greece built some buildings on them . 
  but as they do not really matter economically or strategically , the dispute issue has been let stay the same since 2004 . 
  it has been a decade since , and our side did not really push for anything yet for those islands as the subject is not urgent and there are more important matters to be busy with . 
  i was not talking about all greek victories . 
  he seemed like he was talking about the wars they had with specifically us . 
  that is also why i said * 500 years * . 
  otherwise i 'd have to say * 650 years * or so . 
  i answered your question clearly .
