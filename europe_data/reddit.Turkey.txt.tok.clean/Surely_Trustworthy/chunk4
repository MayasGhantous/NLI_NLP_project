  i think you know perfectly well what a \u015feriat\u00e7\u0131 is . 
  you called yourself a non secular turk , maybe that does n't also mean you do n't support secularism over sharia but that and your other comments made it seem a lot like it . 
  and here you go for the quote about `` as education levels rise we see a decrease of votes for akp , we must fix this '' . 
  so you are not butthurt over it at all but you still refuse to let it go and recognize it , got it . 
  lol yeah sure you only fought a war over it and havent even considered recognizing kosovo 's independence , that 's how little you care that it 's not your land, 
  the guy is an actual \u015feriat\u00e7\u0131 not just our average uneducated ekonomi \u00e7oh iyi akp voter otherwise i wouldnt give a shit, 
  yes , every single poll shows that they are less educated poor people so it 's a 100 % fair assumption . 
  how come we never see you \u015feriat\u00e7\u0131 retards on / r/turkey ? 
  the area he 's referring to held by isis and the opposition currently in north aleppo governate is not anywhere near kurdish majority . 
  even a lot of the areas held by ypg are arab majority which is why ypg friendly fsa groups rule there . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/free_syrian_army bullshit . 
  watch less russia today . 
  fsa who are secular were by far the biggest players for the first two years of the war . 
  and they would have been big without the west 's support . 
  that was not at all pkk 's doing , that was erdo\u011fan and similar previous conservative politicians doing for conservative kurds ' votes and part of their attempt at joining eu . 
  one of the few logical moves from them . 
  right now pkk is just hurting hdp 's cause, 
  well vast majority of bosniaks are still completely secular but you also have this situation going on https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3uixu0/bosnia_and_herzegovina_a_stronghold_of_salafism/, 
  it 's not like that , they just do n't give a shit about the criticism they hear because the economy is good , and they are too religious and uneducated to even consider voting the for secularists because they think they will ban religion and remove all mosques . 
  but at the same time they are hypocrites who do n't really give a shit about religion when it comes to it , so there 's no chances of turkey turning away from secularism . 
  many of the most common , most sold newspapers , and most popular websites and tv channels are critical of the government, 
  also bosniaks until saudis sent mosques to europe and they got radicalized both in bosnia and in the diaspora . 
  azerbaijanis also give less shits about religion than much of christian europe and same for turkic people in central asia + russia, 
  it was blockaded from turkey for occupying lands that belong to azeris , stop making shit up . 
  armenians did n't even make up 0,5 % in 2/3rds of the land they are occupying now . 
  yes , that 's the demographics for 1/3rd of the areas that are occupied by armenia . 
  this . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nagorno-karabakh#/media/file:location_nagorno-karabakh2.png but the rest of the areas they are occupying only had 0,4 % armenians . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_the_nagorno-karabakh_republic#ethnic_groups_.5b20.5d_.5b21.5d and it was n't 500k azerbaijanis expelled , it was 800-900k total . 
  azerbaijanis have every right to be pissed about this, 
  he threw out your army which consisted of greeks that is true . 
  he had nothing to do with the armenians in eastern anatolia . 
  and nothing to do with any killed greek civilians who werent a part of the population exchange https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greco-turkish_war_ ( 1919 % e2 % 80 % 9322 ) #greek _ massacres_of_turks, 
  no he was n't you fucking idiot do n't talk if you do n't know shit, 
  turkey had nothing to do with shooting the parachute though . 
  as purcelusul said on a lot of major news outlets in the world and also on some local press , i can find it later if you want, 
  it is n't getting little coverage at all, 
  nusra are listed as a terrorist organization . 
  http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkey-lists-al-nusra-front-as-terrorist-organization.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=67322 russia fights beside assad , whose forces has also beheaded people , and with whom isis ca n't even begin to compete when it comes to killing civilians in masses . 
  russia also faciliated tons of their homegrown jihadis going to syria . 
  i do n't even support erdo\u011fan in the least but this is a double standard . 
  g\u00fclen is the guy i 'm talking about , the leader of an islamist cult , you can read all about how his followers use violence and beat their own people to keep them in the organization , he 's not moderate , his goal from the beginning was to infiltrate state institutions and had a disturbing amount of success doing that . 
  some of the low level soldiers that also participated were just forced who had no idea what was going on , but it was g\u00fclen who executed it from the top . 
  and now akp has the idiotic idea of bringing back the death penalty to execute him if they can get him deported to turkey . 
  you are just ignorant of the situation , this is just one example out of tons , they are doing this for 3-4 decades . 
  [ pkk massacring a kurdish family in diyarbak\u0131r by suicide bombing ] ( http://www.dailysabah.com/war-on-terror/2016/08/11/family-of-5-killed-by-pkk-terror-attack-in-turkeys-southeast ) they also blew up tourists and constantly kill kurdish and non kurdish civilians in south east , for 40 years . 
  and this has nothing to do with supporting erdo\u011fan either . 
  [ schools opened to teach kurdish ] ( http://www.sozcu.com.tr/2014/gunun-icinden/kurtce-egitim-veren-okullar-aciliyor-598286/ ) [ schools with kurdish as the language of instruction ] ( https://onedio.com/haber/sivan-perver-ve-mezopotamya-vakfi-kurtce-universite-kuruyor-99621 ) [ kurdish in public schools ] ( http://www.radikal.com.tr/turkiye/kurtce-5-sinifta-secmeli-ders-oluyor-1090770/ ) how can you allow kurdish in 1991 and allow media in kurdish , tv channels , radio etc. 
  in the 2000s without allowing x , q ( not y ) etc ? 
  right , you ca n't , it 's not possible . 
  you 're bullshitting . 
  that media outlet was supporting pkk terrorism , had nothing to do with it being kurdish language , otherwise we would have to go close like a million tv channels with kurdish music . 
  isis controlled that region since 2014 when many airstrikes and artillery was fired on them , on top of supporting and training kurdish peshmerga for years , and supporting rebels against them . 
  the coup plotters were islamist cult followers , they were allied with erdo\u011fan for 14 years and helped him arrest secular army generals and judges etc. 
  until they became enemies in late 2013 after the corruption scandal . 
  so they 're not an upgrade from erdo\u011fan at all , they 're equally bad . 
  if they had succeeded it would be chaotic with a lot of deaths in a prolonged period since they have no public support whatsoever , at least with akp they can keep the stability . 
  erdo\u011fan has n't been that tough on the secular opposition since the coup attempt either . 
  suicide bombing kurdish and turkish civilians for 40 years , killing tourists , slaughtering any kurd who opposes them while claiming to give a shit about kurds , killing hundreds of civilian doctors , engineers , teachers sent to help kurds is textbook terrorism . 
  pkk have never done a gram of good for kurds . 
  kurdish has not been banned since 1991 , it was only banned in the first place because of a universally hated military coup that mostly targetted leftists and right wingers . 
  today there 's kurdish education in public schools , kurdish as the language of instruction in universities , schools opened to teach kurdish , tens of thousands of place names changed to kurdish , kurdish media , a million tv channels with kurdish music , radio etc. 
  you just pulled that number of civilians killed out of your ass , it 's total bullshit . 
  and no historian believes the shutting down of rebellion in dersim was genocide , take your historical revisionism elsewhere . 
  difference is that was made up bullshit about one of the most intelligent ethnicities in human history , i mean 25 % of nobel prizes from jews who make up 0,2 % of the world 's population . 
  whereas it 's statistical fact about muslims in europe . 
  it 's more likely muslims in europe will be the nazis of the future than the other way around . 
  well if you compare them to the roman empire or ancient greece you have a point , but that 's setting the bar very high . 
  it makes more sense to compare them to contemporary empires whose goals were expansion , creating a stable income by taxation and holding land , trade lines etc. 
  like the habsburg empire , the russian empire , the safavids , the ottomans also left quite significant linguistic , cultural , architectural traces behind , but that 's mostly in the balkans and various arabic speaking countries . 
  but they all came after a long line of other states in those areas going back over a millenium , so they did n't cause half the world to use one script for example . 
  the byzantines had however started to decline hundreds of years before the time the ottomans started conquering the balkans and the middle east , in big part due to egypt , the levant , north africa etc. 
  falling to arabs after islam , and the ensuing crusades which aimed at taking back former christian places from islamic empires , but the crusaders also ended up making enemies with the byzantines . 
  later the renaissance and printing press happened , and the ottomans did n't keep up with these advances such as printing press due to religious fanaticism and similar stupid reasons . 
  if you ask me abrahamic religions screwed the world pretty hard , i mean there 's a reason why you 're talking about ancient greece and the romans , and not some of the middle ages ` the dark ages ' european empires where religious fanaticisim screwed people a lot . 
  i wonder how history would have gone without abrahamic religions , how much bullshit could have been avoided . 
  after the west has been secularized , now the same long ass process has to take place in majority muslim countries . 
  so unnecessary . 
  to be fair that was 900 years after turks conquered anatolia though . 
  coming from exactly those areas in the east . 
  well yeah the ottomans were pretty relaxed for a caliphate . 
  but caliphates and sharia still suck . 
  that along with the other 10 + countries is still very good for a country that six years before had abolished a caliphate and removed sharia if you ask me . 
  it 's social democracy , not socialism . 
  very crucial difference . 
  yeah nice bullshit except greeks were the ones responsible for mass graves with turkish cypriot civilians , killing 130 turkish civilians in two days , and ethnic cleansing of tens of thousands of civilians , along with the long list of other things . 
  tmt was purely a reaction , a counterforce to the civilian butchering eoka , they were n't active until several years after eoka were killing turkish cypriots . 
  again if you 're going to lie and refuse to be objective in the least then just do n't even comment , you just end up making yourself look retarded . 
  i 'll repeat myself . 
   and you 're twisting what happened completely by judging the perpetrators , the factory workers as if they just woke up and felt like attacking greeks , rather than actually understanding that they were 100 % convinced that the same thing happened against turks in greece , so they did n't do anything that in their mind was anything more than a reaction to what greeks had done against them . 
  actually acknowledge this for the sake of objectivity if you 're going to comment on it at all . 
  just stop with this bullshit and blatant lies . 
  cretan turks were massacred and forced to flee in their hundreds of thousands years before a very small minority left with the population exchange . 
  you know this perfectly well without me saying it , you just do n't care about being honest . 
  and all cypriots knew this perfectly well , and the turkish cypriots were rightfully very afraid of the real possibility of suffering the same fate thanks to the aggressive enosis demands for many years before any violence broke out . 
  you were the ones that started the massacring with 130 turkish cypriots in two days and 417 + in total . 
  and the ethnic cleansing of tens of thousands , and the arson , the threats , the shootings , the hostage takings of hundreds of civilians , mass graves of turkish cypriot civilians . 
  the ` innocent greeks ' you 're talking about were militant eoka terrorists . 
  you know the people remembered as the ones that killed hundreds of civilians for political goals .
