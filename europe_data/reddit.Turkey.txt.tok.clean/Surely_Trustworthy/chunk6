  for you , self determination means massacres of hundreds of turkish cypriots , you can take that self determination and stick it where the sun does n't shine . 
  greeks would never have had 10 % of such a situation on their hands if it had n't been for the murderous behavior towards turkish cypriots . 
  you are 100 % responsible for what happened on account of your actions . 
   greeks also lived under fascists and were getting massacred . 
  not for the ethnicity and religion they were born with they were n't . 
  side note : greek neo-nazi fascist golden dawn got nearly 10 % votes in greece . 
  just a completely irrelevant fact . 
  you came with a retarded argument about turks destroyed mosques to make greeks look bad , which the fact that anyone could actually believe that is just amazing , they were somehow doing that while being slaughtered in the hundreds . 
  you know nothing whatsoever . 
  133 turkish cypriots were slaughtered in 2 days . 
  nearly 400 were killed in a few years . 
  a coup by literal greek fascists was the event that prompted the intervention by turkey to protect greek cypriots and guess what , foreign media was sympathetic to the turkish cypriot side because we were 100 % in the right to intervene to protect turkish cypriots people from being slaughtered by greek fascists . 
  you know absolutely zero so do n't comment . 
  hundreds of people were slaughtered and you think it 's even 1 % comparable to some autocratic russian leader who annexed someone elses land to stay in power and steer atttention away from a shit economy when nothing was happening in crimea previously . 
  and no , the turkish government did not at any point whatsoever kill alevis or kurds for being alevis or kurds . 
  do n't comment when you know nothing . 
  throughout the 70s , leftists and nationalists despised each other and hundreds of leftists and nationalists were killed by each other . 
  most alevis are leftist leaning , but the majority of leftists were sunni just because of demographics . 
  and some extremists killed primarily alevis because they held a meeting with someone who translated the book by salman rushdie and they were butthurt about it . 
  you do n't even know 1 % of this stuff but still you think it 's in your place to comment . 
  kurds had bad cultural rights ( ! ), 
  in the 1980s because of a universally hated military coup leader , that 's also true . 
  you did n't have the slightest clue about it but still you 're commenting as if you know anything . 
  that 's a bunch of bullshit and you know it . 
  133 turkish cypriots were killed in two days , 400 turkish cypriots were killed in the next years , did they kill themselves to make greeks look bad ? 
  that 's the level of idiotic arguments we 're talking about . 
  270 turkish cypriot mosques were desectrated . 
  but of course turks were running around doing that while being slaughtered . 
  lol . 
  what you meant to say was they go against what you wish to be true , and we somehow paid various european 18th and 19th century historians to report like turkish nationalists want it to be . 
  they were 100 % of the sources written there, 
  yes he was , i do n't go around claiming things without being certain . 
  for the pogrom , as well as other things . 
   they were charged with violating the constitution , ordering the istanbul pogrom , in which 57 greeks were killed , and embezzling money from state funds . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/adnan_menderes#coup.2c_trial.2c_execution here , english source . 
  conservative governments maybe have done so but no one except islamists has anything good to say about him in turkey . 
  the fascist coup was there to stay right until turkey intervened as was our right . 
  foreign coverage was generally sympathetic to the turkish cypriot side because there was nothing surprising or unfair about intervening to protect turkish cypriots from fascists and massacres that had started over a decade before . 
  you like to pretend it 's the aftermath that 's problematic when none of you would give a shit if turks had to live under the greek fascists and continue getting massacred . 
  yeah and turkey also desperately wanted to intervene to protect turkish cypriots then but was prevented by the us . 
  in case you forgot , there was also that whole greek fascist coup in 1974 before the intervention . 
  and they did so because the autocratic government then had told them that greeks had done the exact same thing unprovoked in selanik/thessaloniki . 
  one of the leading reasons that leader was hanged a few years after . 
  here . 
   throughout the ottoman rule , the demographic ratio between christian `` greeks '' and muslim `` turks '' fluctuated constantly . 
  [ 31 ] during 1745-1814 , the muslim turkish cypriots constituted the majority on the island against the christian greek cypriots ( tcs being max 75 % of total island population ) ( drummond , 1745 : 150,000 vs. 50,000 ; kyprianos , 1777 : 47,000 vs. 37,000 ; [ 32 ] [ 33 ] de vezin , 1788-1792 : 60,000 vs. 20,000 ; kinneir 1814 : 35,000 vs. 35,000 ) [ 34 ] however , by 1841 , turks made up 27 % of the island 's population . 
  [ 35 ] one of the reason for this decline is because the turkish community were obliged to serve in the ottoman army for years , usually away from home , very often losing their lives in the endless wars of the ottoman empire . 
  [ 36 ] another reason for the declining population was because of the emigration trend of some 15,000 turkish cypriots to anatolia in 1878 , when the ottoman turks handed over the administration of the island to britain . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_cypriots sources 31-36 at the bottom . 
  it was n't anti religious it was strict secularism . 
  and it was the best thing we ever did . 
  18 % of muslims in the uk think homosexuality should even be legal . 
  what exactly is not representative ? 
  why ? 
  they are urging/encouraging people to have children . 
  i do n't think you appreciate how vital this is , focusing on the details of the message is silly . 
  and people are also free to highly encourage others to have children because it 's crucial to sustain the country . 
  your perception of things do n't factor into statistics . 
  what do you call this ? 
  done in an extremely systematic manner by people i would , to put it mildly , call the scum of the earth .

  isis have killed hundreds of turkish citizens in terrorist attacks , and they were firing missilies across the border for weeks and killing and hurting tons of people . 
  we need them off our border and that has been achieved now which is extremely important . 
  and secondarily it also stopped ypg , who are openly closely allied with pkk from taking the border as that is also very dangerous for turkey . 
  do n't understand why this even needs to be explained but there you go . 
  no , rum is greece because byzantine empire  eastern roman empire . 
  we actually just call you romanya . 
  bulgaristan was n't as lucky though . . 
  oh yeah blond , blue eyed people . 
  i think the majority are radicalized online however . 
  i did n't type that angrily , ca n't really convey emotions over a reddit comment . 
  i did n't mean to say they are going because they hate the kuffar , but that is how extremists look at people . 
  they define everyone by their faith first , nothing else comes close in importance , and the majority of muslims are not even muslims according to them . 
  and they hate them as well as actual non-muslims . 
  the goal is to establish a caliphate , and they want to do that with jihad in a holy war , and the terrorists who go there are muhajirs , like early islam , that 's what they actually believe . 
  and that 's the ideology we have to fight , because that 's the only thing terrorists have in common . 
  there are blond eyed english converts who are terrorists , just as there are highly educated people and criminal losers who go . 
  all united by this salafi jihadist ideology . 
  i think we basically agree on the other part , we need to educate people to understand why these groups should have their freedom to do exactly as they want . 
  not just say they need to change their laws because we say so . 
  these ideals are very important , but people need to understand the reason behind them and appreciate them , you ca n't just impose them . 
  so , christianity doesnt approve of gay people either . 
  but they stopped judging people by what they personally feel is moral based on their religion . 
  not everyone is devout and not everyone is even religious , same and increasingly more in muslim countries as well . 
  you cant force people to adhere by your religion that they think is false . 
  even if they are muslim , so they are doing something haram . 
  so is drinking alcohol and having girlfriends/boyfriends before marriage , i assume that happens in morocco as well . 
  does anyone kill them , beat them up and disown them for that ? 
  so why when its just another haram thing ? 
  there are equally many gay people in morrocco as in western countries , they just have to hide it their whole lives . 
  hundreds of thousands of people . 
  in countries where homosexuals are completely free they make up 3 % or something . 
  there is zero harm in that other than according to illogical religious morals . 
  about the democracy thing , well they obviously already want a more democratic society given the arab spring . 
  then there 's just the social issues left . 
  and those will come with time as well , i 'm not talking about forcing it , no one can change their laws but themselves . 
  it 's about convincing them that it 's actually a good idea to allow women , gay people , atheists etc. 
  to have full freedom . 
  and the terrorists do what they do because they hate the kuffar and want a caliphate . 
  they did n't analyse societal changes and then realize they need to go be terrorists .
