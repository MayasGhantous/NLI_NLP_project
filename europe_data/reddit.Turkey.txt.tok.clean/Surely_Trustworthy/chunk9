  kurdish feodal culture is pretty abhorrent . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/female_genital_mutilation#ethnicity 58 % rate of female genital mutilation in the capital urban cities in krg . 
  and south east turkey is famous for child brides and honor killings and other things like that . 
  even the electorate of the kurdish ` secular progressive ' party is less supportive of secularism than that of the ruling islamist akp party . 
  it 's not really up for discussion that their mentality is very problematic . 
  i 'm kinda opmistic that that is only at worst true short term , over time the vast majority of people even originally from backwards places will leave behind conservative attitudes due to education/exposure to new ideas , internet etc. 
  but it takes time , we just need to be patient . 
  i do n't think the current situation is that horrible either depending on which angle you look from . 
  no , this is factual , 80-90 % of the city consists of people either born in anatolian or eastern areas or 2nd/3rd generation people who have significant family from where they originate and are still partially or fully in that backwards mentally from the place they come from . 
  i 'm talking about immigration starting in 1960s/70s or so . 
  istanbul is a city made up like 80-90 % of anatolian and eastern immigrants . 
  apart from a few neighbourhoods ( kad\u0131k\u00f6y , be\u015fikta\u015f maybe ) it 's not that progressive honestly . 
  the people in eastern thrace , the aegean region and much of the mediterranean region are much more liberal/modern . 
  for example fatih in \u0130stanbul has to be one of the most conservative places in all of turkey . 
  57 % rate of fgm in the capital ( ! ), 
  of krg . 
  right , nothing more secular than 57 % rate of fgm in erbil ( which is the capital of krg , wonder what its like in rural places ) , being famous for child brides and honor killings in south east turkey . 
  gulf arabs dont even do extremely backwards shit like fgm , dont try to fool people . 
  there are thousands of kurds in isis and the commander leading the offensive against kobani was a kurd . 
  dont try to take advantage of unknowning foreigners with stuff you dont even believe in yourself . 
  you are not even 1 % as secular as turks , every single statistic and survey on the planet proves that beyond any doubt . 
  you really showed him by posting some story no one has heard of . 
  so why did you put up the whole ' i like atat\u00fcrk and kemalism ' bullshit for ages when it was all a lie ? 
  i mean surely you did n't just accidentally miss that part of history . 
  that 's what atat\u00fcrk and kemalism is . 
  lol , barzani 's father and himself are probably the most popular kurds of all time , they have a legend status for fighting against saddam and iraq decades ago before tayyip even graduated high school . 
  and he won i do n't know how many democratic elections . 
  and he has criticized erdo\u011fan plenty of times . 
  and you do n't know shit if you think most kurds hate turks endlessly and do n't want to get along with them , live with mutual respect and develop good relations . 
  talabani said the exact same , that pkk ruins any chance for there to be good relations between turkey and iraqi kurds , and represses any other kurdish group because they are far-left autocrats like that . 
  like how ypg/kck burned and imprisoned syrian kurdish groups simply because they have other political views . 
  democratic people 's republic of korea right there . 
  tell that to the 90.000 kurdish local soldiers fighting pkk in south east turkey . 
  tell that to \u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc , the most powerful man in turkey for decades who was of kurdish ethnic descent , or turgut \u00d6zal or b\u00fclent ecevit who also both had kurdish ethnic descent and won many elections and lead the country for decades . 
  tell that to iraqi kurdistan which turkey has been very closely allied with for many years and trained and supported their army peshmerga for years before and after isis came , and developed and invested heavily in the region and indicated they would recognize if they ( iraqi kurdistan ) declared their independence . 
  tell that to the many millions of kurds and turks married who spent their lives together in turkey . 
  how about this video from batman in south east turkey with people listening to the kurdish version of a song which roughly translated means `` i 'll die for you , turkey '' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33t6iiyocs8 got ta love foreigners who do n't know shit about kurds and turks who think supporting far left maoist maniac terrorists , who are despised by normal kurds who want to improve their lifes and economy and live friendly with turks , is the right way to oppose erdo\u011fan . 
  it 's has to be one of the most retarded ideas i 've ever heard of . 
  except erdo\u011fan is the closest ally of the iraqi kurdish leader barzani in the region , and peshmerga have been trained heavily under akp , and said he would recognize an independent iraqi kurdistan . 
  the big difference is those are not hostile to turkey as ypg/kck allied groups in north syria are ( who by the way are rivals with barzani and attack his party 's branch in northern syria ) . 
  if the dominant kurdish group in northern syria was barzani allied , erdo\u011fan would probably be working closely with them . 
  yeah okay sure . 
   right-wing extremism pro lgbt rights , pro israel , worked closely with ayaan hirsi ali who 's somali , but he 's a right-wing extremist , really ? 
  he said critical things about a 1400 year old religious text which resulted in him wearing a body vest and having armed guards protecting him at all times , but he 's the extremist not the people who hold the ideology that made that necessary . 
  he 's the bigger problem for stating something so obvious about a 1400 year old religious ideology from an extremely primitive desert tribal society . 
  greenland is part of denmark not the netherlands . 
  dude i 'm pretty certain you 've never heard anything of any election before erdo\u011fan . 
  the thing is turkey has never until erdo\u011fan elected someone who was in any way against atat\u00fcrk 's principles of secularism and the sort . 
  no one . 
  b\u00fclent ecevit was a secularist who won many elections , s\u00fcleyman demirel , mesut y\u0131lmaz , tansu \u00c7iller etc were centre-right secular liberals . 
  and erdo\u011fan himself in the first elections was not the way he is now , he was very close with the west and in general did n't start shitstorms or do anything too horrible . 
  and there was quite a lot of of economic growth for a decade straight which is why he gets any significant votes in the first place . 
  plus he 's a conservative muslim , he does n't want to abolish some sense of secularism ( in fact they have not in 15 years spoken against secularism as a principle ) , but he does want to make the society more conservative clearly . 
  i 'm pretty sure misir in macedonia meaning egypt comes from ottoman influence and arabic originally , not slavic . 
  no , most states near the western border except the very north-west are traditionally more catholic , but bavaria is known as the most religious of them . 
  but the states in central-west and south-west germany are very mixed catholic-protestant so they may only have pluralities rather than majorities of one kind . 
  you approve of kosovo 's independence ? 
  let me guess , either you are an ethnic minority or a serb ` traitor ' who would get lynched for stating your opinions in public ? 
  lol, 
  the issue here is you actually bought into this idiocy about ` kurdistan ' . 
  no one who knows 5 minutes of middle eastern history takes that stuff seriously . 
  north syria ( along with all of north iraq which kurdish nationalists also claim as ` kurdistan ' ) has a 5000 year old assyrian history which arabs invaded after islam and hundreds of years after islamized iranians/kurds specifically along with arabs raided and settled in some of those areas ( in the saladin era ) . 
  a lot of the arabs in north iraq and all of syria including the north of it are simply assimilated ethnic assyrians who are now identified as muslim arabs . 
  kurds are an iranian tribal mountaneous people from central-western iran who simply moved into those areas from the outside ( iran ) . 
  erbil for example is the capital of krg , iraqi kurdistan who want independence from iraq . 
  it was a solely assyrian city for many thousands of years until the mongol army invaded it 700 years ago and then after they left shortly after , kurds moved in there . 
  it 's not historically kurdish in any way shape or form . 
  and repeat this with every inch of land kurdish nationalists claim is kurdistan in syria and turkey . 
  kurds in turkey moved into it after the ottomans allied with kurds because of sunni-shia battles against the safavids ( shia empire in iran ) after the ottomans fought with other turkic states in east turkey and conquered the region from them . 
  these : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/artuqids https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/a%c4%9f_qoyunlu https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kara_koyunlu and you 'll say oh but what about turks and armenians in east anatolia etc. 
  but there 's a big difference because 1 . armenians have a country that includes many parts of historical armenia , assyrians do n't have a country and we do n't do like kurds are doing now in assyrian places in iraq and syria , imprisoning christian assyrians and priests and stuff like kurdish nationalists in north syria , along with wrecking arab homes and throwing them out in iraq and syria to kurdify regions . 
  https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/11/13/iraqi-kurdistan-arab-homes-destroyed-after-isis-battles http://bianet.org/english/world/169000-joint-statement-by-armenians-assyrians-against-pyd and 2 . we do n't try to make up history instead of saying we conquered what is today turkey a thousand years ago from the outside like kurdish nationalists do , they claim all sorts of completely ahistorical things about not being from iran that make anyone who knows a bit about middle eastern history cringe hard . 
  you need to differentiate between rightful non-armed peaceful activism for cultural rights and aiding armed terrorist groups and being solely motivated by kurdish nationalism rather than actual genuine grievances which hdp is guilty of in mass scale . 
  you can go ask turkish communists who think every kind of nationalism is retarded on / r/turkey who wanted to support them but were pissed at hdp for constantly having weapons found in their election campaign cars and for doing hardcore kurdish nationalism and praising pkk terrorists instead of actually doing fair things like ask for cultural rights and advocate leftist economics ( their wish not mine ) . 
  north syria is a very mixed region , the hasakah has an arab plurality and the tal abyad region in north syria has arab majority along with significant amount of assyrians besides kurds , it 's not in any way dominantly populated by kurds , which should be the basic prerequisite . 
  and the region west of the euphrates in jarabulus , al rai , azaz , al bab , manbij etc. 
  is even more dominated heavily by arabs and turkmen with kurds being a very small minority . 
  the fight is against isis supported by local fsa groups that includes some local kurds as well , and they 're negotiating with russia/assad at the same time , and russia even gave air support to the campaign against isis there recently . 
  finally it was pkk who murdered two policemen that ended the peace process before turkey responded back to that , we did not end it , you 're wrong about that . 
  that was the topic in the thread and that was what we were talking about . 
  and i 'm not a grooming gang apologist , and i do n't share the culture and heritage of the human scum who did those things , my south asian muslim ` friend ' . 
  you downplayed grooming gangs and did apologetics and then deleted your posts . 
  do n't see what 's weird about it . 
  you can very fairly and logically blame the institutions and the priests and find a pattern that would lead you to think something is rotten here , and there 's something systematic that leads to this disgusting behavior . 
  frankly you would be a completely naive and oblivious person if you did n't think there 's something inherent in the authority of the priests , the teachings , the institutions , the mentality , the lifestyle , something that in some way leads this to happen repeatedly on such a scale . 
  and it 's the same thing with these disgusting human scum who had tens of grooming gangs all over england for decades and thousands of victims . 
  there 's something completely fucking wrong in some way that this happens on such a massive scale . 
  this is not south asian sikhs doing this . 
  or buddhists . 
  or relatively secular minded bosniaks , albanians or turkish cypriots in england . 
  who said i wanted to do that ? 
  you 're trying to downplay and diminish tens of asian and african muslim grooming gangs that have gone on for decades and had i do n't know how many thousands of english girls as victims because obviously one has to basically be a neonazi for talking about it , and that it has been going on on a massive scale and saying , `` oh look , catholic priests have also been perverse pedophilic criminals '' . 
  no , he 's talking about this : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rotherham_child_sexual_exploitation_scandal https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/derby_sex_gang https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aylesbury_sex_gang https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/keighley_sex_gang https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/halifax_sex_gang https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oxford_sex_gang https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bristol_sex_gang https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peterborough_sex_abuse_case https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/banbury_sex_gang https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/telford_sex_gang https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rochdale_sex_trafficking_gang https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_doublet, 
  that 's simply a matter of time purely speaking mathematically if you continue having open borders , so it 's not really an argument to say it has n't happened yet . 
  besides i have to say i 'm truely offended by the islamophobia and racism and nazism of calling it bullshit as if it would be a bad thing if it was true . 
  well he 's just saying that stuff for a domestic audience , it 's just stupidity no actual effect or meaning of it, 
  tfw a stupid joke causes this much butthurt the homosex lobby thing comes from slavs/putin , not greece . 
  but yeah of course muslims are much worse at this , are you kidding that goes without saying lol . 
  maybe , but your future liberators kinda sorta do . 
  anti homosex lobby masculine orthodox union when ?
