   as for support of previous coups , yes , the us supported secularist coups against governments that tended towards islamism in turkey . 
  as we established , gulen is not a secularist . 
  `` in total , 50 people were executed , 500,000 were arrested and hundreds died in prison '' it 's not about islamism . 
  while people crying here about purges , usa backed government arrested 500,000 people and supported authoritarian regimes .

  well , i do n't think so . 
  even at 2100 they will not be the majority . 
  * kurds have a higher mortality rate . 
  * every year tens of thousands of kurds are leaving turkey . 
  * while the birth rates of the turks have been stable for 10 years , the kurds ' birth rate has fallen sharply and continues to fall . 
  * many kurds marry turks . 
  * in the last 20 years turks have started to return to turkey from abroad ( included turkic population ) . 
  this rate will increase even further after erdogan goes .
