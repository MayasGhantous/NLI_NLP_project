  hypocrisy of erdogan . 
  any evidence about your claim ? 
  nope . 
  erdogan is all talk . 
  ataturk 's vision is democratic . 
  m. kemal atat\u00fcrk laid the foundations of a truly modern turkey , a democratic , republican and independent state based on national sovereignty . 
  although these ideas originated from him and were paramount in the foundation of the new state they remain today an integral part of the republican government of our country . 
  the foundation stone , or perhaps even the very soul of atat\u00fcrk 's spiritual and intellectual philosophy , was the thought of universal peace and although the biggest part of his life was taken up by war to defend his country , he always considered it a crime . 
  `` authority , without any condition and reservation , belongs to the nation . '' -- mustafa kemal atat\u00fcrk `` my people are going to learn the principles of democracy the dictates of truth and the teachings of science . 
  superstition must go . 
  let them worship as they will , every man can follow his own conscience provided it does not interfere with sane reason or bid him act against the liberty of his fellow men . '' -- mustafa kemal atat\u00fcrk https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mustafa_kemal_atat%c3%bcrk#establishment_of_the_republic_of_turkey http://www.atam.gov.tr/dergi/sayi-19/ataturk-populism-and-democracy, 
   that 's your problem . 
  i do n't care about the turkish referendum . 
  then europeans must stop whining about democracy in turkey . 
  okay . 
  lies hurts too . 
  you are not funny . 
  pkk is a terrorist organization and a national threat for all turkish people . 
  + kurds are not massacred by turks . 
  yes , it 's a choice . 
  there wo n't be civil war . 
  get out and talk with some \u00e7omars . 
  majority of them wo n't support civil war . 
  you know that they ca n't attack people randomly . 
  even majority of \u00e7omars wo n't accept civil war . 
  you are exaggerating . 
   is this looks like passive to you ? 
  yes . 
   there are so much more \u00e7omars than us and government forces will be against us too , yes , but seculars do n't give up without a fight . 
  tolerant and empathy ends . 
  both sides disgust each other . 
  if erdo\u011fan pushes us , there will be an answer . 
  this can easily turn a civil war if army divides too . 
  i hope you are aware that army is under control of akp now . 
  what can you do ? 
  there will be a lot of dead . 
  well , i wo n't fight . 
  you can fight alone then . 
   yes , they mostly are . 
  those events can be easily another discussion tho , what i really pointed was mara\u015f , \u00c7orum , sivas and other massacres , ones they killed and burned alive their own citizens just because they think they are not religious enough . 
  it 's because agression of armenian gangs etc. 
  there wo n't be civil war in turkey . 
  you 're exaggerating . 
  have you ever talked to people around you ? 
  kemalists , secularists ... are very passive people . 
  you are on propaganda mission . 
  you are racist . 
  i accept crimes of turkey as well . 
  but i wo n't accept lies and biased informations . 
  you are delusional , are n't you ? 
  if i go i can show you tons of crimes of countries in world especially uk and kck terrorist organization .

  there was `` solution process '' . 
  the turkish government and the pkk agreed on peace . 
  according to the agreement , we wanted the pkk to leave turkey ( pkk camps are located in north iraq ) . 
  but they did not keep their promises . 
  instead they were organized in the cities , dug trenches everywhere , placed explosive traps , blocked main roads with armed terrorists ...
