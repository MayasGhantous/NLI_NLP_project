  `` once i get to my stop , i 'm getting off . '', 
  also he said `` democracy is tool , not purpose '' . 
   that does n't mean harcore kurdish nationalism . 
  apo has had a change of ideology . 
  the crimes committed by the pkk terrorist organization explain everything . 
  i do not need your lies . 
   you are showing me a chart of what voters of hdp believe and not what the party 's ideology is which is left-wing secularist . 
  they only advocate the kurdish movement . 
  they do not really talk about other issues . 
  i think the reason they claim to be feminist , pro-lgbt is just show . 
  i 'm sure they really do not care about lgbt , woman rights . 
  i 've never seen them defending feminists , lgtb except one time few years ago . 
   that 's not how political parties work . 
  has hdp supported any islamist policies ? 
  even within the party there are islamists .

  they refused to sign document . 
  these rhetoric are meaningless as long as hdp support terrorism . 
   they are not `` harcore kurdish nationalist '' at all . 
  oh , come on . 
  do n't lie .

  never trust erdogan !, 
   turkey can say whatever it wants that 's why i am telling you interntional law justifies euphrates shield operation . 
   turkey broke peace for erdo to win votes but you should never start a war you can not end . 
  is that why pkk terrorist organization carried conflicts to cities ? 
   bombings wo n't stop if erdogan occupy syrian kurdistan . 
  operation against terrorists organization wo n't stop either . 
  we will never give up no matter what . 
  and if we fail in syria , more refugee will go to europe my greek friend . 
  no , pkk broke the peace treaty . 
  the pkk terrorist organization promised to leave turkey .
