  just ? 
  those girls are the modern slaves of the future used for the akp 's interests . 
  pkk is terrorist organization . 
  you ca n't compare ataturk with terrorist ocalan . 
  i do n't believe pkk supporters want a peaceful resolution either since pkk broken ceasefire/peace process . 
   the hdp has denied any connection to pkk . 
  when ?

  a theater about the 2016 turkish coup d'\u00e9tat attempt, 
   persecution of ottoman muslims also known as the genocide of muslims refers to the persecution , massacre , or ethnic cleansing of muslims ( most prominently ottoman turks ) by non-muslim ethnic groups during the dissolution of the ottoman empire . 
  the 19th century saw the rise of nationalism in the balkans which resulted in the establishment of an independent greece , serbia and bulgaria . 
  most of the local muslims in these countries suffered as many died during the conflicts and others fled . 
  the persecution of muslims was continued during world war i by the invading russian troops in the east and the caucasus and during the turkish war of independence in the west , east , and south of anatolia . 
  after the greek-turkish war , a population exchange took place and most muslims in greece left . 
  during these centuries many muslim refugees , called muhacir , settled in turkey . 
  ** 2 million people ( military personnel included ) were killed .

   not exactly hard to find . 
  and that 's not even talking about the constant attacks on the u.s. allied kurds fighting isis while turkey itself was sitting on its ass or actively aiding . 
  [ ankara bombing : female suicide bomber ** spent time in syria ** ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2016/03/15/middleeast/ankara-bombing-female-suicide-bomber/ ) the tak who committed suicide bombings in ankara are considered as heroes and glorified by the pyd ( pkk 's syrian wing ) in syria .

  [ kck is a kurdish political organization committed to implementing abdullah \u00d6calan 's ( leader of pkk terrorist organization ) ideology of democratic confederalism . 
  the kck also serves as an umbrella group for all the apoist political parties of greater kurdistan , including the pkk , pyd , pjak , and p\u00c7dk .

   they 're not trying to take out the entire turkish armed forces , they 're merely sending a message and taking revenge for their losses , ensuring that they 'll not be the only ones taking a hit . 
  if possible they would take entire turkish armed forces even turkish civilians . 
  do you think turks will give up fighting against kck ( pkk , tak , ypg ... ) ? 
  we will fight 40 years more if necessary . 
  republic of turkey will never give up and keep fighting against terrorists . 
   i do n't think they have any legitimacy to do that , it 'll only make things worse and actually help pkk on the long run . 
  let me remind you that even pkk does n't target civilians . 
  if we are are talking about kck . 
  yes , tsk has legitimacy to attack kck since [ kck targets civilians . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kurdistan_freedom_falcons#attacks ) cleaning kck terrorists from north syria and north iraq will make things easier for turkey in long term . 
  if we can clear north syria from terrorists , we can send refugees here . 
  thus , we can prevent 3 million ( maybe even more ) refugees in turkey from going to europe . 
   turkey has already invaded syria and attacking the kurdish-arab alliance there . 
  invade is wrong term . 
  http://www.un.org/en/sections/un-charter/chapter-vii/  article 51 nothing in the present charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a member of the united nations , until the security council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security .

  turkey said the operation was an act of self-defence , in response to isis and kck ( pkk , ypg , tak ) terror attacks . 
  also that `` our border must be completely cleansed of terrorists '' . 
   my understanding is that they view the civilians the same way the turkish state does . 
  while not targetting them , they view them as collateral damage which is why labelling them as terrorists is ironic . 
  i can open my archive and prove you are wrong . 
  i have a valuable time that i do not want to waste . 
  so , here i will give you just 2 links . 
  also let 's stop denying the fact that tak is off-shoot organization of pkk . 
  even hrw , usa govternment ... do n't deny anymore . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kurdistan_freedom_falcons#attacks https://np.reddit.com/r/terrorist_pkk/comments/4u8k5k/crimes_of_pkk_terrorist_organization/ kck have same or similar tactics with isis . 
  uses suicide bombers aganist civilians , children soldiers ... 
  so please stop denying facts and doing black propaganda here . 
  edit : typo, 
   according to turkey these were specially trained commandos in the kayseri 1st commando brigade , likely that they were fighting in the south east were many crimes were committed you are free to prove that . 
   what 's left of hdp after all the arrests have condemned the attack , let 's keep them in our thoughts as well as grey wolves mobs are attacking and setting fire to their building in kayseri https://twitter.com/selingirit/status/810087650208206848 https://twitter.com/cahida261/status/810082409551196160 i ca n't blame them after all these suicide attacks . 
  at least they did n't kill or torture aynone unlike tak/pkk terrorists . 
  [ previous attacks of tak/pkk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kurdistan_freedom_falcons#attacks ) edit : pkk uses same tactics as isis .

  very suprising ... only turks does this . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turks_in_austria turks in austria are people of turkish ethnicity living in austria who form the second largest ethnic group in the country after austrians . 
  185,592 ( turkish citizens ) 350,000-500 ,000 ( including descendants ) +3 million refugees ** but ofc akp is all talk , just ignore . 
  just telling facts , not suppoting, 
  stop playing erdogan card . 
  ypg has nothing to do with erdogan . 
  ypg has no difference with isis in terms of terrorism . 
   to me it 's a good thing the kurdish resistance in bakur is still around and did n't capitulate to erdogan and his akp party . 
  if it were n't for them 40 thousand more of my fellow yazidis , in a matter of days , would have been killed or enslaved by daesh let me show you what a assyrian think about kurds :  to put my two cents in , kurds say they have given us freedom and are helping us in every way possible . 
  but we all know that is n't true . 
  it 's alright until we get stronger than them and they do n't want that . 
  they 're not helping us out of goodwill , rather they 're helping us to help themselves achieve their goals . 
  the funniest comments i see is when kurds get angry about assyrians being suspicious of them . 
  we have every right to be suspicious , as we should be with arabs or whoever we work with . 
  politics has no trust and just by taking a look back at our history we have seen the amount of times kurds have betrayed us . 
  calling our diaspora `` racist '' for being cautious ( although we do take it too far at times ) is stupid because as soon as they are criticised , they get offended and attempt to justify the times they have betrayed us . 
  some even going to the point of saying that `` all must be put behind us '' which i both agree and disagree upon . 
  the lives they took of our relatives will not be forgotten but we should certainly work together , only if both sides can work well together . 
  nb : sounds like the biggest vent at kurds but it is rather a criticism and my own view . 
  would write it about any group of people i need to criticise , this does n't just apply to kurds . 
  source : https://npreddit.com/r/assyria/comments/4q8e1b/assyrian_leader_assassinated_by_kurdish_ypg/d4sh04s/  by daesh whose majority of foreign fighters passed through turkish/nato borders under erdogan . 
  even the us can not control the border 100 % , how do you expect it from turkey ? 
  if this is the case why did other countries allow the isis members to go to turkey ?
