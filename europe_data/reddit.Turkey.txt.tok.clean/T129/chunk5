  meanwhile , the number of unauthorized immigrants from nations other than mexico grew by 325,000 since 2009 , to an estimated 5.3 million in 2014 . 
  populations went up most for unauthorized immigrants from asia and central america , but the number also ticked up for those from sub-saharan africa . 
  increases in the number of unauthorized immigrants from other countries mostly offset the decline in the number from mexico .

  pkk was n't throwing flowers everwhere while taf there . 
  do you remember peace process between turkey and pkk ? 
  pkk promised turkey for leaving from south-east of turkey to north iraq . 
  but pkk did n't keep it 's promise . 
  instead , pkk carried conflicts to cities . 
  deployed weapons , ammunitions during peace process into cities . 
  even captured civilian houses by force , killed jash ( traitor ) kurds , placed ieds under bridges , bulding columns , doors . 
  dug tunnels , burnt buldings . 
  pkk is main reason for destruction of these cities .

  they do n't need turkish armed forces . 
  cutting hand of pro-pkk party in turkey = europe says its persecution of kurds . 
  cutting hand of pro-akp party in netherlands = not persecution , lets cut it . 
  also unlike pkk , akp is not a terrorist organization . 
  democracy please, 
  arrest of terrorist supporters = / = persecuting kurds . 
  support of terrorist supporters = persecuting turkish citizens, 
  which `` terrorist groups ? 
  isis ? 
  2 suicide bombers were ex-pkk member : https://twitter.com/sercannews/status/807974882139054080 [ hdp refused to sign document condemning the attack ] ( https://twitter.com/bilgeoztas/status/807951930517549056 ) https://twitter.com/fgeerdink/status/807847914995380224 https://np.reddit.com/r/terrorist_pkk/comments/4xuf4o/pkkypgkcktakpyd/ the tak who committed suicide bombings in ankara are considered as heroes and glorified by the pyd/ypg in syria . 
  this picture was taken in the syrian town of al-malikiyah . 
  on the flyer we got [ photos of the bombing perpetrators ] ( http://imgur.com/a/t3kyq ) and the pkk founder abdullah \u00f6calan . 
  at the suicide bombing on the busiest bus station of ankara , 30 people came to life and 60 people were seriously injured . 
   i 'm pretty sure it was fake . 
  too many contradictions . 
  contradictions like what ? 
  soldiers, 
  lol . 
  tak claimed responsibility for the attack . 
  coup is not fake but erdogan knew that and turn it to opportunity . 
  good news . 
  supporting terrorism is crime . 
   a police chief accused of grave human rights abuses in the south east and boasting online about kurdish civilians being burned alive in basements was also killed 1 . 
  your sources are pro-pkk . 
  this story is not true and not proven . 
  they were pkk terrrorists , not civilians . 
  turkey wanted them to go outside even sent ambulances but terrorists denied to go outside , resisted . 
  turkish army did n't kill any civilians in south-east of turkey . 
  it 's all black propaganda . 
  calling pkk terrorists as civilians tactic of pkk supporters . 
   davuto\u011flu also said that in sur alone , 11 tons of ammunition piled up by the pkk during the three-year-long peace process ( now collapsed ) with the government have so far been seized . 
  cizre has been a focus of attention recently with its `` ambulance crisis , '' and still no solution has been found to bring medical assistance to people reportedly wounded and stuck in a basement in a pkk-held neighborhood of the town . 
  government officials say it could be a `` trap '' set by the pkk , while the pkk refuses to let the ambulances come closer under military protection and has not transported the wounded to a point which ambulances can reach safely . 
  *  this is because the circle has become tighter and the senior terrorists in this base , where terrorist acts are masterminded to claim hundreds of lives , have been pushed against the wall . 
  they claim that there are not terrorists , but injured civilians in this pkk base and that the hdp 's politicians want ambulances to be deployed around the building to deal with the casualties . 
  however , pkk terrorists in the building are not as moderate as their legal representatives . 
  recently , one of the terrorists who was backed into a corner in the building got through to a television program by phone , saying that their insurgency would continue and they would not `` give in to the ambulances . '', 
  i dont know . 
  he says `` foreign powers '' xd, 
  also `` interest rate lobby '', 
  `` foreign powers wants to destroy us '' `` they want to sabotage our economy '', 
   when 20 % of the population of turkey are kurds you have to be able to find a compromise .

   civilian casualties : 6,741 killed and 14,257 wounded ( turkish claim ) 18,000 -- 20,000 kurds executed and 2,400 -- 4,000 + villages destroyed by the turkish government ( independent human rights reports and other estimates ) 17,000 missing 3,000,000 + displaced http://www.yenisafak.com/en/news/nearly-7000-civilians-killed-by-pkk-in-31-years-2237092 [ hani massacre ] ( http://www.pkkeylemleri.com/hani-massacre/ ) [ 2014 murder : 76 years old mustafa bingol was murdered by pkk ] ( http://www.pkkeylemleri.com/2014-murder-76-years-old-mustafa-bingol-was-murdered-by-pkk/ ) [ p\u0131narc\u0131k massacre ] ( http://www.pkkeylemleri.com/pinarcik-massacre/ ) [ savur massacre ] ( http://www.pkkeylemleri.com/savur-massacre/ ) [ tunceli tavuk village massacre ] ( http://www.pkkeylemleri.com/tunceli-tavuk-village-massacre/ ) [ yolalan massacre ] ( http://www.pkkeylemleri.com/yolalan-massacre-october-25th-1993/ ) [ acikyol massacre ] ( http://www.pkkeylemleri.com/acikyol-massacre-6-children-were-among-those-who-were-killed/ ) edit : pkk burns school : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8zdhwbjbjg  what turkey is doing and has done is not a proportionate response , many turks genuinely see kurds as subhuman no . 
  we do n't . 
  if you were right there would be full-scale civil war . 
  i have kurdish friends . 
  yet we do n't care about pkk-turkey conflicts . 
   but when you do this to a population you know that you 'll get this kind of response . 
  what do you mean ? 
  long time ago bulgarian communist regime oppressed turks even banned turkish language , culture ... but turks did n't attack bulgarian armed forces or bulgarian civilians . 
  even hundred tousands of turkish civilians forced to leave bulgaria yet we did n't attack them again . 
   but many kurds do have a point , what turkey does to kurds okay . 
  you are right . 
  turkey was wrong for banning kurdish language . 
  turkey banned kurdish language because we worried about pkk terrorism . 
  but it was long time ago . 
  can pkk stop now ? 
   according to an official report of the fourth general ispectorate , 13,160 civilians were killed by the turkish army and 11,818 people were taken into exile , depopulating the province . 
  [ 43 ] according to the dersimi , many tribesmen were shot dead after surrendering , and women and children were locked into haysheds which were then set on fire . 
  [ 44 ] according to mcdowall , 40,000 people were killed . 
  [ 1 ] according to kurdish diaspora sources , over 70,000 people were killed . 
  [ 45 ] wikipedia is not a good source , mcdowall worser . 
   fourth general ispectorate so turkish government accepts it 's crime ?

   those are your words , definitely not mine . 
  however mhp does represent the general mind among the turkish population . 
  did you ever been in turkey ? 
   or are you saying that there had been nation wide demonstration agains turkish military 's killing of kurdish civilians ? 
  why would there should be a demonstration for something not happened ? 
  pkk killed civilians beucase they were jash kurds . 
  maybe some people killed by mistakes .
