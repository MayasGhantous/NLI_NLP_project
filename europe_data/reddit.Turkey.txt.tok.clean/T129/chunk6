  [ pkk doing that job already . 
  five civilians killed in pkk suicide attack in southeastern turkey ] ( http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/one-policeman-five-civilians-killed-in-pkk-attack-in-southeastern-turkey-.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=93837&amp;newscatid=509 ) nsfw : [ armed d\u0130ha journalist ] ( http://imgur.com/a/f2r5d ) [ kurdish civilians acting like dead ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zktdfptcyke ) [ she was civilian according to hdp . 
  but facts revelead after video shared by turkish government . 
  she was pkk member who tried to kill police ] ( https://onedio.com/haber/diyarbakir-valiligi-diyarbakir-sur-da-polise-ates-acan-kadin-terorist-olduruldu--634812 ) - watch left bottom corner in video . 
  pkk member also tries to kill civilians there . 
   and then carpet bomb whoever is trapped inside . 
  turkey did n't use warplanes and artilleries that 's why we lost 800 armed turkish forces while fighting against terrorism . 
   you are whitewashing genocidal criminals . 
  your country is a country that allows politicians with genocidal slogans to rule . 
  do n't come telling me your country has any morality . 
  it is based on racism & supremacy . 
  you should stop blaming someone without proving it . 
  edit : typo, 
   since you kill our people , behead them , torture them & call for destruction of kurdish cities , we are allowed to fight against you . 
  like isis , al qaeda or other islamic groups . 
  i ca n't see difference between pkk and isis in terms of terrorism . 
   i 'm a kurd and no fan of a pkk . 
  but to say they are there for no reason is ridiculous . 
  pkk is a monster that turkey creates themselves by the systematic oppression of kurdish people . 
  you support ypg which is pkk 's syrian wing . 
  edit . 
  also according to you pkk and ypg are independent from each other . 
  this is how pkk supporters whitewashing crimes of pkk . 
  `` they did too , so we should do it too ''  suicide bombing is a common tactic in military world . 
  okay , show me an example . 
  it has actually more to do with supporting pkk and massacring civilians . 
  you are manipulating it . 
  that kurdish city evecuated by pkk and turkish government . 
  pkk carried conflicts to cities deployed weapons etc. 
  yet you expect turkish governemnt let pkk stay there and massacre people : http://edition.cnn.com/2016/03/15/middleeast/ankara-bombing-female-suicide-bomber/, 
   no , she refers to turkish state killing kurdish civilians ( which dont matter to the people here since kurds arent part of nato , the supermoral entity that deserves to live while the rest deserve to die ) yeah . 
  she is lying like always . 
  she should prove if she is going to blame someone . 
   the turkish government 's onslaught on kurdish towns and neighbourhoods , which includes round-the-clock curfews and cuts to services , is putting the lives of up to 200,000 people at risk and amounts to collective punishment , amnesty international said today . 
  research carried out by amnesty international in areas under curfew and reports from residents in areas that are currently inaccessible to external observers , reveal the extreme hardships they are currently facing as a result of harsh and arbitrary measures . 
  proves nothing . 
  there would n't be conflict if pkk did n't carry conflict to cities . 
  pkk did n't keep it 's promise and deployed weapons , ammunitions ... to cities . 
  forced kurdish people to leave it 's homes . 
   most of them killed by turkish security forces . 
  prove it . 
   but i guess that does n't matter in your heart , because kurds are second class people right ? 
  because you do n't care about facts . 
  if you would care abotu facts you would blame pkk for carrying conflict to cities . 
   how many turkish people condemn the racism , destruction & massacre of kurdish people ? 
  a lot unlike pkk supporters . 
  massacre of what ? 
  can you prove your claim ? 
  also pkk is responsible for destruction . 
  pkk caried conflicts to cities , deployed weapons , ammunitions there . 
   instead of condemning it , turks actually celebrate it . 
  turkish politician bahceli even called for killing everybody inside nusaybin a while ago : he said `` level nusaybin to the ground '' , not `` killing everybody inside nusaybin '' you know that nusaybin evecuated by turkish government and pkk , right ? 
  except a little civilian population , there were only armed fighters . 
  so she accepts pkk and tak are not different first time . 
  lol, 
  [ previous attacks of pkk/tak terrorist organization ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kurdistan_freedom_falcons#attacks ) 2 pkk/tak suicide bomber responsible for the bombing .

  [ hdp refused to sign document condemning the attack ] ( https://twitter.com/bilgeoztas/status/807951930517549056 ), 
  yes , they target civilians too . 
  how ? 
  how they are independent if they have same ideology and umbrella organization ? 
   the kurdistan communities union or kck ( kurdish : koma civak\u00ean kurdistan ) is a kurdish political organization committed to implementing abdullah \u00d6calan 's ideology of democratic confederalism . 
  the kck also serves as an umbrella group for all the apoist political parties of greater kurdistan , including the ** pkk ** , ** pyd/ypg ** , pjak , and p\u00c7dk . 
   not whether turkey should retreat all its imperialist activities in syria and iraq yeah . 
  good idea . 
  so isis and ypg can keep attacking turkey again . 
  so you can connect the cantons . 
  so you can kill more people and create ur terror state . 
  wonderful . 
  you are genius . 
   are you saying turkish citizens have more rights to live than syriand and iraqis ? 
  what ?!, 
  i did n't say that . 
  i meant turkey did n't attack isis because of isis threats . 
  isis would retaliate . 
  i am not even talking about inner problems like feto . 
  turkey attacked isis in syria after feto gone . 
   who is talking about only isis when talking about terrorism ? 
  what about ahrar sham ? 
  all these turkish backed groups do most of the killing . 
  turkey did n't support al qaeda linked terrorists . 
  why would we ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_istanbul_bombings  wow , that makes a difference / s yes , it does . 
  you lied . 
   i 'm not supporting the pkk . 
  you are supporting turkish backed terrorists in syria and iraq . 
  your country engages in imperialism and these attacks are symptoms . 
  if you do n't sympathize with more than 100 00 people killed in syria and iraq , who should the world sympathize with 20 turks killed ? 
  what do you want while isis and pkk attacking turkey and getting tons of refugees from syria ? 
   if you would know me , you would know i barely talk about pkk as it 's not allowed to talk about turkey-pkk @ it 's allowed to talk about pkk but not allowed to talk about pkk-turkey conflicts . 
  also it 's not important since ypg = pkk already . 
   is n't it strange that isis has existed for 3 years alongside turkey before turkey started to brand it as terrorists ? 
   more than 100 000 people have been killed in syria for the last years , and your government has a big hand in it . 
  stop the wars in other countries . 
  how ? 
  assad is dictator and killed a lot of civilians . 
  assad , pkk and isis started this . 
  that 's why we are in syria .
