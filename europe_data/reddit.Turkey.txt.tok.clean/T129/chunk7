  we do n't support al qaeda linked groups . 
  also what about nato ? 
  why you do n't care about nato countries involved conflicts in syria ? 
  who is the biggest weapon suppliers of fsa except turkey ? 
  let 's talk about that . 
  oh , true you do n't care because ur ypg terrorists are supported by those countries . 
   people of iraq and syria have been dying for the past years constantly due to erdogan 's government in thousands . 
  i think it 's because citizens of turkey are priority . 
  but turkey helped syrians against isis . 
  turkey did n't want to get attention of isis .

  because i know you on r/syriancivilwar and r/turkey . 
   how can you hope for safety in your country , when your government is fighting a war in the country next to you ? 
  turkey said the operation was an act of self-defence , in response to isis shelling of turkish border towns and suicide bombings and attacks targeting turkish nationals and also that `` our border must be completely cleansed of daesh ( isis ) '' . 
  [ ankara bombing : female suicide bomber spent time in syria ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2016/03/15/middleeast/ankara-bombing-female-suicide-bomber/ ) turkey wo n't stay silent while both isis and pkk 's ypg attacking turkey .

  what about legal implications ? 
  legal implications would include cash compensation payments to the victims of genocide , in case of loss of property , returning lands and other types of assets to their actual owners . 
  but kurds got free-pass again . 
  they wo n't pay for anything ... 
  these apologizes have no legal results since it 's all show `` look how kurds are good '' . 
  it 's all random apologizes . 
  sure they will apologize since they wo n't lose anything anyway .
