it turned into just another corruption story for turkey of course . 
  first the claimant architect fishily withdraws from the case , leaving the ball up to the court alone . 
  then the firm owning the project opens a counter case against the municipality , lengthening the case . 
  finally , an addition to the zoning laws saves these and many other structures going through similar cases ; turning them all legal overnight . 
  czech beer specifically . 
  you called ? 
  always make sure that your ae is less than 30 before accepting a peace deal . 
  *** ` fact ' *** : as turkey is right next to isis she does n't need to use airstrikes to hit their targets . 
  artillery is mainly used in attacks against them and your ` airstrike numbers ' do not include these . 
  airstrikes against the pkk are much more because they hide within mountains and are * ` in defilade ' * against artillery fire . 
  the association of unkempt beards with commie groups is gone if you ask me but i 'm still reluctant in wearing green parkas . 
   eu must bear some of the responsibility for turkey 's current situation yeah nah , they would only be a pain in the butt anyways . 
  * ` unutmabeni ' * , which literally means ` forget-me-not ' is widely used but it 's actual turkish name is * ` mine * ' . 
  invoking article nr 5 would imply the acceptance of isis as a legit state against nato members . 
  which smell horrible once heated up and permeates through the whole interior of the place . 
  minced meat in my d\u00f6ner , what blasphemy is this ? 
  sshhh , have a kebab brother . 
  oh that 's a movement we greatly support over here in turkey ; better than those radicals voting for some ` moderate ' islamist party to never vote . 
  bonus points if you 're somehow jewish . 
  that free explorer man . 
  for local one 's i 'd go with [ bol\u00e7i ] ( http://bolcikolata.com/image/data/afisler/slide2.jpg ) but not necessarily for the chocolate . 
  we find him to be [ quite cute ] ( https://static2.bobiler.org/monte/2015/1/20/davutoglu-montelemece--164587.jpg ) too . 
  he 's talking about the navy . 
  i 'm definitely no expert but the navy always got the short stick when it comes to upgrades for the army . 
  there was the m\u0130lgem project that is on hold now after 2 ships constructed and then there is tcg anadolu to be produced and that 's it as far as i know . 
  that 's probably the ' \\  turkey \\  europe pick one . ', 
  brigade sick of seeing quarter of the top posts being about turkey . 
  [ they have been released . 
  ] ( http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/arrested-turkish-journalists-released-after-92-days-in-prison.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=95723&amp;newscatid=339 )  `` sorry for keeping you waiting for this long , '' d\u00fcndar told reporters waiting outside the prison . 
  `` you know , the 26th is president [ recep tayyip ] erdo\u011fan 's birthday . 
  we are happy to celebrate his birthday with this release decision . ''  d\u00fcndar recalled that he was arrested on his wedding anniversary . 
  `` we wanted to give him [ president erdo\u011fan ] a birthday present , '' he added . 
  and that is how you turn in to turkey . 
  lithuania . 
  i only know that they had a nice big kingdom back in history and that they drink borscht thanks to a saran cartoon that i ca n't remember the name of . 
  the government is so busy with it 's foreign relationships these days that it forgot about it 's little ` liberalisation ' projects so that 's something . 
  oh the genius `` we kill the batman '' plan . 
  and ? 
  how will you make turkey accept such a plan ? 
  that `` kod ad\u0131 : koz '' was a propaganda movie about the [ 17 - 25 december operations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_corruption_scandal_in_turkey ) on the government and the [ june movement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_june_movement ) - it performed so bad in box office that they showed it for free . 
  probably because of the high ivf ( t\u00fcp bebek ) rates ; i think they have a higher chance of being born early and cesarean is the preferred method in such cases . 
  oh it 's the spanish inquisition all over again . 
  daily dose . 
  i remember the open letter he wrote a couple of months ago ; published through tweetlonger with all caps and filled with fourth-grade level grammar mistakes . 
  did you know that one-third of the commentators here are left-handed ? 
  now you do !, 
  \\* cough * we 're literally trying to bring down the syrian ` government ' right now though ? 
  \\* cough *, 
  private religional education organisations are prohibited so that kuran kursu count should be right . 
  believe it !, 
  lukewarm war ? 
  did n't putin have a black belt or something in judo ? 
  not everyone 's cup of beer but try pera pilsener if you have n't , it 's light and quite cheap with various flavors . 
  aegean airspace is literally a controversial jungle of invisible borders due to it 's numerous islands ; violations are pretty much tolerated by both sides to a degree these days . 
  upvoted for f-type prison . 
  bah\u00e7eli is honestly a near-senile man with a , well , ' [ eccentric ] ( http://onedio.com/haber/devlet-bahceli-top-10-150782 ) ' way of communication . 
  i would n't take his archaic jokes serious even with his status as the highest spokesperson for a party . 
  still , loving his abstract take on stuff though . 
  day by day i believe more and more that we are a living , breathing imageboard . 
  reason mainly being getting drowned for trying to replace the folk in question . 
  do n't forget the still ongoing `` who invented meat between bread ? '', 
  they just bring up controversial stuff like this when they 're tinkering with other stuff behind doors . 
  oh i just have to translate this :  turkish people are weird  they ca n't get over each remark  call them gay and they 'll get angry but  fuck them and they wo n't care by [ neyzen tevfik ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neyzen_tevfik ) , a very ` turkish ' individual . 
  our lahmacun is probably better anyways . 
   erdogan wants georgia to close its casinos because too many turkish citizens are crossing the border to gamble  `` or we can even ban entrance for locals and casinos be only open to tourists , '' ivanishvili added oh no , that 'd be too funny . 
  ] ( http://www.2kafadar.com/cemisgezek/uploads/eti-negro.jpg ), 
  ` fa\u00e7a ' means scar in turkish ( used especially for self-mutilated ones ) if that 'll make you happy somehow . 
  you seeing [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fopyrhhlt3m ) a lot ? 
  well i honestly have to remind myself that gebze is not in \u0130stanbul but kocaeli . 
  hey they also say american indians are turkish too . 
  it was so bad that they showed it for free as propaganda material . 
  no one watched it even with that though . 
  oh i saw one for the first time yesterday , it inflated like the michelin guy when the woman went in the water , was funny . 
  `` deny the obvious , uphold the inane '', 
  from the recent [ washington post article ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/hes-frail-77-and-lives-in-pennsylvania-turkey-says-hes-a-coup-mastermind/2016/08/03/6b1b2226-526f-11e6-bbf5-957ad17b4385_story.html ) ;  a justice department team is sifting through what u.s. officials say are some 85 boxes of evidence that turkey says describes the infiltration of gulenists into every part of turkish society , including the judiciary , the police and the military faction that launched the coup attempt , and proves gulen 's direct role as mastermind of the plot . 
  guess we wait for now . 
  she talked about it a bit on [ twitter ] ( https://twitter.com/ozlemaktay ) it seems ; because of another [ report ] ( http://www.ahaber.com.tr/teknoloji/2016/07/25/darbecilerin-iletisim-agi-clash-of-kings ) ( again , by ahaber ) saying that the organization used qq.com and clash of kings ' private rooms for communication - which the article provides no evidence or anything mind you - they thought that they might have a similar use . 
  she says that they found many similar notes tucked between books thrown out by the organization members before fleeing so they decided to include it in the report . 
  he can just collect them off the ground later . 
  just a reporter girl trying to dramatise her report . 
  erdo\u011fan will never reject death penalty as a part of his voterbase - though small , actually want it back . 
  he 'll just keep repeating ` yes , we 're thinking about it ' until the demands die off . 
  i do n't even ... 
  yeah , goes great with some greek baklava . 
  rip [ gap ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/southeastern_anatolia_project ) . 
  you see it go down on the way for a moment and feel bad about it the whole day . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oksoko officially it seems to be the [ redwing ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/redwing ) though . 
  that was because of the hot though . 
  they were thanking the chp voters while the ballots were being counted , who voted for them to bring them in to the parliament then they took a straight 180 turn , was rather bizarre . 
  it 's a mixed bunch . 
  interesting trivia : the turkish anthem does not ever mention ` turk ' or ` turkey ' in it 's 10 stanzas . 
  what 's your favourite verse in your anthem yuros ? 
  i 'm talking about the otto empire in an erdo-fan 's head , taking what / u/alpha023 said from reverse . 
   ottomans , the empire of empires , once as powerful as france , england , romans and abbasids together wow , it really does sound like that . 
  we are the most special nutjobs in the region that you have to care about so we just represent ourselves every meeting . 
  ldp is pretty much a world-standard libertarian party - quite the rare and brave bunch to advocate such ideas in turkey , really . 
  the moment chp guys hear their privatizaton policies , the deal would be off . 
  it 's voterbase knows they 'll fall under the % 10 election threshold so they just vote for hdp or chp to at least reduce akp and mhp 's percentages .
