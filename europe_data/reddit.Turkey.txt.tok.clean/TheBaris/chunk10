  nah summertime usually, 
  well u seem to be right as of now with regard to turkey, 
  you cant stop it , you cant reason with islam . 
  you have to use force against it whenever you can and hope for the best . 
  first one, 
  in turkey we celebrate new year 's instead of christmas and we even have santa close etc. 
  who shows up in new year 's and gifts etc. 
  i thought akp was pro-eu when they came to power . 
  try browsec, 
  lmao i pretty much have zero respect for turkey and always expect the worst but still at least two times each year even i am flabbergasted . 
  wtf ? 
  i mean okay let 's say everything is cool but why does that kid on the right have a jihadi-beard drawing on his face :d, 
  lmao you just know you 'll have at least one of those every time at the very bottom of the thread, 
  top kek, 
  it 's a great city to visit , but a terrible city to live in . 
  well if we have mad , we wont be finishing 2016 . 
  hows the media reporting it in russia ? 
  russia 's ankara ambassador andrey karlov was attacked in ankara . 
  the attack took place when the ambassador participated in an art exhibition . 
  apart from the ambassador , it is said that there are more wounded . 
  the attack took place during the opening of a painting exhibition in ankara 's center for contemporary arts . 
  following the opening , ambassador andrey karlov , who came to the floor to speak , was attacked at this time . 
  according to the information given by the ankara representative of the h\u00fcrriyet newspaper on the basis of municipal authorities , it is claimed that the attacker entered the show by showing police id . 
  it is stated that the attacker first fired into the air while the russian ambassador spoke and then targeted the ambassador . 
  it is stated that the attacker is currently on display with the wounded ambassador . 
  details are coming ... 
  i think it 's more because in english it 's called istanbul, 
  http://www.politico.eu/article/5-things-about-the-man-turkey-says-is-behind-the-coup-fetullah-gulen-islamic-cleric/  back in the days before erdo\u011fan became president , the two were friends . 
  erdo\u011fan shared in g\u00fclen 's efforts to make the staunchly secular turkey more muslim . 
   g\u00fclen has been working on that effort since the 1960s , bringing islamic values to the turks under the radar of the authorities , through education and charitable work , rather than politics , similar to islamic movements working under military-supported regimes in arab countries that are republics in name only . 
  -  despite the pressure , g\u00fclen still enjoys the support of about 10 percent of turkey 's population , according to opinion polls conducted before the coup . 
  former u.s. ambassador to turkey james jefferey has referred to g\u00fclen as turkey 's second-most powerful man . 
  just do some research . 
  currently erdogan is a bigger problem yes but gulen 's influence is what allowed him to become this powerful in the first place . 
  actually your correct in a way lol . 
  without him , erdogan wouldnt be in power right now . 
  sorry u got triggered man :( ill see what i can do and next time they wont include turkey, 
  why dont you guys ask about our opinion of erdogan ? 
  i 'd like to see everyone agree on something for once . 
   ** jep ** , it 's safe to say he has won . 
  did someone say jeb !, 
  won ? 
  try harder . 
  it 's normally five years but two years if you have finished uni here ( at least that what i found with google , should be correct tho ) . 
  i 'll do uni + master here and after that i believe if i live two more years ill be able to get a citizenship which will be perfect . 
  as a turk whos been in europe for a few months for uni : yep . 
  in turkey drowning in punishable by death . 
  casually join one of the syrian hordes passing through and end up in germany/sweden with welfare ? 
  which one is more visually pleasing , i ca n't decide : /, 
  is it a place ? 
  is it like a branch of buddhism ?

  as a non-colourblind person , this is honestly the best colour scheme i 've seen in a while .

  hahahahah take that russia and greece :d !!, 
   yuo granada help perfavore s ` il vous plait pl0x man , the hot has melted ur brain , and the result is beautiful . 
  well france surely had a stronger army than us and you know what their fate was :p the thing is ismet 's government really managed to look neutral to both the nazis and the soviets while promising the allies to declare war on the nazis asap ( which they did , like a month before the end of the war . 
  wow , normally these only aim to get women to be engineers etc , it 's good that this one also does it with dangerous jobs . 
   trump sounding like random sentences generator lmao, 
  exactly , seems puny europeans are taking leadership lessons from our glorious leader .

  who cares what some loser drunk englishmen thinks ? 
  if your actually an accomplished person no sane person would be aginst you staying in their country . 
  nice we passed russia !, 
  thanks erdogan :d, 
   you know , what 's even more frustrating ? 
  in my city in germany 75 % of the turkish referendum votes were `` yes '' . 
  i just ca n't fucking believe it . 
  shit sorry man it seems a quarter of ur turks are terrorists : / ur lucky though here it 's like 49 % smh, 
  yep , tho secular would fit them better than leftist probably, 
   hdp you mean chp ? 
  lol that 's quite fucked up, 
  the thing is akp always `` wins '' ankara and istanbul, 
  lol there was no point when it was increasing less than .1 each time, 
  the three biggest cities said no, 
  yup, 
  guys i cant access eksisozluk.com , can you ? 
  42.2 now,

  the coup-attempt , akp , gezi protests , terrorism , gulen , economy getting fucked , and finally the referendum . 
  this is an excellent article to understand the current political climate methinks . 
  of course you do : `` balle '', 
  anywhere that is more than 20 km away from sea . 
  in french there are a lot of silent letters but once you get used to them u can usually guess the pronunciation pretty accurately . 
  on the other hand , in english you have this : w ** eight ** vs h ** eight **, 
  i meant specific examples, 
  how did turkish influence greek ? 
  isnt sunjonktif pass\u00e9 also not used in daily conversation, 
  of course , it has nothing to do with turkey :p, 
  do u mean plural you ? 
  like vous is french ? 
  one factor is even the most religious turks are pretty mild on a religious scale compared to most arabs , pakis etc
