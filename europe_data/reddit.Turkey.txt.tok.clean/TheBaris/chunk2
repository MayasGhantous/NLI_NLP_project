  that sounds good in theory . 
  what are some other genocides that caused the perpetrators to pay reparations ? 
  i just googled `` reparations for genocide '' and the first thing that came up was armenian genocide , even though no one payed any reparations for that . 
  i also saw that rwandan genocide still waiting reparations . 
  you seem to know more about this whole thing than me so can i ask you is there any state/country who payed reparations except germany , who was being occupied by two superpowers and had n choice in the matter ? 
  explain how it 's logical to me . 
  lol this is so weird and cute at the same time, 
  our foreign policy is `` turks have no friends but turks ; except the japanese since they make animes '', 
  what i meant is , the people who lived there before you also loved that place but you killed them or displaced them . 
  maybe they are totally extinct now . 
  ( also just realized i didnt put the video ... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eviyrrjtty ) here watch this and tell me what do you think, 
  sure hope so . 
  although it ca n't include any reparations . 
  hey guys look our foreign policy isnt a * complete * failure !!, 
  it was a prank bro !, 
  a social experiment !, 
  are armenians te first people to live around mount ararat ? 
  i always laugh how people say a place is their `` homeland '' or it is `` rightfully theirs '' . 
  just watch this video , it 's about israel/palastine but it makes the point . 
  in reality , turks ans kurds armenians who lived there , and armenians killed those who lived there before them etc.etc ... 
  it 's not a problem to call it a genocide to me , since even holodomor is called one . 
  but it wasnt `` systematic '' as you say for the reasons i put above . 
  a big example of just how bad ottomans were during the time is battle of sar\u0131kam\u0131\u015f , almost all the ottoman soldiers died as a result of lack of winter clothing . 
  people mostly acted on their and killed others the same reasons as everyone else during the time . 
  i dont know how that helps but the issue is just so politicized . 
  also i think its naive to expect the current government to `` admit '' it , there were more `` european '' oriented governments before and just a little pressure could probably seal the deal . 
  also what do you mean by europeans pushing atat\u00fcrk ? 
  he already hated enver pasha with a passion . 
  yes , it was an ethnic cleansing . 
  i 100 % agree with that . 
  but do you really think the ottoman empire had any semblance of control in the east ? 
  it was anarchy . 
  atat\u00fcrk was able to rebel aganist the same government in central parts of the country ( even closer to istanbul ) in early 1920s when ottoman empire had western powers in its side . 
  meaning , the european powers + ottoman empire couldnt exert any influence during peace time , what makes you think they could during the most tragic war of all time by that point ( its called world war for a reason ) ? 
  i 'm not convinced mind you , you can change my mind . 
  my history teacher told our class he visited those parts of turkey and the kurdish tribes were telling him that they did `` cut armenians over here and there '' . 
  how is this any different that other atrocities during the first world war ? 
  ( like the ones greeks and turks both committed aganist each other ) also some historical info : * it was ottomans , not turkey . 
  * the three pashas were sentenced to death by atat\u00fcrk 's government . 
  * all three of them were killed in the next 4-5 years, 
  what difference does it make if they say mass extermination and not genocide ? 
  everyone , including turkey , says hundreds of thousands of armenians were killed . 
  it 's not the only tragic event in ww1 , just one of many . 
  lol you 're much more fun when you shitpost instead of linking random articles about syrian civil war . 
  thanks man maybe they 'll listen to you . 
  lol it 's no secret he 's not a `` great guy '', 
  i just love killin ' !, 
  churchill did all he could to make stalin guarantee your indepence but fdr hindered his efforts . 
  and tbh stalin could have rolled through the entire continental europe so there wasnt much anyone could do . 
  ** you mean to tell me there are people who dont have at least one couple of loving gay turtles in their homes i mean come on its the current year stop with the hate man !!!, 
  shit so there were more turks than greeks in salonika in 1900 . 
  what 's even more surprising is there were more jews than those two combined in 1900 . 
  but this is most likely like izmir , in which the city center greeks had a majority whereas in its hinterland turks were in majority . 
  we last occupied your lands in 1910 ( salonika and other few cities ) , but poles only got rid of their russian influenced govenment in 1990 . 
  also say what you want about ottoman 's but compared to ussr they were vegan-hippies . 
  i do n't think you understand at all . 
  i saw that one . 
  what im looking for is the one where he says `` its 2015 come on !!! '', 
  he managed to annoy me while making fun of erdo\u011fan . 
  the horse part was good tho more people should see it . 
  i swear i remember a video in which he says `` it 's 2015 !, 
  but i cant find it . 
  maybe he deleted it lol . 
  if someone finds it pls lem me know, 
  wait , what ? 
  why would any greek celebrate it, 
  the weird thing is pkk was the one to restart the conflict by killing two police officers . 
  i agree with thrwwtrk that there 's no way the conflict started at just the right time for erdo\u011fan as a coincidence . 
  pkk is either really stupid to attack at the worst moment for kurds ( hdp 's votes decreased because of the renewed conflict ) or it is beneficial for them to keep the conflict kindled ( radicalizing the kurds so they get support ) like it is for erdo\u011fan . 
  you guys dont know anything about our glorious president . 
  [ here have this dank video which is actually funny :d . ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpopkrbhbra ), 
  kurds never saw themselves as turks . 
  its just that a hundred years ago both saw themselves as `` ottoman '' . 
  since kurds are usually more religious than turks it makes sense that they would prefer muslim turks to europeans . 
  and persians are the same color as europeans :d, 
  [ you think our president is not glorious ?

  this is said by our glorious president btw . 
  he got sent in jail for 1-2 years after he said it tho ( back in 2000 i think ) . 
  lol, 
  we now have a meme leader who appears in videos like this . 
  life goal achieved . 
  man i havent eaten one in years i really should get one . 
  it really does taste nice lol, 
  you sure ? 
  [ i think this traditional turkish delicacy is well suited for this video ] ( http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130824204929/lost-episode-creepypasta/images/8/84/fb,6684,72,eti-topkek-meyveli-40gr-24-lu-koli-biskuvi-kraker-urunleri-eti.jpg ), 
  why, 
  is n't pkk and ypg the same organization , just different branches , whereas peshmerga is different and allies with the other two only out of necessity ? 
  you guys should just anschluss them and be done with it . 
  i 'd honestly prefer `` 0 refugees '' idiots to `` no borders no states '' idiots . 
  obviously skilled immigration is always beneficial to a country and if the country needs it unskilled immigration should be allowed to some extent but the way you guys are bringing so many people just does n't make any sense to me . 
  and i 'm not saying this just for the last year either , sweden has had a policy of bringing something like 100k immigrants from poorer countries for the last few decades . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong . 
  this just doesnt make sense to me . 
  and if the problem is low birth rates , encourage your own population to have children by easing taxes on young couples etc. 
  what do you think ? 
  this is really fucked up . 
  he has this condition called `` permanent amused face '' . 
  even when he announces tragic events and such he cant help but smile lol .
