  well , after 1945 stalin used the armenians claims to form an ultimatum wanting someof our eastern provinces for his armenian puppet state . 
  turkey wasnt a member of nato yet so she fervently denied the genocide . 
  there is a big national honor thing for us as well for some reason but [ armenian diaspora wanting some of our cities is another big impediment ] ( http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/files/live/sites/almonitor/files/images/almpics/2015/04/rtxyxzd.jpg?t=thumbnail_570 ) . 
  lol do you think he actually cares about any of this ? 
  he 's an almost putin level dictator , he probably has billions of dollars . 
  he has more urgent problems like half the country hating him and needing to change the constitution so he can actually be as powerful as putin . 
  why do you think i said that ? 
  right about time when we talk about roman empire 's genocide of carthage . 
  edit : the city had a population of 400k , and the romans killed 350k , enslaved the remaining 50k btw . 
  why do you people think erdo\u011fan would be angry by this stuff ? 
  if anything he 's gon na use it as a political tool . . 
  if denmark and turkey went to war we 'd totally beat you tho lol, 
  [ there 's talk of a joint nato maritime group with romania , turkey , and bulgaria tho probably not gon na happen . 
  ] ( http://www.novinite.com/articles/174565/bulgaria+discussing+joint+nato+maritime+group+with+romania,+turkey ), 
  we did everything to become partners with turkey . 
  so why they did it ( shoot down the plane ) , i got no idea . 
  smh, 
  our borders dont extent that west anymore , you can count all those countries as europe . 
  tell her we 'll build a wall in the channel and erdo\u011fan will pay for it . 
  how can he `` consolidate '' power tho ? 
  he cant even propose a referendum since akp has barely more than half the seats and all other parties hate his guts . 
  why is talaat the main guy ? 
  enver was the most powerful of the three anyway and he is the one who blamed the disastrous sar\u0131kam\u0131\u015f campaign on the armenians . 
   the three main perpetrators of the genocide were sentenced to death in absentia by the turkish courts-martial of 1919 -- 20 . 
  all men were assassinated by armenians . 
  just fyi , two of them and a few more were assassinated but the main guy , enver pa\u015fa , was not . 
  nevertheless he was killed by the soviets when he tried to create a turkic republic in their lands ( a stupid military adventure ) around that time . 
  the amount of support turkey can afford is dwarfed by us ' support , the biggest economy and military power in the world , so it matters . 
  added it to my to-see-list . 
  back in 1945 it makes sense since cold war etc. 
  but know they have no excuse to support them really . 
  also the reason why i cringe every time people say turkey supports islamists ... 
  so does the us . 
  [ even ottoman empire hated them . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ottoman%e2%80%93wahhabi_war ) it 's the biggest threat to world peace right now , imo . 
  lol replace `` russian '' with `` ottoman '' and `` circassians '' with `` armenians '' in your comment and you have literally [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armenian_genocide ) . 
  you 're not an armenian genocide denier , right ? 
  that 's a bannable offense in this sub . 
  is it bannable to call it ethnic cleansing instead of genocide ? 
  yes but it 'd be a political win for turkey . 
  right now our foreign policy is a mess , we have almost no friends etc. 
  erdo\u011fan only knows to make enemies . 
  this would also bring us closer to west . 
  erdo\u011fan pls at least do one good thing for our foreign policy and support this pls, 
  [ you do realize that christians also committed atrocities against muslims right ? 
  not necessarily as damaging but still . 
  reply to this before i go on . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greco-turkish_war_\\ ( 1919 % e2 % 80 % 9322 \\ ) #greek _ massacres_of_turks ), 
  [ total muslim deaths and refugees during these centuries are estimated to be several millions . 
  [ 3 ] it is estimated that during the last decade of the ottoman empire ( 1912-1922 ) when the balkan wars , wwi and war of independence took place , close to 2 million muslims , civilian and military , died in the area of modern turkey.according to the american historian justin mccarthy , between the years 1821 -- 1922 , from the beginning of the greek war of independence to the end of the ottoman empire , five million muslims were driven from their lands and another five and one-half million died , some of them killed in wars , others perishing as refugees from starvation or disease . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/persecution_of_ottoman_muslims#death_toll ) again , it 's not a pissing contest . 
  im not saying muslims suffered more than christians . 
  a better analogy is you kill your neighbors wife , than he kills your entire family . 
  but maybe before you killed his wife , he killed your dog ... who knows who started it ? 
  both sides think they are the victim and the other the aggressor . 
  so does the stab in the back myth compared holocaust , and more so in fact , but we learn about it nonetheless . 
  should we just forget about the muslim pontics/turks that were killed , and only remember the christians ? 
  when we speak of rwandan genocide , we always mention how tutsi were in power and ruled over hutu in colonial days . 
  when we say this , it doesnt mean hutu killing 70 % of tutsi is justified . 
  we say it to give it context . 
  likewise , christian ethnic cleansings/genocides during ww1 can not be discussed without mentioning the plight of muslims . 
  again , it doesnt justify it ; but you have to mention it to give it context . 
  another case is holocaust and `` stab in the back '' myth . 
  you have to give both sides of the argument . 
  how is mentioning muslims also faced massacres/genocides implies others are okay ? 
  wait so `` boris '' actually comes from a turkic language , but unralated to `` baris '' ( my name ), 
  silly japanese , that 's slovakia !, 
  lol why are you linking pro-akp sabah here ? 
  from the bbc article i linked above :  the bill was backed by 376 mps in the 550-seat legislature in the third and final vote of a secret ballot . 
  if you add the number of akp , chp and mhp mps you get 486 . 
  so clearly what you quoted above is wrong . 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36344314  the measure is seen as targeting the pro-kurdish peoples ' democratic party ( hdp ) as well as the main opposition republican people 's party ( chp ) . 
  -  friday 's vote was not without incident as chp lawmakers walked out in protest . 
  btw what do you mean when you say chp voted for it ? 
  chp is the only party trying to defend hdp out of the other three in the parliament . 
  however even now they 're called terror sympathizers , there is a limit to how much they can support hdp . 
  that 's why hdp shouldve spoke against pkk stronger . 
  believe me i 'd rather have hdp in the parliement than akp ( and even mhp if they dont get rid of bahceli ) but the way hdp behaved was just so stupid . 
   the hdp is the only party that actually opposed erdogan come on thats ridiculous and you know it . 
  t only thing hdp achieved as of now is helping erdogan use nationalist fervor against them . 
  if hdp was more willing to distance themselves from pkk , maybe they couldve done something else . 
  right now chp is the country 's only hope against erdogan . 
  ( i was rooting for hdp to get past the threshold 2 years ago , now i wonder if it 'd be better if they didnt make it . ), 
  also the police knew he was sympathetic to groups like isis . . 
  when i see erdogan supporters rejoicing in his rallies , i actually am quite curious what it feels like . 
  if the result turns out to be yes , i just might bang my head against concrete 10 times then go to one of his rallies and try this thing out . 
  it probably feels amazing . 
   pollster gezici , whose research has tended to overestimate opposition support , put the `` yes '' vote ahead for the first time on 53.3 percent in a survey conducted in early april . 
  last month , its founder murat gezici put `` no '' ahead on 51.1 percent . 
  this is it guys , all hail our glorious president erdogan . 
   erdo\u011fan said , while lashing out at saturday 's rally in bern , in which pkk sympathizers displayed a banner that read `` kill erdo\u011fan '' with a gun pointed to the turkish president 's head . 
  he actually loathed islam according to the book `` atat\u00fcrk : the rebirth of a nation '' . 
  if you wan na read about a more interesting period , read [ this book ] ( https://www.amazon.com/ataturk-patrick-kinross/dp/1842125990/ref=pd_sbs_14_img_0?_encoding=utf8&amp;psc=1&amp;refrid=b40vde2wj3n7dq2nsbzd ) about ataturk 's life . 
  it starts at the end of the 19th century and ends just before ww2 . 
  in fact i 'd recommend it to the turks as well , there are a lot of things that we didnt learn in school about him in the book . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/e-memorandum#international_reaction_to_the_e-memorandum read this article carefully if you want to know how the eu saved erdogan 's ass . 
  you ca n't just do the opposite of what you 've been doing and hope it fixes it . 
  you do realize that the eu supported him heavily until recently right ? 
  lol i do n't have any faith in it either so you 're asking the wrong guy . 
  but if the vote is no , it 's true that he cant do much about it and will probably have to give up power in a few years .
