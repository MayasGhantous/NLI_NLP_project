  if the result is a no , he 'll be done for dont worry . 
  no , if the result is no it shouldnt be done . 
  but if it 's yes , then turkey deserves all the consequences . 
  you know the referendum hasnt passed and the polls favor no right ? 
  yes ... 
  dude it doesnt matter what would be `` nice '' right now . 
  we 're having a referendum on whether the country will become a dictatorship or not for crying out loud . 
  if the yes wins that would `` hurt a country in the long run . 
  well they got the colors right at least edit : omg they say during the video `` no one can humiliate the turkish people '' oh the irony, 
  is n't like 99 % of the fault on turkey 's side ? 
  calling him an `` ottoman '' during the war of inde . 
  seems bizarre . 
  that is akin to calling lenin a tsarist during the russian civil war . 
  ataturk fought against the ottoman government , who sided with the allies you know ? 
  of course not . 
  however , according to your logic you continue to be a japanese official even after resigning . 
  how can he be an ottoman official if he resigned ??? 
  how could he be trying to save the empire from annihilation if he was the one who destroyed it ??? 
  stop with the double-think m8 . 
  what you said :  kemal was an ottoman official fighting to ensure that the ottoman empire would n't be completelly annihilated reality :  [ he resigned from the ottoman army on 8 july 1919 and the ottoman government issued a warrant for his arrest . 
  later , he was condemned to death . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mustafa_kemal_atat%c3%bcrk#turkish_war_of_independence_.281919.e2.80.931922.29 ) as you can see the first two things that you said in your first sentence are completely false . 
  he is the one who destroyed the ottoman empire in fact . 
  yup and also he beat back the greek and their british and french masters , that 's probably why the he 's so salty . 
  it 's an independence war at every sense of the word . 
  you have no idea what you are talking about lol, 
  what ? 
  i already now that ... 
  actually the ottoman `` empire '' was allied with the europeans against ataturk and the independence movement : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kuva-yi_inzibatiye  the kuv\u00e2-i \u0130nzib\u00e2tiyye ( caliphate army ) was an army established on 18 april 1920 by the imperial government of the ottoman empire in order to fight against the turkish national movement in the aftermath of world war i. 
  it was commanded by s\u00fcleyman \u015eefik pasha . 
   the british supported the kuv\u00e2-i \u0130nzib\u00e2tiyye with the aim of enforcing british policy in the region and of stabilizing the remnants of the ottoman empire . 
  supported by the british , the sultan began a propaganda war throughout the country . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/revolt_of_ahmet_anzavur  the revolt of ahmet anzavur was in fact a series of revolts led by the ottoman gendarme officer ahmet anzavur against the turkish national movement during the turkish war of independence . 
  the revolt was coordinated by the british secret service and the monarchist ottoman government against the republican turkish nationalist forces . 
  lol you think akp-voters are able to distinguish between various european countries ? 
  he isnt an opposition leader , he 's a former ally of erdogan . 
  is this an important community ? 
  it looks like it 's 55-53 -- 45-47 in favor of no , but who knows what tayyip is planning . 
  i want them back in turkey , since im living in europe now . 
  he will be if his referendum succeeds ( and he is the one elected in 2019 ) , but he isnt atm . 
  otherwise why would he need to ally with mhp to get the constitution change put on a referendum ? 
  authoritarian : favoring or enforcing strict obedience to authority , especially that of the government , at the expense of personal freedom . 
  dictator : a ruler with total power over a country , typically one who has obtained power by force . 
  turkey is the first one . 
  not the second . 
  then your country shouldnt have taken millions of them foreigners who are more loyal to turkey than the country they live in . 
  it 's not . 
  but it will be if the referendum passes . 
  inb4 erdogan declares himself caliph, 
  lmao : 83.4 % : 1/10 16.2 % : 10/10 0.3 % : 2-9/10, 
  lol, 
  not `` sultans '' but `` learders '' . 
  ataturk was the guy who ended sultans but they put him there too . 
  tho obviously erdogan 's by far the worst `` leader '' out of the ones they put there . 
  shit i need to get me some gyros, 
  yup , plus the pools look like no has a 5-10 percent lead over yes , so he needs to do something . 
  actually , this is exactly what erdogan needs right now : an outside enemy so people vote for his new constitution . 
  isnt le pen in favor of welfare ? 
  also isnt fillon against immigration ? 
  cereal masterrace !, 
  nope , \u015f ( sh in english , ch in french ) and \u00e7 ( ch sometimes in english , i guess tch in french ) are both simple sounds . 
  \u00e7 is n't \u015f + t. it 's ** ch ** air . 
  ** tch ** a ** tch ** er in french . 
  i mean you write it like this ok but the sound isnt simply when you add the two . 
  try to make these three sounds without any vowels , your tongue will be at different locations in all three . 
  the turkish written system was created by ataturk and every letter has a unique sound , this is even if i 've never seen a turkish word before . 
  i 'll know how to pronounce it correctly . 
  i predict all the people 's names in the second round will end in - n. 
  i wish there was still like 20 % christians in turkey , no way islamism would be able to foster if that was the case . 
   you turks genocided people who were native to anatolia dude we * are * those people . 
  i do n't look like a mongolian from central asia , more like someone from a south european country . 
  i saw this even in turkish-reddit-like site eksisozluk , which means literally everyone in the world knows of this lol, 
  damn i do n't blame hitler for than sweet lebensraum, 
   at least it basically turned into world 's most unique election campaign lol neither 2016 u.s. elections nor brexit referandum can hold a candle to our referandum that 's for sure . 
  oh fuck off with trying to make an external enemy so that people will support your dictatorship-making constitution change . 
  thanks merkel , now our press is surely free !, 
  [ wikipedia link ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_carthage_\\ ( c. _ 149_bc \\ ) ) the city 's population was 400k . 
  350k was killed , 50k enslaved . 
  so 87.5 % of them were killed and the remaining 12.5 % enslaved . 
  didnt they literally kill ninety percent of the carthagians and enslave the rest ? 
  if we come from monkeys then how come we still have erdogan ? 
  checkmate atheists . 
  kek, 
  let me tell you how i remember which way gauche ( left ) is in french . 
  so i know my right hand is my right hand , from that i infer the other hand is the left one . 
  ( in turkish right-sag , left-sol ) . 
  so since both sol and left contain the letter `` l '' , they are the same . 
  after that since both right and droit contain the letter `` r '' in them , they are the same . 
  so gauche is the direction that is not droit . 
  this all happens in less than a second now obviously but when im thinking about something else i can actually find myself doing this routine slowly . 
  oh ok . yeah sure that would be a good idea considering trumps views on nato . 
  so i say eu is a match for russia and doesnt need us , you say eu shouldnt break apart . 
  i already agree with what you wrote . 
  did you respond to the wrong person ? 
  i always think of it as this : rightwing means religious , and east is more religious than west so on the map east is right . 
  seriously , after ww2 , europe obviously needed the us since ussr would be able to roll though europe easily . 
  now though the eu is more than a match for russia , they really dont need the us .

  akp is responsible .
