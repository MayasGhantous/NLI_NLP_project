  what it has to do with torturing failed coup prisoners ? 
  edit : a failed coup attempt must n't encourage torture though, 
  try picturing high sparrow from game of thrones . 
  you ll realize how one person using religion can be so powerful and dangerous in time, 
  not even close . 
  not even close one bit . 
  seriously guys . 
  gulen movement is the biggest threat to our country . 
  even worse than erdogan . 
  we all know that you westerners are not quite informed about him but just take a quick google search and see the gulen movement history . 
  its a very dangerous movement whose only aim to infiltrate and take over government to pull of another humeini regime, 
  do n't mind me im just being silly :p, 
  just look at what time it is ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6yt6y1a.jpg ), 
  he is like the high sparrow from game of thrones if i could give you an example . 
  that might give u an idea actually . 
  i am really curious about your age, 
  yeah for you this gulen came out of nowhere and now you see his name everywhere but for us the `` cemaat '' was always a phantom menace lurking in shadows recruiting members here and there by baiting naive young students religious feelings . 
  simply they are everywhere from schools to government buildings . 
  its not an exaggeration, 
  you want us to march into your premises ? 
  alright, 
  my grammar senses are tingling, 
  why did you get downvoted . 
  we are all here against the coup , against the gulen movement so we support erdogan 's purge upon them but we do not support erdogan s rest of policies at all . 
  foreigners seem to be not able to differentiate that at all . 
  erdogan = king joffrey gulen = high sparrow, 
   some bulgarians still view turkey as the biggest threat to their national security do we even remember a country named bulgaria at all here ? 
  apart from mysterious missed calls . 
  only my heart goes boom boom, 
  ehh i was thinking the same but there are so many people who is known having ties with gulen among the military who pulled off the coup . 
  tomorrow we deny it, 
  gib back, 
  not really . 
  f\u00f6r the first time in turkey everyone is agreed on this topic . 
  g\u00fclen s infiltration into positions are real and we all have stories about them . 
  g\u00fclen is a serious threat to everyone . 
  he s trying to pull off a humeyni for years and i think he s more dangerous than erdo\u011fan, 
  - no , my troops are just passing through, 
  god damnit doctor . 
  you know who else is famous for infiltrating every domain of a government structure ? . . 
  fethullah gulen . . shots fired . 
  just teasing , 
  i hanged a turkish flag and erdogan picture on my balcony . 
  fuck that , those two are the most precious shelters from islamist mobs right now, 
  silly question . 
  of course erdogan . 
  andd quite surprising that akp is providing free transport to the rally while some akp members are actively inviting people . 
  its kinda scary . 
  here is the thing i do n't understand . 
  those fucktards benefit from the leftist socialist policies in europe and vote for left wing parties to keep the status quo of their welfare , as they do n't care about what they do vote for as long as those left wing parties has policies that keep giving them social benefits , and then they go and vote for the most islamist most conservative right wing party they can find in turkey ( in countries where they can have duel citizenship like netherlands ) because `` muh ottoman , muh religion , 1915 never happened '' . 
  i mean how absurdly hypocrite , how selfish shit to do is this . 
  by actively taking a side of turning my country into a shithole meanwhile sitting and enjoying the freedom and wealth in foreign lands . 
  fuck this . 
  you re officially banned from / r/erdogan edit : of course its a thing ... :d, 
  as long as the beer is ice cold and bacon is fresh i am down, 
  ~ ~ oh how i miss the times we were just petty rivals with you . 
  would never guess id seek for those days ~ ~ did n't notice that he was trolling, 
  i have a brother who is swiss citizen , i ll try him first i guess . 
  but thank you it feels better, 
  notice me, 
  ~ ~ i dont think reddit would give away their ips ~ ~ i stand corrected, 
  often i find myself thinking about if i start walking now i might end up next to greece border in two weeks . 
  the urge is getting stronger . 
  fuck im leftist and atheist and probably they already know what i am from social media . 
  seeking for asylum sounds more and more appeal,
