  you remove kebab by eating it . 
  kebab wins everytime, 
  says the ... wait a min, 
  here we go again . 
  noone is at their best during war time . 
  `` because arabs turned out to be proud warriors and sided with the righteous brits against evil ottomans because western values '' . 
  fify because you know how western media is . 
  holly sheets this thread is the epitome of irony, 
  i know right . 
  it was a game that i watch time to time the last 15 minutes . 
  who else waited a last second goal again ? 
  hehe anyway congrats croatia, 
  arent you a lil bit biased for thinking every turk who is a bit of loving his country is erdoganist ? 
  so you re saying the whole thrace is not in europe but only `` istanbul '' ? 
  dont you know turkey bashing is so hot right now, 
  we should open a subreddit for this, 
  so if you re gon na use the famous `` only a lil portion of turkey is in europe '' banter , i should remind you that thrace is as big as switzerland and bigger than many more european countries . 
  not even mentioning the european side of `` istanbul '' can easily overthrown many of them economically and by population . 
  which gives us enough big of soil to bug your ass anytime we want . 
  now go cry at your corner over your infinite butthurt, 
  `` pats on your head '', 
  hell yeah suck it germany amiright guys . . guys ? . 
  nationalism is bad . 
  like every other - ism it only divides humankind . 
  we wont see it but i hope for a borderless world, 
  a fine example of commenting without having a single idea of related topic but just to say something for circlejerks, 
  bitch you re just jealous of our swag, 
   turkey is n't a european country . 
  only a small percentage is geographically europe every single time ... no sir we are not eastern nor western , or middle eastern . 
  we are the fucking anatolian . 
  we have our own culture , our own way of living , energy and rhythm flowing from west to east , mixing western into eastern together with middle east cherries . 
  we are the bridge you ll only fail to categorize us if you try to norrow us down in one single direction . 
  the past and the present runs a flame in our vains , our islam is mixed with our ancient shamanistic rituals , our people are mixed with thousand of nation 's bloodline . . so pls . 
  take your labels and back study them harder till you have a better insight for us . 
  because erdogan puts his followers in position considering the level of their loyalty . 
  qualification for the position comes waaay later . 
   i do n't deny that it happened either . 
  you get banned from this subreddit if you deny it . 
  did someone say freedom of speech / s edit . 
  whoa people calm down i was being sarcastic . 
  damn you pitchfork-happy keyboard warriors, 
  my ex is armenian, 
   edrogan is notoriously anti-israel and has made anti-semitic comments in the past , so it 's funny that suddenly now he is advocating for this . 
  you know my country is kinda funny to watch if you re not a citizen, 
  sorry my bad . 
  i thought i was texting to my ex . 
  i respect your engineercraft german . 
  its awsome, 
  he is just drunk with power . 
  he probably thinks he has power to say anything he wants and get credit for it . 
  i dont understand the term . 
  recy . . what . ? 
  i dont have a bicycle for that, 
  i am trying but it doesnt allow me to ... oh wait . . 
  because we all wanted to make you feel threatened, 
  can confirm . 
  you turk now, 
  hold ... my ... beer . 
  devil in the detail, 
  here you go :d https://translate.google.com/#en/tr/king just click the little sound button on the right . 
  at least it shows that we take you serious enough , maybe you should give it a thought . 
  english for others : `` cut the crap , like we dont know what happened to the other cult of personalities like adnan menderes and \u00f6zal , once they lose their power their subjects turned against them lightning fast , do you really think that the same subjects will not turn against erdogan, 
  those people only believe in money . 
  take enough and they ll question everything you ever think of . 
  we are willing to suffer if its gon na get rid of the morons as lesser morons wont be able to find a shit to eat and rebel to erdogan in return, 
  savage, 
  many of secular turks alike are actually looking forward for a serious collapse of economy that ll shake the pseudo throne of erdogan . 
  its the only way of getting rid of him because democracy is not working right now . 
  so this news are good for us . . for a greater good we re willing to suffer a bit, 
  how far this incompetent fucktards will keep bringing shame to our nation . . seriously . 
  . argh, 
  the independence movement started with ataturk 's arriving on samsun on 1919 , in despite of palace 's immediate effective orders for him to return . 
  so in a way he was a rebel . 
  look at you all like `` fuck yeah suck it erdo\u011fan '' , what you dont understand is this is exactly what he wants .
