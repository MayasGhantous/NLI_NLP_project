  bwahah same here i was like whaat, 
  even though i find raison d'etre of pkk is just , i do not approve their methods . 
  terrorism is terrorism there is no sugar coating it . 
  as a french you should understand that the most . 
  i envy you guys :d, 
  grow up, 
  you wish i wish that we are european . 
  bitch we are the east and west , we are both and neither , we are the motherfucking bridge . 
  you re just jealous of our two continental swag . 
  rest assured my friend the tram is in the european side of istanbul , you can sleep like a baby with a clear conscience of knowing that you indeed saved the spirit of europe . 
  lol nice bait . 
  we all r/europe know what you re, 
  hell yeaa . . wait what ? 
  you again ? 
  are n't you tired of spreading hate today, 
   for those not in the know how ? 
  best enemies forever < 3, 
  you re the one being all cringy today . 
  go out take some breath, 
  `` and eagerly takes the bait '', 
  eh some people needs enemies to feel alive . 
  lol that reminds me of the ~ ~ grandpa ~ ~ grandma from `` my big fat greek wedding '', 
  we should welcome our machine overlords . 
  the sooner the better, 
  no we do n't hate each other . 
  politicians do . 
  two worlds : underground bases / s, 
  basically kittens, 
  i agree double citizenship causes so much trouble , you got ta make those people willing to join to society but letting them having ties back to their former countries it becomes impossible . 
  they still cling to their homeland as if they are guests in your country . 
  thats a good question though . 
  how much of a freedom we are willing to sacrifice to live in harmony . 
  guys stop measuring your dicks . 
  ^ and ^ measure ^ mine ^ ^ ^ we 'll ^ ^ ^ ^ bang ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ok . 
   well , it would help if erdogan stops telling the turkish people that they should always be turkish citicens before belonging to the nation they are actually home to . 
  fully heartedly agree with that  i agree that there is alot to be done for intigration , but also that some of them are not willing to let themselves be intigrated . 
  we have quite a community here that basically want to continue to live their lives like they do in turkey , with turkish values and turkish behaviour , just with the german social system and minimum wage . 
  and thats the problem , as a wise man said `` in rome do as romans do '' if you keep letting turks being turk in germany then you will keep having those issues . 
  turks in germany should start act like a german , they should call themselves as german from turkish descendant . 
  i really dont know how this should be done without major breakthroughs and breaking the ghetto communities apart though . 
  even though i agree that it can be true , pointing fingers without any actual proof is equally misleading and provoking, 
  god damn it , such a nazi, 
  and which one is the one region that will bind others in the dark ? 
  love how calling someone nazi became a uniting point :d, 
  of course this is the top comment, 
  and the fourth reich was an economical empire . 
  turkey = hindi :d, 
  `` being in the inferior part of switzerland and not thankful for being ascended '' fify, 
  if i know anything erdogan is the rookie student next to putin, 
  \u3064 \u25d5 _ \u25d5 \u3064 gib attention, 
  everyone does tax evasion in here because if you dont there is no way for you to survive under the most stupid tax laws . 
  the government is not there for you to help you expand your newly business . 
  no its there like a vulture waiting for his pray , waiting for you to earn then it attacks to take it away from you in any way . 
  [ that brings back memories ] ( http://www.dorkly.com/post/55045/the-greatest-gaming-generation ), 
  `` passive aggressively drinks tea '', 
  god damn it thats cheating, 
  love it, 
  how the fuck did they not hear the sound all echoing outside, 
  even if he tries it would be quite hard , the whole worlds eyes will be on the referendum progress watching it non blinking , opposition parties established independent supervision organizations during last elections to keep it rig proof , it will be same again , people actually own their votes and keep watching after it . 
  at least that part of democracy is working in here, 
  man i love greeks . 
  amazing culture , superb wines and food awesome people but politicians keep fucking it up every chance of friendly interaction . 
  thats a quite huge salary, 
  [ oh boy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f77plfrp3ok ), 
  it 's not racism . 
  its not negative news about turkey or turks , its about erdogan being equally bully and idiot . 
  or how democracy does n't work when the majority of public is uneducated, 
  whats up with the latest trend with these linguistic maps that portraying eastern parts of turkey in a different colors . 
  as if people live there suddenly forgot turkish ? 
  did the freaking center of the turkey all of a sudden forget turkish ? 
  do majority of residents at those areas started to speak another language daily ? 
  the hell with this ? 
  dont get me wrong im all in for kurdish rights and equality , i really am but this feels like nothing but a purposed familiarization to distinguish kurds living in turkey , alienation from region as if they dont know a single word of turkish . 
  just like old days, 
  if you say so dude . 
  not 500 but exactly 946 years ago with the [ battle of manzikert ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_manzikert ) , turks entered anatolia . 
  edit : why the hell are u downvoting me for this . . really . . ? 
  cost of living literally in the middle of east and west, 
  found one, 
  thankfully most politicians are smarter than your average reddit user otherwise we would be having our 15th world war . 
  that would teach him to shut the fuck up because shit like this can happen and out of nowhere you might sit in the middle of all guilt to be claimed . 
  not really the word is not made of 2 words as u suggest , it 's not `` al beni '' its `` albeni '' and it means `` allure '' that way . 
  this is exactly what he wants . 
  do you want him to gain more supporters with the victim policy ? 
  calculate two steps further before suggesting anything, 
  he is fishing for right wing votes . 
  he s gone full retard because its all or nothing at the referendum for him . 
  its just so badass looking at those borders . 
  the only empire that made every drop of the mediterranian sea into his own little lake . 
  i dont know man how can mirrors be real if our eyes are n't real, 
  i know the feeling mate, 
  it must be a bizarre feeling to be able to see whole country from your window if you were happen to be living in a tall building . 
  you misspelled `` iskender birbu\u00e7uk '', 
  / r/murrica, 
  if only ottomans were n't treating their subjects as nothing but a source for taxes and army , and could lay some improvements instead of leaving them be on the mercy of high officers those people wont be hating us this much . 
  its kinda all or nothing for him, 
  whoa nazis are expending . 
  lords of kobol, 
  mine !, 
  80 million muslims trying to join , gaining a huge vote power within the council , its a big fat chance for every right wing christian party to rise and shine upon against it .
