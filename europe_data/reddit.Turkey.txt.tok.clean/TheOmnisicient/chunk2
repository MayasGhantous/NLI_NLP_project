  why complaining . 
  it 's free training for both sides.where else greek forces will have a chance to practice otherwise . 
  two birds one stone, 
  we did n't do it, 
  are you ? 
  haha reminds me of this : https://youtu.be/fji9sa5rjws?t=5m8s, 
  ... sooon,

  you have a brain . 
  none of the boards would be there anymore in two hours if we had done something same in here . . sadly .

  `` i forgot my wallet give me a free ride or i ll cut you '' . . works everytime ^ ^, 
  bourbon . . weak . . wait till we dominate world with kentucky fried turkey !, 
  it 's all about looking accountable , a well-dressed presumable well being citizen talking about forgotten wallet is accountable , believable , we think `` ok things happen im sure he will pay next time '' but when a guy in loose clothes looking like a beggar say the same thing , first thing we think would be `` yeah sure , like that happens for the first time , bet you do that every day , why do n't you get a job '' . 
  it 's all about looks . 
  today syria tomorrow the whole kentucky !, 
  damn got ta play shadowrun now, 
  i 'm sure some kid with bad haircut would find this useful, 
  yes i would ... ^ ^ ^ pls, 
  fuck yeah get on the cyberpunk train, 
  that 's cute, 
  i shall watch it and i was referring that id watch a tv show that all the prophets are gathering together for fighting crime with their super powers haha or a tv drama show they reincarnate as different people they realize who they were and they see the wrongdoings of their religion and try to fix it but noone believes in them and stuff . . ahh the possibilities, 
  damn id watch that show :d, 
  actually it 's quite peacefull for the first time in a decade as erdo\u011fan speaks on tv near to zero . 
  wait . . i was expecting an animated cartoon ... : /, 
  big boss ? 
  god damn it kojima revealing the plot this early !, 
   the first sunlight at dawn got ta be starting with tan, 
  the first usage of word polat was in dede korkut stories ( turkish mythology ) 1400 years ago , origin of the word is persian : p\u014dl\u0101d meaning as same . 
  also there is an armenian word polapat , bo\u0121bad \u057a\u0578\u0572\u0561\u057a\u0561\u057f , is also from persian . 
  haha i might ve been translated that wrong . 
  yildirim is the lightening that strikes from land , \u015fim\u015fek is the one happens between clouds, 
  yeah true more like a worrior, 
  the word er does n't state sex, 
  take erdogan he is eager for being a sultan more than anyone, 
  turkish : * yilmaz : indomitable , never tired * kaya : rock * dem\u0130r : iron * \u00c7el\u0130k : steel * \u015eah\u0130n : eagle * yildiz : star * yildirim : lightning ( the one you see during storms , strikes from land with great noise ) * \u00d6zt\u00dcrk : real turk ( \u00f6z means essence but also dictates the originality of something ) * aydin : enlightened * \u00d6zdem\u0130r : real iron * arslan : leon * do\u011ean : hawk or `` he who is born '' * kili\u00c7 : sword * aslan : leon ( aslan and arslan are same ) * \u00c7et\u0130n : tough * kara : black * ko\u00c7 : ram * kurt : wolf * \u00d6zkan : he whose blood is true * \u015e\u0130m\u015eek : lightning , happens between clouds also states speed , flash * polat : strong steel or strong as steel * \u00d6zcan : real life , or real one , it doesnt make much sense in turkish too * korkmaz : never afraid * \u00c7akir : grayish blue , goshawk * erdo\u011ean : the one who is born as a man , warrior ps : [ government source ] ( http://www.nvi.gov.tr/files/file/istatistikler/isimler/en%20%c3%a7ok%20kullan%c4%b1lan%20soyad.pdf ), 
  [ a countdown president erdo\u011fan has been off-air for  ( http://www.tickcounter.com/countup/20150607023000pm/w433/president_erdo%c4%9fan_has_been_off-air_for?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=widget ), 
  fuck those portakals, 
  you can change `` redditors '' with `` humanity '' also, 
  also hitler . 
  beginning does not justify the ending always, 
  implying he never was, 
  it 's not an offer ^ - ^, 
  erdogan simply trying to lead a proximity war in syria . 
  that idiot is gon na create some taliban like establishment in here if he goes being shortsighted like this . 
  here have some syrian from us then , 
  everything is going smooth according to plan . . irish master race . 
  remove sirp remove sirp, 
  can we replace them ? 
  plz ? 
  does make you wish you had sweet sweet oil too . 
  e-europe sempai . 
  notice us, 
  tiger . . absolutely haram !, 
  the worst part is erdogan is the head of the stinking roots , it wo n't cure the garden by only cutting the head off , the roots must be cleaned, 
  yeah i admit a lil bit tiny wibbly wobbly exaggeration , yet i do n't think isis would like your mixtape, 
  this is what happens when you put people in charge for not their qualifications but for their support of your political gain . 
  the person charged on the country 's science department is once a zoo director . 
  he is there only becouse his support and loyalty to erdogan not for his qualifications . 
  it 's not a secret that most of the conservative islamists are strongly against any kind of art , history , music and science.put it shortly anything that advance humanity and accents consciousness . 
  and to be honest i would n't be surprised if the damages done were intentional . 
  is krillin ded yet ? 
   oh man , it would be absolutely hilarious if turkey starts a war over something that boils down to `` they said mean things about grandpa !!!!!! '', 
  being a turk requires ability to declare war when someone says something mean to your mother . 
  so i wouldnt be so sure . 
  classic erdogan and his ad hominem, 
  can confirm . 
  am second to throne, 
  i believe both armenians and turks are not as innocent as they claim to be . 
  hmmm `` taking notes '', 
  can confirm , swearing to god everytime i pay taxes, 
  i just love how comments like these gets down voted because circle jerk . 
  why noone asked about our opinions too ? . . 
  va fancullo, 
  who hurt you greece !, 
  ca n't wait till it ll be our fault, 
  and then you sit in the corner with guilt and wonder what did you do wrong this time . 
  envious ? 
  everybody loves those cheeky cunts, 
  so we can decline later, 
  nah it 's pan ottomana time, 
  can confirm, 
  beautiful, 
  fish and chips . . you dont need anything else, 
  humour version . . suuure :d, 
  the golden horde best day of my life, 
  gib back, 
  we buffed you bruh we pushed you to the limits :p, 
  we all know those reasons the problem is noone is being honest with those , especially politicians are trying to suger coat and get round the reasons you mantioned a lot . 
  yet we shaped the history of europe more than many other countries within europe, 
  universal values of humanism , enlightment , science , individualism , equality and understanding but only if you re within europe otherwise you can go fuck yourself you re not that worthy of our universal values, 
  ^ ^ ^ pls, 
  `` agressively drinks tea '', 
  [ moustaches are manly . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejtqonynlps ), 
  just make one saying why this country is not a part of this its rival country for everyone :d, 
  yeah europe why are n't we in the eu \u0ca0_\u0ca0, 
  your welcome portugal . 
  we respect your indipendence . . ^ for ^ now,
