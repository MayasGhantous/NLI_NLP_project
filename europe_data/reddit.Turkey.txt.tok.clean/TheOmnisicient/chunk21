  mfw people did n't get the very obvious north korea joke . 
  converting it to a mosque just as `` glorious old days '' and media would n't talk about it ? 
  now sit and think about it again, 
  really ? 
  because no one is talking about it here not even on news . 
  tone it down with the evil turkey meta a lil bit please, 
  yeah i concur , people are fed up with facebook and they are going for twitter and instagram , as they provide a more direct communication, 
   nobody ever goes to south east turkey ( including turkish citizens ) then why the fuck we are trying too hard to keep a land that even we dont use, 
  allegedly mental issues , so he s been transferred . 
  not released, 
  i think he is really pushing for a backslash than a civil war . 
  i can see how a civil war would benefit him, 
  at this point its all pro level trolling, 
  erdogan makes it sure that the only incompetent idiots stay in opposition . 
  any rising head is cut off early . 
  look at meral ak\u015fener example . 
  can confirm . 
  i love myself and am a cat person, 
  `` ultimate pee madness gt2000 '', 
  deal with it kiddo edit : ( \u261e \uff9f\u30ee\uff9f ) \u261e could n't deal, 
  bwhaha boris s channel is amazing , watch how he puts his car into slavization also, 
  i wish we could say take that switzerland instead, 
  in doubt that it will be enough for you, 
  whoa dude , i can only hope that you find happiness in your life, 
  thus the restoration you einstein, 
  israel is always an ally for us , in spite of arabs backstabbing us on every occasion , i prefer their friendship over arabs always ,, 
   everything is too much ftfy, 
  its too late . 
  much much much more people would join if it was right after the elections . 
  i still do n't know what those colors represents . 
  seems nothing happened at all edit : i refuse to put s / at the end , your inability to read sarcasm is a no problem of mine . 
  jumping off the fence , off from a boat , living illegally etc takes a certain degree of unlikable characteristic approach which many of said people do n't have hence they stay . 
  those turks ( sane ones ) avoid them like a contagious cancer in their daily life . 
  trust me . 
  also there are as much as bright and secularist people who ca n't go because of family , education or money issues . 
  lol go cry, 
  you betcha and i bet that so called opera project is there just to soften who would oppose the deconstruction , once done it will magically disappear and they will try to erect a mosque , since erecting a mosque in taksim is a text book revenge masturbation of them islamists, 
  join us . 
  i tricks you u fool yunan bwhaha, 
  turkish airplanes violating greek airspace, 
  g\u00fclen is a cunt as hard as erdo\u011fan , but everybody can see gulen is being used for an excuse to oppress everyone against him . 
  one of us , one of us, 
  / r/gatekeeping, 
  it happens \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) \\ _ / \u00af, 
  hd praying, 
  are n't we all, 
  accidental renaissance, 
  took me a while then burst a laughter . 
  that 's exactly what was on my mind, 
  only americans think british is classy . 
  yeah indeed , to be honest i wasnt very surprised with the numbers that people have been impeached at first because the gulen was balls deep within the government and public services . 
  and then it became ridiculous to witness how erdogan uses it to blame anyone opposing him, 
  the gulen movement is real thou , ask any turk and they all share their version of story with them . 
  it was the biggest religious cult in turkey . 
  its as real as erdogans using them as a mean of usurping power and oppressing opposition though, 
  also the taxing on alcohol is absurdly high . 
  most people ca n't afford the third glass, 
  get out, 
  sh-should i release the dutches i hold in my basement then ? 
  \u1555 ( \u141b ) \u1557 o boi o boi steps stayla is ma life ah, 
   calls other countries shitthole  elects trump \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  yeah ca n't argue with that . 
  erdogan is evil trump is dumb, 
  at least erdogan is smarter, 
  i know right , how he does it, 
  [ statements like this is why trump got elected ] ( http://i3.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/022/940/spongebobicon.jpg ), 
  i 'm ashamed of erdogan but this dumb fuck is even worse, 
  your suggesting them to leave their rooms and do actual physical work . 
  that 's absurd, 
  but this is netherlands office, 
  ^ `` gigantic billboards with neon lights to the obvious joke '', 
  yes, 
  says the turk, 
  whoa reeks of nazi evil mfw oblivious people downvoting the obvious joke, 
  lol have you ever been so butthurt that you go and make an account for it, 
  its not something new xd cough * barbarossa, 
  pls, 
  they follow mecca time, 
  yeah it was a very painful transition for us and it left a huge mark . 
  we still have troubles when its about trusting foreigners . 
  think you need to go out more, 
  i thought we were doing that, 
  the glorious cringe, 
  fenerbah\u00e7e is not a country . 
  . . yet, 
  when in doubt align with tacos, 
  i wish, 
  the title sounds like an american college comedy, 
  the whole aegean sea dispute is a total clusterfuck , dont know how it can be solved without losing your sanity to be honest, 
  because no one cares really . 
  it 's not even news . 
  not even on tv , not even on talk forums , nowehere but here . 
  this is what happens when you learn your history from hollywood films, 
  make no mistake , gulen is no better , both erdogan and him are the same shit . 
  nobody said that democracy is a flawless system . 
  it needs to be protected from charlatans like erdogan to gain more power by abusing it . 
  the example is right in front of you why we need fail safes because we are not living in an utopic world where everyone has 150 avarage iq and sharing the ultimate freedom and enlightening values, 
  gulen is high sparrow erdogan is cercei they both are equally bad, 
  voting is basic human right but right to live is bigger , there should be fail-safes to avoid democracy being abused by democratic votes . 
  voting for something this drastic , probably would ruin countless lives , and not even be responsible nor be subjected to it .
