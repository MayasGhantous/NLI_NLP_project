looks like it 's straight out of mirror 's edge . 
  no one in turkey actually cares about joining eu besides akp , get over it . 
  i 'm actually not familiar with that . 
  i 'll look into it . 
  bill gates amounts of money , since i 'd have to pay every single person within a few kilometers not to lynch me . 
  ** edit : ** by the way to be clear , i idolize ataturk myself . 
  he truly was a badass motherfucker that understood what it meant to be a leader and just * how things worked * . 
  well , we did give it a cool name . 
  kebab is cool . 
  also there are very , very different kinds of kebabs . 
  the one you 're thinking of is sis kebab . 
  not only did you talk about the armenian genocide in public but you actually talked about ataturk in the same conversation ? 
  wow , you guys were actually lucky to have got away without too much trouble . 
  anyway , i do n't think ataturk had * anything * to do with that . 
  actually , he could n't , he was a medium/high ranking military officer that i believe did n't have enough pull to affect those kind of decisions . 
  while the over idolization of ataturk among turkish people is sort of unhealthy , he was undeniably one of the most effective , charismatic and progressive leaders the world has ever seen . 
  and i 'm not saying that because i 'm turkish . 
  edit : changed to be clearer . 
  i agree that there is n't aggression between the two sides in cyprus right now . 
  but with trnc 's lack of international recognition , turkey ca n't really perform a total withdrawal . 
  well , with the current state of international recognition ( or lack thereof ) trnc has i do n't think it would be as simple as that . 
  though it is a good point . 
  i kind of regret that i stepped down to his level , i apologize for the name calling and the pointless insulting . 
  i do have an actual informative post in that pile of posts though . 
  i 'll copy and paste that here in hopes of a more civil discussion . 
  `` let me chime in here , since most people obviously have no clue why the northern cyprus issue exists in the first place . 
  according to london and zurich agreements ( 1959 ) , cyprus was to be a partnership of turkish and greek cypriot communities . 
  the eventual turkish intervention was because of the violation of these agreements by greek cypriots attempting to unite the island with greece and deny the turkish cypriots political equality . 
  there was 11 years of bloodshed committed by the greek cypriots on the island , and over a hundred turkish cypriot villages burnt and destroyed . 
  even nicos sampson , then leader of cyprus said in an interview from greek newspaper eleftherotipia , `` had turkey not intervened i not only would have declared enosis ( unification with greece ) but i would have annihilated the turks in cyprus . '' '', 
  most people ( and by that i mean almost every other turk i know ) deny the armenian genocide because , `` well , they killed a lot of turks too , and it was during a war . '', 
  both of those statements are true mind you , but that does n't make it fair to kill ( even if indirectly by forcefully migrating them ) a whole bunch of people . 
  it 's a big taboo in turkey . 
  i 'd , if i 'm lucky , get some very mean looks and bad words if i said armenian genocide was n't bullshit in public , in case of bad luck , there would be some fists swinging around . 
  not to say this is people 's fault , for they 're taught as such in history lessons in school . 
  ** edit : ** for why the country as a whole denies it , i do n't know . 
  i mean ottoman empire did it , not turkey . 
  we do n't have something to lose , it 'd only give some closure to the relatives of the victims . 
  though i 'd also like armenians to actually admit having killed quite a lot of turks at that time too . 
  you were n't talking about today , and if you were , it made no sense . 
  there is no `` protecting a minority with violence '' going on . 
  i honestly do n't know what you mean by that if you 're talking about today . 
  how is an actual quote propaganda ? 
  also you assume that anyone but some of the akp crowd gives two shits about joining your already faltering eu . 
  i 'll just stop replying to your comments which are obviously trollish in nature . 
  have fun deluding yourself . 
  yep , showing your obvious ignorance about this topic you try so hard to argue about . 
  you very obviously have no idea why the intervention even occurred in the first place , you may want to read up on it . 
  you can actually start by reading my comment explaining it in this thread . 
  we do n't want `` you '' to do anything , and chp has a lot of support * because * of the rightful intervention of cyprus . 
  i do n't even know why i keep responding to you . 
  i usually do n't feed obvious trolls . 
  let me chime in here , since most people obviously have no clue why the northern cyprus issue exists in the first place . 
  according to london and zurich agreements ( 1959 ) , cyprus was to be a partnership of turkish and greek cypriot communities .

  even nicos sampson , then leader of cyprus said in an interview from greek newspaper eleftherotipia , `` had turkey not intervened i not only would have declared enosis ( unification with greece ) but i would have annihilated the turks in cyprus . '', 
  so i 'd urge you to rethink the statements you 've made in your comment . 
  ** edit : ** i 'd also like to present my opinion about this issue : i 'm not only against withdrawal from northern cyprus , i 'd not vote or support any politician or political party supporting that idea . 
  ** edit 2 : ** getting downvoted for posting the truth and an actual quote ? 
  why , good job guys . 
  i 'd never guess people as ignorant as you could manage getting on the internet let alone post a semi-coherent comment . 
  well , damn me . 
  says some random dude from gibraltar of all places . 
  sure matey . 
  to `` you '' europeans ? 
  this guy ... 
  yea , that 's never going to happen . 
  considering majority of his people in and near turkey resort to terrorism in order to `` defend their rights '' , i 'm not terribly sorry about his `` abuse '' . 
  other countries mentioned are not the recipient of monthly , if not more often , terrorist attacks . 
  there is no question that pkk is a terrorist organization , and their support amongst almost all kurds in turkey leaves much to be desired when it comes to peace negotiations . 
  at the moment with everything going on in western turkey ( mostly ) ; my friends in eastern turkey fear for their lives , as the police there have been moved west and some people ( namely kurds ) have started publicly supporting pkk . 
  i 'm not happy to label people as terrorists based on their race , but that is what they rally behind themselves . 
  obviously not all turkish kurds are terrorists or terrorist supporters , but they really are in the minority . 
  [ this comment is a relatively good explanation of turkey 's strategy in general .

  islam is a religion . 
  so yes , literally a cult . 
  it 's more of a `` jerk '' or `` asshole '' rather than `` idiot '' . 
  on the other hand all my grandparents are alive , even my great-grandmother is alive and well . 
  for context , i 'm 20 . 
  i do n't watch tv much so i ca n't speak with personal knowledge , but it 's probably highly exaggerated and romanticized . 
  that sells better than history . 
  i knew our tv shows were popular in the middle east but did n't realize the cancer had already started spreading west .

  just a day ? 
  australia and new zealand as well , probably ... and south korea perhaps .

   actively engaged do you expect it to go something like `` oh yes good chaps , let our armies face off on this open field '' no , they 'll just keep up with shit like what happened in suruc and ankara . 
  he tried to punch the spanish pm , but it did n't knock him out like he expected . 
  it 's quite possibly one of the most boring places to live in . 
  germany might have better doner kebab , but against popular belief , that 's not the only kind of kebab . 
   he added that the `` necessary answer will be given in situations deemed to be a threat . '' people thought `` we 'll shoot down any aircraft invading our airspace from syria '' was an empty warning as well . 
  they were between 16-18 , which is technically `` child marriage '' since age of consent in turkey is 18 . 
  i 'm assuming if that was clear in the title , this would n't be a very popular article . 
  you ca n't fire me , i quit !,

  this is old , fake `` news '' . 
  anadolu agency released a statement saying it 's fabricated .
