it is not that simple . 
   the same flag of muhammed well ... 
  it 's the seal of prophet muhammed , not his flag and we never used the same flag . 
  i 've seen so many laden videos on the tv and internet and never heard him talking about that but what does he got anything to do with the isis ? 
  his own group is currently fighting the isis . 
  extremist/takfiri muslims consider anyone who prays at shrines and tombs `` infidels '' , so they definitely would hate ottoman emperors and i do n't really believe they all care about sieges and conquests of ottoman empire . 
  i did a quick `` ctrl + f '' and search the term `` reported '' in the article . 
  there is no official statement on any of their claims . 
  so , we do n't really know if the isis wants to bomb a neutral country , however i would n't be surprised if they wanted . 
  extremist groups , such as the isis , are not famous for making sense . 
  you absolutely have no idea what you are talking about . 
  vienna is not symbolic for muslims , it is for the ottoman empire . 
  the isis fan boys do n't even consider ottoman empire an islamic one . 
  ottoman emperors used to have their own tombs . 
  do you know what the isis is doing with tombs ? 
   it was n't `` their house '' . 
  it was ** literally ** their own house . 
  thousands of palestinians were expelled from their own houses . 
   if the arabs had accepted it instead of spending decades trying to destroy israel , the whole clusterfuck in the middle east could have been avoided . 
  you are not serious ... are you ? 
  would you give away your own house to a group of ultra-religious people because their god tells them it 's their own ? 
  i had to editorialize the title because ahmet davutoglu is not a well-known politician in europe . 
  i hope everyone will actually read the article before commenting on the issue . 
  `` the da\u011fl\u0131ca military guard post had been attacked with rocket-propelled grenades by the pkk for three days , and the turkish military airstrikes came after the last attack that took place on oct. 13 . 
  f-16 and f-4 jets flying from malatya and diyarbak\u0131r bombarded pkk positions in the da\u011fl\u0131ca district . '', 
  sure but your point is a separate issue . 
  there will be always some people who will try to use popular ideas as a tool to promote their own sick ideologies . 
  that means the title is pretty misleading . 
  this is like saying `` condemning israel is anti-semitic '' , which is completely wrong . 
  condeming the isis is not islamophobic at all . 
  [ the british muslim community has issued a fatwa condemning the isis and the uk jihadis ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/isis-terror-threat-leading-british-muslims-issue-fatwa-condemning-terror-group-9702042.html ), 
   if google does n't get everything wrong , apparently , it gets everything wrong . 
  the statement was not made by \u00d6calan . 
  actually selahattin demirtas ( leader of the kurdish party ) told the media that abdullah \u00d6calan is calling for dialogue . 
  ( edit : i believe \u00d6calan does n't give a damn about peace but that 's what their party leader said ) i 'm sorry for not finding any english article on these domestic issues but yeah , the pkk threatened turkey and an attack took place 4 days later . 
   after what is a very obvious false flag attack on one of his own posts the attack took place just four days after a branch of the pkk threatened turkey . 
  http://t24.com.tr/haber/taktan-saldiri-aciklamasi-kobane-yangin-yerine-cevrilmisken-turkiye-metropolleri-rahat-uyumayacak,273328 ( turkish article ) obvious false flag attack indeed . 
  if anyone wants to have some info on the photos used in this article : photo 1 : it 's flag of * tawheed * , even the if ( islamic front ) , a syrian rebel group which fights against the isis , use it . 
  so , it is not really a sign of isis support . 
  photo 2 : it 's the stamp of prophet mohammed . 
  it 's a historical item for all muslims , not only for the isis fanboys . 
  our support of daesh ? 
  we 've bombed deash inside syria way before the coalition forces ; http://english.alarabiya.net/en/news/middle-east/2014/01/30/turkish-army-strikes-isis-convoy-in-syria.html we 've also deported hundreds of potential daesh fighters ; http://www.haaretz.com/news/middle-east/1.615352, 
  you are welcome !, 
  we saved entire civilian population of kobani and left only ** ypg members ** to fight isis members . 
  far-right europeans , like yourself , freak out when entire europe get 3,000 refugees in a month but we 've received tens of thousands of refugees in few weeks !, 
  they attacked an office of k\u00f6y-der , which is a ngo related to h\u00fcda-par . 
  they killed four ngo members who were giving free meat to poor kurdish families in the region after eid al adha . 
  they 've also killed two completely random arab citizens on the same day . 
  they killed four kurdish ngo workers in this attack alone . 
  pkk supporters are gone completely crazy . 
  they started to target even openly anti-isis kurds , just because they do n't support pkk 's ideology . 
  one must also remember that the kurds are not one single political entity . 
  there are many armed kurdish groups with different ideologies and these guys are waiting for a reason to kill each other . 
  yesterday kurdish hezbollah and the pkk clashed in kurdish cities of turkey and 18 people died from both sides . 
  there are also armed islamist-kurdish groups in syria , then in northern iraq you have kdp-puk rivality which led them into a civil war in 1994 . http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iraqi_kurdish_civil_war all these armed groups will be fighting each other in order to control oil-rich kurdish regions in an independent kurdistan . 
  you should update your info on this issue . 
  this is not a simple turks vs kurds fight . 
  kurdish hezbollah and the pkk clashed all night long yesterday . 
  both sides suffered at least 12 casualties in total . 
  europeans tend to think that kurds are one single political entity but this is far from the reality . 
  the op presents no evidence about pro-isis people 's ethnicity . 
  we ca n't simply assume that they are turkish . 
  i hear them but they speak with a kurdish accent ( ambulans cagirin ) . 
  the video is a total mess , you ca n't even say which side is pro-isis and even your own fucking source does n't mention turks !, 
  he blames turks for the incident but his source says nothing about turks . 
   many others killed by turkish police by shooting at the prosters . 
  source ? 
   kurdish islamist who are pro-isis and the turkish state . 
  what the hell are you talking about ? 
  hudapar is islamist but anti-isis . 
  http://rudaw.net/turkish/kurdistan/100820143 ( the article is in turkish and from a kurdish website ), 
  turks ? 
  the guys in the video were speaking turkish with a heavy kurdish accent . 
  where the hell did you get the info that these are ** pro-isis turks ** ? 
   they all get free , instant citizenship if they come to sweden . 
  citizenship ? 
  really ? 
  or do you mean residence permit ? 
   they 're strengthening sunni iraq specifically to weaken the kurds . 
  what the hell ? 
  turkey supported the regional government in kurdistan against the sectarian government of baghdad in their oil deal . 
  assadists say we support al-nusra . 
  the isis says we support the fsa . 
  the pkk says we support the isis . 
  a bunch of tribal , nationalist and ultra-religious idiots are killing each other and since they can not blame their beloved leaders for any defeat , they blame turkey , the us , israel , etc. 
   do you know the stories behind the people that were attacked ? 
  i honestly did n't know that was a risk . 
  one of them was a guy from tajikistan . 
  he was returning home after morning prayers and got attacked by a group of white ( finnish ? ), 
  men at a railway station . 
  he did n't even know why they attacked and what they were saying while punching him because he was pretty new in finland and could n't speak the language . 
  another one was a guy from iraq . 
  he got attacked by three men . 
  they called him a nigger and accused him of ruining their country . 
  they had a knife and tried to stab him but he managed to run away . 
  finland is a peaceful country , the crime rate is very low and your average finnish jussi would never think of attacking a foreigner but every now and then you can hear stories like these ones . 
  i also would like to tell my story regarding the issue . 
  i would be lying if i say i 've never witnessed racism/xenophobia in europe . 
  i was called a terrorist , a fucking iraqi refugee and even a fucking jew by the locals ( apparently i look too middle-eastern ) but i 've never got physically attacked by anyone and been treated equally in all of my job interviews .
