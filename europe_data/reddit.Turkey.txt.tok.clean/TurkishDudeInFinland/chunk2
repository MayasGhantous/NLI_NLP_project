  these are the most important things for me . 
  however i also personally know muslims who witnessed both physical attacks in public and discrimination at work but i still believe europe is full of opportunities for those , who really try to educate themselves . 
  i studied my ass off for 15 months at different language courses in finland and passed the language exam for the citizenship . 
  it was n't too hard to find a job after that . 
  for sure my university degree has also helped me in this process but my other muslim friends , who lack a university degree also got different jobs after finishing a vocational school/course in finland . 
  now i 've got a stable job , i 'm minding my own business and ignoring occasional xenophobics . 
  i advise other non-european immigrants and muslims to do the same thing in europe . 
  the isis is not the only organization that recuits turkish nationals . 
  there are turkish nusayris in assad 's army , turkish nationalists in the fsa 's turkman brigades , turkish kurds in the ypg and pkk and turkish islamists in the isis and al-nusra . 
  our nationals have been a part of every goddamn organization in this war . 
  i 'm going to need a new username . 
  original title : christianity no longer a religion , says turkish minister i could n't see the sentence `` it 's a culture that threatens islam . '', 
  anywhere in the article . 
  they were late , so they should just sit and let ** more and more ** muslims join the isis , right ? 
  also , this is not their first attempt ; [ mosques launch campaign to stop uk syria fighters ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-28061173 ) and before this , there were a number of imams talking against the isis in their lectures and friday ceremonies . 
  since you said `` anyone '' , i 'll give you an off-topic example . 
  china has a border dispute with india , so they support pakistan against india . 
  you are not making any sense . 
  the word is not taksfir but * takfir * and one can not be a * takfir * but a * takfiri * and in order to be a * takfiri * , one must accuse another muslim of being a * kafir * . 
  now tell me , where and when did i do that ? 
  i do n't know if you are serious or just trying to be funny . 
  since you are using arabic words to sound like a smartass , can you please show me the definition of `` taksfir '' and your daleel from ahlus sunna and explain what makes me a `` taksfir '' . 
   muslims hate the west of course we do . 
  i got a degree in my home country , studied two different european languages , married a finnish woman , moved here ( finland ) , got a permanent job and am currently raising 3 kids in a multi-cultural environment where they speak 3 languages ( turkish , finnish and english ) on a daily basis . 
  why ? 
  because i hate the west . 
  there was also this ; [ mosques launch campaign to stop uk syria fighters ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-28061173 ) european muslims should be more active in denouncing the isis and the european media should pay them more attention . 
  unfortunately , a group of random men handing out pro-isis leaflets draws more media attention than a group of imams and scholars calling muslims to denounce isis-like organizations . 
  yes ? 
  i 'm just asking out of curiosity and not being sarcastic . 
  can you please provide some similar examples from `` most arab muslim embassies and consulates '' ? 
  i 'm not saying they do n't do it , but i really can not remember seeing any similar examples from the embassies and the consulates . 
   but a lot of people confuse `` jewish religion '' with `` israeli gov bot '' and that led to what you can currently see , sadly . 
   think of it like how the americans are hated in the middle east after ` stan/raq while most of them have totally nothing to do with it . 
  or how all muslims are blamed on sight by some us citizens for 09/11 . 
  this is what i always try to explain to fellow muslims when i hear them talking shit about all the jews simply because their government commits some war crimes . 
  i always remind them how we feel ashamed , misunderstood and misrepresented when we hear a group of terrorists committing war crimes in our name . 
  different ideologies , same bigotry . 
  just like the `` no jews allowed sing '' . 
  what makes this even worse is that the bigot is not just a random guy , but the embassy . 
   four of its journalists have been murdered . 
  wow . 
  is this information confirmed by the russian authorities or did the journalists `` commit suicide '' or suddenly disappeared according to them ? 
  `` judaism is a pox on europe '' thehairblairbunch _ ( 1940 ) can right-wingers stop calling / r/europe `` a liberal heaven '' after this guy 's post ended up with 15 upvotes in 9 hours ? 
  there were two different pro-palestinian protests in my city and i did n't participate to any of them , even though i 'm pro-palestinian . 
  now what ? 
  do n't i have right to protest anything else because `` i was not there when israels were killing palestinians '' you are not making any sense and you know it very well . 
  thanks for the answer !, 
  a question for ukrainian redditors : does the term `` ukraine/ukrainian rebels '' disturb you ? 
  here you go , some brave human right activists ( with hijabs and niqabs ) protesting the kidnapping of girls by boko haram and the ethnic cleansing of christians by isis in syria and iraq .

  satisfied ? 
  your suggestion also sounds reasonable but i 'm sure the autonomy option would get at least half of the votes in a three-option referendum . 
  of course these are all speculations and opinions . 
  my point was that the locals deserve a voice . 
   i do n't know any kurd , but many jews i know think that way . 
  they 're happy israel exists ( regardless of their opinions of the israeli government and israeli society ) , but they certainly do n't want to live there . 
  that really sounds like the way my kurdish friends talk about ** iraqi kurdistan ** . 
  i personally believe that most kurds want to have an autonomous region in turkey and independence is not a popular idea among them . 
  an official confirmation ( such as referendum results ) of this fact would make everything clear for next generations . 
  that 's a really hard question but i will tell you my personal opinion . 
  culturally , i am pro-unity . 
  i do n't want kurds and local christian minorities in eastern turkey to leave us . 
  even the leader of kurdish political party ( selahattin demirta\u015f ) says that what they want to have is an autonomous region , not an independent country . 
  imo there must be a referendum with at least three options ( status quo , autonomy and independence ) in eastern & southeastern turkey to put an end to this issue . 
  this is a win-win situation for the both sides . 
  the iraqi kurdistan government is both more friendly and more stable than the sectarian maliki government in baghdad . 
  the kurds are not fighting turkey anymore and i would n't want them to fight each other , either . 
  i just think that if you have a claim , you must prove it . 
  good . 
  turkey also helps iraqi kurdistan to sell their oil in the international market and mesut barzani visited turkey last year and encouraged the local kurds to support the current peace process . 
  edit : [ the iconic photo from barzani 's visit . 
   i can see the long game here , let iraqi kurdistan go , let them have syrian kurdish regions if they secure them . 
  nope . 
  the kurds are not one single entity with a common ideology and goal . 
  mesut barzani , the president of the iraqi kurdistan region , openly opposes the ypg in syria . 
  what the ... ? 
  if someone went to syria solely to get paid , that 's means he/she went to syria for money . 
  did you provide a link that i 've missed ? 
  because i still do n't see anyone going to syria for money . 
  there are more than two sides in syria and assad started all this madness by killing peaceful protesters . 
  isis and assad do n't really fight each other anymore . 
  they have a common and much weaker enemy , the moderate rebels . 
  btw there is no reason for western countries to help a 40 year old dictatorship that directly arms terrorist groups such as hezbollah . 
  some fighters told , on their personal twitter accounts , that they receive `` pocket money '' to do some basic shopping but i 'm sure all those foreign-fighters go there for ideological reasons . 
  i have n't heard of any of them going syria solely to get paid . 
   while a serious portion of them are going there for money and glory . 
  money ? 
  can you elaborate on this ? 
  i fully agree with the glory part but i do n't remember reading anything about the uk muslims going syria for money . 
   it 's like topconservativenews.com would be writing story about how far-left parties are crumbling vice may not be the best news source but is there any false information in the article ? 
  `` redditor for 43 minutes '' maybe you should get a job and contribute in your country 's economy , instead of creating reddit accounts to insult random people on internet . 
   youre being downvoted but you 're probably right . . well , there are some redditors with multiple accounts who call turks `` filthy '' , so getting downvoted is not a surprise for me . 
   you would be the second most populous country with a lot of say unless they gimp the current system i strongly believe that our population is the main concern of most european politicians and i ca n't really blame them for this . 
  you are right but it 's possible to improve democracy and human rights in a country , however decreasing population is not an easy issue . 
  except turkey . 
  our population is larger than all other candidate countries combined and that 's the real reason why we will never be a member of the eu . 
  we , the turks , all know it . 
   polish neo-nazi make less sense than jewish neo nazi . 
  neo-nazis are not famous for making sense .
