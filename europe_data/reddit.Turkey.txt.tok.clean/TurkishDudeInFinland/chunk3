  hi / u/neutrolgreek, 
  just to spread the info , duolingo is preparing an irish course and it 's 85 % done . 
   famous ? 
  less known ? 
  he is a completely unknown figure to most turks . 
   do u mean he wont win ? 
  imo he does n't stand a chance against the akp . 
  some kemalist members of the main opposition party have already started to question his candidacy . 
  he is conservative but more moderate than erdogan and he is n't famous at all . 
  relevant post from / r/todayilearned [ til due to name confusion , staff of the slovak and slovenian embassies meet once a month to exchange wrongly addressed mail ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1pulwy/til_due_to_name_confusion_staff_of_the_slovak_and/ ), 
  now it 's also confirmed by ukrainian officials . 
  [ ukrainian prosecutors confirm death of 49 troops aboard plane shot down in luhansk ] ( http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/ukrainian-prosecutors-confirm-death-of-49-troops-aboard-plane-shot-down-in-luhansk-351845.html ), 
   in 50 years a full 110 % of germans between 0 and 14 years will be muslim . 
  you forgot the part where we will force christians to eat kebab on christmas . 
  you clueless liberals !, 
   that 's called `` getting people not to integrate themselves '' around here . 
  learning german as the first language is the number one thing germans demand from immigrants so that they can integrate themselves . 
  to directly oppose that demand is directly opposing turkish integration in german society . 
  i read the quotes , i dont ' agree with all of them but i still think this is not exactly calling people not to integrate themselves into german society but anyways , thanks for the links and the translation !, 
  no , unfortunately i do n't . 
  can you copy-paste the part where he said `` should n't try to ** integrate ** themselves into german society . '' ? 
  i 'm not saying you are lying but i just do n't see that part in deutsche welle 's website . 
   should n't try to integrate themselves into german society . 
  can you please provide source for this ? 
  http://www.dw.de/asimilasyona-hay%c4%b1r/a-17660423 according to deutsche welle 's turkish website , erdogan said that the turks should keep their religion , language and culture alive but they also should learn german language very well and integrate into german society without assimilating . 
  edit : downvotes for asking for a source ? 
  here you go  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7k6s_9xsps, 
  thanks for the links !, 
  mehmed the conqueror . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fatih_sultan_mehmed edit : i recommend everyone to check out his `` ahidname '' . 
  he issued it to the catholic monks after the conquest of bosnia . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ahidn%c3%a2me afaik some bosnian churches still have copies of this ahidname on their walls . 
  nowadays most simit-sellers use [ these things ] ( http://aktuelresim.com/resim/simit%c3%a7i_pazarlayamadiklarimizdan_misiniz__simit%c3%a7i_crm_uygularsa.jpg ) but i hope you can see one of the traditional ones during your visit . 
  we call them `` simit '' in turkey . 
  here is the wiki article for you : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/simit, 
  this reminds me our traditional simit-sellers in turkey . 
  please do n't get me wrong , i 'm not blaming you for what your country did some 100 years ago but it was the british empire that left arabian peninsula to the wahhabis . 
  that 's a fact . 
  reading the article i made a connection between the headline and the part where it says `` crimea was , is , and will be ukrainian soil '' but on a second thought , i think you are right . 
  he basically states that he will not recognize the invasion but there is no mention of retaking crimea . 
  they do n't `` enter '' anywhere . 
  isis is the biggest player in extremism since they stole all their fanbase from the aq . 
  they are simply ex-aq sympathizers who got more excited with the idea of a state . 
  of course the presence of isis is worrying not only in europe but anywhere else in the world . 
  they are as worrying as the golden dawn supporters who go around and stab people to death , or armed neo-nazis who blow up pipe-bombs at turkish markets and gun down turkish immigrants . 
  all those radicals are a minority in their own communities but yeah , they are still worrying and that 's why the authorities must monitor their activities closely . 
  thank you for not standing behind your false claims anymore . 
  this is reddit , you know . 
  we do n't have to turn everything into a dick waving contest . 
  oh come on . 
  why do you guys always do this ? 
  you had a claim and i asked for a source . 
  now you are just playing with the words and not providing any source . 
  yeah , they called him a frenchman because he is a french citizen but they also stated that he allegedly had ties with some islamists in syria and his motivation was anti-semitism . 
  source ? 
  also , that depends on your definition of `` extremist '' . 
  if a muslim goes overseas and kills civilians , everyone would call him an extremist but when a non-muslim goes overseas and kills civilians , everyone calls him a veteran . 
  if anyone is looking for a proof that the number of extremists in the european muslim community is incredibly low , here go you , you have got one . 
  they organize a protest in one of the biggest cities of belgium and how many supporters they have got ? 
  approx . 
  however this does n't mean we should ignore them . 
  the european authorities must keep an eye on those idiots and promote other muslim organizations which fight their extremist ideas . 
  there are hundreds of mosques all around europe and they organize `` open door days '' for non-muslims , they invite non-muslims to their `` iftar dinners '' in ramadan , they focus especially on young people , so that they do n't get involved with `` gangsta '' or extremist groups etc. 
  they are the most effective `` tool '' the european have got against the extremists . 
  you see . 
  you have exactly the same mentality as the people you 're complaining about . 
   it may surprise you but radical islamic political groups are usually classified on the far right ~ ~ here . ~ ~ ** everywhere . 
  ** ftfy, 
   many people seem to defend massive muslim immigration to europe from mena . 
  nobody supports `` massive muslim immigration '' . 
  just because someone opposed your idea of shooting at refugees does n't mean they support massive muslim immigration . 
  wow . 
  i spent my entire education life in the mediterranean sea region and religion classes were always seen as `` easy credit source '' where almost everyone got full points ( 5 ) and teacher never got deep in the religion . 
  you are welcome . 
  most alevis consider themselves muslims but there is a tiny alevi minority who claims that alevism does n't belong to islam and is a separate religion . 
  addition : turkish religious education focuses on sunni islam and that is one of the main reasons why some alevis dislike it . 
  ** turkey ** yes . 
  1 hour per week . 
  it was super easy . 
  we had to memorize few very short parts from the quran , learn basic islamic rules such as how to clean ourselves before praying and how to pray . 
  i remember we also had information about other religions in our book but i do n't remember ever studying them in the classroom . 
  you do n't have to attend those classes if our parents write an official letter to the school administration but probably 99.99 % of students attend them . 
  i remember reading news about an alevi family who excluded their kids from those classes . 
  number 2 , because turkey is not ready to give up northern cyprus ( for the record , i am all for a united cyprus ) number 3 , because our population is just too big for the eu . 
  number 4 , because turkish people lost their interest in the eu . 
  as i 've said couple times here on / r/europe , the turks do not talk about the eu anymore , our accession process to the eu is considered a joke among turkish people . 
  if armenia really joins the eurasian union , we can stop talking about the potential membership of turkey and azerbaijan because that would never happen . 
  putin and his partners would choose azerbaijan and turkey over armenia . 
  joining the glorious and stronk eurasian union !, 
  well , the annexation of the northern cyprus was just a joke but the turks are very aware of the reality that we will never be a member of the eu and the third biggest party ( the nationalist mhp ) still consider the central asian countries as `` our turkish brothers '' , so i believe that the decision of joining the eurasian union would face very little criticism in turkey . 
  i also would like to hear other turkish redditors ' ideas . 
  do you guys think anyone , except the chp ( the second biggest party ) , would oppose this decision ? 
  since the dear leader erdo\u011fan has gone completely insane after the betrayal of g\u00fclen 's cemaat ( their biggest ally ) i expect him to annex northern cyprus and join this union instead of the eu . 
  turkish - german flag somalian - finnish flag arabic - french flag, 
  i have n't watched it yet but the movie 's imdb page gives me a good impression . 
  you are welcome . 
  i 've noticed that since most kurdish political activists in europe are communist , europeans tend to think that the kurds are more or less a politically homogenous group but that 's far from reality . 
  there are some kurds sympathetic to armenians but that really depends because the kurds are extremely polarized by their religious and ideological backgrounds and have fought each other in most parts of the historical region of kurdistan . 
  e.g kurdish hizbullah vs the pkk in 90 's turkey and talabani vs. barzani in 90 's iraq .
