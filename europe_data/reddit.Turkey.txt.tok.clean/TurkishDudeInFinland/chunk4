  just to give the full picture of events : pro-erdogan crowd in the same city on the same day https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10152202854138577.1073742322.344704883576&amp;type=3, 
  i 'm sure the turks are actually minority in this crowd . 
  as a turk , i do n't really know a lot of turks who would wave pkk , abdullah \u00d6calan , assad and armenian flags . 
   the turks only have been supportive in this on the iraqi kurds because of money , and you are surprised ? 
  this is how the international relations work . 
   meanwhile in syria the turks are actively supporting the rebels that fight against the ypg ( syrian kurds ) there . 
  the ypg is not the only armed kurdish group in syria . 
  there is also a kurdish group in the fsa and another one in the if . 
  turkey openly opposes the ypg , so does one of the most influential kurdish leader , mesud barzani . 
   is this a good step for the kurds ? 
  of course it is a good step for the kurds . 
  they 've been trying to gain a greater autonomy from the failed central government of baghdad and the turks have been pretty supportive of this so far . 
  thanks man !, 
  i guess that would be a `` churros con griotten '' . 
  i do n't understand why we were not taught any of these things at school . 
  our history lessons were like a `` dick measuring contest '' , they taught us everything about the fall of constantinople , the siege of vienna but almost nothing about the most recent military victory . 
  looks like we occupied the wrong part of cyprus . 
  this reminds me how their leader nigel farage helped a german immigrant steal a british job !, 
  [ ukip leader nigel farage defends employing german wife , at launch of anti-immigration poster campaign ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/ukip-leader-nigel-farage-defends-employing-german-wife-at-launch-of-antiimmigration-poster-campaign-9275453.html ), 
  actually they are given two options . 
  either the package or 140 euros ( for 2014 ) . 
  so if you expect your second baby who will use the same clothes as his/her older sibling , you can choose the money . 
  in case anyone wonders what the package contains : http://www.kela.fi/web/en/maternitypackage, 
   i really do n't understand why the turks claim to be european . 
  is being asian not good enough for them ? 
  i really do n't understand why the europeans think that the turks claim to be european . 
  turks claim to be turks and as a turk , i 've never met a turk who claims all turks to be 100 % european , we are partly european and partly asian because our country is in the middle of europe and asia . 
  turkey is culturally , geographically and historically ** a part ** of europe . 
  your denial will not change anything . 
  according to the turkish media , there were 787 miners inside the mine at the time of the accident, 
   that is what the separatist leader stated , the death toll has risen from 6 to 8 on bbc so i expect it to rise much higher as more information comes out . 
  then you should have linked to the separatist source because your own source contradicts with your own title . 
  addition to the map : ** turkey ** : [ grey wolves ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/mhp_flag.svg ) ** bulgaria ** : [ \u0410\u0442\u0430\u043a\u0430 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a3/ataka_logo_transparent.png ) ** cyprus ** : [ eoka ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/cd/eoka.jpg ) feel free to correct me if i 'm mistaken . 
   so that 's why foreigners do n't wan na move to turkey ?!, 
  ich kann nicht verstehen no man , i count them as `` foreigners who want to move to turkey '' . 
   can you blame them ? 
  nope . 
  this is so normal . 
  people want better life standards , better paying jobs , etc. 
  that 's also why eastern europeans move to western and northern european countries . 
  i do n't blame the neighbours . 
  i just reminded him that there are thousands of potential refugees just on the other side of our borders . 
  i ca n't really blame tayyip , either . 
  put any other politician to the office , still most young people would prefer to move to the eu because of the eu 's reputation among turkish people . 
  we all `` know '' that the eu is the land of easy white women , kebab restaurant owner millionaires and endless social welfare benefits !, 
   also virtually no one wants to move to lithuania , romania , bulgaria , croatia , turkey and finland . 
  turkey has some pretty fucked up neighbors such as syria , iraq and iran . 
  just saying . 
  oh and til virtually no one wants to move to finland . 
  translation of his tweet : '' [ link to his article ] close it my master ** k ** . 
  please write your comments ( * another typo here * ) under the article . '', 
  amk stands for `` am\u0131na koyim '' in turkish internet slang and means `` fuck your pussy '' . 
  says the guy who thought the iraqi army was sunni , lol . 
  yeah , you are an expert on the mena , no doubt about that . 
  i am not going to waste my time with a famous bullshitter . 
  you do n't even know the basic facts about major groups like if and srf . 
  they have financial support from some saudis , but most saudi fighters join either to isis or nusra . 
  if and srf are predominantly syrians groups . 
   the fact that 75 % of the rebels are not even syrian . 
  is this your sickness ? 
  why the hell do you exaggerate everything and not provide source for your ridiculous claims ? 
  only isis and al-nusra have significant number of foreign fighters . 
  even if you count them as 100 % foreign , still the islamic front ( one of the biggest faction among the rebels ) have 3 times more fighters than nusra and few of them are foreigners . 
  srf has almost the same amount of fighters as al-nusra and most of them are syrians . 
  percentage of foreign fighters is nowhere near 75 , even if you count both isis and al-nusra as 100 % foreigners but both isis and al-nusra have syrians fighters . 
  we 've an upcoming presidential election and this statement will cost him a lot of nationalist votes . 
  he does n't really need any international support for his next goal , the presidential seat . 
  probably this is not really what you are asking for but still an important step : http://www.dailysabah.com/politics/2014/04/24/erdogan-becomes-first-pm-to-share-in-armenians-pain `` pm erdo\u011fan extends his condolences to the grandchildren of armenians who were victims in 1915 together with other ottoman citizens in an unprecedented statement released on the prime ministry website in nine languages '', 
   my own turk great-great-grandfather adopted a little armenian girl when they were on their way to syria ( i assume ) wow , i guess a lot of us have similar stories . 
  my great-grandfather also adopted an armenian girl and married to an armenian woman ( she was not his first wife ) . 
  have you even read the article yet ? 
   it is indisputable that the last years of the ottoman empire were a difficult period , full of suffering for turkish , kurdish , arab , armenian ** and millions of other ottoman citizens , regardless of their religion or ethnic origin . 
  i know a lot of people will question his sincerity but we should focus on his title ( the pm ) instead of his name because this statement is a huge step . 
  he has already faced criticism for this statement in turkey . 
  yeah , it is different because she is not `` eastern european white '' , she is `` real european white '' . 
  this is the second times this guy dies and again , he did n't really die ( according to german isis sources ) http://justpaste.it/f72u they claim that it was another guy who uses the same kunya ( abu talha al-almani ) died in the attack . 
  why did you editorialize the title ? 
  the original title : `` greek coast guard shoot suspected smuggler off kos coast '' from the article : a man , ** possibly a turkish smuggler ** , died after gunfire from the greek coast guard , who were chasing the speedboat he was piloting tuesday off the psalidi coast in kos , greece . 
   i operate in europe and i do things in europe . 
  just this other day i had to pay a bill larger than $ 4k . 
  where 's my news story ?? 
  apparently you are not as important as a jewish organization for the media . 
  if you really think that the article is not related to europe , you should hit the `` report '' button and let the mods hear your opinion . 
  the organisations mentioned in the article operate in europe and one of them is fined by a european court . 
  that sounds pretty relevant to me . 
   he was trying to show you by example why , when someone claim something , he has to prove the veracity of it , it 's not up to others to prove what he says is wrong . 
  i got your point but my source gives a direct link to the judiciary report , which proves the veracity of the article . 
  it is not a baseless claim . 
  i also provided multiple sources when i was asked to do so . 
  i do n't speak french so unfortunately i could n't check it from french sources but there is a link from a french website in the article . 
  wtf , man ? 
  it 's like i did something terribly wrong . 
  of course i could provide multiple sources but i did n't know i had to do it because most threads on / r/europe include only one source . 
  some other sources : [ french jewish group fined for defamation ] ( http://jewishtimes.com/21626/french-jewish-group-fined-for-defamation/#.u0vp1fkqnhu ) - ** jewish times ** [ french jewish group fined for defaming pro-palestinian charity ] ( http://www.timesofisrael.com/french-jewish-group-fined-for-defaming-pro-palestinian-charity/ ) - ** the times of israel ** [ french jewish group crif fined for defaming pro-palestinian charity ] ( http://www.jta.org/2014/04/08/news-opinion/world/french-jewish-group-fined-for-defaming-pro-palestinian-charity#ixzz2yrvhpb7m ) - ** the global jewish news source ** p.s first two comments have questioned the reliability of the source edit : downvotes for providing more sources ? 
  you just could google the title and check if they are lying . 
  [ french jewish group fined for defamation ] ( http://jewishtimes.com/21626/french-jewish-group-fined-for-defamation/#.u0vp1fkqnhu ) - ** jewish times ** [ french jewish group fined for defaming pro-palestinian charity ] ( http://www.timesofisrael.com/french-jewish-group-fined-for-defaming-pro-palestinian-charity/ ) - ** the times of israel ** [ french jewish group crif fined for defaming pro-palestinian charity ] ( http://www.jta.org/2014/04/08/news-opinion/world/french-jewish-group-fined-for-defaming-pro-palestinian-charity#ixzz2yrvhpb7m ) - ** the global jewish news source **, 
  let 's assume you are right . 
  what does your statement have to do with the thread ? 
  btw : http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/kurdish-inhabited_area_by_cia_%281992%29.jpg i 'm all for kurdish rights and the unity of my country but yeah , the highlighted area in the map belongs to the kurds . 
  you are free to prove that they are lying .
