   redditor for 36 minutes obvious troll is obvious troll . 
  that 's the best thing to do both for the eu and turkey . 
  the accession process is considered a joke in turkey . 
  no one talks about it , no one believes in it . 
  turkey is surprisingly uninterested in the recent developments in cyprus . 
  i 'm not sure what 's the reason behind this . 
  either the media does n't believe the unification stories anymore or they are too busy following the intense political battle in turkey . 
  i actually did n't mean you guys should be offended . 
  my reference was the recent `` anti-gay propaganda law '' in russia but probably i was not being clear enough . 
  bad luck sweden : / r/europe becomes russia gets the pride flag, 
  check your calendar !, 
  i did n't know our brothers took over portugal !, 
  look at that beautiful flag !, 
  he asked the difference between the mhp and the akp . 
  i was not even talking about the chp . 
  actually the akp had 38 % of the votes in the last local elections . 
  afaik those `` revolutionary '' and `` socialist '' names are mostly symbolic but i personally do n't know any real liberal alternative than the hdp . 
  they are both right wing parties . 
  mhp is a nationalist party and some of their supports are mad at the akp because of their negotiations with the kurdish rebels . 
  you just described [ the hdp . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peoples%27_democratic_party ) their istanbul candidate [ s\u0131rr\u0131 s\u00fcreyya \u00d6nder ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/s%c4%b1rr%c4%b1_s%c3%bcreyya_%c3%96nder ) is one of my favorite politicians in turkey . 
   i agree that it is n't that simple , i was simplifying for him . 
  i said `` perhaps '' to indicate that such a coalition is a hypothetical yeah man , i did n't say you are completely wrong , i was trying to elaborate more on the issue   without a lowering of the baraj/10 % threshold , it is probably not going to happen . 
  agreed 100 %, 
   together the chp and the mhp could perhaps form a coalition , but that would mean one of them winning a plurality of the vote ( beating akp ) in order attempt form parliament first . 
  not that simple . 
  as 1:22 am , the akp got 45.8 % and chp+mhp got 43.9 % . 
  if both opposition parties form a coalition , the chp would lose a lot of alevi votes to other smaller leftist parties and the mhp would lose a lot of turk-islamists votes to the akp . 
   how is it that no decent liberal/secular opposition party has come forward ? 
  there are actually some new liberal/secular parties , the most recent one is hdp , but they are too small to gain an influence on turkish politics even thought they have ex-mps as their candidates . 
  chp supporters hate new leftist parties more than they hate akp because according to them chp is the only `` real '' leftists/liberal/secular party and all other leftists parties steal chp 's votes and help akp in long-term . 
  for anyone wondering why the main opposition ( chp ) is so miserable in turkey ; their supporters chanted `` our blood , our soul , we sacrifice for ** assad ** '' ( yes , you heard right , the well-known baathists chant of saddam ) in hatay . 
  their ankara candidate was a well-known nationalist politician from the other opposition party . 
  eventually they even lost in the hometown of their leader ( kilicdaroglu ) because they are alawite and hate the nationalist party . 
  ** addition : ** one of their mps openly stated that kurds can not be equal to turks . 
  their istanbul candidate was an ex-member who was expelled from the party for his alleged illegal activities . 
  ** imo ** most people vote akp because they have no other alternatives and do n't want to see chp running the country . 
   in fact , a saying developed in hungary : '' ... will happen as soon as metro 4 opens . '', 
  basically it 's a saying for something incredibly unlikely . 
  that sounds like our accession to the eu . 
  when we talk about something that is impossible to happen , we say `` yeah , that will happen when turkey joins the eu '', 
  you know there is something fucked up with your group when ** even al-qaeda ** disowns you . 
  the guys are from isis . 
  pro-revolution syrians do n't want them , either . 
   just wondering : they do understand that youtube works for everyone else in the world when they block it , right ? 
  right ?!, 
  they do understand but they do n't care because you are not going to vote in the local elections . 
  erdogan has gone insane after his split with gulen and he does n't really care anything except the upcoming local and presidential elections . 
  yeah , the guy who banned ** turkish folk music ** on radio ( you know , he was trying to `` westernize '' turkey ) would be rolling in his grave because of censorship . 
  come on , guys . 
  we all know that the ban on twitter and youtube is completely insane but let 's do n't involve kemal in this . 
   serbs did n't do anything wrong . 
  the sad thing is you are not even trolling , this is really what you believe in . 
   you can portray anywhere in a negative light very easily , especially for a place like russia where people already have prejudices . 
  i agree with you but that does n't mean that we should turn a blind eye to the troublemakers , especially to the russian neo-nazis when they constantly attack and kill vulnerable people . 
  btw no one labels all the russians or majority of russian as `` neo-nazis '' here . 
   no they dont . 
  thank you for confirming that you have n't even watched the god damn video . 
  sure but russian neo-nazis are a bit different . 
  as you can see in the video , these guys are heavily armed , they have training camps in the country and they hunt non-slavic looking people down in daylight . 
  european neo-nazis are not as violent as the russian ones . 
  not quite recent but relevant ; from russia with hate ( documentary ) [ part1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aluxuq-e9ya ) [ part2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuovgx3zh6e ), 
  that 's your opinion , which has no legislative power . 
   ** i think ** mutilation and child cruelty is heinous enough . 
  this is not how it works . 
  we can not just deport people because you or i think it is right thing to do it . 
  we have a law and according to do it , you can not deport a foreigner because they circumcise their boys . 
  also , it is not only the foreigners who practice circumcision , there are also non-israeli , european jews and converted european muslims . 
   deporting people who do not comply with local laws and culture  boom , entry barred for life too bad these things are going to happen only in your wet dreams . 
  most jews and muslims have got all the legal papers and are free to choose where they want to live and what culture they want to practice and you have absolutely no power to change this . 
  deal with it . 
   why should norwegian doctors be mandated to do cultural and religious modifications on a person who is n't able to give its opinion on the subject yet ? 
  no one says norwegian doctors should be mandated to circumcise kids , no one . 
  what they say is if a doctor is willing to practice circumcision , then they should be allowed to do so . 
  of course , not in a cave with a kitchen knife but at a hospital with all the necessary medical tools and hygienic standards . 
   let them do it somewhere else then , let them take that chance on their own child . 
  let me be honest with you . 
  first of all , i believe that the jews will not let this happen , but even if you guys ban the circumcision i 'm perfectly fine with it . 
  there will be a lot of jews and muslims who will see this as a business opportunity and will arrange `` circumcision trips '' to countries like israel and turkey . 
  jews and muslims will have their boys circumcised anyways . 
  there will be just other jews and muslims making money on this and i do n't really see a problem with it . 
  i think this is a very unnecessary move . 
  i mean what 's the intention ? 
  saving the toddlers ? 
  if that 's the case , then banning circumcision is not really a solution , because the jews and muslims will practice circumcision anyways . 
  you ca n't stop it ( sorry guys , but i 'm just trying to be dead serious here ) . 
  if you make circumcision legal , then they will do it at your hospitals and will pay your doctors . 
  if you ban it , then they will do it back in their home countries during a vacation . 
  the only thing you can gain with this ban is a `` circumcision tourism '' . 
  do you mind to explain ? 
  maybe it actually had but the op corrected the mistake ? 
  the guy claimed that turkey did not invade cyprus to protect turkish minority and was not sanctioned and i say he is wrong and the situation in cyprus was completely different . 
  russian minority in ukraine has faced no real threat but on the other hand series of ethnic clashes took place in cyprus and there was no euromaidan-like popular uprising but a military coup in cyprus before the invasion . 
  however invading cyprus was a stupid move and i am not defending it . 
   turkey did not invade n cyprus to protect turkish minority on cyprus what ? 
  turkey actually says that it invaded cyprus to protect turkish minority and bring peace to the island after the military coup . 
  turkey even calls the invasion `` a peace operation '' . 
   yet turkey was not placed under sanctions what ? 
  ( x2 ) from the wiki article : `` among ** a variety of sanctions against turkey ** , in mid-1975 the us congress imposed an arms embargo on turkey for using american-supplied equipment during the turkish invasion of cyprus in 1974 '', 
  and [ these guys ] ( http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/73371000/jpg/_73371813_d76f9f65-5080-46b5-b739-38e71138af62.jpg ) are just civilian self-defense units with home-made weaponry and have absolutely no connection with the russian military .
