  it 's not because they are smarter but because most european immigrants think `` well , everyone speaks english here , why would i even bother myself to learn finnish ? '' . 
  especially if they 've already got a job where they do n't have to speak finnish . 
  i personally know only one refugee who moved from finland to sweden and it was a christian iranian girl who passed the language exam for finnish citizenship but could n't find a job here . 
  cyprus is the third ? 
  wow , that was the biggest surprise for me . 
  congrats on neighbors . 
  are they still doing that well ? 
  yeah but they declared muslim brotherhood , the party which won the previous elections a terrorist organization . 
  egyptian military is really gone mad . 
  they are jailing anyone that opposes them , even secular pro-democracy activists . 
  100 % agreed . 
  i was just talking about the current situation . 
  party `` yes '' for libya , tunisia and yemen . 
  definitely `` no '' for egypt . 
  ( they had a `` democratic military coup '' last year ) definitely `` hell no fucking shit '' for syria . 
  apparently self-immolation does n't really work that well . 
   my morning tee a finn who prefers tea over [ coffee ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_coffee_consumption_per_capita ) ? 
  welcome to the brotherhood !, 
  he forgot kosovo . 
  from the artcile : `` a wave of attacks around the capital followed , with an ** iraqi-bulgarian ** attacked in a shopping mall , a ** malian boy ** beaten by a mob and a ** cameroonian mother and child ** assaulted by a group of neo-nazis . '', 
  according to the article they do n't attack only refugees or foreigners but also bulgarian citizens who have an immigrant background . 
  bulgarian ataka is a well-known group and they have been attacking members of turkish minority for years . 
  looks like they just found an easier target this time . 
   and even more , why does this article talk like we have to provide goods and shelter ? 
  and i do n't just mean bulgaria . 
  because it is a humanitarian mission . 
  those people are civilians who were minding their own fucking business at the time of peace but a bloody civil-war broke out in their country and now they are just looking for a safe place . 
  if someone among them commits a crime then punish him but do n't blame hundreds of refugees for that . 
  he is definitely making turkey more islamic and conservative but i do n't think he is really an enemy of the secular state . 
  his previous ideology was `` milli g\u00f6r\u00fc\u015f '' and at that time he openly opposed secularism , but it has been more than 10 years when he and all reformists politicians of `` milli g\u00f6r\u00fc\u015f '' left the `` hardcore islamist party '' and formed center-right akp . 
  he is really somewhere in between . 
  it 's important to show that we really try to improve our relations with the eu countries but i think we could have spent that money on something that has a better future than eu-turkey relations . 
  the eu is a wonderful idea and admired by most of our people but we know we are n't welcomed in the union . 
  he was a relatively young minister and knew how to use social media , i think that 's why he is mentioned very often in western media , not because he has done something very exceptional . 
   but the opposition is also fucked . 
  that 's one of the biggest reasons why akp is so strong and won half of the votes . 
   so far it seems who ever wins the elections wo n't bring anything to this nation . 
  some members of chp , the second biggest political party in turkey , held a meeting with high-ranking `` hizmet '' figures in their last visit to the us . 
  i think they are just trying to be the new favorite party of g\u00fclen movement . 
  i think we are a part of europe and european history but we 've population of almost 80 million people and that scares europeans more than our culture and religion . 
  that 's why i think we will never be a part of the union . 
  beside that , i am yet to meet a turk who believes that we will eventually join the eu , well , except our ex-eu minister egemen ba\u011f\u0131\u015f . 
   i do n't buy for a second that this is done for the good of the state i do n't believe it , either . 
  he called the same policemen heroes in gezi protests . 
  g\u00fclen is erdogan 's only serious opponent and he 's trying to clean police forces from g\u00fclen 's men . 
  that 's what 's happening in turkey right now . 
   btw your flair is brilliant . 
  thank you , 
  even though i strongly believe that some akp members are involved in corruption , we talk about 350 policemen who are more loyal to a preacher than to their country . 
  they 've no place in turkish security forces . 
  turkey will never be a part of the eu and we all know it . 
  end of the story . 
   helped ~ ~ germans ~ ~ ** non-romani , non-jew , non-religious minority , non-ethnic minority , non-communist , non-disabled and pro-nazi germans ** experience some of the highest quality of life on earth, 
  i 've always wondered what if something went wrong and the test ended up killing everyone on board ? 
  [ keep 'em out !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqqvuxbnfl4 ) on a more serious note , since europe is not a person , you will hear a lot of different opinions and they would vary between regions . 
  for example , in baltics you can notice a big hatred towards russians but in ** my ** opinion , most europeans are ok with immigrants if they do n't get involved in criminal activities and really try to make a living on their own , instead of milking the social welfare system . 
  conservative party akp is currently having a political civil war . 
  g\u00fclen movement was the biggest ally of the current government in their fight against kemalists . 
  in last 10 years , akp and g\u00fclen movement managed to clear all high-ranking positions from kemalists and replace them with their own men . 
  some of these men were more loyal to akp than g\u00fclen movement and vice-versa . 
  once they realized that the kemalist threat is gone , they started fighting for the absolute control on the country 's institutions . 
  one of the biggest differences between gezi protests and this one is the number of protesters . 
  gezi was literally 50 % of turkish voters , who did n't vote akp showing their anger to the current government but the scale of protests is much much smaller in this one . 
  because even though most gezi protesters want to see akp gone , they really do n't want to see a stronger g\u00fclen movement controlling the next government . 
  g\u00fclen movement has a significant number of men in police forces . 
  they revealed akp 's secret trade deals with iran and then akp supporters started to boycott companies , newspapers and tv channels of g\u00fclen movement , so they really crushed in istanbul stock market . 
  i personally see two possible outcomes from this conflict . 
  either akp will keep its votes over 40 % and will become the absolute political power in turkey , ( because everyone expect a fall in their votes after gezi protests and `` the political civil war '' ) or akp will lose a significant percent of their votes and g\u00fclen movement will become one of the biggest political powers in turkey and all the other major parties ( secularist chp and nationalist mhp ) will try to be the favorite political party of the movement . 
  are you fucking serious ? 
  cyprus witnessed ethnic clashes , a military coup and a fucking war in 1974 . 
  how can you compare it to the situation in your country ? 
  i guess they are in slovakia to live freely , because they have never been suspected nor accused of terrorism . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-25558891 ), 
  here is another article , this one is from bbc : http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-25558891 `` as in the case of the first transport , the persons in this transport ** have never been suspected nor accused of terrorism ** . 
  the transport is a follow-up to the agreement of 2009 [ with the us ] , '' the slovak ministry statement said . '', 
  i personally think that turkey could be a better option for these people , since we speak a related language and share a common culture . 
  [ irish ] ( http://weknowmemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/they-keep-calling-me-drunk-im-just-irish.jpg ), 
  i think invasion and oppression effect people more than any religion . 
  they see their relatives getting killed and their countries being destroyed and eventually they want revenge . 
  they do n't really need any religion after witnessing unjustice . 
  soon there will be revenge attacks on muslims in russia . 
  why ? 
  because a muslim killed some russians somewhere in russia . 
  why did that muslim killed some russians ? 
  because some russians killed some of his/her people . 
  why did some russians kill some of his/her people ? ... 
  this would just go on and on . 
  i believe injustice is the source of all our problems . 
  you know how to have fun , do n't you ? 
  would you also like to gamble on `` which country 's civilians will be the next victims of drones ? '', 
  i will be honest with you . 
  i was thinking of anna politkovskaya when i wrote that , i am sorry if i could n't choose my words more wisely , but i think you are not going deny the fact that people are killed for only opposing the government in russia . 
  you can find a lot of examples in that wiki article . 
  i 'm not denying this fact . 
  i just do n't like when people focus on one thing and ignore all the other aspects and factors of a problem . 
  here you go : http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_rights_in_russia, 
   most terrorist are religious fundamentalist . 
  that really depends on your definition of terrorism . 
  is it terrorism if a bunch of muslims attack a wedding convoy in usa ?
