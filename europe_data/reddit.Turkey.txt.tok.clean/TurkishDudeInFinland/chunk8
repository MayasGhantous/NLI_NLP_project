  yes !, 
  no doubt !, 
  we all agree on that , right ? 
  now , let 's remember what happened in yemen recently . 
  american drones bombed a wedding convoy in yemen and killed many civilians . 
  is this terrorism ? 
  it should be , but it is not , according to the media . 
  i do n't see anyone calling the drone operator a terrorist . 
  please do n't misunderstand me . 
  i am not defending any kind of terrorism but i deeply feel that most people in western world - maybe unintentionally - do n't respect the murdered when the murderer is one of `` them '' . 
  or a misguided muslim who lived in a country where the number of human right violations is sky high and any vulnerable person who openly opposes the regime suddenly disappears . 
  is there anything that justifies her action ? 
  she did n't have right to hurt civilians . 
  what she did is wrong , horrible and must be condemned . 
   it 's not that simple . 
  exactly . 
  that was my point . 
  your first reply was just one word , `` religion '' . 
  it 's not that simple . 
  thank you for the link . 
   ** he allegedly said . 
  ** your telegraph link gives the source as `` al monitor '' and al monitor says the original article is from as-safir newspaper and as-safir 's english section is translated by al monitor . 
  the article in al monitor says the claim is from `` a report '' but there is no link to any report and everything in the article is allegedly said . 
  i know there is a saudi influence in chechenya , but i find your claims very exaggerated , that 's why i asked for a source . 
  oh really ? 
  i thought chechenya declared its independence , russia did n't recognize it and that 's why the war broke out . 
  could this be a result of the war and destruction in chechnya ? 
  fuck everyone who targets civilians but is n't it unfair to skip the deportation of an entire nation , a bloody war , thousands of deads and human right abuses ( from both sides ) and say `` they do this because religion ? '', 
   a country that turkey does n't recognise exists . 
  i hope our state will stop this bullshit asap . 
  source on meeting ? 
  ( not from rt ) full force of jihadist in syria to disturb winter olympics ? 
  wtf ? 
  how the hell thousands of jihadists would suddenly stop fighting in syria and cross ypg controlled areas in northern syria , then turkey , then georgia , then caucasus and disturb the winter olympics ? 
  no i was not being sarcastic and i really do n't know anything about the comedian . 
  i 'll be honest , the salute is so retarded but certainly not racist . 
   soooooo ... more muslims , then ? 
  of course , * habibi * . 
  [ this is my relatives ' reaction when they heard the news . 
  so , it has nothing to do with racism . 
  i 've never seen that kind of nazi salute , can anyone provide more info on this ? 
  is there any historical background of that salute ? 
  btw anelka tweeted this : https://twitter.com/anelkaofficiel/status/417082349159870464/photo/1, 
  highly-skilled immigrants can be from `` white '' , `` non-kebab '' and `` non-nigger '' countries , too . 
  you know this , right ? 
  i miss the days when even trolling had a point . 
  then there would be an unrecognized country in a partially recognized country and then albanian minority in serbian minority part of kosovo would declare independence and ... balkan nations ca n't into unity . 
   same would apply for the other parts if they would get independence . 
  the need for armed struggle would not be anymore . 
  if you really think so , then good luck with your free kurdistan but i do n't believe that the members of these armed groups would be giving away cakes and balloon to the citizens on a happy election day , instead of fighting each other for the control of oil reserves and political power in an oil-rich kurdistan . 
   it 's almost as if kurds have different opinions on political issues . . 
  the horror !, 
  you missed my point . 
  of course there will be different political parties but do you think that these are just normal political parties ? 
  most of these groups have ** active armed wings ** and ** fighting ** as i am writing right now . 
   jesus , you turks are so delusional when it comes to kurds . 
  i am not one of those turks who call kurdish people `` mountain turks '' . 
  i am all for kurdish rights and i even want kurdish to be the second official language in my country but i also think that a free kurdistan would end up far worse than syria . 
  turkey , syria , iraq and iran should stop oppressing their kurdish citizens and grant them full cultural rights . 
  this is my alternative to the kurdish issue . 
   i 'm fully supportive of an actual kudistan , to the detriment of syria , turkey , iraq and iran . 
  this is the worst scenario for kurds . 
  i 'm serious . 
  in your actual kurdistan , we would witness a bloody civil war . 
  turkey ; pkk ( lefitst ) kurdish hizbullah ( islamist ) syria ; ypg ( leftist ) kurdish islamic front ( islamist ) iraq ; kdp ( center right ) puk ( center left ) kurdistan islamic movement ( islamist ) iran ; pjak ( leftist ) most of these groups had fought against each other . 
   the ~ ~ people ~ ~ ** dictators ** in the middle east need russia way more than russia needs them . 
  ftfy, 
  is it the swastika at 2:55 ? 
   there is nothing about in at oath that praises ataturk personally whatsoever . 
  you are right , the part which say '' ** oh great ataturk ** '' is actually praising me !, 
  right ? 
   you obviously do n't live in turkey so let me tell you this . 
  as a guy , who repeated this oath on every fucking single school day for 8 years , i know quite a lot about it . 
   all the arguments and debates were made based on `` ne mutlu turkum diyene '' . 
  i have n't said anything against this , i just said this oath was heavily defended by secularists and gave a detail about the oath , so people can clearly see that it was another round of the fight between akp and chp . 
  i never said it was removed because it praises atat\u00fcrk , i just gave a detail and said it praises atat\u00fcrk and as you can see the part about atat\u00fcrk , i am right . 
   how is this related to erdogan . 
  it is related to erdogan because anti-akp people say ( and they are right about that ) erdogan interferes people 's personal life , yet they ( just like you ) also interfere people 's personal life by stating what is the best for the country and which path they should follow . 
   i do n't think ataturk did interfere with people 's personal life . 
  hat revolution ? 
  people being hanged without a trial because they could n't speak turkish ? 
  i can count many others but i 'm sure even you do n't believe in what you said , so i skip this part . 
   ataturk did n't even started the oath . 
  it was done after 40 years of the death of ataturk . 
  again , you are wrong . 
  it started in 1933 , but the parts which praised him were added later on . 
   that oath was taken down because it is a symbol of nationalism and pro-turkism . 
  that is a fact . 
  show me the part , where i said the opposite . 
  i just gave a detail , so people can understand how important it was for kemalists and secularists . 
  and the oath praised atat\u00fcrk , that is ** also ** a fact . 
  source ; youtube.com keywords ; russian , neo-nazis , attack , kill, 
   no matter how you try to manipulate this simple sentence to something else , its not gon na work . 
  are you fucking serious ? 
  here is what i wrote about the oath ;  the student oath , which praised ** atat\u00fcrk ** here is what you wrote about the oath ;  oath has nothing to do with ** ataturk ** and here is a part from the oath ;  `` oh great ** atat\u00fcrk ** !, 
  on the path that you have paved , i swear to walk incessantly toward the aims that you have set . '', 
  now , tell me please how the hell i am manipulating this simple sentence that `` has nothing to with ataturk '' ? 
   that sentence means people will follow the what 's best for the country . 
  who decides what 's the best for the country ? 
  i am sure you are sick of erdogan deciding what 's best for everyone , yet you are doing it yourself !,
