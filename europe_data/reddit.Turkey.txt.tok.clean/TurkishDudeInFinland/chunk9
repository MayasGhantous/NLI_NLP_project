  god , you guys always do this !, 
  always !, 
   oath has nothing to do with ataturk come one , man . 
  english ; `` oh great ** atat\u00fcrk ** !, 
  on the path that you have paved , i swear to walk incessantly toward the aims that you have set . '', 
   from what i 've seen atat\u00fcrk is still very respected in turkey yes , even though there are small groups of islamists , kurds and communists who hate atat\u00fcrk for various reasons , still he is a respected historical figure in turkey . 
  but not everyone who respects atat\u00fcrk is a typical kemalist . 
  there are many different descriptions of atat\u00fcrk and his ideas . 
  some islamists say that he was a true muslim and target only those people who misused religion , some secularists say that he was a modern and atheist leader who wanted to erase all the religions from daily lives of turkish people , some nationalists say that he was a nationalist and cared only about his turkishness . 
  so he is a respected person , but people respect and hate him for very different reasons . 
  you 're welcome . 
  i do n't know if hagia sophia is still an issue for greeks but i want to clear the things up . 
  this issue has nothing to do with christians . 
  it is a part of a wider political battle between akp and chp . 
  it was atat\u00fcrk , who converted hagia sophia into a museum and chp is famous for defending everything that has something to do with atat\u00fcrk as he is also the founder of the party . 
  akp has removed two things that were heavily defended by secularists ( mainly chp ) . 
  first the student oath , which praised atat\u00fcrk and the headscarf ban . 
  akp wants to reconvert hagia sophia into a mosque because that will bring them a lot of votes from mhp ( the nationalists ) , which has significant number of `` pro-sunni '' voters and will give a clear message to chp , `` we are the rulers of this country '' . 
  someone , please make 1991 and 2013 photo comparison of these places . 
   the only thing i learned is that none of them integrate a shit . 
  `` i am dannish , somali and muslim '' yeah , it is so sad to see muslims integrating the european society and trying to get a job , is n't it ? 
   it is only muslim propaganda . 
  i 've only read the one about anwar , helsinki . 
  can you please show me that muslim propaganda in the stories you have read , because i could n't see any propaganda . 
  / r/language _ exchange, 
  with imams like [ this one ] ( http://galeri3.uludagsozluk.com/128/topu-u%c3%a7arak-kar%c5%9f%c4%b1layan-hac%c4%b1_282565.jpg ) , we for sure are going to win this game !, 
  now you can obtain a sealandic id , buy a piece of their territory and even join the knights of sealand !, 
   do turkish people really think that way about germans ? 
  let me answer this question . 
   tell me , had you already had sex by age 12 ? 
  yes , most turks believe that european girls , in general , start having an active sex life by the age of 12 . 
   how many abortions have you had ? 
  never heard of this stereotype . 
   why do you germans drink so much beer ? 
  yes , most turks believe that germans drink beer as frequently as we drink water . 
   why do your priests rape little boys ? 
  nope , turkish people do n't know anything about these types of scandals in the christian world . 
   hopefully your parents wo n't throw you out at age 16 so you can learn how to stand on your own two feet . 
  and tell me , why do you stick your elderly in nursing homes ? 
  these are very common stereotypes about europeans . 
  even if the eu introduces a diversity lottery scheme , there still will be lots of illegal immigrants . 
  because some of those guys are declared outlaws in their own countries and some of them are threatened by government-sponsored gangs/armed militias for their political ideologies or religious beliefs . 
  they are denied even most basic rights , they can not participate in the lottery of foreign countries . 
   we would prefer the term greek and turkish cypriots , for external policy reasons , thank you . 
  yeah , you are right since the trnc is pretty much a non-country . 
  sorry if that offended you , i just did n't want to edit the original title . 
   raising living expenses . 
  what ? 
  i did n't quite get this part . 
  * brother nation . 
  * we speak almost the same language . 
  * corrupt as the 80 's turkey . 
  * very very ( i mean really ) secular . 
  * oil-rich . 
  * people love money . 
  * people also love turkey . 
  * people also love every kind of art . 
  * they hate armenians more than we hate . 
  ( p.s i personally do n't hate armenians . ), 
  * most azeris have a positive view of the sovites . 
  * they speak russian fairly well and `` steal '' russian-related jobs in southern turkey . 
  are those neo-nazis who kill non-slavic people by hammers and machetes considered terrorists in putin 's russia ? 
   come on , no-one died and we are calling it pogrom because it sounds catchy ? 
  [ an azeri ] ( http://en.apa.az/xeber_azerbaijani_citizen_killed_in_russia___s_c_201219.html ) and [ an uzbek ] ( http://en.apa.az/news/201211 ) are killed in revenge attacks . 
   also the eu does not want to border some of the most fucked up countries in the world . 
  like , ermmm , oh gosh i dunno maybe iraq , syria , iran , armenia ? 
  you know what ? 
  even though i realize that we have no place in the eu , it just hurts me to know that one of the main reasons is not even our fault . 
  but on the other hand , this fact also gives me hope for the future . 
  i mean look at what happened to our neighbors in last 10 years . 
  two of them ( greece and iran ) have financially collapsed , other two of them invaded by foreign countries ( georgia and iraq ) , one of them is having a bloody civil war as we are talking now but we 've still managed to stay out of all this madness . 
  it is just like when we managed to stay out of the conflict during the wwii . 
  i just hope we will adopt more of eu criterias , even though we will never be a part of it . 
  well ... obviously the eu in 2004 . 
  it is impossible to talk about a political solution to the syrian civil war while there are so many different independent armed groups operating in syria . 
  let 's say germany can convince bashar and the fsa to sign a peace aggreement . 
  who will stop the isis ? 
  or al-nusra ? 
  or shabiha ? 
  or hezbollah ? 
  or shia militias from iraq ? 
  do you think they will simply say `` well , ok if germany says so . '', 
  and leave syria ? 
  bashar could prevent all this shit by simply resigning from the throne of his father and not slaughtering peaceful protesters in 2011 . 
  there are tens of different armed groups with different ideologies on the rebels ' side and independent sectarian armed groups , iraqi paramilitary forces and hezbollah on the government 's side . 
  good luck with that , germany . 
  got it bro , i agree with you . 
  thanks for your answer !, 
  in this case , i totally agree with him . 
   to keep africans and turks from moving around freely . 
  i do n't get why you mentioned us . 
  do you mean only illegal immigrants or legal immigrants as well ? 
  because turks barely go to europe without legal papers , they know they will be kicked out once the police catch them since turkey is not a war-torn country , but africans can apply for an asylum if their lives are threaten in their home countries . 
  here is another article regarding the issue ; http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2013/10/greek-neo-nazi-mps-face-court-charges-20131016483986334.html this one uses the term `` neo-nazi mps '' in the title . 
  you are right . 
  it is also funny to see how some redditors think that the current turkish government wants to destroy everything that kurds own in neighbouring countries while the opposition in turkey critize the government , saying they support autonomous kurdish government `` too much '' . 
  the autonomous kurdistan of iraq definitely has a positive effect on the kurdish issue of turkey but our normalization process started long before the syrian revolution and the clashes between ypg and syrian rebels . 
  btw turkey is not so `` anti-kurdish '' in syria , neither . 
  our officials had a meeting ( in istanbul ) with salih muslim , the leader of ypg and have helped many kurdish refugees . 
   `` recent investigations into the murders committed by the neo-nazi group nsu ( national socialist underground ) have revealed an extensive international network that serves the interests of right-wing extremists . '',
