you , the propaganda guy , again ? 
  yes , pkk is n't just targeting turks but also kurds who does n't support them . 
  as this to me , people even say `` turks are some middle east people '' , while i 'm sitting in european part of istanbul . 
  what does roma people mean ? 
  if ancient greeks then it 's okay for me ( mark turkey 0.000001 ), 
  is * fasching * a thing ? 
  could some one make it clear for me , from when and why catalan people wants to get independence ? 
  in the end we are all humans are n't we ? 
  europeans and their * highness * is more laughable i think . 
  both of us are human yet you are like `` turks are obsessive people which are n't be included in europe '' . 
  aegean provinces and thrace . 
  greeks are n't ghost . 
  * hmm pkk kills people * this is fake . 
  * turkey kills pkk members * turkey is killling kurds . 
  edirne is afrikan i assume and tekirda\u011f is latin amerikan while k\u0131rklareli is australian finally ~ ~ istanbul ~ ~ constantinapol belongs to ~ ~ greece ~ ~ byzantium . 
  you ca n't beat us . 
  homeland and armenia should be one color . 
  if you wo n't allow germans to visit their troops , you are breaking it by yourself . 
  but doubtful sources are true right mr russian ? 
  you need that / s but even it wo n't save you because this is n't funny but full stupidity . 
  do they are controlled by government ? 
  ** yes ** over n out, 
  oh here you are , the propaganda guy ... man really what is your mission ? 
  pkk is active in iraq and syria too but not like turkey . 
  byzantium can into europe \u3064 \u25d5 _ \u25d5 \u3064, 
  * make it three *, 
  not % 100 muslim also, 
  europe and europe continent are 2 different things . 
  i thought we were after greece not brits ... 
  / r/europe says : middle east / r/turkey says : europe you say : mediterranean i say : asia hahahahaha, 
  let him drown it is meaningless to mess with him . 
  * lets split turkey into half *, 
   what did she claim ? 
  she is greek ( born in greece came turkey after ) . 
   to be a minority there should be big numbers , and the numbers of greeks in turkey are very small . 
  like ten thousand which is n't small as you thing . 
  tomorrow , byzantium empire will be recreated but just for one day ( \u035c\u0296 ), 
  oh , african heat wave which microwaves us . 
  why ? 
  and force a `` should greece join to turkey '' vote with the yes winning side . 
  oh wait this is really good . 
  but you have germoney i think ? 
   erdogan made hate speech against armenians . 
  i ca n't control a random person makes hate speech against armenians nor germany can control nazi people nor france can control people or spain or italy or any other country . 
  first sentence talks about erdogan , second talks about * a random person * ** not ** erdogan . 
   regarding hate speech/erdogan , to start with note that the report includes many instances of the state abetting or engaging in hate speech . 
  however focusing on erdogan for a moment , note that he is not a random person . 
  he is the head of the state and represents the state . 
  everything he says is the state officially speaking . 
  it is a big deal for a head of state to engage in hate speech against one of its minorities , and moreover one with such a past . 
  & nbsp ;  but simply adding to the work you have done , which i think is interesting . 
  my thanks . 
   are n't there a kurdish ban in turkey ? 
  there was but removed legally in 1991 ( started after 1980 coup ) . 
  there are still reports of punishment for using kurdish . 
  i already wrote that in the text ? 
  do i need to write it 10 times ? 
   hate speech erdogan made hate speech against armenians . 
  i ca n't control a random person makes hate speech against armenians nor germany can control nazi people nor france can control people or spain or italy or any other country . 
   hidden armenians i did n't made the research , konda did and as i read it is germany based , so there is n't any `` this map is % 100 true '' . 
  as i wrote last ethnic information was collected in 1965 census . 
  you are calling historical facts , i 'm calling them too what is the problem ? 
  middle east is messy \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) \\ _ / \u00af actually one of the my reason was trying to explain minorities . 
  more likely `` stuff on internet tried to be collected '', 
  if you are asking for constitution , armenia is a neighbour of turkey which has similar articles about language and the people . 
  ottoman empire was multicultural which is the main problem in turkey , unlike most of the european countries there are still minorities , and turkey is showed as ** monster ** about this subject . 
  should i also write that anmenians joined russian , french , english armies and burned turkish villages ? 
  oh wait it is n't against turks so it * must * be fake . 
  but it wo n't \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) \\ _ / \u00af, 
  this is why i wrote massacre/genocide . 
  actually table supposed to be turkish and armenian constitutions . 
  france , german and spain constitutions are added in last minute so i do n't actuamly know about them completely . 
  this article * ish * thing is n't detailed as you see i ca n't write everything about turks or minorities . 
  if reddit officially has 10k character limit i ca n't add it , if not this must wait because i ca n't reach my computer . 
   if you are referring to the language issue , i can not see why turkey not being a federal country is relevant , since you added certain parts of the spanish constitution to make a point . 
  as you know there are local governments in spain but in turkey there are n't independent local g\u0131vernments like in spain . 
  provinces ca n't make new rules which apply themself . 
   if you add [ section 3.2 ] ( https://www.boe.es/legislacion/documentos/constitucioningles.pdf ) it will change the meaning of the point you are trying to make , right ? 
  if i add that i need to write that germany is federal , france idk , armenia idk , turkey is n't . 
  i 'm repeating van , bitlis , i\u011fd\u0131r or any other province in turkey ca n't create new rules . 
   as for the first one , you are right , it is in the * preamble * !, 
  i 'm looking on it right now . 
  because there is a minority ? 
  i had one friend ( as she claims ) in istanbul while in school . 
  i have seen the second but turkey is n't a federal country . 
  as for first in the link which i give there is n't a * people of spain * which might be old if it is added after . 
  this is a * short * information about turkey and minorities in it . 
  i 'm trying to show that we are n't barrel bombing ethnic minorities or burning them because they are heretics . 
  as a turk i 'm disappointed with the research made about turkey and russia when facts should be checked . 
  maybe you are aware of turks are upvoting comments which are protecting them , and pro-turkish comments , beceuse there is a general hate against us . 
  well still turks are upvoting this sort of comments . 
  ** were ** looks like date is 3000bc, 
  protect turks -  get upvote you should know subs rules ... 
  let us give you some sarma then ? 
  oh wait sarma is long and he is long rte = = sarma, 
   ~ ~ it 's still a step up from being a ~ ~ * they are * boat refugee * s *, 
  the hell ? 
  russia is european but turkey is n't . 
  * lets build some nuclear yeni\u00e7eris and destroy the wien this time . 
  * cries in not having flair *,
