  greek in cyprus ? 
  *** triggered ***, 
  1000 years = = minimum 10 different family which are child of itself . 
  ** was ** but oh wait it is 2000bc i forgot . 
   are you a moron ? 
  i said r/europe does n't have only 12 turks . 
  you can say people : `` you are a 12 year old child '' and `` moron '' . 
   it 's not propaganda if it 's legit . 
  it would be propaganda , if i share the kurdish man who hit my fathers in front of the garage while he was waiting for me and mother , and exceed the speed limit with going 70 in a street which is barely 5 km long , right ? 
  and i would n't share him because of hitting us , because of getting out his car with yelling `` you fucking cunt , you are doing this because i 'm kurd '' . 
   that 's slightly inaccurate . 
  regardless , turkish policies are no secret to anyone with internet access . 
  tell us the truth then ? 
  thank you, 
  i do n't know actually . 
  this would harm both turkey and greece . 
  turkey has like 3 million refugees already and greece is having too much . 
   the problem we have right now , as the german chap above said , in western europe we have differing ideas to much of the east of europe on many things , trying to make an immigration policy that we are all ok with is an impossible task for example if i 'm not wrong poland and another country ( ca n't remember right now ) applied for not getting immigrants ( because they ca n't keep up ) but rejected . 
  this is like main problem ? 
  actually this would be great . 
  i know where cyprus is . 
  i was talking about the big island which is next to the italy . 
  * and i have visited malta for 2 weeks such shame to me *, 
  is n't malta painted in yellow ? 
  they ca n't infiltrate government like spies do . 
  as you see from there this woman might be giving informations of german police to the turkey . 
  when countries was n't giving 12 points to neighbours and 0 to uk . 
  having co-emperors is n't good in this time , they might form secret coalition and crush the eu or other co-emperors . 
  i have read somewhere that uk wanted turkey in eu for breaking power of france-germany ( but you know we have gone full rogue ) . 
  is this like roman empire ? 
  if it is then there is weu as a new country and eeu as another country ( 2 countries ) . 
  actually people could swim to greek islands . 
  and nets or wall ( if they are n't like 50 meter ) wo n't stop them . 
  germany is probably biggest and strongest country in eu which makes he/she right . 
  but maybe france ( as having virtual capital of eu ) might be the ruler too . 
  this is the new option which added on the list after mid 2016 and very good for * democratic * countries like * glorious * turkey . 
  i think # 10 stands for `` country who can create crisis perfectly '' * cries in 46 *, 
  but how did he/she made that u and not p ? 
  fake plate i assume . 
  eu is trying hard . 
  in turkey we blame greece of external powers and second one is easy . 
  dutchies just need to tell `` this happened because of external powers '' and done . 
  unfortunately this wall is n't for all refugees it is for poor ones , they are n't muslim bros of erdogan , so nope turkey is n't trying to stop a crysis :(, 
  first , i can remember you from tne news i shared in / r/europe which was about a kurdish dad whose child got killed by pkk and you and / u/nicola -_- tesla said turkish government is destroying kurdish history while both you were saying pkk is protecting kurds ( yeah if you kill kurds who are anti-pkk that means you are protecting them ) . 
  second , your history seems like you are propaganda guy . 
  third , calling people 12 is n't the way speaking with people . 
  yes but sometimes i do n't want to be turkish or european because of the people who make things bad . 
  until world find a way to stop terrorism i wo n't :(, 
  how about a * ham * burger ? 
  if having a quarter bosnian father is counted than i 'm not just half turkish half albanian that makes i 'm also bosnian . 
  oh this is getting ridiculous . 
  is n't armenian border is closed or am i living in the past ? 
  http://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/country.php?id=224 http://ec.europa.eu/echo/files/aid/countries/factsheets/turkey_syrian_crisis_en.pdf, 
  we already have like 3 million refugees and they are opening their own works on turkey without paying literally anything . 
  turkey is building wall to it 's syrian border for both immigrants and the terrorists . 
  why to the greece ? 
  greece is n't have economical problems right now , would n't this harm greece more ? 
  ~ ~ educational ~ ~ misunderstandable * is this an actual word ? 
  actually this is funny . 
  ** disallowed comments : ** 6 - ** agenda pushing ** : refers to accounts found to persistently and overwhelmingly post and comment to promote a specific political agenda . 
  this is n't an outlet for propaganda . 
  then i want you to look at history of / u/nicola -_- tesla / u/psyduckv2 this posts owner this three are making propaganda against turkey . 
  and killing teachers , soldiers , police , doctors and civils is legal but when you have consequences of it `` turkey is killing uuuusssss '', 
  i could even expect spanish inquistion but this made me laugh instantly . 
  why the fuck erdo = turkey while not % 100 of turkey does n't support him . 
  you guys seriously need help ( and trump or putin are n't equal to their country either ) . 
  are n't you the racist anti-turk guy ?? 
  in northern part there are laz people who speak their language too and in the middle arabic is speaked like southern turkey . 
  trabzon is in the list and \u00c7ank\u0131r\u0131 and konya and ankara and bla bla but southern part is greyed which is the problem because if trabzon is european then i\u011fd\u0131r is too . 
  so ankara is in europe but bitlis not ? 
  you are hired for giving geography classes . 
  than england ~ = europe ? 
  oh you the racist again !? 
  why you are just writing against turks what is your problem ?? 
  why eastern turkey is missing again like % 90 of the maps ? 
  as i know turkey and russia also has lands in europe continent or did greece tate over istanbul again ? 
  turkey can into yurop like poland can into space ( \u30ce\u0ca0\u76ca\u0ca0 ) \u30ce\u5f61 \u253b \u2501 \u253b, 
  oh my bad than ... 
  former yugoslavian republic ** of ** macedonia, 
  hey greece thank you !, 
  not anymore as the * make america great again * guy says . 
  found the answer : you are n't racist . 
  with good governments i mean `` not trying to destroy the country '' not like our gov in turkey . 
  democratic governments are n't % 100 good nor authoritian ones but in both system there could be people who are peaceful and smart , for me only this type of persons are good and enough of them creates the good government . 
  ah ~ ~ the simspons ~ ~ the retarded unit cartoon . 
  you know that some people does n't like murican system so i was their sound . 
  what if they make collaboration with other ( s ) ? 
  what if they make collaboration with other ( s ) ?
