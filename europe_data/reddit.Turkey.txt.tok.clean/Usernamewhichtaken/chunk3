  they are already making war with killing soldiers , local security forces , civillians . 
   nice job going through my older comments when you are out of arguments i 'm treating everybody with their way . 
   sadly you did n't include the context , which is responding to alt-right trolls on / r/imgoingtohellforthis and still racist even if it is a joke  kurds in eastern anatolia did n't ( because they had it rather good in the ottoman empire , the bad stuff started happening more with atat\u00fcrk and his supposed `` secular and democratic turkey '' ) yes they were but ; * https://www.wikiwand.com/en/massacres_of_badr_khan#/massacres* happened and this is the starting point of this ** bad stuff **  thus they are still a majority in their region . 
  despite turkish efforts to assimilate and destroy who does not assimilate . 
  so i 'm right on this subject ;  now i 'm saying that if it is normal to you ( from majority to minority ) why you are n't saying that usa killed them for not allowing them to be independent ? 
  if turkey would do that to kurds you will be writing that every hour . 
  you are just speaking for kurds who killed assyrian people ( and than kurdish vilayets are directly ruled by ottoman empire ) . 
  why you did n't write that !, 
  you say ? 
   american subhumans do because they do n't know what efficient public transport is . 
  from your older comments . 
  you seem like sort of * racist * to me thought . 
   maybe i got you wrong unfortunately yes . 
   but your previous post sounded very much like `` if the us could slaughter the indians and that 's okay , then why are you complaining about turks doing that to kurds ? '' because you told that ;  those examples are of places where the respective groups are minorities . 
  indians are minority because of history but as i see kurds are n't a ~ ~ d ~ ~ nd you said ;  despite all your efforts seems legit ( !? ), 
  to me  maybe i misunderstood , though . 
  no problem at all . 
  everybody could be angry to someone . 
  dude what ?!, 
   despite all of your efforts i 'm not trying to kills kurds you maniac . 
  they are minority because of history . 
  now i 'm saying that if it is normal to you ( from majority to minority ) why you are n't saying that usa killed them for not allowing them to be independent ? 
  if turkey would do that to kurds you will be writing that every hour . 
  so not allowing to marrying them ( indians on america ) is a good thing ? 
  i need comments of him suppporting terrorism as evidence for using against him . 
  could you please share them ?

  first stop deleting your comments then write them dot edit ; 1-you are saying turkey and turks are `` racist '' , you are using word `` bullshit '' , you are saying that i 'm `` ultranationalist '' , you are saying that i have `` racist mentality '' . 
  2-i 'm civil against you but you are n't as i stated at * 1 * imgur : http://imgur.com/a/psk2b  this guy is also no different , he is trying to forcefully impose turkish identity on kurds article 66 - everyone bound to the turkish state through the bond of citizenship is a turk  denying kurdish history  i 'm repeating : upper mesopotamia : after the arab islamic conquest of the mid-7th century ad * from wiki *  bohtan ( also buhtan , bokhti ) was a medieval kurdish principality in the ottoman empire centered on the town of jazirah ibn ` omar ( modern cizre also known as ciz\u00eera botan ( jazira botan ) ) in southeastern anatolia ** your whole history is anti-turk ** https://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/6nry7g/ypg_turkey_tries_to_portray_our_legitimate/dkbuofx/ this comment directly copied under one of mine in this topic too . 
  in / r/syriancivilwar you are ** supporting terrorism ** and saying that ** all turks are fascist and racist ** *** how am i supposed to believe you ***, 
  * right cause * why everybody is stuck to history ? 
  like you ( / u/berry2012 ) or / u/nikola -_- tesla or / u/psyduckv2 . 
  if turkey is * occupying * eastern anatolia then usa is occupying middle of north america ( because indians-actual word is k\u0131z\u0131lderili in t ~ ~ u ~ ~ urkish-were living there !? 
  ) , germany is occupying greek land because holy roman empire was ruling the area !? 
  do you want me to continue ? 
  i know them ( just because my family like that ) . 
  people today has 1 problem : history means history , peace means peace , human means human . 
  oh ... still i 'm against it because it is terrorism .

  ( august 2011 ) * and this principality ruled by ottoman empire too ( like 200 years ) . 
   https://www.wikiwand.com/en/bahdinan ** accepted ** but entered ottoman rule again ( still accepted but not ruled eastern anatolia ) . 
  ( 1376-1843 ) founded in hakkari , capital was amadiya looks like amadiya ( amedi ) is in iraq kurdistan right now . 
   https://www.wikiwand.com/en/shaddadids ** accepted ** but not ruled eastern anatolia yet various parts of armenia and arran ( as wiki says ) was controlled by shadddadids between 951-1174 . 
  final note : as some people say you are a troll and anti-turk person which vandalise turkish titles . 
  shame on you :( edit : you seem like writing against turks like % 90 of the time, 
  give me the name of this kurdish dynasty which ruled anatolia which ruled more than centuries . 
  not an edit : you seem like writing against turks like % 90 of the time this is an edit : also my family tree is n't from albania completely . 
   turkey is truly an incorrigible political shit-stain the only party that seems respected is the hdp , which almost all fanatic ethnic turks consider a terrorist or separatist party . 
  maybe because of hdp 's pkk support ? 
  maybe you think hdp is the only party which you can trust just because you hate turks ? 
  edit : you seem like writing against turks like % 90 of the time, 
   kurds are a recognized minority in armenia http://www.agos.com.tr/en/article/18204/four-minority-groups-to-be-represented-in-armenian-parliament like this ? 
  if you say that than look for akp 's and chp 's deputies you can see kurdish deputies too . 
  http://www.wikiwand.com/en/minorities_in_turkey as wiki says only armenians , greeks and jews are recognized by lausanne treaty ( albanians-oh i 'm half albanian !, 
  ? , pontic greeks , kurds , arabs , bosniaks , circassians and chechen 's are turkish as laws says ) * from wiki *  many of the minorities ( including the albanians , bosnians , crimean tatars , and various peoples from the caucasus , as well as some of the turks themselves ) are descendants of muslims ( muhajirs ) who were expelled from the lands lost by the shrinking ottoman empire , but they have assimilated into and intermarried with the majority turkish population and have adopted the turkish language and way of life , though this does not make them ethnic turks . 
  for albanians it is n't true though . 
  we ( or they because i 'm half ) can speak albanian *** and we are n't bombing civillians or law enforcements *** , we are living our culture without barriers ( like folklore ) edit : you seem like writing against turks like % 90 of the time, 
  http://www.wikiwand.com/en/peoples%27_democratic_party_ ( turkey ) this guys ( which clearly supports pkk ) won eastern cities with % 60 / % 70 . 
  edit : you seem like writing against turks like % 90 of the time, 
   if you want try to ply the meme that considering every turkish citizien as a turk was a respectable or progressive policy try doing it on / r/greece , / r/armenia , / r/kurdistan without a turkish vote or comment brigade .
