   american is an all encompassing term for american citizens unlike being turkish which is the dominant ethnic group in turkey , since kurds are not turks in any shape or form calling them turks is racist and offensive , it 's an attack on their identity , language , culture and history . 
  from the turkish constitution ; ** article 66 - everyone bound to the turkish state through the bond of citizenship is a turk **  when the turkish state founded non-turkish ethnic groups were perceived as a danger to the integrity of the state , and the kurds , as the largest minority group , were obviously a serious threat . 
  from the turkish constitution ; ** article 3 - the state of turkey , with its territory and ** *** nation *** ** is an indivisible entity . 
  its language is turkish ** -  kurds have turkish id so they are turk ( as national not ethnical or race means ) -  turks ( turkic people , kurdish people , arabs , armenians , greeks , zaza 's and any other human which has turkish id ) are indivisible . 
  ** article 5 - the fundamental aims and duties of the state are to safeguard the independence and integrity of the turkish nation , the indivisibility of the country , the republic and democracy , to ensure the welfare , peace , and happiness of the individual and society ; to strive for the removal of political , economic , and social obstacles which restrict the fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual in a manner incompatible with the principles of justice and of the social state governed by rule of law ; and to provide the conditions required for the development of the individual 's material and spiritual existence . 
  ** so anyone ( in our case pkk ) threats turkey ( threats the independence or integrity of land ) faces the consequences of it . 
   they were decreed to be turks and as a result , their language , culture , dress , family names and even village names had to be turkish . 
  `` article 66 '' and because the land ( eastern anatolia ) belongs to turkey names are changed ( yet local people are using the old names in conversations ) . 
  ** article 17 - everyone has the right to life and the right to protect and improve his/her corporeal and spiritual existence . 
  ** ** article 24 - everyone has the freedom of conscience , religious belief and conviction . 
  ** ** article 25 - everyone has the freedom of thought and opinion . 
  ** ** article 63 - the state shall ensure the protection of the historical , cultural and natural assets and wealth , and shall take supportive and promotive measures towards that end . 
  ** -  well i ca n't say that erdogan loves this article . 
   it was forbidden to speak their language in cities and towns , all external symbols of their ethnic identity were suppressed , i could agree that until recently , but right now it is allowed to speak your own language ( for kurds it is kurdish )  turkish teachers were sent to kurdish villages with the teaching of turkish as their chief objective , and distinctive kurdish dress was forbidden . 
  ** article 42 - no one shall be deprived of the right of education . 
  the scope of the right to education shall be defined and regulated by law ... under the supervision and control of the state ... no language other than turkish shall be taught as a mother tongue to turkish citizens at any institution of education . 
  foreign languages to be taught in institutions of education and the rules to be followed by schools conducting education in a foreign language shall be determined by law . 
  the provisions of international treaties are reserved . 
  ** as article 66 says that id owners are turkish , without ethnical or religions discrimination , everybody who are turk learns turkish as mother tongue . 
  as article says foreign languages ( kurdish is foreing to turkey ) are determined by law . 
   now you expect kurds to call themselves turks dishonorably after all these wild and barbaric assimilation efforts ? 
  they are already turk . 
  right now you are racist ( and you are making hate speech to turks ) . 
   forget abbout it , kurds are not turks and they should never ever call themselves turks , this is disgusting . 
  they are turk . 
  edit : you seem like writing against turks like % 90 of the time, 
  the number of kurdish villages depopulated by turkey is estimated at around 3,000 . 
  since 1984 , the turkish military has embarked on a campaign to eradicate the ** kurdistan workers party , a militant kurdish opposition group . 
  ** as a result , 30,000 people have died , and two million kurdish refugees have been * driven out * of their homes into overcrowded * urban shanty towns * . 
  operations was for eliminating pkk and they * partially * ( `` thank you '' erdogan ) succeeded . 
  edit : you seem like writing against turks like % 90 of the time, 
  if you are n't killing turks , kurds or other locals this spy thing wo n't harm you . 
  edit : you seem like writing against turks like % 90 of the time, 
  also taf and jandarma ( idk english equal of this ) is protecting turkey and eastern cities , village guards are kurdish because they are locals of this cities . 
  edit : you seem like writing against turks like % 90 of the time, 
  killing kurds is n't protecting them also ( pkk is killing kurds who are n't supporting them ) and as i wrote there turkey is n't angel all the time but not all turks are supporting government and i have a few kurdish ( full kurdish ) friends which i do n't have no problems . 
  so ~ 20 million kurds , which they can speak their own language are spies or brainwashed ? 
  many of countries have racist things with your view , in their national marches , in education systems and best example is usa . 
  be european or asian , african or latin american it does n't matter who you are you are raised as american ( us american ) . 
  edit : you seem like writing against turks like % 90 of the time edit : ~ added before 20 million because of 20 million is n't exactly 20 million . 
  edit : / u/nikola -_- tesla you deleted that comment . 
  are there anyway to see that comment ? 
  any one got screenshot of it ? 
  this events are n't daily right now but they was . 
  good thing is turkey is n't banning kurdish right now ( to speak ) , bad thing kurds just want to get land of turkey ( not all but pkk supporters , think like isil in syria ) . 
  as another example islamists were oppressed too and right now they are oppressing others . 
  1-turkey is wrong in this case 2-man , which spied over kurds , is wrong because of helping to turkey this is what i wrote that . 
  turkey is n't doing good things all the day but pkk is n't innocent too . 
  hello neighbour  thank you . 
  unfortunately yes :( thanks for the bodrum but you might want to look for kos island because 2 casualties have given . 
  my problem is turkey seems equal to erdogan , usa -  trump , poland ( as you know there is a huge protest to government ) -  duda and others . 
  this guys does n't get % 100 of the vote and none of their actions are supported % 100 by the people . 
  btw probably emergency condition will continue like 1 more year ( 3mon + ... +3 mon ) . 
  greek kebab hmm interesting ... i can try that . 
  jo un\u00eb nuk do ta b\u00ebj k\u00ebt\u00eb ( no i wo n't do that in albanian ), 
  this ugly ass clothes are n't part of islam ( quran says close genital parts of your body ) but when i say that to people they believe some shithead faithful organization ( turkey : g\u00fclen , menzil , nur , ... ) . 
  this organizations have different styles of wearing clothes ( i know a few ) . 
  for ~ ~ oru\u00e7 ( idk english of this ) ~ ~ fasting yes you are right . 
  maybe 680 is all / s, 
  deus vult or remove kebab ? 
  i 'm waiting the impossible : restore byzantium walls :(, 
  mimar sinan is n't living right now and you know it was * years * ago . 
  it is problem of those weirdos . 
  earthquake missed germoney you say ? 
  i 'm caring since sofia is a city where people live . 
  lisbon is unlucky . 
  you said that and earthquake happens tomorrow !, 
  both of us know that we ca n't protect them as they were . 
  what, 
  as news says bodrum is in good shape . 
  1 ~ ~ greek ~ ~ swede and 1 turk ( both in kos ) is dead as said . 
  turks killed armenians because they were helping russia , france , britain !, 
  i have born in last years of 90 so i ca n't talk about 90 's but today turks are seeing greeks as occupiers and greeks are seeing turks as occupier ( from my view-maybe i have born in wrong time ) . 
  akpnation was fake avatar and got support for long time but i 'm happy that finally world understood that they are the bad guys who are damaging to world ( especially turkey ) .
