  frahce please say that you do n't like this religion trader . 
  well i can say that i 'm secular but i hate eu mostly ... and i think greece is the best neighbour anybody could get ( yet greeks will say that turks are people who annexed their land ) . 
  you are selfish . 
  world is n't just greece . 
  why the fuck people are trying to split turkey as western anatolia and new kurdish country ? 
  people and their choices ... we were all saying that he is n't secular but nobody considered and now he can control turks who are n't living in turkey . 
  like iranian women ? 
  europe should show how hard is with living erdo\u011fan . 
  send them to turkey , we are already collapsing . 
  are there any international assist to croatia right now ? 
  fire seems like a natural disaster . 
  wait do i have to wait for him to talk before connecting 112 ? 
  ~ ~ turkey ~ ~ erdoland edit : how to make that line appear ? 
  thanks, 
  _ i 'm running for presidency of turkey . 
  vote for me my fellow `` i want chit chat '' user . _ nothing actually , classic things what about you ? 
  mu\u011fla is your place then . 
  bike lanes . 
  check not crowded . 
  check, 
  _ czechia _ czech republic, 
  yeah bye bye to us ... 
  * hell march intensifies *, 
  and central powers loses \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) \\ _ / \u00af, 
  and this `` human rights '' bringed a dictator to us.it is easy to talk while having good politicians and not having a dictator . 
  are n't they just members of commonwealth of nations ? 
  wait wait does new zealand , canada and australia are british colonies right now ? 
  what the hell turkes wants to speak that weird coupish thing ? 
  prisoner of conscience ( poc ) is a term coined by peter benenson in a 28 may 1961 article ( `` the forgotten prisoners '' ) for the london observer newspaper . 
  most often associated with the human rights organisation amnesty international , the term can refer to anyone imprisoned because of their race , sexual orientation , religion , or political views . 
  as wiki says . 
  yet there is a problem ; article 2 - the republic of turkey is a democratic , ** secular ** and social state governed by rule of law , within the notions of public peace , national solidarity and justice , respecting human rights , loyal to the nationalism of atat\u00fcrk , and based on the fundamental tenets set forth in the preamble . 
  you ca n't run country with a religious idea as constitution says , but if a `` supreme leader '' wants it they can just feck a country . 
  yes they helped for electing him . 
  he ran for being prime-minister because ai was one of the guys who got him out of jail . 
  like half of the turkey is choosing him because his islamist idea ( and yes you were able to see this idea in 1998 ) . 
  tl ; dr : ai helped him . 
  remove helens !, 
  * triggered *, 
  problem is erdo\u011fan showed his islamist side on 1998 , yet ai insisted on he is innocent . 
  as i see from albanian ( shqip ) music and history ( nearby 0 knowledge ) kosovo ( kosov\u00eb ) is mystically connected to albanians ( shqiptars ) . 
  did i said i love erdo\u011fan or i 'm supporting him ? 
  nope please do n't be that type of guy . 
  and here starts turkeys fall :(, 
  kosovo and albania are like pieces of an apple but if i 'm not wrong kosovo is n't a part of albania right now . 
  i 'm trying to learn albanian . 
  actually if we have n't ruled !? 
  by some weird people i would definitely report him but everybody knows that twat so it is okayish ( actually i think island shoild be demilitarized but only cyprus army should be left ) . 
  then you are making call of war . 
  so what do you mean then ? 
  are you making a call of war ? 
  actually it is n't the place to argue about armenian thing ? 
  ( genocide , massacre or anything ) but there is some sources of me for it should n't be accepted as genocide ( but ias a massacre it is ) ; - http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bruce-fein/lies-damn-lies-and-armeni_b_211408.html ( not sure about it is against obama or it says it is n't a genocide because as you might see it starts with an obama quote ) - http://www.newstatesman.com/world-affairs/2007/10/turkey-armenia-genocide ( from there i 'm quoting a paragraph ) `` in 2005 , turkey proposed to armenia the establishment of a joint history commission , which will be composed of historians and experts from both sides and third parties in order to study the events of 1915 in their historical context and share the findings with the international public . 
  the fact that this proposal is yet to receive a positive answer from the armenian authorities , when considered together with their rejection to open all the relevant archives to the historians , gives a clear idea about their confidence in what they claim . 
  on the contrary , turkey has no reason to be afraid of its past and is ready to accept whatever the findings of this proposed commission will be . '', 
  - http://www.imprescriptible.fr/dossiers/pierre-loti/armeniens ( well this is french but google translate should do the work , as website says pierre loti talks about armenians are killing turks and bedouins ) ... well i 'm not going to give more things because if i 'm not wrong this is actually wrong to write on / r/europe . 
  i 'm returning to subject `` turks reject removing troops from cyprus '' well we ( turks ) need to remove our troops from cyprus ; 1-cyprus does n't belong to us . 
  2-we did n't get the `` yes you can have troops on cyprus '' from not existent joint cyprus ( and it must exist ) . 
  3-turkey is spending money and other sources to trnc which harms turkey . 
  but i 'm freaking from joint cyprus because greeks have big influence on the island and this could create mediterranean sea problems ( like aegean one ) . 
  if greece can give word then i 'm okay with joing cyprus if not then europe should try to find a way for both countries . 
  well then armenians at eastern part of ottoman empire were n't armenians ? 
  because they were n't displaced like others ? 
  and if i 'm not wrong in war you ca n't just say `` we do n't want to hurt you but let you are '' . 
  btw thank yoi for teaching how to make ** bold ** smth . 
  i was n't knowing that ( i 'm a mobile user ), 
  with this thing armenian massacre was never genocide . 
  they helped russia , france and britain for having western part of ottoman empire and than ottoman empire said that `` you are going to syria '' . 
  seems ok to me . 
  man you just made my day !, 
  i 'm so broken this days ( fuck that little padishah because i 'm a human guy ) . 
  and here i 'm sitting with broken heart because i 'm from turkey :(, 
  thank you, 
  i 'm pretty sure that you know i said there are kurds , armenians and other minorities in turkey when i wrote `` cleansed '' ( do i need to explain everything with pharantesez [ idk how to write this word ] ? ) . 
  well y\u00f6r\u00fck 's are told that the real turks ( genetically real turks ) , but there is another turk explanation ; every citizen of republic of turkey is called turk . 
  and as i know gentleman 's wo n't lie you do ... 
  we will pirate them then !? 
  nobody can stop me from hlaying games what i want . 
  first fact ; bulgarians ( not turkish bulgarians the real bulgarians ) have turkish ancestors ( confirmed on discord of this sub ) . 
  second fact ; kurds on turkey are cleansed so there is n't 10 million kurds , there is n't arabs either nor armenians , i 'm not talking about zaza 's , greek 's , laz people ( idk english of this ) and other people are ghosts . 
  please be human not be b **** sincerely , a guy who hates racists . 
  i wonden why ? 
  what could you tell about turkish people ? 
  we ca n't speak english very well  , i 'm curious . 
  there they are, 
  source ( turkish ) : http://www.internethaber.com/necmettin-yilmazin-babasi-konustu-teroru-bu-babalar-bitirecek-1794784h.htm * this is translation of the page *  ** hamit yilmaz , father of necmettin teacher which got kidnapped in 19 june and killed by pkk , spoke for the first time . 
  **  hamit yilmaz , necmettin teachers father who was killed by pkk and left to the edge of a stream while he was going to gumushane from sanliurfa on school holiday , spoke . 
   father yilmaz , raised his 4 children as a construction worker , used this expressions :  *** `` i do n't have hate against nobody . 
  on my whole life i have never made language , religion or race discrimination and raised my children like that . 
  we have lived as brothers in this country , no matter where we are , and will live as brothers . 
  while working as a construction worker i have shared my food with my friends who came from different places of this country . 
  after going to tunceli i saw help and interest . 
  both in tunceli and urfa siverek this interest was very important , very valuable for me ... 
  i have lost a son but gained thousands of them . 
  my only wish is a brotherhood in this country '' *** * end of the translation * * this part is written by me * so why i have shared this ? 
  as a turkish guy i 'm broken because i 'm always seen as `` killing kurds '' in this sub ( no matter what ) and pkk is seen as `` good kurdish people who are defending themself against turks '' , i want to state that pkk is n't a party ( yet it 's name is ** p ** artiya ** k ** arker\u00ean ** k ** urdistan\u00ea , kurdistan workers party ) , they are killing turks , kurds and other people in turkey . 
  necmettin yilmaz , geography teacher , was there because he wanted to teach children and got killed by pkk . 
  yes turkey is n't doing good things ( such as illegally occupying northern part of roc ) but turkey is n't just evil , my home and home of 80 million , and we are human like you . 
  please do n't be rude against us just because of 1 man . 
  * end of the text * edit : please do n't start downvote brigade against people ( comments i mean ) just because you do n't like their opinion .
