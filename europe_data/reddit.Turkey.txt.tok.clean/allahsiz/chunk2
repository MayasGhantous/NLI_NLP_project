  except for soviet occupation which is to be replaced by american military . 
  they did everything they could to weaken leftism and filled the political vacuum with islamism and islamist elements . 
  and now we have a madman in an illegal palace in ankara and a madman in pennsylvania who have jointly ruled the country for more than 12 years and caused more harm than our enemies could wish . 
   croatian does try to distinguish itself , especially recently , they do have a set of words which are rarer to hear in other parts of ex-yu . 
  that 's what seemed apparent to me . 
  thanks for that reply . 
  loved your little documentary by the way . 
  cheers . 
  it 's the big boy evertan fan uno . 
  could you tell me if those croatian words like nogomet and the ones you mentioned are made up to make croatian seem different from other yugoslavic languages ? 
  we do actually something similar sometimes instead of saying no , so you get close with your tongue , above your teeth , to your lips and then kind of make a smack noise . 
  it is considered rude though if you are not familiar with the persons or if you 're in a working environment . 
  i actually take pride in anatolian heritage and that we embrace the civilisations before us which populated it . 
  will we always get erdo\u011fan jokes as answers . 
  this sub becomes depressively boring , like any real conversation is instantly shutdown by erdo\u011fan jokes and memes . 
  as tayyip said ` democracy is not the aim but a train to be used until you have reached your station/goal ' i clearly remember tayyip on debate programs on telly discussing lgbt rights and making statements which were somehow pro lgbt . 
  since 2011 he 's gone full dictator . 
  i assume that there was somewhat of a conflict of power between him and g\u00fclen at those times , however at christmas 2013 it was clear that he ` defeated ' g\u00fclen and was the lone ruler of turkey . 
   you say that , but stereotypically someone who claims to be an atheist is an insufferable neckbeard . 
  you know that there is a world outside of reddit ? 
  fucking hell , how can people be so short-minded . 
  as a turkish atheist , my stance towards religion has shaped me and the people i connect to in so many different ways . 
  i 'm proud that i 'm an atheist , especially since i was kind of brainwashed as a child which again , shaped my understanding of the world and relationships . 
  i 'm now a free spirit since i 'm an atheist . 
  cause jews are persecuted everywhere , innit ? 
  you 're deluded . 
  jews sought refuge in turkey while europeans were murdering them . 
  it 's not even that deep . 
   palestinians enjoy some of the highest standard of living for arabs . 
  they are even comparably free in their society for the most part . 
  only the ones who are living within israel proper , and even they are not fully accepted . 
  it 's that they are lucky to be citizens of israel . 
  however , you can not say the same for arabs living in occupied territories who are fully under the control of israel , and are dealt with in a horrible manner . 
   the kurds * are * in a lot worse shape than the palestinians ever were . 
  how ? 
  any kurd is citizen of turkey , iraq , syria or iran . 
  they might not have acceptable minority rights , but they are citizens of the respective countries i mentioned before , meaning they have the same rights as any of their fellow citizens . 
  the palestinian arabs in occupied territories do n't have any internationally recognised citizenship . 
   and that muslim 's are n't . 
  that 's not even true .

   how turkey invaded cyprus should have told your cypriot cousins not to massacre my turkish cousins then . 
  turkish forces did not go to cyprus for fun . 
   invaded syria lol , that 's not how it works . 
   invaded iraq turkish forces entered \u0130raqi territories with the permission of krg  threatens to invade armenia lol  threatens to send migrants to eu to disintegrate the eu . 
  that 's something different , tayyip uses his political soft power here . 
  _____________________________________________________ you are trying to create an issue when there is none , turkey and greece will never have a direct clash , especially not on their respective territories . 
  what you , yourself experience is the [ security dilemma ] ( https://www.google.de/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahukewjv_rcr7uvuahvbzlakhsheduiqfggymai&amp;url=https%3a%2f%2fen.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fsecurity_dilemma&amp;usg=afqjcnhdtdv1amcm32mz7r9ytzjsxhyiia ) . 
  let me explain it quickly . 
  turkey , if you look at her surroundings , is a country that needs to be concerned about her security . 
  so turkey buys military equipment . 
  and you interpret it differently , and the rest is basically the theory . 
  the difference is some think it and say it , and some think it and keep it to themselves . 
   why do you think right-wingers debates are no honest ? 
  because the usual claims are absurd . 
  there was even a post on a racist subreddit where people were happy about the grenfell tower fire because the majority of deaths were people of foreign background . 
  am i supposed to have an honest debate with these ? 
  but if you have arguments which seem understandable , then i 'd love to have a discussion with someone who does n't share the same opinion as me , just to see a different perspective . 
  i 've seen for example a documentary of romanian & bulgarian gypsies living in the duisburg-essen area and how the local people are forced out of their areas . 
  we should not whitewash issues as these . 
   there are no-go zones in the sense that no sane person goes there or that the police can only enforce the law with much increased force . 
  there have been reports in germany that police officers were surrounded by dozens of people trying to prevent an arrest . 
  it 's not the same thing . 
  the issue with islam & immigration is , that muslims believe that their values are sacred and they are not ready to adapt as likely as others because they do n't want to give up their sacred values and identity . 
  let 's see if this post will be removed after my comment above , 
   perhaps you should stay away completely if 1 users dumb comment triggers your so profoundly . 
  it 's not one . 
  it 's constantly lots of users mentioning the same things . 
  people who think turkey might invade greek territories need to stay out of political topics . 
  and then there will always be the ones saying ` turkey is n't european , why is it shared here ' . 
  i understand tayyip is a dictator and is taking the country down with him and his followers , but more than 90 % of us turks here are secularists , yet we get so much backlash from certain types of people who do n't know much about turkey . 
  it gets repetitive , and any reasonable discussion is almost impossible . 
  i got called tayyip supporter by four different people when i criticised the dutch involvement in the srebrenica massacre . 
  it 's like people want to shut you down the moment they see your flag , and then your totally reasonable opinion is invalid . 
  centuries long propaganda , that the barbarian turks are coming , and that they need to be ready to defend their motherland . 
  just listen to this , you do n't need to understand greek : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz9_dywttw4, 
   this is pure for invasion tactics against balkan countries . 
  were you raised with ` turks are coming ' paranoia by your parents ? 
  what 's up with this thinking ? 
  the borders have n't changed for almost a hundred years , but some greeks are talking like turks are going to invade them any minute . 
  just fucking chill . 
  my favourite ones are also the ones thinking tayyip is a nationalist , although he 's a populist islamist who 'd sell the whole country if the money went straight into his pockets . 
  why are right-wingers always so paranoid , as if anyone who does n't agree with them are in love with immigration or islam . 
  islam is a shitty religion , and immigration is an issue since it will be hard to integrate people from different cultures . 
  but i have n't seen an honest debate being shut down . 
  it 's idiots like you , usually , who act like this is a communist sub , just chill . 
  this post is obviously mocking the idiots who think that there are literally ` no-go zones ' within western european countries , this idea is usually spread by donald 's followers who have n't set a foot onto europe . 
  do n't be like them . 
  it was in ' 95 . 
  and it was well known what mladic was up to , and what mladic would do with the bosniaks he 'd get into his hands . 
  the dutch had at least partially a responsibility , they were ordered to protect the bosniaks . 
  they did n't fulfill their duty , nevertheless the circumstances , instead they drank rakija and danced with the murderers of 8,000 bosniaks . 
  you stupid mug , translate my username and have another guess , go back to / r/canada, 
  wow you and your fellow countrymen / u/creativename1357 and / u/un-unkn 0wn are a joke . 
  so , any turk who does n't agree with you is automatically a tayyip supporter . 
  well , check out my profile and translate my username , you 'll find out for yourself what my political stance are . 
  my point is that the citizens were under dutch protection , and the dutch handed them over , well-knowing what kind of a person mladic is . 
  they are ( at least partially ) responsible , no matter the circumstances . 
  while bosniaks were murdered this is what kammermans did : https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*ajaw6s3lvu8miaxd6pvu4q.jpeg embarrassing . 
  i 'm very well informed about the case , the nato soldiers were pressured , no doubt .
