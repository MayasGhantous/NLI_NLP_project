  i 've heard more than a couple of times back when he was the interior minister that be\u015fir atalay is of arabian descent . 
  are you being intentionally obtuse ? 
  by your logic the us is also a flawed democracy . 
  i do n't see you complain . 
  how does where he is from determine what culture his parents are descendants of ? 
  erdo\u011fan was born in kas\u0131mpa\u015fa and his parents are georgian muslims from rize . 
  is n't be\u015fir atalay an arab descendant ? 
  and it is n't like be\u015fir is a common turkish name . 
  abdullah is , which i 'm totally ok with . 
  try this one : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqrn540zvf0, 
  there was an ongoing investigation since 2013 into the g\u00fclenist movement , they obviously had the lists previously prepared . 
  i realize that the coup made it easy to justify a state of emergency and the government is utilizing it to get rid of g\u00fclenists . 
  of course from a democracy point of view this is far from being ok , but there is no need to whitewash g\u00fclenists either . 
  they are basically a cult who just tried to pull a khomeini . 
  would you prefer turkey as an islamic republic akin to iran ? 
  because that 's what the coupists aimed for . 
  i hate erdo\u011fan but i would prefer him to g\u00fclen any day . 
   you do realize that most people in democracies really only ever participate by casting a vote , right ? 
  the vast majority of people do n't show up at protests or city council meetings . 
   but some still do , right ? 
  our democracy is weird . 
  we are ok with the fact that the ruling party gets to decide who will be elected into the parliament as mps ; you ca n't just campaign for it , you have to go sign up with a party and start licking asses all the way up to the party leader . 
  they can dismiss you if you do n't do what they say . 
  it 's weird . 
  our system demands strongmen . 
  before erdo\u011fan there was demirel , before demirel there was \u00d6zal , before \u00d6zal there was demirel again , before him there was menderes , \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc , atat\u00fcrk . 
  before atat\u00fcrk there was the ottoman parliament . 
  all strongmen . 
  all elected . 
   assuming what you say is true , is prison the best way of dealing with it ? 
  no , they are arresting them to question them , as they want to lock up the masterminds not the pawns . 
  people are being released every day , over 17.000 released so far . 
   could n't a change in employment laws to protect against nepotism deal with it ? 
  of course !, 
  i 've been arguing this since forever . 
  we need employment laws based on merit not recommendation . 
  there 's a law draft right now to change the laws , hopefully we will not have to be dealing with this shit again if it passes . 
  turkey is special in that in here people want to democratically elect paternalistic rulers , they do n't want to be involved in the whole participation business . 
  they want fair elections and they want to be able to get rid of the rulers if shit starts hitting the fan , but they just do n't want to be bothered with the rest . 
  are you telling me that you can find a similar form of attitude by a majority with regards to democracy in other cultures ? 
  g\u00fclen 's followers vote erdo\u011fan ? 
  even after the corruption scandal they voted erdo\u011fan because the rule of erdo\u011fan basically guaranteed that they keep their government jobs , even if their overlord g\u00fclen clashed with him . 
  are you fucking kidding me ? 
  two of our opposition parties are literally the strongest that they have ever been ever . 
  i do n't see the akp government surviving this . 
  10 years `` did they built any gas chambers in turkey yet ? '', 
  political traditions do not . 
  that 's why you have to introduce `` democracy '' to lands where historically there was no economic classes to produce a bourgeoisie , which would require democracy to give birth to capitalism . 
  which is why me is so fucked up right now . 
  turkey has its own unique democratic tradition that is unlike what is found in the west . 
  it does not follow the same patterns . 
  i am not right-wing either , in fact in your country they would think i am a communist . 
  there are people here who favor coupists over erdo\u011fan . 
  of course i am going to side with erdo\u011fan , what the fuck is wrong with these people ? 
  i believe in democracy and my people elected him fair and square . 
  do you think i will start voting for him ? 
  of course not , he 's a criminal and he needs to be tried after all this is done . 
  but even a stopped watch is right twice a day , these purges had to be done as i explained elsewhere . 
  i would still support them if it was n't erdo\u011fan doing it . 
  their corruption was well known , people did not care . 
  k\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu has been exposing their corruption since at least 2005 , people did not care . 
  k\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu even gave erdo\u011fan the nickname `` prime stealer '' when he was prime minister and called him that for a year . 
  the people did n't care . 
  by your logic erdo\u011fan should declare chp a terrorist organization as well . 
  after 30 days they will be released if there is no evidence , the government said that within two weeks majority of them will be released . 
  your point being ? 
  that actually gave me a chuckle . 
  thanks dude, 
  there were a lot of dissenters who refused to follow orders and they also failed to persuade the generals that they kidnapped . 
  i did n't know our histories and politics are carbon copies of each other . 
  i will quote my comment from [ elsewhere ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4y46nb/turkey_to_release_38000_from_jail_frees_space_for/d6kzhmm ) :  people are obviously concerned , but you must know this cult did a lot of shady things in the past so that 's why people are glad to see them go like this . 
  even my family is a victim of it , my sister was mobbed out of a job she had given 15 years of her life to by these cemaat people . 
  she lost her position and her pension to a headscarfed g\u00fclenist fuck . 
  her replacement had no previous work experience and was a graduate of a g\u00fclenist university . 
    there are a lot of people in turkey in similar situations sadly . 
  so erdo\u011fan is riding on the wave knowing full well that people are going to be fine as long as the purges only target the g\u00fclenists . 
  and they do only target the g\u00fclenists . 
  there was an ongoing investigation since 2013 into the g\u00fclenist movement , they obviously had the lists previously prepared . 
  i realize that the coup made it easy to justify a state of emergency and the government is utilizing it to get rid of g\u00fclenists . 
  of course from a democracy point of view this is far from being ok , but there is no need to whitewash g\u00fclenists either . 
  they are basically a cult who just tried to pull a khomeini . 
  would you prefer turkey as an islamic republic akin to iran ? 
  because that 's what the coupists aimed for . 
  i hate erdo\u011fan but i would prefer him to g\u00fclen any day . 
  it makes no sense . 
  they were in one way or another part of the organization who attempted it . 
  i thought we were a parliamentary democracy . 
  what else would be his opponents ? 
  i believe the majority of people are fine with their newfound `` unity '' . 
  fuck erdo\u011fan , i am not pro erdo\u011fan and i never will be . 
  you people just do not seem to get that people are ok with these purges . 
  from far left to far right everybody hates the g\u00fclenists . 
  nobody is sad to see them go . 
  good riddance . 
  ok buddy , you go listen to your media instead , i believe what you are fed is better than this , uh huh . 
  i do n't see gas chambers around . 
  no , i am absolutely fine with those who think differently . 
  i am an atheist myself in a 90 % muslim country . 
  i only wish jail for the coupists and those who cheated the system and unfairly took the jobs of others . 
  innocent people are being released everyday , according to the government the majority of them will be released within the next two weeks .
