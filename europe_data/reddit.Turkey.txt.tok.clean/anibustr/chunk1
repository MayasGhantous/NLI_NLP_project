they should have done this in [ batman ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/batman_province ) . 
  i agree with your point but it does n't apply to this case . 
  they warn like all the time . 
  this is confirmation bias . 
  that makes no sense . 
  women are n't even supposed to cover their faces , this is a good and needed ban for security reasons . 
  what is a salafist beard ? 
  beard with no stache ? 
  yeah , people think all akp voters are religious . 
  most of them are just ignorant because akp has the media under his control . 
  i 'm fine with gay people . 
  i just hate lgbt . 
  funny how lgbt makes it worse for gay people . 
   turkish people do indeed admire japan because they believe that japan is the perfect example of `` keeping its own culture while developing economically and technologically '' . 
  exactly why i admire japan . 
  also they value respect , i studied with two japanese in college , fuck animes and mangas , i just love their culture . 
  / r/youseecomrade and / r/anormaldayinrussia are pretty good subs . 
  purebreds are really valuable these days . 
  people usually mix some other genes and sell it as kangal , ruining this very handy dog breed . 
  ikr , i hate food threads t_t ^ ^ fuck ^ ^ college, 
  also it somehow does n't taste like pizza at all . 
  but whatever , these are just words . 
  i suggest you befriend a turkish and shop together else if merchants know you 're a tourist they 'll charge you double since you do n't know the local prices . 
  if you know a better price and have some knowledge on what you 're buying you should definitely bargain , you can lower the price a lot . 
  most people are open to bargaining unless you 're buying from somewhere like a supermarket of course . 
  also everyone will try to sell you rugs . 
  so you guys just call it art now ? 
  please do n't downvote me . 
  edit : thank you for gold stranger . 
  how would he know ? 
  he 's a fucked up , murderer , barbaric turk with fucked up moral values . 
  my jam . 
  but the thing is , small number of men producing a large part of children and hypergamy among women , practically might not be related to each other . 
  because a man can get a girl pregnant then that girl can marry another man and have another child . 
  your point assumes that women ca n't have more than one child and ca n't have another one from another man , and denies hypergamy based on that . 
  hypergamy is based on sex , not children . 
  now i 'm not trying to prove trykksak 's point , i 'm arguing that hypargamy does not confirm his data but his data can confirm hypergamy . 
  i ca n't because it does n't claim that . 
  just saying that hypergamy is an existing dynamic among majority of women and that redpiller and trykksak have a valid point . 
  http://pillse.bol.ucla.edu/publications/pillsworth&amp;haselton_arsr.pdf this is a good research if you 're not convinced by anecdotal evidences or your own experiences . 
  hypergamy is pretty real . 
  because * muh female empowerment * . 
  feminists manipulated social ethics by shaming whoever they want and accusing anyone criticizing their views of being misogynists . 
  i do n't know how feminists are happy over marriage collapsing , especially american ones which mostly are way far from being egaliterian . 
  with all aspects , marriage greatly favors women . 
  it is a contract so that if things go wrong , the man can get fucked over to support the woman . 
  if money has to be involved due to stay-at-home women then make it a one time payment so it would n't scare many men away . 
  why are european countries not keeping mosques or any other religious stuff under control ? 
  bind them to a ministry ? 
  gather up ? 
  make your voice heard ? 
  start by informing your neighbours ? 
  make campaigns ? 
  protect mosques from saudi influence ? 
  even voting would help . 
  it 's all about not being harmful and being significant at the same time . 
  western media is a huge influence for the rest of the world . 
  they can use it to a degree aswell if they can make their voices heard . 
  they ca n't really do much if even i hate their pc bs . 
  this just shows that they 're not even willing to fix it . 
  mosques are doing jack shit , they are supposed to be community centers for muslims . 
  i understand , it 's about belief so i ca n't really argue with that . 
  i just do n't like spread of misinformation . 
  dude jizya * literally * means penalty . 
  it 's an extra tax . 
  who will pay for churches and other religious services in * an * islamic state ? 
   according to abu yusuf , jurist of the fifth ** abbasid ** caliph harun al-rashid , those who did n't pay jizya should be imprisoned and not be let out of custody until payment , however , the collectors of the jizya were instructed to show leniency , and avoid corporal punishment in case of non-payment . 
  if someone had agreed to pay jizya , leaving muslim territory for enemy land was , in theory , punishable by enslavement if they were ever captured . 
  this punishment did not apply if the person had suffered injustices from muslims . 
  they were never supposed to be killed , doing so would be against sharia . 
  death penalty is actually very rare in sharia . 
  isis 's so called jihad is n't even right , so what right do they have to demand jizya ? 
  taking it literally does n't mean that . 
  that 's not how salafism works . 
  you still think `` quran promotes violence so salafists must be violent . '' . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/3wn8c6/eli10_what_does_it_mean_to_be_salafi_how_are_they/cxxj456 ) is a good summary if you want to learn . 
   salafists are also muslims that 's why i said extremist salafists . 
  i do n't have a problem with salafists , they have their pros and cons . 
  salafists do n't support violence , the uneducated ones do . 
  quran should not be read without guidance and salafists take quran literally , so when you mix them together it creates terrorism . 
  so you are just * technically * wrong . 
   only two of these links yes i posted them randomly , did n't bother to edit some out . 
  yet some are sources that you can search up yourself . 
  i do n't see anything wrong with the tafsir . 
  have you actually read it ? 
  where does it make it absolutely clear that non-believers should be killed ? 
  it talks about jizyah and calls for jihad , do you know what jihad is ? 
  it has nothing to do with violence . 
  european muslims have so much opportunity to fix this yet they 're silent . 
  they 're too busy being pc and claiming any criticism to be racist instead of explaining the truth . 
  these are out of context .

  it has nothing to do with islam . 
  these people are ignorant . 
  ca n't blame you , that 's how it looks like from westerners ' viewpoint . 
  sharia and islam do n't support terrorism . 
  isis consists of extremist traditional salafists , people that are angry at west and people that are threathened by isis . 
  i blame corrupt saudi arabia for spreading their ways of islam without proper education . 
  if you guys are willing to actually learn instead of hating without facts : [ 1 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/murica/comments/3lv0w4/yesterday_benjamin_carson_said_no_one_of_my/cv9qdsg ) [ 2 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/gew7j/muslim_girl_14_lashed_to_death_for_adultery_by/c1n4gme ) [ 3 ] ( https://norasensation.wordpress.com/2008/10/16/misquoted-violent-verses-in-the-holy-quran/ ) [ 4 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/r0xumfq.jpg ) [ 5 ] ( http://www.aboutjihad.com/terrorism/quran_misquote_part_1.php ) [ 6 ] ( http://quran-errors.blogspot.com.tr/ ), 
  that 's one way to outsmart terrorists .
