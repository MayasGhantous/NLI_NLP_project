   gyros triggered, 
  honestly they do n't look professional at all in terms of harsh politics , you know turks worship balls and they look naive but maybe that 's because i 've never seen them in action . 
  i 'm really curious how things would work out if they were elected . 
  izmir is overrated af . 
  my bad . 
  / r/europe needs to stop taking turkey 's internal politics seriously . 
  paypal will be back next year . 
  told you . 
  hijab ban is as idiotic as not banning burqa and calling it islamic . 
  but people think otherwise , therefore it 's not considered normal and people do n't want it to be considered normal because they do n't like it , logically speaking . 
  the `` issue '' is not whether it 's normal or not , it 's not considered normal . 
  it 's about whether it should be tolareted or not . 
  edit : to clarify , when people push the `` it 's not normal '' argument , they 're miswording social aceptance . 
  yeah , what does turkish know about turkey anyway ? 
  i 'd have state controlled schools and mosques rather than saudi influenced tbh . 
  turkey does n't want to get in the eu anymore . 
  thanks for proving my point . 
  and i said that as a response to his ignorancy about what this purge is and how secular soldiers are returning to good positions again . 
  so yeah , i 've been browsing here . 
  you guys do n't know shit and it 'd be okay if you were n't trying to teach ** people in turkey ** about what 's going on ** in turkey ** and downvote the explanations to bottom . 
   says the man who uses the democracy just to sack all the oppositions at the end . 
  god you guys do n't know shit , do you ? 
  this is called regressive left . 
  absolutely . 
  considering the fact that most muslims have shitty education , it is logical to assume that an average muslim is not progressive . 
  you 're looking for sub-salafi political movements like wahhabism , not shias or sunnis . 
  salafism itself is n't bad if practiced with knowledge , but most people lack the knowledge . 
  its sub-groups are mostly crazy though . 
  agreed . 
  but my point was that , that sub condemns saudis so i do n't see how they are supporting isis-style sharia rules or wahhabism . 
   ... most of them actually support some of isis style sharia rules i hang around there from time to time , this is false . 
  most non-muslims , even a good amount of muslims , have a false understanding of what sharia , jihad , martyrdom etc actually means anyway but i assure you , it 's not in that subreddit . 
  it 's true that they think erdogan is awesome , they do n't know shit about turkey and erdogan . 
  voters are , i doubt the people that left because turkey is a shithole care enough to vote anymore . 
  edit : wording, 
  off topic , but all this talk in this thread about stealing the nukes is pretty stupid . 
  during the lynch video , some of them are calling the soldier `` traitor '' while the rest are shouting at them to stop . 
  just wanted to translate . 
  btw on the 2nd picture , the source says that they killed the soldier by slitting his throat , so he still has his head , as you can guess from the blur . 
  i 'm pretty sure that is n't `` beheading '' , unless they did it afterwards , but the source does n't mention that . 
  theocracy would n't benefit erdogan . 
  you can have democracy without secularism . 
  that would be a very narrow understanding of sharia . 
  not like this . 
  this is worse . 
  that 's not the definition of civil war . 
  why would there be a civil war ? 
  no sane person wants a coup , only edgy kids and some redditors do . 
  you see hans , when you make good arguments , enemy will stop attack , for confusion of poor life choices and bad decisions . 
  what people misunderstand is that , erdogan is not an islamist . 
  he is ** using ** islamists . 
  he is n't trying to turn turkey into iran or something , that would n't even benefit him . 
  from a realistic pespective , lowering the standards of education would grant him more voters , instead of islamising the society . 
  half of his voters are voting because of economical reasons , which actually is n't even the work of his party , he used the investments made by previous governments and now that he 's done with that fiscal policy , he has none . 
  i 'm not following it , not interested in football ^ ^ ^ please ^ ^ ^ mercy but i know that it happened before we lost or something . 
  i think that was for euro cup , unless they did it again . 
  aaand it 's sad news again . 
  easier to control the narrative , just in case if he needs to . 
  great analysis . 
  oh boy , where to start . 
  you are the first person i 've ever seen to make these absurd claims . 
   that 's not true at all . 
  here from an academic article : in 2002 , seven parents were taken to the criminal court in dicle , a town in the province of diyarbak\u0131r , for giving kurdish names to their children . 
  how is 2002 before the rise of pkk ? 
  ... because people are really stupid to not figure this out ? 
  and the fact that kurds were called mountain turks is also unrelated ? 
  rise as in the `` boom '' . 
  it 's obvious that this has been going on for 40 years . 
  kurds are not the only minority in turkey . 
  and that is not a good argument . 
  people were freely speaking kurdish with each other . 
  you can ask anyone that has gone through the coup times about this . 
   most kurds vote hdp . 
  you are wrong . 
  do your research , check the polls , kurds exist in other parts of the country . 
  i wo n't bother with you after this , you clearly have no idea and are just spreading bullshit . 
  also get out once in a while and ask your `` brothers '' , not the ones that are on a list , about who they are voting for and tell them to be honest with you , 
  lol there is urban warfare because pkk is cowardly hiding in the cities , your home is getting destroyed as a result of urban warfare that is happening because of pkk . 
  you are so deluded . 
  they are threathening the local kurds to vote for hdp and support them . 
  the same kurds that used to be under pkk pressure are giving intel to military about pkk locations right now . 
  it 's not ethnic cleansing . 
  go spread your propaganda somewhere else . 
  pkk does n't want those parts of the country to improve , because how else are they going to survive by plundering villages ? 
  racism among people , to be clear . 
  plus that is not a great argument because : 1 ) those restrictions were removed before pkk 's rise . 
  2 ) that law was never put into practice , it was just on paper . 
  3 ) it was n't anything against kurdish , the law stated that only turkish must be spoken . 
  4 ) that law was a result of 80s coup that everyone hates . 
  this gives kurds a reason to support the current state more than anything . 
  in fact they do , most kurds vote for akp ( because how their policy is about reversing the effects of the coup ) and are against terror . 
  we are bombing pkk , not kurds , else my neighbour would get bombed . 
  the events that you call `` crimes '' were in 1930s , against rebellious kurdish groups . 
  i do n't think you have put enough thought and research into your comment . 
  i wo n't carry the discussion further , stay on point . 
  how is this a `` civil war '' ? 
  i 'm really curious about your argument . 
   you have a ongoing civil war in your south-east . 
  with who ? 
  kurds ?
