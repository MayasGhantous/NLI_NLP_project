is it true that i will be shot by a random dude with an m16a4 if i do n't order enough big macs ? 
  `` they are also genociding kurds and the pkk is fighting for their freedom . '', 
  i hate / r/worldnews, 
  thanksgiving much ? 
  there is a similar disagreement about different kurd-related flags here . 
  they are used by terrorist organisations . 
  so if you put one up at your house , are you showing support for the terror groups that kill people , or are you just being part of your nation like any other nationality would with their flag ? 
  i personally think that the flags are okay in both cases . 
  every country has done bad stuff , so if we started to avoid flags we would soon run out of flags . 
  hmmm what do * you * think about being such an asshole to somebody who is trying their best ? 
  do you think it 's worth the hype ? 
  looking at your flair , i bet you ca n't speak ** any ** foreign language as well as op 's english . 
  i think it 's just indirectly . 
  if vikings came from norway and iceland , and there are mountains in norway and iceland , they came from the mountains . 
  new mexico 's is my favorite . 
  my second is arizona 's . 
  ohio 's is also interesting . 
  may will be back next year . 
  she is leaving the debate to come to power later . 
  i think she plaid us ... 
  this government is so good , none of the newspapers are criticizing it . 
  i just spent the last 5 minutes trying to find a way to fit `` core bin '' into a sentence , and i got nothing . 
  may is just so much easier . 
  i just hope she is n't pregnant . 
  it would be a terrible time to go into labour right now . 
  i just think that she may not be a good candidate . 
  i 'm a turkish atheist , and i would love to move to germany  if i may ask : would you want to give me citizenship , or just let me stay until the situation improves ? 
  sorry , i misunderstood the question . 
  my fault . 
  you lose because the other guy 's cousin is the judge 's friend . 
  you want to appeal ? 
  too bad , the other guy knows a guy whose uncle is a friend of the father of somebody in the akp . 
  texas - great food - liberal in the cities , and very conservative in the rural areas - a lot of people are controversially coming from a country to the south - really bad politicians, 
  the second one . 
  some idiot will talk loudly about how the world outside of the cauldron is terrible , and then 52 % of the people inside will agree with him so they will build their own wall around it . 
  there are like 6 people who respond to every thread , and most of them are americans in europe . 
  i voted for somebody else but now he is cooperating with his excellency so i am having second thoughts . 
  demirtas had little chance of winning a seat in the province i was in at the time . 
   i just have a hard time seeing kurdish violence as unjust . 
  i could understand attacking tsk because this is the government that they are fighting . 
  but instead , they build car bombs targeting civilians in ( ironically kurdish-majority ) cities . 
  this is never justified in my opinion . 
  i mean , i hate erdogan even more than they do . 
  but i would never voice this opinion by killing 30 random people who probably do n't even support him . 
  if i went further i might go and attack an akp campaign office , but never random people on the street . 
  during the independence war after ww1 we did n't put too much effort into liberating the rest of the ottoman empire . 
  the rest of the middle east stayed under british and french control and they got their own nations later . 
  now i wish we had all of that oil money . 
  and under secularist policies there would probably be much less conflict there today . 
  every country . 
  so can i just say `` european union '' ? 
  okay turkey is different from the rest of europe in that nobody wants turkish citizenship . 
  i do n't blame them . 
  they have to serve in the military ( ie fight in syria ) in exchange for the right to vote in an election . 
  and it would be bad to be considered a local during the next erdopurge . 
  i think you would get more answers on / r/iwantout . 
  most people there are americans in europe . 
  but from a turkish perspective , the americans living in turkey are great people . 
   how well have you been able to `` fit in '' they will always stick out ( turkish is a hard language to perfect ) , but not in a bad way . 
  nobody would be racist against them , and instead people will be interested in what it 's like living in the us . 
   do you see yourself making a life in the country you reside in what do you mean ? 
  they need to get a well-paying job in order to get a visa . 
   what do you think of the politics of where you live ? 
  the americans and other people from the west are very anti-akp . 
  but it is very rare that they attend protests . 
  the ottoman empire :d if you want a more serious answer : france . 
  first , i am going to say that i 've never done this . 
  i 'm just pointing out how some other people do . 
  -- a lot of turks are pretty nasty in the youtube comments . 
  look at the comments of any popular english-language video involving turkey , greece , cyprus , or armenia ; i guarantee you will find some good stuff if you scroll down far enough . 
  they get into arguments with people from almost all of our neighbours . 
  my favourite is when they write `` k \\* rt '' because they are implying k\u00fcrt ( kurdish ) is a swear word . 
  and then the other side responds by writing `` t \\* rk '' ( t\u00fcrk , or turk/turkish ) . 
  that 's fine . 
  i 'm also worried . 
  but my point is that he is very predictable . 
   unpredictable ** how to predict the turkish president 's next move : ** 1 . 
  what is the situation ? 
  what is the logical solution to the situation in number 1 ? 
  find the opposite of number 2 . 
  this is what reis will do next . 
  see , he is actually very easy to predict . 
   kill turkey or russia . 
  nothing personal , turkey . 
  why turkey ? 
  i want to kill russia , too :(, 
  fuck : greece :d kill : russia marry : azerbaijan, 
  i 've never seen anything like those pictures , but we have our own way . 
  people like to hang flags like [ this ] ( https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/3344c7ad-1312-45d8-869d-80d846fded9a.jpg ) on their balconies and windows . 
  sometimes they get a really big one ( i ca n't find a picture ) that covers some of the windows of the apartments below . 
  if you are in the apartment underneath , it is a really shitty situation to be in because - you ca n't ask the neighbour to remove the flag because he will not . 
  he might even report you to the security services for not wanting this flag . 
  - if you try to get the authorities involved , maybe one day a police officer will come by just to say `` what problem do you have with this flag ? 
  do you hate your country ? 
  stop wasting our time . '', 
  - you ca n't take the flag down yourself because you would be in deep shit if you are caught . 
  i know this from experience :( i was powerless for a month until they forgot about whatever they were celebrating/mourning . 
  we already do that , mostly . 
  in the eu there are large legal trade barriers making it easier to just trade within the union . 
  in turkey it 's much cheaper to just make stuff here .
