you should tell that to u/happyrectangle . 
  cyprus will have reunified by the end of this year . 
  i agree that erdo\u011fan is making the country increasingly more * conservative * , but while that is bad , there is a huge difference between that and religious extremism . 
  nobody wants to bring sharia law to turkey , and however conservative , it will remain a secular country . 
  the main issue about erdo\u011fan is not religion , but his authoritarianism . 
  as a turk my country becoming more nationalistic or xenophobic hardly affects me , but results of a potential rise of religious extremism would be pretty ugly . 
  it shows that we are n't becoming increasingly religiously extremist , just increasingly xenophobic . 
  do n't worry , they did n't do it because the attackers were muslims or they support isis . 
  they did it because it was france that was attacked . 
  it 's been quite a while since when cumhuriyet could last be described as kemalist . 
   to many turks `` the historic truth '' is that they first discovered america and built a mosque there . 
  wtf ?!, 
   hitler was ethnic german * austrians * are ethnic germans, 
  because they were not , and that 's not what they are accused of . 
  they are being accused of being part of the g\u00fclen movement , which , by any definition , is a criminal organization . 
  you people need at least to read [ this ] ( http://drodrik.scholar.harvard.edu/files/dani-rodrik/files/plot-against-the-generals.pdf ) to even start to have an idea who the g\u00fclenists are and what they are capable of . 
   would we have accepted romania if it dealt with its hungarians the way turkey does with its kurds ? 
  last i checked , the hungarians in romania did n't have a terrorist organization . 
   they do n't treat their women like animals [ you 're sure about that ? 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/turkey/7161701/teenage-girl-buried-alive-in-turkey-for-talking-to-boys.html ), 
  each time someone calls erdo\u011fan ' a nationalist ' a part of me dies . 
  * that is not a law , it must be a one-time instance where this was seen as a necessary measure by the officials . 
  * that is not a case specific to kurdish languages , it 's the standard way languages other than the state 's official language are written to the records when an interpreter is not present . 
  * said schools were operating without license . 
  you ca n't get your primary/secondary education in any unofficial language . 
  said english/french schools are universities , and universities where the language of instruction is a kurdish language can be opened . 
  * the text of the vow is clearly written in the law , and if you do n't obey the law you ca n't become an mp . 
  laws can be changed with democratic parliamentary process . 
  i do n't see where the inequality is . 
  * so you do n't have equal rights because your right not to be called turkish is violated ? 
  that designation does n't have an ethnic sense , it 's used to define what citizens of turkey are called irrespective of ethnic or religious background , and to ensure that they have the same rights . 
  it 's a measure against ethnic discrimination , the inequality would start the second you start making different rules for different ethnic groups . 
  exactly what part of what i said is wrong ? 
  that kck was founded by the pkk [ ( 1 ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/group_of_communities_in_kurdistan ) , or that pyd is a part of it [ ( 2 ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/democratic_union_party_%28syria%29 ) ? 
  oh not this bullshit again . 
  ca n't we stop pretending just because there is a chain of command it means there are different organizations ? 
  pyd answers to kck , and kck is another name for pkk , a terrorist organization . 
  it 's that simple , and will remain that simple no matter how many new three-letter acronyms they come up with . 
   more than half of our population is illiterate holy shit you really are an idiot if you think that is true . 
  to make school aged children wear headscarves is child abuse . 
  as for universities , i agree . 
  * kurds already have equal rights , what pkk is asking for is privileges , and we are n't going to treat anyone differently just because they happen to belong to a certain ethnicity . 
  * it seems counterproductive to give complete control of northern syria to a terrorist organization whose main enemy is turkey . 
  it 's a lot more reasonable to let the terrorists have their infighting , so they can be distracted and focus on elsewhere . 
  besides , isis is everyone 's enemy , getting rid of them should be easier once pkk is out of the picture . 
  * we have already seen how we ended up by giving islamists power . 
  there is no ` moderate islamism ' , you either are a secularist or an islamist . 
  * that i have to agree . 
  it was before it was taken over by the government . 
   many hdp pm 's said and did controversial things and some times even supported pkk yes , they did . 
   jailing them is n't the right thing to do . 
  it is . 
   many akp members also praised pkk and ocalan yes , they did . 
   they are free . 
  they should n't be . 
  they are an organization that despite being fully aware of the fact that they would never allow a muslim-majority country in , intentionally never ended the negotiations so they could keep imposing harmful policies on turkey , guaranteeing it never gets too strong or independent for their liking . 
  not quite . 
  the eu * is * a colonialistic christian alliance with crusader mentality , but sensible people here will vote `` no '' regardless , because we 're against a totalitarian conservative dictatorship . 
  atat\u00fcrk was an anti-imperialist leader , he would never consider joining the eu . 
  the [ 2010 constitutional referendum ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_constitutional_referendum,_2010 ) , which reshaped the structure of turkey 's higher courts and basically removed all checks and balances against one-man rule . 
  a referendum the eu ( and the west in general ) supported , i must add . 
  chp never claimed to be pro-european , which is the total opposite of anti-imperialism , which is in the foundation of kemalist ideology . 
  in fact , today 's chp , whose current leadership was installed through a sex tape by foreign factions , is probably the closest the party ever will be to pro-west , and it 's relieving to see that even they have the spine to stand up to foreign oppression every now and then . 
  not true . 
  i am secular and i hate europe too . 
  okay , let 's call it infighting . 
  there 's no infighting within kck , they are one and united with all their wings . 
  pkk , pyd and pjak answer to the same people . 
   neither is turkey fighting isis . 
  then i guess those 50 + turkish soldiers just killed themselves ? 
  last time i checked , ypg was n't fighting pkk . 
  that would be called ` infighting ' anyway . 
  ypg is the armed branch of pyd . 
  pyd is the syrian wing of kck . 
  kck was founded and is run by the pkk leadership . 
  just because there is a chain of command does n't mean the organizations are different . 
   if turkey sorted out every single one of their accession chapters then ** no ** turks would support joining the eu , not even the tiny minority who currently do . 
   which includes sorting out the north cyprus issue which is about to happen in a few months . 
  fuck the eu , we do n't need to be allies with the armers & supporters of the enemies of the turkish nation . 
  we do , however , need to get rid of our current treacherous government , which would not benefit said enemies at all . 
  turkey is not a party to the united nations convention on the law of the sea . 
  fuck the west , and fuck their help to turkey 's ` westernization ' , if you call actively assisting erdo\u011fan 's dismantling of turkey 's kemalist establishment that . 
  i 'm looking forward to the day we get to have our referendum and say a giant `` fuck you '' to all of eu . 
  we never liked you , we never wanted to be allies , and we surely never trusted you , you hypocrite fuckers . 
  atat\u00fcrk was an anti-imperialist , he would never apply to eu . 
  turkey is a unitary state though , while the uk arguably is n't . 
  i agree we would lose nothing and in fact gain a lot by getting rid of them , but this should happen through a democratic process , not through terrorism . 
  if they can get the parliament to agree to that , it 's fine by me . 
  if they do n't , that means they do n't have public support . 
  kurds already have equal rights . 
  the state is n't massacring civilians , it 's combating terrorism to perform its duty of protecting its citizens . 
   kemalist wants hpd to denounce and condem pkk but they do n't want them to be arrested . 
  speak for yourself . 
   chp wanted people realise they were n't pro-pkk chp under k\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu 's administration is pro-pkk , their vice-president is an attorney of pkk militants for god 's sake . 
   eu warns turkey after it violates ~ ~ greek airspace ~ ~ * what greece claims is greek airspace * 141 times in one day ftfy . 
  hating erdo\u011fan not necessarily means being against capital punishment . 
   nationalist kurds ~ ~ , left-wing and centre to centre-right turks and others ~ ~ will vote against it . 
  islamist kurds , conservatives , erdo folks , ~ ~ and maybe some of the ~ ~ centre-left nationalist turks * , left-wing and centre to centre-right turks * will vote for it . 
  ftfy, 
  irrelevant , since they were also turkic symbols .
