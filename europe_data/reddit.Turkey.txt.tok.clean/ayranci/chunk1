freedom of speech ; the right to a fair trial ; revising terrorism legislation to better protect minority rights - these are just some of the criteria demanded by the eu of countries before it lifts visa requirements , even for short-term travel . 
  i did n't know these were among the criteria . 
  if they are , i would actually prefer it as a turk if the eu insisted on those ; freedom of speech and rule of law are more important to me than being able to visit europe without a visa . 
  but are those really the criteria for lifting visa requirements as the article says ? 
  i mean , eu granted visa-free travel for uae , when uae routinely flogs people for premarital sex and alcohol consumption , it tortures dissidents , homosexuality and apostasy are punishable by death , etc. 
  that 's the date of release . 
  it 's not like they polled 65 countries on that date . 
  here is the link quoted on the image that probably nobody bothered to type : http://www.wingia.com/en/news/two_global_leaders_with_very_different_global_perceptions_top_leaders_of_the_world/336/  the field work was conducted during september 2015 - december 2015 . 
  i was wondering why the daily isis-bashing by diyanet made the front page , so i clicked comments . 
  man , i was in for a surprise . 
  [ original source for turkish speakers ] ( http://www.trtturk.com/haber/gormezden-mevlit-kandili-mesaji-169335.html ) his message is that isis is causing more damage to islam than some cartoons . 
  he is saying that muslims should be more offended by the presence of muhammad 's name on a terrorist organization 's flag than muhammad 's cartoons . 
  i am not a fan of his , i remember him saying some stupid stuff , but he is entirely spot-on here . 
  i added clarification to the title as it does n't mention location and would n't make sense in this sub . 
  also , this is the image mentioned in the article : http://www.diken.com.tr/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/gollum-erdogan-240x300.jpg, 
  [ google translate ] ( https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf8&amp;prev=_t&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=tr&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/haber/turkiye/438521/erdogan_icin_gollum_yargilaniyor__bilirkisi_bile_atandi.html&amp;usg=alkjrhiok8czrx2uy45b1d7lb8p2tlnooa ) since google translate sucks for turkish , let me translate and summarize the article : a doctor shared a meme on social media that likened erdo\u011fan to gollum , when surprised , happy and eating . 
  erdo\u011fan sued him for up to two years in prison . 
  it turned out that the presiding judge have n't seen the movie , so he decided to seek expert opinion . 
  he petitioned the court to form a board of experts consisting of behavioral scientists , psychologists and tv/cinema experts , to determine whether gollum is a bad character . 
  the defense lawyers say `` we think such images must be considered free expression , in accordance with echr rulings , but apparently judges no longer decide on that basis , so we are trying to show that gollum is not a bad character as the prosecutor is trying to portray . '', 
  the accused doctor said `` i hope gollum acquits from the case , along with me . '', 
  the image he shared : http://www.diken.com.tr/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/gollum-erdogan-240x300.jpg, 
  ah , i see you are not familiar with erdo\u011fan logic . 
  when the wiretaps were released , he accused g\u00fclenists with both tapping his secure phone line , and staging a completely fake conversation , at the same time !, 
  and regarding how they faked it , he claimed that the wiretaps were both dubbing ( meaning someone imitated his voice ) and montaging ( different speeches fused together ) at the same time like it makes any sense . 
  when the son of one of his ministers was busted with a lot of cash , he claimed it was a set-up and the police put the money there , and later he had the court return the seized money to him !, 
  when journalists uncovered turkish intelligence was sending arms to syria ( which he claims to be for syrian turkmens ) , he sued journalists for both publishing a fake and fictitious video denouncing the government and for espionage/disclosing government secrets at the same time . 
  ( sort of reminds me the old joke : soon when someone calls him a moron he will get 2 years in prison for insulting him and 10 years in prison for disclosing a state secret . ), 
  he can say absolutely anything , no matter how self-contradictory , and get away with it . 
  dude , wiretaps on his massive corruption and his efforts to censor press has been leaked and he did n't resign . 
  he would n't step down if it turned out that he personally drove a truck to raqqa , paid al-baghdadi himself in cash , had a few cold beers with him , loaded a few barrels to his truck , returned , told bilal how to sell them in very simple terms and did that all in front of a camera . 
  well , the beer part may cause some problem with part of his electorate , but he would deny everything categorically , blame g\u00fclenists for staging it , have the people who uncovered it all arrested for espionage and sue a few random journalists for good measure ; and his popularity would remain unscathed . 
  there is no question that he is an extremist , and he used christian symbolism as i said ; but i find it hard to call him a christian extremist when he repeatedly told that he is not a christian and that he even despised christianity . 
  i can see how you could fit him into a more extensive definition of the term ; but there are plenty of people who do or believe stupid things directly because they are a staunch believer of a religion , and i tend to prefer constraining the term to those . 
  well , turkish coffee was renamed to greek coffee in greece after 1974 , so why not change it to `` russian delight '' ? 
  or even `` greek delight '' , just to annoy turks even more :d another funny anecdote is , olivier salad is russian salad in turkish , but during the cold war it was often called american salad as an euphemism , as the restaurant owners did n't want to sell damn commie food . 
  it is usually russian salad now , but we can always retaliate by changing it back to american salad . 
  most people opposed turkey being directly involved against isis because everybody was well aware how isis could retaliate . 
  turkey has been unable to seal its southern border in the last 30 years despite all its efforts against pkk , and it wo n't be able to do it against the isis . 
  and not a lot of people need to cross the border , all it takes is a few people for isis-style attacks ; and turkey is much more in danger than france and germany because of its land border . 
  call it selfish , but people care much more about what might happen to them , than all the brutalities and killings happening in a different country . 
  anyway , the [ suru\u00e7 bombing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_suru\u00e7_bombing ) happened , immediately after which turkey started to bomb isis itself and allowed the us to use turkey for bombings . 
  [ ankara bombings ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_ankara_bombings ) occurred soon after , and no doubt more will follow . 
  in any case , isis will continue attacking turkey anyway , so there is no point in allowing some nato countries to bomb isis through turkey and not others . 
  turkey is in deep shit regardless , thanks to the brilliant foreign policy of akp . 
  well , it 's natural . 
  the us has already been using the nato 's incirlik air base for bombings . 
  i did n't even realize france was n't using it . 
  all nato members bombing isis should be allowed to use that if they are n't . 
  i am more curious how france was bombing isis until now . 
  did they fly from france over the mediterranean , bombed isis , and returned to france every time ? 
  or do they have another base nearby that they can use ? 
  i 'm not sure whether you are referring to breivik or mhp by `` our nationalists '' , because you are obviously a turkish speaker but i noticed you just changed your flair to sweden . 
  ^ ( ( i know breivik is norwegian . 
  ) ^ ) in either case , i am not trying to portray mhp in a positive light or anything . 
  it 's just that they are not islamist . 
  yes , they use muslim imagery as it is one of the defining features of the turkish identity . 
  it 's not unlike breivik 's use of christian symbolism . 
  it is as wrong to call them islamists for that as it is wrong to call breivik a christian extremist . 
  mhp idolizes pre-islamic pagan turks as well . 
  nationalist islamists also exist , their party is called bbp . 
  meral ak\u015fener is a woman and she does n't even wear headscarf . 
  electing her as the next leader would n't exactly be a great indicator that mhp is islamist . 
  how is mhp islamist ? 
  their base consist of a spectrum from religious to irreligious , but religious does n't equate to islamist and their leadership can not be called islamist by any stretch . 
  same for hdp . 
  yes , they have some deputies like altan tan , but it would be very wrong to not consider the party secularist as a whole . 
  akp can certainly be called islamist in some ways , but if you are going to put it as `` defend secularism '' , not even akp opposes secularism of the state either . 
  they can be called islamist in that they want islam to have greater influence in the public sphere , such as this case at hand . 
  edit : and since you brought up mhp , let me append [ this survey ] ( http://www.taraf.com.tr/akplilerin-yarisi-komplo-teorilerine-inaniyor/ ) here , party | secularists | islamists | do n't know --------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- akp | 52.1 | 32.9 | 15.0 chp | 92.7 | 4.8 | 2.5 mhp | 90.1 | 5.6 | 4.3 hdp | 55.3 | 36.9 | 7.8 sp | 23.8 | 64.3 | 11.9 total | 70.6 | 19.3 | 10.1 these results are very scary by the way . 
  i would n't have thought one thirds of akp voters are against secularism . 
  and even more scary is the change from last year ; the article says their previous poll found the division as 85 % secularist - 9 % islamist in total , so almost a 15 p.p. 
  change . 
  anyway , what i was saying is neither the leadership nor the base of mhp is any less in favor of secularism than chp . 
   they explicitly said they simply want erdogan to have more power . 
  just to correct that small mistake , this last election was remarkable because they carefully avoided saying that . 
  the previous election was all about presidential system ; erdo\u011fan kept attending rallies although he was not supposed to and talked about how he should be given more powers . 
  not only they missed the threshold for amending the constitution , they lost the parliamentary majority . 
  this election erdo\u011fan had much less visibility , and they tried to not bring up a system change as much as possible during the campaigning . 
  they did that because all polling companies indicate that vast majority of people , including a lot of akp voters , are against such a change . 
  people vote for akp for various other reasons . 
  yes , greece claims 10 miles of airspace , and the rest of the world recognizes only 6 miles , equal to their territorial waters as dictated by the icao statutes . 
  how does this mean supporting our dictator ? 
  i do n't know why people are looking at it that way ; visa exemption is usually not related to a country 's administration or human rights situation , but to its economic status and how likely it is for its citizens to try to immigrate to eu by coming on a tourist visa . 
  i mean , uae routinely flogs people for premarital sex and alcohol consumption , it tortures dissidents , homosexuality and apostasy are punishable by death , etc ; and uae citizens can go to eu without visas . 
  if , by `` the turkish state wants something '' you mean a specific person and not an anthropomorphism , then why not use that use that person 's name so that your sentence will be a tangible claim and we can ask for a source ? 
  do you mean erdo\u011fan wanted to imprison him for 7.5 years ? 
  source ? 
  davuto\u011flu wanted to imprison him for 7.5 years ? 
  source ? 
  erdo\u011fan almost completely subdued the judiciary in the last few years and no prosecutor in this country would dare prosecute him or his accomplices ; but neither he nor does anybody else control whom every low-level prosecutor in turkey prosecutes . 
  and as i said , he does n't need to ; prosecutors are already competing with each other to file ludicrous lawsuits all over the place and appear as pro-akp as humanely possible . 
  before erdogan the executive did n't have such a direct influence on the judiciary . 
  the prosecutors and judges still did stupid things , because of the erroneous mindset they had , that their duty as judges and prosecutors is to protect the state and not the individuals . 
  initially [ akp was complaining about this mentality as well ] ( http://www.zaman.com.tr/yorum_yorum-doc-dr-mustafa-sentop-hakimin-onceligi-devleti-korumak-degildir_619788.html ) , as they did n't take over the state institutions yet . 
  now they embraced it , and further moved to directly influence judiciary in unprecedented levels since the single party era , except for the junta periods . 
   if you live in turkey , you know why they really are jailed . 
  they are in jail because erdo\u011fan 's regime undermined the separation of powers and judicial independence , especially thanks to the [ 2010 referendum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_constitutional_referendum,_2010 ) . 
  nowadays getting promotions for judges and prosecutors is dependent on how pro-akp they are seen . 
  this prosecutor started the case against him no doubt because that would help his career in the future .
