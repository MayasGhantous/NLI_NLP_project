  he would never do the same for the akp deputy , for example , [ who said the exact same thing . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y2a6ibljs8 ) how is feeling sorry for the death of the police officer is nationalistic ? 
   you showed no proof for anything besides turkey 's claims [ * excessive maritime claims : third edition , by j. ashley roach , robert w. smith :*] ( https://books.google.com/books?id=wviyaqaaqbaj&amp;pg=pa347&amp;lpg=pa347&amp;dq=most+countries,+including+the+u.s.+do+not+recognize+the+10-mile+airspace.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rdtgt7djoq&amp;sig=082t2oqtlmc53aaoqizrdzgjicm&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewix_5oy8bhjahwbfz4khypydiyq6aeiezaa#v=onepage&amp;q=most%20countries%2c%20including%20the%20u.s.%2c%20do%20not%20recognize%20the%2010-mile%20airspace.&amp;f=false )  greece claims a 10-mile airspace around the aegean islands . 
  most countries , including the u.s. , do not recognize the 10-mile airspace . 
  the general rule , which most countries , including the u.s. recognize , is that airspace should be equal to the territorial sea . 
  greece claims a six-mile territorial sea around its aegean islands . 
  there is no dispute , not in the slightest , that greece 's claims are not recognized by other countries . 
  you did n't even dispute that , and keep repeating your and the greek government 's opinion , which we already know . 
  i guess you just want to be the last person commenting in this discussion . 
  fine , do that , i wo n't reply to you ; unless icao changes its statutes , the greek government 's claims will remain unrecognized by anybody regardless . 
   the turkish state wanted to imprison him for 7.5 years . 
  `` the turkish state '' is not a single person . 
  a prosecutor sued him . 
  it would indeed be a gross human rights violation if he was sentenced , what he said was definitely free speech . 
  the state should not go around punishing people for making positive remarks about terrorist organizations , be it pkk , al-qaeda or isis . 
  he should n't be sued in the first place . 
  ( edit : in case people imagine i have illusions that there is complete separation of powers in turkey , not at all . 
  this prosecutor sued him with the full expectation that it will help him with his future career , and it probably will . 
  he would never consider suing an akp deputy [ who said the exact same thing ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y2a6ibljs8 ) , for example . 
  i am merely pointing out his oversimplification and usage of language for propagandistic purposes . 
  there is no `` turkish state '' that wants to imprison him ; there are even those in the `` turkish state '' who share his views and would themselves go to jail if he is to be imprisoned . 
  a prosecutor suing someone is not synonymous with `` the state '' wanting him in prison . 
  prosecutors ordinarily sue akp deputies as well , although that will make it harder for them to get promotions in the future . ), 
   now he 's assassinated in broad daylight . 
  we are talking about the head of a bar association being shot in public while making a statement to the press . 
  what a fucking disgrace . 
  i was wondering why you did n't mention the police who died trying to protect him and other two that were wounded , and presented it as if he was left without protection . 
  then i saw your comment below saying you did n't care about the life of the police officer and were n't sad for his death . 
  you sound like disgusting person for saying that , but at least have some respect for him for dying while trying to prevent this murder , if for nothing else . 
  but i guess mentioning his death would n't conform to the turn of events that you were trying to convey in the first two paragraphs . 
   sputniknews who were remarkably quick to cover the assassination , but apparently they are deemed unreliable by this subreddit . 
  sputniknews is not a reliable source for anything anyway , but it does n't take a great mind to know that anything they write about turkey at this moment will be completely biased . 
  i do n't know who killed him and who are responsible for it . 
  nor do you . 
  you may have your opinion on it , but please do n't try to push your views in such a biased fashion and have some respect for the police officer who lost his life and and do n't scorn him . 
  on the contrary , he should be your hero if you cared about this lawyer 's life at all . 
  one of the footnotes detailing the historic background of the case mentions the date 1936 . 
  i do n't know how you imagine that helps you . 
  i showed you with proof that nobody recognizes greece 's airspace claims . 
  not in 1936 , but today . 
  you have n't demonstrated that a single country other than greece recognizes greece 's claims . 
  go ahead and continue believing what your government is telling you . 
  i 'm sure all of the world other than greece misunderstands the international law , and you are the only ones who understand it correctly , yes . 
  the date 1938 is not even mentioned in the book . 
  i do n't think anybody can be that retarded . 
  you are deliberately lying , but the only question is why you are lying when your lie is so obvious to anyone who bothers to click to link . 
  turkey does n't claim anything . 
  it is greece vs. rest of the world . 
  the fact is , as of 2015 , nobody recognizes greece 's airpsace claims . 
  and you know it . 
  get as salty about it as you like . 
   you 're quoting a book from 1938 i was n't going to reply , since you started talk about completely irrelevant stuff as the facts in this case are indisputable , but i could n't restrain myself against such grade-a bullshit . 
  where the fuck did you get the idea that the book is from 1938 ? 
  it says '' ** leiden , boston , 2012 ** '' on its second page as the date of publication . 
  i sincerely tried to understand how you could say such a stupid thing , and looked for anything that could mislead you , there is absolutely none . 
  hey kom\u015fu , let me give you a source : [ * excessive maritime claims : third edition , by j. ashley roach , robert w. smith :*] ( https://books.google.com/books?id=wviyaqaaqbaj&amp;pg=pa347&amp;lpg=pa347&amp;dq=most+countries,+including+the+u.s.+do+not+recognize+the+10-mile+airspace.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rdtgt7djoq&amp;sig=082t2oqtlmc53aaoqizrdzgjicm&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewix_5oy8bhjahwbfz4khypydiyq6aeiezaa#v=onepage&amp;q=most%20countries%2c%20including%20the%20u.s.%2c%20do%20not%20recognize%20the%2010-mile%20airspace.&amp;f=false )  greece claims a 10-mile airspace around the aegean islands . 
  most countries , including the u.s. , do not recognize the 10-mile airspace . 
  the general rule , which most countries , including the u.s. recognize , is that airspace should be equal to the territorial sea . 
  greece claims a six-mile territorial sea around its aegean islands . 
  the overall aegean crisis is more complex than that , but the fact is , these violations are not actually violations under the international law . 
  except both greece and turkey violate each other 's undisputed airspace as well ; i guess they both secretly enjoy this conflict and are having their fun . 
  some do and some do n't , but even turks who do n't feel european are most interested in europe . 
  before the syrian crisis , world news here basically meant european news , save for a few america related articles . 
  actually , considering we are historically related and geographically close , i was surprised how disinterested and isolated we were with the middle east and asia . 
  personally , i would hang out on / r/europe and it would n't even cross my mind to go to asia or middle east subreddits ( if they exist ) , as that feels more natural . 
  i can easily show luxembourg on a map or recognize the monaco flag . 
  actually it is surprising that when i see [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_indonesia.svg ) i would go `` hey , the flag of monaco '' , rather than indonesia , even though they have a ten-thousand-fold population difference . 
  i would have no idea about most asian affairs , but i would get the reference if a hungarian got salty about transylvania . 
  ( possibly i know too much about romania 's regions anyway . 
  high school history class : treaty of something , dated xxxx : wallachia and moldavia changed hands . 
  another treaty dated xxxx : it changed again . 
  and again . 
  i really wonder if they make romanians memorize those dates lol . ), 
  actually turkey is building [ a nuclear power plant ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/akkuyu_nuclear_power_plant ) , but , funnily enough , it is being built by russia . 
  i do n't know if it is still a go at the moment . 
  there is also [ a planned one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sinop_nuclear_power_plant ) to be built by japan . 
  they are also building dams like crazy and funding other renewable resources , but realistically turkey will always need russian gas and arab oil in the short and middle term . 
  oh yes , of course , that 's not what i meant ; they knew it was almost certainly a russian plane . 
  russia has been violating turkish airspace for a while , they shot it down with the expectation that it was a russian plane . 
  i was just answering who else could it possibly be . 
  syria also flies russian aircraft , including the type that was shot down ( su-24 ) , by the way . 
  i do n't see why anyone would be offended by that . 
  yes , we do n't use it that way in turkish , but in english that usage is normal . 
  t\u00fcrkiye meclisi would often be translated as turkish parliament , t\u00fcrkiye ba\u015fbakan\u0131 as turkish pm , etc. 
  personally , i even prefer it sometimes , at least it does n't get the bird jokes . 
  i would n't mind making it the official name , like france , italy , etc. 
  the funny thing is , russia is currently building [ a nuclear power plant ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/akkuyu_nuclear_power_plant ) in turkey . 
  if they are so crazy , they wo n't even have to take the risk of nuking a nato country , a simple `` accident '' will be enough . 
  if the turkish government 's past incompetence is any indication , an accident would occur even without russia 's malice though , lol . 
  now maybe it will be canceled because of this . 
    1 ) russian jets have been violating turkish airspace for the past 3 months . 
  there is a limit to how many times you can break international law . 
    2 ) russian jets ignored every warning given to them , and did not once reply to a request to `` go south '' immediately . 
    allegedly . 
  what do you mean allegedly ? 
  russia did not even deny those airspace violations . 
  in one of the cases [ they claimed it was due to `` weather conditions . 
  '' ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34453739 ) and [ others heard turkey 's warning as well ] ( http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/261198-obama-turkey-has-right-to-defend-its-airspace ) . 
  there is nothing alleged here . 
  syria has n't been flying there because turkey declared they would shoot down in the case of an airspace violation and indeed shot down a syrian airplane for that .
