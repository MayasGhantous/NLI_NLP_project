   you have your side and the greeks have their side but i heavily doubt either is right . 
  this is exactly what i 've been saying . 
  but , as you can see from upvoted and downvotes in this thread and every thread , this sub refuses to recognize that turkey also has a valid case in the dispute . 
  a comment that states the obvious fact that most of these violations are not actually violations according to turkey and most of the international community gets hugely downvoted . 
  a submission that describes the great number of airspace violations by greece is instantly downvoted . 
  only greece 's one-sided view is accepted . 
   i heard also that there are rumors of turkey going over the 12 miles rule in the black sea . 
  you realize that beyond 12 miles is the international airspace , so every country , including turkey , has the right to go over that , right ? 
  i just explained to you why greek claims are illegal by giving a source . 
  they are violating icao statutes and most countries recognize it as such . 
  if you want to ignore the facts , well , suit yourself . 
  otherwise what you said is correct , both greece and turkey sometimes violate their recognized 6 miles airspace . 
  turkish airplanes are sometimes forced to do that though , as greek airplanes engage in dogfights with the turkish airplanes that fly in the international airspace near the greek airspace , locks on them , harasses them , etc. , forcing them to perform maneuvers and making it impossible to follow their course . 
  when greek airplanes violate the turkish airspace , however , they do it deliberately , just to annoy turkey . 
  turkey does n't harass greek airplanes flying in the international airspace , and it does n't claim international airspace for itself , unlike greece ; so they could easily follow their route and not violate the turkish airspace , if they wanted . 
  i am afraid greece is the only bully in this case . 
  turkish airplanes , as well as airplanes from every country , have the right to fly in the international airspace ; and greece has been trying to bully them away in its effort to claim that airspace for itself , by intercepting , dogfighting , and otherwise harassing them .

  most countries , including the u.s. , do not recognize the 10-mile airspace . 
  the general rule , which most countries , including the u.s. recognize , is that airspace should be equal to the territorial sea . 
  greece claims a six-mile territorial sea around its aegean islands . 
  most countries do not actually recognize greece 's claims , and very few of these ` thousands of ' violations are actually violations of the internationally recognized airspace . 
  in this sub often the greek claims are endorsed because turkey is usually seen as the aggressor , which admittedly has some historic reasons ( we screwed over a lot of countries in the past ) , but on this issue , turkey has , at the very least , some valid points . 
   ok , i 'll rephrase to `` turkey is the only non-failed state , non-isolationist regime with high seas access that is not a party of unclos '' . 
  there are countries that do n't conform to either criterion who did n't sign it , not to mention those who signed but not ratified it . 
  you should rephrase it to `` turkey is the only state except for the ones that are n't which i choose to ignore . '', 
   turkey would never even have the right to object to that , given that they have no jurisdiction at all on this zone . 
  please do not offend our intelligence by presenting this as a concession . 
  yet currently greece can not expand it at this zone because of turkey 's objection ( casus belli ) , am i wrong ? 
  i did n't mean to present it as a concession , i was trying to say an agreement through mutual compromise is possible ; but if your attitude is `` i am completely right , the only deal i 'll agree to is if the other side accepts all my demands '' , yeah , there is no point in negotiating . 
  we will just continue the dogfights and arms race until one side runs out of money . 
   western european countries applied the same policies without posturing , declarations of `` casus belli '' , or threats . 
  they had conflicts of interest on other issues . 
  they know too well taking a self-righteous attitude ignoring the other side 's concerns and acting unilaterally is not a good idea . 
  i guess you support such a unilateral act by greece , and possibly it would happen if turkey 's casus belli was n't in place . 
  so i guess it served a good purpose ; without it , greece would have done it , turkey would n't recognize it , which would lead to confrontations by the armies . 
  considering turkey and greece ridiculously almost went to war over imia/kardak , they may have very well went to war over such an issue that is much more important . 
  regarding your other points , as this will be my last reply ( i do n't intend to spare more time on it ) , let me turn to realism . 
  in the treaty of lausanne , turkey renounced all possible rights and claims to most of the aegean islands . 
  the aegean sea remained mostly neutral . 
  then , in 1936 , greece expanded its territorial waters from 3 to 6 miles , which turned most of the aegean sea into greek waters . 
  turkey did n't protest , as at least that left some open areas . 
  now greece intends to turn all of the aegean into a greek sea . 
  how on earth do you expect turkey to accept that ? 
  i get that greece wants to do that , it is natural , each country wants to better its position or preserve the status quo if that is not possible . 
  in the last century something that would force turkey to settle for anything less than the status quo did n't happen . 
  if greece wants to improve its situation at turkey 's expense , it will either need to offer something to turkey or fight for it . 
  otherwise the status quo will be preserved . 
  that 's the most basic law of international relations . 
  turkey is under no obligation to give up its right to use aegean sea just because some other countries signed a treaty among themselves that turkey does n't recognize ; and greece has no right to restrict activities of turkish ships in places where they were previously unrestricted because it signed a treaty with other countries . 
  if it wants to change the situation with turkey , it 's going to have to deal with turkey . 
   we use the internationally agreed definition ( which every state on earth except turkey does recognize ) and you ignore it just cuz .

  greece claims a six-mile territorial sea around its aegean islands . 
   * excessive maritime claims : third edition , by j. ashley roach , robert w. smith *, 
  it is legal as long as it coincides with the territorial waters . 
  which is why greece 's position about the airspace is not legal . 
  if you want to talk about the territorial waters instead of the airspace , nobody said 12 miles is n't legal . 
  greece could legally expand its territorial waters , if it was n't for turkey 's objection . 
  turkey opposes greece changing the status quo unilaterally because it would adversely affect turkey 's interests , not because it is illegal to expand the territorial waters to 12 miles . 
  and like turkey , greece can expand its territorial waters in the seas other than the aegean ; there are no affected parties that object to changes in those places as far as i know . 
    the territorial waters in the aegean has been 6 miles ,  that is the turkish government 's claim , not some kind of recognised fact . 
  really ? 
  you will still insist on this silly error ? 
  is it so hard to google ` greece territorial waters ' ? 
  i do n't know what to say , or if there is any point in continuing to reply to you , if you are immune to facts . 
  ( edit : i just saw your other reply , i guess you did n't see my edit while writing that . 
  i imagine you retract this part . ), 
   turkey is the only state with a coastline that is not a part of unclos . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_parties_to_the_united_nations_convention_on_the_law_of_the_sea )  it would be idiotic for greece to put what international law states is a basic right of every state to negotiation . 
  not to mention that i honestly doubt , given the current political climate , that these agreements would be anything resembling equitable . 
  i think an agreement is very well possible . 
  i imagine turkey would n't have a problem with greece increasing the territorial water limit to 12 miles in the western aegean , as long as greece does n't completely block turkey . 
  it would be idiotic for turkey to accept a unilateral change to the status quo by greece as well . 
  currently parts of the aegean are international waters ; turkey uses those waters and needs those waters . 
  if greece will act unilaterally and take over these waters , then i guess turkey will reasonably want to take back some eastern aegean islands to preserve the status quo and its access to the aegean sea , it 's as simple as that . 
  or , you know , it would be better to preserve the status quo , or negotiate it if a change is to occur as the western european countries came to learn , instead of squabbling to no end . 
  but of course , that 's not the true balkan way ; both sides are indisputably on the right and there is nothing to discuss . 
  1 ) i did n't downvote you ; and 2 ) in case other readers want to follow the discussion , i replied to your other comment [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3u229m/turkish_f16_shoots_down_a_warplane_on_the_syrian/cxbbdst ) . 
  unclos is about the limits of territorial waters , not national airspace . 
  do you want to discuss the whole aegean dispute here ? 
  first of all , both greece and turkey are part of icao , but turkey is not party to unclos . 
  you are accusing turkey of not conforming to a convention it did n't sign , and see no problem with greece disobeying statues it is part of ? 
  the territorial waters in the aegean has been 6 miles , and turkey has been opposing increasing that to 12 miles because that would encircle all of turkey 's aegean coast with greek territorial waters and block turkey 's access to the international waters there almost completely . 
  i find those concerns very legitimate , and if the territorial waters in the aegean will be changed , it must be done through agreements between the two parties ; greece should not do it unilaterally , which is what turkey is saying . 
  edit : you rewrote your comment while i was replying . 
  i wo n't bother to change my reply , but i must say i am disappointed . 
  you initially looked like you were slightly informed about the subject . 
  now you edited it to make the claim that greece claims 10 miles of territorial waters . 
  greece 's territorial waters has been set at 6 miles since 1936 , as you can see from greek ministry of foreign affairs website , or really any source about the subject . 
  i do n't know what led you to make such a ludicrous claim . 
  yep , again , coincident with the internationally recognized territorial waters , as required by the icao statutes . 
  it does n't , actually . 
  greece does . 
  turkey claims a national airspace of 6 miles , same with its territorial waters , and everybody agrees . 
  greece , however , claims a greater national airspace of 10 miles , larger than its territorial waters , which is 6 miles . 
  that is in violation of civil aviation statutes and it is not recognized internationally . 
  and yet you purport that it is turkey that claims airspace , and get upvoted for it .
