  most ( not all ) major revolts up to that point were either by turkish/turkmen folks in anatolia and middle east or by the military ( jannissaries ) . 
  speaking of jannisaries , though , up to 18th century , they were chosen from - mostly balkan - christian kids , converted , raised and educated intensively for military ( and also government ) positions . 
  this practice called `` dev\u015firme '' and also the harem points to a rather unique dynamic compared to the other empires . 
  it initially appears to be a horrible practice , taking kids from minority families at a small age and forcing them down a certain career ( and converting to islam too ) , but then again , come to think of it , it means that the ottoman army , highest government officers , most artists and scientists and sultans ( through their mothers ) mostly ended up being of non-muslim and balkan origins . 
  it created a very unique elite and was very inclusive ( in a twisted way ) of its new subjects . 
  so it 's certainly a very different ( wo n't opine on better/worse ) relationship with the subjects compared to the colonization practices of the other empires . 
  ahh , i see . 
  thanks , 
  that 's really interesting , thanks !, 
   to `` schind '' someone to death nowadays means to give someone else so much work or such a burden to bear that he 's slowly grinding him or herself to death . 
  did schindler 's list have an obvious reference to this that i missed or is that a twisted coincidence ? 
   ... germany , which has a rigid system where you 're usually supposed to be on a last-name basis with people until you 've become `` good friends '' so with acquaintences as well ? 
  that sounds too ... formal . 
   so when people chant , say , hamit alt\u0131ntop 's name , is `` hamit '' all they say ? 
  yes , unless they need extra syllables for the chant :p it 's not just soccer either . 
  in professional life , your boss is firstname bey/han \u0131m , not mr. / ms. 
  your teachers are firstname hoca , not mr. / ms. 
  lastname ( unless they 're english teachers ) . 
  this may be why people could go wild with their surnames when they were asked to come up with one , because getting rid of their original familial titles would n't be as confusing as it would be in the west . 
  i 'm only coming to this realization now , though , 
  interesting , why would n't the emperor grant them land in , say , croatia ? 
  was n't that region also controlled by the austrian empire ? 
  dogs ; \u00c7omar is a typical name but owners do n't tend to go with typical names so i do n't know if it 's popular . 
  cats ; minno\u015f , but varies a lot by colour - typically pamuk ( `` cotton '' ) if white , zeytin ( `` olive '' ) if black , duman ( `` smoke '' ) if gray , sarman if yellow , tekir if tabby etc. 
  i 'm aware of this  the patronymic names are a natural way of keeping record . 
  it 's interesting that given a free choice , the majority wants to change that though ( some did n't , a lot of '' - o\u011flu '' with names and occupations still around ) . 
  the choice of names probably has a lot to do with the fact that the country was only 11 years out of a war of independence with rampant nationalism . 
  my own last name is disturbingly and aggressively nationalistic as well . 
  i 'm actually not sure how surnames used to work in europe . 
  from my limited knowledge in history , for the ottomans , the patronymic references were not set in stone like you would expect a last name to be . 
  nicknames were prevalent as well to tell people apart , but i 'm not sure whether any of that was official . 
  people were usually referred to by their names plus their title like bey ( mr. ) , han\u0131m ( ms. ) , pa\u015fa ( general ) , doktor etc. 
  edit : i 'm going to add that the name has always been more important than the last name , in modern turkey as well as the ottomans . 
  it becomes more obvious if you 're familiar with soccer . 
  the most common way to refer to the players is by their first name , with perhaps an additional nickname or last name if there are two players by the same name on the team or field . 
  the exception is foreign players who are called by their last name as they 're famous by that name . 
  so what 's up with the croatians in hungary ? 
  long-term remnants of the arpad dynasty or just regular neighbor affairs ? 
  turkey goes for nouns and adjectives more often than the `` son of '' format as well . 
  the top 20 go `` undaunted '' , `` rock '' , `` iron '' , `` falcon '' , `` steel '' , `` star '' , `` lightning bolt '' , `` true turk '' , `` enlightened '' , `` true iron '' , `` lion '' , `` hawk '' , `` sword '' , `` lion ( diff . 
  spelling ) '' , `` arduous '' , `` black '' , `` ram '' , `` wolf '' , `` true blood '' and `` lightning '' . 
  i thought it was the curry powder that was invented for the long journeys of the british , not curry itself . 
  what does koupepia mean then , etymologically ? 
  yes lots of common items between cuisines . 
  i have to admit though that every single meal i 've had on the greek islands have been better than the ones i 've had on the turkish shores ( not counting istanbul ) . 
  except for ouzo . 
  rak\u0131 trumps ouzo every time :p, 
  must try/most disgusting combined : people avoid [ tavuk g\u00f6\u011fs\u00fc ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tavuk_g%c3%b6%c4%9fs%c3%bc ) at all costs when they find out what 's in it , but it happens to be my favorite desert and i would personally suggest you give it a go . 
  it 's chicken breast pudding , which is a thick pudding made with milk , sugar , rice flour and , well , chicken breast . 
  traditionally served with cinnamon . 
  [ here 's how it looks . 
  ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kgari2fqt0q/t_qvarzqfai/aaaaaaaaang/hxu5tu-okto/s1600/tavujk44.jpg ) avoid at all costs ; tavuk d\u00f6ner ( chicken * doner/shwarma ) sandwich + ayran ( salty yogurt drink ) all for 1tl . 
  * : it 's not . 
  that indian dishes lacked sauce and consisted entirely of dry roasted meats and veggies sounds extremely unlikely to me , especially considering the word itself comes from the tamil word `` kari '' meaning sauce . 
  i 'm open to being convinced otherwise though . 
  is the name koupepia specific to cyprus ? 
  in greece and greek restaurants here in canada i always see them referred to as dolmades ( dolma in turkish as well , as you might now ) . 
  you do n't seem to be alone . 
  googled dropjes , [ this ] ( http://stuffdutchpeoplelike.com/2011/10/25/dutch-licorice-drop/ ) is the first thing that comes up . 
  oh yeah , i was n't discounting westernization as part of the reason . 
  it just seems less whimsical a change than before now . 
  are the fenno-ugric languages mutually intelligible at all , written or spoken ? 
  that makes so much sense . 
  it 's so obvious now that you say it , but because the reason that keeps getting repeated is `` uhh arabic script was hard to read , so we just changed '' , i always thought it was a weird change to go through with a shaky reasoning , just to look westernized . 
  i feel slightly embarrassed for not figuring that out earlier now . 
  i tried helping a friend with her turkish homework once , and realized that , to a person who does n't have a natural intuition for it , vowel harmony can be utterly confusing and frustrating . 
  it just sounds like a random set of rules made to confuse new learners . 
  i was n't referring specifically to the protest with my apology , just the course of the debate in general makes no sense imho . 
  if people have a problem with it , they can protest peacefully to their heart 's content and that would never have made the news with the intensity that it has in this case . 
  it 's the turkish government 's involvement that escalated it . 
  citizens of netherlands , whatever origin they are of , should deal and solve their problem with the dutch government , especially with an issue of this nature . 
  this should not be an international matter . 
  it disturbs me that this is taking up way too much space in the turkish media as well . 
  it 's not like homophobia is nonexistent in europe though . 
  it 's not so much an inherent cultural thing but rather a matter of how conservative and religious the population you 're dealing with is , which also has a moderate correlation with socioeconomic status . 
  it does n't matter what the religion is either , it 's not like christian conservatives are all supportive of homosexuality . 
  i was going to say it was n't that black and white even with the economy , but then i saw your flair . 
  good luck there . 
  cheers . 
  just as recent developments ( i 'm not going into press freedom and other major long-term problems ) ; - possibility of ceasefire with pkk ( kurdish terrorists/rebels/guerillas / lookhowpoliticallycorrectimbeing ) tomorrow as their imprisoned leader is scheduled to make a public speech on newroz . 
  negotiations have been going on , it 's not really clear what 's on the table so people are worried the state will compromise too much . 
  - several former high ranking military officers , elected mps and a journalist are in trial for aggravated life sentences for an alleged coup attempt , and it 's been an extremely controversial process with shaky evidence . 
  they 've been in prison for the past 5 years waiting for the trial to end , and the final dictum of the prosecutor demanding life sentences has only been released a couple days ago . 
  - there 's also syria , with the government supporting fsa and the opposition supporting assad . 
  there are a huge number of refugees , a significant number being members of fsa , and border control is a joke at this point . 
  - just yesterday evening there was a twin bombing ( 2 wounded ) in the akp headquarters and the ministry of justice . 
  it 's unclear who did it but it 's being blamed on a fringe marxist group who are supposedly being supported by assad . 
  i 'm sorry that you guys need to deal with this as our government needs an outlet for the people 's built up steam due to recent intense developments in the country . 
  i do n't suppose this would 've gotten this big if erdogan did n't squeeze a netherlands visit just for this in his tight schedule and if he did n't take it upon him to concern himself with adoption policies of another country . 
  he 's also made some really radical remarks on secularism and islam in the past . 
  he 's not as radical as he used to be , but i 'm just saying he 's quick to change his mind whenever it suits him . 
  akp 's current stance on gay rights is to oppose even the slightest mention of it in the new constitution . 
  that 's also mentioned in the article you linked to . 
  his positive remarks are from a time when he was trying to prove he had changed . 
  someone who tries to prove they 're white thinking it 's somehow going to make them better is just as stupid as those who expect that proof and i 'm not going to play by your rules . 
  i ca n't change your entire screwed up world view in a comment thread , so go play in your own corner with your friends at / r/whiterights . 
  not male either , actually . 
  i do n't care what your definition of white is , but skin colour-wise i 'm just objectively not brown . 
  i have no conception of `` white '' as being superior or something to strive for , and your blatant racism is disgusting . 
  just to reply to your original comment , not that any of this should make any difference ; i 'm not a muslim , not in europe , not brown , and not a criminal .
