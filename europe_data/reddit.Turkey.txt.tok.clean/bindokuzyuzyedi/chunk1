nah that would be boring drive , i will just stick with [ these ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0y7nzmcr8s ) . 
  the bosphorus strait of istanbul is 1 km wide , here it seems 250 km, 
  actually 38 %, 
  i am talking about roma people of turkey . 
  it 's not easy to differ them from indians . 
  the clothes , public constipation , their looking . 
  they are n't really religious . 
  it is written as - cik,-c \u0131k , - cuk at end of words to make it little in turkish but this ` c ' pronounced as ` g ' of germany . 
  so ` dzh ' probably equals to ` g ' in bulgarian sound . 
  it 's weird that russian has similar suffix . 
  i wonder which one is copy other lol, 
  i found some bulgarian origin common words : bg  tr * vi\u015fna  vi\u015fne * kva\u00e7ka  kulu\u00e7ka * krumpir  kumpir * vuynik  voynuk etymologic research of your words : * \u00c7orap  means socks , from persian * yorgan  means quilt from old turkic language `` yogurkan '' * b\u00f6brek  means kidney from old turkic language `` b\u00f6grek '' * \u00c7e\u015fme  means fountain from persian * sarma  means grape leave dish from turkish verb `` sarmak '' = to wrap * k\u00f6fte  means meatballs from persian * b\u00f6rek  means turkish dish , from turkish verb `` b\u00fcrmek '' = to twist all words are whether turkish or persian , 
  ok , for sake of being half pomak , i will learn 100 bulgarian words and one meal from bulgarian cuisine . 
  i hope it 's enough to have good coinscience . 
  i laughed because bulgarian authority did n't bother to change its name , but probably because of muslim community there . 
  i could n't find the place you mentioned above . 
  pazardzhik itself means `` little marketplace '' in turkish lol . 
  saudi arabia funds mosques throught europe and its wahhabism that creates huge extremism . 
  do n't let them if you have any chance . 
  btw recently i 've found out that actually i 'm half pomak by paternal side ( yes , i 'm 23 lol ) how are pomaks doing in bulgaria , are they extremists ? 
  are they just muslim bulgarian or different ethnicity than bulgarian ? 
  i do n't think this decision against turkish community , since it 's almost non-existent for thracian turks to have full-face veils , right ? 
  actually it 's surprised me how roma people follow conservative form of islam . 
  here they have very strong own culture and religion is n't really part of it . 
  it seems they have n't changed since departure of india, 
  ok my mistake . 
  it could be both tak and isis, 
  only killing [ herself ] ( https://twitter.com/hacer_merve17/status/725347190013612032 ) [ nfsw , violent content , +18 ] , and nobody else . 
  the bomber is most probably kurdish tak member , since isis do n't use women and do n't attack next to sunni mosques . 
  yes , but is it really true ? 
   the borders between europe and asia are historical , cultural and political more than physical . 
  yes , and this historical , cultural and political [ map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/europe_polar_stereographic_caucasus_urals_boundary.svg/2000px-europe_polar_stereographic_caucasus_urals_boundary.svg.png ) drawn well before . 
  i would simply define european as the * local people * who has been in this continent for centuries . 
  from this definition , albanians , bosnians are definetely european . 
  a good question can be ask to author of this writing . 
  if albanians and bosnians are n't european , then what are they ? 
  i 'm sure they wo n't fit any definition of other continents , so will we consider this area 8th continent ? 
  the countries are included , kosova seems 3-10 % , albania seems 10-20 % , bosnia seems 40 % european but only christian minorities counted as european . 
  that 's what i question . 
  i liked how they excluded bosnians , albanians , kosovans , turks and azeris in the big map but later included adding a small patch to bottom-right . 
  ok i can define turks and azeris only 1/3 european but bosnians , albanians , kosovans ? 
  are n't they fully european ? 
  ** clapping ** thanks !, 
  sure , you should start from your ` jerusalem ' lol, 
   maybe i should visit . 
  yes , you should and tell me if you ever come izmir , we have a flat to host and an archaeologist to show you around lol you are right , humans tend to give meaning to everything . 
  maybe it was his weird palate . 
  hopefully you can come here also to see with your own eyes , great history . 
  but bread and wine seemed a bit tasteless to me . 
  i doubt if there is any meaning of this combination . 
  it 's amazing you can understand it over 2300 years and the writing is still valid in this century . 
  i wonder if this writing intelligible for today 's greeks . 
  is there anyone here ? 
  ** istanbul ** : - [ kad\u0131k\u00f6y ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20chiex751q ) is the town where fenerbah\u00e7e football club located . 
  it 's my favorite town although i do n't know if i 'm objective lol . 
  it also gets very lovely [ after snowing ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxxabsfwz50 ) . 
  municapility of the town works with some professional graffiti artists to turn ugly walls to [ great work of art ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q525u25h9be ) . 
  - [ the bosphorus ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xevqh1x2j7a ) is strait that connects mediterranean sea with black sea and geographically end of europe . 
  - [ 4 seasons of istanbul recorded from mosque 's minarets ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3m9cpvdtki ) ** mu\u011fla ** : [ fethiye ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z4e0mhb6zi ) is one of top touristic destionations . 
  the video shows some screens from istanbul too . 
  this is what happens when you stop buying things from turkey which is vegatables , fruits heaven and processed food industry giant . 
  homosexuality is n't my field both personally and professionally . 
  so i ca n't show anything about it . 
  some animals even try to have sex with humans , occasionally . 
  so you might be right . 
  i have no idea . 
  i should n't have fed the troll . 
  ( you ), 
  well , actually they can be homesexual . 
  since visiting holland would cost me a kidney . 
  personally , i will only bother greek islanders by my presence starting from the island which is 7 km far from my city . 
  but i 'm sure turkish football fans would literally invade a dutch city if our teams match at champions league or europe league, 
  wait a minute . 
  we wo n't need visa soon and americans and canadians will apply for visa to visit eu . 
  did i understand clear ? 
  it seems biggest lack of education curriculum . 
  almost everyone is economic illiterate including myself . 
  i only have superficial knowledge about forex , treasury bond , repo , stock exchange , mortgage , credit rating , central bank interest rates . 
  those actually affects all of our lives . 
  i do n't know why this is n't a mandatory class in schools . 
  i am about to make a conspiracy theory that someones do n't want us to learn these lol, 
  purchasing power means ` sat\u0131n alma g\u00fcc\u00fc ' . 
  a good example to tell , average swedish and norwegian earns a lot of money but everything is so expensive there . 
  so they ca n't actualy buy goods as much as it seems . 
  why do n't they just cover his eyes and shot on head with proper military way ? 
  i 'm sure iraqi kurdistan can be better ally for turkey than europe , so i 'm in . 
  i 'm almost sure that / r/europe is hacked . 
  erdogan should answer with this [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psfmlkijgty ) . 
  i 'm sorry but if justice has n't been done , then laws of jungle works . 
  there will be always people like these with sick mentality . 
  the problem is the lack of commonsense in society and failed system . 
  since our courts do n't function to punish her for hate speech , i really hope mossad take care of her . 
  easy boy !, 
  1993 , best year of my life . 
  sorry , i misunderstood your idiom previously i 'm drunk lol good business model . 
  i will visit that damn trinity collage library one day . 
  brace yourselves , end of june , 2016 , we are coming , 
  everybody should proud of themselves , whether european , african , asian whatever . 
  turks do n't pretend to be european . 
  most of turks say `` we are partially eastern ( central asian + middle eastern ) partially western ( european ) '' .
