  even if you look at only geographically , that 3 % is most significant area by population and economically . 
  moreover , as you know cyprus is 100 % asia but belong 100 % european culture . 
  so the country in eu . 
  israel is 100 % asia , but partly european culture so israel attend many european activities such as eurovision , uefa etc. 
  in short europe is n't only geographical term , it has political , economical , historical meanings . 
  look at the map of nato ( european part ) and eu . 
  you will see much similarity . 
  also you ca n't write europe 's history without turks , almost all of people i know in my city are european exiles from greece , bulgaria , macedonia etc. 
  my ancestor lived there 500 years . 
  we changed eachother . 
  however even if you do n't accept turkey as part of europe , it does n't change the fact turkish people are part of / r/europe . 
  and as i said if you distinguish people ethnicly , these ethnicities has to qualify to be part of europe to be here . 
   btw , this holiday is n't just followed by kurds , it 's also a holiday celebrated in albania , russia , azerbaijan and georgia . 
  all these countries are classified as european according to / r/europe . 
  so the submitter should have used one of these language to congratulate and refer to these people instead of kurds and iranians . 
  all lives matter , every european citizen is newsworthy in / r/europe with no doubt . 
  however , when you distinguish minorities as ethnic cultures , you 'll get that kurdish culture is n't part of turks ' national identity , just like catalan culture is n't part of spaniards ' identity . 
  but there is difference . 
  catalans are part of europe even if you consider distinctly , even if catalonia become independent . 
  but kurds are not european , let 's say kurdish majority area seperated from turkey . 
  will kurdistan be considered as europe ? 
  no , just like iraqi kurdistan is n't part of europe . 
  so kurds can be newsworthy in / r/europe as turkish citizens , not distinctly with their language , culture etc. 
  not being european is n't something ashamed of though . 
  they should be proud of being 100 % middle eastern and share their beautiful culture with other middle eastern people elsewhere . 
  big loss for europe from economic and intellectual perspective . 
   ... including the conflict with the kurds . 
  if everyday there are posts in here about kurds in turkey then i ca n't think of any reason why you 're against a post about the kurdish new year lol , there are posts about isis terrorists who blow up themselves , fire people with ak47 in europe . 
  so will we include every culture that makes news in / r/europe ? 
  even turks ' europeanness is highly controversial and now you want to add kurdish , iranian culture to europe . 
  you should defend europe , european culture before living under tribalism and sharia law . 
  just saying ... 
  well , you can look at the map on right-top then you 'll see why you see daily posts about turkey . 
  clearly turkey is part of / r/europe . 
  european part of turkey has 10,620,000 population which is 150k less than whole greece . 
  also economically 39 % of turkey 's gdp produced in european side . 
  so why not ? 
  as culture , turks can be considered ** partially ** european , not all european . 
  we are actually a third european , a third central asian and a third middle eastern . 
  but kurdish and iranian people has 100 % middle eastern . 
  that 's why this post has so much downvotes . 
  you are confusing xenophobia with classifying correctly . 
  nobody here has been harsh toward your culture . 
   `` this helps germans understand our culture and see we are normal people '' says sepher , 36 , from iran [ al jazeera ] your link actually disproves your statement . 
  germans try to understand a culture which is not ** german ** , nor ** european **, 
  196 nations of total 196 in the world , live in europe today . 
  in your perspective , every cultural activity in the world is topic of europe . 
  well it is n't and it has nothing about ` xenophobia ' . 
  being xenophobic would be not letting an iranian , kurd to comment in this subreddit . 
  however as far as i know , every human being is free to comment here about europe , ** european culture ** . 
   what are / r/europe 's rules ? 
  - disallowed submissions : non-european news and politics - the largest subreddit for these topics is / r/worldnews . 
  i found this [ photo ] ( http://img.cdn.turkiyegazetesi.com.tr/images/haberler/2016_03/buyuk/pkk-nin-bruksel-deki-cadiri-bosaltildi-1458295497.jpg ) is from ` place jean rey ' you can look at [ google street ] ( https://www.google.com.tr/maps/@50.8404143,4.3801267,3a,81.9y,76.1h,92.97t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s06zmjr1zohf1cisa0wybww!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1 ) . 
  since you are from belgium , you can confirm whether the photo taken in brussels or not , right ? 
  i can also confirm the two flags on the tent represent pkk and photo of \u00d6calan . 
  so actually we do n't need additional sources to decide . 
  turkey is well aware that it does n't have any soft power on europeans , in fact many nations in europe openly hate turks . 
  so it 's not surprising to see their support for pkk . 
  you can search about arrestion period of pkk leader \u00d6calan , also france 's support for asala in 1980s , and current clowns in your parliements . 
  i am just saying newton 's third law `` for every action there is an equal and opposite re-action . '', 
  yes i accept , but i did n't understand how did you extract this from my previous comment lol, 
  that 's even worse . 
  pkk which is a terrorist organization recognized by [ usa ] ( http://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/other/des/123085.htm ) , [ eu ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/pdf/?uri=celex:32015d2430&amp;qid=1457362568874&amp;from=en ) , [ nato ] ( http://www.nato-pa.int/default.asp?shortcut=241 ) , builds a [ tent ] ( http://i.hurimg.com/i/hurriyet/90/620x350/56ea7bef67b0a93ac4d0b6aa.jpg ) in brussels and you ca n't find anything on major media . 
  how can one be sure next time turkey to share information about a bomb in belgium ? 
  yes , trees do n't die in a short time in cold like animals . 
  however since there are seasons , the cold last a few months and they 'd die . 
  in northern turkey during winter , municipalities cover palms with jute fabric , and cover soil with something called ` toft ' around root at least for first 10 years . 
  i 've heard zakopane a lot !, 
  turkey lost most of historical buildings due to wooden structure like japan , korea . 
  so wooden historical buildings amaze me a lot . 
  cracow looks really amazing . 
  i would also love to see teutonic castles , i played against a lot in age of empires ii lol . 
  thanks for informing me . 
  you are precious !, 
  there was even a tv show called `` alanya almanya '' . 
  alanya is one of east side town and almanya stands for germany in turkish . 
  can you tell me top three destionations for poland ? 
  great work of art !, 
  as far as i know , palm trees do n't grow and even die below zero celcius . 
  so it 's also exotic for turkey unless very close to sea . 
  though [ these ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/14951202.jpg ) are from my city , izmir . 
  i always wanted to see poland , especailly raciborz lol . 
  i will visit this palm tree too . 
  it 's all ` relative ' , that 's problem . 
  they mary with relatives and have childred with 11 points less iq on average then normal couples . 
  then , the children do n't have ability to think ` radically ' to change this culture so this goes as vicious cycle . 
  then , some westerners say kurdish culture is most progressive in middle east lol, 
  just a provocative comment passing through ... there are many kurdish villages in turkey where everyone has same last name , meaning they are all married with relatives . 
  hahaha lol in turkey there is no such problems . 
  because they even divide the city . 
  germans usually book in eastern antalya , russians prefer western antalya . 
  what 's that supposed to mean ? 
  lol say it in turkish amk, 
  still better than russians . 
  they speak english better , they obey the rules better , they spend more , they do n't have superiority complex etc. 
  i wish ... 
  i will be able to enjoy my country at least half-price . 
  german vs russian tourists in turkey g : eat all the food they took from open buffet r : eat at most half of the food g : do n't speak loudly in public r : speak like through a megaphone g : say ` guten tag ' to barman in the breakfast r : ask for vodka g : take photos of historical sites r : take photo of themselves in front of hotel sign and palm trees g : praise the taste of fruits & vegatables of turkey r : say `` these are better grown in russian farms '' g : say `` it 's too expensive '' r : say `` you fob us off , these are x price in russia '' g : complains to tour company even for a small mistake r : would complain anything if get $ 10 g : can listen tour guide more than three hours r : do n't even let speak the tour guide g : ask whether the hotel contain russians firstly to not book r : ask whether the hotel is ` all inclusive ' g : play the worst beach volleyball r : rock the beaches so the answer is russians probably . 
  though they wo n't come here for next three years . 
  turkey wants to join eu to develop economically .
