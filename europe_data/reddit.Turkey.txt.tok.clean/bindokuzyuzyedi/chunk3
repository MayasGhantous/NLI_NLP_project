  so when we are developed enough to join eu , we will draft eu application . 
  that 's the simplest way to tell why turkey will never be part of eu . 
  either *, 
   there were turks . 
  no , there were ` muslims ' . 
  look at the all formal documents , all muslims ( turks , arabs , kurds , bosnians , albanians , arabs , circasians etc. ), 
  considered one nation and first class citizen in ottoman empire . 
  the others classified with their ethnicity ( greek , jew , armenian etc. ), 
  and they had lower rights , in return not attending the army . 
  that 's why muslim ` armenians ' and ` greeks ' did n't attack their country during the ww1 and during the population exchange with greece and turkey , muslims ` greeks ' came here and christian ` turks ' went greece . 
  ottoman sultans only had two turk mothers since 1500s so the dynasty was n't turk either . 
  there were a lots of military officials from other ethnicity in eastern turkey , especially kurds and zazas . 
  so you ca n't blame only turks even if your claims was true . 
  moreover , it 's already too wrong to accuse a nation about anything that time . 
  there was zero democracy . 
  for example , i 've met many israeli friends , and they mostly had positive views of germans . 
  they even want to immigrate germany for better life . 
  because they are aware it was the nazi party who commited the holocaust . 
  some of armenians like [ this guy ] ( https://vimeo.com/158575938 ) is also aware of situation but they are minority . 
   hahaha oh god , trying to get off on a technicality ? 
  nobody says `` you just made flatulence ! '', 
  instead of `` you just farted ! '', 
  right ? 
  because flatulence is a medical term and should be used correctly and cautious . 
  it 's same with ` genocide ' . 
  but if you trust in yourself , the international court located in the hague , netherlands which accepts applications from individuals too i guess . 
  go there and sue turkey with genocide . 
  if your claims win , i will sue greeks over troy . 
  although the incident gave us a great movie , it was so sad experience for me while i 'm their in their ruined city . 
  also i think every country in asia should sue mongolia since they were pretty brutal during [ 1300s ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/mongolempiredivisions1300.png )  is that how a lot of people in turkey think ? 
  i do n't have any negative feeling toward armenian people . 
  in fact i want to eat their foods since they actually took from turkish cuisine like : karn\u0131yar\u0131k , dolma , mant\u0131 ( different than turkish mant\u0131 though ) , sarma , lahmacun , baklava . 
  but about public view , it may be worse than you think . 
  people of eastern turkey still ca n't forget what armenian militans did to their ancestors during ww1 and unfortunetely they still hate armenians . 
  however i believe armenians can live a normal life in western turkey . 
  so i want armenians of exile to have citizenships and come here to live . 
  if you are armenian , please do n't hate turks , turkey . 
  just build a bridge instead of wall like pope said . 
  this hate , anger makes you feel worse and in fact it damages armenians themselves mostly . 
  especially the ones who live in armenia . 
   no wonder the country is so screwed up . 
  it 's actually quite nice to living here . 
  turkey is really pretty and has very diverse climate , flora . 
  yes we have a lot problems but it definetely worths living here . 
  if you want to see positive things about turkey to balance your views : [ 1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tvlme1-574 ) , [ 2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_83kzcorja ) , [ 3 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fy-9woyy-7s ) , [ 4 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z4e0mhb6zi ) , [ 5 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmualqaxb0q ), 
  two drilling machine are working upstairs , i ca n't think of clear lol yes her name is [ seher \u00c7a\u011fla demir ] ( http://linetv.com.tr/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/seher-765x510.jpg ) and she is kurdish origin university student . 
  it 's a male name . 
  i like bbc , but the telegraph and dailymail are disaster . 
  i feel better thank you . 
  first of all , there was n't turkey before october 29 , 1923 . 
  if you have a right to accuse turkey with committing ` genocide ' then turkey also have a right to control all these areas on the [ map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/ottomanempirein1683.png ) so the topic here is ottoman empire and not turkey . 
  i do n't know which country you are from but yes , ottoman empire was very strong empire which is built over blood of humans . 
  however , you can see many similiraties with other empires in history . 
  if you wonder which was the most evil , you can watch this [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ighbyjtoo4 ) btw , genocide is a jurisprudential term created by raphael lemkin in 1944 . 
  the united nations approved the convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide on december 9 , 1948 . 
  so noone can be accused of genocide before 1944 legally . 
  that 's why it 's noted : `` while many cases of group-targeted violence have occurred throughout history and even since the convention came into effect , the legal and international development of the term genocide is concentrated into two distinct historical periods : the time from its coining until its acceptance as international law ( 1944 -- 48 ) and the time of its activation with the establishment of international criminal tribunals to prosecute persons responsible for committing it ( 1991 -- 98 ) . '', 
  you do n't need to glorify them , calling them ` rebels ' give them legitimacy in some level . 
  as an 100 % secular person , i am against erdo\u011fan naturally . 
  but erdo\u011fan was even late to answer pkk 's voilence toward taf ( turkish armed forces ) and the police . 
  pkk broke ceasefire more than hundred times . 
  turkey condoned these attacks with hoping to kurds to stop their support over pkk and start only support their legal political party hdp . 
  but it did n't happen . 
  pkk actually benefited ceasefire to gather more terrorists and they even [ killed soldiers during civilians ] ( http://i.ajanshaber.com/2/700/525/newsfiles/2014/10/25/133010/133010.jpg?v=1446140161 ) , [ they shot two police from neck during sleeping ] ( http://i.sozcu.com.tr/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/22/polisler-orta.jpg ) and [ a list ] ( https://www.uludagsozluk.com/k/s%c3%b6zde-%c3%a7%c3%b6z%c3%bcm-s%c3%bcrecinde-ter%c3%b6r-eylemleri-listesi/ ) [ in turkish ] that shows total attacks from pkk during so-called ceasefire . 
  all agreed , thanks for the weird music . 
  i guess i am a bit old for this song ( p.s i 'm 23 ) :d, 
  well technically , there is no country classified as ` terrorist ' nor any law about it . 
  so your claim pointless . 
  nato has declared many times about right to selfdefence of turkey . 
  now after russia runs out the money , they are drafting from syria . 
  i really wonder who will save terrorists from tuaf . 
  during these operations civilians will loose their lifes unfortunetely . 
  turkey 's mission is to minimize the civilian casualities . 
  that 's why the country developed low collateral damage missiles like ` cirit ' . 
  i just expected more clear , solid statements from someone who is really direct and right-brain person like you . 
  it 's okay let 's ditch this topic anymore . 
   we , european media , use him to explain ( brainwash ) to our citizens why turkey has no chance to become part of the eu . 
  you can start with why turkey would be in eu before why not . 
  turkish people are probably a third european , a third middle eastern and a third central asian culturally . 
  how can we adapt european culture in very short time . 
  it 's imposible . 
  also , i think cons dominates pros for eu countries . 
  so your leaders are either wasting our time for their benefit or pure unwise . 
   tell me , which president , the public , speaks about his own failures at first ? 
  we can take japan as example , they admit their failures mostly . 
  some of them even suicide after a failure of their responsibility . 
  a japanese engineer committed suicide after cables broken on a bridge under construction in turkey . 
  i can only guess which groups of kurds you speak of . 
  but , one can think turks are against all kurds from your speech . 
  it 's also almost all foreign media journalists ' problem . 
  i doubt if they ever been in the middle east or if they know about historic clashes between groups . 
  to be honest , i also blame our government which is responsible to tell the world the truth . 
  but the world does n't care what they say since their anti-democratic , islamic attitudes . 
  i do n't think turkey should be in eu or any close relationship . 
  so i 'm totally fine with your or any european to be pure logical , zero emotional . 
  there is a psychologic phenomenon that when you have superficial knowledge about some people you ca n't differentiate the individuals & groups inside those people . 
  since you call ` kurds ' , it proves that you are victim of this phenomenon . 
  kurds are at least 6 separate groups in 4 countries . 
  those separate groups speak 4 different strong dialacts that one ca n't understand other . 
  so first of all you should n't use term ` bomb kurdish places ' in the first place .
