  four days ago turkey gave $ 200 million to autonomous kurdistan of northern iraq . 
  so as you can see , turkey has nothing against all ` kurds ' in principle . 
  turkey against pkk and ypg , and well aware of the danger of live-bombs terrorists . 
  yet , if turkey stops involving in syria , northern syria will be new pkk stronghold like the one in mountains of northern iraq . 
  but unfortunetely current government lacks the capability on strategic issues like military & intelligence . 
  so we 'll suffer much more these terrorists . 
  also i do n't expect condolences from regular citizens of europe like you , because i am well aware that we do n't have emotional tie with you . 
  i also could n't empathize when bataclan incident happened before . 
  it was n't different for me than this happened in nigeria or syria . 
  so i 'm not mad at you . 
  not really surprised , but i 'm sure that western media will continue to label pkk as ` rebel ' instead of ` terrorist ' , although pkk recognized as terrorist organization by eu and nato . 
   ottoman turkish was almost a combination of arabic and persian . 
  the ottoman turkish you talk about is a type of written language developed around the palace . 
  there were other types of written language also without arabic , persian and french . 
  two popular examples are : yunus emre ( 1238-1320 ) , \u00d6mer seyfettin ( 1884-1920 ) . 
  however 95 % people were illiterate , and even the padishah himself was n't talking like how he writes , obviously . 
  so the topic is about spoken turkish language . 
   are you saying that the majority of ottoman citizens knew turkish ? 
  i said `` there were many jews , armenians , greeks of anatolia who are bilingual . '', 
  many does n't means majority and anatolia covers roughly 5 % of ottoman empire . 
  even today , some of children of the people who left turkey , can speak turkish . 
  look [ grandson of greeks who left tr ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoal6h_x1-q ) , [ karaman originated greek woman ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnuyiuzmds4 ) , [ hemshin armenian from kazakhstan ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pblhkqtr5i )  there wasnt even 1 unified turkish language , the turkish tribes in the rural areas spoke dialects of turkish and not the formal ottoman turkish language . 
  even in today 's turkey there are dialects with thousands of different words . 
  i speak myself a dialect with my family . 
  this is very natural phenomenon , look up italy , china . 
  minorities who learned turkish , inherently spoke that dialect of turkish . 
  though , nowadays language in big cities got almost unified with modernism since there is only one acceptable written dialect : istanbul turkish, 
  it can be , but i expect giving them citizenship from a right wing future government . 
  my jordanian friend in collage once told me that they fear palestinian refugees to take over the country . 
  their percantage must be huge there . 
  for turkey even whole syria population makes a bit more than a fourth of turkey . 
  however we can see similiar scenario for lebanon as i just learned that there 1.4 million syrian refugees + 400k palestinian refugees where whole population 5.8 million . 
  there is also already hizbullah military group independent from state . 
  so things can escalate fastly . 
  if you mention 2006 lebanon war , i was a child . 
  i have no idea what 's going on there now either . 
  but if push comes to shove , there might be a real war where everybody loses . 
  you are right , that seems the only solution especially ones who live in kurdish majority areas . 
  main opposition centre-left party leader has said yesterday `` we should give $ 6bn to europe and give them refugees instead of reverse . '', 
  however the public has n't risen their voice against refugees yet . 
  because it 's partially about their religion is n't different , partially because turkey is the first stop after syria . 
  but economically the situation is a disaster . 
  turkey already spent $ 9bn and a lot of people lost their job to cheaper labor syrians . 
  informal sector has risen , so the country ca n't collect those taxes . 
  european people remembered that turkey has borders with syria , iraq , so they changed their holiday destinations . 
  crime rates has risen especially pickpocketing , gun & explosive traffic . 
  there is also additonal political perspective comparing to europe i believe . 
  since most of them are anti-assad and they wo n't leave the country if assad wins the civil war , it pushes turkey into being anti-assad and even pushes to war . 
  i talked about kurds ' integration to the society not about political & military . 
  but the millet system you mentioned about makes the story only more dramatic . 
  their integration did n't occur despite equal citizenship . 
  there were many jews , armenians , greeks of anatolia who are bilingual that time yet most of kurds did n't know a turkish word that time . 
  today after even 94 years of the republic , my foreigner friends who live here for three years speak better than all the kurds i know combined . 
  if ~ 20 kurd students bully me alone in university at night for no reason , and any of them opposes this , i would n't call it integration . 
  has western europe found any solution for the issue ? 
  is there any law for saving the cultural heritage ? 
  when it comes to integration economics , culture and racial similarity plays great role . 
  if you ask for izmir , they failed to integrate at all criterias . 
  however , they suit perfectly for turkish majority eastern turkey cities . 
  they can be like natives if they stay there 10 years more . 
  i 'm hopeful when comparing some other minorities of turkey ( romani people , kurds ) where we have been failing to integrate since 1071 . 
  west coast . 
  [ this ] ( http://i.cdn.ensonhaber.com/resimler/diger/harita_5722.jpg ) is distribution from 2015, 
  turks became minority in my neighbourhood . 
  if you live in istanbul , it 's normal . 
  it 's even 1.5 in sariyer , uskudar and besiktas . 
  but rest of the country is 1 or cheaper . 
  [ purchasing power parity adjusted data here ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/thumb/c/cc/minimum_wages%2c_january_2016_%28%c2%b9%29_%28pps_per_month%29_yb16-ii.png/700px-minimum_wages%2c_january_2016_%28%c2%b9%29_%28pps_per_month%29_yb16-ii.png ), 
  eu is planning to give turkey 3 billion euros and turkey demanded another 3 billion . 
  however this money will spend on refugees ' shelter , food , schooling etc. 
  with supervision of eu . 
  so eu basically choose to sponsor refugees to keep them in turkey instead of sponsoring them in europe . 
  so actually eu have gained a plus with this deal . 
  however with this deal turkey will no need visa for schengen area after june 2016 . 
  also there is a risk of legal turkish immigration via marriage , work permits , educational . 
  the question for europeans is ` will it worth to exchange syrians with turks ? ', 
  the article is about turkey 's own $ 6 billion . 
  although it mentions italian firm magnagusta , turkey purchases defence products & technology mostly from us . 
  so the topic is barely about eu and totally irrelevent with immigrants . 
  these statistics show gross minimum wages . 
  in turkey 1300 net minimum wage , 1647 gross minimum wage . 
  that means the information is true . 
  turkey : one bread 2005 ( 200 g ) = 0.32 ytl ( 0.40 ytl for 250 g ) , one bread 2016 ( 250 g ) = 1 net ( not gross ) minimum wage 2005 = 350 ytl , net minimum wage 2016 = 1300 you could buy 862 breads in 2005 , now you can buy 1300 breads . 
  however obviously bread is n't the only measure when calculating ppp ( purchasing power parity ) . 
  2005 ppp conversion vector ~ 0.5 , net minimum wage $ 259 , in ppp $ 518 ; 2016 ppp conversion vector ~ 0.6 , net minimum wage $ 450 , in ppp $ 750, 
  yes , even the meat varies in different countries . 
  some countries mostly has pork d\u00f6ner . 
  though it 's inversely proportional with turkish population of the country . 
  i know , but it was n't angry turks , it was trash people who are disrespectful women always . 
  ( coming from secular turk ), 
  believe me once you eat ` patl\u0131can ezmesi ' you would have great foodorgasm . 
  though eggplants taste horrible out of its season like winter . 
  here we only use tomato sauce and it 's not always . 
  we get served ` meze ' which is small appetizers accompanying kebab . 
  some of them are like sauce : - ` haydari ' ( mainly yoghurt , feta , mint , fennel ) https://www.instagram.com/p/bakecnwpur7/?tagged=haydari - ` patl\u0131can ezmesi ' ( mainly eggplant and yoghurt ) https://www.instagram.com/p/bcavr7tscaq/?tagged=patl%c4%b1can ` ac\u0131l\u0131 ezme ' ( tomatoes and 10 more ingredients ) https://www.instagram.com/p/7cqskqmqli/?tagged=ac%c4%b1l%c4%b1ezme and some of them are n't like sauce like we get ` tur\u015fu ' ( pickling ) https://www.instagram.com/p/bcz4miungbm/?tagged=tur%c5%9fu, 
  i hope you mean kebab the food  kebabs are having hard times with us too .

  agreed !, 
  it 's also one of innocent fast-food because of very thin dough , baked , eaten with ayran ( yoghurt drink ) and salad . 
  however lahmacun ( turkish pizza ) independently developed from pizza .
