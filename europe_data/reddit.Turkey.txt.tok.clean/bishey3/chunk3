  his planned narrative in the next election will be that when akp lost majority peace was lost and the hdp is the cause of it . 
  however pkk did played right into hands of erdogan by firing first or back , it 's irrelevant which came first . 
  i 'm just hoping erdogan wo n't get his majority back but unfortunately i do n't see hdp keeping their votes given how they handled the situation . 
  erdogan will turn anything that comes from the hdp , that is not a complete request of surrender of pkk , to supporting terrorism in the eyes of the masses . 
  not sure that sarcasm is necessary . 
  turkey would probably be interested in buying an island or two :d, 
  as i said supposedly because it takes place during ramadan so the group were not given the right to organize a protest/walk/parade . 
  since it was not legally authorized they used force to disperse the gathering . 
  apparently it was because of ramadan . 
  as usual religious nut jobs force their own religion 's rules on others that do not follow it . 
  but i 'm sure there is some hidden homophobia in there as well . 
  turkish police force needs to be heavily reformed . 
  they act like they are soldiers of erdogan when they should be enforcing laws and protecting civilians . 
  i have a z2 myself . 
  pictures usually looks really nice but when you zoom in you can notice some white artifacts , like the phone was over sharpening some objects . 
  i noticed something similar in op 's photo and that 's why i asked . 
  best phone cameras in the market all use sony sensors ( apple , samsung , lg ) . 
  sony comes close to these brands in quality but is not on the same level in my opinion . 
  it 's probably due to sony dropping the ball at the software department . 
  which phone if i may ask ? 
  one from the xperia z series perhaps ? 
  it seems like there is no sound progress yet . 
  akp-mhp coalition seems the most likely in my opinion . 
  chp-mhp-hdp is probably nothing more than a dream . 
  is rest of the world also counts as turkish opposition ? 
  are the hundreds of journalists in jail counts as the opposition ? 
  are the numerous electoral fraud claims , corruption claims with ** documented ** evidence , multiple reports of the government cooperating with isis and other terrorist organizations are also wild claims made by the turkish opposition ? 
  surely police brutality , political favoring in government institutions and many cases opened by the state against numerous people and organizations because of their political standing with often fake or planted evidence are just propaganda being thrown by the turkish opposition . 
  what a fucking ** coincidence ** indeed . 
  what is that and can we steal it ? '', 
  well done mods !, 
  hitler would be proud . 
  just kidding . 
  i 'm sure you guys have explanation for the potential misunderstanding going on here . 
  ^ ^ ^ plz ^ ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ ^ send ^ ^ ^ me ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ camp . 
  there is a mosque close by . 
  from the most common building that the classes are held it 's 600 m in birds eye view . 
  1,15 km for the closest walking path . 
  well these protests does n't really achieve much in either case . 
  religious people do not understand why people might not want a mosque . 
  secular and/or non religious people already know that religion is not a good mix with colleges . 
  so both parties already have their minds set in a pretty much unchangeable state . 
  obviously it is important to be tolerant of religion even if you are not a religious person , especially in a pretty religious country like turkey . 
  but the issue is mosques are loud as fuck . 
  they are distracting . 
  also the one planned to be built on itu is going to be built with universities funds when a lot of dorms require restorations and all faculties certainly could use the money that is going towards this mosque . 
  it is just wrong and it is impossible to explain this to the religious folk . 
  14m/81m . 
  it 's the most concentrated city for sure but majority of the population is definitely not living in istanbul . 
  i was n't talking about the color , i was talking about the ideologies and culture . 
  with or without religion i can assure that women is more middle eastern than she is european . 
  she obviously does n't represent the whole country but i would be denying the truth if i said she is one of a kind in turkey . 
  well i would n't want to take high ground that easily . 
  a lot of turks are racist to other ethnicities as well . 
  just the way the world works i guess . 
  got to laugh it off or it consumes you until you are nothing but a collection of things you hate . 
  gon na let the turks off the hook that easily ? 
  you do know that all turks are , by all accounts with thousands of documentation to support the notion , literally hitler . 
  in fact hitler was literally a turk . 
  figuratively speaking . 
  obviously ... 
  well fuck .

  * preliminary information * turkish cabinet between 1999-2002 is a coalition of [ dsp ( centre-left ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/democratic_left_party_ ( turkey \\ ) ) , [ anap ( right ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/motherland_party_ ( turkey \\ ) ) , [ mhp ( far-right ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nationalist_movement_party ) . 
  after that akp has achieved majority to be a single party government until present day with general elections at 2002 ( first elected ) , 2007 and 2011 . 
  * summary * * vote shares of akp in various elections correlates with growth rates of the turkish economy . 
  akp is aware that their political fortune is tightly related to turkey 's economic fortune . 
  * there are 2 very clear sub periods of economic performance during akp goverment . 
  first period ( 2002-2006 ) is the period where economic policy was strongly dictated by imf programme . 
  second period ( 2007-today ) is the period of unconstrained economic policy dictated by akp . 
  * a table containing some information in the presentation : time periods | avg . 
  growth rate of turkish output | avg . 
  growth rate of developing / emerging countrie 's output ------------ | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- 90-01 | 3.4 % | 3.9 % 02-06 | 7.2 % | 6.9 % 06-12 | 3.5 % | 6 % * rapid growth after the 2001 crisis were a popular trend among developing countries . 
  turkey was no exception . 
  turkey was the exception after 2006 with considerable loss in growth rate . 
  * the imf programme was a very well thought programme with a detailed checklist for the government to follow . 
  according to the programme the coalition government of the 99-02 had to revitalize the banking system by assigning 20 % of national income to it . 
  in a time of crisis , this necessary measurement was very costly in terms of economics and politics ; losing the coalition a lot of public approval . 
  * an early election was called by mhp leader , a decision that is sarcastically implied to not be a very wise one . 
  result was a landslide victory for akp . 
  every member of the coalition found themselves out of the cabinet . 
  the coalition had to pay the difficult cost and akp got to reap all the benefits . 
  * akp understood the strength of the programme and followed all the instructions while implementing their economical policies . 
  results were very positive . 
  turkish bank supervising organization ( bddk ) , formed in accordance to the imf programme , is one of best in the world . 
  in 2008 crisis , banks were failing left and right world wide . 
  not a single bank failed in turkey during this crisis . 
  in fact even though fortis defunct world wide , their turkey division did not close and it is still operating to this date as a separate entity . 
  this was an important card for akp , as a strong banking system during a big financial crisis was crucial to prevent and minimize public outcry . 
  * in 2006 the checklist of the imf programme expired and akp found themselves in total control of the economic policy with huge public support . 
  akp opted to create a lot of fiscal policies . 
  they borrowed money from world wide central banks in crazy amounts with interests close to zero due to the 2008 financial crisis . 
  since rest of the world were in terrible shape , turkey became a good candidate for short term loans in high amounts . 
  * a graph is shown where turkey 's gdp increases steadily with big drops in 2001 and 2008 . 
  these years are followed with big improvements .
