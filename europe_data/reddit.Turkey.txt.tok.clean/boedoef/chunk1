well he says a lot of things , does n't he ? 
   the gap between turkey and eu will only get larger . 
  sad but true . 
  kurdish militias . 
  thanks for the taking time to write this . 
  unfortunately post is deleted . 
  i do agree on bad treatment , but it is undeniable that things were improving during the peace process . 
  it may not be as fast as some kurd wanted but at least it was something . 
  after the failure another negotiation process is impossible to take place in future . 
  unlike you , i do want a referendum for independence but my idea does n't represent the majority . 
  i appreciate your well written 2 page essay :d, 
  you cleverly put isis in your sentence but where does it say `` turkey funds isis '' in your article ? 
  our support for other groups such as hamas or fsa was n't a secret , but hamas = !, 
  isis . 
  supporting hamas does n't mean we help every other terrorist organization in world . 
  cute, 
  executive orders are due to the martial law . 
  i think there are safer ways to declare ml , do n't you think ? . 
  purges were already known . 
  it was n't a news . 
  i am not sure what you mean by `` being immune to opposition '' . 
  was n't he already ? 
  does n't he control entire media ? 
  those who dared to criticize him , either lost their jobs or went to jail . 
   everybody with a clear mind that is not brainwashed by turkey knows that erdogan knew of the coup . 
      the whole coup wasnt staged , but erdogan knew the there were some in the military planning a coup so he let them do it only to crush them immediately . 
  military coup is n't a game buddy . 
  he already had direct control on every government and civil apparatus . 
  what can you gain by coup attempt ? 
  however you can lose everything if your master plan fails . 
   why would we want turkey to join the eu ? 
  can anyone come up with a remotely good justification for the eu expanding into the middle east and having land borders with syria , iran and iraq ? 
  it depends on your definition of eu . 
  turkey is an extreme case for the project . 
  it is like testing your product in intense cold/warm conditions to see which temperatures are ( not ) suitable . 
  based on my definition of eu on my scale , germany , france , austria , luxembourg , belgium , netherlands and italy represents the center , the point zero . 
  other member states such as sweden or finland can be placed very near to the center , and others like romania and bulgaria may be located a bit further away . 
  yours might be different but we can all agree on turkey 's special status . 
  i personally do n't want turkey to join but `` not joining '' should n't mean complete isolation . 
  i believe both cases are equally harmful . 
  we need a special solution , that aims to increase cooperation in certain areas such as economy , science , security etc. 
  both parties must acknowledge the current negotiation talks create nothing but animosity . 
  doing the same thing and expecting different results is the definition of insanity . 
  we should demand a solution that strengthens the bonds of friendship or at least stop the future hostilities . 
  for instance , the refugee problem . 
  migrant deal and visa free travel are completely separate issues . 
  we try to solve every conflict in the context of eu accession . 
  if you think about it , it is an absolutely insane idea . 
  however if you observe each problem between eu and turkey separately , you will see many of them can be solved quite rapidly and more efficiently . 
  compare the followings ; * `` turkey wo n't bother to take measures to stop refugees without visa-free travel agreement '' * `` turkey is unable to host 3m refugees by herself '' both sentences are true but which one is more appealing ? 
  which case gives us opportunity for better relation , which one does n't and why ? 
  same applies to the cyprus dispute . 
  there is no connection between agriculture & rural development and cyprus problem . 
  why are we making love in a hammock standing up . 
  i also want to point out the dark side of wishful thinking . 
  there are those who still believes that in the future , there may be a turkey , that is more suitable for membership or something along those lines . 
  so it is better to postpone negotiations rather than end it all together . 
  well , like the saying `` hard times will always reveal true friends '' . 
  i can guarantee you , `` that turkey '' will not be your friend . 
  despite all , we have great opportunity to end negotiations in a positive way . 
  [ progress ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/accession_of_turkey_to_the_european_union#negotiation_progress ) may look inadequate , but still , it is enough to reach an agreement that contains something we can sustain and agree upon ** now ** . 
  no future negotiations or chapters . 
  it must be decisive . 
  let 's sign a better customs union , give researchers and academics more freedom , work together on climate change and drop the visa-free travel and other full membership craps . 
  there are tons of stuff we can work together on . 
  if `` ending eu membership talks '' sounds too strong , you may call it `` special '' membership or something else . 
  make love , not war . 
  i asked it because i never heard about yazidi genocide . 
  i thought you maybe referring to the [ assyrian genocide ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/assyrian_genocide ) . 
  thank you for taking the time to post it . 
   turkish genocide on iazidites iazidites ? 
  just to be sure , are you referring to the [ yazidis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yazidis ) or some different ethnic group ? 
   the turkish government handed isis their man back after he had been involved in terrorism in denmark . 
  this is news to me . 
  is there an article about this incident ? 
   turkey bought oil from isis till they became a threat to themselves ... do you mean , we have signed oil deal with isis ? 
   abolishing caliphate was a bad thing because that made muslim people leaderless imagine a caliph , who needs a saudi visa to visit mecca . 
  it was abolished because we lost the legitimacy with loosing middle east . 
  the title became meaningless and a political tool for royal family . 
  most importantly , there were two `` capitals '' at the time , one is ankara where the parliament established and the other was istanbul where caliph resides . 
  it created tension . 
  also the interpretation of the relevant law is n't easy and depends from person to person , it says  halife halledilmi\u015ftir . 
  in english , `` the caliph has been dismissed . 
  because the caliphate is inherent in the meaning and concept of the government and the republic , the position of caliphate is abolished . '', 
  one can interpret it as turkish parliament is the caliph or has responsibilities of caliph . 
  would you accept turkish parliaments as your caliph ? 
  sorry , your link only provided a preview , so i could n't read it . 
  how do they explain the bulgar language in article ? 
  [ proto-bulgarians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bulgars ) [ bulgar language ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bulgar_language ) do not deny your mongolian heritage my cousin . 
  you make [ khan kubrat ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kubrat ) upset . 
  this is actually very hard question to answer . 
  different groups may answer differently . 
  my opinion is , it is mainly due to the incompetence of opposition parties . 
  besides erdo\u011fan 's akp , we have three other important parties . 
  namely , * [ chp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republican_people%27s_party_ ( turkey \\ ) ) is kemalist and social-democratic political party * [ mhp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nationalist_movement_party ) is nationalist party * [ hdp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peoples%27_democratic_party_ ( turkey \\ ) ) is left-wing kurdish party i encourage you to check their wiki pages for more information . 
  chp and mhp are the oldest parties among those . 
  between 1970 - [ 1980 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980_turkish_coup_d'%c3%a9tat ) , they were arch enemies . 
  turkey has changed a lot since then . 
  however what happened at that time still influenced the views and stances of these parties and their members . 
  on the other hand akp is founded in 2001 and their main philosophy was based on current problems of turkey at the time .
