  this provided them great advantage against their competitors . 
  for instance , the [ long discussed headscarf controversy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/headscarf_controversy_in_turkey ) was a taboo subject for chp . 
  softening their stance may upset the supporters . 
  they could n't risk it and it limited their voter base significantly . 
  eventually they soften their stance but people tends remember the negative . 
  to the contrary , erdo\u011fan could offer solutions for [ violation of gay rights ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-kof-r7_o4 ) in turkey . 
  although they are the 4th largest party by popular vote , hdp is , in my opinion , the second most successful political organization in turkey after akp . 
  however their voter base is very limited . 
  also they have [ ties ] ( https://stanfordpolitics.com/understanding-the-triumphs-and-troubles-of-the-kurdish-resistance-875a84fa68c#.66o5sbbtc ) with the [ pkk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kurdistan_workers'_party ) . 
  in [ june 2015 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_general_election,_june_2015 ) election , there was a possibility of forming coalition government , but it is a taboo subject for the mhp to be in same coalition with hdp . 
  the snap election was called by president , and this time akp [ won ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_general_election,_november_2015 ) enough seats to form government . 
  [ 2001 turkish economic crisis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_turkish_economic_crisis ) led people to vote for alternatives in [ 2002 election ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_general_election,_2002 ) . 
  [ previous government ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_general_election,_1999 ) appointed [ kemal dervi\u015f ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kemal_dervi%c5%9f#ministry_of_economic_affairs ) to the minister of economic affairs to solve the economic crisis . 
  his plan is considered by [ many ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=tr&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2ft24.com.tr%2fhaber%2facemoglu-akp-donemindeki-buyumenin-nedeni-kemal-dervis%2c183961&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ) , the main reason behind the [ economic success between 2002-2013 ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.mktp.cd?end=2015&amp;locations=tr&amp;start=2000 ) . 
  to give akp credit , their ministers implemented his plan very successfully . 
  economic stagnation during the coalition governments are followed by significant economic growth during akp government , that has created a perception among public that the coalitions are bad for economy . 
  honestly , if there were no crisis in 2001 , we were discussing something completely different today . 
  turkish parliament has 10 % threshold , that means any party below the threshold is not represented in parliament . 
  now if we compare the 2002 election with 2015 november election , it shows how lucky they were . 
  year | number of votes represented in parliament | total valid votes : - :| -- :| : -- 2002 | 16.921.581 | 31,528,783 2015 | 46.635.959 | 47,840,231 in 2002 , only 50 % of the votes are represented . 
  in 2015 , it is close to 97.5 % . 
  if threshold was 2-3 points lower , we would end up with another coalition and possibly similar economic growth . 
  after their initial success , akp started to widen their vote base by small rhetoric shifts , in order to become more appealing to the voters of [ motherland party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/motherland_party_ ( turkey \\ ) ) , [ democrat party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/democrat_party_ ( turkey , _ current \\ ) ) and many other smaller parties of center-right . 
  later , they started to discuss the kurdish issue openly , that is one of the reasons , why akp is 2nd most popular party among kurds today . 
  again in this period , dialogs with other minority groups such as orthodox church , armenians , alevis etc. 
  started . 
  now , he uses same tactics on mhp , which is the only significant right-wing party left . 
  others are either already joined akp or dissolved to nothing . 
  this behavior is what makes akp different , and more successful than others . 
  erdo\u011fan can say one thing and next day he can advocate completely the opposite without upsetting his supporters and he can find new supporters . 
  after all the explanation , one can get the impression that erdo\u011fan is the one of the best politician in our time . 
  the problem is , he is not . 
  i hesitate even to call him an ok politician . 
  he fucks up all the time . 
  no i am not talking about small , insignificant stuff . 
  consider the last two years . 
  if same things were happening in one of the major eu countries , it could easily destroy ten governments . 
  unfortunately our opposition parties are unable to take advantage any of them , mainly because of the reasons i explained earlier . 
  i must exclude hdp from others . 
  actually if you try to reason with an erdo\u011fan supporters , their last argument is usually `` who will i vote instead ? 
  '' , meaning they accept he is bad but alternatives are worst . 
  akp has great maneuverability in political arena , which opposition lacks . 
  unfortunately people hold prejudice against those parties . 
  even most reasonable warnings might be ignored , if it comes from them . 
  even the most illogical propositions might be accepted , if it 's opposed by them . 
  this division is somewhat similar to the trump situation in usa . 
  it is proven countless times , that they are unable to reach their voice to significant portion of the population . 
  they will go to the next election , without offering anything new or new strategy , but expecting a different result . 
  i can say this with confidence , if we had a fresh new political party , that addresses the problems of majority and immune to rhetoric shifts , things would have been completely different . 
  note 1 : i must mention , akp has roots to an older movement called [ milli g\u00f6r\u00fc\u015f ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mill%c3%ae_g%c3%b6r%c3%bc%c5%9f ) . 
  i ignored this connection otherwise this post will never end and also because when akp 's founded their political views were quite dissimilar but as time goes by we saw some of the old habits resurfaced . 
  note 2 : chp obviously has a lot more history than what i mentioned , but i cut them to keep it short . 
   sure , why not true bavarian . 
  prost !, 
   it is hilarious how muslims portray themselves so shamelessly as the big victims al the time . 
  that is the fertile ground for islamism grows on ... 
  i am not even muslim . 
  i was pointing out your bias . 
  more than 30 % of total population were muslims at the time . 
  only in [ belgrade ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/persecution_of_ottoman_muslims#destruction_of_muslim_heritage ) , there were more than 100 mosques . 
  today there is only one . 
  you keep telling me it was an invasion , so it was just to remove their presence once the invaders are out . 
  i wonder if it is settled in your mind or do people like you still consider us invaders of anatolia ? 
  should we be worried about our future ? 
  should the current generation be persecuted using the same argument , if you get a chance ? 
  if not , what stops you ? 
  what was the muslim percentage in balkans around the same time period and what is it now ? 
   istanbul lisesi was established in 1884 and is one of the oldest and most traditional schools in turkey . 
  as a state school , istanbul lisesi admits students through the central state school examination . 
   istanbul lisesi continues to get support of the german government and has the active support of alumni and parents , many of whom are prominent members of the community . 
  since istanbul lisesi offers a free education , it addresses as well those students who can not afford private education . 
  i just took them from their [ website ] ( http://www.istanbullisesi.net/index.php/en/ ) . 
  it is n't german school . 
  it is a public school where some lessons are taught in german . 
   the fuck . 
  you know what `` what they signed up for '' means , right ? 
  no actually i do n't . 
  being in army is not garden work . 
  why do you need to emphasize that ? 
  are you trying to justify a suicide attack ? 
  i expect from any sane person to condemn this . 
  you on the other hand , trying to rationalize it . 
  no one wants to die like that , i know it , you know it . 
  every soldier is aware they can die on field and it is the reality of their job . 
  that does n't mean , they all have to die . 
  so why are you stating the obvious ? 
  world trade center was a very tall building . 
  i bet people on top floors were pretty much aware that if the building collapsed , they would die instantly . 
  so what ? 
  are/were terrorists less responsible for their murder ? 
   this is exactly what they signed up for yes you are right . 
  every turk , age of 18 is dreamed to be blown up by some brain dead suicide bomber while on their mandatory conscription duty . 
  we especially love it if it is in our off day . 
  which is the dream of dreams . 
  yes of course . 
  so they deserved to be bombed . 
  thank you for clearing that out . 
  off-duty service men were using city bus , which is a regular public bus . 
   these attacks are n't just happening randomly . 
  the turkish state is imprisoning people and bombing kurdish settlements can you tell me , where did those kurdish civilians go after their settlements bombed by turkish army ?
