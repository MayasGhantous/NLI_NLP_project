  you are talking about eu occupied cyprus right / s, 
  wow i am suprised to see how much europeans hate us, 
  cyprus is 100 % in asia, 
  100 % of cyprus is in asia, 
  we turks like albanians but they are not turks, 
  totally true, 
  really ? 
  i though we were texas, 
  of course he was :p, 
  erdogan does n't even have the parliamentary majority anymore . 
  turks will never give up on secularism . 
  we have been a secular country for almost 100 years . 
  most of the europeans tends the downvote a post if it is something positive about turkey, 
  the problem is that other chapters are blocked by various countries, 
  nato, 
  turkish citizens are eligible to vote in some consulates and embassies . 
  if i am not mistaken there are 4-5 million voters out side of turkey . 
  for example i have just voted for the november 1 re-elections few days ago in sydney/australia . 
  the world map in the link below shows the latest elections results by country https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_general_election,_june_2015#/media/file:turkish_general_election_2015_overseas_vote.png * yellow - justice and development party ( akp ) * red - republican people 's party ( chp ) * claret red - nationalist movement party ( mhp ) * purple - peoples ' democratic party ( hdp ) for more detailed information read the link below https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_general_election,_june_2015#overseas_results, 
  you are right, 
  i think you meant so called genocide since this court gave me the freedom to deny it i am just kidding let 's hope that one day we can leave the history behind and become good neighbours . 
  we turks are also trying comprehend the situation however from now on we can see some changes on turkish education system like 360 degrees is not equal to 0, 
  can some one ask our pm what is 2 +2 because i am afraid that his answer might be 5, 
  those ones are called isis members, 
  except the last sentence i agree, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/altaic_languages sure ? 
  i think the question should be re written like this : is there a difference between ~ ~ north ~ ~ east and ~ ~ south ~ ~ west ? 
  we wont go back to sultanate however , there are living members of osmanoglu family . 
  please win czech republic !!, 
  the distance is 4600 km and for comparison the distance between london and new york is 5500 km, 
  even majority of the muslims do not want to live in sa except saudis them self 's, 
  you asked why we did it ? 
  short answer is to prevent greeks taking the control . 
  also , we did all of the things you are telling it was strategic call to defend our mediterranean coast . 
  i am pretty sure every army have plan to invade their neighbors , that 's their job to be prepared . 
  i am pretty sure you are also forgetting the turkish civilians which were systematically killed by the greek gangs before the war . 
  definitely basketball also , volleyball might be the third one, 
  now they are not however , for the past 600 years we are a part of europe whether you like it or not, 
  no , first some people reacted with their instincts and attacked the police than police used tear gas, 
  i am a turk and a nationalist . 
  what those fascists did is unacceptable ? 
  people who died out their are turkish citizens , our fellow country man . 
  this is the time which we have to leave our problems behind and act as a united country . 
  there many turks who died in that blast too . 
  i am ashamed of these guys however , everyone should know that almost all of the turks are really sad because of the attacks . 
  on the other hand , we won the match so here we come france, 
  basically you have counted the most important allies of usa in the middle east . 
  ** turkey ** there are many radio stations however these are the ones that i usually tend to listen * power fm http://www.powerapp.com.tr/radio/powerfm international pop and electronic ( mostly english songs , my favorite radio station ) * virgin radio http://www.virginradioturkiye.com/ * radyo fenomen http://www.radyofenomen.com/fenomenplayer/radyofenomen * power turk fm http://www.powerapp.com.tr/radio/powerturk turkish pop, 
  also turkish and korean is from the same language damily, 
  are n't you guys a part of mexico ? 
  yeah , how can you not know this ? 
  shame on you , 
  delicious ** kebab ** !!, 
  turkey invaded cyprus because of the greek coup which tried to unite cyprus with greece, 
  i used to believe this . 
  i do n't think erdogan and the ruling party have nothing to do with this attack considering that this attack will decrease their votes and there is a re-election in turkey in 3 weeks, 
  if i am not mistaken in 2011 elections pkk asked for cease fire and during the ceasefire they killed 4 soldiers . 
  turkey will start to receive its 100 f-35 orders starting from 2018 till that time modernized f -16 s is all we got . 
  ** turkey ** ** terror attack ** * two suicide bomb attacks in the capital ( ankara ) which resulted in more than 100 casualties . 
  ( deadliest terror attack in the history of the republic of turkey . ),

  nationalist do n't do bombs . 
  they have never done it . 
  it is probably isis considering that pkk also do not use suicide bombers, 
  it is either pkk and isis . 
  considering that most of the people were kurdish it was probably isis who did this . 
  even though i do n't like erdogan why would he do this ? 
  he has nothing to gain from this . 
  these attacks will increase hdps votes so that 's why i believe that this was a false flag attack conducted by pkk to increase the votes of hdp, 
  too much cities : skylines, 
  probably isis or false flag attack of pkk, 
  pkk does n't like turks , kurds are not united amongst each other . 
  i have plenty of kurdish friends who are proud to be turkish citizens, 
  i ca n't even believe that i am saying this but literally greece is our best neighbor nowadays, 
  i do n't know your interpretation of terrorist however , if someone kills security personal and civilians ( 40.000 casualties in the pass 30 years ) they are called terrorists, 
  i think it is isis because pkk and the government have nothing to gain from this . 
  0 % of cyprus is in europe, 
  we acttualy only dislike their man on the other hand we love the women 's, 
  we will appreciate it . 
  you can never guess how crazy russians can be, 
  if this happens russia and it allies basically surrounds turkey a nato member, 
  we just want visa liberalization which is a right granted to any other candidate state . 
  isnt his pay check signed by angela merkel, 
  there are around 3-4 million turkish citizens ( dual citizens ) in germany and this number does not include the ones which only have german citizenship . 
  also , our only demand is visa liberalization . 
  erdogan does n't want to take your money otherwise he wont be able to blame europeans and say that eu leaders do n't help turkey dealing with the refugees . 
  really we only care about visa liberalization . 
  if you guys allow that eventhough erdogan allows refugees to pass from aegean regular turkish citizens wont allow them just not to loose their right to enter without visa . 
  we actually want to do that . 
  that 's why we are trying to build a pipe line via azerbaijan to turkmenistan . 
  with these countries we have great relations so we do n't have to deal with russians any more, 
  the fact that we share a religion with syrians does n't means we like them . 
  any way turks are to busy feeding germans with kebabs , 
  maybe the prince only came italy to see nude statues or ... 
  if he keeps this violent attitude against other countries the russian economy will crash . 
  look at ruble . 
  we are using similar air defense systems with other nato countries so i guess we would have shot it down as soon as it entered our airspace,
