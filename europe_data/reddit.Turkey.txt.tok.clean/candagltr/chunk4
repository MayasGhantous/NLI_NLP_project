  european population if you include turkey is like at least 5-6 larger times bigger than russia . 
  i really do n't think russia will have any chance against nato . 
  i dont know the greek perspective however the only reason that i can think for turkish soldiers to invade aegean islands is cheap ouzo . 
  cac\u0131k -- a very refreshing mixture of grinded or shredded cucumbers with diluted yogurt , garlic and mint . 
  on a hot summers day some serve it with some ice cubes in it , to make it even more refreshing . 
  as a turk i was gon na write kebab however i realized that at least 10 germans mentioned that wtf, 
  talking bad things about ataturk that conversation will end in a fight, 
  edit : turkish identity dilemma, 
  probably the next government on turkey is going to be a coalition between akp-mhp . 
  mhp is an ultra nationalistic right wing party . 
  so the next turkish government wont allow any sort of unification because of mhp . 
  as a turk i am an in favor of both greek and turkish military leaving the island leaving the island , the people of cyprus should be able to negotiate their future however the unification process is not controlled by cypriots . 
  the only way of reunification is a deal between turkish and greek governments . 
  actually a large portion of muslims thinks that way but because of some psychopath extremists actions who ca n't handle a little humor the worlds thinks the other way . 
  it is a free world everyone should be able to do whatever they want, 
  as a muslim i do n't see anything wrong with this . 
  there are many drawings of mohammed . 
  if he does n't insult to anyone , a little humor wont hurt any one, 
  what sort of a turk are you if you dont like turkey this much go live somewhere else, 
  actually it is 85 % if you include votes of turks living outside of turkey ( they can vote in consulates ), 
  the reason for that is because while they were a part of ottoman empire they have allied with allies in ww1 and fought against us thats one of the reasons ottomans have lost their southern flank . 
  so we used to consider them as our brothers but for the last hundred years we dislike them and the thing i have mentioned is one of the main reasons . 
  also turks believe that being arab is being backwards so thats why we dont like to be called brother of arabs, 
  i am turk and i am sure there is no arabs in my family in the past 5 generations . 
  maybe its because i am from the west coast . 
  yes it is true that eastern part of turkey has some arabs . 
  according to this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_turkey#ethnic_groups only 1 % of turkey is arab . 
  5 % of germany is turkish and that definitely does not make them brothers, 
  lets call us eurasian but dont forget the total population of the european part of turkey is over 10 millions that is even larger than greece, 
  we didnt this time !, 
  i hope the new coalition government that they are gon na set up has better syria policy and a positive attitude towards west, 
  ok french and british emprire ruled africa for years . 
  is africa and uk similar to each other ( except south africa ) ? 
  syrians are far away from fitting in turkey . 
  average turks does not like arabs . 
  especially after ww1 when they have allied with british and french forces against ottoman empire . 
  the only place these refugees fitting is the public parks where they are sleeping . 
  also the language is a real problem turkish and arabic is very different from each other , considering that most of the refugees is not educated they also dont know english while most dutch ( most also knows german ) and danish speaks english . 
  however azerbaijanis ( same culture 90 % similar language ) and iranians ( there are 20 million turkic speaking iranians ) could easily fit in turkey . 
  turks are closer to even greeks compared to syrians, 
  everyone is against the turks , even facts , because they envy us for our awesomeness . 
  however , renewing it is only 15 or 5 $ if you have any time left on your old passports . 
  200 $ is for a 10 year passport you can get one for 30 $ a year or just pay 200 $ once and use it for 10 years . 
  i am pretty sure if they need it everyone in turkey can pay 20 $ s a year to travel, 
  i love my country and i hate the rest / s, 
  i guess syria / s turkey detains japanese man ` seeking to join daesh ' in syria http://www.dailysabah.com/investigations/2016/03/23/turkey-detains-japanese-man-seeking-to-join-daesh-in-syria, 
   basically , europe sees turkey as a culturally incompatible middle eastern country that once invaded europe . 
  meanwhile , the middle east sees turkey as a non-arab country separate from the middle east that once invaded the middle east . 
  i was just going to say this, 
  i totally agree, 
  i loose to drink otherwise those games are so boring, 
  hahaha 100 years ago they said the same thing, 
  i suppose turkey would be the texas of united states of europe, 
  even though i did n't vote for him i believe majority of the turkish public supports him, 
  i do n't know man the last time i checked my house ( 14 million people lives in the european part of turkey ) was in europe and i was living in turkey, 
  i guess they do n't like turkish children, 
  turkish passports include the biometric chip however the chip does n't include the fingerprint data . 
  all turkish passport issued after 2010 is biometric : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_passport, 
  isnt that the case all around the world ?

  i was just thinking of the same thing, 
  they have cut two players out it says ** se ** hitler olmez which means martyrs do not die in turkish . 
  players are wearing these thirst to commemorate the soldiers killed while fighting against kurdish pkk ( the picture is posted by a kurd as you can see from the flag ) . 
  here is the original , un cropped version : http://img.haberler.com/manset/9/besiktas-tan-helal-olsun-dedirten-hareket_x_7621235_4.jpg, 
  yes it is fake here is the original picture http://img.haberler.com/manset/9/besiktas-tan-helal-olsun-dedirten-hareket_x_7621235_4.jpg, 
  last month i bought a godiva chocolate and on the back of it i saw the logo of yildiz holding . 
  we shall destroy every country !, 
  currently i consider greece as our best neighbour . 
  really ? 
  last time i checked my home was in europe ( istanbul ), 
  or the airline might choose to fly with an only male crew to iran which will solve this problem unless suits are also banned in iran . 
  there is a very easy solution for this problem . 
  air france can operate this flight with 2 different crews so that no one has to leave the plane . 
  for example turkish airlines operates kabul/afganistan this way so that non of their employees leaves the plane . 
  or they can fly with a only male crew . 
  as a final note i have to say that i find iranian law very backwards minded . 
  ccc, 
  from the other side of aegean i can confirm it was indeed windy as fuck, 
  ** istanbul , turkey ** the only influence i have noticed is sometimes local municipalities names parks or roads after important people from these cities or places in these sister cities . 
  ** europe ** berlin , germany ( 1989 ) barcelona , spain ( 1997 ) cologne , germany ( 1997 ) constan\u0163a , romania ( 2001 ) durr\u00ebs , albania ( 1998 ) kazan , russia ( 2002 ) odessa , ukraine ( 1997 ) plovdiv , bulgaria ( 2001 ) rotterdam , netherlands ( 2005 ) saint petersburg , russia ( 1990 ) sarajevo , bosnia and herzegovina ( 1997 ) skopje , macedonia ( 2003 ) venice , italy ( 2007 ) kranj , slovenia ( 2014 ) ** asia ** almaty , kazakhstan ( 1998 ) amman , jordan ( 1997 ) beirut , lebanon ( 2010 ) bangkok , thailand ( 2009 ) busan , south korea ( 2008 ) damascus , syria ( 2006 ) dubai , united arab emirates ( 1997 ) guangzhou , china ( 2012 ) jakarta , indonesia ( 2007 ) jeddah , saudi arabia ( 1984 ) johor bahru , malaysia ( 1983 ) lahore , pakistan ( 1975 ) mary , turkmenistan ( 1994 ) osh , kyrgyzstan ( 1998 ) shanghai , china ( 1997 ) shimonoseki , japan ( 1972 ) tabriz , iran ( 2010 ) ** americas ** houston , texas , united states ( 1988 ) mexico city , mexico ( 2010 ) rio de janeiro , brazil ( 1965 ) ** africa ** benghazi , libya ( 2013 ) cairo , egypt ( 1988 ) khartoum , sudan ( 2001 ) rabat , morocco ( 1991 ) tunis , tunisia ( 2010 ), 
  4 th time . 
  do n't forget the marmaray tunel . 
  probably for turks it is azerbaijan, 
  we also need far lass migrants . 
  our unemployment rate is around 10 % and extra 3 million people does not help this situation . 
  we turks do not want these refugees as much as any other european do . 
  mate these prices are for internet plans with out any download quotas . 
  if you choose to buy a plan with a download quota prices go down dramatically . 
  for example i use ttnets 100mb/s plan with 200 gb download quota for 96 which is around 29 $ . 
  shit that speed costs 3-4 times more in turkey around 30-40 $, 
  and there goes the freedom fighters of r/europe the terrorist pkk, 
  it is snowing outside why the fuck do n't all of them stay inside of the bus stop ? 
  why there is a meter gap between them ? 
  considering that the sample size was 1500 , 10 % correspondes to 150 people so this survey indicated 150 people does n't see isis as a terrorist organisation in a country with 77 million population . 
  i am pretty sure around a 5 % of turks does not even know what isis is . 
  why should we even consider giving syrians work permits while our unemployment is around 10 % ? 
  it snowed !, 
  i guess putin is using his secret weapon on us . / s,
