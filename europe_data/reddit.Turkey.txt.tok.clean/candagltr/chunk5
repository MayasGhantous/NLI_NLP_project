  mate we are unstable it is just the western press starting to write about it . 
  anyway , relax and enjoy your holiday unless you are going to a kurdish majority town . 
  but he is an elected leader / s, 
  mr.putin , mr.putin , mr.putin , mr.putin , mr.putin , mr.putin ... 
  it is probably -90 % in turkey right know . 
  i guess it is time to protect our azeri brothers from this russian - armenian aggression . 
  according to the defence pact turkey and azerbaijan signed in 2008 any attack on azerbaijan will be considered as an attack on turkey . 
  as if some one cares about putins opinions in turkey, 
  i thought those lights on the road side were christmas decorations all the time . / s to be honest , istanbul is full of speed and red light cams nowadays . 
  ours too / s, 
  eu occupied turkish territory / s, 
  according tuik our gdp is 19.000 $, 
  pls no no no !!, 
  botteled walter both at home and restaurants . 
  for example 500 ml cost around 0.50 which is around 0.12 $ . 
  i have never seen a restaurant which offers tap water in turkey . 
  i am pretty sure no one will go to that restaurant if they do so . 
  every drinking water company have a delivery service for 18 l bottles which cost around 10-15 which is around 5 $ . 
  they ussualy deliver the 18 l bottle in 2-3 hours at max . 
  ** know what countries guarantee drinkable tap water with this graphic : ** http://lifehacker.com/know-what-countries-guarantee-drinkable-tap-water-with-1635070463 i guess this diagram explains why eastern europeans prefer bottled water . 
  that 's like 3 times more than the minimum wage in turkey . 
  putin says russia has proof that entire nato is commended by abu bakr al-baghdadi . 
  no , since albania became independent ( or atleast was n't a part of ottoman empire ) when ottoman empire collapsed . 
  haha !, 
  i guess we turks love babies / s, 
  russian air force starts bombing iraqi kurds, 
   the ottoman empire was governed by different sets of laws during its existence . 
  the kanun a secular legal system , co-existed with religious law or sharia . 
   the ottoman system had three court systems : one for muslims , one for non-muslims , involving appointed jews and christians ruling over their respective religious communities , and the `` trade court '' . 
  the entire system was regulated from above by means of the administrative kanun , i.e. 
  laws , a system based upon the turkic yassa and t\u00f6re , which were developed in the pre-islamic era .

  turkish politics 101, 
  i do n't know why , even though i do n't use any dns or vpn i can acces imgur via superonline but not on turkcell, 
  you guys are masters of pooping , you manage to do it so clean that you do n't need to clean it !, 
  as a turk who always uses toilet paper i can confirm that most of the people especially the old ones prefer to wash their butthole with their hands for like 1-2 mins with water than wash their hands . 
  i find it disgusting but that 's the case . 
  also most turks believe that europeans are nasty people since they do n't use water to wash their buttholes . 
  turkish toilet with water skirting pipe : http://www.thisisturkey.net/images/toilet.jpg, 
  eu allows citizens of a country literally ruled by sharia law travel to eu with out visa and not us !, 
  turkey is not the country of origin of these refugees as like many eu states turkey is just a transit country . 
  if we really want to solve this crisis we should act together and create safe zones in syria and start rebuilding syria so that these people will go back . 
  first of all both iran and turkey has no place in arab league since they are both not arabs and speaks different languages . 
  russia and turkey have always been regional rivals , iran is our sworn enemy . 
  so either we are going to stay alone or have to find a way to stick with europeans . 
  also as a nato member we can not integrate our selfs with anybody else . 
  just share a link for that so called beheading video and i will believe you . 
  shooting a russian plane bombing ~ ~ radicals ~ ~ turkmens . 
  turkmens ( in syria ) = turks the area that russian planes were bombing does not belong to isis . 
  turkish intelligence agency mit is behind this / s, 
  these talks are 2 times older than my age . 
  how do they expect rebels and the regime forces to work together while for past 5 years their only goal is to destroy each other ? 
  what are the ingredients of m\u00e4mmi ? 
  ** suddenly ** our food imports became hazardous !, 
  i wonder why ? 
  to be honest we ca n't handle loosing the competition very well, 
  a reuters article on turkish army training kurdish peshmergas : http://www.reuters.com/article/iduskcn0j60b720141122, 
  erdo\u011fan is the muslim version of putin putin is the orthodox version of erdo\u011fan erdo\u011fan = putin, 
  we changed our rules of engagement few years ago when our f-4 was shot down over mediterranean by syria . 
  any military air craft entering turkish air space from syria will be shot down immidietly . 
  so they knew about our rules of engagement we warned them like 10 times and according the our new rules of engagement we shot them down . 
  all of the air space violations warnings are made on open frequencies which everyone can listen . 
  that 's why you can find many recordings of the warnings from different sources . 
  all of the turkish air force pilots knows english , i am pretty sure russians do to since english is like the de facto language of international aviation . 
  what other language should have our pilots used ? 
  i am pretty sure none of our pilots speaks russian or none of the russian pilots speaks turkish so that leaves english as the most viable option . 
  icao states that all of the atc ( air traffic control ) regardless of country is in english . 
  also usa and nato warned russia months ago that all of the russian pilots should be a ble sleek english to prevent a conflict like this . 
  i have fixed the link what other language should our pilots use ? 
  ( i am pretty sure none of our pilots speaks russian and russians wo n't understand turkish ) as like all other nato countries in international matters our pilots uses english . 
  also the most common language used in aviation is english . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/aviation_english i am pretty sure all of the military pilots in the world are able to speak english . 
  all of the warnings in nato member states are in english . i also think that 's the case all around the world . 
  hagia sophia ~ ~ cathedral ~ ~ , ~ ~ mosque ~ ~ museum, 
  by looking at this infographic you can understand why nato exists, 
  i will never fly with aeroflot after seeing this .

  basketball, 
  russia is the main reason why nato exists and with their actions they are just proving this . 
  http://www.tradingeconomics.com/turkey/gdp-growth-annual 2011 8.8 % ( after 2011 middle east went crazy ) 2012 2.1 % 2013 4.2 % 2014 2.9 % 2015 3.1 % ( imf estimate ), 
  i guess they want china to bomb them too, 
  if you are interested growth rate of turkish economy was 3.8 % in q2 of 2015 . 
  as a member of eu customs union i think turkey should be included in this chart . 
  the ship in the third video is the turkish coast guard trying to help refugees . 
  more reliable source ( the guardian ) : http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2015/nov/20/greek-coast-guard-allegedly-tries-to-sink-migrant-raft-video, 
  http://www.rferl.org/contentinfographics/foreign-fighters-syria-iraq-is-isis-isil-infographic/26584940.html please take a look at this map there are more uk , german citizens in isis than turkish citizens . 
  there are around 600 turkish citizens fighting for isis , turkeys population is 77 million . 
  that makes up 0.0007 % of turkey . 
  per million people there are way lesser turks in isis than any other european nation . 
  just take a look at the link . 
  watermelon and feta is my favourite too,
