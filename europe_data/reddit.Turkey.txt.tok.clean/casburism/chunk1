ahahaha lol, 
  you seriously have been trying to prove that i hate french !, 
  wow !, 
  just wow !, 
  i have n't write anything about ` french ' . 
  ' ... s\u0131z ' means without in turkish . 
  it 's a general rule for all words . 
  you should n't blurring people 's mind . 
  i have n't met anyone french in turkey . 
  how can i have negative experiences about their visits ? 
  if it was french , i would just say it 's french . 
  we are on internet . 
  why would i be scared ? 
  i just do n't want to break hearts the people i like . 
  i deleted comments because i regret my words . 
  not because it was french . 
  you misunderstood it and now you spreading it to others ... you do n't even speak turkish , you are from austria . 
  lol, 
  what are you talking about ? 
  i have n't seen any french in turkey yet . 
  you only visit historical places i guess , because you have your own beaches . 
  so french option was out already . 
  nah , it 's probaby invented thousands of years ago in fertile crescent before we turks arrived . 
  well i do n't think turks invented it that 's the difference . 
  we exchanged many words throughout history i guess . 
  hungarian sounds so beautiful . 
  there are hungarian words in the beginning of [ this song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzyzpanbf6g ) and my hairs rise when i listen, 
  stating that yogurt is n't derived from the turkish language means that turks have invented it too . 
  that smell in bathroom after eating it ... loool, 
  stating that yogurt derived from turkish language does n't mean turks invented it either . 
  can you show me which part did i mention about inventing anything ? 
  i have never eaten that sh.t !, 
  past\u0131rma is so expensive though , it 's hard to eat . 
  seems like you have many friends from turkish minority , no more reveal our primitive traditions, 
  raw garlic with yogurt is perfect !, 
  but you should n't go out next two days lol, 
  owner of chobani said : `` i moved from turkey because i 'm a kurd . '', 
  so he may even call his yoghurt `` cambodian yoghurt '' but not `` turkish yoghurt '' . 
  they want to sell it before we capture . 
  etymology of yogurt :  the word is derived from turkish : yo\u011furt , and is usually related to the verb yo\u011furmak , `` to knead '' , or `` to be curdled or coagulated ; to thicken '' . 
  ohh yeah , tasty sour turkish [ yogurt ] ( https://www.instagram.com/p/bhhtqsealhc/?tagged=yo%c4%9furt ), 
  his height is disputed . 
  currently world 's tallest man alive ** measured ** by guinness world records is [ sultan k\u00f6sen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sultan_k%c3%b6sen ) from turkey with his ** 2.51 ** m height . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtdtrfhv_cu ) , he is in london with world 's shortest man . 
  261 m with antenna . 
  without antenna sapphire is 236 m. 
  i think i 'm misinformed previously . 
  a news source says that the bridge is currently free but after july 11 , it will cost $ 21 for motorcycles , ** $ 30 ** for cars , $ 62 for biggest trucks . 
  it 's ** one way ** and the price ** is n't included ** price of highway . 
  however since highway is n't complated there is no good information about it . 
  yes , there is a bay on marmara sea . 
  this bridge decreased 80 km road to 3 km . 
  the new highway will connect three major cities after complated ( istanbul - bursa - izmir ) reducing 8 hours road to 3.5 hours . 
  the price is astronomical though , $ 35 + 8 % purchase tax . 
  lol i ca n't write long messages really and somehow i needed to response so ... 
  it 's so nice , history is history . 
  we all should be friends . 
   a prostitution like relationship . 
  no offence but it 's easy to understand why you think like this from your flair . 
  those africans should pray 10 times to their holy trees for the conquerors who has been bringing civilisation . 
  btw you should be thankful to england too . 
  yes , initally planned as with time many nations developed special relationship both as governments and as people . 
  it 's similar to forming of nations . 
  so why do we deny that ? 
  if you take denmark . 
  do you really think that danish government does policies based on solely its interests toward sweden ? 
  i mean same level with vietnam ? 
  all the democratic organizations run by individuals who is elected by people who have very solid and probably wrong idea for visa policy of their country . 
  ( that 's why we have indirect democracy ) so even if the government can satisfy , convince its public with something disputed ( in brexit case we saw how a government failed ) the individuals who rule country are n't perfectly rational . 
  they have very much emotional decisions and they wo n't even deny it . 
  also forget about conspiracy theories that international aid ** just ** for benefit . 
  i agree that there are many people who just seek for their interest but it 's not strong as nations before . 
  before even regionalism was very strong . 
  some prime ministers in turkey enlarged their hometowns ' borders . 
  i mean it 's even crazy to think something like this now . 
  as you know , there are many phases in history . 
  nation concept on people 's mind is relatively new . 
  so i think this phrase is totally wrong for the times before 1700 when people identify themselves with their kingdom and religion . 
  i do n't know how exactly nation concept developed , however we may say nationalism gradually increased until ww2 and then decreased dramatically . 
  in addition people dreamed a world all people share and developed international organizations for the first time . 
  so i think this phrase is outdated . 
  because it ignores : * both friendship and enmity of nations * flowing of hundreds of billion dollars aid money to undeveloped world every year * a big population who define themselves as world citizen on their upper-identity . 
  * organizations such as eu , nato which softly force nations to move on common base . 
  it also assumes that humans act rational rather than emotional . 
  you can find many researchs about how we fail to detect our emotional actions while we purchase , invest on a stock . 
  so i can easily assume that many nations and their governments do politics based on their ` left brain ' . 
  so this phrase may be close to true for world wars times when nationalism high rocketed . 
  but for now it 's outdated and wrong . 
  this is so wrong in many ways in today 's world . 
  what 's your business with istanbul aka byzantium aka constantinople ? 
  end this theater !, 
  we will never be member of eu . 
  we have to accept it and focus on a state 's first duty : protecting lifes of its citizens !, 
  no more soft power shit , environmental issues , street animals bla bla we want war !, 
  and just now !, 
  i think it 's time to remove turkey from / r/europe and add to / r/middleeasternshithole, 
  no need to be sorry , there is no hope for future of turkey . 
  we 'll get used to it eventually . 
  istanbul is literally baghdad 2.0 now . 
  how do you even know about euro 2016 ?
