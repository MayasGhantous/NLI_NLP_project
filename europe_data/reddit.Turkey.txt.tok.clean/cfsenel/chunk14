  maybe you live somewhere where there are more arabs ? 
  [ even erdo\u011fan is seen as a hard core secularist when he is visiting some arab countries ] ( http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/09/14/166814.html ) , amusingly . 
  framing prominent chp members as being isis members ... smart ... no wonder nobody noticed it , chp is practically a breeding ground for isis anyway . 
  now i am starting to think that those mhp deputies arrested last month for kennedy assassination may also have been framed ... 
  damn , akp is so smooth . 
  i found the case he was talking about ( although there may be others ) . 
  [ here ( turkish link ) . 
  ] ( http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/pkk-liya-32-kez-muebbet-644-yil-hapis-22837969 ) he indeed got 32 times life in prison , plus 644 years 3 months 20 days in jail . 
  this probably looks weird to a brit , because as far as i know in your system judges decide what is the appropriate sentence on an individual basis . 
  here ( and in continental europe ) they have to follow the book even if it gives weird results , although they have some judicial discretion . 
  normally related crimes are aggregated and a single sentence is given . 
  i just checked the criminal code , and apparently murder and bodily harm is exempted from such aggregation , so you get such high sentences . 
  but getting two times life in prison is actually different than getting one , which also answers your other question . 
  as you say , life in prison is not actually life , you are automatically released on parole after 24 years ( 30 if organized crime ) . 
  but if you get multiple times life in prison , it is 30 years ( 34 if organized crime ) . 
  there is also something called aggravated life imprisonment , which gives you 30 years ( 36 if organized crime ) , and if you manage to get it multiple times it is 36 years ( 40 if organized crime ) . 
  oh , and i did n't even mention the case of terrorism . 
  if you get aggravated life imprisonment for terrorism , you do n't get a parole , you are actually in for life , which is probably the case for this gentleman . 
  in that case getting multiple times life should n't matter . 
  but sometimes the government declares amnesty , which reduces all sentences . 
  i think at one point in the 80s the parliament passed a bill reducing all life imprisonments into 8 years or something . 
  that gentleman would remain in prison for life even in the case of a general amnesty . 
  basically that sentence ensures that he will never ever be released , short of a complete judicial reform . 
  yeah , but as i said , that is n't unique to dutch royalty , presidents also represent the country . 
  if someone says `` fuck you '' to a politician , they are not supposed to say `` fuck you '' back , it does n't work very well for their pr either . 
  that 's no reason to make it a crime to insult them . 
  on the contrary , being in public positions , they must be ready to take harder defamation than regular people do . 
  they require photos as far as i now ( and they require you to be passive , active does n't count , [ link ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-17474967 ) ) . 
  that 's even more exciting , depending on how open you are to new experiences . 
  edit : apparently they deny requiring photos ( [ turkish link ] ( http://www.radikal.com.tr/turkiye/haber-yalanlandi-dunyanin-en-buyuk-gay-porno-arsivi-tskda-degil-1028864/ ) ) , i do n't know which is true . 
   the law , at least here in the netherlands , exists because the royal family is n't allowed to defend themselves against comments in public . 
  that 's weird . 
  why ? 
  also , in any case , what does it matter that they ca n't respond to comments ? 
  comments are not criminalized anyway . 
  ( maybe you meant to say the royal family is n't allowed to insult back , and that 's why it is forbidden to insult them . 
  yeah , if someone says `` fuck you '' to queen , i guess she is n't supposed to say `` fuck you '' back , but royalty is not unique in not being able to swear . ), 
  yes , at least in the netherlands ' case , the people in question are not politicians , and they probably stay out of daily politics ( i imagine ) . 
  it is more problematic in turkey 's and france 's ( and poland 's and many other country 's ) case . 
  actually , turkey is meant to be more like the netherlands : the prime minister holds the political power and president is supposed to be outside of daily politics . 
  erdo\u011fan , of course , moved on to become president , getting all the protection and legal irresponsibility of it , while continuing to rule through a proxy prime minister . 
  also , at least , in the netherlands ' case , it is the consensus that insulting people should not be a crime , and freedom of expression should be interpreted broadly ; so so a dickhead would have a hard time abusing your laws . 
  unfortunately , in turkey criminalizing insult has support across the political spectrum : akp supporters are all for criminalizing insulting president ( currently ) , kemalists are for criminalizing insulting atat\u00fcrk , nationalists are for criminalizing insulting turkish nation , religious people are for criminalizing insulting religion , etc , and the consensus is reached by criminalizing them all , instead of allowing them all . 
  the good thing about erdo\u011fan abusing the law so horribly is maybe people will realize having such laws is not a good idea , and we will get rid of them once and for all . 
  he is talking about being an officer . 
  everybody is conscripted regardless . 
  i guess you could try homosexuality if you are looking for a get-out-of-army-free card . 
   he extended the time for prime ministers so he could stay in the office longer . 
  there are no term limits for prime ministers . 
   he is n't allowed to run for office as a pm , that 's a done deal . 
  he can run for office as a pm if he likes . 
  though he can not do it while he is president , obviously . 
  this will happen to h\u00fcrriyet and cumhuriyet precisely because people do n't protest when it happens to bug\u00fcn . 
  `` oh , i do n't like those guys , they are awful , let the government censor them . '', 
  you would have thought people have learned that is not a good reaction by now . 
  and if you think it is ok to infringe human rights of a person because completely other people with the same political view did some wrong in the past ; well , kemalists did horrible things as well , you ca n't really blame akp when they come for h\u00fcrriyet and cumhuriyet . 
  that 's mild , he had [ cartoons like this drawn all the time . 
  ] ( http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/thumbs/214x183/archive/2015/6/5/291937_resource/3.jpg ) if you drew erdo\u011fan like that now you would be hanged , drawn and quartered . 
  but people still faced time in jail , and courts did give prison sentences , even though it was often converted to fines . 
  [ e.g. 
  abdurrahman dilipak got 11 months in prison for insulting sezer ] ( http://www.haber7.com/medya/haber/191560-dilipak-sezere-hakaretten-mahkum ) , converted to a fine . 
  now i do n't like abdurrahman dilipak at all , but he should have had the right to say what he did . 
  unfortunately , the society has always been fine with limiting freedom of expression very severely , not just about insulting president , but about insulting atat\u00fcrk , religion , turkishness etc. 
  when that is the case , it is no surprise that a dude comes along and uses these laws and that consensus to his benefit . 
  if it had been the norm that freedom of expression can not be restricted like that , erdo\u011fan would n't dare , and his supporters would n't be able to justify it to themselves so easily . 
   anyway , laws like that should be abolished altogether , even though they are not enforced at the moment . 
  when some dickhead suddenly decides they do want to enforce it it 's too late . 
  exactly . 
  the law used to be rarely applied , and even then you would get a fine at most , so nobody objected to that law . 
  and when erdo\u011fan started to be covered by that law all hell broke loose . 
  if such a law were n't in place , erdo\u011fan would have a much harder time passing it , and it would be universally seen as a move to curb criticism against him . 
  now his supporters have the luxury to say `` hey , erdo\u011fan did n't make that law , of course courts should apply the law , we are a rechtsstaat after all '' . 
  if we , as a society , moved beyond accepting that it is permissible to punish insulting , erdo\u011fan would n't dare criminalizing insulting him . 
  since / u/youthanasian did not correctly reply to your question , let me do it . 
  unfortunately , there are very few people in turkey who would support an extended notion of freedom of speech . 
  you should understand that it is not just `` insulting president '' laws , defamation in general is considered a crime , and a greater crime in certain cases . 
  most people find it normal to have such laws in place , and protest against attempts of repealing them . 
  currently , pro-akp people often oppose repealing `` insult president '' laws , kemalists often oppose repealing `` insult atat\u00fcrk '' laws , nationalists oppose repealing `` insult turkish nation '' laws , religious people oppose repealing `` insult religion '' laws , and regular people oppose repealing `` insult regular people '' laws . 
  therefore , they all remain as law , unless an american-like understanding of freedom of speech popularizes in turkey in the future . 
  ( it is not just turkey by the way , many european countries have such laws . ), 
  what is especially problematic currently is , the law is being incredibly overused and abused against all criticism . 
  the judiciary is very much subdued by the executive , and the courts themselves do not respect due process . 
  in the past , laws against insulting atat\u00fcrk and turkishness were similarly used hysterically , but even then it was n't to such extent that we are seeing currently with this law . 
  i think it would be better to get rid of them all now , maybe seeing how they can be abused will convince people that it is necessary and then we can hope next government to do it . 
   nope , this is all new and from ankara where did you get that idea ? 
  they are the original thrones from [ y\u0131ld\u0131z palace ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/y\u0131ld\u0131z_palace ) as far as i know . 
  [ here is a video from 2013 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5tleqzqje4 ) , when they were renovating the palace to host foreign dignitaries , which includes the throne . 
   the bastard even named the palace after his own party ak sarayi i am not sure if you are trolling or very ignorant . 
  `` ak saray '' ( ak/white palace ) is what his critics are calling it , to emphasize that the [ presidential complex ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/presidential_complex ) is built for erdogan 's personal whim and a waste of public money . 
  erdogan obviously hates that name . 
  he meant it was shot here ( that 's why i gave the malta example ) . 
  in the movie they are going from istanbul to afyon by rail , so that scene could be taking place in [ any one of these towns in between . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/burnt_down_western_anatolian_towns.png ) ( this only shows the ones burnt by the greek army though . 
  if i recall correctly the movie depicted an attack by a greek gang . 
  those burnt many more small turkish villages . ), 
  kayak\u00f6y would be on the far southwest in this map , far from the heart of the greco-turkish war ( i believe it was in the italian occupation zone ) . 
   i also see nothing about fleeing the greek army on the kayak\u00f6y wikipedia page , which instead gives this explanation and why do you expect to ? 
  the movie 's plot does n't take place in kayak\u00f6y , it takes place along the istanbul-afyon railway . 
  this is like looking at the malta 's wikipedia page to find information about trojan war . 
  [ this is closer to the railway ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yalova_peninsula_massacres_ ( 1920 -- 21 \\ ) ) if you want to read wikipedia pages .
