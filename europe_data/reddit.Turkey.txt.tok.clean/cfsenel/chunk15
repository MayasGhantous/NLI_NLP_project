  there are countless small turkish villages along that route that were burnt away , that scene of the movie could be taking place in any of them . 
  i now found the new one you mentioned . 
  i believe it is this one : http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/app/conversion/pdf/?library=echr&amp;id=003-5199806-6438950&amp;filename=grand%20chamber%20judgment%20perincek%20v.%20switzerland%20.pdf i guess the relevant part is :  while in cases concerning statements in relation to the holocaust , the court had -- for historical and contextual reasons -- invariably presumed that they could be seen as a form of incitement to racial hatred , it did not consider that the same could be done in this case . 
  the context did not require automatically to presume that mr perin\u00e7ek 's statements relating to the 1915 events promoted a racist and antidemocratic agenda , and there was not enough evidence that this had been the case . 
  the swiss courts had referred to the fact that he was a self-professed follower of talaat pasha , who was historically the initiator of the massacres of 1915 . 
  however , the swiss courts had not elaborated on this point , and there was no evidence that mr perin\u00e7ek 's membership in the so-called talaat pasha committee had been driven by a wish to vilify the armenians . 
   in the court 's opinion , mr perin\u00e7ek 's statements , read as a whole and taken in their immediate and wider context , could not be seen as a call for hatred , violence or intolerance towards the armenians . 
  it followed that his statements , which concerned a matter of public interest , were entitled to heightened protection under article 10 , and that the swiss authorities had only had a limited room for manoeuvre ( `` margin of appreciation '' ) to interfere with them . 
  it basically says the same thing as the second quoted paragraph in my previous comment . 
  holocaust denial itself is seen as a form of incitement to racial hatred , so it can be criminalized , but there is no such equivalence in the armenian case . 
  it says calls for hatred , violence or intolerance towards the armenians can be penalized , which is reasonable ; many european countries have such hate speech laws . 
  indeed , such a correlation , as in the case of holocaust denial and antisemitism , would not make sense in this case , certainly not in turkey . 
  one of the most pro-armenian academics i know , bask\u0131n oran , refuses to label it as genocide , for example , whereas far right anti-armenian groups would n't have a problem recognizing it as such ( [ and they would be proud of it ] ( http://armenianweekly.com/2015/02/23/celebrating-genocide/ ) ) . 
  if any thing , the correlation is more likely to be the opposite . 
  but they refrained from statements that could be interpreted as comments on the veracity of the genocide label , which i believe was one the things the armenian side wanted in this case . 
   the court thus doubted that there could be a general consensus as to events such as those in issue here , given that historical research was by definition open to discussion and a matter of debate , without necessarily giving rise to final conclusions or to the assertion of objective and absolute truths . 
   in this connection , the court clearly distinguished the present case from those concerning the negation of the crimes of the holocaust . 
  in those cases , the applicants had denied the historical facts even though they were sometimes very concrete , such as the existence of the gas chambers . 
  they had denied the crimes perpetrated by the nazi regime for which there had been a clear legal basis . 
  lastly , the acts that they had called into question had been found by an international court to be clearly established . 
  http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/webservices/content/pdf/003-4613832-5581451 i do think that holocaust denial should not be subject to criminal investigation , but in any case equating the two is blatantly wrong , as the court agrees . 
  ( see bernard lewis 's explanation , for example : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qg70uwesfu4 ) this decision of the court upholds the criminalization of the denial of holocaust ( and possibly rwandan genocide ) , but not this one . 
  you 're right , it would depend on how the question is framed . 
  but my observation is , there is a tendency in the us to treat the constitution as a holy scripture , and the constitution very explicitly bans `` cruel and unusual punishment '' . 
  there is some debate as to whether it is acceptable to waterboard people for interrogation , but i think very few would support waterboarding as a punishment . 
  it is not even discussed , because , constitution . 
  as you say , some are ok with unofficial forms of torture as punishment . 
  but if you ask people `` should courts give waterboarding sentences '' or `` should courts give beating sentences '' etc , my guess is the answer would be a strong no , even though there is sizable support for courts giving death sentences . 
  but i have n't seen any polls about those , it 's just my observation . 
  they certainly coexist in europe . 
  there are a lot of people who would support reinstituting death penalty , but they would likely be categorically against torture if you talked to them , which is weird to me , i would have expected the opposite . 
  somehow we all agreed in the sentence `` torture is bad '' , but not so for death penalty . 
  even in the us , supporters of death penalty would be against torture as a punishment , even though there is some support for torturing for interrogation . 
  exactly . 
  i do n't get how the universal condemnation of torture coexists with the controversiality of death penalty . 
  death penalty is on all accords worse idea than torture ( as a punishment ) . 
  while it would be terrible if it turned out that the convict whom we have been torturing was innocent , it is still not as bad as having already killed him . 
  and if you are looking at it from a deterrence/retribution point of view , i think being tortured for life is much more deterrent/retributive than death penalty . 
  you 'd think we would have already scrapped death penalty from the books and debating about whether to abolish torture as a punishment ; i am surprised that we have it the other way around . 
  ( i am not defending torture as a punishment in case it 's not clear , i am saying death penalty is even more irrational . ), 
  akp pretty much consolidated the conservatives , islamists and center-right voters , those groups do n't have a major alternative other than akp . 
  currently , it is two groups , nationalists , and conservative kurds that may or may not vote for akp and decide the election 's fate . 
  nationalists mainly vote akp or mhp , and conservative kurds mainly vote akp or hdp . 
  ( leftist and nationalist kurds vote for hdp anyway , it is the conservative kurds that swing between hdp and akp . ), 
  if akp manages to get votes from either group they may be able to get majority in the parliament and form a government by themselves . 
  at the moment it looks more like they are after the nationalist vote , so the nationalists will be the `` swing vote '' , not kurds . 
  i do n't know any . 
  the concept does n't make much sense for most of europe , actually , because unlike the us , europe mostly uses proportional representation . 
  usually we do n't even call it `` winning a province '' , because it does n't matter , it is only useful for coloring the map . 
  and in elections , the colors usually remain the same , but the proportions determine the outcome . 
  or if the percentages were close , the color sometimes changes in the election , but it does n't make a difference in terms of the number of mps . 
  not to mention , it makes even less sense when you do n't have a two-party system . 
  a party may come the first , but two other parties with similar views might have actually `` won '' the province and got most mps there in total . 
  so i 'd say the concept is mostly an american one , and we do n't have an ohio . 
  but if you are wondering which province 's election results correlate most with overall results , my guess would be istanbul , simply because one fifths of the country 's population lives there and its population consists of people immigrated from every province , so it 's quite statistically representative of the country . 
  if you are not popular in istanbul , you probably are not popular country-wide either . 
  i was about to be enraged , and surprised why i did n't see it in turkish media , so i checked the turkish sources and that 's not what he said at all . 
  [ source in turkish ] ( http://www.trthaber.com/haber/gundem/bakan-erogludan-ankaradaki-patlama-sonrasi-aciklama-208278.html ) [ video ] ( http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/haber/siyaset/385157/akp_li_eroglu_ndan_ankara_daki_patlama_icin_skandal_aciklama.html ) he is n't calling the demonstration as terrorist , he is calling the terrorist attack as terrorist . 
  and he is referring the terrorists as provocateurs , who are trying to disrupt peace before the elections . 
  the only part that could be called scandalous is , he is implying that the attack is made so that akp will lose votes and others ( probably hdp ) will gain votes . 
  so he is implying pkk may have conducted the attack to benefit hdp . 
  he should n't be saying that without proof , it 's horrible , but he did n't say the things in the title . 
  and to give background , bug\u00fcn is a g\u00fclenist newspaper , who used to be fervently pro-akp , and now vehemently anti-akp since g\u00fclen and erdogan had their disagreement . 
  this is not the first time i saw them deliberately mistranslate things . 
  they have my sympathy for finally turning anti-akp , but it is not alright to mislead people to push their agenda . 
  in that case , ` fight ' is the wrong translation . 
  in turkish sava\u015f quite literally means war . 
  let alone things like poverty or drugs , you would n't even say `` war on terror '' in turkish using the word ` sava\u015f ' ( i.e. 
  `` ter\u00f6r ile sava\u015f '' ) , because that word only implies armed conflict between two countries . 
  you would say `` ter\u00f6r ile m\u00fccadele '' - `` the fight against terror '' . 
  ` sava\u015f ' is usually for real war . 
  http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/08/us-myanmar-violence-specialreport-idusbre9370ap20130408 you 'd think so , but that does n't appear to be the case at least with buddhism in myanmar . 
  we were europe 's arch-nemesis for centuries . 
  um , no it was n't . 
  turkey was just one of the major players in europe . 
  it formed alliances with some and fought wars with others . 
  sure , it attempted to conquer rest of europe and at times most other european powers united against that . 
  they also united when france tried to do that . 
  they also united against russia . 
  same with germany , etc. 
  if anything , trying to conquer rest of europe was the most european thing turkey ever did , many other european nations also tried and failed . 
  i know where you are coming from , it 's how they teach history in turkey , always this `` us against the whole world '' thinking . 
  enough with it already . 
  i do n't know which europe is it we are the arch-nemesis of , but turkey was sometimes allied and sometimes enemy with uk , sometimes allied and sometimes enemy with france , sometimes allied and sometimes enemy with germany , and mostly enemy with russia . 
  that was exactly what the deleted comment said . 
  did you not read my reply or are you not content with parts of it ? 
  to repeat , the initial post express hopes for a chp-hdp coalition . 
  to which i said that is not possible in short term , but akp-chp is a possibility , even though i would prefer initial post 's suggestion ( chp-hdp ) over that . 
  to repeat , i would prefer chp-mhp coalition over akp-chp or any akp coalition as well . 
  and to repeat , these are just long term speculations , in the short term , there will be either an akp-chp or akp-mhp coalition , or akp single party government , among which i find akp-chp most preferable . 
  sure , if chp gets enough seats in the parliament . 
  but as i said above , there is no way chp + hdp will reach that number in the short term , and chp doing that alone is even more impossible . 
  yeah . 
  it is interesting to think what would happen . 
  turkey would become [ blue on this map ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:same_sex_marriage_map_europe_detailed.svg ) when a lot of eu members are still red . 
  * `` but i thought turkey was going islamist !, 
  '' * that 's impossible when akp is in government of course ; the most they would do is agreeing to extend the discrimination law to lgbt as part of a coalition compromise . 
  ( interestingly akp itself proposed such a bill in 2010 , and they later scrapped that part in the parliament . ), 
  what i said was i would prefer chp-hdp coalition to akp-chp . 
  ( he suggested chp-hdp , i said it is impossible in the short term but akp-chp is a real possibility , and while they are both more positive alternatives , i definitely prefer the former . ),
