  there are many things about hdp that i do n't like , but even if you equate them with pkk , i think erdogan is a greater threat to turkey than pkk could ever be . 
  pkk issue aside , what is there not to like about a hypothetical chp-hdp coalition ? 
  it would be the most progressive turkish government in history in terms of social policies and liberties . 
  edit : i noticed you quickly edited the post , i did n't see the last part about mhp when replying . 
  about that , i would prefer chp-mhp to any coalition involving akp as well . 
  chp-mhp vs chp-hdp is another matter , but it does n't really matter at this point , both are just hypothetical discussions with no chance of actualization in the short term . 
  you sound like you belong to the `` ulusalc\u0131 '' faction of chp , so i can see why you are strongly opposed to the latter . 
  akp and chp were the only parties that held coalition talks after the elections . 
  chp was initially hoping for an anti-akp coalition ( chp-mhp-hdp ) , but mhp ( nationalists ) categorically rejected being involved with hdp in any way , and they also did n't want to form a coalition with akp . 
  their stance may change after this election , i do n't know . 
  of course akp and chp are huge rivals , so neither party 's base really favored such a coalition , like the one germany currently has . 
  but that also has advantages . 
  there is n't much voter flow between them ( akp gains and loses votes to mhp and hdp , same for chp ) , so they wo n't have to fight each other to gain each other 's votes during the coalition , which is what brought down many coalitions before in turkey . 
  sure , they have important differences in foreign policy and education , but akp is going to have to fix its shitty foreign policy no matter with whom they form a coalition . 
  for this election , i would say the chances of akp-chp and akp-mhp coalitions are fifty fifty ( unless akp wins enough seats ) . 
  it depends on whether the mhp will change its stance ( since there are no longer talks with pkk , which was what they primarily objection ) and which faction in akp will prevail . 
   the lack of progress that we 've seen in the past 15 years is a direct result of akp 's policies . 
  quite the opposite , actually . 
  the biggest progress in terms of eu-related reforms occurred in 2002-2007 , akp 's first term ; and eu agreed to start membership negotiations only in 2004 . 
  so many laws were scrapped and rewritten to reach eu standards , some with chp 's support . 
  at the time akp was more pro-eu and chp was more nationalistic . 
  accordingly akp was eu 's darling , whereas eu bashed chp and kemalists all the time ( and not without good reason ) . 
  nowadays chp is more pro-eu than akp , but it 's not like akp is advocating islamist policies as some on reddit would have you believe . 
  the thing is , erdogan turned increasingly authoritarian after 2010 , and akp basically became erdogan 's fan club ; but i still have hopes for a post-erdogan akp to renormalize . 
  i would definitely prefer a chp-hdp coalition , but that wo n't be possible nowhere in the short term , and an akp-chp coalition could still be positive . 
  yeah , akp wo n't approve legalizing gay marriage and such , but akp and chp mostly agree on eu standards . 
  the main obstacle is erdogan 's authoritarianism and his desire to continue to rule akp despite becoming president , which is why he forced this election . 
   and it 's not as if the dispute is actually over the [ right to fly aircraft through ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/26/us-warplanes-defy-china-b-52-flyover ) , but over who owns the area -- flying an aircraft through does n't establish a de facto situation in either side 's favor . 
  are you sure that is the case ? 
  if my understanding is correct , [ greece claims an airspace of 10 miles and turkey only recognizes 6 miles . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aegean_dispute ) so turkey does n't claim the area , they just say `` this is international airspace , i have the right to fly my airplanes '' , and in response greece sends their airplanes to assert their claim that it 's their airspace . 
  this sounds exactly like the link you gave , us warplanes defying chinese air claims . 
  no more often than greece does it to turkey . 
  and turkey and russia do n't have a sort of [ aegean dispute ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aegean_dispute ) where airspace limits are disputed . 
  [ `` why migrants are going to great lengths to avoid this eu country '' ] ( http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2015/09/28/why-migrants-are-going-to-great-lengths-to-avoid-this-eu-country/ ) basically they do n't go to cyprus because it does n't allow family reunification , not because there is sea in between . 
  crossing the sea is not that big of a problem , almost everybody going to greece from turkey does so through the sea . 
  the land border tend to be more protected . 
  yeah , glancing at / r/europe keeps making you think `` been there , done that '' . 
  all those news articles and discussions are exactly same as those we had a few years ago . 
  we are so bored we do n't even discuss it anymore . 
  could it be because there is nothing surprising about the content ? 
  i have been wondering why people are upvoting this . 
  apparently they read islamic and assume it is isis . 
  and looks like there is n't much moderation in / r/europe anymore , you can just cherrypick parts and editorialize a title to make it sound shocking , and people easily fall for that . 
  i would n't be surprised if us or france was sending those arms to them through turkey . 
  if it was found that us is supplying arms to al-nusra for example , that would be news . 
  this is not news . 
  the thing is , this is not a conflict like ww2 , with two well defined sides that are allied within . 
  the situation is much more complex . 
  one day , two rebel groups fight with each other . 
  other day , they both feel threatened by isis and cooperate against it . 
  another day , all three of them cooperate against hezbollah . 
  next day they again fight each other . 
  you admit there is no alliance yourself , by mentioning what would happen if there was one , which is not happening . 
  krg wo n't help pkk against turkey , if anything they are more likely to help turkey against pkk . 
  yet on another front they indeed fight against isis together . 
  but having a common enemy is not sufficient to be considered allies . 
  us and al-qaeda both fight isis as well . 
  also , you sound like you do n't realize the consequences of your assumptions . 
  pkk is the one that is attacking turkey , so it is natural that turkey fights back ; but by your logic they are all `` kurdish forces '' , so turkey should be attacking them all , pyd and krg . 
  fortunately , everybody realizes that the ww2-like alliance you speak of does n't exist . 
  oh , ok , if you want to consider the `` kurdish forces '' as one side , then turkey is simultaneously allied , cautiously neutral , and bitterly enemy with them at the same time , there is your answer . 
  presumably denmark has the same attitude towards the `` arabic forces '' . 
  or you know , you could realize that groups are not defined by where they happened to be positioned at a particular conflict , and that they are different groups with different ideologies and ideals . 
  so , which kurdish forces ? 
  do you support danish raids on arabic forces ? 
  just asking , nothing implied . 
  yeah , if you say there is a kurt in my apple , people would understand you are talking about a worm . 
  other than that , kurt usually refers to wolf . 
  basically they are just homonyms , like how bat refers to the animal and stick . 
  kurt also means worm in turkish , so maybe not . 
  actually , etymologically , worm is the original meaning of kurt . 
  wolf was originally called b\u00f6ri , but it fell out of use probably due to superstitions of medieval turks . 
  they must have avoided using it because they considered the animal sacred ( and possibly because they were afraid that saying the name would summon the beast ) . 
  i have no idea why the word for worm took its place , but it 's a good thing for the badassness of your friend . 
  today kurt mainly refers to wolf , except in the context of fruits . 
  [ there were n't any greeks in the area . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/prorportions_des_populations_musulmanes_grecques_et_armeniennes_en_asiemineure_d'apres_la_statistique_du_livrejaune.png ) overall population was mostly kurds and armenians . 
  the cities were mostly inhabited by turks and arabs rather than kurds , who were rural ; but with to the decimation of armenians and their high fertility rates , kurds emerged as the dominant ethnicity in those regions in the 20th century . 
  i do n't think it is necessarily because there was kurdish immigration to those cities . 
  there were already kurds in the area , and kurds historically have high fertility rates ; with the armenians gone , it should n't have taken them long to repopulate the cities . 
  for example , compared to the 1927 census , kurdish population increased 11-fold in 90 years ( 1,184,000 to 13 million , or even greater according to some estimates ) , much higher than the turkish average . 
  even today , the kurdish population growth is the main reason turkey does n't face the ageing problem as the rest of europe . 
  see the [ median age map of turkey ] ( http://aygunhoca.com/images/haritalarim/2012-ortanca-yas-hart.png ) , for example . 
  alternative map of the same data [ is here ] ( http://fotocdncube.gazetevatan.com/newpics/news/080220130124487736213_4.jpg ) , which is from [ this page . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:turkey_total_fertility_rate_by_province_2014.png ), 
   strange how a simple banner , after more than half a century , can still evoke such presence simply by being draped over a building . 
  reminds me when [ a small group of people took offense when byzantine/crusader flags were hung in the city 's castle for a historic documentary ] ( http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/default.aspx?pageid=438&amp;n=byzantine-flag-causes-outrage-in-kayseri-2008-09-18 ) , after more than 9 centuries . 
  it 's been almost a millennium man , relax , byzantine empire is n't going to invade your city . 
   we give rights and welfare to refugees . 
  turkey places tents and keeps most of them locked up with a chance of 0 staying in turkey or become a turkish national . 
  i keep seeing this claim on / r/europe . 
  i do n't know what is the source of this misunderstanding , maybe it 's how jordan treats refugees . 
  officially , [ there are 1,905,984 syrians in turkey ( actual number is estimated to be around 2.5 million ) , and only 262,134 of them are in camps . 
  ] ( http://www.todayszaman.com/columnists_is-turkey-abandoning-its-open-door-policy-towards-syrians_397388.html ) the rest roams in the cities . 
  the ones in camps are free to leave as well , actually the government would prefer if they did so . 
  it 's expensive to accommodate so many people in camps . 
  and they do get benefits , though not as much as they would get in western european countries . 
  ( germany would n't be able to give the same benefits if it had 2 million refugees either . ), 
  and 0 chance of staying in turkey ?
