  or was that there anything else that is suspicious ? 
  or is he blaming turkey only because the people involved were bulgarian turks ? 
  the link you gave cites an attack in 1985 , at which time we had the \u00d6zal government . 
  i know the relations was n't very good ( actually i only know the about [ naim s\u00fcleymano\u011flu 's defection ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/naim_s\u00fcleymano\u011flu ) regarding bulgaria at the time ) , but i would be very surprised to hear turkey had anything to do with that attack . 
   have you listened to what erdogan has said about bulgaria lately ? 
  what did he say ? 
  i think it did n't make the news here , and googling in turkish did n't help , so i 'm curious . 
  not a day goes by in turkey without him saying something scandalous , so i 'm sure he said something outrageous about you as well . 
  wait , are you saying turkey supported a terrorist attack in bulgaria ? 
  i really do n't know anything about such an event , can you give details / source ? 
  ( the link that / u/omortag gave does n't mention turkey . ), 
   i 'm afraid , no country of this size is a beneficiary at this moment , except us . 
  that 's not true . 
  [ there are much larger countries that enjoy visa free travel to the schengen area ( also much poorer ones ) . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/visa_policy_of_the_schengen_area#visa_policy_map )  you 'll have to admit that this not easy . 
  there is n't really anything difficult about it . 
  you realize we are not talking about turkey joining the schengen area , right ? 
  just turkish tourists will be able to visit eu , without having to pay $ 60 at embassies beforehand . 
  it 's not like turkish citizens will go to eu and claim to be refugees once they arrive . 
  ( if they do , they would just be deported back to turkey . ), 
  well , istanbul 's quality of life can be very low , if you do n't have the money . 
  and that is what they are hoping to get in europe ; government welfare and the prospect of working in decent jobs . 
  neither of the sources you mention contradicts what i said or supports your claims . 
  this has nothing to do with bias , we are talking about undisputed numbers and facts here . 
  indeed , you need to be either an outright liar or immensely ignorant beyond belief to claim that syrian refugees are confined to camps . 
  i mean , just go anywhere in turkey , the cities are overflowing with them , and there is n't enough accommodation . 
  perhaps you believe that the turkish government is conspiring to make it appear so by paying turks to pretend to be syrian refugees and live in city parks , and paying other turks to carry out xenophobic attacks against them . 
   i do n't recall you turks accepting the same reasoning there is n't a homogeneous group `` us turks '' you know . 
  there are turks with different political views . 
  for your example , on the contrary , i have not met any turks who did n't blame the turkish immigrants in germany for not integrating and causing problems . 
  they are universally made fun of in turkey , for even failing to learn german and preserving their village habits in cities . 
  as for me , i think they should n't only integrate , but assimilate . 
  i blame them for not assimilating , and i blame germans for not assimilating them ( leftists did n't want to , because of the multiculturalism nonsense , and racists did n't want to , because they were racists . ), 
   first of all , syrian war refugees are confined in particular camps near the border and the aid they receive is over 80 % from foreign donations you are shamelessly lying and getting upvoted for that . 
  incredible . 
  [ only 10 % of refugees live in camps , the rest live in cities . 
  ] ( http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/order-from-chaos/posts/2015/07/08-turkey-syrian-refugees-kirisci-ferris ) and you already knew that ; why else would they face xenophobia that you mention if they were confined to camps ? 
  when millions of refugees uncontrollably start to roam in the streets , xenophobia and violence soars ; same things happened when a very small percentage of them made their way into eu . 
  and unlike eu countries , turkey is unable to provide a decent standard of living for them , so they cause huge societal problems . 
  [ and the aid turkey receives is only 5 % . 
  ] ( http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkey-urges-worlds-help-on-syrian-refugees-as-spending-reaches-6-billion.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=78951&amp;newscatid=359 ) i hope that increased after the world attention , but in no way a significant percentage of the costs is covered from foreign donations . 
   i could n't help but think : `` we do n't negotiate with terrorists because of the precedent '' that 's the standard american thinking , which makes sense , but unfortunately a lot of european governments do not act this way . 
  [ a lot of them ( although not uk ) pays ransom to isis , while publicly denying it , for example . 
  ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2731015/the-grubby-multi-million-dollar-trade-hostages-fueling-rise-isis-how-european-allies-undermine-us-negotiate-terrorists.html ) we still do n't know what turkey paid them to secure release of 49 embassy staff . 
  ( although , in their defence , they had to save them . 
  just imagine they were beheaded one by one every day on camera , basically the pr equivalent of the christopher stevens killing 49 times ; no government could survive that . 
  and even if the government took `` we do n't negotiate '' stance , the public opinion would probably shift after the first few beheadings , which is represented by the cutting of the finger in the episode . ), 
  so to suspend your disbelief , imagine it is not the american government , but a european one . 
  i do n't know if an officer made such an empty threat to scare them , but there is no way on earth they will be deported to syria . 
  but hey , whatever helps the guardian fill its daily quota of `` evil turkey '' and `` poor refugees '' news at once . 
  ( i 'm not saying that the refugees are n't in a wretched situation , but the guardian 's tone gets annoying at times . ), 
  [ here is the list of most common 50 surnames from government 's website . 
  the first occupational surname ( and the only one i could see in the list ) is `` avc\u0131 '' , which means hunter . 
  exactly , i have no doubts about that . 
  but they pretend that they have nothing to do with kurdish nationalism ( [ `` ypg is a syrian national group whose battles are directed solely against isis '' ] ( http://www.cbsnews.com/news/kurds-accused-ethnic-cleansing-syria-rebels-isis/ ) ) , and they secure western support that way . 
  this also hinders the fight against isis . 
  when arabs and turkmens see that kurds are trying to incorporate their areas at their expense with the support of us , they feel alienated and isis probably appears as the only side that defends them . 
   they ban all the kurds from efrin to cross the border into turkey . 
  they just allow the arabs to cross into turkey through efrin . 
  in other words , they do want major demographic changes in areas they control . 
  they just want it to happen [ in the direction they want . 
  ] ( http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/ankara-warns-pyd-over-demographic-change-in-northern-syria.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=84296&amp;newscatid=510 ), 
  / u / _ eerie said the same thing below . 
  i guess in poland egypt is seen more as a tourist destination than turkey , which is surprising to me . 
  ( [ normally turkey is a much more well-known tourist destination ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_tourism_rankings ) ) . 
  any idea why ? 
  are you as a nation very interested in the pyramids or something ? 
  another commentator said the same thing above . 
  it is interesting that egypt carries more connotation of tourism than turkey does in poland . 
  i guess this a uniquely polish thing , otherwise [ turkey is more popular and more well known for its tourism . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_tourism_rankings ), 
   polish people do n't like islam and arabs . 
  egypt , which is both islamic and arabic , is seen positively according to the map , and turkey , secular and non-arabic , is seen very negatively . 
  either other factors are in play here , or polish people think of ancient egypt when they are asked about egypt . 
  http://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2015/09/12/saudi-says-it-has-taken-in-25m-syrians-since-conflict-began  saudi arabia 's statement emphasized that the kingdom has provided some $ 700 million to support syrian refugees , including those living in jordan and lebanon . 
  its aid included food and medical supplies , the establishment of clinics in refugee camps , and payments to cover rent and living costs to families living in lebanon and syria . 
  i suppose they would mention if any of the aid was coming to turkey . 
  i do n't know about other gulf states . 
  but egypt seems to be viewed positively , when they are much more islamic ( even their official state religion is islam , as opposed to secular turkey ) ? 
  wtf poland ? 
  we did n't do anything to you . 
  i mean , ok , we tried to vassalize you a few times and such , but that did n't really work out and in return you fucked us big time . 
  i think we should at least be even , why the hate ? 
  at best , you are just being americentrist here . 
  i get that you have a definition of race and racism that works well for you in america , but things are different in other places . 
  by your definition , there are no racists in a lot of european countries ( including mine ) because we have almost no black or asian people and therefore nobody has any reason to hate them . 
  which is why the definition you use is not in use here . 
  in turkey we have racists who hate the kurdish race . 
  admittedly our threshold for racial differences is much lower than yours ( e.g. 
  kurds are slightly hairier and slightly darker skinned than turks on average ) because we have less racial variation , and yours is wider ; but it 's not like there are determined racial definitions that are fundamentally correct . 
  your lumping of all those different races ( from our point of view ) into one seems equally weird to me ; but as i said , whatever works for your society , just do n't imagine that everywhere is like america . 
   instanbul refers to the turkic and muslim era where the city ceased to be connected with europe to a large degree , and thus became less important to europe . 
  i do n't know what you are talking about . 
  istanbul declined in importance after the fourth crusade , and became one of the most important cities once again after the turkish conquest . 
  it was the most populous city in europe and a significant part of europe was administered from there . 
  it started to become less important with the decline of the ottomans . 
  in any case , the distinction you are suggesting is absurd . 
  sometimes there can be different cities in the same location , when a city is abandoned and later a new city is founded in its place . 
  no such thing happened with istanbul , the city remained there with its demographics slowly changing throughout centuries since its foundation . 
  it had different names in various languages and even within the same language , and you can use them for historical purposes , but pretending you are talking about different cities is unreasonable .
