  if it was up to me , i would just declare imia/kardak is greek and be done with it . 
  politically , greece repeating the thing that almost caused war 20 years ago was n't a sign of goodwill though . 
  mhp people were all like `` no , we should do something to infuriate the greeks more '' . 
  fortunately they were n't in the coalition , i do n't want to think how things will escalate if akp and mhp form a coalition and mhp gets the ministry of defence . 
  kammenos and bah\u00e7eli would get along too well . 
   to me though it would look more like a huge disrespect against thousands of people who have died while fighting to free or protect this territory in the past . 
  it is entertaining to see nationalists are using the exact same logic across the aegean , verbatim . 
  `` thousands of turks died in the past for nationalism , so let 's die again protecting this [ useless uninhabited stupid piece of clay ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/imia/kardak ) in order to honor their death '' . 
  you guys would be best friends , if you were n't born on the opposite sides of the sea . 
  and imagining nonexisting enemies ... 
  so typical . 
  i am sure nobody in greece except for an insane minority aspires to conquer istanbul , yet turkish nationalists can convince themselves that they should be alert of the threat . 
  and nobody except for marginal minority would want to conquer `` over half of the greek aegean islands '' , yet that is what comes to your mind when one says peace . 
  nationalist logic , same everywhere ... 
  this sounds like reverse reductio ad hitlerum . 
  `` smoking is bad . '', 
  - `` you know who else was against smoking ? 
  `` they killed civilians . '', 
  - `` you know who else was delegitimized for killing civilians ? 
  turkish armed forces used to keep a list of violations by greece ( [ 2012 ] ( http://web.archive.org/web/20130830071145/http://www.tsk.tr/11_haberler_olaylar/11_2_hava_ihlalleri/hava_sahasi_ihlalleri_2012.htm ) , [ 2013 ] ( http://web.archive.org/web/20131005140221/http://www.tsk.tr/11_haberler_olaylar/11_2_hava_ihlalleri/hava_sahasi_ihlalleri_2013.htm ) ) ( technically it is a list of all violations , but they are all greek ) . 
  they do n't make it public anymore , but [ here is a recent article . 
  ] ( http://www.todayszaman.com/anasayfa_greek-jets-violate-turkish-airspace-over-aegean-sea_374605.html ), 
  when syriza came into power , hopes were high that this ridiculous game would finally end , or at least frozen . 
  unfortunately , they had to form a coalition with nationalists ( anel ) , and their defence minister is instead keen on [ irritating turkey ] ( http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/greek-minister-leaves-wreath-at-aegean-hotspot-sparking-confrontation-with-turkey.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=77710&amp;newscatid=351 ) , which is not surprising , as his political interests lie in the continuation of tensions with turkey . 
  i ca n't see turkey backpedaling either , so this farce will probably continue . 
  i can only hope that either side wo n't do anything too stupid . 
  `` and why should ankara back down from turkish territory ? 
  this article is making it look like a dispute over something neutral ... '' said your turkish nationalist counterpart . 
  which is why no issues on the balkans are settled peacefully ever . 
  turkey is in no position to make any demands . 
  if ak\u0131nc\u0131 thinks that turkish army should not be on the island after unification ( which i agree ) , he should just bring it on the table during the negotiations . 
  it 's not like turkey will stage coup against him . 
  and if the two sides accept the solution , but turkey decides to be a jerk about it and insists on keeping its army , then greek and turkish cypriots can jointly fight to remove them . 
  it is hard to imagine that turkey will fight against turkish cypriot forces , it will just have to relent . 
  and i have never heard about turkey 's demand about cyprus oil . 
  that is a truly ridiculous demand if it is real . 
  but again , turkey is in no position to make that demand , and ak\u0131nc\u0131 should just dismiss it . 
  i do n't think it is anti-turkish either , that 's just that wikipedia page that i first noticed it . 
  turkish coffee is still drunk in turkey , but it came to be more of a ceremonial drink , served when greeting a guest . 
  other than that , tea is drunk all day long . 
  it 's interesting , because there was virtually no tea consumption before 1940s , and today we even surpassed the british and [ became number one consumers per capita . 
  ] ( http://qz.com/168690/where-the-worlds-biggest-tea-drinkers-are/ ) according to an explanation , the change occurred because it was difficult to import coffee during the world war 2 and the currency crisis of 70s , but people managed to cultivate tea in turkey on the black sea coast , so tea replaced coffee . 
  people got accustomed to its taste , and this exigency of the times of economic hardship became permanent . 
  it shows the writer 's best judgment on what most americans will laugh , and i think generally they are doing a good job at that . 
  i am sure there are americans who are more informed about estonia , who would be puzzled when they hear the joke ( `` what ? 
  but estonia is actually one of the most tech savvy countries in the world , what a silly joke !, 
  '' ) , but my point is that the show tries to play on the stereotypes by american people . 
  john oliver 's being from the uk does not change that , he still goes on and tells those jokes even though they would n't make sense in the uk/europe . 
   why use a british dude as an example of american opinion ? 
  he is from uk , but that is an american show and the jokes are geared towards american audience . 
  i think it better reflects american stereotypes . 
  for example , he twice joked how it would be humiliating to be worse than estonia regarding internet ( [ 1 ] ( https://youtu.be/kgxglvm_2oy?t=25s ) , [ 2 ] ( https://youtu.be/fpboeorrhyu?t=8m35s ) ) , because estonia ought to be a backward country regarding internet . 
  i do n't think anyone from europe would laugh . 
  the stereotype would be the opposite , actually , estonia would be viewed as one of the most progressive countries internet-wise . 
  the show just reflects an american 's knowledge about estonia , which presumably only includes that estonia is a post-soviet country . 
  it is ironic that serbians have the idiom [ `` he smokes like a turk '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-turkism#sayings ) , when you guys more than double us nowadays . 
  john oliver immediately came to my mind as well , he uses that stereotype [ often ] ( https://youtu.be/j6lyuryvz7k?t=4m1s ) . 
  i do n't know rest of europe , but the stereotype exists in turkey particularly for french women . 
  an attractive woman smoking cigarette sounds extremely frenchy to me . 
  i guess it is probably because smoking was a more mannish thing in turkey and balkans until recently , whereas it was more egalitarian in france . 
  french movies in the 80s must have helped spread the stereotype . 
  millions of muslims had to flee balkans and caucasia in the late 19th and early 20th century . 
  today , they are not distinguished from turks at all . 
  it would be used more as a geographic identifier today , rather than an ethnic one . 
  saying you have chechen ancestry would not be considered so different from , say , having adana ( a city in turkey ) ancestry . 
  caucasian people enjoy their food , adana people enjoy their food , bosniak people enjoy their food , izmir people enjoy their food , etc. 
  bosnia might as well be the name of a city in turkey , in terms of people 's perception . 
  so in those terms , chechen people are not considered ` alien ' at all , they are thought more as one of the elements that constitute ` turkishness ' . 
  the only muslim group that is slightly dissociated nowadays is kurds , because of this pkk conflict . 
  edit : thinking about it , maybe you could compare it to the , say , irish american case . 
  they are as american as the next guy , and not so related to ireland other than maybe one or two things . 
  yet they could still call themselves irish as heritage , and affect how irish are perceived in us . 
  you would n't get a negative image of irish because of something people in ireland do , because you know a dozen `` irish '' people whom you perceive as no different than yourself . 
  not surprisingly , they are seen mostly positively in turkey ( religion factor , and turkey was generally sympathetic to the chechen cause during the chechen wars for historical reasons ) . 
  but the stereotype you speak of certainly exists . 
  i remember a video of chechens beheading russian soldiers was quite infamous in turkey in the 90s , people shared it with each other at those pre-liveleak days and watched it in disgust . 
  and it was very nauseating in the good old days when the likes of isil were n't around and people have n't gotten used to such things . 
  but the stereotype usually concern chechen people in russia , not in turkey . 
  those in turkey have mostly arrived as a result of the [ caucasian war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/caucasian_war ) and are largely turkified . 
  and what do you imagine turkish troops can do if turkey for some reason tries to prevent a deal ( which is already very unlikely as i said ) ? 
  will they arrest ak\u0131nc\u0131 , stage a coup against a president who was democratically elected under the system they helped create and tried to legitimize for decades ? 
  that would be suicide for turkey . 
  and also , what if northern cypriot military decides to resist ? 
  will turkey go to war against turkish cypriots ? 
  i ca n't see how the turkish military can get involved with anything at this point . 
  not to mention , if turkey was so insanely stupid to do anything of the sort , the only result would be help cement the unification , not only politically , but also in the minds ( nothing brings people closer than a common enemy ) . 
  greek cypriots are negotiating with turkish cypriots , not with the turkish government . 
  if they reach an agreement and both sides approve it , what is turkey going to do ? 
  currently it can affect northern cyprus politics because of the financial aid that goes there , but it wo n't matter after unification . 
  [ probably eu will fund the unification process anyway . 
  ] ( http://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2015/07/16/juncker-urges-cypriot-leaders-to-seize-chance-for-peace ) and you are mistaken about the roles . 
  at least for the last decade or so , turkish government has generally been much more willing about a solution than the turkish cypriot one . 
  northern cyprus is just a huge burden on turkey 's shoulders . 
  oh , i have been wondering the reason of such a low percentage in greece ( 0.9 % ) , so i was quick to believe in the author 's statement . 
  so , the aversion to uht is just cultural , not because of the law . 
  in that case , the author 's remark seems quite pointless , really . 
  it is not so strange to request that fresh milk is sold fresh . 
   greece is the only country in europe that , by law , limits the shelf life of milk to five days so that 's why greece is so low on [ this list ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ultra-high-temperature_processing#popularity ) , whereas when greece exluded there is an almost perfect northern-southern europe divison . 
  mystery solved . 
  uht milk does n't make sense if you have to sell it in five days .
