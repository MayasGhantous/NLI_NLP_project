how did you get erdogan ? 
  i 've tried the . com , . co.uk and couple other with no cookies and proxies but did n't get him . 
  not erdo\u011fan , he is the president . 
  it 's b\u00fclent ar\u0131n\u00e7 and here is the [ video . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwedxdl_tv4 ) he seems to only know a little bit . 
  yes but turkey does n't recognize refugees from syria as refugees . 
  only people from the west is recognized as refugees . 
  meme means boob in turkish . 
  also writing about how peace was hurting kurds and pkk should start attacking turkey again about a year ago . 
  i guess she got what she wanted . 
  last year the average precipitation in depth in turkey was 7 % less than spain and [ this ] ( http://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/mpeel/koppen/world_koppen_map.png ) is the climate map . 
  again , this little difference in population distribution and climate does n't explain the 35 % difference . 
  that does n't really explain it . 
  turkey is more mountainous than spain and like spain most people live on the coast except ankara and 1-2 non-coastal cities .

  damn , that 's really bad . 
  conscripts are getting 100 $ per month if they are in east/southeast turkey , 11 $ if they are n't . 
  the ban got lifted 1.5 hours ago , 40 minutes after this post . 
  according to treaty invasion was legal not occupation . 
  saying many isis members are kurdish is definitely an exaggeration but there are certainly kurds fighting for/helping isis . 
  kurds fighting against kurds is also nothing new . 
  clashes between [ kurdish/turkish hezbollah ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kurdish_hezbollah ) and pkk were mostly common in '80s and '90s but they started attacking each other in the last 2 years . 
  [ here is an article about the clashes last year .

  it is hard to convince people to buy an electric car for 150k-200k $ . 
  random character laugh is the shit , lenght of the word shows how much you 're laughing so it 's easier to write `` adsfasdfgfdzsgyufgadhfkjashjasd '' or `` j\u0131sdhfahsdgvhkabhkpi\u00e7lervbaskvashdfgajsdf '' than `` hahahahahhahahahahahaha '' . 
  i tried to say which kurdish group are you talking about and had a brain fart . 
  also okay , you 're right . 
  argue ? 
  there is seriously no arguement about it . 
  which group are you preffering as kurdish nationalists ? 
  mhp 's past is much much worse ? 
  i am pretty sure they also count for districts . 
  this morning mhp lost a seat to hdp in some city after counting the expat 's votes . 
  you are right actually , the hatred for akp made conservative kurds and leftist turks vote for hdp . 
  if the rule of akp was n't so shit , there would probably be no kurdish party in parliament without entering as independent candidates . 
  mersin also voted tactically i think , not as much as izmir but chp lost 2 % and there is almost no reason for chp to lose votes in mersin other than voting for hdp . 
  mhp could n't even pass 7-8 % in the next elections if they did that . 
  it is not some quick summary , that 's what people who want to suck erdogan 's cock says . 
  yeah , akp managed to get 66 % of the seats with only 34 % of the votes in 2002 because of the threshold . 
  they are gambling so the odds are 50/50 . 
  i do n't think you can really say mhp is islamic or secularist . 
  i think they get too much votes from secularists to call themselves islamic . 
  this sunday . 
  akp probably going to have enough seats to form a one-party government but like last elections not enough to change constitution . 
  also erdogan is the president now not the prime minister and presidency is mostly ceremonial in turkey . 
  no , the only party that can gain votes from akp is far-right mhp but mhp is also kinda secularist . 
  in 2002 , akp got 34 % of the votes and 66 % of the seats ; in 2011 , akp got 50 % of the votes and 59.5 % of the seats . 
  in this elections they are probably going to be between 38-44 % of the votes so there is actually a slim chance that they wo n't even be able to form a government . 
  you guys should try out the new altay tanks ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  i hope china wo n't ask for reperations for making them build the great wall . 
  but they are neither islamic nor communist . 
  their chance to win this elections is very slim but if akp and chp keep what they are doing for the past 2-3 years we could see a chp+mhp coalition . 
  let me dream m8 . 
  that does n't happen . 
  he is tall and people see him as one of their own . 
  they like it when he says bad stuff to israel/west or his opponents because a person who is shouting a lot must be good leader . 
  there is n't a threshold for independent candidates so a party can still be in the parliament even with only one mp . 
  kurdish parties always went for this tactic but this time they are gambling and hopefully they 'll win . 
  you need 270 seats to form a government , 330 for holding a referendum about changing the constitution and 367 for changing the constitution without referendum . 
  erdogan wants to change the constitution so he can become a president without any prime ministers similar to usa . 
  none of the other three parties supports this so it 's probably not going to happen . 
  if hdp passes the 10 % limit we might see a coalition of chp-mhp-hdp ( kemalist centre-left , far right nationalists and pro-kurdish left ) or another election . 
  something something surrender , something something stinky . 
  [ minister of industry and trade drank a glass of tea to prove there is no radiation effecting it . 
  no , i 'm not saying legitimate . 
  i 'm saying it would be foolish not to expect a people from any race to have some kind of revenge idea against innocent civillians when they see civillians from their side face atrocities . 
  of course it would be better if nobody killed any innocent civilians but we are all human with dark emotions in the end . 
  to be fair we do n't have enough evidence to accuse either side for the fire . 
  it would also be foolish to not expect massacres from turkish side since the greek retreat was much much worse than the actual greek occupation . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greco-turkish_war_ ( 1919 % e2 % 80 % 9322 ) #atrocities _ and_claims_of_ethnic_cleansing_by_both_sides i also do n't want to get in a who started it first fight , that 's just stupid . 
  yeah it was opposed by both non-muslims and muslims . 
  non-muslims opposed because they feared that they would lose their privileges and muslims opposed because it was a secular movement . 
  it kinda revived during the second constitutional era but died again after balkan wars . 
  stop with your whataboutism . 
  genghis khan is the least turkic one out of the attila , genghis , timur trio . 
  the `` anatolian idea '' you are describing did exist as ottomanism in the late ottoman period where everybody who live in the ottoman empire would be called ottoman citizen but nationalist movement of minorities pretty much sealed that idea 's fate . 
  like i said , they were really a bunch of nice folks so i do n't have any evidence to give you . 
  do you think there would n't be a turkish republic if there were still armenians in the east and greeks in the west ? 
  specific instance ? 
  i 'm pretty sure millions of muslims just peacefully escorted with flowers from balkans and russia . 
  so no , no such thing like the definition of the genocide happened . 
  edit : i love how everbody is like evil turks deny genocide then say things like remove kebab , they were the opressers and asks for instances . 
  are you saying the attacker sanel m. , senal jugo who was born in southern serbia and holds a yugoslavian citizenship is turkish ? 
  dead to almost everybody but politicians . 
  a dude ca n't have fun with another dude while they are oily ? 
  just look at these guys : [ bros 1 ] ( http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/enhanced/webdr01/2013/3/5/10/enhanced-buzz-wide-16451-1362498393-12.jpg ) [ bros 2 ] ( http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9tsaeqncz1rqi1epo1_500.jpg ), 
  ankara government was n't fighting against cup because they did n't really exist at that time . 
  edit : okay , why am i downvoted ? 
  at least give a reason . 
  but our shit smells better than yours . 
  it is the only thing they can grab since they are oily . 
  that 's how you win . 
  sorry to upset you mate but we might replace that with a dinosaur one . 
  http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/gundem/28731002.asp ( could n't find an english source , sorry . ), 
  we call them `` t\u00fcrki '' not `` turks '' . 
  are you seriously believing that all turks did was kill other races ? 
  you should have just said armeians/greeks and not include christians . 
  it looks pretty funny right now .
