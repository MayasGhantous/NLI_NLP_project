  thanks !, 
  but i do n't think there is an exclusive problem between turkey-poland but if you mean turkey-eu yeah , i also hope things get better or at least not worse . 
  it 's a vlog , here it 's so popular to record a vlog . 
  advertisements of turkey looks like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a1q7v4btbk ) or [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z4e0mhb6zi ) . 
  they speak turkish . 
  there are many hypothesis about [ how turkish sounds to foreigners ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxfkkxws6ie ) . 
  the blonde girl is half-russian half-turkish , the other one is turkish . 
  oh please !, 
   have nice evening !, 
  the blonde girl is polina who is half-russian half-turkish , the other one , i do n't know her name but looks turkish . 
  allah ( the magnificent ) gave both aicha and fatima sisters equally beautiful souls but we do n't live in the after world where souls appear so physical appearance matters . 
  aicha is the one when allah made art , fatima is work of allah 's freetime scribble . 
   middle east , asia , and the islamic world yeah , you are right . 
  i told you we just fake to be european to get more investments . 
  here is a [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izfyzbxtuhm ) of my cousin aicha and her iraqi friend fatima visiting famous mosques in turkey . 
  i confess , i did it on purpose . 
  japanese ca n't into european humor / s, 
  everyone knows that fact here . 
  in fact turkey included as europe in many more maps . 
  it 's a secret project to make europeans familiar with the idea of turkey in eu . 
  but hey do n't tell anyone !, 
  you are right . 
  the title is totally wrong . 
  look at number 19 on the list .

   ... a little too much ... rip english xd thanks for honesty . 
  you are not alone here . 
  actually majority of people here think turkey has no business in europe . 
  there is / r/europemeta for discussion about / r/europe . 
  you can search ` turkey ' there to read about debates over turkey 's inclusion to this subreddit . 
  hey !, 
  it seems like you are new around here . 
  turks and greeks get along way better actually in / r/europe than youtube  i hope you 'll join us .

  [ happy birthday armenia !, 
   wikipedia : superpower is a word used to describe a state with a dominant position in international relations and which is characterised by its unparalleled ability to exert influence or project power on a ** global scale ** . 
  this is done through the combined means of ** technological ** , cultural , military and economic strength , as well as diplomatic and ** soft power ** influence . 
  * global scale : no . 
  look at [ us fleets ' area of responsibility ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/usn_fleets_%282009%29.png ) * technological : big no . 
  mostly crappy products copied by other countries . 
  i even did better soldering on my pc than their manufacturers . 
  i previously had zero experience on soldering . 
  * soft power : absolutely no . 
  let 's forget about catching us , europe . 
  china ca n't even catch south korea for soft power . 
  it 's a shitty country why would anyone watch a tv series about life of chinese ? 
  i bet they used ` windows paint ' for designing this . 
  [ ultra advanced russian technology ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipmjbm4mt5i ), 
  20 % percent but usa is like octopus . 
  usa influences its allies . 
  the more they support usa in foreign policy , ( un votes etc. ), 
  the more they get aid . 
  it 's not my dream scenario as well , but these are the facts . 
  yes , a bit less than half gdp ** per capita ** . 
  but usa has more than 2 times population so that makes 5x more gdp . 
  about soft power , italy probably has far more soft power than russia in global perspective . 
  so yeah russia is * finito *, 
  allright !, 
  2016 ppp gdp ( millions of us$ ) * usa : 18,558,130 * russia : 3,684,643 18,558,130 / 3,684,643 = ** 5.036 ** note that usa has far more superior technology and we have n't spoken about the soft power yet . 
  also usa , china , france , uk , pakistan , india , north korea etc. 
  have nuclear weapons ~ ~ too ~ ~ . 
  but some of these countries ca n't provide sewage huge part of its citizens . 
  so nuclear power is n't single requirement when it comes to being superpower . 
  in fact usa is the single superpower in the world for now , however there are some superpower candidates for 50-100 years later like china , india . 
  but russia definetely is n't one of them . 
  2016 nominal gdp ( millions of us$ ) * usa : 18,558,130 * russia : 1,132,740 russia can be only regional power with this economy . 
  the earlier russians wake up and join the west , the better for them .

  stay in your boring island which made up grass on the ground and gray wheather above xd let us enjoy beauty of continental [ ** europe ** ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xevqh1x2j7a&amp;t=0m45s ), 
  i said turkey is partly european what is delusional about that ? 
  last time i checked istanbul was one of the most important city and biggest city in europe . 
  also i said turks will continue to influence europe . 
  however this is n't based on your will . 
  you will ** have to ** get influenced more and more every other day by turks . 
  so do n't try to escape it , just take a deep breath and embrace the reality . 
  turkey is partly european and you 'd better get used to it . 
  because you will continue to hear about turkey/turks more often . 
   i can genuinely see most turkish users here just saying `` screw it '' and leaving . 
  why ?
