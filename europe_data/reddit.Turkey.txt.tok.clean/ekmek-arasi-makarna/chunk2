  we love conflicts . 
  if anything threads like this summons more turks to / r/europe . 
  armenian highlands , kurdistan, 
  successor does n't mean they have to share the same ideology . 
  it 's exact opposite . 
  there is a successor and predecessor because basically they represent something different in nature and they clash with eachother or with a third party so one loses , one wins . 
  * political : actually i think it 's the main reason that turkey is included in / r/europe because turkey is an official candidate of eu . 
  although turkey 's eu membership is highly unlikely for foreseeable future , it forces people to think turkey seperately from its southeastern neighbours like syria , iran , iraq and even let some people think turkey is part of europe . 
  * military : turkey has been nato member since 1952 and turkey is actually one of strongest countries in the world with its military and [ defence industry ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51t5mo1b-yg ) . 
  * geographically : turkey 's 3 % is europe however the population of european part is over 10 million which is higher than many european countries . 
  also i want to remind you that cyprus has 0 % land in [ europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europe ) * historically : constantinople has been capital of eastern roman empire for many centuries . 
  [ anatolia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/anatolielimits.jpg ) was basically estern greece for centuries . 
  by adding historical viewpoint if you mean turks conquered and settled these lands , so these lands lost europeanness you also should n't consider balkan countries as europe because historically turks also had [ these lands ] ( http://www.emersonkent.com/images/ottoman_empire_europe_1792.jpg ) to sum up , turkey is ** partly ** european and has been very relevant to europe for centuries . 
  hello !, 
  i 'm the maker of the map , also turkish . 
  i included turkey , georgia , azerbaijan , armenia because basically all these countries are part of / r/europe . 
  moreover turkey is included in eurostat maps . 
  so that people have an opinion about turkey , turks for eu accession , investment , tourism etc. 
  but you probably already have an opinion and assuming it 's very negative . 
  so you can simply ignore turkey on these maps or you can ask moderators to remove turkey from this subreddit . 
   as an average , the international civil aviation organization ( icao ) defines an international standard atmosphere ( isa ) with a temperature lapse rate of 6.49 k/km you are right . 
  i was told that -5 \u00ba / km in elementary school but i wanted to check it and saw -9.8 \u00ba / km somewhere . 
  obviously it was wrong . 
  here is my theory average altitude : * of belgium : 181 m * of netherlands : 30m 181-30 = ~ 150m lapse rate 9.8 c/km 9.8 * 0.150 = ~ 1.5 so belgium would be ~ 1.5 c higher than now if same altitude with netherlands . 
  asian part of russia does n't have any exclusive status . 
  so statistics also included for that part too . 
  however greenland has autonomous status so i guess it 's the reason for that . 
  ~ ~ that 's iceland , greenland does n't exist in the map lmao ~ ~ oh i got what you mean , greenland is an autonomous country within the danish realm . 
  that 's why . 
  well , you are partly right : [ thessaloniki - istanbul high speed rail project ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4ucnw7/first_step_taken_for_thessalonikigr_istanbultr/ ), 
  it 's actually part of a secret project aimed to make greek products disreputable but you found out . s btw we are lucky to live in our region from culinary perspective . 
  check this for god 's sake [ ny times : what kids eat around the world for breakfast ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/10/08/magazine/eaters-all-over.html ), 
  this ~ ~ man ~ ~ pig might fit to / r/eurabia but definetely not a / r/europe material . 
  so far , nobody denied how many succesful individuals exist in jewish society , especially ` ashkenazim ' . 
  however thinking this society as whole as a blood-thirsty well planned organization which rules the world is pure ignorance or jealousy . 
  they probably have sympathy over others jews and some of them may even dedicate themselves for israel even though they live in us & europe . 
  but i bet most of succesful jews just live an apolitical life in their countries . 
  also jews are succesful because most of them actually deserved it . 
  as soon as they try to be mean to ~ ~ their ~ ~ society , they would degraded by the majority of society and even by other jews . 
  let turkey in eu pls  we can [ counter domination of germany ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crpm1wlguxy ), 
  depends on emotional mode . 
  if we are : * happy something like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4n-wwh0j6g ) * neutral & sad [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbw0hqmesg0 ) and [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvgffa9g3c ) shows both sad and happy people on tables . 
  i wish i could understand german . 
  [ well ... here is common ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhodtsgpzko ) . 
  the road is definetely an earth road plus wet though . 
  driving with 80 km/h instead of 50 km/h means 2.56 x more energy so i ca n't venture to crash a tree by slipping on wet earth and crash wildlings which may come from anywhere . 
  waste of money !, 
  i would n't drive on that road more than 50 km/h . 
  actually , i do n't know the origion of the word . 
  i just decleared meaning in turkish . 
  it might be slavic origin as well . 
  you know your taste , 
  that looks exactly like my yesterday breakfast lol b\u00f6rek is really a thing in balkan , however i did n't know that yogurt drink is popular since i made my athenian friend drink her first yogurt drink . 
  considering slovenia is quite progressive country , you are not balkan at all . 
  there are more things that can be definition of balkan like foods but i kept my silence to not spark another world war here . 
  no , we just want to bring some tolerance xd my dear komshi the ellinika or komshi the bulgarski ... 
  yeah , ` come ' or ` let 's ... ' in turkish, 
  too easy to define balkans ... just ask the people what ` ayde ' , ` hajde ' or ` haydi ' means . 
  if they do n't know , they are not balkan . 
  bravo portugal for your honesty !, 
  seriously , this happened after couple of days scotland allowed policewomen to wear headscarf . 
  what a time to live in ... 
  eu needs some space for turenter . 
  i really love greece , bulgaria from the ones you mentioned . 
  add there croatia , serbia and macedonia , the best of best countries ... turkey is n't big enough to be considered independently on people 's mind and neither isolated like japan . 
  people will always put you somewhere . 
  why should we be thankful ? 
  most of foreign people evaluate things superficially . 
  turkey is same turkey , but when it 's considered europe , you are with best countries in the world . 
  when turkey is considered middle east , you are with islamist shitholes . 
  that matters all aspect of foreign relation including your personal travels , international trade , diplomacy , visa policy etc. 
  armenia , azerbaijan and georgia should be thankful too . 
  i agree with you , they will find a new one for humiliation like k\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu who is married and had children from his cousin . 
  no matter who we choose as a leader , he/she wo n't be normal . 
  because we are n't normal . 
   they were drived out as we say in turkish ` those good people are gone with riding those beautiful horses , we are left to bronze of metal , bastard of human ', 
  well , most of europeans do n't consider turkey as europe and they have very good arguments about it . 
  so we should be thankful that we have a place at / r/europe . 
  but i do n't understand the hypocrisy about turkey either . 
  the negative news about turkey top front page everyday but positive news get massive downvotes . 
  i guess it is related to anti-erdogan sentiment however erdo\u011fan gets the most votes from undeveloped areas . 
  so the poorer turkey , the more erdo\u011fan ... 
  i searched dictionary for ` propulse ' , guessing from ` propulsion ' . 
  english language surprises me everyday . 
  as far as i know , both secular people and islamists migrate here . 
  educated people come here for giving a last chance to turkey before trying to move europe & north america . 
  people from rural areas come with hopes to find a job . 
  * 2011 elections : 43.8 % chp ( secular ) + 36.8 % akp + 11.2 % mhp ( nationalists ) + 4.66 % independents ( mostly kurdish votes ) * 2015 2nd elections : 46.8 % chp + 31 % akp + 11.4 mhp + 8.6 % hdp ( pro-kurdish party ), 
  well , you have many comments on / r/urbanplanning , so your words are valuable , although i have no idea about regions of istanbul . 
  i submitted [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4ypfav/worlds_biggest_airport_under_construction_in/ ) two days ago . 
  it was on front page for a while . 
  results are beyond horrible for turkey . 
  izmir is the most liberal city of turkey . 
  so it 's normal . 
  it 's growing this fast ** despite government **, 
  i do n't know about other cities , but there is a massive construction in izmir especially skycapers in [ this area ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xunm9l_mlpy ) also the city got some great investments like manufacturing parts of pratt whitney jet engine which ~ ~ repels ~ ~ propels f-35 . 
  * ** domestic demand : ** istanbul makes up % 20 of turkey 's population . 
  moreover there is a huge development difference between regions of turkey so istanbul is the most developed city and [ marmara ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/latrans-turkey_location_marmara_region.svg/2000px-latrans-turkey_location_marmara_region.svg.png ) is the most developed region . 
  thus istanbul alone creates approximately 40 % of total gdp and marmara region probably creates 60 % of total gdp . 
  people from marmara region prefer istanbul even for domestic flights .
