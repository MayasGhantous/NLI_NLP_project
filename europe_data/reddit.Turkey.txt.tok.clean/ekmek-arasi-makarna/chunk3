  moreover istanbul has been carrying international characteristics while other developed cities like izmir , ankara lacks . 
  for these reasons , istanbul totally dominates the international flights of 78 million population . 
  * ** foreign tourist demand : ** istanbul had 11.27 million foreign visitors in 2014 . 
  although recent terror attacks decreased this number , on a long term , as long as istanbul has [ the bosphorus ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xevqh1x2j7a ) , this number is going to rise . 
  also turkey had total 39 million foreign visitors in 2014 . 
  i think many of them used istanbul as a transaction becuase of possible price advantages , instant flights etc. 
  * ** the demand created by turkish airlines : ** the airlines flies to more countries than any other with 115 countries . 
  it carried 60 million passangers in 2015 and there is a massive advertisement ongoing all over the world especially with sponsorship on major sports tournaments like super bowl , euro2016 , euroleague basketball . 
  youtube and tv ads . 
  turkish airlines is going to use istanbul new airport as one of its base . 
  so no matter how it looks odd , assume an american wants to visit greece . 
  if ticket price is low , he/she will will fly to istanbul first then greece . 
  and there are also some geographical reasons for that and cultural , economical networks between turkey and countries in europe , middle east and central asia so there is/will be big demand but i ca n't explain right now because of no time sorry . 
  there will be subway lines to city and high speed rail [ to greece ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4ucnw7/first_step_taken_for_thessalonikigr_istanbultr/ ) and [ existing high speed rail ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/rail_transport_map_of_turkey.png ) on asian side of istanbul via [ 3rd bosphorus bridge ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e3o0qhlaie ) . 
  the highway connnections are under construction now . 
  loool, 
  if you want to create an aviation hub on a desert , you probably need hundreds of billions dollars to build . 
  not just for airport but building the whole city . 
  because no one would fly there if tourism & economic activity does n't exist . 
  however turkey is an industrialised country with 78 million population . 
  i mean there is already enough demand to for base of aviation hub . 
  also there are already tens of millions people who just use istanbul for transaction . 
  you 'd know it if you were from countries close to turkey . 
  but istanbul ataturk airport is n't a modern airport which has a huge capacity and security problems . 
  so this airport is really needed . 
   government decided to spend all the taxes there undeveloped areas always used more tax money than they gave . 
  it 's a constant fact . 
  there are two main reasons for giving so few tax : * traditional farming society which produces so few contribution to economy * problems with collecting tax you are right . 
  50 years ago western turkey was undeveloped as south-eastern turkey ** now ** . 
  that 's what i am talking about . 
  there is a very shining light for western turkey which may even catch spain in 20 years . 
  however it 's really hard to say anything positive for rest of country . 
  of course they will develop too but no way catching w. turkey because of mentality differences basically and things i mentions before . 
  if you can find any science , technology , art , educated people etc. 
  it 's located in areas you mentioned . 
  so there are two options : you will either invest most of money to undeveloped areas to catch 21th century 50 years later or you will just think as businessman invest areas where people who are open to develop , exist . 
  undeveloped areas already spend higher money than the tax collected there . 
  but nothing is developing there without migration of educated people . 
  maybe they become more open minded someday and i 'd think ** visiting ** those undeveloped areas but i wont go for living . 
  nobody would go ... 
  turkey aims to be aviaton hub with using its geographical , cultural , economical privileges . 
  turkish airlines is already flies to more country than any other airline . 
  so considering istanbul population is growing rapidly , more turks are flying every year and assuming istanbul becomes more global . 
  there is already big demand . 
  however also passangers use istanbul for transaction . 
  so this new airport is needed . 
  6 runway will be constructed phase by phase if planned demand occurs . 
  the video explained phases with detail . 
  i took genres from wikipedia pages , since we use local terms in turkish . 
  it writes romantic drama . 
  i edited as it . 
  i listed my favorites from turkey : * a\u015fk-\u0131 memnu ( 2008-2010 ) - romantic drama - [ episode 1 with english subtitle ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqqsl1i2lpc ) * ezel ( 2009-2011 ) - crime drama - [ episode 1 with english subtitle ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrq0oftzkxc ) * magnificent century ( 2011-2014 ) - history of ottoman sultan suleiman - [ episode 1 with english subtitle ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qtutbin82w ) * magnificent century k\u00f6sem ( still running ) - history of ottoman queen - [ episode 1 with english subtitle ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ra3nfo_xevq ) * what is fatmag\u00fcl 's fault ? 
  ( 2010-2012 ) - drama - [ episode 1 with english subtitle ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwl-f9obzcs ), 
  some facts : * 76.5 million m ^ 2 area * 6 runways * 250 aircrafts , 18000 cars parking capacity * flights to 350 destination * servicing 150 million people a year, 
   drone capabilities if you mean domestic products : * private company product [ baykar ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xx3meco1qlw ) * halfly military owned company product [ anka-s ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=oorbsjpgu7y ), 
  bodrum is very popular here . 
  all the turkish celebs actually go there . 
  so great entertainment apart from sea . 
  i guess people who thinks holiday there watched to have an idea . 
  during 90s ukrainians and russians came for better living conditions , i even had two classmates called nasya and lada in elementary school . 
  they could only speak basic turkish . 
  so they were cheating during exams all the time . 
  once lada even wrote her last name as nasya 's lol however now their immigration to turkey is more like brits immigrating to spanish coast . 
  more like `` no better place to tan those russian bodies ** with this price ** than turkey '' i believe . 
  we want more russian immigrants , we want more [ polina !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izfyzbxtuhm ), 
  omg i was told that finland is boring but i did n't expect that much . 
  yes he was . 
  the purge imprisoning is for followers of islamist gulenists . 
  from secular point of view , i do n't have any objection for this . 
  but he should destroy other islamist sects which has power in state . 
  but he wo n't do it because he is islamist himself and they support him for now . 
  erdo\u011fan is n't going anywhere soon . 
  i agree with you . 
  so there is more danger that he will lead the country to total dictatorship . 
  that 's why i want to keep turkey-eu circus to continue until he 's gone . 
  i wish we would n't . 
  breaking turkey-eu relations would be suicide for current government since the turkish economy mainly based on trade with eu . 
  but if you mean turkey 's membership of eu , nobody wants us anyway with or without erdo\u011fan . 
  even turkey 's frozen eu bid creates massive anxiousness throughout eu . 
  so i believe it 's better drafting application but not now , not when erdogan is president . 
  good !, 
  we ca n't really deal with russian bear . 
  way too stronger than our scale ... 
   i 'm on my phone i guessed so lol . 
  i wish the latter statistics is true . 
  greece was hope for its poor neighbours you know . 
  stephanosmu , the infographic shows 19,000 ** next to ** ppp . 
  but i talk about the number next to ** gdp ** first you need to be able to see the numbers next to gdp for this discussion to go anywhere . 
  there are two numbers one under another on the infographic . 
  i talk about the numbers next to ** gdp ** . 
  could you see that part ? 
  the infographic includes ** two ** numbers there . 
  look properly !, 
  it writes 11000 next to ** gdp ** which refers to ` gross domestic product ( per capita ) ' and 19500 next to ** ppp ** which refers to ' gross domestic product ( per capita ) adjusted to purchasing power parity ' the link i sent belongs to 2015 . 
  now it might be 11000 for 2016 i do n't know . 
  ** the claim of this infographic ** definitions * gdp : gross domestic product ( per capita ) * ppp : gross domestic product ( per capita ) adjusted to purchasing power parity greece * gdp 29500 * ppp 26000 ** reality ** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( nominal ) _ per_capita * gdp per capita nominal : 18035 * gdp per capita purchasing power parity : 26449 there are two numbers there . 
  for turkey gdp nominal shown as 11000 and gdp ppp 19000 . 
  [ gdp per capita nominal of greece ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greece ) is $ 18,035 , not $ 29,500 ... 
  i decided to be a a little jerk today .
