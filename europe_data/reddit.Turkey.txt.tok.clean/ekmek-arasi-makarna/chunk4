  edit : i admit it was silly joke . 
  but it does n't mean that i am not sorry . 
  i was told skopje is a nice city to visit and macedonian people are warm . 
  so i hope their families can handle it . 
  peace !, 
  actually in theory i agree with you . 
  also today is quality is everything , i think . 
  but it 's a longterm philosophy . 
  otherwise it would n't work . 
  anyways have nice weekend , 
  c'mon do n't make me do a long research for my holiday sunday . 
  but we all know what germans could produce in that era and all the soviet crap ... stalin said ` quantity is quality ' . 
  but it was n't only for battles . 
  it is one of ideology of communism , i believe . 
  look at [ ** current ** building of sukhoi ] ( http://b-29s-over-korea.com/history-of-russian-sukhoi-fighter-aircraft/images/sukhoi-design-bureau.jpg ) and [ current building of boeing ] ( http://www.trbimg.com/img-53b4432e/turbine/chi-boeing-gets-28-billion-nasa-contract-20140-001/2048/2048x1365 ) . 
  even after all years russia still could n't improved itself properly ... 
  so stalin should have changed his mentality a decade ago to fight without drive people to death . 
  look at how soviet army won battles against hitler 's army . 
  when there is significant technological assymetry . 
  you have to come with more soldiers then enemy . 
  of course this rule would n't work for modern warfare . 
  but it worked for the past . 
  me too : , 
   ( i wish though ) no , knowing that you have a single life is more meaningful . 
  think of it like sleeping . 
  you get tired of day , you sleep . 
  you get tired of life ( sickness , senility ) you die . 
  once atat\u00fcrk said his soldiers ' i do not command you to fight , i command you to die ' . 
  this is how atat\u00fcrk later won turkish war of independence against all greece , armenia , france , united kingdom , italy and ** ottoman empire ** together . 
  edit : although atat\u00fcrk won battle of gallipoli , the war was lost as you know ... 
  i would n't fight under any commander but [ him ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0ca7pd1fmy&amp;t=45m44s ), 
   a bilingual `` greek turkish confederation '' ( east mediterranean confederation ) between greece , turkey and cyprus ( with national capitals in athens , ankara and nicosia , and confederation parliament in istanbul ) would ( to an extent ) be a reincarnation of the byzantine/ottoman empires great !, 
  also we should claim this union as 4th soul of roman empire . 
  1st was polytheist , 2nd was christian , 3rd was islamic ottoman and 4th will be secular grecoturkish union . 
  while this union will let you benefit from a big country with historic greek cities like constantinople and smyrna . 
  turks will develop a strong secularism and global perspective . 
  this trend may also end the conflicts around our region and promoting peace . 
  do n't try to prove your europeanness over others ' non-europeanness . 
  turkish or bulgarian whatever , you all are peasants from those mountains !, 
  you know balkan is a turkish word for defining an area in ottoman clays . 
  so since the kebab has n't reached ~ ~ slovakia ~ ~ slovenia properly , they 're not part of beautiful and backward balkan culture .

  actually i saw a bigger pattern : * turkey 63 * greece 63 * italy 65 * spain 68 * portugal 67, 
  glorious spanish empire has to deal with a tribe , how sad !, 
  good , but still be careful !, 
  good !, 
  now your identity is exposed :d, 
  are you efe ? 
  no way . 
  popularity of this meal ca n't even make top 250 in turkish cuisine so probably you ca n't find it . 
  * [ lor cheese ] ( http://www.akcaoglumandira.com/urun_res/lor-peynir1356950828.jpg ) * walnut ( i prefer [ bladed walnut ] ( http://st2.depositphotos.com/1005730/6695/i/450/depositphotos_66952017-crushed-kernel-walnuts-in-food-processor.jpg ) ) * hot turkish noodle ( eri\u015fte ) * molten slightly cooked butter it 's salty and little bit bitterness from walnut . 
  it 's called ` lorlu cevizli eri\u015fte ' and why ? 
  it taste good :d, 
  there are many different theories about [ how does it sound ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxfkkxws6ie ) lol, 
   maybe i 'm weird . 
  actually no . 
  it 's both widely liked by baklava eaters . 
  i just do n't like bitterness of walnut mix with desserts . 
  but , [ noodle with walnut ] ( http://www.kendimceyemek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/img_9329.jpg ) tastes great !, 
  there are many baklava recipes [ 1 ] ( https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/15530215/m%3d2048/a145de4c6f5738a4506c82a606890df5 ) [ 2 ] ( http://www.bibaklava.com/pictures/fsawxconhz6262016132753_cevizli-baklava-1.jpg ) [ 3 ] ( https://satsumaart.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dscn1113.jpg ) [ 4 ] ( https://yemektariflerikolay.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/perfectfoto3417.jpg ) ... 
  but you only picked the worst one lol, 
  the main problem with greece is your baklavas made with walnuts instead of pistachios . 
  otherwise i 'd come for sure .

  both european and asian part of turkey is very important beautiful lands . 
  not like your shithole and swampy lands . 
  hahaha you nooby . 
  cry !, 
   only a small part of it is . 
  many people has been whining for losing this small part to turks for 500 years . 
  i bet it 's pretty important part of europe . 
  do n't you think ? 
  well , turkey is clearly part of / r/europe . 
  you can check the map on the top-right . 
  so your question is out of context with my previous reply . 
  but let me try to answer it . 
  if you look as pure geographical perspective turkey has 3 % land on europe which has tekirda\u011f , edirne , k\u0131rklareli and european part of istanbul provinces . 
  totalling 10.5 million people which produces 38 % of turkey 's gdp . 
  however if you look as cultural perspective , i would say turkey is a third european , a third middle eastern and a third central asian . 
  if you look at political perspective , turkey is member of council of europe , european convention on human rights , nato , uefa and a candiate of eu . 
  there are more ways to define europe like excluding all lands where christianity is n't majority . 
  from this perpective turkey clearly is n't part of europe . 
   but it affects europe heavily . 
  you ca n't imagine how strongly usa affects europe in all aspects of life . 
  but news about directly to usa is n't included , since this subreddit exclusively focused on europe . 
  who cares ? 
  syria is n't part of / r/europe !, 
   for some reason cheap land , maybe ?
