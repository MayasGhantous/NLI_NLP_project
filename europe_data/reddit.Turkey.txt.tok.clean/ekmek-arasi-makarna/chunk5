  fun fact : stalin was georgian too . 
  i meant people of georgia though . 
  we all hope for same thing , thanks !, 
   nothing special at all i did n't claim these are special . 
  i claim these are n't low quality equimpments . 
  and i just did n't even mention yankee products . 
  yes . 
  i define culture of turkey as a third european , a third middle eastern , a third central asian . 
  but even that european part is similar with balkan area ( greece & bulgaria etc. ), 
  so there is huge difference between western europe and turkey . 
  somehow many journalists there fail to understand very basic things about turkey . 
  thus it 's normal for them to get confused . 
  well , i 'm sorry to hear that :( but turkey is probably quite different than you might expected . 
  turks and greeks imagine [ now ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pokndlwkleg/tedl0s06cbi/aaaaaaaabkg/5fifbfjf88o/s1600/bedmoney.jpg ), 
  i know that my views will contradict with my pro-western attitude but he is even too late to purge state adminstrations from islamist gulenists . 
  the real problem about erdogan is he permits other religious sects in the state and he may eventually use this massive purge method to legitimate opposition . 
  as a secular & agnostic person , i think any religious activity without ** formal association ** should be banned completely . 
  because the state do n't have control over it . 
  the people who belong to sect would do anything for their leaders . 
  so when these same people work for government , it causes a ` parallel state ' as we say . 
  nobody has voted for their leaders but somehow they have a power in the state . 
  you can think of this as medieval europe lol so erdogan , as a elected president has legitimatacy to some level although turkey can be considered as mixed regime of democracy & authoritarian . 
  currently four biggest groups in turkey that makes up 95 % of turkey ( pro-erdogans , seculars , nationalists , kurds ) are against the coup and support to purge to some level . 
  the western media is right to be worried as erdogan ca n't be predicted but this purge should n't be confused with regular media . 
  i mean europe discussing not letting foreign controlled mosques . 
  now think of turkey , some religious sects are so strong that they are in every part of the country . 
  we do n't have any choice but a massive purge against them . 
  but the time will show whether this purge will lead the legitimate opposition to jail and deposition . 
  he ca n't do much really . 
  it 's even legal drinking in public in 80 out of 81 provinces while it 's illegal in norway , poland etc. 
  i mean look at [ new generation ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awp7qwqdpza ) in turkey . 
  turkey has been in nato since 1952 . 
  so erdogan can be seen as temporary . 
  erdogan has the lowest votes from developed areas in cities & the country . 
  so kicking turkey out of nato will let turkey collapse more , in the end we 'll become a second iran . 
  i think it 's undesirable for both sides . 
  that 's also my point . 
  i agree that turkey has n't any special equimpment while some countries have nuclear weapons , aircraft carriers , but at the same time turkish army is among those ` bunch of countries ' that will separate itself from others both as quantity and quality with both domestic and yankee equimpments .

  georgia has lovely people too !, 
  usually beer is drunk with that giant glass , instead of water . 
   a consensus is forming in armenian society that corruption and the authoritarian regime are the main problems facing the country , and that they are destroying the economy and threatening armenia 's sovereignty . 
  2016 has been very dynamic from political perspective . 
  this might be advantage for opposition protesters . 
  oh i got what you mean 11 hours after . 
  better than never lol, 
  you grab easily , 
  well , [ it 's ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_83kzcorja ) not funny for me after hearing hundreds of times . 
  watch [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr0nt0grpz4 ) please !, 
  animals ... [ national animal ] ( https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8099/8529661271_7a33cff53e_b.jpg ) of turkey, 
  so why did you write ` istanbul experience by ** turkish airlines ** ' ? 
  so what lacks in the video that makes you think ` this is not an official advertisement ' ? 
  is n't that an advertisiment of private company ? 
  why did you post it here ? 
  considering both the score 67-65 and the last moment of the game . 
  also how referee consoled a player with a little hug . 
  i find it weird from perspective of a football fan . 
   send a few million guys over in thrace or wherever you want . 
  no way . 
  since population of greece is relatively small , the democraphics would change dramatically by ' a few million ' . 
  i proposed total 2.1 million greeks to turkey , so if we do a math calculation : 11 million ( greece population ) / 75 million ( turkey population ) = ~ 0.15 =  2.1 * 0.15 = 315k 315k turks should come to greece for similar democraphic effect . 
   i 'd give anything to just go and live there you should stay at least 30 days in istanbul to decide it . 
  it 's a very big city with world third busiest traffic . 
  quality of life enormously changes by different towns of istanbul . 
  so it requires good money to have a decent life . 
   since there are like zero greeks there now and some turks just hate greeks so i could be in danger well some people have to be pioneer . 
  the key method to survive in turkey is being in right place at right time . 
  if you apply this , you 'd get some slurs by ultranationalists but that 's all . 
  it would be better if greece sends * 1.5 million greeks to istanbul * 500k greeks to izmir * 100k greeks to pontus area so we 'd live together just like before ... 
  i liked the illustrations . 
  thank you !, 
  i was born in 90s so i dont really know . 
  i also would n't vote for those malakas . 
  i 'd vote for social democrats instead . 
  yeah there are a few communist parties . 
  the most active one is turkey communist party tkp . 
  same ideology i guess but i think they use this ideology gather people . 
  not real communists i think . 
  in a contries like turkey and other middle east . 
  people has very low level of ** individualism ** so basically they ca n't differ with french people and french government . 
  after innocent people died in france , a healty-mind person should n't even boo it even if turkey and france were enemies . 
  pkk is internationally recognized kurdish terrorist organization . 
  there is no notable proof that france supports pkk . 
  the west helps pyd though . 
  pyd is basically a spin-off of pkk which is active in syria . 
  turkey considers pyd as terrorist organization because pyd might carry terrorist attacks in turkey in the future . 
  while the west sees them a practial tool for fighting isis . 
  so the crowd tries to protest against it . 
  the crowd thinks that france supports pkk . 
  that 's why they did boo and said those words . 
  the martyrs are turkish soldiers who is killed by pkk . 
  that 's why they say afterwards ` our country wo n't be devided ' . 
  smoke less weed ... 
   another children 's song ... eia poppeia i do n't understand a word but i guess , today 's children do n't like these lol , look at that downvote, 
  it sounds so softer than casual swedish . 
  otherwise the child would be scared lol ( jk ), 
   eta : [ at least this one is more low key ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hwmylxdwda ) this one is impressive !, 
  no doubt that german is very beautiful language and jews are great musicians .
