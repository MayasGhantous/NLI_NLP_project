lol i never voted for erdogan but probably i will , crying more bitches . 
  i said same.all sides will face consequences . 
  who care ? 
  reality hurt you ? 
  okey mr rich , do not forget early booking to st tropez.i hope that you approve france governmet . 
   i wont be bringing my family there ever again . 
  we do not want poor tourists.they make dirty our sea.pls dont forget your promise . 
  cause eastern europe do not must to feed 14 million kurds ,3.5 million and 3 million refugees ... just check this . 
  $ 2500 in a year !,

  everyone got different parameters.i prefer chaotic city too.besides climate , cultural activities , nightlife etc. 
  do not get me wrong.my aim is not underestimating.i visited 13 countries in eu and i live in istanbul.according to my observation for a decent living , top 3 are madrid , roma , istanbul . 
   for a while sweden was the worst country in europe sweden ?? 
  which time ? 
   you are with best countries in the world slovenia , slovakia , romania , poland , latvia , lithuania , greece , cyprus and bulgaria.all of them are superpower in the world !!, 
   when turkey is considered middle east , you are with islamist shitholes why we must be a part of something ? 
  we can be just ` turkey ' and move on our way.building wall on southeast ( thanks trump ) and cut the diplomacy with islamist shitholes . 
   armenia , azerbaijan and georgia should be thankful too you can not decide for them . 
   because we are n't normal . 
  there is much to be written here but i do not want to personalize the discussion . 
   most of europeans do n't consider turkey as europe they are right . 
   so we should be thankful why ? 
  maybe you do but majority do not fucking care.also armenia , azerbaijan and georgia are in europe according to map . 
   but i do n't understand the hypocrisy about turkey who knew  i guess it is related to anti-erdogan sentiment firstly i never voted for erdogan.secondly anti-erdogan ' is cover to curse turks.take note , after erdogan falling they will find new ` devil ' for humiliation . 
  i hope that this tardy decision is preliminary.need to continue for racist peasants . 
  tardy call . 
  i hope so . 
  if poland or other ( little brothers ) got 2nd , 3rd , 4th fastest growing cities respectively , we will see least 500 post here.everyone will be ready to suck their balls . 
   people overstay their visas and become illegal yeah all the turks dream to overstay . . what is ration in turks for overstaying ? 
  we know that almost all immigrants are from southeast.and eu do not object kurdish migrations.they support kurds in all cases.why not ` visa-free ' for them ? 
   unemployment nice brain.what is mean ` visa-free ' for you ? 
  work ? 
  live ? 
  eu got more brainless shit than turkey . 
  waste of time , just meaningless daily eu-turkey new like other days . 
  3 million ? 
  i think that correct number is 3 billion ?? 
   all the world i said for all the world not 4-5 countries . 
  so you defend that in europe ` just uk ' have hate crimes.poland , serbia , romania etc are ok ? 
  hate crimes exist in all the world.usa , uk , russia ; turkey , china etc.but news present only events in turkey ... 
  okey , thank you for readjustment . 
  you found daily cursing news for turkey !, 
  i await knockings impatiently . 
  dead people can not come back . . 
  but it is reality.just check sources . 
  it is like a barn for us.but some people see like a ` bank ' to take your tourists money.hahaha, 
  answer is simple : galileo theory.btw we already know that who is ` cunt and bitch ' . 
  type of ignorance is flowing.they are not turks.yes they are turkish citizen . 
  but their race is kurd ( like turkish german ) http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/women-told-you-have-dishonoured-your-family-please-kill-yourself-1655373.html  most honour killings happen in the kurdish region http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkish-press-scanner.aspx?pageid=438&amp;n=turkish-press-scanner-2008-06-21  the crimes were mostly perpetrated by people with origins in eastern turkey . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/honor_killing read about turkey part and clarify . 
   turkey is the worst neighbor to have worst neighbor ?? 
  turkey ?? 
  try to look our side : iran , iraq , greece , syria , georgia and the best bulgaria . . best bulgaria . . best, 
  hahahaha . 
  lol , talked bulgaria . 
   they give north cyprus back , which will never ever happen . 
  good point , its just waste of time . 
  are you tired publish the same unnecessary news every day ? 
  we agree in here that this bullshit is done.but in there you always talk about this.just let 's bury this conversation depply and move on our ways . 
   there 's a critical difference between groups like pkk , eta or ira and daesh or al-qaeda . 
  i hope that one day you will meet ` puppey terrorists ' . 
  i hope you will.sides should be created . 
  we can see european hypocrisy again.of course you are not interesting your little bros massacre . 
  goddam rejecting is not relevant with racism.also racism card is useless because austria do not care what turkey saying.racism is relevant with behave to other people , not politics . 
  i just said that i support austrian politics.they will solve this problem.in turkey noone blames eu.cause main reason is that we have not common interest . 
  i believe in austrians racists to finish this bullshit negotiation.need for everyone to his own way . 
  all europeans still can not understand that they are ` immigrant ' . usually in turkey ( or other countries ) peasant peoples migrate for ` better life ' . an engineer , a teacher etc. 
  do not prefer.why they do if they are happy ? . they can not gain money here for their educated level and this people see europe as ` easy money ' . so they try opportunity in eu . 
  and dont forget that eu accepted ` turkish citizen ' with asylum.but they are not turk.it is a bit complicated . 
   used very often as a game instrument you can see like a game.what about your supported organizations ?
