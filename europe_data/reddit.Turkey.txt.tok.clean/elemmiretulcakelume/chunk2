  pasha means commander . 
  it is rare for surname.yes we have so many pashas in greek-turks history because of wars . 
  i can say that its true for turkey . 
  1-dauntless 2-rock 3-iron 4-eagle 5-steel 6-lion so cool and wild . 
  what is wrong with that ? 
  unnecessary new . 
  thye are in same page.ypg send to pkk guns , which sent you to ypg , and ypg militans origin are pkk . 
  cause they attacks to us.if someone support al-qaeda how you feel ? 
   i have a big news for you . 
  our politicians are not as reckless [ yeah very big news ] ( http://venturesafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/7776318654_marine-le-pen-lors-d-une-conference-de-presse.jpg ), 
  can we just finish this bullsit ? 
  its so boring to read these news and discussions 365/24 . 
  27 countries do not want us , not just austria.im not angry to all.my post based to my experience in austria just all . 
  i didnt say that austria should want.where did you deduce my sentence ? 
  it is obivious gulen.aim is same as [ iranian revolution ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iranian_revolution ) . 
  he want to be like [ humeyni ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ruhollah_khomeini ) . 
  we watched this movie before.just wait a while and we will see what is happen . 
  your ignorance is dazzling.i hope that one day you will try for this and we all will see consequences . 
  we all know gulens community and their ability since 1980 . noone have not doubt for this . 
   erdogan benefited greatly from this i agree with that.not all officers removed just gulenist.this community got 3 million members . . also their firstly aim is ` to infiltrate the state ', 
   it does not matter in the regard that erdogan benefits from it right now . 
  i agree with that.but it is obvious that who is made this . 
  do you restoring democracy with coup ?? 
  its getting more funny . 
  i live in turkey.i read newspapers and i know all the sides here.believe me gulen is so dangerous.he have very strong relationship with cia since 1980 . . 
  she born here not russia . 
  nothings gon na change.we are alone.after breakup it will continues.i do not think to join [ shanghai cooperation organisation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shanghai_cooperation_organisation ) or something like that . 
  believe me 30 % is high . . 
  lol , just try assholes.who the fuck are you to call this call ? 
  hope ? 
  when turks say you supported coup majority deny it.but all commends say different . 
   maybe nato should orchestrate a real coup in turkey . 
  classic ` europe superior morality , law and human rights ', 
  240 innocent people died , a lot of money , stability , economic power loss etc etc.erdo do not need to take power with this way.cause it cost so much.why all west denying possiblity of cia ? 
  gunlen 's buddy is cia not israel.btw we are okey with israel.why they need this ? 
  wrong info mate . 
  pkk/ypg and g\u00fclen . 
  majority is happy for these calls.people wants to try new movements . 
   turkey could be solved with kurdistan , thank you for your candor.main reason is this fucking ideas.you tell taht ` we are allied ' but you always try to stab in the back.so turks aim to protect yourself . . 
  mhp members are more soft than eu right parties.do not bullshit . 
  majority is ok.fucking usa support all our enemies.how can we are in same page ? 
   it 's basically the reichstag fire pff are you joking ? 
  according to this review if you interest others countries poitics you are should deport ? 
  what is wrong my post ? 
  for money-not for us.it is for fucking 3 million syrians to breakup-usa support pkk . how can this partnership ? 
  all the world sent guns into syria . 
  countries must be secular.but people can believe what they want . 
  membership does n't mean friendship.interests can be change . 
   you get money this money for 3 ` million refugess ' not us . 
   turkey is in nato , you are in customs union with eu and participate in eu accession talks . 
  on paper yes . 
   as much money what money ?? 
   breakup with the west are we together ? 
   erdogan fanboys feel that the eu is being very mean to turkey not just erdo fanboys , allmost all . 
  i agree for wage growth.but so many loss for citizens social right . 
  at least candor feels good.thanks . 
  so if you got power , you have right for fucking other people 's life ? 
  so mongols , roman empire , ottomon empire and nazis have right cause they had ` political and economical superpower ' . 
  no matter international law ? 
  just ` power ' ? 
  it 's hypocrisy . . 
   here 's the alternative : send the militaries of its member states to patrol its borders , then throw out anyone and west blame us being as ` cruel people turks ' ... 
  thanks god.that bullshit will finish soon . 
  cause eu = germany + france, 
  nice try . 
  good point . 
  even we will fullfill all the chapters also saving the world from alien occupation and saving mega meteors , its not gon na happen.all the leaders ( cameron , merkel , sarkozy , austuria pm etc ) and polls say it.its just fucking waste of time.we have more important issues . 
  nope , tonight im gon na kill 100 angel kurds with awp . 
  see you on news !, 
  absolutely right.doesn ' t belong in past , today and tomorrow . 
   sing the talks nonone care talks ( you , me , eu polticans and turks politicans )  he ca n't pretend he still wants no need acting , nobody want membership . 
  https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/08/03/turkey-less-popular-choice-join-eu-even-russia/ in turkey % 68 is oppsite membership . 
  it calls in turkey ` musakka ' . they got similarities . 
  wtf uk ? 
  same as istanbul.thanks isid and pkk ... 
  thank you for your precious opinion.i also wish to look at from the perspective of the turks.eveyrone have different perspective on own sides . 
  if you believe that all the events are about ` closing chapters of the acquis ' you are homespun citizen . 
  lol, 
  firstly we talked about cyprus not eastern turkey.dont change the subject when deadlock like other europeans.when i argue someone whatever issues after 2 minutes hearing armenian genocideee.its boring.have a nice day . 
  yeah yeah only problem is erdo\u011fan since 53 years . 
   i know that turkey ca n't deal with its own problems example for that ? 
  nato helped us with problems ? 
  we faced harm not benefits from nato . 
  even preshoting aircraft turkey is okey with russia more than eu.that event created crisis and it solved . 
  the fastest way please . 
  why we becoming part of russia ? 
  even we will be its better than hypocritical eu . 
  yeah all the matter is refugees not acquire a allince . 
  if you talk abaout ` hypocrisy ' what about nagorno-karabakh occup from armenia to azerbaijan?you always talk about cyprus and never talk nagorno-karabakh ? 
  are azerbaijanis alien ? 
  if you checked my posts i do not support membership like % 68 of turks.it does n't matter for us.have fun with your \u00fcber mensch society . 
   eu membership was a realistic proposition once we 're tired of doing the same thing so we just writing ` lol ' . 
  dont get me wrong.i dont understant that you are act like an idiot or you are real idiot.these two events are so distinct.eoka killed thousands of turks in cyprus then turkish army gone to protect local people.now armenian army to protect what in eastern turkey ? 
   candidate status is terminated so good news : austria pm asked to others memberfor finishing.others are ready to accept ahead . 
  accession talks are end.both sides said that everyone to his own way . 
   never mind the occupation of northern cyprus . 
  have you ever think that why turkish army is there ? 
  maybe [ bloody christmas ] ( http://images.google.de/imgres?imgurl=https%3a%2f%2f4.bp.blogspot.com%2f-5cp2dxom5zc%2fun9ygmoelzi%2faaaaaaaaavg%2fmgm55j05ive%2fs1600%2fkibris%252bg%252525c4%252525b0bbons1.png&amp;imgrefurl=https%3a%2f%2ftarihvearkeoloji.blogspot.com%2f2013%2f11%2fkibris-tarihi-history-of-cyprus-4.html&amp;h=334&amp;w=842&amp;tbnid=dt2ruqhsqtcw2m%3a&amp;docid=l1bne1go5zlkum&amp;ei=vjsov_sxg4ihuf3llya&amp;tbm=isch&amp;iact=rc&amp;uact=3&amp;dur=415&amp;page=2&amp;start=17&amp;ndsp=26&amp;ved=0ahukewj0q9akgbloahwiubqkhf3ybqqqmwhvkbkwgq&amp;bih=643&amp;biw=1366 ) edit : only -8 ??
