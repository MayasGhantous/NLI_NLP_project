  you can do better.but we never forget massacre in northern cyprus . 
  i hate that turkeys membership is using election promise.same as brexit . . it increasing decomposition and racizim . 
  just stfu brainless shit . 
  i never voted for erdogan.but noone is unfair all events.even erdogan may be right.just all the people need to be crossbench . 
  im sorry for my bad words . 
  i get angry instant to meaningless admonition . 
  i did n't say ` kurds are terrorist ' . if you checked my posted links you can see 2 years old boy cant be a member turkish state organisations ... 
   violence against kurds not kurds , just terrorist  human rights violations it is majority ( me too ) problems not just kurds  oppression just lol.being kurds are more advantage than being turks in turkey.they dont pay any tax or bills , using leakage current and taking grant-in-aid . i think kurds oppress turks.they are trouble for west turkey . 
   ethnic cleansing anothor bullshit.firstly check this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/halabja_chemical_attack and guess who saved kurds ? 
  or do you have any info for your claim ? 
  turkey doe n't support al-qaeda . probably you mean al-nusra . al nusra supported by west ( especially usa ) too.hostile to assad should be created . 
  when a turk criticizes to west result : -99999 karma when a eu member criticizes to turkey result :999999 karma edit : just -5 ?? 
  cmon you can do better . 
  turks are not opposite to help kurds.we are opposed to arming terrorists.cause we have border with syria and it affect us not you .

  what we did?migrant deal relevance not to eu membership. , yes our polticians wanted to join for election promise but all the world know that it is not gon na be . 
  maybe serbians are right.kosovo je srbije . 
  okey.may i ask why you unlike ` bro ' ? 
  any bad meaning ? 
  same point.we have different values therefore we are not same page.so no need to say ` adieu ' . 
   you wo n't be joining the eu has long as erdogan is in power anyway . 
  we are never join eu anyway.no loss . 
   turkey plays with the eu . 
   the political establishment in turkey is not willing to do all the reforms needed cause that will give control to it 's citizens  europe is not a closed club but it has rules . 
  follow them and you will be in sometimes i think that you act.just look graph and tell me how can it be ? . you need honesty not hypocrisy . 
  is it serious question ? 
  just read newspapers , sites , forums about erdogan . 
  how can erdogan prefer european leaders who is insulting erdogan 7/24 ? 
   adieu?how can we leave the place where we do not accepted ? 
   help , the kurds  waiting for the first triggered turk . 
  turks are not opposite to help kurds.we are opposed to arming terrorists.cause we have border with syria and it affect us not you .

  absolutely right.erdogan is cover.west spew hatred over erdogan to turks.you can downvote but you can not change . 
  i agree . . 
   kick out of nato , ban trading with eu , massive border controls , visa refusal to anyone who wants to come here with a turkish pass you passed holocoust 80 million . 
  turks live ok centuries without europe.no big deal . 
  what a brainless shit . 
  yes sir . 
   you almost got to join almost ? 
  really :d  give back northern cyprus , the greeks may throw you a blanket now you 're out in the cold . 
  oh it is more funny, 
   we should break out the big diplomatic guns just yet . 
  lol.nice threatening trying , but you are already doing this . 
  good shot.i do not understant purpose.who want for membership with what aim ? 
   cancelling the eu talks would send a strong message of displeasure oh sweet baby, 
  its so exhausting.reading the post is worse.just let it everyone to his own way . . 
  yeah it is better . 
  what are you ? 
  child or moron ? 
  just lol . 
  % 68 of turks dont support . 
  same as to usa . 
  and you try to learn morality to us.just lol, 
  % 100 agree . 
  it will be amazing for two sides . 
  amazing explanation !, 
  congratulations bro.g\u00fclen sect is like illumunati.he wants to be like ali hamaney in turkey . 
  i search these food in internet.no more commend cause greeks get me wrong . 
  if you check aegean sea you gon na see realy problem.some greeks island is far away to turkey 1-2 km . . so cant we fishing or etc in aegean ? 
  stop crying man . 
  gyros is fake greek food.its origin is d\u00f6ner . 
   technically at war are we in war ? 
  city datas gon na be more useful.our east border fuck our score . . 
   communist/anarchis i do not think that communist or anarchist could kill 30.000 people ( even babies ) and harm $ 550 billion ... 
   he and turkish are innocent - eu , us and everyone else are the enemies . 
  i have never seen positive commend about turks in reddit or west media.just see insult , humiliation , contempt , threatening , enjoy to turks problem etc. . just look on this topics comment about turks : i do not judge oneone.just no need for hypocrisy . 
  you already did since 1980 . 
  location and religion can not change.so both sides spends time anf energie for nothing since 1960 . 
  firstly ` dumd ' informs your iq and mindset.what is the point of humiliation to people ? 
  after that im absolutely agree with you for other parts.your politicians should talk this subjects and both sides should finish this theater.its just waste of time since 1960 . 
  nice brain.total populate 74.93 m and all turks are not muslim.ascertain correct , after you can write what you want.just dont bullshit . 
  how can you call someone ` muslim ' even no talking and no meeting ? 
  how can you understand that im nervous according to one question ? 
  any tricks ? 
  illumine us pls . 
   1999 : membership application is accepted 17 years.what is relationship gezi and negotiation ? 
  its just excuse . 
   possibility of turkey joining its always 0 . both sides spend their energie and time for nothing . 
   the eu are already on the path to grant major visa concessions even its never gon na happen.even in 2222 . dont worry . 
  why are you always trying to throw shit to turkey?all days , all comments?all subs ? 
  why you hate turks so much ? 
  1-do you think all fucking kurds are seculer ? 
  do you know altan tan ? , h\u00fcda-par ? , kurdistan islamic union ? , kurdistan islamic group ? , kurdistan islamic movement ? 
  2 - ` mhp is definitely not secular ' . definitely ? 
  how can you call this judgment ? 
  any source ? 
  3-i disslike akp and their voters but you can not say that all akp voters are islamist.it is can be true for majority not all . 
  4-dont forget % 50 kurds votes for erdo\u011fan .
