  after that , they 've been the target of much hate and harassment , some promptly fired from their positions , and now they are being investigated and detained . 
  i know , right ? 
  i 'm living and studying in norway now , and i fucking love it when someone in the academia tells me , someone from turkey , how islamic societies are . 
  the nausea sugarcoating gives me is unbelievable . 
  it blows my mind too . 
  and makes me laugh when i see things like this : http://edition.cnn.com/2014/10/14/opinion/muslim-convert-irpt/, 
  i 'm not here to comment on anything else but i just do n't understand why he made up a verse about referring to jews as dogs . 
  i mean , there are plenty of ridicilous verses in the quran , it 's not like he needs to make one up . 
  it only hurts his credibility . 
  this guy gets it . 
  i 'm not a muslim and reading the quran played a big part in that , but next time you are going to make shit up you can at least assume that there are people who could call you out . 
  it very much is . 
  well , all courtesy aside , the turkish and greek peoples have this special bond . 
  i think a good analogy for it would be a bilateral kidney transplant . 
  we exchanged peoples . 
  it was unnecessary , painful and left a huge scar on both sides , but it also shows how compatible we are - now athens has a nea-smirni ( new \u0130zmir ) in it , and many people in turkey remember greece . 
  my dad grew up with greek lullabies from his grandmother , as they were cretans . 
  historical imperialism , independence , nationalism - i 'm not here to debate those , but it was always a funny idea for me that people on the other side of my beautiful sea were `` enemies '' , that we were supposed to hate them , that they were trying to sabotage our lives .

   if thrace and istanbul seceded , then that would be european if my aunt had balls , she 'd be my uncle, 
  i 'm not writing an academic essay, 
  thank you !, 
  are you an omegle bot or something ? 
  the government tried to accuse pretty much everyone else in all the suicide attacks recently , from the far-left to kurdish nationalists and they always had to admit that it was isis in the end . 
  pkk which is trying to form an independent kurdish state has no reason to attack europeans . 
  you know who does ? 
  isis . 
  i do n't think that erdo\u011fan et al are going to do anything tangible . 
  i am not surprised . 
  both countries formed as fierce nation states , both had juntas calling the shots at times , both countries cold war pawns where any meaningful left opposition is crushed by gladio offshoots . 
  it 's easy to keep people distracted with an image of `` the baddies '', 
  you are not wrong . 
  however , the turkish state instilled this major victim complex in most citizens since time immemorial . 
  according to most government provided educational material , everyone wants a piece of turkey and everyone is constantly trying to destabilise the country . 
  turkey is a completely innocent country with no history of ethnic cleansing or anything , and everyone hates it for no reason at all . 
  now that everyone actually does hate turkey , they can ride that wave like pro surfers with weird moustaches . 
  they can also claim that everyone that 's not on the governments side is paid for by someone ( germany/iran/russia / the santa etc. ), 
  and they can get away with this . 
  they are covering this up because it 's `` their boys '' . 
  if it was the pkk or some leftist fraction , this shit would be all over the news . 
  ever hear of the iran-contra ? 
  if there is one thing on earth that 's good for business , that 's war . 
  it 's even better if you can trade with both sides of a conflict . 
  cliques in turkey are making millions on smuggling oil , people and weapons . 
  why do you think turkey 's been hosting , treating , training and arming all the * moderate * beheaders for years ? 
  why do you think , for example , hakan fidan ( head of turkish intel for the ones who do n't know ) was so willing , so willing that he was prepared to organise a false-flag by bombing our own people to create a casus belli against syria ? 
  turkey is plundering syria right now , looting it . 
  its people are working like slaves in turkey , for next to nothing , sometimes nothing , its oil smuggled , its heavy industry dismantled and marketed in turkey . 
  and on top of all this , people orchestrating it are banking millions upon millions . 
  by all means , isis is the best trading partner turkey has at the time . 
   reasoning made me chuckle, 
  * `` it was also disclosed that a ban on covering the attack was in effect '', 
  if it was the kurds the government would make sure that everybody knew that it was the kurds . 
  since they are banning coverage , my bet is on isis, 
  thank you for your very original and obviously well thought out contribution, 
  that 's not how autocracies work, 
  turkish government also just issued a ban on covering this issue on the media . 
  which is becoming kinda characteristic of them . 
  it was the middle eastern identity of the country that caused an explosion in its european heart . 
  turkey is a clusterfuck . 
  he 's the pope for fucks sake , not anita sarkeesian, 
  not wrong . 
  but americans supplied both sides with weapons during the iran-iraq war . 
  too bad you did n't remember what a bastard saddam was for the many years your government inflated his arsenal . 
  https://2new2.fjcdn.com/pictures/if+people+were+like+laptops+owlturdcom_591e33_5784439.png i disagree . 
   edit : will probably get banned for adding this , but i just learned about the cologne incident and about the mass censorship enacted on this subbredit ( at least they let the link after several tries ) . 
  so apparently even posting facts that do n't fit in the left get deleted . 
  but opinion pieces from extreme left sites are fine . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3b86ws/mods_of_reurope_stop_sweeping_islamist_violence/ i 'll just leave this here . 
  i wrote it 6 months ago . 
  i was called a neonazi despite being an immigrant myself , a brigadier and other labels aswell . 
  it got only worse in r/europe . 
  i thought the west was quite proficient at looking away when poland was the issue . 
  you learn something new every day . 
  care to share the sunflowers ? 
  i can do that shit all day, 
  try living there . 
  it 's the map from the latest general elections , so those numbers would n't be too hard to dig out, 
  yes , more or less . 
  http://i.sozcu.com.tr/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/02/secim-haritasi-371.jpg the red cities you see on the map are far less conservative than the yellow zone , which stands for the cities where the ruling party enjoys majority support . 
  the green ones are the predominantly kurdish cities . 
  shady islamist party came to power 13 years ago with insane popular support and they proceeded to get rid of most of the secular and european values in the country , which were few to begin with . 
  also kurds , leftists and other ethnic and political minorities are getting kicked in the balls repeatedly , but that 's nothing new, 
   100 kr for a hotdog and a beer would love to have that in norway, 
  i do n't think it will . 
  i think turkey 's gotten back to what it was all along . 
  but thanks for your best wishes . 
   only 100 people charged for insulting erdogan this year what a sad thing to say . 
  i know the feeling all too well . 
  during gezi in turkey , the government also claimed that we were paid for by germany . 
  we were also traitors and looters and communists . 
   bielefeld do not exist consppiracy look i know that you 're frustrated by the response and all but let 's not imply that bielefeld exists, 
  it looks like a place that would turn people into alcoholics . 
  the photography is top notch , though . 
  it 's as if they want the people to beat these nobs up . 
  well , the west could n't stop sucking erdo\u011fan 's dick about what a moderate , modern muslim leader he was while half the country was trying to tell everyone the truth . 
  i do n't think that it 's about not noticing . 
  sickening , but unsurprising . 
  the video description says : `` it was uncovered by german channels ndr and swr that isis markets yezidi women online and one of the sale offices is in gaziantep ( turkey ) '' fucks sake , i ca n't believe this . 
  this is a new low for turkey .
