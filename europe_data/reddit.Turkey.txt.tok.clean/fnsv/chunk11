  haha , i do n't know either . 
  i could n't care less about internet points , but i make these threads because i want people to know about things . 
  not enough to melt steel beams, 
  it 's funny how writing about this as a turk is seen as `` taking putin 's word over erdo\u011fan 's '' . 
  the turkish media * will not * cover this . 
  the two people who broke the story about turkish intelligence sending arms to syria 's jihadists are now in prison , if you have n't noticed . 
  the mainstream western media barely mentioned this briefing , as far as i 've seen - so what would you have me do ? 
  where else would you expect me to derive sources from ? 
  a political party that 's so rife with corruption yet so powerful that they covered up the entire december scandal ? 
  and yet you act as if i portrayed putin here as a champion of human rights . 
  that 's fucking bullshit . 
  and fyi , erdo\u011fan is n't a thread to world peace like putin is , only because turkey is not a nuclear power . 
  erdo\u011fan 's top advisor burhan kuzu just threatened europe today with `` opening the borders and unleashing the syrians on europe '' . 
  if you think that 's a sound administration , i 'm sorry for you . 
  i really do n't see why it 's so hard to take things on a case-by-case basis . 
  gay rights in russia has got nothing to do with the fact that we shot down their fighter which was bombing an oil smuggling operation to smithereens . 
  and yet you 're for some reason lecturing me about the world 's lgbti 's . 
  erdo\u011fan vowed that he 'd step down if anyone could document the relationship between turkey and isis . 
  it 's naive to think that the turkish state gives a fuck about turkmens at all . 
  when multitudes of turkmens in raqqa and aleppo were massacred by numerous isis and affiliate groups , turkey merely pulled out its only military presence in the area . 
  the `` turkmens '' in question , the ones who shot down the russian fighter , are in fact turkish citizens , trained and guided by turkey . 
  turkey is merely trying to play a proxy war up there with the big boys , that 's all . 
  there 's a thread on r/syriancivilwar about it : https://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/3u6im0/the_turkmen_commander_alparslan_%c3%a7elik_who_shot_at/, 
  they said that they will hold another briefing like this next week with more substantial evidence . 
   i disagree with you : so far russians have been bombing mostly territories which are not controlled by isis . 
  be that as it may , it is unfortunately still more than what any other nation can claim about what they 've done against the islamist terror threat in syria and iraq , that went as far as organising itself as a state . 
   i think that `` moderate '' rebels , who are fighting both assad and isis , by the way , had all rights to hit russian helicopter - russians had been bombing them before . 
  well this is turning into a question of chicken or the egg . 
  besides the fact that the only truly moderate faction fighting against assad are the kurds , the `` moderate '' islamists we are mentioning have been armed and trained by the nato and set loose against a government that 's been acknowledged as the legitimate representative of the syrian people until it was no longer in the best interests of europe 's pipeline situation . 
  this is not russia invading georgia , this is russia being drawn into a proxy war to protect their ally in the region . 
  so `` having all the rights '' sounds fishy to me , i 'm sorry . 
  sure , cold war habits do n't die out easily . 
  i do n't disagree with you . 
  however , russians are the only force in the region which is making a concrete contribution to fighting isis , and at this point in history i 'm more inclined to take their word over erdo\u011fan , qatar or saudi arabia . 
  the western `` anti-isis '' coalition is a joke , as it was the nato train and equip programmes that ended up in photos like this : http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/3.jpg or the fact that the `` moderate '' beheaders are launching american made rockets against russian sar helicopters after the plane was shot down by turkey : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vxxqotcn18 summary - russians are strongly incentivised to be on the right side of the fence on this issue, 
  gee , thanks . 
  you 're a bit fucking late though , european court of human rights . 
  they are showing thousands of oil tankers straight from refineries in syria and iraq - from isis controlled territories - to turkish ports and refineries . 
  whatever your opinions may be about russia , i do n't think they can change what we all know about erdo\u011fan - or satellite and aerial imagery , for that matter . 
  they held an half hour long televised meeting with the entire cadre of the ministry of defence just to show * some * evidence , while noting that they will do the same again next week . 
  if this is russia not doing anything , well , then i do n't know . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nma4b2znq2o here 's the ministry of defense briefing in english . 
  also i 'd like to thank the mods for making it very easy and accessible for people to publish zero-hour news about countries where english coverage is sub optimal . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nma4b2znq2o this is the russian ministry of defense briefing . 
  it shows three different routes from syria and iraq into turkey , from refinery to refinery . 
  keynotes : - erdo\u011fan and his family `` directly involved '' in isis oil trade - erdo\u011fan said he 'd resign if the oil connection between isis and turkey was proven , adding `` it did n't take place to his information '' . 
  so there is a chance that despite substantial evidence he can just claim that he did n't know - oil trade estimated to be 1.5 million usd per day - turkey imprisoned the journalists who documented that the turkish intelligence was sending arms to syria - russia plans to release more evidence in a similiar briefing next week since most of the sources i have right now are in russian and turkish , i used the link from al-arabiya . 
  i 'll keep updating this as it gains traction . 
  also , here 's an article on bilal erdo\u011fan , tayyip erdo\u011fan 's son , and his activities written in english, 
  that 's brilliant . 
   `` the turkish state '' is not a single person . 
  have you been living under a rock for the last couple years ? 
  forgive me for not being particularly sad about turkish police after 2013, 
  when i mentioned this on reddit before i was called a wanker and my sources `` right-wing with an axe to grind '', 
  some background : before the latest elections in turkey , the islamist prime minister davuto\u011flu said that `` if we lose power , the white cars would roam the streets again '' , at a rally in one of the eastern provinces of turkey . 
  the white cars he 's talking about are called `` toros '' . 
  they gained infamy in the 90 's where the secret service used them to `` disappear '' kurds . 
  tahir el\u00e7i said on the tv recently that while the kurdish independence movement used terror in its history , it could n't be called a terrorist movement entirely . 
  the turkish state wanted to imprison him for 7.5 years . 
  now he 's assassinated in broad daylight . 
  we are talking about the head of a bar association being shot in public while making a statement to the press . 
  what a fucking disgrace . 
  the first link i had available was by sputniknews who were remarkably quick to cover the assassination , but apparently they are deemed unreliable by this subreddit . 
  way to go , mods . 
  i have a feeling that this photo is about to become very symbolic . 
  this country is fucked . 
  that 's fucking brilliant actually, 
  i guess nobody mentioned that aksam is an islamist newspaper and everything they write is decided by erdo\u011fan 's cronies . 
  trust me mate , you would n't want it . 
  it 's a real shithole these days . 
  plus , how do you plan to deal with 20m people ? 
  `` aid convoy '' my ass . 
  this is the turkish concept of humanitarian aid : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfgwy51_wow hiding mortar shells under innocent looking drugs . 
  another ex muslim here , now living in europe . 
  could n't agree more . 
  cause nato is a hivemind that moves at the same time , right ? 
  `` my argument is not with you '' , said bourne , before he disappeared . 
   yeah . 
  no one 's saying no to that . 
  but you 're making it an ocean 's 11 plot . 
  you know what , i wo n't even argue . 
  nothing i said is overly complicated . 
  the only thing that 's very significant is the dangerous dedication . 
  i 'm not glorifying anyone . 
  i think admitting yourself that you are one hundred percent going to die at the end of the day might be a little harder than planning escape . 
  but that might just be me . 
  and i 'm glad that they did n't get into the football match . 
  glad that they fucked up . 
  just trying to say that this is not a bunch of 15 year olds doing a drive by with uzis . 
  they received training for this and it was plotted for a while . 
  that indicates to a much larger problem than a `` bunch of wankers shooting the place up '' . 
   shooting in a stressful situation ( with your death being imminent ) and still staying calm is n't exactly easy this . 
  one of the first reports after bataclan was that the shooters were `` very calm and composed and they reloaded 3 or 4 times '' . 
  obvious preparation went to this . 
  do just that and you 'll find yourself severely underprepared . 
  when you want to pull something off like this you 'd want to study your spots . 
  you know that the moment you pull the first trigger , the entire country will be after you . 
  so you have very limited time and need to execute what you want to do perfectly . 
  if you want to maximize your damage , you 'll want to go for the perfect timing - for example , knowing when the metro is the most crowded - . 
  for striking the stadium and the bataclan , you 'll want to know the entries , the exits , floor plans .
