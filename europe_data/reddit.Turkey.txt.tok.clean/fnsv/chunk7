  subtlety is n't his strong suit . 
  that 's bullshit . 
  there are greek islands a stone throw away from the turkish coast and they are not in turkish waters . 
  why are you trying to push this on an island that decided to remain british , un ? 
  judaism and the jews are very diffused as identities ( with obvious exceptions like beta israel ) . 
  they are not the same thing but there 's 6 million reasons why people tread very carefully around that topic today . 
  if a muslim man walked up to an african christian guy and told him to `` explain the crusades '' would you label that racial hatred ? 
  because there 's 1.5 billion muslims and 2 billion christians , there is no ethnicity to it . 
  calling an attack on a religion as widespread as islam or christianity a racially motivated one really does n't make any sense at all . 
   matthew doyle is being questioned on suspicion of inciting ** racial hatred ** after the purported encounter in croydon , south london . 
  ridicilous . 
  the guy is an idiot but islam is not a race , and that 's not a crime . 
  wroclaw is a really pretty place . 
  also the people aswell . 
  if you go there , hit up 2 pubs named literatka and kalambur . 
  the us leaving nato would be like the pope quitting catholicism . 
   3d printed his penis for his wife without telling her what the model for it was , and his daughter ended up using it that 's hilarious, 
   we need cash just so we can evade taxes seems a bit strange i 'll be very glad if you can point out where i talked about dodging taxes . 
  i talked ( read : ranted ) about taxation - then on a different paragraph i talked about the war against cash . 
  i mean , it was 3 short paragraphs anyway . 
  as per voting , i 'm just a foreign student here who plans to fuck off as soon as i have my diploma . 
  i think it 'd be hypocritical for me to use a turkish flag to identify myself if i had the right to vote in norway . 
  but this negative connotation in norway - is n't it funny ? 
  the fact that a lot of people , yourself included , connect physical , hard cash instantly with black market . 
  i find it tragicomical . 
   the royal family does nothing which is even worse . 
  then they are like complete leeches . 
  i mean a lot of people in norway are capable of cutting ribbons in norway and hosting foreign dignitaries but not all of them get a hundred castles out of the taxpayer 's dime , is n't it ? 
  hell if that 's their job definition plus keeping their heads down might aswell let miss norway do it . 
  back on the topic , physical money is the spine of any economy . 
  if you take it out there will be no easy recovery after the next 2008 . 
  just my 1.2 cents . 
  the rest were appropriately taxed . 
   ivory tower political elite say , like the monarchy ? 
  they have great pr , sure , but that 's exactly what they are . 
  i mean , i love norway . 
  it 's an insanely pretty country and it is home to an amazing people but that does n't mean everything in it makes sense . 
  the government simply has too many fingers in too many pies . 
  your salary gets taxed , the products get taxed and then when you try to import something that gets taxed aswell . 
  there 's even a chart on toll.no that explains how a 1000kr skirt bought online with 250kr shipping fee will cost you around 1800 by the time you can get your hands on it . 
  and this is considered normal . 
  they know how much money we have - why do they have that right in the first place ? 
  the war against cash is at such a level that if you want to put cash , as in , ** banknotes ** on your bank card , you ca n't do it at the bloody bank . 
  you can only do it at the post office now . 
  how does that make any sense to you ? 
  this over reliance on the government is bound to have ruinous effects on the long run . 
  like you said - it 's all very convenient . 
  which means that by the time it starts to falter it 's going to bring everything down with it . 
   inevitable that they will join remind me not to play poker with you if you are able to say that with a straight face . 
  turkey as a country does n't belong in the eu because turkey , as a country , is n't homogeneous . 
  there are european parts of it with european lifestyles and there are parts that look a lot more like iraq or syria . 
  shit getting stirred in the balkans is like people drawing dicks on a wall - it 's eternal . 
  i do n't see how anyone in the right mind could possibly support taking cash out of the equation . 
  it 's already happening in norway and i find it appalling . 
  the government needs to stay the fuck out of my personal life . 
  easy , just have a mattress made of cocaine . 
  you are just being sensitive for no reason at all . 
  which is like the essence of the new left . 
  it 's true , all of it . 
  thanks . 
  i 'm fucking tired of being sad . 
  it 's already being shed, 
  `` the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants . '', 
  it 's time . 
  it feels weird to type this because such an event never took place in a nato member country so far and i would n't want my country to be the one to set a precedent . 
  erdo\u011fan is trying to push for a saddam-style presidency where he is the ultimate leader of everything . 
  he is willing to sacrifice anyone and anything in this pursuit . 
  it 's his gambit . 
  at the same time , intense oppression is taking place . 
  you may have heard about the imprisoned ( now released ) chief editor of the cumhuriyet paper , can d\u00fcndar . 
  ever since he broke the story on covert turkish aid to jihadists , he 's been imprisoned and now targeted . 
  one of the first articles that dropped after the bombing yesterday was a blatant lie which claimed that the bomber was aided by the cumhuriyet paper . 
  despite the paper issuing denials it 's still circulating . 
  i 'm guessing that the government might try to take over the paper just like they did with zaman . 
  if erdo\u011fan does n't get what he wants he 'll make life even worse for everyone else . 
  however , apathy is immensely contagious in most constituents in turkey . 
  it will take starvation to get them to do something , and i believe that 's happening . 
  turkey 's economy is tanking , the lira lost swathes of its value and one of her largest trading partners in russia . 
  plus you add the weight of 3 million + refugees and things start looking rather bleak . 
  if the army is used against the civilian populace in a potential repetition of gezi that could lead to either a coup d'etat or defections from the army into a fsa-like organisation . 
  if it comes to that , the pkk has 35 years of experience in conducting terror and insurgency in turkey . 
  i 'd expect them to be one of the sides . 
  the others are the islamist/nationalists rallied behind erdo\u011fan and a potential fsa-like side . 
  erdo\u011fan has replaced pretty much everyone in the military but turkey is where the phrase `` deep state '' was coined . 
  you never know . 
  of course this is all speculation from someone who is sitting in front of a screen just like you are . 
  it might end up being unfortunately accurate or it might mean fuck all . 
  but i expect serious civil strife nonetheless . 
  yes . 
  not to the syrian extent perhaps but the country has never been so strongly polarised . 
  plus the kurds have picked up tremendous momentum . 
  cynicism is free but naivete is very costly . 
  `` the mosques are our barracks , the domes our helmets , the minarets our bayonets and the faithful our soldiers '' - this is a quote from him . 
  more than 20 years ago . 
  and a ban on coverage was issued almost instantly . 
  fucking human waste of a government . 
  the state does n't have gains to make from the crude trade - individuals embedded within the state do . 
  i 'd have to disagree . 
  the chasm between western news outlets and the train of thought riding the rails of western intelligence agencies/states is absolutely enormous . 
  i see it as an indicator when an article like this gets published on the washington post , however , that the chasm is narrowing and something is about to happen .
