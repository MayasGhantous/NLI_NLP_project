  you 're all right , nikopol_sk, 
  at least we treat our tea better . 
  checkmate , americans . 
  of course . 
  i never refuted the existence of any of the things you mentioned . 
  i talked about gladio because the turkish arm of the gladio was the schwerpunkt of all of this in turkey . 
  the cold war was fucked up . 
  under the guise of `` combatting communism '' it brought together everyone from lowly thugs to special forces . 
  in turkey , grey wolves became more or less it 's public arm , and it was used to accomplish the dirtiest goals to maintain plausible deniability . 
  greece , unsurprisingly , had a similiar pattern throughout the cold war . 
  you can read up on their branch of the gladio , and how it brings together units like the lok ( 1 taxkd-al ) and random nationalist fanatics off of the streets , just the way it did in turkey . 
  but again , my gripe was merely with the choice of words , not the choice of nationality . 
  i find that my threshold for ethnic insults is far higher compared to my threshold for misinformed opinions . 
  tl ; dr what the fuck did you just fucking say about me , you little k\u00fcrt ? 
  i 'll have you know i graduated top of my class in harp okulu , and i 've been involved in numerous secret raids on pkk , and i have over 300 confirmed kills . 
  i am trained in wolf warfare and i 'm the top sniper in the entire maroon berets . 
  you are nothing to me but just another hewal . 
  i will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this peninsula , mark my fucking words . 
  you think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the internet ? 
  think again , fucker . 
  as we speak i am contacting my secret network of spies across diyarbak\u0131r and your ip is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm , maggot . 
  the storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life . 
  you 're fucking dead , kid . 
  i can be anywhere , anytime , and i can grow weird moustaches in over 700 ways and that 's without trimming . 
  not only am i extensively trained in moustache warfare , but i have access to the entire arsenal of the paramilitary barbers and i will use it to its full extent to put the laughable excuse of facial hair you have to shame , you little shit . 
  if only you could have known what unholy retribution your little `` clever '' comment was about to bring down upon you , maybe you would have held your fucking tongue . 
  but you could n't , you did n't , and now you 're paying the price , you goddamn idiot . 
  i will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it . 
  you 're fucking dead , kiddo . 
  for reference : http://www.haberdokuz.com/wp-content/uploads/%c3%b6zel-harekat.jpg, 
  you are missing the point . 
  the debate was n't turkish history here - or anyone else 's history for that matter . 
  it was a matter of wording . 
  when you use a phrase like `` paramilitary tendency '' you have to be clueless about the meaning of paramilitary and tendency . 
  say , for example , `` suicidal tendency '' means that one is prone to ending his life . 
  when you say `` turkish paramilitary tendency '' it means turkish people have a particular inclination to carry out military objectives without official capacity . 
  it sounds ridicilous . 
  i mean , i 'm a translator - choice of words is my bread and butter . 
  that 's why it made me * mad * . 
  and if we 're gon na talk about grey wolves , i 'm game . 
  but you need to remember it was n't us who created gladio . 
  i framed it quite openly , actually . 
  paramilitancy is n't something you can apply to an adjective and it sounded silly . 
  then you start talking about it being a nationalist reaction and when i clarified that it was n't , you resort to sarcasm - for no obvious reason . 
  you have your own framing to do . 
  why not ? 
  i had to fight people because i openly talked about the armenian genocide back in turkey . 
  they sounded just as prejudiced as you are . 
  i do n't like people who try to use words they are not entirely certain about the meaning of . 
  occupational hazard , really . 
  do you even know what paramilitary means ? 
  were i to act like you now , should i start going to every thread remotely related to north america and talk like `` well you know the canadians and their inability to speak their own fucking language '' ? 
  i spent my childhood being exposed to second hand smoke , lived in a house that was heated by burning coal , lived in a polluted environment , been smoking myself for some years now and only after i read your post that i felt i was getting cancer . 
  if you give me your address , i 'd like to gift you a dictionary . 
  i mean , you could 've said `` nationalistic tendencies '' , `` history of violence '' , you could 've said `` one of those guys shot the fucking pope '' . 
  i 'd have been fine with that . 
  you only used the word `` paramilitary '' because it probably sounds cooler compared to the rest of your average political vocabulary . 
   frp would never , say promote teaching of creationism in public schools or oppose gay marriage of course not . 
  but that 's got more to due with the culture in place in norway rather than the groundbreaking ideals of frp , innit ? 
   frp is a populist party with lots of stupid local politicians who say stupid shit in the media sounds like gop all right . 
  and i 'm not overly concerned about how they are portrayed abroad - jeg bor og studerer i norge . 
  sure , nobody is aggressive like trump is , but i have found few norwegians to show actual emotion at all when they are not drunk . 
  i agree that they are not `` extreme right '' or anything , but the republicans are n't limited to trump , either . 
  never stick your dick in crazy . 
  oh man , you really do n't want to do that . 
  s\u00f6zc\u00fc is not being choked to death because that 's exactly what they are doing - slinging bullshit . 
  if they were doing any actual journalism , they 'd be sharing a prison cell with can d\u00fcndar . 
  in effect , all the critical press has already been silenced . 
  it does n't get much airtime in the west because domestic turkish politics did n't really affect continental europe until the refugee crisis ; but turkey is right up there with russia when it comes to authoritarian tendencies , corruption and nepotism . 
  the difference is that vladimir putin is a very well educated individiual with service in the kgb . 
  erdo\u011fan is a turkish gopnik . 
  you remind me of the msn bots back in the day, 
  that 's what the turkish mfa demanded . 
  aftenposten will not change its correspondent ( they should n't ) and they might move the me office to jordan . 
  i 'm so tired of identity politics . 
  are people allowed to call anything fat in sweden ? 
  no citizen of any country in the eu would work in the manner of someone at a factory in china or india or thailand . 
  that huge economic growth in the east came at the cost of 18th century style industrial slavery . 
  china is stagnating massively now that the people demand better conditions , as the middle class emerges . 
  if you want that kind of growth you will need to be ok with enslaving your own people and make them work 18 hours a day , 6 days a week . 
  or maybe you can just learn that a huge gdp with a huge disparity attached to it means nothing . 
  i had the same thing happen to me when i was living in turkey . 
  i thought you were better than this , europe . 
  brilliant argument there , well done, 
  welcome to the club , portugal . 
  model united nations, 
  terrorist organisation behind a terror attack ? 
  gee what a surprise . 
  the problem is that a sovereign , legitimate government is resorting to terror methods against its own citizens . 
  it 's a case of man bites dog . 
  more background : this year has seen some of the worst outbreaks of violence between the turkish military and pkk . 
  many cities in the south eastern part of the country have been turned to warzones and complete curfews were declared . 
  people are stuck in their homes without food , water or electricity and they can not claim their dead from the streets due to the curfew . 
  within the conflict , summary executions , `` collaterals '' and psychological warfare is becoming more common . 
  this behaviour is to be expected from pkk , which is a terrorist organisation , but a state should not put itself in a position where it could be compared to a terrorist organisation . 
  a unit believed to be working within the special operations groups in the south east called `` esedullah team '' - `` the lions of allah '' pretty much embodies what the turkish state has turned into . 
  here are some of the slogans written by the team : http://i.sozcu.com.tr/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/14/esedullah-tim-671.jpg `` allah is enough for everything . 
  you will witness the wrath of the turkish people '' http://www.bestanuce1.com/media/diha/620x366x680x365cc-dyb-14-10-15-sur3.jpg.pagespeed.ic.x1w5-6kdxv.jpg `` even if we bleed , the victory shall be islam 's . '', 
  and here are some other slogans written by special operations members : http://www.demokrathaber.net/images/haberler/2015/11/kilicdaroglu_ndan_silvan_tepkisi_devlet_duvara_yazi_yazmaz_h57330_f47b0.jpg `` the wolf ( a symbol for turkish ultranationalists ) has tasted the blood , be afraid '' http://www.demokrathaber.net/images/album/ctxwu7vweaacga9.jpg `` if you are turkish , then be proud . 
  if you are not , then do what you are told '' http://www.demokrathaber.net/images/album/capture.jpg `` you will see the power of the state '' http://www.demokrathaber.net/images/album/ctycesywcaaetzo.jpg `` the state is everywhere '' so the situation being this on the ground , as in , both sides fighting a war of terror , 1128 academics from turkey signed a petition , asking the state to end the violence .
