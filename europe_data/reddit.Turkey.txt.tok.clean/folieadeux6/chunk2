   really interested to understand why isis did this when they have had turkish support . 
  they did n't . 
  although the ones that did support them will keep doing so as the attacked were socialists . 
  the average islamist will still be behind them without a doubt , considering how they are disgusting enough to * celebrate * an incident [ where a hotel many alevi intellectuals stayed in for a conference was burned to the ground in 1993 by extreme islamists ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sivas_massacre ) . 
   are the victims turkish or kurdish they are citizens of turkey and that 's all that matters . 
  i just said i 'm fucking against it , this is a typical balkan youtube comments section argument and people are expectedly acting like idiots . 
  it just makes no sense to build an orthodox church for a 1000 people minority when one of the most sacred orthodox churches in the entire world barely has any audience , what is so hard to understand here ? 
   while i 'm against the idea of a turkish government funded mosque in romania learning to read is a great activity that should help you with many aspects of life . 
  the patriarch himself has no clue who will replace him after he passes away . 
  there is no need for another orthodox church , especially one that has n't functioned as one for 600 years , let alone one that is constantly swarmed by tourists . 
  hagia sophia is a great architectural achievement and an informal symbol of istanbul , there is absolutely no viable reason apart from byzantine and/or islamist fetishism for it to be anything but a museum . 
   but the turks do n't allow the romanian orthodox church to build a church in istanbul probably because there are a grand total of a thousand people of romanian descent in the entirety of turkey , most of them not even practicing their religion anymore . 
  we have the ecumenical patriarchate of constantinople which leads 300 million orthodox people all around the world , and they barely get enough people to do anything ( these are the exact words of the patriarch , who i got to meet a few years ago ) . 
  while i 'm against the idea of a turkish government funded mosque in romania ( even though there are 30000 turks in romania , with the number steadily increasing as there are lots of job opportunities ) , this is genuinely the dumbest argument i 've ever heard . 
  i do n't think any pedantry in the world can change how much of a cunt you are if this is your actual concern over a terrorist attack at least 27 young people died in . 
  unlike past isis attacks mainly targeted towards local civilians , this one was specifically targeting a conference by a socialist organization . 
  most of them were in their early 20s , just young , idealist kids . 
  they were [ collecting toys for the children of kobane ] ( https://twitter.com/aliyedirej/status/623084987475173376 ) . 
  for live news ( mostly in turkish ) , you can follow the hashtag #suructakatliamvar ( massacre in suruc ) on twitter as there are many live reporting what 's happening . 
  edit : decided to delete graphic footage out of respect for anybody that might know the people involved . 
  if you are that morbidly curious , the footage is available on twitter . 
  hey this was our slogan two years ago, 
  the last wave of immigrants ( the only one between thr 1922 population exchange with greece and now ) we 've had entering our country were turks living in bulgaria , because zhivkov told them to assimilate completely or leave and most left . 
  the number is n't really overstated as people with bulgarian heritage are a lot more likely to keep their `` dialect '' because they have n't been here for so long . 
  my high school in istanbul was across the road from the bulgarian embassy and there was always a queue in front of the door at 7 am -- most bulgarian turks have n't let go of their past yet at all . 
  + what ? 
  - i told you they do n't understand us, 
  well , at least we were ahead of europe in * something * . 
  you can get a 1-3 year sentence in jail for wearing a gas mask during a protest or simply covering your eyes though , i do n't think any european country is that advanced yet . 
  wishing luck to all spanish people that will be standing up against this infringement of their basic human rights . 
  czech your spheres before you wreck your spheres, 
  oh , that makes sense , thought lambdaistanbul was a reputable source since it 's the only lgbt community based in istanbul i know of . 
  were you there by the way ? 
  [ rainbows formed under water cannons fired today which was a cool touch ] ( https://twitter.com/lambda_istanbul/status/615240797655597056 ), 
  season 2 of the wire introduced me to kazantzidis ( [ see : one of the greatest scenes in tv history ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulux8efum-4 ) ) , i 've been listening to his works for quite a while but i just learned that he was born in turkey a few weeks ago . 
  he was born in alanya and left during the population exchange , which is why he could speak in fluent turkish . 
  latvian looks pretty normal apart from the dashes above letters when it 's like this , but there are random commas all over kristaps porzingis ' name and it looks really odd . 
  if you are aware of the existence of a man susceptible to actions such as `` driving into a chemical factory with a car and beheading a man while carrying an isis flag '' , just knowing probably is n't enough . 
  i 'm about as far as it gets from mhp on the political spectrum , but what they have done for turkish politics is the exact opposite of the wikipedia page ; they united the extreme nationalists ( grey wolves , alperens , many other groups ) , changed them into significantly less violent versions of themselves when in the 70s and the 80s they were practically the turkish equivalent of golden dawn . 
  while i completely disagree with their ideology , mhp is the reason why we do n't have an extremely violent far-right group terrorizing minorities on the streets today . 
  what a great movie . 
  well , you can thank zhivkov for that . 
  mhp is not the worst per se -- but it is depressing how they pretended to be the conservative solution for anti-akp right wing voters , but kept mumbling under their breath that they would be fine with an akp coalition . 
  even though they 're not the worst , they do represent the worst part of turkey - the deluded . 
  mhp voters like to think that they made a change , when it 's pretty obvious that they will happily bend over and accept the worst ministries of the government ( i 'm pretty certain that the environment minister will be from mhp , for instance ) in exchange for feeling superior for once . 
  their ideology is all over the place , they have the most passive leader between any largely supported party for the past 15 years , and somehow they keep getting votes . 
  akp are idiots , but at least they have an agenda . 
  that 's not me , thankfully . 
  it 's a lot easier to criticize the opposition than the government itself , so people just throw shit and hope it sticks . 
  it 's incredible how people find absurd reasoning for their malicious cynicism . 
  well yeah , i did so too . 
  istanbul/izmir is showing insane support for hdp which changed things . 
  the southeast votes are mainly uncounted , so hdp might go up to 12-13 percent . 
  even the most conservative sources are confirming hdp above 10 % . 
  chp is a bit lower than expected but let 's fucking go, 
  * when you have 85 % turnout , it kind of matters . 
  especially with the 10 % barrier , you 're really voting strategically . 
  ideological voting usually does n't matter , i agree with that . 
  it used to be appointed by the parliament in the past , but there is a separate election for it now . 
  the turkish `` president '' is a very odd entity that 's not really close to the general meaning of the word `` president '' . 
  erdogan 's greater ideal is to change that and become the next putin , but as it is the only legal task of his is to approve or veto the decisions of the parliament . 
  as i mentioned in the earlier post , he absolutely does n't give a shit about his supposed `` neutrality '' though , as davutoglu has the iq of a lamp and he is pretty much still doing all the speeches etc. 
  we have multiple channels broadcasting the elections , but i 'm guessing this guy ( [ fatih portakal ] ( http://gizemkaboglu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/fatih-portakal-secim-2014.jpg?w=625 ) ) is the closest to the schermman standard . 
  his last name is literally orange , so shout out to his dutch colleague . 
  there was blatant fraud in the latest elections , and it is pretty guaranteed that it will happen again . 
  a few years ago an organization called [ oy ve otesi - english article ] ( http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/oy-ve-otesi-aims-for-fair-election-results-and-beyond.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=82369&amp;newscatid=497 ) was formed to simply watch the votes as they are counted to eliminate any chance of election fraud , but the real thing is happening in the poorer eastern regions anyway . 
  this will be very , very superficial so do your best to follow . 
  ** akp : ** akp is akp . 
  islamists , but islam is really a tool they use to maintain a pseudo-authoritarian state with their voters genuinely believing in the most absurd conspiracy theories about how the entire western world is out to destroy the `` thriving , conservative turkish ideal '' . 
  ** chp : ** their new leader kilicdaroglu has really changed his party 's former ideology , which was borderline elitism that catered to about 20 percent of the population . 
  they are always `` good '' compared to others simply because of their more european values , but with kilicdaroglu they finally learned how to embrace the other 80 % of the nation as well . 
  think social democrats in france , really , but it 's a completely different country so their goals are a bit different . 
  ** mhp : ** turkish nationalists who might actually be the worst . 
  they usually come with the whole package , that is fanatic nationalism and fanatic islamism ; because if they were remotely rational in their nationalist beliefs they would vote for chp . 
  their leader is an extremely passive man who is secretly hinting towards a coalition with akp -- no idea why any rational person would vote for them . 
  ** hdp : ** their presence here is huge . 
  they come from a kurdish nationalist background , but they were initially formed separately from the former kurdish nationalists . 
  they are the only truly leftist party remotely close to being present in the parliament , they emphasize equality and tolerance . 
  while they will get their fixed 8-9 % from the kurdish people in the south east region , whether or not they make it past the 10 % barrier depends on the rest of the nation . 
  their leader is honestly the most charismatic/convincing man i 've seen in turkish politics , a former human rights lawyer and an activist . 
  i 'm voting for them , even though chp is slightly closer to my ideological views especially with their new leader , but with the absurdity of the 10 % barrier present you are obliged to vote strategically . 
  if hdp does n't make it above 10 % , akp is easily getting enough votes to form a government without a coalition . 
  if hdp does make it , and there 's a very decent chance that they do make it ( which is why we are all so excited ) , for the first time in 15 years we might have a non-akp government in the form of a chp-mhp or chp-hdp coalition . 
  in my opinion the former will screw things up since they cater exclusively to the 30 % , but the latter might be so revolutionary for turkish democracy . 
  plus , it 's proof that a majority muslim democracy can elect a secular government , which does n't happen a lot obviously . 
  why is this even possible ? 
  erdogan tried a pseudo-putin/medvedev switch , but the new leader of his party is a borderline retarded man . 
  he 's trying to save face by endorsing his own party ( which is directly illegal for the country 's president ) but nobody gives a shit . 
  again , these elections are huge . 
  edit : thanks , gold man, 
  we do have great voter turnout compared to most countries , and nothing is really mandatory -- turks love arguing about their politics and there is a strong voter culture . 
  no restrictions on freedom of speech in turkey , at all !, 
  [ also the world 's freest press !, 
  ] ( http://news.yahoo.com/turkey-worlds-freest-press-erdogan-claims-190329733.html ), 
  i 'm in love with gestapo if you immigrate i go loco non-whites are allowed no mo, 
  this would be around 2006 , before akp 's second term when they completely changed their policies towards creating a more conservative and authoritarian state . 
  even if erdogan gets trumped some day cyprus will never change its vote unless turkey gives up northern cyprus and france will never change its vote unless we acknowledge the armenian genocide -- both of which are practically never happening . 
  i honestly just want turkey to enter the schengen area because visa costs are a bitch , but the current voting system pretty much guarantees an eu without turkey anyway . 
  `` kitab\u0131n\u0131 sikeyim '' is a lot more common , meaning `` i fuck your book '' , book being the koran . 
  also this is an incredibly entertaining subject to discuss in english .
