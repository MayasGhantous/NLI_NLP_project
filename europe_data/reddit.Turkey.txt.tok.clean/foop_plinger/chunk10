  boy you have no idea, 
  good luck with that , birmingham has been taken already . 
   rule 1 . 
  bigotry of any kind ; including but not limited to racism , xenophobia or homophobia will not be tolerated . 
  denial or defense of genocidal actions is also unacceptable . 
  sorry , i ca n't be in a sub that literally oppresses their userbase with such fascistic rules . 
  good luck getting it off the ground tho . 
  / r/nato seems to be inactive , you should try requesting it . 
  that 's a bit of an overstatement , no ? 
  of ** america ** . 
  tell that to the azeris . 
  you seem jealous, 
  russia did bad thing  : c, 
  poor man 's illuminati, 
  our word for ass is g\u00f6t . 
  we 're even now . 
  our circle is fatter, 
  it will basically be the same or better . 
  anybody who thinks otherwise is a fool of the highest caliber . 
  [ best day of my life . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/sultanvahideddin.jpg ) they had a hell of a run though . 
  people literally worship prince philip , it 's pretty bizarre . 
  i 'm pretty sure he 's trolling . 
  or maybe psychosis . 
  slow down , i 'm just saying it 's not a catholic thing . 
  muslims do it too . 
  but alex is macedonian ... 
  this is false . 
  na bro , every old lady makes this stuff here too . 
  damn wikiers should do their damn job , damn it . 
  copy pasting is ruined for me,

  `` updated '' religions like [ nationalism ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/1887_bettanier_der_schwarze_fleck_anagoria.jpg ) are n't much better to be fair . 
  i do n't care , if they want to be macedonian they are macedonian . 
  they should still stop with the whole big a deal tho, 
  wait what , how can you blame us on this one ? 
  guess literally everything is ottomans ' fault since they were there at one point . 
  if anything it 's the crazy balkaners arguing/killing each other as they always do . 
  you mean counter-trolls or just trolls . 
  that 's ... not how genetics works . 
  this is not the neutralgreek i know , hopefully you 're growing out of it !, 
  ### this is wha happens when you allow polish people into the cuntry, 
  they 're like porn for nationalists . 
  they get off on it and it 's awkward to talk about irl . 
  it 's basically regular wrestling with oil so that it 's more difficult to grapple . 
  we should annex everything , fuck everyone else . 
  there . 
  these threads are fuckin stupid . 
  i approve this message . 
  all roads lead to sanskrit my friend, 
  the homosexual agenda is once again being perpetrated by queer frenchies . 
  stop oppressing christians and forcing your way of life on them . 
  how did he defend them ? 
  tell me more . 
  eh , it 's just one massive erection for everything related to rome but it 's for a reason i guess . 
  interesting that the same people who destroyed ( western ) rome basically started worshiping them a few decades later . 
  almost as if they went `` what have we done ? '', 
  obama is using science to raise an all-black army on the back of the moon . 
  that is actually why they call it the dark side . 
  what 's the deal with france ? 
  also there seems to be an error on crimea . 
  give me imgur or give me death, 
  problem is we want the land , not the people on it and people throw a fit when you work it out . 
  let him hate himself in peace man, 
  also known as ancapistan . 
  may the invisible hand of freedom bless them . 
  being homophobic is n't an extremist position , unfortunately it 's the norm in many countries . 
  get some relativism on you son, 
  we 've been in nato since the 50s tho, 
  / r/badlinguistics, 
  what ? 
  guess you 're not relevant enough . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/herero_and_namaqua_genocide  in 2004 the german government recognised and apologised for the events , but has ruled out financial compensation for the victims ' descendants . 
  i do n't see any outrage over this . 
  it 's the exact opposite of that actually . 
  why not push for republicanism instead of independence then ? 
  true , as in telling us to help/compensate the armenians yet laugh at it when it comes to their own genocides , etc. . 
  look at the colonialism denier . 
  this is how ridiculous you look . 
  no , nobody should compensate anyone . 
  that 's the point . 
  that 's what some say , some say we need to give them ridiculous amounts of money while westerners themselves rule out compensation for slaves and colonies . 
  or their own genocides, 
  `` hey that 's not very nice '' -  anger `` turkey should completely stay out of what we do in copenhagen '' -  `` we strongly disapprove of x that turkey does '' i hate this arrogant faux-moral superiority that westerners seem to have . 
  i 've been around since 2012 , it 's just that i keep forgetting my passwords and have to make new accounts . 
  i do n't even know the password of this account so i 'll have to make a new one after my browser forgets it . 
  yeah , varoufakis does n't negotiate . 
  he simply kicks ass . 
  wow , / r/europe being anti-greek again . 
  stop this anti-greek circlejerk . 
  now you will say `` greeks did this to themselves '' but no , bla bla bla, 
  racists/righties follow him around too , pretty insane .
