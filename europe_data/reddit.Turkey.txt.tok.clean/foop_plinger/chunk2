  you wrote so much yet said so little . 
  torture is not ok , period . 
  you are dodging the first statement , no ? 
  you do n't look smart & well informed by throwing out names . 
  it 's basically the `` shahada finger '' . 
  it 's supposed to symbolize monotheism . 
  [ u dum dum ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/little_rock_integration_protest.jpg ), 
  okay what x2, 
   i think kurdish fighters deserve honor as they are the only force who actively fights against is . 
  lol, 
  race mixing is communism, 
  what, 
  [ what the fuck am i reading ] ( http://i.imgur.com/91ola.gif ), 
  what are you saying ? 
   according to a 2012 poll , 72 % of the turks in germany believe that islam is the only true religion and 46 % wish that one day more muslims live in germany than christians . 
  this is not fundamentalism , it 's just different from how a westerner would take the question . 
  this is like asking `` would you like to have 1 billion $ someday ? '', 
  sure . 
  just because they see this as a positive thing does n't mean they 're out to get you . 
  also immigrants end up creating their isolated little subcultures anyway . 
  answer the question . 
  ccchhhhgggggg them guttural sounds are hard, 
  meh what 's the difference ? 
  you were the madman and pervert all along . 
  haha , nice try . 
  literally all of the descendants of the victims of various deliberate famines that devastated this region should be compensated . 
  at least recognize these genocides and do n't tip toe around them by going `` well ummm uh it 's the uh climate ??? '' . 
  it 's pathetic and below the otherwise proud nation of the united kingdom . 
  meh , as the ottomans it 's pretty much impossible to run out of manpower . 
  keep the conscripts comin, 
  i think they just look awkward right now . 
  if they were more common i 'd be all for em . 
  that 's the thing though . 
  there is no commemoration , no compensation , no apology . 
  nothing . 
  i disagree that we need a predetermined date to post such things by the way . 
  first time i 'm hearing that also . 
  plus heated topics like this rarely if ever create discussion . 
  it 's basically apologists vs the rest passive aggressively exchanging comments . 
  internet arguments never change opinions . 
  i like just throwing things like this out there to inform people that such a thing happened . 
  some go ballistic , some are intrigued and most do n't care but that 's better than nothing . 
  it 's thought to be is shenanigans . 
  now the right wingers will act like they never opposed this in the first place . 
  but anyways , congrats to yanks . 
   it 's like how my city seems quite socialist and more leftist as immigrant numbers increase , and then they vote 65 % akp in their homelands after voting for our inclusive socialists . 
  oh boy oh boy , tell me about it . 
   is there some sort of commemoration/anniversary at the moment ? 
  nope , most brits/people do not know about these or dismiss it . 
  there has never been * any * compensation or apology . 
   why is this posted here ? 
  why not ? 
  it 's the work of the colonial administration/colonialism . 
  a very very important part of europe . 
   why link to images ? 
  what 's the problem ? 
  surprise , you 're not an entitled to an answer . 
  i do n't get why contemporary brits ( or really anyone ) get personally offended when they hear about these horrible events in history . 
  this has nothing to do with them apart from them being able to demand their government compensate the victims . 
  we should n't have to clarify we have no beef with said people before posting these . 
  somebody 's offended their country 's ( literal ) skeletons are being brought out of the closet . 
  how am i an anglophobe ? 
  i just saw this link in / r/wtf and reposted because more people should know about these atrocities that were never avenged or compensated ( or even remembered ) . 
  i bet you flip your shit when you are called racist too . 
   fuck off , sort your country out your answer to a genocide is that stock `` do it yourself , idiot colonials '' answer ? 
  it really was pretty sinister : * steal land from locals * destroy their infrastructure * plant cash crops * make said locals work the land you stole * make them dependent on you because they ca n't feed themselves anymore * claim you 're helping them with your aid * make filthy amounts of money from exports * and finally claim they were subhuman all along so that your conscience does n't tap out also just opened up reddit to see every comment of mine in the thread except this has been downvoted lol ... leave my karma alone [ ; _  ( https://i.imgur.com/v3qpste.webm ), 
  not sure if this is a dig at the recent incident but i disagree . 
  megathreads usually stifle exposure . 
  so let me this straight first , you are going to start defending the colonial administration that scrapped the ancient agricultural system of the land and instead planted cash crops for export , yes ? 
  even when 5.5 million people were dying ( and nearly ** 60 million ** were `` distressed '' , whatever you make of it ) , they were still exporting almost all of the grain . 
  come on man , i get that you 're a proud brit or whatever but colonial apologia is really misplaced here . 
  you can encourage your government to compensate these victims instead of trying to cover their mistakes . 
  also got ta love how you 're going to go `` you got sources for that ??? 
  huh ??? '', 
  for every single word i post now . 
   anti-uk please . 
  let 's not remember this barbaric atrocity and instead focus on how anti-uk this is . 
  none of these people got any compensation for their suffering . 
  not even an apology . 
   the rationale behind the reduced wage , which was in keeping with a prevailing belief of the time , was that any excessive payment might create ` dependency ' ( or `` demoralization '' in contemporaneous usage ) among the famine-afflicted population .

  then why mention jews or slavery ? 
   and jews took a large involvement in the american slave trade . 
  source ? 
  more like omnicide . 
  you 're a couple decades late bro, 
  except you barred all non-white people from becoming citizens and afaik all a white dude had to do to become a citizen was show up and fill out a form . 
   we are gon na keep the death count lower than greek genocide we can fix that ( \u25d5 \u203f \u25d5 \u273f ), 
  i did n't mean cyprus , this is just why the government does n't budge . 
  sounds like you are missing out bro, 
  haha , ha . 
  classic vegetarian we devour animals * and * acquire their energy . 
  what is not awesome about that ? 
  well , [ see for yourself .

  well it does n't really matter either way . 
  they ca n't beat the taf even if they spent 200 % of their gdp let alone 2 % . 
  do n't get me wrong , one of my friends is an immigrant . 
  he told me that native europeans have every right to protect their homeland . 
  i have nothing against immigrants but we should all know our place .
