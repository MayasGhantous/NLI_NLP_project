  you 're racist if you see race in that . 
  i meant pale as in pure . 
  no no no of course not . 
  why are you bringing race into this ? 
  it 's about the culture . 
  i 'm just saying some cultures are better than others . 
   strong military lol, 
  ... cyprus is not a nato member . 
  aegean crisis is slightly more understandable but the tensions obviously did n't disappear when the two countries joined nato . 
  actually , no . 
  \u0130stanbul 's population used to be less than 1 million in 1950 . 
  now it 's +15 million . 
  and before that it was gradually depopulated due to constant wars until fatih sultan mehmet took it and brought in people from all over the empire . 
  culture . 
  a pale one . 
  they can never be french, 
   what are the french doing ? 
  it was a joke you dummies also i 'm not actually from mu\u011fla :3, 
  oh shit they are coming back noooo, 
   kebab pizza what kind of abomination is this, 
  seems like it 's a `` they kill muslims so they 're cool with me '' kind of thing for him . 
  it 's not the cartoons that are the problem , it 's the intent . 
  we all know what gw is made of . 
  it 's just another province , nobody cares . 
  it 's a `` state '' so that the government could go `` well we * technically * did n't annex it '' . 
  north cyprus is a formality . 
  it 's de facto turkish land with some complications . 
  to be serious , `` we '' were not unified . 
  kurdish provinces had `` feudal '' warlords that paid taxes to the emperor and ruled as they saw fit . 
  after the ottomans tried to reform and centralize ( ie install governors and enforce laws ) the country these warlords revolted to protect their status . 
  to this day most/some kurdish villages have their `` a\u011fa `` s . these revolts are nowadays claimed by kurdish revisionists to make it seem like they were revolting for `` their culture '' . 
  iirc there were several other kurdish rebellions ( see sheikh said ) but they were more about trying to bring the caliphate back after atat\u00fcrk abolished it than anything else . 
   then someone said on people , one nation , one flag . 
  played with the quran , changed the language , script and ezan . 
  the same dude made people change their clothing , banning the fez etc. 
  i do n't see what 's wrong with translating the kuran and ezan so that people actually understand what they say . 
  the complaints about the fez ban is very ironic also as mahmut ii banned the turban and made everyone wear fezzes in his own reforming efforts . 
  changing to the latin script increased the literacy rate from roughly 10 % to 90 % in a few decades . 
  i do n't know about you but i 'm glad we 're not [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/treatyofsevres_%28corrected%29.png ) . 
  but yeah , it can seem a bit cargo cultish from a distance . 
  oh yes , there are literally dozens of them . 
  no , this is not about you . 
  literally nobody cares about greece at the moment . 
  if akp needs a conflict to deflect attention they 'll use syria or iraq . 
   we were brother during the ottoman period , there was no racism but did they have rose tinted glasses back then ? 
  i know what it means , who are these `` scientific racists '' ? 
   only the real scientific racist minority among the supporters are secular what ? 
  might have something to do with left wingers being traditionally opposed the status quo . 
  there seems to be 2 competing truths here . 
  oy vey got ta love how out of this gigantic civil war only the muslims were terrorists . 
  totally not a charged term , nope . 
  come on man . 
  `` political enslavement '' is a made up term . 
  your ego just take that a few backwater duchies ( no doubt a center of renaissance without da mohammedans !!! ), 
  in the friggin middle ages lost fair and square . 
  i really do n't get what 's going through the mind of balkan nationalists . 
  are you seriously saying that they should 've been a socially liberal welfare state that respected its neighbors sovereignty ? 
  hello my friend !, 
  is cheaper just for you !, 
  come in !, 
  istanbul is a concrete jungle , would be cool to `` redesign '' it to have more of a unique feel to it . 
  in our case there is massive ( internal and external ) migration from rural areas to cities . 
  afaik istanbul 's population used to be less than 1 million in 1950 and now it 's around 15 million . 
  poor people *, 
  he knew it all along ... [ at least 3 children .

  as you might have noticed , in our case there is massive ( internal and external ) migration from rural areas to cities .

  ca n't the romance/italian speakers understand some of it ? 
  at that point might as well get a constructed language . 
  i think sticking with english and maybe reforming it should be the way to go not just for europe but globally as well . 
  we never really invaded france though , we teamed up with france ( and sometimes netherlands & england ) to fuck with habsburgs/catholics . 
  muh aegean islands watch the air space malaka, 
  \u2764 resistance is futile \u2764, 
  we 're coming for you ( \u273f \u25e0 \u203f \u25e0 ), 
  it 's the exact opposite actually , we do n't care at all . 
  i kinda like that . 
  he does this to literally everyone . 
   also the ` le ' ending is retarded , `` simple '' is either pronounced `` simpel '' or `` simpl '' we ( + crimean tatars & azeris ) use '' [ \u0131 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/close_back_unrounded_vowel ) '' for the e sound in words like `` maker '' or `` manner '' . 
  i \u0131 and \u0130 i are seperate . 
  sam\u00deing layk \u00f0ed kud bi dan for \u0130ng\u0131li\u015f . 
  the downside is that this would introduce the `` right '' way to say things so accents & dialects other than general american or the like could be shamed like how aave is currently . 
  a phonetic alphabet , fixing obsolete letters like c/x and making new letters for sh , ch , and th ( 2 letters for voiced and voiceless ) sounds . 
  layk \u00f0is . 
  also ie languages have this bizarre thing with gender rules , that needs to go . 
  it could do with a few ( mainly spelling ) reforms but other than that it just organically became the world language . 
  the content itself may or may not be , the problem is the people submitting it clearly have ulterior motives . 
  it 's never just `` politician says thing '' . 
  us would n't join the eu , it 'd be the other way around . 
  ** america !!!, 
  you should have a `` filter x '' button like / r/worldnews . 
  literally create entire cities instead of putting up with a few thousand people , god damn you guys are some insane motherfuckers . 
  oy vey what is this, 
  anatolia was referred to as rum only before the battle of manzikert . 
  shorty after anatolia was taken even westerners started calling the place `` turchia '' . 
  we are , they still plant ieds and do ambushes once in a while . 
  it 's not about losing or casualties when it comes to isis , for example they could end our tourism industry with a few well placed suicide bombings ( which is what pkk tried to do ), 
  well we kinda did defeat the romans a while back . 
  seems like isis wanted to get in on the fun a lil late . 
  yeah i wish they started firing , not .
