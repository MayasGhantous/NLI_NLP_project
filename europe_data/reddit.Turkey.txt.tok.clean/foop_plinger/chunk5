   chechens have always been a very violent people , kill the racism for once, 
  he 's not a very smart man, 
   muslim immigration very well could be , in the long term , the end of europe as we know it . 
  immigrants are literally vikings guys get a load of this guy, 
  this again, 
   no-go zones example : birmingham, 
  if your civilization is so weak that it feels threatened by some barely literate dudes in flip flops you need to take a good look at yourself, 
  i thought they treated westerners fairly well ... 
  yeah i 'm sure those tatars are terrible killers and the media is definitely not playing on people 's dumbass fears . 
  thems islamophobes for ya, 
  it 's a welsh loanword to both languages . 
  wait your turn kafir, 
  he means `` degenerate '' by leftist .

  but why stalk the guy, 
  meh , i get people `` ironically '' calling for muslim/turkish genocide all the time . 
  desensitized at this point . 
  check it out . 
  hmm , i think you have a point there muhammedallah . 
  i wonder what insightful social criticism we can mine out of you . 
  i 'm not sure how accurate this is because daily mail but if it is , my view of the guy changed a lot . 
   who is clearly well-educated i 'm doubtful . 
  chances are if he 's pretending to be retarded , he is . 
   i really wish he concentrated on positive aspects of it . 
  what are they ? 
  also remove kebab lol, 
  seems like you need to deal with it bro , it 's just a different worldview . 
   he caused his son to commit suicide by drinking bleach whoa , what happened here ?

  immigrants create racial tension -  proceeds to yell at immigrants, 
  nazis are socialist guys it 's in the name xdxdxd, 
  \u00d6 \u00dc \u015e \u00c7 \u011e \u0130, 
  that 's very low for one of the wealthiest , largest and populous countries in the world . 
  haha , bad words !, 
  you have a very distorted view of your fellow man . 
   their stated goal got ta love how ** people fleeing oppression/torture/death ** are politically unified and have a stated goal now . 
   the nations taking them in do so because international treaties force them to this is so that racist psychos like you ca n't shoot them on sight . 
  why are you trying to give them the bare minimum ? 
  something is not quite right here . 
   they 'd rather ship them all off to sweden hello / pol / .

  the aryans have lowered their defenses . 
  he dropped some television history on you son, 
  oh man , i loved these . 
  gets some `` values dissonance '' from time to time but it was awesome . 
  true but i 'm just uneasy with the drama that this sort of news generates . 
  `` we are worse than we ever were , the decline of europe '' etc is just pathetic . 
  everything will be just fine . 
  well you do n't have to worry about diseases , security and hunger every single day . 
  europe 's youth has it pretty good . 
  got ta love how africans fleeing for their lives are just casually disregarded . 
  `` yeah , of course nobody wants them !, 
  human rights ? 
  wurst time !, 
  this pleases me . 
  got ta get that karma son, 
  i think it would really help if they isolated news to subs like / r/islamnews , / r/christianitynews and the like . 
  if i want to learn about said religion `` person faced discrimination for x/y wins battle in syria/pope says something hip '' etc does n't help me . 
  i support israel 's right to be in eurovision . 
  / r/islam seems to have more islamophobes looking for a fight than muslims . 
  nope . 
  siyahi ( combining persian word for black and - i ) which means blacky is seeing more use in recent times tho . 
  i do n't think i 'm getting through with you mate . 
  lem me slow down and explain it you ; this is n't a video game , we do n't have racial stats . 
  it does make arabs born in europe , europeans . 
  ** literally ** . 
  which is what i said in my original post . 
  if i was born and raised in ( eu-side ) \u0130stanbul for example , i would literally be a european . 
  the title says * all * europeans and does n't specify anything about culture , politics or history . 
  i 'm asian born and bred ( no ancestors from balkans/greece either , 100 % t\u00fcrk ) , the reason i hang out here is the same reason i dick around in / r/iran , / r/judaism , / r/cyprus , / r/arabs etc. . because it 's fucking interesting . 
  this is the only sub that i get accused of having an inferiority complex or that i do n't belong or whatever . 
  trust me i would instantly hop over to / r/asia if it had similar traffic . 
  get your heads out of your asses guys . 
  are jews funny to you ? 
  why are you amused ? 
  i never claimed such a thing , how the fuck did we get here , projecting so hard you became archimedes ' mirror i 'm just saying that there are more turks than greeks , therefore it makes sense to include turks in statistics/discussions . 
  thanks for snooping through it , firefox gave a me get me out of here thing the first non-news link i clicked then i pussied out . 
  this is a bunch of fat middle aged guys i was expecting men in scrubs perfecting the science of kebab . 
  i was being sarcastic , i know . 
   same way ~ ~ a pakistani ~ ~ pakistanis mass migrating then taking over greece and surrounding countries for centuries , settling them and transforming the culture and history of the region forever . 
  there is no such thing as a german d\u00f6ner . 
  we had kebabs , and we spinned them . 
  and we called them spinning kebabs for a loooong time . 
  this is a hoax . 
  it says `` his claim was recognized by the association of turkish d\u00f6ner manufacturers '' . 
  i looked it up and they all turned up at this article . 
  the wiki also cites the same article . 
  chariot riders from the steppe do n't belong in europe . 
  you 're projecting by the way , calm your tsarouhi . 
  answered on behalf of albania & bosnia . 
  color metaphors for race getting awkward like that is apparently pretty common . 
  black , white and yellow ( no word for blonde ) are used for hair color here . 
  this leads to us calling black people `` zenci '' ( east africa , where arabs got their slaves ) and * asians * `` slanty eyed people '' . 
  to a fellow patriot from a patriot in exile , that made me cry red white and blue tears . 
  african-americans *, 
  absolutely haram,
