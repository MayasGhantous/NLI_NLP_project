  blasphemy , tar and feather this man, 
  reported , anti-semite . 
  there are literally more european turks than greeks . 
  in turkey kebab removes you, 
  d\u00f6ner means thing that spins . 
  it has nothing to do with germany . 
   d\u00f6ner kebab was invented in berlin [ uh no ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/doner_kebab#history ) . 
  it 's not german . 
  he basically said the weapons were for turkmens and that the journalist exposed state secrets . 
  there are a lot of far righters there actually . 
  yeah , romans just threw swords at pagans until christianity stuck . 
  belgium is the artificial island . 
  they are * richer than the rest of spain and they do n't want to share . 
  also some muh culture mumbo jumbo . 
  oops i made a funny lol, 
  and ? 
  is that supposed to invalidate the oppression jewish people face by their peers or what ? 
  well there you go , you can . 
  do n't drink the / r/european kool aid . 
  are you white ? 
   cause absolutely no problem for people outside their group so why are people whining about veils ( among other things ) then ? 
  it happens `` inside their group '' . 
  nice 88 there bro, 
  tfw you could n't civilize natives, 
   what for ? 
  actually it 's because we really need those islands . 
  i live on the aegean/mediterranean coast and i can see greeks islands from my house . 
  * they are so close yet so far . 
  this actually sounds like what a nationalist government would teach to kids . 
   i dislike late ottoman empire and hate some of their actions especially how they became pious after egypt 's conquest . 
  they could have forged an alliance with golden horde and mamluks since both were ethnically turkic ( mamluks were turk slaves brought to those lands and later rebelled ) i doubt any of them gave a fuck about turkic-ness . 
  babur , timur , safavids , qajars etc were turkic too but here we are . 
  his argument was that rome had already changed religions once ( thus `` byzantium '' being the second rome ) so the third rome would be muslim . 
  bullshit , you were modding / r/european a while back but i think you 're shedding your racism a bit . 
  what a dumbass . 
   fucking up the balkan ... the place was changing hands left and right all the time . 
  ottomans stopped the constant warring . 
  pax ottomana bitches, 
  also europeans were so scared they literally went around the world to avoid the ottomans . 
   darkness literally . 
  but i like being a hairy demon :(, 
  `` the world is their canvas and countries are merely colors on their palette . '', 
  interesting how it 's called `` fall of constantinople '' in the english wiki and `` conquest of \u0130stanbul '' in the turkish wiki . 
  also almost forgot this : allahu ekber, 
  also ultrafrench, 
  clone white people , duh . 
  by the way you fucking coward , stop using throwaways . 
  it 's pathetic that the answer you 're looking for is `` anything but living with non-whites i 'm for . 
  automation ? 
  whites having more sex ? 
  wat do ? '', 
  you need to um , harvest the sweat . 
  that would be really wasteful . 
  i was told police officers are valid targets so these are n't terrorists . 
  not even a spy , we literally have no idea who that guy was . 
  he could even be from tunisia or something for all we know . 
   it is not known where the agent is being held at the moment . 
  it 's straight up fabrication . 
  it 's a kurdish nationalist website and ...  a source asking to be anonymous whoever upvotes this is falling for it . 
  his grandpa was probably a nazi , i would be careful with that . 
  exactly the same with turks but i do n't see the purpose of that song at the end there , seems a little dramatic . 
  http://i.imgur.com/nlrqfot.gif what do you get from that comment ? 
  okay but how was that relevant also, 
  how is this relevant to what i said ? 
  / r/forwardsfromoma, 
  but what do you mean, 
  fucking cyrus is giving in to the semites, 
  bullshit , we only send gypsies and syrians . 
   they actually believe that eritrea will suddenly decide to comply with human rights obligations n only two days . 
  they do n't , that 's the problem . 
  they will always rationalize being `` the bad guys '' because it will shatter their moral superiority and ego if they do n't . 
  a condescending piece of garbage was the best thing they could come up with as an excuse . 
  i mean come on , a nice strong takbir out of that hymn would 've been amazing . 
  mostly the awkward aftermath . 
  awesome !, 
  i hope more is done to drop gender rules in ie languages . 
  get with the times . 
   '' we hope for two good days in eritrea with great conversations . 
  we expect that the eritreans will increasingly comply with human rights . '' i still do n't get why they do n't just drop these pathetic lies and say `` we do n't like you '' and be done with it . 
  contrary to popular belief , black people are n't coming to eat you . 
  he said that one could not be muslim and secularist at the same time because they were polar opposites and that only allah has supreme authority ( rather than the people ) . 
  then he flip flopped a couple years later . 
  [ vague and delusional rambling again ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nlrqfot.gif ), 
  these were * ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ grammar a few dozen guys and the right wingers went fucking ballistic . 
   or cameron public speeches on the occasion of muslim holidays . 
  got ta love being nice is replacing the christian civilisation now too . 
  what was the implication with this ? 
  `` they must know their place '' or what ? 
  what are you talking about, 
   that if you keep your traditions , your traditions will keep you . 
  it would be hilarious to see someone shouting takbir there , no ? 
  ( \uff61 \u25d5 \u203f \u203f \u25d5 \uff61 ) also tradition is stupid . 
  white and christian , everything else is clutter . 
   reddit is mostly young social liberal people . 
  * brogressives, 
  such degeneracy wow, 
  oh yeah , it has no red or black either . 
  `` blood '' and `` chocolate '' is preferred . 
   omg code switching in real life . 
  on reddit * .
