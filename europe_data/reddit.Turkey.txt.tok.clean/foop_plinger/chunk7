  uh no, 
  where did you see this being labeled as anti-russian ? 
  i like mocking nationalist just as much as the next guy but come on . 
  yeah `` wonder '' . 
  i thought nords had a natural resistance to frost but guess the russian winter is just that bad . 
  or rather `` are prussians/saxons/bavarians german ? '', 
  etc. . 
  afaik they are only independent because of political shenanigans in the 19/20th century . 
  wait are n't austrians german ? 
   massive inequality in russia , the wealth does not flow downstream . 
  this is not a problem that only russia has . 
  do n't ruin the joke man, 
  read up on the falmer bro, 
  sorry bro , being 1/1024 norwegian does n't count . 
  american guy looks like he 's having a good time , the rest look like dorks . 
  ah yes , muslims ( and `` second-opinioners '' ) outside of turkey telling me they know my country than me . 
  [ watch this if you have the time . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjreudqhmgm ), 
   most turks speak german you embarrass yourself . 
  he does n't give a shit about shariah , he only cares about money and power . 
  na man you do n't understand , it 's used ironically so it 's ok . 
  the joke is that swedes are race traitors, 
  germans did n't fight jews tho . 
  it was a pretty one sided affair . 
   this image seems like nazi propaganda http://i.imgur.com/x3bm5nm.gifv, 
  it basically `` archives '' the internet so that you can access the saved pages at a later date . 
  [ for example . 
  ] ( https://web.archive.org/web/20080410190800/http://reddit.com/ ) your userpage was not saved at any point but if someone really wanted to stalk you , they could manually save the pages ( or just visit your page everyday ) and piece the information together . 
   being on a crossroads , not because it was someone 's idea . 
  they already said this . 
  `` we should take advantage of our position as a bridge between afro-eurasia '' . 
  y' know there is still the internet archive for that . 
  this does n't have much to do with politics , pretty much every sub has this . 
  i think it 's due to people downvoting other posts so theirs get to the top . 
   the secular/anti-akp turks are n't some marginal privileged class and they do n't only live in istanbul . 
  this is the typical islamist narrative . 
  `` they do n't care about you !, 
  they are the bourgeoisie !, 
  only * we * care about you ( plz ignore the billions we are stealing tho , it 's in the kuran ) '' . 
  read it again . 
  i even ** bold 'd ** it . 
  it 's actually pretty nice ( except for the slow internet ) . 
  also he builds bridges, 
  people do n't want it . 
  about ** 30 % of akp voters ** `` want it '' . 
  i put want it in scare quotes because they agree with everything tayyip does . 
  yep , apparently they counted farm animals votes a couple years ago . 
  [ yep ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/persecution_of_ottoman_muslims ) millions died and much more were expelled simply because they were muslim/turkish . 
  anybody want to `` remember '' this every year ? 
  shhaileh is a weird surname . 
  must be a typo . 
  are you telling me they were not a 21st century social democracy, 
  there is only snow and moose that way . 
  this map ** massively ** overestimates the amount of minorities . 
   pontic greeks ? 
  armeniens ? 
  ethnicity not found, 
  tell me about it , we had chickens , dead and nonexistent people voting . 
  not in turkey . 
  they are pretty well assimilated . 
  it 's not entirely their fault . 
  boy will you be weirded out by them . 
  they have no shame , they literally want to be fucked by tayyip . 
  vast majority of them are conservative , the small formerly-communist ones are the ones you most likely hear about . 
  deport this terrorist, 
   our lack of green spaces does n't help . 
  then stop living in them concrete jungles and come to a small town . 
  forests as far as the eye can see . 
  getting gored by boars optional . 
  it has nothing to do with wealth . 
  i think people ( at least subconsciously ) associate physical exercise with children . 
  unless you 're a professional athlete , you are supposed to `` grow out of it '' .

   1000 healthy calories or 3000 junk calories \u00bf wat ? 
  that 's true for some other nations as well and of course they are not [ this ] ( http://i.ytimg.com/vi/er1ktf3smoe/hqdefault.jpg ) but it sure does look like they might be missing a few meals with that sharp difference there . 
  they would 've ethnically cleansed it just like how they ethnically cleansed the balkans . 
  he already said kebab . 
  i think it 's because nobody exercises , pretty much everyone over 30 has a beer belly/are over weight . 
  i hear westerners love going to the gym/running/hiking etc. 
  that stuff is barely socially acceptable here . 
  and malnourished . 
  1071 , without that no anatolia and kicking rum ass . 
  the more recent ones seem more important but i think 1071 was vital . 
  i know but it seems like straight up starvation in moldova . 
  ca n't resist the kebap \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u25d4 \u203f \u25d4 ) _ / \u00af also i wonder how much poverty contributes to the low rates . 
   they are now starting to take over the smaller villages nearby to create a brown culture ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  at least center the star & crescent . 
   the soviets were just as cruel if not worse . 
  nope , they were n't . 
  i 'm getting miffed with dumbass eastern europeans who think soviets were literally the worst thing ever . 
  source ? 
  [ did you ever want to try out some western religions ? 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/pmji1dw83hc?t=50 ), 
  hey hey hey wait a second , those were just concerned citizens . 
   socially correct  social suicide no such thing , you ca n't just replace political with social and expect it to make sense . 
  stick to r/european . 
  oy vey this went from +7 to -9 . 
  i wonder why ? 
  `` hey , now you do n't have the money to build whatever you want in your own property because some guy said something we did n't like two decades ago ! '',
