  muslims are already very alienated in europe , they know they are disliked but they are strong enough to soldier through . 
  we do . 
  besides even if we did n't , what 's your point ? 
  at least our `` fanatics '' are basically muslim calvinists , i hear us fanatics want the literal end of the world so their prophet can return again or whatever . 
   it 's funny how easily you guys fall for propaganda on reddit . 
  you 've been here for like 2-3 years posting nothing but pro-akp bullshit and you 're telling us about propaganda ? 
  / u/atopha / u/triumphact / u/unchecked1 / u/limmericky these are all the same people but / u/limmericky seems to be going active after a year asking about footage about hitler ( edit : he just deleted it ) , interesting . 
  also notice his change in demeanor overtime . 
  he 's been around for longer but limmericky is the earliest account i know of his . 
  nobody knows what mhp is for these days . 
  ey why is she wearing a niqab, 
  not sure if romans got that far . . 
  haha , words !, 
  everybody but the literal tayyip worshipers know it . 
  also interesting semi releated fact : [ the swiss justified the minaret ban with tayyip 's ramblings ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swiss_minaret_referendum,_2009#support ) ( that he went to jail for ) :  the initiators justified their point of view by quoting parts of a 1997 speech by recep tayyip erdo\u011fan ( later prime minister of turkey ) , which stated : `` mosques are our barracks , domes our helmets , minarets our bayonets , believers our soldiers . 
  this holy army guards my religion . '', 
   i really do n't see why racist stuff should be allowed . 
  the bizarre thing is that the racist morons who want '' * free speech * '' say that so they can advocate ethnic cleansing with their dog whistle language . 
   you should probably live where there is work to be found . 
  agreed !, 
  to be fair some of that land is barely habitable . 
  [ * dubious - discuss * ], 
   palestine is literally the little kid on the playground who keeps picking fights and then running to the teacher when he gets his ass kicked . 
  [ literally .

   israel tried a lot of different stuff . 
  [ relevant . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/itzb1n_ezxu?t=76 ) nsfl, 
  why is that relevant ? 
  hamas is n't a reason to keep israel as an ally , why do you mention them ? 
  [ get your jargon right , fellow young person !,

  yes . 
  konstaninapolis is kill, 
  1922 never forget . 
  all threads belong to america . 
  british is the same as english anyway . 
  afaik they were in the british empire at this time . 
  a big reason why they support israel so much is due to higher-up fundamentalists in america though . 
  i do n't know about you but i 'd rather see a plain stick figure when i 'm driving . 
  people who are n't defined by their sexuality , i reckon . 
  there is no need to insert `` love '' in a friggin traffic light regardless of genders . 
   the greeks have been publicly shamed , insulted , humiliated and spat upon by the rest of europe . 
  this much drama is painful . 
  ### degeneration of europe is here, 
  [ i 'm getting mixed signals . 
  ] ( http://www.cinacia.com/products/russian.jpg ), 
  india is lifting millions of people out of poverty every year . 
  i had an `` interview '' done many years ago for a local story , i think the crew just wants stock footage to fill the screen while somebody talks over it or something . 
  are you 60, 
  no , nazis were literally the worst people in history , period . 
  stop the nazi apologia , / r/europe . 
  careful , you 'll blunt that edge . 
   normal people, 
  damn you guys are some hysterical mofos . 
  it 's just a murder suicide , people snap sometimes . 
  who knew switzerland was n't a utopia where nobody has problems ? 
  shrug and move along . 
  i mean , what else was the guy going to do ? 
  people have to communicate somehow . 
  if he was muslim/brown , he would probably be getting a broomstick shoved up his ass 24/7 or deported but because he 's white he gets to play video games in a nice apartment . 
  these are n't the balkans i know and love . 
  at least be glad your grandparents were n't worked to death in concentration camps . 
  na man , those are just some bad apples . 
   no , it 's there to build ~ ~ character ~ ~ a career . 
  fixed . 
  ey man there is nothing wrong with holding dicks . 
  nice tabs there bro, 
  tes lore is serious business . 
  get your stereotypes about fictional races right . 
  you confuse them with the khajiit . 
  to be fair i doubt anyone in the 60s knew about just how powerful computers would get . 
  clone white people , fine/punish everyone else for reproducing . 
  yes ? 
  eu is not very concerned with morality . 
  more so than others . 
  so any trade at all was global because that 's all the people knew about . 
  there is nothing wrong with using regional . 
   darn ~ ~ dark elves ~ ~ argonians coming over here and taking our jobs !, 
  fixed , dark elves are the jews of tes , argonians are weird lizard men who work manual jobs outside the city walls . 
  boy if you think that 's extremism wait until you see real extremism . 
  using global really generously there . 
  yes . 
  because we would n't buy it . 
  you got it the other way around . 
  stating facts is ok , you are still wrong . 
  well that was underwhelming after that initial confident statement of yours . 
  he is banned , genius . 
  he sticks to his little hugbox these days . 
  then how do you know he was always for no speech restrictions ? 
   fuck off back to / r/asia 100 % freedom right here . 
  he was straight up telling people to `` fuck off back to / r/asia '' and mods only banned him after / r/subredditdrama came in . 
  strange thing is he now `` wants free , honest discussion '' . 
  the cognitive dissonance is real . 
   thousands of africans sinking in the mediterranean with countless more reaching their destination . 
  this happens all the time , why media chose to focus on it now is beyond me . 
   / r/europe became far more left wing that it was . 
  lol, 
   hitler was a war hero i do n't think that 's how war heroes work . 
  white and christian .
