  everybody does this . 
  damn , this is your first comment in 3 years ? 
  i am honored . 
  / r/europe is weird like that . 
  ca n't say something they are vaguely unsure about with this flair , especially for / r/europeans on desktop . 
  but [ you seem to love getting destroyed . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/redpillwomen/comments/2ofq43/looking_to_be_a_quality_girl/ ), 
  they are coming for our women is old stuff , tell me a new moral panic . 
  so yeah , they are not `` fucked '' . 
  what 's your deal then ? 
  they are not `` fucked '' currently , but that they will be * soon * ? 
  okay , but what if i just do n't like brown people ? 
  what then ? 
  will my government listen to my concerns ? 
  they are so fucked that they are literally one of the wealthiest & happiest countries in the world . 
  yeah , we have a habit of adventuring around and kicking a lot of ass in the process , both my parents ( and their parents and so on ) are from different places . 
  all your ancestors lived in the same village for the last 1000 years ? 
  cyprus got in after the war , greek cypriots rejected the unification plan . 
  yeah , i think he replied to me and the comment disappeared after refreshing the page . 
   muslim loving opinion sounds a bit like n-lover -- oh wait , you post in / r/european and fucking / r/whiterights . 
  well that came out of nowhere, 
  i think you might just be obsessed with immigration mate . . 
  how is this post up then ? 
  should 've waited until they 're all dead . 
  this is when the real fun begins . 
  just charge in and have fun but you can always come back and eat tear gas and batons again , because it happens all the time !, 
  [ fuat avni ] ( https://twitter.com/fuatavni_f ) ( fethullah 's men who infiltrated the gov ) say the police are ordered to arrest at least 2000-3000 protestors and that it will be '' [ bloodier than 1977 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/taksim_square_massacre ) '' . 
  after a fun session of poopball you need to clean up , bidets are perfect for that . 
  that 's not really being far left though . 
  sounds like a good time . 
  i can confirm the usefulness of bidets . 
  all toilets have bidets here . 
  these people need to be deported . 
  they obviously contribute nothing to the country . 
  mexican immigrants are lazy and steal jobs at the same time . 
  you ca n't explain that . 
  dude , you 're thinking about it too much . 
  / r/european = dumbass racists and that 's it . 
  fact : there are more things in a sewer than human waste , you just need to dive in and locate them first . 
  he does n't negotiate , he simply kicks ass . 
   i 'm muslim , and i do n't have much in common with erdogan - ** i ca n't even grow moustache . 
  ** oy vey , that 's a shame . 
  god is dead . 
  strange definition of successful there . 
  it was a massive improvement and let 's be real , the greeks would keep rioting over dumb shit until they collapsed to someone else . 
  there are a lot of those around . 
  that 's obviously not the reason . 
  why ? 
  did n't see the turkish flair ? 
  everybody 's on their phones these days ... 
  same deal here brother , the struggle is real . 
  everybody used to smoke . 
  it 's getting less popular now . 
  still no stigma though unfortunately . 
  damn son , lindybeige should stick to swinging medieval weapons around . 
  ### america, 
  [ wat ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/mustafa_abd%c3%bclcemil_k%c4%b1r%c4%b1mo%c4%9flu.jpg ), 
  maximum damage control, 
  well that 's no fun, 
  so it 's kind of like the `` all roads lead to sanskrit '' thing ? 
  they were civilized because they were catholics ? 
  besides , how did they `` bring proper civilization '' there ? 
  i dunno man , i 'm used to westerners using this rhetoric but seeing it come from poland of all places is weird . 
  but why ? 
   we in poland historically see ourselves as carriers of civilisation and enligthment to the east . 
  define natural . 
  why , / u/slyratchet ? 
  genetics do n't matter here . 
  ethnicity matters but genetics is more of a western obsession . 
  and most importantly , centralized the state . 
  ottomans let feudal lords rule as long as they paid their taxes . 
  far more than 50 % like him . 
  probably 80 % + ( excluding kurds ) like/respect him . 
  the people who `` undo his work '' do n't love him very much , genius . 
  ha , talking about bullying others to say the same ... 
  open your russia \uff61 \u25d5 \u203f \u203f \u25d5 \uff61, 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/herero_and_namaqua_genocide  in 2004 the german government recognised and apologised for the events , but has ruled out financial compensation for the victims ' descendants . 
  such outrage wow, 
  it 's actually pronounced jum so that does n't work unfortunately ; _ ;, 
  except they were taken as children and sent to anatolia for `` enculturation '' . 
   army was mostly made from foreign soldiers no, 
  looks like something a construction worker or some such would wear to me . 
  the correct term is byzaboo . 
  one day i will own this sub . 
  then prevent the parents from separating for long periods of time . 
  we should take kurds . . and push them to iceland . 
  [ no-go zones in scandinavia . 
  ] ( http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/europe/sweden_div96.jpg ), 
   most likely because of atheists/agnostics there . 
  afaik there are roughly 170.000 christians and 20/40 .000 jews , rest are non religious . 
  or maybe the map overestimates religious minorities , entirely possible . 
  those are official numbers , pretty much everyone is legally considered a muslim unless they get it changed as adults and nobody cares enough to do it . 
  edit : his original comment said 2 % and did n't have the 90 % . 
  yes . 
   yes , we have more money than you impossible . 
  same , no hindu in romania . 
  most likely because of atheists/agnostics there . 
   i fuck your god we have this too , `` allah\u0131n\u0131 sikeyim '' . 
  serbia ... 
  i am sorry to tell you this but even your swearing is turkish .
