my parents basically keeps one for my aunt , i do n't get it at all seeing how dialing a mobile number ai n't that hard if they already know how to dial a home number . 
  i do n't know how old your aunt is but it ** is ** a problem for my grandma . 
  she flat out can not use a dialpad so still uses a 1960 rotary dial . 
  why ? 
  because she can not be bothered with . 
  whatchyagonnado ? 
  last time an earthquake happened ( 1999 ) all gsm network gone bust , could n't handle the traffic . 
  landlines were working . 
  they also have their own power . 
  also in an earthquake , gsm base stations get bust ( power disconnection or the whole tower is destroyed ) . 
  you should be fine as long as your local phone exchange is intact . 
  some lines will still get thru . 
  having a landline and having to pay for telephone are different things . 
  you may have a landline from 1980s but you just use it for internet , so you should only pay for the internet provider not for telephone ( which you do n't use ) . 
  turk telekom forces you to also pay for the phone service which you do n't use ... oh , and they 're the biggest [ provider ] ( http://mrwgifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/south-park-comcast-character-nipple-rub.gif ) so you will pay . 
  in prague it 's pretty damn good . 
  metal as fuck , 
  they 're useful in emergencies . 
  but i do n't know anyone ( except my dad ) who still keeps landline just for this purpose . 
  it 's good to see that in turkey actually not many more people are subscribing !, 
  because turk telekom forces you to be a landline owner if you want internet ( adsl ) . 
  denmark is impressive . 
  almost all country went mobile , 
  the aegean dispute with greece . 
  it 's mostly over territorial waters but sometimes small islands gets disputed , too ( since many greek islands are literally enclosed by turkish land and waters ) . 
  what the current mass [ looks ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/aegean_6_nm.svg ) like , and what greece [ wants ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/aegean_12_nm.svg ) -- which is basically the total control of aegean sea . 
  he probably went back to his hotel . 
  took a shower . 
  switched on the tv and made himself a hot beverage . 
  lastly he uttered : `` bloody yanks '' , 
  it 's like asking `` why do you drive on the left ? 
  what 's wrong with you ? 
  why would you do that ? '', 
  or sorts . 
  more votes, 
  does it come with its own shopping mall ? 
  berlusconi , tayyip , putin , orban ... they are all butt buddies actually, 
  the future is already here : p2p, 
  if it does n't have vertical take off/landing i do n't think it 's really a flying car . 
  because then you need airstrips to take off and land instead of parking spaces . 
  were international affairs always like this or is it becoming like kindergarten ? 
  man , fuck modern art, 
  [ coat of arms already ready !, 
  \u0107evap\u010di\u0107i is also kebab . 
  so you are a kebab , too !, 
  are wends and sorbs the same thing ? 
  i 'm more afraid of their clunky auto detection systems ( and \u0421\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0430 `` \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0440 '' if they still keep it on ) . 
  there have been 2 incidents that i know of that they got false detection : the famous stanislaw petrov and the norwegian rocket incidents . 
  we did not see that comin ', 
  this actually looks better . 
  ceau\u0219escu had more taste than tayyip , 
  [ brutalism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brutalist_architecture ) ? 
  quite appropriate for tayyip . 
  reminds me of ceau\u0219escu and his palace . 
  i hope tayyip 's end will be the same ^ ^ click ^ ^ click, 
  i think it 's around 10 % . 
  i 'm so jelly ( here it starts at 130 % . 
  flat out inhumane ), 
  cheap booze , cheap restaurants and cheap skiing . 
  ( at least it used to be . 
  i do n't know how it is now ), 
  their technical approach . 
  usually high tolerances , opt in for a mechanical solution , rugged etc. 
  too bad this is mostly for military and they did n't care for consumer goods . 
  depressive, 
  at least you do n't have 10 % threshold . 
  you can choose between large and small shit whereas we have to choose among 2 or 3 large shit . 
   dps - mafia party # 3 just this [ fatso ] ( http://www.novinite.com/media/images/2013-06/photo_verybig_151277.jpg ) is enough mafia by himself . 
  ever visited turkey ? 
  it 's visa-free for georgians . 
  i have a friend who works in a watch shop in copenhagen . 
  you know that super expensive brand patek philippe ? 
  he told me not even a single dane ever bought one . 
  they sold 25-30 pateks within 2 years and it was mostly russians . 
  this is an [ aqueduct ] ( http://guidesofistanbul.com/eng/images/bozdogan_2/766662-roman_aqueduct-istanbul.jpg ) . 
  i 'm still baffled that no bank in europe has this . 
  that 's a million dollar idea right there , son !, 
  now ... all we need to do is to establish a bank . 
  then let the delicious euromonies flow . 
  drive thru banks . 
  sounds cool .

  long answer : `` femen is to feminism as peta is to vegetarianism/veganism . '', 
  short answer : b\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fcbs, 
  how did eu benefit from the ascensions of bulgaria and romania ? 
  pretty much the same thing . 
  $ 1,67 / l benzin price will make you regret that you took your car for a trip . 
  as you near istanbul , the motorway ( which ai n't free and does n't accept cash ) will become like a congested inner city road . 
  airplanes are indeed a marvel . 
   and they spit on people  ( though i 've been spat on a few times ) the fuck ? 
   upset with your internet in europe ? 
  protest upset with your internet in turkey ? 
  protest . 
  then , eat baton and cs gas . 
  in turkey people usually ask the hometown . 
  you 're free to pick whichever parents ' one is cooler , 
  - where are you from ? 
  - [ no dammit !, 
  yes, 
  only seen it in torrent and shady sites .
