  or jersey accent . 
  maybe you need a doctor who has been through * speciall\u00e6gepraksisplanl\u00e6gningsstabiliseringsperiode * :p you see what happens ? 
  you see what happens when you do n't use separators ? 
  this is what happens !, 
  this is what happens !, 
  it 's also done in scandinavian langs . 
  in danish : flugzeug = flyvemaskine ( flyve-maskine ) autobahnrastst\u00e4tte = motorvejsrasteplads ( motorvej-s-raste-plads ) i wish they used space or dashes though . 
  the long words look quite intimating for novices ( in turkish we use spaces thank the linguistic gods ) . 
  not a good stereotype in turkey . 
  lots of romanian women came to turkey for prostitution after the fall of socialism and many romanian ~ ~ gypsies ~ ~ roma also came in as peddlers . 
  we know you as dirt poor ( $ 13,251 vs $ 18,348 gpd ppp per capita , romania is still poorer than turkey if this indication proves anything ) . 
  in school , you are briefly touched in history classes as * eflak ve bo\u011fdan beyli\u011fi * ( wallachia and moldova ) which paid annual taxes to ottoman empire . 
  average people on the street do n't know anything about romania nor do they care . 
  the more the trust the less the bureaucracy i came to realize . 
  table as [ html ] ( https://drive.google.com/file/d/0byifw3atqeipbmpgskh4r09dnza/edit?usp=sharing ) format . 
   restore some armenian lands yarrrak var yen mi ? 
  - eat your ~ ~ p\u00f8lse ~ ~ \u062d\u064f\u0645\u064f\u0651\u0635 !, 
  also play a lot of multiplayer, 
  twitter plays the ball . 
  they do n't want to lose their turkish userbase by a gvmnt banning so they yield to some demands . 
  it 's money baby . 
  sweet sweet $ $ $ $ meanwhile , i am making a p2p twitter . 
  i want some of that money * ( and i am corrupt , too ) * !, 
  i would like to be the guy who fires up all the fireworks . 
  looks so damn satisfying . 
  cats \u2713 imported porn \u2713 domestic porn \u2717 we need more domestic production !, 
  what a retard . 
  www is not a protocol , it 's just a subdomain used traditionally . 
  some more bullshit from our elected retards . 
  i hope you are having fun europe  you know , turkey is a very fun and absurd country ( as long as you are n't its citizen ) . 
  also : [ `` the man is clearly an idiot '' ] ( https://twitter.com/andrew_duff_mep/status/457487879477141504 ), 
  \u0131f the app aint cheating at the last party poll , it 's alright-ish . 
  pretty much same in turkey for employees . 
  this tax and that tax you end up paying over 40 % . 
  why do you have strict alcohol control ? 
  constant cold and darkness ? 
  black metal ? 
  dragons ? 
  pretty damn cheap as i remember : 140 kr for 3 cases of tuborg ( 3 * 24 = 72 pcs of 330 ml . 
  so belarus is the terminus ? 
  it ai n't correct for turkey . 
  it 's more than 30 %, 
  there are worse cunts . 
  like the othe kgb piece of shit 's son ( ilham aliyev of azerbaijan ) . 
  q3 arena deathmatch is the way to settle the disputes . 
  everyone knows this  ^ you ^ have ^ taken ^ the ^ lead ^ ^ woaaaaaghhhh, 
  separate bicycle lanes so i do n't get murdered by a truck or a car . 
  also new people who do n't make fun of lycra bicycle wear would be nice . 
  done, 
  they 're inferior to most german sausage , though . 
  also very small in size . 
  35 kroner for a p\u00f8lse as big as my pinky and ca n't even feed my cat ? 
  ** all **, 
  it may be greek , turkish or arab but no fucking way in hell it 's german . 
  not a food but * pesto * . 
  i started to eat pasta again after discovering this magic sauce . 
  it is overratedly expensive in turkey ( because it 's imported ? ) . 
  i must enterprise in this area . 
  let 's just nuke the planet from the orbit and get done with it . 
  where 's your god now ? 
  they ca n't really enforce it unless they check everyone at the ports . 
  danes bring trailer loads of booze ( mostly beer though ) from the duty free from germany despite the limits . 
  ca n't be more than denmark ( ~ 46 % ), 
   prime minister recep tayyip erdo\u011fan 's chief economic advisor ** yi\u011fit bulut ** has claimed that ... yi\u011fit bulut also claimed that they were trying to assassinate tayyip erdogan with telekinesis : http://www.reddit.com/r/turkey/comments/1hyk3v/24_tv_editorinchief_yi%c4%9fit_bulut_appointed_pms/ we are ruled by jellyfish . 
  ridiculous but true . 
  for a nominal amount we 'll take them . 
  we have 1/2 million refugees already . 
  what 's 4000 next to them ? 
  ( if they escape to greece afterwards no responsibility is taken :p ), 
  yeah , this is very fair comparison ( ! ), 
  tip of the day ( for the danes & germans ) : there is a thing called space bar . 
  use it  if not , at least use dashes . 
  or are they also subject to heavy taxation ? 
  how about the informal * youse * ? 
  if you start compounding words , danish and german will create a lot of them like * speciall\u00e6gepraksisplanl\u00e6gningsstabiliseringsperiode * , 
  there is no turkish word that covers the meaning of ** franchising ** . 
  instead we use a group of words : sat\u0131\u015f tekeli hakk\u0131 * ( right to the sales from the monopoly ) * we also do n't have articles , prefixes and gender . 
  makes life much easier , 
  it 's good to see that denmark moved on to the schuko standard . 
  because youse still retain some oddities like the edb-socket and the 3-holed one ( smiley face ) . 
  ** schuko ** type ought to be the standard . 
  because it is the most [ pervasive ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/weltkarte_verwendeter_netzsteckertypen.svg ) one in europe ( and possibly the world ) . 
  but it 's too late now . 
  it will most possibly have immense cost to change the socket type of a country . 
  ** turkey ** we had [ local elections ] ( http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/yerel-secim-2014/ ) ( and massive election fraud . 
  especially in ankara ) . 
  twitter and youtube got blocked then unblocked then reblocked again . 
  graft leaks seem to stop ( and did n't change a thing ) . 
  maybe they will continue in the coming weeks . 
  just use latex already :p, 
  welcome to bureaucracy hell . 
  stay a while and taste the anguish . 
  it 's a bit old news is n't it ? 
  16.12.2013 ( at bottom of the page ), 
  heh good luck with that . 
  currently turkey is run by a dictator incapable of providing border security . 
  regardless , it 's double standard that i have to wade through bureaucracy and fees to get a visa for your country but you can come visa-free . 
  if turkey had 2 grams of balls in international arena they would n't let this . 
  same in turkey . 
  no need to complicate it .
