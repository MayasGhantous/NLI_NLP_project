  please edit your post accordingly and i 'll edit mine . 
  ** 55 ** years actually . 
   turkish parliamentary elections are n't proportional . 
  in the last national election , the akp won 46.7 % of the vote but was awarded 62 % of the seats in parliament . 
  since the system is built to circumvent the gridlock you see in a lot of other parliamentary systems , his voter base 's strength is exaggerated greatly . 
  ~ ~ correction on the numbers : akp got 49,83 % of the votes and 59,45 % of the seats in the parliament ~ ~ this is because [ d'hondt method ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/d'hondt_method ) and the 10 % threshold . 
  ` mucracy !, 
  turbo democracy !, 
  refuse the legitimacy of the current government maybe ? 
  fine them by ecthr when they do absurd things like banning websites . 
  all in all , pressure them . 
  i do n't think turkey was gon na access anywhere anyway . 
  a candidate since ** 1959 ** . 
  what a joke . 
  maybe help us remove tayyip , eu ? 
  get a room already, 
  let the exodus begin, 
  http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/yerel-secim-2014/ sauron wins the local elections , mordor will rule and extract revenge . 
  nemid : using a centralized java based login system . 
  simply genius ( ! ), 
  dst is fucking stupid . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84awtseb2-4 but these retards that delay it and cause disruption in computers are beyond that . 
  i really dont understand beer . 
  okay it tastes nice ( except fucking lagers ) but low alcohol content and no way to get drunk * [ takes a sip from his rak\u0131 ] * . 
  nice photos, 
  i remembered almost clearly ( because it hurt ) back in 1998-99 when we had to deal with 56 kbps , germans were surfing with 786 kbps for the same price :'( not much has changed . 
  he pretended to give a shit about eu in the beginning and assigned this [ clown ] ( http://cdn.internethaber.com/news/89743.jpg ) as the chief negotiator . 
  also fuck eu and us for greasing tayyip ( actually double fuck us for creating him ) . 
  up until gezi park protests i heard `` turkey is a developing conservative muslim democracy with a strong liberal economy bla bla bla '' from many leaders and news outlets like bbc , cnn , & c. countless times . 
  now imagine millions of the same kind of idiot like your pizza guy . 
  that 's what we have to face and deal in turkey ... every goddamn fucking day . 
  < offtopic  next time please take a better snapshot < / offtopic , 
  what kitties ? 
  he eats newborns for breakfast , 
  yes, 
  it all comes down to pronunciation ... fucking hard to master . 
  so what you 're left with is that you can read and write quite well but as you speak and listen the horror begins . 
  i support the monarchy if it is like the british one . 
  meaning : they bring more money ( by attracting tourists ) than they eat from our tax money . 
  otherwise fuck 'em leeches . 
  this is what you get for wearing sandals with socks , 
   it will be up for about two weeks , concluding around the 7th of january . 
  i cant wait that long !, 
  i\u00f8ll be dead by then, 
  feed 'em to bears . 
  army ? 
  what army ? 
  they 're all jailed . 
  you die on a finnish tram ... your body circulates the city until it decomposes totally . 
   ** same ** for norway , not so same after all this massive listing , 
  ... and this is how you wait at a [ bus stop in finland ] ( http://31.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lpffcq9ass1r0i8wko1_500.jpg ), 
  all the other reasons alone and even if turkey caught up with very high standard of living there will always be these 2 reasons : * eu does n't want to border the world 's one of most unstable countries ( syria , iraq , iran , armenia , georgia ) . 
  why ? 
  because : smuggling , human trafficking , immigrants & c. * eu would n't want turkey to be the 2nd largest majority in the european parliament . 
  so , no way . 
   barcelona , spain -- kurds , who are gaining more relevance against the backdrop of changes in the middle east ... kurds can not into relevance, 
  this is good ( if it ever happens ) . 
  to all those `` mamma li turchi !, 
  '' - ers : this is not free roaming and working rights , it 's just that turkish tourists will not have to get visa to visit . 
  already eu citizens can visit turkey visa-free , why not vice versa ?!, 
  if turkey actually had balls and did n't depend on eu tourism they could have also implemented visas to eu countries . 
  fear he who operates that monstrosity !, 
  ye shall tremble and your posh cities shall vanquish !, 
  vroom vrooom motherfucker !, 
  this is news ?!, 
  if that retard tells me 2 * 2 = 4 i still wo n't believe him, 
  `` gib monies '', 
  # violate their personal space, 
  that is the ultimate idea . 
  * '' ... perfect world ... in which there 's no war or famine , oppression or brutality . 
  one vast and ecumenical holding company , for whom all men will work to serve a common profit , in which all men will hold a share of stock . 
  all necessities provided , all anxieties tranquilized , all boredom amused '' *, 
  i do n't see how eu bordering japan would still be considered eu . 
  russia is huge !, 
  ( also i dont think they would ever want to join eu ), 
  since this is a r/europe subreddit i assume that people who post/comment/rate here come with a very pro-eu mindset . 
  how do they read official documents in moldova then ? 
  usually they ( documents ) are in a single language ( romanian ) are the documents bilingual ? 
  i eat my pasta with hummus ... probably a sin i am committing . 
  i think erdogan is truly retarded . 
  he has no single grain of geopolitical and diplomatic knowledge . 
  forget all about eu , turkey is a nato member . 
  well at least he did n't beg to nafta . 
  bulgaria is really corrupt . 
  they need to introduce mechanisms to prevent corruption . 
  it 's not only the parties , it 's the civil servants who are corrupt as fuck . 
  you can get a drivers license just by paying money and the `` guy '' will deliver it to you ( no need to attend courses or the exam ) . 
  i guess the mechanisms will also fail since these people are not removed from their posts . 
  as if there are n't mosques in every 100 metres in turkey ( seriously , turkey has the most number of mosques in the ** world ** , over 80,000 ), 
  that 's why scots want their independence , 
  how is this a big deal ? 
  also ** yarrro ** :p ( * seriously heard it pronounced this way in all seriousness * ), 
   for 30 million euros . 
  that 's cheap , i guess . 
  this would only work in small cities and in countries where majority does n't drive like an asshole . 
  yeah mmp is pretty awesome . 
  how does this constitute as democracy i will never know, 
  yup . 
  funny that eu has ** nothing ** to say about the election system and conscription in turkey . 
  how do you expect this country to have a democracy with all this shit ?
