  in denmark , the election threshold is only 2 % !, 
  look how many various voices are represented in * folketinget * : venstre ( 47 ) socialdemokraterne ( 45 ) dansk folkeparti ( 22 ) radikale venstre ( 17 ) socialistisk folkeparti ( 15 ) enhedslisten ( 12 ) liberal alliance ( 9 ) konservative folkeparti ( 8 ) sambandsflokkurin ( 1 ) javna\u00f0arflokkurin ( 1 ) inuit ataqatigiit ( 1 ) siumut ( 1 ) then come back and look at turkey 's parliament : akp ( 326 ) chp ( 135 ) mhp ( 51 ) bdp ( 29 ) independents ( 7 ) vacant ( 2 ), 
  the 10 % threshold does n't apply to independent candidates , since they have no party . 
  but they can join or form a part inside the parliament ( which they do , see [ bdp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peace_and_democracy_party ) ) . 
  maybe bulgarians should form a reaction party like movimento 5 stelle and call it \u0434\u0430 \u0435\u0431\u0430 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u044f  because i do n't think protesting alone will conclude anything . 
  protesters should get involved in politics despite how hard and money consuming it seems while bulgaria still retains 4 % election threshold . 
  the power of a mustache must not be underestimated !, 
  yes but here is the catch : the ** 10 % ** election threshold !, 
  which causes 2 or 3 parties to enter the parliament . 
  the rest gets nothing ( i.e less than 1 % ) . 
  ** cut off ! ], 
  -- * sp - saadet partisi ,1.25 * has - halk\u0131n sesi partisi ,0.76 * bbp - b\u00fcy\u00fck birlik partisi ,0.74 * dp - demokrat parti ,0.65 * hepar - hak ve e\u015fitlik partisi ,0.28 * dsp - demokratik sol parti ,0.25 * dyp - do\u011fru yol partisi ,0.15 * tkp - t\u00fcrkiye kom\u00fcnist partisi ,0.14 * mp - millet partisi ,0.14 * mmp - milliyet\u00e7i ve muhafazakar parti ,0.09 * emep - emek partisi ,0.07 * ldp - liberal demokrat parti ,0.04 another catch : if you get less than 7 % you are not eligible to get party support money from the state . 
  so the big gets bigger ; the small diminishes . 
  so in countries like romania and turkey establishing an officeless party like piratpartiet is not possible . 
  ` mocracy !, 
   you need headquarters in at least 15 counties . 
  headquarters require money for rent , which small parties do n't have . 
  that 's still `` good '' . 
  afaik in turkey you need to have active offices in at least 40 out of 81 provinces ... plus their districts !, 
  there are 77 parties in turkey but only 15 or so can manage to enter the elections . 
   kalmar union just have one currency and i am more than okay with that . 
  call it * super fedt nordisk krone * with pictures of glorious viking stuff so people like and use it , 
  now it all comes together, 
  what about that vegetable ? 
  would be used as a ** weapon ** ? 
  * russia # 1 * turkey # 2 http://www.bloomberg.com/visual-data/best-and-worst/most-heavily-policed-countries look on the bright side bulgarians , you wo n't be beaten as bad as turkish and russian protesters , 
  not a bad idea . 
  if only i was the macedonian pm  make the entire country a giant casino = $ $ $, 
  any videos ? 
  or start a new one with the fresh spirit of the protests . 
  ... and you are even probably willing to pay a wee geb\u00fchr for that . 
  but nope !, 
   germany has a largely cash based society ( which is frustrating ) . 
  you wan na use your visa card in lidl/aldi do n't ya ? 
  well , too bad !, 
  you ca n't !, 
  now raus !, 
   autobahn i wish most of the a-7 was ~ ~ 3 \u00d7 3 ~ ~ 2 \u00d7 3 lanes :(, 
  count yourself lucky ... very lucky, 
  19 % car acquisition tax ... sweet  * ( it 's over 180 % here ) *, 
  yes but it 's still bigger than monaco !, 
  i dont know about romania but bulgaria should first clean off its corrupt traffic cops . 
  there are cops virtually in every kilometre !, 
  transiting bulgaria is a `` bit '' of annoyance . 
  even a 2-star restaurant ( like [ noma ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/noma_ ( restaurant ) ) ) costs shit load and you have to wait months to get a reservation !, 
  i doubt that the food will get you high or give or orgasms but i 'm sure one would feel quite posh . 
  even if they resigned , do you have the less corrupt and less mafia politicians to replace them ? 
  it would be such a shame ... say , if that rock was eroded or replaced by some act of the * nature *, 
  what 's the baton & tear gas situation there ? 
  none , mildly , severe ? 
  i think the aegean and gibraltar disputes dwarf all the rest . 
   lucrative fisheries grab the rock , declare it an island , have a radius of 12 nautical miles of territorial water , catch fish = profit $ $ $ $ $ $ $, 
  ah , okay then !, 
  if you have a wikipedia page then you are a legit protest :p, 
  also do they have a wikipedia page ? 
   on tuesday the bosphorus bridge was shut down to let tiger woods make a transcontinental golf shot . 
  apparently to `` advertise istanbul . '', 
  nobody was happy about it . 
  this is why turkey is still a 3rd world country : closing down one of the busiest bridges in one of the biggest cities ( 15 million inhabitants ! ), 
  for private advertisement with utter disregard to people of istanbul . 
  i do n't think erdogan have the faintest idea about what democracy is . 
   a university scholar recommends putting up smaller danish islands for sale . 
  source i would buy \u00e6r\u00f8 for a dollar !, 
  * ( and enslave the islanders * ^ muhuahuhahahaahuahuahuahha ), 
  i 've been to quite many metal concerts and festivals but i ca n't really say i saw such a thing . 
  maybe it was a * ballad * song ?!, 
  but why are they in english ? 
  [ my eyes !, 
  `` i 'm the devillllllll '' good thing he did n't whip out his knife :p, 
  replace italy with turkey and you get pretty much the same thing . 
  maybe the hat of ** \u0161 ** might be off by 0,00001 \u00b0, 
  ahhhh politics and bureaucracy, 
  also no love for turkish :'(, 
  so you can harvest their organs ? 
  you sneaky sneaky finns !, 
  why would your archbishop care in the first place ? 
  this is a ~ ~ troll ~ ~ pm still claims that they have not meddled with people 's lives and privacy . 
  as long as they are dark comedies me likey ... otherwise that weepy drama stuff me no likey * festen * might be an exception though . 
  well i did n't put a disclaimer there for i think any sane person would know that both do n't mix well  ( this is r/europe not r/murica :p we do n't need disclaimers for everything . 
  like on a beer : `` drink cold '' ), 
  just cross the \u00f8resund and the fun stops :d land of the gloom and volvo . 
  i had to slap some teenagers in j-dag ( i regret nothing ), 
  oh norway !, 
  yeah that 's what also surprised me . 
  this map is shit . 
  cheap car and alcohol prices, 
  what 's that heresy you talk of ? 
  [ this ] ( http://www.ogretmenhatti.com/images/articles/321.jpg ) fruit ( on a side note : geese fucking love 'em ), 
  one of the most overrated countries in the world . 
  ... and that 's the horror, 
  dut means mulberry in turkish , 
  heh this reminded me of the austrian pastafarian guy 's drivers license  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-14135523, 
  my grandparents live in bulgaria and there are 2 stereotypes of gypsies : the bad and the good the bad ones are the travelers . 
  they steal your chicken , animals etc. 
  the good ones are the already living ones in the village in houses . 
  as long as they are not ghetto-ized . 
  i dont know the rest of bulgaria but in the north , ( the good ) gypsies actually earn more money than bulgarians and turks . 
  i guess all in all it 's not a problem of ~ ~ assimilation ~ ~ integration but money . 
  h = ho ( so is k = ko  ) w is not native to danish afaik . 
  mankind will colonize the solar system but the cyprus dispute will still persist .
