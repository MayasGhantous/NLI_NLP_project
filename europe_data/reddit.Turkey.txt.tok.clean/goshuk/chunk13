  casio databank [ watches ] ( http://www.tvfilmprops.co.uk/userdata/prodpic-1907.jpg ) and databanks [ themselves ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/casio_sf-8000_digital_diray.jpg ) in 90s, 
  i am more interested in the fact that how those women tolerate an average episode which is 1 1/2 -2 hours long ( probably nearing 3 hrs with commercials ) 0_0, 
  poor and corrupt buffer state with low and declining population . 
  no railway link between turkey ( also break-of-gauge ) . 
  but there is a project called * kars -- tbilisi -- baku railway * which will hopefully be opened in 2014 . 
  i think this price/performance even beats romania and bulgaria which also have very good p/f ps : you lucky bastard, 
  copenhagen , 100 mbps down/60 mbps up , \u2248 50 kr ( $ 6,7 ) / month , type : over ethernet http://www.speedtest.net/result/3063921793.png, 
  even ^ even ^ even ^ even ^ even ^ even ^ even ^ even ( * tayyip pls die * ), 
   who has won the lottery nine times which is another way of saying money-laundering . 
  i would never live somewhere permanently but long term . 
  a place with decent economy and sunny weather would be my choice . 
  i 've read somewhere ( probably hurriyetdaily ) that there are some real tolerance issues but what the hell ... open it anyways . 
  you filthy rich fuckers ! ^ sneer , sneer , sneer, 
  funny that turkey is not on the list ( even kazakhstan is ) . 
  if it were , it would have been the 2nd highest with $ 1,75 for a litre of a95 gasoline . 
  one way !, 
  especially if you are crossing ( and insane ) the bosphorus strait . 
  it would make sense if there was a cheap bullet train express service  ( 4,96 hrs of travel one way at 300 kph ) many people in istanbul spend around 3 hrs ( one way ) to commute to work . 
  totally doable :p, 
  you can only trademark the name afaik . 
  ^ sligthly better roads than bulgaria and less corrupt traffic cops, 
  occupy movements and recent riots ( turkey being the latest * previous * example ) do not change much if anything at all . 
  you need the hit the state where it hurts , by stop paying taxes -- which is nearly impossible in europe because many people automatically pay it ( through their company/unless they own their own business ) . 
  do n't know how to this though . 
  if it was possible and people did this en masse the result would be `` effective '' . 
  what a ridiculous country and prime minister . 
  not a european country . 
  but does the law also affect non-bg corporations ? 
  and black metal !, 
  or any kind of metal . 
  yeah , denmark sucks in metal . 
  i agree . 
  people who wanted to go can still go ( and they already had ) , there are no travel restrictions . 
  maybe finland , germany and netherlands are `` afraid '' ( alongside their populism for votes ) of illegal immigrants who enter via bg & ro and contraband ? 
  i do n't know . 
  ** [ a\u00e7k\u0131 ] ( http://www.tdk.gov.tr/index.php?option=com_bts&amp;arama=kelime&amp;guid=tdk.gts.5265bbc191d4c3.30834285 ) ** is also a turkey turkish word albeit a rarely used one . 
  is way more influenced by russian ( naturally ) so i do n't think it 's fair to say any of those languages are any purer than each other . 
  then again , is there such thing as a pure language ? 
  just sayin ' :p, 
   azeri and turkish is related , how much exactly , i ca n't say . 
  like danish and swedish . 
  quite close i would say . 
  * dictatorship . 
  * turkey 's * brother * country though aliyev seems to have closer ties with moscow . 
  * ( sort of borders ) turkey . 
  nakhchivan exclave has a couple of kilometres with turkey . 
  * iran harasses it occasionally over the caspian . 
  * uses russian track gauge . 
  denmark looks like a mitten , 
  this data ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:countries_by_most_used_web_browser_ ( update ) . svg ) would disagree with that map, 
  ask the west germans , they 'll tell you the opposite . 
  [ hospitality ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hospitality_industry ) ! = hospital, 
   last night ankara 's municipality destroyed metu 's private forest to make a road and there were protests i know that metu is just a collateral in gokcek 's thug rule but ankara totally deserves that weasel . 
  they 've been electing him over and over for ages . 
  what a shame . 
  heheh , remember the * det bl\u00e5 punkt * scandal on this summer ? 
  and they were about to abolish * klippekort * s without proper testing of their beloved blue point . 
  tsk tsk tsk, 
   the ruling socialist party decided to submit a bill which would un-ban smoking in cafes , restaurants , bars , clubs , etc , if successful . 
  the coalition partners agree , so it is expected to pass . 
  i am guessing that tobacco companies are somehow `` involved '' within this bill . 
  i do n't think romania can pull off a unification anytime soon . 
  that is of course unless it does n't pay for the costs . 
  possibly japanese people . 
  but i think they also wear those surgical masks in japan , too . 
  oh man , i am getting so high right now . 
  just showing a table of those toxic gas amounts ( [ ppm ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/parts-per_notation ) ) in the article would have been sufficient for me . 
  but i think journalists are retards when it comes to mathematics . 
  open-close-open-close-open-close-open-close-open-close ... turkey has been applying since 1959 ( eec times ) . 
  both parties are well aware that this is going nowhere but keep cycling on/off . 
  politics is irrational . 
  that was my thinking , too . 
  which is never, 
  sweden ... your move . 
  if it was up to me , there must n't be roaming within the eu countries . 
  i live in copenhagen and frequently go to malm\u00f6 , where roaming screws me . 
  winter slauchen, 
  how much is the company tax rate in luxembourg ? 
  solution is very hard to implement . 
  first you need to destroy people 's prejudice and racism ( which has been going on for centuries ) against them . 
  maybe this is easier in countries which roma population is not that much but elsewhere quite tough job to do . 
  secondly , you need to somehow stop them from abusing their children . 
  thirdly , you need to give them jobs which might cause positive discrimination ( a.k.a [ they took our jobs ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=768h3tz4qik ) ) . 
  yup . 
  you got them you get to keep them . 
  maybe after the war they can go back home . 
  you know not what you speak of you heretic !, 
  and harsh language will be exchanged  btw , in turkey you are way more likely to get beaten , mutilated , tortured and killed by a cop rather than getting any help from one . 
  fences and walls are not the solution but piranha and crocodile filled moats are !, 
  they were a fucked up bunch but damn !, 
  was * mayhem * good . 
  eu gib monies plox we needz to build a wall, 
  is nazi memorabilia illegal in greece ? 
  ( disregarding the amassed 4000 or so firearms and this whole particular `` collection '' ), 
  not for p\u00f8lse that 's for sure , 
   have raised serious concerns yeah , that 's all there is and will be : `` serious * concerns * '' . 
  what will you do eu ? 
  nothing !, 
  they praised and praised that islamofascist and turkey as `` a conservative yet secular country with liberal and booming economy '' . 
  they kept on greasin ' and greasin ' him and his party .
