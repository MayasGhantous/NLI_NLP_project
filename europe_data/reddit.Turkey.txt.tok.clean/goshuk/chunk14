  women ... they sure do smell nice but they 're soul murderers . 
  how do you guys see what satellites you are using ? 
  a specific app for that ? 
  is dgps ( differential gps ) in use by many countries now ? 
  or is it still under development ? 
  for i remember dgps gives almost military precision . 
  they do n't even have their own currency . 
  what kind of diacritics ( if you know ) ? 
  - say - would polish \u0105 , danish \u00e5 ^ 1 or turkish \u011f be acceptable ? 
  ^ 1 : ( * probably permitted in slesvig-holsten ) *, 
  that would be a tasty child right there , 
  it 's usually like that : `` something something boo turkey ! '', 
  i know turkey has a lousy human rights track record and has been run by a tyrant for the last decade but c'mon . 
  since the refugees made it to the golyam dervent that means they 're freely roaming in turkey ( no surprises there ) and will try to use bulgaria as a jump point to inner eu . 
  french passport holder would have been more appropriate . 
  isnt it the only always non-frozen naval base of russia in baltic ? 
  vojvodina ... hmmm i see another potenital declaration of independence :p, 
  maybe the greeks you know because these ones would n't prefer the bottom of the sea : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jczxdcsl2tu, 
  this is the same retard and troll who claimed that they were trying to assassinate erdogan with telekinesis . 
  he is the pm 's adviser because the dicks he sucked to be in that position is ( are ) uncountable . 
  now his trolling makes the international scene ?!, 
  what a joke turkey has become . 
   does \u00e7oban mean shepherd ? 
  yes . 
   `` e\u015fek gibi '' ( like a donkey ) , i 've heard it 's a valid reply , when people are asking you how you are . 
  it 's probably in the context of work , as in `` working * like a donkey * '' . 
  not a common thing to reply like this though , 
  that does n't come to me as a surprise . 
  never mind the insensitivity and ignorance in many young people in turkey for now , they do n't teach nothing but ottoman history over and over again until you finish high school in turkey . 
  and the quality of what is taught as history is low ; mostly comprising dates and war names . 
  many people do n't know against which armies ott . 
  empire fought in ww1 or even the establishment date of the republic ... and add the `` facebook generation '' on top of it : you will have brainless retards like these two . 
  i hated history when i was at school , loved it on my own time later on . 
  these are quite vile , but funny ( in turkish ) : * `` senin koyun g\u00fctm\u00fc\u015fl\u00fc\u011f\u00fcn kadar benim \u00e7oban sikmi\u015fli\u011fim var '' : ( hard to translate ) `` i 've fucked as many shepherds as the sheep you herded '' * [ meaning : you ai n't got shit on me you rookie ] * * `` tedariksiz abdeste giden domala domala ta\u015f arar '' : `` the one who shits without preparation looks for a stone while squatting down '' * [ meaning : if you are unprepared you will face the consequences ] * * `` kasaba minnet edece\u011fime keser \u00e7\u00fck\u00fcm\u00fc yerim '' : `` instead of pleading to the butcher i would rather chop off my dick and eat it '' * [ meaning : i think it 's pretty self explanatory ] * * `` tav\u015fan ta\u015fa s\u00fcrtm\u00fc\u015f , da\u011f\u0131 siktim demi\u015f '' : `` the bunny humped a stone but said he fucked the mountain '' * [ meaning : delusions of grandeur ] * though i think a lot is lost in translation . 
  did not know that the paragraph also included communism . 
  so , will wearing - say - a hammer & sickle t-shirt get you in trouble in poland ? 
  or ctrl + shift + u + e6 on a linux os . 
  eu accepted bulgaria and romania . 
  why not bosnia ? 
  eu is already screwed as it is , what is the worst that could happen ? 
  let all ex-yugos & albania join ( they will eventually . 
  in 10-15 years time methinks ) . 
  i am gon na go out on a limb and say tuition is not free for foreign nationals in serbia . 
  so , ** monies ** !, 
  agreed . 
  way too much . 
  sweating before you go arrive in your office , club , restaurant etc. 
  well at least they will * probably * learn it the hard way that stupidity not always goes unpunished . 
  * the country is actually 3 countries wrapped together : bosnian side ( capital : sarajevo ) , serbian side ( capital : banja luka ) and croatian side ( capital : mostar ) . 
  also they all use different car license plate formats !, 
  they are like a confederation in a sense . 
  for instance , serbian side can not use the hospitals in the bosnian side . 
  * really corrupt . 
  * they call turkish coffee bosnian coffee ( well at least in the bosnian side ) . 
  * many bosnian refugees in denmark . 
  * most of them are not only tall but large , as well ( probably same with all ex-yugo countries ) . 
  one day a lot of `` common '' people will get fucked and they will learn that there is this thing called free software and will wonder `` why the fuck we ignored this all along ? 
  '' ... but it will be too late . 
  yes, 
  give us your oil you filthy rich norwegians !, 
  tallest motherfuckers ( avg . 
  height ) in eu ( oh also , flat as fuck and weee bicycles ! ), 
  poorer than czech rep. :p got the worse part of the deal ( * the velvet divorce * ), 
   which is why it is a shame that we in some western countries only experience it as the suspicious looking kebabs we consume at 3 in the morning while under the influence of alcohol . 
  wonder why american fast food is not more popular in many eu countries or they have n't come up with an alternative [ gnam gnam ], 
  a bit trivial stuff : * probably the only country in the world which does n't have a coat-of-arms or a seal or a national emblem . 
  * all of its neighbours use anything but latin alphabet ( bulgaria : cyrilic , greece : greek , syria & iraq & iran : arabic , armenia : armenian script , georgia : georgian script ) though turkey uses latin alphabet . 
  * insane taxes on cars and gasoline * tea is far more popular than coffee despite that ottomans brought coffee to europe ( in vienna siege ) * highest election threshold of any country in the world ( ** 10 % ** ! ), 
  * ankara was set to be the capital for istanbul is wide open to enemy attacks . 
  one of the few countries which situated its capital strategically . 
  * got embargoed by usa for opium production back in '70s * major exporter of its tv series to balkans and the arab world . 
  * ~ 18 % of its population is packed within istanbul * it 's a peninsula but sea food consumption is trivial in turkish cuisine * military service is compulsory ( 6 to 15 months ) . 
  conscientious objection is punishable by law and is indeed punished actively . 
  * station wagons are not popular at all , in contrast to the rest of the europe . 
  * 90 % of its transport is via land routes . 
  * though secular by law it retains a * presidency of religious affairs * * though not participated in ww2 still got some aid from the * marshall plan * * * gezi park protests * were the largest riots/protests ever witnessed in its history ( since 1923 ) . 
  expelled hundreds of thousands of turks in 1989 . nobody in europe seems to remember this . 
  average turk ( 60 % of the population ) does n't know much about anything -- let alone cyprus . 
  there was a street interview ( among many others ) couple of years ago . 
  there are some people that believe turkey fought against japan in wwi and many do n't know the establishment date of their own country . 
  are the protests being ignored by the mainstream media ? 
  if it is , i see a parallel here . 
  that motherfucker !, 
  if eu really wanted to solve the problem they would start investing in those countries where most immigrants are coming from . 
  of course they have to first solve the poor , tired , huddled masses of their own . 
  flat as fuck . 
  denmark can not into ski, 
  though i agree partially i do n't get why turkey needs to adopt * eu criteria * . 
  i know most of the criteria are positive but look at japan . 
  they are pretty cool and they do n't need any external criteria to follow . 
  or at least turkey can follow the eu level without trying to become a member ( which it has been pursuing since ** 1960s ** ), 
  also the eu does not want to border some of the most fucked up countries in the world . 
  like , ermmm , oh gosh i dunno maybe iraq , syria , iran , armenia ? 
  it 's miles and miles long border with them . 
  can one imagine the influx of contraband and the immigrants ? 
  eu ca n't even secure italian and greek borders let alone this gigantic new border . 
  this is a tale of carrot and stick . 
  * eu : * come bunnyyy bunnyy bunnyyyy * turkish public : * nope !, 
  ( meanwhile the politicians of turkey are still trying to push this `` dream '' ), 
  also houses erenk\u00f6y / \u039a\u03cc\u03ba\u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1 exclave and mara\u015f / \u0392\u03b1\u03c1\u03ce\u03c3\u03b9\u03b1 ghost city .
