  i believe they can use transliteration from whatever kurdish script they choose ( possibly kurmanc\u00ee ) to turkish alphabet as far as the official documents are considered . 
  like they can transliterate x '' ks , w '' vv etc. 
  also very good point you have made . 
  like in denmark you can not have \u063a\u0632\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u062c\u0627\u0648\u064a\u062f on your driver 's license so i do n't know why turkey has to accept another set of script . 
  for kurds ' shop , firm whatever names they can use whatever they want . 
  * more racist than greece ( the southern side ) * baf / \u03a0\u03ac\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2 is the most arable land on the island * northern side is not recognized ( duh ) so it relies on aid from turkey , influx of mainland university students and gambling clientele ( because of this native northerners hate mainland turks ) * a lot of brits buy land and villas from the northern side . 
  * it 's an important base in the mediterranean so neither turkey nor uk will let go of its bases and lands there . 
  romania should legalize \u041a\u0440\u043e\u043a\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043b :d, 
  as if israel is in europe !, 
  they can bark all they want . ^ who ^ the ^ fuck ^ are ^ you ^ israel ? 
  not only for europeans but whoever cares about their privacy : run your own server !, 
  but for audio/video call and chat , you 're pretty much limited to 3rd party applications like skype . 
  ability to eat rugbr\u00f8d , lakrids and leverpostej ... integration bitch :p, 
  tuborg and carlsberg are like piss but slots is just sewage water . 
  but at least it 's cheap , not like tuborg & carlsberg . 
  i 'd rather have lidl weissbier instead . 
  unless you wade your way through camel , desert , eu and arab `` jokes '' ( read : taunts ) about turkey , 
  slovenia should be the least of your worries while there are romania & bulgaria . 
  neverminding their epic corruption levels their gdp per capita are $ 7,934 & $ 7,033 while turkey 's is $ 10,666 . 
  i know this is kangaroo economics to compare using gdp per capita but hell , eu should at least take some economical parameters into account when granting membership . 
  just sayin ' , 
  the 2004 and onward expansions were already big mistakes . 
  turkey pretends to want to be a member of eu and eu pretends to give it a chance . 
  no way in hell would turkey ever be an eu member even everything was peachy creamy in turkey . 
  just these 2 reasons : * eu does n't want to border world 's most unstable countries : iraq , syria , iran , armenia and georgia . 
  also the border control would be plain impossible . 
  * turkey is 80 million people . 
  if it enters eu it will probably be the 2nd biggest member in europarl . 
  nobody in their right mind will give turkey this power . 
  honestly terraforming mars is easier than turkey 's eu membership . 
  [ finland !,

  i went to bulgaria once , it was like city 17 . lovely , 
  protesting and terrorism ... there is a difference ; and greenpeace did n't care to learn that . 
  from one flatland to another  ( bicycles yey ! ), 
  then the question begs , why the fuck did you let 'em in eu ? 
  turkey vs bulgaria the great war of mustaches into the glory ride !, 
  * [ twists his mustache ] *, 
  what i got from this map : fossil fuels still big money big !, 
  you see turks , the west also does this ; so it must be normal !, 
  there are d\u0131fferent limits for autobahns , inter city roads and dual carriageways, 
  no such hope here , all is spent . 
  only despair and apathy to battle it . 
   i really feel for all the secular and democratic turks that have to live under such goverment . 
  be strong and hopeful !, 
  ye good ol' \u00e6gean shenanigans making a comeback ? 
  germany is the japan of europe ^ ^ maximvm ^ ^ perversvm !, 
  in turkey godzilla may very well come to power for all i know . 
  it 's super hard to have stable predictions in this chaotic country . 
  ps : if godzilla declares its candidacy i am definitely voting for him . 
  their illusion will have a rude awakening when a soon coming financial crisis hits . 
  then i 'll see how their devotion to tayyip is . 
  wtf are they thinking ? 
  we have the # 1 economy with debt and concrete ?!!, 
  we have been 3/4 ths police state but now we will be 100 % police state . 
  yay !, 
  \u0131n turkey 120 km/h is for autobahns [ only ] ( http://www.kgm.gov.tr/sayfalar/kgm/sitetr/trafik/hizsinirlari.aspx ) . 
  fyi :p, 
  giz some !, 
  yeah , sure ... top level journalism right up there with funky space lizard conspiracy , spiegel . 
  they do ... it 's now called [ emoji ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/emoji ), 
  if you 're sensitive or at least ** starting ** to feel a wee bit sensitive about stuff like this i think you should give linux a try . 
  and please do n't complain that `` but there is no program x in linux | | i dont like the alternative '' , youse motherfuckers . 
  because you do n't complain when you start using osx . 
  do n't be a bitch . 
  i know that most of you do n't even use that many windows only programs like cad , circuit design and whatnot . 
  you mostly use a browser ( for facebook and shit ) , occasionally open word and excel files and watch videos . 
  you can easily do all of that in linux ... and you wo n't be somebody else 's bitch . 
  like ibm once said : think !, 
  think you fuck !, 
  what one needs to understand about turkey and land is one thing : wwi the empire lost tremendous amount of land . 
  what little we could save ( [ after returning from the verge of becoming various colonies to the allieds ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/81/sevresottoman1927.jpg ) ) became turkey . 
  the trauma of the land loss is still very much alive within the mindset of turks . 
  and i also do n't see anyone else lining up to give land . 
  who just gives land ? 
  spain gives to basques ? 
  russia to chechens ? 
  uk to irish ? 
  usa to mexicans ( new mexico , california ) ? 
  there is no such world , not the world we live in . 
  you either luck into one ( like those small island nations ) or you carve one out . 
  what is this nos.nl ? 
  how reliable is it ? 
  size does matter turkey stronk !, 
  ^ ^ muh ^ ^ military, 
  yea it 's not easy being turkey . 
  always at the crossroads of shit, 
  i 'd take the hostility of greece than the fraternity of the east ... on any ducking given day !, 
  yeah , but that mountain is magic . 
  basques , the kurds of spain, 
  ok we get it ## schland stronk, 
  it must be a bitch to pass the entire country through the gibraltar strait . 
  you have to flip it and pass ever so slowly , so you do n't scratch spain or morocco . 
  defense , the ultimate ~ ~ pork ~ ~ totally halal meat barrel, 
  vw has been selling crazy in turkey , too . 
  despite the horrible fucking piece of shit distributor ( * do\u011fu\u015f otomotiv * ), 
  rats . 
  but we also have a squad of cats ... so the battle rages on, 
  turkey wants to drink rak\u0131 ... but can not afford . 
  instead drinks one of the worst pilseners known to mankind ... * efes pilsen * it 's a sad day,
