   lost 2 million 350.000 of them were the turks your commie party exiled in 1989 .

  literally * [ lord of war ] ( http://www.impawards.com/2005/lord_of_war_ver2_xlg.html ) * ( call nic cage ! ), 
  that would be varoufakis with his satin armor ... maybe he bestowed the same upon him,

  exterminate all rational thought, 
  i can feel your pain, 
  when i was let frolicking in europe , i felt like these were the ones needed the most clarification : * istanbul is not the capital of turkey . 
  it 's ankara !, 
  * we have four seasons . 
  we have really hot and really cold places . 
  turkey is a big ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ stronk country !, 
  ( 783.562 km ^ ^ 2 ) * we have railways . 
  * we have ^ ^ pretty ^ ^ good autobahns * stuff in turkey ai n't that cheap ( cars , meat , books , benzin , booze etc. ) . 
  * we do n't take kindly to stale turkey jokes, 
  * greenland * now , that 's a land i have n't heard for a long time,

  remember when the west was lubing erdogan ? 
  oh you do n't ?!, 
  [ i 'll just leave this here ] ( http://www.akparti.org.tr/upload/images/erdogantime1.jpg ) . 
  we should just confederate the country . 
  at least the aegean and thracian parts . 
  ankara is pretty fucking okay . 
  it 's too late for istanbul but if this can stop the domestic immigration to thrace it 'd be fanfuckingtastic . 
  30 % is the maximum they can get methinks . 
   sort of people who should never be allowed to be police officers . 
  how ironic is that the police is more than often that kind of people . 
  remember the bully and the meathead from your high school ? 
  they 're cops now . 
  ( do n't visit your hometown ), 
  also horse carts are ecological , 
  turkey = mordor but with kurds & arabs, 
  it does n't take much to guess that this was taken in the great city of c\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0435\u043d  in turkey the roma help the recycling ( also with horse carts or three wheeled small pickups or motorcycles with sidecars . 
  rich ones have small sized lorries ) . 
  we throw all our rubbish mixed and they pick out the nice stuff like bottles , aluminum , glass etc. 
  they also steal here and there but we turn a blind eye and count it as their service fee :d after all it 's nothing next to what erdogan and his cronies steal .

  you 're either america 's bitch or russia 's . 
  i dont know if there are any china 's bitches though .

  [ here be an example ] ( https://i.imgur.com/jtpdj.jpg ) . 
  why is this news ? 
  because she was about to be famous for 15 minutes ? 
  kurds kill hundreds of kurdish women every year in kurd heavy regions of turkey . 
  ai n't no news . 
   that stuff is barely socially acceptable here . 
  it 's really acceptable if only you can afford the time or find a road that ai n't too steep and fuming with exhaust gases . 
  it ai n't the beer & spirits ... it 's the fucking sidedishes that are the root evil !, 
  \u0131 know why turkey \u0131s fat as sh\u0131t . 
  because of these fatass [ * teyze * s ] ( http://meram.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/naciye-teyze.jpg ) ( smth l\u0131ke a \u0431\u0430\u0301\u0431\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0430 ) .
