  akp came to power and still rules to this very day . 
  oppressing gradually every day . 
  probably never to go . 
   akp is dreaming of neo-ottoman empire no . 
  that 's what they sell to stupid masses . 
  all they dream of is more money lining their pockets . 
  and then some more monies . 
  i think erdogan is so under the radar and pathetic , no one outside of turkey gives a fuck about him or his bullshit . 
  he 's sorta like kaddafi ; he says some bullshit | people laugh | everyone moves on, 
  here is our weekly entertainment from our islamist megalomaniac . 
  i hope we are all having fun :d, 
  i 'll just open a six pack and cuss at the tv ... with such joy !, 
  time will come erdogan , fethullah and their cronies will be brought to account . 
  they stepped on a lot of toes since 2002 . 
  * [ $ militarism intensifies ] *, 
  smashing !, 
  yes . 
  that will only increase contraband . 
  altay mbt ... soon ( just came from a job interview in otokar - the manufacturer ), 
  and binds us in darkness, 
  i wonder what if i do the same joke in greece ? 
  gon na try . 
  brb . 
  so cute, 
  you got ta split into 2 : - rich west side : weu - poor east side ( finally with turkey . 
  oh the mirth !, 
  ) : eeu a.k.a poor man 's eu, 
  all i know about them is those fuckers are large !, 
  tall and wide . 
  the fuck do they eat there ? 
  i fak like a beast, 
  can not into eu !, 
  remove !, 
  barbar turk !, 
   it 's not as bad as it looks like . 
  the guy behind you keeps pushing you into the bus and you push the guy in front of you . 
  it 's like a river . 
  the flow eventually makes it to the bus . 
  so you behave like you are a gas molecule in a spray can  good chemistry simulation ^ ^ ^ hue, 
  some buses even have 220v power outlets at every window seat . 
  i was like `` get outta heeere ! '', 
  at first but they do work . 
  for the hordeeee !, 
  romanian tourism board proudly presented, 
  i dont think they will let turkey in eea . 
  for we can flood the eu market with our - say - good quality and cheaper fruits and veggies . 
  then you will have your greece , spain and whatnot with pitchforks . 
  wont work . 
  it makes our economy more import dependent ( from eu of course ) . 
  for * example * we ca n't incentivize domestic car manufacturing . 
  because we ca n't tax domestic and import cars differently . 
  so good luck trying to sell your domestic brand against automotive giants . 
  there are other `` bad things '' in the agreement , such as having to pay more for - say - japanese imports because they ai n't from eu . 
  customs union is baaaad for us ( * mmmkay ? * ) . 
  the decision taken to put turkey into customs union in 1996 was possibly the lamest move ever . 
  it 's like being in a club where you have absolutely no fucking say whatsoever . 
  retarded, 
  right in the cyberpunk !, 
  choo choo motherfucker !, 
  in turkey the local layout ( f klavye ) is used by a fraction of computer users . 
  1 % would be an optimistic guess . 
  \u0131t , s not a bug \u0131t , s a feature !, 
   quite lucrative there is no toll . 
  istanbul is beautiful only from afar/when you 're a tourist . 
  when you go into it or cross it ... alas !, 
  your cuss word vocabulary increases exponentially . 
  i have to cross one of them bridges to reach izmit in the morning . . in the rush hour !, 
  do you know the meaning of [ pain ] ( https://i.imgur.com/a5bshvc.jpg ) ? 
  well , do ya tourist ? 
  we just need to fuck eachother till a point where everyone is more or less the same . 
   balkanian turk genes kebab is kebab, 
  we do n't generally have a problem ( i mean , ignore 'em as much as possible ) with the homeless or the beggars much but with the paint-thinner ( * tinerci * ) users . 
  they can stab you for a lira . 
  i agree with the frenchman . 
  the map coloring is a bit confusing . 
  and probably $ 1.000 to cross it . 
  where else are you gon na take a shit ? 
  having internet connection is more important . 
  really . 
  you can dig a well or drill for water but if you do n't have connection you do not have connection . 
  also the pen\u0131s has \u0131ts own groove at the t\u0131p called urethral meatus  \u0131.e \u0131t comes r\u0131fled for your a\u0131m\u0131ng pleasure, 
  make more street ur\u0131nals mayhap ? 
  ah the good ol' * bah\u015fi\u015f * system :d, 
  keep on truck\u0131ng on free w\u0131f\u0131 then \u00af \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  they also go apesh\u0131t for those chocolate ch\u0131p spr\u0131nkle stuff, 
  while the american surely can not hide behind a shrub the romanian can even hunt a gazelle therefrom , 
  also antibiotics and whatnot , 
  goddamn mcdonalds , 
  i hope in the near future a prospective turkish gvmnt withdraws turkey 's eu candidacy once and for all , so these `` and this country wants to join the eu '' parrots will shut the fuck up . 
  anyone with a brain in turkey knows that it 's impossible for turkey to be in eu -- even if turkey had the gdp per capita of goddamn luxembourg and human rights & democracy of scandinavia . 
  we have to thank that monster . 
  now even my grandma is a network engineer . 
  i use 3 different vpn services . 
  turkey is a funny country if you 're not the citizen of it/live there . 
  i hope at least you 're having fun :3, 
  aww shit ... you 're 100 % correct . 
  i never actually thought about this . 
  my generation ( born bween 1980-90 ) actually was exposed the most to globalism ( mostly stuff over the atlantic ) . 
  and when i say my generation i also include people my age group from the deepest and most conservatist corners of anatolia . 
  tv reached everywhere .
