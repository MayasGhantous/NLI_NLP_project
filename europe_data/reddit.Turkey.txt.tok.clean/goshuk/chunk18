  there was an explosion of private tv channels after 1990 . no content was diluted or censored till about 2000s . 
  shit was raw  we also experienced this `` new thing '' called internet at its rawest form . 
  so i do n't think this generations bigots can be - say - as wahhabi as they could . 
  but the next generation ... fucking hell . 
  light the country on fire and run away !, 
  i dont think i will give much thought to al-monitor . 
  why ? 
  because : http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/contents/authors/rasim-ozan-kutahyali.html http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/contents/authors/mustafa-akyol.html one diehard [ tayyibist ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/recep_tayyip_erdo%c4%9fan ) another 1/2 tayyip 1/2 [ fetoist ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fethullah_g%c3%bclen ) . 
  i mean , rasim motherfucking troll ozan k\u00fctahyal\u0131 !, 
  seriously ?!, 
   i wonder why it costs so much compared to other passports the first rule of business : you fuck as much as possible not how much it costs + reasonable profit, 
  that sounds safe, 
  it 's only logical , 
  we should have taken the entire damn island . 
  would have been far fewer problems . 
  ate the embargo anyhoo :d, 
  100 % baris manco, 
  apart from the language and lack of sunshine i do n't see much difference than any other ex-commie eastern european country . 
  just more half-life 2, 
  erdogan ( or tayyip as we call that bastard ) came with a major crisis and i wager that he 'll go with even a bigger crisis, 
  gib gigabit internet pl0x :3, 
  i agree . 
  this is flat out insult and i fail to see even a wee bit of a spark of humour about this `` satire '' . 
  `` hahhaa erdo you fuck pigs hahah how funny '' [ here ] ( http://d.sansursuzhaber.com/news/74086.jpg ) is an example of a funny one . 
  [ romania reigns supreme !, 
  ] ( http://i100.independent.co.uk/image/15767-1os5rl4.jpg ) i do n't care for the rest of the charts , 
  classic * kurabiye tayyip * ( cookie tayyip - he hates this insult the most ), 
  no problem, 
  it 's not about being alone or becoming a `` playboy '' or some other thing . 
  it 's more like `` i 've hit 25 and holy shit i have to marry right away '' and many people here do exactly that, 
  in turkey it 's almost `` you must marry '' . 
  there is 50 bars of pressure . 
  your fucking colleagues , friends , neighbours , family ... they all try to scare you and make you feel like a piece of shit if you do not . 
  do your military service , get a 8-to-6 job , marry , make children and then die with a life wasted . 
  there are also economic reasons . 
  marriage means financial stability ( mostly for women ), 
  i am actually surprised that it had n't got leaked before . 
  since we 're a nepotic country the people responsible for the database are probably not really skilled . 
  only makes sense , 
  eu does n't really care about turkey 's political internals . 
  as long as we import form them it 's all a-okay . 
  most companies here ( incl . 
  the one i work for ) are heavily dependent on eu imports . 
  all in all it 's about money . 
  if the eu really wanted this excuse for humanity tayyip to go they could have supported another party ... with ( you guessed it ) more money . 
  most possibly it is, 
  i cry everytiem, 
  our flag is basically soaked in blood and gore . 
  so it 's only natural that our anthem is metal as fuck : *** i have been free since the beginning and forever shall be so . 
  what madman shall put me in chains !, 
  i defy the very idea !, 
  i 'm like the roaring flood ; trampling and overflowing my stream bed , *** i 'll tear apart the mountains , fill up the vastness and still gush out !, 
  *** * ( scream vocals ) * *** the horizons of the west may be surrounded with walls of steel , but my borders are guarded by the mighty bosom of a believer . 
  let it howl , be not afraid !, 
  and think : how can this fiery faith ever be killed , by that battered , single-fanged beast you call ` civilization ' ? 
  * ( brutal vocals and chorus ) * *** my friend !, 
  leave not my homeland to the hands of villainous men !, 
  *** render your chest as armor and your body a trench !, 
  *** halt this disgraceful assault !, 
  for soon shall come the joyous days of divine promise ... who knows ? 
  perhaps tomorrow ? 
  perhaps even nigher !, 
  * ( electroguitar solo ) * *** for only then , shall my fatigued tombstone , if there is one , prostrate a thousand times in ecstasy , *** and tears of fiery blood shall flow out of my every wound *** , *** and my lifeless body shall gush out from the earth like an eternal spirit *** , perhaps only then , shall i peacefully ascend and at long last reach the heavens . 
  * ( as a choir ) *, 
  ya jelly ? 
  ermmm , evil illuminati lizard people ? 
  do i need say more ? 
  romania kicks ass in internet bandwidth ... so it is a huge difference , 
  funny guy, 
  that 's press/media pretty much everywhere, 
  danes are super content with them, 
   no more elections ? 
   rigged elections all the way baby . 
  that 's the style . 
  turkey does deserve erdogan . 
   at this point , i do n't understand why eu keep their carrot-on-a-stick policy . 
  to introduce eu policies to turkey , maybe . 
  most of them are good ( higher quality standards , health inspections etc. ), 
  i would guess . 
  sorry but nobody here gives two shits about eu anymore ( rightly so , after long years of media and political bullshit . 
  especially in mid-90 's ) . 
  it 's only here in glorious / r/europe this topic comes up often . 
  whatsapp is disgustingly popular here . 
  the gsm operators have been fucking us with exorbitant sms prices . 
  so it comes as no surprise . 
  * side note : mms is still very expensive . 
  turkey demands sacrifice !, 
  ( lamb maybe ? ), 
  whichever one helps you bring in more money, 
  absolutely . 
  i remember the cunts on bbc , cnn , al-jazeera etc. 
  praising erdogan non-stop ... for his `` conservative yet democratic strong economy country which was a template to the rest of the shitholes in the middle east '', 
  dat gradient, 
  so [ vodka ] ( http://www.lcbo.com/content/dam/lcbo/products/181636.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280.jpeg ), 
  it was like this in pre-erdogan era , too . 
  the head of his previous party ( refah partisi ) n. erbakan also sued a lot of weekly/monthly humour magazines . 
  it 's the mentality of these islamist assholes . 
  but first : he finds a severed horse head on his bed , 
   please someone attempt a coup d'etat over there or something that 's usa 's job . 
  see : 1980 coup ( * `` our boys have done it * '' ),
