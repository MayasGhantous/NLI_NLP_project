  atheism is not a modern `` invention '' . 
  i bet that there were humans who questioned their deity even back as far as 30.000 bc, 
  even if the cyprus and aegean disputes were somehow magically solved i do n't think the western europeans would be okay letting turkey be # 2 voting power in their precious ec and eu border some of the most shithole and unstable countries in the world . 
  i have no idea why the fuck turkey had even applied for candidacy in the first place and the eu had not said a clear no . 
  politics a true bullshit game . 
  maybe that 's why . 
  motherfuckers exhausted the latin alphabet,

  where the world is run by corporations this becomes nothing but the norm naturally, 
  honorable ment\u0131on, 
  this is a really successful terrorist attack . 
  which in turn means that the state of turkey is incompetent as fuck to even guard its top important places . 
  the place of the explosion [ is really central ] ( http://imgur.com/to9h7sf ) . 
  there are these buildings nearby : * army * military court of cassation * supreme court * the ministry of finance * national defense department * ministry of justice * environment and urban ministry * ministry of interior * turkish grand national assembly and slightly ahead there are germany embassy , the us embassy etc. 
  why indeed,

  i used to dread the shower rooms in factories ( n. europe ) at first : no curtains in the booths , old men walking and talking with their ballsacks making simple harmonic motion etc.
