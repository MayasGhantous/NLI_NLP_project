  he has no supernatural powers . 
  even if he had no turk would believe him . 
  he has the power of complaining . 
  if we listened to him we would have been in stars by now .

  you wish , 
  yeah , son !, 
   culture and tradition . 
  what 's your unified european culture and tradition ? 
  enlighten me , please . 
  not being a turk , apparently . 
  http://www.anusedcar.com/index.php/tuv-report-year-age/2013-2-3/309 definitely vw golf according to this reliability index . 
  lebanon is most possibly fucked . 
  shit son !, 
  now tayyip is gon na get ideas to abuse already shitty internet connections . 
  it 's surprising that it lasted this long especially in the last decade where digitalization killed many printed media . 
  there is also the azerbaijan , armenia , georgia and frigging kazakhstan ( which borders ** china ** ) quadro that is considered european but not turkey . 
  geography much ?!, 
  oh but it 's okay ... they 're culturally european ( ! ), 
  i think the current passports of eu ( and some other non-eu countries like turkey , russia & c. ) really has a nice standard . 
  some have * passport * and the * country name * written in the native language only ( greece , germany , denmark & c. ) which i think all passports should be like this . 
  i mean , for crying out loud what could be on the cover that says other than passport/country name/european union ? 
  my 100 mbps wept, 
  thanks for the chip advice . 
  i 'll delve deeper if i ever get a bike that 's worth putting one in . 
  there are probably more bikes stolen than the total number of people in denmark . 
  that means people are buying them . 
  otherwise the theft numbers would go down . 
  it 's like the auto stereo theft bonanza before 2000s . 
  if i ever buy a bike more than 1000 kroner i will actually bother to hide a gps module in it . 
  i 'm that pissed . 
  i 'd take 10000 times more overhead cables than to have a crappy and expensive connection ... any day !, 
  do n't them lucky romanians have 1 gbps connections for really good prices already ? 
  ( i 'm really jelly ), 
  that you ? 
  it 's always my bicycle that got stolen in public parkings :( ^ fuck ^ my ^ luck once in fisketorvet , once in n\u00f8rrebro , once in dr byen metro st. , once in \u00f8lby st. and once they stole my back tire and some accessories because they did n't bother with the folding lock . 
  at the end i started using a super cheap and really disgusting looking rusty bicycle . 
  that got stolen , too, 
  do n't waste your breath . 
  him and hundreds like him on this subreddit will blame turkey for everything including their lost socks . 
  you really did n't need to wait all those years to understand what erdogan and his party was . 
  he was a direct disciple of fethullah gulen whom is a cleric who has mafia type organisation that leaked within every turkish institutions . 
  gulen is in turn one of cia 's own dogs . 
  fed in 1980s in green belt programme to stand against soviets . 
  every rightminded person in turkey knows that the eu en devour is plain sham . 
  of course this does n't keep the politicians from using it for votes though . 
  a privileged partnership deal was the way to go but the turkish politicians repeatedly refused it while shouting `` eu or naught '' and collecting votes . 
  even if by some cosmic chance turkey fulfilled all the criteria it still would n't be let in . 
  cyprus will veto , armenian lobbies will use whatever power they have to force a veto ( e.g. 
  france ) , greece will also veto because of the aegean dispute . 
  no way no how will turkey ever relinquish any territorial waters or land . 
  i mean the 75 million population of turkey not the 10 million diaspora . 
  please . 
  as if eu would ever let the turks to walk on the streets of europe even if they fulfilled all the criteria . 
  i think at this point even the deaf sultan in timbuktu knows that the turkish president is batshit insane and youtube-banningly despot . 
  too much health ai n't good for your health,

  i think what he means is that they failed to capitalize on the trend . 
  sure nokia had smartphones ( also pdas iirc ) long before apple . 
  there were other manufacturers as well ( palm , casio etc. ), 
  but none rose to the occasion .

  other than that , fuck all . 
  ( it 's not even a fun fact . 
  it 's a sad fact ), 
  oh yes , i meant road density ( apparently  ) . 
  belgium is # 3 on that classification . 
  if one goes by `` road length per capita '' then it 's canada because few people/long road network , 
  is n't belgium # 1 in road length per capita in europe ? 
  ( the roadiest place ), 
  print moarrr money !, 
  have you been to the ghettos where turks ( and kurds ) live ? 
  he is right but turkey was n't giving and does n't give two shits about human rights of its citizens and it only went downhill when islamists came into power in 2002 . turkey 's eu candidacy was a sham from the beginning . 
  no way no how eu will ever let turkey in even if the country is on the level with japan , switzerland etc. 
  despite this the sham continues . 
  anyone with a little bit of brain in turkey is well aware of this . 
  eu letting in far worse countries was just the last straw . 
  the [ acquis chapters ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/accession_of_turkey_to_the_european_union#negotiation_progress ) should be taken as a road map for turkey and they should be fulfilled regardless of eu . 
  otherwise there is no other good direction , it 's only a shit filled bog with the middleeast and russia . 
  i believe if turkey actually fulfilled all those criteria it would n't need any eu . 
  it 's pretty self reliant country if utilized correctly . 
  it has pretty much everything naturally . 
  i think the danish central bank just was bored out of its ass and threw some of that delicious tax money around for redesigning . 
  that 's how shit is usually done in denmark . 
  but the necessary public stuff like nemid or rejsekort etc. 
  are botched or born dead from the beginning . 
  just throw more money at it .
