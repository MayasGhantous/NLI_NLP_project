  arresting swiftly and disrupting communications, 
  but the economy is so fucking great ? 
  ^ ^ ^ guys ... 
  shit 's real here , son !, 
  the corporation i work for brings in foreign nationals from other branches and those poor bastards are instructed not to leave their hotel . 
  they swing between workplace and hotel ... all day ... for at least a month ... then the circle beings again . 
  lovely country , eh ? 
  it 's becoming a thing in turkey ... and that 's a good thing . 
  people need to party in this shitty political climate that we 're in . 
  in yesterday 's party i dressed up as * the dude * from * the big lebowski * . 
  everyone though i was a homeless . 
  man !, 
  am i getting old but of course , if you ask the erdogan 's people it 's absolutely haram !, 
  ps : we do n't have the * kids ringing the door * thing . 
  they already do it in * ramazan bayram\u0131 * . 
  no double candy for you , brat !, 
  now , get off muh lawn !, 
  greeks ought to think thrice before making any attempts :d, 
  though i am your typical run of the mill turkish redneck ... what he shits out of his mouth is flat out fucking stupid . 
  ( adding to the really high * quality * discussion here ), 
  while we 're on the topic : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84awtseb2-4, 
  opting out of dst was the sane choice but the idiots should have opted out while we were in gmt +2 not +3 damn you erdogan, 
  i hate buses, 
  * just adding more fuel to the fire * the name lahmacun undeniably comes from arabic . 
  booom . 
  now fight harder !, 
  does armenia really exist i wonder . 
  maybe it 's just the materialization of armenian genocide 's lamentations, 
  we do ? 
  i do n't know any jokes about greeks, 
  tone down that hdr , son . 
  me eyes are bleedin ', 
   adiabatic i 've learnt a new word today !, 
  _ i shall use it tomorrow at work immediately ! _, 
  fucking finally !, 
  too bad that turkey will lag behind as the gvmnt of tayyip taxes every milliliter of engine volume . 
  people are driving ridiculous micro-diesel cars here with the most expensive diesel price in the world ( * read it like clarkson * ) . 
  that 's true ... but we need to specify a bit more . 
  because just comparing one large and one small engine is n't sufficient . 
  we call it `` engine and chassis compatibility '' in turkey . 
  what i mean is : if you put a 1.0 litre 3 cylinder engine to a * vw up !, 
  * , that is fine but if you put 1.4 litre 4 cylinder to a * vw passat * , that ai n't so fine, 
  bulgaria and romania managed to get in the club but not to party ... to get the deposit from the beer bottles :p they are scanning for any empty bottle, 
  greeks did n't have good scm ( supply chain management ) stretching out further inland could mean serious logistical issues w/o proper planning ... combine this with incomplete knowledge of geography you 'll even have hard time finding potable water sources . 
  so think thrice before invading , 
   move in move out ? 
  need to visit the manufacturing plant . 
  see that poles ai n't slacking off , 
  i come from the salt mines . 
  so \u0141\u00f3d\u017a ai n't got shit on me . 
   jeba\u0106 szwab\u00d3w , b\u00d3g honor ojczyzna i would scream those if only i could pronounce . 
  i mean \u0141\u00f3d\u017a is pronounced smth like `` wuudj '' afaik . 
  i will be visiting \u0141\u00f3d\u017a soon for business reasons ( no pleasure ) will wield a kebab knife ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ shingggggg . 
  either take up arms or a vpn service . 
  we 've been abiding with the latter so far . 
  just another day in turkey, 
  then the state ought to cough up the prostitute money !, 
  you heard that erdogan you wanker ?!, 
  finally , some fucking sense, 
  waddafuck is going on for i have no idea, 
  wow, 
  this ai n't dark humour . 
  it 's flat out shit posting, 
   7 154 000 residents subtract the number of turks with bulgarian citizenship who live in turkey . 
  you actually have fewer people, 
  even my aunt has a moustache !, 
  turk with fez ... oh , such classics !, 
  bring me the head of the lithuanian president !, 
  if you like food ... just do n't go north . 
  just do n't . 
  since it does n't affect their lives in germany , they vote for people with big lies . 
  turkey ought to revoke their turkish citizenships . 
  millions of them come here and vote for akp ( while voting for the greens and leftists in germany . 
  i do n't want an asshole that comes here once or twice a year for vacation and have a say about the future of turkey . 
  then they could have done a booze pipeline ... * straight to the tap *, 
  turks & kurds ( blue collars or just mooching off of unemployment benefits ) in europe are just the fucking worst . 
  they cuss at their current country ( let 's say germany ) but keep staying there ; they vote leftist parties there but right wing assholes in turkey ; they live in ghettos without any will to interact with other people and when they visit turkey they condescend on us and boast about how fucking awesome europe is . 
  fuck those people . 
  i 'm glad that they live where they are ... far from us . 
  while i was touring some western countries , when there is a cuntish behaviour it 's either an arab , afghan , turk or kurd . 
  ogling girls , talking loud in metro , shouting in public , fighting , spitting like a llama in bus stop , revving the engine at red light etc. 
  what i do n't `` get '' is : how the fuck do they all now hate gulen and his followers all of a `` suddden '' ?!, 
  erdogan was butt buddies with gulen and his men . 
  fish brained people conveniently forget this . 
  erdogan and his cronies are just as guilty . 
  i hope the day will come we 'll all rid of any islam connected cunts . 
  they 're the reason turkey is a shithole . 
  kurds 'n' syrians, 
  gebze is actually mordor itself, 
  with a racer motorcycle , 
  just how fucking much can istanbul grow anymore ?!, 
  it 's already 15 million . 
  there seems to be no end in sight . 
  soon enough parts of tekirdag and kocaeli provinces will be counted as istanbul . 
  even indonesia ? 
  wtf, 
  how does one distribute electricity and water to myriad of islands ? 
  i hate all graffiti equally, 
  disgusting graffiti, 
  kek,
