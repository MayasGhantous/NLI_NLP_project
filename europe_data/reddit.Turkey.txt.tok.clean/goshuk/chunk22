  or they 're good at keeping statistics, 
  he really enjoys being a king . 
  pkk , the lovebirds and butterflies of the umpteenth degree with such progressive views and respect for human rights ( according to every neckbeard here in reddit ), 
   give numbers/stats/graphs or go home . 
  do your own research, 
  it runs on lies , manipulated financial indicators , real estate bubble and high taxes . 
  we all wonder when this gravy train will come to a stop and have a good ol' financial crisis like the one back in [ 2001 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_turkish_economic_crisis ) . 
  it was a joke which you sorely missed, 
  what fucking privacy ? 
  facebook ( owner of whatsapp ) mines your text data and sells it to ad corporations . 
  maybe they even have a wank or two looking at your girlfriend 's sexts . 
   there are more vw diesel owners in europe by orders of magnitude ( i know none of you consider us a european country but ) turkey is full of them . 
  our lovely state made the tax laws and fuel tax just so that people were herded to buy microdiesels . 
  ai n't got shit on this one : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2un7bq/building_under_topdown_construction_in_sofia/, 
   is it good quality ? 
  quality is relative :p for its price , yes it 's . 
  but you used to have jubilees every 49 years . 
  now that seems to be gone  \\ #makedebtgreatagain, 
  99 % of my wardrobe is lcw . 
  can confirm . 
  this info-graphic is precise , 
  especially if you visit on holidays ( like easter ), 
   `` the german language is so harsh lololo '' he who claims that has not heard danish or dutch :d, 
  at least you 're not bulgaria :d hue, 
  i 'm quite okay with those . 
  however the ignorance slightly saddens me : - that we use arabic script - that we have camels roaming everywhere - the entire country is one big desert - everyone in burqas christ , man !, 
  many of europeans at least once visited turkey for vacation but still ? 
  i 'm yet to see a fellow human to refer germany in central europe !, 
  it 's in the western europe . 
  the ventilator !, 
  if my aunt had a moustache she would be my uncle, 
  sexiest language for car reviews though , 
  okay boys !, 
  #open the gates !, 
  classic tayyip the guy spins so much so fast that if you stand near by , you might get tuberculosis . 
  '' [ my bruh assad !, 
  you motherfucker you ! '', 
  all in all he is a typical politician . 
  that is to say , vilest scum of the earth . 
   cut the crab !, 
  no crabs left . 
  gim me some lobsters, 
  i think that 's a flawed theory ... like the completely wrong theory of how money came to existence . 
  if ** i ** know that my money will be worth more next month i will actually be still spending the same but buying more quality items . 
  the problem with turkey is that the levels of prosperity are not homogeneously distributed throughout the country ( and it 's quite large in land area ) . 
  places like thrace , \u00e6gean and marmara regions are quite well developed and will put some eu countries like romania , bulgaria , croatia , slovakia etc. 
  to shame . 
  however just drive 200 km to east from istanbul and the disparity becomes apparent . 
  [ i also get quite pumped up when playing that game ] ( http://i.imgur.com/slj1i96.jpg ), 
   the passengers said they were surprised about the young age of the driver , but it did not stop them from entering the bus . 
  got ta get to work !, 
  really well points . 
  also i might add that even turkey 's candidacy has been going on since the dawn of men , i do n't think anyone in their right mind in turkey thinks there is any chance of us ever joining in eu . 
  \u0131f goddamn armen\u0131a , cyprus , malta and azerbaijan are then sure as sh\u0131t \u0131t \u0131s . 
  geographically speaking . 
  and the last t\u0131me \u0131 checked europe was a cont\u0131nent . 
  same shit in turkey ... guess what else these two shitholes share ? 
  * vote for the left wing parties in germany ( or w. europe in general ) but vote for the totalitarian right wing parties in turkey * enjoy the freedom in germany ; want an authoritarian turkey * obey the traffic rules in germany but become a total asshole in traffic in turkey * `` you know the fine is this much $ if you litter in germany ? 
  '' ... then proceeds to litter and spit in turkey * talk shit about germany while germany and talk shit about turkey while in turkey got ta love them turks ( and kurds ) in germany !, 
  * i 'm sure there is a special corner reserved for them in hell *, 
  how low can a country stoop, 
   more like it is n't more like , it 's exactly that . 
   i wish eu politicians focused more on actually making the project work than `` making the project '' . 
  $ was very cool back in 2000 . i mean the convenience of a unified currency, 
  oh no first comes the british , russians and germans ( in that order ), 
  they should also force some kind of implementation of [ p3p ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/p3p ), 
   vw ** crap ** heretic !, 
  he sounds like the gif guy , who appeared after 20 or so years to tell people how it 's pronounced . 
  jeez, 
  a lot of people just call the bridges by their chronological order ( 1st , 2nd , 3rd bridge ) bogazici is okay but the 2nd and 3rd ones are a mouthful ( fatih sultan mehmet koprusu , yavuz sultan selim koprusu ), 
  turks were cosmically lucky to have a man like atat\u00fcrk . 
  man like him do n't come easy . 
  after his dead the majority of us fucked it all up ... real well . 
  there is no second coming of him . 
  we will try to abide with the shit we are in . 
  soon they 'll tell us what to think and what not to . 
  i 'll damn well please think whatever i would like to . 
  maybe the coup is staged by jihadist space lizards . 
   at least here you can live long enough to die of cancer from the cigarettes . 
  i ca n't say it does n't sound enticing, 
  at this price range you 're better off establishing your own tobacco farm ... which will be still cheaper !, 
  yeah but i am paid in pistachios and peanuts . 
  how ` bout that for parity ? 
  this is very gay ... like that one south park episode called * goobacks * ( the end scene ), 
  it is literally impossible to have an uneventful day here in turkey ; let alone a week * [ lights up an overpriced cigarette / looks in the horizon ] *, 
  there will be no ramifications . 
  erdogan will slide away scott-free, 
  ok it 's good news but i wonder the feasibility study for such a line . 
  i doubt there is substantial demand . 
  he might try to purge ex-anap , dyp ( right wing ) members from his party . 
  he would be the angry janitor there * `` goddammit !, 
  who shat in the urinal ?!, 
  fucking seculars and foreign powers !, 
  this is nothing . 
  slovakia and slovenia are complete another matter i 'm afraid, 
  hi mr steve ballmer !, 
   important to note , 58 % of erdogan supporters expect the economy will stay the same . 
   suuuure with 3 + million syrians and turkish lira plummeting . 
  paywalled, 
  i 'm sorry but what the heck can i do ?
