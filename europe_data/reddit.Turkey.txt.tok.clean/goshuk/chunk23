  we 're a minority against this tyrant . 
  25 % of the population tops ... and demonstrating is totally inefficient in turkey ( as we all saw in 2013 gezi park protests . 
  big nothing ), 
  probably . 
  but in turkey we also have these ridiculously large flags on masts , too ( they have to be replaced monthly . 
  * materials science bitch * ), 
  you know what the secret is ? 
  total apathy i do n't give a damn about anything happening in turkey . 
  not worth losing your sleep over anything . 
  let it all burn, 
  how does one summon an ambassador ? 
  do they have scrolls or spells for that ? 
  yes i do . 
  i also used to run my own . 
   greek baklava you traitor !, 
  i think he means frappe, 
  i 'll eat all your seafood and drink all your ouzo learning greek btw . 
  brb, 
  what 's the difference between a banana republic and a third world shithole ? 
  the fucker did it himself foreign state my ass, 
   most turks in ~ ~ germany ~ ~ europe ftfy the ones in usa are n't ( because mostly students and white collar ), 
  usa was behind the 1980 coup though . 
  quality not quantity, 
  faster than the fucking bus bruh, 
  * ok boys , build up them walls !, 
  how much does an engineer get there ? 
  * ( net , per month ) * here it 's about $ 1.200, 
   do you want to go to a country with 4 times your average wage ? 
  one needs to find a job first , 
  gib tips on burning pl0x, 
  but is erdogan really purging the * gulen related * teachers/education staff ? 
  that 's the question, 
  not to sound like an asshole but there are a shittonne of * s\u00f6zle\u015fmeli * ( contracted ) teachers waiting to be assigned as a state teacher staff -- albeit lower quality, 
  what next i wonder ? 
  we start killing sparrows because they eat the seeds ?!, 
  ( like mao ordered the chinese to do so ), 
  i kinda feel fortunate that i had finished my education before this tyrant came to power . 
  back then we were cussing at the turkish education system but my oh my , did it get much worse . 
  afaik tovar comes from * davar * ( flock of sheep/goats ) probably shepherds used to greet each other th\u0131s way ?!, 
  ( then commies ), 
  vpn would also do the job, 
  democracy is a bitch ( even with a wee bit of voter fraud ), 
   * night of the long ~ ~ scimitars ~ ~ kebab knives ftfy, 
  repent !, 
   i would like to expand my horizons we have such sights to show you !, 
  ^ ^ ^ pain ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ pleasure , ^ ^ ^ indivisible, 
  i mean * purge-wise *, 
  fireproof :p, 
  \u041d\u0414\u041a is a pretty good looking structure . 
  i did not get any commie vibes from it . 
  it does n't look * brutalist * maybe because it ai n't so . 
  saddam ai n't got shit on tayyip as it appears, 
  we 'll have to wait and see . 
  but if i know the most right wingers in turkey ... they will totally turn their back to him/akp without forgiveness . 
  money , money , money, 
  seems leg\u0131t, 
  those guns will be mostly used in road rages ... i can guarantee that, 
  euromonies well spent, 
  thanks kom\u015fu, 
  just send over some assassins but not like the ones who tried to off castro pl0x, 
  there was only wee bits of law was remained in turkey and now even that is totally gone . 
  choo choo sorry that was the democracy train, 
  and chocolate rains from the sky, 
   a tiny , assuredly unrepresentative slice of the turkish population very very tiny probably less than 1 % turks you see on reddit are most probably atheist , well educated , fluent in english , pro-west or just fucking neckbeards :p, 
  give the heli back i dont care about the coup staff :d, 
  and lizard people from outer space, 
  he came to power after the [ 2001 turkish financial crisis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_turkish_economic_crisis ) . 
  that is to say , he rode on the fear of the crisis . 
  people were also sick of coalitions before him ( his party came to power as a single one ; no coalition ) but at the end of they day , the majority of the turkish voter base is right wing , muslim , conservatist and dumb as fuck . 
  [ there was even a guy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cem_uzan ) in 2002 general elections who managed to get 7 % of the entire votes by giving away freebies ( like gratis d\u00f6ner ! ) . 
  so , all in all , with this voter base one will always see parties like akp . 
  nah they would have shot anyways just for shits and giggles, 
  i think that 's why this coup d'\u00e9tat was staged by none but erdogan himself anyway . 
  now if you dare speak against him you will be prosecuted as a * darbeci * ( pro-coup person ), 
  as is fucking tradition . 
  if not a real coup , at least the attempt . 
  do n't you think they 're a `` wee '' bit late ? 
  like 14 years ? 
  it 's a staged event i would wager, 
  my facebook wall : http://i.4cdn.org/pol/1468553023048.jpg, 
  do n't ya all already hate foreigners and bailed outta eu because of it ?

  i shall take my awesome touristmonies elsewhere . 
   between 70k and 100k fewer jobs in the ** financial services sector ** that 's actually good ^ ^ ^ jump ^ ^ ^ jump ^ ^ ^ jump, 
  willing to make anatolia an island if eu place to be guaranteed . 
  call us ( we also have tea and football ), 
  i would like to see the faces of those millions of dumbfucks who vote for akp after a major financial crisis explodes because of these 3 million or more so-called refugees . 
  no fucking brain anywhere to be found in this fucking country we already have a shittonne of kurds with * explosive * tendencies ... and now arabs . 
  oh yeah , party like there is no tomorrow baby, 
  there has been some incidents with soviet/russian nuclear arms in the past . 
  not to forget those ( * the man who saved the world * and * norwegian rocket incident * ) if the russians ever wipe us all off ... it 'll by a pathetic accident i would wager . 
  some fucking ancient firmware , incompatibility , faulty sensor data etc. 
  since on the topic of $ banknotes ... why the fuck do you have $ 500 ? 
  it 's a monstrous amount of cash to be carried by us poorfucks . 
  i also guess that in eu if you buy a car or house with cash it rings some bells somewhere . 
   who made raids as far as iceland and ireland .
