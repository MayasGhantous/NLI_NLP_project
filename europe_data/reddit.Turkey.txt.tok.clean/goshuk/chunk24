  * i am / u/goshuk , and i 'm here to ask you a question . 
  is a man not entitled to the bits of his internet connection ? 
  `` no , '' says the man in t\u00fcrk telekom , `` it belongs to arabs and tayyip '' *, 
  it 's an apple user ... so :p, 
  i have my lord humungus costume ready in case we go full on * mad max *  be still my dog of war . 
  i understand your pain . 
  we 've all lost someone we love . 
  but we do it my way !, 
  as is fucking tradition here, 
  let me tell you how our glorious dear leader tayyip will take corrective action : 1 - increase security at ataturk airport 2 - denounce terrorism ( hey , it 's gratis to do that ! ), 
  3 - temporary censors to social media and news outlets ... and then slow the already slow internet way the fuck down 4 - censor of all news about this incident 5 - forget after 2 fucking days, 
  must have been like the customs union accession of turkey . 
  it was a total showmanship and insane promises . 
  it was to be `` almost eu '' . 
  no one actually knew what it was and still do not know . 
  harsh, 
  now build a moat around the island !, 
  wait ... you already have one, 
  that 's bullshit and you know not what you speak . 
  eu was offering privileged partnership deals whereas turkish politicians were rejecting such deals and pushing for full eu membership . 
  actually this is the first time i am agreeing with this cunt . 
  turkey 's eu accession bid was super futile right from the start ( 1980s i suppose ) . 
  we should seek a privileged partnership deal . 
   shitting on the desk people do that ?!, 
  i like this guy 's videos quite a lot . 
  hehe his other videos about artificial intelligence are fucking great . 
  my friend got stabbed in istanbul back in 2004 ... with a fucking [ d\u00f6ner knife ] ( http://www.ruyatabiris.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/ruyada-doner-bicagi-gormek-1.jpg ) . 
  it was ** just because ** !, 
  he was minding his own business and just walking , then the assailant shoulders him . 
  he only manages to say `` hey !, 
  watc ... '' and then gets stabbed . 
  no reason . 
  just because !, 
  my point is : fuck istanbul . 
  there is a lot of random vile shit that can happen to one . 
  fucking hell , last time i was almost gon na get stabbed by a bunch of waifs over 1-2 liras . 
  anc\u0131ent rel\u0131g\u0131ons are cooler than these monotheistic shits, 
  fuck all kinds of taxes [ wuuuu anarchy :p ], 
  it 's eye fucking, 
  yes \u0131 meant the accommodation, 
  f\u0131rst off : http://lenachan.eu/b/src/1440280280279.jpg could n't care less . 
  people who work in turkish tourism industry are scum of the earth . 
  swindle , rip-off , ogle girls , overcharge me while the foreigners come for the half price, 
  crank up * where is my mind * ^ ^ ^ by ^ ^ ^ pixies, 
  gobble gobble motherfucker ! \u00a7, 
  - anything to declare ? 
  - yeah . 
  do n't go to arabia, 
  makes total sense, 
  as a southerner i 'll never get this . 
  do n't take the fucking bus you agoraphobic bastards, 
  he is buddies with egemen bagis . 
  just sayin ', 
   i vote for the liberal party . 
  ok . now there are literally dozens of us !, 
  dozens i say !, 
   they 're ultranationalists . 
  no they are n't . 
  ataka , dansk folkeparti , golden dawn , jobbik etc. 
  are ultranationalists . 
  they are basically akp with a slight nationalist sauce . 
  they 're just as much conservative and just as much religion exploiters . 
  you now see the shit that we have to put up every single fucking day ` ere ? 
  you only begin to see the international embarrassing batshit stupid shit that spits out ; domestic ones are thru the roof . 
  remember when we did n't used to be yet another middle eastern volatile shithole ? 
  * pepperidge farm remembers *, 
  poor opel ; _ ;, 
  it 's mostly arabs . 
  they have this tendency to `` jew this jew that '' success hurts, 
  the coca cola ceo is a turk afaik . 
  yes , these tayyip people ai n't so smart, 
   it is obvious that this is for internal consumption . 
  and they do consume it blindly, 
  i 've heard it 's like wild west ( or east in this case ), 
  you 're gravely wrong, 
  not to sound nationalistic but turkey again ... but this time somewhere on the warmer coastline , like the \u00e6gean ( izmir ) or mediterranean ( antalya ) . 
  even monopoly money looks better, 
  will not use ^ ^ ^ ^ :p, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gezi_park_protests that 's about the peaceful protests go, 
  maaan , are gerogians some cunts !, 
  first stalin then this tayyip, 
  according to the military : if a male fucks a male then the fucker ai n't gay . 
  but if you are the fuckee then you 're officially gay in the eyes of the military . 
  ( * we also have oil wrestling ... which is totally not gay :3 * ), 
  so war is good for replanning a better city ? 
  that 's called civilization :d, 
  ## trash for the trash god !, 
  i dont know why but i was expecting to see a `` kurwa ma\u0107 '' sign, 
  so is the 1980 coup of turkey . 
  * `` our boys have done it '' *, 
  you said it , son . 
  erdogan is a thug and his cronies are headless pussies . 
  but then again ... people who has been repeatedly voting for them ai n't much more ... so all in all , democracy ( with 10 % election threshold , mind you ) works quite alright i would say . 
  trail of tears madafaka, 
  why ? 
  i 'm quite alright not everyone is trying to flee * ps : i 'm quite sane when not on booze or drugs * , 
  for it 's all bullshit, 
  as if those peeps do n't breed like rabbits already, 
  as muh mustache weeps gently, 
  there is such thing called https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lights_out_ ( manufacturing ) however i do n't see ~ ~ ^ them ~ ~ adidas doing this for more complex products like shoes,
