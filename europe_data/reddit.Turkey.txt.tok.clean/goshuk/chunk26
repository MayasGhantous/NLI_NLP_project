  drop it while it 's hot, 
  i 'm older than lithuania fuck, 
  the entire eu should shun these charlatans and tugs of akp . 
  worthless pieces of shit thinking they own the country ( turkey ) can bully whoever they want . 
   reddit is virtually unknown in turkey and that 's really fucking fortunate !, 
   ** they let erdogan take power . 
  ** well , we are indeed fucked but youse elected trump . 
  good fucking luck . 
   muppet hehehe i love this insult word, 
   i was in montenegro or bulgaria . 
  never been in montenegro but in bulgaria the service sucks . 
  they still have the soviet mentality . 
  it will be yes no matter what . 
  there will be voting fraud . 
  wow , bummer ... the definition of the word _ bummer _, 
  heavy industry baby !, 
  i knooow , right ? 
  having epilepsy brb, 
  do this in turkey and you wo n't even get the final ad . 
  just the _ ` the making of ' _ video of people charging at each other , 
  it 's fortunate that the communists did not meddle w / this castle . 
  i would blame the films _ trainspotting _ and _ braveheart _, 
  luckiest of the balkans/yugoslavia, 
  same shit here , too . 
  why do you think ? 
  to get the entire island of course !, 
  are there any people left living in bulgaria ? 
  it 's sad but then again a sizeable amount of them became academic personnel because of nepotism . 
  then the thread should have been more carefully titled ffs, 
  just pour in more concrete tovarish !, 
  what is this thing you call _ hope _ ? 
  cheap, 
  turkey is wrong . 
  should have been vw . 
  i only saw the island afar from g\u00f6k\u00e7eada . 
  its towering height is intimidating . 
  every salaried job is prostitution _ in essence _, 
  just steal less, 
  capitalism !, 
  get some !, 
   weed and satanists sound like my kinda place !, 
  i can assure you that even if we invade them islets and islands they wo n't be populated . 
  we 're totally not a seafaring country ( after visiting bozcaada and gokceada ) . 
  we 're a land people . 
  ps : fuck eating fish, 
  i burnt all my money having a peace of mind is priceless !, 
  living on the streets now . 
  send sandwiches pl0x, 
   living in s\u00f8nderborg mojn !, 
  and $ & $ rates are thru the fucking roof !, 
  what cam do you use ? 
  i stayed home . 
  mine is a wee merciful corporation . 
  them sweet sweet euromonies, 
  i like how the great metropolitan municipality of istanbul takes care of snow ( ! ), 
  good to see our taxes not being wasted, 
  balls the size of olives, 
  i think that is a curse in irish _ ph ` nglui mglw ` nafh cthulhu r'lyeh wgah ` nagl fhtagn _ arise !, 
  oh , nothing . 
  just snow . 
  right guys ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ shhhhh . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ shut ^ ^ ^ ^ up ^ ^ ^ ^ murat , ^ ^ ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ ^ ^ talk ^ ^ ^ ^ about ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ bombings ^ ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ ^ shootings, 
  this , kids , is what we call turbo nationalism . 
  horrible license plates, 
  i guess we can now all agree that turkey has turned into yet another middle eastern shithole . 
  terror attacks every fucking week ; horrible economy . 
  i watched enough german porno to guess where this is going :d, 
   same fucking talk , nothing new . 
  just talk , talk , talk . 
  that 's some quality politics , 
  all i can say is ... danish is hell . 
  i think everyone should pay apple level low as snake shit taxes . 
  that 's an easier solution . 
  how do you think apple became by market capitalization , the largest publicly traded corporation in the first place ? 
  this is what happens when politics mix with religion ( an explosive religion at that ! ), 
  we 're in some real deep shit . 
  i see no exit in sight . 
  with a wee bit more bombing and murders i 'm sure they 'll see the light ... or else !, 
  this `` article '' is most possibly a flat out lie . 
  use irc n00bs, 
  what with ? 
  facebook likes ? 
  hehehe fox, 
  funny country if you like absurd humour as long as you do n't live there, 
  where a 2 hour commute is considered normal . 
  jesus titty fucking christ, 
  when you appoint a gypsy wake me up then . 
  that 's a bingo !, 
  this guy gets it . 
  because changing your fbook profile pic or giving likes actually means jackshit in real life . 
  maybe people have started to realise this . 
  `` i like turkey but i love chicken ! '', 
  maybe just pictures of pig, 
  if shit continues at this rate : a ) tayyip and all political islamists will be reaped ... with the folks that has nothing to with them alongside ( e.g. 
  ordinary people that has nothing to do with islamism or politics ) . 
  b ) shit will escalate even further c ) someone else might just as well put a bullet in tayyip 's thick skull option c seems the most favorable to me . 
  i 've been wondering what happened to my youtube connection ... didnt take me long to find out . 
  _ [ the bomb has been planted ] _, 
  i do n't know whether it 's because i 've been exposed to too many commieblocks but these ones actually look quite nice to me .
