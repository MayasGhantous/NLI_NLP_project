  although it hurts to admit but i think the brits got the direction right . 
  i read somewhere that driving on the left actually decreases the accidents ( dominant right eye ), 
  it 's tayyip the terrorist itself .

  i 'm loving the politics and the _ new democracy _ of our dear leader tayyip . 
  his end may be more gruesome than qaddafi .

   is it a street food in turkey or do you make it at home ? 
  exclusively street food exclusively eaten after boozing off  holy crap well , it is if not washed properly, 
  [ gnaws on kokore\u00e7 ], 
  yea but how does one achieve this ? 
  do you install a flowmeter in your throat ? 
  oh my heartattack, 
  not true for istanbul , not true at all . 
  it costs about $ 137 for 25 m ^ 2 .

  i ai n't proud but turkey has a quite sizable small arms industry ( private and state ) unless h & k makes enemy flesh seeking bullets we ought to be okay . 
  that makes sense, 
  how the fuck do you have terrible coverage in a country so small and so flat ? 
  that makes it even braver :3,

  lower your taxes first youse rundstykker !, 
  i do n't get what changes whether turkey 's membership bid is in place or not . 
  it wo n't be admitted anyways . 
  maybe the bid had some benefits before tayyip . 
  some of our laws and regs were being tried to be aligned with the eu 's . 
  but now it 's completely futile . 
  or helloumi oh , btw you lack basic reasoning,

  no soul , no beauty , no nothing ... consume , work , obey , die, 
  you do n't need to impose sanctions on turkey or threaten kick it out of the customs union . 
  just persuade large european corporations to withdraw or at least withdraw their hot cash . 
  february 2001 again , baby, 
  all they eat in bulgaria is kebabche , fries and beer . 
  it 's good ... but only goes so far , 
  as the picture tells the screams of thousands of commuters the most horrific public transport is in istanbul ... and this thing called [ metrob\u00fcs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/metrobus_\\ ( istanbul \\ ) ) is the jewel of that horror . 
  if the card transactions are like in turkey then good luck !, 
  my bank exactly knows where i spend my money with my credit card and possibly shares my info with advertisers . 
  they also block your account `` inadvertently '' . 
  happened to me once , happened several times to my family members and friends . 
  [ i concur ] ( http://cdn3-www.comingsoon.net/assets/uploads/2015/10/musings.jpg ), 
   turkey : trust no one , not even no one . 
  actually the saying goes : do n't even trust your father ( _ babana bile g\u00fcvenme _ ) .
