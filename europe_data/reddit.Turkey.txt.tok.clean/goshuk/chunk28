  dont wan na pump up pessimism here but i 'll do it anyway : can anyone gim me an example that a peaceful protest ever changed anything ** substantial ** ever in turkey ? 
  sure as shit 2013 gezi park protests did n't and that was the absolutely positively the biggest peaceful protest i have ever seen in my lifetime . 
  nice job here is a ribbon for ye, 
  the map depicting the levels of depression . 
  this is just making it official ( i mean , when they actually stamp it ) . 
  it has been obvious for decades . 
  erdogan or some other party . 
  would n't have made the slightest difference . 
  lem me let you in on a secret : it 's been fun since the beginning . 
  im changing my rented apartment just because that cunt of a owner doesnt let me put in an ac . 
  we have come to a point that no peaceful protest is gon na do anything to the atrocities of tayyip and his cronies . 
  then go imagine the level of your forefathers, 
  since driving in india is the greatest challenge of all ... i think driving in every other country becomes a piece of cake, 
  * welcome to city 17 * ^ ^ ^ ... behave !, 
  this country has been damaged beyond repair . 
  and you do n't like luck into men like mustafa kemal atat\u00fcrk often . 
  even so , since the majority here is backwards fuckwads does n't matter in the end anyway . 
  i think we should remove the blue stripe on the turkish plates and replace it with the flag ... oh dang !, 
  forgot that our flag law is so up tight . 
  if you choose the non-euroband option then you have to stick one of them awful `` dk '' stickers . 
  well at least the law tells you to do .

  do n't gloat kom\u015fu, 
  if the country you live in blocks wikipedia then i guess it 's time to evaluate whether it 's still worth living in that shithole . 
  he was the ultimate badass [ _ `` a man born out of due season , an anachronism , a throwback to the tatars of the steppes , a fierce elemental force of a man . 
  with his military genius and his ruthless determination , in a different age he might well have been a genghis khan , conquering empires . 
  gallons of coffee and depression, 
  we can do that with enough insanity i dont see why not !,

  hard at least for engineers . 
  say you 've been a manufacturing engineer for 4 yrs . 
  it will take quite a bit of convincing to work as - say - a quality engineer . 
  no one quite gets the hatred like the isps in turkey . 
  * turk telekom * being the worst of the worst . 
  hating it with a p\u00e5ssion . 
  laz language, 
  h&k g3, 
  almost 90 % it is - wrongly - referred as _ ingiltere _ ( england ) the correct word for uk is * birle\u015fik krall\u0131k * . 
  also gb is not uk and very few people in turkey know this . 
  we tend to bury our dead covered in white clothes ( no coffin ) and put some wooden planks on top of it so the weight of the soil does n't crush the dead . 
  i doubt the dead will mind but hey , not a time to be logical i guess . 
  too bad that during the ceremony the fucking imam , that the state assigns , escalates `` oh dear departed '' to `` all the glory to our state and army '' bullshit quite at the speed of light . 
  then you wish there were another grave dug especially for this asshole . 
  gay, 
   what do you like on yours ? 
  lotsa various types of meat, 
  istanbul is indisputably that powerhouse in turkey ( has 1/5th of the entire turkish population ) you , of course , can find jobs elsewhere but they wo n't be as nicely paid as they are in istanbul ... also if the name of the company ( bosch , siemens , mercedes-benz , p & g etc. ), 
  is important to you then you 'll also have harder time finding them elsewhere in turkey . 
  weight lifting and wrestling, 
  leftover pizza, 
  i believe it was originated from istanbul, 
  a few : https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc195133.aspx on qwerty kbds they sit lonely on the right hand side .
