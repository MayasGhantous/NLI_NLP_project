  back to the 8-bit era  they look a lot like the [ dkk ] ( http://www.atsnotes.com/catalog/banknotes-pictures/denmark/denmark-65.jpg ), 
  norn iron !, 
  switzerland seems like the perfect country . 
  there are 4 cheaper countries that you can go fetch foodstuffs in bulk . 
  absolutely agreed . 
  i know that the taxi regulations and taxi companies in many countries are utter shit but just because you are a new company it does n't mean you get to dodge the law . 
  you drink that much coffee your body will build up a tolerance like the walls of istanbul . 
  probaby a good thing that europe has n't learnt about black tea yet . 
  you would probably abuse that substance to a whole new level , 
  down with the vigesimal !, 
  * ( looking at you france and denmark ) *, 
  as a european i do n't much care for the imperial system and just think of it as some of the exotic stuffs which we do n't have ( excl . 
  uk of course :p ) but i had some trivial and non-pleasant experiences with it : - when i was in university i bought a second hand mechanics book for a real bargain price . 
  so happy , right ? 
  only to find out it was us edition . 
  that 's when i saw smth called * kip ( kilo pounds ) * . 
  when everyone else in the class was solving the exercises in newtons - like a normal human being - i was dealing with kip , feet , pounds , inches , lizard balls etc. 
  - learnt this thing called * latex * . 
  wow !, 
  it really takes out the micromanagement of ms word when you write reports , thesis and whatnot . 
  wonderful , right ? 
  okay dokay , time to print the report . 
  then i get some error of non-matching margins of sorts . 
  wtf ?!, 
  a4 is set , yes , correct ... but why are n't you printing ?!, 
  turns out - back then - the default latex paper size was set to us letter not a4 on my installation . 
  - when in * top gear * they talk about the speed of a car . 
  it 's bothersome to multiply bu 1,6 to get the km/h , 
  smart decision, 
  i would like to see eu linking r\u00f8dby and fehmarn . 
  i think that 's a busier route and more plausible . 
  last time i checked ice was mutterficking expensive . 
  correct . 
  i do n't know if there is even a single accident caused by consumer electronics radio signals . 
  plus all modern * ( a.k.a do n't know about the russky planes ) * aircraft cockpit is shielded . 
  well no shit eu !, 
  no * schazuuu * ? 
  well , you can be an owner of a company if you are lucky  it does n't even need to be that big , but at least substantial size to bother with tax ~ ~ evasion ~ ~ avoidance schemes and that delicious offshore money . 
  then you dodge taxes better than bugs bunny dodges bullets  you just make sure to show your income next to 0 like the `` great '' steve jobs who had $ 1 salary . 
  you never spend directly , it 's always company expense and you run credit but do n't pay yourself ( as an individual ), 
  i wish i was an corporation . 
  just even be able to dodge 20 % vat would be great , let alone other taxes . 
  yup , soooper important issues, 
  ** turkey ** [ tayyip dismissed iphone 6 as `` same as the last one '' ] ( http://phys.org/news/2014-09-turkey-erdogan-dismisses-iphone.html ) . 
  he ai n't wrong though , 
  secret agenda !, 
  secret agenda i say !, 
  and their numbers are suddenly diminishing :p, 
  they 're usually 1/32 irish :p ( maybe 3/97th catalan ), 
  i mean , yeah  we saw how far so-called nationalism goes in scotland and quebec referendums . 
  they chose money . 
   catalonia , which includes barcelona , is one of spain 's richest and most highly industrialised regions i suppose basque region is also better off than the rest of the spain . 
  no wonder these guys want independence to keep all those delicious euromonies to themselves , 
  literally a first world problem, 
  they 're also hard to find in many places in europe . 
  greatest rip off all times . 
  istanbul is already half slum ... and the other half commieblocks . 
  y' know without the cyberpunk angle . 
  lebanon is/was a small country . 
  the palestinian influx really upset the balance . 
  the effects in turkey will be far less severe . 
  it will just add to the pkk militants and already ongoing war . 
  the refugees are perfect addition to pkk 's ranks . 
  they 're already poor , confused , hungry . 
  all pkk needs to do is point an ak-47 to their heads . 
  or greece ... or the balkan countries . 
  the whole thing is an exercise in futility . 
  but at least it used to steer the country in the right direction ( the chapters of the acquis are solid checkmarks for progress ) . 
  now it 's heading towards russian/arab quagmire . 
  oh , macedonia !, 
  you crazy diamond, 
  this will come back at turkey as more kurdish terrorism . 
  the current turkish administration - which has been in power since 2002 - has no intentions whatsoever to exert any efforts towards the eu accession of the country or fulfilling any of the criteria . 
  they just want to sell the `` modern and muslim '' image to attract foreign hot money . 
  i am guessing since it 's dr it was partially made by using tax money, 
   is there a stereotype of germans being frugal or is this specifically related to the pigs ? 
  that is reserved for the dutch, 
  this is actually okay . 
  i paid $ 7 for 1/3 litre beer in festival areas . 
  now , that was fucking robbery . 
  fucking great . 
  more prospective pkk terrorists . 
  nobody should have to watch porn from xhamster, 
  totally agreed . 
  fortunately now 90 % of the businesses accept visa/mastercard . 
  should n't it be tied to the brand ( e.g. 
  visa , master card , amex etc. ), 
  of the card rather than the bank of origin ? 
  at least , that 's what i had thought . 
  my experience as a turk was milder . 
  most possibly it has smth to do with my looks ( i do n't look middle-eastern/mediterranean ) and my english accent . 
  but when i tell them that i am a turk one can see that the smiles vanish instantly and the air gets heavier . 
  they start to behave more cautiously and start asking me the same stupid questions of `` but you do n't look like a turk ! '', 
  and `` how on earth are you not a muslim !? '', 
  over and over !, 
  i will leave it up to you whether this kind of behaviour is xenophobic or not . 
  i do n't know now but back in 2007-08 german vending machines and stores had some sort of `` allergy '' to foreign cards . 
  there were many instances where i could n't pay with my danish ** visa ** card in db automats , supermarkets , electronic stores etc. 
  there are also cheap german brands like jeltzin , gorbachoff & c. 
  yay,
