  and not insist on greek/alexander heritage despite being 100 % slav and speak almost the same language as bulgarians . 
  greece 's overreaction is also ridiculous the pettiest of all disputes , 
  i think my generation knows trump from back to the future 2 . 
  where to start ? 
  pretty much all shows are a shitshow on tv . 
  marriage shows , survivor , popstar shows etc. 
  conscription only . 
  ** clubs ** ( or _ disco _ as we call them here ) : expensive , deafening , pretentious and a real hassle to get in . 
  ** bars ** : they are alright . 
  mostly beer is consumed . 
  you are served , you do n't need to go to the bartender . 
  since we are a muslim country now ( ! ), 
  the booze is really expensive for us ( $ 4 for 1/2 a litre beer ) . 
  also one more thing that i detest : every establishment tries to maximize the number of tables and chairs per mm ^ 2 . 
  since everyone is sitting within their social circle there is almost no interaction w / other people . 
  which sucks . 
  my experience is limited to the western part of turkey . 
  i do n't know how it is elsewhere in the country . 
  they forbade the booze ads and erotic ads . 
  so i am not very happy about it . 
  if you can not control your spending , yes , i agree . 
   without spitting someone in the face by accident ? 
  never mind that for a moment . 
  it sounds like you had a stroke and now you have a lisp . 
  in turkish we have no ** th ** , ** w ** and ` open ' ** a ** ( as in `` al '' ) sounds . 
  so any words containing these sounds sure fuck us up . 
  consonants right after each other will also fuck us up for we always have a vowel after a consonant . 
  - with : such a short word , yeah ? 
  it has w and th ... so a doublefuck !, 
  pronounced as ** vit ** . 
  - three is pronounced same as tree ( ** tri ** ) . 
  pronunced as ** siport ** or ** s-uh-port ** . 
  because two consonants next to each other . 
  - windows ( ** vindovs ** ) - breath ( ** bred ** ) . 
  will sound exactly like * bread * . 
  all but one ( the scottish accent ), 
  they sure started to fix their death trap roads ( though going 50 kph a pothole can still damage your suspension or even crack your windscreen ... happened to me ! ), 
  if only they could fix their super corrupt traffic cops . 
   `` anyway multiquoting is done `` like ` this ' , depending on the level '' '' nested quotation ... i like it !, 
  hey , it keeps me cool during summer time, 
   decimal places : 1.24 or 1,24 _ ... and anarchy descends ! _, 
  nothing exotic in turkey i 'm afraid : prices in shops : [ 9,99 tl/lira / ] ( http://www.zekimarketetiket.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/dscn33867.jpg ) ( or 0,75 if it 's under 1 lira ) or 9 ^ ,99 in some shops large numbers : 9.000.000 is often written as 9 milyon . 
  i wish suffixes like k and m were more widespread outside of the corporate world . 
  decimal places : we use , as the decimal separator and . 
  for as the thousands separator . 
  quotation marks for quotes in text : `` pretty standard '' * ps : we put % and currency sign after the number . 
  because that 's how you say it in gobble-speak . 
  why would anyone need a credit card , right-o ? 
  when i used to live in denmark my bank refused to give me a credit card . 
  so i had to make do with a debit card . 
  which ai n't that nice . 
  not many people i knew used kreditkort , as well . 
  maybe because banks in dk are a bit worried about collecting debt . 
  oh yeah #big data !, 
  do you need to enter a pin using your contactless card ? 
  they are n't popular here though banks give you the option to use nfc or android pay on your smartphone ( almost no place it to use them though ), 
  makedonya or makedonya cumhuriyeti ( officially ), 
  5 '' thick pizza _ [ ca n't breathe ] _, 
  [ turkish war of independence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_war_of_independence ) get inspired and learn why mustafa kemal atat\u00fcrk is greatly revered in turkey . 
  denmark , of course . 
  the only one amongst them that does n't make you kill yourself or give into alcoholism . 
  also danes are much easygoing than the others . 
  oh , you can buy booze whatever time you damn please in whatever shop ... and it does n't cost an arm and a leg . 
  narcos, 
  i have tatar ancestry but damned if i ever thought about tatars or tatarstan . 
  so i 'm true neutral, 
  arbitrary, 
   turkish people abroad really do n't do you guys a favour . 
  than god they 're abroad and do n't add up to our problems :d, 
  the [ 2001 financial crisis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_turkish_economic_crisis ) in turkey brought this monster upon us . 
   is that what made it possible for erdogan to be what is `` that '' ? 
  no attitudes , or inner beauty !, 
  we - as shallow beings - are strictly interested in the outlooks ( hotness ) in this thread !, 
  also tall . 
  mmmmmm, 
  it was beer but since we ca n't say that ... well , let 's see : if it 's a club scene : - olmeca , sierra or some sort of low quality tequila - a bottle of whiskey . 
  since it 's a club and very expensive , be it a _ chivas regal _ douchebag edition . 
  - some bullshit cocktail for the chicks . 
  if it 's a tavern or bar . 
  simply one thing : raki, 
  them monsters !, 
  year 2002 when akp came to power, 
  if you visit istanbul , i know it 's hard to avoid , but the * taksim square * . 
  it 's ugly and small . 
  also _ besiktas centre _ . 
  overcrowded and overrated . 
  i personally swipe my credit card between the stripper 's tits, 
  the entirety of denmark, 
  if cyprus is then so are we, 
  denmark buys its entire beer & soda stock from the german border . 
  i 'm talking about people buying bulk with fucking vans and trailers, 
  all the fucking time, 
  the one with white collar workers, 
  same here, 
  or think of all the people who has no access to drinking water , die of malaria , starvation , live under perpetual war etc. 
  if those people cling to life with what little they have and one does n't ... there is smth very very off with that one 's mental sanity . 
  likewise i do n't get people getting depressed or committing suicide in well off countries . 
  a shame really . 
  i used to think that my life was n't worth a penny when i was a teen . 
  then i see the vilest people that exist on this earth .
