  just to spite them i have to exist , too . 
  ugliest and soulless cities in turkey are the ones with no tangible history and became boomtowns because of the industry . 
  comes to mind, 
  yes \u0131 need a slave, 
  it is very much so . 
  do i want it to be ? 
  well , let 's see the alternatives : - russia - china - arablands so , #yes, 
  turkey is # 1 in : - [ tea consumption per capit ] ( http://qz.com/168690/where-the-worlds-biggest-tea-drinkers-are/ ) a. a junkie country hooked on caffeine . 
  - hazelnut production . 
  60 % of the world 's hazelnuts come from here . 
  if nutella was of turkish origin there was no stopping us !, 
  also : all of the neigbours of turkey use a non-latin alphabet/script . 
   - almost one of every hundred coffee beans in the world is imported to finland , a country of only 5,5 million people . 
  we drink a lot of coffee . 
  more than any other country per capita , in fact . 
  depression levels must be thru the roof, 
  women should be able to abort whenever they like . 
  1 or 9 months , should n't matter . 
  right now ? 
  0 lira usually 20-50 lira i am a credit card slave, 
  mayo on top of canned pears . 
  - articles . 
  we have none . 
  i mean no concept of it . 
  makes life easier . 
  none . 
  - past perfect , present continuous perfect or present perfect . 
  these are really tough concepts for a native turkish speaker . 
  - countable/uncountable . 
  no such concept . 
  everything is `` countable '' - i do n't think it 's possible to create `` un-fucking-believable '' kind of adjectives in turkish . 
  these come to mind off the top of my head, 
  kazakhstan is in central asia ... i fail to see how it is related to europe geographically . 
  same with azerbaidjan . 
  both but it cuts off at ww1 . 
  you get 14 days every year . 
  it 's not enough, 
  mostly propaganda as it turns out i actually like history ... just not the kinds taught in public schools, 
  the trauma is still alive in turkey . 
  turkey . 
  i know our chicks nowhere near as hot as the germans , slavs and scandinavians but hell , they can hold a conversation and no precious humour is lost in translation  physical outlook only goes so far . 
  ( which ( in order ) ? 
  or more literally _ how manieth ? _ ) used when asking which ordinal number it is . 
  - * kolay gelsin * ( pretty much the same as the danish * god arbejdslyst * ) means * hope you get on well with your work * . 
  you say it to people while they , re working . 
  polish salaries are quite low . 
  you may get same or even less what you used to make in turkey, 
  a person from turkey is called a turk ... not turkish . 
  despite that turks make this mistake quite often while speaking english . 
  lucky bastards, 
  it 's a credit card country here . 
  i like it and it 's quite important to me . 
  i could also do just fine w / a debit card but paying your debts after a month is nicer , 
  take it from me as a fellow turk who had gotten a job abroad : - you may use local indeed.com ( dk.indeed.com ) or job portals ( e.g finn.no ) - but you 'll have to apply separately for each job . 
  no convenience ( one cv-one click-done ! ), 
  like kariyer.net of turkey . 
  your chances are somewhat slimmer than the locals as you probably had guessed . 
  your application will be assessed in somewhat `` quota b '' . 
  that is to say , if company x can not find an eligible candidate locally then they might consider assessing the candidates in quota b. if you 're within the lucky bunch and you get an interview ... it also differs . 
  countries large in landsize like norway might do all your interviews remotely ( e.g. 
  over skype ) . 
  hell , they might even send your contract over in turkey . 
  others will request you to come for a face to face interview at some stage . 
  so be prepared for that . 
  as it costs dear money and time . 
  you 'll need a lot of perseverance . 
  the whole ordeal might at least take a year . 
  also remember that it 's not all pies and peaches in europe . 
  you 'll miss the sunlight , friends , family , food and whatnot despite all that shit going on in turkey ( yeah , you might laugh now but they might really add up ) . 
  unless you end up in uk , you 'll have to learn the local language . 
  that itself is whole ` nother ordeal . 
  good luck, 
  our best room in the house is called `` guest room '' ... so , yes , we do value our guests a lot  that 's probably because it 's a remnant from the times when turks were nomads ( there still are some in turkey called * y\u00f6r\u00fck * s ) . 
  to travel long distances with horse , one had to rest in foreign tents . 
  if you 're a foreigner you 're welcome to stay . 
  last summer a german cyclist was looking for a cheap hotel . 
  i offered him to stay in my house instead . 
  likewise , last week i missed the last intercity bus . 
  two workers from mid-anatolia offered me to stay in their house . 
  quite often and devastating the last awesome one was back in 1999 , 17 august, 
  simply torturous in istanbul multiply that by 4, 
  which is ? 
  i often go to [ gokceada ] ( https://www.google.com.tr/maps/place/g%c3%b6k%c3%a7eada/@40.1658875,25.7000479,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x14b02d46bc017f79:0x94f13c20720e8ef5!8m2!3d40.1669236!4d25.839555?shorturl=1 ) where my friend lives . 
  it 's a hassle to go but i like the tranquility there . 
  [ this chick ] ( https://www.google.com.tr/search?q=el%c3%a7in+sangu&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=670&amp;stick=h4siaaaaaaaaaongfulvt9c3new2zs5iqiouu0jw00zzqrtespot9evkgci-ocg_vsgx1yo5sbjkewm4t8dlh_eepfwmrtl5jdgdc4dcit0unte8ksyssievlkepvms0gkt4uvcfeadtw19lkgaaaa&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewi_2qbcrypqahwgxcwkhcs0buwq_auibigb ) seems to be the most popular right now, 
  not all . 
  most nonbrewed tea ( e.g. 
  teabags ) lack caffeine and taste , for that matter . 
  [ ahem ahem ] ( http://www.therichest.com/rich-list/most-popular/10-biggest-tea-drinking-nations-worldwide/ ), 
  not much ... and that is a good thing for reddit, 
  the teaman ( or teawoman , both called * \u00e7ayc\u0131 * since turkish language has no gender differentiation ) well , as the name implies , he is solely responsible for making and distributing the tea within the workplace ... and is integral part of the company , since the workers have to be kept caffeinated ( turkish tea has caffeine in it ) at all times and all the turks consume ridiculous amount of tea . 
  the entire nation is junkies . 
  absolutely haram, 
  [kariyer.net ] ( http://www.kariyer.net/ ) bar none . 
  it 's a monopoly level large site . 
  turkey oh wow , am actually living in turkey, 
  southern cyprus for obvious reasons, 
  what tourists ? 
  fun fact : all of turkey 's neighbours use non-latin alphabets, 
  easy-ish for the literacy rate was low in ottoman empire,
