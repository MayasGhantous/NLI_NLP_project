   bulgaria , romania , hungary , turkey and serbia since 1992 [ 1 ] . 
  romania and bulgaria are still lower than turkey you ignorant doughnut, 
  if you completely disregard that eec turned into eu , yeah sure . 
  any turk with a bit of common sense would see it that way . 
  applying since 1959 ffs, 
  wow . 
  one would think romania & bulgaria would be better off financially for 7 years since they entered eu . 
  apparently they made no headway and gdp per capita is not much of a concern for eu to accept members . 
  but you 're okay with 2 large british military bases, 
  according to this map 1/2 of turkey is kurdistan . 
  very accurate ( ! ),

  i am expecting there in the cabin to be a full on riot and anarchy . 
  y' know wives wailing , youngsters punching the elderly , babies stomped etc.

  sweden may be the first country to actually implement p2p voting just like they were heavily involved in mobile cellphones because of the geographical vastness of the country .

  p/f is all that matters . 
  there is almost no `` country of origin '' products anymore ( except simple items like foodstuff ) .

  everyone tried to buy the most expensive model month after month . 
  every-fucking-body is a phone `` expert '' . 
  it has this this this features . 
  the fuck are you gon na do with all those features ? 
  even long before 3g came to turkey people were paying for this feature . 
  the poor ass retard earns 800/mo but he goes buys the latest iphone for triple the price of his salary . 
  it 's disgusting . 
  100 kr admission and you have to pay again inside to use the not-so-attractive attractions .

  hehe actually - cik in bilecik could be a diminutive suffix if i only knew what bile meant  ps : bilet\u00e7ik means little ticket in turkish though there is no such word but it definitely can be created . 
  in turkey it 's * [ bilecik ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bilecik ) * . 
  i do n't know how the joke started but it 's basically `` bilecik can not into relevant '' . 
  might have been some [ caricaturists ] ( https://i.imgur.com/yvs7pfz.png ) that started it . 
  although my favorite irrelevant city ( no one knows how it became a city ) is [ bayburt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bayburt ) .
