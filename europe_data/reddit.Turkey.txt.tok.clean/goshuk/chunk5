  it 's gon na end well ( ! ), 
  - composition-wise : russia ( if it counts in europe ) - lyrics-wise : turkey ( if it counts in europe ), 
  meat is expensive in turkey ( always has been ) . 
  people just buy whatever is the cheapest regardless of its country of origin . 
   mr. kramarz said that it often costs 3,000 euros , wow , that 's scandinavian level of rip off, 
  stanhope is the most depressing and dark humoured comedian i know of ... i absolutely love his stand-up shows . 
   `` hh '' and `` wi '' drivers are scary , but i think thats because europcar and avis register all their cars under these respectively . 
  i dont know wi drivers but hh ones were quite aggressive . 
  and here i am sitting and thinking how much jet fuel was burnt . 
  shit is expensive . 
  but disused i presume . 
  well , unless you talk to royalty , 
  in turkish it 's same as german : sen ( du ) -- polite --  siz ( sie ) imperatives can also be `` softened '' : - yap ( do ) - yapin ( please do ) - yapiniz ( my dear sweet pie with cherry on top could you please do if it is not such a bother for you ) we also use a lot of honorifics . 
  i wish we dropped 'em all and just be like the danes where everyone use their name regardless of their position . 
  but oh no no no , we have to keep the redundancy . 
  just because . 
  traditionally/historically wolf ( gray wolf to be more specific ) is the animal of turks . 
  it 's tied to many myths and legends . 
  i think it 's because it 's a pack animal that symbolizes unity and hierarchy . 
  but today if i had to pick an animal that represents turkey it would be sheep ( or penguin to a lesser extent ) . 
  they 're also cute , 
  i 've heard that in germany when people see a car from a different region holding up the traffic or other mildly annoying stuff , they get patient because they know it ai n't from around there . 
  there are 81 of them in turkey and you usually know the codes of big cities and neighbouring provinces . 
  also many dads know them by heart , 
  he also [ ** really ** ] ( https://www.itusozluk.com/image/ahmet-davutoglu-nun-kahvalti-sofrasi_522074.jpg ) likes his breakfast . 
  motherfucker eats as much as the annual agricultural products of zimbabwe . 
  anywhere east of ankara . 
  yeah sure . 
  i mean whatever floats your ~ ~ boat ~ ~ welfare :p, 
  then maybe the government will decrease your world infamous car taxes, 
   my own view of christania is mixed . 
  i 'm generally in favor of having a vibrant alternative community in the heart of the capital , but the way current resident are so exclusive about who gets to live there is disturbing . 
  essentially , the only way to get to live in christiania is either through birth or willingness to sleep with old hippies . 
  that 's only so much `` anarchy '' for one  also i do n't think anyone is lining up to live there . 
  regardless , what i wonder is : do pushers pay tax ? 
  who else are they gon na sell to ? 
  of course they sell it to those `` abuser '' countries . 
  they do the actual killing and in actual need of weapons . 
  that 's what weapons are for ... to kill . 
  if those human rights abusers could manufacture their own believe me they would . 
  sometimes reporters seem to have barnacle for brain . 
  it 's sad to hear that some people here believe that turkey should or does indeed follow a turanist ( pan-turkic ) union ideology . 
  this is delusional and ended with a catastrophe when that retard * enver pa\u015fa * who pushed ottoman empire into ww1 . 
  after fucking up he still continued on his delusions of grandeur and was finally mowed down by a gatling gun in turkestan autonomous soviet republic . 
  today , those turkic republics are russian satellites and ** all ** of them are extremely corrupt and oppressive . 
  so , puh-lease !, 
  oh also , in those republics the locals really do n't like turkey turks . 
  thanks to all the swindling turkish businessmen went there after the collapse of ussr . 
  i 've been to kazakstan , azerbaijan and turkmenistan . 
  go see for yourselves . 
  you 'll kiss the ground when you come back to turkey , let alone a fantasy union . 
  whether the europeans or us like it or not we are bound together . 
  germany is our # 1 export partner , 95 % of our trade with eu is industrial ( and this was back in 2009 ) , we have many relatives , friends and loved ones that live within eu . 
  just because eu membership is not a reality for turkey that does n't mean there are no other alternatives for cooperation . 
  there can be some minor steps made to ease the relation . 
  okay , do n't give turks free travel but at least make getting visas easier and free of charge for researchers , students and tourists etc. 
  that are obvious will not stay there and `` take your jobs away '' . 
  try to include us in your nice schemes like no roaming charges . 
  stuff like these ( of course not with the current tayyip regime . 
  we have plunged in all human rights , democracy , freedom of press , censorship etc. 
  statistics since that fucktard came to power ), 
  and i do n't see eu ever wanting to neighbor syria , iraq , armenia , georgia , iran and giving turks the # 2 majority in the european parliament anytime soon even if by some cosmic chance turkey got to the contemporaneous level of western europe . 
  turkey 's goal of full eu membership is delusional . 
  they should make a * good * privileged partnership deal . 
  not a shitty deal like the customs union that was made in 1996 . 
  one has to applaud the persistence of turkey ( but jeer at the incompetency of not fulfilling acquis chapters ) . 
  has been a candidate since 1959 . that 's 55 years and counting . 
  looks l\u0131ke katyusha m\u0131ss\u0131le routes, 
  largest gas station, 
  i read this theory in several places but i do n't know how true it is ( probably is n't ) : profits from gog.com helps them keep afloat . 
  so they do n't much care about the common denominator thus they do n't dumb down their games . 
  * ps : what 's the corporate tax rate in cyprus ? 
  i wonder what `` cd '' in cd projekt stands for . 
  at first i thought they were a compact disc manufacturer turned game developer , 
  worst chart ever . 
  horrible to make much sense out of it . 
  does this include the driver school cost ? 
  * ( i assume it does ) *, 
  i would have thought gr\u00f8nland was the one . 
  invest in eastern poland pl0x ? 
  good ol' outhouse, 
  roaming need not be expensive . 
  when you are in another country you still use the [ local operator ] ( http://i.imgur.com/atswdyv.jpg ) , i.e the voice signal ( same for data i assume ) goes thru the local network . 
  so far it has been expensive because of the deals your provider needs to make with gazillion of companies in every country . 
  if those contracts can be simplified within eu there is no reason to get fucked with exorbitant prices . 
  and it 's gon na happen , 
  whats wrong with eu ? 
  that shifty cunt, 
  if i had a child i would put a gps transponder in his/her pocket . 
  why is presidency such a big deal ? 
  is n't it just a figurehead ? 
  probably very touristic but i rank * sedlec ossuary * # 1 * [ black metal posing intensifies ] *, 
  yeah , good luck just disregarding the fact that many politicians are heavily lobbied by large tax ~ ~ evading ~ ~ avoiding corporations for a moment here ... there are giant corps like kpmg , deloitte , pwc etc. 
  who run this scheme and also countries like cyprus , malta , ireland , luxembourg etc. 
  depend on this whole tax haven deal . 
  yeah , you can see that i am not that optimistic .
