  turkey 's index/number is 56 . http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ity_public/2-19062013-bp/en/2-19062013-bp-en.pdf, 
  that site killed my browser . 
   ca n't you just go to another country with lower taxes , buy it there , and drive it across the border ? 
  or is the government aware of simple tricks like that and would just tax you anyway ? 
  i guess you mean register the car in some other country and use in dk . 
  ( otherwise , you will end up paying the tax anyway -- as import vehicle ) you ca n't do that unless you have permanent address in that other country . 
  even if you pull it off , your neighbours in dk will grass you to the cops . 
  else everyone would do it . 
  nuclear power best power !, 
  has one of the lowest energy unit cost ( beating wind and solar ) . 
  liberal alliance ? 
  anyway , if most of you are happy with it then keep it that way . 
  although i must say your public transport ai n't cheap either  or crossing the stroreb\u00e6lt with a car ... achhh my wallet . 
  your car taxes are insane for a country within eu . 
  ranging from 180 to 300 % for a new car . 
  other members usually have 20 % acquisition tax . 
  or baiting, 
  i came to understand that for protests to work you need a properly behaving government in the first place . 
  by proper i mean governments like denmark 's , belgium 's , s. korea 's etc. 
  non-proper governments would be ukraine 's , turkey 's etc. 
  last summer whole turkey protested nothing happened . 
  it actually got worse . 
  a bizarre project, 
  one of them off-shore , tax havens . 
  if possible all of them . 
  say you are on vacation ( as a country ) , 
   edit : downvotes for asking for a source ? 
  possibly because of your flair . 
  `` singaporean '' lol , 
  i have a feeling that we will see that bubblehead midget on liveleak with isil psychopaths that he spoon fed ( at least one can dream ) ps : i hate his [ face ] ( https://media.economist.com/images/images-magazine/2010/10/23/sr/20101023_srp002.jpg ), 
  i know this is a dumb question but : ca n't they deny his entry into austria ? 
  there must be hundreds of excuses to do this in diplomacy . 
  i mean they know he is no good to anyone and no good is gon na come from his visit . 
  99 % bk and mcdonalds stuff here . 
  i am yet to understand why people in turkey eat them . 
  expensive and they do n't taste good . 
  they are also really inferior to local foodstuff . 
  i actually like some of the eurodance * ( collateral damage for being a teenager in 90s ) * . 
  la bouche , ice mc , 2 unlimited , dr alban and other shit . 
  we still make '' * retro * '' parties once in a while . 
  it 's like being a closet homosexual . 
  everyone in real life will swear on their dead pet 's life that they fucking hate this genre . 
  but once in a while ... all the repression goes out the window and get really really shitfaced on eurodance with a lot of cringy dance moves  i know , we should all be ashamed of ourselves . 
  where is your ~ ~ god ~ ~ satan now ? 
  it 's a stain in history . 
  do you know the angst and anguish to be asked `` heeeyy !, 
  you from turkey ? 
  do ya know tarkaaan ? 
  well , do ya punk !, 
   yeah , but do n't you think fastfood kebab would suck ? 
  if i had entrepreneured in that domain it probably would n't :p if there is a will , there is a way . 
  invest to me !, 
  need capital . 
  too bad that the turks lack the capitalist marketing skills and cunningness of american food franchises . 
  those guys managed to sell simple food items like hamburger and fries to the entire world . 
  if some entrepreneur had those skills , kebabstuff would have been truly pervasive , 
  i think for-independence camp wants to see scotland become like a wealthy scandinavian country . 
  small population ( ~ 5.3 mil . 
  ) , north see oil , bad weather etc. 
  but they differ on the taxation afaik . 
  low corporate taxes to attract foreign investments . 
  i do n't know if this is sustainable at all . 
  so the against-independence camp also has very good reasons not to take such an adventure . 
  if they will be allowed in eu right after the independence , i think it 's worth taking the risk and become independent . 
  i thought it was bratwurst und sauerkraut for berliners, 
  atheist and metalhead but guilty of consuming excessive amounts of kebab varieties though . 
  it 's been more than a decade since i finished high school . 
  they fiddled with education system so many times since then . 
  but what i was taught was mostly ottomans , ww1 , the turkish independence war and early days of the republic . 
  absolutely nothing after that . 
  not even ww2 !, 
  [ abdul hamid ii ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/abdul_hamid_ii ) he is probably the most hated sultan . 
  because of his spy network and jailing a lot of people and thus creating paranoia & fear ( and probably he downright looked mean :p ) . 
  but i would claim that this guy is the most underrated one . 
  everyone likes the monarchs from the glory days : suleiman i , mehmed ii , bayezid i , selim i etc. 
  those were dwarfs on a hill whereas abdul hamid ii was the giant in a pit . 
  the guy basically managed to hold the empire against a downfall during a rapidly decelerating time when the ottomans were thought of already finished . 
  he was a modernist sultan . 
  many of the modern turkish institutions have their roots from his time . 
  some of the things he did : * made the hejaz railway ( some parts today still used ) * opened ziraat bank ( exists today ) * brought the industrial scale printing presses . 
  had made some 6000 books translated . 
  * brought electricity and telephone * opened textile and paper factories * opened modern pharmacies * opened many schools and some universities * opened archaeology museums * shelled the american warship trying to enter izmir port unauthorized even had a [ bridge project for bosphorus ] ( http://i.imgur.com/aegcvm0.jpg ) . 
  if i was the pm , sure . 
  i wish they would stop fucking with n\u00f8rreport st. leave it as is !, 
  pissed filled and with crappy interior  i do n't care !, 
  what i care is if i can connect via n\u00f8rreport . 
   nor speak the language bullshit much ? 
   he is a great orator . 
  [ no he ai n't ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dotkz7az8vm ) he ca n't put two words together without a prompter . 
  ( he may be the only pm who buffers :d ), 
  bulgaria has been run by mafia and they 're in eu . 
  so i dont see the problem , 
  was this metro ring really needed ? 
  copenhagen - imho - already has a very good rail transport system where you can also carry your bicycle ( except rush hours in metro ) . 
  i dont know the further scope of this project but a ring line is usually laid when there are many more lines than just the 2 ( current lines in cph metro ) . 
  why are scandinavians so good at english and majority of their population speak it ? 
  i would think so . 
  every ex-yugoslav i 've acquainted has ultra good nostalgia about those times . 
  turkey right now , shit load of support . 
  we have millions upon millions delusional maniacs .
