  when to abolish the monarchy ? 
  well , the equation is simple : if the money generated from tourists who come to see monarchic stuff is less than the tax money spent on those royal blobs , abolish that shit ( how the heck one is gon na calculate that is beyond me  ) . 
  if it is more keep 'em . 
  uk and denmark get a lot of tourists because they have an actual monarch living in those castles and and have funny dressing soldiers , methinks . 
  just a theory . 
  how much is that in gunter 's chains ? 
  or 67,257.2178 fathoms, 
   tekirdag koftesi i 'm from tekirda\u011f and this is the weakest of all * k\u00f6fte * s in my not-so-humble-opinion  . 
  well , all k\u00f6ftes are overrated ( maybe except tatar k\u00f6fte ) when you think about it . 
  maybe i ate too much of the stuff and it changed my perception . 
  actually post-boozing we do n't eat d\u00f6ner ( or pizza or burger ) in turkey . 
  we tend to consume more intestine products like [ * i\u015fkembe \u00e7orbas\u0131 * ] ( http://www.hurriyetaile.com/userfiles/tarif/1549_650x433.jpg ) and [ * kokore\u00e7 * ] ( https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-n68pjgg1que/t_rfhnlhv4i/aaaaaaaaane/rlgtyyqpzcc/s1600/img_1256.jpg ) . 
  these two have more sobering effect on me and probably many others . 
  dammit i 'm hungry now . 
  he knows what he is doing . 
  many of his voters - which are ~ 40 % of the population in total - are extremely cowards . 
  they are afraid of their bosses , elders , mothers , fathers , girls , men , crowds on the streets , whoever does its job well , building guards , bus drivers , tourists etc. 
  so tayyip pokes at their cowardice every time he gets a chance . 
  keeps 'em scared with irrational bullshit . 
  then they keep seeing him ( and his party to a lesser degree ) as the protector and unifier . 
  their money their choice ( and later on , their own problem ), 
   forced and unpaid labour in an environment ** where risk of death is a normal part of the job . 
  ** they wo n't even flinch for a second to write me off as a * drill casualty * , if smth to were happen . 
  same here . 
  we were used as unpaid workers . 
  cook , clean , cut the grass , drive the officers etc. 
  i shot with g3 couple of times and that was the only military related thing i 've ever done in military !, 
  6 months wasted absolutely . 
  immense boredom and temporary loss of iq during that time . 
  everyone bitched about the food but i was `` trained '' during my boarding highschool times to eat utter crappy food , so that was okay  if we were by some cosmic chance sent to war , we would probably not be able shoot anything and become instant cannon fodder . 
  why does this kind of slavery under the disguise of military even exists ?!, 
  it baffles the mind . 
  if one could only remember that before falling down onto bed or floor, 
  drink water ( club soda also helps , if you ca n't drink too much water ) and sleep it off . 
  then take a shower . 
  https://i.imgur.com/2f1klqi.gif also i would n't be that surprised if our dear leader wants to join . 
  those countries in that will be-union are corrupt as fuck , dictatorships and have poor populations ( despite their rich underground sources ) ... perfect match for turkey . 
  what decision ? 
  those bans even made my elderly parents network specialists . 
   * my dad bought a smart phone * : goddammit !, 
  let 's just change the dns straight from the router . 
  * me * : whoa !, 
  i 'll try there when i go to istanbul . 
  i live somewhere in trakya and kokorec variety ranges from bad to real-diarrhea-inducing-horrible . 
  too bad that so few places make good kokorec . 
  there are untapped markets for kokore\u00e7 , i\u015fkembe \u00e7orbas\u0131 , kuruyemi\u015f and lahmacun . 
  ps : investors wanted !, 
  most possibly . 
  unlimited sms packages do n't also include unlimited mms in turkey ( last time i checked ) . 
  also mms quality is shite . 
  the voltage is also different ( 220 v ) . 
  so do n't fry your phone . 
  * turkey : * immensely popular despite the cheap unlimited sms packages . 
  i do n't know the reason of its super popularity . 
  `` not clear '' as i gather , but m5s is a good example . 
  he wont be able to watch it anyway :p runtime : 3,2 hours and it 's an art film . 
  we 're gon na need more foulards, 
  even wwii is not taught . 
  so , forget about anything more recent than 1938 . why ? 
  to keep you asleep . 
  even the taught history is pretty shitty ( e.g * almanlar yenilince biz de yenilmis sayildik * ) . 
  i wish they taught battle tactics though . 
  at least they ca n't lie much there . 
  isnt there an anti-eu yet not a fascist and racist party in denmark or in eu ? 
  is the combination so hard to come by ? 
  racism still runs deep in southern cyprus . 
  just yesterday turkish cypriots with roc passports were [ not allowed ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/cyprus/comments/26ftpe/tcs_werent_allowed_to_vote_with_just_the_ids_and/ ) to vote on eu parliament elections . 
  a reunited cyprus would blaze quickly if it is ever established . 
  northern cypriots can cuss and taunt turkey all they want but at least they 're alive . 
  so , i dont realistically imagine a united cyprus . 
  but if did ( if all that animosity was gone ) : it would have to start with a confederacy then move into a solution like [ digenisakritas ] ( http://www.reddit.com/user/digenisakritas ) ' [ suggestion ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/262gw8/cypriots_how_do_you_imagine_a_reunited_cyprus/chnee1z ) . 
  i wan na see the film but it would probably be hard since it will be shown in select theatres . 
  disc release would probably take a year . 
  i 'm waiting for the first * `` but they committed armenian genocide '' * post . 
  should be soon now . 
  it was just a random german team i picked . 
  i might as well picked schalke 04 or b. dortmund or etc. 
  but thanks for nitpicking the shit out of it ( ! ), 
  yup . 
  anything with `` turkey '' in it is a an opportunity for them to flash their banners . 
  does n't matter if it 's totally unrelated to the actual events . 
  and this subreddit 99 % endorses it . 
  you can see my earlier comment in this thread . 
  tell me what the fuck is the relation between a mining disaster , kurdish separatism , bolshevism , assad and armenians ' claims . 
  no one is telling them not to protest . 
  it 's plain disgusting that they use every opportunity regardless how unrelated it is to their whatever cause . 
  armenians and kurds keep popping up like those whack-a-mole things in every unrelated event , as long as turkey is in it . 
  real smart ( ! ), 
  imagine israelis popped up in events like oktoberfest , wacken , bayern munich matches etc. 
  why ? 
  fuck logic , that 's why . 
  pkk , armenian , assad and soviet flags . 
  yeah good going you fucking idiots . 
  turkey also has 193 % car acquisition tax on top of all . 
  icing on the cake . 
  what a car hostile country . 
  i have to disagree . 
  polandball is pure quality  ( apart from that temporary epilepsy inducing design ), 
  why not just merge r/europe with r/polandball while we 're at it ? 
  where am i gon na get my beluga caviar now ?
