  meanwhile turks pay [ $ 1.77 for per litre of benzin ] ( http://gm.poas.com.tr/pompafiyat/ ) ( rivaling only it , no & nl ) despite living next to the oil wells of the world . 
  good going cunts . 
  you must have a constant phlegm problem :p and * roskilde * is a sunovabitch city . 
  because of its pronunciation . 
  bulgarian border and traffic police are the worst . 
  if you have a non-bulgarian plate , chances are that you will be stopped very frequently and asked for bribes . 
  in one of the many of those stops , they could n't find any excuse but came up with one that i had a somehow `` non-standard '' fire extinguisher in my car . 
  i coughed up the bribe ( $ 20 ) . 
  guttural r ( danish , french and to some degree in german ) for me seems like the nightmare stuff . 
  r , as in croissant and many more horrific variations . 
  if you really want netflix and other american services that are not available in your country you can always use vpn . 
  just sayin ', 
  the more he polarizes , behaves like a cunt and a thug the more he is liked . 
  remember [ reyhanli bombings ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_reyhanl%c4%b1_bombings ) ? 
  the townsfolk were sooooper angry at him at the time but guess whom they voted again on this year 's local elections ? 
  ^ ( spoiler : ^ it 's ^ akp ^ again ) the dumbfucks not like but ** love ** this asshole ... and they 're about the 40 % of turkey . 
  this is the harsh truth . 
  your country is as much as how many dumbfucks can vote . 
  even harsher truth is that the type of republic ( where there is 10 % election threshold , among all ) turkey is , does not work . 
  i would even go as far as to proclaim [ democracy does not work ] ( https://i.imgur.com/vdyk9.jpg ) for every country . 
  i sometimes think that if mustafa kemal atat\u00fcrk did not impose his ideals turkey would have been worse than iran , ksa , libya , syria , iraq and all the gulf countries . 
  but apparently this is it . 
  this is as far as it goes with `` hand-carried buckets of water '' . 
  all has been held together with duct tape and rubber bands . 
  the `` natural things '' will go find their path and turkey will be like those countries i listed . 
  all this fuzz over a 4 m pipe ? 
  they stole the one tonne iron gate of my gated community . 
  i ai n't even mad . 
  i just wan na know how they did it . 
  i 'm guessing that it 's not that easy or cheap to acquire movie rights as many other firms would have exploited the european streaming market before netflix had arrived . 
  then again , i do n't really get the buzz ( maybe since i 've been using other channels that are deemed illegal ) . 
  there were also bisons in the northern forests ( deliorman ) of bulgaria ( pre 1970s afaik ) but they were poached and overhunted . 
  i think turkey under tayyip erdogan administration totally has no intentions whatsoever to join anything eu-wise and eu itself . 
  they just masquerade so their ever-praised `` islamist but modern '' sham holds on . 
  somebody had to do it, 
   until 2006 no . 
  wtf, 
  denmark banned the whole thing until 2006 ( as far as i remember ), 
  as if bulgaria does n't export tobacco . 
  sunflower oil, 
  wtf is european culture ?!, 
  sausages , cabbage and jesus ? 
  republic of serbia = republika srpska ( bih entity ) ? 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuuhdacg83e :p, 
  what ?!, 
  no northern country ? 
  that 's a shocker . 
   * that gdp though ... * ftfy, 
  i mean the idea . 
  p2p based voting is possible and people are working on it afaik . 
  example : http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2f978-3-642-02627-0_5#page-1, 
  if it ai n't non-trust based p2p like bitcoin then it ai n't safe . 
  based on real estate bubble and import based assembly . 
  very stable ( ! ), 
  the more horrible thing is that there will be no ramifications . 
  human life is cheap in turkey . 
  they should have used czech hedgehogs . 
  amateurs . 
  clearly swedish propaganda at work ( but they 're right !, 
  oh uk !, 
  you flamboyant christmas tree . 
  without cars and ads the streets looked way better ( as is the case for everywhere but japan and hong kong ), 
  made with the tax-payers ' money :p must have cost couple of million kroner just for this video . 
  * ps : i voted on march !, 
  most villages on the north eastern side are at best half abandoned ( result of bulgaria 's forced exodus of turks in 1989 ) . 
  the ones that stay are mostly elderly . 
  most of their youth population is now romani . 
  i think this is how `` business '' works in brazil . 
  the construction companies will come up with `` emergency fees '' to finish up and justify the `` fees '' themselves . 
  just a guess . 
  regardless , why ca n't they just build one olympic place once and for all ? 
  do the olympics there every 4 yrs . 
  too boring ?!, 
  for instance , i go to wacken every year and it 's at the same place . 
  do i get bored ? 
  would i want wacken to travel around the world ? 
  fuck no . 
   nope . 
  this is so normal . 
  people want better life standards , better paying jobs , etc. 
  that 's also why eastern europeans move to western and northern european countries . 
  those lucky bastards . 
   i do n't blame the neighbours . 
  i just reminded him that there are thousands of potential refugees just on the other side of our borders . 
  so that 's why foreigners do n't wan na move to turkey ?!, 
  put any other politician to the office , still most young people would prefer to move to the eu because of the eu 's reputation among turkish people . 
  can you blame them ? 
  an engineer in the west gets around $ 2800 while most get around $ 1000 in turkey . 
  that 's almost triple . 
  they want fair pay . 
  i want fair pay , too gottverdammt !, 
  you seem like a logical fella , lem me ask you few questions  * i 'm quite sure that you can buy plastic bullets in usa . 
  why do n't homeowners use them but go for live ammo ? 
  do they really lack the stopping power and really ineffective ? 
  *  had a shotgun , which is not a heavily regulated gun in many industrial countries same in turkey . 
  i can legally buy a shotgun way easier ( less tax , less bureaucracy , cheaper fees , no need for hunters license etc. ), 
  than a pistol or a rifle . 
  why the heck is that ? 
  in my view , a shotgun is just as much if not more deadly weapon than a pistol . 
   teenagers call it garage hopping .
