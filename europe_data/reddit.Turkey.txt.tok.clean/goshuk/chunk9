  the goal was to sneak into an open garage , steal some beer or other items and slip away into the night . 
  i would have shot him , maybe . 
  but this `` montana homeowner '' was clearly baiting with half open garage door . 
  and shoot 4 times ? 
  stop blaming the neighbours !, 
  virtually every right-minded young person wants to leave the fuck out of turkey . 
  there are even people who wan na move to kiribati . 
  territories in bulgaria ( and other countries ) are turkey 's `` living history in europe '' - prime minister recep tayyip erdogan we gon take your lands . 
  better ramp up them military expenses like greece does . 
  * we have to deal with that lunatic/retard and his shit stained speech on a daily basis :( *, 
   living izmir is a very different experience ah izmir !, 
  what an overrated shit stained city . 
   i am half turkish , so perhaps not a `` true turk '' , i 'll let you in on a secret : if you feel like a turk , identify yourself with turkey and speak turkish ... you 're a turk !, 
  you do n't need consanguinity , race tree etc. 
  to be a turk . 
  apparently many people dont know this . 
  efe and tekirda\u011f . 
  what about the industrialization in post ww2 period ? 
  did it not make things better ? 
  it 's not exactly a state secret but i think that many are not familiar with drinking rak\u0131 : * do not bottoms up your rak\u0131 from a shot glass ( ever ! ), 
  * although it 's perfectly okay to drink it with no water ( * sek * ) it 's way more common to mix your rak\u0131 with water ( 1/3 - 2/3 is a good ratio for starters ) . 
  the order should be : rak\u0131 '' water '' ice cubes . 
  if you drop in the ice cubes first and then pour in the rak\u0131 , it will crystallize ( you do not want that ) . 
  * have another glass of water next to your rak\u0131 glass to sip sometimes . 
  i know it sounds strange since you already have a water-mixed rak\u0131 glass but this is the way . 
  * do not clink it like beer . 
  the correct way is to [ clink it on the bottoms ] ( https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-77c-fxodoio/tpiafp1bihi/aaaaaaaaaik/9mlj6ljyebm/s1600/bizzz+%25283%2529.bmp ) of the glasses . 
  i do n't recommend that you clink your bottom end of the glass onto the top of the other 's glass , as it can sometimes be interpreted that you are the superior of that person . 
  * it 's highly recommended that you have a * meze * while you are drinking rak\u0131 . 
  the cheapest and quickest one are just [ sliced melon ] ( http://neylemeyle.com/images/mezeler/mae_6722-kavun.jpg ) or white cheese cut in cubes and sprinkled with paprika and olive oil or both . 
  peanuts , chips , crackers etc. 
  are not meze . 
  * if you are having a great conversation and not feeling that drunk but when you stand up everything is rotating ; you are doing it right , 
  who runs nets ? 
  the prince of darkness ? 
  first their crappy java based and centralized ( which is way worse than java imho ) nemid system now this . 
  tsk tsk, 
   bulgarian couple who came to cyprus to work in a farm was kept in a pen that previously housed cattle , starving and unpaid , for almost a year . 
  it was discovered when the slave-driver was attempting to send them back to bulgaria as a surprise . 
  typical stuff . 
  [ ph ] whoa !, 
  depressing, 
  now i know that i am financing this shitfest :-) thanks, 
  i hope eurovision is 100 % a private organization . 
  i would n't want to see a single tax cent spent on this shitfest . 
   in addition , they can also stop and search all cars passing through a particular place . 
  this is even more insidious since the tax authorities sometimes tags along on these occasions . 
  this is to mainly catch other eu registered cars whose driver resides in denmark i suppose . 
  after a certain period the car must be re-registered in denmark afaik . 
  otherwise all danes would own a car with swedish or german license plates ( substantially cheaper ) . 
  yes . 
  stop & search + show id . 
  if you fail to show id then prepare for a quarrel or a visit to the station ( or both ) . 
  we 're a police state . 
  i dont understand the way fruits and vegetables are traded in eu . 
  i was in denmark a couple of months ago and most of the fruits/veggies sold there flat out suck !, 
  it does n't even matter that much whether it 's a cheapo supermarket like aldi or an expensive one like kvickly . 
  instead of buying - say - nice peppers from southern europe they buy it from greenhouses of netherlands or from argentina !, 
  horrible horrible quality . 
  as i understand , non-processed fruits/veggies from turkey are banned , too . 
  heheh look at bulgaria . 
  good commie  but portugal !, 
  why u do dis ? 
  so it 's cheaper to import apples all the way from usa ?!, 
  capitalism is a strange thing . 
  no amount of excessive bandwidth is overkill young padawan , 
  not to spoil the hype but many dns servers and sites are not as fast enough to deliver and fully exploit a 1 gbps connection . 
  you 'll probably have the same site load time as a 100mbps connection . 
  too soon , too soon !, 
  `` turkish democracy '' 404 not found, 
  the scandinavian countries are at the top of many metrics ( gdp ppp per capita , distribution of income etc. ) . 
  so they get great jealousy and respect for that . 
  their people are bland though . 
  i never understood why you need to drink that much to talk to other people . 
  when they are sober they hardly even say `` hi '' . 
  that 's not a nice behaviour . 
  pesto, 
  the ~ ~ dictator ~ ~ pm erdogan made it illegal to demonstrate on the taksim square for 1st of may ( [ 39000 cops and 50 water cannons amassed ] ( http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/gundem/26294675.asp ) ) . 
  i think people will demonstrate anyway . 
  the police will beat up , mutilate and kill people , as they always do in turkey . 
  here it 's mostly a garden . 
  one can grow a lot of stuff . 
  it also became somewhat customary to cover up your car parking space with vines and wherever you want some shade . 
  we do n't get as much rain as the northern countries . 
  so , since you are gon na use water ( dig up a well ) at least use it for something that you can eat instead of grass . 
  they reflect most of the humanity today we have , the common denominator and the hatred . 
  we 're still not far away from ww1 or ww2 . 
  that is , mowing down each other in an instant spark . 
  i mean humans can not be even trusted with a simple task like flushing . 
  that 's why we have those photocell auto flush toilets . 
  you have to be rich to join the club ( this is also the main reason why eesti can not into nordic ) . 
  ca n't be worse than fyrom 's claims ^ ^ huehuehuehue, 
  ca n't hold their drinks . 
  just because i dont use smileys in my text doesnt mean i am a hateful fullblown racist . 
   only recently https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=k3s92bru78li6_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ppppc&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=world&amp;idim=world:earth&amp;idim=country:ro:tr&amp;ifdim=world&amp;ind=false 1990 is not `` only recently ''  brought here lots of gypsies as slaves ? 
  yeah . . thanks for that . 
  you 're welcome, 
  i would argue that is n't a compound word but an agglutination but meh . 
  i got ta wash the dishes . 
  english with scottish accent .
