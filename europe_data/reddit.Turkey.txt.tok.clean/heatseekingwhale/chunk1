that 's your interpretation . 
  well are n't you merciful ? 
  nah , i do n't deal with racists . 
  where did i call him a nazi ? 
  oh wait , you 're a / r/european poster . 
  sigh, 
   who are ~ ~ not afraid ~ ~ too stupid to say it . 
  fixed . 
  it 's pretty popular & old . 
  thought it fit perfectly on that comment . 
  i know right , it 's pretty easy to tell who comes from which region . 
  his clothing , hair style , posture or eve where the picture was taken all show his origins so to say . 
  in this case it 's that he has no hair loss plus that hairstyle with that shirt is most common among kurds . 
  everyone , no one . 
  that mustache tho that guy is most likely kurdish but all legendary staches get my approval . 
  i ca n't get erection from the election !, 
  i would say akp * was * veeeery similar to us republicans . 
  religious , spineless and good with money . 
  we knew what they were made of from the day they were elected but their supporters were ecstatic and opponents/foreigners hopeful . 
  where did you visit ? 
  central anatolian/kurdish parts are very much not `` european '' . 
  you guys love shills right ? 
  well this man is here for you . 
  he 's not russian but he 'll do . 
  literally the only things he posts are pro-turkish/akp . 
  afaik this all starts with / u/limmericky who claimed to have been banned before the election date ( why ? ), 
  and jumped to / u/unchecked1 ( the account he used to whine about the alleged ban ) and then went silent 4 months ago . 
  i 'm not saying this dude is / u/unchecked1 , but he 's / u/unchecked1 . 
  he 's been doing this for 2-3 years now . 
  got ta respect the dedication . 
  kam may frends , sii d\u0131 layt , coin as . 
  that 's the thing , it 's not . 
  maybe that 's when akp will let go temporarily to have another party clean their mess and still come out on top ? 
  is n't one of the core things about nazism like , the superiority of aryans or whatever ? 
  sure you might not be big on homoerotic statues and phrenology but you have to believe in all that racial stuff because that 's all nazism is . 
  it 's pretty pathetic that they are copying people who would literally erase them from the world if they could . 
  it 's not like russia or slavs have a boring history , they could 've put on some nice 16th century russian clothing and they 'd at least be typical nationalists rather than idiots going through cognitive dissonance . 
  i 'm talking about slavic nazis , does n't nazism and the big h consider slavs to be subhuman ? 
  that 's like black guys being klansmen . 
  i think akp supporters are slowly getting disillusioned but it 'll be too late when they finally completely remove their head out of their ass . 
  they were under the impression that everything was a-ok and tayyip was a noble muslim who had the country 's best interest in mind pre-gezi and leaks . 
  i do n't get how current akp supporters go through the cognitive dissonance . 
  i mean they are so loved that nonexistent/dead people vote for them !, 
  officially akp manages to win with juust enough votes every single time . 
  i do n't buy it . 
  these guys embezzle billions , are corrupt to their core , exploit religion , have known instances of electoral fraud in every single election and they are going to tell me they did n't do anything in this election ? 
  the actual percentage of akp voters are estimated to be 30 % -35 by some . 
  might be even lower . 
  not to mention they use government funds to fund their own campaigns and own almost all mainstream media and intimidate the ones they do n't . 
  reminded me of the [ banned ads ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfyds20yoo ) for a secularist newspaper called `` cumhuriyet '' ( republic ) and they would always say `` are you aware of the danger ? 
  protect your republic . '', 
  or `` the republican woman is being destroyed '' in every single ad and people went `` yeah ok '' and dismissed them . 
  the joke 's on them !, 
  also to wrap up , what is really interesting is akp supporters do not deny that democracy is `` going away '' , they seem to genuinely think we 'll be better off with a monarch or whatever . 
  i know , i thought he was disapproving of the phrase in general . 
  i do n't get it . . 
  what about per capita ? 
  that 's still pretty insane that there are slavic nazis running around . 
  muslim nazi regiments = islam and nazism combines !, 
  come on . 
  where 's the muslim ? 
  they have n't figured it out , this is good ... 
  if you take the `` break swiss neutrality '' decision you get a casus belli and some infamy . 
   central asia has never been much more than a footnote in * european * history . 
  fixed . 
  i agree with everything else in there . 
  dude deleted his account . 
  you do n't see this stuff everyday folks . 
  we had some streets named after greek poets and writers and the like in the small mediterranean town i lived in . 
  ah , plunderrr it . 
  that 's called ancient macedonian , no ? 
  besides , modern languages would probably take priority over extinct languages and thus greco-macedonian . 
  longbowmen are one of the cheapest retinues afaik . 
  you 'll get your money 's worth . 
  if you 're a king you should be having about +1000 longbowmen . 
  yes , welsh and english culture gets longbowmen retinues . 
  they are the best retinues in the game because they are both numerous and powerful . 
  well you can always longbow your way to victory . 
  you should try playing as a jain emperor . 
  you get the opinion bonuses that muslims get and do n't have to worry about decadence . 
  it 's a nice way to learn and get used to things . 
  when you add - oid it becomes scientific . 
  it 's a fact . 
  he was literally worshiped ( some still do ) . 
  do n't think you can get any bigger than that . 
   hitler was just a figurehead , so there would have been a nazi party and it would have had about the same values . 
  that is one strong statement there . 
  shill until proven innocent bro . 
  you must prove your loyalty . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ sound ^ ^ ^ ^ familiar ? 
  it 's not really israeli `` activists '' or shills or whatever , it 's just some racist cowards . 
  happens all the time . 
  they know ... 
  shut it down . 
  how old is that ? 
  soviets are still there . 
  why ca n't you guys just call the language `` south slavic/yugoslav '' instead of serbo-croatian-bosnian-montenegrin etc and be done with it ? 
   \u010cefur seems suspiciously close to gavur . 
  also \u00e7apak means eye crust :o, 
  i think they are supposed to be non-eu .
