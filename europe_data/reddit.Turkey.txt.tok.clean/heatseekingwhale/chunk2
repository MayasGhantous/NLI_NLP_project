  mongolian actually has more loanwords from turkic than vice versa . 
  we will never '' '' '' `` unite '' '' '' '' with gavurs . 
  bulgar ( ian ) s are actually confused turks . 
  true story, 
  do n't know about that , my dudes descended from y\u00f6r\u00fcks and sufis . 
  plus everybody partially descended from people who were forced to `` change culture '' . 
  tell me about it . 
  you 're a serb , i 'm a serb , he 's a serb , everybody is a serb !, 
  they are the biggest guys around , it 's all relative . 
  putin also lost half his hair . 
  i think he 's compensating for his lack of hair . 
  dat engrish in the title tho, 
  that 's indo-european languages for ya . 
  because they think respectable women should n't present their bodies to the public . 
  nudity and the like was probably associated with prostitution . 
  seems like russians take their pro wrestling seriously, 
  truly a top analysis by a top mind . 
  why stop there ? 
  attack them and tell them to accept your values or die ? 
  tell me about it . 
  resistance is futile . 
  yeah i 'm not getting into a history argument because some offended spaniard is trying to be passive aggressive . 
  not falling for it this time . 
  but yeah , not impressed . 
  well that 's better , you beat half naked people with obsidian spears . 
  do n't be so mad for preveza , bro !, 
  shit happens . 
  we seem to have lost thrace , hmm . 
  wow you killed and enslaved people with the help of apocalypse diseases much impress, 
  realistically , greece since i can literally see their islands from my house and could probably swim/hop on a boat to there . 
  ideally , somewhere * very * comfortable considering i just went through hell . 
   also should n't turkey be bursting full with it ? 
  na , we do n't care . 
  `` oh look , another x thousand year old artefact/place , cool . 
  back to something else '' . 
   i mean seriously , ~ ~ if you 're a young , blonde , caucasian woman , you ~ ~ do not go camping in some remote part of pakistan . 
  fixed . 
  avoid remote places in general , they naturally tend to be pretty lawless . 
  i 've heard/experienced that taliban/al-qaeda tends to go easy on turks . 
  do n't want em to start being hostile to us too . 
  take what kurds/pkk say with a truckload of salt . 
  thank you , this will last for a few months . 
  should n't have reported on who rescued them , i hear they tend to trust us more than they trust westerners or arabs . 
  what is their point with this ? 
   p.s. 
  : wow , a german making fun ~ ~ of other people 's accents . ~ ~, 
  nobody in this subreddit has heard of zaalouk or bessara and baklava is controversial , you might know this . 
  the moroccan kebab site does n't include the history of it and wants me to go to the european version of the site , fuck that . 
  bottom line : do n't be an america , man !, 
  which ones ? 
  all of these are turkish . 
  this is n't a joke , how would it work ? 
  what is it then ? 
  \\ - adolf hitler, 
  probably because it 's not balkan . 
  false , it 's filled with meat/potato/vegetables etc. 
  take that back blz, 
  most of them are downvoted , indicating their opinion is unpopular . 
  get this 4chan shit out, 
   it 's because the self-hating/loathing seems to be a typical european thing trust me , it 's not . 
  everybody says this . 
   so you are one of those people ? 
  dat alienation, 
  same ! ^ ^ ^ ^ 1000 ^ ^ ^ ^ years ^ ^ ^ ^ ago, 
  druuums . . 
  yes , we get it . 
  scandinavia looks like a penis . 
  we have a guy who literally does nothing but post pro-akp/tayyip stuff for years in / r/turkey too . 
  got ta love shills . 
  we kiss when greeting too , some who think that 's too sensual for them just use headbutts ( tilt the head and touch foreheads on each side once or twice ) . 
  no offense but no one cares . 
  / r/european [ is pretty good for that sort of stuff , they have free discussions and respect every opinion . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lrz2r.gif ) also got ta love having a `` quality discussion '' with people who agree with you . 
  that 's the thing , why are they whining about it if it was the norm then ? 
  it 's just one giant whirlwind of cognitive dissonance . 
  generally the easiest way to visualize these is to switch the sides and see how they react . 
  i 've heard of ukraine supplying crimea and south cyprus supplying the north in similar situations and figured something of that sort was the case here , i 'm *** shocked *** that he was dishonest . 
  also they call us cruel but worship a guy who literally bragged about torturing women & children to death . 
   big scary serbia ha , do n't flatter yourself . 
  also afaik the reason they still get those utilities from serbia is because otherwise serbia would basically be giving up it 's `` claim '' and admit that they no longer control the place . 
  but yeah , i can understand your frustration . 
  * the west has been fighting perceived terrorism everywhere , on stage , on tv , in literature , not to mention iraq and afghanistan , but when actual terrorists show up it 's `` welcome , phreedom phighters and oil providers '' . 
  * * and i 'm not sure you could host a meeting of holocaust-denying , bin ladin-admiring islam supremacists in netherlands , some of these guys are wanted in parts of europe . 
   there 's no ideological split with iran or saudi arabia ha, 
  mmm yes , hydrogen cyanide goes really well with my slav lungs . 
   the pax americana is drawing to an end and in one or two decades time not really , america is by faaar the most powerful and wealthiest nation on earth . 
  we have * at least * 50 years till they fizzle out ( and that 's if something extraordinary happens ) i 'd say . 
  china is rising fast but they still have literally hundreds of millions of people in poverty . 
  besides , there is no ideological split like there was with soviets . 
  so none , who thinks the french flag is racist ? 
  source ? 
  go ramble on / r/european . 
  but of course . 
  race relations are complex [ but here 's an excellent explanation . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1plkvj/risky_question_why_is_black_face_as_part_of_a/cd3kxjh ) you might notice it talks about america but it applies to colonial european nations too . 
  it 's depressing that many people here think it 's something vague to joke about that happened in the past but it affects millions of people to this day and it 's serious , just keep that in mind . 
  sorry to ruin your fun everybody !,

  invalid statement, 
  haha slavery lol,
