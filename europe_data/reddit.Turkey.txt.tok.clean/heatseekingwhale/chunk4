  actually is shill, 
  coastline might be too small . 
   how is unquestioning hardcore free market not a bias ? 
  he agrees with it . 
  nazis doing nazi things , who would 've guessed . 
  next you 'll tell me they 'll abuse minorities . 
  also the way they wrote that is literally indistinguishable from other far righters , just replace greek with other nationality . 
   largest force in europe lol also if they wanted to brag so much they could 've assimilated into german/russian empires . 
  yeah , they were trying to buddy up with soviets by pretending to be commies but the soviets were n't having it . 
  now that they are gone they 're trying to get close to the west and thus create another image for themselves . 
  no one , there is no hierarchy . 
  my grandma is a bekta\u015fi from hac\u0131bekta\u015f . 
  albanian anythings are definitely not seen as the global head here . 
  these guys are not very battle hardened i 'd imagine . 
  global head of the bektashi order ? 
  maybe the head of bektashi order in albania . 
  or here . 
  genetics can be misleading tho . 
  [ the current descendants of the ottoman dynasty ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8c/ay%c5%9fe-g%c3%bclnev-osmano%c4%9flu-issue.jpg ) are most likely genetically indistinguishable from western/northern europeans even though they ultimately came from central asia because every ottoman ruler after orhan married europeans . 
  others ca n't prove it because nomads/peasants do n't keep records . 
  you can be called a nationalist if you ca n't grasp that millions of people were n't government agents to keep the balkan man down . 
  that 's an even better comparison . 
  this dude thinks millions of turks were working with the government , enver pa\u015fa thought millions of armenians worked for the russian government . 
  both peoples were massacred . 
  by the way that 's totally not a biased site at all . 
   you 're painting with very broad strokes did you not realize how hypocritical you sound with this, 
  you 're looking into it way too hard . 
  it 's just another nationalist . 
  you can see why we needed to get rid of greeks and armenians then , yes ? 
  broken link, 
  lower and upper class . 
  it 's just * banter * bro , chill . 
  yeah , that 's wrong . 
  expat and immigrant are ( supposed to be ) interchangeable . 
  yes , he would n't be an immigrant . 
  he 'd be an * expat * . 
  actual d\u00f6ner . 
  if you 're concerned about uneasy neighbors you got ta see us . 
  azerbaijan & armenia have unfinished business in nk , syria & iraq are literally in a civil war and people are getting killed by the thousands , iran is a theocracy involved in s&i , greece is `` going bankrupt '' and we 're basically just watching it all happen from across the border , sometimes literally . 
  not everyone can handle the city, 
   they do n't have the infrastructure and experience that america has . 
  same , i kind of have to shave . 
  otherwise they stick out and look gross plus they amplify the smell . 
  even if all of europe united and somehow mustered a military twice the size of us ' , they 'd still be worse because they do n't have the infrastructure and experience that ** america ** has . 
  nah , this is the usual apocalypse talk . 
  you 're all going to be just fine . 
  they need that mediterranean port bro, 
  boy if you 're offended by this you need to see how they depict us . 
  that looks pretty cool to be honest . 
  just needs some bridges and squares to connect the buildings . 
  uygurs ( and basically every non-han ) would disagree ... 
   sometimes you need to force everyone to learn one language for the greater good of the nation to prevent division in society and conflict . 
  thank you . 
  this is what we 've been saying for decades . 
  that seems like a non-issue to be honest . 
  they never had democracy with britain but now they 're whining ? 
  ### and still # 1 economy and military americaaaaaaa ^ ^ ^ ^ hows ^ ^ ^ ^ my ^ ^ ^ ^ murrican ^ ^ ^ ^ impression, 
  please report this anti-semite . 
  i know , you wrote `` salatl\u0131k '' not `` salat ** a ** l\u0131k '' . 
  i just fixed it and elaborated some . 
  this is indeed very creepy . 
  hard to erase racism when there is legal recognition of race . 
   these people what people ? 
  does n't matter . 
  that is the british definition and if you 're in britain that 's the definition you go with . 
  i do n't see how decent people would have any problems . 
  `` hmm , i wonder if it 's illegal to fire him for his religion in * this * country ? 
  bummer ... '' just do n't see that happening . 
  means `` for-salad '' . 
  `` oy vey , it 's another shoah '', 
  [ sort of an example , nsfl ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itzb1n_ezxu ), 
  wow they defeated some dudes with flip flops on toyotas . 
  it 's in yozgat , no greeks there . 
  they can look this up if they do n't know what it is . 
  apparently the definition of race/racial group in uk :  in british law the phrase racial group means `` any group of people who are defined by reference to their race , colour , nationality ( including citizenship ) or ethnic or national origin '' . 
  yeah , euros are the last people to complain about slavery . 
  umayyads were kicked out of arabia for being too racist ... 
  why spain ? 
  literally means `` strangler '' . 
  implying implications ? 
   at least it will be a pleasure watching turkey turn into syria 2.0 soon :d . enjoy those ** kurds ** and jihadis alri - wowwwwoow wait up , you dare insult kurds ? 
  you racist fo\u015fik . 
  oh yes, 
  at least they have no domestic violence . 
   i wish greece the best of luck on their path to further self destruction . 
  i hear you , same here . 
  americans are european when they do something cool and mongrel puritans when they do n't . 
  that is failure on a whole another level . 
  i 'm impressed . 
   it is for any romans still around . 
  good thing they disappeared a while back then, 
  nobody cares what it is for you . 
  that '' \u0130tburnu '' for rose in azerbaijan ... \u0130t burnu means dog nose in turkic . 
  they hate us cuz they anus, 
  you got ta put the english translation at the end bro, 
  na man chill, 
   conscription just so that the military stays connected and has a strong foundation within the society that 's not how it works at all . 
  it 's good to have young men get out of their comfort zones yes but military should be last place for it . 
   its completely unrealistic that a nato member would attack another nato member . 
  lol,
