  it is mostly historical genocidal denial/recognition war and qarabag issue between azerbaijan and armenia . 
  wipe out 15 million kurds in turkey ? 
  and since almost half of the kurdish votes for him ? 
  this ultimate goal is simple , shift turkey to a more conservative society . 
  because this is his ideology . 
  he is a conservative . 
  he is a political islamist . 
  he wants to shift the country to this lane , to the islamist lane . 
  and since he has a wind behind him , he wants to solidify his position by using this wind . 
  and also almost like every politician , he wants to keep his power and his wealth . 
  he does n't want to be trialed because of his crimes and corruptions . 
  and also because of his ego . 
  he is not much cultured man , neither a emphatic one . 
  he just cares about his own ego and position . 
  erdogan is a really evil politician , one of the worst thing that happened to turkey in our history , but invations and genocides and massacres ? 
  let 's read the book correct . . 
  s-s-s-scandinavian ? 
  i am a bit scared now . 
  are you drunk ? 
  history has been lived , and future await to be lived , and what is the best way to live it rather than by sense of humour ? 
  i guess it was like this ; ** ring ring ** ** ring ring ** - sweden , can you answer the phone , i have to separate this plastic botttles and plastic bags for recycle . 
  if it is finland drunk calling , say him yes he is scandinavian for fucks sake . 
  well said . 
  geographicly , turkey have a small chunk of land ( something like 5 % maybe ) on continental europe , and have a population of almost 15 % lives on european soil ( mostly european part of istanbul , but something like 2 million on the other cities of thrace ) . 
  and culturally turkey is not that much europe of course ( and european culture is kinda a vogue discription too but to simplyfy think of france sweden spain germany poland and bulgaria melted in a pod ) . 
  the weird part is turkey neither that much middle east when you consider culturally . 
  beside sharing a common base religion , middle east is not much representing turkey either . 
  also the islamic behaviors is kinda different in turkey than middle east countries and i am not even counting the alawis and philosophical teology that rooted in anatolian land that doesnt have anything similar to middle eastern islam but that is a really deep and different topic . 
  simply turkey do not much share with me countries either . 
  that creates a dilemma . 
  turkey obviously is not european and not obviously for lots of peole but not middle eastern too . 
  and in the modern world no country has luxury to be a lone star eaither . 
  you this way or other way be a part of a larger group . 
  in the history , old turkish empire had a essential role in europe , its actions shaped europe and europes actions shaped the empire . 
  we can still track affect on balkans and modern turkey still have effect of balkans on it ( i am myself a quarter albanian for example ) . 
  and civilizations goals of young turkish republic also adds to this effects . 
  founder fathers and ataturk had chosen the path the western countries one have chose instead of eastern traditional way if development ( yes east of europe is not all stone age ) . 
  but cultures always have a moment of inertia . 
  you can not transform easily ( and also turkey never have to transform to be counted as a european country , turkish culture is unique and precious as any culture ) . 
  as i said this efforts ripped turkey from middle east further more . 
  turkey do not share same language with middle eastern countries , doesnt share the same nationalistic values , and progress path . 
  if turkey is not part of europe , than it is lonely . 
  because eventhough some europeans see us in this land as invaders , well the history is not that simple . 
  actually we were always here . 
  most of us always lived in this land , just under different jackets . 
  assimilation it is , and before post french revolution era , nationalistic ideas was not that strong . 
  we are decendants of greek , armenian , indiginous people of asia minor , slavics and countles more and also of course those migrated from the steppes if central asia too who is converted to another religion for lots of reasons ( obeying the authority , desire of having power , just because , slain , taxes , etc ) opps i had written so much . 
  well , for short geographically , turkey is a little in europe , mostly in asia . 
  culturally a little european , less than that middle eastern , basicly turkish . 
  if turkey must be considered somewhere in the geography of cultures , more logical to say european . 
  turkey is like a really weird and strange part of europe in my book, 
  no it is not . 
  europe is europe ( almost for sure ) . 
  almost certainly lower than russia . 
  i would bet for % 20 . 
  edit : i just saw the below survey . . that is something , 
  oh good , they have n't done the survey in turkey . 
  shame is averted this time ... yea , boo russia !, 
  trigger deactivated !, 
  nice move , 
  they can not hear us , there is not enough oxygen to sound travel through : /, 
  in case of taxation , u.s. 
  citizenship and resident alien ( e.g. 
  greencard holders ) are subjected to same practice . 
  so grencard holders pay taxes to usa eventough the reside and work abroad too . 
  already , in many cases greencard holder is almost a real usa citizen without right to vote and right to u.s. passport . 
  well , she is a she right now . 
  the weird part is she kept her male name after her surgery . 
  bulent is a pretty masculine name . 
  it was a little trauma when i was little and mom explained me why is she is like this . 
  https://youtu.be/rgxe83lxgjg you totally deserved this , buddy . 
  she is always on this dinners erdogan holds on his palace or somewhere annually with the artists and fames . 
  ( by saying `` artists '' do n't expect intellectual ones , only the pop culture and ass licking ones ) she really loves erdogan , seriously . 
  if autopsy of kurt indicates that he died due to tetanus , than it is a possibility . 
  suspicious indeed . 
  yea everyone knows that 72m muslims live in a 10 million country already . 
  gosh it is so hard to make ironic jokes nowadays without using '' / s '' . 
  we host almost same amount of muslims as sweden does so ... wait !, 
  since noone mentioned yet , for baguette 's sake ; `` neither holy nor roman nor empire '' btw , he was charles v , or carlos quinto , or as known in turkey , \u015earlken . 
  since tatars are driven away ? 
  but once you have this sweet extra missionary strenght and culture conversion cost reduction , it is so easy to convert those land and it pays its price . 
  safi trade node is important for sevilla . 
  merkel is doing really good for germany imo . 
  however i really like the system of the usa . 
  do your term for at most 8 years and than go on your way . 
  `` a 80 million pop country can find a replacement for you so you are not unique '' i probably think like this because of our current glorious leader ( first of his name , ruler of comars , god bless him ) is on power for 15 years now . 
  but still , it is a good system in my opinion . 
  alright , here we go . 
  thank you posts to greece and all the other things you would expect on this sub . 
  however here is the thing that must of you do not want to hear ; nisanyan is a very well educated and well serviced intellectual . 
  he created one of the best turkish ethimologic dictionary . 
  however he is a weird guy . 
  and as you all thought here , he is not sentenced to 17 years prison for being a opposition to government . 
  he is not even a real opposition and he is not even sentenced to exactly 17 years of prison . 
  the guy had a illegal construction . 
  before it , he literally throw his own shit to his wife . 
  he treated her wife couple occasions . 
  his illegal actions are cumulated . 
  and he is sentenced to prison . 
  and the total amount he needed to serve was only 3 years 2 months of this 17 years than he would be freed under promising that he wo n't commit another crime again .
