yes , it 's that speech . 
  and all your links have accurate translations of parts of his speech . 
  holy shit , the subtitles are absolute garbage . 
  literally no sentence is close to being an accurate translation of what any the mps or the speaker of the parliament say . 
   what the speaker actually says : `` mr enc\u00fc , you are out of time . '', 
   what the subtitle says : `` turkish mp : you signed your own death '' for context , the mp is talking about police and military brutality and how the government does nothing to stop it . 
  at no point does he say anything about armenians or greeks or any of that stolen land nonsense . 
   that said , i really dont think you should give them visa free travel when they have n't implemented the biometric passports , but having experienced eu border controls as a non eu citizen , they are a joke anyway . 
  we 've implemented biometric passports in 2010 and all older passports became invalid as of last year . 
   turkey , however , has become a problem . 
  a really big problem . 
  a week ago friday , turkish soldiers and police surrounded the offices of zaman , the country 's largest and by some measures best newspaper , fired tear gas , broke down the doors and seized control of the paper and its media empire with authorization from courts appointed by president recep tayyip erdogan and his party . 
  by sunday morning , the paper , known for its independent-minded columnists , was publishing the most anodyne form of government propaganda . 
  there 's no question censorship and denial of free speech are one of the biggest problems in turkey . 
  zaman , however , is the mouthpiece of the [ g\u00fclen movement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/g%c3%bclen_movement ) , or was i suppose . 
  those independent `` journalists '' were the biggest supporters of the akp regime up until a few years ago when akp and g\u00fclen broke up over distribution of the profits they gained through corruption . 
  this guy does n't know what he 's talking about . 
  you can force the bitrate . 
  press ctrl + shift + alt + s while the movie is playing , select the highest bitrate on the list in the middle , click override . 
  then rewind the video to the start . 
  i am not arguing the use of excessive force by israel , just pointing out the fallacy here . 
  the argument is `` turkish military has the capability to wipe out southeast anatolia , but does n't exercise it . 
  therefore , turkey , unlike israel , does not use terror . '', 
  does n't really make sense when israel has a much smaller area to deal with and the most perfect weapon for the job humanity has developed , no ? 
   unlike certain countries in the area * cough israel cough * turkey actually does n't terrorize people . 
  that 's a self-defeating argument . 
  israel military can just as easily kill every single person in palestine as ours can in southeast anatolia . 
  more easily , since they have nukes . 
   natos 2nd strongest military ca n't defeat the pkk well , this is probably true . 
  guerilla warfare is no joke . 
  it 's also the year galatasaray was founded , lol . 
  i 'll bet it 's better known than any historical event in turkey . 
  inflation/deflation is the rate by which the prices change compared to previous timeframes , whatever the reason for that price change . 
  say that the overall prices of goods in the economy rose by 2 percent , then you have 2 percent inflation . 
  if they fell by 2 percent , you have 2 percent deflation . 
  it does n't cause price changes . 
  saying prices can change without inflation does n't make sense , because inflation * is * the price change . 
  it is measured by putting together a basket of goods meant to be representative of the total economy and tracking the prices of those goods . 
  `` smarmy person '' maybe ? 
  literally , it means `` juvenile louse . '', 
  i have no idea why we use it that way though . 
  who ? 
  it 's pretty simple actually , but i added a link to my post that describes how it 's done on chrome . 
  or block cookies from the economist . 
  and his name is daniel jackson . 
  at least in this comment chain , you have n't said anything like that dude . 
  you ca n't just change your claims like that . 
  but anyway . 
  what `` some turkish people '' think or feel is irrelevant . 
  sure , the moral thing to do is take care of the syrians until they can safely return to their homeland , but a ) we are n't realistically capable of doing that and b ) we are as selfish as the next guy and do n't really want to . 
  it 's not as if the sentiment seems to be any different with the european peoples , otherwise why is there a whole migrant crisis ? 
  diplomacy , from what i 've seen , is a group of assholes trying to exert power on another group of assholes by using whatever leverage they have . 
  that 's the way it 's always been and no one is going to change that unilaterally , the least of all our shitty government . 
  our politicians are playing the same game everyone else is . 
  you can not expect to just offload your border patrol duties on us without giving us anything in return . 
   i know that you 're full on mode turkey center of the world everyone needs us but those refugees are yours and they should be hosted in turkey.in fact i wonder how those new syrian citizens would see the turkish government letting people drown on the mediterranean . 
  i 'm not sure what exactly your argument here is . 
  those refugees are being hosted by turkey . 
  as a matter of fact , we are hosting more refugees than any country on earth . 
  are you seriously accusing us of not doing our part ? 
  and in what way is the turkish government letting people drown on the aegean or mediterranean ? 
  the people who 've died chose , of their own free will and knowing the dangers , to illegally travel to greece with the aid of smugglers . 
  while tragic , turkey bears no culpability in it . 
  pretty sure these numbers are from [ this research ] ( http://www.wingia.com/en/services/end_of_year_survey_2014/regional_country_results/8/46/ ) that someone posted on this sub yesterday . 
  the question they asked is `` if there were a war that involved < country name  , would you be willing to fight for your country ? '', 
  our pm says they 've made the request . 
  us state department says they are still assessing if the documents sent constitute a formal request . 
  https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2016/08/260841.htm#turkey i 'd like to know how this process is supposed to work if anyone here knows about it . 
  * http://www.medyatava.com/tiraj * http://gazetetirajlari.com/ * http://www.medyaradar.com/tirajlar * http://www.canlitv.com/rating/?tur=gazete sabah is the second according to all of these . 
  it 's obviously the illuminati . 
  yours does n't ? 
  no , see my post [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4tt7th/erdo%c4%9fan_declares_state_of_emergency/d5k3asf ) . 
  only certain decrees can be made and these are specified by law . 
  everything else remains the same . 
  are you sure about this ? 
  from what i know , the administration can unilaterally declare a state of emergency , if certain conditions defined in the constitution are met . 
  the parliament only has the authority to extend it once the initial period is over . 
  edit : nevermind , i was wrong . 
  parliament needs to confirm it . 
   do you know if he / the government can dissolve the parliament now ? 
   or introduce new laws without the parliament ? 
  yes , a state of emergency gives the administration and the president ( which , in practice , will just mean the president in this case since no one is likely to object ) the power to introduce decrees that act as law . 
  they are submitted to the parliament for confirmation the next day . 
  i do n't know what happens if the parliament rejects them , but akp has the majority in the parliament anyway . 
  the types of decrees available to the administration are defined in the constitution ( or another legislature , i 'm not sure ) . 
  some of the important ones include : * establish curfews and ban protests/gatherings * conduct body or vehicle searches * ban basically any kind of publication ie . 
  books , papers , magazines , tv , movies , plays etc. 
   can he easily ban political parties ? 
  pretty scary stuff . 
  one of the first thing military did yesterday was take over the state television channel to force them to broadcast their statement . 
  the anchor was pretty clearly shaken up as she made the announcement . 
  part of the statement is that all media channels were `` ordered '' to broadcast that statement . 
  some did as ordered , some did without the sound ( props to them ) . 
  there 's a video on the internet of the assault where a military commander threatens to shoot when the journalists there request to ask questions . 
  in the 1980 coup , 937 films were banned , hundreds of journalists were sentenced to a total of 3300 years in prison , 300 were attacked and 3 were killed , no newspapers were published for a year , 40 tonnes of journals and papers were destroyed , 300 cases were opened for 13 major newspapers . 
  this is just the official report . 
  you are fucking delusional if you think there is anything resembling a media , free or otherwise , under military dictatorship . 
  democracy has never been about electing the most capable or fair leaders . 
  it 's about everyone having a voice in how a country is run . 
  most of the time , that results in populist douchebags in control because people are fucking stupid .
