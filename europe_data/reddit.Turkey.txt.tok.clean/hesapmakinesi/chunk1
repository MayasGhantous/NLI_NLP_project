  stupid one uppers . 
  everybody knows belgian beer is best beer . 
  probably they meant to draw inse belgium but it did n't fit . 
  or the artist was stupid and believed the term `` french fries '' from american english . 
  ah the good old latin phrase inversion . 
  parent meant industrial energy consumption . 
  probably multiple orders of magnitude bigger than what you can burn with vehicles . 
  turkish people know romania as one of the typical poor ex-communist countries . 
  there were a few famous romanian football players back in time . 
  there is a significant `` native '' gypsy population in turkey , so we are well aware of the distinction . 
  the politically correct term for a gypsy is `` roman '' while the term romainan is `` romen '' . 
  also there is a stereotype ( that i find disgusting ) is that eastern european girls are easy/sluts . 
  we do n't need that . 
  we can ask moderators to take action against such accusations . 
  [ h\u00fclooo ] ( http://youtu.be/b3ulsnqugao?t=15s ), 
  6m caliber would be bigger than [ these guns ] ( http://images.dakkadakka.com/gallery/2009/3/27/24764_md-apocalypse,%20titan,%20warhammer%2040,000,%20warlord.jpg ), 
  and * only * 800mm caliber . 
  afaik they not directly involved . 
  but hurriyet is owned by do\u011fan media group , which is a collection of different companies . 
  they quit serving akp propaganda anout 2 years ago , and i do n't know the exact reason . 
  here is my guess : quite a few turkish companies belong to g\u00fclen followers , and you can not simply avoid all of them and stay in the business world . 
  when the akp - g\u00fclen allicance started to crack a few years ago , they had to choose sides . 
  they are simply following money . 
  however , since akp is really heavy on propaganda and blatant lies , just serving news against them happens to be more on the side of the truth at the moment . 
  yes , zaman is directly owned by them , and their main propaganda channel . 
  i do n't know any realiable channels in turkish , save for english . 
  i suggest you to skim over multiple sources from different channels : hurriyetdailynews today 's zaman http://www.turkishpress.com/ are the 3 of them i can find . 
  yes , fethullan g\u00fclen is leading a `` religious charity '' movement sinde 1980s . 
  the turkish and european editions are certainly different . 
  the immigranst in europe have a lower level of education overall , and they cater to that market . 
  turkey edition used to be pro-erdo\u011fan a few years ago but then their business interests started to collide . 
  although i am more or less happy with their current stance , the reason behind is strictly business . 
  their political stance changes with the winds , however currently they are the most serious of the popular bunch . 
  that is awesome . 
  in my home country isps file criminal complaints . 
  belgium , luxembourg , switzerland : does not compute . 
  more or less the same in turkey . 
  single sex ones are long established , good schools . 
  on the other hand , most of these high quality schools quit being single sex in the last decade . 
  most of them were also boarding schools , so they had to do some dorm arrengements . 
  on the other hand , now there are some ideas to make regular schools single sex for the sake of it . 
  ah sad . 
  this reminds me , single sex schools are rare in turkey but our beloved ( ! ), 
  pm wants to convert a lot of existing schools to single-sex . 
  just some bloke who lived in several parts of eastern and western europe . 
  i have n't lived in czech , just went for visiting , but knew some cz people . 
  still i developed an affinity for you people . 
  i love the czech . 
  yeah , lived in nl for a while , your beer sucks . 
  happier on just the other side of the border . 
  i love you cz . 
  you are awesome . 
  but the order of the colours say belgium not deutschland . 
  more people should do that . 
  calling the police , i mean . 
  it is ironic that , few days ago police was ordered to withdraw from the square , and the whole `` mob '' sat there peacefully ; playing music , reading , and cleaning the streets . 
  violence restarted when the police came back . 
  off topic : i was in sarajevo and bjelasnica in 2005 and 2013 . 
  i love the people and the food . 
  the shitty part is , he sees he shot someone , and his first reaction is to run away . 
  it seems like an accident to me as well , but he should have never reached to his gun in the first place , he was not in mortal danger . 
  he is not fit for the responsibility of carrying a firearm . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0das16bs6jy if that does n't work , search for `` ethem sar\u0131s\u00fcl\u00fck '' . 
  you will see there are a lot of copies on youtube but most of them are taken down . 
  apparently someone has been busy online . 
  what gave you that impression ? 
  this should be the standard way of resolving conflicts . 
   it 's obvious that assad has no authority over the country anymore i wonder why . 
  i also wonder why local people run from rebel controlled areas to assad 's territory when they have the chance . 
  no , vpn providers and applications are blocked via `` antivirus solution '' of the company . 
  but i have my cell phone with data , which is not bad . 
  also i uploaded stuff to google play music , which is not blocked . 
  the fremen are used to traveling in harsh desert conditions . 
  i work for a german company , and all our internet connection is proxied through the company hq in germany . 
  that 's why i ca n't use youtube for music at work . 
  i know there are better alternatives but this is the way i used to casually enjoy it when i 'm choosing at a workstation and shit sucks . 
  duck you gema . 
  i do n't even live in germany and still have to suffer through your asshatery . 
   turkey   euromonies l\u00f6l, 
  you clearly mean realistic . 
  ah an opinion that acknowledges both sides of the conflict are shitty ? 
  get out of reddit !, 
  we need more kurds can not do wrong posts . 
  that is bullshit . 
  three women spotted naked in cihangir , the police intervened pretty much everywhere . 
  also why use water cannons on naked people ? 
  a few days ago there was a home brewing site shared in / r/turkey i think iyibira.com . 
  with it , there was a site selling home brewing materials but i can not remember that one . 
  still , wine and raki are easier to make . 
  edit : sihirlimalt.com, 
  good . 
  alcohol is fucking expensive in turkey . 
  making own `` bogma raki '' is the way to go . 
   but after 1984 happened suser here . 
  which event are referring to ? 
  handover to kanzuk ? 
  vodka bottle . 
  have n't got the memo ? 
  isis is literally the only thing standing between us and world peace !,
