  i didnt notice that , but still stupid comparison in my opinion . 
  greece , calm down . 
  why would anyone assume that people in europe know the flags of american states ? 
  well not everything has to be like in the west . 
  however 30 months seems exessive , but i guess thats akp and akps judges way of trying to show : hey see we respect atat\u00fcrk too . 
  masallah . 
  sorry , we dont have tea from the tap . 
  i will report you to tayyip himself . 
  i mean you 're usually offered tea for free everywhere , like when you 're in a shop buying shoes or after dinner . 
  you paid for cay ? 
  never been a fan of turkish coffee tbh . 
  we do drink black tea mostly . 
   uk : tea 3.5 kg are you even trying ? 
  edit : wait till you see how much bread we consume . 
  so original , remove kebab . 
  we dont need her to win , just to take votes away from erdogan would be sufficient . 
  when i posted this last week it was removed , could have been a karma millionaire now . 
  it 's so repetitive . 
  i 'm not coming here for pictures or at least not mostly pictures . 
  thats easy , all of that should be turkish ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  welcome aboard . 
  i guess if you live in eastern germany its the next best thing , whereas you have a couple of dozen cities to choose from if you 're from lets say nrw . 
  worth mentioning that a lot of people are moving to the big cities in germany and the rural population is declining . 
  it 's real . 
  in cologne . 
  so leipzig is a boomtown ? 
  first time i 'm hearing that . 
  i doubt that they are even close to the levels of rent you have to pay in cologne , d\u00fcsseldorf or stuttgart . 
  at least build something like this : http://www.koeln.de/files/images/urinal_800.zoom.jpg, 
  holy submission history . 
  there are lgbt akp supporter groups too : http://www.gabile.com/resim/haber/2108.jpg, 
  what you said in first post is wrong and insulting . 
  you cant just make a stupid statement like that and expect no one to complain . 
  at least think for a second before you make such a stupid , dumb post . 
  i 'm seriously angry at work right now . 
  u/ontyyy please show me a transgender singer sitting with a conservative politician in eastern european czech republic . 
  you are a moron . 
  you said in countries where the people are muslim they would be thrown from a roof . 
  guess what people are muslim in the countries i counted but they are not living under islamic law . 
  thats how wrong you are and ignorant . 
  its wrong , its ignorant , its stupid . 
  you have probably never been to a single country you just degraded . 
  you should leave the house once for a while or at least get out of your echo chamber . 
  your comment is pretty insulting . 
  who the fuck was thrown down a roof in turkey , bosnia , albania for example ? 
  i cant believe that something stupid like this is upvoted in here . 
  there are plenty of gay muslims in turkey or lebanon etc. 
  is this the same party that tries to remove the pkk from the eus terror list ? 
  thanks . 
  can you link me to it ? 
  why was it `` bombarded '' ? 
  there are more than 3 hours left and yesterdays march had up to 300k people joining it . 
  plenty of time left . 
  how may people have been killed thus far by the police ? 
  you can argue as much as you want about it but its derailing the comment sections every time . 
  gezi was a peaceful protest that turned violent because the police burned tents , pepper sprayed and tear gassed everyone . 
  you might remember the girl in the red dress ? 
  they were reading books to the police when the police decided to pepper spay them . 
  its clear who was at fault for the violence that followed . 
  https://adnanramin.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/istanbul-red1.jpg 7 people have been killed by the police . 
  one kid was hid with a tear gas canister in the end while he was buying bread and died a year later because of his injuries . 
  dont get me fucking started . 
  everyone in turkey uses a vpn , people get used to it . 
  necdet kent , the father of the current coca cola ceo saved a lot of lifes to . 
  he basically gave everyone who could say a full sentence in turkish citizenship . 
  those then turkish jews did not have to wear the jewish star on their clothes and were later evacuated to turkey . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/necdet_kent also not the first time jews from europe have been evacuated to turkey , the ottomans took jewish refugees from spain when they were dipsered and persecuted over [ there ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alhambra_decree ), 
  thought this was worth mentioning since everyone is blaming turkey without knowing any of the details . 
  you might not know him , bad he did some really bad things . 
  it doubt it would make a big difference if someone else was in place of erdogan . 
  the turkish position is clear and i think most of the opposition parties agree with it . 
  who decided that hamburg or any other city was a good place for a g20 meeting ? 
  better to keep it remote . 
  that looks delicious . 
  send some my way . 
  i remember seeing ads on mtv about her house arrest when i was younger . 
   in december 1997 in siirt , erdo\u011fan recited a poem from a work written by ziya g\u00f6kalp , a pan-turkish activist of the early 20th century . 
  [ 43 ] his recitation included verses translated as `` the mosques are our barracks , the domes our helmets , the minarets our bayonets and the faithful our soldiers ... '' [ 29 ] which are not in the original version of the poem . 
  erdo\u011fan said the poem had been approved by the education ministry to be published in textbooks . 
  [ 44 ] under article 312/2 of the turkish penal code his recitation was regarded as an incitement to violence and religious or racial hatred . 
  [ 45 ] he was given a ten-month prison sentence of which he served four months , from 24 march 1999 to 27 july 1999 . 
  [ 7 ] due to his conviction , erdo\u011fan was forced to give up his mayoral position . 
  the conviction also stipulated a political ban , which prevented him from participating in parliamentary elections . 
  [ 46 ] he had appealed for the sentence to be converted to a monetary fine , but it was reduced to 120 days instead . 
  [ 47 ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/recep_tayyip_erdo%c4%9fan#imprisonment, 
  the poem in question btw :  erdogan was sentenced to a ten-month prison term for reciting a poem during a public address in the province of siirt in 1997 :  `` the minarets are our bayonets the domes our helmets the mosques our barracks and the faithful our soldiers . '', 
   `` one thing that i can not digest , if the skies and the ground were to open against us . 
  if floods and volcanoes were to burst upon us , we are those who are proud with the iman of our ancestors , they never kneeled down to frightening things any day , deeds of glory , deed of anatolia , from malazgirt til canakkale , faith impenetrable to fortresses , our ancestors rushing from one victory to another , this is unity and togetherness . '', 
   poem by ziya g\u00f6kalp [ source ] ( http://www.amara.org/en/videos/shiyp0uvt9ac/info/tayyip-erdogan-poem-that-landed-him-in-jail/ ), 
  we got you caretta caretta : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c4%b0ztuzu_beach, 
  not like europe put pressure on him before the refugee crisis . 
  i volunteer !, 
  the downvotes are hitting my turkish comrades pretty hard in the comments . 
  many assyrians for example returned to turkey due to the conflicts in iraq and syria as far as i know and have build some really cool churches around mardin . 
  so yes , in a way he was expelling christians from gallipoli . 
  ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ) just not the ones op means . 
  skyland with almost 293m https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_tallest_buildings_in_turkey, 
  people were threatend and killed for suggesting so . 
  turkic people : just passing through the region . 
  no need to pay attention to it .
