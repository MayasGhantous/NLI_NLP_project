  write a book ? 
  please , you give him too much credit . 
  one difference is that we 've had these before and no one expects them to be permanent . 
  they can get them from your local isp . 
  they just have to match the requests to the domain with the times of your posts . 
  do you know the actual arrest number ? 
  i 've read 6000 . 
  but maybe its gotten higher . 
  dude it was 940 years ago , fucking viking times . 
  give it a rest . 
  i do n't know about you but i go to work on a bus . 
  why would you put coins in your wallet . 
  super annoying to sit on and they can bend your credit cards . 
  do n't you have pockets ? 
  more trustworthy than random tor nodes to be honest . 
  i 've tried to dl some attachments with tor , but i get viruses instead . 
  to be fair the originals might have been viruses as well but i doubt it , they said receipt and things like that , the mails themselves looked legit , but tor returned zip attachments with exes in them . 
  i think the prevailing conspiracy theory is that they are both cia puppets . 
  which is pretty preposterous for wikileaks , gulen not so much . 
  he certainly has relations with the cia . 
  they love the work he does in central asia . 
  puppet is a bit of an over simplification though . 
  i 've tried searching their previous releases too , too fucking hard to find anything substantial . 
  half of them are article forwards . 
  some of them make for interesting reading , but its public intel , nothing special . 
  there might be something interesting in their releases but it 's a lot of work to sift through this shit , not something you can really expect of the average private citizen . 
  it 's an allegation about a consultancy firm that apparently scams investors by taking companies public with inflated valuations . 
  there are allegations of bribery at the courts . 
  no connection to the legislative or executive branches is implied . 
  it is addressed to the media and the government . 
  it 's a ~ ~ rather speculative ~ ~ ** crazy ** conspiracy theory about ~ ~ the relationship between the pkk , turkish intelligence and the cia ~ ~ ** pretty much every actor in the middle east ** . 
  ~ ~ while it makes for an interesting read , ~ ~ i believe akim@akparti.org.tr is a public relations email linked to a form on the web . 
  the senders name is also not familiar and a cursory google search does n't reveal a public person . 
  the closest is a faculty member of erciyes university 's media/communications/cinema dept. 
  but this is probably some random crazy , i would disregard any mail to akim@akparti.org . 
  we still have plenty of poor and uneducated people left . 
  you can guess who they vote for . 
  looks like a non turbo jet engine . 
  i think you should look a bit closer at who the bulgarian prime minister is . 
  looks like komshu has their own version of erdo\u011fan : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boyko_borissov#allegations_of_corruption_and_connections_with_organized_crime, 
  russia has 80 times as many warheads as pakistan and icbms that can hit any major target in the world . 
  pakistans max range is 2500 km . 
  so no pakistan is only a major local power . 
  if russia had no nuclear and space program it would still be a waning regional power . 
  but since they have the capability of delivering nuclear doom to any point on the planet they are a major global power . 
  calling it a weak power is just underestimating the enemy . 
  experiences are had not made, 
  i 'm pretty sure scottland would be a net contributor . 
  question is what currency does scottland go on ? 
  i suppose switching to euro seems like a good idea if you get independence , even if it 's only until you get your own currency . 
  yes . 
  germany . 
  no , nothing to do with it at all , 
  you do n't fool me swamp germany, 
  not ragging on dw but they still have to be paid by someone , if it 's the government or private donors , you ca n't expect good journalists to work for free , they need to make a living too . 
  i do n't think there is much antisemitism left though . 
  you would be pretty safe . 
  sorry but that math is no good . 
  there is no way of knowing for sure if the people who did n't vote were leavers or racists . 
  you assume that none of them are . 
  bad math . 
  maybe the solution is to deport criminals to their home countries regardless of eu status once convicted instead of getting angry at all immigrants . 
  maybe one can even try to rehabilitate some . 
  especially for minor stuff like drug possession . 
  germans !, 
  not following rules !, 
  globalization is inevitable , all you can do is slow it down . 
  the eu definately needs an fbi and a financial police too . 
  you should see how much that lake has dried up in the last decade . 
  i do n't know if it 's global warming or what , but there is a lot more salt and a lot less lake there then before . 
  not to mention russia, 
  thank you, 
  he wants to control the narrative . 
   government snooping as is tradition, 
  maybe your friend is right , i do n't know . 
  it 's not very effective either way . 
  we already have a dozen or so [ wooden horses ] ( https://www.google.com/search?site=&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=971&amp;q=truva+at%c4%b1&amp;oq=truva+at%c4%b1&amp;gs_l=img.3..0l3j0i30l7.1511.2963.0.3210.9.9.0.0.0.0.134.961.1j8.9.0....0...1ac.1.64.img..0.9.953.0cnj5yd6k7q ) in various parks around the country , feel free to hide in those if you think it will do you any good . 
  we swear we wont burn them or anything . 
  as much as i hate the akp , i do n't think this is intentional , its probably just too much demand on the infrastructure . 
  apparently you have been replaced by belarus, 
  am i the only one who prefers interlingua ? 
  what about the usa ? 
  they might be interested in a 51st state . 
  maybe by 2084 we can without irony say , oceania has always been at war with eastasia . 
  the overwhelming majority of the turkish public is quite antisemitic though . 
  and it goes beyond just dislike of israel . 
  http://global100.adl.org/#country/turkey/2015 ultimately though , there is a grudging respect for jews compared to arabs who the turks also dislike . 
  so unless they are super religious sharia supporting types turks will probably prefer an alliance with israel over one with arab states , especially considering the parallels that can be drawn between kurds and palestinians . 
  i do n't know too much about spain . 
  but my understanding is that the greek crisis can be traced back to a fraudulent application to join the eurozone . 
  the correct action is to ensure the corrupt politicians , bankers and auditors responsible for the fraud are in prison and then forgive some of the debt . 
  which is pretty much what happened to germany . 
  why ca n't ni just be an independent country in the eu ? 
  haha , so true . 
  it 's not like the other outlets are better though . 
  just in case someone has n't : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37ihswa1swe bonus : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvrn-gkzvyi, 
  i like how the contrails distort but not completely obscure the texture of the water . 
  i was talking about europe . 
  the european elites are jealous of the situation in america . 
  because the whole point is to stoke xenophobic reactionism in the working class so draconian laws can be passed to create illegals that can be hired cheaply .
