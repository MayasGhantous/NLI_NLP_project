  i though it was the fully nude beaches that were special . 
  shh , you 're going to give the russian ideas . 
  well at least in all those other countries your shit lands in water instead of on a porcelain shelf . 
  i mean really , not only does it cause a stink but you end up having to clean the toilet after every use because the shit always sticks to the dry porcelain . 
  you really do n't need to inspect every poop you take . 
   if you sit on the cold surface , you 'll become impotent . 
  that sounds like an old wives tale . 
  but i think anyone can appreciate a heated toilet seat on a winter morning . 
  i think those bidets are stupid . 
  the old fashioned ones that shoot water from the bottom up into your asshole those make sense in that : it 's quick and you do n't have to get your hands dirty , shame they are so hard to find nowadays . 
  this is just a waste of space and time . 
  they did , from the article : `` he served his sentence for burglary , robbery , and murder in a prison system near the russian city of yekaterinburg . '', 
  ah so you are like the romanians , who like to brag that they were never really a part of the empire , just a vassal state , which is not exactly the reality . 
  tricks on you , it was an aids bagel . 
  thanks, 
  what kind of specific workers , the article mentions welders , surely it is n't all that complicated to retrain as a welder ? 
  you should link the other post then . 
  i have n't had a computer for a couple weeks , i 'm curious as to what happened with that pro corruption law . 
  you see the mistake you are making is refering to a specific dish as k\u00f6fte . 
  it 's a generic term for several dishes that involve ground meat in a solid shape . 
  cevapcici is [ ineg\u00f6l k\u00f6fte ] ( https://duckduckgo.com/?q=ineg%c3%b6l+k%c3%b6fte&amp;t=ffab&amp;atb=v53-5&amp;iax=1&amp;ia=images ) , what you guys call cufty is similar to [ izmir k\u00f6fte ] ( https://duckduckgo.com/?q=izmir+k%c3%b6fte&amp;t=ffcm&amp;atb=v53-5&amp;iar=images&amp;iax=1&amp;ia=images ) ( meatballs baked with potatoes in tomato sauce ) , additionally you have [ ak\u00e7aabat k\u00f6fte ] ( https://duckduckgo.com/?q=ak%c3%a7aabat+k%c3%b6fte&amp;t=ffcm&amp;atb=v53-5&amp;iar=images&amp;iax=1&amp;ia=images ) which is similar to cevapcici but they are round and flat instead of finger shaped , [ kad\u0131nbudu k\u00f6fte ] ( https://duckduckgo.com/?q=kad%c4%b1nbudu+k%c3%b6fte&amp;t=ffcm&amp;atb=v53-5&amp;iar=images&amp;iax=1&amp;ia=images ) which has rice in it and is dipped in batter before being fried and [ i\u00e7li k\u00f6fte ] ( https://duckduckgo.com/?q=i%c3%a7li+k%c3%b6fte&amp;t=ffcm&amp;atb=v53-5&amp;iar=images&amp;iax=1&amp;ia=images ) which is dough made from rough bulgur filled with ground meat and either pine nuts or wallnuts and then either deep fried ( these are shaped like a handegg ) or boiled ( generally spherical ) , among others . 
  as you can see , it 's a generic name for multiple dishes , like pasta or stew , not a specific dish . 
  all your slavic problems could be solved if you used our naming scheme of : [ placename/female body part ] k\u00f6fte instead of the diacritic mess you have now . 
  imagine it : prague k\u00f6fte , silesian k\u00f6fte , lady 's left toe k\u00f6fte , the possibilities are endless . 
  gustav klimmt was a right winger ? 
  til, 
  we call those things k\u00f6fte , specifically ineg\u00f6l k\u00f6fte . 
  perhaps the balkans should adopt that word , that way you do n't have to worry about \u0107 / \u010d confusions . 
  also the name of their country roughly means silverland . 
  there 's gold in them there hills . 
  there is an entire genre of games called idle , where there is hardly anything to do except watch numbers go up . 
  yeah , that 's just fastfood , you can get that anywhere they have a domino 's . 
   everything has to be perfect  but it still is n't perfect :  use the wrong ~ ~ pronounce ~ ~ pronouns . 
  a slingshot can be plenty dangerous , not the most lethal of weapons but you will often see anarchists firing them at cops at large protests that turn violent as a response to tear gas . 
  of course an actual sling is a more effective lethal weapon , i remember listening to a lecture or a podcast or something where someone was mentioning that it was actually goliath who was the underdog because at the time a sling was pretty much the height of technology . 
  i expect it will be turned into a university some day . 
  no one should live in a building that large . 
  you got to do the rest of the poem too , you do n't even have to change it : *************************** nothing beside remains . 
  round the decay of that colossal wreck , boundless and bare the lone and level sands stretch far away . 
  depends what you mean by treated well . 
  the vast majority left in the city is pretty old . 
  some of those can look pretty bad , also some are clearly being overfed around my parts . 
  i know three obese stray dogs . 
  i think this is almost a form of abuse , even though the people mean well . 
   people overuse that term these days not really , it just acquired a negative connotation because of hitler and fell from use . 
  it 's being used more often now because wwii is wearing off and also quite a few people have much better access to information nowadays . 
  propaganda is a pretty broad term . 
  there are numerous activities and actors that can be associated with it , so you can have both state and private propaganda that encompasses anything from printed media to staged events . 
  advertising is not easily distinguishable from state propaganda in it 's methods and pr goes beyond advertising . 
  no one but the person who writes an article can truly know if it is honest opinion or propaganda . 
  you can make educated guesses but separating opinion from propaganda is a hard problem . 
  it 's also complex , sometimes an article is a mixture of fact , opinion and propaganda . 
  you ca n't use labels themselves to discern truth , how people use a particular word does n't really matter as long as people understand each other . 
  do n't just be insulting without adding to the conversation . 
  this is just needlessly divisive , i half expect people like you to be paid for it . 
  relevant user name . 
  i think that 's great , donald trump is the asshole of the republican party spewing bullshit out of his mouth anus . 
  it 's provocative , it gets the people going , it 's also fairly accurate . 
  the swiss one is pretty good too . 
  the others i 've seen were pretty low effort imo . 
  i 'd like to see a british version . 
  ideally using the trump tweet style but not the accent . 
  i would nominate david mitchell . 
   nobody complains about , for example , diplomatic imunity uh , are you sure ? 
  i am for a certain measure of diplomatic immunity , but really not far beyond that afforded to private citizens of foreign nationality . 
  i certainly do complain about the standards that we have now that allow blatantly illegal activities like weapons and drug trade , rape and even slavery to occur under the guise of diplomatic immunity . 
  you should n't be able to imprison a diplomat , but you can kick them out ( and prevent them from entering not just that but any country other then their own ) , often they get to stay for diplomatic reasons and are n't prosecuted , and i for one complain about that . 
  so your argument is invalid . 
  i thought you guys wanted to be second , whats all this about winning ? 
  are you collecting signatures , because you need to collect signatures . 
  not everyone can go to a protest , but they can sign a paper . 
  it also makes the goals of the protest clear as sunshine so they ca n't pull , the they have no concrete demands trick ( though it would be very difficult in this situation , i 'll bet you a beer they will try before it 's over ) . 
  he was n't hung by the regime , he was lynched by an angry mob of civilians . 
  to be fair the regime would have probably hung him , but they were n't too pleased with the lynching . 
  it would n't have been because he criticized the young turks , that 's stupid , it would have been for treason as he was helping the british occupiers . 
  no more so than the early xxi . 
  well obviously orthodoxy in romania is older than the ottoman empire . 
  i 'm hardly an expert on romanian history , my point was it probably has little to do with communism and a lot to do with orthodoxy . 
  moon runes sound almost fake . 
  my understanding is that the cyrilic alphabet was developed by greek missionaries when orthodoxy spread to bulgaria . 
  so who made the romanians christian ? 
  was it the serbs ? 
  i would have thought the romanians became christians before the russians/ukranians . 
  the rus were pretty late to the party . 
  i seriously doubt that it has all that much to do with soviet influence . 
  you had orthodoxy in common with the russian empire prior to the soviets existing . 
  and before that , during ottoman times , your ruling elite would have graduated from the [ phanar school ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/phanar_greek_orthodox_college ) , where they might have picked up some slavic words from their bulgarian classmates . 
  i think part of the problem is that people do n't understand that parties represent their members not their voters . 
  far too many people have no party membership , do not chose delegates , do not vote in primaries , and then expect the party to magically come up with candidates they are willing to vote for . 
  this is in no way unique to romania . 
   the additional people need to actually contribute through employment or enterpreneurship but they do . 
  it 's like you think every immigrant is a lazy freeloafer who sits at home until it 's time to cash the government check . 
  or perhaps you think if half of them work and the other half claim benefits , the ones who claim benefits cancel any gdp gains from those who work . 
  but it does n't work that way . 
  a person who does n't work does n't add to the gdp , but they do n't subtract from it either . 
  when a person consumes something it does not get subtracted from the gdp . 
  that thing that the freeloader consumed , still had to be produced and is part of the gdp . 
  plus how do we even know this is n't just some random guy they picked up and tortured until he said what they wanted to hear . 
  i 'm not saying this is what happened , perhaps this is the guy , i certainly hope so . 
  but whenever i wa n't something to be true i try to be extra skeptical before believing it .
