  going to the other one would have been a more epic march as the crowd would have had to cross the bosporus , but it would have legitimized that place . 
  of course crossing the city would have also upset people by blocking traffic and the government would have been reluctant to allow it . 
  but i just really hope that if we ever get a change they will sink that monstrosity and build a better one further west . 
  so basically the eu4 map . 
  i do n't get the anti teleprompter circlejerk . 
  anyone can memorize a speech . 
  it 's not that big of a challenge . 
  it just takes time , time that could be spent doing something much more meaningful and useful . 
  so of course a he is going to use a prompter , any politician that does n't , either ca n't afford it , or is an idiot not worth voting for . 
  and who the hell delivers a speech without practice ? 
  i see the same circlejerk in american politics . 
  it 's petty , almost always hypocritical and generally off-putting . 
  it sounds like the name of a pop song in english . 
  i was once elected class president as a joke . 
   long and hard i see what you dick there . 
  while his diploma might very well be a forgery and what he says is tailored to an audience that has very little if any formal education , and while he lies through his teeth and flip flops like a fish on the deck , he does speak turkish well . 
  he is actually one of the better orators among recent prime ministers/presidents . 
   look what sub you 're in . 
  english is n't a first language of many users here . 
  the guy made a couple of typical german mistakes , i corrected them . 
  i do n't get angry when germans correct my german . 
   as a native english speaker i am also a native english speaker . 
  obviously that does n't mean shit , seeing as we disagree . 
   `` argue '' can be used that way . 
  do n't be ridiculous , without a preposition to argue something is to argue for something or to argue about something , but never to argue against something . 
  he clearly should have used dispute instead of argue , included the word against , or negated the object with do n't as i suggested . 
  open a dictionary . 
  i know i am right . 
  fyi : argue does n't work that way in english and wagon is archaic and is n't used in that context . 
   i argue , however , that the capitalist bourgeoisie *** do n't *** drive ~ ~ s ~ ~ such ~ ~ wagons ~ ~ *** cars *** . 
  man owns property/leases his brand all around the world , of course he is a globalist . 
   that ~ ~ german ~ ~ ~ ~ austrian guy ~ ~ potato, 
  i do n't think it 's fair to single out the germans either . 
  what is even a `` modern '' genocide . 
  the armenians should be wary of people trying to use their tragedy to wash their hands of their own sins . 
  oh yeah you westerners are all above this shit . 
  it 's not like it 's happened at previous g20 and g8 summits or anything . 
  the term [ agent provocateur ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agent_provocateur ) is french ffs . 
  we did n't invent the tactic , and it certainly is n't unique to our intelligence services . 
  these types are tolerated purposefully because they can be used to delegitimize peaceful demonstrations . 
  why would you fight back though ? 
  you know what i do ? 
  i do n't carry anything too valuable on me . 
  i hide most of my money in an account that is n't accessible over atm . 
  if someone wants to mug me , they can have maybe 50-100 euros , that 's not worth risking injury for . 
  sounds like a very creative vacuum cleaner salesman to me . 
  what ? 
  we signed the customs union in 1995 , cyprus became a member in 2004 ? 
  are you trying to trigger me ? 
  the customs union was sold to us as a stepping stone to full membership . 
  hardly anyone in turkey is actually in favor of it . 
  we have a trade deficit with the eu . 
  granted it 's not much but you get more out of it than we do . 
  do n't pretend like it 's some gift . 
  oooh a threat from a random french person on the internet . 
  so scary . 
  we 'll pack up and leave immediately , who cares about national interests , it 's the opinion of some edgy redditor that matters . 
  eh , the production quality is considerably better in the turkish show . 
  i suppose the writing is more or less on par though . 
   this is blatant occupation of eu territory maybe you should n't have admitted an occupied territory to your union then . 
  how stupid was that ? 
  why should anyone take the eu seriously when it ca n't resolve a border dispute in 14 years ? 
  the wahhabi clerics and the royal family are deeply intertwined and intermarried . 
  this `` al saud holding the wahabis in check '' narrative is inevitably brought up whenever the regime is critisized , but it 's very much up to debate if there is any truth to it . 
  even if they are trying to hold the wahabis in check then they are doing a piss poor job of it . 
  the truth is closer to : the members of the royal family are n't all that religious but they are willing to work with these regressive assholes to hold on to their power . 
  given the choice between democracy and theocracy al saud will always pick theocracy . 
   they are one of the richest countries per capita no , they have a nominal per capita income of 20k , basically about the same as greece . 
  the ppp is much higher , but that 's because oil is dirt cheap and there are no taxes , this will change when they no longer have oil . 
  at that point they would be lucky to have the economy of spain . 
  i do n't know , gosh . 
  but mozart was from austria . 
  maybe they thought it was the border between latvia and lithuania . 
  people who wish for others to be pointed at ought to have eyebrows raised at them . 
  dude your flair says jenoside when you hover over it . 
  what do you expect ? 
  the sun is n't doing anything wrong , it 's that damn shadow that is insulting dear leader . 
   diamond of \u0130stanbul given the state of the project , by the time that diamond of istanbul is completed , if it is ever completed , it probably wo n't be the tallest building . 
  folkart is n't the tallest building in turkey currently though . 
  that would be the sapphire tower in istanbul with 261 meters . 
  fun fact about sapphire is that it 's base in a valley so it actually looks completely unimpressive compared to the all the other skyscrapers nearby even though it 's significantly taller than all of them . 
  what ? 
  the date generally associated with the arrival of oghuz turks in anatolia is 1071 , the battle of manzikert . 
  they had , of course , arrived a bit earlier and it would be some time before anatolia would be conquered in it 's entirety , but this battle is seen as decisive . 
  the genocide did n't begin until the very late 19th century when the ideas of the french revolution made it to the territories ruled by the osmano\u011flu family . 
  after a particularly brutal repression of an independence movement in bulgaria , a group of revolutionaries calling themselves the young ottomans tried creating a multi ethnic national identity when they took power in what would be known as the first constitutional period in 1876 . 
  the constitution they drafted equalized muslim and non muslim citizens before the law , special taxes were abolished . 
  they were rewarded by a regressive arab revolt and a declaration of war by russia in 1877 who saw both turkey 's weakened state and the opportunity to gain territory and influence by saving the orthodox minorities from oppression disappearing . 
  the russians won the war and together with some of the ottomans former christian subjects ethnically cleansed the balkans and the caucasus of nearly a million muslims . 
  thus the next group of revolutionaries , the young turks , saw multiculturalism as a failed experiment . 
  still very secular and keenly interested in westernizing the country , they sought to make the country more homogeneous like the nation states of europe . 
  this meant religious minorities had to go . 
  the process started before 1915 , the date commonly associated with the armenian genocide . 
  the hamidiye corps were founded in 1890 , intended to be the turkish counterpart of the cossacks . 
  they persecuted christians , mostly armenians in the hamidiye massacres between 1894 and 1897 . 
  ultimately it took until the 1960s for turkey to become 90 % muslim . 
  most of the religious minorities that survived wwi left after the wealth tax in 1942 or the istanbul pogrom in 1955 or reciprocal violence during the coup in and subsequent turkish invasion of cyprus . 
  you clearly know nothing of our history . 
  you just have hate in your heart and a big mouth . 
  pfft , organic immigration is a scam .
