   i do n't intend to come across as hostile . 
  then why use the word scaremongering ? 
   how can you doubt it when you do n't even know what country i 'm from ? 
  because it 's merkel 's sincerity regarding the refugees is what i 'm doubting in that sentence . 
  what did you think that i was doubting ? 
   fairies may exist , but that does n't mean we should put energy into the thought . 
  i understand being prepared for some unlikely scenarios , but there is a limit . 
  this can easily be taken as hostility as well . 
  do you really think that the welfare queen meme becoming commonplace is as unlikely as fairies existing ? 
   it is n't like for example america ( no bad intentions by the way ) where such a topic is much more polarised this just comes off as arrogant . 
  the welfare queen meme was created by reagan in the us . 
  do you really think belgians are just so much smarter than americans that they wo n't fall for the same shit ? 
  not falling for the same shit is often a matter of studying previous instances . 
   this just sounds like low level speculation . 
  it is speculation . 
  what exactly is low level speculation ? 
  another adjective that can be interpreted as hostility . 
   thirdly , your post is written as a fact , which it is not . 
  fair enough . 
  what 's with the hostility ? 
  even if i am wrong are you sure i 'm the enemy here ? 
  it was a warning . 
  plenty of things people think ca n't happen end up happening . 
  the media can change people 's perception rather quickly , and it 's not like only poor people can vote to get rid of safety nets . 
  i do n't know what country you 're from , but i doubt that for example , merkel let in so many immigrants because she 's a softy , people seem to forget she is a right winger . 
  i 'm pretty sure getting rid of the welfare state is the long term plan . 
  why be angry at me instead of being vigilant ? 
  get ready to have your social safety nets destroyed by the `` welfare queen '' meme . 
  some of your most racist poor people will vote to lose their entitlements just so the foreigners do n't get it . 
  the main opposition party is objecting to a total of 2.5 million ballots . 
  there are at least half a million without stamps from the polling place according to fox , and as i said there is video footage from the previous election of people lining up with empty ballots and getting paid . 
  you do n't get it . 
  the ballots need to be prestamped on the back at the polling place , so someone ca n't just stuff the boxes with extra ballots from the outside . 
  the stamp is different for each polling place . 
  it 's not about which stamp the voters use . 
  let me give you an example of what can happen : - government prints a few million extra ballots ( they 've done this in atleast the last few elections they printed nearly twice as many ballots as there are voters ) - some of these ballots are stolen by party members and stamped with yes - poor people are paid , or threatened by their boss with being fired if they do n't vote yes . 
  - they have to go to the polls with a ballot already marked yes , put that in the envelope and bring the empty ballot they got at the polls back to the party building if they are getting paid or to their boss if they are avoiding being fired . 
  this seems to be the case . 
  in fact there was video of people bringing empty ballots and being paid during the last election . 
  if the ballots are stamped with a polling place specific stamp and/or signature on the day of the election it becomes much more difficult/impossible . 
  this is what is meant by ballots missing stamps . 
  also it 's not very scientific , but of the 12 boxes i 've independently tabulated for an ngo so far , only one had a majority for no , and out of the ~ 3000 votes in those boxes the result is 69 % for no . 
  so there might very well be fuckery in the official tabulation . 
  exactly , his wife and children are sultans . 
  in the last general elections , they posted soldiers at the polls in the kurdish east . 
  that 's how he won the last general election , through intimidation in the kurdish areas . 
  most of the rest of the country did n't change their vote after the election erdo\u011fan did n't like the results of . 
  also they made it difficult for kurds to even get to the polling places . 
  it 's actually governor . 
  to me it just reminds me of how a friend of mine from antioch recieved some home made rak\u0131 with an unusally low amount of aniseed , which resulted in me getting plastered , projectile vomiting and getting a hemorrhoid . 
  it 's very nice i hear though . 
  it 's got the oldest church in the world ( though really it 's just a cave with a stone altar ) . 
  personally , i would prefer a federal system so the more religious places can ban alcohol or whatever without impacting the rest of the country , but the country is n't so easy to divide as you think . 
  there are sizable minority opinions on both sides . 
  this is also true for the kurds , there are 3 million kurds in istanbul alone . 
  in the end the vast majority of turks regardless of conservatism/secularism do n't even want a federal system let alone division . 
  we should be able to compromise , it 's unfortunate that erdo\u011fan is so uncompromising and divisive , especially after it became clear exactly how much of our taxes he was stealing during the 2014 corruption scandal . 
  i think much of the rigging happens in rural areas . 
  i did n't witness anything here , but i was n't an observer , i only voted . 
  i believe a lot of the syrians are in antioch where despite a large native alewite and christian population the result was yes . 
  just right now a [ cacerolazo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cacerolazo ) protest has started in my neighborhood . 
  i 'm going to my balcony to bang some pots . 
  they also gave a whole lot of syrian refugees citizenship in a hurry . 
  the only silver lining in all this is that depite all the rigging and manipulation all they could muster is 51 % . 
  most turks in america come to go to college . 
  most turks in europe came as guest workers ( to work in coal mines , steel factories or as domestic servants ) . 
  a majority of the ones that went to germany were not literate . 
  the newer generation is literate * but they are overwhelmingly unemployed since all the jobs that their parents did are now in poland or china . 
  this has caused a lot of social problems . 
  \\* not very literate mind you , their parents were hardly the most qualified to raise multilingual children . 
  what you will often see is the parents talking to the children in turkish and the children replying in german ( or dutch , whatever ) which is a terrible way to raise a multilingual child . 
  the result is you have kids who ca n't speak either language well , but rather some new mashup language . 
  the correct way is to have the child identify a language with a particular individual .
