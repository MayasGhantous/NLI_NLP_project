  what do you call that ? 
  i call it fucking hypocritical . 
  do the most basic reading on a subject before calling people out . 
  europe spent decades sheltering and supporting pkk members that would go on to blow up schools , kidnap teachers , and literally kill tens of thousands of people . 
  you are in no position to talk . 
  i doubt they ignored it outright , i think it was just a case of incompetence . 
  anyways , new evidence has come to light that some major police chiefs were directly involved in dink 's murder , not just a look the other way kind of thing but a planning and supplying thing . 
  luckily they are being prosecuted . 
  dink 's death really was in my opinion one the most heinous murders in 21st century turkey , he really was an awesome dude . 
  you are right in that i 'm painting with a broad brush , but my point is that bulgarian turks were speaking turkish before the ottoman empire collapsed and after as well , thats why they identify as turks . 
  the core of this population traces its history back to early ottoman conquests . 
  of course there are exception as well , but those are exceptions . 
  your right too , tons of muslims from the balkans would later become turks , but regardless i do n't think its fair to say that all european muslims would became turks , some did and some did n't . 
  i would agree that all muslims in anatolia became turks . 
  greek , georgian , armenian , or assyrian speaking muslims are all turks today ( same goes the other way as well , turkish speaking christians are now mostly greeks , armenians , georgians , etc. ) . 
  however this is n't really the case outside of anatolia . 
  bulgarian muslims identify as turks because they are mostly decedents of turkish speaking settlers from the 15th century . 
  turks in bulgaria came from the outside . 
  however places that got converted , i.e. 
  albania , are firmly rooted in their pre-ottoman identity . 
  not really . 
  muslim anatolians would form the core of the modern turkish identity . 
  refuges from the balkans and the caucuses would later integrate and become turks but that does n't equate to `` all muslims ruled by the ottomans became turks '' . 
  it also was n't so much out of a lack of national identity then being forced out their countries . 
  the arab states despised the ottomans by the 19th century though and pretty firmly rooted in their arab identity . 
  expect for albanians , bosnians , syrians , iraqis , egyptians , etc. 
  you verbatim gave the exact same argument that turks give about the armenian genocide , and for good reasons , both situations are similar . 
  i think its best to leave the matter to historians , the majority of which have concluded that both are to be considered genocides . 
  i beg to differ , literally anytime turkey is mentioned someone brings up the armenian genocide , and i feel like anyone that uses this site can vouch for that . 
  anyways , books on the population exchange .

  maybe in russia it is , but i promise you as someone who is studying history in canada and is from the caucasus the level of material on the two subjects is not comparable . 
  everyone knows about the armenian genocide , no one about the circassian one . 
  i remember spending a year in high school social studies learning about various ethnic cleansing and genocides , and the armenian was about 4 months of that , what happened to people in the caucasus 's was not even mentioned . 
  i have had to do research of the subject , and it is extremely difficult because of the lack of material , were as there are pages of books on the genocides in anatolia . 
  i do n't see how its relevant to the topic at hand , but here you go some good books on the topic , let me know if want any other suggestions .

  if erdogan is brown then so is stalin , considering they are both ethnically georgians . 
  unless you mean muslim = brown . 
  and trump did an interview recently were he talked positively about erdogan calling him a strong leader .

   the caucasus ai n't a joke the caucasus have really been a gong show for the past 500 years . 
  georgians , circassians , armenians , chechens , dagestanis , etc , have all been through forced assimilation 's , ethnic cleansing , genocides , invasions , famine , destruction of their cities and nations , in just the past 2 centuries . 
  its all the craziness of the balkans on steroids . 
  i really think more should be written about what these people went through . 
  no one learns about the circassian genocide , the forced expulsion of chveneburi ( how my family and our sultan erdogan made it to turkey ) , the soviet expulsion of the ingush , etc. 
  polls show only 8 % of turks supporting isis , vast majority view them negatively . 
  the russian plane was bombing turkmens hundreds of kms away from the nearest isis controlled territory , was n't doing much against isis . 
  source for the mayor ? 
  again though , turkey had already made its roe clear , if any non-allied aircraft entered through syria it would be shoot down , and they had communicated this with the russian ambassador and putin a few weeks before , putin then said the violations would end . 
  they broadcasted the warnings on an internationally recognized emergency channel though , you ca n't just turn that off and then complain that you were n't able to receive it . 
  it 's ridiculous that you blame turkey for being unable to communicate when their were civilian airline pilots which knew what was happening but the russian pilot did not . 
  and sure a visual warning would be nice , but in 2012 turkey had made it clear that it would n't be doing it after its own plane was shot down . 
  i do n't want a plane that was just doing a bombing run flying over my airspace that 's for sure . 
  well it 's because they turned off their transponder , which is extremely reckless when flying in an active warzone . 
  turkey had it clear ( since 2012 ) that border violations would result in downed aircraft . 
  i agree it was an overreaction , but if anything the irresponsibility is on the russian end . 
  why is that a dutch and a lebanese airline pilot heard the warnings , but the russian pilot did n't ? 
  no downvotes from me bud . 
  is it not irresponsible to ignore countless warnings , not install the equipment needed to intercept internationally recognized emergency channels , and go into turkish airspace while having just bombed turkish backed turkmen ? 
  yeah no one seems to get it . 
  we could n't stop the pkk from crossing the border for two decades what makes people think we could stop is ?!, 
  hell even the americans ca n't control their southern border . 
  i would n't be too surprised . 
  the numbers are probably inflated , and your never 100 % sure who is actually going to syria ( these are people not allowed into the country , you never actual know what they where planning on doing , it 's not like tourism to turkey is rare ) , so the actual number of is bound members is probably lower . 
  but nonetheless there are shittons of people coming in , it 's ridiculous . 
  turkey has actively deported 2000 people to europe , that 's 2000 people on just turkish soil that where caught , imagine all those that got through . 
  also , there are tons of people coming from china and south-east asia , these numbers are not just european muslims . 
  armenialiberty.org surely an unbiased and objective source . 
  for a second i thought you were calling us gypsies and was sad . 
  pretty much all southern europeans have their blood boiling 24/7 , but thats all a part of the charm . 
  well its a video from rt , but ignoring that , as the map shows there were limited bombing runs against isis , but the majority was not directed at isis . 
  turkey has had limited bombing runs against isis as well , but we can both agree that isis has not been turkey 's main focus , and neither has it been for russia . 
  well much of your narrative is simply incorrect . 
  greece and turkey could be considered allies , but thats exactly why these violations are not taken seriously be either side and are treated as war games . 
  russia and turkey have never been allies , that is clear to any russian or any turk . 
  [ russia was never bombing isis its focus has been always been on anti-assad rebels ] ( http://www.vox.com/2015/10/7/9471271/russia-syria-bombing-map ) . 
  in fact the area in which the plane was taken down was controlled by fsa/turkmen rebels both of which are fighting isis , its territory is n't even close to isis held land . 
  to play the role of turkish devils advocate , i do n't see how its ridiculous . 
  is he not right is saying that they are not comparable situations ? 
  turkey violates greek airspace that is certain and something which i am not a fan of , but there some missing context in that statement alone . 
  greece also violates turkish airspace , and through these mutual violations there has become an established rules of engagement in regards to the aegean . 
  these two nations use these violations as quasi war-games , and do n't pretend like its just turkey doing it . 
  on the syrian border there is an active and extremely violent conflict which also has seeped itself into southern turkey . 
  turkey has lost is planes very recently over syria , and afterwards made it clear that in regards to syrian/turkish airspace the rules of engagement have changed , and that it would not tolerate airspace violations coming out of syria . 
  this is pretty logically , you never know what could be coming out of syria and what its intentions could be .
