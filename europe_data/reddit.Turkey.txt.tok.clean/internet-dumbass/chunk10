  lies . 
  this is our national pastime . 
  plus , why are blonde people not a race ? 
  blondoids ? 
  or people with curly hair ? 
  so ridiculous . 
  have you read that ? 
  it only says it 's a `` possibility '' . 
  even israel 's alleged ethno-bomb was deemed a hoax . 
  haha , suckers . 
  everyone knows you 're supposed to discriminate against romas . 
  does this have any relation to `` mongol '' ? 
  except this guy giggles like a little bitch while idi amin has a jolly belly laugh . 
  alright , here 's a really unpopular opinion ; there are a lot of unnecessary european countries . 
  for example austria should be absorbed by germany , belarus by russia , sweden-norway-denmark should be combined into a single country ( i do n't believe there is ethnic hatred between them to the point of violent conflict ) and such . 
  hey , stray dogs are pretty cool . 
  they make the place more tolerable here . 
  you can say black . 
  `` hi , / r/whiterights123 here , and please pay attention to our deranged ramblings ! '', 
  why is it something to be thankful for though ? 
  i have n't seen contractors get thanked , ever . 
  not really surprising , casual homophobia is pretty common around the world . 
  we hate them for their freedoms . 
  they think `` it 's a nice thing to say '' . 
  why they do n't say it to literally any other profession is beyond me . 
  `` thank you for taking my order ! '', 
  thank you !!!, 
  nope , none of that . 
  about time , let 's dust off our imperialism engines and rock . 
  i think he means dismantling israel 's government . 
  i would n't mind if that whole area was simply called `` the holy land '' with a secular/abrahamic constitution that is neither jewish or arab . 
  we could cut some tension here and there . 
  that way everyone will get to stay and are free to go in or out . 
  eehhh , he 's just some confused ultra-nationalist . 
  been there , done that . 
  he just ** loathes ** muslims because he sees them as the antithesis of his in-group . 
  i guarantee you he 's insecure inside . 
  interesting that he 's so egoistical though , he called me a savage eastern barbarian ( yup ) but when his original account , neutralgreek was banned he said it was the fault of everyone else , not that he was an insufferable cunt . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ internet ^ ^ ^ ^ psychoanalyst ^ ^ ^ ^ out, 
  it 's really just whatever fits your argument at the time . 
  dude was abused by his parents , got plastic surgery , used steroids and played cod `` to train '' . 
  what a fucking joke of a man . 
  so much for being an \u00fcbermensch . 
  his messiah complex would be interesting if he did n't murder dozens though . 
  no no , they wanted white people freed . 
  did n't matter what nationality they were . 
  i was just giving an another example for him but i guess mine hit a nerve . 
  i understand the irony but not europe . 
  it means vaguely being slav-ish-y . 
  why would it be demeaning/racist/funny though ? 
  it 's probably some soviet sympathizer , do n't the west have these guys everywhere ? 
  likewise , friend . 
  civilized and savage are both ** heavily ** linked to 19th century racism so to say . 
  it 's naive to think this was anything different . 
  ] ( http://www.docstoc.com/docs/8303274/the-israel-projects-2009-global-language-dictionary ), 
  also bizarre how europeans demanded the ottoman empire that it free all white slaves and make it illegal to enslave white people . 
  blacks were fair game . 
  i do n't get the photo ... 
  i am always impressed with my pathetic life when i manage to piss someone off to that degree . 
  [ especially posting this , i had many people raging after watching this . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=pfsvcqbybgy#t=68 ), 
  if you think this is only about gaza you 're not seeing the whole picture at best and willfully misinterpreting at worst . 
  it 's clearly implied . 
  but then we go to even worse areas , how violent/sexual does it have to be to be illegal ? 
  where is the line ? 
  but it 's supposedly on a public bus so it might . 
  what i 'm saying is violence or sexuality etc does n't offend me and i assume a lot of people as well but they are banned either way . 
  it 'll be the rejected if it offends certain people , got it . 
  so people can put literally anything they want there as long as they have the money ? 
  the american way . 
  that hotel probably had irish terrorists in it . 
  it 's ok . 
  i do n't know , hate speech ? 
  you think everything would be dandy if people saw `` help the oppressed , not the dirty lying jews !, 
  seemed like they were just being childish to me . 
  hard not to be when you have mother west spoonfeeding you everything i guess . 
  i do n't even know how that horseshit got approved or nobody got sued over it . 
  it is largely agreed that it is `` because of western tradition '' . 
  have you watched the entire thing ? 
  she literally went there and saw how they were living . 
  now it 's not seeing it but living with them . 
  if she had roma neighbors you would switch to `` i 'm talking about the real roma !, 
  she was lucky ! '', 
  also i do n't get this , we 've got 500,000 roma and we 've had absolutely no problems with them , ever . 
  this is exclusively a european problem . 
  maybe , just maybe not everything is their fault . 
  reminds me of the `` help the civilized man , not the savage ! '', 
  propaganda in america . 
  also nearly a million iraqi deaths . 
  no moment of silence or a nice sad looking snoo logo for those guys . 
  i do n't , we disagree . 
  you went from being skeptical of their racism to saying it 's fine . 
  something 's off . 
   i think anti-nationalism is inherently bad because it is inherently predicated on morality from intellectuals and not from the people . 
  really ? 
  what makes postnationalism itself any of that ? 
  are you saying `` the people '' ca n't be postnationalists ? 
  anyways , i do n't even know why i 'm arguing you 2 weeks after i made the op . 
  address the entire post . 
  because their concept of ethnicity is their skin colour and they most likely want to get away from blacks that they do n't like much let 's say .
