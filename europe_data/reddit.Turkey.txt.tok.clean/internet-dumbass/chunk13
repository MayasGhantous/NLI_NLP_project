  if voting actually did something it 'd be illegal . 
  whether it 's for petrodollar or not , the west decided gaddafi had to go , period . 
  they 'd get that man even if he literally dropped a nuke on every capital in this world out of self defense . 
  if he was an obedient dog like the gulf arabs he 'd have been just fine . 
  he did not . 
  we already it for centuries . 
  do n't let some bogus news articles fool you . 
  do n't forget that nato would effectively hook defenseless ( either by choice or necessity ) in and keep influencing them so to say . 
  also i do n't know why you are downvoted , this is a pretty chill discussion . 
  that 's wrong too . 
  they are in nato . 
  they could have 2 guys with wooden sticks and it 'd still be ok . 
  well yes , apparently stormfront goes in here once in a while . 
  it not only sways people 's opinions but also makes closet racists feel comfortable as well . 
  again : there are no such things . 
  it was just . . there . 
  as i said it 's like saying `` this guy invented bread !, 
  yes . 
  that is the hoax i was talking about . 
  it was n't `` invented '' by anyone . 
  at least not that we know of . 
  this is like saying `` who invented bread ? '', 
  yeah . 
  your girlfriend and you are totally perfect . 
  fuck anyone else . 
  because we have to act according to our genes . 
  you are kind of saying you ca n't think for yourself . 
  seems like a troll to me, 
  i can confirm this . 
  i want no white males ( women , where they at ? ), 
  in this world and i 've not stepped a foot outsi - nope , ca n't do it . 
  you funny guy . 
  no it 's not . 
  please stop perpetrating this hoax . 
  we 've had that shit for centuries . 
  dude , wars and massacres do not equal immigration . 
  the heck are you taking ? 
  til immigration = literally 1492, 
  propaganda from your point of view . 
  i do n't agree with most of what they say either but i think it 's nice to see what they want to say . 
  emphasis on say . 
  they might not be trying to inform the reader but rather just state their own opinions . 
  nah , although that 's pretty significant most turks here and / r/turkey are atheists . 
  i also see americans get shit on pretty frequently . 
  the only non-euros that do n't get bombed are the rare japanese or chinese and such . 
  it 's obviously more than islam , that 's just used as an excuse . 
  i did n't know you were asking me about the invasion : i i just assumed you were asking me what / u/goshuk was saying . 
  it 's just used as plural you . 
  more of a metaphor/in joke than anything . 
  it 's well known that turks ( or maybe just non-euros ? ), 
  get a disproportionate amount of downvotes here . 
  probably that and the kktc flag is even worse in this regard . 
  where did you get that \u00ed from you are worst turk it 's \u0131 . 
  in this context it means `` your regiment '' ( alay = regiment - \u0131n\u0131za plural your ) . 
  it 's the flag . 
  indeed . 
  he cries like a bitch when it 's palestinian girls or syrian refugees being harmed but does n't even say anything when it 's turkmens or tatars and he uses arabic and persian words over turkic words on purpose . 
  not happening , sorry . 
  our government is much more interested in being wannabe arabs . 
  that does n't seem enough . 
  we should make clothes out of their skin and necklaces out of their testicles . 
  we have some too , they are called the balkans and the arab world . 
  i had a bad feeling about this law . 
  `` look guys we are so progressive and nice lalalala oh shit '', 
  man , i am his exact height ( 170cm ) and that would truly kill me inside . 
  of course i wish i was taller but over time i got used to my height and nowadays i 'm ok with it . 
  those shoes are the signs of a man who is n't one with himself . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ internet ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ psychoanalyst ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ out, 
  probably nothing since i 'd most likely get assassinated the first day , `` who the fuck is this new guy ? 
  if everyone is cool however i get 72 virgins with chocolate and cocaine fountains . 
  or just become dan bilzerian with his own country . 
  oil is running out ? 
  when and how ? 
   the crown dependencies is this what colonies are called these days ? 
  plus we had this conversation enough times already . 
  children and adults unable to work included !, 
  get more people with this exclusive deal !, 
  [ i found this dude ] ( http://www.youtube.com/user/maksat89able/videos ) while looking for mutually intelligible languages to turkish and you can understand him perfectly . 
  it takes some to figure out little letter differences like zhuru ( kazakh ) and y\u00fcr\u00fc ( turkish ) . 
  this is probably due to a level of russian influence on kazakh and arabic + persian influence on turkish . 
  you can even understand kipchak from codex cumanicus from the 12th century . 
   the codex is generally regarded as accurate , but it differs slightly from other sources on kipchak language . 
  for example , the codex 's pater noster reads :  atam\u0131z kim k\u00f6ktesi\u00f1 . 
  amen !, 
   in english , the text is :  our father which art in heaven . 
  hallowed be thy name . 
  thy kingdom come . 
  thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven . 
  give us this day our daily bread . 
  and forgive us our sins as we forgive those who have done us evil . 
  and lead us not into temptation , but deliver us from evil . 
  amen . 
   in turkish , the text is :  atam\u0131z ki g\u00f6ktesin . 
  i 've looked into a lot of them . 
  from the karamanlides in greece to the salar in china . 
  also it 's `` gagauz '' , coming from either g\u00f6k o\u011fuz or kaykaus . 
  not exactly . 
  they were used multiple times by the us to cleanse communists ( i 'm talking massacres and tortures numbering 100,000 s ) during the cold war . 
  their coups were hell on earth and nobody who actually experienced them wishes it . 
  they were only required for a single year because they were ** very ** efficient at this .
