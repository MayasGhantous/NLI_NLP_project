  that 's their life and things are more complicated than that . 
   the fascist view of a nation is of a single organic entity which binds people together by their ancestry and is a natural unifying force of people . 
  i generally agree with you , my previous statement was influenced primarily by this ^ . 
  i do n't see that here . 
  although you use language that i consider inappropriate ( go back to for example ) thank you for not throwing a tantrum . 
  they can think of themselves as anything they want and no one can challenge that , period . 
  really ? 
  that 's certainly not what i 've been hearing around here . 
   no they do n't . 
  if you put down roots in a country it 's your duty to assimilate . 
  not doing so weakens social cohesion and hurts the entire country . 
  fascism 101 i 'm not calling them names or anything by the way , this is literally fascism . 
   they have every right to not assimilate/integrate as long as they pay their taxes , do n't get in trouble ** and know german ** . 
  is this why i 'm being downvoted ? 
  does nobody read what i just said and throw tantrums filled with xenophobia ? 
  how does that validate your terrible statements ? 
  do you think that was appropriate ? 
  what is german culture exactly ? 
  every person should be able to embrace any culture they want . 
  why did you delete your comment then ? 
  maybe it was deleted by the mods since it 's a horrible comment . 
  [ context if people care . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/turkey/comments/27fxbo/turkish_false_flags_and_the_invasion_that_almost/ci0g6xz )  as for you , / u/heberden , you lost whatever right you may have had to be taken seriously as a neutral redditor when you shared your lack of intellect and disgusting discriminating views by referring to a whole nation of human beings as ` inferior and inbred ' . 
  if you want to talk about respect , perhaps you should first familiarize yourself with the god damn concept of it . 
  i disagree . 
  they should be treated equally regardless of background . 
  they can worship the sky for all i care . 
  it 's their inalienable right . 
  maybe this attitude creates divides between the natives and immigrants . 
  americans do a lot of things wrong but you need to look at them if you want to do this right . 
  are n't you the same guy who said this ;  it is the reason why you are and always will be such an inferior and inbred nation i do n't understand you guys : s, 
  i think discrimination against turks is a big problem in europe but i ca n't sympathize with these guys if they support akp . 
  they have every right to not assimilate/integrate as long as they pay their taxes , do n't get in trouble and know german . 
  [ no one can get enough of this gif . 
  we tried , they told us to bugger off because protection of christians north africa oil israel sick man of europe blablabla . 
  it used to be illegal to wear it in government buildings i reckon , akp is changing all that in the name of religious freedom while banning alcohol and blocking porn sites . 
  there 's still a stigma to wear it in west coastal provinces but more and more women turn to islam , not only by oppression either . 
  i guess it 's their identity like being a hippie . 
  my mother wanted to cover herself and go all out muslim but my godless nationalist grandfather convinced her to not do it , she described it as a phase in her adolescent years . 
  i know . 
  i went to a g\u00fclen school . 
  their grunts are idiots , sure . 
  g\u00fclen himself is one creepy motherfucker though . 
  it 's actually a poor man 's clothing . 
  i assume it 's pretty cheap since every man over 50 wears it here . 
  yes , they have schools all over the world . 
  the said friend 's father is one of these guys and he 's one of the most incompetent businessmen i know . 
  he had more than 3 businesses go to shit and `` found '' money again to try again for the 4th time . 
  right . 
  why ? 
  i 've not met anyone who takes him seriously , we joke about him . 
  i guess that 's the good thing about american imperialism , as long as you do n't directly or indirectly impede their ability to make money they do n't care what you do . 
  how about men and women or blue eye vs green eye ? 
  nice , any other sorts of trauma ? 
  not that i 'll take your word for it anyway , just pullin your leg . 
  that was an embarrassment , let 's leave it in the past . 
  although i 'm suspicious this would n't surprise me if it was true . 
  my friend went to canada as a missionary , all expenses paid by fethullah g\u00fclen 's cult , they also bought our house ( that can take about +10 students ) and turned into a hotel a few years ago to colonize my town so to speak since we had very small amount of g\u00fclen cultists . 
  that dude ( and the saudis ) needs to be stopped . 
  that 's some intense bullying you 're going through my man . 
  hang in there . 
  opposite happened to me , i used to be quite hateful but when i was the victim of such hate i said `` no one should have to experience this '' . 
  guess it depends on your personality . 
  i mean , you made this account solely to bitch about migrants . 
  got beat up by a few black guys and now you 're frustrated i assume . 
  you 've got no idea , i could n't list the things i 've been called without hitting the character limit i bet . 
  why would a turk go to europe ? 
  white women . 
  i have not had any arguments in / r/europe frankly . 
  i am told to fuck off/go `` back '' to asia/that i 'm beyond ridiculous/i 'm a far-right nationalist/i 'm a far-left communist/i 'm an eastern barbarian/i 'm a typical muslim/i 'm a degenerate/i 'm without logic/i 'm a shitty person/i 've got an instinct to commit genocide/i invented turkish toilets etc etc. 
  fun fact : i 've heard all of those here directed at me , fun times indeed . 
  man sometimes this sub seems straight out of the 19th century . 
  it 's more like an exchange of insults and emotion than ideas . 
  i did n't invent shit ( ha ) . 
  i generally dick around on the ` net . 
  [ you invented democracy ? 
  that 's fucking cool . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi8jbzsqzzy ), 
  this is probably a word you are familiar with , pathos . 
  i bet you did n't even read my previous post , you just did n't see an apology and immediately got defensive . 
  had it happen a lot , nothing special for me . 
  [ i can sling pictures like this all day long . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/persecution_of_ottoman_muslims#mediaviewer/file:dourmouche,_a_boy_wounded_and_hand_cut_off..png ) i knew you could n't say anything but `` deaths = literally genocide :( '' . 
  mistake is mine for wasting my time on having a genuine debate . 
  sigh , why the fuck do i have to deal with people chanting genocide the moment they see a turk ? 
  i prepared my stash because of the sheer amount of apology demands i get . 
  alright , the genocide olympics have started . 
  ready , set , go !, 
  [ forced displacements and deaths ( lower right ) . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/persecution_of_ottoman_muslims#total_casualties ) to start off , nobody is saying massacres did not occur . 
  we are saying they both occurred and if turkish deaths are not recognized we do not believe we have any obligation to do anything else . 
  the christians of the time were heavily biased against muslims ( true to this day ) . 
  these were the same people that could n't grasp how black people could have a civilizations of their own . 
  do n't trust them . 
  if what you claim are genocides , this was a genocide too . 
  them citations though . 
   conscription of greek men was supplemented by massacres and by deportations involving death marches of the general population . 
  [ citation needed ] greek villages and towns would be surrounded by ottomans and their inhabitants massacred . 
  [ citation needed ] this is all from the greek side by the way , they claim it was a deliberate attempt while the turks claim they simply deported the greeks and did n't give a shit what happened after . 
  100,000 s of turkish soldiers died of starvation and hunger , you ca n't expect a state to supply potentially hostile groups before their own soldiers .
