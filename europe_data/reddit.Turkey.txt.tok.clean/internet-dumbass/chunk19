  i do n't think people are worth anything because you ca n't and should n't try to measure a person 's `` worth '' . 
  they might own things that are worth things though . 
  this is how we moved forward as a species and will continue to do so . 
  years ago slavery was the norm , mandatory working to keep yourself alive will also ( hopefully ) cease to be a norm in the near future . 
  call me lazy , a pussy or whatever . 
  and no offense but you did n't seem to think this through , why would the other party accept this ridiculous exchange ? 
  our opinions seem to be on the opposite sides of the universe . 
  i 'm a postnationalist . 
   it 's their fault they do n't like gore or ca n't handle it ? 
  yes . 
  these are not simply some lunatics going around cutting heads or bashing people in the ear with a hammer for fun . 
  these are the realities of war and i think everyone should at least consider watching these . 
  again just a personal opinion for what it 's worth , i just think people need to have a special spot for footage like this . 
  collateral damage is n't just a number . 
  it 's things like these . 
  to where ? 
  it 's not even captured enemies , it 's suspected enemies . 
  it 's neither your house nor your money . 
  a better comparison would be a some guy risking his life and going to a village of a few ten thousand people and requesting help because where he came from is hell on earth . 
  instead of lending a room and some bread or what not you tell him to bugger off . 
  also are you willing to deport / `` send '' austrians who harm `` you '' away ? 
  really ? 
  child rape = collateral damage ? 
  these are the realities of war that need to be shown everywhere ( you can argue that child rape is the reality of some priests etc , apples to oranges to me ) . 
   basically this thread could have been a platform for discussion on the basis of an article but here half of the commenter have n't even seen the content that started this thread and likely should n't . 
  this is the fault of the commenters , not the video . 
  this is really the only way we can show the optimum amount of respect to the victims , whatever that means to you . 
  at least their deaths ( and hopefully injuries ) are documented . 
  i thought it was more of an emotional thing than pure shock , you know ? 
  anecdote , i used to go `` ugh that 's a split skull ! '', 
  instead of actually understanding what the fuck is going on in the video in the first place . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ now ^ ^ ^ ^ that ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ put ^ ^ ^ ^ it ^ ^ ^ ^ like ^ ^ ^ ^ this ^ ^ ^ ^ it ^ ^ ^ ^ sounds ^ ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ ^ lot ^ ^ ^ ^ like ^ ^ ^ ^ pseudointellectual ^ ^ ^ ^ jargon ^ ^ ^ ^ but ^ ^ ^ ^ still ^ ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ ^ get ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ idea, 
  do n't know if you are playing with me ;  desensitized = make ( someone ) less likely to feel shock or distress at scenes of cruelty , violence , or suffering by overexposure to such images . 
  no , this video can hit harder more than graphic violence to people desensitized to violence . 
  this did n't really shock me , i got emotional personally . 
  it was indeed very surreal to me as well , i 've seen stuff like this in my dreams and always felt off for the next day . 
  this hits on an emotional level , i 've seen mexican beheadings and skinnings and were n't affected but this confuses me . 
  also a lot of screaming and general unpleasantness , that can hit harder for people desensitized to violence . 
  oh sure . 
  i feel like i am running into a wall every time i talk to you . 
  it 's suffocating and pointless . 
  i am at fault for making the mistake of trying to talk to you as an involuntary member of a group you do n't like . 
  let 's leave this pleasantly . 
  i 'd like to understand you more but i do n't think this drama should continue any longer , let 's just agree to disagree until we inevitably meet again . 
  you 're off your damned mind my man , that is what i 've been trying to tell you for the last 2 weeks . 
  your deranged ramblings are worrying and morbid . 
  i 'm not talking about religion or what not , i am talking about your blatant insults filled with rabid hate . 
  [ let me open up your memory . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/26dl21/the_sister_of_toulouse_gunman_who_murdered_7/chqasdq?context=3 ) fortunately this was deleted by the mods , surprised you 're not banned . 
  `` just fuck off '' `` a typical muslim defending a barbaric religion '' etc insane rant, 
  i reported his comments and either the mod erased them or he deleted them after getting downvoted , he 's the usual nutjob . 
  he also created and mods / r/islamunveiled . 
  again , you 're the one saying `` because of every possible reason . 
  '' ( which you were ridiculed for as well ) . 
  of course you do n't agree with me thus consider my arguments flawed , what are you expecting ? 
  agreeing with a typical muslim ? 
  says the guy who downvotes me , tells me to have another downvote then tells me to fuck off to asia . 
  oh ok , we lost the death olympics then . 
  [ it is estimated that during the last decade of the ottoman empire ( 1912-1922 ) when the balkan wars , wwi and war of independence took place , close to 2 million muslims , civilian and military , died in the area of modern turkey . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/persecution_of_ottoman_muslims#deathtoll ) i wish you could be this skeptical about christian deaths . 
  has any government recognized the muslim & turkish genocides ? 
  if christian deaths were genocides muslim deaths were too . 
  either both are genocides or neither . 
  let 's just call them massacres and be done with it . 
  in the lower right it says `` deaths ( millions ) '' . 
  http://i.imgur.com/owgrudn.jpg also i do n't think i did any colonising , i am a guy who 's on the ` net , you still have no idea about the situation though . 
  god damn it can i have one conversation without one these `` genocides '' flung in my face, 
  yeah , no . 
  these are humans not cattle . 
  jews and turks will stay if they so desire . 
  question still stands . 
  they will stay , what else ? 
  deportation ? 
   in october 2009 , it emerged in newspapers such as the times , the telegraph and the daily mail , that new labour had engaged in intentional demographic genocide against ethnic british people for political gain come on . 
  [ similar article from the same guy who made this claim . 
  ] ( http://www.standard.co.uk/news/dont-listen-to-the-whingers--london-needs-immigrants-6786170.html ), 
  we 've got about 500,000 roma here , they are all settled and nice people . 
  they are stereotyped as jolly musicians ( [ like this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/romanlar_%28istanbul%29.jpg ) ) and not child mutilators ` round here . 
  pretty sure it 's da joos . 
  cost of living is appropriately priced i assume . 
  not like they 'd get a buck per comment either , way more likely it 's less than $ 0.001, 
  [ hoooly shit , you were n't kidding . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/27081o/pirate_bay_cofounder_peter_sunde_arrested_in/chw8z6v ) bullshit like this seems to come up way more often in / r/europe than anywhere else . 
  i do n't know why we torment ourselves and visit this subreddit , i 'll just leave so lunatics can jerk each other . 
  because it is murder , do you not grasp the significance of these actions ? 
  you are literally deciding people 's lives . 
  why would you remove it ? 
  well , ( one of ) my teachers were a 33 year old women who had literally never drank alcohol or smoked because she was so sheltered , stranger thing is she was not covered , another one was a g\u00fclenist since they are trying to colonize my town . 
  not trying to get in on discussions when you have nothing to add is a good one . 
  if it 's all you 've gathered from the ` net , please keep it to yourself . 
  i get you want to add something , i get you are angry when you see bombings ( who is n't ? ), 
  etc but please for the love of everything you hold dear you are just being another problem . 
  as a turk i have this shitty government , akp , fethullah and his cult , the future of the country , my own freedom of movement ( god forbid i want to leave da shitskins come !! ), 
  and so on . 
  and now there are clueless europeans spewing absolute bullshit , please try to understand the other side . 
  it 's probably not enough to make a living out of unless you literally never stop working . 
  i assume they get paid per comment . 
   and taking the moral high ground when you 're a minority being discriminated against is at the very least ... difficult . 
  i am the one living in a muslim country mate , % 90 of people i know are muslims . 
  i know shiites , alevis , sunnis , salafis and so on .
