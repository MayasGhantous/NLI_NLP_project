  '' , what about it ? 
  leave it to this internet guy to decide the fate of millions and analyze complex societies . 
  [ reddit or stormfront ? 
   multiculturalism is a naive and dangerous concept !, 
  when you say this , you 're kind of being a racist bigot . 
  maybe you 've heard it so much you just ignore it now instead of looking into why you might be called that and prevent it by either realizing your position or start using political lingo . 
  maybe it 's because americans see physical differences more than ethno-cultural ones . 
  i mean sure , some euros do n't like non-white people as well but still , i remember an american soldier going `` why are these white people killing each other ? '', 
  during the bosnian genocide . 
  next time do n't make such condescending and confident statements if you do n't know much . 
  the point is , this armenian thing is n't the only bad thing we 've done but many people seem to cite this as the sole thing we are responsible for . 
  we got rid of any failed rebels and successful rebels got rid of us , da uhrmenian jenosid seems to be especially stressed for some odd reason , it 's not just you . 
  most likely because armenians take every chance to mention it unlike greeks who most likely are not obsessed with something that happened a century ago because they 've got something else going for them . 
  why not subsidize that then ? 
  cheap and subsidisation for living in the middle of nowhere ? 
  oh alright they are completely ok then . 
  nope , it got way more heat after the french revolution . 
  you only mention the armenian `` genocide '' because it has the most pr going for it . 
  we got rid of all ( failed ) revolting peoples ( otherwise they got rid of us ) but why only armenians ? 
  because it 's the highest death count ? 
  by the way , are you armenian ? 
  who are you ? 
  i was responding to / u/ramblinrambo . 
  lol incoherent cussing . 
  kind of embarrassing , no ? 
  i understand it 's hard to keep your cool against such a blatantly spineless person but still , you got ta keep it cool son . 
  errr , i 'm an atheist ( lol crypto-muslim am i right ? ), 
  and i 've been arguing islamists and religious people in politics for a long while . 
  i just know your ulterior motives , you do n't just dislike islam , you hate , loathe everything that is n't white christian/atheist and i hate irrational rabid racists more than i `` hate '' irrational religious people . 
  oh i knew you were massively racist , i just did n't know you were this immature and classless . 
  i thought you 'd play into the whole `` i 'm just race-conscious/i 'm seeing reality as it is ! '', 
  thing . 
  i knew you would lash out eventually . 
  not even mature enough to have a discussion without mass downvotes and insults thrown around , pathetic . 
  wow , you 've hit an all new low . 
  yup . 
  as i said , it 's arbitrary . 
  `` etc. '', 
  no , wahabbism is relatively recent . 
  i 'm not going to debate history with you ( i do n't mean this in a condescending way , i 'm just tired ) , just do research from an objective point of view and not an emotionally charged one and you 're good to go . 
  no berlusconi ? 
  damn , that man is beautiful . 
  wat from your source ;  the fact or condition of belonging to a racial division or group ; the qualities or characteristics associated with this . 
  more example sentences  a group of people sharing the same culture , history , language , etc. 
  ;  an ethnic group : we scots were a bloodthirsty race then, 
   im not racist but ... you 've got to be doing this on purpose . 
  you literally have no idea what you are talking about . 
  blaming religion for the current issues is simply unproductive . 
  i do n't like islam either , but complex geopolitics and such are going to be considered before your mindless babbling . 
  it 's actually just not being a dick . 
  wikipedia and whatever source they gave . 
   race is a classification system used to categorize humans into large and distinct populations or groups by anatomical , cultural , ethnic , genetic , geographical , historical , linguistic , religious , and/or social affiliation it 's meaning has changed significantly over time and it will continue to change . 
  race has no exact standard definition by the way , race can be literally anything you desire . 
  it 's more commonly used for cultural and physical classification of humans though . 
  it 's arbitrary . 
  you 're mate , you just rationalize your fear .

  oh snap i live close to greece , guess i slept through it . 
  did n't the current queen literally fight the nazis ? 
  is n't this you know , hate speech ? 
  if i was moroccan i would definitely want to get this dude in line to say the least . 
  it was a political rally or some such , dude was shouting `` pro !, 
  the point is why would you even mention this in a pleasant thread like this ? 
  just ca n't go without spitting some racist nonsense , can you ? 
  that was completely uncalled for . 
   when they invaded anatolia , the turks did n't really change the genetic makeup of it , and just changed the language and culture of the area . 
  they 're mostly ethnically identical to greeks ( but do n't tell them that ) . 
  this is indeed true , i investigated my family history and found out that my father 's mother 's family were y\u00f6r\u00fcks from khorasan , they were turkmens who crossed the caspian sea a few centuries ago ( thus mixing with the persians ) and my mother 's father was most likely a tatar or circassian . 
  the rest were natives of anatolia . 
  they had to go a really long way to reach anatolia and unless they brought more central asians , their genetic makeup would inevitably change significantly . 
  most people are still the original population way back from the hittites though . 
  race has literally no standardised definition , feel free to use it for anything . 
  you 've been disagreed with , see you in hell filthy heathen . 
  would 've been just fine as / r/mediterranean but that sub has been taking by a spam bot , oops . 
  it was pretty much all ww1 and gelibolu ( with some tribal migrations and history of anatolia ) in my case . 
  ottomans and everything after the 20s were strangely absent . 
   yeah we already tried that but they were n't grateful for our civilisation so we returned home and made them return to shit . 
  absolutely ridiculous . 
  this is not a video game/a romanticized tale . 
  get your head out of your sweet austrian ass mate . 
  and us :(, 
  keep in mind that this is a politician saying this , not some random citizen . 
  they have a responsibilities and powers . 
   `` when will you journalists realize that it is deeply rooted in the culture of islam to rape and abuse those women who do n't conform with [ its ] teachings . 
  there is a large correlation between rapes in sweden and the number of immigrants from mena countries . '', 
  if this is indeed what he said then it is absolutely unacceptable . 
  the problem is n't that he 's stating facts ( arguable but that 's a thing for another day ) , it 's that he 's intentionally misleading people to further his cause . 
  this is hate speech , not free speech . 
  the intolerant do not deserve tolerance . 
  you do n't like islam ? 
  i do n't either , i think it should be slowly wiped out as with all religions . 
  but most europeans are just doing it wrong . 
  i get you are passionate about the issue , but calm the fuck down and treat others as people , not cattle . 
  he is very thorough . 
  putin is eternal . 
  but - istan means - land ( like ireland/scotland/greenland etc ) in persian :(,
