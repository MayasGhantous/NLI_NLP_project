  you mean hordes ? 
  they are white or christian . 
  it 's just a version of the name different abrahamic religions use for some odd reason . 
  yeah , alexander is the christian name for \u0130skender i think . 
  like abraham/ibrahim , moses/musa , michael/mikhail , david/davud and so on . 
  eh , i just do n't like the real this that attitude . 
  yeah , some people are stupid and we are frustrated , we should still keep it calm as much as we can . 
   real turks lolwut i notice your comments are gradually getting more rude and classless , not cool man . 
  i really do n't , elaborate . 
   same problem there except not really noticable because french people are assholes unless they want your money . 
  oh man , you love your stereotypes do n't you ? 
  yeah , what is white ? 
  caucasian is a term invented by a racist german pseudoscientist and is sadly used by americans . 
   in his earlier racial typology , meiners put forth that caucasians had the `` whitest , most blooming and most delicate skin '' . 
  europeans with darker skin he considered `` dirty whites '' , admixed with mongolian . 
  such views were typical of early scientific attempts at racial classification ,, 
  have you ever traveled in and outside of the country ? 
  i presume you have . 
  alright , you live in a shitty place , that does n't make all turks identical to those who live in that place , you should know that as a good and civilised white person , no ? 
  we get horrible dutch people here too , does n't mean every dutch person is a 24/7 drunkard who vomits in the middle of the street everyday and yells obscenities at 03:00 . 
  but yeah , we really did send our uneducated population there after ww2 . 
  what does white person mean anyway ? 
  i was genuinely asking if you experienced trauma by a turkish person . 
  i 've heard this multiple times even in / r/offmychest titled `` i hate turkish people because my stepdad is turkish and does n't visit me often '' , the replies ? 
  `` oh honey i understand totally normal ! '' . 
  but i digress , this also happens with black people in the us and such , someone gets their relative raped and suffers from some sort of delusion . 
  anything of that sort going on with you ? 
  i 'm trying to be as polite as possible mind you , most people do not tolerate this stuff and it is hate speech and i would like to scalp you in real life . 
  elaborate & # 3232 ; _ & # 3232 ;, 
   yeah , pretty much . 
  i never said europeans were the good guys . 
  but if we were bad we were the best at being bad . 
  alright , why you whining about ottomans treating christians badly then ? 
  remember we did n't discriminate by something unchangeable like nationality until the 19th century which was disastrous for everyone in the region . 
  we discriminated by religion which if people did n't have their pride stuck so far up their ass they would 've simply converted . 
   romans are romanticized because there 's a reason for them to be . 
  a society vastly superior to anyone who lived in their time , a society of harsh justice , discipline and precision . 
  a people who basically shaped the world into what it is today , together with the greeks . 
  that 's ... that 's kinda fascist . 
   ottoman military bands are thought to be the oldest variety of military marching band in the world , dating from the 13th century . 
   11th century book div\u00e2nu l\u00fcgati ` t-t\u00fcrk mentions prototype of mehtaran , turkish military band tradition . 
  bands were formed by soldiers . 
  17th century traveler evliya \u00c7elebi noted that the ottoman empire had 40 guilds of musicians in 1670 's istanbul . 
  ottoman military bands influenced european equivalents -  the europeans and arabs obtained firearms in the 14th century the turks , iranians , and indians all had firearms no later than the 15th century , in each case directly or indirectly from the europeans . 
  -  basically if you 've done anything good for us it 's by screwing us over . 
  like you know you bully a kid at school for being fat and eventually he loses weight . 
  you 're still a douche . 
  and his prosperity helped him go further because he had to deal with the douche . 
  dat victim complex  you mean by torturing and murdering all the romans of the eastern roman empire so they had to flee to italy and inspire the renaissance ? 
  i said indirectly for a reason mate . 
   just no . 
  it was actually europeans who made cannons for you thanks to which you took constantinopole . 
  like how you enslaved natives of americas and black people and had them do your shit for you and fuck the rest of the world gradually ? 
  i do n't even know why i 'm arguing with this guy : i, 
  * only the master race . 
   istanbul was the greek word for `` the city '' which is what the greeks called constantinople . 
  the city in greek is sthn poli which the turks thought was the actual name of the city , fun fact of the day !, 
   true but istanbul was officially the name after the republic because `` they wanted to distance themselves from the ottoman empire '' . 
  konstantiniyye was used before that i reckon . 
  like how alexandria was not changed ( it 's \u0130skenderiye in turkish ) . 
  lol colonialism rome also assimilated and massacred their way into success , but they are ridiculously romanticized ( ha ) so it 's ok . by the way we ( indirectly ) helped kick off the renaissance and the discovery of the new world , modern musical instruments , firearms and such have been introduced to europe with turkish assistance . 
  it 's unhelpful to say `` we 'd have gotten them anyway and skullfucked the rest of the world side ways hehe '' but we really do n't know what turn history would take without us , so shut it . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ % 100 ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ correct ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ know, 
  this is good , we are trying to get rid of the peasant population . 
  we 've been successful so far * rubs hands * . 
  do n't bother with / u/divideetimpera8 , he literally has no idea what he 's talking about . 
  he has a very simplistic view of the world . 
  he said that `` turks have an oriental culture '' then changed it to `` turks have a middle eastern culture '' then said western is just another way to say european . 
  called me a shitty person and a dumbass ( dae appropriate name lelelexdxdxd ??? ), 
  plus he thinks europe is an actual continent . 
  i 'd say we 're neither western nor eastern or whatever , we 've got our own thing going on like most countries , which is why it 's not accurate to say it 's this or that . 
  damn , that is some strong hate . 
  trauma from a turk or something ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ that 's ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ joke . 
  * the gdp though ... *, 
  profiting off delusional people * dude has a media empire along with the countless juicy contracts for his spineless `` friends '' and family and is literally seen as the caliph by some idiots . 
  awesome . 
  i think we need to leave cyprus as soon as possible provided cyprus is not a greek-orthodox state ( i think it should be secular and for all peoples but i think the cypriots ' got this covered ) . 
  these kinds of things will only distance us . 
  although we did need to intervene in the military lunacy & attempted attacks at minorities in the difficult and recent times of the cold war , we did n't know when to stop . 
  we should 've just made sure that everything was fine and dandy and collaborated with the west . 
   ~ ~ human ~ ~ peasant life is cheap in turkey . 
  ha , you impoverished your lands while enriching mine !, 
  so we went from 972 years to 982 , shit . 
  i agree with the first comment , the second one 's a sarcastic/joke . 
  turkish nationals ? 
  you mean turks ? 
  we certainly do feel like we are treated unfairly . 
  you can say `` nah , you are idiots just pay pls '' or you might try to understand why we feel that way . 
  i think the former is what most europeans will consider first . 
  so where does this end ? 
  when will they stop pushing us around ? 
  pay this !, 
  pay reparations that !, 
  oh you even remotely disagree ? 
  fuck right off then !, 
  we are only ordered to pay because we ca n't enforce our interests , most western nations stepped in deeper shit . 
  this is a great way to ruin reunification efforts i 'll give them that . 
  i agree with that but be careful about categorizing things like that . 
  we also have our regions that are reasonable and crazy ( from our point of view of course ) .
