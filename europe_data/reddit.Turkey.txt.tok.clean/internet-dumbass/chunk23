  it 's west/east of ankara instead of north/south . 
  cmon , we should be the last guys to get into the cultural this that bullcrap . 
  it 's on huh ? 
  okay , pew pew . 
  ah , and i thought i was talking to a sane person . 
  come with me , will you ? 
  but seriously , the `` go back to '' line is pretty overused . 
  just tell me to fuck off next time and be direct with it next time ? 
  i am talking against golden dawn and this is what i get , nice one / r/europe . 
  i know i know , i 'm being a dick . 
  i do n't really find your comment realistic but alright , we 'll see how it goes . 
  yup . 
  it 's solely because they hate us . 
  nothing more or less . 
  it 's all about us . 
  classy downvote by the way . 
  you do n't have to look for it , start flailing your arms around and eventually you 'll hit a place that sells kebab . 
  `` almost '', 
  it 's nice and dandy that you think they should be free to do as they like , but they do n't think the same for others . 
  they are a hostile group and they need to go , period . 
  lol, 
  and where do we get our payments for the americans overthrowing our democracy during the cold war and the glossed over genocides to `` promote nation-states '' ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ come ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ at ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ me this is absolutely ridiculous . 
  we should not pay this until we get our own reparations as well which will never happen which is why we should collectively shut up about these . 
  my parents considered moving to cyprus in those times , average wage was about triple what it was here apparently . 
  but they stayed because they did n't want to be too separated from their family in the mainland . 
  i wonder just how much my life would differ if they did decide to go . 
  so yeah , it was voluntary . 
  it would be absolutely hilarious to see our dumbass politicians having any say in eu . 
  if we are to leave we should 've just left fair and square , no need to make our own thing with no blackjack and hookers . 
  tanks that launch joy , yes . 
  why he does , he brings the biggest gift of all , joy . 
  what do you know about kurdish separatism ? 
  plus will you say `` oh well , whatever the cause turks are in '' if we lie/our wrongdoings are ignored to get in ? 
  father putin * . 
  we 've been waiting for half a century now , while human rights and akp are big problems , i think they are not the deciding factor here . 
  greece ( allegedly , not sure ) straight up lied to the eu and is still in , cyprus attacked their own minorities ( whatever your stance on the cyprus issue is , both sides had dirtied their hands there ) and was still in eu . 
  majority of eu populace is also likely against us joining for whatever reason , which further drives the chance down . 
  although i was mostly joking all satire has some element of truth in it . 
  bottom line is , eu wants us to be literally perfect and has way higher expectations of us than christian country . 
  nah , i think it 's closer to the hre . 
  small and relatively big states/countries in a very decentralized government , have to be christian and white to get in and some cooperation between them seems good enough to me as opposed to a huge unified country where every country regardless of background is absorbed and assimilated, 
  `` united states of europe '' ? 
  that 's a really bad name . 
  holy european empire is much better ^ ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ ^ accurate, 
  of course not , everybody got that it was a simple example except you , you are ridiculous . 
   this happens to quite a few historical figures and calling it an `` american stance '' is a little disingenuous . 
  it is polarizing , yes , but still an interesting one to be discussed . 
  since most of us have been hearing `` the bad buys/the good guys '' `` axis of evil '' `` they hate us for our freedoms '' from americans for a time now , i think he associated it with that . 
  berlusconi is a living legend , i count myself lucky that i was alive in the same piece of time as him . 
  i wonder if exiled tatars could somehow be returned to crimea ... 
  plays clips from louis ck , rock bands and jim carry and is an american and calls himself european . 
  `` look at this european who spits on his own people ( to jim carry and louis ck who are neither european nor serious ) '' `` an ever present threat of being labeled a racist , pushed by this fear of persecution ... '' `` negrophilia , from a slave block to a pedestal '' `` your people '' `` my people '' [ and someone else complains about being censored while being a complete loser himself . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7_v0bbokta ) the guy is a nazi sympathizer and is anti-semitic , fuck this guy . 
  what on all nonsense is this guy talking about anyway ? 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzr8hxetln0 this is straight up racism , come on / r/europe . 
  * this might be absurd comedy but poe 's law . 
   even though the left lost the culture war can you elaborate ? 
  fun fact : can bonomo is a turkish-jew , his family was exiled from spain a few centuries ago . 
   i 'm not the one doing it . 
  i did n't say it was right . 
  but that 's the reality of the situation . 
  you can drop the ad hominem . 
  i did n't mean to attack you , it was more of a snarky comment . 
   not that it matters . 
  international law is just a suggestion , it 's got no teeth . 
  of course it has no teeth . 
  usa is the military hyperpower , until we can down it enough to be able to enforce international law they will do as they see fit . 
  ultimately my point is usa definitely is not better than russia/china when it comes to foreign policy . 
  to be fair , israel was literally created to be a safe haven for jews . 
   gitmo is open because it 's impossible to close . 
  not true , you know damn well it can be closed within days . 
   there 's been a huge mess trying to find places to house the inmates ; places secure enough to keep the prisoners do n't want them , and places that want them might not actually keep them . 
  oh that 's so nice of you < 3 , better torture them to death while they are your guests !, 
   they 're prisoners of war , not civilian prisoners , so can they even be kept in regular prisons ? 
  if they were pows would n't it make it illegal to torture them ? 
  those personal attacks ... you have n't refuted anything he said there , you just attacked him and humiliated him . 
  blaming bush or any president is meaningless , they have more of a ceremonial role . 
  us has caused enough suffering in this world already . 
  your little chess game with the soviets have ruined so many people . 
  but let 's forget that and call america better than others . 
  do you still think that people are saying [ you are lynching negroes ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/and_you_are_lynching_negroes ) what has the usa done to me ? 
  they organized coups all over the world including mine ( and millions of people were tortured like my uncle ) and ruined so many good people just to get at the soviets . 
  what has russia/china do to us ? 
  nothing . 
  absolutely god damn fucking nothing . 
  not to mention americans keep torturing pows and have resulted in hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths . 
  just be intellectually honest at least , do n't claim to be more moral than anyone else , admit the us is a scumbag too . 
  i wonder what americans will do in a conflict again if such an event occurs ? 
  i shudder to think how many people will die . 
  what do the jews have to do with it this time & # 3232 ; _ & # 3232 ;, 
  actually , this is closer to my plan : * change it to constantinople * change it back to something better * leave eu because everybody bitched about it * end of vicious and cunning plan net profit : nothing because i was merely stating that we could do something if we did n't like the name . 
  total costs : loss of ability to be sarcastic . 
  we would n't notice because we already have that , we just do n't blame it on roma people . 
  except for you know , getting out of it . 
  sure , we 'll make it constantinople then change it to something better after we get in ... 
  i think what he 's saying is that crimea is merely occupied by russia , not annexed . 
  they might physically control the place but legally they are occupiers until crimea is internationally recognized as russian territory . 
  no need to use force people , just let us in to your cool club .
