  ^ ^ ^ also ^ ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ ^ istanbul ^ ^ ^ now , ^ ^ ^ although ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ do ^ ^ ^ want ^ ^ ^ an ^ ^ ^ actual ^ ^ ^ name ^ ^ ^ instead ^ ^ ^ of ^ ^ ^ something ^ ^ ^ close ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ `` the ^ ^ ^ city '' ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ greek . 
  ^ ^ ^ like ^ ^ ^ uluubat . 
  oh sure , we are-a both `` shit people and dumbasses '' are n't we ? 
  i 'll be keeping on being oriental , take care western & euro guy . 
  man , you really are stretching those definitions . 
  what , i never said i am , i really do n't care . 
  my family passed the caspian sea then helped penetrate anatolia with the seljuk turks , i really have no relation to europe , the only time i 've ever been to europe is the euro side of istanbul . 
  * however i will-a call myself european when it 's convenient . 
  *  western is just a different way of saying european . 
   like turkey is middle eastern culture and then japan and china are oriental there are just so many things wrong with this that i laugh so that i wo n't get sad at this level of ignorance , you really did n't think it through , did ya ? 
   as for being white , `` being white '' is a very very thin arguable line that is not worth the time to be taken into account . 
  i was only % 50 sarcastic . 
   like turkey is middle eastern culture and then japan and china are oriental lol, 
   i am especially proud of our air-force for being able to compete and excel at us/israel joint-combat exercises which usually happen 3-4 times a year . 
  erm , i 'm not saying it is n't a geographical place just like siberia or maghreb or what have you , but it should not be it 's own continent and i will stand by that statement . 
   turkey looses it 's last case of being european because then all that defines europe is culture loses anyways , how does one be culturally european ? 
  be white and christian ? 
  i think it 's more of a fluid thing . 
   also , americans tend to get downvoted here , sadly . 
  most `` non-europeans '' tend to get downvoted except for the very rare chinese/japanese guy . 
   americans , canadians and aussies are european because of their european culture . 
  i think what you mean here is `` western '' . 
  i mean aside from europe being a made up continent , [ you might notice the lack of europe here . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/winkel_triple_projection_sw.jpg ) i do n't know how you got that i 'm implying they should be ignored either . 
  any topic that can be even remotely tied to europe can be posted here , no ? 
  i 've seen people who say `` we 're europeans here ... '' to turks and cheer on americans when they clearly state they are not european . 
  `` i 'm not european and this happened in seattle but ... '' you go american guy !, 
  let 's ignore americans , canadians and aussies then . 
  turkey is in nato so we 'd most likely come over too . 
  also flair up . 
  yeah , i kind of felt weird when there were no takbirs after an explosion . 
  dear leader laughs at this . 
  but would n't he be american the - alright , i 'll take it . 
  because we live in a caricature of a world , the sooner we grasp this the better we can understand ridiculous things like this . 
  i think you meant `` japan ** ese ** - american '' there in your flair . 
  that accent though . 
  `` thank god we 're louisiana '', 
  ~ i 'm a beautiful strong erdo\u011fan who do n't need no democracy . ~ `` democracy is a train we ride to get to our destination , then we get off . '', 
  we must absorb you . 
  adding to this , it was also fueled by ( pseudo ) scientific racism . 
  well , my country is slightly in europe ( a made up continent ) and religion bothers me here . 
  it has been growing since akp took power and it 's showing no signs of backing down . 
  i do n't think islam is a threat , i just think people are throwing their worthless lives away to a faith . 
  we could 've used our resources much more efficiently but we are shitting out mosques all day . 
  we were optimistic that we would one day be fully secular and even join eu in the next millenium . 
  slight majority of our population are literally being bribed with rice , coal and furniture to vote for this wannabe sultan masquerading as a politician . 
  you could 've traveled the world !, 
  you could 've learned so many amazing things but you are sticking a kuran up your ass and chanting !, 
  * yep , we are secure in our sexuality . 
  thanks for your service i did what i had to do to defend myself i would suck off all of the founding fathers inner city culture is a problem europeans are racist and arrogant why did your country take the name of a bird ? 
  is canada in europe ? 
  this gradually became more ridiculous but you get the idea, 
  i 'm glad we do n't have ( or had , globalization sadly ) this kind of thing here ( people are much more used to drinking rak\u0131 with magnificent food at home with friends and family than getting shit faced in public ) . 
  & # 3232 ; _ & # 3232 ; that image brought back memories of drunk brits vomiting on the street . 
  man , how i would love to see your face as you get whipped by a japanese guy to work harder and if your lazy ass did n't gather enough rubber your worthless limbs being cut off under 50c heat with only your ( soiled ) underwear on in front of your toddler who will starve to death without you . 
  what 's that ? 
  you 're a freed honest working man ? 
  too bad the rest of the world literally sees you as no more than a chimp . 
  nah , i would n't , that 's obviously very fucked up , you see . 
  that 's what it should be , nothing . 
  i 'm glad to see nationalities are eroding . 
  * you might try to delay the inevitable , we 'll hump you , eventually . 
  we do n't respond to criticism by calling racism , we just get angrier than the other side . 
  guys , do n't pull the location card because cyprus . 
  however i am glad that europeans are acknowledging their traditions are still deeply christian . 
  if you are arguing that turkey is `` not european '' culturally or our population and what have you , then you have a point . 
  we do n't think we 'll ever get into the eu before the heat death of the universe . 
  that will happen as soon as we enter the eu . 
  the natives were put in boarding schools and `` beaten the native out of them '' . 
  indeed not a nice way to go about things . 
  those are european values ? 
  * no , there is no discrimination whatsoever . 
  it 's all their fault and we are completely innocent . 
  they should 've never left the shithole that is india in the first place . 
  * how about we just gas them ? 
  * seriously , the fuck are you even talking about ? 
   question is , how are those hierarchies formed . 
  at the most basic and primitive level , the strongest/smartest gets to the top through brute force/trickery . 
  indeed , why ? 
  these are people lucky enough to grow old . 
  * or like inbred racists and white people ? 
  thanks anyways but what i want to ask is so what ? 
  they are not harming you . 
  sure i understand you if you want them to speak english but so what if they are non ethnic british and not integrated as long as they do n't cause any issues ? 
  and i would 've still wrote in `` clear text '' that cyprus was accepted because of it 's ethnic and religious background , not the location . 
  i hear you , and yes i do get disproportionally downvoted even though i try to contribute to the discussion . 
  not just greeks , non-muslims . 
  we gave you everything !, 
  a scholarship from the best the empire could offer , a roof over your head and fed you and what do we get ? 
  yeah , just imagine how powerful we could 've been if you just accepted us and converted !, 
  all you had to do was speak turkish and convert !, 
  you mean like how greek nationalists artificially greek-ified themselves after their independence ? 
  you were just another colony for us mate . 
  of course it is n't , cyprus would n't be accepted if it all depended on location . 
  not that i 'm doubting you but can we get a few native londoners to confirm this ? 
  unless they were hostile to us i do n't think we would object . 
  my point being that i personally would not mind anyone coming here as long as my way of life remained unchanged , which it will with a competent government . 
  no , a quarter of our population is kurdish . 
  although the pkk resulted in 40,000 ( that 's more or less because of our own oppressive policies against them which i 'm ashamed of ) deaths , we 're getting better also i 'm not objecting to him saying british people are becoming a minority , even though i disagree with it i can sort of understand it . 
  but he added white in there , why ?
