  i do n't have to apologize for anything ? 
  well that 's fucking great since these guys are painting us as the fucking boogeyman . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ am ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ swearing ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ right just like how armenians feel wronged , we also feel wronged . 
  nobody even thinks these killings were genocide or [ anything of importance really . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/persecution_of_ottoman_muslims#total_casualties ) also i see i 've posted that a lot but it 's such a good article ( i hope it does n't get vandalized or what have you ) . 
  i am quite literally getting booed out for pointing it out , sad reality is n't it ? 
  treaty of sevres was a massive fuck up and great powers did not want to pursue it further . 
  just admit it ( ha ) , both sides were scumbags to each other . 
  regardless , should austrians , russians and balkan-ers be forced to apologize and pay reparations to us because they ( formally ) killed some of us ? 
  no , that is unless literally every nation corrects their own wrongdoings , which will never happen realistically . 
  and what about the local greeks and armenians insurgents ? 
  well , ssshhh . 
  [ total casualties . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/persecution_of_ottoman_muslims#total_casualties ), 
  apparently it 's because we have to formally apologize and pay , despite the current republic fighting against the ottomans . 
  my own turk great-great-grandfather adopted a little armenian girl when they were on their way to syria ( i assume ) , she was wonderful . 
  years later her mother came and demanded her from us , she did n't want to go to america with her ( guess her mom experienced the american dream ) and her mother said `` come on , do n't live with these people ! '' . 
  we do n't care one way or another . 
  nobody hears our case because armenians are way more outspoken about this issue . 
  also several million ottoman turks & muslims died too !, 
  do n't forget those guys !, 
  please remember that genocide as well . 
  also throw in some reparations if you 'd like . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/persecution_of_ottoman_muslims `` total muslim deaths and refugees during these centuries are estimated to be several millions . 
  [ 50 ] it is estimated that during the last decade of the ottoman empire ( 1912-1922 ) when the balkan wars , wwi and war of independence took place , close to 2 million muslims , civilian and military , died in the area of modern turkey . '', 
  yup , that 's what i was trying to say . 
  again all of my statements are probable or just likely . 
  they probably are not told to shoot on sight , we 'd have a shit storm over it .

  why this is n't classified as a genocide by westerners is beyond me . 
  yup , that is indeed correct sadly . 
  please explain why you are downvoting me so i can change my mind , you 're not going to get that stuff recognized without convincing people like me . 
  eh , i am ignoring it . 
  i just made one cheesy comment somewhere else in here . 
  it 's just that these do n't seem genuine to us , you know ? 
  `` please do the right thing please do the right thing please please please '' we see these over and over again . 
  i 've went through some of these guy 's post histories and they are saying `` it 's the moral thing , please ! '', 
  and then somewhere else he 's saying `` the turks will pay , do n't worry . 
  '' ( this has happened multiple times ) . 
  we do the same thing , maybe some of us turks are projecting but this seems like a thinly veiled political tool to us . 
  i 'm not saying op is like that at all ( i 'm sure he 's a wonderful person ) but we are skeptical to say the least . 
  it 's just that it seems like he 's milking it . 
  want me to make a thread about the unrecognized genocides of ottoman turks over and over again ? 
  enough ? 
  pack up and go home everyone . 
  it probably is very easy to get in or out , turkish army is mostly conscripts and getting sent to that region is considered a death sentence here . 
  maybe they fled or something ? 
  why should the current republic pay any reparations at all when most colonial powers have not done much for their rape of africa ? 
  wut , that 's just some magnificent men having a walk . 
  we could 've taken vienna dod gammit !, 
  hope they get to the `` matamoros '' names soon . 
  are you really a european if you are australian ? 
  yeah , no . 
  nationalism is evil and should be erased . 
  but why ? 
  why would you feel a bond with your country ? 
  it makes no sense !, 
  i 'd understand if you said ideology or some such , since you believe in the same things . 
  but your countrymen ? 
  do you know how many people are duped by this way of thinking ? 
  just how much damage it has done to our world ? 
  ha , you think your nation is your family ? 
  sure but why do you draw the line there ? 
  why not your physical properties/language/geographical location/ideologies ? 
  why do you feel a bond with people who share the same fenced off area with you ? 
  classy downvotes by the way . 
  yup , i was honestly scared by that . 
  i said `` guys , let 's pull ourselves back for a minute and slow down for a bit ! '', 
  but nope , people were extremely hostile to pro-russia opinions and i 'm the last guy to be with russia in this one . 
  how is it your home ? 
  i would n't say it attracts a hive mind , it 's more of a hot topic that people feel very ( maybe too ) strongly about . 
  i 'd also say this subreddit has less of this hive mind than others , it 's usually 2 sides insulting each other non stop or being passive aggressive . 
  but yes , most of the time one side is slightly more numerous . 
  no they are neither there to help your economy nor help you in any way . 
  they are there to make a better life for themselves and their family . 
  no one cares you were inconvenienced by some poor people coming from horrible places . 
  sure , they integrated just because of that and nothing else . 
  that has-a multiple meanings , si . 
  i feel out of place ... 
  i heard he just killed late ones and in turn this led to the personnel stopping the train in a remote area and fleeing if they knew they were going to be late . 
  damn , that dude ai n't right . 
  why the hell do these guys have problems with jews ? 
  i do n't think jews have done anything soo baaad that they get shit like this . 
  most muslims do n't see physical property differences the same way westerners do . 
  westerners put way too much emphasis on looks . 
  muslims are much more about ideology or really just what you think . 
  they 've actually got a theocratic government , they know it 's all bullshit by now . 
  no , stop spreading misinformation . 
  literally nobody uses `` rumelia '' . 
  actually , we get registered as a muslim on birth by default and nearly no one bothers to change it . 
  i 'd say it 's closer to % 90 - % 80 . 
  nah mate , there 's no `` backwards asian '' or somesuch here , and we only call greeks `` rums '' . 
  it 's mostly just secular vs muslim , nothing more or less . 
  yeah , do n't you know ? 
  if your government does something terrible they are excused after a generation , all of us here would know . 
  the general support from the west , who exactly arseniy yatsenyuk is and militant ukrainians . 
  i have little knowledge of this event . 
  how is it pathetic and how is it backed up by russia ? 
  this guy does tend to be a contrarian but i think some of those points are valid , i do n't know if this is a running joke but anything even remotely critical of the situation there seems to get extremely negative posts and accusations of being shills .
