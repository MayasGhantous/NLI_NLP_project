  i dunno , ask me about the armenian genocide or something , that would annoy a turk more than the name , though i doubt you know about it . 
  without getting into oppression olympics i 'll say that armenia was the aggressor in this war and twice as many azeris were displaced . 
  so maybe azerbaijan is the one who needs protection here . 
  xaxa , was one big city until filthy westerners divided and conquered !, 
  except i 'm an atheist and trying to get away from those muslims you hate so much . 
  ~ ~ jesus ~ ~ i mean mohammad you are stupid !, 
  still attacking my country and not me , going for a low blow that failed to hit i see . 
  `` the only turkey ah know iz the one ah eat on thanksgivin ' i ai n't knowin no other turkey !, 
  fun fact : that bird was imported from ( to central europe ) turkey/turcia/t \u00fcrkiye / land of turks so the name stuck with brits . 
  most languages have other names for the bird , pretty funny ones too i might add . 
  this escalated rather quickly ... yeah , our military dick is n't as big as yours we ca n't kill more people than you what do we do ? 
  oh confused racist gun nut , i knew you had a power problem the moment i saw you trying to keep your weapons while trying to get away from those filthy coloureds as far as possible . 
  i 'd talk shit about good ol' murrica back , but i do n't want to get on a list y' know . 
  you know your toxic and painfully ironic opinions were shown to be absolutely wrong and utterly embarrassing and now you 'll attack me personally or my country , because you lack the knowledge to argue . 
  which i do n't give a shit either way because i think this country * went downhill * anyway . 
  ( but seriously , i 'm considering moving out like you but my reasons actually make sense so have at you ! ), 
  you went full / r/murica , or rather the people they are parodying . 
  just leave before you embarrass yourself even more . 
  and to top it off you are monolingual because you 'd never learn the filthy language that is spanish , or any other language because the only language ah need is american !, 
  i get what you are saying , but do you * really * think the us government could n't pay literally everyone in usa a livable wage ? 
  come on gun nut , inflate your country 's ability 's * now * !, 
  well good thing you do n't have to because the us is the wealthiest nation on the god damn planet . 
  seriously , when the us really wants to do something they do it . 
  you 're telling me your problems are caused by the shoeless poor fuck that manages to try to make a better life for himself/herself by risking her life ? 
  get a fuckin grip will you ( \u256f \u00b0 \u25a1 \u00b0 \uff09 \u256f \u253b \u2501 \u253b nah that was way over the top dramatization , but you get the idea . 
  god bless america . 
   we have a huge welfare state  ** we have a huge welfare state ** hahahahahahahahha welfare state said the american !, 
  welfare state too huge said the american !, 
  here 's a ridiculous proposition : stop spending so much in your military . 
  you are aware that you are in / r/europe and even underdeveloped countries laugh at the us for the lack of exactly this ? 
   your statements reek of ignorant stereotypes i commonly see from europeans that know little about certain regions here . 
  sure , you bear no ignorant stereotypes and you are the source of common sense , common sense flings out of you as if you are a common sense fountain . 
  also calling a turk a european might rustle some jimmies around here , careful . 
  i see americans still have a long way of solving race issues ... you really think immigrants are the problem and not horribly inefficient management and corruption ? 
  you sound like the guy who tried to create his own all white town and defend it with guns . 
  & # 3232 ; _ & # 3232 ; well um , you should immediately go to russia then , you 'd fit right in . 
  guns ( or really any weapon ) , xenophobia , nationalism , racism , what 's not to like ? 
  trying hardest at what ? 
  going downhill ? 
  nah , chill and eat some burgers you 're all going to be just fine . 
  mate , you have n't seen `` going downhill '' have you ? 
  ah well , keeping your standards high in these kind of things is good . 
  i think russia/albania/serbia etc might be excellent countries for gun lovers but they are probably worse than the us in everything else . 
  but really , us is fine . 
  you have some stupid politicians but those guys are pretty harmless weasels . 
  it already is . 
  oops , i should have added `` in times of war '' * so yes , if there 's mass hysteria or any kind of military related job something close to that is going to happen . 
  although it can be argued this is the case regardless with drafts . 
  guys , it 's both . 
  what 's the difference ? 
  you assume that you will not force your beliefs on other people , but patriotism requires you to submit your body and your mind to the ruling authority , what you think of `` my country '' is definitely different than what i think which is probably why we ca n't agree on loving this piece of fenced off land . 
  why do you fixate on your country ? 
  why not your religion/ideology/race ; _ ; / location/class/etc etc. . . 
  i 'm genuinely asking why you like to hang on your national identity instead of anything else . 
  what is it about countries that makes you want to quite literally give yourself to the ruling authority ? 
  if you are already going to criticize your country ( which i do n't buy , patriotism by definition means you have a bias towards your own country ) then what use is it ? 
   if it did , it would almost certainly be to stop the spread of boko haram , rather than to go to war with the government this straight up does n't make sense . 
  that does n't threaten the canadian mainland and if you are thinking about an american style post 9/11 hysteria , that 's so improbable it 's best to ignore it . 
  you might say `` but you actually think canada would declare war on nigeria ? '', 
  i gave that as an example , think of the us or russia if you will . 
  by the way if you did n't know , when you are in the military no one gives a shit what you think , you are a literal tool for the high ups to use . 
  so your `` stop x i disagree with !, 
  thing is a myth . 
  simply put , dangerous and simplistic way of thinking . 
  is joke comrade , and it 's `` ruble '' . 
  thing is , it 's very hard to draw the line at where nationalism/patriotism stops ( the same damn thing ) . 
  let 's say if canada declared war on nigeria would you join the war and go to that country ? 
  ( usa vs afghanistan/iraq/vietnam is a nice example ) and if yes for what reason ? 
  to spread how nicer your country is ? 
  probably not . 
  but most people seem to support western countries unconditionally and that 's dangerous . 
  i 've seen comments like `` ah well , war is hell . 
  hope we can rehabilitate these guys ! '', 
  on abu ghraib photos while if that were to be reversed ( hell , i 've seen people calling for the death of iraqis who lynched a blackwater mercenary after they opened fire on civilians and left or some such ) it would have been let 's get those towelheads !, 
   not much of what you have says make any sense wat, 
  the reason for those coups were proxy wars between the us and the soviets , the secular thing is a mask for that . 
  oh i know akp will , there are local elections though & # 3232 ; _ & # 3232 ;, 
  uniting muslims kind of sounds like a pretty religious government to me mate , make up your mind . 
   yeah , i know erdogan has $ 1 billion of stolen cash in his house , but i do n't give a fuck . 
  there are no good alternatives to the akp . 
  you are a part of the problem ... 
  i disagree with this , i am an atheist and your thinking that `` turkey is a success '' is the result of an engineered middle class . 
  you might say `` but it was worse !, 
  '' , people are taking insane debts to buy what they want and that might crumble and we 'll be worse than greece . 
  [ source , there are much more if you want to research . 
  ] ( http://www.albawaba.com/business/erdogan-turkey-economy-564476 ) erdo\u011fan is very corrupt and if you still support him i do n't know what to say . 
  besides , i 'm probably taking the bait here but you say you are secular yet talk about uniting muslims ?? 
  i do n't care what you say , you just make yourself look like an idiot . 
  your attitude is the problem , not your opinion . 
  this comment seems familiar ... 
  well , he did get out of a very bloody war that ended a literally 600 years old world empire , saw his friends and people die , all the while getting tag teamed by great powers . 
  he kind of had to get things in line . 
  erdo\u011fan is basically `` oops how do i close thing '', 
  seems like a troll . 
  i get what you mean and here 's the thing ; ** it does n't matter . 
  ** but it seems to matter to a lot of people , which is n't nice . 
   ethnicity is a social construct , not a concrete biological reality . 
  i agree with this but many people do n't and that 's sad . 
  however , `` biological realities '' do n't make any kind of classification ok which was what i was talking about earlier . 
   edit : also `` thank you for your service '' is a wonderful thing to say to civil servants/military professionals .
