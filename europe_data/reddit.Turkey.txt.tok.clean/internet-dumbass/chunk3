  you think america would help some mexican group if they came and said `` if us does n't protect mexicans against cartels we will be killing american citizens and bombing american cities '' nope , they 'd be flattened in a second and that 's what we should be doing . 
  selahattin demirta\u015f says we are n't letting them cross to ayn al-arab so that 's why they ca n't win against is . 
  yeah , it 's not like they were going back and forth between syria and iraq for decades and maybe just now got their ass kicked in by is . 
  and yes , they have no right to self determination or independence . 
  nationalism is dumb and dangerous . 
  was joke, 
  yeah , they should only blow up the natives . 
  you know so little yet have so much confidence in the bullshit you 're spewing . 
   the difference is that one group is fighting for national liberation and self-determination and the other one is fighting for oppression and land . 
  oh , and it happens to be in nato . 
  though its commitment to the alliance is obviously a load of horseshit oh yeah ? 
  is that why we went to korea ? 
  host nato bases and nukes and helped protect the west against the soviets ? 
   but their designation as a terror organization is a joke when they are a popularly supported group with very specific political aims , in which they would stop fighting when their aims are met . 
  this has nothing to do with them being terrorists . 
  i told you that you never talked about their means but only about their goals and you still do n't . 
  what are their aims by the way ? 
  last time you could n't argue with me you said `` i had a big empire mentality '' and that i was `` butthurt like the serbs '' . 
  pathetic , god damn pathetic . 
  i hope your `` immigrants '' radicalize and take your head clean off . 
  i 'd love to watch jihadi john have his way with you . 
  edit : i apparently deleted the previous one while adding this , kill yourself or better yet come to syria/iraq and let us see your bloating corpse on youtube . 
  i 'd be delighted . 
  that is indeed correct but the point stands , there are 8 times as many east slavs than finno-ugric peoples so it defaults to the east slavs . 
  so let me get this straight , you 're saying that finns and russians are genetically similar but that means the russians are finns and not the other way around . 
  yes ? 
  unfortunately there are about 25 times more russians so it defaults to finns being finnish speaking russians . 
  they were part of russia so they were dragged into those wars . 
  it 's really not something to be glorified . 
  there 's the suez canal . 
  i would n't give a shit if someone mistook you for being turkish either ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ) that uncapitalized * turkish * , seems like you need to move beyond your tribalism bro, 
   fins are not really european , but mongol from central asia http://i.imgur.com/6cwz4ll.gif, 
  putin 's one seems to work better . 
  tayyip straight up bribes people with , i kid you not , pasta coal furniture etc. 
  you forgot ccc yozgat ccc, 
  they felt the need to out-faith them ? 
  this seems similar to our own guy tayyip except this one works . 
  what 's up with that flag tho & # 3232 ; _ & # 3232 ;, 
  a `` reasoned opinion '' is of course what you agree with . 
  i did n't say anything about you . 
  that 's just what * some certain * people tend to say . 
   for what it is worth : i always downvote what i do n't like . 
  `` do n't downvote because you disagree '' . 
  pathetic . 
  do n't create the illusion that there are n't any disproportionately racist comments and suggestions . 
  i bet they are n't even nordic . 
  it is here . 
  our only instance of fgm comes from the kurdish regions . 
  you should remember , kurds are no monolith . 
  white guy shoots up school = mental illness !, 
  non-white guy does the same = these people are a problem !, 
  if they are white , they must be reasoned with , if they are brown eh just deport em who cares, 
  it 's the same here but some ultrareligious still get an imam or something after the formalities are done . 
   there 's a big difference between kicking out hordes of unwanted invaders who are destroying your country http://i.imgur.com/wdenzs7.gif, 
  would you say a solution is needed ? 
  that 's an easy one for us , atat\u00fcrk . 
  that 's because you had a different life . 
  the west can either potentially spend billions/trillions on a state with hostile neighbors on all sides ( including a nato ally ) with further complications for not much benefit or they can support their existing allies . 
  i doubt the powers that be want the former . 
  if you 've got nothing to argue just insult people . 
  i thought it was because of my herr erdo\u011fan propaganda ? 
  ever heard of `` the peace process '' that seems to be breaking down these days ? 
  some of them want , nay , demand us to help them defeat is and some of them think our presence in syrian/iraqi kurdistan to be occupation , we just ca n't win . 
  right , if you think a terrorist group can just be good for a few years and have everyone be nice and dandy to them you 're simply too idealistic . 
  now they are starting to riot and attack us again . 
  i was for \u00d6calan 's execution when he was captured and i 'm for his execution now . 
  i am against both their goal and their means to reach them . 
  occupied state , yeah right . 
  we 've held that territory for literally a millenium with no problems . 
   pkk 's activities within turkey in the past few years can not be described as that of a terror organization with almost every single operation carried out by the pkk being against military or government targets . 
  of course operations are against military targets . 
  extortions , abductions , bombings , suicide bombings and intimidations are not `` operations '' . 
  if they fight , they 'll be fought against . 
  seems simple enough . 
  what i 'm saying is you are talking about their goals and not about what they do to reach those goals . 
  you probably think pkk is designated as a terrorist group because turkey told the rest of the world to do so and not because they actually do what i just listed , did n't even answer that . 
  you 're going off about propaganda or whatever already . 
  wake up sheeple . 
  look , comparing these guys with the irish struggle just wo n't do this time . 
  pretty low for you to go full godwin 's law and conspiratard also . 
  yeah , they oppose political establishment so much they kidnap and kill doctors and teachers , burn schools , extort and intimidate kurds who do not agree with them etc. 
  you 're a greentext using westerner , do n't kid yourself into thinking you have any clue what 's going on here mate . 
   would n't attacking turkey be really really stupid of them ? 
  it would but they seem to be going for it . 
  you ca n't even spell yazidi and you respect terrorists . 
  you have no idea what you 're talking about . 
  \\ #khmerrouge i think he 's correct on most things but has a tendency to repeat himself a little bit too much at times . 
  also damn this thread became a downvote shitfest . 
   i ca n't grow a beard you shame your famiry, 
  well it does n't specify which god . 
  tell me about it . 
  those guys are tea noobs . 
  naw , it 's not racist because they say `` it 's the culture '' or `` they are raised that way '' . 
  it 's more complex than that as always , #ffd 7f0 people being racist against # 996600 . 
  but seriously , there are more socially constructed bullshit identities than that . 
  that 's a very uh , anglo way to think . 
  \\ #just 19thcenturythings, 
   got drunk on bulgarian ~ ~ brandy rakia ~ ~ ** rak\u0131 ** know your drinks . 
  yeah i find the fastest way to deal with racism is to confront it right on , jump een it . 
  got ta fight the good fight \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af also i 've never heard of the russians are niggers bit but i do hear `` russians are cyka blyat and their government is stuck in soviet times '' .
