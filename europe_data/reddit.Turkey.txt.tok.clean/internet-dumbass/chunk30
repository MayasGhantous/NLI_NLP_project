  we need to go all louis xvi on these guys . 
  and the government was n't out to get only them . 
  it was a brutal time period and literally hundred thousands of dissenters were indiscriminately tortured or killed . 
  pkk does n't really have the moral high ground because they kind of imply the government specially went for kurds , they went for fucking everyone !, 
  kenan evren himself said `` we hanged righties , we hanged lefties , we tried to be equal . '', 
  add the fact that the government was shitting it 's pants over kurds seceding you get that . 
  although some americans might accuse me of `` anti murrican circlejerk ??? 
  `` ing , [ the us dirtied their hands on this . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980_turkish_coup_d%27%c3%a9tat#american_involvement ), 
  thing is when i talk about pkk people automatically assume i 'm a nationalist who 's trying to make the government look better . 
  do n't get me wrong , i can understand why the kurds would want to rebel , but killing extorting and terrorizing civilians is not doing a rebellion right . 
  but i can also understand the militarization of the place ** after ** pkk , it 's seen as a death sentence if you are sent to that region as a conscript , they regularly ambushed and bombed civilian and military vehicles etc , nobody knew what was going on . 
  i think you can see how they made things worse with their rebellion . 
  i still do n't trust most people who support kurdistan because most have ties to pkk , but that 's an another thing . 
  really , did no one know pkk caused the deaths of more than 40,000 people and the displacement of 3,000,000 ? 
  they even tortured and killed the kurds they claimed to protect and run drug trades to this day . 
  now that they 've turned to diplomacy they 've seen way more progress for their cause and that 's how it should be . 
  indeed , i think the current and the previous governments have been afraid that if that region ever grows economically they 'd want to secede because they 'd be more important ( the gov. 
  would rather forget about them , they have enough problems already ) and most importantly able to enforce their interests . 
  is that second n actually pronounced ? 
  dubrovnik had the right idea . 
   people 's democratic republic of :, 
  actually , yes . 
  if they still vote for him after all these events i 'd say they are objectively stupid/greedy . 
  lolwut ... thought you were sane for a minute . 
  turks were just more efficient mate , all sides had either hate in their hearts or wanted to wipe out the other . 
  ... and also ignoring greek massacres against turks and them scorched earth ` ing west anatolia . 
  you know , i was talking about all that sterilization/racial jingomingo that the swedes got into . 
  but of course at it 's core it 's just us shitting on each other 's k/d ratio . 
  i do n't get it ... 
  like latvia , no potato in \u00c9ire . 
  much troubles :(, 
  do n't take the bait , it 's well known that this armenian ~ ~ genocide ~ ~ shamalamadingdong is the godwin 's law for turks . 
  * that 's what i wanted to hear . 
  * i did n't know just how many countries liked our shitty shows , but eh guess we 'll take it . 
  you do n't have the merriest opinions either . 
  it 's deleted , i am slightly less skeptical but i still do n't know what exactly he said and how you interpret it . 
  i would n't know either , i 'm just a turk whose family came here during a war a millennium ago . 
  nah , they need danes man . 
  tall . 
  blonde . 
  blue eyed . 
  ^ ^ white . 
  [ they do .

  how are the sami doing ? 
  really , put some thought into this , people . 
  with our powers combined we can do anything . 
  the ottoman union ^ ^ tm, 
  guys , think of the serene and calm times of the ottoman balkans , we can make it happen . 
  think about it . 
  just saying man , when you say `` let me clear this up , turks have a zerg mentality , they are eastern barbarians . '', 
  then relentlessly call me all kinds of stupid names ( you fucking thisthat etc. 
  he actually said this to me but his comment was deleted either by him or because i reported it ) , your credibility and sanity comes to question . 
   serbians are my orthodox brothers and i will support them no matter what , good or bad so i am biased . 
  that 's a scary statement right there . 
  welp , nothing happened after all . 
  i know i know , i was being sarcastic . 
  nah man , every jew needs to be in israel for this one awesome thing to happen . 
  damn , you got pretty defensive here my man . 
  i 'd have just called this a ` shop and went on my way . 
  also he posted it then deleted his account , pathetic . 
  yeah , they are not * all gone * !, 
  just % 90 of them died !, 
  * that 's nothing !, 
  those are some pretty heavy accusations man , either get some hard evidence or quiet up . 
  even though there are tons of genocide jokes by serbs who genuinely believe in nationalistic horsecrap and wrap it up as a joke ( they are pretty much only known for remove kebab and srebrenica ) , i kind of feel bad for these guys ; _ ;, 
  i hear you , but most sane people do n't care enough to go through someone 's entire post history . 
  i am , i have n't got the best memory around but i 'm sure i posted on some bizarre subreddits , i kinda like privacy . 
  yeah , that is one scary bot , i kind of want to spam shock subreddits to distort it now . 
  no compensation there however you look at it mate , ol' barack is the president of the most powerful country twice . 
  and ( steretypes ho ) i 'm pretty he 's got a gargantuan cock and he 's 185cm .

  she 's totally into you mate , you 're one exotic guy i guarantee it . 
  except an actual modern military would carpet bomb everywhere and eat hicks with ar-15s for breakfast . 
  xaxa , gun grab you comrade . 
  just interrupting you two confirming each other , if you think europe is falling you 've never lived in a place that is actually collapsing , what you believe is fear mongering at best . 
  islamist and muslim are n't the same thing by the way , know the thing you are hating . 
  you know how we see some americans satirize the `` more state rights !, 
  less fornrs !, 
  yeah ! '', 
  folk ? 
  that kind of sounds exactly like this . 
   admitting that there are problems with the euro and with muslims that implies they think there 's a problem in the first place and see the `` issue '' the same as you but try to hide it for some reason . 
  ( though for islamists i agree , religion has to stay put ) you want a debate , you get a debate . 
  nice mustache & fez there greece :3 ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ fezzes ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ are ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ cool, 
  most of us forgot you guys were even there . 
  you are a nato member , chill . 
  i do n't get it , elaborate ? 
  the pseudoscience is strong with this one . 
  that was a joke by the way ... 
  `` are ukrainians stealing your job ? '', 
  round two huh ? 
  sure let me get my nukes . 
  that is one of the shittiest ways to do that . 
  so balkan countries uhhh ... wan na be annexed ?
