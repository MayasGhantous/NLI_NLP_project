  nobody is really pro g\u00fclen except the people in his cult which i doubt would publicly reveal themselves on reddit unless they are promoting it . 
  a relative of mine worked as one a year ago and she saw it happen ( not going to say which province i 'm in , sorry ) . 
  some major turkish news channels also reported some of it a few years ago but i ca n't recall the exact time . 
  also , they let the syrian refugees ( and expats ) vote because they know they are ultra religious and since they are the government that `` rescued '' them . 
  most houses and apartments have been found to be shown 4 times the residents ( and of course those extra residents voted for akp ) . 
  they even showed poultry as voters ! ^ ^ ^ heuhue ^ ^ ^ dae ^ ^ ^ turkey ? 
  do n't think i can show you cold hard evidence but feel free to search , it exists out there . 
  not saying they can never win the elections without vote rigging but something 's fucky . 
  well , the power mysteriously going out and the voting box thingies taken to a `` safer place '' then the opposition party votes being found in dumpsters the next morning etc. 
  guys , i think you got this backwards . 
  the government rigs the elections here as well , they do n't threaten people they just quietly change the results . 
   turkey is in the perfect position to be the bridge between two worlds literally . 
  and they are the bottom of the internet , if you look up at 4chan i pity you . 
  we all know there 's the occasional piece of wisdom but % 99 of the time it 's the most vile shit you can encounter . 
  i see what you are saying , but i think `` hostile '' opinions should n't be treated the same as `` non-hostile '' opinions . 
  ouch . 
  i think his point was that race for the purpose of categorization/classification of humans do not exist . 
  scientists of 19th century tried to rationalize or really just have a go at race , did n't work out and was labeled pseudoscience . 
  yeah , let 's discuss if negros really are hideous or not . 
  murdoch seems to own everything . 
  yeah , europe had a good run did n't they , i hope this is the famed asian century . 
   for over two thousand years europe was the center of the world , it was the capital of mankind . 
  the world was focused around europe . 
  it was always a country from europe that was the strongest in the world . 
  what in the ... no it was not actually , the [ great divergence ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_divergence ) happened after the 18th century , before that the euros were just an another society . 
  that 's extremely ethnocentric . 
   merkelreich  holy european empire, 
  you first . 
  yeah , that was sarcasm though . 
  but still , immigrant turks and turks who 've been here since the beginning ( 1071 ? ), 
  let 's say hold in general quite different opinions . 
  also if they are muslims who have their religious identity over their nationality they are also going to have corresponding beliefs . 
  i literally only hear greece/greeks mentioned in a conversation like `` the kurds do this that the americans do this that the brits do this that the xs do y z !, 
  what 's that ? 
  oh yeah greeks do this that too . 
  that 's just my anecdote though . 
  you 're in for a treat then . 
  * ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ they ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ shag ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ sheep . 
  uh , that was sarcasm , i do n't actually believe that . 
   ** youre ** / u / hits right on the spot ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  * why would they hate our guts we just kinda civilized them * ; _ ;, 
  tha 's kind of pointless is it not ? 
  here in good ol turkland nobody has cared or even thought about greece since the cyprus ** liberation !!!, 
  ** why do they keep spending that much and why would any sane person allow it ? 
  at least 3 children !, 
  this is one of the stupidest things i 've ever seen . 
  no self respecting radical islamist would name that `` operation trojan horse '' . 
  what ? 
  you are going to name your operation after an infidel tale ? 
  they would n't even use operation , i 'm about % 99 sure this is a false flag or some insane guy . 
  the point is nothing will change . 
  as far as the common man is concerned the only difference will be who embezzles the money . 
  their views are the same they just could n't agree on how much they 'd split the money . 
  this is n't even about the people , it 's erdo\u011fan supporters ( who hold the majority of the government ) versus g\u00fclen cultists , an islamic conspiracy type thing . 
  erdo\u011fan admitted that they manufactured evidence to jail the secular generals and i think they are going to be released . 
  thing is that definition is so broad pretty much everyone on earth can fit it . 
  used mean language at your friend to shut up about the news ? 
  ( do n't do that ) terrorizing !, 
  there 's a power struggle between erdo\u011fan and g\u00fclen and the recent leaks of immense government corruption made us deal with problems inside first , back to that in a bit hopefully !, 
   when you 're dealing with such complex issues , it 's not black and white . 
  good vs evil . 
  just tons of grey . . 
  this is exactly why it 's somewhat pointless . 
  everybody has different opinions and most of them are plausible so i think it 's better to leave that shit storm behind . 
  also does n't that mean all those deaths were for nothing as well ? 
  what you are saying is quite literally `` we did n't all get atomized , so he was right all along . '', 
  um , i think you deleted your previous identical comment and posted this ... anyways , the us did n't firebomb se asia to save lives ( how can someone in their right mind believe that ? ), 
  but to stop the spread of communism and it was tied with it 's struggle with soviets . 
  it would have been an entirely different timeline and discussing what-ifs if america did n't commit such barbarism has few points . 
  what nuclear winter again ? 
  i killed hundred thousands of people , but think of the bigger picture man !, 
  it 's all going to be worth it someday !, 
  that 's pretty bizarre to me , i 've met literally zero people caring about greece . 
  we have much more to worry about and greece is pretty much flailing it 's arms in the air . 
  not even the people who live in the aegean coast care . 
  i wonder why spain might want gibraltar . 
  ol' barack is strangely good looking in this . 
  aww they are so kawaii ~, 
  indeed , they are one of the last remaining populations to still practice fgm in turkey as well , your post makes it seem like it 's a utopia . 
  kurdish region is one of the most conservative and religious areas in turkey , that 's surprising . 
  i agree with you in this case but your account seems shady as fuck, 
  that was a joke and i do n't know how common non-muslims are . 
  mostly it 's either young people or godless wannabe communists from 1980 . 
  yes , our natural habitats are being destroyed by mining companies . 
  what kind of question is that & # 3232 ; _ & # 3232 ;, 
  you mean osman gazi ? 
  i liked the dude . 
  because you automatically get registered as muslim on birth . 
  large part of my family are n't muslims but they are listed as such . 
  i told my parents i wanted to get it changed but they said it 'd reduce my opportunities and just create unnecessary bumps here and there , and it was relatively hard so we decided to let it be since it does n't bother us . 
  and our common ancestor is genghis khan !, 
  let 's become best friends !, 
  i think they meant fat man or little boy . 
  this is seems like a completely fabricated annoyance . 
  how is he supposed to say what he is then ? 
  if you * are an atheist like myself who downvotes ( again , signifies negativity in general ) because of another person 's religion you ai n't right . 
  and the number of bigots sound severely deflated . 
  \\* ** plural you , feel free to exclude yourself . 
  that was more of a statement and was off-topic , i guess you are right on that one . 
  and that 's still more than half .
