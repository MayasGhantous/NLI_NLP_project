  stop assuming so much . 
  i 'm strongly against islam/all religions . 
  just because they are asian or african or whatever else does n't mean they are immune to nuttery just like europeans . 
  you should back your doomsday talks with some evidence , evidence that is n't `` i saw a brown guy on the news !!! '', 
  please for the love of everything that is holy , define culture . 
  well race is whatever one wants it to be because it has no definitive meaning . 
  it can also include physical differences as well as anatomical , cultural , ethnic , genetic , geographical , historical , linguistic , religious and social affiliation . 
  thus , racist is a very broad accusation . 
  and i would say that having different treatment for `` ethnically-indigenous '' ( he obviously meant white-european but let 's pretend otherwise and argue even more ) and others is very much racist . 
  [ from wikipedia for what it 's worth . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/race_%28human_classification%29 ), 
   ethnically-indigenous  not racist at all . 
  i know i know , wish that verb was not hijacked !!!, 
  by scat players . 
  this thread is getting some downvote bombing runs . 
  this is only valid for western part of the country . 
  the eastern part ( generally dominated by either kurds or nationalist + religious turks . ), 
  is less likely to think that . 
  [ it is . 
  ] ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=hitlered ), 
  whoa whoa , slow down there , hitler . 
  this guy sure keeps repeating `` our '' and `` we '' a lot . 
  i 'd like to see him give this speech in front of the people he 's insulting . 
  i do n't know about this ... 
  though you should still take what vice says/shows with a planet of salt , they are known to be sensationalistic at time . 
  what does traditional mean ? 
  it 's about the eu it 's about us everything is eurocentric !!!, 
  no but seriously , they just care about their own interests . 
  i did not say i would n't fight against him . 
  i just find protests entertaining and exciting when i 'm not covering for my life . 
  calm your bollocks . 
  as long as i 'm not personally in any danger i find it amusing to be honest . 
  glad you liked my although :3, 
  this is probably also why racism did n't take off as much as europe or americas . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ nationalism ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ whole ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ different ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ beast, 
  although i like how people can remind the police that there are consequences to their brutality i do n't think `` cop did bad thing !, 
  get 'em '' is a good thing . 
  there is a point where no stability and mass riots are worse than some corruption . 
  you say kidnap , i say scholarship . 
  these are both 3 years old . 
  i think you should know better to not speak with such authority because of a news article you saw . 
  haha 1459 best time of my life tupac alive in eyalet of rumelia add kebab ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ remove ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ me ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ pls ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ; _ ;, 
  do n't know where you are taking this from mate , we were taught evolution in biology and such and creationism in islam ( yeah , we are taught islam , shit that fuck ) . 
  also muslims do n't believe creationism the same way christians might , they just say `` whatever happened happened because of god and there is no other way . 
  big bang ? 
  yeah , god did it . '', 
  they are more open to things like this . 
  i can see why . 
  were you banned or something ? 
  there is no 3rd party in this , you are either with akp or against . 
  i think the polls are conducted by government workers , my relative was even offered to do that but she declined . 
  the public can do some fucktarded things . 
  also i think cops oversee them , which might you know , might make things disappear wink wink . 
  whoa whoa , let 's not get into homophobic language here . 
  actually , votes are sometimes rigged ( power `` suddenly '' going out , theft of the voting box thingies and finding a bunch of chp votes in the dump next morning etc ) and akp literally bringing in dual citizens or whatever from other countries to vote for them . 
  these guys are most definitely not % 50 + . 
  i do n't know why the vote rig stories were not paid much attention to . 
  akp is still nevertheless a very strong and dominant party indeed . 
  however with the current corruption scandals i hope that signals their end . 
  also there were some translation difficulties and it ( the thing they sign that i do n't know the name of ) was only in persian , they signed it anyway . 
  i 'm pretty the sure the official name has been istanbul since the 20s . 
  i hope others leaders get in on this !, 
  you seem to really hate lefties . 
  left count : 4, 
  or you can just anonymously hire one . 
  hey europeans , please stop downvoting people for their opinions . 
  yeah , his/her opinion is an uncommon one ` round here but at least stop the `` i disagree , therefore fuck off '' attitude . 
  he did n't attack anyone and is contributing to the discussion . 
  if you keep doing this you 'll only get circlejerks . 
  what 's that ? 
  man come on . 
  that 's indian , they 'd be confused if anything else . 
  do it right . 
  use [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pto96rqxzw4 ) instead . 
  yeah , people from the ** ottoman empire ** introduced it so euros did n't even name it , just `` ottoman '' . 
  pretty bizarre . 
  are n't these the same 4/dozen guys that tried this shit and got arrested and every dumbass flooded to cash in the story ? 
  i think sharia law is disgusting too but at least know what you are up against mate . 
  it is n't valid to non-muslims as far as i 'm told by actual muslims . 
   return to fight on home soil . 
  wait what ? 
  i 'm not very well informed on this but has there ever been cases of firefights in uk by foreign fighters ( except irish ) recently ? 
  i wonder if people actually just ... left ? 
  would these guys still preach to the choir ? 
  like i hate x !, 
  i hate x too !, 
  remove x !, 
  you are not doing it right , here let me do it . 
  i am qualified in being hated by neo-nazis . 
  dangnabbit euros , if only they bothered to properly name things that were imported from turkey . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ like ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ color ^ ^ ^ ^ turquoise ^ ^ ^ ^ or ^ ^ ^ ^ ottoman ^ ^ ^ ^ furniture ^ ^ ^ ^ but ^ ^ ^ ^ hey, 
  * ^ ^ you ^ ^ again ... *, 
  are you actually seriously defending these cops \u0ca0_\u0ca0, 
  oh for fuck 's sake , why are you insulting me now and why are you getting upvoted in the process ? 
  that low blow to my flair was uncalled for . 
  same here in turkey , granted i 'm in a pretty touristic place we had entire `` english streets '' as we called them . 
  owned by elderly english people . 
  one of their ( assuming ) daughter liked to run around naked while drunk and vomiting everywhere , fun times . 
  none of em knew turkish but still , weird people . 
  yeah , i 've been there ( or at least kurdish majority areas of turkey ) , if i may say it 's * nothing significant , just another city/town .
