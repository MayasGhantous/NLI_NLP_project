  edit : muh arm, 
  exactly . 
  you ca n't even write derogatory slurs on people 's windows with excrement these days . 
  are we going to allow political correctness to dictate our lives ? 
  the nerve of these brown people , jeez . 
  in a vice documentary ( take it with a grain of salt ) i 've even seen a romanian mayor try to ban the word roma because other people thought roma and romanians were the same . 
  tell me about it . 
  see , we ca n't even agree on what ethnicity is let alone what foreign is . 
  was the the troubles a political or ethno-nationalist conflict ? 
  i 'd bet \u0130brahim pa\u015fa was n't seen as entirely foreign though , kinda like american immigrants . 
  they 've got different backgrounds but they are all american in the end . 
  same deal with him . 
  indeed that 's why many turks object to calling ottomans `` turkey '' . 
  it was n't turkish , it was muslim . 
   the idea of ruling ~ ~ foreign peoples ~ ~ anyone as an underclass is so obviously flawed now , but how nobody saw it at the time is fascinating . 
  also , what is foreign changed . 
  in oe you were foreign if you believed in a different religion , now in most countries it 's tied to something unchangeable like ethnicity . 
  still , back then people believed in wacky shit like racial inferiority and social darwinism . 
  not that outlandish that they 'd believe that too . 
  and yes , this is an australian map . 
  yeah , the rest of the world did n't get to make a steam engine because their land was too aesthetically pleasing . 
  huh , so that 's where our word for poop ( kaka ) comes from . 
  [ how about this non-eurocentric map ? 
  ] ( http://flourish.org/upsidedownmap/hobodyer-large.jpg ), 
  just come out and say might makes right . 
   norway ranked the best country ~ ~ in which to grow old ~ ~ we are done here . 
  of course it 's not . 
  he 's talking out of his ass . 
  i do n't think you know what revolution means . 
  civil war maybe . 
  ### america # 1, 
  that 's the thing , thrace is greyed out . 
  [ h'what ? 
   `` crossing the border feels like going from south korea to north korea '' the only good one here is this . 
  most of the time when people call us cruel or whatever we just double down and say we want to take more and it ends up backfiring on them and they get angrier . 
  what 's the controversy with makarios and grivas ? 
  these can be altered at will really . 
  just look at how it cuts off the greek islands , cyprus and thrace . 
  my dad has the stories like this . 
  when he was in military hospital in the 90s he ran into many ptsd ridden young men . 
  i 'll let you figure that out . 
  seems like it 's going to take a while . 
  no no , what was the point of it ? 
  the point , what was it do you think ? 
  * you impoverished your own country and enriched mine !, 
  the babies did n't ask to have their their foreskin cut off , their ethnicity or religion is irrelevant . 
   considering what you propose is effectively an expulsion of jews . 
  what the fuck ? 
  someone could n't handle their rak\u0131 . 
  `` third level educated '' does n't even mean anything . 
  muslamic ray guns all over again . 
  we have a lot more now . 
  depends on where they come from and sometimes their level of education . 
  inner/east anatolia is more likely to be religious . 
  eh , most scandinavian countries have less population than our big cities . 
  old news but do they also ban factory farming or having sex with animals ? 
  that shit is more inhumane than either halal or kosher . 
  - everyone should be able to wear whatever they want , we want freedom guys !, 
  - no you ca n't wear that , absolutely haram . 
  also mandatory islam classes . 
  covering up women is done so that their beauty is only reserved for their husband and so that other men ca n't get dat booty , they apply this to children ? 
  ~ ~ *** devlet\u00dcl \u0130slaaam !!!, 
  *** ~ ~ i wonder who these are and what happened to them to bring them to this state . 
  but seriously , no government is `` pretending to not see '' them . 
  they might say that but these guys are under watch . 
  going to poland for ... a thing huh ? 
  it 's not about america though ... 
  or maybe the dude was named that because it was popular in the first place . 
  oh lol , that video again . 
  mehmet is definitely not muhammed here . 
  they might have originated from the same root but mehmet is very much a distinct name and i did n't even know the two were similar until a few years ago . 
  i 've heard some arabs insist it is ( also heard the two are spelled the same wat ) and we probably have twice as many mehmets . 
   uk :  we drink a lot of tea noobs . 
  fool . 
  we already control your politicians but then again only allah controls , we are only his tools . 
  it 's probably a relic of colonial era ethnocentrism . 
  allah damn you 're talking right out of your ass . 
  he 's now the president ( cumhurba\u015fkan\u0131 ) so he 'll be in his custom made palace for ... 7 years . 
  you never know though ( \u0360 \u00b0 \u035f\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  can confirm , the sunlight is real . 
  surprising that it goes all the way to \u00c7anakkale , that region is known for being relatively cold . 
  i know right ? 
  \\ #justg\u00f6beklitepethings, 
  i know how ridiculous that line is mate . 
  calm down . 
  i 'm saying that it 's also ridiculous that you guys are talking about albanians settling in those areas as if it happened yesterday . 
  400 years is a long fucking time . 
  pls no more balkanization, 
  this happened in the motherfucking ** 1600s ** for fuck 's sake . 
  cmon . 
  i wonder if my poop keeps disturbing people even after its disposal . 
  the beyliks do n't have their seal of solomon flags 0/10, 
  well i personally ca n't accept or deny this . 
  he said `` our '' government , maybe he 's dutch ? 
  that right there is a trooper . 
  got ta get all the beards . 
  `` i support israel because they kill muslims and we have a place to put jews in . '', 
  they stiil da jubs -  they 're lazy and do n't work they only take welfare and sit around -  would you be ok with germans going to turkey and setting up shops en masse ? 
  all said to me unironically . 
  so much for the *** freeze peach !!! 111 !!!,
