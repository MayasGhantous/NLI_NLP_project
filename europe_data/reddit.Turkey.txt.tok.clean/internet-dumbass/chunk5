  well that 's where i live and the question was `` your region '' so i answered only for my region . 
  `` if those regions were to be independent . '', 
  if they do n't have to reapply that 's cool too . 
  only if we get into the eu and nato and such . 
  you just said exactly what / r/europe would like to hear . 
  you 're not even muslim . 
  kinda like the `` as a black guy , racism is totally ok '' . 
  wait , reddittor for 6 hours . 
  anyone who believes this man and his bait thread is a fool . 
  telling what ? 
  [ ccc let me barge in ccc ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhupaowklna ) [ also obviously this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ergss6dzack ), 
  `` wait , you ca n't go to a bird ! '', 
   turks are a very nationalistic people , its a survival mechanism when you 're sandwiched between two worlds , each world disliking you for being too like the other . 
  this statement has no basis whatsoever and is psuedo-social science . 
  i think nationalism is a wicked ideology and everyone would be better off without it . 
  it could 've been very well used to replace religion or tribal ties or something entirely different . 
  we do n't know ( maybe we could with some research * ^ ^ ^ hint * ) . 
  thank you not being a hypocrite . 
  even though i obviously think you 're a racist cunt i appreciate the honesty . 
  someone needs to keep it real in / r/europe, 
  `` turkey is not in europe ( a horribly ethnocentric concept as it is ) '' and where is cyprus ? 
  `` but the culture ... '' what do you mean cultu ~ * -22 points 9 hours ago *, 
  bunch of baseless statements . 
  i 'll give you this though , our islamists think being a muslim means being an arab for whatever reason . 
  feel pious ? 
  use arabic loanwords !, 
  feel even more pious ? 
  get cozy with gulf monarchies !, 
  we have no east coast :o but you are correct on the rest . 
  invalid point . 
  prepare for downvotes . 
  star and crescent were ottoman symbols ( i 've heard that iran still rejects it ) , they might have gotten it from romans or tengriism . 
  it was only very recently taken by arabs and islam . 
  yes . 
  invalid opinion . 
  black sea coast , istanbul and ankara vote akp . 
  if the massive migration to istanbul from inner anatolia and kurdish regions had n't happened they 'd probably vote chp . 
   fuck besiktas and ** fenerbahce . 
  ** ### fuck you, 
  it 's western-eastern here as well . 
  all of the western coast ( thrace to hatay ) vote chp ( leftie nationalists ) , inner anatolians vote akp ( conservatives ) and the provinces near the iraq-iran border vote bdp ( kurdish separatists ) . 
  serbia . 
   galatasaray ### lies, 
   the, 
   self-masturbating, 
  atat\u00fcrk was hip as hell, 
  256 jihad points jihad reaching critical mass, 
  what are you trying to say ? 
  you can just say the name instead of going through the trouble of flinging links . 
  yay a single battle . 
  let 's compare our imperialism dicks . 
  um , lem me say something about that . 
  ### hahahahahahaha, 
  those are not ethnic groups . 
  `` concerned about the future of their people and culture . '', 
  yeah right . 
  got ta keep those as vague as possible . 
  also weird downvoting pattern this sub has , i was going between 2 and -2 and suddenly downed to -22 . 
  happens a lot . 
  yeah , sad they did n't go * guys , do these guys worship god the same way the people do just over the coast ? 
  if not let 's tie them to a region hundreds of kms away . 
  except the neighborhood moved into you and the neighborhood itself is arbitrarily defined by ethnocentrism . 
  apparently does n't matter to the cia and it 's geographically % 100 in asia . 
  still , how so ? 
  there is no allah but allah . 
  well then uh ... 
  they are um , they are fat !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfsvcqbybgy ), 
  it 's a guy and yes . 
  cyprus is closer to syria , anatolia and lebanon than europe , cia makes much more sense to be honest . 
  what do you think politically correct means ? 
  either way we 're gon na hump you mate . 
  whine and cry to your sweet heart 's desire . 
  resistance is futile . 
  that 's cool . 
  do n't force this on other people . 
  they 'll do it if they want . 
  people are much more complex than `` being part of a culture '' all the time . 
  statistics might be misleading . 
  well they should 've dressed up as colonial troops to satisfy their power fantasies then . 
  europeans in medieval times got their shit kicked in . 
  keep in mind most rapes are committed by someone the victim knows and so their likeliness to report it is much lower . 
  ** bold words . 
  uh no , `` moderate muslims '' do n't have any responsibility for whatever other people do . 
  prolonged sunlight exposure can do [ that ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vcelvgm.jpg ) but who are we kidding , sun does n't exist in england . 
  dunno guys , this is pretty effective . 
  i was repulsed by these guys immediately . 
  elizabeth has gained 450 culture this turn . 
  come on . 
  oh boy , welcome to the club . 
  i would be careful about that , it 's from 1939 . 
  not doubting it 's influence on sociology and such but it * might * be a little dated . 
  that 's no beard , he just pasted his pubes on his chin . 
  i 've noticed this sub is one of the most downvote-happy places i 've ever been to . 
  i was surprised that i was n't downvoted in some other sub after disagreeing with someone about literally anything then went `` ah , i 'm not in / r/europe . '', 
  the struggle is real, 
   i think the internet permanently destroyed the notion of local culture . 
  do you base this on anything ? 
  by `` being real '' i meant let 's call it what it is . 
  if you do n't think ethnic cleansing is a bad thing , say so .
