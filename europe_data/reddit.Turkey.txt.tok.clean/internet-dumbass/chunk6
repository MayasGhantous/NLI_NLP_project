  i agree with you , i 'm a postnationalist but let 's be real . 
  then it becomes genocide . 
  welcome to the club . 
   nationally enforced cultural delimitation . 
  also called ethnic cleansing . 
  `` reservations '' , yes . 
  kinda misleading , stories i 've heard are the opposite , rampant substance abuse and cycles of violence etc in most tribes and the bulk if not all of the money goes to the elders/elite or whatever they call em . 
  not really , apparently it was changed because the new republic wanted to distance themselves from the ottomans . 
  we should 've gone full nationalist and named it new turpan or something . 
  nope , literally nothing comes from there . 
  [ well judging by this map ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/thrace_and_present-day_state_borderlines.png ) you guys have the smallest part of thrace so it 's west thrace for you . 
  ^ let 's ^ leave ^ bulgaria ^ out ^ of ^ this . 
  yes . 
  indeed , my comment made as much sense as folks incoherently babbling about * danish not meaning danish citizen * etc. 
  whenever i see idiots shouting like this i go to the other end of the extreme because why not ? 
  i want to see the glorious forehead of tayyip in thrace . 
  good , hopefully these fighters will have more political presence in denmark too . 
  both . 
  turkmen in iraq and syria do n't seem to be speaking turkmen though . 
  i 've heard them being called turkomans instead . 
  yes , all oghuz languages ( turkish , gagauz , azeri , turkmen ) are mutually intelligible . 
  i think some azeris lean more towards iran than us . 
  iran has more azeris than azerbaijan and all . 
  dawkins just straight up lost it . 
  [ also this :3 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_t4pksq7bi ), 
  it describes * wealthy * white americans of english protestant ancestry . 
  it would n't be the same with a black american with english protestant ancestors . 
  edit : in italic, 
  i know right , i worship talat pa\u015fa everyday . 
  that comment was 561 years late . 
  holy european empire , you heard it here first folks . 
  it 's your own ignorance . 
  projection . 
  stop being a reactionary idiot . 
   i 'd rather have a german as a neighbor than a romanian family that is if you do n't get an underage german girl drinking and vomiting in the street . 
  ^ ^ ^ had ^ ^ ^ one ^ ^ ^ of ^ ^ ^ these just say you want decent people , period . 
  * you guys got ta do this more often , it 's pretty cool . 
  le ... le baguette . 
  they were actually . 
  certainly much more than the christians . 
  oh yes , the rampant islamophobia is just frustration to islam spreading far and away as it should . 
  dude , he 's 1/256 greek . 
  he knows his shit . 
  very good . 
  what a beautiful name , inshallah it will cover all capitals everywhere . 
  damn , where i live we always get 50c + in summer . 
  this time it hit 60c . 
  shit 's on fire yo . 
  bring me all the islands you have , all of them . 
  aww , we needed a rematch for all those islands . 
   homophobes maybe , after all whenever i link to news about homophobic attacks i also get downvoted by / r/europe ( see my most recent submission here ) . 
  i remember that , `` degenerates !, 
  this sub gets pretty bad once in a while . 
  damn this dude is still around . 
  except people flip out when you gas rebels ( \u256f \u00b0 \u25a1 \u00b0 \uff09 \u256f \u253b \u2501 \u253b, 
  naw , we 'll rename them `` fotog ( former ottoman territory of greece ) '' and whine about it endlessly . 
  [ i 'm nigel farage .

  quantity *, 
  this is not a video game , what are you talking about ? 
  seems like you go on unnecessary superficial rants when you 're not guided . 
  well go and spread your message of some woman being ugly far and away then . 
  eu citizen . 
  i 've seen multiple comments from you about the same `` issue '' and by the looks of it you 're committed . 
  ask him how he went there and request him to document his travels . 
  could be immensely useful knowledge . 
  istanbul is more populous than some european countries including greece . 
  if anything it would be istanbul absorbing greece . 
  yes , we get it . 
  she 's ugly . 
  bring it down . 
  we also get a lot of russians but i 've not seen many russians of this sort . 
  they tend to be quiet , enjoy their time and go . 
  i live in `` the mediterranean '' and we 're definitely different than landlocked folk , especially the villages . 
  everyone is happier there but i would n't trade faster internet for anything . 
  yeah it 's fucking awesome . 
  that 's not what i mean . 
  i mostly agree with you . 
  nukes are just too good to give up . 
  some nation somewhere will always have one up their sleeve . 
   all nukes should be dismantled by everybody . 
  i do n't think this will happen , ever . 
  more like arab hero . 
  i did n't know we had that many billies , damn . 
  actually , the downvoters seem annoyed by this . 
  projection and frustration is what it is . 
  the obvious thing to do here is get the empire up and running again and install tayyip i as our padi\u015fah . 
  there was no invasion of `` a fellow nato member '' and the invasion itself was fully justified . 
  i said nothing more , nothing less . 
  what part can you guys not grasp here ? 
  what are you talking about ? 
  [ members of nato . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/history_of_nato_enlargement.svg ), 
  we were fully justified in the initial invasion . 
  look it up . 
  the struggle is real, 
  also he 's a puppet of tayyip . 
  what i do n't get is `` the market will correct itself '' . 
  it never has and never will . 
  we 'll bomb you .
