  that beheading in uk ? 
  that 's not even the tip of the iceberg . 
  we circumcise that too . 
  well not just on earth , on the moon too . 
  but i think nearly a quarter of our population is in europe so ... 
  both . 
  i hear the arab-hate is worse for people in the eastern provinces as i reckon they 've received the most amount of refugees . 
  ** teeekb\u0130\u0130\u0130\u0130\u0130\u0130r !, 
  every ~ ~ white ~ ~ christian death by my own hands brings me closer to allah . 
  \u0130n\u015fallah we will make our home in europe and remove infidels like you . 
  yup , that 's literally the only reason i think that way . 
  you got it . 
  also do n't get me wrong , europe/asia are perfectly fine geographical terms , i just do n't think they are continents . 
  someone from the mu\u011fla province , y' know how there is - an - ian - ese ? 
  i did n't know what to put there . 
  meh , bratwursts are known german spies . 
  you said if people consider it a continent , it is one then went on to convince me that europe actually is a continent . 
  if that is the case i said i do n't consider it a continent thus i say it 's not one . 
  and that 's the end of that . 
  [ this video explains that quite nicely . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ubcq1x7p34 ) 6 , it 's clearly 6 . 
  either way , i do n't think europe is a continent and you do . 
  that 's the end of that . 
  yeah , that 's some equally delusional apocalypse talk . 
  relax , your nice cozy place is going to be just fine . 
  yes , why is it scary ? 
  i know i know , i was in disbelief that two cultures so removed could be mistaken for each other . 
  the only thing `` oriental '' about that building is the cream color . 
  also the ones who unconditionally support israel because they think all jews need to be in the land of israel etc etc. 
  plus the guys mikey weinstein talks about , i do n't know how right he is but hey there 's that . 
  yup , muslims are spooky !, 
  well i 'm not the one downvoting all of his posts and accusing him of being schizophrenic . . ^ ^ ^ look ^ ^ ^ at ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ map ^ ^ ^ sometime but yeah , europe is a bullshit continent . 
  why did you get upset ? 
  i did n't mean to ... 
  yeah no , you do n't get to live in your own little continent because you think you 're special . 
   greatest continent on earth and all that . 
  it 's so great that it 's made up . 
  bursa is in western anatolia & # 3232 ; _ & # 3232 ; but yeah , eastern provinces have sand storms and heat waves in the summer and freezing cold in the winter , i do n't know why people live in that extreme weather . 
  this is more mughal than turkish . 
  where have you seen anything like this in former oe ? 
   right, 
  also insurgency . 
  us does n't have to deal with that . 
  us is declining ? 
  norway ? 
  tibet ?

  we do n't do it because it 's easy but because it 's hard . 
  of course we 'd be looked at as weird because it 's an unusual choice . 
  they are in uluda\u011f . 
  we should bring these style of mustaches back . 
  [ there are a lot of good ones but this is currently my favorite .

  quick , invest in eastern ireland . 
  i know i know , i 'm making a joke ^ ^ ^ ^ but ^ ^ ^ ^ all ^ ^ ^ ^ jokes ^ ^ ^ ^ have ^ ^ ^ ^ an ^ ^ ^ ^ element ^ ^ ^ ^ of ^ ^ ^ ^ sincerity ^ ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ ^ them . 
  meh , i really do n't care . 
  that 's the point . 
  but muh freeze peach tho, 
  israel is n't dangerous at all , come here anytime !, 
  -  we 're literally being bombarded from all directions , destroy hamas !, 
  -  israel is n't dangerous at all , come here anytime !, 
  -  we 're literally being bombarded from all directions , destroy hamas !, 
  \u221e at least choose one . 
  well i do n't know anyone from bielefeld and i 've never been there . 
  maybe you 're on to something here ... 
  yes actually , i think * slightly * more people would be ok with it . 
  i was making a jab at / r/european though , we all know what they 're made of . 
  you can say black . 
  come on , let it all out / r/european s. 
  your loss . 
  i did n't see this comi - yes i did . 
  everybody did . 
  i completely understand , i do n't think we should at this joke of a state either . 
  islamists out , secularism in . 
  it 's tayyipli union now . 
  it wo n't be ottomans until someone named osman comes along again . 
  the autobahn is real . 
   they love the way he is battling corruption the fuck ? 
  this is the same guy who got caught pants down stealing billions . 
  this is the same guy who said he bought his son a `` just a little ship ( gemicik ) '' which turned out to be a pretty huge fucking ship and many more . 
  he has mastered nepotism to the n . this is so surreal , this country is collectively losing it 's mind . 
  also hagia sophia , sultan ahmet , derinkuyu , kapal\u0131\u00e7ar\u015f\u0131 vb . . 
  that war does n't seem to be over yet . 
  we 'll see how it ends . 
  then get comfortable , you 're going to wait for a while . 
  but really the appropriate thing to do here is getting a crazy homeless dude and telling him he 's this guy . 
  you do n't need to repeat yourself . 
  all muslims are batshit insane by default amirite !, 
  i see an alarming lack of slurs in this post though . 
  what is the quality of life increase i 've been hearing so much about ? 
  proof ? 
  he makes good ivory towers got ta give the man that . 
  dude just admitted he likes shy women , nothin wrong with some domination play here and there . 
  actually , kurds vote akp . 
  he split the akp votes if anything else . 
  most political kurds are far-left but vast majority of them are apolitical . 
  no , i have no irredentism in me . 
  it 's legally their territory . 
  they want it to stay . 
  it 'll stay theirs .
