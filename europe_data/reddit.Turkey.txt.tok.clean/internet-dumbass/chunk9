  probably because i was being sarcastic . 
  this is literally the very definition of fascism . 
  all of it ? 
  maybe allowing charities to request as much unsold food as they need would be a better decision , for example if you 've got 200 mouths to feed for 2 months and you can prove it you can request enough food to satisfy that amount . 
  `` la la la la i ca n't hear yoouu !!! '', 
  oh boy you 're in for a surprise, 
  where they keep suspected members of organizations they do n't like , including ordinary european citizens . 
  no , that was because of internal conflict . 
  makes for a good story though . 
  has n't it only been 2 decades since their independence ? 
  akp has already ruled for slightly more than a decade so it 's not that surprising . 
  all of those coups were by the us to hunt communists during the cold war . 
  this is used by islamists in their attempt to discredit secularism ( who would even think a magic guy makes more sense than this is beyond me ) . 
  you have the turkish flair on : i, 
  he literally said `` democracy is not a goal but a means to reach our goals '' . 
  who fell for the `` democratic reformer '' bullcrap ? 
  also this seems like a really biased article , i was generally fine with it until this ;  the generals planned a coup , but erdogan quickly reacted . 
  he publicly reprimanded the military leadership and installed g\u00fcl as president three months later . 
  the fighter from kasimpasa had outfoxed the generals and prevailed . 
  the fuck ? 
  this is a complete fabrication . 
  the ergenekon trials had no basis whatsoever . 
  even some of their friends admitted this . 
  they only did this to insert akp sympathizers into the military and jail secularists . 
  so democratic . 
  read ba\u015fbu\u011f 's book `` su\u00e7lamalara kar\u015f\u0131 ger\u00e7ekler ( truths against allegations ) '' , he himself explains it all . 
  oh wait , this article is written by hasnain kazim , a pakistani and most likely a muslim , disregard this person . 
  rubbish article , would n't wipe my mother 's sweet arse with . 
  refugee ? 
  i 'm not trying to refute that though . 
  that 's not what i 'm talking about . 
  i am simply saying that modern problems would be a more appropriate analogy for that list . 
  well , we do n't anyway . 
   turkey of denying armenian genocide human rights for kurds would be a better example i think because it 's a modern problem . 
  no one gives a single fuck what happened 100 years ago . 
  also east turkistan . 
  nah , they saved the country sure but no golden age . 
  soldiers were literally starving by the 100,000 s. 
  i think his reign was the peak of the ottoman empire . 
  architecture , literary arts etc. 
  flourished and wealth kept pouring in . 
  but really , a broader definition could be all the way from the turkic migrations up to the 1700s , they generally enjoyed total military dominance over others and were free to do as they liked until they were checked in the 18th century onwards . 
  all 6935 of them . 
  based suleiman, 
   i have nothing against xenophobia & # 3232 ; _ & # 3232 ;, 
  it used to be as low as 25 kuru\u015f for students ( probably < 0.10 $ ? ), 
  i think it 's about 1 lira now . 
  also since the driver does the same routes over and over again they tend to master it . 
  never seen 'em crash or anything in all my years . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dolmu%c5%9f these are largely in small towns where a big ol bus would be unnecessary . 
  they are cheap , fast and convenient . 
  i live in a small town and use these all the time . 
  honestly prefer these to the big city ones . 
  damn son that was so deep i ca n't see the surface anymore, 
  actually , no . 
  he is ** worse ** than ** hitler ** . 
  hitler never had a bird take a shit on him and he ** supported ** animal rights . 
  i am sure ** putin ** 360nopolonium 'd that poor bird shortly after . 
  conclusion ; hitler  putin ^ ^ ^ ^ ok ^ ^ ^ ^ this ^ ^ ^ ^ was ^ ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ ^ trainwreck,

  exactly . 
  let 's both shut the fuck up then . 
  says a dutchman , forgot about the dutch colonies already ? 
  it 's nice to go through shit like this everyday . 
  matter of fact . 
   far exceed anything france did . 
  it is n't about turks either but please do ramble on . 
   considering ** your people ** killed millions of middle east christians a few decades ago with no blowback whatsoever . 
  wtf also coming from a french dude . 
  france did n't have a worldwide empire based on exploitation or anything . 
  oops i said something people do n't agree with . 
  people tend to be in danger during civil war . 
  either attempt to help all of them out or buckle up and sit tight . 
  well i do n't know what kind of media you 're consuming but this is a giant pile of bullshit . 
  only for christians though . 
  greeks and thracians running around . 
  exactly !, 
  these turks have little idea what is actually going on in the country yet they are allowed to vote in our elections . 
  they should concern themselves with germany 's future , not ours . 
  akp knows they are clueless so they do n't do anything about it . 
  [ for people who ca n't visualize this scenario , you 're in luck because we 've got the footage to help you out .

  chill , i 'm not trying to argue about anything . 
  let 's get to the end of this , what are you * really * trying to say ? 
   look it up  i do n't need to look it up k ok serious , what are you trying to say here ? 
  good . 
  always be skeptical . 
  either get in x country with forged passports and kill the big guys and slip out or have the x governments comply and kill the big guys regardless and have it covered up . 
  disagrees with me = troll also we all know politicians are the beacon of truth and honesty . 
  do n't mistake my comment for supporting nationalism , i think it 's good that all ethnicites do n't have their own cute little nations . 
  i also fancy postnationalism . 
  `` ethnic self-determination '' has taken enough lives already . 
  i wonder when the roma will get their own country . 
  mod of / r/european , everyone . 
  but he literally asked if us journalists were murdered because of their criticism of america , i was making an example . 
  by the way that bit about obama is bullshit . 
  he 's a lizard and last i checked lizards do n't go on vacations . 
  wake the fuck up . 
  michael hastings ' death was pretty bizarre .
