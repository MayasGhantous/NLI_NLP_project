no one even knows his name , people do n't see him as a hero , maybe a very few people do but not a single one in my experience , most people were disgusted and outraged about what happened hence the whole marches hundreds and thousands of people did . 
  you do realise that we do not agree that there was a genocide right ? 
  also they are liked for reasons besides what happened wth armenians , do you really think that we would celebrate them because they caused the death of some armenians ? 
  `` warmongering ataturk '' how much do you know about ataturk ? 
  sounds like you do n't really know anything about him . 
  how many turks in southern cyprus ? 
  that was a stupid reply . 
  it was not regarded as ethnic cleansing at all nor was it an illegal invasion . 
  i think it actually speaks volumes when the people themselves see people like them as heroes . 
  there are also other killers who were seen as heroes like soghomon tehlirian who even has statues in his honour . 
  what about the people who makes a hero of gourgen yanikian ? 
  oh right with the [ khojaly massacre ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/khojaly_massacre ) and all right ? 
  cyprus was not invaded illegally actually and nor was there an ethnic cleansing done . 
  trnc was made to ensure security of the turkish people living in cyprus, 
  do n't you guys also see members of asala as heroes ? 
  gourgen yanikian is also seen as a hero despite murdering innocent turkish consul officers . 
  / r/europe just does n't like the idea of lots of refugees , that 's pretty much it , either way they do n't want them coming . 
  calling it brainwashing is pretty dumb imo , also i defend it as i 'm directly descended from multiple of these people who went through such things , i think it 's fantastic how lucky people were to be able to have the opportunities to leave a crappy life and to become elites and even the grand vizier like some of my ancestors were !, 
  the idea of slavery is very different from the east and the west , our people were n't in shackled from morning to night forced to work on a farm never amounting to anything ever . 
  slavery in the west was pure cruelty and just terrible . 
  i ai n't downvote nobody but got damn , 8 years on reddit ? 
  what are you doing man ? 
  also i thought it was called karma, 
  i do n't see a reason why that really matters , it 's just what people call the country , i guess maybe it 's like not calling it `` the republic of turkey '' when you talk about turkey every time , you just call it turkey . 
  it 's not brainwashing , you call what parents do teaching their kids their religion and that it 's the only right religion brain washing ? 
  i do n't see why switching religions is such a horrible thing either btw . 
  also i 'm happy my ancestors were part of this system , it really gave them a chance to be something instead of being some farmer in serbia . 
  this 1854 map of world religion appeared as part of an atlas published in scotland by cartographer alexander keith johnston . 
  oy vey what a thick head, 
  you 're the most retarded poster on this site , it 's just impossible to argue with you . 
  [ this map is i think from 1854 ] ( http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/the_vault/2014/06/09/largereligionmap,jpg.jpg ) , you can clearly see it says turkey but it does n't say ottoman empire . 
  ottoman empire 's name was also turkey though , even if you look at western maps from hundreds of years ago you 'll see this . 
  why do you call it brainwashing ? 
   the dev\u015firme system could be considered a form of slavery because the sultans had absolute power over them . 
  however , as the ` slave ' or ` kul ' of the sultan had high status within ottoman society , they could become the highest officers of state and the military elite , and all taken children ( but not their parents ) were well remunerated . 
  our brand of slavery was different , here 's a [ picture someone had posted here before ] ( http://imgur.com/19tqnzs ) , ottoman slaves were elites of the empire . 
  read about it . 
   christians second-class citizens , took their children and converted them to islam . 
  you should continue this sentence , it 's incomplete converted them to islam and made them into elites of the empire , including badass janissaries and grand viziers , some of which held greater power than the sultan . 
  i could n't be more proud that my family was part of the devsirme system . 
  my ancestors were serbs too . 
  you know it 's funny , the ottomans listed hungarians as christian turks in a lot of documents and tax listings iirc also those guys look like cossacks when you look at the hairstyles . 
  blonde hair , blue eyes , white skin ... yeah but he had a lot of turkic ancestry consisting of turkmen and yoruk heritage . 
  i thank the devsirme system personally , i 'm happy to be a turk today . 
  system would have ( and should have ) been abolished earlier however if it were n't for those meddling janissaries who did n't allow it to end . 
  we were attacking isis then the pkk attacked us and became a priority . 
  because turkish majority lands ** can not ** be european . 
  lygos may have been the fishing settlement but constantinople was a tiny tiny part of modern day istanbul , the megacity deserves its own name as it has far outgrown what constantinople was . 
  just how much remains from the greek city anyway ? 
  are you even aware ? 
  almost the whole of istanbul is completely turkish built . 
  never was ? 
  it was a greek city when it used to be lygos dude . 
  why the fuck should i pay you for being an idiot ? 
  it makes no sense to not call it by its official name though , it 's not a greek city anymore , no longer has a greek name and that `` mispronunciation '' thing is just a myth . 
  but he really is a kuwaiti arab named mohammed fadel dobbous, 
  why are you looking for women ? 
  using constantinople is retarded in any case , it was n't the original name of the city either , if you wanted to use the original name you 'd use lygos . 
  [ i know ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3htw0s/why_tourists_are_still_flocking_to_greece_and/cuaoqrh?context=3 ), 
  nope , i definitely would like to go visit though !, 
  of course . 
  my vacation to greece really just felt the same as being in turkey really , many people were even speaking turkish with me even . 
  they were trying to make a statement against china , it was the ultra nationalists who did it and it was a hate crime , there were only 2 instances were n't there ? 
  a bunch of koreans ( who turks adore ) and an uyghur man who had opened a chinese restaurant which was very ironic . 
  do n't make this sound like a common occurrence though , it really is n't . 
  our laz minority are a bit religious nut heads i 'll say that much , however i can not believe that they would touch or harm your grandmother of all people , those people are extremely respectful of elderly ... 
  northern turkey ? 
  like rize , giresun , trabzon or something ? 
  sounds more like you just had an experience that rubbed you the wrong way . 
  from your whole trip in turkey is this really what stayed with you ? 
  people in a market trying to sell you things ? 
  i do n't see why you would go to a market place with a bazaar culture when you do n't want to partake in it anyway . 
  people are just uncomfortable with the looking i guess . 
  i do n't really have a problem with it , i do n't care really , i think people really exaggerate it due to being in a foreign and muslim country . 
  well you 're from sweden , there 's a big concept of [ personal space ] ( http://i.imgur.com/g2dqgr5.jpg ) that does n't really apply in the southern sunny parts of europe . 
  i have never ever seen or experienced anyone following me or tugging my shirt in my entire life . 
  when you say scam , what do you mean ? 
  well what do you expect when you walk through markets filled with sales people ? 
  you do n't have to buy anything either . 
  why does it bother you so much when you can just walk right past people ? 
  well what do you expect when you walk through markets filled with sales people ? 
  you do n't have to buy anything either . 
  why does it bother you so much when you can just walk right past people ? 
  turkish people just like to look at people , we look at anyone really but some people perceive this as a look of disgust and hostility for some reason . 
  sometimes i see those pissed off looking people and ask for help about something and their look changes entirely to a cheerful friendly one ... 
  i find what you said about turkey to be extremely hard to believe , where were your grandparents ? 
  what the hell did they do ? 
  avatar ? 
  you mean flair ? 
  it 's strange how you 've been a redditor for 2 years but you call it by the wrong thing . 
  are flairs new ? 
  also i 'm with / u/theomnisicient , he 's right , unless you can give other more credible sources . 
  this article is a joke , i ca n't believe anyone 's upvoted it at all . 
  israel is only painted as a pseudo enemy to get votes of muslims , the relations with israel and turkey in terms of trade and iirc military is better than ever now . 
  money made through trade had quadrupled by last year , it must be even more now . 
  / u/barismancoismydad i like your dad 's music man . 
  turkish is an agglutinative language so words can go on quite long . 
  which means , `` are you one of those which we could not make into a czechoslovakian ? '', 
  and muvaffakiyetsizle\u015ftiricile\u015ftiriveremeyebileceklerimizdenmi\u015fsinizcesine as if you would be from those we can not easily/quickly make a maker of unsuccessful ones [ here 's how it looks as it expands and the meaning changes ] ( http://imgur.com/jwgu73u ) also the language is very phonetic so when words that are symmetric are said backwards they sound ** exactly ** the same . 
  an example coming to my head now is `` anastas mum satsana '' try saying that into a voice recorder and playing it backwards .
