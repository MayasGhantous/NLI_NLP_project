  in case you do n't believe me , [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbfjblihwja&amp;feature=youtu.be ) is what it looks like when they protest in sweden and [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwclq2u7_w4&amp;feature=youtu.be ) in france, 
  yeah this guy 's a bit fucked up , seems like it 's all ok to him, 
  [ they murdered a ton of teachers . 
  pkk always attacks without warning, 
  lol no also what 's that got to do with civilians ? 
  there was shelling towards ypg but i 'm not sure ypg was actually attacked more than once but regardless we have priorities and what fit those are what come first at the time , isis is not always top priority , we do what we must to avoid civilian casualties through terror attacks . 
  also here , this is in case you do n't know the [ alignment of turkey ] ( http://i.imgur.com/owzfssu.png ), 
  not very . 
  no matter what kind of offensive you pull though there may always be unwanted civilian casualties though which is called collateral damage . 
   source that they bombed a school with children in class ? 
  [ this news ] ( http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/pkkli-teroristler-idilde-ogrenciler-bulundugu-sirada-8-okul-ve-1-yurda-saldirdi-40040442?mfbclwsbjsklnahf ) talks about how pkk attacked 8 schools and 1 dorm where there were in fact students [ this ] ( http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/diyarbakirda-pkkli-teroristler-karne-dagitiminda-okula-saldirdi-40043695 ) is pkk throwing a bomb into a crowd of students who went to get their report cards before you say anything these are n't erdogan 's papers . 
  also in case you want to see [ here 's a really big list ] ( http://www.meb.gov.tr/belirligunler/sehitogretmenler/ ) of teachers who were murdered by the pkk . 
  there 's a lot more shit too . 
  edit : i forgot to add the details that there were in fact students at those 8 schools and 1 dorm, 
  - insert standard comment about actually bombing civilian kurds - i hope we kill a lot of these isis cunts, 
  we 've been having this issue of false news and tweets regarded as news issue since at least the kobane incident when we were trying to stay out of conflict . 
  all ypg has to do is denounce pkk and we can be friends, 
  i know how you feel man . 
  i 'm talking about [ this thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4bwnaw/jordans_king_accuses_turkey_of_sending_terrorists/ ), 
  is this a joke ? 
  was n't this accepted as being bogus news yesterday ? 
  all of them , every single one now we have enough life time supplies of kurdish blood to bathe in for all eternity of the newly rising neo-ottoman empire . 
  is this what you want to hear ? 
  i ca n't believe he gets away with cheating the votes ... 
  same way i spend every day -- by trying to take over the [ world . 
  ] ( https://i.imgur.com/yooq8xb.png ) happy easter everyone , have a good one , 
  lol ... 
  that 's cause you have very narrow views and are n't thinking of the long term and idealising . 
  if you play your cards right you can greatly benefit from this . 
  what are you on about ? 
  correcting facts is n't defending anyone either . 
  personally i love banter but really it 's not very often we get light hearted jokes though , it 's almost always its vicious hate . 
  i 'm not an akp fanboy i hate erdogan but misinformation , lies , clickbait etc are things i 'm not just going to tolerate either , we want people to be correctly informed before shitting on us . 
  yes us because people are shitting on ** us ** rather than only erdogan etc. 
  [ yes he is very famous . 
  very like . 
  thank you greece for athillas ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lwdk9r7.png ), 
  actually atilla sang that song in greece which is why we got to throw the heat off of us and put it as a greek singer then it just became a meme to say that cringe stuff was greek rather than ours . 
  congratulations on your independence komshi , enjoy it !, 
  a lot has changed now , were we ever such a multicultural society protecting each others values so vehemently before ? 
  exactly , it 's mind boggling . 
  that 's the same link ahahaha, 
  [ you should read this then ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lnaablb.png ), 
  you say you 're pointing it out but i 'm not aware of what you 're talking about, 
  without context numbers changing does n't necessarily mean anything that bad . 
  that 's not how it is in turkey, 
  pretty much what i meant except you make it sound much more scary , you do n't do it in a way where you 're practically forcing a different religion on them , it 's got ta be more subtle and behind the curtains etc. 
  thank you i appreciate that, 
  but do n't they already exist because of corruption ? 
  either way i hope at least this results in some sort of a crack down . 
  i do n't know what china does but this one was n't malicious or harsh or anything people were n't tortured and forced it was just to keep the status quo and make sure wahabist influence did n't come and destabilise the country . 
  we 're very different from each other, 
  nie , not at the moment , i knew more in more detail but i forgot over the years but just happened to remember this one cause it was at the bottom of my book marks i used to keep ages ago . 
  sorry man . 
  it 's obvious they support it though cuz they put them in charge in saudi arabia and left all merrily . 
  yeah man we do n't like it . 
  we 've hated it since the birth of its existence where the ottomans sent forces to destroy wahabists rebellions which was invented by [ the british ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/memoirs_of_mr._hempher,_the_british_spy_to_the_middle_east ) to destabilise the ottomans . 
  also yeah you guys probably do . 
  freedom of religion is good but these guys have their agendas and their plans and it 's not safe ... 
  how so ? 
  i do n't mean anything by this but i 'm curious on what the long run would look like for these guys, 
  nothing 's gon na happen do n't worry . 
  it 's interesting to see a european so concerned for them . 
  in another post i said this  if you replace it with your guys you can make sure these guys are brainwashed into patriots instead of brainwashed into extremism . 
  that was the point of the religious system in turkey so people in the country would n't convert to wahabism/salafism etc keeping stability and ensuring secular values rather than wanting sharia,

  does n't look like it, 
  you 're so sweet , 
  no i mean like the way we do it in turkey to thwart wahabist influence, 
  brainwash is the wrong word for it . 
   i do not think using turkey as an example of a working process is advisable either , unless you are been sarcastic . 
  the extent of turkeys governmental excess and violence with the peoples vote is beyond despotism . 
  why ? 
  why not ? 
  it would be wholly beneficial for the future too . 
  people do n't seem to realise that there are n't just 2 sides and not everyone has the same agenda either . 
  isis and ypg are both threats to turkey but ypg is a first-concern threat because we have been and we are being attacked by them ( pkk ) more and worse than isis who are a secondary problem for the time being ( and hopefully never more of a threat ) . 
  the reason why ypg is considered pkk is because they are closely affiliated and when pkk members cross the border to syria they 're ypg and when they go back they 're pkk , they share the same militants and weapons . 
  weapons given by the west to ypg have been found among the pkk in turkey after raids and shoot outs with the pkk . 
  this perception is not only erdogan btw , it 's all of us who realise this . 
  if you replace it with your guys you can make sure these guys are brainwashed into patriots instead of brainwashed into extremism . 
  that was the point of the religious system in turkey so people in the country would n't convert to wahabism/salafism etc keeping stability and ensuring secular values rather than wanting sharia, 
  why not just replace management with people who is on your side ? 
  that 's what i 'm saying . 
  no matter what we do and what we have been doing we have been in very bad light for the past 1 and a half years . 
  i do n't understand what people want us to do because no matter what it is it 's wrong and we 're bad . 
  no problem , friend . 
  people are angry about how countries do n't retaliate to terror attacks but when we do it everyone talks shit to us , i do n't get people want , it seems they want us to be like them and take it . 
  they 're often suicide bombers too do n't forget that . 
  muslims have always viewed turkey as a westernised country an they call turkey non-islamic and that we are all sinning bastards etc. 
  europeans of course think we 're very islamic etc so lol . 
  but this attack was n't an isis attack it was pkk . 
  question , would terrorism improve their business in the long run or would it do the opposite ? 
  how about that ending, 
  i 'm starting to think of the belgian police as the banana guards now ... 
  hey they might pull this shit on us but human life is still human life and the people affected do n't deserve it but belgium should definitely quit protecting pkk members . 
  escaped how ? 
   arab islamic republic countries that were formerly under turkish rule sometimes use the symbol honouring the ottomans though and also noi i do n't know much about but are n't they kinda weird and [ believe in strange things ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yakub_%28nation_of_islam%29 ) also this is what their flag is described as  the flag of the nation of islam has the symbols of the sun , moon , and the stars .
