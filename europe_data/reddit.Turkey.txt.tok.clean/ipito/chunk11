  it represents the universe . 
  it is also a banner of universal peace and harmony . 
  it 's not used as an islamic symbol . 
  it seems the people thinking crescent and star are islamic think that way cause turks embellished the moon and star symbols on things to show their might or whatever like on mosques, 
  thsts right symbolism is n't allowed in islam, 
  what ? 
  it is not at all the symbol of islam though , people assume it is but it 's an ancient turkic symbol and countries that were under previous turkic rule were the ones using it . 
  if it were an islamic symbol the most islamic countries would have it on their flags then like saudi arabia , afghanistan and iran but they do n't have the symbol do they ? 
  islam has no symbol because symbolism is banned in islam, 
  what do you mean ? 
  the crescent and star is n't an islamic symbol . 
  wow that 's really sweet , i never thought anyone would consider us i mean i did n't expect to see it but now that i do i really do appreciate it ... 
  was this serious ? 
  or was this a joke ?

  om nom nom nom thank you i ate that video right up !, 
  now to be serious , did you watch your own video ? 
  do you not see that cut between walking and being shot ? 
  the shooting is at a completely different time . 
  i ca n't believe people are still eating up this very obvious editing . 
  pkk members are n't civilians . 
  we 're way more used to the pkk doing terror attacks so we assume it 's probably them from the get go but in general people thought it could be isis cause they attacked a group of tourists like last time . 
  comparing to the pkk , isis have barely attacked us so we 're naturally more concerned with the pkk . 
  i 'm aware of the shameful almanci people in germany , netherlands and belgium . 
  i 've hardly met them myself , i see religious people that hate him too and say he 's using religion and how they find it offensive lol, 
  according to multiple statistics turks overwhelmingly prefer a secular government . 
  we have a very conservative party ruling the country true but they 're not islamists wanting to turn the country into a sharia state . 
  why are you guys so obsessed with isis ? 
  pkk is what 's really not only threatening us but is murdering our countrymen on the clock . 
  as bad as isis is they 're not on our minds over pkk, 
  nowhere near that many . 
  the ceasefire was cancelled by the pkk and then they killed some police officers and then all this began again . 
  if you do n't have time just do as i do and point to your watch and apologise . 
  by the way the word is greet , salute is what you do in the military ... 
  i 've never in my life have seen a tourist who has n't at least said `` excuse me '' so what you say sounds a bit off to me ... 
  no one really bothers learning turkish when visiting turkey but we still like to help people out when they try to ask us something even if we do n't understand their language . 
  i see no reason to not help people , i 've been approached that way countless times but i just help people anyway, 
  if you read my post you can see i eat pork . 
  yes i eat bacon but i do n't understand the rabid anti-muslim sentiment it seems to bring out of people . 
  besides , lamb is superior to pork, 
  i do n't understand the obsession about eating pork . 
  i eat it but why the fuck does it matter ? 
  it 's always brought up for some reason as if it 's a big issue . 
  it 's not that , we already have enough reasons to hate erdogan and everything about him but twisting things he says out of context is just unnecessary . 
  listening to the speech where he talks about how women are more important and should have higher values and more understanding towards women etc. 
  the way the headline is written makes you think he says women are beneath men . 
  he says afterwards that unlike in communist regimes women should n't be forced to work with a pickaxe and shovel because it 's not right for their build . 
  it 's really taken severely out of context imo . 
  i do n't like the guy but they all seem to be victims of misunderstanding . 
  yeah but i do n't get the scooter and the correlation to puking ... 
  if this really were the case though then the japanese would n't have this syndrome though . 
  i do n't get it, 
  you sound so delusional , we 've been taking syrians in for years dude , the syrians are travelling with boats like now , we did n't know this would happen and i guess erdogan is trying to make the most of it . 
   other puppies w-what ? 
  the mod of poland has a face of a war hardened veteran dwarf, 
  actually we only signed agreements for taking in people from the council of europe , we 're only taking in syrians for humanitarian reasons . 
  we were n't talking about kardak, 
  well it gives us more control over the aegean which you have too much control over . 
  they were meant to be returned to turkey though . 
  that was the agreement . 
  those are insignificant islands that gives huge amounts of territory , it 's understandable that we want them . 
  how much did the soviets give us ? 
  you do n't understand the point . 
  a claim to a literal rock of an island gives a ton of territory . 
  this is a really dumb statement . 
  yes we got a lot of support and it just made things easier but we would have still won the land we have today . 
  it was won by our own might . 
  turkey and europe, 
  what 's so different with the culture ? 
  it does n't really sound believable, 
  are you joking ? 
  did n't you learn from your parents or school ? 
  for any other country people would be happy that a `` newspaper organisation '' ( cult ) that promoted islamification of a country and wanted the country to follow islamic law etc was closed down but when it comes to turkey it 's seen as bad ... ok ... 
  it was obvious it was a joke , the problem is he 's on the defensive , pay him no mind, 
  forgive him , we 've been getting harassed quite a bit so a lot of ours are on the defensive . 
  it was a good joke , i got it do n't worry . 
  it was only really naive goodwill until they realised after a while how scared/bitchy/whiny everyone was and realised they could also use the situation for gain even if they 're just bluffing about it . 
  this one is actually one to be happy about i guess , read some of the other posts here like [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/48zxte/turkeys_largest_newspaper_just_got_taken_over_by/d0o3hgo ) to understand better . 
  not to mention that 's also with all the heavy amounts of cheating . 
  that 's not true , they have n't faced discrimination since 1923 , why would you think that ? 
  we had a problem cause of a leader we had like erdogan back in the 50s ( who we hung btw ) who caused a false flag that lead to pogroms or else the greek minority were n't discriminated . 
  `` go back home in turkey '' this statement does n't even make sense , not all turks are/were from turkey you know right ? 
  them and their ancestors might have never been in anatolia at all . 
  it 's not about special treatment either , you 're refusing the recognise their own identity which is totally ridiculous . 
  why is it unimportant ? 
  yeah they 're living in greece sure they 're greeks but they 're a turkish minority . 
  in turkey we recognise greek minority . 
  there is a minority of turks there , not all muslims in greece are turks but the majority are . 
  there is a turkish minority though , what makes you say they are n't a turkish minority ? 
   turks of western thrace ( turkish : bat\u0131 trakya t\u00fcrkleri , greek : \u03a4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c1\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u0394\u03c5\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u0398\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2 ) are ethnic turks who live in western thrace , in the province of east macedonia and thrace in northern greece . 
   according to the greek census of 1991 , there were approximately 50,000 turks in western thrace , out of the approximately 98,000 strong muslim minority of greece . 
  [ 1 ] other sources estimate the size of the turkish community between 120,000 and 130,000 . 
  [ 2 ] [ 3 ] the turks of western thrace are not to be confused with pomaks nor with muslim roma people of the same region , counting 35 % and 15 % of the muslim minority respectively . 
  [ 4 ] [ 5 ]  the greek government has adopted a policy of not referring to the turkish community specifically , and instead refers to the entire muslim minority which includes pomaks and roma muslims , and does not recognize a separate turkish minority in western thrace , [ 2 ] instead referring to the whole muslim minority as `` greek muslims '' . 
  the fundamental rights of the turks of east macedonia and thrace are enshrined in the greek constitution and the treaty of lausanne with turkey , which states greece 's obligations to its muslim minority . 
  that seems enough a reason for some people to hate us lol, 
  what did we do ? 
  i 'm just laughing about how bitter he must be,
