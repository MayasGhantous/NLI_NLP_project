  you are severely downplaying turkey 's role in all this for some reason . 
  you do n't understand how big of a toll this is on the turkish economy either . 
  also you dodged my question to you about how you 'd feel if you had 10 % of your population suddenly becoming syrians . 
       that 's a strawman . 
  they were n't stopped because of the knives , they were stopped because they were breaking a legal blockade . 
  the discussion was about weapons and their danger and suddenly the discussion of weapons becomes a strawman ? 
  lol ...  it 's obvious that erdogan surrendered on his demands , even though it makes him look very bad in the eyes of his islamist friends . 
  he did n't suddenly start to like israel or the blockade . 
  he feels that turkey really needs this normalization right now . 
  and ? 
   passenger ships , like the mavi marmara , fall in this category of merchant vessels . 
  do you have any other argument ? 
  why does a passenger ship fall under merchant vessel category ? 
  anecdotal helping a few refugees by taking them into your apartments does n't mean shit dude , every country has that but what 's important is what the country is officially doing . 
  kill 9 people who are terrified out of their minds, 
  it 's not a huge burden on an economy like germany though is it ? 
  this is costing turkey many billions of dollars and it 's a huge percentage to turkey 's gdp . 
  the pictures are not misleading , turkey 's refugee camps are praised , see [ here ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/magazine/how-to-build-a-perfect-refugee-camp.html?_r=0_ ), 
  what the fuck dude ? 
  8 million is huge for turkey , you realise turkey also took in people during the civil war too right ? 
  also what 's with this moral high ground deal you 're talking about ? 
  we 've been taking in 3 million + refugees and taking damn good care of them costing us billions jeopardising our economy . 
  we 're not in that good of a condition to take care of so many people so well . 
  just look at [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/us06uud.jpg ) also . 
  how would you feel if you took in syrians and iraqis that make up 10 % of country ? 
   knives and iron bars can be vicious and deadly . 
  did you honestly think they were taking those to gaza to help kill israelis with ? 
  it 's just a bunch of fucking knives and sticks , it 's really pushing it to say that these people were really dangerous cause of a bunch of these knives when the others carry fuckin guns . 
   remeber when erdogan said that lifting the blockade of gaza is a precondition to normalization ? 
  well , he no longer talks about the blockade . 
   merchant vessels was n't a merchant vessel was it ? 
   knives and iron bars . 
  you make it sound so vicious and dangerous against guns . 
   throw the turks a bone so that the $ $ can start flowing in with restored diplomatic ties along with trade . 
  i see you 're not aware about the fact that trade has more than quadrupled after the flotilla incident . 
   show me where israel acted outside the law in boarding the ship ? 
  was it legal to board the ship in international waters ? 
  i 'm not stating what i believe i 'm stating why the island was occupied and their reasoning . 
   if it were solely for the reasons turkey was claiming , then half the island would n't still be occupied 40 years later . 
  actually that reason is why the country is still occupied 41 years later . 
  you know very well why cyprus was invaded . 
  greece would n't have been invaded if it was n't a part of nato because greece did leave nato but still was n't invaded . 
   it 's greek airspace . 
  it 's the air above recognised greek territory , therefore it 's greek airspace . 
  read about the aegean dispute . 
   greek genocide ring a bell ? 
  learn your history . 
  1 . no it does n't because no such thing also 2 . you said it in present tense as in it like it 's something ongoing, 
  `` europeans would still be swinging from tree to tree like monkeys without us '' always gets me . 
  everyone was trying to scam me in greece too but everyone treated me ok except the history lecture i got from everyone about how you guys invented everything . 
  you guys really like talking about how europeans would be nothing without you :p, 
   proven to be a fake post the proof, 
   i would n't want to work with people who violate my airspace disputed airspace , greeks also violate turkish airspace . 
   treat my people like shit either . 
  we treat greeks like shit ? 
  ahahaha at least you 're getting back the karma you lost unfairly for your previous posts . 
  how do you know this ? 
  i do n't think people realised you were being sarcastic :d, 
  say what you like , our banter game is strong . 
  they hinder any sort of development in the south east which would greatly benefit the people living there so much . 
  they burn down/destroy schools/hospitals/building equipment and kill/kidnap teachers/doctors/engineers . 
   they were out there taking out the islamist terrorists not true , they were attacking anti-assad rebels , particularly the turkmen . 
  the nearest isis controlled space was 110 km away from where the plane was circling and getting shot down . 
   turkey on the other hand is helping these islamist terrorists are you really buying hearsay and russian propaganda that did n't even make sense to someone with basic geographical knowledge of the area and the factions in those areas ? 
   they know very well it 's syria and the turks constantly violate syrian airspace and land to attack kurds , including greece , cyprus and armenia airspaces . 
  it was made abundantly clear that planes crossing the syrian border would be shot down after the turkish jet was shot down in 2012 . 
  as for greece it 's more complicated , there 's a whole dispute about it , turkey does n't recognise greece 's claimed airspace , turkey operates in previously agreed airspace and has not signed anything agreeing to other airspace terms . 
  got a link for that ? 
  i can only find [ one ] ( http://www.sott.net/article/303720-tit-for-tat-turkish-military-aircraft-wander-into-armenian-airspace ) story for that so it does n't seem like a common occurrence at all either . 
  i swear the mental gymnastics people go through here to bend over everything into turkey supporting isis is crazy . 
  what was the post ? 
  are you kidding ? 
  we 've been laughing at russia and its petty tantrums . 
  land lost in the ottoman is no real biggie but land won with ataturk is land we refuse give up . 
  besides turks have been living in those lands for a thousand years now , we 're pretty much natives of the land . 
  you can look up kurdish radio . 
  [ here 's kurdish tv ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trt_kurd%c3%ae ) and , [ here ] ( http://www.english-online.at/news-articles/education/turkey-allows-schools-to-teach-kurdish-language.htm_ ) and [ here ] ( http://www.todayszaman.com/anasayfa_3-schools-providing-education-in-kurdish-language-open-in-southeast_358827.html ) schools that teach in kurdish . 
  did you even google ? 
  in turkish it 's called the war of salvation , the lands were about to be lost but we reclaimed it . 
   and as you may heart of % 8 of the population supports the actions of isis . 
  it could be that some people support actions of isis as in cause they fight assad and ypg but i honestly do n't know but it makes more sense than religiously supporting them . 
   quran says that you can marry a girl , if she bleeds . 
  does it ? 
  or does a hadith ? 
   kurdish language and culture is not treat as good as it should be . 
  what do you mean ? 
  there are kurdish radio and tv channels , kurdish electives in schools , schools in the southeast that even teach in kurdish . 
  because our grandfathers fought for and gave lives for the land so we refuse to give single inch of land away . 
  leatra put it lightly , they are seriously hardcore . 
  no it has n't . 
  turkey adopted all debts and etc of the ottoman empire and is technically a continuer state rather than one found over another state . 
  in no instance has there been any claim that the alleged genocide was something the ottomans did and therefore the turkish state is not responsible . 
  i think he 's really into the [ rally round the flag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rally_'round_the_flag_effect ) tactic, 
   turkey is n't the ottoman empire when they are confronted by their genocides , that has never been an excuse used about the alleged genocide . 
  erdogan is georgian . 
  what do you call [ this ] ( http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkey-detains-over-2500-isil-members-over-three-years.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=91892&amp;newscatid=509 ) , or [ this ] ( http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkey-puts-travel-ban-on-12500-foreign-fighters.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=80908 ) or [ this ?

  your life must be hell, 
  because i do n't like being dirty , i 'm hygienic . 
  i 've barely seen those toilets except for shitty public places , houses have normal toilets .
