  i 've never heard of these groups lmao must be quite minor . 
  syrian turkmen are not terrorist groups though . 
  do you have proof of the rest of your claims ? 
  syrian turkmen are not terrorists . 
  he 's a pretentious retard ignore him . 
  we 're currently taking care of millions of people and we have been for years now and we have multiple times more than the entirety of europe combined and despite this we are still seen as monsters . 
  does n't seem fair to me when you guys go nuts when you get a few thousand . 
  you know very well that that happened due to people stripping and eating each other out, 
  i actually gave you a very uninterested reply because i thought you did n't want to know . 
  if you do want to know i cna give you a bit more detail of the symbol and who used them and how it ended up where it is today !, 
   turkey is n't politically european , only chp is a european party , hdp is a kurdish party , mhp a party with a central asia and caucasus perspective and akp is a party with the middle east and the muslim world in mind . 
  what does politically european mean to you ? 
   culturally is something hard to define but i consider that a nation like israel is more culturally european . 
  uh how so ? 
   you 're right , when western armenia was owned by armenians it would have been considered europe , but then the genocide happened.the fact is that now it 's controlled by a non european nation . 
  but we are a european nation , in any case they 're even less european than us . 
  it is n't an islamic symbol , the crescent and the star are very old turkic symbols used for millennias, 
  i think it 's more to do with the fact that we put the crescent and star on everything to show ownership of the turks and people just started to assume it was a religious symbol , i 've always found this very bothersome personally ... 
  obviously , but it 's shocking and weird how we have such an image to foreigners , we are just left baffled , why on earth do people think the stuff even listed in op 's post , we just do n't get it . 
   sand boys we do n't have any sand besides at our nice and warm beaches . 
   you are n't geographically european , neither culturally nor politically , that 's not true . 
  turkey is politically and culturally european , as for geographically there would be no question if it was european lands if it was owned by lets say greeks . 
  turkey 's also in the council of europe, 
  same with the turkish population . 
  why do bulgarians smoke so much ? 
  we are our own people ... 
  we really do n't it 's just a few some people bought to make money from tourists, 
  nothing big , just settled in somewhere real nice by the sea side . 
  the old owners were a bit rowdy but we pacified them pretty quickly . 
  hey that 's similar to mine !, 
  mine is 1453, 
   i 'd rather be irrelevant than ** apart ** of turkey . 
  we 'll come back and take your lands again soon buddy , do n't worry . 
   i do n't understand this . 
  brother i know the feeling, 
  well we do n't have camels but people come to turkey and want to see camels so in touristic places you 'll see 1-2 camels in the whole town because these people buy these to make bank from tourists who visit . 
  in turkish now deve guresi ( camel wrestling ) means two people on each others shoulders trying to push two other people on each other 's shoulders off lol :d, 
  no no i was n't mad but there really is a strangely distorted view of our country , i do n't think we have any proper soft power to project ourselves in a proper light and everyone goes by assumptions through proximity ... 
  thank you for your kind words though i appreciate it , 
  what the fuck kind of image do you guys have of us ? 
  have you been to turkey ? 
  putin and erdo\u011fan are similar but i 'm sure you hate erdo\u011fan for the same reasons you love putin right ? 
  they 're both toxic and cancer and need to be removed . 
  i do n't get why they think foreigners work by a hive mind . 
  you said it so you 're muslim now . 
  oh it 's great when created with the right method with the right cup and the right leaves . 
  be sure it 's not a knock off . 
  we like it strong . 
  we call it rabbits blood . 
  having real tea must have shocked you . 
  in case you did n't know you guys call it that cause of the cyprus issue just like how americans started calling french fries freedom fries when they got mad at the frenchies . 
  it 's as strong as we want it because we 're not using tea bags , instead we have a [ kettle ] ( http://www.turkishcookbook.com/images/prep/turkcayi_prep_1.jpg ) with the top part filled with tea leaves and water and the bottom with just water and the top part heats up with the steam of the bottom one and then you pour into a cup and adjust how strong you want it . 
  lol , but really it 's as strong as we want it because we 're not using tea bags , instead we have a [ kettle ] ( http://www.turkishcookbook.com/images/prep/turkcayi_prep_1.jpg ) with the top part filled with tea leaves and water and the bottom with just water and the top part heats up with the steam of the bottom one and then you pour into a cup and adjust how strong you want it . 
  we mainly have uht milk . 
  that 's cause you guys are n't drinking uht milk . 
  that shit is gross . 
  why am i a turkish nationalist ? 
  this has nothing to do with nationalism , you made a cringe worthy nonsensical post . 
  they were doing that to us too but you do n't see us bitching and moaning about it , we have our burdens and we have to take care of these unfortunate people . 
  obviously there 's going to be shitty ones among them but to disregard them as a whole is inhumane and such a horrible thing . 
  what makes them more trustworthy than turkey ? 
  we 've been using billions of dollars on refugees already and we need the extra support . 
  people treat these human lives as if they 're nothing and i find that really shocking , what 's wrong with people ? 
  damn , i did n't know greek girls had such stone cold hearts . 
  nice sense of humanity you have there . 
  i 'm ok with the churches for example being called their proper names i guess as a historical continuation but i believe things should be called what they are in that language than your own , the other way around i find odd/unnecessary and frankly stupid ... 
  i do n't know enough about kos to explain its name but as you know istan also means the land of , so it might have to do with that . 
  most name changes were really to suit the turkish tongue that 's why . 
  the `` i '' is added to the start because in turkish two consonants ca n't really be side by side and this why the first letter of the `` to the city '' in greek thing does n't make sense . 
  like sparta becomes isparta because people ca n't say sparta ( the other alternative would be siparta ) . 
  you get what i mean ? 
  what language are we speaking ? 
  does that matter ? 
  the official name of the city now is istanbul . 
  istanbul is not constantinople , it is not konstantiniyye , it is not asitane , it is not byzantium , it is not tsargrad . 
  it 's stupid to call it anything but what its name is . 
  constantinople was a really tiny speck in comparison to what istanbul is now , it ca n't even really be compared . 
  i like to call the city by the name they had during its period . 
  constantinople pre-ottomans , konstantiniyye post-ottomans , istanbul post 1923 . 
  we do n't like that either , we call it by what it was and we call the land anatolia . 
  it 's okay when it says `` now modern day turkey '' or something that 's fine . 
   istanbul is a greek phrase , just turcified . 
  this is a myth , it 's stupidly accepted by people though . 
  that 's stupid though why not call something by its name ? 
  but it ** is ** eastern turkey . 
  this comment is so stupid i ca n't believe anyone would even write such a thing . 
  i do n't think you caught my sarcasm ... 
  i hope we get to give them our refugees and just be done with it already . 
   the turkish army never kills in the single digits . 
  they do though , but you are n't really following anything are you ? 
  muvaffakiyetsizle\u015ftiricile\u015ftiriveremeyebileceklerimizdenmi\u015fsinizcesine ** translation : **  `` as though you happen to have been from among those whom we will not be able to easily/quickly make a maker of unsuccessful ones '' obviously it 's a word we use all the time , it 's so common . 
  yep . 
  it does n't . 
  fuck you wrote a lot . 
   when you have a confrontation with somebody and he somehow `` loses '' , your chances are pretty good that some minutes later the rest of the male family members will come for you , no matter if you were in the right . 
  what ? 
  are you saying they bring a gang of their friend to fight ? 
  that does n't happen in turkey , if a fight breaks out it 's a one on one and even so i 've rarely ever seen a fight , just the 1-2 a school year . 
  i 've never seen a gang up fight in my life but it does n't seem like much to complain about . 
   or this obsession about the `` honour '' of mothers .
