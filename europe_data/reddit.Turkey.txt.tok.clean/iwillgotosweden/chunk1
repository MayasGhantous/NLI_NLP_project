oh , we are similar then . 
  i think every country in mediterranean is relevant to europe . 
  6th guy looks like a crusader kings portrait . 
  same in turkey and greece . 
  i am not sure . 
  is kreuzberg , berlin ghetto ? 
  the deaths in the area are very complicated , ant since tv 's and newspapers does not tell anything , it is hard to find sources . 
  there are 3 sides : kurds and turks who support kurdish resistence against isis ( also terrorist group pkk is on that side ) , kurdish islamist who are pro-isis and the turkish state . 
  pkk supporters killed an islamist man by beating ( islamist sources ) : https://twitter.com/hurekipasayis/status/519586520211021825 kurdish man killed by islamists : https://twitter.com/hurekipasayis/status/519587412385624065 many others killed by turkish police by shooting at the prosters . 
  i have been to europe many times , and i do n't agree with ` europe is extremely racist ' statement . 
  maybe it is the amount of hate i see in my country , but still , it is an exaggeration . 
  no cyprus ? 
  turkey would be uk/russsia/france / greece if it was included . 
  well , anatolian culture has n't changed much in last 1000 years . 
  only language and religion . 
  have n't been in so many european countries ( mostly been around baltic sea ) but , i can say budapest-hungary . 
  old grand buildings from glorious times , meaty soups and salamis , people with very mixed genetics , people on the street who want to trick tourists , lots of beggars , ottoman tombs and hamams . . yep sounds like istanbul . 
  everybody is `` temel '' there . 
   the people of the eastern black sea region are also known for their  wit and sense of humour ; in fact many jokes in turkey are told about  the natives of the black sea region karadeniz f\u0131kralar\u0131 ( black sea  jokes ) . 
  the character temel , a universal buffon figure found in many  cultures , forms an important part of the turkish oral tradition . 
  i think there is also a general distaste for turkey governments in northern cyprus . 
  2004 european cup , the picture of charisteas scoring the header would look very cool :p, 
  dude . . 
  it 's the olive oil . 
  alevis are under shia sect of islam and they have been massacred by sunni ottomans/turks/kurds periodically in anatolia since 16th century . 
  ottoman sultan selim i massacred thousands of alevis , and erdogan praises selim a lot in his speeches and actions ( wants to give the name `` yavuz sultan selim '' to the 3rd bridge of istanbul ) , and as a reaction to the islamist sunnis , alevis living in the cities have a high tendency to become secularists or atheists . 
  1 - football ( it 's huge , people kill each other for that shit ) 2 - basketball ( became more popular after 90 's ) 3 - volleyball ( women 's seem to be more popular ), 
  at least 40 % of the country would cheer if he dies painfully . 
  if this guy would have seen walking alone anywhere in western ( thracian , aegean , mediterranean ) or alevi ( dersim , alevi vilages in anatolia ) areas in turkey he would be killed violently by the mob of ` ordinary ' people . 
  that 's why he walks with an army of bodyguards . 
  i heard he is a relative of varg vikernes ' family . 
  anti-islam middle asia descendant turk . 
  ( i 'd go pagan too , if i would believe in magic ), 
  because everyone you talked with can speak a foreign language . 
  actually it is the opposite . 
   undemocratic ( counting the journalists in prison ) yes , very much  islamic state not there yet . 
  not while we are still living in this country . 
  although things are very undemocratic , there is nothing on the constitution that makes turkey an islamic state . 
  many people are islamic , people from the government are islamic but the state is not . 
  turkey would be the largest but not would be the most powerful country in eu . 
  there is germany , france and g.britain . 
  european countries really should have some anti-islamic laws , like we used to have . 
  i think chp is secular nationalist , and mhp is muslim nationalist . 
  people in izmir are liberal in their lifestyles , not in their political views . 
  most people are very nationalist . 
  chp is the most popular secular option , but this time they tried to get some `` conservative '' votes with dickmeleddin . 
  ihsanoglu is just an islamist without `` corruption '' . 
  for me , being him corruption-free does not change anything . 
  i would never vote for such a person . 
  instead i voted for kurdish party , even though i am coming from a very turkish background , and have very less sympathy to their movements . 
  i just voted for them because there was two islamist guys and a kurdish ( zaza ) guy who tells he wants to close the religious institution ( diyanet ) which got more than 2 billion dollars budget from the state for 2014 . 
  edit : spelling . 
  it was good against islamists but it was very bad for kurds . 
  because all the generals in army were also very very nationalist . 
  i think r/europe has a tendency to call `` kebab '' everyone under 40th latitude . 
  a good way to destroy lives . 
  lol, 
  no i do n't know . 
  please tell me . 
  why ? 
  what should i call it ? 
  east thrachia is not in europistan ? 
  dat feeling when turkey is not included :(, 
  i do n't know for jews , but here it became more of a cultural thing . 
  even being very secular , a turkish woman might want her partner to get circumcised , just because she thinks circumcision is the `` natural way '' or other one is gross . 
  it is same with eating pork , many people drinks alcohol but nearly none of them eat pork , because it 's `` unhealty '' and `` not clean '' . 
  why do we need them to teach religion at school ? 
  should n't it be family 's responsibility ? 
  see , what kind of idiots we deal with in this country ? 
  i always thought that macarena was from south america . 
  if you are refering to greeks and armenians in anatolia . 
  they were not immigrants , they were original inhabitants of anatolia . 
  yeah , they all seemed fantastic but plane was 2.5 times cheaper . 
  fly to berlin from istanbul , fly to copenhagen from berlin , go to malm\u00f6 from copenhagen ( with bus i suppose ) , go to stockholm from malm\u00f6 with train , then fly back to istanbul . 
  just to give some info : sunni is classical islam , like they have in egypt or palestine ( although there is a lot of turkish pov ) . 
  alevi is a weird mixture of shia and old turkic paganism . 
  `` lulz '', 
  to steal honest european people 's jobs . 
  jokes aside , i really like northern european cultures and nature . 
  we were in helsinki and tallinn in october and it was really good . 
  nice people , nice weather ( i like cold weather ) . 
  this time we will follow the berlin-kopenhagen-stockholm route . 
  any recommendations ? 
  will be this summer, 
  yeah , it 's probably in our genes . 
  here in turkey we call our fat bellies `` turkish muscle '', 
  this is almost a fact , and the fact here is hateful , not his speech . 
  never !, 
  we will rename it to miklag\u00e5rd instead . 
  if there are muslims somewhere ; even by the smallest power they have , they will try to make their way and try to force other people to it .

  edit : i was looking for an event and immediately found this : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/sweden/7712700/swedish-mohammed-cartoonist-attacked-during-free-speech-lecture.html, 
  i bet it 's muslims, 
  i really lost my all hope about the votes in last election . 
  akp only does it to save their screwed up reputation in international politics . 
  akp has the smilar ideologies with genociders : clearing non-muslims from turkey . 
  edit : reputation `` in international politics '', 
  whenever this subject comes up i feel very sad and very furious . 
  i am very sad for what happened ( also to anatolian greeks and assyrians ) and get even more sad when i imagine how much culture we 'd have if did n't lose these people . 
  i feel very furious because , i feel very guilty about something i did n't do and would never do .
