  and if the ruler had multiple names i chose the first one . 
  i used http://www.behindthename.com/ to find origins of the names . 
  if the name had uncertain roots i chose the oldest known origin . 
  i used a map making [ website ] ( http://mapchart.net/ ) that i found on reddit . 
  are those things really happening ? 
  have been to northern europe many times , and it looked like everybody was civil and nobody dared such things . 
  i have almost never seen islamist types in denmark , sweden , germany , finland or others . 
  is this some sort of trick to keep people heated ? 
  there should be an option for the climate . 
  no way i would live south of turkey ( or even istanbul ) . 
  when i remove warm places i get tallinn though , one of my favorite places . 
  this is actually an idiom in turkish that means : `` oh you realized now ? '', 
  where is he from ? 
  grey wolf groups made those massacres , and they are part of counter-guerilla which is backed by usa . 
  usa involvement in afghanistan ( which is not in middle east , but in middle asia , and a neighboring country to uzbekistan ) and arming extremist groups there , being allies with saudi arabia is creating this mess . 
  10/10 would invade . 
  nice to see a fellow cappadocian here . 
  you can pm me if you ever decide visit nev\u015fehir , and need anything . 
  why should i care ? 
  they always try overcharge domestic tourists . 
  yesterday they banned booking.com in turkey . 
  wtf ? 
  if they want economic suicide i will assist them . 
  and greece is actually cheaper and have better service . 
  lol no , i mean for holidays . 
  even turks started to go to greece . 
  edit : chill guys , i mean as tourists . 
  looks like there are multiple different claims . 
  old turkic word for `` wolf '' is `` b\u00f6r\u00fc '' . 
  i do n't think like that . 
  i understand what you say , because there many people like that on internet . 
  but there is a high possibility that this is real . 
   from the turkic name bogoris , perhaps meaning `` short '' or `` wolf '' or `` snow leopard '' http://www.behindthename.com/name/boris http://www.thinkbabynames.com/meaning/1/boris i could n't find a very credible source . 
  but if you have anything to offer i can read about your claim too . 
  boris is already a ( rooted from ) turkic name . 
  thanks for the sources . 
  i was about to ask for it . 
  this chart is for western europe . 
  no dude , hitler is like the worst guy evar . 
  and `` parola '' means `` password '', 
  if you enjoy cringe . 
  when i went there people pronounced like this : ya-rom-nee-yaer, 
  there are just a handful of people left , who continue ancient traditions . 
  please do n't group us with arabs in a sentence like we are the same people ( `` arab and turk mentality '' , there is no such thing ) . 
  i am so irritated , i ca n't finish reading the sentence . 
  teke ( lycia ) nomads still keep their throat singing culture . 
  it 's right in front of you :p https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ow0nbsf2hq, 
  oh you , and your crazy language / s, 
  also many armenians converted to islam to stay in their lands . 
  ( many were still killed/force migrated even though they have been converted ), 
  that 's right , muslims did it . 
  but the idea was european ( nationalism ) . 
  of course you 'll see better statistics in western parts . 
  but overall stats are bad . 
  lol no one reads it . 
  people learn about religion from their parents/friends ( sometimes from local imams ) . 
  it 's just that we do n't give a shit about political correctness . 
  if someone invests on it . 
   you 're going to have to organize and militarize hang on there obama, 
  thanks , after aferim i have really high hopes for romanian cinema . 
  the first one looks very interesting . 
  i remember the names obili\u00e7 and lazarevi\u00e7 from high school history lessons . 
  5h23m and 4h48m . 
  they should either be epic stories like lord of the rings , or like documentaries . 
   montevideo : taste of a dream a movie about first world cup . 
  i will definitely watch this one . 
  wow did n't think our music were so similar . 
  change the lyrics and this could easily be a north-eastern anatolian song . 
  thanks , these 2 look very interesting . 
  i find it very silly when the western world go crazy with movies like 300 , thinking they are grandchildren of spartans . 
  great visuals though . 
  any point is good . 
  just want to avoid post war , commie vs fascist stuff . 
  as far as i know , both mongolian and turkic word for `` lake '' is `` gol '' / `` g\u00f6l '' . 
  a more recent [ photo ] ( http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/dolandiricilar-vakit-kaybetmedi-inanilmaz-yontem-40340132?utm_source=t.co&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=dolandiricilar-vakit-kaybetmedi-inanilmaz-yontem-40340132&amp;utm_term=post ) of him . 
  when we protested back in 2013 police killed 11 young men . 
  now situation is far worse . 
  [ tfw ] ( http://imgur.com/a/apgir ) he realizes he will be in a turkish prison forever . 
  they are fine . 
  it was not much different than the aegean towns by the sea . 
  island residents does n't seem to like visitors though . 
  man , world was fucked up back then . 
  i guess it 's about keeping the hate refreshed . 
  after asala assasinations , and outlawing the denial of armenian genocide in many countries many people kept on hating . 
  for greece , many people from the west actually love greece . 
  especially younger generation . 
   i do n't get the feeling they hate greeks as much although growing up i thought they did . 
  sorry , did n't understand second sentence . 
  did you mean armenians hate greeks ? 
  sadly , it has historical roots . 
  my grandmother used to call her children `` armenian '' ( i guess meant naughty ) when they did n't behave . 
  i 've always wondered if those traditional outfits were ( or originated from ) greek . 
  cause they are turkic :p, 
  yes, 
  turkic people usually look very similar to whatever ethnicity they live together/adjacent and sometimes with a touch of asian features . 
  we still use that verb as bula ( mak ) . 
  i guess `` g '' is dropped in years . 
  it 's probably they just follow atat\u00fcrk 's words . 
  many might not know what secularism is . 
  yes,
