  anyway , on behalf of my ancestors ( if they were included ) . 
  i am very sorry . 
  also ; not all the people in turkey are internet dumbasses like the ones in this thread . 
  check [ this picture ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ngluuagizna/txgvyhu1mpi/aaaaaaaabie/drzahw6kj6i/s1600/ist-190112-hrant-anma-agos6.jpg ) and [ this ] ( http://birgun.net/icerikler/resimler/haberler/unutmadik-affetmeyecegiz-ahparig-1.jpg ) to see 10.000 s of people are walking for murdered armenian ( turkey citizen ) journalist hrant dink . 
  it 's from istanbul ( 2013 ), 
  lol turkey , more negative to muslims than u.k. 
  i 'm sure it be will grow to a bigger number in next 5-10 years . 
  with the recent political climate i can say that this 24 % does n't only have a negative view on muslims , actually most of them have an intense hate . 
  source : my facebook and twitter feed . 
  celtic people even expanded through central anatolia . 
  the red in turkey and romania would explain it . 
  honor killings are mostly kurdish ` culture ' and does n't happen every week . 
  also there was honor killings in there when it was byzantine land . 
  so not only you were in the same planet , you were sharing a culture . 
  * i used ` you ' for your flair , not exactly for your personality . 
  i think akp supporters as cancer to the body . 
  they should be removed before the whole country becomes a huge ball of cancer . 
  i wish eu had some influence outside of eu . 
  why were you in cizre ? 
  it 's in syria border ( and very close to iraq border ) and potentially a very dangerous place . 
  as a turk i ca n't even imagine myself going there . 
   turkey is being governed by a terrorist sunni-supremacist mafia , and the scary part is that 50 % + of the country is proud of that fact . 
  many turks would agree with this ( including me ), 
  i listened the record today before youtube went down . 
  yes that 's correct . 
  i was in tallinn this october with my wife as a honeymoon . 
  the whether was good ( 12 degrees with lots of sun ) and we saw a lot of mothers with their babies on streets . 
  we thought that estonia has more babies than average of europe . 
  is this true or is it just mothers wandering around in the good weather ? 
  is rodos in europe ? 
  have n't been in so many european cities ( maybe 10 of them ) but budapest was the coolest for me . 
  dat architecture man . 
  istanbul may have been the worlds coolest city if everything was preserved . 
  but nothing is preserved . 
  it 's a complete shit hole , spoiled by illiterate sub-humans . 
  yes we know about genocide ( s ) thank you . 
  but it 's not the main reason of mixed genetics in anatolia . 
  this started many many years ago , even before the byzantines . 
  greeks , turks , armenians , kurds , syrians , georgians , circassians , persians , bulgarians , serbs , bosnians , albanians , russians , mongols , arabs and even celts ( galatians ) lived ( or living ) in anatolia . 
  no , he is not related with it . 
  the names you are looking for are enver pasha and talat pasha . 
  though he was not very clean either : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dersim_massacre, 
  for nationalists and most of the seculars : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/atat%c3%bcrk for islamists : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fatih_sultan_mehmed or http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/selim_i, 
  i did n't know we shared the same currency name with italians . 
  one 's saint is other 's villain , that 's how the life works man :p, 
  exactly . 
  it 's literal meaning is `` the one with spikes '', 
  because you are neutral :p, 
  i do n't remember his name from history classes in high school but he is probably mentioned . 
  because high school history classes in turkey is pretty much ottoman history and every battle ottomans made and most of ` enemy ' leaders ( villains for ottomans ) have a place in the high school history books . 
  tl : dr : he is probably mentioned . 
  most popular ` villains ' i remember are : tamerlane , shah ismail , kazikli voyvoda ( vlad tepes ) , czarina catherine , jan sobieski , andrea doria, 
  when i was in helsinki 2 months ago , i started chat with some people on street . 
  although they did n't have a big smile on their faces , they answered my questions and tried to help me . 
  one incident is that , i was waiting for a shop to open with a young fella . 
  we started chatting , after a while my wife and i suggested that we should wait in a coffee place together instead of the cold street . 
  he accepted it . 
  i think that explains what you say . 
  finland . 
  people do n't touch you . . or get close to you . . or speak yo you . . or look at you . 
  i loved it !, 
  no love for raki ? 
  turkey can into christmas, 
  wow . . this is upvoted in r/europe nice . 
  in turkish , the most common one is : `` m\u00fcd\u00fcr , m\u00fcd\u00fcr m\u00fcd\u00fcr ? '', 
  meaning `` is manager a manager ? '', 
  he did . 
  i was in helsinki in october and it was -1 already . 
  that 's right . 
  freedom does n't mean that you can treat your child whatever you like . 
  i do n't know others but in turkey , there is no imam involved in circumcision . 
  there is two ways to do circumcisiton : you go to a clinic ( that 's what i have went through ) or you go to a guy called `` s\u00fcnnet\u00e7i '' which is the traditional way . 
  but that 's only rural areas afaik . 
  also in turkey it 's a trend now to circumsize a boy in a very early time . 
  because `` modern '' parents are concerned about the pain . 
  so they do it in a time that their little boy would not remember later . 
  the usual time is between ages 6-12 . 
  it was so painful :( but looks better :p, 
  although official pronunciation is `` avro '' in turkey , people pronounce it in different ways . 
  other than `` avro '' , popular ones are `` yuro '' , '' \u00f6ro '' , `` euro '' . 
  you can make fun of everything , just avoid cliche . 
  i think , i will code a bot with natural language processing and make it comment on r/europe . 
  it will find threads with something negative about turkey , and generate comments like these : - and they want to join europe ??? 
  - that 's why turkey is n't in eu - forget about eurub suckers you can thank me later . 
  so many claims that were abandoned . 
  we used to perform metal covers ( ranging from ac/dc to lamb of god ) at a bar every sunday in istanbul . 
  suddenly a dozen of russians entered the place . 
  they have listened to a couple of songs , then they wanted to listen something ` slow ' . 
  there was not too many people so we played a metallica ballad , and russian couples started slow dancing , it was very weird . 
  failed in the 1st question : /, 
  turkey must be purple , press is highly intimidated and there are over 60 arrested journalists . 
  although these maps works with numbers . 
  maybe purple countries are even worse than turkey . 
  i do n't know, 
  `` anahtar '' is originally from greek . 
  this thing is all about opressing kurds . 
  kurdish alphabet use these letters ( turkish does n't ) and this why they hated it . 
  in big cities you can see a lot of shop names ( at least to us ) with these letters , because all the cool kids in the world uses it . 
  but when it comes to kurds it 's blasphemy . 
  so many aspects of islam were inherited from judaism ( circumcision , shariah etc. ),
