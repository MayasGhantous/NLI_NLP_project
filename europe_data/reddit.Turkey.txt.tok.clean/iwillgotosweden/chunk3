  i 've been to netherlands and germany . 
  i loved how all the people minding their own business unlike where i live . 
  society or family does n't suppress people . 
  being a person who likes to keep his distance from other people , i think northern europe is the easiest for me to assimilate to . 
  in turkey they are called \u00e7ingene ( chin-geh-neh ), 
  founder of turkish republic , m.k. 
  atat\u00fcrk 's father 's ~ ~ was born ~ ~ family is from the village kod\u017ead\u017eik , centar \u017dupa municipality , macedonia . 
  probably his fair hair and blue eye comes from there . 
  edit : sorry for misinformation . 
  christian ( orthodox ) turkic people called gagauz live in there and they speak oghuz turkish , that is easy to understand for turks ( in turkey ) and azeris . 
  that 's all i know . 
  ftfy  some faiths are an insult to the 21st century woman . 
  exactly . 
  extreme religious clothings like burka should be banned in secular states . 
  it 's an insult for 21st century woman . 
  i have n't heard any jokes about greeks in my life . 
  if there 's any ethnical turkish jokes , they are generally about eastern black sea people . 
  and sometimes about jewish and bektashi people . 
  it is better now , because we have fjords . 
  some random facts about the armenian genocide : - many times ottoman empire [ used kurds and circassians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hamidian_massacres ) in genocide . 
  - many people just thrown away to black sea ( in trabzon region ) - according to ottoman documents 970.000 armenians `` disappeared '' from population . 
  - the government that was under the sultan [ had always admired germans ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/enver_pasha ) . 
  - it 's claimed that armenian gangs killed 40.000 civilian turks and kurds as revenge ( most nationalists use this as argument against armenian genocide ) sorry for bad writing and lack of good sources . 
  i am in a hurry . 
  i will probably update this when i get home . 
  not all the turks deny it . 
  even though our education system continue to brainwash children by twisted history lessons , there are many many people who overcome bullshit and learned what happened back then and totally do n't see armenian people as their enemies . 
  example : thousands of people walking on the streets of istanbul for the murdered armenian ( turkey citizen ) journalist [ hrant dink ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_q-fxevwlwpk/tttikmdveci/aaaaaaaaepc/ci5qipxkemi/s200/dink_hrant.jpg ) : http://dink.files.wordpress.com/2007/01/3.jpg http://www.nationalturk.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/hrant_dink_yuruyusu_2012-266x400.jpg [ text saying : we are all hrant , we are all armenians ] ( http://www.agos.com.tr/upload/images/1erhan%20arik.jpg ) [ his wife with kurdish mp 's ] ( http://cdncms.zaman.com.tr/2013/01/19/burakakbulutaaa.jpg ) [ his dead body ( nothing gore ) ] ( http://www.ulkedehaber.com/resimler/2/hrant-dink-cinayetinde-basa-mi-donuluyor-11851.jpg ) [ bastard who shot him ] ( http://galeri.uludagsozluk.com/24/kuddusi-okk%c4%b1r-ile-og%c3%bcn-samast-aras%c4%b1ndaki-fark_28714.jpg ), 
  there would be a huge difference if there was a european gmail or facebook . 
  do you mean she is the only one in parlement with this ideology ? 
  are there radical christian people in finland ? 
  i idealize countries like finland , sweden , norway as the best countries on earth . 
  when i heard the typical shit that i hear in my country every time , in finland ( even it 's a politician ) i am disappointed . 
  wow , very disappointing . 
  i had pictured finland very different in my mind . 
  most common and striking one : * orospu \u00e7ocu\u011fu * ( child of a whore ) you can create many others by putting * sikeyim * ( i fuck/will fuck ) in the end : for example : * anan\u0131 sikeyim * ( fuck your mother ) , * s\u00fclaleni sikeyim * ( fuck your extended family ) , in the southern city of adana where bold people live it 's quite common to say * allah ' \u0131n\u0131 sikeyim * ( fuck your allah ) pezevenk : whore 's owner , pimp orospu : whore g\u00f6tveren : ass-giver ( refering to homosexuality ) g\u00f6to\u011flan\u0131 : ass-boy ( same of the above ) yarrak kafal\u0131 : penis head gavur am\u0131 gibi yanmak : burning as a foreigner 's ( gavur originally means infidel ) pussy pi\u00e7 : a person without father am\u0131na koyay\u0131m : i put ( my dick probably ) in your pussy there are tons of it in turkish language that i could n't write ( because i am at work right now ) . 
  so i will end this with a very weird swear combo that i heard from a central anatolian taxi driver last week : * babayin amina koyayim orospu \u00e7ocugu , ya resulallah * simplified : fuck your father in the pussy you son of a whore . 
  the messenger of allah ( last part is probably said as a prayer for the regret of the swear ) edit : i am very poor on formatting, 
  what turkey needs is a revolution . 
  i find it hilarious that most northern europeans think mediterranean people have brown skin . 
  most of the time i considered this is actual white and northern ( or western ) people are just too pale . 
  so many ottoman pashas were albanian . 
  also enver hoxha turned mosques and churches into cow houses . 
  interestingly i did the same thing in my very first game . 
  i felt very irish . 
  also : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/galatia, 
  very enjoyable to play on crusader kings ii also a great band : primordial, 
  by seeing [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t3kokjtpoe ) people ( akp supporters ) i 'm against turkish membership for anywhere . 
  these people - by their idiocracy - will block turkey 's improvement forever . 
  the people whom the prime minister insults are doctors , engineers , lawyers , architects , people with masters degrees . 
  these people are the ones to save this country . 
  they are the `` other 50 % '', 
  i should mention that , in the evening of this festival-like day and while all of these children were there , police flooded this place with tear gas and pepper spray . 
  some of these children lost their parents in the crowd ( parents have been found later ) . 
  one photo i can find : https://twitter.com/nycjim/status/345999985386614784/photo/1/large ( photo by - yannis behrakis - reuters ), 
  also made a cool war with ottomans on indian ocean ( 1538 ) : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ottoman%e2%80%93portuguese_conflicts_%281538%e2%80%9357%29, 
  not the traditional way , but the name and the plant itself . 
  also there is a possibility , that it may has come from persia . 
  it 's not 100 % certain . 
  basically : chinese  portuguese ( or persian )  ottoman, 
  they all come from chinese . 
  portakal ( orange ) and \u00e7ay ( tea ) came from them . 
  people can travel to different countries ? 
  seeing these kind of comments actually hurt , not everything is about getting in the eu . 
  basketball and history !, 
  sometimes people mix with latvia in my language . 
  istanbul is not in europe ? 
  there is no avarage about that . 
  the country is divided into 2 thanks to government . 
  50 % care a lot and hope something will happen , the other 50 % just do n't care . 
  thank you . 
  that 's very informative . 
  ottoman empire exiled political victims there . 
  is it easy to learn croation since you use latin script ? 
  also is it close to russian , can you understand russian ? 
  ( forgive my ignorance ), 
  thank you very much for saying `` muslim majority country '' , not `` muslim country '' or `` islamic country '' . 
  a lot of westerners make this mistake . 
  a george bush situation, 
  short answer : military can not preserve anything anymore . 
  in last 10 years a lot generals taken to jail .

  not yet , 
  i think twitter and facebook are `` banned '' in certain geographic places . 
  i am in istanbul and have no trouble .

  background : - 52 civilians died in hatay connected to governments syria policy - government named 3rd bridge `` yavuz sultan selim '' who massacred alawite people in 16th century . 
  ( alawite people are at least 15 % of turkey ) - government accuses alawite politicians helping `` the devil '' essad - government made strict policies about alchohol consumption now they are trying to build a shopping center in taksim square buy cutting a lot of trees .

  culturally close to finland and a lot of technological innovations . 
  islamist gained more power that 's all . 
  it 's not that people became more islamist . 
  eastern parts will need probably more time . 
  in 20 years , i think there will be great decline in religion including turkey . 
  but most of the muslim immigrants in europe will stay the same . 
  i can see in here many of my friends getting irreligious and despise islam . 
  however my relatives in germany who were not practicing religion before they left turkey , started being religious in germany and france . 
  i am curious about estonia and ireland .
