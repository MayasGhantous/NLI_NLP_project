  i know that i will go there . 
  conservatives do that all the time , they think kissing in public is against `` turkish culture '' . 
  it 's history of ` religion ' really . 
  no , i am irreligious . 
  i might consider , but my priority is europe . 
  it 's worse in where i live , and i do n't think sweden is having a major problem . 
  muslims will always cause problem in secular countries . 
  islamic culture is also highly influenced by ancient greeks too . 
  so ancient greeks are middle eastern ? 
  well , genetically turkish ( from turkey ) people are very different from the people of central asian turkic people . 
  yes , anatolia is conquered by turkic seljuks , but the turkish population dissolved by anatolian population ( i.e. 
  armenian , kurd , greek , other anatolian ) , but language remained turkish . 
  so people in turkey look like classic anatolian people with a little mongolic mixture . 
  this my opinion about ethnicity . 
  about greeks not being european ; i think ancient greeks should not be considered europeans . 
  people say european culture is strongly influenced by ancient greeks . 
  so do islamic culture . 
  there are shit load of greek scripts , first translated to arabic , then from arabic to european languages . 
  i think ancient greeks stand in the middle of that east vs west thing . 
  and by living in anatolian culture i like being in the middle and i find it very interesting  about my nick name : i am an engineer , who is very unhappy where he lives and i will hopefully live in sweden some day . 
  i think many people from europe takes being part of the europe as being christian . 
  culturally armenia is closer to iran and turkey rather than europe . 
  i think , culturally turks , armenians and greeks are not european . 
  we ( including kurds ) have unique common culture here in and around anatolia . 
  it 's very sad that all of these cultures had a lot of bloodshed and crime between them . 
  edit : wow so much downvoting . 
  i do n't care , i will just go for a walk between buildings with domes , maybe i would eat some fasullia or dolma , then as a dessert baklava . 
  then i return home and open my door with my anachtar , and listen to some hayko cepkin . 
  there are a lot of turkic/mongol names : genghis , teoman , tarkan , hulagu , batukhan , bahadir , timur , dilek etc. 
  but this are used in different turkic countries . 
  unique names for turkey are , i think the ones from last 20 years ( they mostly have natural meanings ) : r\u00fczgar ( wind ) , su ( water ) , nehir ( river ) etc. 
  i see a lot of vacant it positions in ireland . 
  how is this possible ? 
  balkans are like a park that some homeless guys live . 
  at least no hitler . 
  i can help you with that : * avc\u0131 - hunter ( this or blacksmith must be the most popular ones ) * demirci - blacksmith * de\u011firmenci - miller * bardak\u00e7\u0131 - glassmaker * ekmek\u00e7i - breadmaker also there are some cool armenian-turkish mixes . 
  armenians have these kind of surnames a lot since they were mostly craftsmans in ottoman . 
  oh . . daily reminder of `` turkey not europe '' . 
  well if they were still tengri , they would have invasion cb . 
  only holy wars right now . 
  being an isis supporter is like the worst thing you can be right now . 
  before that i think it was being a nazi . 
  look how many people from everywhere around the world are neo-nazis . 
  even in the countries that fought with the nazi ( russia , france , usa ) . 
  i am afraid islamism will not be a migrant problem soon . 
  half my family ( cousins , uncles , aunts etc. ), 
  is living in germany . 
  they come to turkey every year , they support turkish football teams , they watch turkish tv , and only 3 out of 30 of them managed to go to university , and many of the old ones are n't even intermediate level in german . 
  there is a problem . 
  but i think it will be solved after 4th or 5th generation . 
  i can see the change in teens of the family . 
  seems similar . 
  thanks . 
  aras is from istanbul . 
  maybe it also affected that . 
  although there is kim kardashian with a half turkish surname . 
  ( if kardash does not have an armenian meaning it means sibling in turkish ) . 
  thanks for the info . 
  i will definetly visit . 
  unrelated question : i am very interested in armenian culture and armenians . 
  do you think will i be alright , if i visit armenia alone and say i am turkish ? 
  ( and my name might create a bad first impression ), 
  same with budapest man . 
  i would kill to live there . 
  turkish : iki, 
  hey there !, 
  coming with a response after 4 months :d this is my ( bad ) translation : `` we are mourning for our common pain , which has been experienced 100 years ago in this soil '' `` never again ( in armenian ) '' `` the pain that is experienced through ottoman empire times is still fresh . 
  it is time to face this scar , which paralyzes human reasoning , conscience and sense of justice ; to not to let it never happen again '', 
  yeah i should edit that , cause i have only seen tallinn . 
  but many people say tartu is also amazing . 
  estonia might be the best country i have seen . 
  a very sweet city , beautiful people , good prices ( only clothes are a bit high ) , low population , nature , history , no religion , close to other beautiful cities ( st. petersburg , riga , helsinki ) , no hot weather . 
  lol are they turkic ? 
  because in ancient turkic religion god ( tengri ) is the sky , and i know many turkics still keep some of pagan traditions . 
  if i understood you right , ice alone should not turn raki into white color . 
  it turned white because there is also some water in it . 
  generally you add some water to raki and put ice after it . 
  how do you drink ouzo ? 
  i have one of [ these ] ( http://www.bestgreekfood.com/image/journal/article?img_id=66006&amp;t=1363792717335 ) i guess i can drink it the way i drink raki, 
  are n't they all white in pictures ? 
  when we want a fancy drinking night we prepare a table like [ this ] ( http://666kb.com/i/c7bgak7qd736dsj7i.jpg ) ( or go to a restaurant that prepare those ) and drink [ raki ] ( http://www.hedede.com/wp-content/uploads/raki-turkish.jpg ) with it . 
  of course there are many other types . 
  some go with the [ fish ] ( http://www.ciftlikdergisi.com.tr/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/rakfdbalfdk1.gif ) , some go with [ kebap ] ( https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xpf1/t51.2885-15/e15/11055485_910518905666230_267297219_n.jpg ) . 
  i prefer my raki with some [ aegean cheese ] ( http://www.hasanbey.com/uploads/cache/21/1a/211aaf99ed86f46633d36a860624ac2f.jpg ) , [ cig kofte ] ( http://nerokebap.com.tr/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/i%c4%9fk%c3%b6fte.jpg ) and [ salgam juice ] ( http://www.hurriyetaile.com/userfiles/tarif/2369_420x315.jpg ), 
  at 00:38 irish guy pulls the refrigerator door very strong and everything inside falls . 
  then shop owner comes with a stick in his hand and decides to use it on the tourist guy . 
  this was all over the news today both on tv and internet . 
  many people who hate store owners ' greed and tendency to use mob violence at every possibility are very pleased to watch this . 
  you are a true hero irish boxer dude . 
  islam will only cause damage in europe ( including us ) now . 
  it became the symbol of ignorance and violence in this century . 
  islam had a chance to be better , but the collapse of ottomans and manipulations of british empire ( aiding of wahabis ) and u.s.a. ( using mujahideen against soviets ) made it impossible . 
  maybe it 's different in different cultures . 
  i never celebrate ramadan or sacrifice feast , and none of my friends do . 
  ( though i am expected to join when i am with family ), 
  this story needs to be on polandball, 
   if they ca n't realise they 're on christan continent i thought europe is the continent of secularity and enlightenment . 
  `` we are prototurk and this one is called ( with growling ) : invention of yoghurt '' ( death metal riff starts ), 
  yoghurt is invented by proto-turkic people ( bulgars were in that group very long ago ) . 
  we are still using the word 's etymological root `` yo\u011fusmak '' .
