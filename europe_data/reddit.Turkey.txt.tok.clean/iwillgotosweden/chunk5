  the author is biased or not , i would expect any kind of corruption from turkey under erdo\u011fan . 
  people have a right to be against a culture , if it makes them uncomfortable . 
  i was in prague and budapest last week . 
  i felt very comfortable because there was nothing about islam there , no public microfoned prayer , no hijab , no one staring at my wife . 
  when you live in a muslim majority country , you need this kind of environment sometimes . 
  i hope it is not ruined in the future . 
  haha thanks, 
  i thought rakia is similar to our raki or greek ouzo . 
  should try it then , 
  that 's true . 
  i do n't think being tolerant to homosexuality is a european value generally . 
  it has a long history in ottoman and ancient greece . 
  many turkish people have an unrealistic fear of eating pork as it will make them sick . 
  most popular arguments i hear : pigs eat their own shit ( yeah , and we have a very popular dish made of lamb intestines ) , you will stop being jealous of your girlfriend after eating it ( which is ridiculous at every angle ) , it has some sort of chemical that is unhealthy ( trying to be scientific ) . 
  palinka is great !, 
  sadly i can not find it anywhere outside of macaristan . 
  `` i '' for turkish is actually evolved from `` men '' ( pronunciate as man ) . 
  i do n't know if they are really related but [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/fi-ugr-turk-comparison.png/420px-fi-ugr-turk-comparison.png ) is very interesting . 
  that looks pretty cool . 
  i am actually from the area that is close to hittite capital and yellow background makes sense . 
  i would love if our flag had a figure from an ancient anatolian civilization . 
  such as the [ hittite sun ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/d8/8d/fc/d88dfc9448a08a9ecd3df15c7ab8bc4c.jpg ) . 
  and the best color for turks is light blue , because for ancient turks sky ( tengri ) was the god . 
  and lets not forget kurds they like to use red , yellow and green . 
  sun is already yellow , so it would be a hittite sun on the blue sky with red and green stripes . 
  when i was in tallinn all i see was volkswagen and audi . 
  did n't expect honda . 
  it is one of the main news agencies in turkey . 
  it is reliable . 
  source in english : http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkish-airstrikes-target-isil-in-syria.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=85853&amp;newscatid=352 some newspapers say at least 35 isis terrorists died . 
  grey wolf nationalist attacked some korean tourists , damaged a chinese restaruant owned by an uyghur and harrassed a turkish-japanese semi-celebrity on twitter in order to ` protest ' china 's oppression on uyghurs ( which are turkic people in western china ) . 
  ok i 'll keep trying :(, 
  hey , we are your true friends . 
  yeah . . kind of . . http://galeri12.uludagsozluk.com/551/osmanl%c4%b1da-o%c4%9flanc%c4%b1l%c4%b1k-k%c3%bclt%c3%bcr%c3%bc_694621.jpg http://turkiye.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/escinsel-minyaturler-4.jpg https://pbs.twimg.com/media/bo_yqcscaaadta3.jpg http://galeri8.uludagsozluk.com/461/osmanl%c4%b1-padi%c5%9fahlar%c4%b1n%c4%b1n-%c3%a7o%c4%9funun-o%c4%9flanc%c4%b1-olmas%c4%b1_703495.jpg http://pbs.twimg.com/media/bslpzmcceaalleg.jpg:large, 
  maybe it 's also time for us to sail to a certain sea , 
  fiji is ready to fight global warming . 
  estonia 's population , 
  it happened 3 times in the history of turkey . 
  a hot shot right-wing man of the people coming into power with 35 % -50 % ... 
  it is so classic , and they all lost at some point . 
  1st one is executed by the army , 2nd one died under suspicious circumstances 3rd one became president and his party slowly faded away . 
  and now we have erdo\u011fan . 
  as much as i hate him i want him to be fairly judged on a trial . 
  you can read it all here : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_the_republic_of_turkey names are : adnan menderes , turgut \u00d6zal , s\u00fcleyman demirel, 
  every other party believes akp is extremely corrupt . 
  mhp is a racist and islamist party ( they were very violent in the 70s and 80s until their current leader drove ( mostly ) the followers from the streets ) and they are somewhat true in their beliefs compared to akp 's money-thirsty people . 
  i think mhp values `` turkishness '' a little more than `` islamism '' , and they are also upset about akp 's talks with the pkk 's head . 
  they still have a lot in common but if akp dissolves there is a possibility that mhp may become the main right party of turkey . 
  akp and mhp are conservative chp and hdp are rather left and secular mhp and hdp hate each other chp and mhp can meet at nationalism but they are the opposite in secularism everybody hates akp hdp promised that they wo n't be in a coalition with akp before the election akp is chp 's arch enemy ( and vice versa ) . 
  mhp stated they wo n't be in a coalition with anyone yesterday akp is are open to coalition with anyone ( except chp ) so i do n't have any idea . 
  it is like game of thrones at the moment . 
  we did it boys . 
  we won the democracy . 
  and it was advanced !, 
  i have been voting for ten years , and voted for chp all the time . 
  for the first time i am voting for hdp . 
  i hope they will pass the threshold and hit a big slap to erdo\u011fan 's face . 
  i have been to kvlt store in helsinki . 
  i think beherit drummer owns the place . 
  it is very little but nice . 
  they were selling patches with ` x ' on turkish flag lol, 
  i would n't join ww1 with germans and do everything to keep [ these ] ( http://da4ottomanempire.weebly.com/uploads/1/3/5/4/13546577/882094291.gif?529 ) juicy lands , and not kill our own people . 
  instead of endless wars there 'd be a rich ottoman republic with armenians , arabs , greeks , jews and assyrians . 
  and no israel !, 
  and no saudi !, 
  can you expand on this ? 
  why would western powers like kemal more than greeks ? 
  yes they count turkey as 99 % which is not . 
  netherlands - people were very friendly and warm . 
  i love pagan turkic/mongol names and how widely we use them . 
  there are some names with hilarious meanings . 
  they are mostly used in anatolian countryside . 
  worst : yeter ( meaning : `` enough ! '', 
  it 's more likely to be given if you had many children and want no more ) , sat\u0131lm\u0131\u015f ( meaning : `` sold '' , i really do n't have any idea why people give this name ) , harika ( meaning : great ) , rahim ( arabic meaning : an adjective of god , turkish meaning : vagina ) , imdat ( meaning : `` help !, 
  '' ) , durkad\u0131n ( meaning : `` stop woman '' ) ... and many others i can not remember . 
  stambulas is a more badass name than istanbul . 
  where do i get my eu identity card ? 
  it was like a rule , if you are a man you had to smoke . 
  after 80 's 90 's more women started smoking , as it became more socially acceptable ( almost all the `` bad women '' in old turkish movies are smokers ) . 
  now i see decrease in smoking , especially among young people . 
  and now there are many bans on smoking in many public places . 
  perhaps this is the only positive thing government did in 13 years ( even though it comes from erdo\u011fan 's personal dislike ), 
   ironically he was murdered by a greek ( ogun samast ) i think this supposed to be some kind of racist joke . 
  og\u00fcn samast is from the north east anatolia ( pontus ) where it was dominantly greek ( and georgian and armenian ) , and very religious ( orthodox christianity ) . 
  it was ( probably ) the last greek land conquered by ottomans in anatolia . 
  back to 550 years later north eastern anatolia is still very religious and proud about their nationality , but this time as muslim and turkish ( however people stayed almost the same genetically ) . 
  [ some people ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hemshin_peoples ) even claim they are turks although they speak a form of armenian . 
  after the turkish republic is founded on a very nationalistic base , anatolian people who speak turkish ( or just started speaking turkish ) started being very proud about their legendary asian ( turkic , hunnic , genghis khan whatever ) heritage , and sometimes people used other ethnicities as insults . 
  calling north easterners as rum ( greek ) , darker skinned turks as arab or kurd or people from some cities armenian are popular insults for some people . 
  well ottomanism includes balkans and middle east . 
  anatolianism could have been a more local approach . 
  the quote under the headline belongs to the wife of murdered armenian-turkish journalist hrant dink . 
  retarded pan-turkic ideas really fucked up everything in this country . 
  should have focused a new anatolian idea and everything would be a million times better . 
  do you feel the same way my bolghar friend ? 
  lol most of erdo\u011fan supporters ca n't start a computer . 
  if you go to london there is a [ branch ] ( http://www.simitsarayi.com/en_us/her-yerdeyiz/yurt-disi ) of a popular turkish simit franchise there . 
  i usually buy from local places , but it should be good enough . 
  when i want something salty : * [ simit ] ( http://www.boozyburbs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/2012-12-31-10.37.47-600x450.jpg ) ( almost any kind , 2 of them ) * [ izmir tulum cheese ] ( http://peynirmatik.com.tr/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/izmir-tulum-peyniri.jpg ) and [ kirma zeytin ] ( http://kayhanzeytinleri.com/images_up/yesilzpop.jpg?lightbox[autoresize]=false ) ( both from aegean area ) * and [ \u00e7ay ] ( http://41.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lybebtg3d21qgkh3mo1_1280.jpg ) ( from eastern black sea brands , without sugar ) when i want something sweet and it is winter : * [ tahin and pekmez mix ] ( http://www.herkesesaglik.com.tr/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_112863349.jpg ) * some kind of bread . 
  * and also [ \u00e7ay ] ( http://41.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lybebtg3d21qgkh3mo1_1280.jpg ),
