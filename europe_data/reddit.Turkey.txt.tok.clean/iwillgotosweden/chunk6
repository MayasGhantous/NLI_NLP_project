  we did it before it was cool . 
  same with ours . 
  that 's why wikipedia is better than any other history book taught in schools . 
  serbia : in the [ battle of ankara ( 1402 ) between ottomans and timurids ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_ankara ) , serbs that were fighting on the losing ottoman side died with honor , while tatars and other turkish beyliks deserted their positions and joined to timur . 
  greece : after the [ siege of tripolitsa ( 1821 ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_tripolitsa ) which lead to the greek independence from ottoman , all the jews in the area were killed along the muslims .

  the first lady before e.erdogan for comparison xd http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/11/22/article-2064784-0ee71cff00000578-395_634x570.jpg, 
  hey this is creative, 
  man i would really like beer right now , and a hug !, 
   what part of anatolia are your roots from ? 
  butt the fuck off ? 
  we lost so many things ( culture , diversity , tolerance ) with the loss of greeks/armenians/jews / syriacs . 
  it will be even worse if we lose kurds . 
  < now i will act like a greek in turkey/ottoman related threads  is this revolution that you ( yes , personally you ) killed 15k turkish civilians ? 
  we call it `` kol b\u00f6re\u011fi '' . 
  roughly translated as `` arm b\u00f6rek '', 
  i think he will die as president . 
  hope it will be early and violent . 
  you should be a proud ` earthling ' . 
  it 's secret kebab plan to reunite balkans, 
  i think it has a different definition in every country . 
  here , everybody is considered white ( there is almost no africans ) . 
  even though we have people with different looks ( mediterranean , middle eastern , slavic , caucasian ( literally ) , asian ) we do n't have classifications like white or brown . 
  you can be called blonde ( sar\u0131\u015f\u0131n ) or yellow ( sar\u0131 ) and tan ( esmer ) or dark ( kara ) . 
  for example ex-prime minister [ b\u00fclent ecevit ] ( http://cdn.listelist.com/listeliststatic/2014/05/bulent-ecevit-13.jpg ) 's nickname was `` kara o\u011flan '' ( the dark boy ), 
  that 's too ... specific . 
  yeah , you dig a lot when you lose big time . 
  word bazaar is originally coming from persian language . 
  i think some of these words are just maybe coming from a common root because many of them are created from verbs that have been around for a very long time . 
  for example : sarma -  sarmak ( to cover ) \u00c7ekmece -  \u00c7ekmek ( to pull ), 
  the main reason is not being muslim . 
  you know they can always turkify the other muslims ( including armenian and georgian muslims ) which they did mostly . 
  these thing happen in turkish prisons . 
  if you are a rapist , or a big shot terrorist like anders here , you might get shished ( yeah that 's what is called :d ) by the mafia in prison . 
  went sweden 2 times did n't dare to eat it . 
  `` pide '' is originally a greek word . 
  lol no europe has nothing to do with it . 
  14 years ago , all the right-wing parties collapsed ( another story ) and erdogan won the elections . 
  he looked liked progressive for a while to gain the support of some naive leftist and liberals . 
  in the mean time he allied with a us-backed islamist organization ( who are enemies of erdogan now ) and did everthing to weaken secular structures of the state ( mostly succeeded ) . 
  now the last few years everybody sees his true intentions . 
  it 's not over yet . 
  this year , his followers will create a new constitution , and many people will vote for it . 
  new constitution will enable the arrest of mp 's . 
  all the progressive/secular mp 's will be arrested or scared , and he will finally rule by the iron fist . 
  unless a coup happens . 
  which happens every 15-20 years . 
  and sometimes with executions . 
  * greeks have solid metal bands * syria has beautiful food * iran has great architecture, 
  we generally have high expectations . 
  erdo\u011fan is very unpopular with people who have more than average education . 
  here you see it a lot , and ca n't see his supporters ' point of view . 
  because they ca n't speak english , 
  there are just suspicions . 
  when we say western turkey it 's agean shores and thraccia ( and we can include some big cities in the west such as eski\u015fehir ) . 
  when you go 100-200 km 's inside you see the change . 
  central anatolia and eastern black sea area are giving the biggest support to akp . 
  it sometimes rises to 80 % . 
  i heard they had this burkas in southern italy too . 
  that seems likely considering babek zencani 's ( who was sentenced death penalty ) case in iran . 
  yeah man , we are like the smallest island in caribbean . 
  that 's what i say when i travel to sweden . 
  i check begginner lessons for every language on duolingo and polish made no sense to me . 
  i do n't think we have any chance of becoming eu member with erdo\u011fan now , and things went really bad really fast . 
  for people like me who opposes erdo\u011fan ( half of the country ) eu is really down on the list . 
  we are on the brink of becoming next ukraine or syria . 
  everyday i am warning my family to not to go crowded places . 
  first thing we must stop the violence , and then get rid of erdo\u011fan . 
  then we can try to join eu . 
  yes . 
  i love the wooden church in helsinki . 
  in our minds secular = left . 
  but , compared to today 's values , turkish republic is established with very racist , secular and western ideas . 
  i think it depends how much support/respect that leader/and party has in society . 
  opposition party chp was founded by atat\u00fcrk who gets tremendous amount of respect even from people who vote for other parties . 
  so kemal k\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu is on a safer spot compared to normal people . 
  the people who do n't respect atat\u00fcrk are mostly islamists and maybe nationalist kurds . 
  so , even after 13 years of rule , erdo\u011fan does not dare to talk shit about atat\u00fcrk . 
  i think it 's cool that you get to learn a language that your country have historical/cultural bonds . 
  in my highschool german was taught ( very little though ) after english . 
  i would rather take greek or persian courses . 
  after 50 years we have become honorary member . 
  many people probably think that the only way to learn a language is to enroll into paid courses . 
  also the food . 
  same here for swedish . 
  is n't magyaristan largely steps ? 
  i went in october , it was pretty cool . 
  it was around -1 degrees and there was some sun . 
  you hate mongols , we hate huns , greece hates all . 
  you can actually see that ottoman ( and other turkic beyliks/duchies in anatolia ) is founded by people who were basically running away from mongols . 
  it 's nothing compared bulgaria forgetting its turkic heritage xd, 
  just curious , any neo-pagans there ? 
  i remember reading about a new movement . 
  most iranians are shia and the biggest enemies of isis . 
  there are too many . 
  wikipedia says 12 wars were fought with russia ( ottomans got rekt most of the time ) , 11 fought with persia ( mostly when persia ruled by a turkic dynasty ) , 8 with venice , 8 with poland-lithuania , and considerable numbers with habsburgs and bulgarians . 
  however if you count as eastern romans/greeks vs ottomans/turks . 
  this would be the highest . 
  when you become muslim you get free ` summon explosives ' ability 3 times a day .
