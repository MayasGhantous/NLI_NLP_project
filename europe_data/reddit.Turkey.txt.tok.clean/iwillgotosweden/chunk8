  but the ancient names were too tiring , and there is absolutely no way to know the origin of some of the names . 
  so i guess author took initiative and accepted some of them as hittites . 
  for example for `` urfa '' , i could n't find any evidence for hittite . 
  it 's in the meeting point of anatolia and mesopotamia . 
  also for `` ankara '' there is a speculation that it is a celtic name , because it 's founded by a celtic tribe ( galatians ) . 
  github is blocked too wtf, 
  can confirm . 
  swedes put distance , even if you try hard to get closer . 
  however if you show a finnish person that you are interested to talk with him/her , he/she quickly becomes more friendly . 
  ( of course my encounters were only 5-10 people , but who does n't love generalizing ), 
  baltics have the best autumn . 
  lol good old r/europe upvoting . 
  dividing ottoman empire in the middle east was a mistake . 
  and his grandfather, 
  yeah similar but tahin is liqiud . 
  you probably have it in macedonia . 
  mix of [ tahin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tahini ) ( sesame paste ) and [ pekmez ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pekmez ) ( some kind of grape syrup ) : http://www.pekmez.gen.tr/images/tahin-pekmez-faydalari.jpg, 
  we too , we call it `` ek\u015fili k\u00f6fte '' . 
  name varies in different regions tho, 
  there was no regulation until recently . 
  erdogan 's party akp , made it 22:00 or 22:30 . 
  i do n't care though . 
  my local store sells anytime i want . 
  thanks , i will definitely come !, 
  i have a special interest in armenian culture . 
  i see . . my father told me a story . 
  about 25-30 years ago he met an armenian couple . 
  they got into an argument ( not in an offensive way ) about the genocide - my father was ignorant to the issue like everyone else . 
  so he decided to prove we are good people , by inviting them to our home :d and they came . 
  they had a good time i guess . 
  not as dark as his but [ here ] ( http://imgur.com/la1jwdh ), 
  i want to visit armenia through georgia , would i get into trouble if i tell people i am turkish ? 
  or should i tell them i am greek ? 
  i think , i will go with the name kostas mitroglu . 
  soon , i hope . 
  60 years ago even the sect ( like catholic or orthodox ) you belonged was written . 
  i am an atheist and in my id card it writes `` islam '' . 
  all the people i know is the same . 
  the actual data in turkey probably looks like greece or poland . 
  those teachers are mostly socialists/leftists . 
  after usa deals , government got their ass covered and starting purging everyone who are not their supporters . 
  not good with finding names . 
  so i typed what i want most at that time . 
  from personal experience i can say finns are very friendly , if other person makes the first step . 
  if you are italian , you wo n't be very impressed . 
  what you are saying is generally the right thing . 
  but you ca n't fight islamism with democracy . 
  [ aegean ] ( http://www.bilgizenginleri.org/attachments/6110d1331304483/zeybek-k-yafetleri.jpg ) outfits are pretty cool . 
  we have the sexiest fault lines, 
  no man [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bc/an_ottoman_miniature_from_the_book_sawaqub_al-manaquib_depicting_homosexuality.jpg ) is our culture . 
  what is the reason ? 
  western world ( including usa ) does not want erdo\u011fan anymore . 
  i hope all this ends without much trouble . 
  death penalty wo n't happen . 
  erdo\u011fan knows if he enables death penalty there is a high chance that it will bite him in the ass . 
  suck it middle east and balkans !, 
  the coup guys were just a different kind of islamists . 
  i hate erdo\u011fan a lot , but these guys are far worse than erdo\u011fan . 
  erdo\u011fan comes from the mainstream islamist ideology , that you could see in most anatolian towns . 
  he could shake hands with women without hijab , or he could have friends that drink alcohol . 
  but these guys are crazy . 
  they are a cult : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_csqyhdew4, 
  well , the last time ( 50 's i think ) we started getting close to russians , a coup happened and the prime minister was executed . 
  i would never do such thing . 
  exactly . 
  yeah , usa have never plotted a coup in other countries . 
  / s it 's like a consensus in turkey now . 
  all ( islamists , seculars , leftists . . ) believe usa had some kind of involvement in it . 
  yeah http://blogs.cfr.org/lindsay/files/2013/03/pew-most-rate-us-postively.jpg, 
  erdo\u011fan thought he could control them , or they would be loyal to him . 
  cause they were both on the `` team islam '' . 
  but none of these happened , and erdo\u011fan is fighting against islamism now :d, 
   but people of turkish descent in european countries as well . 
  i think it 's about our educational system . 
  people are very nationalistic , they stick to their roots . 
  if you do n't keep your identity , you betrayed your `` t\u00fcrkness '' . 
  turkey ( ottoman ) was an islamic empire . 
  while it was falling a high-ranking soldier who thought european system ( at that time very nationalistic and secular ) is better , saved what 's left and found a new republic . 
  m. kemal atat\u00fcrk was a radical secular who openly [ told ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lz-kajhkqmu ) his party 's principles does not comply with quran . 
  he closed all the islamist sects , ended the caliphate , made people [ wear ] ( http://imgur.com/yymperg ) european clothes , replaced arabic alphabet with the latin , removed many arabic words from the language and invented new turkish words . 
  and he was very authoritarian , while doing these reforms he executed all the opposition ( even the ones who refused to wear western [ hats ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c4%b0skilipli_mehmed_at%c4%b1f_hoca ) ) , ended riots with huge casualties , and even waged war with a whole [ city ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dersim_massacre ) . 
  the secular people you see in turkey now , are the ones who open-handedly accepted these changes and the people who liked these ideas better over the time ( like [ alevi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alevism ) people ) . 
  you can say it 's around 40 % of the population . 
  the other 60 % is the conservatives of turkey . 
  some sees atat\u00fcrk as a great leader even though he oppressed their grandfathers . 
  but also there are many others who hated him . 
  after many years , majority of conservatives agreed ( erdo\u011fan 's votes varies from 35 % to 50 % through the years ) on a leader . 
  this also happened in 50s , but [ he ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/adnan_menderes ) got couped ( usa helped a lot ) and executed . 
  so after a hundred years of history , they are sticking to erdo\u011fan no matter what . 
  they do n't want seculars again , they want to continue their good old islamist ways , and they do n't care about freedom of speech . 
  because that 's how they are raised : they ca n't talk back to their fathers ( or other respected ones ) . 
  they have submitted an authority figure in their whole life . 
  now it 's erdo\u011fan the father of their new republic . 
  he seems scared . 
  he also started installing secular generals to the army . 
  they even hanged atat\u00fcrk poster to the party building 's wall . 
  http://d.abcgazetesi.com/news/28172.jpg we are surely living in the weirdest times . 
  not dead yet . 
  it 's more like islamists attacking other islamists . 
  i find it funny that many people here think kosovo is like cyprus or azerbaijan .
