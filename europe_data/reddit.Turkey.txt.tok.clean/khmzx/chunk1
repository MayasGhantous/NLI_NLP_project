also 500.000 turks are genocided by armenians . 
  15 % of turkey . 
  woah , really terrible !, 
  woah , this is too much !, 
  [ also , i think most terrifying fact is pkk is using little kids at conflict - 03:06 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxqmyri8ugk ), 
   more clashes between kurds and turks in europe . 
  did you read the article ? 
   chp 's current leader is an alevi kurdish no , k\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu is turkmen . 
  he is explained this on tv . 
   occupation of cyprus 1 word : eoka . 
  if they want to live in somewhere . 
  they can live in north iraq kurdish region . 
  why does everything have to be associated with erdogan ? 
  frederike is known for his news related to the pro-pkk . 
  also , she is known as a person who constantly criticized the chp ( secular party ) . 
  ********** ** turkish armed forces had received certain information about activities at the region supplied by united states intelligence services [ 12 ] that was based on a u.s. drone [ 13 ] ten days before the incident . 
  the footage of the unmanned aerial vehicles flying over the terrain was `` mistakenly '' evaluated as a group of militants of the kurdistan workers ' party ( pkk ) . 
  erdogan is threat for turks . 
  best decision . 
  turkey is not rich . 
  turkey has 1.5-2 million refugees already . 
  [ do you mean this ? 
  ] ( http://youtu.be/4cd49rffpqc ), 
  praising the pkk terrorist organization is a crime !, 
  `` freedom '', 
  who care ? 
  we love taking risks . 
  war crime . 
  they are targeting civilians like always . 
  proof ? 
  i dont think so . 
  apologise for the mistake , offer to recompense families of the dead cvilians ( turkmens ) . 
  note : i am anti-erdogan . 
  russians were massacring civilians ( turkmens ) . 
  [ also turkmens are fighting against isis .

  but , russians were massacring civilians ( turkmens ) . 
   the people of turkey booed the french anthem https://www.reddit.com/r/turkey/comments/3tzkxz/german_soccer_fans_show_that_they_can_be_as/, 
  [ 2007 ankara suicide attack ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_ankara_bombing ) [ perpetrators ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kurdistan_freedom_falcons#attacks ), 
  lmao , we are arresting isis terrorists . 
  stop lying . 
  also ...  ypg are just simply defending themselves https://www.amnesty.org/en/press-releases/2015/10/syria-us-allys-razing-of-villages-amounts-to-war-crimes/ http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/10/syria-turkey-right-groups-accused-kurds-rojava-of-war-crimes.html, 
  ypg were using our hospitals too . 
  i dont know how . 
   there are only 1 separate event before the stuff the coup government did and that 's dersim massacre which is horrible and even erdogan apologized for it . 
  i believe erdogan apologized for insulting atat\u00fcrk . 
  we do not know what really happened in dersim . 
  note that world made the is possible by letting people pass to turkey with passport checks for a very long period . 
  lol , they are kurd :d https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3ep1j9/turkey_drops_bombs_on_kurdish_group_that_fought/cthsix6, 
  good bye world !, 
  good bye secular turkey [ ;( ] ( http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/epicrapbattlesofhistory/images/a/a9/crying-gif-24.gif/revision/latest?cb=20150227011925 ), 
  he did n't ordered anything like that . 
  he ordered to kill rebels . 
  he asked for kurdistan but most of kurds refused . 
   he did n't have to suppress the kurdish population either he didnt kill civilians , only rebels . 
  time next :d, 
  you forgetten : turkey out of nato , armenian genocide , genocidal turks , turkey out of eu . 
  okay done . 
   and its in turkeys interest to bomb kurds all over the world yea , my kurdish friend bombed yesterday with turkish f16 in middle of istanbul . 
  sure he wasnt pkk member . 
  lol, 
   isis held territory okay . 
  oh downvotes :d lol 'd so hard, 
  do n't talk with him , never mind . 
  do n't feed the troll . 
  he is not our interlocutor . 
  lol , kid stop spamming your lies about turks everywhere . 
  stay classy , do n't be fascist . 
  not going to waste my time here . 
  / r/turcophobia / , you know , i can do much more . 
  do n't try so hard  by the way i am atheist and hurriyet is anti-govt . 
  - . - [ rekt ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3pr5w5/pkk_bomb_attack_hits_public_offices_hospital_in/cw8qk2r ), 
  some turkish soldiers were killed by pkk after declaration of ceasefire ... 
  i can give some examples about this : [ the day of declaration of ceasefire ] ( http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/two-soldiers-killed-in-turkeys-east.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=89704&amp;newscatid=341 ) [ few days ago ] ( http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/soldiers-killed-in-latest-pkk-attacks-laid-to-rest-in-hometowns.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=90074&amp;newscatid=341 ), 
  one word : eoka, 
  then check the videos . 
  i saw with my eyes . 
  then why you told me that majority of kurds are supporting hdp and pkk ? 
   the lowest estimates for turkish kurds have been 15-19 million , and some go as high as 22 million . 
  there are more than 3 million kurds in istanbul alone , that 's only in 1 city . 
  proof ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  probably bomber was hudapar ( kurdish hizbollah ) member . 
  also suruc and diyarbak\u0131r bombers were kurdish hudapar member . 
   he is the only one to profit from such a horrific act do n't think so . 
  i am secular atheist so ... hdp got a lot of votes after diyarbak\u0131r bombing also diyarbak\u0131r and suruc bombers were hudapar ( kurdish hezbollah ) member . 
  hudapar ( kurdish hezbollah ) probably . 
  yea but they are few . 
  some pkk supporters were saying majority of kurds are supporting hdp and pkk . 
  choose one . 
  also , they got a lot of vote from secular turks . 
  i am living in ba\u011fc\u0131lar . 
  i did n't say i do n't see kurdish , but they are really few . 
  in my class 4/34 are kurd . 
  there are only 4 . 
  i am not even talking about other classes . 
  even there are turks who voted for hdp to melt akp 's power . 
  if there are 6 million voters , there cant be more than 2-3 million kid . 
  max . 
  kurd population is about 10 million in turkey .
