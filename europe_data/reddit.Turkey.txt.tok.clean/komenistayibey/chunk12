  some of these refugees do n't know turkish ( some learnt it and some are syrian turkmens which can speak turkish ) , they are mostly sunni and they are n't well educated.so they are different than turkish arabs in hatay . 
  if you inculude all of istanbul it is more than 15 million which is more than most balkan countries . 
  moment of [ explosion ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ihpey2ors ) . police officers tried to stop him and surrounded him but he detonates himself . 
  link is from the police bus . 
  yep, 
  wow !, 
  those 3d floor decorations looks like real fish . / s, 
  spoilers none of them exist they are actually merkel in a different outfit . 
  thanks again.it is not perfect but i wanted people to understand it ( i wanted to be as neutral as possible ) but i am on mobile and i am not a native speaker.if it helped people i guess it is something . 
  thank you . 
  no they are not jihadist but they are more like hardcore leftist . 
  `` they sacrificed themselves for revolution ! '', 
  kinda thing but results are as same as jihadist . 
  edit : they want to create a kurdistan so they `` sacrifice ( ! ) '', 
  themselves for it . 
  no problem.also they used fedai which means suicide bomber but it is more like who sacrificed themselves but i directly translated it as suicide bombers to make it clear . 
  kurdistan freedom falcons . 
  tak is know to target civilians and western cities.they say people in the west should suffer because people in the east suffers . 
  attacks like this are a good source for their propaganda ( unfortunately ) . they will gain more supporters and it will affect their morale in a poaitive way . 
  yep with 2 other parties and lost elections and did n't even enter the parliment in next elections ( also they did n't even enter the parliment in previous elections ) . hdp is a turkish party ( turkish means citizens of turkey and they also say we are turkey 's party and have many turks , kurds , zazas , armenians in their party ) so they are the 4 th largest party in parliment . 
  also majority of his party wanted to replace him and despite his warnings they meet for the congress but coup happened and it was forgoten ( i hope they can take the control until 2019 meral ak\u015faner would be a good leader ) . 
  by the way their numbers are very extaragated the real numbers are 38 dead 166 wounded . 
  you discovered my secret identity gj m8 . 
  edit : it was translation but close enough . 
   since you kill our people , behead them , torture them & call for destruction of kurdish cities . 
  then use `` ultranationalist '' , `` racist '' or something like that it would be better . 
  mhp only got % 10 in the elections . 
  erdo\u011fan started peace process to gain kurdish votes not to solve the problem.this doomed it from the start.many turkish people knew it was a mistake because akp allowed pkk to stockpile weapons in cities and when cease fire collapsed turkish people paid for akp 's stupidy . 
  there were n't nation wide protest.some racist people attacked to kurds many people damged hdp buildings but it was n't nation wide and they did n't got many support . 
  i am not white washing anything i just said what he said which is bad but not worse than tak.same goverment also allows kurdish mps to spill racist shit.don ' t act like turkey is a person , countries are ruled by goverments so you should blame the goverment calling a country that has 80m population racist is wrong . 
   just a few months ago a kurdish man was burned alive by a turk for '' being from the southeast '' ( synonym for being kurd ) . 
  not everyone in se is a kurd also he claimed that but it was actually because of a woman ( which does n't change anything he is an asshole ) . 
  so mhp represents all of turkish people and all of turkish people should die.also he said first we will evacuate so that ultranationalist fuck is a lot mercyful than tak who targets civilians . 
  yep they are using it since 1993, 
  pkk does n't have any connections thats why a pkk member can tell why 2 civilians deaths were accident ... 
  fuck my spelling :( sorry guys i am on mobile . 
  ~ ~ it is discusting these people exist . ~ ~ she even says there was n't a mourning for other ( she said pkk member said that but as a reporter she should check it before reporting . ), 
  isis attacks but turkish state declared in this one.she is wrong ~ ~ moron ~ ~ turkish state did n't also declared mourning in other tak attacks but she do n't understand it ~ ~ her racist and moronic brain is filled with so much propaganda she ca n't understand it . ~ ~ edit : i insulted her sorry i was very angry . 
  warning this might hurt your brain ** translation ** `` december 11 2016 ** statement ** in 10.12.2016 at 23.00 our s.tirej revenge team conducted 2 attacks in istanbul ma\u00e7ka and vodafone arena.due to our suicide bomb marties 100 police officers died and hundreds were wounded.we will share their personal informations in the following days . 
  turkish people are not tak 's target.and our s.tirej revenge team conducted the attack precisely , but while president apo 's captivity continues,tc-akp fascism tortures mothers , kills children and play with bodies of young girls in kurdistan they should n't expect to live a peaceful life in turkey.turkish people should stop this fascism because only akp is responsible of this fascism . 
  fascism will destroy itself or we will drown it in the the blood it spilled.every drop of blood from our comrades is a directive for more suciede attacks.kurdish people can be sure we will be victorious in this horrifying war !, 
  long live president apo !, 
  long live tak !, 
  long live kurds and kurdistan !, 
  for our marties !, 
  tak ( kurdistan freedom falcons ) '' edit : if you spotted any mistakes please tell me so i can correct it . 
  edit : corrected some edit : thanks u/abstractlemgth . 
  i am translating it please wait . 
  edit : sorry * translating, 
   are you implying that people who vote for chp are against the government 's terrorism in syria and iraq ? 
  they are not . 
   turkey is occupying iraqi territory , notably a town called bashika . 
  are you implying that chp supporters would actually be against other turks in regards to this debate ? 
  they are not . 
  turkey has a strong culture of solidarity . 
  turkey is n't occupying bashika town.bashika base is near the town.many chp supporters are against erdo\u011fan 's foreign policy but they support turkish soldiers  majority of kemalists are n't against erdogan 's policies in syria and iraq . 
  they would rather support erdogan 's policies in order to ` not weaken turkey ' than to admit fault . 
  many are against his foreign policy but many support operations in syria ( not war with syrian goverment.majority of turkish people are against a war like that . ), 
  because they want refugees to return and they do n't want pkk and isis to gain more power in syria . 
   do you know the mhp ? 
  it 's the ultranationalist party of turkey and an opposition party . 
  they idolize ataturk . 
  and * still * , the mhp ** supports erdogan 's policies in iraq and syria ** . 
  http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/bahceli-blames-iraqi-govt-for-tension-with-turkey-over-troop-deployment.aspx?pageid=517&amp;nid=92548&amp;newscatid=338 until recently they did n't call atat\u00fcrk as their ba\u015fbu\u011f but alparslan t\u00fcrke\u015f ( so they are not hardcore atat\u00fcrk supportes ) . they love atat\u00fcrk but they are also nationalist so they support turkey gaining more influence in the region ( also they do n't want isis and pkk to gain more power ), 
   what happened afterwards ? 
  turkish government and pkk started war again ( notice that turkish people almost unanimously supported erdogan destroying peace process ) pkk claimed turkey was destroying kurdish cultural sites with dams and were building outposts to fight against them and ended the cease fire.after suru\u00e7 bombing they killed 2 polices in their sleep and claimed it was a revenge for the bombing.a huge part of turkish people did n't supported process because goverment turned blind eye to pkk 's growth and they stopped operations against pkk when they were planting mines , stock piling weapons . 
  ( erdo\u011fan started that process to get kurdish support and it benefitted kurds a lot but he did n't do right things to solve problems he just wanted to gain votes which doomed the process from start . 
  ) when conflict started again turkish people turned out to be right and turkish forces and people paid for erdo\u011fan 's stupidity . 
   and then a new election happened . 
  and akp * again * won the elections , puting erdogan as head of parliament + government + president . 
  hdp promised peace but when conflict started they were not able to stop it and they did n't try to countine their `` turkey 's party '' slogan beacuse of that many kurds who voted for hdp voted for akp in the next election . 
   but it does n't stop there . 
  there is another party in parliament , the ultranationalist mhp . 
  they are basically a puppet show of erdogan . 
  their leader bahceli , supports almost everything of erdogan . 
  so if you cummulate that , it is n't '' just a slight majority '' voting for erdogan , but more than 60 % voted for the akp/mhp group ( who share the same voter base ) . 
  majority of mhp is against bah\u00e7eli and bah\u00e7eli did everything to stop them but when june coup attempt happend it was forgotten and leaders of the opposition in the party was called gulenist.you are claiming all mhp voters are voting for erdo\u011fan ( mhp and chp supported the same guy in presidential elections but he did n't win ) wtf realy?many people vote for akp because mhp 's bah\u00e7eli is shitty but there is n't any alternative to vote for . 
   this is n't a problem of people being held hostage by a dictator . 
  the average person in turkey supports his mindset . 
  yeah other 50 % do n't exist and let 's not even mention the fact that half of akp supporters vote for akp because of economy.it is selfish but during 2001 crisis many people lost a lot of things and now they do n't want a new crisis.during erdo\u011fan 's rule economy got aot better and turkey recovered from that crisis so they think he saved them ( in reality previous goverment pushed hard and did a lot to fix problems but bah\u00e7eli wanted an early election which made akp the first party.after they came to power those efforts made by previous goverment started to effect the economy in good way and they just countined it and listened to eu 's and imf 's suggestions which boosted economy a lot ( and they selected great people as economy ministers which made things a lot better ), 
  [ moment of explosion ] ( https://twitter.com/besiktascarsi/status/807682043077337088/video/1 ), 
  no , i did n't know.thanks for the info . 
  there is a city called turku in finland . 
  fun fact turku ( spelled as t\u00fcrk\u00fc ) means folk song in turkish . 
   the bosporus freezing over is not something that happens very often . 
  there have been various reports of previous freezes but there are centuries , or even millennia in between and some might not have been complete freezes , reliability of older stories is suspect . 
  i think the most recent one ( exculuding this one ) happend in 18th or 19th century so it is a 1 time experince if you are luckly enough to see one . 
  when it does n't snow in ankara we consider it as a cold winter because wind just fucks you ( fucking -10 \u00b0 c at morning and 4 \u00b0 c at peak and there are a lot of cities that are a lot colder than ankara ... ) . 
  turkey has a very different climate.they ( tourists ) mostly go to agean and mediterranean region for summer vacations because those regions have a warm climate but erzurum , kars , ardahan ( north eastern and eastern turkey ) is usually very cold and tourist usually go there for skiing ( unfortunately many foreigners do n't prefer erzurum for winter vacations ) or for hiking ( terrain is beautiful and very interesting ) . 
  edit : [ climate of turkey ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/climate_of_turkey ), 
  he only banned religous symbols for people who work in state instutes ( in state instutes they were allowed to wear it in their private life ) and it was the right choice ( except for imams , priest and other religous leaders and actors.they were allowed to wear them ) . 
  the problem is they are portraying it like all of turkey except for se is shitty and backwards.hdp improved but saying something like `` they solved all the problems '' is wrong ( some of their members still do those backwards things ) . se turkey still is the most conservative and backwards part of turkey ( mainly because of the economy and our southern neighboors are n't that advanced ) . 
  edit : * except, 
  economic unstabilty war with pkk in syria and this yeah 90s all over again ( plz no ) . 
  i am not sure about the year but my family emigrated before or after ww1 from vale ( today part of georgia ) to hanak ( today part of turkey ) those 2 places are very close eachother ( 78km from hanak to vale ) . we were luckly but many turks stayed there and were deported to central asia in 1944 . 
  he is getting charisma points from his supporters with his `` brave remarks '' ( which is stupid ) . erdo\u011fan does n't have total control over media but some people just don , t care and a lot of people vote for him for his economic success so they countine to vote for him.many people do n't want war and they wo n't support one so they wo n't push for goverment to take action . 
  he is damaging turkish - ( put any country here ) relations ( unfortunately ) . he has n't said anything to incrase hostilitys against greece he only critised lausanne which seems like he is critising greece but he is critising chp and early turkish republic but because of his remarks and propaganda hostility against eu increased ( which also inculudes greece ) . 
  in smaller picture there wo n't be a war opposition tries to use akp 's lies to counter them ( critising lausanne was mainly because erdo\u011fan ca n't directly critise atat\u00fcrk but also he can critise chp with saying atat\u00fcrk wanted to gain mosul etc. 
  but you did n't push for it.so he pleases anti-atat\u00fcrk and pro atat\u00fcrk crowd at the same time ) . in bigger pictur akp 's foreing policy was a mess now they are trying to fix it ( they are improving relations with russia , iran , israel and working on projects with greece ) . so he wo n't declare war or anything like that . 
  yeah it is great for click bait but a lot of people belive it ( unfortunately ) .
