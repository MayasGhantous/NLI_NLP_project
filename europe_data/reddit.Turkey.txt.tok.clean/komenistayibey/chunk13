  i am not blaiming you but sometimes some news sites try to show it like `` turks are preaparing to invade us !! 1 !! 1 ! 1 !! 11 ! '', 
  turks invested a lot because they wanted to improve it to gain more infulunce.turkey for now spend billions and did n't get enough.cyprus did n't unify because they ca n't meet on a common point ( and when turkish-greek or turkish-eu relations gets bad it also affects cyprus ) . 
  trnc is dependent on turkey and turkey spent billions on them.turkey was importing a lot of things and after the ambargo turkey suffered serious economic loses ( but in the short term . in long term it benefited turkey because turkish industry got a lot bigger because there were n't any foreign competetors and people needed stuff and turkish military industry was founded after that ambargo now we can produce advanced military equipment . ), 
  it not only decreased the support for the goverment but support for the leftist . 
  almost no goverment officals say anything about those islands only erdo\u011fan critises lausanne because he ca n't critise atat\u00fcrk himself ( he can but people will get mad ) . so turkey wo n't try to do something like that . 
  ok mr.putin . 
  yi\u011fit bulut ( aka j\u00f6leli aka wtf is this guy saying ) . some akp supporters will force them selves to belive it hmmm . 
  one of those spies is called [ wilco you can see his evil plans by looking at his eyes ] ( https://www.google.com.tr/search?q=wilco+yemek&amp;safe=strict&amp;client=ms-android-huawei&amp;biw=360&amp;bih=511&amp;prmd=ivn&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjylcrxi-xqahudvbqkhfpdd14q_auibsgb#imgrc=jnlnvdc7htpcrm%3a ) / s i hope wilco wo n't get offened by j\u00f6leli 's statements . 
  turkey got sanctioned in 1973 and sanctions increased after 1974 ( operation attilla-invasion of cyprus ) and it not only damaged turkish economy but also goverment at the time ( leftist ) lost support in the long run even after the succes of operation . 
  turkish economy will get affected a lot if they try to do that and goverment at the time will lose support.also a war between would be a lot more bloodier due to their millitary sizes . 
  yeah but there is n't any offical claims on which islamds except for few and turkish goverment indicated it might be inculuded in grey zone ( it was probably done to piss of greece since they did n't claim it before ) . 
  [ wikipedia article ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/aegean_dispute ) gives a detail about turkish claims . 
  akp claims they are disputed and they are n't hundreds of kilometers away from turkey or greece.those islands turks claim are ( disputed area ) very close to turkey but not far away from greece . 
  a hdp mp said `` know your place '' to people who came from caucasia and balkans also some said `` pkk will drown you in their spit '' etc.these are just populist statements they just say it to gain more moronic support.erdo\u011fan has been saying i ll send refugees to europe since 2015 but he wo n't do it , erdo\u011fan said he would pray in syrian mosque he wo n't , erdo\u011fan said `` why are you in libya '' to nato forces but he changed to `` kaddafi must go '' , he negotiated with pkk and now says `` we wo n't negotiate with terrorist '' . people need to know what turkish mps said but giving a part of it without giving the full speech and without giving detail about chp is just stupid.a war did n't happen at the end of 90s and it wo n't happen now . 
  he said it to respect the greek flag.he also said he will fold it carefully.it might sound stupid but flags means a lot to turks so they do n't want to insult it ( except for few morons ) . 
   they expanded in : podolia ( very briefly ) and hungary they captured nearly all of podolia and they captured crimea.they also captured few castles in italy but retreated after sultan mehmed 's death . 
   that 's it for europe outside of the balkans . 
  they waged wars with poland , a smaller country for 100 years and could n't expand substantially . 
  they waged wars with austria - a much smaller country , for 200 years and could n't expand at all . 
  they waged wars with russia - a comparable , but much poorer country , and were beaten back every time . 
  empire started to fight against eastern powers and tried to capture mena this slowed down the advances in europe.also ottomans did n't fight against only one of those countries they had no allies in europe and were muslim so other european countries helped them to stop ottomans . 
  [ polish-ottoman wars ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish\u2013ottoman_wars ) [ russo-turkish wars ] ( https://simple.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/russo-turkish_war ) they advanced in austria but was beaten back after 2nd siege of vienna.they defetead russians many time but things changed when ottoman empire started to decline ( after 1689 ) . 
   so , yes , the ottomans had very , very limited success against european powers outside of the almost depopulated balkans , and were much more often beaten by them then won . 
  not that limited also they were often beaten after the second siege of vienna . 
   soon as they reached powers outside of it - poland , austria , russia , spain , they suddenly could n't expand that swiftly and were eventually thrown back . 
  no they were slowed down but they countine to expand until second siege of vienna . 
  most of them live in their own neighboorhoods so their views do n't change ( ofcourse not all migrants are same ) . 
  economic reasons . 
   `` i will go the islands and raise the turkish flag . 
  then i will fold the greek flag and send it to the greek government via courier service '' , turkish republican people 's party ( chp ) mp , tanzu ozkhan in the turkish national assembly . 
  the head of the conservative party , binali yildirim had recently called on the turkish government to reclaim 18 greek islands in the aegean sea he claimed belonged to turkey i wonder why they did n't mention what he said before that.he said akp did n't do anything when greece hoist greek flag on those islands ( akp says those islands are disputed but not doing anything against it ) . 
  do n't forget oda tv and cumhuriyet also reported it with details ( wrote articlea about the leaked mails ) . 
  they can and will live together but because of saddam 's policies some shias want revenge and some shias hold sunnis responsible for groups like isis . 
   that 's why they should do a real coup for once . 
  enslave every person allied to the akp , sp and hdp , ban the chp and the mhp as well . 
  arrest every one who dares to enter the streets to protest and enslave them too . 
  siege kurdish towns until they hand over/kill every pkk terrorists . 
  that 's how i would do it . 
  coups just create more problems.arresting those people will backfire few years later.state should educate people.educated people wo n't vote for parties like akp and they wo n't support pkk . 
   that 's beyond the point . 
  anatolia was likely inhabited by native anatolians and greeks , when the g\u00f6kturks invaded . 
  the g\u00f6kturks assimilated the natives ( to a certain degree ; islam ) . 
  afterwards atat\u00fcrk assimilated the muslims to turks through turkification . 
  genetically - or however you wan na look at it - the amount of turkic people is very marginal . 
  seljuks or oghuzs invaded the anatolia.also the number of oghuz turks who came to anatolia was nearly as much as anatolia 's population ( oghuz turks was n't purely turkic they had many persian dna due to marriges ) . before atat\u00fcrk many muslims were assimilated to turks ( during 19th and 20th century ) . atat\u00fcrk pushed for it and removed many arabic and persian elements and he played a huge role in the creation of turkishness . 
   i 'm not saying the turks in turkey are ethnic greeks but they 're certainly not actual turkic people ( only culturally , and even then it 's marginally culturally ) . 
  langue and culture defines nationality.even turkish nationalism is n't based on genetics but based on cultre so saying they are not turkic is wrong ( saying they are not genetcly turkic is right ) . also other turkic groups are not 100 % turkic ( there is also nothing like 100 % x ) they were mixed with local population too . 
  have you ever lived under a junta regime?have you ever lived in turkey?so please stop saying things like `` they were only overthrowing erdo\u011fan '' . many gulenist played a part in the coup ( gulen is no different than erdo\u011fan ) while secularist soldiers supported him.because they know coups do n't work.erdo\u011fan is the president because of the coups.coups do n't fix anything they just make it worse . 
  aftet the 1960 coup menderes and his 3 ministers were hanged.menderes was n't a great leader but he became an important figure for conservative right and all the great changes 1960 coup made was rechanged in the 1980 coup and things became much worse than before . 
  1972 deniz gezmi\u015f and his friends were executed because military wanted to show socialism would n't be tolerated and now they are very important for turkish left . 
  after 1980 coup many people who were tortured in the diyarbak\u0131r prison joined pkk ( inculuding turks who wanted to get revenge ) . 
  my mother feared from soldiers because of those coups and during the coup attempt she did n't support it ( she is a kemalist ) . 
  those coups damage the turkish military and same military still pays for the mistakes that was done by those stupid people . 
  how?that half still gets attacked too and that half ( south ) is mainly shia while north is sunni . 
  no it is not.isis occupies half of iraq and has control of it while pkk does n't occupy or control any land in turkey.they ( pkk ) use suicide bombs , bombs and try to use hit and run tactics to attack targets . 
  they ( tak ) claimed it on their [ website ] ( http://www.teyrebazenkurdistan.com/ ) . 
  news [ reports ] ( http://m.t24.com.tr/haber/diyarbakirdaki-teror-saldirisini-tak-ustlendi,369296 ) about the attack . 
  i do n't know but they threatened turkey before ( turkey is fighting against them in syria and recently arrested a lot of important isis members ) . also they claimed 2016 diyarbak\u0131r bombing but they did n't do ( tak did that attack ) . 
  selling foreing currency is better for local currency ( tl ) and gold is a good investment since tl is falling but i do n't know if this has any other effects sorry . 
  he also told his supporters to attack people in markets , clubs and any unexpected location ( not only in turkey all over the west ) . 
  omg.these people only damage kurds.turkey should use it as a propaganda tool or should punish that man who lied to public . 
  he also told them to attack people in markets , clubs , and any unexpected location . 
  he was an oposition figure who critised erdo\u011fan and his economic fails and his corruption ( he is an economist ) but erdo\u011fan bought him and now he is spreading stupid propaganda.talking about `` evil foreign powers ( ! ) '', 
  etc.he does n't belive 1 thing he says ( there are videos him calling erdo\u011fan '' a coward '' and harshly critising akp ) but i guess erdo\u011fan pays him a lot . 
  edit : also he is erdo\u011fan 's economic advisers so he has nothing to do with military etc.

  what?this article is just pure yellow journialism.please do n't let your political views blind you . 
   we agreed on taking syrian refugees , not the whole population of mena countries . 
  and you should n't but if eu just increases border it wo n't help.it has to help to those countries who have refugee problems and has to help to those places where refugees come from.total number of refugees in europe are notthing compared to those in mena.eu and have to work with other countries to solve this problem . 
   if this is the price we have to pay , so be it . 
  eu ca n't just say `` so be it '' ( it has to be seen humane and helpful ) . it will create more problems in near future . 
   how exactly ? 
  countries like turkey host many refugees the refugee number will increase and goverment wo n't be able to deal with them and country will get more unstable and it might even cause an economic crisis which is bad for everyone.in the end they might allow them to leave to europe and many of the refugees will die on the sea or get to europe ( turkey is curently preventing them from going to europe because of that refugee deal ) . 
  thank you , i am on the mobile so sorry for mistakes . 
  securing europe 's borders wo n't end problems.those people escape from war.if they ca n't get to europe and if europe does n't cooparate with neighbooring countries those people will suffer.many european countires accepted to take refugees with treaties and if they do n't take any , europe will be seen as cruel and untrustworthy and i am not even adding the fact that neighbooring countires will get more unstable which will damage eu economicly ( maybe even more refugees ) . 
  do you really think not letting refugees come to europe ( without a some kind of refugee deal with a country ) wo n't create problems ? 
   turkey is fundamentally a stable country . 
  the reaction against the coup showed that the people was pretty much united against any non-democratic interference , from left to right . 
  it 's a strongly nationalistic country . 
  the fear that turkey will `` fall apart '' if we do n't guide them with our white hands is hilarious . 
  turkey wo n't fall apart but eu process helps turkey in the long run.akp lisented eu 's adiveces and fixed economic problems.it bolsted economy a lot and benefited everyome but now they stoped listening and economy is doing good . 
   then there 's the bs about the turkey deal being important for stopping refugee flows . 
  the reality is that closing the balkan border was what did it . 
  sweden introduced border controls overnight . 
  the result ? 
  90 % of border entrants fell within a week . 
  turkey holds refugees from going near borders with that deal which stops a lot of refugee waves . 
   the main problem is really the pull factors . 
  merkel is still holding out until the end , but whether she wants it or not , the forces are moving against her , both within and outside the country . 
   turkey will likely become an independent agent , moving away from nato into an uneasy sphere where it will move towards russia , china and the eu in equal measure depending on the issue . 
  it could also entertain military adventurism in the middle east , as we 've seen with incursions into iraq and syria lately . 
  because turkey joined nato to get help against soviet agresion.before that turkey was mostly neutral or soviet ally until soviets demanded land from turkey.turkey 's position ( turkey does a lot of trade with russia and china ) and her relations with nato allies forces turkey to have relations with other groups too.turkey wants to counter iran 's infulunce and wants to have better relations with those countries and having a group that is allied with pkk on your southern borders and a need for a safe zone in syria to send refugees back forces turkey to use a millitary solution . 
   whatever the excuse , its long past time to cut ties with the country . 
  there is a secular minority , which is of significant size , but they are simply being outbred by the anatolian ignorants and the kurds . 
  it is they who nursed fantasies of turkey becoming european .
