  you do n't cut the ties with a country.we are in 21th century and turkey has a lot of trade relations with eu which is good for eu and turkey . 
  and seculars are not minority .70 % turkish people and % 80 new generation supports secularism while only % 13 wants sharia law ( and half of them does n't want it to be forced against non-muslims ) . turkey is european and middle eastern at the same time.it is a combination of western and eastern civilization . 
   it was a beautiful dream but now its time to close the chapter . 
  no more delusions . 
  allow turkey to once again become the middle eastern , pro-islamist country it has been for most of its modern history . 
  they are only returning to their roots after a brief detour . 
  we should have nothing to do with them other than cordial relations . 
  no close partnerships . 
  no pretentions of accession . 
  turkey was n't pro-\u0130slamist country for most of her history.even erdo\u011fan was pro-west until 2013 and huge part of parties were just conservative right wing ones . 
   how many time arrogant turk need lesson from russia until you learn place . 
  russia not greece , russia not defenseless armenian . 
  russia big country how many time we need to chase you out of caucasus and balkans until you learn kebab tink he is of sooo strong you are not strong who you fight besides greec with stupid king russia destroy you never forget liberate bulgaraian othrodox , never forget liberate greek brother , liberate romanina never forget remov from balkans , remov from cacaus , remember this you not strong tupac fast raps shall destroy you tupac destroy ottoman 1878 sultan bow to czar tupac , tupac rap strike fear in heart of enemy , route enemy out of hill turks only good at bully little nieghbors poor little greece poor little bulgaria very strong . . hahaha not !, 
  russia teach you lesson ask germans , ask germans how prideful they are today , see germans today little enjineers no fighters just make bmw soon this will be of you , soon you will not be pridful soon you make bmw turkish you see friend . 
  german too scared to even touch flag now soon u fear too u see if you understood something like that from what i wrote i can only say `` ok m8 '' to you . 
  i am not twisting or sugar coating anything.turkey ( inculuding akp ) claims those islands are disputed but akp is n't doing anything about it.similar sites just share a piece of someones speech and write an article about it.domestic propaganda is different than foreing policy ( some sites wrote aritcles about how turkey declared war against syria because erdo\u011fan said `` we are in syria to ovethrow assad '' ) so saying they want to invade those islands is not true.he is using it as a propaganda tool to harm erdo\u011fan . 
  he said those islands were not left to greece with a treaty , so saying `` we lost islands with lausanne '' is hypocrisy ( akp says this ) . it is important where it was aimed at.he is n't going to declare war for them he is just using it as a tool to show how akp acts like . 
  ** translation ** `` there are 18 islands in aegaen that was n't given to greece with treaties ( disputed ) . there are greek flags on 18 of those islands.those islands belongs to us.it is under occupation.they ( akp ) always talking about nationalism.they say we lost islands with lausanne.i have a questions for binali y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m ( pm ) , will you get those 18 islands back?aren ' t you nationalist ? '', 
  he is not saying `` hurra gu git dim bek '' . he is saying why are you ( akp ) talking about how lausanne gave our lands to greeks but not doing anything about those 18 islands ? 
  and tries to show public how untrustworthy and unreliaible akp realy is.trying to potray it something like `` turks want our country1 ! 1 ! 1 ! 1 ! 1 '' is just absurd . 
  note : you can read his speech [ here ] ( https://www.google.com.tr/amp/s/amp.haberturk.com/gundem/haber-amp/1330161-kilicdaroglu-18-adamizda-yunanistan-bayragi-dalgalaniyor?client=ms-android-huawei ), 
   turkish military has been decimated by well over a decade of akp culls and political appointments . 
  even ignoring the disparity between combat experience , personnel and equipment - the turkish armed forces are a house of cards waiting to fall down . 
  you are underestimating the turkish millitary and why would turkey invade syria and why would russia attack turkey ? . russia can just give more weapons to pkk if they want to warn turkey.fighting against a country that has good trade relations with them is stupid without inculuding the fact that russia would have to attack a nato ally and will probably lose billions even without sanctions . 
  wow can someone turn a legal intrevention with foreing support in to an invasion ? 
  erdo\u011fan `` hold my bear '' jokes aside he is making his supporters happy.as some people said erdo\u011fan says stupid things to distract public ( economy is n't doing well ) . 
  armored mercedes . 
  he said why it is important for us and i am not erdo\u011fan buddy . 
  ** translation ** '' ... but saying things like ` these lands will be ours and only we will rule it ' wo n't work.they think they have the upperhand . '', 
  he said `` talks are going for year and because they want us to not to play a role but our soldiers died on the island . '', 
  and said `` i talked with pm tsipras and said we have to solve this issue as quick as we can.we need a solution before 2017 '' edit : this article only published a part of it here his full [ speech ] ( https://www.google.com.tr/amp/m.milliyet.com.tr/amp/cumhurbaskani-erdogan-dan-is-adamla-siyaset-2353160/?client=ms-android-huawei ), 
  turkey always called cyrpus ( excluding north ) southern cyprus rum ( greeks living outside of greece ) goverment . 
  he said `` they ( sc ( cyrpus rebuplic ) ) use a flag that has the whole island in it in meetings but there is trnc in the north you should respect that '' if anyone needs a translation . 
  rum means greeks living outside of greece in turkish.rumlar is pulural of rum ( translates to rums ) . 
  yeah i forgot to mention that thank you . 
   you are probably right , but i was just pointing out that this is very odd that / u/proteus _ enigmaeus keep talking about kurds when kurds probably do n't even listen to that cleric . 
  he is the head of turkish diyanet so he is important for all turkish muslims.a lot of people will care about it inculding kurds but some wo n't . 
   and that we see a lot of turkish propaganda in that sub . 
  always trying to make turkey like a nice secular country and kurds as terrorists . 
  when turkey is actually becoming more and more religious and kurds are actually the only ones fighting isis . 
  there is a lot of anti-turkish news too ( as long as they do n't use false info it is ok ) but this is important because he is head of diyanet ( state controls it ) and he is very powerful because of that.turkey is becoming more secular ( it could have been a lot faster ) but extermism is rising due to refugees and stupid education system.kurds fight isis but many other groups including turkey fights against isis on the ground too . 
   tbh i have no idea why we even see such links in this sub . 
  an imam says something in turkey ... how is that even remotely an european news ? 
  that 's propaganda , plain and simple . 
  that imam is a very powerful state offical and turkey is inculuded in this sub so it is ok to share news like this.it is for propaganda and to educate turkish muslims but i do n't think it is bad or biased ( many turks living in europe goes to diyanet mosques and this makes them less extreme . ), 
   secondly while they might be muslim sunnite for the most part , their religion is very heteregenous and blended with others beliefs , which make them much more progressive than others . 
  like all of turkish people ( people living in turkey.zazas , turks , circassians , kurds ) . not all kurds are backwards but not all of them are secular.it is n't because of their race but because of the backwardness and the poorness of the region they live ( zazas , turks and araps living in centeal , southeastern and eastern turkey are more conservative than others too ) . so please do n't try to change the facts . 
  just because you saw one article about him does n't make him good.erdo\u011fan said a similar thing.this guy is not bad but he is doing nothing against erdo\u011fan 's crimes because it is easier for him ( he declined the car goverment gave him because it costed 1m dollars but erdo\u011fan gifted him another one ) . 
  many people are very strict about rape and normal people want them to punished while extremes want them to be executed.that law was a poorly prepared law to probably avoid scandals or to distract public ( like they did in 2012 ) and people raged about it ( even erdo\u011fan and his daughter ) so they had to back down . 
  wtf are you talking about?those marriges usually happen in rular and poor regions ( some areas in central , eastern and southeastern turkey ) . not every kurd is secularist and not all of them are sharia supporters . 
  in some regions woman are equal but this changes from region to region.so it has nothing to do with what you said . 
  for turkey : there are different claims.one of them says it comes from \u0130talian and means `` belongs to turks '' ( t\u00fcrkiye  t\u00fcrk iye ) . 
  note : some people tried to change the name to t\u00fcrkeli ( hand of turk ) which is turkish but it did n't happen . 
  tukey is more homophobic than western europe for sure but it is probably closer to eastern europe and homosexual acts are different for countries and for cultures . 
  turkey is already building their small arms.this will just increase the support to local producers . 
  i guess turkey hates nato while being in it and have fun finding a non-corrupt country ( i do n't care about the decision but they are expressing it like an idiot ) . 
  yes he did.do some research before accusing someone . 
  for turkey : some religous people : `` selam\u0131n aleyk\u00fcm '' sometimes while putting your hand on your hearth . 
  normal people : `` selam '' or `` merhaba '' with hand shake , hug and if you are greeting someone who is very close to you 2 kisses on the cheeks . 
  ( if you are greeting someone who is older than you kiss his or her hand and put the hand on your forehead ) . 
  in pulic : usually a nod . 
  formal : `` ho\u015fgeldiniz '' `` beyefendi ( for men ) '' `` hanfendi ( for women ) '' or `` say\u0131n '' for both then hand shake . 
  `` bok `` means shit in turkish lol . 
  how?when ? 
  * moon moon prison charges . 
  i read luz as lulz ... 
  buses only stop at bus stops.now buses will stop whenever a women wants it to ( which is a great choice ) . 
  some migrants were send back and refugee wave was stopped.some people in europe tries to potray it like a bad deal for eu but it is not.eu ca n't just cover her ears and scream until the problems go away.some eu countries and eu allies are responsible of this crisis and eu does n't want to be seen as an heartless union that will not accept people who escaped death.on the other hand it was n't a good a deal for turkey and got worse.we still do n't have the money and the still negotiating about visas . 
   well if the camps are that good ( its not how they are portrayed on dutch tv ) erdogan the ball licker , will have trouble sending them into europe , especially during winter . 
  turkish refugee camps are good and even better than most of the world ( because turkey is directly financing them ) but you ca n't house 3 million of them in camps ( nearly half million are in camps ) . thousands of refugees crossed turkey illegally and working in under paid jobs or live in streets . 
   they will soon be able to go back home , erdogans troops are taking large swathes of syria just for them . 
  turkish troops and fsa and no they wo n't . some will return but there are 3 million refugees in turkey and most of them will stay until the war ends ( some will stay even after that ) . 
   i personally think that all money paid into turkey to keep the refugees would be better spent building a city in syria for the refugees , by the refugees and paid for by europe , but of course the eu and us would have to stop feeding the war first . 
  eu paid 300 million dollars to turkey refugees and it was used to provide them food.turkey is trying to build a safe zone in syria and a lot of refugees will return there but even turkey ( isis was shelling turkish cities from syria ) ca n't just send all of their troops to syria because it is a soverign country . 
   still erdogan is getting the billions to build his palaces from somewhere . 
  he is not getting those money from you or europe ( unfortunately he is stealing our money ) . europe supported him and turned blind eye to his actions for a long time . 
  eu is not sending all of them back and that deal was to stop the refugee wave and it mostly worked.eu only send 300 million dollars to refugees in turkey.europe ca n't just say fuck it i am going to send them back to where those people came.those people escaped war and eu is not getting scamed in that refugee deal ( on the other hand turkey is not gaining even losing from that deal ) . 
  i know but does it mean turkey is killing kurds and christians?he probably has 0 knowledge but acts like an expert.he does n't have to like turkey but claims like that are just funny . 
  hmmmm.yep you seem like a professional about turkish-pkk conflict . 
  they skipped erdo\u011fan.he and g\u00fclen were buds since 2013 and most of g\u00fclenist came to their positions because erdo\u011fan let g\u00fclen place them . 
   turkey 's constitutional court in july annulled part of the criminal code which classified all sexual acts with children under 15 as sexual abuse . 
  no they did n't . still all sexual acts under 15 are considered rape and sexual acts between 15-18 are punished upon complaint.they just changed the lenght of punishments if suspect turned himself in . 
  the bill was fortunately pulled back and it was send back and now members of political parties are chaning it to resend it to parliment . 
  people suffered and learned from 2001 . 
  unfortunately because of that now erdo\u011fan is in power.it is a gamble . 
  ok thank you . 
  yeah but unfortunately talks are not going as good as they should.they probably wo n't agree to a plan again : / . 
  ( i thought 15 june would be in ** bold ** but it seems it does n't work for titles shit . ), 
  edit : it was removed and i had to delete it sorry . 
  i knew about the coup and the operation but i never realized both coups happened on the same day.i just wanted to share it since i did n't see any post about it ( purges in turkey after the coup and cyprus talks are happening right now so an interesting information maybe ? ), 
  failed coup in turkey happened on 15 th of june.i just wanted to poin out similarities since both countries are in europe but it seems like i was 4 mounths late ( a little off topic sorry ) . 
  the coup attemp in turkey happened on the same day . 
  for turkey it is 42 . which is very high .

  fucking \u00fclk\u00fcc\u00fcs damaging turkish nationalism again . 
  it could be like german-france alliance it is possible but first turkey needs to get stronger to russia 's level which is not something that could happen in next 35 years . 
  ussr and turkey were allies until ussr demanded land from turkey before ww2 and then turkey got closer to western block . 
  potraying gulen like an innocent man is wrong.he and erdo\u011fan were buddies and purged kemalist until they turned on eachother.erdo\u011fan blames him for a lot of shit but this does n't change the fact that he and his cult damaged turkey with his buddy erdo\u011fan . 
   for a year and a half , erdogan has waged an internal war against his country 's own kurdish population , even though he worked closely with kurds in the first years of his presidency . 
  in this same period , the u.s. has started to arm and train members of syria 's secular kurdish opposition .
