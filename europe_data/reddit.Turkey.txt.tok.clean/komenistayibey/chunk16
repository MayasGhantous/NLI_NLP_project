  it is not about being bright but not having to worry about getting arrested.akp people usually like akp for many things so they do n't see their mistakes and act like they did n't happen while people who dislike akp already report/sue him but he rarely gets punished .

  erdo\u011fan and his party gets away by saying `` we were tricked '' after commiting a crime . 
  this law was put there by conservative menderes goverment about 10-15 years after atat\u00fcrk 's death.it is stupid but a normal person usually gets a similar sentece.afaik insulting someone in turkey is not a crime but doing it publicly and letting people know it ( like sharing it on social media like this guy did ) is a crime . 
  few guys got sentenced 2-3 years or had to pay money ( erdo\u011fan is n't suing everyone but he is suing a single person or few people hard to make people know that he can ) . 
  [ here is an article including a map ] ( https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/06/china-new-silk-road-explainer/ ), 
  do i write stuff like `` yeah greece is losing someth\u0130ng woho '' ? not liking a country does n't mean cheering for what you think damages it ( which this guy is doing ) is right.i just listed reasons why bosporus have importance and why his thinking is wrong . 
   despite this the ottoman armies far outnumbered the numbers the greeks raised to revolt . 
  main ottoman army was destroyed before the revolt and they paid albanian mercinaries money to fight at start . 
   and they did n't `` ask '' muhammad ali for help . 
  they bought his help with promises of land and territory . 
  asking for help while promising to give something is still asking for help . 
   this is not about the land route , but the maritime route  china will create a waterway linking the mediterranean sea via the axios river in thessaloniki , to the danube and the existing river transport network in europe and the black sea . 
  and i saw that.if you read what i wrote you could have seen that china is already investing in similar turkish projects and bosporus have other importances so your claim of `` it will makw bosporus useless '' is just your wishful thinking . 
  yeah kinda.i do n't know if they arrested someone for that but they used it as evindence.the worst part is these things make foreigners say `` wtf?gulen 's organization is not real then '' but it is real ( they were also working with akp but somehow erdo\u011fan and other akp members got free because they said `` they tricked us.please forgive us '' ... ) and actions like this only harm those who got hurt because of them . 
   please . 
  please . 
  please . 
  this kind of project should have been done long ago . 
  take away the importance of the bosporus i do n't know if the way you act is sad or funny . 
  - the land route directly passes from bosporus and turkey ( actually turkey is one of the first countries china invested as part of this project ) - this does n't mean trade around bosporus and istanbul will decrease since it is an important port especially for china which is a big economic partner for turkey and turkish-chinese trading is getting bigger.also turkey is preparing to buil a canal to connect black sea to marmara only for cargo ships and china is showing interest to join the project . 
  - bosporus is n't only about trade and its main importance come from its position . 
  sorry for killing your bonner :(, 
   i will let the greek thinker nikephoros speak : it would be nice if you shared his next sentence starting with `` turkish bandit state '' . i really do n't understand why you hate turkey this much to only share this stuff on many sub reddits and return with different accounts when you get banned . 
   many western pundits , and media hacks often present kemalism as a positive force , however it is an ideology referenced from islam and that never morphed much from those origins . 
  in a context more familiar to westerners it strongly resembles fascism or the ridiculous juche idea of now deceased dictator of north korea , kim jong il . 
   introduction to turkish constitution which is defining the official ideology of north korea of middle east :  https://global.tbmm.gov.tr/docs/constitution_en.pdf  _ affirming the eternal existence of the turkish motherland and nation and the indivisible unity of the sublime turkish state , ** this constitution , in line with the concept of nationalism introduced by the founder of the republic of turkey , atat\u00fcrk , the immortal leader and the unrivalled hero , and his reforms and principles ** _ and?do you really think people who do n't agree with atat\u00fcrk get executed or punished ? 
  people love him because of his reforms and him saving the country.saying things like `` lul y turks luv him '' is idiotic ( it is really easy to understand why turks love him ) since even the islamist crowd ( including the sultan who did n't want people around him to talk shit about him ) supported him during the war . 
  atat\u00fcrk is far from perfect but he is the best leader of turkish republic on many degrees and far better than his competators.most of the abuse of atat\u00fcrk 's name started happening after 1980 coup ( that abuse countiues to a degree but not much ) but calling it a cult is far from true . 
   this is changing slightly in the present as the success of the islamic oriented akp party has allowed them to route out the traditional kemalist deep state , media and other organs and replace it with their plants . 
  however , they just want those who are more oriented into sunni islamic bigotry to control the state ideology , not abandon it or reform . 
  ^ [ [ + ] ] ( http://koreaofmideast.blogspot.com.tr/2013/09/kemalism-legal-and-media-engineering-to.html ) `` traditional kemalist deep state '' lol what?deep state in turkey was ultra nationalist who were extermist mhp supporters who loved ottoman empire and avoided talking about atat\u00fcrk but of course every one he dislikes is `` fasicst kemalist '' so he must be right ... also the article you shared starts with this ffs `` turks with very few exceptions are proud ultra-nationalist lunatics . 
  their state is structured by their war criminal military regime '' and includes things like '' turks are fanatic nationalists '' . do you really think this is coming from a guy ( clearly a fucking racists ) who is being objective ? 
  edit : typo, 
  it does n't . fanaticly loving a party is not being interigated but voting in the elections is n't . they are turkish citizens and usually visit turkey.they also have their relatives there and they have to do certian things because they are turkish citizen ( conscription.they usually pay and do n't do it but some do ) so them voting makes sense . 
   so we could say about 35-40 % are integrated . 
  not voting does n't mean interigating and voting does n't mean not interigates  that 's pretty bad , especially because most of them have been here a long time . 
  ( there 's not much migration from turkey anymore , i believe it 's even negative , more turks leaving than coming to nl ) afaik some of them return to turkey after saving money there.the turkish workers who came to europe did n't interigate well due to mistakes they , german and turkish goverments made . 
   they were infinitely better off than the greek rebels . 
  yeah but ottomans were also having a lot of problems . 
   it 's not , the sultan had the power to conscript huge trained armies and greek farmers had a couple of small knifes and rifles . 
  nowhere did so few fight against so many . 
  maybe except 1453 and 480bc . 
  sultan also destroyed jannisary corps.conscripting and brining men to that area was close to impossible due to bad ottoman supply lines ( that is why they asked for mehmed alis help ) . ottomana did n't have enough men , money , weapon to suprass that big revolt . 
   edit2 : according to [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_the_ottoman_empire ) ottoman empire in 1831 had 27 million people . 
  it is an other estimate.as i said offical number is only for anatolia and rumeli eyalets and many estimates say 20-25 million . 
   http://koreaofmideast.blogspot.com.tr/2013/08/kemalism-fascist-turkish-state-religion.html  what the backward turkish nation great start ...  brainwashed turks kissing the marble at an\u0131tkabir , the memorial tomb of the immortal dictator of the turkish nation , mustafa kemal atat\u00fcrk this is getting funnier.atat\u00fcrk is the guy that saved and modernized the country if you do n't understand why people love him you do n't need to write stuff about turkey . 
   note : 2007 was the year of the so called `` republic protests '' in turkey , where millions of the more fascist fake secular kemalist turks calling people facist and fake secularist just because you do n't like them is a great thing to do . 
  sorry mate but your favourite has serious problems and seems like is obssed with turkey ( considering what you write on reddit it does n't suprise me )  [ stop defending turkey 's ` secularism ' -- it 's been a lie all along ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/fraderike-geerdink-/turkey-secularism_b_9818250.html )  by fr\u00e9derike geerdink she is the person who defended pkk 's murder of a teacher by saying `` he might be a spy '' . she was also praising erdo\u011fan few years ago.a great journalist indeed ...  _ ** the interesting fact is that the akp did n't have to alter the foundations of the state to shape turkey to its current form . 
  in fact , the akp has not touched the secular basis of the republic in any way . 
  ** instead , it used existing structures to give religion a greater role in society . _  _ ** one of the key institutions that is at the akp 's disposal is diyanet , the directorate for religious affairs . 
  it was once installed by ataturk to control the influence of religion . 
  if you define secularism as the separation of state and religion , which is the most common definition , turkey is n't secular at all . 
  ** from the early years of the republic , state and mosque have been closely intertwined . 
  all mosques are state-owned , all imams are state-employed and for decades , the friday sermons were centrally written and distributed . _ this is what happens when you think all of the world as a single country.she does n't know much about turkish society so she is asking `` why is state controlling who talks about religion ? '', 
  but she fails to realize that secularist movements in turkey has been doing it for the last 200 years and it is the most sucessful way of doing it.extermist gaining power in muslim countries happen because they enter mosques and do propaganda.have she ever asked herself `` why hundreds of jihadist from europe joined isis ? 
  '' ? probably not.not letting other people open mosques and do propaganda does n't mean you ca n't be secularist.it is the best way of doing it since countries like saudi arabia open mosques to do propaganda abroad.state providing religous services and stopping extermism is not against secularism . 
  edit : typo, 
  no , he is the `` kick turkey out reeeee '' guy . 
  turks love to vote.our turnout is usually 80-85 %, 
   largest empire in eurasia excluding the russians but `` ready to collapse '' . 
  china was also one of the largest states in asia in 1800s and first half of 1900s but this does n't change the fact that they were in a very bad positions and was n't able to defend themselves and were getting fucked by western countries.ottomans were in a better position but not that better ( they did n't have enough power to controll and rellied heavly on support from other countries.western europeans did n't want russians increase her influence in ottoman areas so they supported ottomans to counter them ) . 
   what difference does it make if it 's 25 or 30 millions ? 
  i did n't look to a census . 
  differenence between 20-25 ( majority of which are in europe or in africa and do n't give a fuck about ottomans ) and 30 is very big . 
   only border regions and to a very limited degree , the ottoman lands were more or less the same between 1700 and 1821 . 
  ottomans were already ready to collapse and far behind western powers that time . 
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_population_in_1900 ** list of countries by population in 1900 ** ottoman male population in 1831 census was 4 male million for anatolia and rumeli eyalet ( so male-female about 8 million ) . some sources estimate that population was about 20-25 million in all of the area they controll . 
   that signaled a century of military defeats and humiliations for the turks . 
  turkish retreat in europe started about 150 years before that.i do n't really understand where you got that idea . 
   it was the first time in history a place of 600k people broke away from an empire of 30 million . 
  - ottomans did n't have 30 million population . 
  - similar things also happened before that .

   the acts against leftwing movements in turkey pre fall of the soviet union , however arguably damaging to turkey , are understandable in the context of the cold war . 
  turkey falling into the hands of the soviet union would 've been the last thing the west would 've liked to see . 
  problem is those leftwings people ( atleast those who came to power and had chance to come to power ) did n't want to leave the alliance.they just wanted more for turkish people and a less dependent turkeu.people were looking for new leaders in 60s-70s which led to charismatic leftwings gaining popularity but they got baddly effected due to ambargo and the coup really damaged the leftwing and made liberal conservatives rose to power ( rising to power in this context means having all your opponents being thrown into jail or being banned from doing politics so litterally being gifted the goverment ) . their mistakes and stupid economic policies also caused many economic crises and some of them happened when leftwing parties were in power which made it even worse for them . 
  another important thing is usa 's plan kinda backfired.nearly all politicians are ready to work with usa but only few trusts them and nearly all people from all political specturms have problems with usa.ambargoes also made turkey realize how economicly fragile country actually was and was a turning point for the country.ambargoes caused turkey to build its own defence industry and it also caused turkish industry to rise and goverment sometimes put special taxes on foreign goods to make it easier for turkish goods to compete with the foreign ones and it worked greatly ( what happened to iran and iraq actually shows how smart and good this decisions was ) . 
  tl ; dr : it would have been better if usa and western bloc tried to work with turkish leftwings instead of supporting conservatives and making more people dislike usa . 
   in a * supposedly * post-cold war world , what do you think could be a solution for turkey so it moves forward and embraces modern democratic values , if any ? 
  ( ignoring the problem of erdogan for a moment ) . 
  i think chp ( current one has some problems but it is more pro-minority than ever and most of it nationalistic statements are made to counter akp so they would n't create stupid political crises like akp to increase their popularity ) or sdp ( turkish social democrat party ) like party or a liberal party in goverment + economic advisiors like kemal dervi\u015f and akp 's ones ( akp 's economic sucess is what made them stay in power.their economic leaders are pretty good people and many of them are selfmade mens who do n't talk much about politics so they would be ok to work with other parties ) + more reforms made with eu ( if we get help we solve our problems a lot quicker.eu reforms greatly helped turkish economy ) would make turkey more democratic and stronger . 
  also more cooperation with turkic countries ( if karabagh war did n't happen and turkey acted smarter when it comes to support which group more pro-turkic leaders would be in power in turkic countries ) and with our neighbours ( all of them ) and more investment in africa.we are already investing a lot to africa ( we actually have a base in somalia and train somali military officers in turkey ) but our `` smart '' akp made propaganda for gulen and helped him open schools in africa instead of opening themselves so now all those schools are gone and new ones have to be open ... these decisions would have made region better/richer and more secure and would have increased turkey 's growth rate . 
  more realisticly akp-chp coalition or chp-meral ak\u015fener 's party ( or mhp without bah\u00e7eli ) coalition would be good enough to make turkey more democratic while making economy stronger ( i am mentioning economy a lot because it is the most important key to sucess so a democrstic turkey also needs to be economicly strong ) and making people happy ( what keeps akp in power is akp 's economic sucess and the failure of the opposition . 
  tl ; dr : a leftwings party like chp or a liberal party or a coalition who works with all of our neighbours and turkic countries and keeps economy strong and gets help from eu for reforms . 
  edit : typo ( sorry i am on my phone ), 
  `` i do n't have any argument so let me make `` clever '' jokes '' the coups caused parties like akp to gain power because people like kenan evren directly supported islamists to counter leftist.the coups also caused pkk to gain power and made then gain many new members ( the prisons were called `` pkk recruitment centres '' since people who go in there usually hated turkey when they came out and directly joined pkk ) . 
  also the coup and the us ambargo really damaged the leftwing and socialists and helped islamist and conservative parties like anap rose ( these parties also cared less about the counstitution ) . 
   i 'd go as far to say that turkey needed the occasional coup it seems like you do n't know much about turkish history.those coups caused parties like akp to gain power . 
  nah it is not delusional ( no one would say something like `` it wo n't happen let 's stop '' ) . both sides know turkey wo n't be able to join even if all problems get solved but want to countiue the talks because it benefits both sides . 
  it seems like main topic of the meeting will be [ tanap ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trans-anatolian_gas_pipeline ) project . 
   well for turks it is but defending yourself and families against a genocidal , imperialist turkey is reason enough for greeks to fight when the time comes , and as usual greeks will be on the right side of history fighting for justice , liberty and freedom `` genocidal '' , `` imperialists '' lol.can you please explain to me what those it has to do with what i say without saying shit like that?a war did n't happen in 90s ( which was 10 times more likely to happen compared to now ) and it wo n't happen now.even if tensions rise ( and it will probably never rise that much ) usa and eu would stop it and both countries would have to obey it . 
   til wars ca n't happen cause `` it 's the current year '' years are n't just numbers.things changed a lot since than and reasons for fight is even less now . 
   we will see yeah . 
   you can fool ignorant westerners who know nothing of turkey on this subreddit . 
  but i know better lol what?you do realize we are in 21st century right?a war did n't happen in 90s thanks to usa and now we have usa and eu to stop it and both countries have other problems to deal with.nothing will probably happen other than usual throwing shit at each other and border violetions . 
   great to know other eu members are cooperating with turkey on their missile system they will use when they launch their aegean war against greece . 
  turkey , france and italy are all nato members and did similar projects with each other in the past.this one is done for missle defense systems which turkey needs.there is nothing wrong with this deal .
