  and some settled in erzincan but i have n't seen anything about bitlis . 
   over 5 million kurds live in istanbul alone ... that is just a lie.there are 2-3 million kurds in istanbul ( including the assimilated ones ) . 
   they want to erase the region 's kurdish history . 
  not only by strategically placing new turks , but also by destroying the kurdish heritage . 
  the turkish government has , for example , built many dams which have submerged historical kurdish and armenian sites . 
  hasankeyf will be submerged later next year , or in 2019 at the latest . 
  just like they destroyed over 2,000 armenian churches , they plan to erase the kurdish history and heritage as well . 
  turkish government has destroyed a lot more turkish historic sites than kurdish sites ( about 50 mosques only in istanbul in 10 years were destroyed to make roads ) . 
  the goverment is n't building that dam to destroy kurdish sites but to improve life standarts and produce electricy.it is n't a great thing but it has to be done.claiming this is only happening to kurds is not true . 
   turkey 's policies of keeping the kurdish regions impoverished and underdeveloped have backfired . 
  the kurdish regions are underdeveloped compared to other regions because of the turkish-pkk conflict and western turkey beign more developed since 1100s . the goverments invested to western turkey because of vote potential but realized the vote potential in 1970s and started investing there.the gap project is all about that ( which you hate and claim are only to damage kurds ) . 
   the birthrate is even higher in the `` patriotic '' kurdish regions ( the provinces of urfa , diyarbakir , mardin , and a few others have an average of + / - 5 children per family ) . 
  what?the birthrates in urfa is 4 ( urfa is a very conservative town and half of it ( 50-60 % excluding refugees ) is kurdish.calling it a patriotic kurdish city is just funny ) and 3 in diyarbak\u0131r.also half of the kurds are living in the western turkey and the birth rates in kurdish region are falling fast due to improving life standarts and more and more kurds are getting assimilated because of mixed marriages etc. 
  you are claiming the same thing again and again and espace when i comment to you . 
   turkish families in inner anatolia ( erdogan 's core base ) barely hit replacement level , while turkish families in the west of the country are below it ( some regions even below western birth rates ) . 
  no they do n't . the inner anatolia has nearly as same birth rate as south eastern turkey ( 2,5-3 in central anatolia 3-3 ,5 in south eastern anatolia ) . 
   i remember a speech in which erdogan himself warns of the `` dangers ahead '' , expecting kurdish majority 2035-2040 . 
  no you do n't because it did n't happen.the 2035-2040 is the year where the population of turkey will reach its cap ( probably around 100 million ) . 
   kurdish population is also the youngest in the country . 
  no they are n't . syrian population is the youngest . 
   after all , chp voted for lifting immunity of hdp . 
  chp voted to lift immunity for all pms not for hdp and they did that because 1-it was going to pass without chp 's vote 2-they wanted to show that they have nothing to hide, 
  i am not really sure about the raki and uzo part but putting flag part is mostly true ( they did similar things during imla crisis ) . before the invasion of cyprus greek cypriots sang turkish songs to mock turks ( turkey warned cyprus many times and sometimes prepared for an invasion but never did.when turks again warned and said we will invade in 1974 they thought it was one of them and sang `` bekledimde gelmedin in turkish '' on radio to mock them.during the invasion turkish radios played bir gece ans\u0131z\u0131n gelebilirim ( i might suddenly come in a night ) turkish soldiers danced , traded cigarattes , water , food with anzac and brits in \u00c7anakkale but i am not sure if that happened during greeco-turkish wars . 
  edit : i accidently deleted the translations before posting it . 
  `` bekledimde gelmedin '' means `` i waited for you but you did n't come '' in turkish [ here is a greek singer stelios kazantzidis singing that song ] ( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xird8d_stelios-kazantzidis-bekledim-de-gelmedin_music ) . 
  it crashed to sea it was n't shot down by turks . 
   ask greece , they were attacked by turkey who subsequently shot down their helicopter killing all crew . 
  when ? 
  ( during the imla crisis a greek helicopter crashed.it was n't shot down ), 
  azerbaijan too ( but they deleted nax\u00e7\u0131van ) * cries in turkic *, 
  no the support for sharia in turkey is 13 % ( and half of them say it should n't be forced to non-muslims ) . 
   the soviet supply of gold and armaments to the kemalists in 1920 -- 1922 was a key factor in the latter 's successful grab of power in an ottoman empire defeated by the triple entente and their victory in the armenian campaign and the greco-turkish war ( 1919 -- 1922 ) . 
  that supply came from turkistan ( from modern day uzbekistan.which was part of the ussr ) . 
  soviets took a huge part of it and delivered some as weapons ( soviets also needed that money as much as turkey so you ca n't blame them ) . 
   the french troops did n't really fight as they were fine with control of syria and when things settled they also gave the kemalists weapons . 
  antep lost 1/3 of its population in the fight and every single city heavly resisted to french occupation which caused french to make a deal with the turks ( antep was awarded the title gazi ( given to peope who fought for their country and got wounded in the fight ) , atat\u00fcrk himself praised the peope of antep and officaly he is from gaziantep ) . 
   ali \u015e\u00fckr\u00fc is one . 
  he got assasinated and his killer was executed ( they actually behaded his assasin buried him then took him out of his grave and hanged him from his feet because of the promise they made then reburied him ) . 
   then is the banning of progressive republican party . 
  although not killed , he nevertheless silenced any opposition much like how you accuse ocalan . 
  truth be told , in moments of crisis the most capable one must seize the opportunity . 
  first of all kemal did that because of the revolts that started in the east . 
  opposition parties during those years usually got infested by sharia supporters because of the lack of a opposition party ( it is still not a good thing ) . 
   what i also find weird is the fact that you accuse ocalan of destroying turkish communist influence on the kurds yet kemal had done the same kemal was n't a communist ( he was closer to todays social democrats but more nationalist ) while ocalan was . 
  turkish-ussr relations were one of the reasons why turkish communism took so long to be a big movement.the ussr 's help during the indipendence war really boosted support and after the october revolution turkic people got a lot of rights like a lot of soviet people ( which also boosted support in turkey ) but purges in muslim foundations and turkic parties ( like turkistan communists party ) , the unsatisfying results from congress of the peoples of the east ( and turks were the largest group in the congress ) , redrawing of borders of turkistan and other turkic countries , soviet 's land demands from turkey and espically purges , deportations during the ww2 destroyed the support for communism ( so stalin basically f.cked it like he did with many things.the communism rose again in 60s because of america 's ambitions and because of the new and much better 1960 constitution but even than the turk ish left did n't wanted to be very close to ussr.groups like pkk also rised during these years ( 60s-70s ) ) . 
   i ca n't find anything about them , i want a english source . 
  most people ( even their friends ) do n't talk about it to not to damage kurdish movements . 
  [ i can share some sites and you can use google translate . 
  ] ( https://burakeklik.wordpress.com/2012/11/10/pkknin-12-eylul-oncesi-oldurdugu-devrimciler/ )  i 'm sure ocalan had his reasons too . 
  he wanted to destroy his competators  besides many of the turks kemal killed were not sharia supporters but generals and soldiers of his own army . 
  which ones ? 
   being a terrorist or not changes according to the foreign interests of said country . 
  kemalist saved that country and most of those turks they killed were hardcore sharia supporters which rebelled against the state . 
  anf is a very biased site with a biased history.it is n't about op 's opinion it is about the anf . 
   i never read anf before , please do n't . it is worse than yeni \u015eafak and sabah  but from a cursory reading , their report seemed a little biased , but then the same is probably true of akp supporting publications . 
  anyways , the essence of the report seems to be accurate . 
  pro-akp publications are also false.all we know is an old woman got stabbed by akp supporters ( which is very bad ) more than this are just claims ( and probably false considering anf 's history.the title is an example ) . 
  he is also the leader of an militant group that is considered as terrorist group in germany . 
  also the group he led ( pkk ) killed , destroyed other leftist anti-goverment kurdish groups and assasinated the members of anti-goverment pro-kurdish turkish leftist groups to have a monopoly over the kurds.thanks to this only other active anti-goverment kurdish group is hizbullah ( the turkish one is different than the other one ) which is an islamist extremist group ( he literally killed all of his competators and pkk countiue killing kurds which they see as `` traitors '' ) . 
   i must have missed something , how is g\u00fclen so controversial ? 
  i know erdogan blames him for the failed coup , but i do n't think he ever presented any evidence ? 
  apart from that g\u00fclen has had a pretty good track record . 
  a huge part of western media shows him as an angle because of the purges but he is not.he worked with erdo\u011fan ( when he was working with erdo\u011fan western media was also praising erdo\u011fan and his modarate islam ) , his people stole exam answers , he placed his men in state institues in many countries , he jailed and purged innocent secularist soldiers and innocent academics because they opposed him few of them : kudissi okk\u0131r was a bussinesman.he got jailed by gulenist and was put in turkish f-type prisons ( one of the worst in the world ) he died because of cancer after beign jailed [ here ] ( https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:and9gcto1ogfj_ijix9fjgszpfpzwy_jqv_s0g5oeqmfivzrelrn1-t6gq ) ali tatar was a lieutenant colonel in turkish armed forces . gulenist accused him of plotting against his country arrested and released him.when they tried to arrest him again he killed himself before they arrived . 
  there are vidoes of gulen preaching his supporters.he literally says `` infiltrate state institues and wait for right moment to attack '' ( these videos leaked in 90s ) . 
  russia closed down gulen 's schools in 2014 and he escaped to usa in 1997 when army forced a conservative goverment to resign.he is not an angle or a moderate preacher.he is a criminal and a religous nutjob who shows himself as a god 's gift.we are fighting against people like him since the first day turkey was founded . they tell tails of how they made atat\u00fcrk sweat by talking with him but in reality those people would have sweat to death if they saw him in real life ( atat\u00fcrk executed dozends of people like them.atat\u00fcrk once said `` turkish republic is not the country of cults , sheiks and dervishes.the true guidance is the civilization itself '' . gulen is just one of those sheiks and like every other sheik and cult his one should be destroyed ( unfortunately akp is trying to replace them with new cults ) ) . 
  merkel goverment forbidden all of pkk related symbols not kurdish symbols ( like potrait of \u00d6calan pkk 's leader and the flag pkk which is considered as a terrorist organization by germany ) . 
   it came out yesterday that the akp mob was organised and led by a turkish citizen by the name of mehmet garg\u0131l\u0131 , a close man of turkish president recep tayyip erdo\u011fan . 
   time to ban the akp terrorists from europe . 
  mehmet garg\u0131l\u0131 is an akp fanboy not a close man of turkish president ( you can see it in his twitter profile search his name in google ) . the fact that many people are beliving anf is just sad . 
  well they invaded them through eu ( many eu related buildings are in belgium ) so it counts . 
  i hate pkk but attacking to someone ( espically if she is an old woman ) is wrong.some say there was a fight and people from both sides got wounded ( i also do n't like erdo\u011fan supporters and know they might attack old people so i am not sure ) . 
  anf is very biased.nearly every single one of their news are either misleading or false ( in the past they targetted turkish citizens who were from other turkic countries ) so we are not sure about how it happened but we know she got wounded . 
  i agree that members should increase their spending but saying estonia and greece can do it so can germany is wrong .2 % of germanys gdp is about 70billion dollars which is 1/3 of the gdp of greece + estonia . 
  maintaining large armies costs a lot.for example greece has 180k active +280 k reserve soldiers and 1500 tanks , while germany has 180k active +145 k reserve soldiers and 500 tanks . 
   what is the difference ? 
  a huge part of greek spendings goes to maintaining that army ( feeding soldiers , repairing weapons , maintaining equipment , paying their wages etc. ), 
  and they buy their equipment from other countries.so even if greece keeps its spendings minimum the % will be a lot higher compared to germany 's % due to difference in the size of their economies and number of soldiers . 
  turkstat updated how it calculated the growth by making few changes ( for example re-de spendings and military research spendings were counted as spendings now they put those in to the investment category ) . the real problem was them taking the base as 2009 but even than the difference is n't that big ( the difference between old and new method is probably about 1 % in this quarter which is not that much and probably nearly all of it comes from counting millitary research and re-de spendings as investment and from the usual updates ( the previous years growth in the same quarter was about 1,8 % -2 % ) ( insome years the growth in the new method seems actually lower than before ) ) . 
  turkey is a fast growing country and will countiue to be one.growth could have been 6 % or 8 % if tayyip made his moves right but instead he made huge mistakes and created artifical problems with neighbors which caused economic growth to slowdown.average growth of turkey is about 4,6 % ( 5,6 % if you exclude ww2 era and potential is about 7 % . if you consider the fact that turkey had 3 coups ( including the 1971 ) ,3 coup attempts , a coup kinda thing ( febuary 28 ) ,2 military interventions ( cyprus and syria.cyprus costed turkey around 50 billion dollars ) , many incompetent leaders , conflict or civil war or revolution in nearly every single one of her neighbors and finally 40 year conflict with pkk ( which costed turkey about 700 billion dollars ) these numbers are impresive and show that turkey will countiue to grow very fast unless peoppe like tayyip slow it down so this number is good but not very suprising and show how bad political decisions are effecting turkey and damaging the economy ) . 
  thanks for the info . 
   shi'ia and sunni muslims hate the living fuck out of each other it depends on the country . 
  majority of the turkic world is sunni but do n't have problems with shia turks and majority shia turkic countries . 
  it is an example.giving education does n't make them good . 
   the g\u00fclen movement promotes a moderate version of islam with a heavy emphasis on public service . 
  those guys stole exam answers , jailed and purged innocent people , gulen said `` sneak into state institues and wait for right moment to attack '' etc. 
  but ofcourse erdo\u011fan targetted them so he must be a good guy acording to them ( they probably do n't know he worked with erdo\u011fan ) ...  the movement runs schools and universities in 180 countries isis also gives biology and anotomy lessons with special text books does it make them good ? 
  edit : to people who are downvoting this a 5 min search in google can help you get more answers key words are : who stole the exam answers in kpss 2010 ? 
  who purged secularist from the army and jailed innocent people in ergenekon and sledgehammer ? 
  whose movement grew due to help from erdo\u011fan ? 
  leader in turkish ( like leader of a family etc. ), 
  nudism ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
   with language reform ** many old turkic words ** were brought back and ** nationalims was on the rise among turkic ** people during that time . 
  ** ofcourse it is n't probably about that ** as i said it is n't about that but nationalism and return to roots were very popular in the world back them and it also effected turkey ( many old turkic symbols were also brought back ) . my comment was mostly about it not being that much of an irony ( it is n't also about arabic script because even ottoman propaganda posters were left or central leaning ( the important things were on the left or at the centre ) probably she is pointing the west ), 
  with language reform many old turkic words were brought back and nationalims was on the rise among turkic people during that time.ofcourse it is n't probably about that ( she pointing to west as other users suggested makes the most sense ) but the irony here does n't really much make sense because that thing was part of the original turkic culture which effected atat\u00fcrk 's policies . 
  [ old-turkic script was written from right to left ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/old_turkic_alphabet#/media/file%3abilge_khagan_inscription_lines_36-40_in_original_old_turkic_script.svg ), 
   what i wonder : did the turkish population switch to secularism during the time of atat\u00fcrk , and now back again , or was that just a phenomenon of government and the urban elites , and most of the population stayed the same all throughout ? 
  secularism efforts are a lot older than ataturk.with young turks and tanzimat state started to become more and more modern but most of it stayed exclusive to elite.after the 1908 revolution some of those changes also effected normal folk but not very much . 
  after the republic was founded atat\u00fcrk started to reform the country and he managed to reform the people too.some of his changes were radical at the time so they backfired or created a lot of radicals but most of his reforms were successful.atat\u00fcrk reforms made public more secular and proggresive and new generations are becoming more and more secular despite conservative goverments thanka to him .
