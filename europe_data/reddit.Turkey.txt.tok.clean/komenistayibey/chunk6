  and probably an asshole reported him to look cute to the goverment ( we also listen to kurdish music in our school without any problem ) . 
   i was very disappointed to see that the liberal turks at that subreddit are as backwards as akp supporters regarding minority rights . 
  akp supporters do n't care about anyones right it does n't have anything to do with minorties ( they care about votes that is why they gave kurds many rights ) . few years ago pm was going around and telling people how happy he feels when someone calls him `` biji serok ahmet ( long live ahmet in kurdish ) '' and some people got arrested for saluting erdo\u011fan with the grey wolf sign while new pm does it to get nationalist votes .

  in turkey they are called `` asteriks ve oburiks '' ( which means asterx and fattyx ), 
  both dubbed and subbed.actually dubs are usually great and they are as good as the original one . 
   first of all i can write enough about how wrong it is to compare percentages of the early 20th century with percentages of the early 21st century . 
  i hope you understand that too . 
  i understand but turkey under atat\u00fcrk faced a lot of economic challenges but despite those things growth under his rule was pretty good you are forgeting the fact that turkey also had to pay debts etc. 
  and the global economic crisis . 
  turkey 's growth under atat\u00fcrk 1923 : i do n't have statistics for it but the agricultural products returned to 80 % -90 % of 1914 level 1924:14,5 % 1925:12,5 % 1926:18,2 % 1927 : -12 % 1928:10,8 % 1929:21,5 % 1930:2,5 % 1931:8,2 % 1932 : -10,6 % 1933:15,5 % 1934:6,3 % 1935 : -3 % 1936:23,1 % 1937:1,5 % 1938:9,5 % and as i said he founded those modern instutions and replaced the old ones unlike erdo\u011fan who did n't do these things . 
  you are forgeting the fact that turkey also had to pay debts etc.

  turkey 's growth under atat\u00fcrk 1923 : i do n't have statistics for it but the agricultural products returned to 80 % -90 % of 1914 level 1924:14,5 % 1925:12,5 % 1926:18,2 % 1927 : -12 % 1928:10,8 % 1929:21,5 % 1930:2,5 % 1931:8,2 % 1932 : -10,6 % 1933:15,5 % 1934:6,3 % 1935 : -3 % 1936:23,1 % 1937:1,5 % 1938:9,5 %, 
  yep you are right.i think the real number is around 35 % for now ( it will probably drop soon ) . 
  nearly all of turks live in cities but some cities are very bad and does n't have cultural activities . 
  til we actually have one of those sites and it is called [ box office t\u00fcrkiye ] ( https://boxofficeturkiye.com ) ( seyirci means audience has\u0131lat means box office ) . 
  it seems like number of audience is increasing quickly . 
  edit : it seems like highest watched film is watched by 8 million and highest watched foreign movie is a fast and furious 7 with 3 million . 
  those are excluded.that number is higher than it normally is but most of them are 60-70 year olds that never had a good education and were forced to work in their parents jobs ( now this does n't happen.every turks has to finish highshool.some parents still wants their children to learn jobs from people like mechanichs so goverment also opened new schools for them.now they get licences and only learn how to be mechanics etc. 
   erdogan almost [ doubled the purchasing power ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/turkey/gdp-per-capita-ppp ) of the turks . 
  what does it have to do with instutions?also turkey under atat\u00fcrk grew 8-10 % a year while the number under erdo\u011fan is % 4,6 in a year . 
   so liberal of him eh ? 
  i never claimed atat\u00fcrk was liberal enough but considering his rivals ( aka hardcore communist , shaira supporters or hardcore nationalist ) he was the best one . 
   so did stalin ? 
  should i praise that murderer too ? 
  i am meskhetian turk and we were kicked out of our home ( which was n't talked with greece like pontic greeks and most of us died during the journey unlike them ) during his regime but this does n't mean i will scrap every good thing he did.his modernization policies helped ussr on many degrees ( his f.cking moronic decisions also damaged the ussr and f.cked the revolution but this does n't make goos things he did disapper.same things goes eith atat\u00fcrk he was mostly a great man but made very stupid mistakes ) . 
   talking institutions erdogan strengthened turkey too . 
  modernizing a country ca n't stand as a factor of greatness alone . 
  which ones?ataturk founded and replaced the old instutions with new and modern ones . 
  also you claimed he was n't progresive but modernizing a country counts as beign progresive . 
   the fact that ataturk was brutal against pontic * ottoman * greeks or other minorities is often forgotten . 
  ataturk was n't brutal against greeks ( his treatments was harsh but most of killings were done by muslim militants active in the area ) the whole turkish revolutionaries was ( like how greeks were brutal against turkish , muslims in their terretory and it was n't only against pontic greeks ) and pontic greeks went to greece during thr population exhange ( greece also wanted the population exhange ) . 
  also atat\u00fcrk was harsh against everyone who stood in his way.some majority turkish cities got investment and aid ban for 90 years because they rebelled against the goverment.for example menemen provice wanted sharia and rebelled against the goverment.they behaded the officers in the province and after atat\u00fcrk learn about this he order soldiers to burn down the whole province but he quickly changed his idea and said `` do n't listen to what i say during these kind of situations ( rebelliouns ) '' ( those who rebelled was turks and their leader was a cretan turk called dervi\u015f mehmet.they were executed and got jailed ) . 
   praising erdogan because he modernized aspects of the country is as stupid as greeks saying that dictator papadopoulos was such a great leader because he renewed our infrastructure and built roads and had a booming economy . 
  atat\u00fcrk not only modernized the country.as i said he also secularized , industralized it.he also fought in ww1 and turkish indipendence war and is seen as a hero . 
   yea because ataturk was such a progressive leader ... 
  yes he was.his policies industrialized , secularized and modernized the turkish society . 
   you should read [ this ] ( http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674368378 ) . 
  and you should also read about his dealings with the upcoming soviets . 
  nationalist and totalitarian regimes were fascinated about the t\u00fcrkle\u015ftirme as it is called in turkey . 
  both turkey and germany was forced to sign stupid agreements after the ww1 but turks fought against it and forced allies to a new agreement while germans did n't and looked for someone who did ( ataturk himself order jewish scients to be accepted into turkey when some escaped from germany ) soviets was our ally and one of our biggest supporter in the war so we had great relations with them.ataturk wanted to create an economy that was a mash between socialism and capitalism.also considering the fact that nearly all of the world was either totalitarian or nationalist it is hard to not work with them  secularism alone is not enough to transfor a society . 
  yeah that is why he did n't only use secularism . 
  this is higher than it normally is but not that much.young generation usually goes to cinema but that % is a lot less in old generation.also a lot of people watch movies on tv and internet but do n't go to cinema.i usually go to cinema for big movies like star wars but watch normal movies from netflix . 
  yeah i see it . 
  greek and turkish jets will waste their fuel on aegean while chasing eachother ( they are currently doing this with f-16s ) . 
  sdf captured it from them in 2015 or 2016 that is why they say it . 
   everytime they loose a battle to daesh , they bomb sdf ( american positions included ) . 
  my best guess is that 's how ankara pass their nerves . 
  and the tfsa lost a dozen times while trying to take al bab , qabasin , bzaah , etc nope they do n't . most of the bombing is done by tfsa and they target tel-r\u0131fat ( there are no american in afrin ) . they are bombing them because they say sdf stole it from them and they are trying to soften them for future operations ( if happens ) . 
   well i 'm not providing that one because then i 'm pretty sure it 'd end up in the hands of turkish intelligence one way or another ( it 's a public forum ) that 'd use it to bomb everywhere else thank you but no . 
  i am sure due to those high tech drones and sattilets turkey have and ameican-turkish talks they know where americans are.why would turkey want to bomb her allies ? 
   when you bomb an area with american soldiers 15 km behind the frontline , this is a targetted murder attempt , nothing else . 
  15km what?the distance is a lot shorter than that . 
  america does n't put soldiees in every sdf controlled area.do you have any sources which say there are american presence in the parts of amirah where turks bomb ? 
  [ ** border between sdf and es ** ] ( http://syriancivilwarmap.com ) . 
  there are n't americans there and the shelling did n't target them ( sdf video showed the shelling note : es means euphrates shield forces who control the areas captured in the turkish operation . 
  which part unlike you i can give you sources for my claims [ here ] ( http://www.diken.com.tr/ilk-karar-demirtasa-teror-orgutu-propagandasindan-beraat/ ) . 
  demirta\u015f won the first trial but others are still going . 
  [ here ] ( http://syria.liveuamap.com/en/2017/10-february-turkish-army-is-shelling-the-town-arima-and-the ) . turkish shelling of arima ( a town near the border between es and sdf ) . 
   during the capture of menag for example , or recent random shelling on manbij comes to mind random shelling was made by artillery which happened near the border between es forces and sdf.us forces were n't around.turkey is still a nato ally they do n't target americans because they ca n't get away with it . 
   generally a prison sentance is something that happens when you have a crime , somebody guilty , evidence , a trial , and the family knows what happens to them and can even visit under condition . 
   none of those criterias are met . 
  the last we heard about most hdp mp 's and officials is messages on twitter accounts such as demirtas ' `` the police is at my door to take me away '' then nobody saw them alive since there is state of emergency in turkey and erdo\u011fan is using it.i never claimed they deserved those senteces but your statement claimed they dissapered and are dead.that is not true there has been footage for demirta\u015f but mostly when he was transported ( recent one was on media few days ago ) . also some hdp pms who got arrested are realesed so they did n't die as you claimed . 
   atm majority of the military 's officer are in jail . 
  no they are not.a lot of soldiers were kicked out of the army ( some will return some will not ) and some were jailed but they do n't make the majority of officers . 
  the ones in syria and rest of the taf are not shity or bad.they are trying to avoid combat.most of the assaults are done by poorly trained fsa militants which capture points but ca n't hold them without building defences . 
  i love how some people love to exterigate things to point where it is just funny . 
  i do n't agree with him but most of your claims are false . 
   attempting to bomb us troops in syria because they dared support ypg and erdogan do n't like ypg . 
  when and how?turks did n't try to bomb us troops . 
   the kidnapping and disappearance of journalists or most known hdp membres who have n't been heard anymore since a year ( and can probably be assumed all dead at that point ) ; etc no one got kidnapped or disappered.a lot of hdp pm are in jail that is why you do n't hear any news from them and they are not dead . 
  please do n't make these kind of assumptions if you are not well informed about the subject . 
   young people have always been more idealistic than their elders , and more liberal too . 
  in the 1960s baby-boomers spearheaded the social revolution that liberalised values across western countries . 
  what were then fringe issues , such as equality for women and racial minorities , are now social norms in most rich countries . 
  and even in places where they are not , young people espouse such values . 
  however , as a new survey reveals , there is one area where young people 's views are not so progressive : free speech . 
   overall , the poll conducted by populus , a research firm , on behalf of the varkey foundation , an educational charity , shows that among young people there is broad support for expanding rights to historically marginalised minority groups . 
  in all of the 18 countries surveyed , a majority of 18 - to 21-year-olds agreed that there should be equality between the sexes and rights for transgender people . 
  in the united states , three-quarters of respondents are in favour of transgender rights . 
  the young are similarly supportive in india , which introduced a law recognising rights for a `` third gender '' in 2014 . 
   even when equal treatment is not enshrined in law , young people tend to support it . 
  more than half of youngsters in 15 countries want safe and legal abortion -- even in places where the procedure is currently illegal , such as south korea . 
  similarly , respondents in most countries are in favour of same-sex marriage . 
  this pattern includes india , where homosexuality is a crime . 
   however , there is one right that young people are less keen on extending to others : the right to say what you want . 
  overall , fewer than half of those polled agreed that people should be allowed to express non-violent opinions even if they offend minorities . 
  in britain and germany , for instance , only 46 % and 48 % did . 
   the right to free speech is not absolute , as anyone who shouts `` fire '' in a crowded theatre will soon discover . 
  at the same time , the recent polling data bolster the view that today \u2032 s youth are embracing a right not to be offended , which threatens to squelch necessary debate . 
  time will tell whether this group starts to dedicate itself to winning arguments rather than to preventing them from occurring . 
  i meant it is hard to prepare a good one.in turkey a good turkish coffe has to have a foam.we either cook it in cups and put the cups directly on fire ( [ like this ] ( https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:and9gct-hbwolpuqftm8ilwskwd-_hcrieeiwks1fbq2xey1ipgwqz2-_btkafy3_w ) ) or with copper pots that are called `` cezve '' ( [ like this ] ( https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:and9gcqlv_y2uy7scgg2j3ekzy-wlrv8ur9x0bh9wrj0o2kvoeeamtwb_a ) ) ( some people also cook it in heated sand ) . 
   lool , i always found it funny that we drink a special grind/blend of arabic coffee that we inherited from the ottomans and call `` turkish coffee '' ( aka `` homemade coffee '' ) , while the turks today almost exclusively drink black tea . 
  in fact i live in western europe and there 's a turkish grocery store around the corner selling turkish coffee , but the only brand they have is serbian turkish coffe , and i as a serb am buying it from the turks who drink tee . 
  turkish coffe comes from yemen and grinded and cooked in a different way ( that is why it is called turkish coffe ) . most turks drink turkish coffe but they do n't drink it regularly because it is hard to prepare one and mostly used in celabrations etc. 
  ( usually without sugar etc. 
  only coffe maybe with lokum ) . 
  akp 's economic is caused by countiuing kemal dervi\u015f 's policies and putting great economic leaders as the head of economy ( akp 's minister of economy are usually very well educated liberals who knows what to do.also they do n't really make public commonents to avoid backlash ) . 
  give more rights to kurds , increase the investment in kurdish areas , make groups like hdp stronger ( with less ties with pkk ) to counter pkk 's influence , teach people fighting against eachother will not benefit anyone and force pkk to negotiate or countiue fighting with them .
