   so we agree ? 
  kinda.the most important help eu gave to turkey were suggestions ( the eu process ) which helped turkey a lot ( productivity in state instutues increased a lot ) . your comment was harsh but eu helped turkey a lot when turkey was recovering from the 2002 crisis so yes . 
   i will give it a try . 
  regarding the freedom of press you [ rank ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/press_freedom_index ) better than north korea but worse than russia so it 's reasonable in my opinion to be very carefully with turkish media . 
  i live in turkey and hate akp you are right pro-gov media spews shit but some of those i shared were statements of eu officals so i got a little angry because i misunderstood you ( sorry ) . it seems like you just want sources which is totaly ok . free press in turkey is better than russia ( not very much ... ) it is ranked below it because of erdo\u011fan 's ego and after the coup turkey arrested many journalist ( some will be released but they are keeping them as long as they can ... ) russia does n't have a conflict like turkey-pkk , akp-gulen which is why many journalist are arrested but general opposition in the media and press is a lot stronger than russia ( akp did n't even get the majority of the votes so he is very different than putin ) . big newspapers or online news of turkey kemalist  yeni\u00e7a\u011f , s\u00f6zc\u00fc , ayd\u0131nl\u0131k msm media ( centre left )  h\u00fcrriyet msm media ( centre )  milliyet , posta socialist and leftwing  cumhuriyet , sol , diken , birg\u00fcn , t-24 ( maybe agos ) pro-gov  sabah , habert\u00fcrk , star , ak\u015fam toilet paper  yeni \u015eafak , akit , milat  possible that i miss understood this , my bad because you did n't claim it directly and stated they are still sending . 
  it is ok i was n't very clear .

  turkey already had refugee camps in syria and there are few ones in northen aleppo ( it is in the links i posted ) . 
  [ many refugees returned to jarabulus ] ( http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/05/turkey-syria-refugee-women-gain-confidence-work-programs.html ) turkey wants to build a safe zone to send refugees back here is the proposed [ one ] ( https://www.google.com.tr/search?q=turkish+safe+zone+in+northern+syria&amp;safe=strict&amp;client=ms-android-huawei&amp;tbm=isch&amp;prmd=niv&amp;source=lnms&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewixppgfj-prahwkhjokhuzqbogq_auibigc&amp;biw=360&amp;bih=511&amp;dpr=2#imgrc=1oj9i5pl9lvn0m%3a ), 
  money was n't paid ( it is still beign paid ) but a deal took place.turkey is stopping refugees from going near borders this is why it stopped . 
   sorry but this all in turkish language ( first problem ) and given the conditions in turkey , where free media does not exist anymore and reports have to be compliant to the governments agenda ( second problem ) this is not reliable . 
  google changed their translation system it is now very good ( at least understandable ) for english to turkish . 
  what?really?the links i sent you are from anti-goverment press ( which release anti-goverment articles all the time ) and they are mostly statements of individuals ( sometimes eu officals ) . do you really think we are living in north korea ? 
  ( and that card project was cover by foreign press.it is on r/worldnews and people started using it )  i see that it will be difficult to find international sources about the spendings of turkey so one should not insist on better sources , i appreciate your efforts but i doubt that you can provide reliable data on this . 
  i would suggest to add `` according to the turkish government '' to your statements . 
  well it was stated in meetings with eu ( by turkish officals ) and it is very realistic ( considering the fact that turkey is hosting refugees since 2012 ) .80 % of turkey wants refugees to return after the war ends and money sre not happy about it.goverment knows this so i do n't think they will want to fake numbers.turkey is maintaing thise camps by herself and it got a lot of praise for it.faking it would mean nothing because turkey is paying for it not other countries . 
   edit : your claim that the eu violated the agreement should be source able nevertheless . 
  where did i claim that ? 
  that economic boom ( the average growth of turkey is 5,3 % and during akp goverment it is 4,6 % ) was built with smart policies from previous goverments , eu process ( which fixed a lot of problems in the state ) and foreign investment.foreign investment played an important role in turkey 's recovery from 2001 crisis but it was n't only from europe ( a huge part of investment comes from muslim countries right now ) . 
  we are not built with your money.turkey before erdo\u011fan was still a large economy ( position has n't changed i think it is 17th or 18th ) turkey is not a great or a big country but acting like it is in this position only because of eu is n't right.you are acting like turkey was an underdevoloped country until 2000s but it is not true.turkey is in a similar position since 50s . i do n't have to be greatful to you because we as people are not countries and you are talking about something different than what we are talking about ( also you are beign rude to 80m peole and acting like king of denmark ) . a lot of people are think eu is paying for refugees in turkey but it is not true.eu is paying money as part of the deal but it is n't that large if you compare to what turkey spent ( camps in turkey are built and maintained by turkish goverment not by eu ) . 
  erdo\u011fan does n't want more money and he does n't really care about it but you are not seeing it . 
  [ link for 25 billion dollars ] ( http://www.yenicaggazetesi.com.tr/mobi/binali-yildirim-multecilere-25-milyar-dolar-harcadik-149706h.htm ) . it is from november 2016 [ link for the 3 billion ] ( http://www.ntv.com.tr/dunya/ab-suriyeli-multeciler-icin-740-milyon-euro-gonderdi,eruvolb1quqmgtpemmvafq ) ( it says we sent 750 million of it but it is from summer 2016 so it increased since then ) . 
  [ link for the credit cards ] ( http://haberler.com/kizilay-kart-suriyeli-multecilerin-yaralarina-8804912-haberi/ ) ( it says eu 's 350 million will be used for it ) . 
  edit : it seems like that 25 billion dollars also include the ones from foundations and municipalities . 
  [ link for syrian refugees ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/refugees_of_the_syrian_civil_war ) and [ here is a link for all refugees ] ( http://tr.euronews.com/2016/04/28/dunyaya-ornek-olarak-gosterilen-turkiye-deki-multeci-kamplari ) but i made a mistake for iraqi refugees .0.4 million is not the number of iraq refugees.it is the number of refugees from iraq , iran and somalia and afghanistan . 
  refugees camps in turkey are built and managed by turkish goverment ( by afad ) . that 3 billion eu send ( they are still sending it they did n't even send half of it ) will be directly given to syrian refugees in turkey ( to those in camps and to those in border towns.turkey will give them special cards and eu and turkey will put money in them ) . 
  turkey is welcoming many tourist but it is very different than this.those tourist are staying in hotels and eating with their own money.turkey already spent more than 25 billion dollars to refugees ( they are also building camps in syria and sending some refugees there ) . 
  building and maintaing camps are not very easy.they take a lot of space they are basically mini cities that need police , electricity and many basic other services and ofcourse jobs . 
  turkey currently hosts 2,7 million syrians and 0,4 million ~ ~ iraqis ~ ~ my mistake sources say other but do n't say where are they from ( ~ ~ only the ones that came after 2010 ~ ~ the ones since 1988 . thousands of kurds , turkmens and arabs escaped to turkey in 2003 and 1991 ) . there are some other refugees but they are treated in some centres and then sent back to their countries if they are not in danger ( 150 of them escaped one of those centres few mounths ago ) . 
   close the border ? 
  they are not letting them go to europe and stopping them . 
   put them in camps and do n't let them outside , just give em enough food , water , shelter . 
  that 's what is required to be done by the law . 
  they are already in camps but finding and putting 3 million people into camps and feeding them is not very easy ( the camps in turkey is directly managed by turkish goverment and it is made with containers and tents with international standarts.most of the people who visited those camps say they are very good and have very good projects to help refugees so it is expensive to built and maintain and it takes a lot space.they are currently building refugees camps in syria in terretories they liberated from isis ) . unlike some countries turkey never said we will accept refugees and did n't signedd the deal ( turkey only said we will only accept refugees from europe ) but they accepted refugees when they needed help ( they accepted thousands of refugees from middle east and asia when they needed help despite not signing the deal they did a lot more than they claimed they would ) . 
  ~ ~ ffs i hate `` turkey wants mur money from yorup '' shit ~ ~ ( it was very harsh sorry ) turkey already spent 25 billion dollars ( 12,5 from goverment ,12,5 from foundations and municipalities ) to refugees ( and this was last year it incresed now.they are currently building a safe zone in syria that will also increase the cost ) . europe accepted to send 3 billion euroes directly to refugees ( with credits cards etc. ), 
  and turks did n't get even half of it ( they are still sending it ) . 
  erdo\u011fan does n't want more money , erdo\u011fan wants more support from europe and visa to get more votes . 
  1 important side note mevl\u00fct cavu\u015fo\u011flu talked about the deal between greece and turkey not the deal between turkey and europe ( he said it on tv ) . 
   turkish government officials are not carrying migrants across the border , correct . 
  they are however complicit and looking the other way . 
  it 's not exactly a secret what is happening , who is doing it and where they are doing it . 
  i am sure that the turkish government is not so incompetent to not be able to stop smuggling if they wanted to . 
  like i said , they have control here and they are using that control as a political weapon . 
  they are literally stopping them from leaving to europe ( and many refugees are angry about it ) and the number of those who uses the sea route decreased ( but the deaths increased ) . i am not really sure what you are expecting.they can increase their coast guards and stop a lot of them but thousands are not using it anymore ( like in 2015 ) and turkey thinks it is not getting enough support for refugees so they do n't want to spend more time and money to increase those guards.also they arrested many smugglers and countiue arresting them so they are not sending them or letting them go to europe . 
   how would that help if they 'd just ferry the migrants to europe like they are doing now ? 
  turkey is holding migrants back from going to europe they are not sending them to europe . 
   those army officers probably helped with the turkish invasion of cyprus . 
  wtf?how ? 
   greece should just hand them back to turkey and let them be executed . 
  they are n't going to be executed and greece wo n't hand them ( for now ) . 
  what is really going to happen - erdo\u011fan says we might cancel the deal - eu says let 's talk - turkey calls ambassador to greece back . 
  - ambassador returns to greece erdo\u011fan shit talks about greece, 
  41 % at 7th of july and ( between these 2 elections erdogan threatened people , terror increased and opposition did n't form a goverment despite call from people so the support for akp increased ) 49,5 % at 1st of november .49,5 % is not even majority . 
  during ergenekon trials some soldiers also commited suicide.beign ` gulenist ' is a lot worse because they even arrest their family members ( as you said many killed themselves before getting arrested ) . even during the 1980 coup goverment claimed many ` commited suicide ' because they died during torture not because goverment wanted to kill them ( deep state did that job ) . i do n't think they will kill them and call it a ` suicide ' . 
  also 7 did n't die in prison 7 tried to kill themselves ( 3 died in prison some in f types ) and not all 17 of them were suspected gulenists.some were n't gulenists or suspects . 
  edit : sorry i accidently reposted it 2 times had to delete the other 2, 
  yeah you should have protected someone who was the leader of a terrorist organization ... aside from all moral choices you do realize this would have resulted in war right?syria did that first mit tried to assasinate him with vehicles stolen from syrian embassies and after that turkey said we will declare war then they kicked the \u00d6calan out . 
   i know you 're not claiming that , just a general question on how turkish logic works there . 
  yeah turkish logic not some stupid akp shit ... everyone including some akp members know how important laussane is only some are using this to draw attention and trying to get more nationalist votes . 
  1-he wo n't do it.erdo is just talk no action . 
  2-these crimes were commited before it was brought back ( it would n't but let 's say it was magicaly brought back ) so you ca n't punish them with death . 
  we both know this wo n't happen.at max they will get attacked in prison but killing someone and claiming it is suicide is not going to happen . 
  beating maybe but killing no . 
  edit : to those who downvote this you know many people are already arrested right ? 
  ( and unlike these guys some were directly part of the coup ) ( a lot of people were arrested and fired some were released and some returned to their jobs but many are still waiting for trial ) . they might get attacked in prison but they wo n't ` suicide ' . it is not 1980 . 
   the far reaching decree also covers stricter rules on drinking , gambling , the vague and emphatic `` going to places that would ruin your reputation '' , as well as `` excessive spending '' , all while off duty gambling is banned in turkey and it does n't say anything about using alchol off duty.also excessive spending one is about corruption.also it does n't say your reputation it says profession 's reputation . 
  k m8 ( when you say something stupid but it is 21st century and people are going to translate it to english ) . 
  they were mostly hit while they were supporting rebels.i saw isis 's atgm videos ( against turkish and rebels forces ) and none of them had destroyed hulls that were seperated from the tank.those 2 tanks ( the ones with desroyed hulls in their latest propaganda video ) were disabled and left on the battelfield.isis probably brought them on open ground and turaf destroyed them.after that they took photos of it and used it in their videos.only 1 soldier died in the hospital in those 10 hits.if that damage was done by atgms it would have been a lot higher . 
  hit = / = lost only 1 soldier died in those attacks ( he was wounded and died in the hospital ) and turkish leopard 2a4s ( which is different than the ones germans ones ) are n't upgraded to 2ngs ( the new version turks will use.it is devolped by turkish company aselsan ) . they currently do n't have reactive armor and active protection ( new version will have both of them.akkor active protection system is still in devolpment ) . 
  also these tanks do n't have turkish infantry to protect them.they rely on rebels because taf does n't want to lose soldiers and this causes probelms.rebels are not very good at fighting . 
  64 % of mhp voters are against presidency and many akp voters are also against it.bah\u00e7eli is disliked by many mhp supporters ( if he was n't the leader of mhp mhp would have 15 % of the votes ) . members wanted new election but he stoppes them and the coup happened so it waa forgotten . 
  even the saadet ( saadet and bbp got 2 % in the elections but the electoral dam is 10 % in turkey so many saadet and bbp supporters vote for akp and mhp ) this is n't about being on hdp 's side nearly all parties except for mhp ( serious opposition even in the party and majority of their supports do n't want it ) and akp ( many of their supporters do n't want it ) say no . 
   look at our ~ ~ mhp ~ ~ bah\u00e7eli and his supporters for example.they are basically akp 's dogs at this stage . 
  if all parties were like that in turkey our parliament would be all cuddly and shit . 
  many mhp pms knew how bad it is and voted no.these guys are real nationalist unlike bah\u00e7eli.some of them were fired from the party but they still say no to dictatorship . 
  nearly all parties from saadet ( yes that islamist party ) to hdp say no to dictatorship , they all said `` our answer is no '' only bah\u00e7eli 's and erdo\u011fan 's supporters ( a lot of akp supporters are against it ) say yes because they are blinded by their political choices and they are traitors .

  yeah.after the 2000 economic crisis goverment fixed many problems and with eu talks more things were fixed.thanks to these changes turkey recovered from 2008 crisis faster than any other european country and became the largest growing economy in europe.despite many problems and stupid political choices growth is around 3 % -4 % ( lira is losing its value because of erdo\u011fan 's stupid decisions.the problem is political if he changes his policies tl will rise again but its erdo\u011fan so he will just shout and blame someone ) . 
  for turkey it is +4,67 %, 
  they knew it was coming.they gave them that power and when they learned about the coup they let it happen ( they were alresdy puring gulenist ) and purged them all at once with more support . 
  they worked with fetullah gulen for a long time.they probably started making the list of gulenist after 2013 when their relations got bad . 
  the important thing is they purge a lot of people but innocent ones return ( it can take 1 mounth or 1 year depends on how hard you work.one of the teachers in my school got fired and returned in a mounth ) . the worst part is high ranking akp members ( which are very guilty ) do n't get purged and they purge a lot of people with the mind set `` if they are innocent they will get back '' , ok they will return but this does n't mean they will get their lost time and money back . 
  that is for brand.this list is for the model ( which is fiat egea ) not for the brand . 
  best year in history ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ) . ^ ^ ^ gib ^ ^ ^ tax ^ ^ ^ infidel, 
  no one denied that article and someone released a paper that came to mit . 
  it was n't a false flag but we know mit got the info and russians also gave the same info.i tought a lot of people knew it so did n't share it.i wish i had shared those so people could see ( few documents and articles by russian media.they say russians warned erdo\u011fan and no turkish offical denied it ) . 
   a reputable newspaper . 
  that writes an article about everything erdo\u011fan says.in their articles they are making it look like erdo\u011fan is preparing to invade greece . 
   he 's the president of turkey and it seems like you 're trying to minimize it because you regard him as an embarrassment . 
  i 'd be embarrassed too , but you ca n't hide from reality . 
  no , he is minizing it because he is living in turkey and knows erdo\u011fan unlike many people.erdo\u011fan says thousands of things only does few of them.he said bad things about russia now putin is his best friend.he was assad 's best friend and demined the syrian-turkish border but we know how it turned out . 
   why is the mention of the genocide of armenians , greeks and assyrians such a trigger for you ?
