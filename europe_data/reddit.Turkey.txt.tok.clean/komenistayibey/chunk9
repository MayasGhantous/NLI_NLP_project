  do you deny that it happened ? 
  no he is asking you what does it has to do with it.do we talk about arabization policies of baath party when we are talking about syria ? 
   none particularly . 
  i 'm demonstrating that the problem is n't just erdogan , turkish secularists have historically been just as hateful and abusive towards non-turks . 
  not only christians , but kurds . 
  turkish secularist ** were ** also hateful against muslims but those days are over.chp is now pro-kurdish and respects people 's religion . 
   should we look into a nation 's past every single time there is a political post ? 
  when it 's relevant , yes . 
  the past is the key to understand the present . 
  do n't be embarrassed . 
   how in the fuck chp incited the progroms ? 
  pogroms started around 1955 and chp was not in power after 1950 . 
  now you are just cherry-picking . 
  there was ** a pogrom ** in 1955 , a disastrous one . 
  it would n't have happened if the chp had n't spent it 's decades in power turning a blind eye to previous smaller racial attacks and pogroms . 
   do n't spin history to try and make it seem as if it was at all justified . 
  it was no more justified than the turkish genocide of armenians , greeks and assyrians . 
  the first operatiom was accepted and got supported from the world ( they did n't just invade the island for fun ) . the second operation and turkey staying on the island ( which is not chp 's fault ) is the reason why it is called the invasion . 
   i 'm demonstrating that it 's not just the islamic akp ( or it 's predecessor the justice party ) nor is it the ultranationalist mhp . 
  it 's the entirety of the turkish political spectrum outside of some left wing kurdish parties . 
  chp and hdp got 36 % of the votes so it is not entirery of turkish political spectrum . 
   no , i stated a fact . 
  turkish nationhood defines itself * against * other nations , that 's why it is so threatened by the expression of national feeling by non-turkish minorities like the kurds today . 
  no it does n't . only populist leaders use `` x is our enemy '' shit to get support like other countries . 
   200 years ago there was no turkey , or turks at least not in the same sense as today . 
  yes there were.many countries used the name turkey for anatolia and the name itself comes from italian.also there were turks but the term turk were mostly used for common folk who lived in anatolia ( the name turks is a lot older than the ottoman empire ) . 
   there was the ottoman empire , and every muslim be they bosnian or palestinian or turkic speaking was defined as a turk and the identity of the empire was based around it 's imperial structure and it 's centrality in the islamic world since it was the seat of the caliph . 
  in the twilight years of the empire , a new identity for the turkish ( turkic , anatolian , muslim ) nation was artificially created and somewhat artificially imposed . 
  ottoman 's millet system was based on religion not on identity ( there were similar system that was based on identity but it was only used for small number of people ) . that identity was n't artificially created millet system collapsed and turkish nationalism rose.before that there was a difference but it was n't very important and it was n't used much but after the collapse of the millet system many groups in turkey got turkified and many muslims just accepted themselves as turk.nationalist only removed foreign influences and replaced them with ancient anatolian and turkic symbols and forced people to adapt it . 
   this identity is centred around turkish difference and opposition to/from other people 's in the region and artificially detaches turkishness from the ottomans by creating a national myth of ancient turkic lineage to the point of ridiculousness , like the turkish military defining it 's founding date in the 3rd century bc . 
  no it is not.ataturk himself tried to establish good relations with neighbors.there is nothing like turks should hate x or love x ( turks probably hate arabs a lot more than many christian nations but our relations with arabic countries are great ) . they were nationalist so they took the turkic heritage ( it is mostly cultural ) to stupid levels but they also used the ancient anatolian symbols and it is also part of our nation . 
  that date was set years after the republic was founded ( in the 80s ) . nationalist things like this are done by a lot of nations so it is not very unusual ( they used the founding if jannisary units before that ) . 
   democratic party that incited pogroms against the phanariote greeks who remained in istanbul/constantinople after the population transfers and it was a chp government that invaded cyprus and ethnically cleansed hundreds of thousands of greeks from their homes there . 
  democratic party was islamist like erdo\u011fam.it was a coaltion goverment who invaded cyprus ( also they did n't invaded it for fun the first operation was not an invasion and the world supported it.the second operation is the reason why it is called invasion ) . 
   the problem spans the entire political spectrum and it 's because the post-ottoman turkish identity is defined against other nations as opposed to the greek or english or german or chinese national identity which is defined by a shared cultural and familial heritage . 
  what?are you serious?the post ottoman turkish identity is defined by culture not against other nations.only populist leaders and parties use `` x are our enemies '' shit to gain support ( which is not exclusive for turkey ) . 
  i tried to translate half of it it is not great but it will help you understand it . 
  they are talking about a propoasal i do n't have a link but i ll translate a part of it for people to understand - ( mr.enc\u00fc ) + ( president of the council ) @ ( mps who talk at the start ) -- ( other mps ) + does commission agree with the proposal ? 
  @no do n't mr.president + does goverment agree with the proposal ? 
  @no we do n't mr president + \u015e\u0131rnak mp mr.enc\u00fc wants to talk about the proposal.go on mr.enc\u00fc - mr.president and dear mps . 
  first of all i mourn all the civilians and kids who were murdered by security forces . 
  -- security forces do n't murder civilians . 
  -- also mourn the people who were murdered by terrorist groups . 
  -- how does sf murder people ? 
  + dear mps mr.hatip please pay attention to your words . 
  -- rewind , rewind - practicly this propoasal means nothing.we learned it in the previous 4 mouths.everyone knows people were tortured and murder and akp goverment who proposed this turned blind eye to that . 
  -- mr.president what is he talking about ? 
  - because of that everyone knows it is not sincere . 
  + mr.enc\u00fc please use a more civil manner and do n't use a harsh words.security forces are not murdering they are fighting against teror . 
  - maybe you wo n't like the facts.please rembember 2 year old esra and remember does civilians who died in silopi by artillery fire ( artilleries were n't use there but tanks were used to destroy barricades in `` hendek operasyonlar\u0131 '' after the collapse of the cease fire ) . 
  + dear mps please this is half of the video ( 0:00 -2:44 ) . it is not perfect but it will help you understand how real ( ! ), 
  those translations are.i am sorry but i do n't have a link a video with english subtitles . 
  edit : thanks for deleting it . 
  this video is fake and subtitles are just lies that has nothing to do with what they say ... 
  really?wtf?translations are not true ( i am not saying they are n't accurate.i am saying they are just lies that had nothing to do with what he says ) . he is just wrote some fake things and than published it on youtube ( it is n't their first time.they do this shit a lot ) . 
  please do some research before sharing things . 
  yeah it is mostly political . 
  akp does n't want to be seen as the loser and they do n't want things happened in 1974 to happen again . 
  interesting, 
  that is not true.unlike other countries in the region turkey has a very big young population and a stable birth rate .3 million people who ca n't speak turkish wo n't benefit turkish economy because we already have enough labour and workers . 
  it will increase the influence on iraq and syria and turkish companies will expand to those countries but other than that it does n't really benefit turkey . 
  but it backfired and now he is trying as hard as he can to keep at least a little part of them in the country ( nearly everyone wants them to return after the war ends ) . 
  nope.most of those money was given directly to refugees with credit card kinda things in refugee camps ( turkey controls her own camps and sells food directly to refugees in those camps then they cook their own food or get food from centres.they use those cards to buy things ) . 
  eu only sent 600million euroes while turkey spent 25 billion dollars.so eu wo n't pay for them but erdo\u011fan will have more supporters . 
   if the refugees cause pain to the kurds , that would be an added advantage to erdogan . 
  what ? 
  they protested it and said it should stop ( also they pushed for coaltion more than all opposition parties combined ) . and when akp and gulenist purged kemalist from the army hdp ( back than it was bdp ) did n't do anything and supported it but chp never cheered for hdp arrests , protested them and said `` you ca n't arrest elected people , this is illegal.we demand their release '' . 
  he saw their car and thought it was suspicions and went to check it.attackers were behind the car with assault rifles.he killed one of the attackers but he ran out of bullets and got shot by the other one . 
  for people who do n't know turkey 's climate.we have a lot snow here and it is fucking cold i am from ardahan and it was -30 \u00b0 c in 9pm and i live in ankara which is usually -10 \u00b0 c at the morning but some cities like mersin ( cities near mediterranean and agean coast ) have a very warm climate and it rarely snow in those places . 
  i never said it is a good thing.i said it is bad but trying to potray it like something else is wrong.many people think turkey is supporting isis ( they are actually fighting against them in iraq and syria and arresting their members in turkey ) and things like this ( potraying it like it is about isis ) make them think they are right.erdo\u011fan is an asshole but this does n't mean you should bend the truth . 
  person in the video said `` we wo n't allow presidential system '' ( which probably triggered erdo\u011fan ) and called people to support their efforts.so she did n't get arrested for talking shit against isis ( but it is easier to get clicks and support if you try to potray it like `` she spoke against isis and got arrested '' . this shit is stupid like 99 % of the things erdo\u011fan do but trying to potray it like something different is not a good thing ) . 
  he is the head of turkish diyanet ( like pope of turkey ) . some morons did n't condemned the attack and acted like it did n't happen but if a religious leader condemns it that will at least stop them from acting like that . 
  but it is bacalar and translates to chimneys . 
  fairybros ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  this post was posted by u / - kyzaghan - in r/turkey . 
  interesting.we also have very similar structures in turkey ( in [ cappadocia ] ( https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:and9gcqfxq9vxlhjrc-sjsynztwj7erpfv6jq7fxygon6uqgdfjk6rh8pacfqjeijg ) ) . people also belive fairies lived in those places and called them `` peri bacalar\u0131 '' ( peri means fairy in turkish ) . 
  he is the president of turkey ( recep tayyip erdo\u011fan ) . and the point of the meme is people celebrate the new year and then get back to their shitty lives . 
  erdo\u011fan has many kurdish supporters and he wo n't try to genocide them.this conflict is n't turkishvskurdish conflict.it is a lot more complicated than that . 
  this is probably an islamist attack . 
  which part ? 
  it is so good they moved their capital just for it . 
  ahrar declined to merge with jsf and accepted the ceasefire.those who do n't accept it will be abonded by turkey while the ones who accept it will get a place in the negotiation . 
  i wo n't share the video but here is a short description from another user  they are each standing , with a chain wrapped around their neck which is interwoven with fabric soaked in fuel . 
  those chains are locked to the ground in the same peg . 
  in addition , there are chains at certain points of the body which reduce their movement ( this part is only potentially , this was hard to determine from camera angles ) . 
  the fire spreads up the chain while they stand still - i 'd assume they thought it was a mock execution or there were weapons trained on them just off screen . 
  once the fire hits their neck they fall to the ground and try to put it out . 
  eventually they stop screaming and lie still . 
  one look at the camera and mumbles something all the while his body is engulfed . 
  hands clenched in fists as the tendons are destroyed from the heat . 
  bone exposed in hands , ears charred off , heels burned off . 
  but then the barbarian gives a speech holding a drum of fuel and dumps it on the burning body as he continues the speech . 
  he did n't cover his face ; i 'm sure turkish and western intelligence agencies are running his face through all sorts of databases by this time . 
  they id ` ed `` jihadi john '' through a mask so i 'm sure the barbarian will become id ` ed easily enough . 
  vah\u015fice katledilen askerlerin isimleri fethi \u015eahin ve sefer ta\u015f ** translation ** while taf and fsa were clashing isis in al-bab group released a brutal video . 
  in the viseo that was published by isis 's news angecy 2 soldiers are beign burned to death executions happens at the end of the 19 min video at the end of the video 2 isis militants are threatening turkey and tells turkey to pull back its forces if they do n't want any more videos like this . 
  the names of the soldiers who were bruttaly murder are fethi \u015eahin and sefer ta\u015f . 
  they made a mistake then ( probably a translation error ) . 
  they were trying to assault the city but isis countrr attack so instead of losing men they disabled them and retreated . 
  those tanks cost a lot so it is not worth it.they use drones to follow isis cars to their bases and then use those armed drones to blow them up which is better .
