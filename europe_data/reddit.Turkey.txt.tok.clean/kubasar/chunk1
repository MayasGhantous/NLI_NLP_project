yes they may have warned , but still deported them into the benelux . 
  because he is not turkish citizen , so it 's not our business . 
  if belgium ca n't deal with his own terrorist citizens , well , it 's not our problem . 
   and yes , send the other back to where they come from . 
  sorry to say that , but it 's not how it works ...  but was n't it so that the safe zones were opposed by russia ? 
  russians can say whatever they want . 
  as long as safe zone guarded by nato , they ca n't dare to touch . 
  all we need is just `` will power '' . 
  also , safe zone nothing to do with kurds , it 's planned on isis held area , where majority is arab . 
  with this , we can send all the syrian refugees to their country and deal with other ones . 
   not admitting them back is a bit of an unfair move . 
  it 's also unfair to us , because they are also not belongs to our land , like europe , so we should also send them back to syria ? 
  where civil war is still going ? 
  sorry but i do n't understand your politicians logic , they said `` open the borders for syrians '' but in the same time they said `` do n't let them move to europe '' , they also said `` we will help you '' but they do n't do that either . 
  if europe had supported turkey 's safe zone proposals , there would be no refugee crisis . 
  it 's still not too late but our european friends do n't like this idea , i guess ? 
  because we do n't drop them or deport them anywhere . 
  it 's their own will , they are simply wants to move europe and it 's nothing to do with us . 
  trying to be funny ? 
   literally bombing the shit out of kurds and syrians . 
  what ? 
  you are mixed with russians , i think ? 
  unlike russia , we never targets civillians . 
  also , we do n't bombs the kurds but pkk . 
  and many kurds fled to the turkish cities , thanks to pkk . 
  there is 7 millions kurds who living in western part of turkey . 
   we are not asking you to keep everyone , we are asking you to stop the madness that is happening in the aegean . 
  are you [ sure about this ? 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/06/eu-urges-turkey-to-open-its-borders-to-syrians-fleeing-war-torn-aleppo ) i think you do n't have any idea . 
  you guys just saying `` take all the refugees and not let them move to europe '' . 
   if europe had supported turkey 's safe zone proposals so many would-be refugees would n't have even had to leave the country this !, 
  sorry but your examples too irrevelant . 
  first of all , turkic peoples not just linguistic group but also ** ethnic ** group . 
  we are not just turkish speaking people , we are also turk and we are not formed with republic . 
  read the orkhon scripts , this will help you to understand . 
  we are the same people who created `` g\u00f6kt\u00fcrk khaganate '' . 
  turks are not a bunch of greeks , armenians who call himself a turk . 
  and attila ... atilla and european huns from onogurs and onogurs is parth of oghuz turks and oghuz turks is dominant group in the turkey . 
  so , that mean they are parth of our history , right ? 
  because there is no word like `` turkic '' in turkish and turkic people not that far away from bulgaria ( khazar khaganate , onogurs ( part of oghuzs ) , pechenegs ) . 
  also , chinese chronicles says there is a blonde turks , turks with colored eyes ( mukan khagan best example ) . 
  central-asian turkic people are not oghuz turks ( except turkmenistan ) , but eastern kipchak turks . 
  it 's not a secret , we are mixed very much , our ancestors loves the european and asian chicks and no one can blame them  btw proud turkish tradition says `` as long as your father is turk , you are turk '' . 
   there is one challenger to erdogan , his name is selahattin demirtas . 
  he 's relatively young , good looking and charismatic . 
  ** he is nothing but pitiful pkk supporter . 
  his party lost many votes after the his pro-pkk speechs ( when pkk broke the ceasefire ) . 
  there is no way that selahattin can lead the opposition . 
  uld\u0131z , oktar , dengizek , muncuk ... clearly , turkish names ... 
  there is no european turkey but turkey !, 
  awesome !, 
  wish i can learn about him much more ... 
   according to you every kurd or sympathizer = pkk nonsense . 
  how can you get this from what i said ? 
  it 's like you said pkk = kurd lol  as far as i know , tak 's a bit too uh , hardcore , and extreme , even for a lot of pkk fighters . 
  hell , last i heard a lot of tak were pkk kicked out for going too far do n't get me wrong but you do n't know anything . 
  can you tell me , there is any tak member neutralised ? 
  you ca n't because there is ** not ** . 
  they are just pkk members . 
  beginning of the video , i just think this is a video of `` s\u00fcnnet t\u00f6reni '' ( circumcision ceremony ) lol . 
  pkk almost used all the letters of the alphabet for creating another terrorist groups . 
  is n't palestinians only arab nation who sided with us in ww1 ? 
  we started a new trend apparently , 
  i think we must focus on `` kanal \u0130stanbul '' much more . 
  with this , turks will gain fully autonomy in bosporus . 
  actually , we can easily dismissed the montreaux convention . 
  who can really do something against this ? 
  but anyway , with kanal \u0130stanbul , bosporus will be more cleaner and we can gain a lot of money ... 
  '' * what are you sinking about ? 
  * '' - turkish navy to russian destroyer . 
  i have an idea to stop this ... just ^ look ^ at ^ my ^ flag, 
  [ me - ] ( https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/demn9uarabtfrdu3jlikv1ew3lvxajaovd-noazcstjqez8sbnwllwlwyrogime0cctko-hkgxxi-piu8mmum6otroccxa5u7-6ia5tbe_lbiw=w500-h213-nc ) when some people telling `` turkey support isis '' please , tell us `` we do n't want turks because genocide ( so-called ! ), 
  please , tell us `` we do n't want turks for cyprus '' please , tell us `` we do n't want turks because we just do n't like them '' ** but ** please , do n't say that `` turks supports isis lelelel '' bullshit !, 
  all this lies just increasing polorization between turks and europeans . 
  i do n't want to see turkey in eu ( like most of turks ) for economic reaseons but at least , we can cooperate . 
  but all this hate just make me sick . 
  all this cold attitudes just creating more erdo\u011fans . 
  actually , i said this for comments . 
  1 police also killed in this attack and one them seriously wounded . 
  i do n't know why nobody mentioned ? 
  and turks mostly sad for police that who died for protecting that man . 
  because tahir el\u00e7i said `` pkk is not terrorist group '' ... and he killed in terrorist attack ... 
  thanks to our sultan and caliph , abdul hamid ii . 
  even our caliphs are like that lol . 
  haram *, 
  in turkey , if someone reads anf , and take them seriously , we just call him `` idiot '' . 
  for anf , everyday , pkk kills 7181940492938 soldier that who raped and killed pregnant kurdish womans . 
  well , i want to make somethings clear . 
  hdp = nationslists of the kurds . 
  ( you can see some leftist turks ) they threatened people with pkk . 
  kurdish villages threatened by pkk [ for voting hdp ] ( http://sabahdai.ly/g1fjax ) their supporters killed islamist kurds ( one of them 16 years old ) with demirta\u015f 's call . 
  mhp = just turkish nationslists . 
  not extreme . 
  ( you can also see some kurds ) they are not threathing people for vote . 
  they do n't care that you are not turk . 
  they just see everyone as a turk culturally , so they are not ethnic nationalists . 
  if i am remember correctly , there is some armenians in mhp ( not mp ) . 
  and that sout koreans ... well it 's a really stupid . 
  think about which is extereme ... 
  i unhappily voted for mhp .
