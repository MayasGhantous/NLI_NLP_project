it contradicts with [ the first law of robotics ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/three_laws_of_robotics ) . 
   turkey and uk are already past the peak . 
  no we did not until we annex poland and try to invade russia . 
  it seems a bit off but nothing is impossible when you have erdolf on your side . 
  do i need to install a driver to run erdogan ? 
  better agree on a safe word . 
  bdsm can sometimes be very violent . 
  medium if maybe, 
  then there is a problem with this article . 
  i am not saying they are spreading false information on purpose but maybe it is coming from unreliable sources . 
  yes , that 's a fact . 
  but that does not mean any media around the world should be referred as the one and only truth . 
  we are in the age of manipulations . 
  sorry to interrupt but i have never seen apple tea anywhere in turkey except sultanahmet . 
  it is mostly a tourist thing . 
  people here usually drink locally produced black tea . 
  it is cheaper than coffee . 
  where is the [ technoviking ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8h4gkg-myq ) when you need him ? 
  when i see these kind of people i ca n't help myself but assume they are way more gay than any gay person i know of but ca n't even confess to themselves , so insecure with those funny feelings . 
  cool . 
  because it 's all up to your consideration . 
  i feel dumb . 
  can someone elaborate what gray areas stand for ? 
  i tried to make an assumption based on the correlations but turkey , iceland and switzerland does not seem to have anything in common . 
  no , he is the head of state . 
  that 's why [ the crosshair was mostly on him ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wwgenhi.jpg ) . 
  try searching [ `` karadeniz folklor '' ] ( https://youtu.be/sctzik_b99o?t=182 ) . 
  it probably has something to do with [ pontus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pontus_\\ ( region \\ ) ) . 
  it is obviously not photoshop . 
  i did n't know how small spanish are . 
  $ 50.000 to take a dump ? 
  nice catch . 
   edit : why the downvotes ? 
  probably triggered turks because of all this `` turkey is in europe '' vs. `` turkey is not in europe '' thingie . 
  you are safe . 
  these idiots might harm an indonesian by mistake though .

  i always wondered what is the reason behind the difference of crops between [ turkey-greece ] ( https://www.google.de/maps/@40.9065672,26.2801331,7246m/data=!3m1!1e3?hl=en ) border . 
  greece has smaller fields with more brownish color , turkey has bigger-greener fields . 
  it must be something to do with agricultural regulations . 
  there are more than 100 km 's between them . 
  [ but you can see lake van ( sevan ) from top of agri ( ararat ) mountain on a clear day i suppose . 
  ] ( https://earth.google.com/web/@39.72757673,44.33370286,5547.75424798a,0d,35y,-130.44275726h,89.655055t,0.00000085r ), 
  i do n't know much about this . 
  i am speculating based on the information provided by you . 
  if there was a cross originally , it should be there . 
  on the other hand this building should not be used as a church because of its historical values . 
  same goes with hagia sophia . 
  it should neither be a church nor mosque again . 
  where is erdo ? 
  it was harder to hear the speech from that point and there were some unnecessary separation bars in between . 
  that 's why the crowd gathered in the right side and the center . 
  and they built it regardless of the official environment report and without knowledge of local municipality . 
  it was totally lawless . 
  i do n't care the results . 
  it is a good place to run , sit and have a nice family day . 
  the problem is not related to what they build , it is a problem of how they build it . 
  as a side note erdogan government previously banned parties from bulgaria ( has a minority in turkey ) and trnc from rallying on turkish soil . 
  their arguments were similar to what austria & germany currently says . 
  `` do not bring your internal conflicts to this country '' . 
  sadly i can not find any links to support my claim . 
  it 's been a while and all the sources i rely on are now missing . 
  ** edit : ** [ the one about trnc ] ( http://www.abcgazetesi.com/erdogan-denktasa-boyle-demis-nicin-turkiyede-miting-yapiyorsun-46666h.htm ) ** edit2 : **  on 19 january 2013 , lyutfi mestan was elected as the second chairman of the movement for rights and freedoms . 
  [ 13 ] mestan was removed from power by the insistence of the founder dogan because he had declared support for turkey for the shot russian airplane , ** then erdo\u011fan blacklisted ahmed dogan banning him from entering turkey .

  the ad at the end was confusing . 
  i proof checked the measurements . 
  i was there and it seems correct . 
  many people get in and go out of the square multiple times . 
  maybe that 's how they counted 1.6 million from the counters . 
  that also explains how it 's impossible for akp to gather 2 million supporters at the same place in the past . 
  he has been the main opposition leader for some years . 
  and violent protest has never led to anything peaceful . 
  til : erdogan is chinese . 
  grades, 
   erdogan does not wield absolute power . 
  he got that power via that referendum . 
  and you know how its staged . 
  most of the dictators in the 20th . 
  century claim a nation support behind them . 
  look at moussolini , hitler , stalin ... 
  it 's no different . 
  he needs to make feel it legal . 
  this is how it works . 
  lets look at the situation . 
  * can he appoint juristiction ? 
  ( atamalar ) * can he pass bills without legislation of parliament support ? 
  ( khk ) * can he execute laws ? 
  ( police & military are tied to ministries ) you may like him . 
  i do n't care but `` g\u00f6te g\u00f6t demek lazim . '', 
  i am aware that there is an anti-kurd majority in turkey . 
  and i totally understand that because of the whole action-reaction psychology . 
  nobody is really innocent in this total clusterfuck . 
  that being said , i do n't believe there is a majority who supports a ban on any language . 
  ah , the old reddit [ putinaroooo ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/natureisfuckinglit/comments/6ltzke/footage_of_one_tree_over_365_days_bringing_out/djxbqp4/?context=3 ) . 
  i stated the fact that chp did not vote for penalising usage of the word `` kurdistan '' in the parliament . 
  that 's all i said . 
  correct me if i am wrong . 
  that 's what i read from the turkish sources . 
   with this particular decision,
