   hosting the people that had to flee from war to use them as a weapon against the european union nobody 's using it as a weapon . 
  as i said , turkey is already hosting 3 million refugees , it would be only fair if the eu took off some of the burden . 
  lucky for you , turkey still holds the refugees within ( or at least the vast majority of them ) . 
   you do n't need arguments here i was getting the feeling that you were n't interested in listening to others anyway . 
  you seem quite ignorant by doing this though . 
   a country that 's threatening european countries to send them millions of immigrants , that 's what it is . 
  well , look at it like this : turkey hosts 3 million refugees which it has no obligation to host . 
  that 's more than all of eu 's refugees . 
  turkey is paying a substantial amount of money to take care of these refugees though , and rightfully asks for assistance * because it can no longer take care of so many people . 
  * even your country , germany , so much wealthier than us , a greater population too , has issues hosting 800,000 refugees . 
  how can you expect us to host 4x that ? 
  so indeed , turkey is saying that they wo n't be stopping refugees from leaving if it comes to that . 
  turkey is no more obliged to host refugees than eu countries do . 
  it 's not a threat , it 's reality . 
  you should be thankful turkey is already hosting so many , imagine what would happen if turkey refused to take care of them . 
  your countries would be absolutely flooded , just like turkey is with syrian refugees . 
  fair enough , but i think it 's unfair to link putin to this . 
  pkk has been pulling stuff like this for years , long before the turko-russian tensions .

  at least come up with real arguments . 
  cyprus is in the eu . 
  literally no land in europe at all . 
  turkey has a population of 10 + million living in the european lands of turkey . 
  40-60 % of turkish people are european immigrants/descendants of european immigrants that immigrated after the ottoman empire was disbanded , that includes my family too , which all descended from modern day bulgaria , romania , macedonia and hungary . 
  to call turkey european is not wrong . 
  to call turkey asian is n't wrong either . 
  turkey is located in both continents , and has aspects of both worlds . 
  so you 're telling me putin went back in time and initiated all the pkk attacks that have been going for , what , 20 years ? 
  exactly . 
  for all the fucked up things that happen in my country , do n't we deserve some credit for at least being somewhat stable for the most part , being secular and being really the only liveable country in such a geographical mess ? 
  depends on how you look at it . 
  it 's partially in europe , so it 's partially european . 
  lots of european influence in this country , and from a historical perspective turkey is considered in the european theater since it is directly involved in so much of the european conflicts . 
  i can argue in favor of the former , what have you say for the latter ? 
  it 's somewhat popular . 
  a few of my relatives used to play it at quite a high level . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkey_national_handball_team https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_european_men%27s_handball_championship_qualification turkey has a decent team , i would say the turkish national team for handball is the equivalent of the russian national team in football , at least in europe . 
  edit : apparently this year we 're awful though . 
  oh my bad . 
  ca n't keep up with the new memes . 
   in my opinion , turkey is a very nice country with very reasonable people . 
  that 's kind of you , kinder than i think we deserve haha . 
  we 're not bright folks obviously , we elected erdo\u011fan as our president . 
  but as you said , it 's mostly not because we 're radicals but because we 're ignorant . 
  i do n't know how you feel about merkel and her policies , but i wish you guys the best . 
  unlike in turkey where you either hate or love erdo\u011fan , you guys seem to have very mixed opinions about her . 
  that 's a way to look at it . 
  for some reason though i do n't see many turkish people in syria escaping radicals , but i see three million syrians in turkey . 
  all about perspective though , i 'm sure you 're right in your own way . 
   even the media is being told not to describe the crimes committed by immigrants . 
  our sisters , daughters , mothers are being sexually assaulted and raped but as long as we do n't hurt their feelings that 's the main issue according to them . 
  hey i 'm not saying you 're wrong . 
  but just so you know , all liberals are left wing by definition . 
  left wing for you may be defined as `` a way to describe someone who is so far gone politically correct they are willing to sacrifice freedoms and the happiness of their own people to appease immigrants . '', 
  but in the real world that 's not what left wing stands for . 
  your definition for a left winger is so off and oddly specific . . not sure if you can see that yourself . 
  the economy is growing and all , but still we 're quite poor compared to most of western europe . 
  we 're not as poor as romania , serbia etc. 
  but a very large percentage of our people are living below the poverty line . 
  our economy is sustainable and promising for investments , but our gdp per capita is actually quite low . 
  i 'm not even a left winger , i 'm not butthurt . 
  i just find it stupid how many people feed their superiority complex by calling people with different opinions `` liberal cucks '' `` left wing idiots '' `` libtards '' etc. 
  there are better ways to get your point across . 
   yet all these left wing idiots yeah , it 's all left wing idiots . 
  must be fun being able to make a general consensus about every opinion you do n't like . 
  we 're among the poorest countries in europe . 
  it did n't really matter , our geographical location screwed us over anyway . 
  not nice bordering radical lunatics . 
  does n't look that bad to be honest . 
  if this is the ugliest place in sweden , you guys must have a very pretty country . 
  jesus i sounded like a dick . 
  support whoever you want who am i to tell you what to do haha sorry about that, 
  ah , fair enough . 
  well , i agree with you . 
   i even supported erdo\u011fan in the beginning much of europe did . 
  we were trying to tell you guys how much of a fucked up blood thirsty islamist maniac he was , but it did n't register for you until it was too late . 
  thanks for supporting him . 
  yeah we 're absolutely profiting from a swarm of middle-eastern refugees !, 
  i feel safer than ever on the streets too . 
  lovely logic . 
  i 'm sure that would work well !, 
  ( p.s. 
  many if not most syrian refugees go to europe from turkey through the aegean sea , not mediterranean ), 
  yeah , turkey 's totally not doing anything aside from hosting 3 million refugees , which by the way is twice as much as the refugees all eu countries hosts . 
  actually that 's when the first bombings against isis started . 
  read my edit , i seem to have edited it after you replied . 
  not every person living in the uk speaks english . 
  edit : this report includes only people who speak english `` well '' or `` very well '' , anything below does n't count . 
  many immigrants/expats speak english that one would consider bad english , but at a level high enough to communicate . 
  on top of that , even though these populations might 've entirely disappeared by now , in 2005 there were segregated welsh , irish and scottish communities that only spoke their original languages . 
  i think that 2 % is even a low figure for a big country like the uk . 
  i agree with you . 
  if you do n't love erdo\u011fan , you absolutely hate him . 
  mostly there is no middle ground . 
  i do n't know how it is in the netherlands but in turkey politics is a huge deal and nearly everyone has a strong opinion . 
  he claims credit for things he took no part in , things that would 've happened anyway . 
  not gon na go into detail but yeah , glad that you do n't like him . 
  most turkish people in the netherlands love him apparently . 
  do n't be . 
  it could be a lot worse , like it is with us .
