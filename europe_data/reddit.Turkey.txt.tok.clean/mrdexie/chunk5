  calling the ottoman empire turkey is 10x worse than calling ussr russia . 
  just because the ottoman empire was ruled by the turks does n't mean you can call it turkey . 
  ** i 'm copying and pasting my comment from elsewhere below . 
  i 'm by no means saying the ottomans were innocent and that they did nothing wrong - but the attempt to completely demonize it in a vilifying manner is absurd . 
  stop exaggerating or blatantly lying about historical facts . 
  **  as i wrote there - this was decades before the attack on ottoman muslims in the balkans . 
  by saying `` this '' , what exactly are you talking about ? 
  the aforementioned propaganda post that refers to 1876 ? 
  in that case , you 're wrong : more than 100,000 bulgarian turks/muslims have been forced to flee the country between the years 1881-1885 ( source : poulton , hugh ( 1997 ) . 
  muslim identity and the balkan state . 
  c. hurst & co. . publishers . 
  this number rises up to approx . 
  750,000 later on . 
   zero muslims were being massacred in bulgaria for 500 years so are you here implying that for those 500 years , there were continuous attacks on the christian population of bulgaria ? 
  i 'd love to see you cite a source for this . 
   islamisation of 2 regions - the rhodope mountains ... 
  while there must 've been coercion - no doubt - the coercion was limited . 
  scholars agree that a great extent of the islamization process was in fact voluntary - you had whole families converting due to reasons such as prestige . 
  here is an example : http://i.imgur.com/betx4cm.png ( source : conversion to islam in the balkans : kisve bahas\u0131 petitions and ottoman social life , 1670-1730 , page 75 ) moreover , the islamization of such areas largely consisted of native ottoman populations migrating into these areas . 
   with all those who refused butchered . 
  again , i 'm not saying coercion did not happen but it feels like you 're heavily exaggerating . 
  see , you may not be , but none of what you 've stated so far has been backed by any form of evidence . 
  i 'm not gon na take your word for it , especially not when as far as my research is concerned , you 're factually incorrect on many occasions . 
   many decades later were the very first mass expulsions of muslims from the balkans , and most did n't happen in bulgaria either . 
  ** really ? 
  in 1877-78 , when the northern bulgarian population attacked the muslim population ( as did russians in other parts of the country ) , half of the 1.5 million muslims in ~ ~ bulgaria ~ ~ balkans were forced to abandon their homes and flee elsewhere , 200,000 of which died directly as a result of the attacks . 
  the number of people died indirectly but due to being forced to abandon their homes is unknown .

  ridiculous . 
  and you get upvoted for this shit ? 
  your history teacher must be ashamed . 
  edit : go ahead and downvote .

  turkey did n't even exist back then . 
  you do realize the ottoman empire broke down into tens of countries ? 
  just because turkey is considered to be the successor does n't mean you can use ottoman empire/turkey interchangeably . 
  turkey has an entirely different demographic , political system and landmass . 
  i literally could n't find a single turk commenting anything negative/homophobic here . 
  i think you 're trying hard to put us in a bad light . 
  there is only one troll who claims homosexuality is unique to humans , but that 's hardly a homophobic statement , just an ignorant one , and he 's clearly trolling . 
  how can you even say `` every turk '' here ? 
  turkish redditors are among the most progressive because having a backwards conservative government pushes people to the other end of the spectrum . 
  you really need to justify your comment now . 
  older people in turkey tend to have a negative view of gay people . 
  this did n't surprise me . 
  i think the situation is better with younger people . 
  i\u0131\u0131\u0131\u0131\u0131\u0131, 
  oh okay , you 're not like the vast majority , good for you . 
  does n't take away the fact that most immigrants in germany migrated there in the late 90 's because germany was looking for physical workers . 
  they left their home country for economic opportunities . 
  trust me , if turkey was remotely as wealthy as germany and had the same prospects , nearly all of them would come back in a heartbeat . 
  good thing they do n't though , many of them are ignorant and backwards , and they refuse to change . 
  they have the same mentality they had when they immigrated - even though the people in their origin country change and adapt , diaspora ones do n't , which is why many of them are so troublesome . 
  cool idea and all but this whole thing is against the rules . 
  it is vote manipulation and brigading and it 's a nice way to get banned . 
  yup , sadly . 
  does n't mean he is a good president , he 's just a good manipulator . 
  majority of turks do not praise him . 
  it 's more like 35 % of them . 
  many turks like him though because they are uneducated and ignorant , and they fall for religious manipulations by erdogan . 
   they did n't hate you before ? 
  not really . 
  syria and iraq , and even iran aspired to be like us . 
  georgia and turkey got along well . 
  despite the differences and sometimes tensions , greece and turkey got along . 
  heck , greece was the first to come to turkey 's help in 99 i believe when turkey had a disastrous earthquake . 
  now greece hates us , syria and iraq absolutely hates us , as does iran . 
   turkey was on the bottom of the freedom of press a long time before erdogan any proof on this ?
