goodbye . 
  i voted for mhp . 
  i hope we will get rid of erdogan . 
  he was only 21 . , 
  better for me . 
  my grandfather is exchanger . 
  turkish intellectuals inspired france after revolution . 
  atat\u00fcrk is also someone of them . 
  north koreans are happy under kim jong-un . 
  it can be about reparations . 
  yes . 
  [ kangal dog ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lzbuzum.jpg ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kangal_dog, 
  torun means `` grandchild '' in turkish . 
  you can come to turkey .

  unfortunately . 
  turkish national anthem mentions three times about blood . 
  from second verse :  frown not , i beseech you , oh thou coy crescent !, 
    smile upon my heroic nation !, 
  why the anger , why the rage ? 
    our blood which we shed for you shall not be worthy otherwise ;   for freedom is the absolute right of my god-worshipping nation !, 
   from ninth verse :  for only then , shall my fatigued tombstone , if there is one , prostrate a thousand times in ecstasy ,   and tears of blood shall , oh lord , spill out from my every wound ,   and my lifeless body shall burst forth from the earth like an eternal spirit ,   perhaps only then , shall i peacefully ascend and at long last reach the heavens . 
  from tenth verse :  so ripple and wave like the bright dawning sky , oh thou glorious crescent ,   so that our every last drop of blood may finally be blessed and worthy !, 
    neither you nor my kin shall ever be extinguished !, 
    for freedom is the absolute right of my ever-free flag ;   for independence is the absolute right of my god-worshipping nation !,

  turkey 20/09/1928 - [ while our first president and national hero , mustafa kemal atat\u00fcrk was teaching new turkish alphabet ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ggvxmm4.jpg ) 18/06/1941 - [ german -- turkish non-aggression pact ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cnc09xd.jpg ) 1950-1953 - [ turkish soldiers at korean war ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ecd2vjx.jpg ) 12/09/1980 - [ 1980 turkish coup d'\u00e9tat - chief of the general staff general kenan evren 's coup speech ] ( http://i.imgur.com/z75c9vo.jpg ) 17/08/1999 - [ 1999 marmara earthquake ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jbpxums.jpg ), 
  i think it is china . 
  from central asia and almost 2000 years . 
  i need a stove . 
  we had a leader name is atat\u00fcrk . 
  he fighted against islamism . 
  he wanted seculer turkish people . 
  but he unfortunately could not completely . 
  i am so sorry for happening as a turk . 
  i think tayyip reads here :d, 
  happy independence day , 
  with syrtos . 
  in turkey , we say : `` turkey will be little america '' . 
  now , america is great turkey . 
  i think he is otto wels of turkey . 
  it is not hello kitty . 
  it an owl . 
  owl is symbol of [ incis\u00f6zl\u00fck ] ( http://www.incisozluk.com.tr/ ) . 
  it is like / b / of turkey . 
  erdogan and peace . 
  context : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/misak-%c4%b1_mill%c3%ae it was purpose of our independence war . 
  at ending of war turkey was like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mksy3lg.png ) in 1939 , [ hatay ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hatay_province ) was annexed by turkey with a referendum . 
  our borders of today . 
  ( except very small changings ) critising of lausanne by islamists is not a new thing . 
  they use it for annoying and insulting seculars in turkey . 
  we have 6 days for it . 
  i could not find any turkish source/report about this topic . 
  may this report a fake ? 
  mayor of batman wanted to sue christopher nolan in 2008 because of using name of city illegally . 
  but i think he could n't sue . 
  yes . 
  modernization of turkish people inspired france republics . 
  atat\u00fcrk read rousseau 's books . 
  atat\u00fcrk 's secularism goal is not only laicism . 
  also he tried to make a proper islam for turks . 
  rational , moderate one . 
  not only him . 
  almost all ottoman-turkish enlighteneds inspired french modernization and republics . 
  positivism , secularism , jacobinism , liberalism , democracy , nationalism etc. 
  all of them were opened . 
  finally . 
  ~ ~ google drive was opened . 
  others and github.com are still banned . ~ ~ edit : all of them were opened . 
  finally . 
  google drive blocking was removed . 
  i think they do not know reddit , yet . 
  you can access those websites with vpn or dns changing in turkey . 
  but still it is very annoying . 
  ~ ~ google drive was blocked , also . ~ ~ imgur has been blocked since april , 2015 . 
  many porn websites are blocked . 
  edit : google drive blocking was removed . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_preveza not old yet . 
  also putin and lukashenko . 
  maybe viktor orban . 
  and thank you for recognizing of turkey in europe :d, 
  i do not like erdogan . 
  he is not white . 
  we do not ride camels . 
  we are not ethnically arabs . 
  there is no desert in turkey . 
  ( except [ karap\u0131nar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/karap%c4%b1nar ) ) we use latin alphabet . 
  we do not know arabic . 
  we have own language . 
  it is turkish . 
  polygamy is illegal in turkey . 
  compulsory education is 12 years in turkey . 
  girls have to join it , too . 
  honestly , i do n't believe our place is in even asia . 
  because of development of south korea and japan . 
  probably , yes . 
  usually they say : `` they gave ( sometimes sold ) our islands . '', 
  yes . 
  i think they never heard chanak crisis . 
  you can explain it to them .
