  according to some of them ; atat\u00fcrk was a british agent . 
  because he wanted irreligious turkish people and british troops left \u0130stanbul without fight . 
   also turkey did n't `` give away '' those islands , they were taken by italy   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italo-turkish_war   and after ww2 were transferred to us   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_peace_with_italy,_1947   probably as a result of our contributions against italy in ww2 in the greco-italian war , and the fact they had a overwhelming greek majority . 
  i am not exactly sure , i do n't remember the reasons too well . 
  but the fact is they were not given by turkey according to erdo\u011fan and his supporters , those never happened . 
  according to them , \u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc and atat\u00fcrk gave islands to greece .

  actually turks began to use printingpress in 1729 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ibrahim_muteferrika#printing_press before of it only non-muslims in ottoman were used it . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/global_spread_of_the_printing_press#ottoman_empire  due to religious qualms , sultan bayezid ii and successors prohibited printing in arabic script in the ottoman empire from 1483 on penalty of death , but printing in other scripts was done by jews as well as the greek and armenian communities ( 1515 saloniki , 1554 bursa ( adrianople ) , 1552 belgrade , 1658 smyrna ) . 
  in 1727 , sultan achmed iii gave his permission for the establishment of the first legal print house for printing secular works in arabic script ( religious publications still remained forbidden ) , but printing activities did not really take off until the 19th century .
