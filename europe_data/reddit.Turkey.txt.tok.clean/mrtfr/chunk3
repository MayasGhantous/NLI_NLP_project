  winston churchil wanted joining of turkey to wwii against germany . 
  but president \u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc did not accept it until late era of war . 
  because of war people of turkey were starved and had difficulty in found the food . 
  after war , someday a kid said to \u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc : `` you left us as hungry . '', 
  \u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc said : `` yes , i left you as hungry .

  chp have social democrat and secular nationalist deputies . 
  this one is secular nationalist . 
  it is a good move actually . 
  now , erdogan and akp supporters can not insult him and no supporters about netherlands . 
  that 's good . 
  i wonder about who is next . 
  `` turuncu '' is color one , `` portakal '' is fruit one in turkish . 
  but i think akp supporters thought orange is as a fruit , not as a color . 
  william of orange , maybe . 
  one of the most contemptible events of turkish diplomatic history . 
  no surprise , it happened in akp era . 
  just threaten them with deportion .

  i think ^ is considered as a specific mark . 
  it is used for only 3 vowels . 
  ( \u00e2 , \u00fb , \u00ee ), 
   we used the \u00e2 until a few years ago and it just stuck . 
  it was not removed . 
  it is still used . 
  turkish has also \u00e2 . 
  it is not in alphabet . 
  but we still use it while writing . 
  edit : also it has \u00fb and \u00ee . 
  they are not in alphabet , too .
