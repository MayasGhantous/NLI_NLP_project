  why does crete have terrorists ? 
  do they want seperation ? 
  east thrace and \u0130zmir ( smyrna ) are most secular part of turkey .

  you are not sincere about it . 
  because you gave our too close 18 islands to greeks .

  rumlar means rums . 
  ( plural of rum ) https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/r%c3%bbm i think there is a mistake about title . 
  in turkey , republic of cyprus is known as `` rummic administration of southern cyprus '' . 
  shortly `` south cyprus '' . 
  then gib debt,

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/justice_and_development_party_ ( turkey )  `` ak part\u0130 '' ( in all capital letters ) is the self-declared abbreviation of the name of the party , as stated in article 3 of the party charter , while `` akp '' is mostly preferred by its opponents ; the supporters prefer `` ak part\u0130 '' since the word `` ak '' in turkish means `` white '' , `` clean '' , or `` unblemished , '' lending a positive impression . 
  the chief public prosecutor of the supreme court of appeals initially used `` akp '' , but after an objection from the party , `` akp '' was replaced with `` adalet ve kalk\u0131nma partisi '' ( without abbreviation ) in documents .

   the 1994 decree affirmed the genocide in the pontus region of asia minor and designated 19 may ( the day mustafa kemal landed in samsun in 1919 ) a day of commemoration , while the 1998 decree affirmed the genocide of greeks in asia minor as a whole and designated 14 september a day of commemoration . 
  98 years ago , mustafa kemal pasha and his colleagues came to [ samsun ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/samsun ) and initiated [ national resistance ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_national_movement ) .
