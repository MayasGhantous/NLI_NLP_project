i do not care about turkish `` honor '' in slightest . 
  you can do whatever you want with those backwards biker hobos . 
  that does not change the fact that kurds ok lets say pkk kurds like to throw their accusations whenever they feel like to demonize people or organisations who object them . 
  swedish police is fascist , am i right ? 
  ah the glorious kurdish victim complex whenever they throw a bomb here and there . 
  wait , is there a guy with a cowboy hat ? 
  im not surprised . 
  lost cause . 
  100 % right . 
  keep on dreaming . 
   even ** arabs ** are divided into good ones like ** egyptians ** and bad ones ** turks ** . 
   arab is n't ethnicity . 
  it is just loose therm used to group various ethnicities around middle east who commonly believe in allah . 
  it is n't any different from therm christiandom used 100s of years ago . 
  nice mental gymnastics for the justification of your shit . 
   even ** arabs ** are ** divided into ** good ones like ** egyptians ** and bad ones ** turks ** . 
  do i need to quote you again ? 
   even arabs are divided into good ones like egyptians and bad ones turks . 
  talking about identities and ethnicites ? 
   no they do n't . 
  the kurds are constantly deprived of basic liberties and cultural freedom . 
   i am sick and done with their religious backward culture  lmao , you ca n't be serious . 
  well , are you ? 
  you do not sound serious when your whole argument based on reddit memes . 
  wooosh , all these the_douche retards ' comments here .

  : ) ( at least for me . ), 
  lol this thread is great . 
  the irony of the turks calling poland backwards and irony of heavy racism of the comments towards turks . 
  it just needs one thread to leash out the hate towards certain ethnicities in / r/europe then all those civilised europeans channel their true positive feelings lmfao . 
  yeah turkish erasmus students are not the wisest bunch ( they for sure get extremely cocky when they step outside of the country ) tho i have a strong feeling that you are blowing this out of proportion or you are one of those extremely sensitive european kind or maybe there is a different interpretation from both sides , language barrier ? 
  because i have spent decent amount of time travelling europe . 
  whenever i dare to criticise something i have seen wrong regardeless which co\u0131untry i was in , the general sentiment was how i could stress something negative about their country as a turk . 
  anyway sorry about the rude guys whom you have encountered . 
   costantinopoli to turks instanbul . 
  silly , right ? 
  should be miklagard to vikings . 
  no to economical leach immigrants .

  same loyal followers who vote for leftists in europe ? 
  i doubt it but posibility among those hypocrites , yeah .

  exactly . 
  not for your team , mate . 
  what are we laughing at here ? 
  the commentator or the dutch national football team ? 
  yes . 
  i like half of them . 
  rest of the world does not need deep fried buttered murican shit , you wannabe fatty . 
  lol, 
  your posts . 
  honestly , you are fucking boring . 
  preaching for eye for an eye treatment in europe is so fucking ignorant , amazing you can remain like this . 
  have a nice day . 
  fuck the turkish police . 
  dude , you are a lost cause if your comparison base is turkish police and government . 
  proven that you are not a slight different than erdogan and his cult members . 
   i 'm approving violence used by the police . 
   i do n't see any problem with them . 
  we know . 
  i have a problem with everyone who cheers for violence including so called europeans and erdogan comars . 
   whatever values you have , there is a line to cross from where you have to expect ** reaction ** . 
  yeah , cool buddy . 
  and you are proud of being european and embracing western values ? 
  people like you are fucking hypocrites with a different birth places . 
  if you were turkish you 'd be one of those erdogan supporting idiots . 
  but then again you are the people who wants to bend and change the rules to sink the boats whenever you are not comfortable with the problems . 
  it is great to see how the moderation let these disgusting double faced violent treatment calls against turks . 
  i did not say they were wrong . 
  that does not change the fact that they are perfectly playing to his hand as i said . 
  good for you . 
  does not change the fact that you are serving him tho . 
  thanks guys . 
  guess , we will see erdogan as neo sultan in a month for sure . 
  you all playing to his hand perfectly . 
  edit : lol your country , your problem parrotting . 
  no shit ? 
  he said `` roaches are hated here . '' . 
  and bla bla . 
   you are only labeled as terrorist if you are `` protesting '' in a pkk rally . 
  saying , i will vote for `` no '' is completely fine . 
   more bullshit in your mind jog off . 
  i do not give a flying fuck if you are offended or not or to debate with your kind , properly ; everyone realize what you are . 
  you should embrace what you are .
