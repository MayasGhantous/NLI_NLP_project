  military officials who were members of fetullah 's cult . 
  back in the time when erdogan and fetullah were buddy buddies ; they have spread to army , government departments , universities , etc. 
  like vermin . 
  so yeah islamists . 
  you think that fetullah is some kind of progressive figure ? 
  it most probably was not staged . 
  dumb islamists failed to coup , less dumb islamists used it for their favour . 
  edit : lol downvotes . 
  siding with fetullah now , my fellow westerners ? 
  not a thing that you are not used to anyway , supporting liberal islamists ( ! ), 
   you can try to diminish his role at coup attempt as much as you want to demonize the neo sultan . 
  that does not change the facts tho . 
  people should realize that turkey is a big country with cultural variety . 
  i am not gon na state that whole turks are absolutely and always similar to greeks . 
  because which turks ? 
  we are not even similar per the region within the country . 
  but if you claim that there is absolutely nothing in common with aegan coast and eastern thrace turks with greeks , you are : a ) moron . 
  like the specific moron in this thread . 
  lol, 
  yo my boy mindalero , have you ever been to aegen coast of turkey or eastern thrace ?

  to me that is the most worrysome issue for the country . 
  they are shaping the young generation with ignorance and dogmatic shit . 
  cheers !, 
  just enjoy the fall of the caliphate . 
   but that is not what ** i ** ** think ** ** so ** . 
  good , so the sub remains as r/europe and turkey is gon na be mentioned . 
  enjoy . 
  muh erdogan , the moderate islamic leader who has made turkey a true liberal regional powerhouse and got rid of the status quo mindset of kemalists .

   many people will agree that the most `` westernized '' places of turkey are istanbul  the other regions of turkey vote for the dictator erdogan lol and talking about westernization and this ;  except for the kurdish regions lmfao . 
   ` westernized '' turks are those of istanbul and maybe smyrna . 
  nice try to diminish the westernized turks only to balkan turks and cities of notorious greek origin . 
  no one buys it tho except your deluded mind . 
   little bro . 
  do you even properly claim and source little bro ? 
  check your claim , source and make your own deduction . 
  do not dig deep , just check the cities . 
  dude , i probably will give you a gold at some point . 
  you amuse me a lot . 
   '' westernized '' turks are those of istanbul and maybe smyrna . 
  many of them are descended from countries like bosnia , bulgaria , albania dude , why are you always saying stuff which you have zero clue about . 
   no such thing as liberal turks . 
  laughing stock delivers again . 
  also [ these ] ( http://balticguide.ee/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/bg0314_36_pic_ollevorstid_test_f_ach_17-1024x608.jpg ) ? 
  i guess seeds are not listed for us because they are full time treats . 
  hahahahah so funny . 
  there is only one delusional greek here who hates serbs and i guess he is actually a turk and name is talat ( :p ) but he posts under the alias of mindalero . 
  he is my man tho , makes me laugh a lot . 
   you still do n't represent some kind of greek hivemind . 
  i 'm guessing you 're a diaspora greek that got bullied for being brown in school and now is on a quest to prove yourself .
