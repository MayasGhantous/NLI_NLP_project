when i was around 11-12yo i memorized whole lyrics . 
  every . 
  word . 
  * a final ultimatum to poland * suspend eu funds for cohesion , agriculture , infrastructure etc * strip voting rights of poland * suspend polish membership * expel poland from the eu this can be a very simple outline of the actions which the eu should take . 
  otherwise polish government 's gon na hurt both herself and the eu very badly . 
  other visegrad countries can cause trouble with these actions but macron and merkel should find a solution for it too . 
  of course there is a possibility of back-firing of these actions by suppressing the opposition in hungary and poland more than ever . 
  sad . 
  it 's like rewatching the erosion of democracy in turkey from 2007 til 2017 . 
  i wish poland had never chose this dangerous path . 
  the eu must do something . 
  i thought i made myself clear when i said one can not expect from turkey to withdraw its troops completely . 
  ok youre right im sorry i saw my mistake after your hilarious comment i realized how i misread the history, 
  hellenoturkism can be a solution either . 
  let 's create a helleno-turkish confederation and name it ** the eastern rum empire v2 .0 **, 
   turkey didnt exist 100 years ago so you never suffered from the turkish tyranny ? 
   you contradict yourself . 
  i quickly found a turkish [ source ] ( http://www.dw.com/tr/t%c3%bcrkiyeden-k%c4%b1br%c4%b1s-g%c3%b6r%c3%bc%c5%9fmelerinde-yeni-teklif/a-39486808 ) . 
  turkey suggested withdrawing its soldiers but not all of them , to the same extent of the greek soldiers . 
  turks wanted a schedule for withdrawal . 
  greeks wanted troops to leave after the day of unification . 
  no you do n't seem to understand correctly . 
   danzig is a german city . 
  why should n't it be a part of the third reich ? 
  lol . 
  german logic never dies . 
  we are talking about military existence of turkey on the island . 
  i mentioned stategic location of cyprus . 
  if greece were in asia minor , it would do the same thing as we do . 
   what the vast majority of cyprus also wanted fair enough . 
  for the records , withdrawal of the army was on the table in crans montana . 
  you have no idea . 
  [ fuuuuuuuu ] ( http://orig03.deviantart.net/55aa/f/2011/312/e/d/profile_picture_by_fuuu_plz-d4fkm9r.png ) did they have * a little problem * ? 
  ooooo sweet greeks ... they deserve better . 
  of course they have * a little problem * with peace plans ... they can accept it first then they can reject it in referendum . 
  turks can wait . 
  greece is n't after any interests on the island because it 's always better to have two votes in the european council and in the un . 
  greece did n't want to have military on the island , instead , it wanted to ** annex ** it . 
  welcome to the real world . 
  does greece border middle east ? 
  if the greeks were in our shoes they would go beast mode for a full annexation . 
  when i read your comment above once again my brain hurts . 
  plz delete it . 
  we try to find a solution and i suggested sth . 
  it does n't have to be approved . 
  but really you ca n't expect turkish withdrawal . 
  they want a federal republic . 
  greeks do n't want it . 
  there can be no solution in these circumstances . 
  what will the turks do ? 
  leave the island ? 
  do n't make yourself fool . 
  they will accept annexation if the greeks insist to reject peace plans . 
  i think you missed the part that the turks accepted annan plan and the greeks rejected it . 
  srebrenica is a shame . 
  it 's all about power , baby . 
  turkey ruled these cities over centuries . 
  greece did n't rule cyprus for ... wait ... greece never ruled over cyprus . 
  anyways . 
  kurdish minority in turkey suffered a lot . 
  it 's another topic . 
  we do n't need to do that at that moment . 
  omg did you really say that ? 
  i felt sorry for your family . 
  rip logic and brain . 
  read the history of cyprus all over again . 
  please . 
  like please . 
  lol they will . 
  hell yeah there are shits of reasons for that . 
  cyprus is like a natural aircraft carrier in the middle of the eastern mediterranean . 
  no country would leave it except stupid ones . 
  it has a strategic location and even israel tries to develop its relations with cyprus . 
  for expecting turkish withdraw one must be a communist hippie world peace dreamer which is against nuclear energy and argues disarmament of the nations . 
  false analogy . 
  problem is here long before erdo\u011fan . 
  do n't personalize it . 
  how about annexation of northern cyprus to turkey ? 
  a ) greeks wanted enosis . 
  turks responded . 
  b ) i meant the first and second phases of the operation in 1974 . c ) i think the solution is quite simple . 
  turkey should have a sovereign military base on the north of island like the uk bases . 
  greece can have a base too if it wants . 
  thus they can maintain their existances on the island and at the same time there ca n't be even a single soldier of them in the federal republic . 
  problem solved , 
  yes . 
  after greek coup d'etat which aimed the annexation of the island to greece . 
  operation attila had international legal justification by guarantee agreement between the uk , greece and turkey . 
  no one argues that . 
  what turkey did wrong was making a 2nd military operation and proclaiming another state on the island . 
  instead turkey could support statue quo and it could de facto control the north of island until we come up with a solution , that means until july 2017 ... 
  one of my erdo\u011fanist relative claimed vodafone is owned by chp ( social democrat main opposition party ) and it tries to overthrow erdo\u011fan by raising monthly cost . 
  congratulations poland !, 
  you have your own erdo\u011fan . 
  kaczy\u0144ski can say everything he wants . 
  erdo\u011fan accuses fet\u00f6 for everything . 
  get ready for your version of erdo\u011fan and his fanboys . 
  i wonder macron 's rank in forbes ' the world 's most powerful people list 2017 . 
  he can be in top 5 . 
  like 1st being putin , 2nd trump , 3rd merkel , 4th the pope or xi jinping and 5th macron .
