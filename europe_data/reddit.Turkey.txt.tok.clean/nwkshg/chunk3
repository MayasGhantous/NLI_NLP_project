  according to an independent public poll 91 % of people want to keep secularism in constitution . 
  islamists are small minority here . 
  secularism is n't under threat in turkey . 
  erdogan is our putin , not humeyni . 
   the black turks were the underdogs , while the white turks were the racists who despised them . 
  jenny white writes , `` the term ` black turk ' is used by kemalists to disparage turks of lower-class or peasant heritage , who are considered to be uncivilized , patriarchal , not modern , and mired in islam , even if they have moved into the middle class . '' erdo\u011fan proudly declared that he was a black turk . 
  its more like the other way around . 
  the term `` white turks '' first used by conservatives to mock `` elitist '' kemalists . 
  also it 's nothing to do with racism . 
  people of black sea region are whitest in turkey , a lot of blondes there . 
  they are usually religious . 
  btw kemalists , educated middle class , do n't say `` i am an elite . 
  respect me ! '' . 
  they say `` get a good education and embrace modern ideas like secularism , democracy , gender equality etc. 
  and become an elite like me . '' . 
  these are well-known . 
  i think you have an agenda , you are n't honest . 
  `` evil kemalists are oppressing , bullying poor religious muslims . '', 
  this is n't true . 
  you do n't get it . 
  only europeans can be humanitarian . 
  humanism is an european value . 
  europeans are n't bunch of greedy , selfish , hypocritical racists as this crises proved . 
  [ this ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/a/a9/minimum_wages%2c_january_2016_%28%c2%b9%29_%28eur_per_month%29_yb16-ii.png ) should answer your question . 
  europeans keep pushing certain minorities away while telling them come closer . 
  it works pretty good in us . 
  you know , the superpower !, 
  i think we have a kurdish mod . 
   you ca n't get a decent living condition if you are working for minimum wage same goes for most developed countries . 
  europe is n't land of milk and honey like we believe . 
  there is a reason why our diaspora is coming back . 
  libya operation is n't something to brag about . 
  libya is a terror camp now thanks to nato . 
  we also fight in packs and use sharp stuff during fight . 
  * bombing terrorists, 
   synadinos during the ep plenum used racist rhetoric against the turks saying ` they are barbarians and dirty , they are just like barking dogs and when the enemy returns they back up ' . 
  that 's not surprising though . 
  nationalism is mostly based on turkophobia in balkan countries . 
  if i were eastern european i would worry about emigration , not immigration . 
  eu is trying make deal with a state which houses 3 million refugees while their eastern european members are complaining about non-existent refugees in their countries and hijacking negotiations for their racist agenda . 
  what makes ukraine more eligible than turkey for visa-free agreement except being `` white '' non-muslims ? 
  alcoholism , hard drug use , aids etc. 
  are common in ukraine . 
  their homicide rates 2 times higher than turkey . 
  there is a war going on there . 
  they are 3 times poorer than turks . 
  they are much more prone to illegal mass migration and more likely cause trouble in other countries . 
  turkey is n't asking for ransom . 
  eu is trying to bribe turkey . 
  if eu wants turkey to do their dirty job , they should be more generous . 
  la liga is more popular than any other foreign league in turkey . 
  what 's next ? 
  `` press freedom '' award to erdogan , `` lgbt rights '' award to putin !, 
  the term `` ethnic cleansing '' was first used when describing how the turks of belgrade were forced out or killed . 
  i like how it is only a stupid internet joke while ethnic cleansing of ottoman christians is worst thing ever in history . 
  austria passed a law which forbids foreign funding of mosques . 
  we have similar law in turkey too . 
  other countries should do the same . 
  wahhabi mosques are main source of radicalization among muslims . 
  read this and educate yourself . 
   are the priests payed by the state in the us ? 
  is there a ministry of religion ? 
  that was introduced by kemalists to prevent radicalization . 
  it 's state 's way of saying if you are gon na be religious , you are gon na do it the way i tell you . 
  turkey adopted french secularism . 
  it is n't as liberal and passive as american secularism . 
  state tries to tame religion . 
  that 's why i said turkey is more secular than us . 
   is there support for isis ? 
  stop getting your news from rt. 
  they created it . 
  economic sanctions caused instability and weakened the regime . 
  not everything is about religion . 
  this raid is politic . 
  turkey is still secular , more secular than us . 
  i wonder if they would shout same thing if performer was english , french etc. 
  lol . 
  most turkish redditors dislike erdogan more than you do . 
  go / r/turkey , see it yourself . 
  what are we supposed to do ? 
  put a police officer in every house !, 
  we put them in jail when we catch them instead of whining on internet like you . 
  age of consent is 15 in turkey . 
  those are usually unofficial teenage marriages . 
  they are illegal . 
  [ 17 years old boy was jailed because of marriage with 14 years old girl . 
  i would n't surprised actual number is higher though . 
  those `` marriages '' are common in rural southeastern turkey where police control is somewhat limited because of kurdish separatist terror . 
  they usually catch them when they come hospital for birth . 
  there is no nato . 
  only us and her interests !, 
  turkey is much more valuable than any european country in that regard . 
  do n't european countries have laws against child abuse ? 
  why is this a matter of debate ? 
  just put them in jail . 
  that 's what we do in turkey . 
  m\u0130t should do this more often . 
  europe is safe haven for terrorists . 
  m\u0130t should do this more often . 
  europe is safe haven for terrorists .
