crema alle nocciole novi , where can i find this stuff in canada ? 
  and a turk 's head, 
  really ? 
  the entire name is turkish, 
  plov , sounds like pilav means rice in turkish, 
  what about doner kebab ? 
  yep , turkey came in 2 ^ nd, 
  it might be fake friendly , but at least they are not throwing racist slurs at each other and boasting about how they kicked each others ass in such and such date . 
  politicians act more friendly towards each other than the people, 
  that happened too a lot of minorities not just albanians, 
  i 'd say quality for the price you pay . 
  it 's not by accident . 
  the term was reinvented to be `` all-inclusive '' for other ethnic groups within turkey back when akp was trying to appease to the kurdish voters . 
  no you 're right it actually translates to son of a hater, 
  i think if nationalists in both our countries ( i.e. 
  grey wolves , golden dawn , etc ) just fucked off it would be so much beneficial for both countries and we can set a good example to other countries in the region as well if we work together to unify cyprus . 
  [ relevant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8lat5iiwo4 ), 
  did n't know turkey bought a lot of ` made in china ' . 
  could be be because of the value of its currency ? 
  well , there is indoor slippers and outdoor slippers to prevent cross contamination . 
  we also do n't want your filthy feet/socks touching our floors, 
   had no problem finding crossfit boxes last time i traveled to turkey . 
  talking about something like the ymca where you can sign up for a membership and they have a gym , pool , basketball court , yoga room , etc. 
  maybe i ran into the exception , not the rule, 
   greece no turkey either :(, 
  do we ? 
  its standard procedure, 
  hurry before the currency becomes worthless, 
  wait , i thought you were irish this whole time . . 
  now you guys can understand why erdogan keeps being elected . 
   btw , what 's the deal with deodorant ? 
  is it a cultural lack of habit or is there something else i 'm missing ? 
  i would guess its a lack of habit . 
  although its probably gaining traction with the younger generation . 
  speaking from experience back in 2011 i was in turkey in the city bus during the month of september and man did it smell b.o. 
  i even read an article about a foreign soccer player complaining how his team mates do n't use deodorant . 
  another situation was when i pulled out a deodorant from my backpack and this kid was looking at me like `` you put those on ? '', 
  and assumed we do n't shower often in the west hence why we would need such things like deodorant , perfume , etc. 
  third reason is , most people are n't very active in turkey . 
  sure we play street soccer as kids but there was n't a lot of gyms or places you can go to do physical activity like in the west . 
  so , there is n't much purpose to it although my experience on the bus would say otherwise . 
   i always believed it to be clear that hygene was introduced by ( enlightened ) islam it is . 
  maybe its not as popular as i thought but some anti-turkish people spread the idea of `` hairy & dirty turks invading europe '' etc. . etc. . . 
   i thought this was common knowledge ? 
  that turks are clean or dirty ? 
  yea , contrary to popular beliefs we turks are very clean . 
  we will even make you wear slippers around the house . 
  we just do n't believe in deodorant , that 's all . 
  there was a picture in r/turkey where it showed the pencil and eraser ( used to write countrywide university entrance exams ) and it said ` made in germany ', 
  its a portuguese last name , no ? 
  you wash your hands regardless, 
  what about [ ummet ozcan ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gc0sjozzt9u ) for turkey ? 
  united we stand , divided we fall ... 
  you realize he is a soccer player right . 
  it 's not fair because at the end turkey won the war . 
  treaty of sevres would have been as fair as it gets to make everyone happy in exchange for certain key areas of course . 
  you ca n't say `` no one '' you can only speak for yourself . 
  by the looks of it , this sub has a lot of anti-turkish elements, 
  wow , and this gets up votes in this sub ? . 
  looks like nobody here like facts when it comes to turk bashing . 
  look up ber\u00e7 keresteciyan and tell me there were no armenians lefts in 1920 . 
  check out meral aksener , she is a politician from mhp who is very defiant against its leader for being a sellout . 
  she is also very resilient towards all the attempts to keep her quiet so far . 
  pffft , nothing beats [ london ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/london,_ontario ), 
  not really , we all know the general opinion on this sub regarding the 1915 events so most of us do n't even bother . 
  plus , just because a topic is about armenia does n't mean we have to bring up `` genocide '' all the time . 
  is that all they 're known for ? 
  yea , maybe next time, 
  do you honestly think you 're fucking funny , fucking with my friends ? 
  seriously , you 're a fucking ugly little cunt mate , and if i ever see you i 'm gunna slit your fucking face wide open yeh ? 
  you 're a fucking angry little fucking spastic . 
  ok , right , let 's , first off , uhh you 're seventeen so you 're not even old enough to play the game , you 're from scotland not nigeria and you annoy people and put them on youtube ` cos you 're a cunt , which i totally agree with . 
  so why do n't you crawl back up your mum 's fanny and die ? 
  right , i 'll tell you what , you fat little cunt , you 're borin ' you do n't sound nigerian at all so go fuck yourself ... go and fucking crawl in a dirty dank little hole where you fucking come from , you dirty dragon eatin ' little fucking spastic . 
  right , ok , the ` dragon ' comment was probably a little bit fucking over-the-top , but at the end of the day you 're fucking borin ' . 
  every single person who watches your videos are fucking stoopid . 
  they 're fucking ignorant little cunts . 
  and you 're just a fucking retard . 
  man , we must 've really f 'd up the balkans . 
  nobody knows who they like anymore . 
  bosnian vs serbs , croatians vs serbs , serbs vs albanians , bosnians vs croatians , etc. 
  even albanians hate turks while some support us . 
  wait so you guys like serbia ? 
  where are you guys getting these ? 
  is there r/commentgore ? 
  turkey accused netherlands in playing a role in srebrenica . 
  goes back when the serbians dressed as dutch peacekeepers massacred bosnians . 
  america second this time, 
  that sucks for erdogan when europe prefers assad over you, 
  and what about turkey , what direction is turkey going ? 
  it is estimated that one and a half million armenians perished between 1915 and 1923 . 
  ** there were an estimated two million armenians living in the ottoman empire on the eve of w.w.i. 
  ** well over a million were ** deported ** in 1915 . 
  ** hundreds of thousands ** were butchered outright . 
  many others died of ** starvation , exhaustion , and epidemics ** which ravaged the concentration camps . 
  among the armenians living along the periphery of the ottoman empire many at first escaped the fate of their countrymen in the central provinces of turkey . 
  tens of thousands in the east fled to the russian border to lead a precarious existence as refugees . 
  the majority of the armenians in constantinople , the capital city , ** were spared deportation . 
  ** in 1918 , however , the young turk regime took the war into the caucasus , where approximately 1,800,000 armenians lived under russian dominion . 
  ottoman forces advancing through east armenia and azerbaijan here too engaged in systematic massacres .
