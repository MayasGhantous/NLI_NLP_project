  the expulsions and massacres carried by the nationalist turks between 1920 and 1922 added tens of thousands of more victims . 
  by 1923 the entire landmass of asia minor and historic west armenia had been expunged of its armenian population . 
  the destruction of the armenian communities in this part of the world was total . 
  according to your sources the turkish figures are more correct, 
  they ~ ~ did n't ~ ~ could n't kill 1.5 mil civilians ... assuming that 's the number that armenians died . 
  of course the whole `` freedom '' argument . 
  everyone is a freedom fighter and a good guy according to themselves . 
  that does n't excuse what they 've done to achieve this `` freedom '' . 
  every action has an opposite reaction . 
  where are you pulling the figures from ? 
  of course , i am the savage now . 
  that was your whole goal from the beginning . 
  you want me to forget what the armenian side has done to my ancestors and get on all 4 legs to apologize to armenians forever just like germans did after they lost ww2 . 
  we try to be nice and acknowledge the fact that it was massacre but you want to take it to next level . 
  armenians are obviously angry they did n't get what they want . 
  this generation of armenians are obviously brainwashed to think that turks are out to exterminate them for no reason . 
  so tell me what should turks do to completely put this case aside ? 
   yes , they tried to do it and it was 101 % justify . 
  and it was 102 % fail . 
  which is why you 're here crying about genocide today just like them . 
   suddenly when over 2 million people leave their fields and towns to fallow oh so it 's two million now ? 
  at first it was 1 million then 1.5 million the numbers seem the be increasing by 500,000 every time, 
  what about belgium ? 
   like i said , ironic . 
  you used the kurds to get rid of one ` problem ' and now you ca n't get rid of kurds who 've become a ` problem ' . 
  the kurds themselves seized the opportunity to gain more property and territory . 
  the problems arose between turks and kurds after the collapse of the ottoman empire when the treaty of sevres was replaced by treaty of lausanne and sykes-picot agreement leaving them with no country of their own . 
  the area referred to as kurdistan consists of land claimed by armenians and assyrians . 
  obviously your going to go with armenian numbers of casualties ( despite the fact that there would basically be no armenian left today ) . 
  those armenians were relocated from sensitive areas where they launch attacks on turkish troops on supply lines making it difficult for turkish troops on the front lines . 
  turks and armenians lived under the ottoman empire for 600 years where they spoke their own language and practice their own religion . 
  the massacres took place by ottoman troops and kurdish irregulars seeking ** revenge ** on what happened to them . 
  although i do n't condone it must 've happened for a reason , no ? 
   not to mention that armenians were figthing for their freedom and for their land . 
  land that was their home long before your hordes from hell arrived . 
  nice , really nice . 
  theres the problem right there , can we all just admit armenians tried to seize the opportunity to pull the carpet from the ottoman empire 's feet when the empie was at its weakest point . 
   with your kurdish problem i suggest only deporting . 
  at least , you wo n't have a excuse to use the kurdish issue now . 
  there was no turkey and the places they were relocated to was still part of the ottoman empire at the time . 
  which is why syria and lebanon has a sizeable armenian population today . 
   this u/onceuponacrime1 neoottomanist guy strawman arguments is what you resort to . 
   because you see the huge armenian army was going to remove the peaceful turkish population this huge armenian army was backed by russians and constantly looked for opportunities to collaborate with foreign invaders . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_armenian_legion https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armenian_volunteer_units ~ ~ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armenische_legion~~ oops , wrong date, 
  well i understand where you 're coming from but it is unfortunately you europeans that do n't understand the nature of this topic . 
  it does n't end with apologies and acknowledgement because we already did that numerous times without success . 
  [ erdogan offers condolences ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27131543 ) or even ataturk the founder of republic of turkey admitted the massacres were the fault of ottomans poor policy towards armenians . 
  they ( armenians ) obviously will not rest until we use the magic term genocide and even then it will not end there . 
  they will not stop until they get eastern provinces of turkey which in reality is what started this conflict in the first place . 
  they will achieve this either by military or diplomatic pressure ( like they are doing with this armenian genocide issue ) . 
  ** tl-dr ** this is n't going to be over by `` apologize and move on '' like many non-armenians assume . 
  most of the massacres were done by the hands of ottoman kurds who now call that land kurdistan, 
  this u/smokcho guy basically told me the ottoman muslim deaths in ww1 did not matter and was just an `` excuse '' to commit genocide on armenians . 
  do n't take him seriously . 
  listen , fuck you , fuck hunchak and dashnaksutyun for starting a war they lost , fuck asala for their failed attempt of revenge , fuck your feeling as well because you know why ? 
   and you cry about persecutions towards the ottoman oppresor ? 
  no and no . 
  this tells me you do n't care about ottoman deaths , ottoman muslim lives are not important to you and if armenia was strong enough they would cross that border in no time to massacre turks just like they did in khojali against azeri civilians in 1992 and you would cheer them on . 
  i do n't care if you 're sick . 
  i was n't the one who brought up the topic . 
  i am not going to change our memories and insult my ancestors for no reason to comfort some armenians and europeans no matter what . 
  i am trying to be as kind as possible about this topic by saying we acknowledge the massacres inflicted on armenians . 
  obviously that is not enough for some people for obvious reasons . 
  you 're the one trivializing the death of ottoman muslims trying to pass it off as some kind of `` excuse '' to start a so called genocide . 
  i am not going to continue talking about this topic with someone not open minded about it because i already now you have a predetermined outcome of how you want this discussion to end . 
  i 'll just post this here in the mean time you take some nausea medication https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/persecution_of_ottoman_muslims, 
  but how do you prove the intent was to `` destroy armenians in part or whole '' in this case ? 
  keep in mind the places they were located to were still part of ottoman empire at that time and many muslim ottomans suffered massacres under the hands of armenians and russians as well . 
  as a turk , i would like to apologize on behalf of my countrymen . 
  they are just not mature enough to think these through and looking at the pictures they look like kids in a grownups body . 
  ironically , they are singing the kemalist national anthem of turkey . 
  i say it 's ironic because ataturk was ** very ** against the burning of any flag even if it was your enemies flag . 
  there 's a story when he entered izmir someone laid a greek flag for him to step on ( in response to venizelos ) and he ordered them to pick it up off the floor, 
   i especially feel for turks on this sub , because now everyone will just generalise turks with these idiots . 
  that 's exactly what 's happening . 
  remember , some people really hate us turks so its a field day for them, 
  kat is a drug they eat in yemen , no ? 
  why does it have to be referred to as `` genocide '' anyways ? 
  why ca n't we all call it massacres and move on with our lives ? 
  ataturk even admitted that ottomans were at fault for the poor treatment of christians , erdogan even apoligized for the mistakes and `` shared pain '' that took place . 
  do we have to give eastern turkey to armenians to get them off our backs ? 
  because , that 's what started these massacres in the first place . 
  they massacred us and we massacred them back . 
  i know if armenia had a big enough army today they will not hesitate to cross the border . 
  do i have to accept it when asala massacred turks in revenge ? 
  because , that 's exactly the attitude ottoman soldiers had when massacring armenians . 
  when is this revenge game going to stop . 
   you do n't kill more than a million people by accident . 
  so iraq war was genocide then ? 
  what about japanese internment camps or hiroshima and nagasaki ? 
  are these genocides also ? 
  how are you certain the number is 1 million ? 
  my bad , i went to a catholic high school and my guidance cuinsellor was dutch . 
  she was smoking hot, 
  for that to be the case there has to be intent . 
  there is no concrete evidence the intent was to exterminate armenians . 
  quite the contrary , the decision to relocate armenians from sensitive areas was to prevent further conflict and distruption to the supply lines . 
  the massacres were a result of unruly officers and irregulars seeking revenge for what happened to their side by armenians and russians . 
  does n't mean the government ordered it to be that way . 
  there with even turkish court martials alongside the malta tribunals to try those responsible for the killings and ataturk even blamed the previous ottoman government of mistreatment and mishandling of the situation leading to the deaths of christian minorities .
