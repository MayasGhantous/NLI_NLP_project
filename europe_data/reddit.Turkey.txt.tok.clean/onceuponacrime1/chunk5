  many kurds still vote for him to this day . 
  i met an iraqi kurd who even defends him . 
  you can , no one else will touch that shit . 
  give it some time , basketball will catch up . 
  for sure . 
  the euroleague final 2017 played in istanbul in which fenerbahce beat oylmpiakos 80-64 to become champions, 
   it is the youth wing of mhp which does have seats in the turkish parliament with dozens of millions of supporters . 
  yeah but it does n't have much say in politics . 
  also mhp does n't even have a lot of seats in parliament . 
  where as golden dawn was the actual political party . 
   eoka fought against british imperialism , self determination . 
  yeah , that what they say about the grey wolves , tmt , hamas , hezbollah , etc. 
   it did n't massacre turks anymore than the turks seeking division and ethnic cleansing of greek majority lands killed greeks . 
  trouble only started after britain created turkish police forces , turkey massacred its greek population in 1955 and demanded to control the island in spite of its population and history . 
  ok , this is just going to be a back and forth `` chicken or the egg '' argument . 
  if that 's what they teach you at school then they are not telling the truth . 
  turkey had no interest in the island and the reason they invaded 1/3 is to create a safe space for turkish cypriots to live . 
  turkey also did not `` seek division '' as they are still more willing to talk about the unification process more than their greek counterparts . 
  it was all because the military junta in greece wanted to overthrow the makarios government to have full control over the island . 
  golden dawn has 17 seats in the hellenic parliament whereas the grey wolves have no seats in turkish parliament are an underground organization at best . 
  also , golden dawn is n't the only fascist greek group . 
  there was also eoka in cyprus that massacred turkish cypriots, 
  well what do you think happened ? 
   greece is nothing like germany in the 30 's . 
  or current and past turkey . 
  no , its a much smaller scale of what germany went through . 
  have you seen videos of golden dawn ? 
  the only thing is you ca n't compare that to turkey ( current or past ), 
  there 's nothing to agree/disagree . 
  this is exactly what happened . 
  do you think germans would 've voted for hitler if bread did n't cost an arm and a leg due to inflation ? 
  look at golden dawn in greece during the economic crisis . 
  they almost got elected also . 
  he sure did . 
  not saying that the ends justify the means but there were some unfair sanctions on germany which gave rise to hitler in the first place . 
  he lifted germany up from an economic crises . 
  you have companies like vw , porsche , hugo boss , etc. 
  because of the nazis . 
  because portugal , spain , greece and cyprus also use the euro . 
  with the lira being 4.03 to every 1 euro , you can see why turkey is still an option even with a hostile government in place . 
  but , i thought doner kebab was invented in germany ? 
  what are those green light ? 
  i think it 's the fact that izmir is a port city on the west coast and is very easy to make it to a greek island by boat . 
  but , your conspiracy can be valid also . 
  turkish is actually one of the easiest languages to learn in my opinion . 
  everything is straight forward from spelling to pronunciation . 
  i always heard about people learning turkish just by watch soap operas . 
  probably , some people show no mercy on reddit :p, 
  in reddit , we just put a '' / s '' at the end, 
  is it true that no one takes poland seriously ? 
  there 's a lot of truth in what you said . 
  for example the early kurdish rebellions were based off islamism unlike the recent pkk insurgency that started in the 80 's . 
  look up people like said nursi to get where i am going with this . 
  the founder of the pkk chose communism/socialism not only because he was inspired by bookchin , but also because the soviets gave free weapons to anyone fighting for communism same way ataturk got weapons and money from soviets to fund his independence war because they thought hd would be a communist . 
  if you look at early flags of the pkk it looks very much like any other communist flags with the sickle and hammer . 
  this the secular iranian diaspora all left iran long time ago and are not a fair representation of the country . 
  much like how secular turks would be in my opinion, 
  best answer award goes to ... 
   many armenian families still have the deeds to their farmlands , gold/diamond/copper mines , shipyards and so on . 
  why would those families not receive their property back ? 
  if that 's the case then i support them in getting back compensation for the losses if they have the right documentation . 
  i 'd also support the rebuilding of armenian churches and such . 
   it was virulent and racist turkish nationalism that fueled the armenian holocaust and which continues to fuel denialism and the idea that turks should keep all that was stolen . 
  you are indirectly a proponent of that ethno-nationalism . 
  this is going to turn into a classic `` chicken or the egg '' argument . 
  greece broke away in 1821 , serbia broke away in 1876 , followed by bulgaria and armenians saw this as a chance for them to start their own independence movement . 
  many turks and other muslim monirities were displaced [ as shown in this map ] ( https://scientificrevolutionligthnings.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/displacement-map.jpg ) during the process . 
  when the young turks came to power they actually had support from a large armenian community for better rights . 
  but other armenian groups like hunchaks and dasnaksutyun had other ideas for armenia which is why they started a revolt . 
   revenge ? 
  armenians do n't want blood . 
  but they want land ? 
  also i was referring to the asala murderers, 
  i do n't think there is any monetary or extrinsic value that can be put on the suffering your ancestors went through . 
  not that turkey will ever agree to paying but even if you shake the last penny from turkey , it would not be enough . 
  plus , it would be kind of difficult to determine what goes to whom with what little documentation there is left unless turkey pays government of armenia in lump some . 
  that being said , i 'd also disagree with paying armenians like the germans have to pay jews because that would be like making money off the suffering of your ancestors . 
  to understand where i am going with this , search ` holocaust industry ' by norman finkelstein ( a descendant of holocaust survivors ) . 
  ** so what can we do about it ** i am a firm believer in `` the future is what you make of it '' and it 's all down to how we raise our next generations . 
  i think the biggest problem why this is n't resolved today is ** nationalism ** and it 's what caused it in the first place . 
  i think turkish nationalism emerged out of the ottoman empire in reaction the fervent nationalism manifesting around us during the decay of the ottoman empire . 
  i am sure other nationalities around us feel the same . 
  if we can tone down on nationalism and teach our offspring that it 's possible to co-exist without each of our identities posing a danger to one another then that will pave the way for prosperous future as they can focus on more important things in life . 
  is n't that what it 's all about anyways ? 
  to preserve ones identity ? 
  instead of teaching them to compete they should cooperate . 
  otherwise , we can all continue in the same path of trying to pull each others leg in search of `` justice '' for this and that which in reality is euphemism for revenge . 
  as a turkish . 
  i can agree with this narrative, 
  ok then, 
  current germany is technically the same country as the third reich meanwhile the rep. of turkey government in ankara is a totally different government than the ottoman government in istanbul . 
  in fact ottoman empire still existed when the kemalist government formed . 
  are you turkish ? 
  not to mention that taner akcam is a paid shill for the [ armenian lobby ] ( http://armenians-1915.blogspot.com/2008/05/2464-it-is-official-taner-akcam-is-paid.html ) so i 'd take what he says with a grain of salt . 
  why ? 
  should we forget the fallen turkish lives ? 
  i kindly disagree , while it 's not as widely known as the jewish holocaust . 
  armenian side of the story has reached far corners of the world long before the turkish side has . 
  a lot of people i talked to ca n't even pinpoint the exact turkish view on this subject and they just assume we deny the events from taking place . 
  i agree , since it just convinces the holocaust deniers that they must be right since `` the truth is being suppressed '',
