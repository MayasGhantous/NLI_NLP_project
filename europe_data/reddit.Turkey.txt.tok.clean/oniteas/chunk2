  wow , i could n't have explained it better , thank you . 
  you 're just proving my point . 
  we 're discussing olympics , and the number of journalists in prison is obviously not a criterion . 
  but yeah , let 's talk about all the bad things turkey did instead , that 'd be helpful . 
  i 'm not pro-government or anything , i 'm very aware and highly disturbed of the current situation in my country . 
  but boy am i surprised that for once journalists in prison came up before the armenian genocide in a totally irrelevant discussion about turkey . 
  edit : that did n't stop china from hosting the 2008 olympics . 
  i 've been trying to figure out for the longest time , could n't come up with any other explanation than this subreddit being full of prejudiced and racist people who do n't know much about turkey . 
  what makes you think istanbul is n't safe or organized ? 
  calling turkey `` a huge political mess '' is a bit extreme if you ask me . 
  sure , turkey has its problems , but how is that a criterion for hosting the olympic games ? 
  or do you think only the most developed nations with zero political issues should host the games ? 
  do you know who will be in power in spain or japan in 2020 ? 
  do you know if they will be pro-olympics ? 
  it 's not like one day the islamists will come into power and turn turkey into saudi arabia overnight . 
  turkey has hosted many international tournaments before , even under the akp government , and `` tolerating '' female athletes has never been an issue . 
  i love how every comment that is slightly pro-istanbul gets downvoted immediately in this thread . 
  or just any positive opinion about turkey in the whole subreddit . 
  i believe he 's talking about the budget allocated to olympics . 
  i ca n't believe how they did n't think about including the eurasia marathon in that video ... then again , listening to music in the background , i think i can understand why .

  funny how erdo\u011fan invited a bunch of celebrities who were incapable of producing meaningful sentences to a meeting about the gezi protests two months ago . 
  i guess if you do n't have an oscar or were popular in shitty turkish tv series and happen to be pro-government you can say whatever you want . 
  the thing is he really can not handle criticism well . 
  all his speeches are about what a great leader he is and how he knows everything ( and i mean `` everything '' ) the best and whoever criticizes him is an enemy of turkey who wishes to see us fail . 
  i do n't believe that 's how he actually thinks but that 's the way he addresses his uneducated religious voter base . 
  edit : added a word . 
  turns out it 's only okay when he ( and his party ) is the one renting out pages . 
  do n't be so harsh on him guys , he lives in a country where he can easily get journalists jailed for writing articles that do n't amuse him . 
  he just thought it worked like that everywhere . 
  true , most people would be content with an american who can point out where europe is on a map . 
  / r/europe has never been classy ... 
  it was unclear for a while , but in the end he did n't get arrested . 
  a bunch of people who were standing next to him were taken into custody though . 
  they were charged with `` resisting police officers by standing without using violence '' . 
  and no , it does n't make any sense in turkish either . 
  and also today there were thousands of people all around the country , just standing . 
  pretty much . 
  it 's written on the id . 
  they do n't even ask you what to put there . 
  so it does n't mean anything . 
  recently they changed the law so you can actually have it removed though . 
  unwillingness for internal reform ? 
  i suggest you check turkey 's progress reports for the last 10 years . 
  i think most people here use turkey and erdo\u011fan interchangeably . 
  yes , people always seem to forget that about cyprus . 
  i 'm not defending turkey 's current presence on the island but i think it 's important to see that nobody is 100 % innocent in this situation . 
  well , if you asked the turks , the armenians would have done the same in eastern turkey if they had n't been relocated . 
  they were slaughtering turkish people with the assistance of the russian during war time . 
  of course this does n't justify what the ottomans did , but it 's not like no european countries ( i.e : france , germany , britain ) ever did the same or worse in the past so why hate only turkey ? 
  oh right , because you never know when you might need one more issue to block turkey 's entrance to eu . 
  oh , i could n't agree more . 
  what actual past events earned turkey this antipathy , you think ? 
  if by current turkish behavior you mean the current turkish government , i 'd say that 's a terrible way to put it . 
  i 'm sensing the negativity here on this subreddit is not only towards the government but to the whole country and its citizens . 
  and i think it 's because most people actually know very little of the country . 
  do you even know how that 's calculated ? 
  i hate the turkish politicians as much as the next guy , especially the current government - worst thing to happen to this country . 
  and it 's not like i 'm arguing for the inclusion of turkey to the european union . 
  it 's just that i get the feeling that people here do n't know enough about turkey or have the wrong idea about many things , that 's all . 
  and i 'm surprised because i expected better and now i do n't know why . 
  as ( probably ) the only turk who is subscribed to this subreddit , all the hatred and prejudice towards turkey here really disappointed me . 
  yeah , that 's what the current government does most of the time . 
  update : turkish officials deny the ** rumors ** , no interference is on their agenda . 
  http://mashable.com/2012/09/04/turkey-social-media-ban/ http://www.dailydot.com/news/turkey-social-media-ban-denied-rumors/, 
  it was simply a suggestion from a stupid minister and he is already denying that such interference is on their agenda ( sorry , the only articles i could find were in [ turkish ] ( http://www.cnnturk.com/2012/bilim.teknoloji/%c4%b1nternet/09/05/sosyal.medya.hukumeti.rahatsiz.ediyor/675550.0/index.html ) , which i do n't find very surprising since the foreign media seems to be more interested in those that make turkey look bad ) . 
  long story short , it is not going to happen . 
  it is such a misleading and uninformative article that did nothing but make a big , unnecessary fuss . 
  * edit : i did find some in english afterall : http://mashable.com/2012/09/04/turkey-social-media-ban/ http://www.dailydot.com/news/turkey-social-media-ban-denied-rumors/, 
  well , this , in the article , is just a suggestion too , as opposed to its misleading title . 
  oh and here 's another article shared in a comment below , which i feel is a little more relevant to the case here : http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-11/u-k-may-block-twitter-blackberry-messaging-services-in-future-riots.html, 
  in august , 2002 . http://articles.cnn.com/2002-08-03/world/turkey.death.pen_1_abdullah-ocalan-reform-package-kurdish-rights?_s=pm:world, 
  i assume this is what cnytyo was talking about : http://articles.cnn.com/2011-08-11/tech/london.riots.social.media_1_social-media-facebook-and-twitter-blackberrys?_s=pm:tech http://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/uk-may-block-twitter-facebook-to-help-stop-future-riots/, 
   38 / you start liking dropjes never !, 
  nope , i do n't remember that either . 
  yeah but greece has always been like that , nothing weird about it . 
  what 's odd about it ? 
  no , not at all . 
  might be true for 1 or 2 , but no , all 94 journalists did not steal / rape / kill or commit any other crime . 
  this might be relevant : [ turkish minister of eu affairs on the subject ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y4nfbv7qi0&amp;feature=youtu.be ), 
  someone 's getting aggressive , i guess you did that search and found out the truth then . 
  ankara 's history begins with the hittites . 
  you can search online and see for yourself , it 's not like i have articles about it stored on my computer . 
  but if you think calling a landlocked city `` anchor '' makes sense , guess i 'd respect that too . 
   the name `` istanbul '' actually comes from the medieval greek '' \u03b5\u1f30\u03c2 \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03a0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03bd '' ( is tin polin ) , a nickname the citizens of constantinople used for their home town . 
  it means `` in the city '' . 
  um ... yeah , could be but it 's just one of the possibilities , nobody knows for sure where it 's coming from and there are other alternatives . 
  although i personally think it 's quite probable , many of my greek friends thought it was stupid to call a city `` in the city '' . 
  and `` ankara '' does n't come from greek , it was found by the hittites and was called `` ankuwa\u0161 '' . 
  well i 'm sorry but it does n't make any sense to me . 
  i read your other comments too and it sounds like all you know about turkey and turkish people are what you see and hear on certain news channels and i find your concerns unrealistic . 
   because in turkey it self you have a relatively moderate majority , people with good or decent jobs and education that want secular laws and a way of life that is more europe than saudi arabia . 
  turkish people made that choice about 300 years ago , when the ottoman empire started to decline . 
  majority of turkish people today are more european than middle-eastern . 
  plus , poor turkish people are not by default evil , fundamentalist muslims who 'll do anything to move to a european country and change the laws and force their ways of life to the locals . 
  so there 's no need to worry for your little country of 4.5 million , with turkish economy growing like it is today and you 'll eventually see how ridiculous your phobia sounds to turkish people . 
   i truly believe that integration is both possible and mutually beneficial , but treating turkey as just another in a long line of countries joining the eu is a recipe for disaster . 
  that should have been said 50 years ago , when turkey first applied , before all those other countries in line . 
  somehow , although for different reasons , i agree that turkey is better off not being an eu member . 
  itym lygos , if that 's what we 're doing here ...
