  they will vote yes . 
  erdo\u011fan is like a shepherd , he 's herding his sheeps . 
  he said no-voters are terrorist , feto members , coup-helpers , pkk-supporters etc. , now he 's trying to meddle with europe to gain some nationalist support . 
  the akp group really need this power so they 're trying everything to gain every vote they can . 
  by the way , [ english wikipedia page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_constitutional_referendum,_2017 ) is very informative about our upcoming referendum . 
  you can have a look at it if you 're interested . 
  i 'm really sorry guys , this islamic maniacs and their stupid actions are affecting your countries too, 
  it seems like he think it is . 
  he put a sign on the store 's door stating `` we do not sell israeli-made products in this store . '', 
  they 're members of akp 's youth section , i 'm not surprised . 
  three years ago , [ some akp-supporters poured coke on streets in order to protest israel . 
  that 's good news . 
  he was threatening the netherlands with sanctions , lol, 
  we never experienced a civil war in our history . 
  there will be a lot of outrage and anger if erdo\u011fan wins , but i do n't think there will be a civil war or whatsoever . 
  why on earth you build a mosque right into the parthenon . . til i guess . 
  did the mosque still there or completely destroyed ? 
  and people 've been voting for him since [ 22 years ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/melih_g\u00f6k\u00e7ek ) this country is a joke . 
  some pro-erdo\u011fan journalists reacted negatively to this order . 
  they even fired not just leftist ones , but people who showed even a little opposition to akp too . 
  for example a lot of them were very-well experienced professors in their respective fields . 
  the government saying they 're cleaning the state from fet\u00d6 ( gulenist movement ) but even a newborn baby can see that 's a lie , they clearly sacking or firing whomever they see as `` opposite '' . 
  of course there are people who 're saying this is wrong but classical akp supporters shut their eyes and ears to this madness because they think those people are terrorists and pose a threat to the state . 
  turkish government sacked nearly 4500 public staff tonight with a statutory decree . 
  * ministry of national education 2585 [ mostly teachers ] * gendarmerie 893 * general directorate of security affairs 417 * council of higher education 330 [ all of them were academic personnel ] * radio and television supreme council 88 * ministry of interior 49 * ministry of foreign affairs 48 * ministry of culture and tourism 16 * ministry of economy 15 * court of cassation ( supreme court-yarg\u0131tay ) 10 * supreme electoral council 10 * ministry of eu affairs 3 * coast guard command 3 * general directorate for foundations 2 * housing development administration ( tok\u0130 ) 2 * stock exchange commission 1 turkish sources if someone interested * http://t24.com.tr/haber/yeni-khk-yayimlandi-4-bin-464-kisi-ihrac-edildi,387567 * http://www.sozcu.com.tr/2017/gundem/4-bin-464-kisi-memuriyetten-atildi-1666040/ * http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/son-dakika-4-bin-464-kisi-memuriyetten-cikarildi-40358827, 
  yes ; binding legislative , executive and even judicial branches to one person will solve all our problems . 
  what a nice idea . 
  in turkey , the steps are usually same as other countries . 
  first , you need to attend to a driver school for theoretical courses . 
  after one week , ministry of education organises an exam which you need to pass 70 points . 
  questions usually comes from subjects like first aid , traffic signs and general traffic knowledge , vehicle parts and how a vehicle works . 
  it 's extremely easy because the ministry always asks older questions again and again . 
  after you passed the test you need to take driving lessons where you drive on a specific route . 
  also you need to be able to park and hill-start the car . 
  then if you pass the driving test , which you need to complete the same route correctly , you take your license . 
  total cost would be nearly 572 tl ( $ 142 , $ 152 ), 
  there is no death penalty in turkish judicial system, 
  tayyip is at its best again . 
  we seriously need to take off our hands from that island . 
  kids can do whatever they want to their genital organs after their 18th birthday , but circumsizing children and even babies , apart from medical reasons , is just child abuse . 
  i totally agree that it is barbaric . 
  39 dead , 65 wounded . 
  and there is some people who took this as a good news cause they were drinking and having fun in that place and they deserved to die . 
  welcome 2017 ... 
  i 'm talking about the date , 25th of december , not the birth . 
  they 're actually telling the truth . 
  there is no such writing in the bible says that . 
  its pagan counterpart is saturnalia , early christians derived a lot of their holidays from pagans . 
  erdo\u011fan wo n't let cyprus slide away from his claws . 
  i support the unification of the island but i do n't think that will happen anytime soon, 
  yes , say `` a giant fuck you '' to one of the world 's most important union . 
  eu was turkey 's key to westernization . 
  enjoy your islamic shithole driven by a lunatic dictator . 
  they do n't possess enough intelligence to think through it . 
  making this headline in 2017 is just beyond stupidity . 
  their original news : http://www.yenisoz.com.tr/sabah-fethe-ciksak-avrupa-yi-uc-gunde-aliriz-haber-23826 they based their news to [ europeans ' willing to fight map ] ( http://brilliantmaps.com/europe-fight-war ) . 
  they literally said no one in europe want to fight for their country so if we start a war this morning , we can perform our prayers in the bellevue palace and we can take rome in just two days . 
  these guys built a kaaba model for the prophet 's birthday , prayed to it , baked and ate a quran-shaped cake . 
  yet they still can claim that atat\u00fcrk 's statues are idols and people who follow him are idol worshippers . . 
  classic islamist-nationalist reaction , i 'm not surprised . 
  those guys are a joke . 
  yes , by ankara mayor . 
  some turkish geniuses from twitter solved the issue . 
  [ according to them , the reason behind the earthquake was laicism and adultery . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/turkey/comments/6ombzk/justmuslimthings/ ) their twitter feed is hilarious , i still can not understand how this bigots manage to live in 2017 . 
  it 's not about cult of personality whatsoever . 
  i 'm just respecting and being grateful to a founder who built my country from ashes . 
  without atat\u00fcrk , turkey would be lost after the collapsing of the old empire . 
  what 's wrong if i want to pay homage to him ? 
  why it should n't ? 
  i still ca n't understand how you people think that insulting a leader and a founder in a national tv channel + in front of everyone is a normal thing . 
  insulted one here is the founder of the republic , not an ordinary person . 
  claims like atat\u00fcrk 's mother was a prostitute can not be left without a punisment . 
  as i said before ; 30 months is extreme but i think he deserved it . 
  i could n't understand how you reach to `` foreign leaders '' point . 
  living or dead , current or founder ; you should n't insult a leader or important figure . 
  as i said a couple times before ; criticising and insulting are different and they have a strong line between them . 
  respect is not a subjective thing , it ends where someone say `` atat\u00fcrk was a bastard , his mother worked in a brothel and his father is not known '' . 
  insulting and desecrating a nation 's founder and his mother in front of everyone is not considered in the consept of freedom of speech . 
  you can criticise as you wish but if you pass the line of respect , there will be consequences . 
  there 's a strong line between criticising and insulting . 
  i 'm sorry but you ca n't just insult an important figure and his mother . 
  if you say `` the bastard who died in 1938 '' indicating a nation 's founder , your place will be in jail . 
  30 months may be extreme or not , but he deserved it . 
  serious butthurt . 
  a wise and necessary decision . 
  i 'll respect the germans a lot more if they manage to put a leash on him . 
  erdogan and his lunatic followers would bark continuously if a foreign leader want to make a speech in turkey but he thinks he have the right to speak wherever and to whoever he wants . 
  good . 
  this hypocrite should n't welcomed by any of the world 's democracies , he do n't deserve it while unashamedly calling everyone a nazi . 
  [ 2013 march was gorgeous ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hc4freqcbe ) . 
  i wonder why they started to ban the pride . 
  [ i think last year , 3 people stripped naked and danced at middle of street . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meiyhbj5kgm ) - nsfw !, 
  - conservatives were outrageous then , maybe it 's because of this ? 
  idk, 
  they had already banned the anime but not because of evolution . 
  some stupid kid jumped from his window thinking he 's a pokemon ( pikachu ) . 
  what should 've he done ? 
  sit back and watch a whole nation lie in its soil under imperialist forces ' boots ?
