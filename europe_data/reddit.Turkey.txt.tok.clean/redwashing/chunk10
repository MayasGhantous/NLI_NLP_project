  are not cities . 
  they are n't urban , they are rural . 
  this is the reality , it does n't matter how snobbish you find it . 
  reality has a way of offending some people sometimes . 
  sorry about that . 
  atat\u00fcrk was a nation builder , that does n't mean oppressor . 
  most turkish problems with minorities were from either before or after his era . 
  he found allies wherever he could , soviets felt threatened by the brits so they helped . 
  after the war he also formed warm relations with our old enemies uk , france and even got into a security pact with greece despite being enemies 15 years earlier . 
  i do n't know about `` hitler 's inspiration '' thing but that does n't change anything . 
  fascists twisted darwin 's theories for scientific basis for their ideology as social darwinism . 
  that does n't have anything to do with darwin himself . 
  instead of what hitler thought he knew about him , i 'd rather look at atat\u00fcrk 's foreign policy against rising fascism . 
  he openly sided with the allies diplomatically , signed defense treaties with balkan and middle eastern nations against foreign attacks ( which clearly meant italy and germany ) and secured the bosphorus against the italian navy not to let them use it as a hiding spot with the montreaux treaty . 
  also he openly talked about dangers of fascism and nazism . 
  secularism was n't alone of course , he also built a modern education system stretching to the furthest villages of the country incredibly raised literacy ratings , founded cultural and scientific institutions which still carry the bulk of turkey 's production in these areas , an industry based eceonomy with railroads all over the country , replaced nepotism based ottoman bureucracy with merit based cadres , created a modern law system instead of half-local half-islamic ottoman laws , worked for peace and trade based foreign relations with everyone etc. 
  i can write pages about what he did for the country and it still would n't be enough . 
  there are very few leaders who transformed a society as deeply and quickly as he did . 
  they were kinda well known around me . 
  i absolutely loved the comics and still read them again sometimes . 
  the movies were n't bad but i think they did n't hit the spot exactly . 
  whenever they 're ready to submit to their portuguese overlords of course . 
  i 'm not saying russia should annex your land calm down . 
  however they came there , they are in estonia now as legal citizens of native birth . 
  does it make any sense to blame them because their ancestors came illegaly ? 
  how many generations have to pass so it becomes ok ? 
  almost every single nation came to their current lands illegaly during an illegal occupation . 
  if that means they have no rights there we should split europe between celts and basques , and i 'm not even talking about colonial nations in americas and ocenia . 
  fascism does n't deal with the provlem of violence , it embraces ans builds upon it . 
  they do n't see it as a problem . 
  social darwinism is not a scientific theory , it 's just a weird collage of positivism with a touch of hegelian concept of social evolution . 
  yes , i do have moral values which affect my political opinions but i do n't refuse scientific facts because they contadict my values , my values will change if they do n't fall in line with science . 
  here this is n't the case . 
  social darwinism is an incredibly inconsistent and non scientific ideology used as the scientific basis fascism desperately lacks . 
  social sciences are already much more complex and vague than positive sciences , so people are drawn to simplified pseudo-positive scientific explanations . 
  also , i 'm an industrialist who believes that human control over the nature as a whole is justified ( that does n't mean misusing or destroying it ) and that individual 's will can triumph over `` human nature '' ( again a vague and non defined concept ) so even accepting that violence was nature 's way would n't change my stance on that , which i do n't . 
  well , violence is part of human nature but not all of it . 
  the again , if we had nothing more than our nature we would still be climbing trees to run away from predators , since it 's actually nature 's way for us to be prey . 
  you assume every communist has a secret agenda of totalitarianism , that 's just not true . 
  not every communist is a wolf . 
  there are lots and lots of communists , the majority actually , who believe in humanist libertarian ideals and do not want to destroy , instead enhance pluralism by nullifying class differences . 
  you may think they are wrong and their ideology leads to totalitarianism in the end , many of them think that your branch of european liberalism leads to monopolized market dictatorship and loss of social/personal liberties in the end . 
  it does n't make either of you totalitarians . 
  fascists , on the other hand , are proud totalitarians who do n't hide the fact that they wanr to take away personal and social liberies away . 
  hence the `` special '' treatment they should receive . 
  people who belong to other ideologies and defend totalitarianism should be shunned by the society just like fascists . 
  defending pinochet dictatorship because it 's good for the market or dprk regime because it 's egalitarian does n't have much difference for me . 
  the thing is , while it 's wrong to assume every liberal you see a friedman supporter or every communist a kim fan , every fascist you see is indeed a hitler and mussolini supporter . 
  that 's why the prejudice makes sense in that case . 
  '' ... believes neither in the possibility ** nor the utility ** of perpetual peace . '', 
  the second part takes it from a pseudo-realist to strictly ** pro ** violence level . 
  my problem with the prospect of perpetual war and violence is not only ethical , also pragmatical since wars absolutely do n't create rejuvenation and progress , only destruction on a physical but perhaps even more importantly social , cultural and scientific level , channeling all human effort towards killing each other instead of , well , everything else . 
  also , applying biological theories to the social level in form of social darwinism just creates a non-scientific nihilistic clusterfuck and has been criticised by many including darwin himself with more than ethical arguments . 
  while the appliance of the evolution as a concept to human societies is incredibly problematic , the social darwinist ideology also ignores that emphaty , cooperation and benevolence are not god-given but also evolutionary tenets that survived natural selection . 
  the totalitarianism argument is , again , inherently defended in fascist doctrine but not in the communist one . 
  marx himself was n't a totalitarian . 
  while one migt argue that communism always ends up as a totalitarian regime ( i do n't agree with that either but that 's not the point ) it is entirely possible , and in fact common for a communist individual to be anti totalitarian . 
  european history is filled with libertarian humanist marxists . 
  a fascist , on the other hand , is totalitarian by definition . 
  it 's ok to treat totalitarian communists the same way as fascists but it 's wrong to assume every communist is totalitarian , while every fascist is totalitarian . 
  would n't that be called extreme/discriminatory nationalism ? 
  no , it 's a fact . 
  fascism does n't only accept war and violence as necessary , but as inherently beneficial and progressive . 
  that 's why while other ideologies can get violent , fascism in itself is and has to be violent . 
  to justify violence and war to the masses , you have to find or create an enemy identity and dehumanize them , thus creating hatred . 
  this is the very basis and core of the fascist doctrine . 
  edit : `` fascism , the more it considers and observes the future and the development of humanity quite apart from political considerations of the moment , believes neither in the possibility nor the utility of perpetual peace . 
  it thus repudiates the doctrine of pacifism -- born of a renunciation of the struggle and an act of cowardice in the face of sacrifice . 
  war alone brings up to its highest tension all human energy and puts the stamp of nobility upon the peoples who have courage to meet it . '', 
  mussolini * the political and social doctrine of fascism *, 
  chocolate , watches , mountains and jewish gold, 
  how can they be racists ? 
  nationalist , sure , but the swiss are n't a race . 
  we are talking about individual communists and if they could be rewarded , not socialist states . 
  there are loads of examples of communist individuals who 've worked for peaceful goals . 
  fascism as a doctrine is based on hate . 
  it is impossible to be a fascist without hatred and a supremacist discriminatory ideal . 
  while communists ( and liberals , conservatives , social democrats , nationalists etc. ), 
  can be supremacist racist hateful assholes , they may also be none of that . 
  a peaceful tolerant fascist is an oxymoron . 
   mayor of belgrade 's corruption that sounded like he 's actually legally in charge of belgrade 's corruption . 
  like you ca n't accept a bribe without his written consent . 
  you think that 's incompetent ? 
  just take a look at [ this ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_kar\u00e1nsebes ), 
  your heart is in the right place but i 'm not sure it 's worth it . 
  i 'm personally so sick and tired of arguing with right wing populist idiots in my country for the last 15 years i mostly just say fuck off and keep walking . 
  i 've never seen any of them convinced despite being bombarded with mountains of evidence . 
  they were n't beaten by convincing the last time either . 
  their position is political in practice but not in nature , that 's why the facts do n't work . 
  they 're just angry and lonely kids haunted by their massive insecurities so they need a group to belong and a leader to order them around . 
  you ca n't change that with political arguments . 
  you also ca n't really argue with people who are n't individuals , it 's no different then calmly explaining your differing political positions to a whole rally . 
  people do n't work their asses off in med school for nothing , i ca n't do a psychiatrist 's job . 
  uniting against nazis ? 
  political polarization seems like an awesome thing if you define it like that . 
  he clearly has some alternative facts about this so i do n't think arguing with him will be of much use buddy . 
  if everyone would be convinced by overwhelming video and photographic evidence together with victim and eyewitness testimonies we would n't have holocaust deniers either but here we are ... 
  democratic process is such a wide term and also used like the word of god around here . 
  i also do n't want a coup but an organized people 's movement not created by , but joined by the army would be great . 
  turkish army is n't professional .
