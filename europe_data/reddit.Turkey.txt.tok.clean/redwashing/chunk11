  if ali is convinced erdo\u011fan must go with any means necessary when he 's working his day job , he wo n't suddenly change his mind while doing military service . 
  the portuguese carnation revolution can be a perfect example for that . 
  in the end , army 's involvement kept the whole ordeal non-violent and made it impossible for it to escalate into civil war . 
  women smoke disproportionately less than men in turkey and take the overall percentage down . 
  percentage of adult male smokers is 41 % , which is kind of an achievement since it fell back from 47 % in 2008 . 
  about one of every two guys you meet smokes basically . 
  except with enlightenment europe did argue with religion - and won . 
  i think secular people should in no way accept to fight religions on their turf , accepting that they are superior to other ideas , protected and somehow non-criticisable . 
  a religion wants to get out of conscience/spiritual and get into the worldly politics and social life ? 
  fine . 
  that 's how we discuss those things : with facts . 
  if they 've got falsifiable scientific theories proving their point , they are welcome to discuss them . 
  if they do n't and want to get into this fight anyway , they 'll lose . 
  nobody forced islam to come into this area . 
  the good ones are really expensive . 
  i 've been saving for a bit so i might buy one though . 
  if there is n't foam , it ca n't be named coffee . 
  also the water has to be ice cold and soft , without much minerals . 
  you have to mix it before starting to cook just the right amount , otherwise it will have a santrifuge effect and the coffee will subside . 
  you have to cook it as slow as possible . 
  the foam comes and goes in seconds so you have to catch it separately and put to cups with a teaspoon . 
  then when it 's finally done ( it does n't give any hint it 's done btw , you just have to know somehow ) you have precious few seconds to pour it or it burns and tastes like shit . 
  also , if you do n't pour it exactly the right way and speed , the foam you worked so hard to maintain disappears in an instant . 
  there is a tradition in turkey where a guy and his family goes to ask a woman 's hand in marriage in the woman 's family home , the soon-to-be-bride makes coffee for everyone so the guy 's parents can decide if she 's worth it . 
  the soon-to-be-bride makes all the coffees as best as she can , except the one she prepares for the groom-to-be , which she makes without foam on purpose , burns the coffee and adds salt to it . 
  with that , the bride 's family can see if the groom can still stay cool and thank the bride after drinking that horrible coffee . 
  coffee is serious business around here . 
  that , for example , is far from the regular ottoman modus operandi . 
  desecrating christian and jewish religious buildings was considered a sin in the ottoman branch of islam . 
  while some pa\u015fas did that in other balkan countries too , it was never institutionalized like in serbia . 
  they have n't been that great with other christians either but with serbs it was a bloodbath . 
  i really do n't know why it was like that . 
  the thing the serbs usually forget about is that ancestors of 99.9 % of turks alive today were n't the janissaries , sipahis , pa\u015fas and the palace elite of the ottoman empire . 
  they were anatolian villagers , which was amongst the poorer regions of the empire , getting fucked by high taxes , [ often rebelling ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rebellions_in_the_ottoman_empire_\\ ( in_turkey \\ ) ) and getting mowed down by the army just like everybody else in the empire . 
  ottomans were a dynasty , not a nation so blaming turks for that 200 years after the occupation ended does n't really make sense . 
  turks drink coffee too but not through the whole day like the french . 
  it 's quite difficult and tedious to cook decent turkish coffee so we drink it one-two per day , usually after meals . 
  the everyday ( or every minute ) drink is tea , for it 's far easier to make large amounts . 
  i actually miss turkish coffee a lot living alone . 
  i can buy coffee wherever i want but i do n't have the necessary skills , patience or a copper pot to make a good cup of coffee , and badly prepared turkish coffe can be * really * bad . 
  that i know from experience . 
  habsburgs only held bosnia and vojvodina for a short time , ottomans occupied the whole yugoslavia for far longer and more violently . 
  that does n't justify holding a 100 year old grudge to a whole nation but there is a backstory here . 
  nobody likes being occupied . 
  also ottomans treated far worse to slavs than any other christian minority . 
  they let the greeks hold their patriarchate with protected status but slaughtered almost all clergy when it came to serbia for example . 
  it may be a russian hate thing but i 'm not sure . 
  to be fair they started a world war to kick the austrians out of their country . 
  also we have n't exactly been [ that nice ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/skull_tower ) to them . 
  just blame germany . 
  we do it in turkey about wwi . 
  they love taking all the blame when it comes the world wars . 
  dude i think you 're stuck at he 19th century . 
  from post-ussr russian shock therapy to recent greek austerity there are a ton of examples where smith 's hand was nowhere to be found . 
  you 're just reciting neoliberal slogans . 
  it did n't work for the us either , you still have high poverty rates and recently the whole country paid cash to the banks because their administrations fucked up . 
  it was supposed to get better after 2008 , but the numbers say it did n't get better enough . 
  neoliberalism may offer some benefits in theory , but it did n't work in practice . 
  as a leftist i always wanted to say that to a liberal btw . 
  damn that felt good . 
  edit : words n stuff, 
  i meant turk in a cultural sense , almost none of the architects until 18th century were ethnical turks since turks holding any position in state was heavily restricted , including the position of palace architect . 
  mimar sinan himself was dev\u015firme . 
  his origin is thought to be greek or armenian , though some historians claim his family were christian turks . 
  i always thought sultanahmet mosque was feminine too btw . 
  she 's got a different elegance compared to the masculinity of selimiye and s\u00fcleymaniye . 
  the building was destoyed and rebuilt countless times . 
  justinien wanted a dome on three columns instead of four because holy trinity and all that , but there 's a reason you do n't put a huge dome over three feet . 
  in every earthquake the dome went down , among other things . 
  the first dome was destroyed in 558 , just 21 years after the basilica 's construction was complete . 
  after sinan 's restorations , it 's standing still for 600 years which is the longest time a single hagia sophia building stood without crumbling or losing its dome . 
  all this is quite easy to find with a simple google search but not doing that and just throwing wbat you think you know without research is easier i guess . 
  thread became a fascist shitshow so it 's pretty normal shit like that is taken seriously . 
  in a normal discussion i 'd assume you 're trolling but this is / r/europe , asssuming hostility gives the right result 9/10 . . 
  visitor count of topkap\u0131 palace alone is about the same as the whole poland so it does n't matter much if you find it cool or not . 
  it 's perfectly normal for an angsty alt right teen to not know anything about architecture .

  civilians that were born and raised there are n't conquering tyrants that slaughter native population . 
  the greek war of independence against ottomans was just , ethnically cleansing the turkish minority was n't . 
  anyway , this thread is n't about that and i have no intention to discuss it here , but if you think slaughtering civilians is ok in any case there 's something seriously wrong with you . 
  this is an extremely simplistic way to look at sinan 's architectural tradition which has been widely accepted as the eastern counterpart of renaissance architecture . 
  his style affected almost everything built to the east of istanbul , including taj mahal in which two students of sinan worked on the domes . 
  these mosques are the finest examples of this era and the absolute peak of islamic architecture . 
  there are loads of books about sinan style architecture but you can start [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mimar_sinan ) if you want to learn about it . 
  which is inspired by roman architecture . 
  it is perfectly normal to be inspired by ancient monuments around you . 
  yeah sure . 
  we 'll give it back to greeks when swedes go back to russian steppes and give their land to samis . 
  go back to your donald circlejerk sub . 
  no it 's not . 
  until gothic era whole christian architecture was dome based , it is still a common frame in the east . 
  ottoman architecture is certainly affected by byzantine architecture but calling it a copy is like calling every building with columns copies of parthenon . 
  using semi-domes and small domes as support instead of just aesthetic value is part of mimar sinan 's legacy , as well as adding height to the central dome to give interior an overwhelmingly magestic look . 
  you can see much of his ideas since the mosque was designed by a student of his , you can also see a more pure form of sinan 's style in s\u00fcleymaniye and selimiye mosques . 
  hagia sophia itself was indeed a big inspiration , since sinan spent o huge deal of time restoring the building and bonding with it over this . 
  his obsession with huge central single domes have probably much to do with this . 
  the proper name is miklagard . 
  there are muslim counterparts of far right christians you see in this sub who want to convert everything they see into mosques but nobody wants to destroy them . 
  istanbul is proud of its diverse history , the city is poetically referred to as home of six nations , capital to four empires . 
  hagia sophia is n't the only ancient building that is preserved , there are hundreds of eastern roman historical buildings in addition to latin ones from the levantines and genoese , both ancient and imperial armenian built buildings , italian ones from the late imperial period , german ones again from late imperial and early republic period etc.
