  it is starting to look dangerous for syrians here . 
  they were n't islamists when they arrived . 
  we sent the same people to the us and canada and they 're pretty integrated and seculars over there . 
  not to say the german turks are awesome or anything , but you guys are partly to blame . 
  germany did n't do a very good job of integrating them, 
  i meant the money . 
  $ 276m is not a huge amount for a $ 316b gdp economy . 
  czechs wo n't strain relations for a very old debt , and because of the warsaw pact countries ' trade laws i assume cuba does n't even have to pay it , it was the ussr who forced those things and they are n't around anymore . 
  it 's a gesture . 
  my thought was n't that cuba will load huge oil tankers with rum and send it to czechia ( ok that would be pretty funny ) but a favorable/tax free trade deal with czechia for cuban rum for 100 years or so . 
  cuba gets more trade which they want , czechia gets cheap and good quality rum which ( being slavs , i assume ) they want . 
  both countries improve relations . 
  we all get a nice meme . 
  everyone 's happy . 
  turkish islamism is different from arab islamism . 
  dutch turks are like the most akp voters here . 
  men of the family will drink rak\u0131 and visit brothels but if you criticize their religion they will turn violent . 
  well at least they will think that turning violent over this is ok , not that they will do anything about it themselves . 
  they wo n't go and fight for isis but have no problems supporting `` humanitarian aid '' organizations which they know that supply weapons to jihadists in syria . 
  they wo n't have a problem with their sons drinking and screwing around but they will imprison their daughters in their homes and try to marry them off to some guy she barely knows . 
  they are less likely to turn to violence than their arab counterparts , but they are far more hypocritical . 
  do n't know which one 's worse . 
  most countries do n't sanction cuba , but the ones they do are their natural trade partners . 
  also us routinely [ disrupts and interrupts ] ( https://books.google.com.tr/books?id=gw-_daaaqbaj&amp;pg=pa28&amp;lpg=pa28&amp;dq=ricardo+alarcon,+in+a+speech+to+the+un+general+assembly,+cited+27+recent+cases+of+trade+contracts+interrupted+by+us+pressure&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3hvxsdu_ry&amp;sig=6ijsm8aa6p2smkkt12vfuqpu8ke&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiwnk3h6pnqahvbbhqkhercajeq6aeiitab#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ) cuban trade deals with third parties , so it 's not just the us 's own embargo . 
  that 's why cuba defines it not as sanctions of embargo but as a blockade . 
  cuba ca n't produce cars and ca n't reliably import them for reasonable prices because of the sanctions . 
  there is less supply than demand , price will get higher . 
  basic economics . 
  thet are getting cheaper though , due to china selling them for reasonable prices . 
  logistics of it still costs a lot though . 
  the amount is n't huge and it certainly wo n't be pursued by the czech government , so it 's a show of goodwill mostly . 
  thats actually a sensible proposition . 
  because of the embargo cuba does n't get enough international trade so their money is nearly worthless against lots of foreign currencies . 
  even a small amount of foreign debt would hit the cuban economy hard because of the exchange difference . 
  they do however produce lots of goods with high trade value . 
  first proposition was less memey then booze , they wanted to pay with medicine . 
  czechia was inclined to agree , but apparently some of it does n't align with eu regulations so they had to refuse . 
  rum was the second option . 
  i said there is a huge turkish community in netherlands , did n't give numbers except their voting percentage for akp , which is indeed 70 % . 
  there are about 400.000 turks in netherlands , which makes about 2.4 % of the population . 
  goes up to about 5 % in urban centers . 
  not exactly somewhere you 'd want to be if around 3-4 % are the exact people you 're running from . 
  also these people also create their opposite , and cause normal turks to be discriminated . 
  austria germany and france are n't too popular for the secular exodus for the same reasons . 
  just read the wiki page , it 's interesting . 
  i thought it was kulczycki who came up with the concept . 
  will definitely read teply . 
  i first learned about the coffeehouse-ottoman connection in highschool through my music teacher with [ this ] ( http://www.lieder-archiv.de/c_a_f_f_e_e-notenblatt_100150.html ) song . 
  whole history of that is fascinating to me . 
  you have the poles to thank for both . 
  if anyone else attacked the siege camp from any other direction the ottoman army could pull an organized retreat . 
  it took exactly hussars for them to run away so fast and leave all the coffee and gulash . 
  i love when such small details in history lead to stuff like that . 
  i 've been to vienna and she 's a beauty alright , but i ca n't imagine her without coffee . 
  would kinda feel incomplete . 
  it 's not like it was so bad for austrians . 
  they got their coffee out of this siege . 
  ask austrians outside vienna if they 'd rather lose vienna or coffee , the answer might surprise you . 
  republic of turkey - republic of poland alliance , whenever erdo\u011fan gets the fuck off . 
  there is no ottoman empire anymore , and there wo n't be one in the future . 
  davuto\u011flu and g\u00fcl contributed in the fucked up foreign policy that brought turkey to this . 
  they are incredibly shitty politicians . 
  they just do n't yell and curse anyone they do n't like so they do n't seem as bad , but in essence they are . 
  turkey 's current disastrous middle east policy was theorized by davuto\u011flu for example . 
  intellectual turks can already flee . 
  an academician with 3 degrees or an internationally celebrated artist wo n't have a hard time being accepted somewhere else , open borders or not . 
  europe is n't that popular among turkish expats though . 
  people are leaving the country because they are tired of discrimination , conflict and islamists and try to choose a destination that does n't have those . 
  canada australia nz and us are the most popular options . 
  in europe scandinavian countries like denmark and norway are popular . 
  someone running away from akp probably wo n't go to the netherlands with a huge turkish population voting 70 % for erdo\u011fan . 
  yeah , no . 
  trump talks shit about women , erdo\u011fan tries to legalize rape . 
  trump ralks shit about the media , erdo\u011fan imprisons journalists . 
  not even close . 
  it already [ started ] ( http://www.bbc.com/turkce/haberler-turkiye-37754038 ) btw . 
  they mostly do n't go tor europe though , mostly us canada australia etc. 
  honestly it does n't matter that much . 
  it 's a nice gesture and i could n't care less what they call istanbul . 
  almost every single european city has multiple names in multiple languages . 
  it does n't matter . 
  thanks to the greek people from istanbul , islambol , istinpoli , basileuousa , konstantiniyye , constantinopolis , roma constantinopolitana , byzantion , r\u016bmiyyat al-kubra , takht-e rum or whatever anyone wants to call it . 
  thanks kom\u015fu . 
  not central anatolia but aegean and mediterranean parts did celebrate him for a long time . 
  especially antalya has a personal relationship with him since santa was born in demre . 
  the reason islamists have tried to attack that ( yeah they hate santa . 
  literally . 
  they stab a blow up santa annually in christmas ) is because it 's widespread especially in communities that had close connections to christian communities historically . 
  it 's probably hard to explain your kid why he does n't get a present when niko next door has tons of them . 
  traditions have a way of spreading , even when they leave the religious part behind . 
  i do n't know if it 's still happening but christian and jewish artisans in istanbul used to give everyone warm milk in bayram mornings for example , not even muslim shopowners did that . 
  in turkey noel baba does n't only brings gifts to the christian minority actually . 
  for the rest of the country he brings gifts at the new years eve instead of christmas , but the rest of the myth is pretty much the same . 
   are you denying that bahceli is a very respected man in turkey ? 
  i do . 
  he is n't respected even in his party . 
  he 's used by erdo\u011fan but respect has nothing to do with it . 
   how can you call pkk immoral , when they just follow the practices of the turkish state the same way i call tsk immoral  which is being supported by the turkish people ? 
  less than half clear enough ? 
   since hdp is not a turkish party but a kurdish party .
