  most of them are getting raped by their family members though http://bianet.org/bianet/kadin/173701-ailenin-karanlik-ve-ortulu-yuzu-ensest, 
  yeah , that only works in the west . 
  not around here . 
  islamists are legalizing raping children , while rape numbers skyrocket in their rule . 
  also , they casually beat gays and kill trans people . 
  if you call anti-islamist people misogynistic homophobes in turkey people probably will get a good laugh , then leave you alone because they 'll think you 're a lunatic and if the person that raped you manages to pass off as a lunatic in the court he wo n't get punished , so it 's kinda dangerous . 
  it seems impossible to normal people capable of empathizing with the victims . 
  not islamists . 
  whenever they see rape in the news their first thought is n't `` what if that happened to me , how would i feel '' . 
  it 's rather `` what if i raped someone , how would that end up for me '' . 
  that 's because western world has never seen islamists in power up close . 
  it sickens me to see people pretending to be pro lgbt defending islamists . 
  they should contact turkish pro lbgt organizations and ask them what they think about it . 
  assuming they do n't say `` fuck you '' and hang up because they 'd probably think they 're being trolled , they could explain the situation in detail . 
  [ the kind people of this country have a wonderful dream ] ( http://galeri13.uludagsozluk.com/707/allah-rte-yi-basimizdan-eksik-etmesin_1136001_m.jpg ), 
  yeah , not exactly a `` xenophobe '' sadly . 
  i live in the same country with the fuckers , they are n't foreign . 
  one day we will deport all those islamists to the ksa and qatar , than i will be able to be a xenophobic islamophobic privileged bastard . 
  looking forward to it . 
  islamophobia is the most sensible phobia . 
  they explode around public areas and rape children , it 's mental not to be scared of them . 
  go to any public area in the world ( including muslim countries ) and shout allahuekber . 
  watch the reaction . 
  the whole world is islamophobic with very good reasons to be . 
  with a record low turnout because of the lack of a left alternative . 
  people did n't want to choose between two islamists . 
  also , 52 < 55 . 
  he never got that much . 
  `` some 62 percent of respondents saw personnel from institutions and organizations upholding executive power as somewhat corrupt . 
  only 19 percent view institutions and organizations as completely uncorrupt , while 20 percent abstained from expressing an opinion on the subject . '', 
  only 19 % think they are clean . 
  we do have raw resources , the industry is discontinuous though . 
  we sell cotton , buy fabric , then sell the clothes . 
  sell metals , buy car parts , assemble and sell cars . 
  also akp pushed construction economy hard because it provides quick growth and we do n't produce that much cement . 
  a small tweak could 've helped in the short run bun dollar being 3.3 is devastating , almost all economists agree that lira losing that much value is terrible for the turkish economy . 
  the thing is our currency is losing value and the trade deficit is growing . 
  our exports are dependent on imports , we have a mid level industry , ca n't make anything from scratch .

  they are all gone because we really needed more generic shopping malls with shitty glass coverage . 
  it was n't enough though , now they want to demolish [ the haydarpa\u015fa terminal ] ( http://www.seffafgazete.com/site/1/uploads/o/2016/06/aa7fcd7b63c73053c976a10134cc62ec.jpg ) , a neoclassical building built by ritter and conu with italian masons , and the [ narmanl\u0131 inn ] ( http://image.cdn.haber7.com//haber/haber7/photos/2015/53/tarihi_narmanli_han_belgesel_oluyor_1451386578_8498.jpg ) at \u0130stiklal street , built in 1831 by russians as the turkish embassy . 
  they want to build hotels , because fuck history we need money . 
  too bad nobody told them tourists come to see buildings like those not new age shit like [ this ] ( http://www.hilton.com.tr/sites/1/upload/images/b/1-167.jpg ) . 
  yeah they can for sure , but it will be a net loss for the eu . 
  they did it for russia because what putin did affected whole europe . 
  eu has too much to lose if putin has it his way . 
  not so much with erdo\u011fan , he only fucks up turkey not the rest of europe . 
  at least economically . 
  the question is : will the eu sacrifice profits for political gain ? 
  my answer here is no , but we 'll see what actually happens i guess . 
  actually no , it wo n't . 
  turkey is dependent on eu for foreign trade even more than us and china combined , and in turkey right wing voters tend to change ideologies fast when their vallets are effected . 
  the problem is the sanctions will hurt the eu too . 
  not nearly as much as they hurt turkey but lots of eu based firms have factories here . 
  textile and automative sectors will be hit . 
  will eu hurt it 's own vallet to teach erdo\u011fan a lesson ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  sanctions would also mean that turkey will open the western borders to give refugees free passage and refuse to take them back . 
  they did it with russia because the issue was international in nature , turkey 's problems are internal . 
  i do n't think eu would hurt its economy for turkey 's internal matters . 
  not really . 
  it is a quite common to be branded as muslim on your id despite being an atheist or just culturally muslim . 
  not everyone who votes for akp is an islamist , they managed to rally traditional conaervative center right behind them . 
  also half ( if you do n't count fraud , a bit more than half ) of the country voted no in the referandum . 
  yeah kinda . 
  that 's why the coup was so traumatic . 
  two islamist factions fighting among each other for control and the scular half of the country in their homes thinking how the fuck did we get there from a secular republic . 
  polls about turkey are almost always biased to one side or the other . 
  where did you get that number ? 
  it 's total bs . 
  atheist count only is higher than 5 % . 
  we also have tons of jews , christians and alevis who do n't always define themselves as `` muslim '' and definitely do n't wat a sunni caliphat . 
  also about half the muslim population here are culture muslims . 
  even akp 's voterbase is mostly traditional turkis conservative , islamists are a minority even in their party . 
  long story short , turkey is much less muslim than you think . 
  g\u00fclen was always a manipulating scheming radical islamist bastard . 
  the fact that he could n't share his power with erdo\u011fan does n't change that . 
  gorgonzola sounds like an end of level boss from 90 's platformers . 
  tasted it once and it was pretty good but the name will always make me chuckle . 
  ka\u015far is great but the best cheese from kars is definitely gravyer . 
  \u0130sli \u00c7erkes , otlu van and \u0130zmir tulumu are other favorites of mine . 
  do n't mix turkey in , we 're a giant clusterfuck of ethnicity . 
  nobody knows what they are here . 
  i 'm a kurdish-circassian half breed with khorasani turkmen , arab , greek , armenian and even some sepharadic roots thrown in there . 
  i 'm currently dating a girl who 's family is half bosniaks from mostar and half albanians from montenegro . 
  if we ever have children they will be seriously confused about their ancestry . 
   that one tourist who dropped their ice cream in the escalator yesterday should pay the nation 1 billion dollars !, 
  finnish tourists heavily armed with beer and bicycle helmet armor came here first . 
  what were we supposed to do , not retaliate ? 
  wow what an insult i 'm so deeply offended . 
  are you 13 or sth ? 
  government and ypg are n't in active conflict though . 
  i doubt they would be denied passage provided they were unarmed of course . 
  it does n't affect you in the slightest so what the hell do you care ? 
  times like these i actually think feminists are right about the whole fragile masculinity thing . 
  islamists are in power and this law is one of the few things that slow them down so i support it in the current situation . 
  that law would be totally unnecessary in a secular and democratic turkey and i would support repealing it . 
  ` faili me\u00e7hul cinayet ' ( unsolved murder ) is used as a term for government sanctioned assasinations of leftists and kurds in the 90s . 
  she was the interior minister back then and still supports her stance at the time . 
  she most likely did n't murder anyone with her own hands but she 's still responsible .
