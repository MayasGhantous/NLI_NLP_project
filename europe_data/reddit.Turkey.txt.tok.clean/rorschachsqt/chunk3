  brb need to pack some bombs to relieve myself of the stress you caused with that comment , the nearest store should have some suicide bombs ready for me . 
  i am starting to think people on reddit believe there is a chance that muslims will all convert to christianity and it will be all ok or something . 
  i do n't care what a nutjob 's reasoning is for murdering someone . 
  i am talking about the book . 
  read them instead of yelling `` islam is so backwaaards '' when your religion is almost exactly the same thing . 
  i do n't know why muslims are more backwards than christians , but i know that their religion ca n't be the only reason . 
  i know that if i did something similar to what this shopkeeper did in a lot of places in turkey i would get my ass kicked ; this guy was a nutjob that murdered the shopkeeper instead . 
  what reaction would i get if i insulted jesus in a public area in texas or ... lublin ? 
  ca n't everyone hate religion altogether instead of just islam ? 
  islam is just the third book after the old and new testaments ; outside of some small things that may be interpreted in a way to justify terrorism there is n't much difference . 
  yes i agree . 
  but you ca n't say that to people 's faces , need to make them figure it out for themselves . 
  what a memer, 
  us corporations took the oil , traded with china . 
  it was n't for the us ; but for the so called `` us corporations '' that are actually multinational but let 's pretend that us did n't invade iraq for oil , why did it invade it then ? 
  [ after all , they knew it was going to destabilize the middle east . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6beszmvrq-i&amp;list=wl&amp;index=7 ), 
  it 's because there was an islamic revolution in iran that gave the shia leaders iran 's control so they turned it into an islamic republic . 
  the seculars are outnumbered but there are many of them there . 
  this is literally the reaction erdogan would give !, 
  putin = erdogan both are corrupt pieces of shit . 
  these guys are so bad that they make even trump look like an angel in comparison . 
  stop making up conspiracy theories , they are not trying to trick people into favorability ; governments do n't have to have people 's approval on every little thing they do anyway . 
  i agree . 
  i think taking over newspapers is a better sign . 
  turkey does lack freedom of press/media , freedom of speech ; and freedom of religion to some extent . 
  before erdogan it was just freedom of speech that we lacked . 
  england is like the world 's king and about 5 times richer than countries like turkey for example . 
  you ca n't expect the process to work the same for me countries ; we ca n't give everyone independence because they want it . 
  that 's an easy way to blame other countries for your weakness . 
  not everything russia/turkey touches turns into shit that 's ridiculous . 
  the real idiot is erdogan here if he is choosing to use the position he is in for something so juvenile . 
  old turkey would n't have contributed to destroying syria so the situation would be very different . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( nominal ) http://knoema.com/nwnfkne/world-gdp-ranking-2015-data-and-charts i do n't how economy works ; but i know that - % 4 is a lot bigger than it sounds . 
  maybe has something to do with inflation i am not sure ; but it 's really really bad . 
  you can also be with goats and camels and horses in turkey , it 's legal and even encouraged . 
  when you live in a desert camels are on high demand ; but as turkey is also an islamic republic camels are an alternative for homosexuals who would otherwise be beheaded with a knife then thrown off a bridge . 
  how are armenians `` mistreated '' when they are the ones that massacred azerbaijanis exactly ? 
  old turkey would n't , new turkey would and did already . 
  what 's exactly the point of these protests ? 
  what are these people trying to achieve i do n't know ; but if they hate muslims so much they should form their own kkk or vote for politicans that will declare war on 1/4 of world 's population . 
  walking around in streets spewing hate on minorities accomplishes literally nothing , besides maybe helping isis out with recruiting . 
  we are more liberal in terms of abortion than poland actually . 
  news like this make me feel like im living in a somewhat progressive country , then a bomb goes off and im back to reality . 
  # ** make turkey ottoman empire again **, 
  i guess that 's a way to look at it ; but for foreigners visiting a muslim country , it must be an interesting experience hearing some guy yell through a loudspeaker 5 times a day in arabic . 
  you do n't really need to pray along unless you want to ; but some people say you should n't listen to any music during ezan out of respect . 
  i did n't make myself clear , by prayer i meant [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wv9jgejik_m ) . 
  we call it ezan in turkey , not sure what 's its called in english . 
  it happens 5 times a day whether you like it or not :d, 
  it 's weirder than that for muslims . 
  it 's listening to a loud prayer in a language that you ca n't understand 5 times a day ; or people looking at you funny if you use the turkish word for god instead of `` allah '' type of weirdness . 
  its a symbolic thing for islam , most women do n't even wear it to cover themselves ; but because they think wearing veils alone makes them muslim ... 
  this is because islam has an inherent nonideological flaw , it tells all muslims that islam should be practiced in arabic because it 's the holy language of heaven . 
  this makes it so that in muslim countries where people do n't speak arabic , people do n't really know their religion besides some general things . 
  they ca n't do much , chp was deemed `` irreligious '' and was banned during [ 1980 's turkish coup ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980_turkish_coup_d%27%c3%a9tat ) so now the biggest percentage of votes they can get is % 25-30 ( most old people think of chp as a communist party . ), 
  erdogan is filling people with `` western hate '' to consolidate support , so i would say the country is less western than it has been in a very long time . 
  [ akp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/justice_and_development_party_ ( turkey ) voters are either hardcore islamists so they do n't care about the situation turkey is in ; or they believe in me conspiracy theories that erdogan 's media sells them - thinking the us is purposely destabilizing the me to reshape it . 
  [ chp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republican_people%27s_party_ ( turkey ) voters are desperate and are worried about the future of turkey . 
  they think the country is on it 's way to becoming another me shithole and despise erdogan and all his policies . 
  [ mhp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nationalist_movement_party ) voters also hate erdogan and his islamist policies for the most part ; but they hate the pkk and `` imperialists '' even more so they are happy with the war in southeastern turkey . 
  [ hdp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peoples%27_democratic_party_ ( turkey ) voters are probably happy with the possibility of a free kurdistan in the near future . 
  they hate erdogan , especially his foreign policy more than anyone else and think erdogan is to blame for the end of the peace process between the turkish government and the pkk . 
  i remember that , we also had politicans debate on tv before our sultan decided he was too good for that . 
  pretty much every country 's history is written on blood, 
  i love you, 
  it 's totally ok to be anti-islam , does n't mean it 's right to blame an entire religion for the actions of one group . 
  30 people died in brussels and i felt for every single person that died there ; but i also feel for the 165.000 civilians that died in iraq because us just felt like invading the country - so when we are talking about terrorism and the lives of civilians do n't pretend to be `` right '' and just say `` i do n't mind people dying as long as i do n't feel close to them . '', 
  we all know why he thinks europe is not a safe place anymore , we all know what he means when he says things like [ this ] ( https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/712248639947730944 ) , he is a pretty smart guy . 
  he knows his anti-muslim rhetoric gets him [ votes ] ( http://www.politico.com/story/2015/12/poll-muslim-ban-support-216748 ) and he needs to avoid a convention so he 's probably going to increase his anti-muslim comments even more . 
  refugees from turkey = refugees that come from iraq , syria and afghanistan . 
  no it 's erdogan is evil week and it 's true so that 's fine . 
  http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkey-jordan-boost-ties-amid-syrian-crisis.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=96968&amp;newscatid=510 i think i am done trying to correct false news about turkey at this point . 
  it 's too much work and is making me sympathetic towards erdogan and i do n't like that . 
  when are we supposed to stop saying `` turning '' ? 
  because hdp is linked to them , so is pyd . 
  http://aa.com.tr/en/world/pkk-pyd-same-thing-says-krgs-barzani/542781 pkk has many weapons provided by european countries like portugal , germany and france . 
  they are ultimately going to have to, 
  we can realize the facts and not believe every article on the internet . 
  just open the website and read the article , according to the article king abdullah thinks refugees are terrorists so turkey is to blame for the terror attacks because it exports `` terrorism '' via the refugees . 
  when in reality no refugee has committed an act of terrorism yet ... king abdullah is n't that ignorant ; but the idiot that wrote this article obviously is . 
  do you know what kind of insults you have to put up with as a turk online ? 
  it gets very hard to tell if people came up with a new insult for you or they are being sarcastic : /, 
  he went from 10k followers to 260k in 3 days , lol . 
  it 's not really a natural muslim reaction to pick up a bomb and explode self . 
  believe me there is a reason only terrorist groups do it . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_terrorism but maybe i misunderstood you, 
  if these people were brought up by moderate values that puts human life 's value high , these people are not going to decide to blow themselves up . 
   with sunni upbringing , every person is not far from becoming extremist what im telling you is that not every sunni upbringing is the same . 
  hanafi sunni-islam almost has no way of turning someone into an extremist . 
  the reason there are extremists outside of salafi-wahhabi countries is the influence of saudi imams on the mosques of the muslim world . 
  these imams are literally isis recruiters . 
  are non-extremist practicing muslims compatible with modern society ? 
  but extremist ideology is a much bigger problem these days . 
   but i 'm also fairly certain , the target is not the pkk , it 's public opinion , ie an attempt by the gov to drive a divide between the anti-rte front that was developing a few years back , and to obliterate any hdp support that was growing among regular turks around this time last year . 
  i do n't know for sure if the target is public opinion or not ; but it 's certainly not kurdish civilians . 
  you can be sure that hdp support among turks , or even among the majority of the kurds is mostly diminished now . 
  they should n't have backed the pkk . 
  `` moderate islam '' is a meme at this point , the only way to counter the spreading of this cancerous ideology of radical islam is atheism . 
  educate these extremists on what atheism is and why it makes a lot more sense than islam , with as much solid-proof as possible .
