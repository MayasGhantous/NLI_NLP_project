after this selection , fuck eskisehir also fuck zonguldak too which is the town i was born . 
  [ look at this !, 
  i was so proud !, 
  ] ( http://haberneo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/se%c3%a7im-sonu%c3%a7lar%c4%b1-harita.jpg ) ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ theredinthemiddleonandtheoneinthenorth, 
  both . 
  itt : `` how the fuck do i get out of this country '' and `` fuck erdogan '' . 
  that moment when i see the word `` turkey '' on reddit when only there is a bombing happening in somewhere . 
  idiocracy is starting right here . 
  it 's all around me and i ca n't escape . 
  you have no idea . 
  try to imagine lawyers . 
  if every lawyer were not to defend any bad guys , when do you think it will begin to spread to the other side of the line ? 
  when does someone good start to become bad ? 
  or the opposite ? 
  what is good and bad ? 
  it 's subjective not objective . 
  we are just a one big butthurt country . 
  according to that link every single atheists on turkey should be in jail , lol . 
  my life 's purpose is trying to be open-mind like you . 
  like your countrymen . 
  this argument is , if you think about it , is a lot similar to being a lawyer . 
  why do lawyers defends an obvious criminal ? 
  because everyone deserves fair trial , justice and right to defend . 
  even if means to defend someone a very very bad person . 
  but if you give up in the middle of somewhere that chain will get lose and just like under the term of `` insulting statesman '' the thin line will disappear . 
  and if you are a country full of idiots , those idiots will try to worship just because he is `` president '' . 
  that 's why i prefer head of state it sounds less , significant ... 
  [ i just realized there is very big wikipedia page for our latest elections . 
  here it is if you want to read it . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_general_election,_november_2015 ), 
  i think it 's called `` head of state '' instead of president . 
  [ first of all : click 1 year ] ( http://uk.investing.com/currencies/usd-try ) [ second : here are some data from the oecd countries . 
  ] ( https://data.oecd.org/turkey.htm ) take a look at our education . 
  you might think it 's not relevant to economics but you 're wrong . 
  this has been the case for the last 4-5 years . 
  if you think about university graduations it 's very relevant since we do n't do any innovations whatsoever . 
  [ \\ ( here is austria if you want to compare . \\ ) ] ( https://data.oecd.org/austria.htm ) unemployment rate is % 10.2 . 
  our trade was always bad as a country if you were to look at number we were growing/developing . 
  this year 's numbers are at almost below zero . 
  plus in terms of economics , % 3-4 growing number is just standard , it will grow whether you try to improve or not . 
  our most gdp ( let 's say this turkey 's income as whole ) comes from tourism which also comes from russia . 
  [ well until the last year 's scandal . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_russian_sukhoi_su-24_shootdown ) it 's all go down from there . 
  [ also i forgot that we had more than 25 bombings only in 2016 . ], 
  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:suicide_bombings_in_turkey ) it just poured salt on the wound . 
  now would you ever consider visiting turkey as a tourist after the bombings ? 
  if no , then try to imagine foreign companies and investors who is trying to make money on our land . 
  more than 5 big companies left turkey only this year . 
  i would list more but i think this includes some of the major cases . 
  i hope it helped you . 
  edit : changed a word . 
  you have a good argue , i respect that but you must also consider the difference between a direct swearing and an insult within the opposition text post ( ? ) . 
  which in that case how do you exactly separate those two ? 
   so in that case , it is very important to seperate `` yourself '' while posting something right ? 
  for example if i post `` son of xxx erdogan '' then is that a legimate opposition ? 
  if somebody calls my name in twitter like this , i would like to sue him also , this is not freedom of speech , this is insult . 
  it 's an insult but the problem is there is a bloody law for it . 
  it 's against to law to insult to the head of state . 
  try to imagine a government like that . 
  a one insult and you are in jail with , i do n't know , some thief or someone who is in jail for attempting murder . 
  how is that fair ? 
   but why those social media users does not put some distance from terrorists ( sorry bad english ) ? 
  basically it is troll propaganda , you push to the limits , and when you got arrested you are `` basic civilian opposer arrested by dictatorship '' . 
  sorry but most kurd opposers does that . 
  it is like isis/el nusra holding civilians in the city ( pkk did it this year too ) and try to push governments to the limits of genocide . 
  i could n't understand your argue here . 
  you 're right but just be honest , what is your guess about how many of those arrests are really `` supporting terrorist '' and how many `` insulting statesman '' ? 
  [ here is the turkish one if you are interested \\ ( warning : h\u00fcrriyet \\ ) ] ( http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/twitter-facebook-ve-youtubedan-1656-kisiye-tutuklama-40316149 ), 
  the more people become uneducated and ignorant the more he has a chance to win again . 
  beside , he is the head of state right now . 
  even if the akp loses the election , erdogan remains in that position . 
  my thoughts : before everything i was just concerned about , let 's say the changing state of people 's mentality . 
  the switch of ideology . 
  but now , our economy is at it 's worst . 
  not enough people recognize that right now . 
  i study economics so it 's waay to obvious to me . 
  still a lot of people realize the situation too but the effects still are not here . 
  if tourism does not come back this summer , the consequences will be unimaginable . 
  i love this comment chain . 
  i have no idea why . 
  idiocracy is a documentary now . 
  the problem is not getting flooded with it imo . 
  it 's just ... they are low-effort threads . 
  one link and a title and you guarantee at least 300 karma . 
  you could put a regulation over it and make it self posts . 
  people do n't want to see the post . 
  they want to see something different and make it a discussion about it . 
   it makes it impossible to use it for what most people come here - which is politics and news . 
  there are other subreddits for that . 
  i want to come here because , well , to see europe . 
  or the trends so to speak . 
  yeah , trends . 
  what is europe talking about right now ? 
  they are not bad threads , it 's just they are overflooded . 
  you guys could open weekly or daily threads to discuss things instead of sticking season 3 eu4 campaign . 
  i really suggest taking a good hard look at / r/games and how it splits discussion threads and news threads . 
  it 's getting worse . 
  2016 crushed our economy by half . 
  we are not productive well enough . 
  so must of our income comes from tourism .
