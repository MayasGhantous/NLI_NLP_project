are you san marinese ? 
  your free kebab 10 upgrade is ready !, 
  - the access for journalists in cities bombed by the army is blocked . 
  some journalists formed a group called haber n\u00f6beti ( news guard ) to report from the south east , and every few days some of them get arrested . 
  for example a journalist was arrested 4 days ago : http://www.birgun.net/haber-detay/haber-nobeti-ekibinden-tugba-tekerek-gozaltina-alindi-107630.html a photojournalist was arrested and then expelled from the kurdish areas 5 days ago : http://www.demokrathaber.net/medya/foto-muhabiri-uygar-onder-simsek-silopi-disina-cikartildi-h66282.html - dutch journalist frederike geerdink was caught reporting on a canl\u0131 kalkan ( live shield ) . 
  when there are low-level clashes between pkk and police , civilians interrupt them and try to calm down the situtation . 
  this is very common in the south east . 
  ` you must vote for at least one ' this is not how a poll with such a question works . 
  she has been living in turkey for years , she knows . 
  either a typo or a difficult-to-get innuendo . 
  in 2010 the constitution was thoroughly revised , which many consider as the end of the coup that started in 1980 . 
  tl ; dr without getting into details : - turkish mps enjoy parliamentary immunity against civil and criminal prosecution . 
  - to lift the immunity , each case against an mp has to be discussed individually . 
  - the parliament wants to lift the immunity altogether . 
  the parties disagree on the ` details ' : - akp ( erdogan ) and its puppet the nationalist mhp want to send all pending cases to justice but keep the immunity for future cases . 
  - chp ( secular-kemalist ) and hdp ( kurdish-liberal ) want to abolish the parliamentary immunity altogether . 
  - there are around 500 cases pending . 
  there are 0 cases against davutoglu , who is the prime minister and leader of akp , and more than 50 against the chp leader and against the hdp leaders ( hdp has always two leaders - a man and a woman ) - background : akp controls the judiciary and wants to silence the kurdish mps asap . 
  most of the cases against them are for supporting a terrorist organization ( pkk ), 
  this is what i looked up first when i read the article . 
  105 thousand japanese citizens entered turkey in 2015 turkish statistical institute : http://www.tuik.gov.tr/preistatistiktablo.do?istab_id=320, 
  he is not blaming the eu for the result . 
  he is accusing the eu for not reacting , and giving an explanation why the eu acts like this . 
  stop being an ass . 
  the article only mentions the fight in the plenary . 
  there are fist fights in the commissions too , many ( just yesterday at least 5 ) members of the parliament went to hospital . 
  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6brr3de21a4 https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rzeuey7_dec i doubt they will manage to work in the next days . 
  you treated bulgaria with a [ san stefano ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_san_stefano#effects ) they will love you . 
  `` fuck you deatox '' - albania , jordan , moldova , cyprus the two most beautiful countries in the balkans : bosnia and herzegovina at least we have no border with greece and iran any more . 
  but \u00e7ekmece , sarma , yorgan , b\u00f6brek ( maybe more ) are originally turkish . 
  now i think you are trolling . 
  the numbers ** from your source ** are : 385k in middle school , plus 546k in highschool , total 931k . 
  and you can add the 121k in distance-learning-highschools ( a\u00e7\u0131k\u00f6\u011fretim ) , grand total 1052k . 
  you just picked the islamic highschool students , but you forgot that erdo\u011fan reopened islamic middle schools , for children between 10-14yo . 
  i put a link with all years in my previous post . 
  you said `` imam hatip students are in decline . '', 
  i can not do anything more to convince you . 
  do you live abroad ? 
  imam hatip students : ~ 400 thousand in the 90 's 70 thousand in 2002 , when akp won the elections 930 thousand last year http://www.dogrulukpayi.com/beyanat/5549bb343acbb i wont translate but here is another list about the islamification of the education : - din e\u011fitimi okul \u00f6ncesi , ilkokul 1 , 2 ve 3 ' \u00fcnc\u00fc s\u0131n\u0131flarda zorunlu oldu , e\u011fitimin b\u00fct\u00fcn kademelerinde dini ve manevi de\u011ferler e\u011fitimi dersi getirildi . 
  we will see in 5 years . 
  i remind you it was the third highest official of turkey who said yesterday that `` we need a new and religious constitution '' and that `` before all else , secularism must not be part of it '' . 
  the american embassy warned last night to avoid tourist sites in turkey . 
  this is not correct . 
  a female isis suicide bomber exploded in january 2015 in sultanahmet istanbul . 
  they 've been working on it for years and nothing has been decided since they didnt agree on anything . 
  there are two hot topics : - the kurdish issue , which includes language use and definition of ` citizen ' . 
  - the governance system , if we will remain a parliamentarian republic or a presidential republic . 
  none . 
  all the structures that could have organized and supported a coup were destroyed in 2007-2012 . 
  from army officers and journalists to politicians , association members and university professors , thousands were imprisoned ( some killed ) . 
  it is an honest opinion of many turks . 
  there is a feeling that ` they ' ( the west ) ` hate us because we sieged vienna/we are muslims , and they do n't want us to be strong ' this leads to crazy conspiracy theories : the taksim protests [ were paid for by lufthansa ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/13/erdogan-turkey-protests-telekinesis-conspiracy-theories ) because the new istanbul airport will weaken lufthansa 's role , [ zdf attacks erdo\u011fan ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3hjjggrbk0 ) because the new bosporus bridge will make turkey stronger , the journalist in this cartoon being blond is [ ` covert racism ' and ` most western people use erdo\u011fan-insults as a cover for their turkish hate ' ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/turkey/comments/4gcaip/the_long_arm_of_erdogan_cartoon_on_todays_front/d2glog7 ), 
  the reaction of some turks in twitter and in / r/turkey ? 
  `` de telegraaf is racist because the journalist has blue eyes and blond hair . 
  erdogan-insults are a cover of most western people 's turkish hate '' 1 . 
  [ her eyes in the cartoon ] ( http://www.imgur.com/wgmcawl ) are not blue ( screenshot directly from de telegraaf site ) 2 . 
  she has blondish hair in the [ photograph ] ( http://www.imgur.com/rls82fn ) in the same page . 
  random fact : the belarussian ruble will be redenominated at a rate of 10000:1 in june . 
  previously the highest-value banknote was the 200000 ruble ( 20 new ruble , 9 euros ) . 
  the hightest banknote of the new rubble is 500 ( 225 euros ) [ old banknotes ] ( http://www.nbrb.by/engl/coinsbanknotes/banknotes ) -- [ new banknotes ] ( http://www.banknotenews.com/files/02c577e0f526e65e6551241600b4d4e9-3682.php ) the news banknotes were printed in 2009 , but because of the crisis they postponed the redenomination . 
  which post seems insane to you ? 
  i translated this quote in my [ post above ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4g78ph/torchlight_procession_in_yerevan_pays_tribute_to/d2fbzw9 ) my translation of said quote :  this land belongs to turks , it has always been and will always be turkish '' your translation  these lands were historically turkish , so therefore it is turkish and will be turkish for eternity this is getting reddit-drama level . 
  read again what i wrote , what fotte asked and what i replied . 
  it says `` anas\u0131l '' which literally means first , principally , fundamentally , originally . 
  these lands , that were first turkish and turanian , were seized by the \u0130ranians ... 
  etc etc and a timeline follows , according to which the greeks came after the turks . 
  if you still insist that im mistranslating , i can do nothing to prove to an english speaker that im right . 
  edit : if you think how can atat\u00fcrk say something so blatantly wrong ... 
  he is refering to the hittites , which he considered turkish . 
  he did that to present these lands as righteously turkish . 
  i dont know if he really believed this . 
  he said : first it was turkish , then the iranians seized it , then it fell in the hands of alexander the great , then the egyptians settled , then the romans invaded , then the byzantines got it , then the arabs kicked the byzantines and finally our same-race turks came again and gave it back to its original owners . 
  wrong facts , misinterprtations and twisting the truth , but when judging him remember that it was a period of nation-making . 
  he was trying to build a nation and most people did not have a turkish national consciousness/identity . 
  for the turkish speakers : p306 , after an ` asil t\u00fcrk ve turan\u00ee ... 
  when did hdp or bdp side with him ? 
  a common argument against the genocide is that armenians in east turkey sided with the enemy and they were killed . 
  however the same happened with armenians in west turkey , artists , university professors , even seven armenian members of the ottoman parliament were executed . 
  fun fact about armenian artists : atat\u00fcrk himself said `` armenians have occupied our arts ... the armenians have absolute no right in this land . 
  this land belongs to turks , it has always been and will always be turkish '' context : the majority of the artists were christians . 
  atat\u00fcrk said in a speech that the previous regime didnt like muslims doing art ( it was kind of haram ) and he wanted more turks in this sector . 
  source in turkish : [ page 305-306 ] ( http://atam.gov.tr/wp-content/uploads/s\u00d6ylev-orj\u0130nal.pdf ), 
  in hamburg , germany they have a memorial for the genocide of the namibian people . 
  no german is happy about this . 
  in turkey some people think like this : http://www.imgur.com/e0ff4lj translation : happy 100th anniversary of the cleansing of the armenians from our country . 
  we feel proud of our great ancestors . 
  i think it was a genocide but i dont like such laws . 
  i also dont think that holocaust denial should be a crime . 
  saying the earth is flat is not a crime either . 
  freedom of speech should be restricted as little as possible . 
  he literally apologized for what his fathers and grandfathers did !, 
   it 's unjust , but not related to the topic i posted it to show that the kurdish party does not have any real power within the state , they are persecuted themselves . 
  and the kurdish party never sided with erdogan , it was them who said `` we will not make you president '' ( seni ba\u015fkan yapt\u0131rmayaca\u011f\u0131z ) . 
  erdogan did have the conservative kurdish vote until the june 2015 elections . 
  when consevative kurds moved to the kurdish party , the army started [ bombing their cities ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=batewavji9g ) anyway i start feeling ugly for badmouthing my country that much . 
  this discussion is over for me . 
  i dont know what else the kurdish party can do . 
  it is the opposition , has apologized and said they will recognize the genocide if they win the elections . 
  if you mean the kurdish nationalists in general , how can they apologize if not through their party ? 
  fun fact : every day many kurdish politicians get arrested http://t24.com.tr/haber/dbpli-bulanik-belediye-es-baskani-tutuklandi,337573 http://www.internethaber.com/ocalanin-kuzeni-ve-dbpli-baskan-tutuklandi-1586856h.htm http://www.evrensel.net/haber/278003/dbpli-belediyeye-bu-kez-esbaskanlik-sorusturmasi-acildi http://www.aksam.com.tr/guncel/dbpli-baskan-simsek-tutuklandi/haber-509146 all this week and today,
