  these are obvious lies from a system many of us do not trust any more . 
  they seemed all pretty chill guys, 
  i dont know how popular he is now . 
  he used to be powerful , but the media and the enterprises controlled by his movement have been seized by the government . 
  key people have been imprisoned , forced to leave turkey or rendered harmless . 
  i dont think he can influence the vote of his followers . 
  i doubt he claimed to be a prophet , that sounds like propaganda from erdo\u011fan 's side . 
  it was opened by the g\u00fclenists when the turkish government seized their newspaper . 
  their articles are very reliable , but they have an anti-erdo\u011fan agenda . 
  and dead . 
  please dont upvote this . 
  this is last week 's new , a minor incident , and this guy has said worse , namely he thinks people from abroad are actively trying to kill erdo\u011fan with telekinesis ( mentioned in the article ), 
  his origins lie in the islamic party . 
  there are always \u0130slamists that find other \u0130slamists wrong though . 
  al qaeda hates isis for example . 
  - the akps stronghold is not istanbul . 
  https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:turkish_general_election,_november_2015_ ( akp ) . png - * `` 80 % of it votes for either the islamists , kemalists or the grey wolves . 
  '' * the three parties you implied are the three largest parties , with a total share of 85 % in turkey . 
  cihangir , where the attack happened , is the most progressive neighbourhood in \u0130stanbul . 
  most westerners live there , many artists and leftists too . 
  we have sacrifices in islam . 
  while she was the interior minister , she warned a mafia boss of his imminent arrest . 
  the mafia boss run away . 
   ak\u015fener joined her centre-right true path party ( dyp ) , before switching to the ultranationalist mhp in 2007 following the decline of the dyp . 
  she joined akp , erdo\u011fan 's newly founded party , in 2001 . 
  a few months later she joined mhp , the nationalists . 
   as interior minister , she once referred to pkk leader abdullah \u00d6calan as `` armenian offspring , '' a remark for which she later apologised . 
  her apology was : i didnt mean the armenians who live in turkey , i meant the armenians as a race/nation . 
  doesnt make any difference . 
  even if his diploma is fake , no court will force him to quit . 
  and nobody can convice erdo\u011fan supporters either , so no image damage . 
  we should stop losing our time with this issue . 
  - they dont come from the same political tradition . 
  ckmp comes from the demokrat parti . 
  t\u00fcrke\u015f founded the conservative party ( muhafazakar parti ) after the coup , which was later renamed to mhp . 
  they sometimes cooperated with the conservatives ( 1991 with refah , for example ) - they are not secular . 
  they are not as conservative as akp , but closer to akp than chp . 
  survey from 2015 http://imgur.com/0ccwfd2 http://m.imgur.com/lhruyml - you are right about the education level , but this is not a political criterion http://m.imgur.com/8c7t6ah, 
  why did you add the islamist-nationalists ( mhp ) and the seculars ( chp ) in one group ? 
  the map shows which party won the majority in each province . 
  most people understand this . 
  many europeans think that istanbul has a secular majority , or that turkey is divided in half , a secular block in the west and erdo\u011fan in the east . 
  this map helps breaking down these misconceptions . 
  set of maps with the results per party : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_general_election,_november_2015#nationwide_results, 
  election results map : http://secim.haberler.com yellow : erdo\u011fan red : seculars purple : kurds, 
  they are `` exploited children '' as you said , they are victims . 
  what are the differences between eea , efta and customs union ? 
  were they mocking the scammers or the victims here ? 
  i understand but i dont think this is reasonable at all . 
  `` come and work in germany for 10 years '' is different to `` you are allowed to visit germany for 30 days '', 
  dont worry , i dont think bicycles use the lane . 
  it just looks nice for the election brochure . 
  ` in the last 4 years , we built 140km of bicycle lanes ', 
  why are europeans against visa-free travel from turkey ? 
  you may dislike/hate erdo\u011fan , islamists or refugees , but this arangement will allow us to stay a few days and then we , turks , will have to leave . 
  it is not a residency or work permit , it is just a 30 day visa-free holiday . 
  the majority of the turks who will visit europe are upper-middle class , educated , secular western turks . 
  what can i do ? 
  i vote , i go to protests and demonstrations . 
  we shouldnt start posting about the nationalists , otherwise / r/europe will be overwhelmed . 
  but since you started : turkish nationalists protesting in front of the german embassy , claiming there was no genocide and shouting `` a dead armenian is a good armenian '' to prove their claims . 
  [ cochineal insect ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cochineal ) is used since the antiquity to make [ carmine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carmine ) , a red food dye . 
  i carry that flag in my heart , c\u00eewan . 
  why do you have a star next to your name ? 
  all * these * officials , including the president , the prime minister and some ministers . 
  a couple of years ago , someone wanted to boycott israel . 
  he bought all the cocacola and fanta from a market , opened them and spilled them down the drain : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibtqcp2cuss, 
  cahil , not functional illiterates . 
  - isis from syria killed at least 21 people in turkey : http://kentgazetesi.biz/kiliste-olu-sayisi-21e-yukseldi/ - the homegrown isis sympathisers were in isis in syria before : http://www.radikal.com.tr/turkiye/dokumacilar-suriyeye-gecerken-devlet-onlari-dinliyormus-1453585/ the kurds are persecuted every day . 
  you live abroad and are a nationalist , but if you want to be honest with yourself here are some examples : - the kurdish party was not allowed to hold a meeting 2 days ago in \u0130zmir , a western city : http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/hdp-izmirde-miting-gerceklestiremedi-toplanti-yapti-40113234 - the kurds were not allowed to celebate their new year : http://www.milliyet.com.tr/istanbul-da-nevruz-kutlamasina-gundem-2210784/, 
  the explosion today was in the center of istanbul , close to the grand bazaar , one of the largest touristic attractions . 
  - give kurds equal rights so that they dont resort to terrorism . 
  - let ypg close the border to block isis from entering turkey . 
  - keep a religion-friendly/moderate muslim government to appease the local islamists . 
  - dont meddle in foreign countries ( by supporting islamists in syria for example ) . 
  there is a map in the link above . 
  the west coast and the european part of turkey votes secular . 
  southeast votes kurdish . 
  the rest votes erdo\u011fan . 
  - a car bomb exploded at 8:40 in the morn\u0131ng . 
  - the explosion took place in a busy neighbourhood , close to the grand bazar and istanbul university . 
  - at least 11 dead ( 7 of them policemen ) and 36 injured . 
  both of these facts are disputed . 
  the south-east of turkey , where kurds live , is underdeveloped . 
  we dont really have statistics about the fertility rate based on ethnicity , since ethnicity is not officialy recorded . 
  we have statistics about regions , and we know which region is kurdish - or turkish-majority . 
  they could put you in jail before ( [ article 301 - wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/article_301_of_the_turkish_penal_code ) ) and it has been softened in 2008 . 
  the target are not tourists , but journalists , kurds , the opposition , leftists . 
  i doubt a tourist was ever jailed or fined for this . 
  ebru umar , mentioned below , is a journalist who also carries the turkish citizenship . 
  no freedom of press , oppression of minorities , persecution of leftists are legitimate reasons to boycott turkey . 
  putting tourists in prison is not . 
  edit : fixed link, 
   the eu , along with russia , must support christian armenia as it is surrounded by hostile islamic states : turkey , azerbaijan , and iran . 
  russia and \u0130ran are friendly towards both armenia and azerbaijan . 
  iran is not hostile towards armenia . 
  a bad economy will put a lot of pressure on erdo\u011fan , but i do not want my countrymen to suffer . 
  - the personal cult around erdo\u011fan reached these levels after gezi , in 2013 . 
  many people realise it and feel very uncomfortable . 
  - there is a narrative that predates erdo\u011fan .
