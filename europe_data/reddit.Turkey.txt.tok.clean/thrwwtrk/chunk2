  ok we can discuss but let us keep the discussion honest : - the kurdish politician said : `` we the grandchildren are feeling today the pain our grandfathers and fathers caused , by participating in this massacre . 
  we will never forget , and we must not forget . 
  we ask from our yezidi , assyrian and armenian brothers to forgive us '' - a * swedish * ( of assyrian ancestry , a victim of the genocide ) member of parliament said : `` it was not ` the kurds ' , it was the state buying some feudal chiefs '' - the kurdish politician apologized , didnt say ` minor role ' and didnt mention feudal chiefs . 
  the kurdish party has apologized for the role of the kurds in the genocide . 
  http://www.radikal.com.tr/politika/ahmet-turk-ezidi-suryani-ve-ermenilerden-ozur-diledi-1252968/ to say that `` the kurds were the ones that massacred armenians '' , implying that attrocities were commited only by kurds , is wrong . 
  to clarify : these are the mottos of the campaign linked in the op , not mine . 
  the word papaz is greek . 
  not the idiom . 
  read a few more words and you will understand . 
  but your denial is funny !, 
  today is the 24th of april . 
  the anniversary of ` nothing happened to the armenians ' . 
  before the genocide deniers say that is was a war in the east etc etc. 
  around 2500 * istanbul * armenian intellectuals were executed ( or arrested then killed ) . 
  most turks do not know this fact . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deportation_of_armenian_intellectuals_on_24_april_1915 the kurdish party hdp petitioned last week for the investigation of the murder or executions of 7 armenian members of the parliament in 1915 . 
  it also asked for the disclosure of the location of their graves .

  no , it is a turkish 'n' go . 
  they did the same last year , and do similar campaigns often . 
  i dont see any turkish . 
  101 years of geno-lie , turkey = truth , let history decide and factcheckarmen\u00eda.com edit : yes one of them is in turkish , thanks / u/thatguygaren, 
   he even said he would wear priest clothes for his power . 
  he said he would ` even wear a priests clothes ' if he is ordered by his ` command center ' . 
  because ` our struggle [ for power ] is not a common one ' . 
  he finds it offensive to wear a priest 's clothes ( in turkish slang a toilet is called ` priest ' ) and he is ready to commit taqiyah in order to gain power . 
  taqiyah is the accepted form of dissimulation in islam : you are allowed to deny your faith or disobey religious rules ( eg drink alohol or not wear a headscarf ) if your life is in danger or if through this deceite muslims will gain more power . 
  video turkish some subtitles ) http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=w93efie6rj4  he also said he would demolish mosques to build roads . 
  after demonstrations of university students against building a highway through a university owned campus . 
  i guess the same people who paid for the ` erdogan = truth + peace ' trucks in washington dc . 
  there is a large number ( but small minority ) of turks that live in europe that are very liberal , anti-establishment . 
  some of the people who emigrated from turkey in the 80s and 90s ( and earlier ) are leftists , alevis and kurds who were persecuted or threatened by the turkish state or paramilitaries . 
  they are practically refugees . 
  in january a teacher called in a talk show and said : `` do you know what is going on in the southeast [ the kurdish areas ] ? 
  children , mothers , innocent people are dying . 
  [ ... ] i want to say to the other teachers * who abandoned their students : shame on you [ ... ] do n't keep silent ! '', 
  the caller got arrested for doing terrorist propaganda . 
  \\* whenever the army is about to bomb a city , all teachers are invited to another city ` for training ' article ( english ) http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/should-the-tv-host-be-happy-women-and-children-are-dying.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=93726&amp;newscatid=503 video ( turkish ) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjxfgkz6smo, 
  it is a technical requirement . 
  the turkish passport does not store fingerprints , and the eu does not like this . 
  they are not compatible . 
  new passports will be issued . 
  turkey has to meet 72 requirements to get visa free travel . 
  the requirements are for example : passports should have biometric data stored , there should be a communication line between the turkish and the greek coast guard , a new data-protection law should be voted etc. 
  / u/w4hammer implies that malaysia does not fulfill these requirements . 
  seriously ? 
  there are aerial bombings against the kurds every day in turkey . 
  here is an article from today : http://www.sabah.com.tr/gundem/2016/04/21/daglica-ve-uluderede-pkkya-hava-harekati, 
  this is very very scary , im out of words . 
  in turkey they spy on us , they oppress us , they block our social media accounts , they put pressure on our employers to fire us , they fine us or put us in jail . 
  now liberal turks in the netherlands will have to worry about their families back in turkey . 
  edit : i understand that the email does not target explicitly dutch turks , but it is them who will suffer the most . 
  `` civil war '' is a term the turkish government does not accept because it implies popular support of the pkk . 
  the government calls it a `` terrorism issue '' . 
  even the term `` kurdish issue '' is controversial . 
   do n't get me wrong , i do n't think kurdish militants are blamess . 
  me neither . 
  actually the official excuse for the termination of the peace process is the murder of 2 policemen by tak , a terrorist group related to pkk . 
  they did the same 2 years ago to an american soldier in istanbul . 
  in june 2015 we had elections in turkey . 
  erdo\u011fan 's party lost a lot of votes , that went to the kurdish party . 
  the kurdish party passed the 10 % threshold and entered the parliament for the first time . 
  to curb support of the kurdish party ( which managed to attract many liberal turkish voters too ) and to attract the nationalist voters , he terminated the `` peace process '' and restarted the conflict in the southeast . 
  there is a curfew in many kurdish towns and cities , the distruction is immense as you can see in the photos . 
  in the november elections akp ( erdogans party ) votes jumped from 40 % to 49 % , and hdp ( kurdish party ) votes fell from 13 % to 10.5 % . 
  i posted it before , please watch this video from another kurdish city in turkey : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=batewavji9g and listen to the people after 1:00 . 
  edit : spelling, 
  yes , pkk said it was not them . 
  tak , another group , assumed responsibility . 
  but :  [ tak ] presents itself as a break-away faction of the kurdistan workers party ( pkk ) in open dissent with the pkk 's readiness to compromise with the turkish state . 
  analysts disagree on whether or not the two groups are in reality still linked . 
  he is from iraq . 
  i said what i had to say in my previous answers . 
  that 's the point no ? 
  it is $ currentyear . 
  what if i buy two , and one of them dies ? 
  do i constantly have to renew them until eternity ? 
  in the netherlands , when the opposing team is ajax , we say `` the one who doesnt jump is jew and jews must die '', 
  it 's a paid campaign by a turkish-american 'n' go/lobbyist . 
  more photos with different messages : https://mobile.twitter.com/ichbinilya/status/715606545401155584 and another campaign from last month : http://www.yenisafak.com/en/world/anti-pkk-daesh-trucks-tour-around-us-2439788, 
  have you seen erdogans propaganda trucks in dc yet ? 
  adjust your clocks . 
  ` dark centers ' are less common today . 
  now he blames the ` parallel structure ' ( a religious sect ) . 
  a teacher working for a religious foundation close to erdogan rapes 10 ( or 45 ) children . 
  too many turkish soldiers die in the conflict with the kurds ? 
  [ erdogan blames the ` paralel structure ' . 
  ] ( http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/parallel-officers-may-be-reason-for-heavy-casualties-in-southeast-erdogan.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=96920&amp;newscatid=338 ) 3 . 
  erdogan doesnt like some public prosecutors and judges ? 
  no problem , [ 680 judges and prosecutors get suspendend in one day ] ( http://www.sabah.com.tr/gundem/2016/03/06/680-hkim-savci-aciga-aliniyor ) . 
  all these happened this month !, 
  sources 1 . and 3 . are in turkish , sorry . 
  after the muslims discovered america http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/18/erdogan-ridicule-muslims-discovered-america, 
  [ and a few months back , in ecuador ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7gkmecb-84 ) still better than how they silence us in turkey http://i.imgur.com/bmbmbxf.jpg,

  this was his voice that day . 
  1998 : the us consul in istanbul , visiting erdogan a few weeks before his imprisonement , to declare her support . 
  mahir zeynalov , the writer of the linked article , was deported from turkey last year for ` working illegally ' . 
  he used to be a journalist for zaman , the largest daily newspaper . 
  the turkish state took control of zaman last month .
