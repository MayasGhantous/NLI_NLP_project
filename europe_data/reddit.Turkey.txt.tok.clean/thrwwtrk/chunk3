  i would n't count this one . 
  the target was military and in a war zone . 
  we should n't lump it together with attacks against civilians in west turkey . 
  ** confirmed ** - a suicide bomber exploded on istiklal , taksim , in the centre of istanbul , at 10:58 am local time - ~ ~ 1 ~ ~ ~ ~ 2 ~ ~ ~ ~ 4 ~ ~ 5 dead . 
  three israelis ( two of whom also us citizens ) , one iranian . 
  - names of the victims : simha simon demri , yonathan suher , avraham godman ( israel ) , ali reza razmhah ( iran ) - 36 injured , 7 of them seriously - 12 of the injured are foreign citizens . 
  six of them israeli citizens , 2 irish , 1 german , 1 icelandic , 1 iranian , 1 from dubai - photos : [ 1 ] ( http://i.hizliresim.com/na1nkn.jpg ) , [ 2 ] ( http://i.hizliresim.com/a3glxr.jpg ) , [ 3 ] ( http://i.hizliresim.com/lanlbg.jpg ) ( nsfl ) - ~ ~ [ video from the moment of the explosion ] ( http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/canli-bomba-erken-patladi-iddiasi-40071977 ) ~ ~ ( deleted because of media blackout ) , [ mirror ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf7mwocjfzy ) - [ more photos ] ( http://fotogaleri.hurriyet.com.tr/galeridetay/99250/2/1/istiklal-caddesinde-patlama-19032016 ) - 12:10 : media blackout started . 
  certain information and images are not allowed to be broadcasted . 
  - 19:30 : blackout lifted ** suicide bomber 's identity ** - confirmed : the suicide bomber , mehmet \u00d6zt\u00fcrk , was an isis member . 
  - kck , the major kurdish organization , `` condemned the attacks against civilians '' . 
  ** my comment ** - istiklal is the most central , most commercial , most crowded , pedestrian only street . 
  had the explosion taken place a little later , there would have been much more victims . 
  [ this is what it looks like on weekends ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c4%b0stiklal_avenue#/media/file:istiklal_busy_afternoon.jpg ) - two days ago the german highschool and the embassy and consulates of germany were closed down because of ` an imminent terrorist threat ' . 
  the governor of istanbul then said `` certain countries try to cause panic in turkey and affect negatively our public by closing their consulates . 
  i ask our people not to pay attention to such statements '' ( [ source ] ( http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/istanbul-valiliginden-alman-elciliklerinin-guvenlik-uyarisina-tepki-40070932 ) ) . 
  when cyprus joined the eu in 2004 , the gdp per capita was double of that of turkey today ( even though comparing different years is wrong ) just gdp is probably not a reason , romania and bulgaria have lower gdp per capita than turkey . 
  it does . 
  free roads , restoration of whole neighborhoods , loads of money for small programs like recycling , even streetlights for big parts of istanbul were funded by the eu . 
  you will not hear it on the news , the turkish gov presents it as its own money , its own project . 
  and when the funds ( shared amongs friends and relatives ) are over , the recycling programs mysteriously stop or the led streetlight replacement project mysteriously gets awarded to a company whose owner also owns a newspaper close to the government . 
  nothing to see here . 
  normal gas flow has been restored . 
  an iranian national gas company official stated that there was a technical issue in a natural gas compressor on the turkish side and that the problem has been fixed . 
  according to a turkish expert , the gas flow was reduced because of the cold weather in iran and this happens every year around this time . 
  i think you might be joking , but this exactly is the role of the president in a parliamentary republic, 
  s300 are defensive by design . 
  and you bought it after kardak ( imia ) . 
  kardak is a turkish island and you put your flag on it . 
  it almost led to war . 
  why did greece buy s300 ? 
  to use them against turkey . 
  extending our rule over more rocks/islets means more territorial waters under turkish control = good for the turkish economy extending our rule to more islands = great financial source because of tourism, 
  yes they are ` german ' !, 
  half of turks in turkey are also anti erdogan . 
  i dont know what you mean by ` erdogan-turkish ' , but he will retire some time !, 
  i dont like erdogan but he is useful for now . 
  he makes the majority of the turks proud ( not the seculars of course , but we are a minority ) . 
  high morale is important for the economy and the nation . 
  he fights the kurds and tries to unite our nation under islam . 
  im not muslim , but his method is succesful in neutralising kurdish seperatists . 
  he has a vision about the turkish economy , makes many reforms that are good for turkey . 
  yes he is corrupt , he steals a lot of money but our conomy under erdogan is better than ever . 
  he has a tight grip on the state aparatus and uses it in favour of turkey . 
  [ aydan \u00d6zo\u011fuz ] ( http://www.bundesregierung.de/webs/breg/en/federalgovernment/chancelleryministers/aydanoezoguz/biographie-oezoguz.html ) , minister of state to the federal chancellor and federal government i have been in germany many times , my cousins live there . 
  there are cities where you can live without speaking german . 
  i heard more turkish than german in frankfurt , mannheim , nurnberg and some places in berlin . 
  i went in k\u00f6ln and most young people spoke turkish . 
  my cousins live in a village close to nurnberg and even in the village most shops belong to turks . 
  racists remarks ? 
  check upvotes ? 
  check european hypocrisy ? 
  check, 
  honest mistake . 
  but you can not do anything so stop crying online !, 
  you kneo very well what my point is . 
  how many turkish members of the bundestag were there 10 years ago ? 
  how many turkish ministers ? 
  how many are there now and how many will there be in 10 years ? 
  how many turkish neighbors did your mother have , and how many will your children have ? 
  how many turkish cities were then in germany 20 years ago and how many are there now ? 
  because we come to your country with no money and make money slowly . 
  the next generations live better than their parents . 
  the jets didnt fly over chios and samos . 
  but fornoz ( fournoi ) and e\u015fek ( agathonisi ) are turkish islands occupied by greece , along with 13 more islands .

  they introduced this year arabic courses in primary school after 1st grade in primary schools .

  all three are accesible again . 
  we are using a vpn . 
  no , and it is not being discussed on the 9 o clock talk shows . 
  only one injured , many windows broken thats it . 
  it will be on the news again if someone takes responsibility . 
  there is a satyrical magazine similar to the onion called zaytung . 
  we often can not tell anymore if a newspiece is true or zaytung . 
  yes . 
  that the court asked for an expert 's opinion on whether gollum is a bad character or not is also true . 
  the doctor 's statement that ` he hopes that gollum will be acquited along with him is also true . 
  because of the meme he was sacked from his job in a public hospital lost 2 months ago . 
  this is the full meme : http://www.diken.com.tr/erdogana-hakarette-gollum-cezasi-doktoru-memuriyetten-men-ettiler/, 
  it was a bomb , close to a metro station . 
  it exploded seconds after a police bus drove past . 
  according to the latest reports nobody was killed but 1-6 people are injured . 
  who are the two guys in the lower left side ? 
  under obama and left over netanyahu, 
  the armenian airspace is protected by russia , and turkey violates armenia 's airspace regularly . 
  if they really want a chance , they will get one soon . 
  but the premise that russia left herself no more leverage is wrong . 
  there is a curfew in diyarbakir since noon . 
  cool_penguins is albanian and he is refering to [ skenderbeu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/skanderbeg ) who led an uprising against the ottomans . 
  i dont know . 
  istanbul was the capital of the ottoman empire and for years a rumour has been going around that erdo\u011fan wants to move the capital .
