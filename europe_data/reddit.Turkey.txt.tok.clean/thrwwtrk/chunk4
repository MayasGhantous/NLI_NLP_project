  they believe this . 
  there is a mentality that we/our ancestors ( muslims/ottomans/turks , depending on who you ask ) always make the morally correct decisions . 
  no joke . 
  i dont know the opinion in history circles , i 'm not a historian and i havent read any book about it . 
  the first internet result i found is of a [ history magazine ] ( http://www.tarihpostasi.com/141/kitaplarda-devsirme-sisteminde-hiristiyan-ailelerin-cocuklarinin-zorla-alindigina-dair-bilgiler-var-ne-derece-dogrudur-devsirme-sistemi-hakkinda-kisaca-bilgi-verir-misiniz/ ) , according to which families where competing to give their children . 
  when i say prevailing opinion i mean exactly this . 
  there are many of us who dont believe in the official history narrative any more . 
  `` christian families were happy and greatful to give their children , because they got education and a better life and some of them even became grand viziers ( prime ministers ) '' this is the prevailing opinion in turkey, 
  `` the uprisings are a result of the great powers agitating the local christian populations . '', 
  a few hours after the first twitter ban , the mayor of ankara ( with erdo\u011fan 's akp ) tweeted a smilie . 
  when opponents pointed it out , he replied that his ` dns configuration is open ' . 
  [ ^ ( source with tweet screenshots in turkish ) ] ( http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/arinc-ve-gokcek-yasagi-deldi-26052311 ), 
  most turks live in their phantasy world . 
  a few months back , erdo\u011fan 's advisor said that `` the balkans , central asia and [ northern ] africa long to be controlled by istanbul '' . 
  no , he flip flops all the time . 
  i think that his new strategy is to praise atat\u00fcrk but accuse the current secular party and secular media of d verging off atat\u00fcrk 's way . 
  he has been idolized and i find it dangerous . 
  but he is the symbol of secularism , national independence and progress . 
  this is what i respect , and not his ultra-nationalistic ideology or him as a semi-god . 
  depends on the crowd . 
  he is loved by one third , respected by one third and hated by one third . 
  there is a law according to which you can not disrespect him or his memory , but the enforcement depends on the status quo ( and your status against it ! ), 
  erdo\u011fan called him a drunkard . 
  he doesnt mind if westerners ( and their local colaborators -- aka opposition media , opposition politicians , secular bussinesmen , trade unions , ngos ) call him a dictator . 
  westerners are hypocrits and want to weaken and divide turkey . 
  they hate muslims and oppress minorities , unlike the turk who is always fair and never an oppressor . 
  this mindset is shared by many turks . 
  finally , there is certainly a crave for a strongman , not only among the religious but also among the secular turks . 
  but he doesnt present himself as a dictator , he presents himself as `` the man of the people '' , the expression of the `` national will '' . 
  every year on the 10th of november at 9:05 in the morning , the air-raid sirens blare for one minute . 
  cars stop , the subway stands still , people exit the buildings , and everybody stands still . 
  this is what it looks like : city center : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bi77tclfl9w highway : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrkjnf0kglc, 
  there are three other parties ( you forgot the nationalist mhp ) . 
  mhp will never form a coalition with the kurds and a chp-hdp coalition is not possible because the seats will never be enough in he foreseeable future . 
  in turkey , not in presidential elections . 
  in parliamentary elections , a party with less votes can get more seats . 
  seats are allocated proportionally within each of the 85 electoral districts . 
  is there a threshold in holland or wuold a party with 0,67 % win one seat ? 
  that 's not what op really asked though . 
  he meant `` can a party/a canditate get more seats than a party which got more votes '' , and he answer for germany is `` no '' . 
  turkey [ is building ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-turkey-iduskcn11y1mb ) a double wall ( concrete wall \u23e4 street \u23e4 barbed wire fence ) . 
  it is almost ready . 
  looks like a christmas postcard, 
   turkey applied to be in eu member almost 50 years ago a lie repeated every day in turkey . 
  1959 : turkey applies for associate membership in the european economic community . 
  1964 : turkey becomes associate member in the eec . 
  1987 : turkey applies for full membership . 
  eec rejects the application because of the economical and political situation . 
  1993 : the eu is founded 1997 : postmodern coup in turkey 1999 : membership application is accepted 2004 : accession talks start . 
  2013 : gezi 2016 : coup attempt,

  yea , and istanbul scores 9/10 in housing , even though housing ( prices and quality ) is one of the two main problems of the city ( the other being traffic ) . 
  happened this morning and is old news . 
  what is new however is that isis claimed the attack , even though turkish authorities and the turkish governor blamed it on pkk .

  you live in your own bubble . 
  here is what the majority of the turks think about chp : http://wowturkey.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=114454&amp;start=11200, 
  chp is accused of having ties to the terrorist dhkp-c http://www.sabah.com.tr/gundem/2016/03/06/dhkp-c-vurur-chp-savunur http://www.sabah.com.tr/gundem/2016/02/07/chpli-3-belediyede-dhkp-c-skandali http://www.takvim.com.tr/guncel/2015/04/01/chpdhkpc-iliskisi http://www.ahaber.com.tr/webtv/gundem/dhkpc-chpnin-arka-bahcesi-1430652209 http://blog.milliyet.com.tr/savci-selim-kiraz-neden-olduruldu---2---chp-ve-dhkp-c-arasindaki-dusundurucu-iliski/blog/?blogno=495160 they will call you a terrorist suporter , the same way you call hdp terrorist supporters . 
  only this party , it 's a party policy not a kurdish tradition , i should have clarified this . 
  by kurdish held i mean where hdp , the pro-kurdish party , has been elected . 
  it is not something traditional , it is a party policy to convey gender equality . 
  no other source . 
  woman joining the dance at 0:28 ( peach blazer ) and man joining at 0:43 ( white shirt ) are the co-chairs of the party . 
  this was an election ad from last year . 
  the motto was `` we are the sun , the cloud and the rain , we are women , workers , young people , we are the spring , hope , peace , we are love , equal , brothers '' to compare , [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vum6kxwfog ) was the ad of the nationalist party . 
  `` who will we give our vote to ? 
  not to the seperatists , the traitors and the ones who dont accept to live under our flag '' [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80j0fce69to ) is a very well made erdo\u011fan ad . 
  a foreign spy tries to lower the flag , but the people wont allow it . 
  i dont think this is worth a new post , but balkib is probably kurdish and very emotional now . 
  / u/mortalaa is on a propaganda spree to prove that turkey is not that bad . 
  human rights abuses ? 
  belgium has them too arresting opposition ? 
  [ spain does it too ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5b3j64/police_arrests_mayor_of_berga_a_small_village_80/ ) turkey supports isis ? 
  [ the same money that supports clinton supports isis ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/5b3bjk/assange_clinton_isis_funded_by_same_money_trump/ ) https://www.reddit.com/user/mortalaa/submitted/, 
  ^ ( edited for clarity ) the pro-kurdish hdp party has a dual-leadership system . 
  all municipalities held by hdp have two mayors , a man and a woman . 
  the party itself has two leaders ; figen y\u00fcksekda\u011f ( f ) and selahattin demirta\u015f ( m ) . 
  it does make sense ~ ~ if you read his comment . ~ ~ i decided to be less aggressive . 
  - muslims who hold dual citizenship are more likely to be disloyal to their new country than to their country of origin . 
  - it is a good thing that muslims/turks have dual nationality . 
  because when germany grows some balls , it will revoke their german nationality . 
  - if they only had one nationality , germany would not be able to revoke it . 
  he is making fun of kurds in turkey who want independence . 
  two days ago they arrested ~ 12 turkish , not kurdish , journalists of the secular newspaper cumhuriyet , and accused them of supporting the pkk . 
  in turkey they can call terrorist anyone who opposes akp . 
  turkish , kurdish , doesnt matter , we are all equally fucked . 
  once in a lifetime ? 
  they arrested cumhuriyet journalists just two days ago . 
  cumhuriyet is one of the most important terrorist supporting newspaper .

  pervin buldan will get arrested at some point . 
  leyla zana is a symbol ( she has been to jail for talking kurdish in the parliament ) , it is difficult to arrest her now . 
  garo paylan is armenian from \u0130stanbul , he is talking to much but will not get arrested ; they will try to silence him some other way probably . 
  pot farming was not illegal , the new law just made it legat to cultivate cannabis in one more province ( turkey has 81 ) . 
  i dont know why all the fuss . 
  not exactly a myth . 
  there is an eu regulation that prescribes how long bananas should be ( among other things ) .
