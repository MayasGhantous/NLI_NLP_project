  he says that his family is from rize ( a city in turkey and the ottoman empire ) since at least 1850 . 
  he does n't even mention georgians . 
  he just says that `` maybe we came from somewhere else [ before 1850 ] , the ottoman empire was huge '' . 
  stop spreading wrong information . 
  he is turkish and muslim .

  i 'm somewhat hijacking this discussion to share : 1 . a video that is actively being censored at the moment in turkey : turkish soldiers throwing a pkk member and executing another one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj1jkxeh_ak 2 . that 10 newspapers ( among them the leftist \u00d6zg\u00fcr g\u00fcndem and the kurdish-language azadiya welat ) and 2 news agencies ( among them the only large kurdish news agency diha ) were closed down today . 
  3 . that according to a new decree of law ( turkey has a state of emergency , laws need not to pass from the parliament ) university rectors/chancellors will be appointed by the government and not elected any more . 
  do you have a source ? 
  because ive heard it many times but people contest it . 
  you are right , but that 's what the ministeria decree calls it . 
  turkey was eet/eest ( ie gmt +2 and gmt +3 in summer ) . 
  this year we decided to abolish daylight saving time , and at the end of october we will not change out clocks back and will move to gmt +3 .

  we either use 2 different shades of red or a totally different colour .

  he accuses the kemalists of signing a treaty in 1923 that gave these islands to greece . 
  the truth is that most of these islands where taken by the greeks much earlier ( up to a hundred years earlier ) and that 12 of them were given to \u0130taly by a war lost by the ottomans in 1911 , and became greek after ww2 . 
  yes , they are going to `` activate the seismic fault with electromagnetic beams '' or `` detonate a natural gas field '' and cause an earthquake in \u0130stanbul . 
  `` fire in the shape of [ a nuclear ] mushroom that comes out of the sea , could be proof of an artificial earthquake '' these are real quotes . 
  same guy !, 
  ( genie in \u0130slam : bad spirit , deamon ), 
  this guy said that the americans are planning an earthquake in \u0130stanbul . 
  he is a very special person , unsurprisingly an akp ( erdo\u011fan 's party ) member . 
  his tweets and opinions are funny . 
  the fact that he gets elected ankara mayor and that many turks believe in what he says , is the sad part .

  the conservative area of fatih is still the seat of the orthodox patriarchate and used to be a greek-jewish neighborhoud . 
  in the last decades some tarikats ( sects ) have settled down and it looks like a conservative place in \u0130ran . 
  if german-greeks are anyling like german-turks , they praise turkey when in germany , and praise germany when in turkey . 
  there was anti-soviet bias . 
  the soviets had the lenin prize and the lenin peace prize , equally prestigious to nobel in the east . 
  some muslims in some countries . 
  fgm in 95 % - muslim turkey for example is unheard of . 
  actually it is the opposite . 
  both historical buildings and older maintained greek houses from the early 20th century are more earthquake resistant than buildings constructed between 1950-1990 . 
  the turkish media presents it as an operation to block the kurds from uniting your their kantons . 
  [ map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/syrian_civil_war.png ) jarabulus is on e border to turkey controlled by isis ( in black ) . 
  in yellow are the kurdish controlled areas . 
  kurds want to unify their areas . 
  jerabulus was controlled by isis for years . 
  turkey attacks now that isis started retreating because of the kurdish attacks . 
   after turkish army finishes its operation kurdish pyd/pkk will claim jarablus . 
  this looks like a white flag from turkey . 
  the majority of the turks considers pyd more dangerous than isis . 
  to me it sounds like a present to appease turkey . 
  yeni \u015eafak newspaper is very close to the goverment . 
  they are paranoid/crazy , the seculars laugh at them , but many people take them seriously .
