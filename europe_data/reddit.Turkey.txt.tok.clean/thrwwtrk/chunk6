  you are a smart guy , clear your mind and put the facts next to each other . 
  but they still cooperated after feb 2012 . 
  the balyoz verdict was announced in september 2012 . 
  2009 us embassy wire https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/09ankara1722_a.html 2011 election rumour `` g\u00fclen tried to place 75 loyal candidates on the akp ticket '', 
  - all previous coups in turkey ( 1960 , 1971 , 1980 , 1997 ) were bloodless . 
  this time over 300 people died . 
  [ a video that was published a few hours ago ] ( http://www.cnnturk.com/video/turkiye/darbe-girisimi-gununden-yeni-bir-goruntu-daha ) - they threw innocent people in jail , in cooperation with erdo\u011fan . 
  most turks here , me included , dont celebrate erdo\u011fan . 
  we consider him a corrupt , authoritarian , islamist president . 
  - erdo\u011fan and other politicians put people close to them in the judiciary , or hire family members as civil servants . 
  but a sect infiltrating the state apparatus can not be accepted . 
  if merkel was corrupt and placed only cdu supporters in key positions in the state , would you accept a putsch organized by scientology in germany against merkel ? 
  - i have no illusions that the situtation will worsen . 
  erdo\u011fan will become more powerfull , our democracy will weaken , and i am glad im leaving this country in a few months , hopefully for ever . 
  but between an islamic sect , which for decades tries to infiltrate the state and has a support of less that 1 % of the population , and a president elected by 50 % of the voters , i choose the latter . 
  december 2013 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_corruption_scandal_in_turkey erdo\u011fan 's corruption investigated by g\u00fclenists . 
  we dont know for sure why they broke up . 
  a theory : erdo\u011fan had become too strong and either he started cleaning up the g\u00fclenists or g\u00fclen started attacking erdo\u011fan . 
  another conspiratory theory : g\u00fclen is a us puppet , the us wanted to weaken or get rid of erdo\u011fan . 
  some more links from the past : - [ 60 minutes/cbs/usa - u.s. charter schools tied to powerful turkish imam fethullah gulen - documentary , 2012 ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ktl--idnm7i ) - [ g\u00fclenists : religious group infiltrating our army ] ( https://haber.140journos.com/rusen-cakir-ve-can-san-aralik-1986da-orduya-sizan-dinci-grup-fethullahcilar-haberini-ff425384591b#.vhes759oa ) article in turkish from 1987 . 
  quote from g\u00fclen : `` have patience . 
  turkey will fall in our clutches by the 2000 's '' - [ erdogan is really messing with the movement that made him , i doubt gulen movement is going down . 
  they are too organized and too massive to go down ... 
  they have roots in everything ... 
  comment in / r/turkey , 2014 ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/turkey/comments/2jszls/talk_to_me_about_fethullah_gulen/clf6wvv ), 
  - they attempted a coup . 
  - they put innocent people in jail to take their place in the state apparatus , journalists who uncovered them etc https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ergenekon_trials https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sledgehammer_ ( coup_plan ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ergenekon_trials#case_7:_odatv - they repeatedly set-up state examinations ( for university access , for becoming a civil servant , a judge , a policeman ) to help their members - they tortured or mobbed people who they saw as a hurdle in their plans . 
  i dont know their ideology in depth , but i like ther type of \u0130slam more than the one of erdo\u011fan . 
  i dont remember . 
  the relations between erdo\u011fan and g\u00fclen broke up after 17-25 december 2013 , but i think the purges started later . 
  the purges have been going on for a year , in a smaller scale . 
  for example zaman newspaper , the largest g\u00fclenist newspaper in yurkey , was seized in march : http://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-politics-gulen-iduskcn0w60fb the purge in the police happened a few months ago . 
  what kind of proof would satisfy you ? 
  his name is mithat aynac\u0131 http://www.haberturk.com/gundem/haber/1267699-emniyet-muduru-mithat-aynaci-askeri-kamuflajla-tank-icinde-yakalandi edit : here in a speech in 2012 against book piracy ( copyright ) while still in the police . 
  g\u00fclenists infiltrating the army , an article from december 1986 https://haber.140journos.com/rusen-cakir-ve-can-san-aralik-1986da-orduya-sizan-dinci-grup-fethullahcilar-haberini-ff425384591b#.rsv89weqi there were many operations against them in the past , but various governments ( especially erdo\u011fan ) allowed it to happen . 
  he was joking, 
  we have questions too , but this is not a false flag coup as you claimed in a previous comment , and the g\u00fclen mpvement has infiltrated the state apparatus , it is a well known truth . 
  * why did the coup start at 10pm ? 
  * possibly because the government was notified , and they could not wait until the morning . 
  * why did erdo\u011fan lie about almost getting killed ? 
  but the turkish media said that two f16 controlled by the putschists were close to the presidential aircraft and a greek newspaper refuted it . 
  the real question is ` why didnt the f16 bomb the aircraft or the airport ? ' . 
  i have no answer yet . 
  note that all previous coups in turkey ( and we had many of them , 1960 , 1971 , 1980 , 1997 and more ) were bloodless . 
  two remarks 1 . 
  please dont call the kamelists , it 's kemalists ( from kemal atat\u00fcrk ) 2 . 
  * `` and gulen is the one who used these lawyers and judges to hunt kamelist generals/officers ... etc. 
  more then even erdogan . 
  '' * it was erdo\u011fan together with g\u00fclenists . 
  they both wanted the kemalists out of the army , they were best allies at that point . 
  ok please watch this documentary by cbs/60 minutes https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktl--idnm7i by the way , dani rodrik is a turkish economist and ford foundation professor of international political economy at the john f. kennedy school of government at harvard university . 
  ( wikipedia ) his father in law , \u00c7etin do\u011fan , was sent to prison by erdo\u011fan . 
   he now might need allies in this purge against the gulenists , but when he 's done with them , i 'm worried that he will turn against the secular opposition and will drag turkey to more islamist course . 
  we are worried too . 
  we ( or our friends ) have been to his schools or preparation schools , we have read his newspapers . 
  it 's not a simple belief , we all know how the low levels of the sect work . 
  we had our ` abi ' ( big brother ) , we went to the ` sohbet ' ( discussions , where we had to read g\u00fclen 's books ) , we know how they chose our profession for us . 
  take a look at [ this post about experiences in g\u00fclen schools ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/turkey/comments/4v00no/seriouspeople_that_enrolled_in_g\u00fclen_schools_or/ ) and this is a reportage from 2012 by 60 minutes/cbs : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktl--idnm7i, 
  dani rodrik is a turkish economist and ford foundation professor of international political economy at the john f. kennedy school of government at harvard university . 
  ( wikipedia ) i can do nothing if you think dani rodrik is crazy . 
  he is one of the best minds that came out of turkey . 
  he published the same article here : https://www.socialeurope.eu/2016/07/fethullah-gulen-behind-turkeys-coup/ but his blog has an update , thats why i linked there . 
  every single turk knows about the g\u00fclenists and how they work , every single turk has come in contact with them . 
  note , im an atheist leftists who hates erdo\u011fan . 
  https://www.socialeurope.eu/2016/07/fethullah-gulen-behind-turkeys-coup/ dani rodrik is a respected turkish jewish academician , in a sort of exile because of g\u00fclen and erdo\u011fan ( when they were still allies ) . 
  read his wikipedia page . 
  he lives in the us and hates erdo\u011fan . 
   what is the percentage of people with gulenist ties among the arrested ? 
  we dont know yet , there have been some few cases of innocent people detained or unrelated businesses closed down ( and later released/opened again ) . 
  we will know in a few days , the secular chp opposition party has set up a monitoring comittee . 
  \u0130t seems that almost 100 % are g\u00fclenists  where is their communication with gulenist headquarters ? 
  we are not sure yet if g\u00fclen himself gave the coup order . 
  read my link above . 
  communication between g\u00fclen and his network in turkey is not something secret ( herkul.org is his site , he owned tens of newspapers/tv channels , people come and go and it is not secretive )  where are proofs of their indoctrination ? 
  they did n't just wake up one day as gulenists . 
  who recruited them ? 
  where are those people ? 
  this has been going on for over 40 years . 
  it is not something secret , every single turk knows of them , every single turk has come in contact with them . 
  the indoctrination mainly starts from his schools and dormitories .

  nobody said they were members of the sect . 
  some people imply that this sect does not exist , some articles describe him as a secluded preacher etc the photos/videos above prove at least that he has/had connections with very important people/institutions . 
  i wont go into details , i will share some photos and videos that prove how big this sect was ( and nothing more ) : - [ g\u00fclen and the pope ] ( https://galeri3.uludagsozluk.com/136/atat\u00fcrk-\u00fcn-milleti-u\u015fak-yapma-\u00e7abas\u0131_255930.jpg ) - [ bill clinton thanking g\u00fclen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpipol9-eqs ) - [ obama 's letter , presented by andy garcia , to the turkish olympiad ( g\u00fclen 's most prestigious organization ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wuhoxqlcns ) - [ g\u00fclen and erdo\u011fan ] ( http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/files/live/sites/almonitor/files/images/almpics/2013/08/fethullah%20erdogan.jpg ) - [ g\u00fclen and g\u00fcl ( turkish president until last year ) , \u00c7iler ( former prime minister ) and erdo\u011fan , in the opening of bank asya , owned by g\u00fclen ] ( http://i.sozcu.com.tr/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/04/bank-asya-a\u00e7\u0131l\u0131\u015f-i\u00e7.jpg ) - [ g\u00fclen with the chief rabbi of \u0130srael ] ( http://cdn.timesofisrael.com/uploads/2016/07/ap_9802250333.jpg ), 
  which ee country criticised which we country ? 
  this is wrong . 
  the cost of the russian intervention in syria is low , and they indeed withdrew from syria for a short period to help the ceasefire , but they are back now . 
  good luck deporting five million turks , have of them german citizens . 
  in this case they were none of the two . 
  it was just a nationalist slogan . 
  possibly because of the feeling that ` european lifes are more important than ours ' . 
   turkey has been an associate member since 1963 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/accession_of_turkey_to_the_european_union, 
  for a country to be accepted as a candidate , it has to fulfil the [ copenhagen criteria ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/copenhagen_criteria ) . 
  ( you and me both know it 's a joke .
