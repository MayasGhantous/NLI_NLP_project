  then we have to align our legislation and institution with the eu laws ( that apply to all eu members ) . 
  here is what we still have to do [ 2015 ilerleme raporu ] ( http://www.ab.gov.tr/files/5%20ekim/2015_ilerleme_raporu_tr.pdf ) ( in turkish ) . 
  read a few grey boxes after page 37 and decide for yourself : is it because the infidels dont like us , or is it our fault ? 
  1959 : turkey applies for associate membership in the european economic community . 
  1964 : turkey becomes associate member in the eec 1987 : turkey applies for full membership . 
  * eec rejects * the application because of the economical and political situation . 
  1993 : the eu is founded 1997 : postmodern coup in turkey 1999 : membership application is accepted 2004 : accession talks start . 
  2013 : gezi 2016 : coup attempt, 
  they were raped with police battons and fingers , according to the report . 
  suspension of the echr does not allow torture .

  read [ tolga-akgoz ` es comment bellow ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4u7sh7/turkey_coup_attempt_president_erdogan_orders/d5nk9bx ) they systematically infiltrated the state apparatus in the last 40 years . 
  ( think scientology ) . 
  through the judges they control they imprissoned many seculars for example . 
  the must be removed from the judiciary . 
  these are not conspiracy theories , every turk know what happened , every single one of us has some sort of experience with his movement . 
  erdo\u011fan 's akp certainly has its own web brigade and they are not hidding it / u/w4hammer however is a respectable member . 
  judging him from an one line comment which you dont agree with is slander , and it 's ugly . 
  hehe . 
  [ article 66 of our constitution ] ( https://global.tbmm.gov.tr/docs/constitution_en.pdf ) says that all turkish citizens are turks . 
  this could be a very nice thing ( as in ` everyone is equal ' ) but it is used by the nationalists , which are the majority , as a way to deny other ethnic identities . 
  and in turkish we have 2 words for * turk * . 
  * t\u00fcrk * which denotes ethnicity and * t\u00fcrkiyeli * which denotes citizenship or bond to the country . 
  but when you use the second term you are accused of being a traitor and a terrorist . 
  the vulpes vulpes kurdistanica is certainly a very seperatist fox . 
  if we let it freely roam in our country , the terrorists win . 
  edit : of course i dont mean all vulpes vulpes kurdistanica foxes . 
  only the ones who insist on calling themselves kurdistanica . 
  in this country we are all just vulpes vulpes , it is written in our constitution . 
  we also dont suppress foxes . 
  - as far as we know it is not a crackdown on opposition , but on a moderate islamic sect . 
  professors critical of the government are being removed too , but that is a slower process that started many years ago . 
  - the travel ban will be lifted soon , the situtation is not sustainable . 
  muslim/patriarchal societies are not like this . 
  he will try to show them his power and humiliate them . 
  he did some small , quiet purges in the last months . 
  there are rumours now that they were g\u00fclenists ( former deputy pm b\u00fclent ar\u0131n\u00e7 , former pm ahmet davuto\u011flu ... ), 
  damned if you do , damned if you dont . 
  i hate erdo\u011fan , but between him and the putschists , i choose the elected president . 
  things are bad and will get worse , but im glad the citizens repelled the coup . 
  i agree . 
  now imagine a country where the two most powerful persons are an islamist dictator and an islamist preacher who has infiltrated the state aparatus . 
  we know about g\u00fclen and the infiltration of the state apparatus . 
  most probably are , he owned thousand of schools , training centers and universities . 
  most of them however had no idea of the coup . 
  yea i watched that live last night . 
  she was accused of being a g\u00fclenist before . 
  this c\u00fcneyt toraman guy is disgusting by the way . 
  we have entered that period a long time ago . 
  but there were seriously rumours about \u015eafak . 
  im depressed , i need to stop following the news . 
  i havent read the article , but there were rumours ( much before the coup ) that elif \u015eafak ( the interviewed novelist ) is a member of the g\u00fclen movement ( the alleged mastermind behind the coup ) edit : i read the article and agree with her . 
  she also criticizes the g\u00fclenists .

  alas , torture took place even before the suspension . 
  they who try to impose muslim/conservative laws and culture upon you , are the same group of people that try to impose them on us . 
  we might all be turks , but we are not the same . 
  admits , hehe [ photo from yesterday ] ( http://i.internethaber.com/files/2016/7/20/1700133/1700133.jpg?v=1469020912ccdpfobabf ), 
  that depends on the circumstances , my point was that such lists exist . 
  in the list above both the guy who drinks alcohol and the guys who are g\u00fclenists have to go , the `` conservative guy who lives in his own world '' ( no 6 ) can stay and all the guys who `` are one of us '' can stay too . 
  * kalmali * means * must stay * , * gitmeli * means * must go * . 
  there were hundreds of such cases . 
  g\u00fclen and erdo\u011fan were the closest allies then , so , even though many insisted ( and the article mentions it ) that it was the g\u00fclen movement that leaked the questions , the judiciary did nothing against them , because it helped both g\u00fclen and erdo\u011fan . 
  after g\u00fclen and erdo\u011fan parted ways in 2013 , some of these cases started getting investigated . 
  smaller purges did take place , thousands of schools closed , banks universities companies close to g\u00fclen were seized ... 
  but in the last three days 60000 civil servants were suspended . 
  this would have caused an uproar and serious problems in the bureaucracy previously , but now the turks have the feeling of ` urgency ' and it is easier to pass such things . 
  i dont know what exactly they believe in , but from outside they seem a moderate , progressive type of islam . 
  they have however infiltrated the turkish state and have hunted down many people , especially secularists , who were against them . 
  a prominent case are the [ ergenekon trials ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ergenekon_trials ) . 
  summary : military officers , journalists and opposition lawmakers , all alleged members of ergenekon , a supposed secularist clandestine organization , allegedly plotting against the turkish government were convicted by g\u00fclenist judges . 
  documents and other proof was provided by g\u00fclenist media and g\u00fclenist civil servants . 
  note that at that time they were erdo\u011fan 's closest allies . 
  the travel ban will get lifted , some the suspendended civil servants will hopefully come back . 
  in a few minutes erdo\u011fan is going to announce something important , lets see . 
  a hehe excel , not very funny but acceptable !, 
   do you need help with your panties in that bunch ? 
  i do n't care about your personal history of reddit using . 
  i 'm just pointing out that you seem to have managed to contradict yourself in the span of 3 posts . 
  i wanted to show that im banned for supporting the most fierce enemy of the g\u00fclenists which you accuse me of supporting , you simpleton . 
  i am trying to explain the dynamics in turkish politics . 
  reddit is a discussion platform . 
  it is not a erdo\u011fan vs secularists thing . 
  g\u00fclenists used to be the largest supporters of erdo\u011fan and they have caused a lot of suffering to secular kemalists . 
  nationalists , which are considered opposition , are the greatest supporters of erdo\u011fan at the moment . 
  i am banned from / r/turkey for supporting the kurdish pkk ( i did not , but thats another thing ) , which is the greatest enemy of the g\u00fclenists . 
  literally the same people who staged the coup have been , together with erdo\u011fan , bombing the kurds ( [ see previous post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4tjotl/turkeys_postcoup_purge_reaches_20000/d5hxciq ) \\ ) . 
  it is complicated , i am an atheist leftist and our slogan is `` neither coup npr dictatorship '' . 
  please stop implying things if you have no idea what is going on . 
  i edited with an example list  that 's why im paranoid with my privacy online . 
  replying to your edit : of course they were not investigated in 4 days . 
  there are lists which include information on if you pray , what you vote for , if you or your wifes head is covered , whom you are close to , your ethnic background , whom you can influence etc.
