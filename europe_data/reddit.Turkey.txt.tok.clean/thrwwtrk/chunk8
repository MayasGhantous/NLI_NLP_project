  these lists are prepared by parties , the secret service , the g\u00fclenists etc and include sivil servants , teachers , journalists , businessmen ... 
  many of these lists have been leaked . 
  edit : this http://imgur.com/f0mw1gv is an example of an old list about airport directors , prepared by erdo\u011fan 's party . 
  political orientation , religiosity , closeness to g\u00fclen , their opinion about erdo\u011fan , if he drinks alcohol ... all included in the list , which played a role on who would be appointed as an a\u015frport director in 2013 . 
  no , i tried to show one way they used to infiltrate the state . 
  another way : a g\u00fclenist newspaper blames innocent but anti-g\u00fclenist civil servants for something . 
  they are sent to the court , g\u00fclenist judges put them in jail . 
  now you are free to fill their position with people close to you . 
  they did that in the [ ergenekon trials ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ergenekon_trials ) for example . 
  i understand and i am worried too , because i am sure that many of the people removed have nothing to do with g\u00fclen . 
  they are just people not loyal to erdo\u011fan . 
  you said you dont udnerstand why and i tried to give an explanation . 
  the 23 tv stations whose license was revoked for example , where close to the g\u00fclen movement . 
  example : when there were exams for law graduates to become judges , g\u00fclenists from the exam commitee shared the questions with loyal students . 
  most new judges were g\u00fclenists . 
  this happened in many branches ( police , university entry exams etc ), 
  im not condoning his actions just giving an explanation , please dont downvote . 
  erdo\u011fan blames the [ g\u00fclen movement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/g\u00fclen_movement ) for the coup . 
  the movement 's main job is education . 
  they control 140 charter schools in the us for example . 
  they own/control thousands of schools , universities and training centres in turkey . 
  their graduates have infiltrated the state mechanism in the last years . 
  this is an attempt to clean the state mechanism from them . 
  he has been doing pro-erdo\u011fan propaganda since the coup attempt . 
  erdo\u011fan shills are trying to discredit the leaks https://np.reddit.com/r/turkey/comments/4tn9kr/wikileaks_we_appear_to_have_won_our_24h_cyberwar/d5is1qv https://np.reddit.com/r/turkey/comments/4tnci3/release_294548_emails_from_turkeys_ruling/d5iz39h, 
  nah , we 've been doing so since always . 
  my fellow muslim brothers are doing allah 's work already there !, 
  you are correct , but my post above is correct too . 
  g\u00fclen 's role in the ergenekon trials is very basic knowledge for anyone living here . 
  i had other plans but now i will come to norway and make you a muslim , 
  they are literally the same people . 
  general adem huduti for example . 
  the head of the 2 . 
  army , responsible for the southeast . 
  1st of march 2016 : [ adem huduti , the commander who cleaned cizre and \u015e\u0131rnak ] ( http://www.sabah.com.tr/gundem/2016/03/01/iste-cizre-ve-suru-temizleyen-komutan-org-adem-huduti ) 18th of july 2016 : [ commander of the 2 . army adem huduti arrested ] ( http://www.sabah.com.tr/gundem/2016/07/18/2-ordu-komutani-adem-huduti-tutuklandi ) there are tens of generals who murdered kurds and razed kurdish cities , and are now accused of organizing the coup . 
  i tried . 
  i demonstrated , i voted , i observed the elections and guarded the ballot , i did what i could via social media . 
  there is not one opposition . 
  leftists ( kurds and turks ) , secular kemalists , nationalist kemalists and nationalists all hate each other . 
  i dont want to get hurt or land in jail . 
  fuck this country , i will be soon in the eu . 
  dont worry , im a good guy . 
  he was controlling these institutions before as well . 
  and he was an oppressive dictator already , i wonder what will happen now . 
  you wrongly call me an akp voter , this shows that you are not aware of the sociopolitic dynamics in turkey . 
  g\u00fclenists have caused a lot of suffering to the seculars/kemalists . 
  to infiltrate the state they had seculars imprisoned or driven away . 
  and they are one of the largest enemy of the kurds . 
  in cooperation with nationalists , nationalist kemalists and islamists they fought and murdered thousand of kurds . 
  in the cities where the kurds/pkk are dominant , the g\u00fclenists could not and have not founded any schools . 
  my country has been go\u0131ng to shit since many year . 
  i will be out soon . 
  are they g\u00fclenists for sure ? 
  i dont know . 
  but the same people who have been murdering the kurds in these last months are the people who organized ( or just executed ) the coup . 
  you know who came for the kemalists and the kurds ? 
  the g\u00fclenists , they ones who apparently organized the coup . 
  against kemalists : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ergenekon_trials one of the coup organizers was praised by a government mouthpiece just last week for his fight against kurds : https://twitter.com/erdalimrek/status/755037154372452353, 
  we dont know the perpetrators yet . 
  i dont know the guy , but he is secular antierdo\u011fan and probably not on the side of g\u00fclen . 
  i didnt remember his words . 
  he said `` yes , in a unitary state the presidential system can be applied ... there are many examples , like hitler 's germany in the past and many different countries '' . 
  he didnt say `` all i want is same powers as hitler '' , as the title says . 
  sorry i deleted mu reply because i had to go and wouldnt be able to keep answering . 
  there are the turks you talk about , which are roughly half of the population . 
  and then there is [ us ] ( https://www.google.com.tr/search?q=gezi+olaylar%c4%b1&amp;safe=off&amp;prmd=ivn&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch ) . 
  we did protest , and we were millions . 
  im not asking for a military intervention . 
  freezing the assets of [ corrupt members ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gezi_park_protests ) of the government responsible for so [ many deaths ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gezi_park_protests ) , freezing the eu accession process and declaring some people personae non gratae would be something . 
  these people have nothing to do with the coup nor were they blamed for it . 
  alevis are one of the perpetual victims and scapegoats for islamists . 
  whenever muslims feel strong enough they will attack them . 
  thats not what he said . 
  he said something like `` the [ parliamentary republic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/parliamentary_republic ) is not inherently good , look at hitler '' sorry for not looking up the source and translating , but it is a very old article and has been debunked before . 
  istanbul is not a secularist stronghold , \u0130zmir is . 
  most of these people were not part of the coup . 
  they will be accused of being members of the [ g\u00fclen movement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/g\u00fclen_movement ) , once erdo\u011fan 's closest ally but now designated as a terrorist organization by the turkish government . 
  we are concerned , but come on , saddam killed [ hundreds of thousands ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/al-anfal_campaign ) . 
  you will stop being a softy european . 
  islamic terrorism , coups , a national liberation struggle , jihadists , modern feminists , muslim greek and levantine architecture , leftist terrorism , ghettos , gypsy neighborhoods , strong police presence without rule of law ... all you need is to walk 30 minutes in istanbul . 
  ( this post sounded much better in my mind ), 
  his motives were quite obvious to us . 
  in his speeches he said that '' [ democracy is a tool ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdbaunq5b2w ) '' , that '' [ you can not be both secular and muslim ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjc-nuv4wrq ) '' and he was even [ imprisoned for citing an islamist poem ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/recep_tayyip_erdo\u011fan#imprisonment ) ( first two links in turkish , last one in english ) . 
  when did merkel say that ? 
  i fully agree with the rest of your post , but i need a source on this claim :  pursued / `` adviced '' by european institutions to antagonize akp, 
  kerry does not mention nato membership in his speech, 
  copying from another post : - 7.899 policemen ( 3.021 of them high ranking ) - 30 province governors - 92 vice province-governors - 41 district governors - 2.745 judges and attorneys ( out of 12.000 total ) sources : http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/icisleri-bakanliginda-buyuk-operasyon-8-bin-777-personel-gorevden-uzaklastirildi-40152472 http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/2-bin-745-hakim-ve-savci-icin-gozalti-karari-cikti-40149496 this is a huge purge . 
  i dont know if any state , even after a revolution , has purged 1/4th of its judges . 
  im afraid , especially after seeing people likea [ him ] ( https://mobile.twitter.com/140journos/status/754273795964334080 ) roaming the streets , and [ islamists attacking alevi neighborhoods ] ( https://mobile.twitter.com/mynet/status/754405637262487552 ) . 
  the west didnt react when thousand of kurds were killed and their cities razed to the ground in the last few months . 
  the west wont react now .

  - the army is generally secular . 
  - before the coup i thought that the army was neutered . 
  i dont know any more . 
  - we dont know yet if the coup was organized by seculars or [ by a religious sect ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/g\u00fclen_movement ) - the secular citizens are people like you .
