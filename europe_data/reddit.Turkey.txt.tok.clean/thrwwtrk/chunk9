  they dont care to take up guns , organize to fight , risk their lives etc , like most europeans . 
  - the secular camp is divided : kemalists , leftists ( kurds and turks ) and very few nationalists . 
  the kemalists are divided further among nationalist kemalists and socialdemocrat kemalists . 
  nationalists and nationalist kemalists would never fight hand in hand with leftists . 
  the \u0130slamists are always sunni , but the seculars are both sunni and alevi . 
  you are correct . 
  i just checked , it is alevi in english and alevite in some languages such as german . 
  alevi/alevite and alawite are two different things . 
  who against whom ? 
  no , this is a real video, 
  a branch of \u0130slam . 
  the majority of turks are sunni muslims , around 10 % are alevi muslims https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alevism the alevisare very secular and are often the target by sunnis . 
  \u0130n 1993 [ 35 alevi intellectuals were burned alive ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sivas_massacre ) and nobody was punished . 
  [ these jihadists ] ( https://twitter.com/140journos/status/754466413935407106 ) are roaming the streets of istanbul hunting for `` secularists '' . 
  the situation in the most prominent alevi neighborhood can be seen in the video in my previous message . 
  edit : changed the last link to a respected source ( same video ), 
  they are already attacking alevi ~ ~ te ~ ~ neighborhoods in istanbul , helped by the police . 
  background : these two papers belong to the [ g\u00fclen movement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/g\u00fclen_movement ) ( a sect ) . 
  they were the closest allies with erdo\u011fan , but they became enemies since 2013 . 
  he does in his full interview https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yqzmw5lynki, 
  7 604 judges but the 2 745 figure includes public attorneys total number of judges and attorneys 12 047 .

  i dont know.\u00f6the situation is very unclear generally . 
  its not totally over yet, 
  it smost probably them, 
  yes, 
  thats him, 
  yes, 
  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rvqtlliyzss watch after 1:10, 
  we dont know yet . 
  the government says it is g\u00fcllenists ( a religious sect , it is difficult to describe them , sorry adrenaline too high ), 
  it is a coup attempt . 
  the prime minister said so . 
  the armed forced have announced that they `` have taken over the administration of the country in its entirety '' . 
  they have also taken ocer trt , the public tv . 
  prime minister confirmed it too , 3 minutes ago, 
  no , officer says : `` this is not a drill , everybody go home '', 
  no , soldier says `` this is not a drill , everybody go home '' nothing about a coup, 
  t24 is reliable , chuvashia, 
  t24 is reliable , but some people living in the area have denied this, 
  newspaper close to the government ( but unreliable ) : coup attempt http://www.yenisafak.com/gundem/paralel-subaylardan-ihanet-girisimi-2494677, 
  why is this coming up now again ? 
  i dont understand the timing . 
  issues related to armenia are all over the turkish media these days . 
  what does ` colorito ' mean ? 
  and what does an * ir * regolare fronte look like ? 
  99 % of the citizens dont know how public debt works . 
  do nuns cover their face ? 
  ive only seen nuns in films and i remember their face uncovered, 
  we have a quran belt !, 
  places in green are the quran belt ( except maybe the northwest ) http://secim.haberler.com/2010/, 
  that would be the g\u00f6kkafes scandal in turkey, 
  english wikipedia article : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/istanbul_sapphire, 
  they abuse it too often then . 
  you live in the us and you probably dont follow but many prominent turks were convicted based on that law , including mentioning the genocide . 
  many people were convicted for funny , trivial stuff : a famous artist was singing live in a tv show . 
  while walking on the stage , a baloon with the turkish flag on it was in front of her and she kicked it out of her way . 
  both she and the producer company were fined for offending the flag and the turkishness . 
  it was illegal until recently, 
  we have two i 's . 
  i / \u0131 and \u0130 / i. 
  dotless i is pronounced like i in pill or pencil . 
  sound : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toz0cwkrtxi 1:45, 
  it is , but people are still complaining . 
  this tweet is being shared among \u0130slamonationalists . 
  https://twitter.com/19sow/status/748272167633231872 of course they dont mention that the government aligned media in turkey didnt put it in their first page : https://np.reddit.com/r/turkey/comments/4qf172/saldiri_sonrasi_yandas_gazete_mansetleri/ \u0130slamonationalists and nationalists in turkey always feel that ` the west ' is against them . 
  there are conspiracy theories that the attack was organised by america/the eu . 
  turkish restored the relationship with israel two days ago . 
  i doubt isis has the ability to organize such an attack in less that 24 hours . 
  most suicide bombers in turkey are turkish citizens of turkish or kurdish ethnicity . 
  racial profiling wouldnt help . 
  28 dead , 60 injured according to \u0130stanbul governor 3 suicide bombers https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/28/turkey-airport-explosions-ataturak-istanbul, 
   nationalism is cancer . 
  i agree . 
   speaking on the phone in croatian . 
  you mean serbian, 
  both me and you dislike him , but if it backfires on him it backfires on us . 
  i support both the \u0130sraeli and the russian reapprochement . 
  why are people sad or shocked that cameron resigned ? 
  link ? 
  before the vote erdo\u011fan said : `` im telling you now that the result will be ` remain ' . 
  and because the ` remain ' campaign said that turkey will not enter the eu , the europeans will tell us ` sorry turkey , you can not become a member ' . 
  the europeans will not keep their word . 
  that 's interesting . 
  we would call them green here . 
   i have grey eyes what ? 
  photo please ? 
  i wonder why ( \u00ac \u203f \u00ac ), 
  6000 dollars subsidy per aircraft http://www.haberturk.com/ekonomi/is-yasam/haber/1251668-turizme-900-milyon-tllik-destek, 
  of course it does . 
  it was ideologically motivated . 
  a neonazi attacking a cinema or a right-wing extremists attacking a random island makes , ideologically , no sense . 
  breivik attacked a youth camp of the labour party , not just some island with kids . 
  no , it 's a joke ( muslim name , famous nazi surname ) . 
  sorry for posting a joke to your fair question . 
  the turkish government lies often about these matters . 
  as an excuse to ban the may 1st demonstration in 2013 , they said `` because of the works in taksim , there are potholes which are dangerous '' . 
  the demostration happened anyway and lead to the gezi protests , when the police killed 15 people , if i remember correctly . 
  and they banned the pride parade last year too , without an isis plot . 
  they banned it last year too .
