aside from the replies you already got , the 1980 coup , which the us supported has got a lot to do with the current day politics of turkey . 
  no competent left wing , militant kurdish population and a conservative base that feels actively prosecuted . 
  [ `` danzig to germany ! '', 
  i guess ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5buh2u/the_coat_of_arms_of_the_serbian_town_kikinda_with/d9rdbts/ ), 
  you do realize that you are going to elect kanye right ? 
  if you do n't see what 's wrong with people cheering for beheadings in a current day context then i do n't know what to say to you . 
  maybe you would feel at home in raqqa . 
  erdo\u011fan is n't genocide level crazy and g\u00f6k\u00e7ek while crazy he is `` build transformer and dinosaur statues '' crazy . 
  it 's not like you guys do n't have your shitheads . 
  come on . 
  golden dawn goes toe to toe with our retards . 
  the guy is 38 years old btw . 
  this is n't about feet being dirty . 
  the slipper is the `` traditional weapon '' of the mother in turkey , do n't clean your room , get the slipper etc. 
  this case seems weird though since people tend to grow out of that when they stop being teens and a 38 son getting a slipper thrown at him and suing his mother i silly . 
  this , while makes me uneasy , is n't offensive . 
  [ this shit is though ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5buh2u/the_coat_of_arms_of_the_serbian_town_kikinda_with/d9rbuy5/ ) . 
  i wonder how many upvotes it has , since it 's not visible yet . 
  how welcoming . 
  then they would be underpaid and those people would look for other sources for funding . 
  and i have no doubt the deep pockets of the saudis would find a way , legal or not . 
  you can have government funding , but that may cause people to resent the mosques and look for alternative places and i do n't think i need to mention what that entails . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5bs8uq/a_woman_calling_for_jihad_was_invited_on_a_german/d9r42bc/ would you rather the house of saud pick up the tab ? 
   over two months , a dozen syrians in six places of worship in three cities told reuters they were uncomfortable with very conservative messages in ** arabic-speaking ** mosques . 
   `` unfortunately it is true that a large majority of arabic-speaking mosques are more conservative than turkish mosques , '' said professor mouhannad khorchide , who heads the centre for islamic theology at muenster university . 
  that poses problems for integrating those who are less conservative . 
   `` one time when i was there , a salafist asked a young arab man to leave because he was wearing shorts , '' he added . 
  `` at the turkish mosque no one cares what you 're wearing . '', 
   even though salam ca n't understand the sermons in turkish , he said he has started going to a turkish mosque instead . 
  why even comment without reading the freaking article ? 
  what problems do you guys have ? 
  i am familiar with how it works . 
  i just failed the syntax for the joking smile . 
  coming from a big city where you can even get 24/7 home delivery for free , everything being closed on sundays suck . 
  where do you get the ice-cream when the ice-cream store is closed :\\ ^ ), 
  i did not realize france was n't in europe . 
  can swedes here answer ; did they go to a `` shallow water '' ethnic neighbourhood or is tensta somewhere you would actually avoid going to ? 
  i had to expose myself to / r/worldnews for this , you owe me braincells . 
  [ you have people comparing them to fucking nelson mandela ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/5b07cn/leaders_of_prokurdish_political_party_arrested_in/d9lbv5c/ ) there are people who read a few articles and declare themselves experts on subjects . 
  if the ruling part is already determined , what is the point of holding elections ? 
  `` k\u00f6y enstit\u00fcleri '' seems like mostly a meme like `` bor production '' to me . 
  how does that logic even work ? 
  no turks , phew . 
  as much as you looked at turkish history . 
  they were trying to look like a progressive party to the turkish voter base . 
  more lgbt rights ( which they never mention to their eastern voters since they would lose votes ) and less religious influence in the government . 
  chp is similar in these things ( they are a bit more centre-left ) but the region i live always votes chp so it would n't matter much and i did not want hdp to get caught on the voting threshold ( and still do n't to a degree ) since that would give the current government too much power . 
  i also thought that peace process could work . 
  everyone knew their pkk connections but you can not negotiate peace without sitting down with the enemy . 
  but i never thought they would be as disgusting as to the things i 've mentioned in the previous post and more . 
  i would prefer if a party i considered voting for did not use government vehicles that my taxes pay for to transfer weapons for terrorists or not to attend wakes of suicide bombers who blow themselves up next to metro exits ( especially when the specific exit is the one that i intend to get off at ) . 
  also after the election they stopped trying to appease turkish voters and went full kurdish nationalist . 
  i was considering voting for them and am very glad that i did not . 
  maybe their strongly worded letters can clog the national mail system . 
  it 's so funny that the excuses you are using are the exact same ones as the turkish governments . 
  read the article . 
  at most 100 incidental casualties with 200.000 temporarily displaced . 
  if `` erdo\u011fan intended to eliminate kurds in turkey '' , i think an army with tanks and bombers would have scarier numbers . 
  wikipedia is quite accurate when it comes to scientific information . 
  however when it comes to social phenomena or things of similar nature the format has problems . 
  look at the method of study in the article you linked . 
  they compared articles on the same topics on both platforms . 
  britannica has a larger focus on science and i do n't doubt wikipedias accuracy when it comes to that . 
  when it comes to social issues there is no clear paper or data you can point to and say : `` this is the truth . '', 
  also : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/criticism_of_wikipedia#exposure_to_political_operatives_and_advocates, 
  because i think the difference between intentionally targeting civilians and incidental deaths are quite clear and would n't need this much explaining . 
  i am quite displeased with our president and hate it the most when ignorant westerners make me defend him when they spread misinformation . 
  i do n't think an article with the title `` does erdogan intend to eliminate the kurds in turkey ? '', 
  is an objective one . 
  civilians dying and being specifically targeted are different things . 
  i feel like you are playing dumb to get a rise out of turks . 
  i should n't have to explain why wikipedia is a bad source for anything not purely scientific . 
  i can edit it right now to say that the whole conflict is caused by time-travelling roman legionnaires . 
  also if you check the sources for that page there are many publications from daily beast , breitbart to daily sabah and anadolu ajans , which are not known to be objective . 
  are you actually using wikipedia as a source ? 
  can your state please raise me aswell . 
  i can email you my paypal, 
  3/15 better than expected . 
  you are correct about the indians or any group that the us integrates . 
  i should have said too large a group too quickly . 
  of course some cultural values may be affecting these things but i do believe majority of the problems stem from a big change to the status-quo ( a large influx of outsiders ) becoming a problematic status-quo . 
  there are a lot more turks than italians and greeks . 
  while i do believe a large of the problems stems from turks isolating themselves to a degree ( starting from language ) the other groups can not afford to isolate . 
  the uk just voted to leave the friggin eu in large part because of polish immigration even though they are european catholic . 
  notice how the correctness decreases as you move away from east mediterranean . 
  i think the south georgia island is there . 
  you ca n't theorize that . 
  the hat makes the look, 
  they did not take in refugees , they were the part of the same country . 
  officially what ottoman empire wanted to do was move the armenians in eastern provinces who were revolting and collaborating with the russians - whom they were at war with - to syrian provinces where they had better control . 
  depending on who you listen to , this was either a cover up to genocide armenians or the ottomans were ill equipped to attempt a population transfer of this scale and fucked everything up . 
  people here get triggered when someone with my flair talks about armenians and i 'm sure many will downvote after the first sentence but whatever . 
  there is n't a claim you can support without making extensive research on this topic . 
  on general i would think the ** average conservative ** in turkey is more progressive then the ** average ** syrian , but this has no basis other than my personal biases . 
  from what the germany redditors here wrote , the part being argued is `` rape '' . 
  he is convicted of sexual abuse of a minor but the rape charges are being appealed because he did not have the intent of raping the kid since his understanding of rape is different or something like that, 
   close to ten percent of the chain subway carry halal-only stores ( meaning no pork ) , in spite of the high costs from the loss of business of nonpork stores . 
  he mentioned % 10 of subways being totally halal ( no pork ) . 
  if i was someone who enjoyed pork i think it i am justified to be upset . 
  also if you think the article on the whole is about dietary practices , i would suggest lighter reading material .
