  i do n't care if the terrorists win if them losing involves my death or the risk of it . 
  can i please join the circlejerk ? 
  you see that book being mentioned as the counterpart to 1984 but i found that it is n't even a bad life if you replace making a part of the populace intentionally retarded with automation ( which i think the author did n't predict ) . 
  even when you are exceptional you get to go to a smart person paradise where you get to do whatever you want . 
  it 's the most standard cake you can buy . 
  pleasantly bland sugary cakes . 
  chocolate topkek or bust . 
  i 've read the article mentioned in [ this post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5kqvgk/seljuk_sultans_tomb_project_stopped_after_german/dbq2mmg/ ) by / u/turqua and i can confirm it is pretty much the translation of the sabah article and h\u00fcrriyet is a newspaper i somewhat trust . 
  what ritual ? 
  [ reminds me this ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/children's_crusade ), 
  did this subreddit turn into / r/bashamerica ? 
  it 's like calling la marseillaise the french anthem, 
  it 's like calling \u0130stiklal mar\u015f\u0131 the turkish anthem , both are fine . 
  i do n't know , i was n't previously affected because of my vpn , now it 's a pain in the ass until i implement other solutions . 
  really annoyed though . 
  the problem is n't not being able to access it . 
  anyone with a bit of network knowledge can bypass the blocks . 
  my problem is that now i wo n't be able to get the full value i paid for because my government is retarded . 
  the magnitude of waste is n't an excuse for waste itself . 
  my fucking vpn is down , motherfucker , i am so angry . 
  it can get to -40 c as well in certain places . 
  you can use mathematics to see if something can work before wasting millions on it . 
  try 40 c, 
  you can replace lesser people below betas with automation and there is not much difference . 
  i was a fucking tree . 
  just stood there . 
  the guy who raped a kid in a pool in germany or austria . 
  he said he had a sexual emergency . 
  ( probably what his lawyer told him to say ), 
  anyone who knows how to use tor can get around the tor block . 
  it 's probably done by some pencil pusher who is following the orders of some higher up who does n't know how the internet works, 
  well since most north koreans are quite short due to starvation he is probably a giant to them . 
  for fucks sake please just end . 
  edit : now i remember the thread about the kid who tried to bomb a christmas market . 
  a few germans were talking about feeling safe in their christmasmarkets . 
  makes me even sadder . 
  if you are getting paid a dutch salary in portugal , you are living the dream man . 
  [ i love this one ] ( http://sputnikipogrom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/car-15.jpg ), 
   you only get visa free access for 90 in 180 days . 
  since you could already walk up to the border anyways to claim refugee status i doubt this is going to change anything . 
  the situation in the eyes of the average european and facts are n't always the same . 
  within this context , is there anything wrong with my statement ? 
   you only get visa free access for 90 in 180 days . 
  since you could already walk up to the border anyways to claim refugee status i doubt this is going to change anything . 
  it 's the same for turkey and ukraine is actually poorer than us . 
  `` for some reason '' threads about turkish visa access was n't similar to this one . 
  the rich ones are . 
  the average gopnik is n't too different from my retarded countrymen . 
  they can do that because their word has no weight . 
  there is a difference between a person representing non-existent national entity saying something and a nation saying something about genocide and the ramifications of it . 
  i bet my left testicle if their kurdistan was established , they would be the biggest deniers . 
  in some real estate yes . 
  never heard of non-luxury cars being dealt in $ . 
  but yea most things are all done in . 
  there are some news of people giving free services to people who sell a certain amount of dollars but those are mostly nutters . 
  [ it 's not very successful as you can see . 
  ] ( http://www.xe.com/en/currencycharts/?from=usd&amp;to=try&amp;view=1w ) the big spike last week is when he got on tv and started talking . 
  you can track his speech on the foreign currency graph . 
  g20 is not a `` countries we like club '' . 
  their political stances ( while possibly having some relevancy ) is n't important . 
  the mentioned countries have perfectly valid reasons to be there . 
  also turkey is not an arabic county . 
  while that may be weird , shitting on other members who have legit reasons to be there sounds a bit butthurt . 
  turkey is still in the top 20 despite governments retarded comments tanking our currency . 
  and like it or not saudi arabia has an important place in the world economy considering their ability to adjust world energy prices . 
  turkey fought and won a war for lausanne . 
  i think `` smells indian '' means that it smells like shit . 
  where can a foreigner watch it ? 
  preferably with english subtitles . 
  first of all ; for people to understand you , you need to form coherent sentences . 
  secondly most kurdish people in turkey are sunni muslims . 
  you can not differentiate people the way you did in your post . 
  thirdly assuming you mean to say that kurdish women are more progressive , [ that is flat out wrong .

  most young people tend to go for a hug and slowly but heads . 
  not girls though . 
  because we have reasons that are not bullshit to hate the government but when people make stuff up it gets annoying . 
  i was n't referring to you . 
  there is a reddit setting that puts a little cross next to the karma number if the post is controversial . 
  when i made the previous post the op was controversial . 
  i was hoping the `` meme arrow '' made it clear that it was a joke but the post is controversial . 
  i wonder what that tells about this sub . 
  \\  implying italians can actually make good coffee . 
  it 's almost like he is trying to start a reddit circlejerk . 
  are you a greek cypriot or a turkish cypriot ? 
  most cypriots tend to be against turkey 's guarantor status . 
  what do you think about it ? 
  should greece have a guarantor status ? 
  i am going to presume you are against guarantor status and ask this : would n't a lot more turks die without the previous guarantor status ? 
  does n't that justify the guarantor status ? 
  i think he means georgia . 
  a state in active conflict is n't the best partner in a union . 
  especially when the other side is an important `` contact '', 
  iceland might not give a shit about turkey but you do n't get your news about turkey from icelandic sources . 
  and the media you consume does actually give a shit about turkey . 
  when the western news source says that he is closing down independent media , government mouthpieces here say that he is fighting against the terrorists who want to damage turkey . 
  you have no easy access to those news and people here do n't have easy access to your news . 
  it was always the same . 
  back in 07 or so western media was talking about how erdo\u011fan was a moderate and good for the region . 
  while cumhuriyet was talking about his authoritarian tendencies .
