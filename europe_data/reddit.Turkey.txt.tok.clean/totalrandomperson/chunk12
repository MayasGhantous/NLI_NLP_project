  the fact that only a one digit percent of people you give temporary refuge to will actually temporarily stay ? 
  4.4 % groundbreaking numbers . 
  when they do , they get sued by echr . 
  the only reason migrants are willing to come is that northerners are willing to give people ; multiple times the wages they would earn in their home countries , just for existing . 
  jus sanguinis is a thing you know, 
  austria was neutral during the cold war . 
  there will always be a population relatively stupider than another part . 
  thank you for this valuable comment . 
  really has been a great addition to the thread . 
  tansu \u00c7iller was n't elected but appointed like theresa may . 
  just him meeting some city mascots, 
  [ akp does love its mascots ] ( https://youtu.be/g2cjf--4vto?t=2m4s ), 
  oh yes . 
  there is an amazing one with him , merkel and a crocodile puppet . 
  can you elaborate on that ? 
  is n't turkey the one with the milder climate ? 
  you can take our authoritarians but you ca n't take our beaches . 
  spelling being retarded does n't make pronunciation complex . 
  there are no throat syllables , tonal changes , rolling `` r `` s , clicks or pretty much any sound that someone unfamiliar with the language would n't be able to produce . 
  i think this an extremely western perspective . 
  i would 've though more people would have frogs than snails . 
  it seems like the less disgusting option . 
  there are black humor and racist assholes . 
  you are being a stuck up asshole . 
  savage, 
  it 's almost like the value of a million $ is decreasing every year . 
  where is the copy pasta ? 
  they indeed should n't . 
  you guys seem to be pretty smart when choosing where to emigrate . 
  rather than crummy germland you go to the rich neighbors . 
  [ it 's not a rumor ] ( http://knowledgenuts.com/2014/08/21/mussolini-tried-to-abolish-pasta/ ), 
  i actually did that while speaking to americans and was very confused when they did not understand . 
  it 's still that way in iceland and some other countries . 
  why do you make stuff up ? 
  gezi was weeks long and i do n't think any cars were torched . 
  compared to antifa retards , gezi had a reason to protest . 
  i 'm just waiting for the fault to end up on us . 
  although this is more on the austrians, 
  that is even stupider, 
  scandi banter is actually worst because none of them actually hate each other , it 's not genuine . 
  balkan bantz for example are a lot more fun to watch . 
  they are sometimes super serious and there is at least 1 serb who fought in wars . 
  please post a link after a while so we can see the reactions . 
  this is n't a spoken debate . 
  anyone can take as much time as they want to write a response, 
  also i remember reading that the grey wolves were hired to do someone elses dirty work . 
  it was n't ideological, 
  regardless of my opinions on them , political demonstrations are in no way similar to terrorist attacks, 
  `` modest '' that 's colorful wording . 
  the joke is based on an earlier movie , [ midnight express ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077928/ ) which is a dishonest telling of the story of billy hayes , a guy who gets sentenced to prison in turkey for smuggling hash . 
  deportation process should not be relevant to their respect of the law . 
  they de facto are, 
  b\u00fclent ersoy is a national treasure !, 
  i know that you are memeing but `` midnight express '' is literal propaganda . 
  [ here is what the real billy hayes has to say about the movie ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phjlmngkedu ) [ part 2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jtrs8e-frk ), 
  `` katil '' means murderer in turkish , but it does n't fit in turkish vowel harmony rules , i think it might be of arabic origin . 
  wait , that 's real ? 
  i thought it was just satire . 
  most black slaves in the ottoman empire were n't eunuchs , the castration process would n't make it feasible and eunuchs make worse slaves since they lack the strength and endurance that comes with testosterone . 
  only the royal court and rich households had eunuchs , other slaves were just normal . 
  turkey is more like mexico and other south american countries with high rates of mixing rather than other colonial powers . 
  you do n't hear mestizos asking for reparations from spain now , do you ? 
  people here are mixed enough that there is no clear divide between oppressor and the oppressed . 
  ( like one group having a certain skin and hair color ) . 
  k\u0131van\u00e7 tatl\u0131tu\u011f is as turkish as rafet el roman . 
  discrimination here is usually religious . 
  there is of course the kurdish issue , but i ca n't get into that now . 
  also , on another note : black eunuchs were n't all that common . 
  i do n't know about castration process nowadays but back in the day , it was brutal . 
  it had a % 50 mortality rate . 
  only the royal court and rich households had eunuchs . 
  i do n't know what percentage of slaves imported were white or black but the common slave that worked in the fields or galleys was n't castrated , it would n't make sense to have eunuch workers anyways , without testosterone , they would be a lot weaker and a lot less productive . 
  how else are we supposed to eat dinner ? 
  you hit all the boogeyman checkmarks . 
  [ my other post to you addresses this .

  [ you are n't doing a good job of deporting them ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/half-of-rejected-asylum-seekers-stay-in-germany-asylum-refugee/ ), 
  it 's not like those people want to stay in greece or italy , you should know where they try to go . 
   [ the first gastarbeiter were recruited from european nations . 
  however turkey pressured the federal republic to allow its citizens to become guest workers . 
  [ 1 ] theodor blank , secretary of state for employment , was opposed to such agreements . 
  he held the opinion that the cultural gap between germany and turkey would be too large and also held the opinion that germany needed no more labourers because there were enough unemployed people living in the poorer regions of germany who could fill these vacancies . 
  the united states , however , put some political pressure on germany , wanting to stabilize and create goodwill from a potential ally . 
  the german department of foreign affairs carried on the negotiations after this , and in 1961 an agreement was reached . 
  [ 6 ] [ 6 ]  after 1961 turkish citizens ( largely from rural areas ) soon became the largest group of gastarbeiter in west germany . 
  the perception at the time on the part of both the west german government and the turkish republic representatives was that working in germany would be only `` temporary . '', 
  the migrants , mostly male , were allowed to work in germany for a period of one or two years before returning to their home country in order to make room for other migrants . 
  some [ quantify ] migrants did return , after having built up savings for their return . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gastarbeiter ) turkey was kinda new in the nato club , us was establishing bases and nukes in these bases , we also fought in the korean war . 
  sending some of your poorest away and having them send back valuable foreign currency is a pretty beneficial . 
  this is not to say germany were losers in this exchange , having abundant cheap labor certainly helped them economically . 
  but there are some social problems nowadays of course . 
  more and more people will come and be stuck in greece and italy as long as you keep the intecetives for coming alive . 
  hartz iv gets you 400 $ just for having the ability to say the word `` sozialhilfe '' . 
  that 's higher than turkish minimum wage . 
  it makes you rich in bumfuck-shiteria in wherever these people come from . 
  you have to make it not worth it for these people for them to not come . 
  [ you need stuff like this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8stq5qk.jpg ) . 
  not to make more space in eastern europe for more to come . 
  frontex is a ferry service off the coast of libya and the turkish deal blocks nothing , for every person from greek camps sent to turkey , turkey sends a syrian refugee to be settled in europe .
