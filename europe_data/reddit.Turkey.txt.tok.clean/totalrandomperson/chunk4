  do n't think it would happen . 
  we still have erasmus and we are n't even in the eu, 
  g\u00fclenists are taking advantage of the us charter school system and opening many schools in the us . 
  i think they currently have more then 130 schools . 
  they have wage kickback schemes , discrimination issues , abuse of hb-1 visas and other issues . 
  they are also pushing turkish culture to the students ( mandatory turkish lessons ) and are giving goverment officals all expenses paid trips to turkey . 
  i get that a turkish islamic organization infiltrating and placing their own men in positions of power in foreign countries is absurd . 
  but sometimes realty is stranger that fiction and it is happening . 
  i know firsthand that it is happening in turkey . 
  there are american sources totally unrelated to turkey that say it is happening . 
  you can check their involment in ex-soviet republics with a simple google search . 
  i may not be a big fan of our president but i am not going to stop drinking water because he drinks water aswell . 
  honestly if they are g\u00fclenist i would n't be very hopeful . 
  them infiltrating german institutions would n't end well . 
  [ they are already getting into american schools ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-dlooxbybk ) and have presence in ex-soviet republics . 
  i mean this is all my personal interpretation and comparing his previous rhetoric it seems to me that death penalty wo n't come . 
  he said he would approve the law if it came out of the parliament . 
  if he wanted the law he woulda just say `` it will happen '' . 
  he is just pleasing the plebes, 
  half the kurds vote for him . 
  i do n't think his voters are the ones he would like to hang . 
  death penalty is n't coming anyways . 
  i do n't think the bourbon royalty is the best example of the population . 
  after they conquered cairo they took the caliphate from the mamluks, 
  this was when i was very young . 
  i think i either gave them to my friends or to the teacher, 
  this was when i was very young .

  maybe espana can balkanize , or there is still britain to do some retarded shit . 
  french law limits more liberties . 
  changing the constitution is a lot harder . 
  g\u00fclen has earned enough `` bad '' to serve many lifetimes . 
  death penalty wo n't come , the goverment is not that stupid , they are just pleasing the plebes . 
  and erdo\u011fan said that `` he would apporove the law if it passed the parliment . '', 
  if he actually wanted the law he would say that it was coming . 
  not blame the parliment . 
  considering the massive amount of [ `` butthurt '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/s%c3%a8vres_syndrome ) ( ca n't think of another word ) that turkish people have over [ s\u00e8rves ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_s%c3%a8vres ) , any invasion or large interfearnce is possibly the worst thing you could do . 
  i ca n't even think of the results . 
  [ it never fails to make me laugh ] ( http://imgur.com/mk0odbl ), 
  stickers are cool but clothing is a big no no here . 
  back in school we would have trouble throwing away the mini paper flags we used for celebrations . 
  even the portuguese get it . 
  it could 've been multi level memes . 
  well pennsylvania has a special meaning in turkey . 
  g\u00fclen is in exile there and if someone mentions pennsylvania , it 's probably to touch on g\u00fclen . 
  is this supposed to be a very elaborate joke ? 
  i never would 've thought that we pay teachers more than poland or czechia . 
  is this an actual thing ? 
  because i repeat , times are currently good . 
  [ muslims do n't even make up % 2 and are tucked away in their own corner in thrace ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_greece#ethnic_groups.2c_languages_and_religion ) .

  with you on the other hand , the most prosperous region , the capital of you country is [ % 50 foreign ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnic_groups_in_london ) . 
  also , greece is n't as bad as it can get . 
  you are taking your current stability for granted .

  you ca n't guarantee times will always be good .

  government is fueling it 's fire to gain support . 
  i do n't deny there are problems . 
  i would actually prefer more people being aware of the problems . 
  what i do n't want is some idiot from a city where no dutch person probably set foot in before being used to say `` look how turkey is now . '', 
  some bumfuck owner of a bumfuck hotel in the middle of bumfuck nowhere does n't mean much . 
  people in this subreddit get mad at trumples when they come here saying `` germland is burning down , europe is ruined forever '' but this is the same thing . 
  kissinger is n't a neutral party when it comes to this analysis . 
  it 's within his interest to show that muslims have animosity against the west, 
  only thing i know is that i aim to buy an eu citizenship from them . 
  ( dream ), 
  gini is a measure of inequality , not the comparable wealth of the country . 
  something like gdp per capita is a better measure for a countrys wealth . 
  common saying is that : `` if you do n't live here , it 's a hilarious country . '', 
  at least we just jail them . 
  because the sun holds no apparent value . 
  the fact that it should be allowed does n't imply the fact that it should exist . 
  honestly you have the patience of a saint . 
  i do n't know how you suffered through that . 
  are you a historian ? 
  very old copypasta . 
  the complex set of beliefs stem from the statement : `` this book is the word of god , because his book says so . '', 
  if your foundation is based on shitty circular reasoning , it does n't matter how much complex thought you build on it . 
  when you visit turkey , there is a visa agreement between turkey and eu . 
  while you may not have filled any paperwork or something like that , your legal status is clear as someone who has previously defined rights ( right to travel etc. ), 
  and previously defined restrictions ( length of stay , right to work etc. ), 
  when you borderhop from syria to germany , there is nothing clear about anything . 
  judging from the downvoted comments in this thread , i do n't think they would be well received . 
  [ why are you so quick to disagree with facts ? 
  ] ( http://www.haberler.com/en-buyuk-kurt-partisi-ak-parti-mi-hdp-mi-7348006-haberi/ ) even if you do n't speak turkish , the graphs should n't be hard to understand . 
  i 'm sure at least some spaniards understand . 
  yet their maps do n't seem to be periodically posted here . 
  also , this list does n't include muslims ethnicly cleansed from the balkans . 
  i honestly hope he does something like that after the referendum . 
  it would be unbelievably hilarious . 
  [ if you look at y-haplogroups , turkey is as diverse as they come ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/genetic_studies_on_turkish_people ), 
  it 's not like how the votes are processed were announced after the vote . 
  everybody knew the game , everybody played by the same rules . 
  gdp growth is % 2.5 for last year . 
  ( estimated ) which is fucking abysmal compared to previous years . 
  also 12.7 unemployment . 
  highest in 7 years .
