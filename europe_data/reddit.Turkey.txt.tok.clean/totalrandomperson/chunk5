  turks in cyprus already speak turkish and i think greeks in cyprus would prefer to speak anything but turkish . 
  while muslim population rising in the europe is a thing , that tweet is retarded . 
  the rising `` poc '' population of the us is the mexican and other latino populations ( who are considered white by many people ) , not black or asian , let alone muslim .

  what if the 15.000.000 people living there do n't want to be christians ? 
  i honestly do n't think / u / _ hopped _ is n't fully joking . 
  what if they refused ? 
  every time this is posted , i ask ; what will you do with the 15 million people living there ? 
  i can not think of any other reasons . 
  only `` alamanc\u0131 's '' i 've interacted with were the german teachers i 've had and i think they diverge from the norm just by graduating from university . 
  first of all , this is about turks who live in europe but still support erdo\u011fan . 
  their situation is different that turks in turkey . 
  for your post ( and turks in turkey , if i understood you correctly ) , of course this is n't the whole thing . 
  economy argument , persucution argument and all others are all part of a huge number of reasons . 
  there are real islamists in turkey who ** do ** want to see women in garbage bags and all that shit . 
  there are akp voters who do n't buy into government bullshit , with their own reasons for voting akp . 
  but in my opinion ( maybe i have too much faith in people ) i think their early economic success is the biggest part of their political success . 
  got ta admit , i think it 's a funny joke . 
  maybe meral ak\u015fener as president ? 
  conservative enough for some akp voters , previously mhp and chp has no one else . 
  they probably choose it because of both it 's meanings . 
  it 's pretty hard to find something in dutch meaning something else in turkish . 
  also i realize i am being harsh when i say  when you make blanket statements to circlejerk about how shit turkey is . 
  everyone does this . 
  / r/turkey is practically a circlejerk subreddit . 
  it 's just , everyone should be a bit better , everyday . 
   when they come back to visit their backwater villiges , they too notice differences . 
  after listening to their grandparents about how there was no electricity back then , they see people with iphones and mobile internet . 
   it 's especially worse with them because they do n't notice the petrol they pay 5tl is actually more expensive than in germany where the purchasing power is 4 times higher . 
  well since s\u00f6zc\u00fc is the kemalist paper , they are also nationalists . 
  do n't get it wrong , they are still very biased . 
  just very biased against the government . 
  [ here is todays headline ] ( http://www.gazeteoku.com/gazete-mansetleri/2017-03-14/sozcu-gazetesi.html ) * thank you to germany and the netherlands , they increased `` yes '' vote by % 2 * [ here is english sabah ] ( https://www.dailysabah.com/diplomacy/2017/03/14/shadow-of-srebrenica-still-hovers-over-the-netherlands-erdogan-says ) have n't read the whole thing , or the turkish page but in general they are more or less the same . 
  [ here is last weeks sales figures for newspapers .

  what it is not however , a government mouthpiece . 
  * sabah is turkish sputnik . 
  pure propaganda , half-truths and bullshit . 
  * s\u00f6zc\u00fc is the kemalist newspaper . 
  [ to show how independent they are , here is their list for `` yes '' and `` no '' voters . 
  ] ( http://www.gazeteoku.com/gazete-mansetleri/2017-03-06/sozcu-gazetesi.html ) `` yes '' list includes : * `` the advisor who kicks miners '' * `` the boss who swears at peoples mothers '' * `` undeservingly appointed bureaucrats . '', 
  you get the idea . 
  * posta is pure tabloid bullshit . 
  i do n't know how much they mention politics . 
  the reason i 've spent this much time writing this is n't to show `` how free turkey is . '', 
  there are clear problems . 
  some of which i 'm pretty sure you are aware of , some you probably do n't know . 
  the reason i wrote all this is because when you make blanket statements to circlejerk about how shit turkey is , you strenghten the authoritarian hand . 
  ** `` oh the europeans say we have no freedom of speech or free press but s\u00f6zc\u00fc still prints , therefore ; they must be wrong . 
   http://www.sozcu.com.tr/  http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/  http://t24.com.tr/  http://www.diken.com.tr/  sprouting factually inaccurate bullshit only plays to their hand . 
  they get to say `` look the west keeps exaggerating everything , there is nothing wrong . '', 
  ** i literally posted 4 of them in the original post . 
  there are 50 other islamic authocrat wannabes in his party , yet luck of the draw , everyone seems to have settled on him . 
  or maybe it 's more complex than that . 
  i hate the fact that i have to declare this but : * the fact that i find the wordplay in their name cool does n't mean i support their politics . 
  i ca n't keep track of arrested journalists , i 'm sure there is a list somewhere . 
  cumhuriyet is still going though . 
  there is a reason why a single party does n't rule continuously in democracies . 
  they start to fuck up and lose support . 
  erdo\u011fan gained his current support because of large economic growth until 2008 and not getting fucked by '08 crash ( it 's debatable if he is actually responsible for the economic success or was just luck but i 'm neither qualified to talk about that nor have the time to discuss it . ), 
  what i hope is people start to see how things are going to shit with him .

  i 'm hopeful for the referendum . 
  if not , better tomorrows will come . 
  in the mean time , this does n't mean let him do whatever the fuck he wants . 
  everybody involved needs to be firm , but reasonable . 
  the opposition here and foreign countries . 
   the amount of media outlets who is not pro erdogan is very low compared to those wo are pro erdogan . 
  the media outlets who are against erdogan do n't exist anymore . 
  as someone who does n't speak turkish , follow turkish media or could n't list 5 turkish media outlets , how are you to make that judgement ? 
  it 's correct that akp propaganda outlets are * far far * more prevalent , but this is n't something i pull out of my ass . 
  i can check atv 's viewership or look at how do\u011fan media reacts to government pressure . 
  that does n't mean media against erdo\u011fan does n't exist anymore . 
  i can make this judgement because i can actually consume turkish media . 
  this is the nuance that gives the argument against erdo\u011fan validity . 
  when you say '' the media outlets who are against erdogan do n't exist anymore . '',
