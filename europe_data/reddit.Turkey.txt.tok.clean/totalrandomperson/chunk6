  , it does n't just annoy me by being factually inaccurate . 
  i repeat : * `` sprouting factually inaccurate bullshit only plays to their hand . 
  they get to say `` look the west keeps exaggerating everything , there is nothing wrong . 
   could make the exact argument in favor of trump 's election as you just did for erdogan , which is fitting because they are similar people . 
  except for the fact that a military coup did not depose every right wing government us had for the past 100 years . 
  if right wing people were n't shaped by such a system where they had feasable option of reperesentation , they would n't be fighting so hard right now . 
  their go to arguments are still `` muh t\u00fcrbanl\u0131 bac\u0131 '' , `` muh dey made mosques to stables '' . 
  the whole thing with netherlands is engineered to be victimized . 
   would you care to explain why an overwhelming majority of turks living in comfortable western society vote akp ? 
  because turks in the west are n't isolated from turkey . 
  when they come back to visit their backwater villiges , they too notice differences . 
  after listening to their grandparents about how there was no electricity back then , they see people with iphones and mobile internet . 
  it 's especially worse with them because they do n't notice the petrol they pay 5tl is actually more expensive than in germany where the purchasing power is 4 times higher . 
  what is this post supposed to mean ? 
  your translation seems more accurate . 
  http://www.sozcu.com.tr/ http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/ http://t24.com.tr/ http://www.diken.com.tr/ sprouting factually inaccurate bullshit only plays to their hand . 
  they get to say `` look the west keeps exaggerating everything , there is nothing wrong . '', 
  denk also translates to `` equal '' in turkish . 
  pretty cool party name . 
  you are clearly arthurian . 
  is there a better alternative though ? 
  in the end , an apartment has to be some kind of rectangular prism . 
  well , it 's also brand new ; it probably wo n't look that good in ten years . 
  could you please explain ? 
  it 's fucking hilarious that the most conservative part of turkey society is seen as liberals from outside . 
  is n't it a bit early ? 
  ( for to get a `` yes '' vote . ), 
  would n't waiting for the negative affects of brexit give `` yes '' a higher chance ? 
  that 's supposed to be the joke . 
  they beat up an uygur cook who worked in a chinese restaurant . 
  i mean we 've been here for almost a thousand years . 
  from your link * in statutory rape , overt force or threat is usually not present . 
  * statuary rape implies consensual sex with underage people . 
  turkey has n't been , and wo n't be invaded by asad . 
  do you think all the people at the pkk rallies are european nationals , lol ? 
  [ it was number 6 in most arrivals in 2015 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_tourism_rankings#most_visited_destinations_by_international_tourist_arrivals ), 
  belgium is a part of nato which does recognize pkk as a terror organisation . 
  i 'm pretty sure the pope has more than a billion . 
  you can have pro-akp rallies in turkey . 
  so lets go down a list : * pkk rally in turkey ** check ** * akp rally in turkey ** check ** * pkk rally in europe ** check ** * akp rally in europe ** welp ca n't have that ** it 's not like i like akp , but this is hypocrisy . 
  i linked the article for the pictures . 
  pkk flag , apo pictures , glorifying of terrorists on the side of the tent ; the whole package . 
  in the middle of brussels . 
  [ there is no shortage of examples ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5xl4qv/austrian_chancellor_calls_for_euwide_ban_on/dej9m4q/ ), 
  [ here is one from belgium , brussels ] ( http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/belcika-zirve-oncesi-teror-orgutu-pkkya-cadir-kurma-izni-verdi-40070905 ) there is no shortage of examples here . 
  if that 's free speech , so is erdo\u011fan spewing bullshit . 
  [ i think your facts are the alternative ones ] ( https://twitter.com/yunuspaksoy/status/838330340645171201 ), 
  calling someone whose ancestors lived there for 400 years an invader is retarded . 
  if we go back to invasions dating 400 years , there are a 100 other nations to be considered to have no right to their land before turkey . 
  live in the balkans for 600 years . 
  still foreign invader . 
  why ? 
  while turkey has compulsory voting , this is literally the first time it being mentioned i 've heard of it and it 's never enforced . 
  also the fine seems to be 10 euros for not voting even if it was ever enforced . 
  changing of language and how it 's used is a major theme in 1984 . 
  what you have is deliberate modification of language . 
  it 's a good place to use as an example . 
  also you should read 1984 . 
  are the news biased against magyars ? 
  your parents probably were n't even in germany when the wall went up . 
  even turkey has visa free travel to japan . 
  that 's amusing . 
  erdo\u011fan himself does n't go after random people . 
  it 's some random ass-kisser trying to get promoted by the other ass-kissers trying to show how good they are at kissing ass . 
  suprised to see do\u011fan expanded there . 
  they even kept the branding same . 
  how do you watch kanal d there ? 
  misery , with occasional spills of suicide ? 
  while it 's not as bad as mr. obama on my original post , mr. wilders here does n't seem to have a high opinion of his brother . 
  no , using someones relative is a retarded argument . 
  that 's the point . 
  [ here is obama 's brother wearing a maga hat ] ( http://16004-presscdn-0-50.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/malik-obama-maga-trump.jpg ) i guess trump was right . 
  they were already on top . 
  they stopped fucking other people , to prevent them from coming to the top . 
  still there needed to be fucking , there needed to be children and philip iv 's niece looked pretty hot . 
  did n't they fuck their way to the top , and stop fucking anyone else so nobody could join them ? 
  did n't they fuck their way to the top , and stop fucking anyone else so nobody could join them ? 
  fucking your way to the top , truly inspirational !, 
   when english claim they know how to drink tea . 
  a lebanese guy in video says it . 
  i was joking with `` implying '' and quoting . 
  i do n't know any octopus dishes beside kalamari . 
  lobsters or crabs do n't seem to be popular though . 
  i personally do n't like mussels . 
  it 's drunk food here . 
  people do eat a shitton of seafood though . 
   implying a civilized cusine could eat invertebrate, 
  [ \u0130stanbul for example is divided into 3 parts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_general_election,_november_2015#nationwide_results ) . 
  a certain percentage of people there vote for akp ; akp gets that percentage of seats assigned to that district . 
  `` refah partisi '' does n't really translate well to english . 
  it 's not the `` money from government '' welfare , but `` faring well '' . 
  [ this map is a better reperesentation ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/turkish_general_election%2c_november_2015_map.png ) these maps do n't really work for the turkish system . 
  for example ; even thought \u0130stanbul majorly voted akp , they only got 46 out of 88 seats in the parliment . 
  you may not have a crystal ball , but we have statistics . 
  i 'm sure if you look at university graduate iranian immigrants they would be at the level or lower than the average german when it comes to welfare or crime . 
  yet you are somehow surprised when you let thousands of people who did not finish primary school in , they commit crime . 
  i am not the spokesperson of turkey , my ideas are mine . 
  you ca n't ignore every post without a german flag . 
  or you could just not let people who are more likely to be problematic to come , then spend money on them , then try to `` integrate '' them . 
  your healthcare analogy would work if only people from mongolia would get sick .
