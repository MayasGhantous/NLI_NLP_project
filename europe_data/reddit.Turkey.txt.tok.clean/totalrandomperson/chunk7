  then yes ; germany would have zero healthcare costs . 
  immigrants are multiple times more likely to receive welfare or commit crime than natives . 
   if there were less migrants in sweden , there would be ** proportionately ** less crimes committed and ** proportionately ** welfare paid . 
  wow , this thinking thing is pretty fun . 
  [ swedenis the highest asylum giver per capita in the oecd ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2014/dec/02/sweden-oecds-highest-per-capita-asylum-seekers-syria ) despite being nowhere near a warzone . 
  the false equivalency is equating not being that and not having any immigration . 
   there are non-absurd positions to take like accepting skilled , educated immigrants . 
  [ also you can see that most foreigners ( aside from finns who came when they were occupied or eu citizens who are not the topic of discussion ) are people getting asylum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_to_sweden ) . 
  be it arabs , ethiopians and somalis coming now or ex-yu who arrived earlier . 
  [ 65 per cent of an age group that can operate only on reading comprehension level one by the pisa test ] ( https://www.welt.de/regionales/hamburg/article153237847/viele-fluechtlinge-im-grunde-analphabeten.html?wtrid=crossdevice.n24.desktop.artikel ) i am sure they can atleast read . 
  sweden halved international aid ; so your immigration policy does harm your foreign aid and humanitarian support . 
  also , you did n't address the second point . 
  first of all this is not correct . 
  [ you cut international aid in order to finance the migrants coming in ] ( http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2054&amp;artikel=6284322 ) second of all that does n't make sense anyways , sweden does n't have infinite money . 
  from a humanitarian perspective , every belly that gets filled in sweden leaves 49 people hungry in the third world . 
  for every person you look after in sweden , you could look after 50 in their original countries . 
  so if it 's for humanitarian reasons , you seem to be doing a very shitty job . 
  is there a difference in unemployment ratios between non-eu immigrants ? 
  if ex-yu or asian immigrants can figure out swedish bureaucracy , why ca n't africans and middle easterners ? 
  also , if it 's difficult to get jobs for people from war-torn or undeveloped countries , why let them in then ? 
  what i 'm trying to get at is that maybe the difference between the czech and swedish numbers are the result of different immigrant demographics rather than the `` czech ability to integrate '' . 
  and this is why you are not a fair comparison to sweden . 
  the number of uneducated east asian and ukrainian people in czechia is nowhere near the number of arabs and africans in sweden . 
  while i do n't know the exact answer of those questions , the resulting numbers are nowhere near uneducated immigrants sweden receives . 
  that 's why czechia is not a valid comparison . 
  i am not sure about it 's reasonableness , however it 's an example of the government censoring public institutions . 
  the situation in czechia is not comparable , czechia does n't receive any uneducated african or arab immigrants . 
  when they are put in eastern europe by refugee management agencies , they leave for sweden . 
  how many of your immigrants non-eu ? 
  how many non-skilled arab and african immigrants do you receive ? 
  does hungary have large immigrant communities ? 
  does hungary try to `` dispel myths of immigration '' ? 
  it seems to me like these stats would be quite useful to dispel these myths . 
  i agree with you , there is always going to be a lower class . 
  however it 's more nuanced than that . 
  the current lower class is `` lower '' than they would be if immigrants did not come and `` the class '' consisted of dutch people . 
  on welfare , immigrants do n't always pay more than they receive , that 's as silly as saying there would be no underclass without immigrants . 
  turks receive double the welfare native dutch do in the netherlands . 
  more than half of somalians are on welfare . 
  maybe the turks pay back what they take out , maybe they do n't . 
  you need numbers for that . 
  when have i said anything like that ? 
  i specifically wrote that accepting skilled immigrants could be good . 
  i do n't care about what you hear from other people . 
  at the end of the day , a group of people are more likely to commit crime and receive welfare . 
  it does matter if you want to discuss how to solve the problems with people who are already here . 
  ** it does n't matter one bit if you are discussing allowing more immigration of the same group . 
  so no counter argument ? 
  that 's a really cool false equilevancy you set up here . 
  there are non-absurd positions to take like accepting skilled , educated immigrants . 
  if you look at the top comment , we are talking about immigrants being more prevalent in crime statistics . 
  that 's a really cool false equilevancy you set up here .

  [ first thing to come to my mind ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/swedish-police-are-not-allowed-to-give-descriptions-of-alleged-criminals-so-as-not-to-sound-racist-a6810311.html ) i also remember reading that the government no longer collects racial data for crime and other statistics as well . 
  the reason for their crime and unemployment rate does not matter . 
  if there were less migrants in sweden , there would be less crimes committed and welfare paid . 
  the reason for their crime and unemployment rate does not matter . 
  if there were less migrants in sweden , there would be less crimes committed and welfare paid . 
  your society has nowhere near the numbers sweden has . 
  you ca n't compare them and say `` sweden 's worse at integrating . '', 
  if you look at older maps , they called it turkey back then as well . 
  `` ottoman empire '' is used to avoid confusion in a historic context just like when people refer to `` united states of america '' as `` the union '' when discussing the civil war . 
  no one is asking arab tourists in paris to not wear the veil . 
  the difference between visiting and settling down to raise children should be obvious . 
  it 's not actually seagull . 
  ( well , hopefully ) it 's a common joke that places with unreasonably cheap meat has some sorta secret like serving seagulls , donkeys or people even though those things would be probably more expensive . 
  at worst it 's rotten meat . 
  how do you think 2tl d\u00f6ners are made ? 
  seagulls , donkeys and cats all the way . 
  while effects of cats to local wildlife may be a concern to rural or suburban communities , i do n't think it 's much of an issue to somewhere as urban as \u0130stanbul or any other major turkish cities . 
  he is quite bothered by turkey as well . 
  not all of it . 
  mostly the first 20 . 
  none of group b. 
  if you want to an engineering faculty , you have to do some organic chemistry , naming stuff is easy but when it gets to reactions it becomes a bitch . 
  ask the non-arab muslims you have around you . 
  i would bet a testicle % 50 percent of them have n't read it . 
  actually having shops integrated with living space is a good thing , it encourages foot traffic and commerce , forms communities . 
  the architecture of buildings is very ugly though just ugly concrete prisms . 
  i know reading is hard but you do realize my post included russia and the us right ? 
  why should an agreement made in mind for the average naval borders should be relevant for the aegean sea where you can swim from one nation to another ? 
  when my government goes from shooting down a russian jet to being buttbuddies within a year , when us is both allied to us in nato while funding groups considered enemies to turkey ; how can you claim realpolitik is dead ? 
  that is how democracy works , i do n't think that should be such an alien concept . 
  people here seem to hold the idea that turkey has some kind of obligation to hold migrants back for them . 
  people who are n't turkish citizens , who have nothing to do with turkey are passing through to go to rich eu states . 
  it 's actually against turkish interest to hold these people here since it costs money to feed , clothe , house , etc. 
  these people . 
  when eu asks turkey to hold the migrants back , it 's somehow `` bullying , blackmail '' or some other bullshit when turkey asks for compensation . 
  i have no idea how these people think . 
  turkey does n't trust anybody . 
  people are still butthurt about sevres . 
  voting partei has no message other than `` i do n't like how things are going '' , which is pretty worthless . 
  voting afd sends the message `` i do n't want more foreigners '' pretty clearly . 
  le pen 's highest support is in calais , really makes you think . 
  ethiopia fought off italians . 
  europe came to where it currently is by arguing with religion . 
  european left does n't argue with immigrants ' religion because they do n't want to argue with immigrants . 
  when it 's a polandball comic or `` hurrrhussar remove kebab '' , i do n't really mind . 
  if it 's funny , i applaud it . 
  however when it 's referring to bosnia or the ethnic cleansing of turks from the balkans , it 's not ok .
