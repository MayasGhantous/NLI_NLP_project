  same thing with `` restoring constantinople to christendom . '', 
  i wonder what they intend to do with the 16 million people living there . 
  i do n't mind it when it 's used jokingly or in historical context like talking about 1683 or something like that . 
  the problem is that , i do n't think some people are actually joking . 
  only if you are gingers , world needs more of those . 
  no matter how symbolic it is , you still are n't an equal to anyone in the royal family . 
  a dispute you get into with them wo n't be judged equally , your life is worth less than theirs . 
  that is the simple fact of monarchy . 
  your head of state is literally appointed by god to look over you . 
  you are arguing with a turkish guy . 
  them trying to flatter iranians is n't the problem . 
  the problem is that they try to flatter the iraninans like this while proclaiming they are `` worlds first feminist government '' and bullshit like that . 
  either they are liars who use the `` feminist '' rhetoric as a tool or they are spineless hypocrites who fail to uphold the ideals they promote . 
  also , downvoted , not downloaded . 
  but i think that may be excused since it is currently 5 a.m. here . 
  turkish anthem references race ( the word used to mean something different back than ) and has a lot of references to religion ( it was written by an islamist ) which i 'm not keen about . 
  it still should n't be changed . 
  i must admit , i downloaded you without considering the thread we are in and i 'll correct my mistake but you realize my statement is factually correct right ? 
  did he want `` the spit special '' or something like that ? 
  your country disagrees . 
  the sad thing is , while a muslim might learn how to read arabic , they might not know how to actually speak arabic . 
  people go to kuran courses to learn to read the kuran . 
  so they learn the words , maybe they can say them out loud and they may even memorize many parts . 
  but a lot of them do n't know what any of them even means . 
  independence is not in any sort of discussion currently ( although i do n't doubt kurdish nationalists masturbate to maps of independent kurdistan ) . 
  what kurds currently try to achieve is more autonomy ( legitimacy of which depends on who you talk and how you think how life currently is like here ) * the problem with pkk is that they poisoned the well of discussion . 
  you can not discuss `` the kurdish issue '' without discussing pkk and their many crimes , which are to many people simply unforgivable . 
  * they poisoned the politics of the issue . 
  if you looked at turkish politics in recent years , you would see the rise of hdp . 
  they tried to not just be the kurdish party , but a progressive party for all of turkey . 
  many voters in the west did believe in them and a lot of turks did vote for them , even i considered to do so . 
  but many people accused the of being the political wing of pkk , that they could n't be trusted . 
  and in the end they were right . 
  they sheltered pkk terrorists , used their legal immunity as mp 's to protect illegal protests , used mp cars to transport weapons for pkk , during the unrest last year ; they used municipalities construction vehicles to dig trenches to be used against the military forces . 
  and now , like many times before turkey does n't have a legitimate voice for left wing kurds ( almost half of the kurdish population votes akp which the people you talked to most likely `` conveniently forgot to mention '' ) . 
  when legal immunity of the mp 's was lifted and many of them were arrested , part of the reason why there was n't much resistance from non-hdp people is that : they are actually somewhat guilty . 
  ( note that i use ** somewhat ** . 
  the government ** is ** to a degree unjustly persecuting them as i do n't think all of them were provably guilty of the things i mentioned above and the nationalists hate them no matter what ) . 
  you can argue they have been pushed to that position or whatever but the fact is that they went from a just position to an unjust one . 
  * they are poison to the region . 
  pkk fights real hard to keep the limited influance in the south east region . 
  they brutally destroy any alternative kurdish factions ( which is why `` tak '' being independent of them is probably bullshit ) . 
  they disrupt the attempts to better the region like attacking hydroelectric dam constructions , government vehicles , etc. 
  they actually attack schools , kill teachers in small villages ( who are often in the east because there is a mandatory service period for teachers to serve in crappy rural areas . ), 
  life in the south-east is shit , for a large part thanks to them . 
  i could probably write more but i feel this is enough of an explanation for now . 
  any turkish nationalist you rattle on reddit will give you links to everything i 've mentioned , and many more you did n't ask for . 
  generally the problem is that ; in any issue involving turkey , you do n't hear the turkish perspective , our media is n't active aboard , our diaspora isolative and our government unsympathetic . 
  combine that with large diasporas who want to push certain narratives and humanities tendency to form opinions on an issue based on the first things they hear and go from there , you have an easily constructed boogeyman . 
  first thing that came to my mind was ao shinrikyo . 
  glad it was n't something like that . 
  this picture is what misery looks like . 
  well disregard what i say then , i suck cocks . 
  wait you guys do n't like the first two parts ? 
  those are the best parts though . 
  blue eyes are from the descendants of european slaves and in later periods european muslims running from genocide . 
  the guys who did the invading did n't look too much different than kazakh people look today . 
  i am mostly talking about this subreddit . 
  [ look here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5t8cmw/tallest_and_widest_suspension_bridge_in_europe/ddkypkc/ ) . 
  what 's photographed is literally european soil but there is some butthurt greek dude bitching about the post . 
  it 's annoying to see a bunch of stupid posts at the bottom of every thread . 
  half the threads that mention turkey , there is at least one comment from some butthurt person saying `` turkey is n't europe , this should n't be here . '', 
  gets annoying quickly . 
  the problem is that the population sextupled . 
  voting against le pen can have multiple reasons , not just values . 
  being her stance on eu for example . 
  would ufc have regular fights ? 
  i too , would isolate myself ; if my predecessor was murdered for the exact same thing he is doing . 
  [ best version ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26b0nv5whky ), 
  i think he means parents driving people around . 
  in general we tend to have more melanin , no ? 
  of course sunlight is still dangerous to an extent , but we are better of than brittle northerners . 
  also i remember reading that fat cells in the body accumulate to the temperature to either preserve or disperse heat . 
  no matter how you look at it , our bodies are better equipped to deal with the heat and the sunlight . 
  iirc the french pushed as far north as diyarbak\u0131r and around that region . 
  you can check the treaty of sevres for the planned borders . 
  galipoli is the front they won . 
  if they won the mesopotamian front the turkish border would n't be this far north . 
  ottomans fought on 5 fronts , lost 4 of them . 
  this is what mustafa kemal said about the front they won : * i do n't order you to fight , i order you to die . 
  in the time it takes us to die , other troops and commanders can come and take our places . 
  west germany entered nato in '55 while the korean war `` ended '' in ' 53 . 
  i specifically checked the countries i mentioned so that some smartass could n't say `` but we had 5 soldiers there '', 
  how many dutchmen , how many portugese , how many italians fought in korea for their allies ? 
  for your information 15.000 turks did . 
  wait , fucking [ k\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck kurba\u011fa ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuhmp939ody ) is by beethoven ? 
  how ? 
  why ? 
  this changes everything !, 
  i think it 's called an open market . 
  do n't german cows say m\u00f6\u00f6 as well ? 
  i fully agree and [ thankfully the negotiations seem to be going well ] ( http://www.ntv.com.tr/dunya/mustafa-akinci-kibrista-son-safhaya-ulastik,tur-m6xu4uihw4rwdvhxfq ) ( sorry did n't look for a english link but it says that they have reached the last stage of the talks with guarantor nations . ), 
  but hopefully you understand the position of turkey and how the situation in the greek parliament and the rise of the right wing in europe might be affecting the island . 
  now , i certainly do n't think that the golden dawn will stage a surprise coup or greek cypriots would just start massacring turks again or anything but hopefully the other side can understand how saying `` just leave '' is unreasonable . 
  the '74 invasion of cyprus was the result of the greek dictatorships influence on the island . 
  what happens in greek parliament has affects outside greece . 
  i hate it when greeks talk about the ultra-nationalist turks , mhp and the evil grey wolves , but ignore the fact that % 7 of their parliament is literal nazis . 
  i know someone with my flair mentioning cyprus does n't go down well in this sub but i hate it when europeans say we should just get the fuck out of cyprus while there are ultra-nationalist in the greek parliament since the whole reason turkey invaded when it did is because greece under a nationalist dictatorship tried to push enosis to the island . 
  why ? 
  it was 4 years here back in '02,
