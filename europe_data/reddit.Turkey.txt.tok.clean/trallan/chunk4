  i had even no idea what was tip . 
  i knew it only from movies but i was n't thinking that it 's something regular . 
  i was poor but proud guy . 
  :d and my father was keep telling me `` you wo n't accept anything from people if it 's not a family member . 
  do n't do things which will embarrass you and our family '' hahah . 
  i bet you 'd guess what happened ... second day of my work someone came to cafe and tried to gave me some cash . 
  i thought it 's kinda insult . 
  i was like  :| however i just told him `` no , thanks '' . 
  he told me `` oh man , just take it '' . 
  told him `` i already gain enough money here . 
  he tried to put the cash in my apron 's pocket and this time i told him angrily `` i do n't want your money ! '', 
  and i moved away . 
  however he was insulted , i saw that in his face . 
  it has turned to red . 
  he went to near of boss and talked him about me . 
  my boss was an old and complaining man . 
  boss called me `` why did you reject the tip '' . 
  i told him `` i am not a beggar '' . 
  he thwapped me hard a few times first and then he told me how things work . 
  i use when someone gives a link from wikipedia or imgur . 
  ( somehow i just figured that several foreign websites has been blocked in turkey , when i started to check links on / r/europe yesterday . 
  even some news websites ) otherwise i do n't use . 
  i do n't know the reason but i do n't like vpns . 
  hehe . 
  i have just told this story yesterday here , will copy paste it . 
   i was town football team 's goalkeeper when i was 17 . 
  in a match , 5 gypsies ( opposite side 's supporters ) came back after goal/me and they threatened me several times with cutting my throat after match if i do n't concede goal . 
  i have conceded 7 goals in that match . 
  nothing happened in the end but i retired football . 
  hehe , yeah i know the song . 
  however istanbul 's name has still greek origin . 
  actually technically it 's greek . 
  georgia , greece , bulgaria , germany , switzerland , usa , azerbaijan , iran , holland, 
  \u0130zmir - [ \u0130zmir mar\u015f\u0131 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jxuidkbxg4 ) \u00c7anakkale - [ \u00c7anakkale t\u00fcrk\u00fcs\u00fc ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fksafa2dpa ) ankara - [ ankara ` n\u0131n ta\u015f\u0131na bak ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dban3lpcclg ), 
  yes . 
  especially it is about employment in turkey . 
  erdogan got support of many business men soon after he has elected as a prime minister and he had effort to influence social legislation . 
  they promise a good job for those who are supporting them and it is a charming bribe . 
  he also tends to assign his supporters to public establishments . 
  today when you check employees in public offices , almost they all are erdogan supporters . 
  especially this effects jurisdiction seriously . 
  in some locations i have noticed that they already know people who does n't support their party . 
  that was a bit scary . 
  i think they are making a huge intelligence work on people . 
  i think the way how you told his lack of language knowledge was not very kind . 
  you know ... 
  i know many scottish & english people who live in marmaris for years . 
  some of them are trying to talk us in turkish . 
  they are not really good with that . 
  however we never tell them `` work on turkish '' because it is not their mother language and i believe they do their best . 
  i would keep such favors for something else . 
  hehe . 
  yeah , it can be happen but i do n't scare . 
  we are barbarians but we do n't do that . 
  supporting erdogan . 
  i find it weird too though . 
  bulls which escapes in feast of sacrifice . 
  additionally i do n't think that it is important to find right side in these incidents . 
  `` you killed us and we killed you '' is the most stupid defence of the world i believe . 
  and i have n't even mentioned what you have done turks in independence war . 
  if we start to count incidents , it is highly like that we will fall asleep on our keyboards . 
  same for turks and greeks . 
  they were both responsible with massacres . 
  however you keep trying to seek out who is right all in these incidents . 
  this is the wrong thing you have done in this discussion . 
  you are blaming turks for behaviour of a family . 
  ottoman soldiers were n't even turks ( but i counted them as turk in stats . 
  only a few but long to tell but i can tell if you are interested ) nor ottoman governors were turk . 
  do you think that ottomans were really represents turks ? 
  they were even against nationalism and even turkish nationalism thoughts , that 's why greek rebellion and serbian rebellion started too late . 
  turks were only farmers and peasants in ottomans and when we build the modern turkey , all jewelers were jewish people or armenians . 
  traders as well with greeks . 
  there was only 1 turk in ankara who was trading and he was a partner of jewish . 
  you guys hate turks for what ? 
  for being a farmer ? 
  massacres has started with aegean massacres in march 1821 though . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/massacres_during_the_greek_war_of_independence#aegean_islands constantinople has started at april . 
  yeah , you did . 
  you have killed 15.000 civilian in the war that you have mentioned . 
  i am not counting 8000 turkish soldiers . 
  and one another : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/navarino_massacre#siege_of_the_city i can tell you many others ... 
  it is the proof that both sides violations : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/massacres_during_the_greek_war_of_independence so it was n't one sided , right ? 
  you guys are not an angel . 
   i am not surprised that you do n't know the massacres which you have done though . 
  hrm , one of my mates would get raped there , she saved herself with jumping down from balcony . 
  i thought it was one of rare incidents but it does n't seems like that . 
  well , you see ... 
  i did n't want to be one sided but he is ... 
  they have killed all turks and albanians in mora peninsula , crete , rhodos . 
  he does n't mention about that of course . 
  :d actually i went to greek islands multiple times and i have greek friends . 
  i have n't seen such hate speech from a greek before nor we have such problems . 
  there are a few racists/nationalists who are thinking like that though . 
  especially in crete . 
  it is the first time i heard that someone is calling counter forces as terrorist against revolt . 
  the guy blaze a trail in terror history . 
  hehehe . 
  if you ever plan to visit aegean side of turkey , you and your family are welcome to our home . 
   well my opinion about current situation in the region : i believe everyone should be aware of no religion does support terrorism on the world . 
  things like isis should not damage reputation of muslims or muslim countries .
