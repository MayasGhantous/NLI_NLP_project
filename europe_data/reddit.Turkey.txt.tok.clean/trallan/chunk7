  there was n't a palace of tayyip in that years and president house was just very close to guardhouse where i located . 
  a german tourist was taking pictures of whole military area . 
  i got a call from commander immediately . 
  ** c : commander ** ** m : me ** ** t : tourist ** c : did you see that person who is taking pictures of the location ? 
  m : where ? 
  excuse me , did n't see that sir . 
  c : why , son ? 
  are you blind ? 
  did we put you in guardhouse for standing like a statue ? 
  m : i am sorry , sir . 
  i will take care of it immediately . 
  t : hello !, 
  can i take a picture of you ? 
  m : ( was like wtf , he is foreigner ) no , no !, 
  stop !, 
  t : why ? 
  m : ( trying to be kind ) i am sorry but you can not take a picture of me or this area . 
  can you please hand me your photo machine please ? 
  i will delete all pictures of the regiment and will hand you back in a few minutes . 
  t : i do n't . 
  why would i do that ? 
  m : according to turkish laws , you can not take pictures of military areas . 
  can you please hand me it now ? 
  t : i do n't want to give it . 
  m : please ... 
  otherwise i will need to call police ... 
  this conversation went on about 15 minutes . 
  i can not recall all thing we talked . 
  ( commander came while i was trying to convince the guy and he asked me in turkish ) c : what 's happening ? 
  m : i asked him to give his machine several times nicely but he refused it . 
  he told me he is german . 
  c : ( to tourist ) give that fucking machine just now !!!, 
  t : why are you shouting ? 
  you did n't even ask that nicely !, 
  here it is . 
  m facepalms . 
  all of them have natural beauties , all of them are important historical countries , all of them have similar nightlife ( may be france can be better than other options ) , all of them have many local unique goods to taste . 
  if i were you i would take a look at tripadvisor and some guide websites ( there are also some wiki sites ) with your friends and decide about one of them . 
  agreed . 
  russia has sanctioned turkey for a few months and whole country 's economy went worse . 
  we could n't recover it yet . 
  i do n't think that putin is similar with leaders of ussr . 
  may be about 7 years ago but they have signed many gas/oil deals with asian countries like china , japan , etc. 
  i recommend you to check recent gas deals of russia in last 3 years . 
  some of these countries ( including turkey , china and india ) would like to improve these deals , however russians has refused it . 
  and russians scaled down current deals with some asian countries . 
  it means there is an alternative buyer for russian gas . 
  but there is not any alternative seller for europe . 
  have good memories with valbo in fm . 
  also vantaa from finland . 
  elder scroll games : morrowind , obvilion , skyrim and elder scrolls online . 
  yeah i even play old ones when i get bore . 
  i think i have completed morrowind 356774 times . 
  i also like sandbox and survival games . 
  natural gas and yes if russians do n't sell gas to europe , it will impact european countries . 
  gas is the strongest politic weapon of russia against europe ( i am not sure but i remember putin also threatened europe with that . 
  if i am wrong , please let me know ) at the moment and there is not any good alternative of russian gas .

  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmdgt8tcjrm are you sure about what you told ? 
  they have clearly told that they want autonomy and independence for years . 
  are you drunk ? 
  technically turkey and san marino are still at war formally . 
  however both side are not aware of that . 
  it could be interesting if one them propose it for the war . 
  the matter is the question about `` distrust/dislike between ethnic groups left over from world war 2 or the cold war '' . 
  however you could n't stop thinking your turkophobia and you mentioned about turks even in this subject , manipulating the question to get upvotes and using islamaphobic feelings of the people . 
  incisive but not clever . 
  we have n't even joined to ww2 ( until the last day ) nor involved cold war . 
  i have already one and he is at 5 baby power ( colic problem ) . 
  i promised myself not to have another when i woke up with his cries again at 6 am . 
  nah , i do n't think i can even find its location on the map . 
  i think he is a new president of somewhere . 
  thanks for the answer though . 
  oh , thank you very much . 
  very few of us know that it is coming from yiddish and tells about life difficulties of jew people in ussr ( my father has told it to me . 
  i do n't know if it is right really . 
  a correction could be nice ) people ( who has borned at 60s ) are generally know it from the french version . 
  new generation has no idea at all . 
  i believe they think it has turkish origin . 
   the song has been written in turkey in 1972 ( or 1973 ) . 
  first version : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7czaxx03zvg, 
  yeah turkish version has been inspired from that song . 
  is it yiddish , right ? 
  hehe , no this one : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmomfjbvwq4, 
  lol !, 
  sorry mate , may be i had to put putin to exception list too . 
  i am sure this one : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy20uwiq1ri, 
  i do n't know if it is clean as same as singapore though but i know they are the best in lgbt rights in asia . 
  or one of the best countries in asia ... 
  that explains . 
  cambodia, 
  it can be diplomacy , domestic politics , speech , etc. 
  thanks for reminding , 
  lol . 
  may be i had to text `` except erdogan '' . 
  just asked for making things clear , no one told armenians are immigrants here . 
  there are generally [ lr aloe vera ] ( https://www.lrworld.com/ ) in turkey . 
  i do n't know if there is any other ? 
  however armenians are minority group , right ? 
  hahaha .
