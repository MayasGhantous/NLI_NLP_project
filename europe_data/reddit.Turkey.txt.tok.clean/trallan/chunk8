  i wish he had . 
  ** greece ** we do n't have any problem with greece , however i do n't also think that we are also good . 
  we always had the aegean sea conflict . 
  there are also some historical issues . 
  there are some greeks who dislike turks for the turkish invasion in the past . 
  there are also turks who dislike greeks because of turkish independence war issues . 
  ** bulgaria ** bulgaria ... 
  i do n't even know that country exists nowadays . 
  it is not even like neighbour to us really . 
  we have no serious political relations with them . 
  some people in turkey ( especially in thrace ) does n't like bulgarians because of the massacres they have done in balkan wars and pressure against turks who are living in bulgaria in communism ( racism ? ), 
  years . 
  bulgarians also do n't like us because of the turkish invasion . 
  ** georgia ** we are good with georgia but some of them still angry us for the turkish invasion . 
  there are many georgians living in turkey , we are good with them . 
  they are friendly and nice . 
  ** armenia ** we are not good with armenia and there is an embargo of turkey against this country because of they have invaded qarabag in azerbaijan . 
  there is also conflicts for armenian incidents in 1915 . 
  they demand locations and cities from the turkey for compensation of these 1915 incidents . 
  they want to create their kingdoms on anatolia again which exists about 14 centuries ago . 
  :d they also want georgia and azerbaijan to cede some regions to their country . 
  heh ** azerbaijan ** our good friends . 
  they are also turk . 
  mehmed the conqueror suleiman the magnificent ( may be some french people like him . 
  do n't know though ), 
  we know , however we know him with his epic defeats . 
  lol . 
  he is hardly a figure . 
  may be crete war but crete 's faith was already clear before the war . 
  by the way personally i do n't hate venizelos . 
  i do n't even think that he really wanted to invade the turkey . 
  he was generally trying the keep peace in the region . 
  albanians are the best integrated group . 
  they have already moved to turkey for centuries ago and they also introduce their first identity as turkish . 
  we happy that they are the part of the country . 
  it is not my self opinion since i have armenian friends but the disliked minority is armenians despite they are well-integrated with turks . 
  every foreign attempts which involve with armenian incident which happened 1915 are making relations worse and increasing armenian hatred more . 
  armenians who are living in turkey already want this problem to get fixed between only armenians and turks . 
  i do n't know about thoughts of armenia armenians . 
  yeah with 2011 census . 
  sorry i think i have confused with the mother language . 
  he was . 
  no one made a song for trump in turkey but for obama : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy20uwiq1ri that 's sick though . 
  thanks for reminding this song to me . 
  writing codes , watching game of thrones . 
  my father in law . 
  may be you are wearing one of his products now . 
  yeah , i know . 
  it is just thoughts of people . 
  i have heard that from many people , that 's why i have shared it on here . 
  one of my room friends in university had a serious excema problem . 
  however we were eating together , he was cooking , we were using many stuff together . 
  personally i have never gone a pool , i prefer to go to beach . 
  lol , yeah , i forgot about germans . 
  lol . 
  it was another epic educational wwi stuff . 
  erdogan just knows turkish . 
  * evil grin *, 
  a sentence for albanians . 
  i could just recall that . 
  i will edit this if i can remember more . 
  - behaving coquettishly like armenian bride . 
  - we tell it to people who are doing a job very slow . 
  - speaking like a bulgarian radio : we tell it to people who are really speaking fast and incomprehensible . 
  - pouring greeks into the sea : i do n't want greek bros to get anger to this . 
  now we use it for just for sarcasm and for criticize the one-sided and poor education in turkey . 
  people who has borned in 80s has passed whole their primary school life with this sentence in history classes . 
  what was teacher telling us : `` mustafa kemal has beaten greek army in battle of sakarya . 
  then we pour greeks in to the agean sea from the smyrna coasts '' . 
  some people does n't feel public pools are healthy in my country since anyone with skin diseases can enter pools . 
  some other thinks it is a good alternative of the sea , especially if they are not living close to sea . 
  of course having a personal pool is awesome :d, 
  oh means country of calatans :p sorry for the sikh guy . 
  hehe . 
  calling ethnics is better than racist i believe . 
  :d i know a sentence of a wise man also . 
  he says `` you are citizens of the country which you feel that you are belong to . '', 
  however it is not that easy today ... 
  according to the wise man i mentioned above , that sikh guy has become a catalan . 
   well , catalan 's and basque 's independence thoughts has started with nationalism . 
  basque 's are still nationalist and they also get supports of people . 
  however catalan 's has changed their politics when they have lost to majority ( with ethnics ) in region . 
  according to some random statistics ( lol ) catalans had ethnic majority in the region in 1920s . 
   this is how catalan independence movement started . 
  when catalans had lost to majority ( except valencia ) in the region they had to change politic strategy . 
  ethnics and religion ( some regions ) are make differences in balkans . 
  can you tell me if catalonia get independence what will be the country 's name ? 
  actually i know all independence movements in spain . 
  i know askatasuna and their politics . 
  i know eta and i know all news about catalans and their independent movements . 
  you have cut all words i have told there and pointed to ethnics . 
  serbians are patriotic people so ethnics are important for them . 
  as same as other balkan countries . 
  so i have given ethnic as an example there since the subject is serbia . 
  i know many independence movements like religious ( eg : zamboanga - philippines , tamils - sri lanka ) and political ( eg : north korea & north vietnam ) . 
  my point is being majority in the region . 
  if a sikh even wants independency of catalonia it will be just in catalonia . 
  but you will need numbers ( majority ) for that in the catalan region . 
  otherwise it is not important who supports you or not . 
  i would want to discuss more about this however i will retire after this post only for today .
