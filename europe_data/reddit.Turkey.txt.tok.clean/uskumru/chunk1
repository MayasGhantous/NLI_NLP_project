yes . 
  take a look at [ this map ] ( http://www.cografya.gen.tr/egitim/bolgeler/bolgeler.jpg ) : every one of those regions think they are better than the rest , and that their cuisine is superior . 
  also , non-kurds like to blame the kurds for many things . 
  people from \u0130stanbul think ankara is a grey and boring place . 
  there also seems to be the general view that everything in the east is what is holding back the country , and the opposite : everything in the west/on the coast is infidel land . 
  so , nobody likes each other , and they like other countries even less . 
  the result is the `` memleket/hem \u015feri '' mentality , where one of the first things you 're asked when you meet someone new is which city you are from . 
  if you are from the same city , there is an expectation that you two should get along . 
  except its official name is ak-saray . 
  saray means palace . 
  probably . 
  saw is n't overloaded ( in fact there 's plenty of space for more passengers afaik ) , but yes it 's supposed to help out with atat\u00fcrk , which is getting a bit cramped . 
  ** turkey ** * erdo\u011fan got elected as president * a syrian [ killed his landlord ] ( http://haberler.com/suriyeli-kiraci-ev-sahibini-oldurdu-mahalleli-6369834-haberi/ ) in gaziantep * the third airport in \u0130stanbul will be [ named after erdo\u011fan ] ( http://www.radikal.com.tr/turkiye/ucuncu_havalimaninin_adi_recep_tayyip_erdogan_havalimani_olacak-1206623 ) * pkk has [ built a statue of a terrorist ] ( http://www.hukukihaber.net/gundem/pkk-heykel-dikti-h46056.html ) in diyarbak\u0131r so , nothing very interesting lately . 
  also , today it has been 15 years since the \u0130zmit earthquake . 
  it seems that the only things they know are the cyprus thing , armenian genocide , and trying to get in the eu . 
  it 's almost guaranteed that when a thread about turkey comes up , these will be mentioned . 
  when there is any negative news ( which is quite often ) someone will say `` and that 's why they 're not in the eu '' or `` this is the country that wants to get in the eu ? 
  '' , and most of the time it 's not relevant at all . 
  i think it might be because people do n't really know anything else about the country , so they try to tie it all in to these things . 
  [ biraz aray\u0131p buldum ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/search?q=melting+pot&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all ), 
  yup , gazi means veteran . 
  but even after the official names are changed , people still use the original name . 
  the only other city with the gazi prefix is gaziantep , but it 's called antep . 
  also , gazi is n't the only prefix , urfa was changed to \u015eanl\u0131urfa for example, 
  turkey 1 . 
  let 's count \u0130stanbul 's old parts as a whole here .

  the favourite has to be azerbaijan , since we 're basically the same . 
  the least favourite might be armenia , though we do n't actually like any of our other neighbours . 
  ** turkey ** * a syrian war plane was shot down because it flew a few kilometres into our airspace . 
  the pilot got out safely . 
  * a recording of one of erdo\u011fan 's sons ' phone calls was leaked . 
  he talks with a swiss girl in extremely broken english , swears a lot , and they 're apparently together . 
  however , burak is already married . 
  he threatens the girl a lot . 
  * a recording of erdo\u011fan was leaked . 
  he was behind the leaking of a sex tape , of his rival political party 's former leader baykal . 
  baykal had to resign because of this tape a few years ago . 
  according to this conversation , he planned that the sex tape would be leaked and spread on the internet . 
  * a recording was leaked of our minister of foreign affairs , undersecretaries of our foreign ministry and of our national intelligence organization , and of our second chief of the general staff . 
  they talked about a plot to invade syria , by sending agents there to attack turkey so there would be an excuse to invade . 
  some of their ideas were to send rockets , to attack the soldiers at suleyman \u015eah 's tomb ( an exclave ) , and so on . 
  * youtube was banned . 
  * several journalists affiliated with the g\u00fclen movement ( former allies of the government ) were arrested . 
  * we are having our local elections today . 
  there are some reports of fraud . 
  yes , it 's been falling out of favor with people and it 's not a successful political ideology to push for , though many people do believe in it . 
  i do n't support g\u00fclen , or the current government . 
  none of the parties really reflect my views . 
  ** turkey ** * in last year 's gezi protests , a 14 year old boy named berkin elvan went out to get bread , got hit by a tear gas container , and went in a coma . 
  in the following 270 days he fell from 45 to 16 kg , and died on tuesday . 
  after that , there were widespread protests again . 
  police used extreme force , of course . 
  next day , thousands of people attended his funeral . 
  [ picture ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/bihel5zcaaahylj.jpg ) * several more tapped phone conversations were leaked . 
  one was of erdo\u011fan refusing to stop the police intervention in the gezi protests last june . 
  if he had , all the deaths and injuries could have been avoided . 
  other leaked conversations : about plotting against be\u015fikta\u015f football club and its supporters , about intimidating an already pathetic and obedient media boss , about organising an operation on the g\u00fclen cemaat , etc. . . * erdo\u011fan has also been travelling each province for party meetings . 
  in many cases , most of the supporters have been either paid to come , or intimidated ( such as with losing their jobs ) into coming . 
  so much that in today 's \u0130zmir meeting ( \u0130zmir has very little support for akp ) , they even said things like `` welcome to \u0130zmir '' , `` we will intimidate the people of \u0130zmir '' . 
  to give you an idea , here are some pictures . 
  [ 1 ] ( https://scontent-b-vie.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/t1.0-9/1976892_10151878635916191_1402193050_n.jpg ) [ 2 ] ( http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/foto/foto_galeri/51197/1/izmir_de_akp_mitingi_oncesi_goruntuler.html ) ( those are the buses they came in . ), 
  after the meeting , some of these people went around calling people greek seeds , greek whores , heathens ( ... ) provoking the locals etc. 
  [ video ] ( http://instagram.com/p/lnbyochvvc/# ) * the leftist terror group dhkp-c killed a supporter of the government . 
  they may have been bribed to do it by the government . 
  * egemen ba\u011f\u0131\u015f ( former eu minister ) called the people at berkin elvan 's funeral necrophiliacs . 
  * the ergenekon operation suspects have been released from prison after a few years , including the former army chief and some journalists . 
  he had a heart attack due to tear gas . 
  it looks like you 've defined the second city as the second largest , not the biggest other than the capital , so i 'll go with ankara . 
  in popular culture it 's seen as a bit of a dull place , with a saying that the best part of it is the return to istanbul . 
  it 's actually not too bad , but there is n't much to see or do for anyone who is n't used to the city , so that may be why . 
  politically it is important of course , because it 's the capital . 
  it has good universities , and it 's the second most populous city . 
  that 's all , really . 
  it 's got much less media coverage than istanbul . 
  it has many seats in the parliament . 
  the current mayor ( he 's been there for ~ 20 years ) is from akp . 
  in the local elections , only about one month away , he might lose his seat . 
  ( there is a high probability that the votes will be rigged for him anyway . ), 
  all the state institutions are in ankara , as far as i know . 
  it was n't very important until the 1920s , when it was chosen to be the capital as a central place , hard to invade , and far away from the sultan 's government in istanbul . 
  before that time it was n't extremely relevant , and maybe until the 1940s it was the primary city . 
  [ i 'd like to finish with this pic of an angora rabbit . 
  in primary school they learn the seven regions , later in geography lessons everyone is supposed to know the 81 provinces . 
  i do n't think the average student will remember the places of more than half of them after a while . 
  actually it 's the same logic as italia becoming italy , it went from turk-ia to turkey, 
  the context is that protesters were protesting . 
  that 's enough to get a beating from turkish cops . 
  i mean , they were n't actually protesting but they were 20-something people sitting around in \u0130zmir so they would be acceptable targets . 
  the police were probably already angry and searching for something to take it out on . 
  baklava of course , but it has gluten . 
  personally i like [ kazandibi ] ( http://www.phuocndelicious.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/efendy_kazandibi.jpg ) . 
  it 's kind of like milk pudding covered with caramelised sugar . 
  it 's mostly eaten by itself , anytime , at a pastry shop . 
  i ca n't really think of any desserts we have that are gluten-free . 
  maybe [ tavukg\u00f6\u011fs\u00fc ] ( http://iloveturkishfood.blogspot.com/2007/07/yalanci-tavuk-gogsu-fake-chicken-breast.html ) , it 's easy to make if you fake it and do n't put any chicken in . 
  i 'll try , but it may take a while .
