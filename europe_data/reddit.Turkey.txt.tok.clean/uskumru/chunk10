  a special agreement or partnership would be a better idea for both sides . 
  i 've been mistaken for a local in every single place i 've been so far , which is most of europe . 
  i guess i just look very average . 
  maybe it 's just me who notices this , but foreigners ( especially english-speaking ones ) put more emphasis on consonants , when it should be on vowels . 
  also , the i in \u0130stanbul is n't supposed to be long ; and if you ca n't pronounce \u0131 , use schwa instead , not i. 
  it used to be a pretty big deal , most people would at least check it out , until we stopped participating . 
  yes , sunset . 
  [ ottomans had their own units ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ottoman_units_of_measurement ) but they 're not used anywhere except in idioms now . 
  we also switched to the current measurement of time around those years , which makes stuff confusing reading old books . 
  sunset was always 12.00 and the clocks had to be adjusted every day . 
  when i went to greece there were several places named after ones in turkey , probably because of the population exchange , it was weird . 
  a paper is sent to your home telling you where the ballot box you 'll vote in is . 
  you go to the school you 're assigned to , find the classroom the box is in , and maybe wait in line outside the door if it 's crowded . 
  when it 's your turn you leave your bag and phone , show the observers your paper , and give them your id . 
  they find your name on the list they have and give you an envelope . 
  you go into a booth ( generally there are 2 in a classroom ) . 
  inside the envelope is the ballot paper ( [ here 's an example ] ( http://image.cdn.iha.com.tr/contents/store/img/1042000/1042183.jpg ) ) . 
  it 's generally kind of large with many parties that participate in the election together with the independent candidates . 
  you stamp the indicated space under whatever party you choose . 
  then you try to fold the paper so it 'll fit back in the envelope , which is the most difficult part . 
  you put the envelope in the ballot box , sign next to your name on the list ( which they checked earlier ) and go home . 
  haval\u0131 = airy , `` with airs '' . 
  a big deal can be made out of anything , but it 's generally forgotten very quickly too . 
  honestly i do n't see the deal with zwarte piet , as long as the people who are actually black do n't have a problem with it , and it does n't seem so ? 
  saying any of these could end badly for you : * erdo\u011fan is a traitor/atat \u00fcrk is a traitor ( if not one , the other will work ) * why do n't you recognize the armenian genocide ? 
  * why do you kill kurds ? 
  also , depending on the person ; looking at them funny , talking behind their back , calling them gay or implying they 're not `` a man '' , insulting their family/religion , calling them communist/anarchist/atheist , insulting turkey or anything could start a fight . 
  lots of people seem to be 2 seconds away from throwing punches . 
  [ this ] ( http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=booze&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 ) seems more likely though, 
  so it is , i should have checked , thanks for correcting . 
  really ? 
  i guess we 'll have to be careful when swearing abroad . 
  til, 
  i guess so , but i could n't decide when to cut off the time period , and excluded some words that were too old . 
  i did n't want to add the ones that we borrowed from persian or arabic , or there would be more, 
  not sure if these exist in other languages than english : caique and lackey and balaclava, 
  edit : mostly removed just in case . 
  i 'm angry and resigned , i do n't feel fear or despair or hope . 
  i feel less and less like a turkish * citizen * . 
  the problem is , they already * had * to move it from istanbul , so the place they chose as ideal was ankara . 
  personally i would n't move it back to istanbul , so maybe eski\u015fehir or bursa if we really had to . 
  they 're large enough , close to important places already , and generally suitable . 
  how dare you . 
  it 's delicious with rice . 
  i personally dislike i\u015fkembe but i would n't say most people do n't like it . 
  our food is generally good . 
  what do you think of mumbar or \u015f\u0131rdan ? 
  here 's an [ image ] ( http://www.turkbul.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/turkish-lira-tl.jpg ) of all banknotes and coins . 
  notice that atat\u00fcrk is happier when you have more money . 
  ( is the manager a manager ? ), 
  the earliest remains are from 8700 years ago , pliny the elder claimed it was formed around 3200 years ago as lygos ( first mentioned name ) , though the most certain legend says it became byzantium 2684 years ago ( which is when we 're sure it was continously inhabited after ) , so choose whichever you want . 
  to the several people i saw in this thread who would like to stay on dst permanently : why ? 
  we 're doing it right now and in the winter it 's a total headache . 
  in the morning there 's no sun until you get to work ( normally this should happen much farther north ) and it increases the amount of traffic accidents , and you think you will get extra sunlight in the afternoon but actually when you get out of work it 's dark anyway . 
  the sun used to rise after i got out in the morning , now it 's rising too late to see . 
  it 's a 3 week transition for an extra hour of daylight after 6 pm , as in , the change affects you for about 6 weeks of extra sunlight total . 
  it just does n't seem to be worth the misery so far . 
  it would be better to have no dst at all and stay in the original time all year . 
  once i saw a weird grey shape with a tail , but it disappeared in two seconds so i ca n't be sure whatever it was . 
  i want to believe . 
  a lot of different kinds of trees are common , it depends on the area and climate . 
  [ i found a map ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-q7474mrj0-y/utnthdxnbwi/aaaaaaaaaoa/i-r6iz_1nxw/s1600/turkiye_bitki_haritasi.jpg ) and a [ wiki page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:forests_of_turkey ) . 
  wikipedia also tells me turkey has ~ 10000 plant species , one third are endemic . 
  i can only list the most common . 
  north parts , black sea : holly , laurel , box , alder , beech , chestnut , fir , pine . 
  in higher regions , fir , spruce , red and yellow pines . 
  [ pic from rize ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fsvlt9xsvzs/vy073diyxii/aaaaaaaaat0/ysbo-yz4gye/s1600/20150611_101530.jpg ) western parts : olives , red and yellow pine , black pine/larch , nut pines , oak , beech , chestnut , fir . 
  [ mount kaz ( ida ] ( http://resimler.balnet.net/konu/blnt/kazdaglari/kazdaglari.jpg ) mediterranean : red pine , oriental sweetgum , cedar , fir , black pine , oak , juniper , hornbeam , yew , alder , linden . 
  [ taurus mountains ] ( http://www.fotografturk.com/upload/fotograf/2012/1/30/16176-safak07-toroslar-1773-950px.jpg ) central regions : there are not many forests , more grassland . 
  oak , black or yellow pine , birch . 
  [ yozgat ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/original/6239506.jpg ) east : fewer forests because it 's generally too mountainous and cold . 
  oak , pine , birch , cedar , fir . 
  i could n't find any good pictures . 
  there 's a lot of regional variation in these `` categories '' . 
  also a lot of trees only found in specific places , which i could n't list here . 
  our country ... forest preservation ... lol . 
  did you mean forest destruction ? 
  around where i live , [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c4%b0%c4%9fneada_floodplain_forests_national_park#fauna ) section has a good list of animals . 
  i only ever saw deer and mice , and maybe a wildcat . 
  the water and air animals are generally much more visible . 
  in other areas you can find basically anything you think of probably . 
  who would n't be proud of an [ angora bunny ] ( https://i.imgur.com/eiao4rn.jpg ) ? 
  more seriously the [ kangal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kangal_dog ) is very useful , they 're very good guardians and very gentle too unless you act stupid . 
  there 's also the [ anatolian shepherd ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anatolian_shepherd ) , basically the same type but more forceful . 
  they 're popular in protecting livestock but i see many of them wild too . 
  500.000 people ( maybe more ) attended z\u00fclf\u00fc livaneli 's concert in ankara in 1997 . 
  edit : [ here ] ( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xaech3_gunesle-geliyoruz-ankara-hipdrom-ko_music ) are the first 20 minutes . 
  for words like kiosk , it 's true that they passed through turkish , but i did n't want to add them because they 're originally persian . 
  for turquoise , it 's named after the ethnicity , but it seems rather obviously french . 
  horde is from ordu , which means army . 
  and then there 's the obvious ones like yogurt . 
  i never saw it with fruit , but that sounds delicious . 
  thanks !, 
  wow , one of the mysteries of my life is solved . 
  do you mean it has biscuits , or is it like a sponge cake ? 
  and do you know if it has a name ? 
  we have [ alman pastas\u0131 ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rb8rh8ojpae/maxresdefault.jpg ) ( german cake ) but it does n't seem to be an actual german cake . 
  edit : til, 
  exactly , and it can cause problems in the current situation , because some people ( and officials ) discriminate by looking at the religion part on the id . 
  nah , they 're more religious and conservative on average .
