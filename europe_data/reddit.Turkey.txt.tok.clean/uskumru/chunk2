  edit : an organization is made in china , the people in the organization start several firms and open bank accounts for them . 
  they make fake bills and go to the banks to turn them into real money . 
  the money goes from the chinese banks to several banks in turkey , most importantly halkbank . 
  the money is withdrawn and taken to the orient bazaar , some of it is turned into gold . 
  they are brought to airports in turkey , joined with gold directly from ghana , back to turkey and from here to dubai where they are turned into money and again gold . 
  from there to tehran , where they are turned into both money and gold . 
  meanwhile in iran , some fake exports from the fake chinese firms are sent to different banks and accounts . 
  `` leaders '' in iran give reza sarrab some money , he exploits and distributes the money , sends it back to turkey .

  ** turkey ** * [ a corruption scandal ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-25514579 ) : i probably wo n't get all the details . 
  to simplify , there are two powerful groups in the current government , the conservative akp people and the religious g\u00fclen people . 
  the g\u00fclenists have decided to abandon akp and reveal the corruption . 
  a famous construction-sector millionaire , several ministers ' sons and the husband of a celebrity were arrested . 
  the [ scheme ] ( http://cdncms.zaman.com.tr/2013/12/20/harita2-b.jpg ) involved banks , iran , oil money and 87 billion euros , some found hidden in a shoebox . 
  police found money-counting machines in their houses , and such . 
  the chief executive of a major bank was also arrested . 
  of course for the first few days the media tried to downplay it , then a few ministers resigned . 
  one did it live on tv and asked erdo\u011fan also to resign , since he was the main man and everyone apparently had his consent . 
  he also said that erdo\u011fan was pressuring his ministers . 
  then the interior minister resigned , after he sacked many police officers and solicitors . 
  that night , erdo\u011fan renewed his whole cabinet ( including egemen ba\u011f\u0131\u015f . . ) a republic solicitor ( not sure how to translate that ) made a declaration where he said the evidence and the files had been taken from him . 
  also the police refused to obey court orders to arrest more people in a second wave . 
  * someone stabbed a balloon santa . 
  * an earthquake south of antalya , it did n't do much damage except scaring people . 
  * the lira 's exchange rate went down badly , 3 for an euro and 2,10 for a dollar . 
  * on friday there were protests against the government as always , and police were [ assholes as always ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stjrhcreigo&amp;feature=youtu.be ), 
  what ??? 
  we study ottomans for a long time , like 60 % of the history lessons are ottomans and the other part is ancient anatolian civilizations and ww1 . 
  or is this sarcasm and am i missing it ? 
  we also study moldova a little with romania , and i do n't remember stephen iii 's name probably because they are all referred to as prince of x , king of y. . . 
  something must have gone wrong in translation ... 
  the general word for citrus fruits is narenciye , so at least we got that right ? 
  well , in turkish it 's called portekiz , how did you miss that ? 
  though i guess the absence of - gal would n't really count, 
  ** turkey ** * in 2004 the pm , the national security council and others met and decided to end the influence of g\u00fclen 's movement . 
  a journalist published these decisions recently in the g\u00fclenist newspaper taraf , and this week the government requested criminal action against the journalist . 
  a newer report from taraf shows that the government has profiled employees of the national intelligence organization by religious sect and monitored their activities .

  the protests were because of claims that eight pkk terrorists ' graves were desecrated . 
  officially the justification is that the protesters were attacking the police with molotov cocktails , handmade bombs . 
  non-official sources say that the police attacked suddenly without warning . 
  some people have been protesting because of this but they were also attacked , as usual .

  the tff was criticized for this even by the minister of sports , that their action was divisive . 
  probably to try and justify their decision , they also called some galatasaray players to the commitee for wearing shirts in memory of mandela .

  the murderer has been protected by the government . 
  he does not bother to come to his court cases . 
  this week it is claimed that he appeared in court with a fake moustache and wig , like for the previous ones . 
  it was requested that if the claim is true , he should remove his wig . 
  the judges withdrew from the case .

  ( also , the university exam system changes once every few years . ), 
  it is basically impossible to go to a good/average university without spending at least 2 years in these prep schools . 
  some are controlled by religious groups , some not . 
  due to the disagreement between erdo\u011fan and the g\u00fclen movement , it has been proposed that these prep schools be closed . 
  this is ridiculous , until the schools are better or the exams are fairer they have no right to shut them down.the prep schools are an indirect tool for the argument , it seems , and the students have to bear the inconveniences . 
  with the end of the argument , the prep school thing seems to have also been forgotten or cooled down .

  even more disturbing than the usual akp shit .
