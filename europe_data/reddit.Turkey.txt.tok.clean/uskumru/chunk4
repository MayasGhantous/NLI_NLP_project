  it 's always said that the turks converted to islam peacefully and it was compatible with the tengriism ( a sort of shamanism ) . 
  then we learn about the ottomans and all the `` good '' they did like converting people to islam , taking over anatolia . . 
  in the end they say the ottomans conquered constantinople and were very peaceful , everything was great as soon as the war was over , there was no looting . 
  then they talk about the balkans and north aftrica a bit , where ottomans were peaceful and accepting of others . 
  there is almost no talk of the harem ( ca n't blame them for not talking about masses of young ladies in front of hormonal teenagers ) or the dev\u015firme . 
  they are always shown in a good light until the lale devri , and afterwards it 's like the sultans become the enemies of the public . 
  this is to set up ww1 and the young turk movement and ataturk is emphasized like crazy . 
  months about every little step he took , everywhere he went , where was he at what date . . armenian genocide is obviously not mentioned at all . 
  apparently they were traitors and conspired with the russians against the sultan so they had to be `` taken care of '' . 
  one sentence in the textbook , i think it was . 
  we do n't have much covered after ww2 , so there is nothing about the coups and treatment of kurds either , and this seems to be a big problem for the general public . 
  my history teacher was a little biased though , he wanted the old days with tulips and poetry back again ... edit : also the only non-turkish history we learn about is ancient civilizations of anatolia and a little of china in the 5th century . 
  there is an emphasis on `` terrifying battle-ready turkic/mongolic horse riders with spears !! '' . 
  the cyprus issue is very one-sided also . 
  the textbook says the turks were being massacred so the military stepped in with minimal violence and stay there to protect the north half . 
  [ this ] ( https://docs.google.com/document/edit?id=1p0q62yfrg_dg36iyjbkdmc_dyxlb5n5c5utwyqxi24g ) is also very creative . 
  istanbul is still governed by ankara . . :(, 
  when a point is closer to one capital than any other , it is inside that capital 's area . 
  for example most of wales is closer to dublin than london , so it is inside dublin 's area . 
  some people think this is 12:30 . 
  they are the worst kind of people . 
  12:00 - 13:00 - midday ( \u00f6\u011fle ) 13:00 - 16:00 - afternoon ( \u00f6\u011fleden sonra ) 16:00 - 20:00 - evening ( ak\u015fam\u00fcst\u00fc ) 20:00 - 22:00 - between evening and night ( ak\u015fam ) 22:00 - 03:00 - night ( gece ) most people call the time between midnight and sunrise `` sabah\u0131n k\u00f6r\u00fc '' , it means the dull time of the morning , but i did n't add it . 
  there is also [ bianet ] ( http://www.bianet.org/english ) for turkey . 
   burek as concept is in fact bosnian in origin [ & # 3232 ;\\ _ & # 3232  ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/burek#origin_and_name ), 
  kebab . . no , not really .

  good . 
  our `` eu ministry '' is just filled with corruption , made more to give ba\u011f\u0131\u015f a job than to get in the eu [ . 
  ] ( http://listelist.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/ouokl-egemen-bagis-twitter-silinen-tweet.png ), 
  i meant the central asians . 
  which conquest ? 
  oh , nevermind , i did n't realise you were racist the first time . 
  we could discuss that , but this happened in europe . 
  it 's very likely . 
  he staged an [ anti-coup ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22sledgehammer%22_plot ) . 
  ( i 'm not saying this is a lie , it is likely that generals were plotting , but many other people who were innocent were also jailed because they did n't like the akp . 
  the evidence was also disproved ), 
  it wo n't cost * you * . 
  it costs us . . 
  the sexual content were insults , if it 's the video i remember watching . 
  the geography is right , but it 's the linguistics . 
  [ baltic languages ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltic_languages ) are in the indo-european family and livonian was [ uralic ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uralic_languages ) . 
  the eu is obviously the least of our worries ... 
  when they were installed does n't really matter . 
  your government is ( from what i see on wikipedia ) sort of religious , but ours is much worse . 
  maybe 75 % ? 
  not a lot of people drink , really . 
  yeah , but gay marriage and atheists are normal in canada . 
  the motives are different . 
  yes , but that 's a language map , i did n't link a language map because the original point was that languages and ethnicities are unrelated . 
  my first map classified people as slavic , indo-european and turkic , which is n't a great way to sort things but it put all turkic people in the same group , as related people . 
  though it also put slavic and indo-european as different things , so i do n't know why . . ^ ^ i ^ ^ think ^ ^ this ^ ^ is ^ ^ turning ^ ^ into ^ ^ a ^ ^ pointless ^ ^ argument ^ ^ and ^ ^ i ^ ^ feel ^ ^ like ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ right ^ ^ but ^ ^ ca n't ^ ^ prove ^ ^ it, 
  oh , i guess i 'm wrong about the first one . 
  still , i do n't think turkic groups are as unrelated to each other as europeans seem to be . 
  ( i 'm still on a phone . . more later if i remember ) edit : [ this map ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/central_asia_ethnic_en.svg ) and [ this link ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnic_groups_in_asia#central_asia ) seem to say that turkic peoples are one related group . 
  the disambiguation page 's third link is about ethnicity . 
  and turkic peoples at least are definitely related . 
  europeans are mostly indo-europeans . 
  this includes armenians , iranians , and some people in india . 
  turkey is mostly made of turkic people . 
  of course this is n't all true in reality , you could argue what the actual genetics of turkey and iran are . 
  ( sorry if i made mistakes , i 'm on a phone , there 's more on wikipedia ), 
  that number is n't from the census but from the id cards , i think . 
  for example , it counts most of my friends and me as muslim , even if we are n't , because we were recorded as muslims from birth and it 's very inconvenient to change it . 
  i 'm sure the number is high , but more like 92 % or something . 
  at first , `` lady be quiet '' could be excused if he said susun instead of sus which would be politer because it 's second person plural instead of singular . 
  the second part is clearly `` you should n't speak because you 're a woman '' . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_gilbumzyw ) is the video , he says at 0:15 : `` han\u0131mefendi sus , bir kad\u0131n olarak sus '' . 
  sus is basically a rude way of saying be quiet , but i would n't actually translate it as shut up . 
  so he is saying , `` lady be quiet ; as a lady , be quiet '' as a better translation i think . 
  edit : i messed up an important thing . 
  it 's supposed to be `` as a woman , be quiet '' in the second part,

  this is the only source i could find in english . 
  context is that most of the country had no electricity for several hours this morning and we do n't know why . 
  if that 's the same word as peynirli , it means `` cheesy '' over here . 
  pide can also mean a bread of [ this ] ( http://www.nerimantokdil.com/attachments/image/ekmekler/pide.jpg ) type . 
  that tu tu tududu is when he says `` t\u00fcrk k\u00fclt\u00fcr\u00fcn\u00fc '' , if you were wondering . 
  except the saying comes from the leaked phone calls between him and his father , so it 's not a public speaking thing . 
  pazar + ertesi , ertesi means `` the one after '' sal\u0131 , from arabic `` third day '' \u00c7ar\u015famba , from persian `` fourth day '' , \u00e7ahar ( four ) and \u015fabba / \u015fanba ( saturday ) per\u015fembe , same as above but panc ( five ) instead of \u00e7ahar cuma , from arabic `` day of gathering '' cuma + ertesi , obvious pazar , the word for market is from persian [ check this out ] ( http://nisanyansozluk.com/ ) if you 're interested , whenever i wonder where something came from it 's very useful , and there 's some very interesting stuff in it . 
   isis is supported by most of turkey . 
  source ? 
  they meant the treaty of sevres . 
  there was no ottoman empire at that point . 
  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/treatyofsevres_ ( corrected ) . png, 
  for us , it was obvious a few hours after the attempt . 
  we do n't need to assume , because there is evidence . 
  the people in the military who were known to support g\u00fclen participated in the coup , the rest did n't . 
  how is there data for greek islands but not for the rest of the country ? 
  is that an error ? 
  yes , gar is from french , the \u0131 is a suffix . 
  after writing that i did some research ( aka google ) so now i 'm not sure if philosophy was mandatory or not . 
  anyway , yes , a lot of people in the class had n't known much about ancient greece , so we had to learn history and literature too along with the philosophy for it to make sense . 
  that may or may not have been our teacher 's initiative , but to be honest i do n't remember much . 
  on the other hand , we definitely also learn about him in literature , i 'm sure of it , but literature classes are 95 % focused on turkish literature . 
  in any case i 'd say at least 20 % of people would have a general idea of who homer is , though that 's not saying much and i would be an awful source . 
  what ? 
  philosophy lessons were mandatory when i was in high school , i do n't think the number would be that low .
