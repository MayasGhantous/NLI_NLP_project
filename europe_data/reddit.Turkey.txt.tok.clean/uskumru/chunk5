  you only managed to say `` walnut of erdo\u011fan '' , but i get your point . 
   there is no prestige for where you come from either . 
  we use y the same way you use j. 
  why not ? 
  [ here , in album form ] ( http://imgur.com/a/ohear ) , or separately as : [ proportion of people who agree it is easy to find good housing at a reasonable price in their city ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jdtgx3e.png ) [ proportion of people who are satisfied with the financial situation of their household ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wg7rb1a.png ) [ dwellings by most common period of construction ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zuxbpui.png ) [ cities with the smallest and largest areas of average living space ] ( http://i.imgur.com/va0wvar.png ) [ cost of living correction coefficients for eu capital cities ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bxbub91.png ), 
  `` hizmet '' means service , it is n't an exclusive word for one group only . 
  maybe you 're thinking of [ uruk ? 
  it 's eri\u015fte , a type of noodle , eaten hot mostly like pasta . 
  i can see how you might think there 's a mass delusion of `` illuminati style evil organizations '' but they do have people in many institiutions . 
  this has been happening since the 70s ( due to past/current governments ' support ) , and everyone in turkey knows it . 
  and no , * not * all who oppose erdo\u011fan are members , that 's ridiculous , half the country is against him . 
  if you would bother to listen instead of labeling us as crazies then it would make more sense to you . 
  not quite what you asked but someone i know is an academic , she was planning to go to some sort of conference in sweden and everything was planned out , but now she has to get several permits and documents and get them approved by the university and a government office ( i forgot which ) . 
  after all this process , they can go but it 's all much stricter than before . 
  edit : this is n't even in a state university so it might be different for them . 
  referring to [ this hungarian guy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/orban ) they hired to make cannons . 
  just a reminder : the % sign goes on the right side of numbers in other languages , not left , 
  [ the more you know ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hp3dvkm.png ), 
  you 're right on the other points but do n't exaggerate , about 3.3 % do n't know how to read . 
  [ i just looked it up on t\u00fcik . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/t3rj54c.png ) of course even that 's way too high . 
  wow . 
  i always go to the pazar for such things , so i do n't know if it 's because of it or because i do n't live in a very central place , but that seems a bit high . 
  more specifically it 's between 2 to 4 lira , depending on where you buy it . 
  so , at least 0,6 $ . 
  you can see how the mountains in the south stopped the snow from going further . 
  nah , you 'll still be called nazis , but less often . 
  i do n't know , i 've already been called a terrorist vandal spy employed by israel , but i think i 'd rather be a nazi , is it nice being one ? 
  not a month , one week . 
  maybe so two points of the star stretch toward the two points of the crescent and one straight in so that it 's horizontally symmetrical ? 
  now i do n't think we 're very similar either but it 's a stretch to say it 's two different worlds . 
  that would be china or something . 
  too late , it already happened .

  this has nothing to do with my so-called ego . 
  what that guy was writing about was also serious to me , as after all i am in the same situation . 
  everything has a time and place , but they were in fact not mourning a lost relative , so if i were in their place i would like to know if i made a little mistake or not . 
  if it bugs you so much why do n't you ask the op whether they were offended ? 
  this is n't strictly a political discussion as you can see from the other comments . 
  i believed it was needed and i already said why . 
  you may think it was tasteless , i do n't , and in the end it 's not against any rules . 
  debating it any further is pointless . 
  i 'm not trying to one up anyone , if you think correcting a minor error is being a know-it-all or that i 'm `` trying to save the face of turkey '' then that 's your problem . 
  also more people see the correction this way and maybe they 'll remember it , instead of only one person learning something . 
  % comes after the number in other languages btw, 
  15 coffees is n't nearly enough incentive to learn 3 languages !, 
  are you serious ? 
  i see them everywhere even in every bakkal . 
  where are you ? 
  you 're both right , because it 's a compound word , the meaning changed . 
  i do n't want us to be too involved with anything , not with other countries ' policies , not with the eu . 
  if we had a proper government we could have had a position strong enough to stand on our own with the help of some trade deals etc. 
  both , and of some others too , but the main person behind these plans vas davuto\u011flu . 
  what i mean is the policy failed badly and now we have problems with all our neighbors . 
  sane is n't always nice . 
  he was our foreign minister , with the policy of zero problems with neighbors , that sure turned out well lol . 
  actually i do n't remember this being taught in turkish history classes either . 
  it just glossed over both sides ' massacres most of the time . 
  nobody will help us . 
  we are not special . 
  and not every one of us `` loves '' europe . 
  i agree , what i meant is that they were treated unfairly , when there are still the fetocu people in parliament ; and for all their many faults they were good opposition . 
  it seems so . 
  it 's very disappointing to see . 
  kurdish votes are split between akp and hdp . 
  as hdp has been silenced ( it 's the party members in jail , not the voters ) , their voters will either go back to akp or not vote or vote for independents as it used to be . 
  i did n't know anything about this or maybe i read about it and forgot , but you may find it interesting that the second link seems to be blocked from access , and when i looked up tevfik arif , it seems a court order on 10.10.16 removed discussions about him from some sites . 
  apart from that i am not surprised at all . 
  he seems to be close to erdo\u011fan , so of course he would be acquitted . 
  why do you ask ? 
  on one hand , yes , on the other , i 'd like to see them live with what they vote for instead of their current freedoms . 
  some . 
  on the turkish version of reddit i saw it being discussed , but it did n't really take any attention away from the ( many ) other scandals we have . 
   30-40 years he 's already 63, 
  pine nuts . 
  the filling is rice , onion , pine nuts , cinnamon , parsley , [ these currants ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zante_currant ) and sometimes tomatoes . 
  we have 2 kinds of sarma , the one served hot that has meat and rice ( etli ) , and the one served cold with olive oil and rice and nuts ( zeytinya\u011fl\u0131 ) . 
  i think this is how they do it in greece too . 
  do you always put meat in it ? 
  it 's a [ cezve ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cezve ) . 
  in that case we may excuse them , 
  they do n't seem fresh , like they 've lost some moisture and become rubbery . 
  my mother would disown me if i used them . 
  on the other hand the berries ( jam ? ), 
  look nice . 
  [ palatal and alveolar , i guess ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voiceless_palato-alveolar_affricate ) , but the same as the english one ? 
  it 's in english and on the internet . 
  it does n't reach the typical turkish person . 
  only 1 site reported on it , and that 's odatv , again the same problem . 
  lol of course not . 
  this is n't surprising , i 've seen people eat rice and pasta with bread ( as sandwiches ) . 
  yeah i noticed that , it 's weird because i distinctly remember losing points when i used an \u00e2 :(, 
  formally i would write as the language regulation authority ( the tdk ) recommends ... [ and now that i checked ] ( http://www.tdk.org.tr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;id=176:duzeltme-isareti ) , they 're back or were never removed ? 
  i definitely remember being told in school that they were n't used anymore . 
  so i would prefer to use them in any context because they can cause unfortunate misspellings . 
  while texting , nobody really bothers , so it 's up to autocorrect to put the correct letters . 
  i mean this with all letters , like i would type gumus and hope it would be corrected to g\u00fcm\u00fc\u015f , and if it did n't i would n't bother because it can be understood anyway . 
  if you 're not careful you can confuse words like kar and k\u00e2r , which are spelled the same but pronounced differently and mean snow and profit in this case . 
  ~ ~ we used the \u00e2 until a few years ago and it just stuck . ~ ~,
