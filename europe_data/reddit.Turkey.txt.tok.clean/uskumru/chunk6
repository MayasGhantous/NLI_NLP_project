  a mexican guy came in and posted cute informative pictures about mexico for a while and mexico was added to the map too . 
  it seems weird when i try to explain . 
  i think it started with [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/54o51j ) post . 
  well , sure , but it 's not as bad as [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980_turkish_coup_d'%c3%a9tat#american_involvement ) . 
  i dislike both , but at least russia does n't have a history of meddling with our internal affairs . 
  in that meaning of the word , that 's true . 
  i guess we disagree on what being homogeneous is though . 
  `` muslim conservatives '' are many , but there are also many different kinds . 
  i guess we 'll see in april . 
  are you saying that they are homogeneous because of the voter percentage ? 
  because that 's all i see . 
  you just linked the percentages . 
  of course i know what party got what amount of votes . 
  i thought you had some sort of opinion poll , because that 's where we would see evidence for such a theory either way . 
  what i 'm saying is that within that 50 % are at least 10 % people who voted out of fear because terror attacks increased after june elections , and at least 10 % more are voters who vote for akp because their preferred party has been neutralized or has no hope of crossing the threshold . 
  people are not `` homogeneous '' because they all vote for one party . 
  do you imply that 50 % of the usa is homogeneous one way , and the other half the other ? 
  because that 's not so different than this situation . 
  unified under one front does n't mean they all think the same . 
  i do n't think you can , not every country has a 10 % threshold . 
  i 'm interested , can you send me that data ? 
  of that percentage , i 'd say 10-15 % are not akp 's real voter base but voters of the old right parties that were absorbed , and yes these people are `` muslim conservatives '' but of a different sort . 
  [ the source is probably this ] ( http://nisanyanmap.com/?y=ankara&amp;t=&amp;lv=1&amp;u=1&amp;ua=0 ), 
  / r/mapporn/comments / 56hj5r /, 
  we call you h\u0131rvatistan , is that still cute ? 
  i feel sorry for myself , italians , and anyone who thinks this is kebab or pizza . 
  this does n't make sense . 
  in regions of turkey where houses have 70-80 % broadband connection according to the second map , over 34 % have never used the internet according to the first map ? 
   kebab pizza with creme fraiche and fries what . 
  you might be right , because especially the tea is suspect . 
  the problem is that we do n't see the reality here : the bread is missing , and who knows what else ? 
  hotel staff ? 
  i 've been there , that looks like a public picnic table , note the plastic plates and utensils and cups that no establishment would use ... 
  these tables exist all around that place , and anyway i was talking about generally the family members who get up before everyone and leave the dishes to the ones who get up late . 
  haha that may be true , some of my family gets up very early , but me . . 
  i can barely wake up on week days even if i get enough sleep , so i guess i naturally sleep in when i get a chance . 
  i just do n't see how some people can get 5 hours of sleep and still function the next day . 
  do n't teach me your secrets . 
  besides : someone does have to get up early and prepare all the stuff you see !, 
  on weekdays before work , but on weekends when we have this type of breakfast , any time when everyone is awake , but generally before noon , there 's no hurry . 
  i think 10 am is a good estimate actually . 
  i 'm not an alcoholphobe , i just have a bad stomach and could never dream of drinking beer so early so i was surprised , i think you 're jumping to conclusions . 
  okay then , interesting , 
  would you really have beer for breakfast though ? 
  if anyone 's curious : dish on top row ( farthest ) : honey and a little butter . 
  second row : tomatoes , maybe yogurt , cucumbers or peppers ? 
  third row : probably ka\u015far cheese , menemen , something i zoomed in on but could n't identify ( edit : g\u00f6zleme ?? ), 
  fourth row : lor or tulum cheese ( more probably lor ) , jar of honey , black olives fifth row : lor or tulum cheese ( looks more fatty , so this may be tulum ) , beyaz ( white ) cheese , teapot mia : bread, 
  all these european leaders and people still liked obama best ? 
  we do n't actually have an official coat of arms though , that 's unofficial . 
  there 's a [ wiki article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_emblem_of_turkey ) on its nonexistence . 
  [ here ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/echo/files/aid/countries/factsheets/turkey_syrian_crisis_en.pdf ) is a source from the ec with many relevant numbers , and only from 17 days ago so it 's up to date . 
  tl ; dr : apparently turkey 's government spent $ 11.4 b on over 3 million syrian refugees , european institutions and states seem to plan to give $ 3b total including past and future aid . 
  http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015148-imam-bayildi you might need to wait until summer . 
  it 's a constant source of depression to be reminded of the things that make you lose hope in the future . 
  edit : one can never be too careful . 
  i deleted my posts above . 
  please do n't claim things without knowing enough about the subject . 
  it was absolutely not the kemalists . 
  https://mgm.gov.tr/?il=istanbul not * too * cold , but not warm either . 
  i know a few people with those names but they might be getting more popular in the last few years . 
  that 's unfortunate , it 's supposed to mean september here !, 
  girls : 1 . 
  miray 5 . 
  eymen 3 . 
  mustafa 4 . 
  ahmet 9 . 
  muhammed from [ here ] ( http://www.nvi.gov.tr/files/file/istatistikler/isimler/2001-2011_en_cok_kullanilan/2015.pdf ) , which has the top 50 . 
  it seems so , yes . 
  something like `` chief '', 
  thanks , i did n't know . . 
  i must have learned it wrong somewhere . 
  the president is also the head of state in turkey, 
  i remembered wrong , it 's a 5 year term and max 2 term limit . 
  the second term would end in 2024 . 
  a third of parliament would need to accuse him of treason and three fourths would have to agree to send him to the supreme court . 
  which is incredibly unlikely to happen . 
  there is a difference between the pm ( generally the leader of the ruling party ) and the president ( supposed to be a neutral overseer ) . 
  the president was chosen by members of the parliament until that was changed to be by popular vote in 2007 . 
  when erdo\u011fan reached the ~ ~ time limit for being pm ~ ~ he got elected president instead so we have him until ~ ~ 2021 ~ ~ 2019 now . 
  it means `` part of '' , as you can see with greenland . 
  [ only sometimes ] ( http://galeri2.uludagsozluk.com/200/metrobus-rar_316292_m.jpg ), 
  most earthquakes are weak , but stronger ones are frequent around here . 
  if you check out the earthquakes near the end of [ this list ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_earthquakes_in_turkey ) you can decide for yourself . 
  i broke my arm in the 1999 one for example, 
  see this is just another problem with the city . 
  we 're supposed to have places to assemble but many of them are no longer empty areas but apartment projects , malls now . 
  there is n't enough green space . 
  also many things are built where they really should n't be ( they could fall into the sea or have landslides ) , or do n't comply with standards . 
  so if there is no problem with your house you might stay but if you feel uncomfortable , or if the house has been destroyed ( and assuming you get out alive ) you 're supposed to go to the meeting area . 
  everyone is * supposed * to have an `` earthquake bag '' ready in their house at all times with supplies but many people do n't bother . 
  in schools kids are taught what to do in which situation if an earthquake strikes . 
  albanians are n't slavic, 
  everyone has different reasons . 
  for me it 's polluted , much too overcrowded ( this is the main problem ) , has pretty bad infrastructure ( road placement , tap water etc ) , ugly outside of historical places , and so on . 
  living here is constant anxiety . 
  also the expected earthquake could happen at any moment . 
  do n't feel too bad , ours asked for `` at least 3 children '' 6 years ago and got no result . 
  at least yours seems to have had a good reason . 
  [ this map is a few years old by now , but that 's not really true .
