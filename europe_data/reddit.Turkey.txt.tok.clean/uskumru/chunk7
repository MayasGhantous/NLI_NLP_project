  i got curious and checked [ the official statistics ] ( http://www.turkstat.gov.tr/pretablo.do?alt_id=1027 ) . 
  looks like turkey 's population is increasing for now but it will start to stabilize/decrease soon , because the fertility rate has been around replacement rate for a decade and it does n't look like it 's going to change . 
  apparently the maximum will be 93 million . 
  but i do n't think they accounted for the refugees , which we have a few million of , who are having incredible amounts of children . 
  good bot, 
  [ here 's all the most popular ones ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/vexillology/search?q=turkey&amp;sort=top&amp;restrict_sr=on ), 
  no , not really . 
  maybe once every year or two .

  if you go back through the years you can see readership has declined . 
  accounting for zaman 's probably inflated numbers ( subtract about 200k ) , in the last 7 years about 25 % of the total have disappeared . 
  * `` a tank can not be stopped by stuffing a shirt in its exhaust pipe '' * the german firm , producer of leopard tanks , announced that their tanks would not be affected by having a shirt stuffed in their exhaust pipes , in their reply to a question sent to their press office . 
  in the answer to the question sent to their press office , the german firm producing leopard tanks also used by turkish armed forces stated that the steering and other functions of their tanks would not be affected by plugging a t-shirt into the pipe . 
  president erdo\u011fan had used the words , `` faith , it was their faith that had rendered the tanks unusable by , forgive me , stuffing the shirts on their backs into the exhaust pipes '' , in his speech in the 15 july remembrance ceremony . 
  the press official of the producers of leopard tanks , krauss-maffei wegmann , said their tanks would not be stopped by stuffing a shirt in the pipe . 
  the firm 's reply is so : ( picture ), 
  he was in an open prison , which have no external security at all , where prisoners judged unlikely to escape are sent . 
  their numbers have not `` rapidly diminished '' , there is no particular group or name to associate such people with , and they do n't live in any particular region . 
  please do some research before accepting your uninformed opinion as fact . 
  lol nah , erdo\u011fan told his supporters to `` fill the blue mosque first '' , it 's not in his interests to change it back from a museum . 
  well , he was after all one of the heads of the cup and a military leader . 
  he did a lot of stuff , some good , some bad . 
  also they may not be aware of it . 
  i mean , there are roads named for hitler , stalin , etc too , around the world . 
  i have never seen or heard of anything named after him . 
  a search on google maps shows 9 streets and 1 park in the entire country . 
  is that `` many '' ? 
  i 'll check the documentary out later if i can find a version with english subtitles . 
  thanks for the source , though as i said , herodotus ' claim does n't hold much water , and another user below could find no mention at the original source . 
  small pieces given by historical sources are indeed relevant in context , but in this case herodotus was incorrect in our context of what turks are , and all we can infer is that at that point in time someone confused the two groups . 
  so , going back to your original point , something does `` point to turks '' , but to present it as a claim that scythians and ottomans were related ... 
   dining norms . 
  sitting down on the floor while eating from a huge plate communaly . 
  clothing . 
  positions like that of a dragoman . 
  dating all the way back to the sultanate of rum . 
  since you have mentioned it several times now , i 'd like to see the source for these dining norms . 
  also , when did the greeks need a position like dragoman in their own state ? 
  do you mean that about greek participation in the ottoman state ? 
   herodotus used the term turk to describe a scythian king . 
  herodotus said a lot of false things . 
  also i searched and could not find a source where he said it . 
  our current knowledge of scythians is rather more accurate than herodotus ' . 
   some say the chinese referred to godturks as turks and generally people related to the saka language . 
  you mean gokturks ? 
  yes , they did . 
  however the saka language is iranic and no matter what the chinese thought at the time , it is unrelated to the turkic family . 
  if you meant the sakha language , that is another matter , but they are unrelated to scythians . 
  sure . 
  but you said `` not at all '' in reply to `` the greeks , widely considered to be a european civilization '' , so that still does n't explain how you got there . 
   middle eastern customs such as ? 
  edit : you still have n't explained the scythians . 
  so your argument is that people ceased to be `` european '' while they were ruled by ottomans ? 
   the greeks , widely considered to be a european civilization . 
  you misunderstood . 
  they were referring to greeks . 
   even in ancient times with the scythians . 
  scythians were an eastern iranic group . 
  they have nothing to do with people living in turkey today . 
   there are records of greeks dining like arabs on the floor . 
  dining `` on the floor '' ( you sit on the floor , the table is elevated ) is not strictly arabic . 
  also , where are these records ? 
  do they imply this was widespread ? 
   every atlas or encyclopedia you can check modern day turkey is included in the middle east . 
  i have seen several where it was n't . 
  also , a country can be included in several areas at once . 
  anyway , scroll up this page and look at the map on the right . 
  this argument has been iterated a thousand times on r/europe . 
  the nihilist government model : you can just reject everything and it will all turn out ok . 
  does n't matter to me . 
  you seem to be looking for a place to spout your dislike . 
  it is irrelevant to the argument . 
  nothing in your post contradicts what he said . 
  http://i.internethaber.com/files/2016/5/23/1595639/1595639_1_14640080131ld8w.jpg this one was . 
  i actually do that sometimes , 
  i think he meant to say turks took 70 % of `` the lands that used to be ethnically greek before the 10th century '' . 
  all of those are in ankara because in the 30s the government wanted to create a new state entirely separate from the associations with the ottomans and if anything were in istanbul that would n't work . 
  honestly that 's a good thing because basically absolutely everything else is in istanbul anyway . 
  no , the elections are not free and fair . 
  that implies a certain definition : that there should be freedom of choice , expression , association , information in the process of elections . 
  even the example you gave proves there are no free and fair elections in turkey . 
  not in villages , not in cities . 
  sure it is . 
  you , as in the us . 
   the us might have to is that a threat edit : why did you change your response ? 
  i 'd like to see you try . 
  you were buddies with him until recently . 
  we remember when you put him on a pedestal , on the cover of time magazine ... his ambitions were always known , but you were ok with it until he started to irritate you . 
  http://www.haberturk.com/gundem/haber/1435905-kemal-kilicdaroglu-suriye-ile-suratle-isbirligi-yapilmali very long , but the relevant paragraph has the heading starting with `` ortado\u011fu politikas\u0131nda '' ... where he essentially recommends reaching an agreement with the syrian government , and criticizes the escalation from safe zone to `` west of euphrates '' then even deeper etc. 
  anyway ,  cyprus will not find peace until the effects of the genocide are reversed , make no mistake . 
  wow . 
  yeah i 'm not replying anymore . 
  no thank you . 
  usa has meddled enough in turkey . 
  the last time you `` covertly backed '' someone we got the 1980 coup and leftists were wiped out in favor of islamism . 
   which issue and when was it settled and how . 
  the cyprus issue , with attempted cleansing of both sides , which led to their coup and then to the invasion , and so on ... now if the army left cyprus the two sides would not try to kill off each other , which is what i would call `` resolved '' . 
   so did the british , why do you accuse them of imperialism when everybody does it , including turkey . 
  mosul did not have a native british population . 
   i never said erdogan did n't throw them in jail .
