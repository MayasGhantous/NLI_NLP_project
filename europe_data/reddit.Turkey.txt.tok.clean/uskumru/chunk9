  but that 's about it . 
  not too rare . 
  google tells me 1 in 25 are blondes . 
  istanbul had a lot of immigration . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.trthaber.com/haber/turkiye/istanbulda-hangi-ilden-kac-kisi-var-167747.html ) you can see how many people originally from each province live in istanbul . 
  ( bin means thousand ) according to that only 2 million are actually from there . 
  also for example 300k people are from ardahan province , 200k of these live in istanbul . 
  there are 7 others in this situation . 
  i could go on but anyway it 's like a mini-turkey , and it has a different culture than the surrounding cities . 
  it has been 40-50 years . 
  chp was shut down and reformed since then , not to mention changing its ideology several times . 
  this always happens when a party is around for so long . 
  also it has been decades since they formed a government . 
  they are different things then and now , and i do n't even support them . 
  i mean , what 's the point if you 're going to half-ass it ? 
  it 's a joke , there are frequently `` series '' in here where someone posts something interesting about their country and then we get 50 of the same for other countries filling the subreddit . 
  this time it was about presidential offices , so this is referencing that . 
  [ reference ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkhpe-onogy ), 
  when i was little i thought eminem was turkish because it means `` my emine . '', 
  [ could have been worse . 
  there are many reasons , education is a very important one ( an akp politician once said , `` as education levels go up our vote levels go down '' , and many surveys have shown this , also you ca n't expect people who were educated only 5 years to care about the things you listed ) but extreme media pressure is also very effective . 
  however there is one thing very important to turkish people and that is money . 
  if these people would suffer financial problems and think erdo\u011fan was the reason he would n't survive the next election . 
  of course this is what media control is for , so they accuse everyone but akp of their problems . 
   the results were not about pro or anti erdogan it kind of was , though , do you think as many people would have said yes if the president would be binali ? 
  for the rest , sure , but not enough people voted with their brain . 
  i would n't be so disappointed if every vote had even 30 minutes of actual critical thinking behind it even if it would result in 80 % yes . 
  also it was n't `` doing nothing '' , surely there 's a reason behind bah\u00e7eli 's actions . 
  they got progressively more suspicious but i do n't think the results involved enough fraud to affect results until recently . 
  you talk as if the opposition is a tiny group when you should know well that the referendum ( and all elections in the past few years ) went 50-50 . 
  the second g is silent though, 
   the turks would not let there be a cross on this building even for a moment and then  i 'm not talking about a cross, 
  in language maps , minorities are almost always over-represented to make them visible . 
  turks in bulgaria have been there for centuries though . 
   desert theme really ? 
  i understand that you feel attacked and sorry if you took offense but i do n't have an agenda and i 'm not trying to twist anything , just saying a fair number of kurds have voted in the past in support of non-nationalist ideas , and you yourself agreed with that, 
  calm down and do n't assume every person with turkish flair shares the opinions you have heard before . 
  to be honest i do n't see the problem with your first point . 
  i am also choosing the lesser of 4 evils when i vote for chp , and despite not sharing many of their views , that means i support them . 
  after all a vote is a vote . 
  also those are your observations , i have my own , someone else sees something else , and so on . 
  though not as many as before i see many kurds who still support erdo\u011fan , they ca n't be discounted now or then . 
  nowhere did i shift blame for anything . 
  51 % of the country persistently votes for erdo\u011fan 's side , and 100 % has to live with it . 
  and i would n't call anyone backward when more specific words do the job better , in fact it is wrong to call people backward imo . 
  that might have had an effect in for example antalya but it 's not such a big factor in general , it 's more important in its contribution to the general economy imo . 
  i did n't say erdogan , i said akp , who got slightly better results there until a few years ago , and even according to your map they have sizeable support . 
  but there is in an authoritarian regime . 
  the differences between authoritarianism and totalitarianism are important . 
  ( do n't have time to explain but i 'm sure you know . ), 
  who even knows ? 
  what matters is the government will go with the result most favorable to them , which is probably the one served by aa . 
  a little but not exactly , it 's very complicated . 
  for example bursa ( blue ) is much more `` urban '' than u\u015fak or denizli ( both red ) . 
  it 's a combination of many factors , mostly education , richness , internal migration , development , and to some extent urban/rural divide . 
  however it 's sometimes a matter of profit , for example the towns on the black sea are not undeveloped , but they profit comparatively more from akp . 
  in the east recently the kurds have really been snubbed but earlier they also were supporters of akp so that 's the reverse situation . 
  also , of course , the effect of propaganda . 
  source : [ yeni \u015eafak ] ( http://www.yenisafak.com/secim-referandum-2017/secim-sonuclari ) which used [ aa ] ( http://aa.com.tr/en ) data edit : you can click on specific provinces , and from there specific municipalities . 
  for external results , click `` d\u00fcnya '' . 
  also , sorry for linking yeni \u015eafak , but they had the best interface . 
  around 10-11 or 2-3 , as far as i saw . 
  useless as long as the uncles in sivas voted yes . 
  what matters is quantity , not quality . 
  for your second point : it also started 1 hour earlier , which i think is weird but makes some amount of sense as they are east and the sun rises earlier . 
  ankara is red now too . 
  none of your business , 
  we use kilim as the word for a traditional sort of thin carpet , it 's a very common word . 
  once every few years it gets hot enough that i have difficulty sleeping , and this is one of those years . 
  this summer has had several incidences of abnormal weather here . 
  to be honest there is n't really very much you can do in temperatures over 30c and humidity over 80 % . 
  the first strategy is an air conditioner but if you do n't have that . . 
  it is best to avoid the sun and to stay indoors from 8 to 19 , and to swim if possible ( absolutely not from 10 to 15 though ! ) . 
  sunscreen is very important for outside . 
  actually , clothes might be better if they 're loose rather than short . 
  cold showers can help . 
  ice cream is useless after a certain point where it melts too fast for you to enjoy . 
  when driving through greece we noticed some place names like `` new x '' , i assume people who went with the population exchanges wanted to keep their old city names . 
  i 'd say the disliked group of this time are the syrian refugees . 
  about your edit 3 , there 's also `` almanlar yenilince biz de yenilmi\u015f say\u0131ld\u0131k '' ( when the germans were defeated we also counted as defeated ) in a similar vein , which some people use in situations where someone tries to deflect blame . 
  edit : i can think of quite a lot of these about gypsies and arabs actually , way too many to list . 
  also , `` to stay french to something '' : to be out of the loop, 
  all vegetables and some fruits ( tomato , plum etc ) can be pickled here . 
  they are generally eaten as a side dish , mostly in winter . 
  when people eat rice and beans , 90 % of the time they will also eat pickles . 
  they are generally sold in large containers at the pazar , or bought from a pickler , or made at home . 
  pickle juice is also available , it 's very salty and sour and spicy , and tastes much better than you 're thinking right now . 
  also in the black sea area they have a sort of fried pickle meal ( tur\u015fu kavurma ) and while i like it , it is . . divisive . 
  meat is not pickled but fish can be , if you count lakerda . 
  it is only made from palamut or torik fish . 
  [ you ca n't support a business ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/2d5gow/kolarov_teaching_chambers_a_thing_or_two/cjm8ti1/ ), 
  yes . 
  `` u\u00e7 , u\u00e7 , b\u00f6ce\u011fim / annem sana terlik pabu\u00e7 alacak '' , meaning `` fly , fly , my bug / my mother will buy slippers and shoes for you '' . 
  simple . 
  uskumru means mackerel and it 's my favorite food . 
  i even received it as a birthday present once . 
  its sole competitor is the palamut but that was taken anyway . 
  even in a scenario where we met all the criteria and had no external or internal problems , i would oppose it . 
  due to the structure of the eu , a country has more decision power if they have more population , and by then turkey 's population would be more than germany 's . 
  i think you can see the issue here .
