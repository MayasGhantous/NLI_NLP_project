not just two now is it uk ? 
  just need to look up where it is . 
  [ moustache ? 
  ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=h_ekxnpvapa ), 
  whats with the circlejerk in this tread ? 
  turkey is homophobic yes thats nothing new . 
  the most homophobic in europe ? 
  probably not , some eastern european country is probably more homophobic . 
  other than that all the other claims are clear bullshit . 
  the circlejerk must continue . 
  i looked it up and found why i never heard of it . 
  they are known as pirate taxis here and doing it is illegal . 
  what is \u00fcber ? 
  we are genetically closer to armenians , central/south italians , crete etc. 
  then to mainland greece tbh . 
  so if y-dna is telling us about our paternal heritage , does mt-dna tell us about our maternal heritage ? 
  since we get our mitochondria from our mothers if i 'm not mistaken . 
  in turkey we still call greeks that are living outside of greece `` rum `` s. because thats what they called themselves . 
  this ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/japan\u2013turkey_relations#history there is also a film about it ; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3512072/, 
  they can do whatever they want with them after they buy them . 
  this way they 'll starve to death by their own doing :d, 
  you did n't let us keep it . 
  we have it because of [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgni_ktkytg ) . 
  yup because danger is imminent when 10 people out of 40 million tourists dies from terror attack . 
  oh wait your chance to die from plane crash is higher you better stay at home its too dangerous outside . 
  thanks for opening my eyes . 
  and you are wishing that innocent people die . 
  evet , it 's a local favorite . 
  in turkish its called et meaning meat . 
  now make a map that shows the countries that controlled europe . 
  start with turkey , 
  i like his [ eurovision song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5khc8o91jfu ) . 
  here 's [ greece in 2 minutes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et5dpw_sso0 ), 
  why is this man bashing kurds ? 
  not blamed , those were done by pkk . 
  italian is a fun language to learn , 
  - bilmek does n't have an alternative such as - b\u0131lmak so no . 
  do n't you mean \u00c7al\u0131\u015ft\u0131r\u0131labilirlerde = those available for work as well or \u00c7al\u0131\u015ft\u0131r\u0131labilirlerinde = of those available for work as well or \u00c7al\u0131\u015ft\u0131r\u0131labilirlerdende = from those available for work as well should n't the last `` de '' be written separately ? 
  [ turkic :o] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bulgars ), 
  y\u0131lmaz is popular [ outside of turkey ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr5b7fs1nrs&amp;index=1&amp;list=pl1wqluc7ptze4ienhnenfgnmsnqlw1ift ) too . 
  bulgar was a turkic tribe . 
  how dare you call yourselves bulgars !, 
  from now on you shall be known as the former ottoman province of eastern rumelia !, 
  or foper for short . 
  is there a timelapse of this ? 
  i was expecting that but i still do n't understand why this got downvoted so much while being accurate to the title yet the joke navy posts are considered higher quality than this . 
  anyway i deleted the post . 
  i did n't realize some people were still butthurt over this . 
  they really should n't . 
  edit : yup someones pissed off alright :d, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ottoman_minelayer_nusret https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/naval_operations_in_the_dardanelles_campaign#battle_of_march_18 after this loss a land campaign in gallipoli gained support as an alternative . 
  on 25 april , the allied army launched the gallipoli campaign and we all know how that ended . 
  edit : why am i getting downvoted ? 
  this is just a fun trivia about a little ship doing big things . 
  i closed my vpn to check , nope reddit is n't banned , but imgur is . 
  isis also denied that they did the previous bombing where more than 100 people died in ankara . 
  ypg admitting that they did it would be a very stupid move to be honest . 
  you mean assimilating ? 
  if the ottoman empire did what you described there would only be turks in the balkans now . 
  people tend to only realize the negative things they hear and people with negative thoughts are usually ones to voice it . 
  this does n't make those the common opinion . 
  anyone that speaks turkish and says `` i am a turk '' is a turk , anyone opposing this is a retard and you should stop talking to them . 
  there is no genetics or science to this . 
  people are more likely to hear from cypriots on the internet rather than speaking to them directly so this also gives a negative look to them because like yourself the ones on the internet stating their opinion are the ones that have negative thoughts about turkey . 
  stop being paranoid you 're contributing to the hate . 
  never heard of any one complain that northern cyprus is non-muslim or non turkish or too westernized . 
  i have heard northern cypriots complain more than once tho so they are seen as ungrateful . 
  most people do n't talk about northern cyprus or know whats going on there to know such things . 
  you are full of yourself . 
  if you look very closely you can see that it is still blue at that time . 
  it changes colour around 1430 which is still incorrect tho . 
  there are so many ignorant commenters in this tread . 
  this situation is nothing like australia as you guys like to indicate . 
  there are no international waters between turkey and greece . 
  you ca n't send the refugees back to where they came from , you are obligated to take them because of international law . 
  turkey on the other hand has no legal obligation to take in these refugees unlike europe . 
  turkey only agreed to take european refugees in but by good will does n't turn back the syrians . 
  europe has been demanding that we keep the eastern border open while themselves take no responsibility . 
  we have absolutely no reason to keep these people . 
  the only way these refugees will stop coming is if you make life hell to them ( which the humanitarians in europe will not allow ) or make a deal with turkey to stop more of them before they leave which brings us to this tread . 
  and no you ca n't bumper them back , they sink their own boats as soon as they see the greek coast guard so they are taken in to not let them drown . 
  9 billion ? 
  we 're still waiting for the 3 billion . 
  hdp is a pro kurdish party with close ties to the pkk as he makes it even more clear with his recent speeches . 
  he does n't represent the majority of the people of turkey and most people actually hate them . 
  it shows your disgusting mindset . 
  this is something you have seen so much that it 's nothing out of ordinary anymore . 
  those are words [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbfjblihwja ) is reality . 
  we have already seen what happens during `` peace '' . 
  pkk used it to stock up on weapons . 
  its too late for `` peace '' now , too late for your `` progressive '' terrorists . 
  if you think it does n't mention pkk you clearly do not have a clue what is written there . 
  they are basically saying the military is n't fighting pkk they are only there to make the civilians suffer . 
  they are acting like the things done by pkk are actually done by the police and military . 
  it has been signed by a pkk supporting minority . 
  in no way or form they represent the majority of academics in turkey . 
  the biggest reason why erdo\u011fan is still in office is because he has no real opposition . 
  all of them are incompetent with no charisma . 
  the only way erdo\u011fan will go will be by a strong leader stealing some of his votes . 
  but i 'm not sure if you would like the new leader as he would be elected by the same people who elected erdo\u011fan .
