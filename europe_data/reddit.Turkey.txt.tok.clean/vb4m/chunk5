  the article does n't say anything about greek tanks . 
  from my other comment `` the only modern tanks greece has are 170 leopard 2a6 's . 
  the rest of the tanks of greece are just as old as turkey 's . '', 
  turkey also as more number of tanks and a bigger gdp to keep them operational . 
  i think artillery and aircraft would be decisive in that case . 
  but lets be real here if turkey directly attacked greece as the aggressor it would mean attacking europe as a whole . 
  greece does n't even needs to have an army they just need to stall enough for france to save them . 
  i do n't think it will escalate to that level unless ww3 happens . 
  if we are comparing with greece here the only modern tanks greece has are 170 leopard 2a6 's which can be taken down with atm 's or other tanks . 
  the rest of the tanks of greece are just as old as turkey 's . 
  our tanks do need upgrade and thats why we are building a new tank . 
  actually most of the weapon systems are being upgraded nowadays . 
  tf-x jet program to go with f35 , new rifles for the army and sof , armored vehicles , ships , new missiles , aircraft carrier etc. 
  are being built . 
  i 'm talking about modern atms and thats what i wrote . 
  for example a kornet not a random rpg . 
  syria is full of them . 
  there is not a single tank in the world that can take a direct hit from a modern anti tank missile and stay operational , so whats the point ? 
  the new altay tanks will have hard kill active protection systems to stop the missiles in mid air but until then the tank crew survived most hits from atms in syria so to me the tanks are actually doing a decent job . 
  wine is \u015farap , i think you mean serap ( means mirage ) . 
  thats what i 'm saying , he is either trying to look like that or a clueless european turk that thinks turkey is as powerful as us and russia ( you need to be a special kind of retard for that ) . 
  he clearly does n't know how to write in turkish , he is just guessing how to write the words . 
  most likely not even turkish or not a turk from turkey . 
  the gramatical errors and the things he is writing suggest either he is a european trying to make turks look like idiots or just a clueless european turk . 
  kaffir ( actually kafir ) is something you would hear from an arab not a turk . 
  how does tsch or ch make the sound they represent ? 
  it is a different sound . 
  in the turkish alphabet sh does n't make the \u015f sound on the other hand ing is the combination of the i n and g sounds . 
  even though ing is n't a word in turkish for example everyone would read it the same way since every seperate sound is represented with a seperate letter . 
  taf is trying to keep the soldier and civilian casualty as low as possible , trying to evacuate the civilians first and soften the defense by bombing the area for some time before entering . 
  about half of al bab is cleared by fsa , street battles and mine clearing is still going on . 
  the problem with fighting in syria is that it 's completely full of anti tank missiles and isis likes to use vbieds a lot . 
  tanks therefore are n't very effective and you ca n't steamroll the place as everywhere has been trapped with mines and ieds by now . 
  the low number of fsa fighters is n't helping either . 
  edit : tfsa captured all of al-bab along with qabasin and bzaa . 
  thats not how wars work . 
  just look at vietnam war . 
  it 's actually harder to beat irregular militia than to beat a similar sized regular army . 
  especially terrorists like isis as they do n't care about war crimes . 
  almost all of the casualties taken in syria by the turkish army are from suicide attacks . 
  syria before the war had one of the most number of tanks in the world yet they got crushed by those `` poorly trained militia '' . 
  even now with a lot of russian support they still lost palmyra and all the tanks and weapons within it . 
  also it 's mostly fsa with some turkish sof , armor and air support not an operation done by the army completely . 
  i believe they came from africa like everybody else . 
  those were from saudi arabia and uae . 
  france has semi-presidential , south korea has presidential system . 
  we have parliamentary but de facto semi-presidential system right now . 
  it 's a good thing they do n't react . 
  if european media started supporting `` no '' , the `` yes '' votes would increase here as a reaction . 
  damn it melih you 're making it into world news now how are we going to explain this shit . 
  yes guys it 's the same mayor as all the other times . 
  we have a lot of different words to say thank you , te\u015fekk\u00fcrler , eyvallah etc. 
  i mostly use sa\u011fol for example . 
  azerbaijanis live in northern iran these maps are showing that not persian . 
  in turkish rooster goes '' \u00fc-\u00fcr\u00fc-\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc '' and the dog goes `` hav hav '' . 
  i read that as `` as in mee-m , or as in meh-meh ? '', 
  for some reason . 
  turkish cows say `` m\u00f6\u00f6\u00f6 '' . 
  they communicate with their pseudopodia . 
  whats up with lebanon ? 
  everything is 99 % to 1 % after page 32 .

  i 'm pretty sure most internet users know this in turkey already since sites like youtube , facebook , twitter have been blocked a couple of times now . 
  reddit is n't blocked but imgur is so you have to use vpn here too . 
  it would n't effect me much . 
  my vpn is open 24/7 at this point . 
  it bypasses the internet bottleneck too so the internet does n't slow down when a bomb explodes . 
  explain all the grammar nazi 's then . 
  there is a huge lighting difference there . 
  the footballers are under large spotlights while the spectators are in the shade . 
  yea i understood the bane reference . 
  i was expecting him to fix his mistake and put some anchovy pictures instead of some random fish . 
  so you have larger than sardine size anchovies ? 
  thats some russian type shit right there . 
  large but tasteless . 
  it 's very weird , in the `` what do you feel most about ? '', 
  question `` the world '' got 45 % and `` europe '' got 27 % while `` your country '' got 15 % . 
  it really does n't make sense . 
  since when did one of most nationalistic countries became so concerned about the world and even europe more that their country . 
  those are some huge anchovies . 
  [ well ... ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/2qjohv/what_did_your_parents_show_you_to_do_that_you/cn6pn30/ ), 
  http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=amk in turkey it 's used like an exclamation mark . 
  i 'm not sure being mostly ready is a good enough excuse . 
  when you combine that with the problem of some countries lying about their situation ( e.g. 
  economic ) you have a big problem . 
  that did n't end so well for greece after all . 
  similarly turkey has completed all the criteria other than the anti-terror law to get visa free travel , might as well ? 
  is that how it works ? 
  i agree that you need to meet the criteria to join the eu and we have n't but it 's interesting that this did n't stop romania , bulgaria or greece from joining the eu do n't you think ? 
  good thing it was n't a car bomb or anything . 
  i would get irritated if some random person keeps calling me man to say something to me instead of sir . 
  i do n't get the `` do n't call us bayan , call us kad\u0131n '' thing . 
  bayan is a more elegant word . 
  the only thing i can think of is that bayan contains `` bay '' in it which is the male version of it . 
  its like saying do n't call us woman because it contains man in it . 
  all the `` woman '' toilets were crossed out in one of the faculties in our university and kad\u0131n were written on it . 
  feminists are quite weird . 
  it used to snow a lot more in ankara . 
  nowadays it rains just before snowing so you ca n't even play with it .
