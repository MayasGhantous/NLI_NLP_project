  not all wars are won with bombs . 
  you 're missing alot then peshmarga is army of iraqi kurdistan an ally of turkey . 
  the pyd has started a huge media campaign to paint turkey as enemies of kurds while we just hate the ones who terrorize our nation . 
  iraqi kurds are not terrorists they are friendly to everybody in the region and they even dislike pyd/pkk for ruining the reputation of kurds ... http://rudaw.net/english/kurdistan/14112013 http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-turkey-iraq-iduskcn0j60b720141122, 
  lol the map you posted actually proves you wrong ... 
   http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/02/04/erdogans-foreign-policy-is-in-ruins/ dude how many times will you post this article ? 
  i am starting to think that you 're the author . 
   what do you mean not different ? 
  the coalition bombings in iraq did help push back isis which would have not been possible without turkey 's cooperation . 
  all airstrikes are done from incirlik airbase  both by peshmerga which are trained by turkey . 
  [ commies ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/revolutionary_people%27s_liberation_party/front ) . 
  not really even kurds themselves agree with this pyd was founded by pkk to expand their operations to syria and ypg is basically pyd 's military ring which half of their fighters are actually turkish kurds from pkk not syrian . 
  they 're not `` loosely '' linked they 're literally full-fledged allies that have free access to each other assets and the members of the umbrella organization pkk also founded named [ kck ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/group_of_communities_in_kurdistan ) . 
  the only reason usa being hypocritical and denying this is to try to give the illusion of they 're not supporting a terrorist organization in a nato nation . 
  otherwise everybody informed knows pyd is just syrian wing of pkk just as how pjak is the iranian wing . 
  everybody is fighting everybody in syria . 
  jokes aside turkey normally only fights pkk , isis and dhkp/c but for the first time turkey seriously attacked syrian goverment and pyd . 
  [ can poland finally into space ?!, 
   this is a military campaign against the syrian assyrians you 're mad i do n't even know how to comment to that accusation . 
  this is simply the most ridiclous accusation i have heard since the syria civil war has started ...  whose biggest militia is the mfs and is aligned to ypg and sdf . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/syriac_military_council 2.000 men is biggest ? 
  sure bro whatever flooats your boat . 
   the other assyrian christians , who are aligned to assad , are also anti-turkey and have been harrassed by jihadists supported by turkey . 
  remember idlib where christians were abducted after turkish supported rebels captured the city ? 
  i 'm sure they 're harassed because they 're assyrian christians . 
  sure dude hook me up with whatever you 're drinking/smoking it seems like good stuff . 
   turkey is definitely pro isil and is using isil to attack syrians . 
  tell me , why does turkey launch an anti isil operation but then attacks syrian kurds ? 
  because we launched anti-pkk/pyd operation not isis ? 
  it 's russia that said they would fight with isis but focused on rebels not turkey . 
  turkey said they would hit pyd if they pass certain redlines and they did hence they 're bombed . 
   the terrorist supported erdogan and his army also have started attacking the syrian government 's troops just a half hour ago . 
  good it was long overdue . 
  instead of supporting pathetic rebels we should have gone in ourselves . 
  erdogan pulled us in to this deep shit if we do n't act ourselves we 'll end up at the pointy end of the knife . 
   this isnt about pkk or its affaliates , this is pure about turkey wanting to kill kurds under the pretext of fighting isil . 
  yes because we ran out of kurds to kill in turkey if you have any kurds i 'm buying pm me . 
   tell me , where was the so called turkish action against isil of last lsummer ? 
  only pkk was targeted .

  lol wtf is that title ? 
  it does n't look much cold this time . 
   no of course , we all know city blocks level themselves magically alone / s he 's wrong artilary was used but only on confirmed targets . 
  not on entire neighborhood . 
   and when the fridge run out ? 
  when you got to grab money to fill it ? 
  the security forces give out food and water to civilians that still live in operation sites . 
   you hear the noise all you know is your brains tells you `` move , or die . '', 
  and you moved halfway before realizing ( granted some will freeze instead ) i think what he meant was there is no way civilians can create a such an underground tunnel network in the middle of the operations and without necessary tools . 
  it 's obivious to me that tunnels has been dig before the operations has begun just like trenches by pkk so they can move inside the city without going outside . 
  well about that : http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/video-shows-kurds-waving-white-flag-shot-by-turkish-soldiers-a6828416.html kind of does n't encourage it does n't it ? 
  or where they terrorists too on that video ? 
  lol did you even watch the video even r/worldnews did n't believe that and that should tell you something since most people there hate turkey . 
  dude you definitely not even watched the video please do and tell me with a straight face that it 's not conveniently edited to leave out the real perpetrator from being seen and in the second video you hear ak sounds security forces do n't use aks . 
   both reported dozens of death , the question being whether they were pkk ( yps ? ), 
  or civilians hiding and actual numbers pro-pkk news sites always claims that pkk deaths are civilian deaths . 
  they used that claim so many times that they lost their credibility . 
  in fact according to them security forces did n't kill a single pkk terrorist ... 
   so ... you gon na team up with saudi arabia and turkey and go to war with putin and iran then ? 
  they already are . 
  eu is part of `` assad must go '' group . 
  you guys should stop acting like eu is innocent in all of this . 
  nato went in to this together ... 
   to my point of view , you stop a problem at its origin . 
  this means , at syria or syrian-turkish borders . 
  well eu literally asked turkey to open their borders to the new batch of refugees from aleppo so they cleary do n't plan to do that . 
  turkey does n't indiscriminately shell the operation sites if they did the operation would n't take this long . 
  where the hell did you read/heard that ridiclous explanation ? 
  the building had a huge underground network that linking it to dozens of houses in cizre it was an pkk base not some random house civilians used to hide . 
  civilians do n't carry aks ... 
  security forces called the 60-30 pkk terrorists in the building to surrender they did n't . 
  it 's their fault for thinking they can fight against actual soldiers . 
  pkk/hdp always does remarks like this when they take a huge blow . 
  also if there were really actual wounded civilians in the buildings basement they would n't have fired on the ambulances . 
  lol at least read the link you gave instead of making yourself look like a complete fool . 
   `` the 16-year-old one is terrific . '' you do n't even need to leave europe to get off with a 16 year i guess europe is run by pedos by your logic . 
  also the man got arrested so clearly illegal prostitution is not something turkey takes kindly on . 
  thinking before writing or saying something would get you a lot further in the life mate you should try it sometimes . 
  what the hell are you talking about ? 
  try marrying an 10 year old in istanbul and you 'll get yourself a ticket to jail . 
  that shit only happens in remote villages with not law enforcers exist and with only illegal imam marriages . 
  turkey has a higher age of consent ( 18 ) than entire europe get of your high horse . 
   they were n't designated as a terrorist group before the syrian war when they were n't useful to the west . 
  that 's because turkey did n't do such request for pyd to this date and there was a truce back then . 
  western countries wo n't designate some organization that has zero affect to them without a valid request . 
   and they wo n't be after because while they may be close to the pkk , they are n't literally the pkk . 
  they actually are . 
  they are similar to al-nusra . 
  it 's literally founded by pkk , filled with pkk and works together with pkk . 
  it 's ridiclous to claim that pyd is merely close with pkk and share the same ideology . 
  pyd is n't just syrian kurds that respect pkk and follow their path . 
  pyd is basically pkk 's attempt to expand their organization to syria . 
   only if they start properly fucking with turkey will they get designated as that . 
  they already do . 
  they gave their [ full support ] ( https://twitter.com/drpartizan_/status/697413033539334144?s=09 ) for pkk . 
  the german weapons that even turkey does n't have access to are used by pkk those obviously did n't come from germany herself and considering the fact that pkk uses the rojava border to escape from the turkish military i 'll say they 're pretty much fucking with turkey . 
   also after isis is gone there will be groups like al-nursa to deal with and then i imagine the west will try and turn the pyd against assad . 
  al-nusra will be gone before isis . 
  there is a reason why russia and assad focus on islamist rebels instead of isis because sadly those organizations actually get some support from legit countries compared to isis so they 're seen as much bigger threat . 
   i imagine the west will try and turn the pyd against assad .
