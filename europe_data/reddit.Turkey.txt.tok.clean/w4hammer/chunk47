  there is no way erdogan does n't have indisputable proof of gulen 's involvement because they used to be allies . 
  i heard literally 85 boxes of evidence is being send to usa . 
  gulen is also seem to be getting desperate . 
  i wonder how much cash he paid to new york times [ to write his own article on their front page ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/26/opinion/fethullah-gulen-i-condemn-all-threats-to-turkeys-democracy.html ), 
  usa 's response the formal extradition request when it 's made will decide the turkey 's relations with usa in years to come . 
  fingers are crossed this is different than just supporting ypg that might one day pose us a threat . 
  usa would literally be playing pakistan after 9/11 if they refuse to give gulen . 
  also turkey had arrest warrant for gulen for years . 
  first back in late 90s when he ran to usa and cia gave him a green card then when erdogan-gulen alliance broke up . 
   we do n't want this http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36973314 to happen with kurds or anyone else here . 
  what kind of retarded argument is that ? 
  if you 're serious foreign minister 's comment is literally on point . 
   akp sheeps smashed some shops and marked possible kurdish and g\u00fclen houses in vienna . 
  this is not turkey . 
  that is why they say this . 
  source ? 
  did something happen to turks in austria that i missed ? 
  why is he randomly saying this ? 
  you could n't when it was airing . 
  poor kid . 
  sadly our police does n't really care much about the syrians . 
  do n't expect to get any protection in turkey as a refugee . 
  if he was a tourist police would have acted differently ... 
  i bet this gang who did these stuff to him knows this and purposefully target syrians . 
  i do not see what 's really wrong with this sentence . 
  did he scream allahu akbar ? 
  as far as i know no ... police is supposed to investigate and find the truth not just give the most possible motive as a fact . 
  mostly but since ypg became the official ground army of the west against isis . 
  the weapons given to them ends up at pkk 's hands as well . 
  some peshmerga soldiers also apparently sell their german made weapons in the black market for shit load of cash . 
  even our refugees are not exactly refugees . 
  [ in eid a good chunk of them went back to syria to visit their relatives ] ( http://www.dailysabah.com/nation/2016/07/01/syrian-refugees-return-to-syria-to-mark-muslim-holiday ) . 
  like wtf ? 
  if your home is safe enough to leave your relatives you 're no refugee . 
  i said the [ same thing ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4vxzf3/greece_urges_eu_to_comes_up_with_plan_b_for/d62xe6q?context=3 ) yesterday and people downvoted me : /, 
  well how about you give those islands to us then we 'll make those islands camps and take the backlash for you ? 
  plan b is throwing greece under the bus i guess and hoping that refugees would eventually go back after they realize that the farthest europe they 'll reach is greece . 
  no way any eu country will accept the increase in migrant quotas once the migrant road reopens since it looks like we 'll ditch the deal . 
   the problem is the submitted evidence is hearsay and speculation gained by torture . 
  it is n't legally admissible or binding in a us court for an extradition hearing . 
  did you see the evidence yourself ? 
  we do n't know what 's submitted yet erdogan and gulen used to be buddies i 'm sure he can tie the coup plotter generals to him . 
   they 'd need a literal recording of gulen giving orders . 
  well we have him giving orders to his followers to infiltrate in to turkey and wait for the `` time '' from 1999 here 's the english translation . 
   you must move in the arteries of the system without anyone noticing your existence until you reach all the power centers . 
  until the conditions are ripe , they [ the followers ] must continue like this . 
  if they do something prematurely , the world will crush our heads , and muslims will suffer everywhere , like in the tragedies in algeria , like in 1982 [ in ] syria , . 
  like in the yearly disasters and tragedies in egypt . 
  the time is not yet right . 
  you must wait for the time when you are complete and conditions are ripe , until we can shoulder the entire world and carry it . 
  you must wait until such time as you have gotten all the state power , until you have brought to your side all the power of the constitutional institutions in turkey . 
  now , i have expressed my feelings and thoughts to you all -- in confidence . 
  trusting your loyalty and secrecy . 
  i know that when you leave here , [ just ] as you discard your empty juice boxes , you must discard the thoughts and the feelings that i expressed here . 
  well now that i wrote this comment i did i little search i found [ this ] ( http://www.city-journal.org/html/who-fethullah-g%c3%bclen-13504.html ) . 
  only article about him that explains everything with from several points of views however it 's outdated still no recent articles about him . 
  claire berlinski seems to know what she 's talking about . 
  here 's [ her insight about the coup ] ( http://www.city-journal.org/html/who-planned-turkeys-coup-14656.html ) . 
  edit : [ another very good article ] ( https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/turkey/2016-08-02/roots-gulenist-power-turkey?cid=soc-tw-rdr ) but it has a soft paywall . 
  here 's also a [ video source ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqrn540zvf0 ) for people who do n't want to read however the video goes a bit tin-foily . 
  i mean you guys think erdogan is bad ? 
  check gulen out ... 
  this is my beef with western media . 
  there are billions of articles about the coup not one explaining people who or what gulen is properly and why most turks are not filling the streets protesting the purges . 
  i mean you can deny his involvement all you want but at least explain who the main suspect is . 
  whether us taking the gulen 's side or not will be decided if they refuse to extradite gulen with the submitted evidence . 
  this is the most ironic article on the guardian i have ever seen . 
  regardless anybody who follows western media like me from outside can see the massive bias in it . 
  eh everybody knows wtf is going on in turkey and with western media 's extremely shitty reporting and articles about it , i would have been surprised if we were n't the least popular . 
  when russia was on the spot we they would have been the least popular as well . 
  also why even ask to norway ? 
  lol ... 
  it is ... 
  turkey is a funny country when you 're no living in it ... 
  still i prefer to be on the front page with news like this instead of more grim stuff . 
  i believe if those happened we would have heard about it by now . 
  things we know however is they 're stripped and made lay on the floor for long hours with their hands tied from the back and they 're made to stare on erdogan 's face . 
  i love how when catholics finally get a pope that understand christianity people start declaring him a false one . 
  same in turkey . 
  fucking hate that shit ... 
   i also find it kind of ironic that turkey baselessly accuses us to `` support gullen '' ( which is blatantly false and ridiculous ) then imitate gullen and act identically in germany starting it 's own parrallele `` turkish network '' and giant `` protests '' in an european country . 
  he accused usa of supporting gulen because they refused to extradite him not the europe he accusing europe of supporting terrorism for harboring pkk terrorists . 
  it 's a separate matter from gulen . 
   he also said turkey had sent germany more than 4,000 files on what he said were wanted terrorists , but the country did nothing . 
  good idea i for one welcome the turkish republic of greece . 
  it would n't even take 50 years to take control of entire greek government and do a referendum to join turkey . 
  since there are more turks in istanbul than entire greek population in greece . 
  seems like nobody here read the article at all . 
  % 90 of the article is about usa not germany . 
  germany has no experience nor the influence over any foreign country 's military to even manage to orchestrate a coup . 
  europe is known for their human rights , economy and high living standards o not from their ruthless intelligence agencies . 
  you would have fucked up even worse than gulen if you tried to orchestrate a coup outside of your own nation . 
  well there 's no chance that they 'll get death penalty . 
  do n't know about torture however . 
  it seems like every arrested coup soldier have some light scars on their faces and their hands really looks like left tied for a long time . 
  seems like they 're giving the soldiers `` turkish punishment '' instead of time in jail they 're getting some punches and humiliations . 
  too bad germany is n't fascist anymore huh ? 
   turkey would be allowed to join . 
  what does he means by that exactly ? 
  does he mean if we join or if we `` allowed '' to join .
