well , at least it 's a mosque in europe which wo n't preach wahhabism ( aka islamic extremism ) . 
  you can be sure about that . 
  no shit . 
  i also wonder how many al-nusra , ahrar al-sham , isis etc. 
  militants leak into the europe . 
   government welfare ~ ~ and the prospect of working in decent jobs . ~ ~ fixed . 
   some migrants said they were forced to seek a better life in europe due to the low quality of life they experienced in turkey , adding they waited for days at the istanbul bus terminal hoping to travel to edirne by bus . 
  well if istanbul 's quality of life is low for you , you can go back to your precious war-torn country anytime . 
  can someone explain that '' +50 bonus seat '' thing ? 
  islamism is a disease that destroys everything which is n't related to it . 
  everyone who want to live freely and not to be forced to live according to some book which written 1400 years ago , should oppose it . 
  those `` refugees '' wear better than me . 
  his critique on secularists is nothing more than bullshit . 
  firstly he thinks secularists have opposed against erdo\u011fan from day one just because he 's conservative , it 's not . 
  he skips everything tayyip did or said between 1994-2002 . 
  he do n't mention the quotes like `` democracy is like a train . 
  we shall get out when we arrive at the station we want . 
  '' , `` i will wear clothes of a priest if my commanders order '' , `` i am the imam of the city ( when he became mayor of \u0130stanbul ) '' , '' [ democracy is a tool , not a goal ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oq-zqn8-wf0 ) '' etc. 
  you 're in turkey , the man who said those quotes won the elections with two-third majority in the parliament , what would you feel and what would you do ? 
  he thinks tayyip suddenly changed after 2011 elections . 
  that 's not true . 
  tayyip has always been the same . 
  they actually convinced people that they 're `` reformist conservatives '' . 
  they had to seem like that , otherwise they 'll be closed by juridiction for the crime of dealing secularism . 
  they started to staffing in state institutions since day one . 
  their first target was police department , the last one was the juridiction via 2010 constitution referendum . 
  after he gained the control of almost every not-anymore-neutral state institutions , he started to show what he really is . 
  he thinks secularists hate liberals and see them as useful idiots . 
  it 's true . 
  i remember when she supported ergenekon & balyoz trials and made fun of journalists who have been arrested for being member of those so-called organisations . 
  even blaming everything on chp could n't save you from tayyip 's justice frederike , eh ? 
  chp as always . 
  just nothing . 
  i do n't think it will end in a short time . 
  whoever wins the civil war in syria , will also start another civil war because this is not a regular 2-sided war , it 's a 5 sided war with al-qaeda and isis . 
  do you think isis or al-qaeda aka al-nusra will stop its activity if assad or fsa wins ? 
  haha , no . 
  iraq has been shit since 90 's . 
  jordan may have its part of arab winter thing , who knows ? 
  egypt is still unstable . 
  libya went full anarchy mode . 
  so as long as things do n't change ( and seem so ) , refugees will keep fleeing to neighbour countries , then europe . 
  yeah . 
  as if you g\u00fclenists have n't done anything to fuck this country up via ergenekon and balyoz trials , removing neutrality of state institutions , encouraging islamism . 
  turkey wo n't accept it even though it will funded by the eu . 
  also it wo n't help the issue in favour of either tr or eu . 
  he caused bottles to drop so the shopkeeper went mad and ( tried to ) attacked him . 
  you can see the continuation on video . 
  nothing will change . 
  akp may lose a bit votes , the opposition will get what it gets . 
  hung government , no coalition . 
  i hope we wo n't keep voting until erdo\u011fan gets what he wants . 
  not so common . 
  some people do support some foreign teams as `` second favourite team '' but that 's all . 
  * akp could n't form a coalition , erdo\u011fan did n't give mandate to chp so we 're heading to snap elections at november 1st which erdo\u011fan is in favour of since 7th june elections .

  big brother does n't want coalition , he wants more and more power . 
  2 middle eastern attitude 4 me . 
  i 'm not proud , neither ashamed of it . 
  because there 's nothing to be proud of a country where i was randomly born in . 
  well we 've witnessed many issues that they * seem * angry like that and nothing happened after that . 
  or we just got used to that situation , idk . 
  calm down . 
  calm the fuck down . 
  there wo n't be any civil war or something like that . 
  tayyip is trying to increase tension and divide people into 2 pole as he does regularly since gezi and hopes that all those efforts will bring back as votes in election day . 
  after the elections , nobody knows what will happen next . 
  maybe peace process v2 .0 will begin , who knows ? 
  there is n't any opinion poll for possible incoming elections so i can not show whether those things changed people 's choice or not . 
  i 'm not that pessimistic . 
  is n't everyone except akp supporters think that ? 
  i exclude akp supporters because they live in parallel universe you know . . 
  yes . 
  literally everyone knows it . 
   tayyip is taking his country to war in order to win an election . 
  more like tayyip is doing everything in order to stay in power as much as he can . 
  we will join eu when the sun rises from west . 
  those people mostly came from war-torn countries , not normal stable countries . 
  and in fact , those people do n't immigrate to europe , they * flee * to europe . 
  so i think using `` immigration '' term is n't appropriate . 
  because literally everyone in turkey know how to use dns , vpn , proxy etc.
