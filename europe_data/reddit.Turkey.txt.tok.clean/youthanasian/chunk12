  in 2014 erdo was losing the control of himself but not completely lost . 
  erdo is not a favourable guy . 
  do n't confuse this country and its people with russia/ns . 
  the only 2 reasons why akp still rules the country are 1 . 
  all other centre-right parties have been absorbed by akp 2 . 
  opposition parties and their leaders are absolutely abhorrent . 
  two useless shit who look like they ca n't even control themselves , let alone the country . 
  and one pkk sympathiser . 
  [ this ] ( https://twitter.com/metropoll/status/766282553397575680 ) is his approval rate graph , he jumped 60 + because the poll was conducted 2 days after the coup attempt . 
  probably the rates are same now as they were before july 15th . 
  he 's ruling the country for 14 years , just like putin . 
  but he 's nowhere near as popular as putin . 
  turkish elections are not russian elections , remember [ june 7th elections ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_general_election,_june_2015 ) which akp lost the majority . 
  even hdp which is known for pkk-linked could bring down akp . 
  if chp or mhp change their leader for a better looking , better speaking , charismatic leader , akp is finished . 
  edit : link added for june 7th elections . 
  we have n't had western investing since 2013 , our economy depends on arab money . 
  the government does n't care what moody 's does as long as arab money flow into the country . 
  but i think that all that economy stuff will be a burden for post-erdo government , alongside with the country 's image in the eyes of rest of the world . 
  if even turkey has n't descended into civil war after 14 years of erdo rule , france will be safe . 
  then why putin rig the elections everytime ? 
  why create a mess like % 120 votes when you have % 80 approval ? 
  they rig the elections to get what they want ; is it hard for them to rig the polls , approval ratings ? 
  scholars who have been purged have zero chance of working in turkey as long as erdo is in the office , plus they are in danger of being jailed . 
  so the most logical choice is to migrate elsewhere , or starve to death without a job in turkey . 
  vote fraud is bad , acceptance of it is even worse . 
  unfortunately russian people get used to it because what else they can do ? 
   and death to kurds . 
  death to kurds ' dreams of statehood maybe . 
  their proposed state will be israel 2.0 in terms of diplomacy , alliances and destabilisation of the region . 
   and to everyone who happens to disagree with assad everyone who happens to disagree with assad are mostly islamist head choppers . 
  i do n't like assad either but his alternatives are al qaeda , muslim brotherhood and isis . 
   russia is n't known as the prison of nations for nothing . 
  usa bombs the region , topples secular authoritarians , creates power vacuum , causes a fertile land for islamic terror groups then the infinite destabilisation begins . 
  i do n't live in russia , i live in this region ; hence i care about countries ' mena policy . 
  trump suggest to work with russia to end the war , working with russia means victory for saa , defeat for jihadist groups . 
  on the other hand hillary wants to put boots on ground to topple assad ** even in this situation of syria ** and cause even worse shitfest than libya & iraq combined . 
  hillary is proven freedom \u2122 exporter to mena whereas trump is still an unknown mystery box . 
  might be worse , might be better i do n't know . 
  what i know is hillary presidency will be total disaster for the whole region . 
  edit : wrong word . 
  so hillary is n't ? 
  of course an eu bureaucrat would say that but the eu bureaucrats ' little sterile area is n't the whole world . 
  the middle east does n't need another us president who is no different than george w. bush in terms of middle east policy . 
  she wants regime change in syria and willing to put boots on ground for it . 
  she 's one of main responsibles for the current situation in libya , egypt and syria . 
  even the devil is a better alternative to hillary `` we came , we saw , he died ! '', 
  clinton . 
  fair point . 
  how 's that even relevant to the thing i said ? 
  i do n't talk about the nationality or behaviour of muslims , the point is conservative parties in turkey have always defended the thought that eu is a christian union which muslims can not enter no matter what . 
  that memorisation came to an end with bih 's membership application . 
  \\  inb4 `` bosnia is not muslim '' it is to conservative parties and vast majority of the people . 
  i should 've said `` i claimed neither '' , thanks for correcting me buddy !, 
  i claimed neither . 
  so this is the end of `` eu is a christian union !, 
  they do n't want us because we 're muslim ! '', 
  rhetoric used by conservative parties in turkey . 
  yes and only regime-friendly ones will be hired . 
   so what if you were converted to another religion ? 
  nothing happens . 
  you can change your religion on your id card but many people like me do n't bother because why though ? 
   you needed a new id card ? 
  if you change or remove islam from your id card , then they give you new id card which religion part is blank or the religion you chose is written on . 
  like [ this ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-des2au5hv-a/tfnk2-tispi/aaaaaaaaabu/4-o5vwp9tx8/s1600/kimlik_arka_maske.png )  even the cassier of a supermarket if you needed to show you id card when buying a bottle of wine ? 
  cassier may need of your id card but just to make sure that you are above 18 , religion has nothing to do with it . 
  [ current id cards ] ( https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1unyksrtnlu/vrjxzjd8ypi/aaaaaaaafne/rfspvxowhmm/s1600/nufuscuzdanipsd.png ) have religion part ( see : `` dini '' ) and they label you as muslim in your id card as soon as you born . 
  if your parents are muslim then you 're labeled as muslim . 
  you can change or remove islam from your id card but nobody cares about it . 
  that 's why polls and data show turkey as % 99.8 muslim . 
  new id cards , [ as examples show ] ( http://www.antalyahilal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/iste_chipli_yeni_kimlik_kartlari_h41926_04ac8.jpg ) wo n't have religion part . 
  only your name , surname , gender , identity number will be written . 
  cultural problems , rather than religious one . 
  i think poland is what would happen if we were majority christian nation . 
  it 's hard for atheists to be civil servants because well just look at the government we have . 
  in public sector , it depends on what ideology the boss supports . 
  i do n't know about indonesia but we have problems with `` us ( akp supporters ) / them ( everyone else ) '' mentality especially under this government 's rule and atheists fall into `` them '' cathegory . 
  it does record when christians , jews etc made at most 2 % of the population . 
  yes , it 's one of the most stupid ass implementation of this country . 
  i 'm glad there wo n't be religion part on the new id cards . 
  bombing the little saa enclave surrounded by isis territory with 4 jets does show what 's the priority of usa in syria . 
  isis could 've ended saa presence in the city which they hold for 3 years ( 1 year from fsa , 2 years from isis ) yesterday if ruaf did n't help the troops . 
  ** edit : ** [ that 's ] ( http://en.abna24.com/cache/image/2016/04/23/876622570905585287deff463f4ee577.jpg ) the enclave which has been bombed . 
  favourite place to study for turkish erasmus students . 
  i agree . 
  violence is an effective way to make your enemy scared and intimidated . 
  fear is more effective on achieving goals than bullets and rifles , just like how isis did in 2014/2015 . 
  but turkey is different , terrorism only brings people together and fuels anti-xyz sentiment . 
  ** terrorize , \u02c8terrorise ** * verb * : to make very frightened by using or threatening violence . 
  by killing main opposition leader you terrorise the people . 
  i hope you 're aware that this kind of logic would legitimate every terrorist organisation that ever existed because every terrorist organisation has goals and use violence to achieve them . 
  yes it 's fucking unbelievable , it 's like some saudi arabia-tier shit . 
  at least it 's good to see that public outrage worked on this issue . 
  high tax rates + low wages + low currency value = problem . 
  good thing is this incident stirred a huge public outrage and an investigation started on the attacker , the bus driver also being investigated because he refused to take her into hospital . 
  still , it 's not the attacker who frighten me , it 's the crowd in the bus who refused to stand up for her . 
  edit : he has been taken into custody and soon to be jailed , according to [ this ] ( https://twitter.com/abdulkaramazov/status/776817456161718272 ) [ account ] ( https://twitter.com/abdulkaramazov/status/776844452195217408 ) . 
  i hope it turns out to be true . 
  but the north still belongs to the uk . 
  terrorism wo n't solve anything , it only helps to create anti-x nation sentiment .
