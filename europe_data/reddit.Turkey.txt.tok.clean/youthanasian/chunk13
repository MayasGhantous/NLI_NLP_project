  lol , `` erdo\u011fan warriors '' ... that 's why they want to go back to the netherlands as soon as they come here for vacation in the summer . 
  these fuckers become even worse than geert wilders in terms of turkey bashing when they 're here yet when they go back to europe , they become the most nationalist group on earth . 
  we do n't like them because they do n't know anything about this country , they do n't know how we live yet they try to ( ( ( teach ) ) ) us what this country is . 
  pkk problem can not be solved via talks . 
  we see it when they dig barricades and plant ied 's in the cities/towns , roads , everywhere with the support of hdp-held municipalities in the east during the peace process . 
  it will be political suicide for any party to suggest talks with pkk again . 
  neither the government nor the people will say `` oh !, 
  they kill us , they bomb us !, 
  better off give them independence . '', 
  if it 's the issue . 
  i see no problem with the cover except `` kurds are fighting for their own state '' part . 
  bombing places , killing civilians , `` expanding the war to the west '' , plotting to assasinate main opposition party leader are n't fighting , it 's terrorism . 
  he 's responsible but he was n't ** that ** important figure compared to obama , clinton and sarko . 
  agreed . 
  he does n't . 
  by people i mean those who do n't vote for him . 
  his supporters will vote for him regardless whatever he does . 
  people support his efforts to remove g\u00fclenists from state institutions , not support himself directly . 
  his approval rate stays as it is , the other half of the country did n't stop to hate him just because the coup happened . 
  people uniting against g\u00fclen and his maniac cult followers = / = people liking erdo . 
  even if a guy like this got 6.5 years of sentence , terror laws are too weak in britain i suppose . 
  terrorists got at least 10 years in turkey . 
  max punishment is life-long sentence . 
  this guy could 've got at least 35 + years in turkey considering the number of people he convinced to join isis and openly challenging secular regime of britain . 
  ( shariah for uk thingy ), 
  what 's those retards up to and why do they protesting in uk ? 
  to protest non-existant racism ? 
  those retards should know that the state would n't let them to protest , then beat the shit out of them , and arrest them if there was racism in the countries they 're protesting against . 
  would n't be surprised if they turn out to be funded by soros . 
  cultural differences , lack of national identity , disloyality to the place one 's belong to , saudi funded mosques . 
  belgian muslims ca n't answer the question `` who am i ? 
  '' , indian muslims can . 
  belgian muslims try to find an identity to suit in and places they go like mosque or islamic centres use this perfect opportunity to drive the agenda . 
  just like classic diaspora nationalism but those people have islamism not nationalism . 
  clickbait title , makes you think that dutch police arrested some tayyip supporter just because he threatened g\u00fclen after the coup . 
  in article , it 's different story . 
  i support dutch police 's decision . 
  netherlands is not turkey , every person has a right to be secured against threats , especially collective ones . 
  newspapers are shit and m\u0130t decides their headlines , it 's the people i was talking about . 
  also russian `` hatred '' was next to zero compared to general anti-americanism in those days . 
  it does mean anything . 
  if you claim something without a proof besides some hearsay and rumours , it does n't mean anything . 
  if you say it like it 's a fact over and over again , it becomes propaganda . 
  simple as that . 
  nearly 70 % of people do n't trust the media , relax . 
  nobody is going to have a thought based on media broadcasting in turkey . 
  on the other hand , outsiders ( i do n't say western , eastern , northern , southern ; just other people ) believe whatever they 're being taught by the msm and then try to challenge us with the propaganda they 're fed with . 
  not an argument . 
  never because they advise us not to believe turkish media while they swallow whatever msm tells them without a question . 
  turkey isis oil thingy is nothing more than some claims and anti propaganda . 
  you do n't have to support kurdish terrorists over islamist terrorists . 
  isis is a temporary threat , pkk is permanent . 
  sorry but pkk is much much more than `` secular democratic freedom fighters which has women fighters and fight against isis '' . 
  surrounding countries and their nations see them as main threat for a reason . 
  the only opposition erdo likes is syrian opposition . 
  with the executive order issued on september 1st : ** 7669 ** police ** 323 ** gendarmerie ** 2 ** coast guard ** 24 ** non-appointed governors ** 28.163 ** from ministry of education ** 642 ** from ministry of finance ** 2.346 ** from council of higher education ** 312 ** from state tv sacked from their jobs . 
  total number of those who lost their job on september 1st is ** 50.589 ** . 
  except this war is not yugoslaw wars . 
  if assad wins , their `` fear of persecution '' wo n't end since they 're there because of him . 
  if rebels wins , your current refugees will go back but you 'll face another wave of refugees occured by christians , alawites , druze etc. 
  if isis wins , god saves us . 
  turkey : just fuck my shit up fam . 
  propaganda do wonders . 
  people can not be * imported * because people are not property . 
  people are people . 
  by your definition i assume you got upper class and/or skilled worker nigerians whose classes are the easiest to integrate . 
  you took the illiterate people from villages to meet your unskilled workforce demand , then you let them create ghettos , then you let them prosper without an education . 
  as a result they created their own culture which conflicts with both german and turkish culture . 
  edit : i wrote german culture but it can be changed as british , dutch , french etc. 
  yay !, 
  a country where religious tensions are on whole new level and people kill people en masse is definitely better than turkey and its people . 
  brits must be propaganda 'd the shit out of if they really think nigeria is better than turkey . 
  even you and your 20 friend would be `` the most effective force '' against isis if you have usaf support . 
  shout `` germany supports kurdish terrorism . 
  they support embargo on us because we kill pkk in syria '' problem solved . 
  turkey is n't `` created '' . 
  turkey * was * ottoman empire . 
  it was occupied after the collapse of ottoman empire , people fought , occupiers left . 
  you 'll have a right to do so when turkish nationalists blow up military buildings , kill soldiers or blow up civilians . 
  it was , a bit . 
  the government wants to clear the area between the border and al-bab & manbic area via fsa to resettle refugees ** in ** syria ; but the main goal is blockading ypg to connect cantons and removing them from the border . 
  no i 'm just teller of how to bring muslims into 21st century . 
  well their cultural influence over the region for centuries matter . 
  many people in northern africa think burqa is islamic while it 's just a cultural clothing belongs to bedouin people . 
  it 's called bid ` ah . 
  i am everything but pushover or passivist lol . 
  everything in my sentence is true . 
  burqa is n't mentioned in quran . 
  it 's written `` not expose their adornment ** except that which [ necessarily ] appears thereof ** and to wrap [ a portion of ] their headcovers over their chests '' at an-nur 31 . 
  it clearly mentions of headscarf and not covering of face , hands and foots , not covering the whole body . 
  what religion bedouins believe in ? 
  those muslim women have already been freed themselves from oppressive islamic community within the country . 
  i was talking about those who could n't . 
  because msm is n't familiar of middle east and its politics , its ideologies so they can not differentiate conservative to islamist to extremist . 
  for example leftism means secular nationalism in mena whereas it means whining about patriarchy or life being is n't fair to xyz in europe . 
  when things went well for turkey ? 
  never . 
  i 'm sure this is a correct decision . 
  he 's a demagogue ; he used islamic rhetoric to gain votes , now he uses nationalistic rhetoric to gain votes . 
  in 2011 , he advised muslim brotherhood in egypt to embrace secularism .
