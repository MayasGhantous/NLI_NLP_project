  [ link ] ( http://national.bgnnews.com/4000-year-old-written-tablets-detailing-social-issues-found-in-turkey-haberi/7767 ) ** update ** * at least 28 people killed and 100 ~ injured by explosion in \u015eanl\u0131urfa / suru\u00e7 . 
  there were 300 people before the explosion . 
  these were left-wing turkish and kurdish university students who made a donation to give kids toys and build library for the people of koban\u00ea . 
  the amount of killed people may be increased . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-33593615 ), 
  so there will be either akp-chp coalition or early elections . 
   the feelings of religious believers those religious believers should not to be so sensitive then . 
  non-believers ' freedom of expression is more important than their feelings . 
  i like how the governments which ruled by conservatives always use the same bullshit to overawe non-believers . 
  always . 
  brexit is more impossible than us to join eu . 
  interesting to see that greece still seeks bailout although it does n't work . 
  what is trilye https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tirilye, 
  both turkey and tunisia have that kind of institution and you can see the difference between those countries and others . 
  mosques that run by muslim associations will end up with being terrorist education centre . 
  all mosques and imams in uk should be linked to a religious institution which based on secular principles . 
  it will decrease extremism and strenghten secularism . 
  this is very interesting !, 
  good job !, 
  add : i also notice that , considering the first 5 words , we mostly talk about ourselves while others generally discuss about greece . 
  so . . what will happen next ? 
  according to wiki , there 's nothing besides churches , monasteries and priests . 
  oh and there is a prohibition on entry for women !, 
  so . . am i wrong ? 
  it seems that province looks like vatican of greece . 
  it was a joke . 
  i added '' / s '' anyway . 
  ` eu is kill ' / s, 
  except this one the winners are left-wing and greek people , not political islam and syrian jihadists . 
  so there 's * two * * edged * * sword * situation for germany . 
  they will either offer better deal of accept grexit . 
  greek people made it clear that they want to go their own way . 
  there will be either grexit or better offer from troika . 
  no other option . 
  it 's been good result for us dollar against euro . 
  the entire map in orange . 
  wow !, 
  so oxi wins ? 
  fighting racism with racism . 
  itt : people who think that everything was great until 1974 and suddenly evil turkish republic decided to attack cyprus . 
  will greek cypriots vote ** oxi ** again ? 
  rip europe . 
  once you let political islam in , there 's no way back . 
  grey masterrace . 
  first wl revealed that nsa wire-tapped chirac , sarkozy , holland and now this . 
  why nsa * seem * so obsessed with france ? 
   you have issues with kurds as a minority in turkey ... 
  yes we had in 90 's , but not now . 
  ** turkey ** * for the first time , lgbt parade has been attacked by the police since 2003 . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.cbsnews.com/news/gay-pride-parade-istanbul-attacked-by-police/ ) * homeland security council gathered and discussed about possible intervention in syria . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.haberturk.com/gundem/haber/1096449-suriyeye-sinir-otesi-operasyon-secenegi-mgk-gundeminde ) * an hdp mp , ertu\u011frul k\u00fcrk\u00e7\u00fc , said `` turkey should pay greece 's debts . '', 
  [ link ] ( http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/gundem/29410822.asp ) * the first round of election of 29th speaker of the grand national assembly will be held on 30.06.2015 ( today ) . 
  each party have candidates . 
  if a candidate gets 276 votes in the first round , he 'll be elected as speaker . 
  if no candidate gets 276 votes - which is very likely - , the second round will be held on the same day . 
  it may give hints about possible coalitions . 
  kurds will get motivation from it , turks ' fear of division will on rise again so it 's a bad thing for the government . 
   because tayyip and intelligence agency want to both get rid of shit-covered reputation of foreign policy by fighting against isis . 
  turkey has been accused of supporting isis for 3-4 months . 
  by declaring war on isis , tayyip will have the reason to say `` see ? 
  * you * accused us of supporting isis but we 're fighting against them . '', 
  they 'll hope it will help to fix the reputation . 
   username inspired by david sedaris ? 
   haha , not really . 
  inspried by [ youthanasia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/youthanasia ) album by megadeth . 
    what 's next , invading kurdish strongholds in iraq ? 
  this is a recipe for disaster . 
  it wo n't happen . 
  pdk/barzani and tayyip are allies unlike pyd/salih muslim . 
  also peshmerga is independent from pkk while pyd has organic ties with pkk . 
   by the way , since you 're turkish , what do you think about this analysis on how erdo\u011fan uses information to control the turkish society ? 
  overall correct . 
  ** media ** tayyip tax the shit out of businessmen whose newspaper/tv channel criticises him and sometimes demonise them at rallies . 
  if they keep criticising , savings deposit insurance fund of turkey seize the newspaper/tv channel because of * reasons * so newspapers become pro-government one way or another . 
  funny thing is although he try hard to seize the press , the most 4 circulated [ newspapers ] ( http://www.medyatava.com/tiraj ) in tr are n't pro-government . 
  ( 2 of them are anti-government . 
  s\u00f6zc\u00fc and zaman ) ** propaganda ** how he make a black propaganda ? 
  * if there 's a marginal or provocateur , specially generalise the marginal/provocateur . 
  for example imagine there 's a pro-laicite demonstration and ** someone ** chanted against islam . 
  tayyip will use it everywhere , make propaganda as if everyone chanted against islam and use islamic referances to polarise the people . 
  * if there 's nothing to make black propaganda , invent a lie with islamic sauce and repeat the lie over and over again until you 're sure that everyone believe or talks about your lie . 
  examples : `` they drank beer in the mosque '' , `` they attacked a headscarved woman '' . 
  wrong analysis . 
  tayyip and intelligence agency plan to invade syria to fight against ** both ** isis and ypg . 
  why ? 
  because tayyip and intelligence agency want to both get rid of shit-covered reputation of foreign policy by fighting against isis and decrease the possibility of a kurdish state in syria . 
  turkish armed forces are highly against to any intervention in syria . 
  i recommend you to read @fuatavni_f , tayyip 's whistleblower tweets to understand what really * is * and what * will * going on here . 
  nevertheless , we have long long way to success . 
  people just yelled to the police in that video . 
  no chant . 
  i did n't heard any chant about erdo\u011fan there . 
  not really . 
  founders of the party have always been pro-islam and have always had secret agendas . 
  you can find what rte said about democracy , laicit\u00e9 etc in 90 's . 
  i * suppose * that was for propaganda to show themselves as `` guardian of islamic values '' in order to gain conservative kurds ' vote . 
  the pride has been held since 2003 and it 's the ** first ** ** time ** police attacked . 
  it must be different than that . 
  we 'll see what was the secret agenda behind that incident .
