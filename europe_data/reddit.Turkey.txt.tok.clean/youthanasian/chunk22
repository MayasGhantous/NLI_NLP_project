  tayyip is not retarded , he knows he 'll spark a civil war if he crackdown on us . 
   haha spot the shrill . . haha spot the defamer . . you should look at my comments i 've posted since i became a subscriber of this subreddit before smear on me . 
  yup . 
  it sounds very interesting i know but this is the first time that actually we 're not in danger . 
  its because the pilot successfully hid the plane and distinguish it as turkish airlines plane . 
  normally the plane of him 's registration code started with tc , means turkish republic . 
  but that time , the registration code started with tk , turkish airlines registration code . 
  even according to flightradar24 , it seemed like a turkish airlines flight departured from dalaman but landing destination is unknown . 
  and in that time , f4 aircraft were flying from eski\u015fehir airbase to combat against putschist f16 's so the coup attempters both were distracted and could n't identify tayyip 's plane . 
  kemalist generals saved his ass by not participating g\u00fclen-orchestrated coup attempt . 
  the main opposition party and the main secular party chp sided with the government and declared its anti-coup stances . 
  those 2 were important because coup attempters were seeking for support from kemalists but neither the military nor the civilian side sided with them , in fact opposed them and sided with erdo\u011fan . 
  erdo\u011fan knows if generals had participated and kemalist folk went out the streets and cheer for tanks , he could have been dead by now . 
  erdo\u011fan brings back many kemalist generals who have been unjustly persecuted by g\u00fclen-dominated judges via ergenekon & balyoz trials to the positions formerly occupied by g\u00fclenist thugs . 
  some kind of payback is going on which erdo\u011fan and kemalists are winning . 
  turkey has become a suffocating country for secularist turks for 14 years . 
  our values are n't shared , even cursed upon . 
  our way of life is under attack for years . 
  they interfere our alcohol , they interfere what we want to wear , they interfere what we do . 
  why would i waste the rest of my life here and live and die as a second class citizen whom the government does n't respect his existence at all ? 
  i do n't want to be rich , i do n't want to be the next bill gates , i do n't want to be a part of your left-wing parties ' `` cultural diversity '' . 
  i just want to do without a fear of persecution and live freely . 
  i just want to ** feel ** as a part of the society , not enemy of it . 
  i just want to criticise things without being persecuted . 
  i just want to say `` i 'm an atheist '' openly without being afraid of staying jobless and of lynched by islamist mob . 
  i can not those things in this country , it 's not my country . 
  it 's just a place i was born into . 
  i have more in common with the people on this subreddit than i have with in this country . 
  why would i have to bear all this shit ? 
  i know there are many secular turks who think like man and i also know many secular turks will flee this country in the moment we have an opportunity from a european/north american country to migrate . 
  why it would be electoral suicide ? 
  if anything , secular turks will vote for right-wing parties to keep islam out of politics and society . 
  as long as you do n't say a bad word about the great leader , you 'll be ok . 
  very surprising indeed . 
  hyper surprising . 
  who could have thought ? 
  it 's so easy to do such thing when majority of people are backwards as fuck . 
  i do n't know but it does n't sound unbelivable . 
  then do n't expect us to come to your country because those people and the government elected by those people are the reasons why we 'll leave . 
  it 's hardly something to be sad about considering it 's the average people who turn this country into umbearable for us in the first place . 
  no , you should . 
  in fact , you should do it fast . 
  most likely this will happen . . 
  oh my dear mate , wish you could see how naive you sound . 
  we are considered even more dangerous threat to them than you westerners because they think we pollute the muslim nation in the country ( country name is irrelevant at this point because this is a similar way of thought of `` non-moderate '' muslims throughout the muslim world . ), 
  mate i do n't know if the following will please or worry you but syrian migrants and secular turks wo n't get along because of cultural differences . 
  we and them are two opposite worlds . 
  so in that case , secular turks will go for right-wing parties . 
  after getting islam down our throats for 14 years , we just want secularism . 
  i was actually talked about erdo\u011fan but cersei is also ok in my book . 
  fortunately her reign will end shortly after that targaryen whore land on king 's landing . 
  i 'll try to get one as long as i can but i do n't think i 'll be able to get one in these days . 
  scandinavian countries are the only favourable countries in europe among secular folk . 
  we use sweden as the best example in the incidents , like a : why do n't we have proper human rights ? 
  b : you confuse here with sweden i suppose . 
  so , do n't know . 
  in case of migration wave , you surely will get some of us . 
  when turkey had a chance to join eu ? 
  we need another robert baratheon to end the reign of mad king aerys iii . 
  the fee is very expensive , getting visa is hard and visiting abroad is not a thing average mehmet like me can do because abroad is even more expensive . 
  turkish lira is as worthy as toilet paper against euro and dollar . 
  what 's the point of it if you can not use it ? 
  there are only 8 mio out of 80 mio people who have passport as far as i know . 
  apart from that ; the state of emergency is on power and academics and civil servants have already been banned from going abroad which means visiting abroad in general wo n't be easy in the forseenable future . 
  this is what most of people think about the coup attempt . 
  also the coup has been exposed by national intelligence service at 16:00 so they had to move fast in order not to get caught . 
  if it was n't for m\u0130t , coup would 've been orchestrated on july 16th at 03:00 and curfew would 've been declared throughout the country at 06:00 . 
  this was what they planned , nice and clean . 
  nice nickname though , ours is the fury . 
  well i lost that opportunity to have one . 
  do n't think i 'll get one in the forseenable future . 
  kurds are not strong to turn things into civil war , it is called low-profile insurgency and will remain so . 
  bacon and pork in general is n't popular among any public group in this country . 
  alcohol on the other hand would be pretty nice indicator for it . 
  civil war between what ? 
  if you think secular middle class will fight and waste their lives in the battlefield and not fleeing the country in case of civil war , you know nothing . 
  well they 'll ** hardly ** blend in with us if they really want to . 
  we 're not syrian conservative illiterates , we can understand who is whom . 
  any country which makes things easier to migrate for secular turks will win if you consider getting secular immigrants as `` winning '' . 
  [ see ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4tt7th/erdo%c4%9fan_declares_state_of_emergency/d5k5pnd ) the other comment i replied . 
  things do n't go pretty quick on bureaucracy when you are middle eastern . 
  also i do n't have neither passport nor money to flee . 
  edit : grammar . 
  secularists will flee this country en masse one day , just ca n't say when . 
  be ready for secular immigrant influx . 
  yes , in theory the parliament could veto this decision but in reality akp has the majority of the parliament so it wo n't be a problem to pass it . 
  he can introduce new laws without the parliament , governor will have more authority and turkish armed forces will have to obey governors , policemen can search houses without judicial permission etc. 
  shit will happen . 
  that 's what it means . 
  i advise you to read [ this article ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36815476 ) . 
  although i do n't like ezgi ba\u015faran , she did a excellent job to explain all that mess to outsiders . 
  i 'll quote the main conspiracy theories :  one theory suggests it was a `` false flag '' event staged by president erdogan to gain more power , but common sense dictates the event went too far to be a false flag . 
  this looks like false as hell because no general would agree to be sacrificed for tayyip . 
  tayyip 's influence within army is not strong , keep it in mind . 
  army is ** still ** independent and vast majority of it are secular nationalists even though g\u00fclenists tried to get rid of them via ergenekon & balyoz trials ( kangaroo courts in other words )  another theory embraced by the kurdish movement is that kemalists - secular followers of the founder of modern turkey , mustafa kemal ataturk - in the army tricked the gulenists into staging a coup . 
  they knew it would fail and that it would lead to a long-awaited cleansing of gulenists from the military . 
  this is logical . 
  kemalists ( like me ) hate g\u00fclen more than tayyip because he is the main actor of islamisation of the country . 
  his islamic cult has a hidden agenda to leak into the state institutions and seize them . 
  their masterplan back in ' 90 's and early - ' 00 's was seizing the control of state institutions , attempt a coup and bring fethullah g\u00fclen like how khomeini brought to iran .
