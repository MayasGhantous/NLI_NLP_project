  he 'll use `` i 'm democratically elected '' card as much as he can after all this . 
  if there was another referendum , young voter turnout would be same . 
  it 's problem caused by apolitic status of the youth and not having a mandatory voting system . 
  i do n't think he cares about mhp-friendly voters * that * much considering he has his own voterbase which vote for him just because it 's him , regardless of what he has done or he 's doing . 
  this fact conforts him to act freely . 
  get ready to call eu `` union europ\u00e9enne '' . 
  united kingdom still is one of superpowers . 
  they still have one of the largest economies in europe . 
  commenting like they are some second world fragile five country is ridiculous . 
  brexit camp was brilliant on propaganda . 
  remain camp was n't that good to counter . 
  brexit camp perfectly used fear to gain votes , their propaganda based on fear on immigration . 
  it seems they actually convinced people that we are going to join the eu and 78 million people are waiting at borders to migrate to uk . 
  they also perfectly used incidents like terrorist attacks or tayyip 's bullshit statements or bla bla bla to gain votes . 
  i am amazed to see that they used exact the same tactics with tayyip . 
  create a common enemy , argue that the main target ( eu , in this case ) is causing/collaborating with this enemy , put fear in people 's heart and consolidate the people . 
  let 's talk about the brexit decide . 
  i do n't believe in doomsday theories about it . 
  britain is a strong country if not the strongest . 
  they have a history of dominance over the world . 
  i believe they will get over this short-term instability soon . 
  britain is a very important country and it would be dumb for entrepreneurs , investors , millionaires , billionaires etc. 
  to leave just because of brexit . 
  off-topic : from when megathreads are being called `` m\u00e9ga sujet '' in this sub ? 
  now britons can understand what ** we ** feel after the election results . 
  i support this referendum . 
  the whole eu bid thing has started without public 's approval , lasted without public 's approval . 
  vote leave based their campaign on us . 
  probably frexit and dexit campaigners will also base . 
  why are we still waiting at the door of the club whose members do n't want us ? 
  of course there are ideological reasons , economical reasons etc. 
  to will this referendum but this is the main reason . 
  addition : probably this referendum will be the only one which both secularists and islamists vote for same option . 
  brsortie . 
  that 's the only true thing he said for years . 
  wish it was so easy . 
   vote leave you mean migrate , i think . 
  i do n't know much about le pen but since meral ak\u015fener is secular , pro-women rights and serious opponent to tayyip ( unlike k\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu and bah\u00e7eli ) , she 's ok in my book . 
  maybe we have a chance in democratic way to defeat tayyip before he turns this country into saudi arabia after all . 
  this wo n't persuade tayyip 's supporters not to vote for him since they vote for islamic motivation . 
  his opponents do n't care the tourism at all . 
  pretty fucked up situation imo ; they adore his cult so whatever he does , they still support him . 
  i know . 
  you demanded what mass migration is and i answered you . 
  mass migration is migrating to the specific country * en masse * . 
  anyway i 219k out of 35m does n't sound neither increasing nor mass migration . 
  majority of those are employed so `` they 're on welfare '' argument is also invalid . 
  i wonder what argument going to be used . 
  i do n't see mass migration from romania and bulgaria to there . 
  it 's sad to see that a whole camp base their propaganda on xenophobia . 
  i do n't care what they say about turkey , erdo fucked this country 's shit up anyway . 
  but i do n't understand why they are against serbia or montenegro to join eu . 
  seriously , what did those countries do ? 
  okay . 
  what all the fuss was about ? 
  the whole `` visa-free travel '' thingy is already on effect for special passport holders ( any special passport holder can visit any eu country except uk for 30 days . ), 
  deal is for expanding 30 days to 90 days that 's all . 
  i really wonder those who oppose it knows what they are really oppose . 
  only civil servants and their families can get special passport btw . 
  not average people . 
  meanwhile in reality ; poverty line : 4.478 tl per month hunger line : 1.375 tl per month minimum wage : 1.344 per month . 
  i think we 've done a great sin and god punishes us by making those retarded nationalists/islamists be majority of the country . 
  i have no other explanation for these cringeworthy bullshit . 
  left-wing voterbase is nearly 30 % of total votes . 
  turkey is pretty right-wing country , hence religious and nationalist . 
  i do n't think this issue has something to do with refugee crisis . 
  recognising the genocide means `` fuck you '' in diplomatic language because it 's one of the most efficient ways to show opposition against turkey . 
  about refugee crisis : it 's a shame that eu can not unite themselves and fight against illegal immigration as a whole , instead they adopt `` out of sight , out of mind '' policy . 
  as a result , the whole eu is depend on erdo\u011fan now . 
  pkk activists ? 
  what did those activists do in paris ? 
  petitioning for the nature ? 
  if they pass as activists then we can also call isis or al qaeda terrorists as activist . 
  well my trip to the central anatolia says otherwise . 
  mosques are full , religion gets always mentioned , you can not eat outside during ramadan . 
   sorry but you do n't really know anything about turkish politics . his voters are n't religious fundamentalist at all . 
  half of his voters are islamist but turkish islamist is far more moderate than a arabic islamist or isis . 
  i 've never been to the akp-stronghold provinces : the post . 
  psychological projection is a theory in psychology in which humans defend themselves against their own unconscious impulses or qualities ( both positive and negative ) by denying their existence while attributing them to others . 
  for example , a person who is habitually rude may constantly accuse other people of being rude . 
  it incorporates blame shifting . 
  according to some research , the projection of one 's unconscious qualities onto others is a common process in everyday life . 
  so if we find out that isis prepared the attack , will they make `` slaughter all muslims '' trending ? 
   it 's far more difficult to emigrate to the anglosphere than europe . 
  so i 'm not surprised that the better educated turkish emigrants tend to live there . 
  that 's why skilled workers use their ability to migrate anglosphere so they can live a better life . 
  i do n't see any reason to migrate austria or germany . 
  compared to [ the usa ] ( http://secim.haberler.com/2015/amerika-birlesik-dev-secim-sonuclari/ ) , neither of those countries seem catchy . 
  i only used ideology as argument , there are many reasons why new-wave migrants migrate to the usa , canada , new zealand , australia . 
  \\  giving any kind of islamists the power . 
  do you think people who are fed up with akp and those who support akp migrated to the countries which have large pro-akp turkish diaspora presence ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  akp got % 60 in austria , germany ; % 70 in netherlands . 
  those who migrated mostly migrated to the usa , canada and australia . 
  sorry europeans . 
  ** about the source : ** it was all over in turkish media . 
  it would 've been labeled as `` local news '' and deleted in the second if i posted a turkish source for it and posted translation in comments . 
  the only english source for this was russia today so would 've been deleted as soon as i posted since it 's also forbidden . 
  that website was the only way to submit the news without any handicap . 
  evrensel has the video of him saying that .
