  they are considered newspapers here because well . . 
  they are . 
  newspapers are being bought for ideological purposes . 
  each newspaper supports an ideology . 
  nowadays they are either pro or anti-erdo\u011fan . 
  obama is pretty cold towards erdo . 
  as far as i know tayyip requested to go to the usa for relations with obama since 2013 but obama rejected them all . 
  he could only met biden . 
  neither of presidential candidates are warm to turkey anyway . 
  clinton will keep the current status quo with turkey and trump will probably treat turkey like iran or some enemy country . 
  i hope pro-erdo\u011fan fraction is n't big considering all balkan turks despise erdo\u011fan and vote for chp en masse . 
  i responded another one about this issue . 
  okay so i feel i have to longen my response . 
  we do n't have high-tech , our investments in technology is very low if there 's any . 
  we do n't have our own car industry like germans , americans , south koreans etc. 
  that 's the second part . 
  our economic growth is based on 3 things : tourism , construction and exporting . 
  we can not export to neighbouring countries because . . well , we have problems with them . 
  we can only export them to african countries , azerbaijan etc. 
  tourism gone to shit because western ( germans and britons , more spesifically ) tourists wo n't come here because security concerns and erdo . 
  russian tourists wo n't come here because plane crisis . 
  erdo and his buddies leaned to arab countries to decrease the deficit but it does n't work so far . 
  the only remaining revenue source is construction which the average mehmet never ever get profit from because the buildings constructed for rich people ( preferably foreign ) . 
  i wonder how the turkish economy under these circumstances considered ` good ' or at least ` not bad ' ? 
  actually 2 out of 8 are anti-erdo\u011fan , the rest are pro . 
  happy cake day !, 
  turkey is isolated from every ` sane ' country already . 
  our only allies are saudi arabia and qatar . 
  that should tell you a thing . 
  turkey 's economy has already gone shit . 
  average monthly income is way below the poverty line , usd/try parity is high . 
  tourism is dead , the numbers of foreign arrivals have dropped like atomic bomb . 
  prices getting more and more high . 
  my opinion ? 
  i could n't care less . 
  i have never voted for his party . 
  i have never helped his party to get elected . 
  all these things are uncultured islamists ' fault , so they 're the one who supposed to fix it . 
  not me . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.haberler.com/gazeteler/ ) is the link for every newspaper 's frontpage in turkey . 
  in my opinion , g\u00fcne\u015f 's ( pro-government ) cover is the most interesting because it just says `` open the gates '' . 
  it 's pronounced like `` he '' in t ** he ** . 
  english speakers can pronounce it when it 's between lett ** er ** s but they can not pronounce it as a vowel like a or e or u. 
  the sound between s and p in speaker and p and r in pronounce is also '' \u0131 '' . 
  yes , it means `` king '' in turkish . 
  `` tanr\u0131-kral '' means `` god-king '' . 
  it would be funny if mindless drones did n't actually say that . 
  german recognisation of armenian genocide is final in the coffin of turkish foreign policy . 
  there 's no need to write so much than that . 
  shame on mindless drones who keep this fucktard dictator get elected . 
  well at least it caused a good thing . 
  people on social media launched a campaign to send the money you can not withdrew ( like 4.32 $ , $ 8.12 etc. ), 
  to [ l\u00d6sev ] ( http://www.losev.org.tr/v2/en/default.asp ) ( foundation for children with leukemia ) . 
  so far they raised [ $ 32.282 ] ( https://twitter.com/losev1998/status/737889380191371264 ) ( 41.591,53 tl + 17.274,07 $ + 802,30 $ ) within 2 days !, 
  i hope they raised more and more money until june 6th . . 
  it 's still not clear that what are the boundaries of `` local news '' label . 
  for example , `` mass assault is reported in germany '' news is not considered local but `` ex-miss turkey jailed for insulting erdo\u011fan '' news is local . 
  what kind of news should we post ? 
  what was our sin to have this fucktard as head of state for 13 straight years ? 
  turkish people ( i mean those who have passport , like 10 % of population ) prefer to go on vacation in greek islands , georgia mostly . 
  they prefer because the prices ( especially alcohol ) is cheap and to be away from turkey . 
  many people ca n't even go on vacation . 
  so it 's a really bad summer season for all those hotel owners in turkish riviera because neither foreign nor local tourists will come . 
   turkey is not sending highly educated syrians to europe . 
  gee , i wonder why . 
  grey wolves start to get organised in high schools , left wing organisations do that as well . 
  it 's generalised view of political fighting in high school . 
  kemalists , islamists etc. 
  mainly choose a side , a few of them choose not to pick a side and remain non-aligned . 
  this happens in high schools which education is n't qualified and students are mainly from low-class . 
  it does n't happen in high-reputation public schools and private schools . 
  i 've studied in a very diverse class back in elementary school . 
  there were assyrians , armenians , 2 turkish christians , kurds , alevi etc. 
  bullying on ethnicity never happened but bullying on looking ( lol your ear is big what are you type of bullying ) happened many times although it 's nowhere near american-tier bullying . 
  i 've never witnessed a bullying in high school . 
  fighting for ideologic reasons was very popular though . 
   the number of imam high schools increased to 3500 from 500 because you converted lots of schools to religious schools . 
  even the elementary school i lived near became religious school . 
   islamic faculties increased to 100 from 17 because in every university akp built , islamic faculty was the first built one . 
   imam high school students increased to 1.5 m from 60k if kid does n't get a decent point from the exam and his family has no money to afford private school , the only place he can go is religious school since the general high schools have been succesfully turned into religious schools overnight . 
  obama - merkel - putin - assad - rouhani - trump . 
  i might be wrong since i do n't watch news not to hear tayyip 's voice . 
  you do n't have a secular country if you can not enforce the secular law . 
  you do n't have a country if you can not control your borders . 
  i do n't understand why the `` tolerance '' thing gone too far . 
  islamists just can not go to a bar and try to enforce sharia law in turkey , otherwise the people in the bar will enforce secular law in their ass . 
  i do n't mention to government , i 'm talking about the people . 
  islamists can not dare to tell locals how to wear or what to drink in edirne but they somehow dare to tell same thing in europe , in copenhagen without a beating , even without a fine . 
  wow , average mehmet gets paid below the poverty line . . ( poverty line is at 4.344 tl/1 .293,51 $ ) .
