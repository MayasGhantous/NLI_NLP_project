  holy shit who is that, 
  are those votes popular & jury combined or jury only ? 
  random voting , random voting everywhere, 
  wish there was turkey too . 
  i think ukraine will win the popular vote but russia will win the overall ( popular + jury ), 
  oddschecker going crazy for russia . 
  he meant that skilled people who want to migrate to usa can speak english properly . 
  so in case of migration , language wo n't be problem for them . 
   do you think its because those migrants are sometimes underinformed on the issue , or because they are so highly educated/skilled that they dont have to care ? 
  those people think 2 things : 1 . 
  how good i 'll be paid ? 
  ( since we 're talking about engineers , doctors etc ) 2 . 
  how free i 'll be ? 
  why do n't they migrate to austria ? 
  because ; 1 . 
  it 's not as `` catchy '' as canada for example . 
  the most cancerous turkish diaspora in the world lives there . 
  conservative , pro-tayyip , every stereotype new migrants escape from . 
  mostly usa , also australia , canada are highly chosen . 
  countries like germany , netherlands , france are highly unlikely migration destinations because of * cough * diaspora * cough *, 
  shit mustafa akyol says . 
  i 'd understand if a western journalist wrote it but you live in turkey , you 're supposed to know things better than them yet you have the same knowledge level with them . 
  erdo\u011fan was n't even liberal to begin with , he had been called like that because he was useful tool for usa back then . 
  he was islamist as fuck during 90 's , he got arrested for provoking the people , then acquitted , then use it for agitation , then finally he came to power in 2002 . 
  he never approach to `` common sense '' , he had `` you are either with us or with others '' mentality that alienated a good amount of people since his election . 
  he said so many things that anger his secular opponents ( i wo n't write them , you can google it , there are tons of them ) and caused [ republic protests ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republic_protests ) , he got really really angry about it and started his own nuremberg trials ( [ ergenekon ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ergenekon_trials ) and [ balyoz ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sledgehammer_\\ ( coup_plan \\ ) ) ) on known secularists and army . 
  they were the days if you are known , secular and oppose akp , you have 98 % chance to get arrested for being a member of `` ergenekon '' . 
  last damage was destroying the jurisdiction via [ 2010 constitutional referendum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_constitutional_referendum,_2010 ) . 
  they did successfully hide what they were actually wanting and used `` we 're removing the remnants of '80 coup '' rhetoric . 
  after eliminating the jurisdiction , nothing left to be afraid for tayyip . 
  you know the rest of the story . 
  those are what things were before 2011 , in other words , those were what happened in turkey while tayyip represented as superman in western media . 
  eu membership is not a single-issue voting concern . 
  in other words , nobody would vote for any candidate just for being pro-eu . 
  being conservative or being la\u00efc is one of the main issues to vote for here , eu membership is on second plan . 
  in addition to that , people generally do n't care about eu anymore ( i know i 'm the millionth person who say that but still ) , conservative people do n't want for obvious reasons , secular/la \u00efc / pro-western/whatever you call people do n't give it priority . 
  \\  natural let 's call it historical obsession . 
  \\  using the name constantinople and trebizond unironically . 
  you 're right . 
  however , an average mehmet still ca n't afford a turkish passport . 
  threshold has to be decreased to decent percentage like 3 % , but thankfully , we do n't have first past the post system although akp wanted to put it into force a few years ago . 
  i can not imagine what would the political environment be in turkey if we had fptp and 10 % threshold . 
  i do n't get why he insist on visa-free travel anyway . 
  if he wanted us to go abroad , he would n't made turkish passport to be [ the most expensive one ] ( https://www.statista.com/chart/4031/the-worlds-most-expensive-passports/ ) . 
  10 % threshold put into effect by the junta to block pro-kurdish and islamists parties entering the parliament . 
  it 's still in force because parties in parliament love it more than anything . 
  it helps to create monopolies , if it was 5 % then there would be lots of small parties in the parliament and those big parties would lose their advantage . 
  [ 2002 elections ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_general_election,_2002 ) was bloodshed and akp got % 66 of seats with % 34 vote because of the threshold . 
  i do n't think he cares about eu parliament either . 
   i 'm wondering what will happen in the next months in turkey . 
  we also do n't know , [ chp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republican_people%27s_party_\\ ( turkey \\ ) ) keep acting like they live in norway or switzerland . 
  opposition within [ mhp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nationalist_movement_party ) getting stronger and probably they overthrow [ devlet bah\u00e7eli ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/devlet_bah\u00e7eli ) in the upcoming convention . 
  he and his incompetence are the main reason of akp votes . 
  if [ meral ak\u015fener ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/meral_ak\u015fener ) become the leader of mhp , many things may change , maybe not . 
  other than that , they keep oppressing the people and disperse any rally from the beginning . 
  akp do n't want another gezi protests , that 's for sure . 
   what will davutoglu do now ? 
  probably nothing , he 'll be fade away like abdullah g\u00fcl at worst . 
   is a split inside the akp possible ? 
  that 's a wild card , i believe that there 's silent opposition within akp that may show up , it depends on progress . 
   i think that erdogan is trying to gain consensus among his voters , but he is also pissing off a lot of people inside his country . 
  not every akp voter is mindless tayyip drones . 
  he also piss off a lot of his voters , mainly non-islamist centre-right supporters who voted for [ anap ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/motherland_party_\\ ( turkey \\ ) ) and [ dyp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/democratic_party_\\ ( turkey , _ current \\ ) ) back then . 
  they still vote for akp because there 's no centre-right alternative besides akp , akp succesfully eliminated or assimilated other centre-right parties . 
  who knows what the future holds ? 
  [ relevant . 
   is the parliament really going to give him pass ? 
  what parliament ? 
  does he look like someone who cares about parliament ? 
  so i 'm 22 cm taller than average , hmm ... 
  it 's not about russian media nor russian state . 
  chechens are the main supporters of islamic terrorism hence islamic state . 
  you can find chechens in any islamic terror organisation . 
  they have probably the most islamic terrorists per population . 
   hdp is a pro-minority political party in turkey . 
  generally left-wing , the party places a strong emphasis on participatory democracy , feminism , minority rights , and egalitarianism . 
  it is an associate member of the party of european socialists ( pes ) and consultative member of the socialist international . 
  hdp want to be like that in order to avoid to be looked like single issue party . 
  their raison d'\u00eatre is autonomy for south-eastern turkey . 
  yes , they show themselves as a progressive party in the western turkey and actually half of their mp 's are women as far as i know but i do n't think they 're neither founded nor continue as a progressive party . 
  why i think that ? 
  because otherwise they would 've said a word or two on feudalism in the eastern turkey . 
  yet they 're pandering landlords to get votes , let alone speak against the feudalism and plan to abolish it . 
  they commemmorate sheikh said 's death , who rebelled against newly-founded secular republic in order to establish a sharia state for both turks and kurds . 
  not exactly a progressive move , is n't it ? 
  i do n't care what they advocate to , i 'm not a nationalist . 
  if their only goal is for autonomy in south-eastern turkey so let them speak . 
  they got elected by the population so it 's their right to be in the parliament and speak what they want . 
  i just do n't want them to show themselves as a progressive party because they are n't . 
  neither their voterbase not they are not progressive . 
  sexy non-headscarved ypg chicks fighting against isis do n't make majority of kurds progressive . 
  72 virgins . 
  at least there is an actual opposition party to erdo and sizable population is against him in turkey . 
  russia on the other hand , well , there is n't any . 
  exact the same is happening in turkey . 
  now british people know what kind of people we 're dealing with for 15 years . 
  in the east ? 
  cheap country eurovision 2017 host i see ukrainian tourists regularly . 
  the nation is divided between pro-eu and pro-russia camps . 
  their women are gorgeous .
