  people care when this person is classified as an approved citizen for wearing hijab by the oppressive regime . 
  as churchill said , the best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter . 
  democracy only works with educated and intelligent people , not with illiterate peasants . 
  fran\u00e7ais est devenu la langue internationale en europe une fois de plus !, 
  so erdo unleashed his dogs in a pathetic attempt to scare us . 
  too bad we all got rabies vaccine . 
  wait until `` no '' wins and then meral ak\u015fener forms a new party . 
  every government care about itself and its people first . 
  that 's hardly news and that 's not the case . 
  the point of forming alliances is to equalise the military power with threat . 
  in that case , it 's russia . 
  there 's no way lithuania or poland can defend themselves against russia but they can in an alliance like nato . 
  extremely biased . 
  just compare their `` polling '' before june 2015 elections and the official results [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_polling_for_the_turkish_general_election,_june_2015 ) . 
  this is an alliance , not a trade partnership . 
  in an alliance , the main goal is to defend others , not profit from . 
  thanks , we 'll need it . 
   what is stopping erdogan from just stuffing the ballots/faking the vote ? 
  volunteers who monitor the whole voting process , informed dissidents who watch the counting of the ballot box they voted , opposition parties ' collective effort to get each ballot boxes ' minutes in order to put them in the simulation and see whether there 's an irregularity between data they gathered and the official results , if there 's any , they claim objection . 
   i 'm wondering because my impression from the media has been that he 's pretty much knocked out the justice system and so on , so what 's keeping the elections fair ? 
  see above + people who want to get rid of this nightmare through the democratic way . 
  [ polls ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_constitutional_referendum,_2017#opinion_polls ) are stabilised on very close `` no '' victory with an exception . 
  ( orc is an super-partisan polling thingy which gives akp a lot of votes than actual ) addition : many `` no '' voters are afraid to express their voting choice due to fear of being blacklisted/labelled . 
  so they lie , they say they are `` undecided '' or `` will boycott '' or even say `` yes '' to the pollsters . 
  keep that in mind when you look at the ref polls . 
  we have the best clowns , do n't we folks ? 
  polls are very bad , erdo has n't been victimised yet . 
  that farce with netherlands had no effect on the electorate , many people think that was an unnatural crisis to get votes . 
  he 's desperately trying to be victimised so our emotional people can vote for him . 
  do n't bite the bait . 
  that 's true only if you live in united kingdom . 
  enough with your stupid referendums , erdo . 
  have you ever heard anything about `` voter fatigue '' ? 
  this . 
  unlike europe , secularism in the middle east rooted from socialism , not liberalism . 
  hence - almost - all secular nationalist movements in the mena are leftist or left-leaning . 
  yes , kinda . 
  also lenin backed turkish national movement and one of the first countries that recognised turkish republic . 
  ussr and turkey were buddy buddy until stalin came to power . 
  because kurds still practice tribal life with feudalism and arabs being arabs . 
  sorry to interrupt the conjuncture but not majority of kurds like good-looking ypg fighters as you see from the ` net . 
  also the direction she points out is west and she comes from the east . 
  secularisation of the turkish nation has n't started with atat\u00fcrk 's reforms . 
  well , atat\u00fcrk 's reforms had skyrocketed the process but actually it started with tanzimat reform in 1839 . 
  also secularism also has strong roots in the turkish society . 
  people liken the situation to iran or afghanistan or bla bla bla and think secularists in this country are a few . 
  it 's not . 
  they live there for 500 + years and hold a passport . 
  they are hardly foreigners , and definitely not illegal immigrants . 
  well , til . 
  do n't know . 
  i do n't have much information about voting dynamics in serbia . 
  i just know about serbians favourable view of russia and i wrote how to change things in the eyes of eu . 
  eu do n't care what he does in his country as long as he sides with them ( aka do whatever they tell ) . 
  wait until this guy openly sides with russia and be anti-eu to get votes . 
  the difference is balkan turks were/are living in balkans for 500 + years , embraced the local culture and adapted into , whereas diaspora in western europe brought to meet cheap and unwanted workforce , so they were uneducated peasants from inner anatolia , went there , created their own neighbourhoods and isolated themselves from the country they live in . 
  by the govt i mean turkish govt , not bulgarian one . 
  sorry for causing misunderstanding . 
  because dost is literally akp 's bulgaria branch and i hate akp , so do all of my relatives in bg . 
  that does n't mean i love dps/h \u00d6h . 
  i hope my relatives in bulgaria do n't vote for dost . 
  i doubt bulgarian turks will prefer dost . 
  it 's also funny that the * turkish * government suddenly cares about bg turks after 15 years of indifference . 
  edit : added * turkish . 
   % 15 hdp that 's the point . 
  nope . 
  [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/a/fsklt ) is also the latest poll on referendum . 
  the results are similar . 
  so we have 12 % undecided , 14,76 % who boycott it , 40 % no and 32.5 % yes . 
  we need to do everything to take those boycotters to the ballot boxes . 
  past year has made a lot of you sceptical of opinion polling because people like brexit supporters or trump supporters etc hide their intention to avoid public pressure so they said either undecided or other opinion . 
  in this case , the public & state pressure ( i mean real pressure like being arrested for campaigning for no ) comes from `` yes '' side . 
  so many `` no '' voters lie to pollsters about their true choice . 
  most of them say they are undecided , that 's why undecided rates are so high ( like 20-25 % ) , some say yes due to extreme pressure from the neighbourhood , some say boycott . 
  if some pollster comes to me and ask me what i will vote for , i 'd say `` i 'm undecided '' . 
  not because i really am but to avoid potential trouble . 
  do n't make me hopeless , the life is miserable enough here . 
  i think the image was created on purpose . 
  i 'd love that image if i was an alt-right member in europe who talks about how europe will be eurabia in 20 years . 
  many people actually monitor the elections since june 2015 elections due to lack of trust to the govt officials about fair elections . 
  i doubt christianity is growing in turkey . 
  the youth are abandoning islam but remain non-theist , they do n't adopt another religion . 
  if no wins , that makes us feel a lot better and give us hope because we will have the support of the majority and erdo 's side will be minority . 
  the opposition badly needs hope , and `` no '' victory will give it . 
  in that case , i do n't care what erdo does , people will make him accept the results , whether he does or does not want that . 
  however , if yes wins , all is lost . 
  let 's hope for worst case scenerio to remain scenario then . 
  otherwise he 'll be wordbook definition of tyrant and i do n't want this country to be drown in blood to get rid of him . 
  ** istanbul -- appearances can deceive . 
  ** only one campaign is in sight less than a month before the april 16 referendum that would give turkey 's president recep tayyip erdogan vast new powers . 
  building-size billboards feature a giant likeness of mr. erdogan urging the nation to vote `` yes . '' on tv networks , government officials brand those opposing this executive presidency plan as traitors or supporters of terrorism . 
  finding any evidence of the `` no '' campaign can be mission impossible . 
  and yet , despite such a charged environment , a referendum victory for mr. erdogan looks surprisingly uncertain . 
  opinion polls keep showing a nation starkly divided along the middle -- with a significant part of mr. erdogan 's own justice and development party , or akp , electorate balking at the idea of scrapping turkey 's tradition of parliamentary democracy . 
  `` this is a huge problem for them : they were thinking they will easily get 60 % , '' says etyen mahcupyan , a political consultant who served as adviser to former prime minister ahmet davutoglu , a leading figure in akp . 
  `` and if we have a surprise on election day , it will be to the benefit of the ` no ' vote . 
  the government has created a ` yes ' atmosphere and many people are afraid of admitting that they will vote ` no , ' and are not telling the truth to the pollsters . '' even though the referendum campaign unfolds under the state of emergency imposed following july 's failed coup attempt against mr. erdogan , turkey 's voting process makes outright ballot-stuffing difficult . 
  https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/wo-bd198_xroads_16u_20170322155426.jpg mr. erdogan 's camp , of course , can still win the referendum . 
  `` we are sure we will receive a majority , '' akp 's deputy chairman yasin aktay said in an interview . 
  `` the opposition is not convincing .
