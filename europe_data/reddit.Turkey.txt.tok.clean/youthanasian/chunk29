  they have no argumentation except saying that we are bringing dictatorship or a one-man administration , which is not true . '' yet , the very fact that the outcome is now in doubt has re-energized the opposition to turkey 's leader -- just months after his hold on authority , in the wake of the july putsch attempt , seemed beyond any challenge . 
  the stakes ca n't be higher . 
  if mr. erdogan loses , that would be his most dramatic setback since coming to power in 2003 , shattering his aura of near-magic invincibility . 
  a referendum defeat could also change the geopolitical trajectory of one of america 's most important partners in the middle east and the north atlantic treaty organization alliance -- just as mr. erdogan is steering turkey further and further from its traditional bonds with the west .

  they see this as a matter of life or death , '' said sezgin tanrikulu , a lawmaker for the opposition chp party . 
  `` if that happens , akp will not be the same akp and turkey wo n't be the same turkey . 
  citizens , who now have so much despair , will acquire new self-confidence and new hope . '' a referendum defeat , if it occurs , would n't force mr. erdogan , whose mandate runs until 2019 , to step down , and would n't necessarily prompt new elections in the immediate future . 
  but it would almost certainly usher a period of new political instability as mr. erdogan struggles to regain momentum against emboldened foes . 
  mr. erdogan 's strategy in the past , when faced with challenges to his authority , has been to escalate crises and create new ones , at home and abroad . 
  that 's something that many , in turkey and western capitals , fear may happen in coming weeks , and even more so should voters reject his proposals on april 16 . 
  in the summer of 2015 , after an election in which akp failed to secure absolute parliamentary majority for the first time , mr. erdogan -- instead of moving to create a coalition government -- unleashed all-out war against kurdish militants and then called snap elections within months . 
  the akp regained its majority amid the nationalist fervor . 
  in a similar attempt to rally the nationalist vote , he stoked diplomatic confrontations with the netherlands and germany in recent weeks . 
  such an appeal to the turkish nationalist electorate that traditionally follows the mhp party , one of four represented in turkey 's parliament , is indispensable for mr. erdogan 's referendum plans . 
  he managed to pass the referendum legislation , which required the support of three-fifths of lawmakers , only thanks to a new alliance with the mhp 's leadership . 
  that parliamentary support has yet to translate into backing by actual mhp voters , cautioned former mhp lawmaker sinan ogan , who is opposed to the proposals . 
  the mhp secured 11.9 % of votes in turkey 's most recent elections , in november 2015 , and represents a critical swing constituency . 
  `` the key to the referendum is now with mhp , '' said mr. ogan . 
  `` and in mhp , the top says ` yes ' and the grass-roots say ` no . ' '' write to yaroslav trofimov at yaroslav.trofimov@wsj.com, 
  welp , at least he admitted who bombed the people between june 7th elections and november 1st elections . 
  to inform other people . 
   i think he might be arrested both for the video and his account . 
  they want to say `` look , this is an islamophobe , fet\u00d6 sympathiser . 
  they are the ones who want you to say no '' think about sera kad\u0131gil . 
  she had been detained and questioned for tweets he texted 7 years ago but the real reason she got detained because this [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jyu-kaxvd0 ) . 
  what i am trying to say ? 
  people say mean things but the govt do n't use it until those people talk in opposed to akp/yes/erdo / whatever they support , they detain/arrest people under the pretext of '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' `` crimes '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' like insulting erdo , muslims etc. 
  meaningless buzzword thingies . 
   but , on the other side , he is a law student . 
  is he that stupid to expose his true identity with that account ? 
  why did he do that ? 
  because he said he can not reach to the people as whole as an anonymous twitter account so he unrevealed him in a video for `` no '' campaign . 
  he reached his goal , the video got viral . 
  now he has been arrested so the video got viral even more \u00e0 la streisand effect-kinda . 
  please , we both live in the same country . 
  you can not be that naive to think that this guy has been arrested for saying mean things to the glorious leader or muslims or whatever . 
  if so , they could 've threw him in jail as early as july , not right after he recorded a video and it got viral . 
  well he knew he was going to be arrested . 
  he said on the video that `` if that video goes viral , we 'll be arrested '' . 
  the govt suppose that they can make people afraid of & obey itself by throwing people to the jail , cringe . 
  \\  all that damage control and shilling \\  posting tweet from an infamous aktroll 0.63 has been deposited into your account . 
  charming . 
  i heard that akp tried to infiltrate and eventually take over h\u00d6h but failed , then they establish a new party `` dost '' . 
  is that true ? 
  if so , akp officials are so fucking dumb to expect votes from bg turks lmao all balkan turks hate them with passion . 
  believe me he most likely tried to do so for 15 consecutive years . 
  after a certain point , you just give up because it becomes unbearable . 
  i hope it happens but how can europe resettle 15 m + people ? 
  our govt is too dumb to conspire . 
  maybe a fake invasion but not an actual war . 
  he can also cancel the referendum because `` no '' is leading by a margin polls . 
  erdo does n't like to be defeated so , connect the dots . 
  wish i was that optimistic like you . 
  beautiful . 
  so what 's our alternative to this ? 
  they can form another party anytime , those who like them but do n't want to vote for mhp can not be easily ignored . 
  then mhp dissidents form a new party with some chp members and kemalists like muharrem \u0130nce , \u00dcmit kocasakal , mhp will be under threshold . 
   erdogan seem less like the leader of a government than an occupation . 
  now you know what the dissident part of the nation thinks about him , hence why people do n't like whatever he does . 
  erdo has been a leader of his voterbase , not else . 
  all he does is to please his voterbase , he does n't give a fuck about those who do n't vote for him and vice versa . 
  edit :  if you 're so divided , what 's even keeping istanbul ( and to a lesser extent , izmir and ankara ) as parts of turkey ? 
  nationalism and s\u00e8vres syndrome are the reasons to be together . 
  and then retarded akp supporters blame us for loss of imaginary millions of dollars or some destroyed 2-3 busses . 
  never mention to those arrested , injured & killed and when they do , they just say they 're terrorists . 
  yes they call all that 7.5 million people terrorists . 
  gezi park protests is the biggest event that divided country to the point that there 's no return . 
  erdo is not hugo chavez , turkey is not venezuela . 
  more like pandora 's box . 
  for average of the polls during the time , [ here ] ( http://www.jamesinturkey.com/elections/turkeys-executive-presidency-referendum-2017/ ) . 
  for the latest poll , [ here ] ( http://www.mynet.com/haber/guncel/avrasya-arastirmadan-2017-referandum-anketi-sonucu-2923665-1 ) . 
  - yes : 42.43 no : 57.57, 
  volunteers who monitor the whole election process . 
  volunteering for the elections are dead serious among the opposition people since 2014 local elections and akp 's voting fraud . 
  in june 7th elections , many people have volunteered to monitor the elections due to fear of removing hdp 's votes to keep them under threshold . 
  even if they planned to do something , they failed . 
  hence hdp got % 13 in that election . 
  believe me nobody will leave the ballot boxes to those people in a ** very ** important referendum which the fate of the country 's democracy and liberty will be sailed . 
  well , he does n't seem like he would be ok with `` no '' victory . 
  otherwise he would n't try everything to cause a diplomatic crisis to gain votes , desperately . 
  also he insults `` no '' voters , which is good thing . 
  he does n't insult people when he leads on the polls , he mock them . 
  people who lived through an authoritarian regime would understand me better , those kind of leaders will lose everything in the moment they lose the situation . 
  be it war or election or whatever . 
  their cronies , their voterbase , their `` allies '' , everything . 
  and losing the referendum will start of his ending , hopefully . 
   let 's assume that in a `` no '' case , what would change ? 
  would people who support akp vote for chp ? 
  would people who support mhp vote for chp ? 
  akp voters will continue to vote for akp , mhp voters will continue to vote mhp and chp voters will continue to vote for chp . 
  this situation is the exact same as the current situation . 
  akp voters are lost cause . 
  nobody want to get their votes . 
  but that 's not a case for mhp & chp voters . 
  in coastlines and big cities , those 2 voterbase are so similar due to common value for secularism . 
  potential `` no '' win will give us hope , something all the opposition is badly need . 
  i think people ignore that hope factor .
