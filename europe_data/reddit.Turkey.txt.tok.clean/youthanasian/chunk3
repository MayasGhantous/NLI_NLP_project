  edit : for contrast , they did n't even attacked 2013 pride , when it was mixed with gezi park protests . 
  it 's ** not ** because of ramadan . 
  istanbul pride 2014 was being held during ramadan and police did n't do nothing . 
  i was in taksim today . 
  the first thing i paid attention to was the number of cops . 
  there were * way * too many cops comparing to 2014 pride . 
  suddenly fired water cannons to the people and did everything to disperse the people for ** still ** an unknown reason . 
  i did n't know that our immigrants are * that * open-minded . 
  sounds cancerous . 
  in south of the us , gang members kill gang members . 
  in south of turkey , durkas kill civilians . 
  good luck with that , then . 
  do n't know . 
  akp is on decline right now , chp and hdp are pro-lgbt parties in the parliament . 
  this is turkey , everything can happen . 
  how dare you criticise the members of the religion of peace ** \u2122 ** ? 
  [ gay marriage ? 
  gay people can marry in texas while people behead other people for religious stuff in the south of our border . 
  what a place to live in . 
   when you detonate a bomb it 's not like it only kills the non-believers . 
  they only see themselves as muslim and the army of islam and the others as heretic . 
  it does n't matter if they 're christian , shia muslim , sunni muslim who does n't support isis , other islamist organisation member etc. 
   isis is conducting a genocide against their own people . 
  isis see * that * * people * as hypocrites . 
  hypocrites are the most sinners according to qur ` an , even worse than being heretic . 
  probably is wanted to show that they 're still strong ... 
  in their way . 
  i do n't understand why someone converts to islam . 
  so it 's confirmed that there will be right-wing government and left-wing opposition . 
  i hope akp-mhp coalition wo n't be as cancerous as akp majority rule . 
  because they 're conservative and chp is a social democrat party . 
  they became non-violent after bah\u00e7eli came to power . 
  his biggest success is keeping them from streets . 
  they 're still far right but they can not be compared with , for example , golden dawn . 
  they have 2 types of voters . 
  metropolitan city mhp voters generally close to chp because anti-akp stuff in general . 
  meanwhile in rural areas , mhp voters close to akp because of turk-islam syntesis thingy . 
  there 's % 80 chance of akp-mhp coalition . 
  mhp rejects any form of government which hdp supports . 
  fucking rightists , man . 
  so are we doomed or what ? 
  is there compulsory voting in denmark ? 
  i wonder because % 80-90 rate is very high for an european country . 
  ( considering uk election turnout was % 66 . 
  should we expect a high turnout rate in that election ? 
   i think it could be relative . 
  korea and japan are culturally closer to each other and china than they are to india or pakistan . 
  but tell someone from japan there is little difference between them and the chinese and you may end up with a katana to the face . 
  you 're right , same thing happens with greece and turkey . 
  people may dislike each other but there are lots of things in common , unlike arabs and turks . 
   as a dutchman i 'd be more comfortable absorbing and integrating danish , german , english , french , norse , swedish , irish , scottish immigrants/refugees than i am with immigrants/refugees from africa , the middle-east or asia . 
  there is simply a bigger chance of successful integration and less of a culture difference . 
  right but you suppose that living in the same region = having the same culture while it is n't . 
  turkish culture has been affected by greek and persian culture since 1071 . 
  we generally traded with them , we generally fought against them . 
  meanwhile both ottoman and republic of turkey were n't in touch with arabs ( except hejaz region ) . 
  i said having the same religion does n't make us relative because you can see the difference between the way we live our religion and their way for example . 
   anyway , i could be wrong and maybe i 'm just racist . 
  just my two cents . 
  personally i 'd rather not absorb/integrate syrian refugees and just keep them in the local area , the closest safe area to be specific . 
  europe should send ( more ) money , supplies and manpower to help the turks deal with this though . 
  having 2 + million syrian refugees really harm the economy so some financial aid would be really good . 
  let me tell you about your people : the post . 
  mhp are really against syrian refugees and support of islamic organisations in syria ( i.e. 
  isis , al nusra ) so if they form a coalition , turkey wo n't take refugees anymore and try to send them back in civil way as much as possible imo . 
  there 's no cultural relation between turks and syrians/iraqis/arabs in general . 
  our only neighbour countries that we have similar culture with are iran , azerbaijan and greece . 
  common religion and history do n't make us relative . 
  so the german/dutch thingy does n't make sense here . 
   could you please tell me more about erdogan 's service to the turkish people/turkey ? 
  getting rid of inflation , increasing tourism rate , upgrading healthcare system , building roads , state hospitals , organised industrial zones and providing employment , increasing the gdp per capita from 3.492 $ to 19.610 $ , turning that irrelevant country into well-known tourist-attractive country etc. 
  those were the main reasons for the majority of his voters . 
  his voters do n't vote for ideologic purposes , never done . 
   i genuinely do n't know much about him except the fact that he has fairly islamic views , so if you have a bit of time , i 'd love to hear how he improved turkey . 
  he has fairly islamic views , he always has but the difference is he was doing something good back then and people voted for him . 
  now he has nothing to offer to the people besides holding qur ` an and allah akbaring 7/24 . 
  he possibly thinks that the overwhelmingly majority of his voters vote for him because of islamism/conservatism while it 's just the opposite . 
  another turkish person here . 
   what is the general opinion of erdogan in turkey ? 
  '' * he * * really * * did * * so * * many * * good * * things * * for * * turkey * . 
  * he * * improved * * the * * country * * a * * lot * * but * * he * * has * * changed * . 
  * but * * he * * has * * changed * , * he 's * * now * * corrupt * , * only * * thinks * * himself * * and * * he * * really * * should n't * * have * * built * * that * * palace * . '', 
  this is what non-partisan average person in turkey thinks about him . 
  the majority of him/his party voters voted for him for his service , not for his islamic views . 
  but he still ignores that fact and try to gain votes by using islamic terminology and holding qur ` an . 
   he 's in power for a reason of course but do n't they notice the wrongdoings ? 
  depends on what you consider as wrongdoing . 
  european and american media usually accuse him of violating human rights and press freedom but in turkey , people generally do n't care about it . 
  economical issues and failures are more important for the people . 
  for example people reacted a lot more to the construction of * that * palace in atat\u00fcrk forest farm while there are 5 million people who work for minimum wage ( 949 tl = 348 us dollar per month . 
  prostitution is legal in turkey but it 's not a big issue here . 
  people just know that it 's legal and that 's all . 
  i think current government should keep it as it is . 
  as if turkey will be accepted to eu . 
  i wonder what exactly they call while there 's no government right now . 
  i do n't get the fear of mhp and its supporters . 
  yes they were really dangerous but it was in pre-coup era . 
  the grey wolves thingy is almost dead . 
  also the intelligence service use their name to kill kurds and cover themselves since 95 . 
  akp is far rightist than mhp if you ask me .
