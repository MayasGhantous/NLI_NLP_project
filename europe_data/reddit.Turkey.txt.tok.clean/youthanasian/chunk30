  also the situation will not be the exact same . 
  `` no '' victory will be a big fuck you to erdo , also that will be his first defeat in his 15 years of ruling . 
  ( akp was still the biggest party in june 7th elections so i do n't count it . ), 
  about supporting parties , a secular centre-right candidate like meral ak\u015fener can do wonders . 
   as for presidential election , erdogan is the top winner . 
  who would be your choice as his opponent ? 
  savak pavey ? 
  justin bieber ? 
  yeah , i also thought that . 
  do n't know who could win against him . 
   also , do n't forget that after the coup attempt , mhp and akp are basically fellow parties . 
  supporters of both parties would vote for erdogan , while chp would still be in search for a `` good-enough '' candidate . 
  party executives maybe . 
  mhp electorate is n't ok with neither akp nor mhp being close to akp . 
  most of them will vote `` no '' as polls show . 
  it 's anecdotal evidence , i know but none of my mhp voter friends will vote for `` no '' . 
   and even if mhp had a change to its leadership etc. 
  mhp supporters will never vote for chp . 
  so if you are hoping for a government where only chp is , then my condolences to your hope . 
  i do n't hope for chp government , i only want erdo and his party to gone . 
  the rest can be done later . 
  do n't be hopeless . 
   source : taner ak\u00e7am yeah , no thanks . 
  provide me source from reliable turkish historians or do n't do at all . 
  * in an election where 2 candidates were islamist and the other had ties with pkk . 
   ultra-nationalists define nationalism , nationalist , ultra-nationalist and ultra-nationalism . 
   one-party dictatorship !, 
  that one-party dictatorship brought turkey the highest economic growth rate in the history of turkish republic . 
  also women gained many rights during that era , islamists were revolting and being crashed in the second , personal freedom was well protected by the judiciary . 
  ** short answer : ** yes ** long answer : ** nowadays the opposition is hopeless , dissidents are hopeless . 
  everyone who is n't erdo supporter think everything will stay or will go worse so they are either try to live another life in abroad or stay here and adopt the reality . 
  on the other hand erdo and his voterbase have high self-confidence and think the whole state revolves around them ( which is true ) . 
  opposition parties are joke , no opposition leader give confidence to their own voterbase , let alone regular electorate . 
  so what if no wins ; dissidents will be no more hopeless because erdo went all-out during the referendum campaign and he lost . 
  the clowns around him and his voterbase will drop him in the moment they see he does n't hold the power . 
  typical authoritarian regime thingies , you know . 
  opposition parties ( especially mhp ) will have a leader change because the victory will be gained even though their pacifism . 
  mhp leader 's fate would be even worse because he went for `` yes '' meanwhile the whole voterbase and provincial party leadership went for `` no '' . 
  potential `` no '' result will turn the tide in favour of `` no '' campaigners like mhp dissidents , chp members , several people etc ; so the result will cause an early election . 
  why so butthurt tho ? 
  % 50 +1 oppressing % 50-1 is tyranny of the majority , like what 's happening in tr . 
  i hate using godwin 's law and hesitate to use it as much as possible but this time it fits the situation . 
  the referendum question is clear : `` do you want weimar republic to transform into nazi germany ? '', 
  it 's an all-out referendum for both sides ; `` yes '' will end democracy , `` no '' will end current tyranny . 
  normally i doubt it but since we 're talking about erdo\u011fan , it might be true . 
  however , our sane immigrants in europe feel insecure after akp supporters riot due to deportation risks and so on . 
  therefore this means the turnout for referendum abroad may be even lower than average ( 30 % ) . 
  this plan does n't look good for another thing and that 's the turnout . 
  turnout in europe is generally 30-35 % whereas back in home it 's 85 % + , so i do n't really think their vote will be that crucial . 
  horrible but at least erdo ca n't deceive people as he did for years . 
  for example , all that jazz with netherlands has little to no effect on referendum votes , as far as i see . 
  that 's a developement . 
  yeah yeah , real knowledge with full of buzzwords . 
  he quotes from mustafa akyol lol , fucking psuedo-liberal akp supporter islamist became the authority on kemalism in the eyes of that redditor . 
  they are still liberal and pro-european . 
  but in a country where mp 's , mayors , journalists , dissidents are being jailed for opposing the government and the general population is \u00fcber dumb ; that 's what you have to do . 
  otherwise akp will use it to show all `` no '' voters as unpatriotic western-stooge . 
  yes , yes i know that 's looks like something out of 1984 but that 's how we roll , sadly . 
  do you really have to post this in every turkey-related thing ? 
  hahahah well yeah like you do n't keep half of the nation hostage . 
  bitch , you literally treat us like captives just because we do n't vote for you . 
  ( god forbids if we do ), 
  ca n't imagine how happy wilders is right now . 
  it 's pravda of akp . 
  because when you say `` everyone '' , you say islamists , kurds who want to establish sharia state and kurds who still live in feudal era . 
  turkey did n't become `` the most progressive state of middle east '' ( i 'm talking about pre-erdo era of course ) with said liberal values , it became with jacobinism . 
  nah i do n't want government to pet him with my taxes . 
  he deserves to be next caucescu or ghaddafi . 
  tyranny at home , laughing stock abroad . 
  hijab became mandatory in 1982-83 , islamic republic has been established in late ' 80 's . 
  so in this photo , it 's either shah or interim government on power . 
  nice call !, 
  ** attention ** : do n't read video comments . 
  go to turkish embassy & consulates in your country to vote . 
  as far as i know , each country 's turkish embassy has different week to vote . 
  nah , that 's better . 
  tr is not usa . 
  no-one ? 
   it 's called the `` women 's march . '', 
  i do n't speak arabic , but that 's not what it would be called if the turks named it . 
   i do n't speak arabic how to trigger turks 101 . 
   hillary clinton has inspired european women to take a more active role in society , like thinking that someday a woman could be head of state . 
  clinton has inspired nothing . 
  this march was held by women on international women 's day . 
  what it should 've been called ? 
  women 's march is n't something new , or something american . 
  it has been held by every nation throughout the history . 
  maybe they see them non-political ( non-political means not dangerous for the regime here ) , maybe they do n't want to look bad right after whining for freedom of expression , human rights bla bla in germany . 
  i do n't know . 
  well , technically it 's just a women 's march which held on yesterday ( march 8th ) ; pratically , this march was also a way to express one 's opposition to the govt . 
  so you can find many signs mentions directly or indirectly to the upcoming referendum . 
  even in this era of oppression , they could n't silence us altogether . 
  there were more women in istiklal ave today than they could ever gather . 
  also `` hay\u0131r / no to '' being bold is a good message . 
  i 'd love to be just harassed and trolled for criticising the govt . 
  the whole farce was to trick opposition to side with germany , the opposition did n't bite the bait , so they do n't know what they 're doing right now . 
  mayyyyyyyyyyybe for turks in europe but i do n't see any type of `` boost '' here . 
  except he 's turk himself . 
  after witnessing their electoral fraud in previous elections , they do n't need even electorate to win elections lol . 
  integrated ones have already denounced their turkish citizenship , i guess .
