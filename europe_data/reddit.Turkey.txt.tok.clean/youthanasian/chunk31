  i 'd do in a second if i live in another country and have that country 's citizenship . 
  mindless drones will continue to love him even if he decides to raze a city . 
  that 's not a thing . 
  reputation is about getting respect of those who do n't vote for you . 
  cultural differences are the main factor . 
   domestic reputation is all he cares about . 
  is there any ? 
  i mean , at least half of the nation hates him to the guts and do n't see as their president . 
  i 'd not call it reputation . 
  wish it was the general consensus for the majority of turks in germany , then again they would n't vote for him if they thought like that . 
  pis seems like akp to me . 
  i think it 's due to polarisation and the way the country is going . 
  those who oppose it are losing the loyality to the nationality & country day by day if they have n't lost it yet . 
  edit : i forgot to mention that anyone who does n't support the regime gets insults like traitor or a western-stooge etc. 
  daily , so that 's also a factor . 
  menshevik internationalist , hmm . 
  i 'm in the center of left-right and closer to the democratic . 
  doubt it . 
  you took illiterate peasants from eastern anatolia to meet your unskilled workforce . 
  then those illiterate peasants create ghettos , then became ultimate assholes to both turks in turkey and germans . 
  of course there are some integrated ones but we would not have talked about this issue if they were all integrated well like other immigrants in germany . 
  we all ask this question to them for a while , we have n't received a proper answer yet . 
  well except those who want to migrate elsewhere have already tried to stay and fix things for years . 
  i posted it due to their success in june 2015 election and 2014 presidential election . 
   and honestly the danger still remains even with a no victory , what will erdo do then ? 
  cry in his 1000-room palace . 
  a research centre who got the closest results for june 7th general election and 2014 presidential election . 
   the question that 's going to be asked in the referendum . 
  how exactly is it going to be phrased ? 
  do you know the exact phrase already ? 
  nothing will be asked , as far as i know . 
  they will give a you a paper which the half is for yes and the other half is for no . 
  you stump the vote seal on what you decide . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.diken.com.tr/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/referandum.jpg ) . 
  0.63 have been deposited into your account . 
  what question ? 
  every polling thingy got the nov 1st election wrong . 
  that 's the most important thing which makes nov 1st election fishy to begin with . 
  remember the all that conversation after the election . 
  so i ca n't really blame them to got it wrong . 
  mak and orc is not trustworthy at all . 
  their polling for june 7th still in mind . 
  i do n't know . 
  i 'm not a german citizen , i do n't live in germany . 
  it 's up to germans to whether make pressure on merkel about this issue . 
   well , does this poll include the thousands of extra votes from overseas that will surely go to erdogan as well ? 
  no it is n't . 
  hell , he 'll start this referendum with 1.000.000 votes in favour . 
  lower the turnout for austria , belgium , france , germany , the better . 
  also higher the turnout for united kingdom , scandinavia , us & canada , the better . 
  do n't know , do n't care . 
  both june 7th and november 1st elections were well monitored by the volunteers . 
  do n't think people will leave the ballot boxes unsecure in this ** very ** important referendum . 
  what we need is a lead , be it % 50 +1 or % 75 . 
  % 75 would be pretty `` in your face '' to erdo though . 
   do you live in turkey ? 
  yes . 
  hopelessness caused by frustration is more serious problem than fear here because , you know , what is left to lose anyway ? 
  naaah fear is n't that strong , more like anger and frustration . 
  because dissidents think like that ; `` everything will stay as it is and i 'll waste my life for nothing , so why even trying ? 
  migrating elsewhere is more logical . '', 
  people got used to suppression . 
  after a certain point , it 's meaningless to declare your discomfort because you see it does n't change anything . 
  yes . 
  [ source . 
  i can confirm . 
  it 's hard as hell to say `` i 'll vote no '' , even harder for campaigning for `` no '' . 
  hope so . 
  i do n't know , you tell [ me .

  what was our sin to have this thing ? 
  lol they seriously think those kind of cheap ass propaganda movies will trick us . 
  fucking retards . 
  the first one is also pro-erdo propaganda , lol . 
   turkeys society is in fact durable and stable . 
  oh my sweet summer child . 
  \\  tfw those people made it to europe and you still stuck in here . 
   the ottomans never truly united the muslims like the early caliphs did . 
  what kind of unity ? 
  3 out of the first four caliphs have been assasinated . 
  i mean , they killed caliphs who had heralded with the paradise by the god . 
  not to mention to the war between ali ( mohammad 's selected brother ) and aisha ( mohammad 's wife ) after mohammad 's death . 
  even those kind of people could n't unite islamic world . 
  let alone some modernised non-arab . 
  constantinople means constantin 's city , istanbul means `` the city '' in greek afaik . 
  both are badass . 
   what parties are against this ? 
  the terrible coup attempt really was a gift from god ( for him ) chp , hdp , mhp dissidents , sp , almost every single opposition party outside of parliament . 
  you can see them from [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_constitutional_referendum,_2017#campaign_positions ) . 
  then think about what he could do if the proposed presidential system give him the power to do whatever he wants , ** legally ** . 
  more like gambian presidential one . 
  in proposed presidential system , president has a right to declare state of emergency , abolish parliament , directly appoint ministers etc. 
  interestingly , as seen on image , yesterday erdo asked pro-govt pollsters ( you can see who they are from their `` results '' to stop conducting polls . 
  results are really bad for him , i suppose ? 
  well that 's the plan but it does n't go well in erdo 's way as polls show . 
  long answer , [ here ] ( http://www.jamesinturkey.com/explainer-turkeys-new-presidential-system/ ) . 
  short answer : `` do you want president to increase his/her executive powers ? '',
