  because everyday i see a new poll about french elections . 
  i hope time will prove that i 'm wrong , i really do . 
  the earth does n't need another erdo . 
  except trump is ruling the country for 3 months meanwhile erdo does it for 15 consecutive years . 
  erdo seemed like a lot democratic in 2003 than trump now . 
  do n't be sure . 
   so , turks are n't falling for the authoritarian pretentions of erdogan ? 
  do n't be sure . 
  he controls the media . 
  they provocating the `` no '' camp like there 's no tomorrow but `` no '' camp give them no response . 
  i hope we will win that weird kind of chess . 
   and what 's the general opinion about the coup in turkey ? 
  divided . 
  it 's a big empty space for non-akp voter people . 
  an islamic cult vs erdo , i mean . 
  it was clear that whoever won , we lost . 
  akp voters compare that coup and their resistance against it to our war of independence lol . 
   the last thing about it that appeared in the news here was that erdogan was taking advantage of the coup to do a purge . 
  nothing bad about erdo is appeared in our media . 
  that 's what is important . 
  istanbul is the most liberal by population , izmir is the most liberal by ratio . 
  to be honest , izmir is far more liberal than istanbul . 
  yes , very bad pattern . 
  istanbul has never gone red since huge migration from inner anatolia in 80 's . 
  economic crisis & coalition government being incompetent & erdo being anti-establishment . 
  check poll results from [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_constitutional_referendum,_2017#opinion_polls ) 2 . 
  read the article . 
  connect the dots . 
  yeah because both are mental illness . 
  extremely isolated community + only pro-govt media to broadcast abroad + not experiencing what 's like to live under erdo 's rule . 
  this mysterious formula gives you a society which believes whatever you tell them . 
  it 's not like they jump on the border fence and claim asylum . 
  they 're diplomats , they 're already there . 
  interesting . 
  interesting because in turkey , the youth overwhelmingly vote and support left-wing . 
  what is or are the motivation ( s ) behind the youth to vote for her ? 
  because , in general , youth vote for left . 
  now you know why erdo still is the president . 
  turkey and russia did n't feel like they need to reform the government because who needs reform when you can just conquer and take all the goods , right ? 
  this is also the main source of `` good ol' days '' nostalgia . 
  people choose to live in the good and wealthy past instead of facing the reality of present . 
  well , better than killing each other i guess . 
  sometimes i wonder how tito kept these nations together until his death . 
  that 's not the point . 
  the point is sweden etc. 
  have a very well system and institutions so regardless of whatever party comes into the power , regular citizen 's life not much affected by it . 
  on the other hand this referendum is about `` do you want erdo to be dictator for life ? '' . 
  i hope you get the difference . 
  we fell to populism before it was cool . 
  man we all try to find out why there 's so much support for him in every way for 15 years . 
  if we have n't found out yet , i do n't think you will . 
  i do n't know why would someone with a sane mind boycott this referendum as if we live in sweden or somewhere . 
  for ** akp ** voters : ** yes 80 % , no 20 % ** for ** mhp ** voters : ** no 70 % , yes 30 % ** for ** chp ** voters : ** no 93 % , boycott 7 % ** related news link : http://www.birgun.net/haber-detay/latest-poll-results-on-upcoming-referendum-in-turkey-no-votes-are-expected-to-be-higher-145762.html, 
  those who will vote for yes do n't know why they will say yes . 
  it 's depressing as fuck but a good number of them can be conceived to vote no with a decent propaganda . 
   as an aside , how is it going in that regard in turkey these days ? 
  interesting . 
  every people from every political view has a reason to oppose the presidential system . 
  be it dictatorship or fear of division of turkey . 
   when is the referendum due ? 
  april 2nd or april 9th . 
   what is the mhp 's stance on giving him presidential powers ? 
  bah\u00e7eli and the mps support the presidential system , however , both the upper circle and his voterbase ( that 's important ) oppose it . 
   how close are the polls ? 
  roller-coaster i 'd say . 
  pro-govt pollsters show yes choice is leading with % 55-60 while anti-govt-ish pollsters show no choice leading with % 45-55 . 
  [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_constitutional_referendum,_2017#opinion_polls ) 's the link . 
  so the referandum polls are n't go in akp 's way , i suppose ? 
  good . 
  they 're badly in need of nationalist votes and in the current situation they will overwhelmingly vote for no . 
  i hope nationalists are aware of that the whole pee race is to trick them to vote yes . 
  and the stability has been dropped to 1 . 
  because it 's a way cheaper/affordable than western european countries . 
  winged hussars . 
  adampol village . 
  ali ufk\u00ee bey . 
  they got partitioned but ottoman had n't recognised the partition . 
  conservative catholic people . 
  favourite country for turkish erasmus students . 
  that 's heresy !, 
  i did n't say they 'll be killed immediately . 
  i tried to say that prisoners are getting tortured , badly , and when some of them die caused by it , they announce it was a suicide . 
  plus , you ca n't get much information about the situation of prisoners due to media pressure from the government . 
  if it was n't for our some friends ' relative who 's in prison , i also would n't have known that much thing . 
  so since it 's clear as day that those 8 soldiers ' lives are in danger in turkey , they wo n't get a fair trial in turkey and they 'll be tortured in the minute they 're in prison ; they 're wordbook meaning of refugee . 
  nothing can be worse than first balkan war and the trauma caused by it . 
  hope you 're right , however what i 've heard from prisons is n't compatible with what you say . 
  why would n't ? 
  erdo brought up the capital punishment talk after the coup attempt , he obviously wants them dead . 
  he 's not ok with them being in prison . 
  ofc killing no . 
  they all committed suicide in the prison all of a sudden . 
  correct decision . 
  if they were extradicted they would 've been beaten like there 's no tomorrow and 4 days later there would be news that those 8 soldiers `` committed suicide in the prison '' . 
  i mean , fleeing the country due to life danger is literal meaning of being refugee . 
  every nation gets the government it deserves . 
  short answer : yes long answer : learned helplessness is real thing among the turkish people . 
  i mean , half of the people think the other half wo n't change and the government will not fall regardless of whatever they do , so demonstrating against the government is pointless because the government will do what they do , its voters will vote regardless . 
  so why bother ? 
  the youth try to escape from turkey as soon as possible .
