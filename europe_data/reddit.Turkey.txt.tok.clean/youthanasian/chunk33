  enjoy spending time in prison where there 's no allah and muhammad took leave . 
  who needs evolutionary process of the living creatures when you are able to say `` allah says `` be '' and it is . '', 
  people calling other people `` dickhead '' is ok but me calling them `` towelhead '' is a problem ? 
  how can those towelheads end up with swiss citizenship while it 's really hard for an ordinary turkish citizen to get swiss visa , let alone citizenship ? 
  turkey is n't a city-state . 
  better not say . 
  so ended up with vnl , inform me pls . 
  because sham is arabic while levant is english & french . 
  to be honest , a good amount of muslims condemn fellow muslims for becoming `` westernized '' , actually they call them infidel , not muslims . 
  also those muslims are pretty ok with enslaving yazidi women . 
  ca n't solve the radical islamist problem without understanding the manpower resource . 
  define `` they '' first . 
   so , muslims attacking other muslims for not being muslim enough . 
  middle east 101 . 
  the attacker was a policeman . 
  holy fuck . 
  outside world being ignorant does n't make us similar . 
  you can also say that chinese , korean and japanese have similar cultures by looking at their location and it only shows how ignorant you are . 
  mena is a different place where arabs do n't have cultural unity on their own , let alone the whole region and the nations in it . 
   actually in line with them culturally lol wat teh fuq ? 
  for 500 years european states has fought each other for various reasons , today they cooperate . 
  past is in the past , future is the issue . 
   that 's because the territories it lost did n't have hungarians as the majority population , transylvania had romanians etc etc , now separate from the austrians even if the hungarians would take back territories they 'd have to deal not only with their neighbors that got them but with rebellions in the newly `` liberated '' territories . 
  i mean , why did n't hungarians in lands where seperated from hungary via this treaty start an uprising . 
  i was n't talking about hungarians in hungary . 
   so to put it in perspective with your own country 's history why did n't the turks have uprising to get back egypt when it had been under their direct control for a lot of time and had been a tributary state before 1914 ? 
  similar subject is mosul , not egypt . 
  and ankara government tried to take control of the province but failed . 
  serious question : why did n't hungarians reject the treaty and simply start an uprising like we turks did after armistice of mudros and especially after treaty of s\u00e8vres ? 
  generals maybe , not the whole army . 
  generals also supported the government prior to '60 coup , it could n't stop the coup . 
  normally i 'd say it 's impossible but we 're talking about erdo so i do n't know . 
  who cares ? 
  this is not a kingdom , he 's not absolute monarch , the army does n't belong to him and we 're not his subjects . 
  he can go and fight by his own in syria if he really wants to topple assad . 
  him using taf is what makes me mad . 
   is turkey capable for such a war . 
  it 's pretty much russia & trump 's usa vs erdoland at this point . 
   do n't get me wrong you guys have a pretty respectable military force but is it that smart to fight the assad regime under the current circumstances ? 
  having respectable army does n't justify actions . 
  first of all it 's not our business to remove someone from power and replace someone with him . 
  second , assad is well supported by russia , china and iran ; an alliance erdo shows as an alternative to eu , pay attention . 
  fucking up the relations with both russia and eu will bite you in the ass sooner or later . 
  disgusting day . 
  the turnout for youth should be like 75-80 % considering we have very high turnout in every elections . 
  they 'll try again on tuesday , we need to gather the people as much as we can around the parliament to show public opposition . 
  at least you should 've built walls before saying that . 
  psychological high ground . 
  `` i kill you even in places you consider safe . '', 
  never ever starts a war , always defends herself with annexation . 
  erdo knows without his `` enemies '' , turkish economy and then the whole system will collapse within a week . 
  purging everyone in the state and filling the positions with yesmen take time . 
  so in the end of the day he completely took control of the republic without a major response ( from military and judiciary ) hell , erdo 's party was too close to closed for being hotbed of anti-secularist movement but rejected 7 to 6 at constitutional court in 2007 . 
  i hope the nation of poland takes necessary steps before it 's too late . 
  i heard radiation is good for bones . 
  well it 's not really subject to interpretation . 
  makkah verses were tolerant and peaceful because muslims were in minority and did n't have much power . 
  pagans were also really strong . 
  after fleeing to madinah ( hijrah ) , verses becomes more jihadi , more about revenge , fighting , killing etc. 
  [ this ] ( http://koran-at-a-glance.com ) website shows that in detail . 
  i did n't say or mention that . 
  stalin demanded straits and kars-ardahan region from us during and after the ww2 . 
  actually that was the reason why we joined nato . 
  wrong example . 
  in christianity , it was clergy who made the religion dangerous for people . 
  after translation of bible , people started to read it and realised that clergy lied to them for years . 
  there was n't a problem in the bible . 
  on the other hand , qur ` an is clear and all translations are open to read . 
  qur ` an is a 7th century which advises not to be friends of christians & jews , kill infidels etc. 
  it can not be reformed . 
  islam is not a religion . 
  it was created by muhammad to unite arabic tribes under the same banner . 
  after islam , muhammad became extremely rich , got wifes and sex slaves . 
  after his death , infighting between his close circle began and that infighting never ended until today . 
  i repeat , islam is not a religion . 
  christianity , paganism , shintoism etc are religions . 
  islam is tool to spread bedouin culture of 7th century . 
  stalin ? 
  why would anyone erect his statue in turkey ? 
   yet these festivities still have support from ** rural towns ** ( and some ** elder people ** ) what 's with rural & elderly people and their backwardness ? 
  it 's like it 's a sociological norm everywhere . 
  media loves to call reactionaries `` nationalist '' these days . 
  they are wordbook definition of reactionary . 
  same shit , different smell . 
   when mom asks where all bulgarian turks between 1878 and 1989 go . 
  every nation occupies every land , no nation started to exist in the place they 're in now . 
  minorities , in a collaboration with several christian empires , wanted to wipe turks out of anatolia as balkanites did in balkans in 1913 . 
  tyt did n't want turks in anatolia to face the same fate with balkan turks so tyt wiped minorities out of anatolia . 
   they did n't want turks to vanish from the face of the earth , they just wanted them out of their land well that was the reason why young turk government forced armenians to resettle in syria & iraq . 
  in case you ever say armenian genocide . 
  how can we get rid of shitslam in democracy ? 
  well we lived our golden age under single-party government between 1923 - 1946 and democracy gave us georgian villager who fucks our country up for 15 consecutive years soo ... you are right . 
  tbh , comparing erdo 's little adorable dictatorship to soviet union is an insult to soviet union . 
  oh my favourite shitposter came again , at least change a sentence from that copy pasta . 
  [ here ] ( https://twitter.com/azyazarozyazarr/status/885909202832687104 ) is the article . 
  legends are n't written by 3g connection . 
  ( reference to erdo 's facetime talk ), 
  you are right . 
  western people think like that because ; 1 . 
  erdo is cartoon villain so kurds used that in syria to get sympathy .
