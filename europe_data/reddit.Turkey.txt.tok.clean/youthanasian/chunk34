  kurds are very good at pr so they continued the pr they built in syria . 
  they successfully posed themselves as the most important opposition to erdo . 
  main opposition was too too late for pr stuff so at least % 25 of people remained in shadow and isolated . 
  that 's why i 'm glad that opposition started to play the game but they are too late for this . 
  anyway , better late than never . 
  k\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu finally realised how to get attention of foreign media . 
  only if he started to do this years before . . 
  without us , pkk seperatists became `` the opposition '' in the eyes of western media . 
  also the article is perfect , i 'm glad our voices are heard now . 
   aksener poses a unique threat to erdogan because her brand of politics draws from a similar pool of pro-business , religious , and nationalist voters as the president . 
  she is unapologetically conservative , and has been called the turkish answer to french far-right leader marine le pen . 
  she is hawkish toward kurdish separatists . 
  she says she would allow turkey 's three million syrian refugees to remain in the country , but she has unspecified `` concerns '' about their presence . 
  still , she insists she can attract support from across the political spectrum , including kurds , noting her frequent campaign visits to the kurdish-majority southeast . 
  she also rejects any comparison between her style of politics and the racism of the european far right . 
  `` we do n't do politics based on race or ethnicity , '' she says . 
  `` our definition of the nation is based on shared memories , share ties , and shared joys . 
  that paragraph is problematic . 
  first of all le pen and ak\u015fener can not be compared . 
  le pen was a reaction to neo-liberal policies ( namely immigration and so on ) in france . 
  ak\u015fener is a reaction to erdo 's unbearable dictatorship and islamisation policy . 
  those two are different . 
  the rise of far-right in europe is reaction to neo-liberal & progressive movements and politics . 
  we have never witnessed neither neo-liberalism nor progressive movement for 15 consecutive years . 
  in fact we 're living in far-right hellhole for 5 years . 
  second , the author considers all kurds ( 18 million people ) have the same ideology and same goal , they do n't have . 
  they are really divided into ideologies which radical islamism and seperatism are the most common . 
  in western turkish urban cities like istanbul , ankara , \u0130zmir etc you have kurds supporting lots of ideologies . 
  by the way , it looks like the author tried to connect fighting pkk with being far-right . 
  she 's a nationalist , for sure she is hawkish on pkk . 
  rar-right : fucking muslims unzip our archives . 
  look at [ this ] ( https://twitter.com/koftibey/status/884188473292357632 ) flood then . 
  i do n't bother to explain . 
  political change can not happen overnight , political change is like avalanche . 
  rallies like this contribute this raw to become bigger and bigger . 
   all people outside hear about is only the secularism vs islamism struggle and little more . 
  progressivism would fit better . 
  secularism vs islamism struggle is new whereas progressivism vs conservativism or reactionary is 200 years old struggle . 
   but who in your view are the progressives of turkey ? 
  i consider someone or some group who want and try our nation to be adapted into 21st century 's norms and values `` progressive '' , and i consider someone or some group who rejects 21st century 's norms and values and idolise islamic values or turkish values from 2000 years ago `` conservative '' . 
  the area is 270.000 msq ( 140.000 msq general rally area with 130.000 msq entertainment area added ) the rest depends on how many people were there per metresquare . 
  police calculated it with 6 per msq , we calculated it with 8 . 
  hmmm ... we have n't achieved such progress . 
  during that period , turkey was ( and still is ) dealing with ideological struggles between conservatives and progressives so we could n't moved much for years . 
  that does n't mean it will continue forever . 
  eh well you should look at turkish history from tanzimat era to 2002 . 
  i can not summarise it . . 
  it was turkish anti-erdo\u011fan rally basically . 
  for article : [ here ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/09/world/europe/turkey-march-for-justice-istanbul.html?action=click&amp;contentcollection=world&amp;region=rank&amp;module=package&amp;version=highlights&amp;contentplacement=1&amp;pgtype=sectionfront ), 
  first , look at [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/a/xfysb ) . 
  now tell me , which name could fit better than `` justice '' when even mp 's of opposition parties are in jail ? 
  [ source ] ( https://turkeypurge.com ), 
  i 'm afraid you can not get it because all state institutions are politicised . 
  istanbul governorate announced that there were [ 175.000 people ] ( https://twitter.com/tc_istanbul/status/884176032554778624 ) in the area . 
  yes , they wrote this thing on ipad then took ss of it . 
  one may not believe organisators ' claims but one must not believe state 's claims . 
  you are right . 
  plus , russia and europe has never had good relations to begin with . 
  both were always rival/enemy to each other . 
  also when you add baltic & poland pressure to eu against russia , there 's no reason not to be openly against russia . 
  but turkey is different . 
  since tanzimat era , ottoman & turkey turned its face to europe , relations improved , culture integrated etc. 
  15 years of islamist rule can not destroy 200 years of westernisation . 
  idk ; since nobody trusts government statements and there was a consensus on near/at least 2 million people ( including kati piri 's tweet which is very important ) in the area , i wrote at least 2 million . 
  then ft got it wrong because that area is as large as 171 football field . 
  basic thinking : 171x100x50 = 855.000 kmsq . 
  if you add 2.5 people per kilometresquare , the number is 2.137.500 . 
  that 's why i said at least 2 million . 
  [ source . 
  ] ( http://www.sabah.com.tr/yasam/2013/04/21/maltepede-171-futbol-sahasi-kadar-miting-alani ) pro-government website said the rally area is equal to 171 football fields . 
   how come i can find no article about this ? 
  it 's not my fault if you can not use google  and from which ass did you pull out 2 million ? 
  simple . 
  there were lots of reports and tweets from mp 's that there are 2 + million people in the area , then police informed chp mps ' that [ there are 1.6 million people in the area ] ( https://twitter.com/tgmcelebi/status/884070699073253376 ) , then i saw kati piri 's [ tweet ] ( https://twitter.com/katipiri/status/884062076662157317 ) . 
  after all that , i said `` at least '' 2 million because there were people outside the area tried to entry when this photo taken . 
  okay ? 
   and wheres the comments in this post ? 
  ohhh , baby 's first reddit experience . 
   and why do you only post sub-news about turkey ? 
  because i live in this country and i 'm interested in this country . 
  okay ? 
   the `` justice march '' was praised by kati piri , the rapporteur for turkey at the european parliament , who described as `` historic '' the july 9 rally `` attended by nearly 2 million people who stand up for justice . '' [ source ] ( http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/july-9-marks-a-new-step-a-rebirth-main-opposition-leader-kilicdaroglu-says-at-justice-rally.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=115302&amp;newscatid=339 ), 
  eh ; considering some aktrolls on twitter claim there were 80.000 people in the rally , i 'd not be surprised . 
  even the police said 1.6 million people attended . 
  even the police . 
  imagine how many people attended . 
  too optimistic . 
  they would rather non-erdo-worshippers as the reason for sanctions and economic failure than drop erdo . 
  tbh it 's useless to talk about them since they are in minority and akp steal votes to get % 51 as we witnessed in referendum , local elections and so on . 
  i think people are not used to hear or see something about anti-erdo\u011fan folk . 
  i doubt most of people even think such folk exists ... 
  so when they see a photo like that , their reaction would be pessimistic ( like saying `` good , but that wo n't change anything . 
  erdo will be dictator for life '' etc. ), 
  because the perception about our country which created by both media and the government made foreign people to feel so . 
  seriously it 's just a 1 ( one ) person being dumb , not worth to have a debate on . 
  also we have lots of dumb people who squeeze orange to protest netherlands so i do n't think we 're in position to judge other people . 
  well it seems orban descended to the level of erdo so quick . 
   ataturk expelled most of the christian population in turkey to syria ( excluding the population exchange with greece ) . 
  i do n't know anything about turkish history : the post, 
  one way to do money laundring .
