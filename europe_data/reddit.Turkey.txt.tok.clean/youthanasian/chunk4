  hahaha that 's over man that 's over !, 
  this is it !, 
  chp is secular social democratic party . 
  their main vote bases are secularists , social democrats , kemalists . 
  plus they really worked hard during the election period which shows that they deserve the vote of people . 
  plus , their economic and social promises were really good and realistic for working class & poor strata . 
  that 's third time i vote . 
  my first vote was for chp as well . 
  i voted for chp . 
  i hope the best will happen . 
  pandora 's box has been opened . 
  by not letting them to go full durka . 
  [ those are ] ( https://sli.mg/4vd7ay ) what i get when i search `` neden t\u00fcrkiye '' , i do n't know where you got `` beautiful '' from . 
  to decrease brain drain maybe ? 
  western-oriented people generally want to migrate europe like 3x more than they want before their visit to europe . 
  visiting abroad is a marginal thing to do in turkey since average mehmet has to invest his whole annual revenue to get turkish passport + schengen visa + flight tickets + hotel reservation for a holiday in paris for 1 week . 
  i think if the deal works and we get visa-free travel , akp wo n't waste the opportunity and increase the price of passport even more . 
  no shit . 
  turkey does n't belong to any general culture ( say it european , middle eastern , asian culture etc. ) . 
  turkey has its own culture . 
  if anything , that culture gets closer to european one or middle eastern one . 
  turkey will never be fully european , it will never be fully middle eastern either . 
  yes , i mean how dare turks can be able to go to great britain , right ? 
  i was being sarcastic . 
  well ; indians , pakis , bangladeshis flooded your country without being in eu . 
  we would 've already flooded your country if we were `` 80 million people who wait on border to go to europe '' as some politicians said . 
  apart from cultural and political reasons , there 's no reason to migrate from here to elsewhere en masse . 
  shocking . 
   britain will have to open its doors for another 88 million people from turkey and the balkans if you decide to stay in the eu . 
  beautiful mind . 
  i wonder what drug they use to think that 80 million people will flood their country . 
  did whole population of romania and bulgaria flood your country ? 
  so why would turks ? 
  i understand cultural differences , religious differences . 
  i also understand rich-poor divide but i do n't understand this argument . 
  thank you switzerland . 
  same to us . 
  imo , [ a las barricadas ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op3w3wmqdwg ) fits better into the situation . 
  this is my homeland . 
  i was born , raised , went to school , had fun , fell in love with my ex , attended rallies , attended gezi park protests here . 
  i was happy , sad , exhausted , excited to be here . 
  this is my homeland , i do n't want to be foreign in a foreign country . 
  i want to live and die in my country , freely . 
  who the fuck cares about eu ? 
  no bullets as well . 
  what 's the point of living here if we ca n't even defend the most important principle of us ? 
  that 's ... an effective way to head the country into civil war . 
  sticking nose in our lives is n't enough for tayyip hence he started to stick nose in other countries ' domestic policy . 
  wish tayyip opponents in turkey and those fucktards had a chance to exchange citizenship . 
  it would be better for us , for them , for netherlands . 
  would n't be surprised if it turns out to be true . 
  so there 's no difference between turkey and germany when it comes to criticise tayyip . 
  nice . 
  at least no dutchman will be persecuted , face jail , lose job or be alienated for insulting tayyare . 
  but you can feel a bit what we experience everyday . 
   liberal turks in the netherlands are there any ? 
  last time i checked , akp got % 70 votes in netherlands . 
   i 've heard that turkey is becoming less moderate on the whole , with a turkish friend whom i know saying that erdogan would is destroying ataturk 's work all those decades ago . 
  semi true . 
  tayyip is destroying what atat\u00fcrk build but becoming less moderate ? 
  dude our headscarved girls drink more than average western-looking girls in western turkey . 
  i know how turkey is being shown in western media but we 're not becoming either iran or afghanistan . 
  old people are more conservative , non-theism is on rise among young people , so are liberal/left-wing ideals . 
  tayyip realised that and he does n't even use islamic rhetoric that much , he show himself as a nationalist for like 2-3 years . 
  i do n't think many middle easterner would prefer clinton over trump . 
  she 's too dangerous for the region . 
  i hate memorising . 
  grrr . 
   satire in both turkey and germany are likely to increase as a backlash to erdogan . 
  so the persecution and trials are also likely to increase , y' know . 
  bad move . 
  so our grand sultan can say that `` see ? 
  even in the western countries you like so much , the insult can not get away from punishment ! '', 
  or shit like that . 
  fyi , more than 2000 people have been persecuted for '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' insulting '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' the president since he elected . 
  he 'll definitely use merkel 's decision to look innocent good boi . 
  if they truly wanted to fight against extreme islam then they would go after saudi-funded mosques , islamic schools and sponsorship of islamic organisations without being afraid of called `` islamophobic '' or any buzzword . 
  i 've never felt that insecure before . 
  i love how putin and tayyip sound alike . 
  they both use same arguments , same accusations , same defamations . 
  except `` phobia '' part ( which i think tayyip will use it on following days ) , he used exact the same accusations and defamations on corruption scandal . 
  i think it has something to do with being religious authoritarian junk . 
  so they get citizenship and they 'll be settled near alevi villages in east and leftist secular towns in west therefore they 'll be able to both vote for akp and change the demographics in those areas . 
  that 's why tayyip had full of will to take those . 
  oh tayyip , you outdevil the devil . 
  why do right-wingers and germans have no sense of humour ? 
  it 's a `` pick your poison '' thing to choose between tayyip and coup . 
  also getting imprisoned is depend on reddit and their will to give my ip . 
  they can not do anything without ip or e-mail . 
  turkish channers insult ( i mean direct insult , not `` insult '' like criticism ) tayyip daily on 4chan and nobody got arrested by now . 
  yes and they failed to integrate/assimilate so those two unique cancerous life form find a place to fight each other . 
  that 's why i feel sorry . 
   grey wolves and pkk supporters i feel so sorry for germany . 
   erdogan 's increasingly aggressive and undemocratic behavior in turkey ding , ding !, 
  that 's the problem every western newspaper or magazine make . 
  he is n't increasingly aggressive and undemocratic , he ** has always been ** aggressive and undemocratic , acting like usa 's best friend does n't make him passive and democratic . 
  his islamic agenda caused [ republic protests ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republic_protests ) ( may also seen as proto-gezi park protests ) , le grand sultan \u2122 got angry about it and he started his own nuremberg trials on [ secularists ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ergenekon_trials ) and [ army ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sledgehammer_\\ ( coup_plan \\ ) ) . 
  the last barricade against his dictatorship was the jurisdiction and he also succesfully get rid of them via [ 2010 referendum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_constitutional_referendum,_2010 ) ( which he just did bullshit about `` freedom from coup remnants '' and not mentioned to change on jurisdiction . ), 
  so here we are now . 
  west 's precious baby has always been the same .
