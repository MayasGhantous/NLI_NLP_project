  looks modern af , i like it . 
   do you live in turkey yes , i do . 
   what 's the general view on him now after the bombings in istanbul and ankara ? 
  stayed as it is . 
  his fanboys ( aka those who got money & job from him ) continued to support him and blame attacks on everyone else , pro-opposition people blamed tayyip for all that mess , pro-opposition and pro-akp people cursed each other over tayyip and average mehmet was just afraid of what 's going on . 
  yes , he still blames everyone but himself . 
  nothing unifies his base better than non-existant centre-right opposition party with strong leader . 
  harsh truth is still the truth . 
  now let 's the reality , majority of headscarved women ( by majority i mean more than 90 % ) wear it because of either family or husband or neighbourhood pressure . 
  of course there are also women who wear veil by their will i know but however they are minority . 
  you just can not say `` freedom to wear whatever she ** wants ** '' or blame those who are opposed to that as `` islamophobic '' when they are being dictated to wear it by their environment . 
  oh , do you think women in conservative muslim communities have right to do whatever she wants ? 
  the women in those communities are firstly seen as property of family , then property of husband . 
  they do whatever their family ( then husband ) dictates to do and wearing headscarve is the most important part of it . 
  sorry if my comment sounds so `` islamophobic '' or any buzzword lefties love to use . 
  you need the clear out molenbeek if you want to get rid of islamic terrorism in europe . 
  this place is like raqqa in europe , all kind of terrorist organisation members ( from isis to al-nusra , hizb-ut tahrir etc. ), 
  harbor there . 
  belgian government or whatever controls the city must be harsher and implement `` better safe than sorry '' policy . 
  you can not normalise islamic terrorists by tolerance , european governments should know it . 
  secondly , every saudi-funded mosque should be closed . 
  those mosques are nothing but isis/al-nusra whatever recruitment centre . 
  those `` mosques '' turn normal muslims into `` brave mujahideen in the middle of infidel continent . '', 
  in my opinion , the only cure to radical islamism is stronger laicism . 
  no , they did warn their citizens about possible terror threats . 
  us warned its citizens about ankara terror attack while the govt was sleeping . 
  after the attack , many people started to take embassy warnings into account instead of govt statements . 
  us warned its citizens about anything in nevruz ( 19-20-21 of march ) , germany closed its embassy , consulate and school due to terror threat . 
  if people did n't know or care them and trusted the govt instead , i think death toll could 've been higher . 
  you wrote this as if tayyip cares about his people and not just the power . 
  the bomber could 've been found and arrested easily if s/he criticised the almighty god-emperor ( pbuh ) on social media . 
  i 'm really sorry and angry . 
  if the death toll is low , it 's because of us and german embassies . 
  they warned about possible terror attacks in following 3 days ( including today ) meanwhile government acted like nothing will happen . 
  just yesterday , istanbul governor bullshitted about closure of german embassy , consulate and school due to terror threat and implied the city is normal/safe . 
  we saw who is right . 
  do you ** really ** think akp will send them back when the war is over ( which is near to impossible ) while akp see them as millions of votes for itself ? 
  i did n't expect something reasonable from akp fucktards but this is beyond ridiculous . 
  constitutional court is neutral for now . . ca n't say the same thing about other courts . 
   so , is it safe to assume that now he 's just going full on dictator mode ? 
  what 's next ? 
  to be sultan , caliph , god-emperor , shadow of the god . 
   any party other than his is going to be labeled a terrorist group ? 
  on progress . 
  hdp signed its own death warrant by using same rhetoric with pkk , that 's what tayyip wanted . 
  now he will black propaganda the shit out of chp , main opposition party . 
  without those parties , there will be only tayyip 's party and ultra-nationalist grey wolves ' party in the parliament . 
  how loveful . 
   anybody that says something against him is arrested or fined ? 
  the biggest crime in tayyipland is `` insulting '' the great leader \u2122 so anyone who criticise the almighty god-emperor will be punished ( if not punished already ) . 
  you are wrong . 
  the point is n't a being progressive country with high human rights , world press freedom index , high hdi etc. 
  the point is to get eu membership for economic benefits and schengen visa . 
  every kind of turk , regardless of political views , know the fact that turkey will never join eu so even if there 'll be a reformist progressive government ( chp-lead probably ) , they 'll do reforms to create a progressive nation & state , not to get eu membership . 
  the problem is not our lack of progressiveness . 
  we 're too middle eastern for europeans ( and too european for middle easterners ) and people in general do n't want a country which borders to war-torn 3rd world middle eastern countries and with 80 million culturally different people to join inside . 
  also due to our population , we 'll get the most seats in eu parliament so franco-german alliance will be disrupted . 
  at this point , i do n't understand why eu keep their carrot-on-a-stick policy . 
  i do n't believe it . 
  money laundring is a very complicated job for a retard like bilal . 
  i would n't be surprised if he put all the money in laundry machine . 
  well there 's a state that get represented in un , recognised by every country on earth with 80 million population and there 's a terrorist organisation . 
  i hope you know you compare a state with a terrorist organisation . 
  oh by the way , killing executive members of terrorist organisations is one of the duties for intelligence service . 
  for instance , killing farc executives for colombia , killing al qaeda executives for usa , killing isis executives for everyone . 
  eu urged turkey to open borders to syrians , turkey already has god knows how many millions of refugees and still hundreds of thousands of them are coming . 
  eu is also planning to deport refugees to turkey . 
  eu simply say to turkey that `` we 'll use you as refugee waste disposal and use `` eu membership '' bullshit ( as if both parties do n't know that turkey will never ever be member of eu . ), 
  to silence you . '', 
  yes , killing executive members of a terrorist organisation is wrong just because muh women rights . 
  democratic feminist pro-lgbt kurdish freedom fighters which westerners tell us not to fight against . 
  tayyip is right . 
  if eu urge turkey to open borders to syria then he 's right to * threaten * eu with the migrants . 
  we have a way much more refugees than we can handle and they 're want to migrate to eu . 
  turkish economy is shit nowadays thanks to tayyip so what do we do ? 
  i think creating eu-controlled refugee camps in turkey is the best solution for eu and turkey because both the burden on economy will somewhat become lighted and eu will keep them at bay . 
  the only wrong about tayyip-isis float is using `` kurden '' instead of `` t\u00fcrken & kurden '' . 
  do n't forget that ankara & suru\u00e7 bombing victims were mostly turkish students . 
  edit : misspelling . 
  same with tayyip . 
  nations who are mostly conservative adore charismatic leaders . 
  i wonder what counter-move to `` refugees welcome '' policy will be . 
  govt banned the broadcast so we have to watch european news channels to see what 's going on like you guys . 
  at this point our knowledge about this is equal to yours . 
  it 's not so ** misleading ** . 
  he tried to prove that presidential system can go along with unitary state by citing hitler 's germany . 
  giving nazi germany as a referance for something is evil enough . 
  you know who . 
  we celebrate new year 's eve like christmas but we do n't celebrate christmas . 
  everything christians do ( like giving present , trees etc ) in christmas also done by us for new year 's eve . 
  no , eid-al fitr & eid-al adra are ( 4 days each ) if you do n't count mid-summer . 
  christmas is n't a thing here . 
  itt : people talk about issues that irrelevant to the news . 
  informative , thanks . 
  which party ex-centre-left voters vote for now ? 
  irrelevant . 
  many eastern european countries still have old-soviet remnant ( i do n't call them left ) parties which get decent percentage of votes . 
  hell , even romania have strong leftist presence although all that violent revolution and execution of ceaucescu . 
  that 's why i asked this question . 
  what makes poland special about this issue ?
