  off-topic question : why is poland so right-wing ? 
  they do n't even have any left-wing party in the parliament . 
  hdp 's raison d'\u00eatre is kurdish interests , kurdish nationalism and anything kurdish in general . 
  those progressivism , socialism , feminism etc. 
  thingies in the second plan . 
  hardly surprising . 
  people could n't expect from the youth who are witnessing the insecurity caused by immigrants and especially islamists to vote for immigrant-friendly left or `` meh '' right . 
  fearmongering at its best . 
  it 's common in northeast only , you rarely hear it as an insult in other parts of the country . 
  fn wins lol . 
  who the fuck allowed them to establish * sharia courts * in the first place ? 
  `` pro-democracy '' my ass . 
  overthrowing democratically elected governments via * colour revolution * is n't pro democracy . 
  this guy and his * charities * is the one of biggest threads to the any sane government . 
  seriously , the only state institutions we can trust are turkish armed forces and gendarmerie in this fucked up country . 
  god bless them both . 
  elephants fight , grass gets trampled . 
  tayyip 's education reforms equal to dogshit . 
  he builds up religious schools , yes but those who already want to go there enrolled for it . 
  not like children of secular families forced to enrolled there . 
  the number of imam hatip school students have been increased because imam hatip schools were on disadvantaged position back then . 
  for example they could n't be doctor or engineer because of coefficient factor thing so even they 've chose other schools over them . 
  it 's been abandoned in 2009 . 
  the problem with tayyip is his extreme authoritarianism . 
  he uses religion for his goals . 
  he does n't want opponents , he just wants people who like him . 
  literally muslim putin with strong opposition . 
  about secularism , nobody should be worry about it . 
  there 's strong ( 70 % - 80 % ) support for secularism in turkey . 
  single rule of a party which uses religious rhetoric does n't mean secularism is in danger . 
  it 's not . 
  no matter what 's their vote percentage , they did n't , is n't and wo n't challenge secularism unless they want to see this country in ashes and dust . 
  last time he did some madness and called atat\u00fcrk and \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc `` two drunkards '' by implication in 28 may 2013 , it fueled up gezi park protests in 31 may 2013 . 
  first things first , getting rid of islamism and the danger caused by it should be priority in mena . 
  mena need leaders like nasser , atat\u00fcrk etc.

  over 90,000 turks to be sacked \\ ( 200,000-with families \\ ) ] ( https://twitter.com/yurybarmin/status/670656668527681536 ), 
  damn . 
  erdo does n't like them because they 're alcohol manifacturer , now russians do n't like them because they are turkish lol . 
  + other countries bordering to kurdistan will have issues with them . 
  also creating an independent kurdistan by separating clay from 4 different countries wo n't solve any problem in middle east . 
  you may create a safe haven in middle east with them at most . 
   do you know anything about mosques funded by qatar and kuwait ? 
  same wahhabism , different looking . 
   in my father 's village in bosnia they 're demolishing turkish mosque and building a new mosque funded by a family from kuwait . 
  this explains why people in bosnia , once the most secular muslim nation , started to join isis and [ shouting allah akbar while killing 2 soldiers . 
  ] ( https://www.rt.com/news/322640-bosnia-sarajevo-islamist-attack-soldiers/ ), 
  % 99,9999999 of saudi-funded mosques are wahhabi hotbeds which turn regular muslims into isis recruits . 
  do n't expect a source from me , just look at your nearest saudi-funded mosque . 
  while hezbollah fight against isis , israel shells and attacking them . 
  while al nusra ( al-qaeda ) fight against isis , usa shells and attacking them . 
  see ? 
  it 's not a very interesting thing , it 's `` terrorists killing terrorists '' mentality . 
   armed forces in an ethnic kurdish town in turkey 's southeast , shooting at people and shouting `` allahu akbar '' . 
  when you say armed forces , people think about the military . 
  those are ** police ** special forces aka tayyip 's army . 
  police has always acted like tayyip 's military , no surprise there . 
  if you ever said that `` how this country turned into that ? 
  it was very good back then . 
  '' , do n't worry you are not alone . 
  you have like also % 50 of turkish population with you . 
  nobody would dare to boo a minute of silence 10 ~ years ago . . 
  what is the intelligence service of france doing since charlie hebdo ? 
  terrorists still easily came to france , kill 26 people , explode * things * near the most important stadium in france while there 's an international match going on and take 80-100 hostages in concert hall !, 
  debatable . 
  if this thread was `` turkey general thread '' then you would be right but we 're talking about alcohol being not allowed in new year gift baskets . 
  so mentioning to northern cyprus or other irrelevant things are just ridiculous . 
  off-topic : will there ever be a turkish-related thread without buzzwords like `` eu , northern cyprus , 80 million people , middle east , islam . '', 
  it 's not only irrelevant for the main topic but also it 's annoying . 
  some redditors on / r/europe love to practice the buzzword circlejerk no matter if it 's related or not . 
  tech and doctrine without manpower equals to dog shit . 
  thanks for sum up everything ** we ** feel . 
  there was an islamist revolution that changed secular state into islamic republic . 
  there 's either something very rotten in this election or people just want islamist authoritarianism . 
  hmm ... islamism ? 
  check authoritarianism ? 
  check, 
  everything . 
   what are the chances of protests happening ? 
  probably wo n't . 
  people just lost their hope . 
  sad to witness that my country is turning into iran v2 .0 . 
  my flair is becoming the reality . 
  just voted for chp . 
  dude , you seem you 're confusing that `` liberalist '' and libertarian and the meaning of `` liberal '' in europe and america are different . 
  parties which are pro-business , pro-free market , anti-tax vs. being counted as liberal in europe because those are roots of liberalism . 
  social democracy , on the other hand , has socialist roots which is just the opposite of liberalism . 
  could you elaborate ? 
  i would n't pass off them as liberal while they 've strong socialist/leftist presence within . 
  you to be prime minister of turkey is more likely than that . 
   2 - they 're social democratic party so not religious at all . 
  this may cause confusion so i editted my original post . 
  nothing . 
  he argued that chp is liberal * and * less-religious so i respond them two . 
   last time there were elections i got the impression that akp was a somewhat moderate islamic and conservative party and mhp was a crazy , far right islamic party . 
  that 's just the opposite . 
  mhp ** was ** islamic but not islamic at all now . 
  akp , however , is typical islamist party in middle east . 
   and chp was somewhat liberal and less religious/in favour of secular government . 
  socially , yes but chp is n't liberal .
