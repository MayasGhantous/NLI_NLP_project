  they 're social democratic party and not religious at all . 
  known for being literally stronghold of secularism . 
   and hdp were the kurdish party which maybe has some links to the militant group of kurdish independantists who 've been known to do car bombs . 
  true . 
   enough to reject turkey 's eu membership bid . 
  thanks for posting obligated eu-related post . 
  not sure if serious ... 
  how is that even possible to found a party like that ? 
  if ** directly ** using a religion for a party is n't an attack against secularism then what the hell is ? 
  because tayyip is temporary , the republic is n't . 
  i hope so . 
   most if not all of those would probably need to be replaced as well . 
  the first thing that would need to happen post-erdogan would be a reform of the judicial system to disallow these kinds of things from ever happening again . 
  as it is , the judicial system seems way too linked to the legislative . 
  it will happen . 
  in my honest opinion , post-erdo\u011fan era will be restoration era with left-leaning governments . 
  from foreign policy to judicial system . 
  thanks for writing detailed answer , anyway . 
  at least [ majority ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/10/15/deep-divisions-in-turkey-as-election-nears/turkey-report-19/ ) dislikes him although all that propaganda through media & newspapers , oppression on opposition , convincing people via religion and polarising the nation . 
  more ancient but those laws were inactive before tayyip became president . 
  nobody arrested for insulting abdullah g\u00fcl , ahmet necdet sezer or s\u00fcleyman demirel for example . 
   what do regular turkish citizens think about all these `` insult sultan '' laws ? 
  pro-akp people support it , anti-akp people hate it . 
   is there any sentiment to abolish these laws ? 
  opposition want to abolish it , akp want to keep it . 
  it all depends on the number of opposition seats and akp seats . 
  how dare you insult the greatest leader !, 
  typical day in tayyip regime . 
  damn , anti-leftist sentiment is very strong in poland it seems . 
  low turnout is something i 'm not used to . 
  average turnout is % 80 here . 
  why so late ? 
  it 's because to attract people to vote ? 
  thanks . 
  what time is there now ? 
  why the turnout so low ? 
   konda poll holy moly . 
  what a cringeworthy guy . 
  this is what happens when you let wahhabis and other hate preachers to open mosques and brainwash the muslim minority in your country . 
  the state ** has to ** control over imams and mosques and make sure that those imams respect secularism , rule of law etc. 
  this may sound non-secular but this is the only way to make them integrate into - at least - secular society . 
  otherwise ** they ** control you . 
  the more i see things like that , the more i feel thankful to ataturk for establishing diyanet . 
  ** cyprus : ** chp say trnc is a sovereign nation with its parliament , parties , prime minister and president . 
  turkey should support them but not see them as turkey 's [ tutelage ] ( http://www.dha.com.tr/turkish-cyprus-not-under-turkeys-tutelage-chp-leader-says_920584.html ) .

  there 's a poll you [ might ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/10/15/deep-divisions-in-turkey-as-election-nears/ ) look at . 
  most people say post-erdogan era will be a restoration era with secular , liberal , more progressive government . 
  imo , political islam is so identified with akp so when akp is gone , political islam 's influence over turkish policy ( probably ) will drop to zero . 
  that would be useless & waste of time because both sides know that people of member countries do n't want tr . 
  polls showed it several times . 
  mmm . 
  you forgot that we also need to terraform mars , stop global warming , cure to aids , ebola and cancer . 
  for syrians , everything is free and provided by the government . 
  but if you 're an unemployed turkish citizen , they do n't treat you because you do n't have health insurance . 
  turkey already took 2 million people that * nowhere else to go * . 
  that 's enough , that should be enough . 
  having [ 2m refugees ] ( http://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/country.php?id=224 ) with [ shrinking economy ] ( http://www.focus-economics.com/countries/turkey ) and [ public ] ( http://www.edam.org.tr/en/file?id=1152 ) [ opposition ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/10/15/deep-divisions-in-turkey-as-election-nears/turkey-report-01-2/ ) force him to do so . 
  it 's not about tayyip ; whoever would 've ruled turkey , would did the same . 
  oh how things have changed . 
  `` russia is an aggressor again '' is pretty good tbh + has turkish subtitles . 
  so we will be able to travel to europe without visa ? 
  i refuse to believe it because it 's too good to be true . 
  why are racists ** always ** ignorant ? 
  those three thugs do n't even know the difference between being immigrant and exchange student and order them to go back to turkey . 
  prime ministry says it 's 95 now . . 
  enough !, 
  normally , things you said are true but while we have a government which [ planned a false flag operation in syria ] ( http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/turkey-youtube-ban-full-transcript-leaked-syria-war-conversation-between-erdogan-officials-1442161 ) and still ** ca n't ** find the responsible of [ diyarbak\u0131r ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_diyarbak\u0131r_rally_bombings ) and [ suru\u00e7 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_suru\u00e7_bombing ) bombings , people accuse the government first . 
  before 7th june elections , tayyip said give me 400 deputies and we 'll transform turkey [ * peacefully * ] ( http://politics.bgnnews.com/give-me-400-deputies-and-well-transform-peacefully-says-erdogan-haberi/4092 ) . 
  after the elections , tayyip 's chief advisor tweeted that `` elections are held , people chose . 
  i said either chaos or stability , people chose chaos .

  turkey pm declares 3-day national mourning over #ankara attacks . 
  says strong evidence 2 suicide bombers [ carried out attack at peace rally ] ( https://twitter.com/cbcalerts/status/652858934961811456 ) . 
  yes but secret agencies do collect intelligence and warn authorities before shit hit the fan . 
  want it or not , it 's police 's duty to provide security , not fire tear gasses to wounded people . 
  that makes them part of the plan . 
  ankara public prosecutor [ says 47 killed ] ( https://twitter.com/bbcturkce/status/652814777924878336 ) ... 
  a blast occured in the ** capital ** city of turkey , there 's 3 km distance between the rally area and m\u0130t so it 's either our secret agency is so utter shitty that ca n't even prevent a suicide attack in a place that very close to them or m\u0130t is a part of this . 
  turks in usa are mainly middle-class/upper-class people who moved to usa for educational & scientific matters . 
  those are mainly engineers , doctors etc. 
  turks in germany are uneducated people from rural anatolia who have taken by germany for cheap workforce . 
  so usa have founder of atlantic records ( ahmet erteg\u00fcn ) , ceo of comodo group ( melih abd\u00fclhayo\u011flu ) , ceo of coca-cola ( muhtar kent ) , mehmet \u00d6z among 500k people while germany have [ those guys ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3zfxbp05h8 ) among 3.5 m + people . 
  chp and mhp are n't compatible with each other as well . 
  in rural areas mhp have no difference than akp , i do n't even talk about 70 's . 
  wish those who came here were secular . 
  they do n't live like ours , even their kids cover their head . 
  i think she see less hijabs there than turkey because of population of non-muslims . 
   do n't the syrians concentrate in the east of turkey , which i was under the impression was vastly different culturally from the west , in terms of being much more like the mid-east , islamic , religious , traditional etc. 
  nope . 
  they 're spread out within turkey . 
  they mostly live in big cities . 
  if they were concentrate in eastern turkey , i do n't think people would 've disliked them that much . 
   and many syrians on the other hand were quite educated and secular before the war . 
  do n't know about them but those in turkey are n't secular at all . 
  even kids cover their heads which is bizarre for average turk . 
   so would there really be such a cultural clash in the most religious , rural part of turkey ?
