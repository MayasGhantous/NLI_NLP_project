  actually it 's just the opposite . 
  that religious part is responsible for taking everyone who hop the border in the name of `` muslim brotherhood . '', 
   war does not seem to be ending in 5-10 years at least , which means a generation at least . 
  point still stands . 
  most of actors ( i mean countries , not proxies in syria ) in this war want to end it asap to prevent more refugee influx . 
   this does not matters on the personal level . 
  this does matter , that 's why there 's difference between a refugee and immigrant . 
  one is `` came '' here , other is `` fled '' . 
   why not ? 
  what you think new generation raised in turkey or ones that settled in turkey would want ? 
  the point is sending them back before * generations * . 
  otherwise it will be too late . 
   even the turks in cyprus do n't want to leave even they 're not wealthy . 
  because they 're voluntarily have been sent there to ** turkify ** , they did n't escape from some violence in turkey . 
   and still , turkey is a better choice than syria . 
  it is . 
  but nobody can live in a place where people oppose him . 
   well , not actually ; it 's going to be the same with the turkish guest workers in germany with or without the akp . 
  they 're a large minority even know and it 's going to be impossible to deport them after 5-6 years against their wills . 
  what you 're going to do if 3-4 million people who settled down for more than 5 or maybe 8-10 years do n't want to leave ? 
  or their hundreds of thousand children who will born and/or raised in turkey ? 
  turkish guest workers wanted to stay in germany and resisted for it . 
  syrian refugees do n't want to stay in turkey . 
  turks do n't want them eather . 
  many of syrians want to go to europe and some of them want to go back to their country . 
  you 're comparing apples and grapes . 
  things you are saying that mainly based on ruling party . 
  if you think that akp will stay forever , your statements are true . 
  but they wo n't . 
  no , it 's impossible to keep them here when war is over . 
  especially when you consider the public opposition . 
  except we have a chance to send them back when war is over , european countries do n't have . 
  getting visa is cancerous , that 's why . 
  why did you write exactly what i wrote ? 
  poll : http://www.edam.org.tr/en/file?id=1152 people in general do n't like them and want to send them back to their countries . 
  most of them live on streets , try to make money via begging . 
  they do n't want to stay in refugee camps and even if they want , there 's no capacity for all of them . 
  the second reason is they work illegally and decrease the wage so employers are in favour of syrian workers instead of turkish . 
  why would someone wants turkish workers who will get min 1000tl while syrian workers who work for ** any ** cost ? 
  third reason is culture . 
  the westerners love to think that if you border some country and share the same religion , you 're automatically share the same culture . 
  it 's wrong as hell . 
  this is middle east where you can find lots of opposite cultures within a country . 
  firstly the perception of islam is very different in countries . 
  you ca n't compare turkish , azeri etc. 
  islam to syrian one . 
  regardless who they are , poor or wealthy , they seem backwards in many turks point of view . 
   visa relaxation for turks that would be enough for me and many turks . 
  pre-info : our old apartment was build 35 years ago and not seem resistant to possible big earthquake . 
  it was one of reasons why we moved to a new flat . 
  our new appartment built in mid-2014 , has lots of columns and ( according to district municipality ) its location is safe . 
   are there education and preparation programmes in place to keep the damage small ? 
  there is n't . 
  people just aware of the risk but they do n't know what they should do during earthquake and where they should go after it . 
  i think most of people unconsciously go to coastal areas of the city to feel safe as they did in 1999 . 
  addition : i forgot that there 's a gentrification programme going on . 
  they simply evacuate a neighbourhood , demolish all that buildings in it and build new ones . 
  what residents get depends on how valuable their old flats are . 
  for example if you have 4 +1 200m2 flat , you get a flat that either has equal features or coequal features . 
  i mean they give you 2 2 +1 flats instead of 4 +1 . 
  the main point of gentrification is the resistance to possible big earthquake . 
   are you insured ? 
  yes , we are . 
  earthquake insurance is compulsory in turkey and you have to renew it every year . 
  i 'm afraid of earthquakes and seems like it 's the biggest taboo among istanbulites . 
  nobody dare to talk about possible big earthquake ( 7.0 + richter ) which predicted to happen in 30 years . 
  people even ca n't dare to talk about 1999 earthquake because of all that tragedy . 
  r/turkey have lots of , tons of , shittons of nationalists . 
  you can easily be accused of being pkk supporter or something and that accusation get lots of upvotes . 
   i 'm guessing most of these are named after either the 2nd prez of turkey ( 1st after ataturk ) or the battles . 
  actually both . 
  actually i do n't know and never thought why we give mainly flower names to our streets . 
  considering the only flower that islam cares/mentions about is rose , it 's most likely a cultural thing . 
  i think flower names are the easiest to give . 
  there wo n't be any controversy about them and hell , how can someone dislike flowers ? 
  so what if i do n't want people who beg in the streets , disturb and rob locals , commit crime ? 
  what if i just want to learn how many of these `` refugees '' are really refugees ?

  sorry but nothing can be peaceful in middle east . 
  turkey 's government does n't play a two-faced role because there 's no such thing as turkish government since june 7th . 
  because following turkish politics in its language is entertaining . 
  hillary is pro war and actually wants to boots on ground to overthrow assad government . 
  basically she wants to add iraq war 2.0 on whole that mess in syria that 's called civil war . 
  not to mention all things she has done during arab spring . 
  that does n't mean trump is angel , i just do n't want hillary . 
  i hope hillary wo n't be elected . 
  the middle east does n't need another bush . 
  majority of the nation from every political views have some disgust towards western countries . 
  especially towards britain because of historical reasons , current middle east problems and generally we like to live in past . 
  erdo knows it , use it as a political tool when religion card is not that effective . 
  not saying this is good or bad , i just said what it is . 
  erdo would 've declared sharia which he would be supreme leader if 75 % backed him . 
  so pkk and isis claimed responsibility of the same bombing , wow . 
  a journey from illiberal democracy to tyranny of the majority i 'd say . 
  turkey has always been a regional power . 
  the question is how this power going to be used . 
  he wo n't attack chp before he makes mhp voterbase split up ( hence they are below the threshold ) and hdp got closed . 
  eliminating small threats first and the big one later basically . 
  but i agree that attacking chp means automatically civil war . 
  the founding party of the republic which is secular stronghold and got 1/4 of votes we 're talking about here .
