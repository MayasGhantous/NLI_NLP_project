  actually i detest both equally . 
  getting kind of boring now . 
  i expect this is going to happen a fair amount now . 
  i really would not be surprised if the often touted ` passporting ' is negated somehow too , and they how set up tax breaks to offset any losses . 
  the uk is also likely going to be more agile going forward in working quickly to make deals , then the eu needing 27 countries to agree on the topic before they even begin discussing it . 
  i know , right . 
  not much , although it does illustrate how the uk can be much more agile at forming trade agreements , then the eu that needs huge consensus across countries , districts and people speaking different dialects . 
  is he going to ` white up ' for the part ? 
  it would help if it was truth in the first place . 
  compare the article headline  us banks planning exodus from brexit britain , says french minister with the first paragraph :  finance minister michel sapin says banks had confirmed to him they would move ** some activities ** to the continent when the uk leaves the eu we all knew that months ago . 
  its sensationalism and i would call it out from both sides of the debate . 
  the guardian and the daily mail are both as bad as each other . 
  i do n't want to change the result . 
  yes , i forgot to mention the sudden unset of homophobia too . 
  very much . 
  i used to be a quiet fellow , into computer programming , playing video games and watching netflix . 
  then june 23 , 2016 came to pass and i found myself just wanting to go out and beat up polish people . 
  i kept muttering ` muh sovereignty ' , ` take back control ' over and over . 
  i have since been put on a high dose of pharmaceutical grade olive oil and listening to swedish pop music . 
  feeling better again now . 
  i upvoted you back again , as having < - that flair means i am used to downvotes round here . 
  i can see what tusk is doing here , and ca n't blame him . 
  on one hand he talks tough on brexit saying he see 's no option for soft brexit , and it has to be a hard brexit and then he extends the olive branch to allow the uk to back out of brexit . 
  lets be honest , as much as the uk is unpopular here right now , losing one of its biggest economies is bad news for the eu . 
  its going to be even worse if the uk manages to weather the storms and finds some success . 
  the guardian is a complete joke nowadays , they are not even trying to report in an unbiased way . 
  i am quite impartial myself on whoever it is , but on what grounds do you never see it happening ? 
  it has happened before with the last prince of wales, 
  a lot believe her majesty is holding on for a bit to allow prince william time with his kids , who will then step up and take the throne . 
  the problem with charles is that he divorced ( after it seems him and diana were never really in love ) and then married the women he had an affair with , which even though is not the mortal sin it once was , is not encouraged in the house of windsor . 
  there are also rumours ( albeit rumours ) that charles marriage is having some problems and after a life already in the media , is not really up for being king . 
  charles love life has generally been the main source of turbelance during her majesties reign over the isles . 
  prince william on the other hand , has a squeaky clean record , a model family with two kids and a wife who looks graceful while carrying out royal duties . 
  the public love him and trust him , and he really is perfect for the role of king . 
  i expect her majesty will keep going for just a few more years while until she abdicates to king william v. to everyone saying it wo n't happen , it already happened before with the last prince of wales . 
  how is the single currency working out for you guys now ? 
  let 's see high debt , low growth , youth unemployment at 38.3 % , a potential debt crisis and german finance minister wolfgang sch\u00e4uble threatening more austerity and transfer from private debt to public . 
  you guys could really do with some currency controls now , but then again germany is running a surplus , you have a deficit so that means your people will need to suffer for it by reducing the size of that state and more strict fiscal policy pushed from brussels . 
  and yet here you are hating on me . 
  amazing . 
  downvote all you want people , but a lack of answer speaks far more loudly . 
  they wo n't be able to keep the pound , so they are going to have to create a new currency ( which will be a clusterfuck ) , or in some way get the euro . 
  the eu is like a bitter ex girlfriend at the moment . 
  they are sitting on social media all day waiting for more news to come in so they can say to the ex ' i told you so , serves you right ' , you never should have left me . 
   paris , berlin or brussels . 
  no , if they go anywhere , it will be new york . 
  fuck no , its not that bad yet . 
  as long as you do n't run a deficit , and then your fucked ( just ask greece ) . 
  [ from the mouth of a scotsman ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwk0jej8wxg&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=154 ), 
  [ highly relevant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwk0jej8wxg&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=154 ), 
  `` but the eu is banking on neo-liberal policies that threaten continental social systems '' you mean austerity ( aka greece and co ) ? 
  i really dislike inline refute , but i am going to do it as you have misquoted me twice now . 
   ok we are seeing both the same wikipedia page . 
  only you did n't go further than the first paragraph , which explains it completly different and does n't state any requirements . 
  i quoted the last paragraph on the page . 
   also still , if you want to talk about definitions you should keep in mind that there can be multiple definitions about something . 
  and the eu defines single market as a market that includes freedom of movement . 
  so you can keep complaining that it 's not the `` right '' definition , but the eu is in charge about their single market and the definition of it . 
  i never complained . 
  where did i complain ? 
  i said ` as it stands the eu seeks more a unified market , then a single ' . 
  you 're welcome to disagree with that , but do n't paint it as complaining when it was standard discourse . 
  to be honest , i am done here , we are really not getting anywhere and not misreading each others communications . 
  have a nice day . 
  i did not misquote anything . 
  i included the entire paragraph : unified market [ edit ] a unified market is the economic term for a single market where goods , services , capital and people can move freely without regard to national boundaries . 
  these `` four freedoms '' are implemented by , among other things , removal of tariffs on the transfer of goods and services among the member nations , imposition of uniform product standards , revision of laws to permit `` market-wide '' financial services , and the restructuring of most government procurement practices , so as not to favour local businesses over other member states ' businesses . 
  you were looking at a different page to me ( my fault ) , so i linked to one i was looking at . 
  i am trying to work with you here buddy not win some dick waving contest . 
  interesting thailand is right hand drive ( unless you meant right , and left was a typo ) . 
  hey , i am not spoiling for a fight or trying to win anything here . 
  i was simply replying with the link i had as you asked for the direct source . 
   i like you say it 's wikipedia copypasta , but does n't include the direct source !, 
  perhaps , its a small market though . 
  shit answer , but kind of expected . 
  i guess we could always try buying an irish car . 
  i think you misread what i meant . 
  i was referring more to the russians who are known for doing lots of ` shows of strength ' . 
  i am bit lazy so copypasta from wikipedias page on single markets :  the eurasian economic union , the gulf cooperation council , caricom and the european union are current examples of single markets , although the gcc 's single market has been described as `` malfunctioning '' in 2014 . 
  [ 4 ] the european union is the only economic union whose objective is `` completing the single market . '', 
  gcc are now trying to get their shit together more and are expected to the 6th largest single market in the world . 
  as it stands the eu seeks more a unified market , then a single . 
  again wikipedia copypasta :  ** unified market **  a unified market is the economic term for a single market where goods , services , capital and people can move freely without regard to national boundaries . 
  these `` four freedoms '' are implemented by , among other things , removal of tariffs on the transfer of goods and services among the member nations , imposition of uniform product standards , revision of laws to permit `` market-wide '' financial services , and the restructuring of most government procurement practices , so as not to favour local businesses over other member states ' businesses . 
  this might finally be the incentive to start to change that . 
  sure , maybe not the most ideal way of going about it , but its likely it would never have been addressed otherwise - what with our political governance having no more foresight then the four years they expect to be elected for . 
  the problem is i have no faith in the government taking advantage of the situation . 
  very much . 
  i honestly feel the best way for the uk and france to weather the coming storms is to go all out on renewable energy , huge investment in mass sustainable farming and looking at introducing some sort of living wage . 
  if we do n't do that , we will end up with huge levels of unemployment and social unrest . 
  this to me is the real issue that governments are just not looking at . 
  that it is far to simple a generalisation and really helps no one . 
  its no different to someone coming out with the same statement about ` remainers being butt hurt they lost the vote ' or some other simpleton wide cast statement it just turns into a dick waving contest rather then an open dialog . 
  to be frank though , we need to address this balance . 
  for too long we have been far to reliant on financial services and borrowing to import . 
  i am sure it will be a tough adjustment , but its a needed one . 
  well a lot of them that need to ca n't ( greece , italy , spain etc ) . 
  single markets do exist without freedom of movement . 
  not to say it would lead to any sort of ` victory ' ( no one wins in this shit ) , but its a sure way to make german car sales in the uk plummet . 
  i also would be more concerned about the russians then us brits .
