  yeah . 
  the welsh would be called diet-english , mini-english , or english-lite . 
  haha !, 
  the two major types are red-green colourblindness , and blue-yellow colourblindness . 
  i suppose the best way to avoid problems would be to use colours that are less likely to conflict , i.e. 
  red and blue . 
  could tell it was ievan polka from the thumbnail haha . 
  it 's weird that a former colony itself went on to colonise . 
  haha , never occurred to me before . 
  green and red are n't a good mix for us colourblinds d :, 
  all the buildings are either yellow , white , or a combination of the two . 
  hoh , that 's crazy . 
  puts the amount of eggs actually consumed into perspective . 
  how many eggs are exported per month/quarter/annum roughly , if you know ? 
  ah , right . 
  is irn bru a big thing over there ? 
  ah , fair enough , i 'd bet that 's why . 
  whereabouts from the uk are you , if you do n't mind me asking ? 
  really ? 
  i would have thought it might be lucozade or vimto or something similar for the uk as a whole . 
  i guess technically , but when you think of irn bru what country do you think of ? 
  why ca n't the uk tories be like german tories . 
  ouch, 
  ivanka kind of reminds me of nicolas cage, 
  how do you feel , that right now , somewhere , somehow , a gay is having the sex ? 
  i think they meet only one of the 10s of requisites . 
  i imagine yous would have gotten an increase in scottish tourists to lisbon this year . 
  i can understand that , i 'm seeing this nhs crisis and thinking that i might 've chosen the wrong field ... 
  it seems a better situation in other countries , which i 'm guessing you could see was the same in law with the erasmus program . 
  we both might be better off in elsewhere . 
  what made you want to becom a lawyer in the first place ? 
  i get what you mean , the mainland is quite different to where we ( i 'm assuming scotland from your flair ) live , depending on the country . 
  which country was it that you saw with erasmus ? 
  brexit definitely is putting pressure on people to emigrate out of the u.k. . . 
  i would n't be surprised if the uk suffered from another brain drain because of it . 
  haha , looks like we are both going into high demand jobs , then !, 
  have you thought about what country you 'd want to emigrate to ? 
  adult nursing , which i was a wee bit surprised was in high demand . 
  what about you , mate ? 
  considering immigration after university , since my degree i 'm doing is a highly valued one . 
  we have n't had the things remain said would happen because we are still in the eu ... you realise that ? 
  when i first read that i thought ` hey , that could wor ... wait what the fuck ', 
  mines was ` fuck sake man ' and was extremely angry . 
  now i 'm just extremely angry , and terrified for the future . 
  one advantage of having a weak currency : you get to show off your new wheelbarrow if you carry cash . 
  one day . 
  dear god this government is a joke . 
  eu referendum by cameron - which had an outcome that he did n't want and * nobody * expected - and may 's call for a 2017 general election , despite not needing to have one until 2020 . 
  i 'm just curious about how you farm fur . 
  i mean , do you have to bury foxes to get fur trees to grow or something ? 
  agriculture 's beyond me . 
  i do n't get what op got , it 's more or less just `` is xxx in the eu '' or `` is xxx european '' . 
  go into incognito mode and try it again . 
  she 'll piss on the carpets of brussels if she does n't get what she wants . 
  aye , they really are . 
  seems a lot livelier in recent years than they were even a decade ago . 
  haha , appreciate it . 
  it 's hard to call how a new referendum would go - i think most likely it would result in another ` no ' vote if it were held right now , but if the tories get a majority , or a coalition , in parliament , and brexit is hard enough , then it could result in a ` yes ' . 
  either way , though , i think it would be very close . 
  yes , both . 
  may has talked numerous times about abolishing human rights acts , and it 's a very scary situation to be in . 
  the dominant scottish party , snp , have said they want to hold another referendum after the negotiations with brexit are over . 
  they were elected to the scottish parliament with that on their manifesto , giving them a mandate , and if they are elected to be the dominant party in westminster again , there 'll most likely be another referendum . 
  well , more or less in england it 's generally left-wing labour vs right-wing tories , although the green party and the lib dems sometimes pick up a few seats . 
  in wales , there 's plaid cymru who are a quite left-wing , progressive ( i believe ) party , and in northern ireland i think there are a ton of different parties that only run in northern ireland , although my knowledge of welsh and n.i. 
  political parties is very weak . 
  in scotland , it 's more or less left-wing snp vs right-wing tories , with the green party getting a few seats ( although , they 'll most likely not get very many this election , since they 're running much fewer candidates than previous years ) , and the lib dems who also may get a seat or two . 
  left-wing labour used to be the dominant scottish party , but after blair they were more or less ousted from that role by the snp . 
  labour will probably get a good number of seats , and most likely so will the tories . 
  the snp will most likely get more than 40/59 scottish seats , with tories second , labour third and lib dems or greens fourth or fifth . 
  haha , i 've never missed an election and i wo n't start now !, 
  you 're welcome , have a nice day . 
  essentially , each country within the uk has certain powers that affect their own country . 
  for the most part , the u.k. parliament passes laws for england and wales , the scottish parliament for scotland , and the northern irish assembly for northern ireland . 
  however , the u.k. can pass laws affecting all of the countries . 
  [ ** here ** ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/first_time_voter/8589835.stm ) is a bbc page explaining devolution ( meaning decentralisation of power to scottish parliament and ni 's assembly ) better than my currently sleep-deprived mind could right now . 
  e : [ ** this ** ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35559447 ) one goes into more detail . 
  fair enough , bnp are more right wing , as one example . 
  scotland has no tuition fees , they were eliminated by the snp . 
  under cameron 's leadership , however . 
  under may 's they 're significantly more right wing . 
  if you can imprison people and put them on trial without sufficient evidence , then you can accuse anyone of being a terrorist , such as your political opponents , and imprison them that way . 
  not to mention that it 's a massive affront to human rights and civil liberties . 
  also , it implies that the government knows best and the government is always right , always , regardless of whether or no they have evidence to support their accusations , which is far , far , far from true . 
  ah , aye absolutely . 
  i think he actually said he 'd not use nuclear weapons , which is a stupid thing to say . 
  he should have kept his feelings a secret , or else what 's the point of a deterrent . 
  something for us to be proud of . 
  u.k. should change to ams , or maybe stv . 
  some of ours are . 
  for example , teresa may is reminiscent of emperor palpatine . 
  they both want unlimited power . 
  not democracy , * yet * . 
  civil rights , absolutely . 
  it 's fucking disgusting . 
  ` proper ' is subjective . 
  also labour are in favour of eliminating english and welsh tuition fees , iirc . 
  labour is n't against trident .
