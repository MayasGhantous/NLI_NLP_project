  so more or less a population density map . 
  fine - so send the people who want to fight . 
  sending people who do n't want to fight will just result in those people being killed . 
  i see loads of people jogging and running in leeds . 
  sweet russian tears . 
  the french are very thin compared to americans or brits though . 
  the difference is very noticeable . 
  we do more exercise than most european countries but we are also fatter than most . 
   other ** eastern european countries like ** ukraine or ** poland ** wash your mouth out with soap !, 
  i think i 'll sleep tonight , but thank you . 
  does n't fucking matter . 
  if people do n't want to fight in a war zone , they should n't have to . 
  i would certainly rather go to prison than be forced to do that . 
  the same people who think conscription is a good thing should be the first ones to volunteer for the front line - see how much they like it when people are being shot and blown up every day all around them . 
  cunts . 
  and czech republic is off the charts , lol . 
  it is . . in the alternate world created by the far-right . 
  god damn nordics making everyone else look bad again . 
  in denmark ? 
  unlikely . 
  they 've taken a much more hard-line stance against immigration in recent years . 
  denmark 's blasphemy law is hundreds of years old so i somehow doubt it . 
  and a lot of men are physically weak and not fit for military service . 
  no need for conscription when most reservists are probably crap and would completely inept in a war zone . 
  i am so sick of this idea that men are just disposable - send them off to fight wars and get slaughtered . 
  it 's bullshit . 
  if men want to serve in the military then fine , but nobody should be forced to . 
  fuck that . 
  they should let in some refugees - seems like they have more in common with islam than they 'd care to admit . 
  when catalonia is admitted to the united nations , i will take notice - but that is never going to happen , as catalonia will always be a province of spain . 
  enough of your endless whinging . 
   looool . 
  so nations only get the right to self-determination if you consider the state controlling them to be `` bad '' . 
  yes . 
  spain is a wonderful country . 
  you appear like whinging babies . 
  do n't curr . 
   i would love to see you say that as a kosovar , as a east timorese before 2002 , as a former soviet union citizen or any other . 
  i support the estonian , latvian and lithuanian states - russia is a vile country , and russians themselves are quite horrible . 
  estonians , latvians and lithuanians are well within their right to want nothing to do with such a cesspit of human villainy . 
  spain is a great country , so catalans have no reason to seek independence . 
  they need to accept their position as a prosperous spanish province . 
  it is petulant and childish to constantly seek out something that is not only unattainable but also undesirable . 
  learn from scotland 's neverendum - it is harmful to their economy . 
  it was harmful to quebec 's economy . 
  me too . 
  leaving the european union is a terrible idea and it reflects poorly on our country . 
  the general public are not sensible or mature enough to handle a referendum on such an important subject , so need to be told what is good for them . 
  we are so child-like , and need protecting . 
   do you think the world will always be like it is right now , in march 2017 ? 
  no , i do n't - but catalonia will always be a province of spain , and scotland will always be part of the united kingdom . 
  it 's fine to dream - we all have dreams - but you need to realise that a lot of dreams will simply never become reality . 
  now please , end this nonsense . 
  scotland and england are separate entities , within the same country . 
  catalonia and spain are not separate entities . 
  catalonia is a part of spain . 
  do you understand ? 
  i am a troll for stating a fact . 
  catalonia is a province of spain . 
  it is not a nation . 
  end this nonsense now . 
  no more divisive nonsense . 
  we must come together , not drift apart . 
  catalonia is part of spain , and it always will be . 
  please , catalans , accept this and move on . 
  we need to put an end to these ridiculous secessionist movements . 
  stamp it out . 
  that place in holland ? 
  it 's okay i guess . 
  oh , i would n't bother . 
  go somewhere better . 
  but was a great public speaker and at least looked pretty normal . 
  even now he makes great public speeches , even though he 's a cunt . 
  america is beamed onto our tv every day . 
  there 's no escaping it . 
  it 's the consequence of being the world 's sole superpower - and the consequence of a country that exerts significant influence far beyond its own borders , often to its own benefit . 
  just the way the cookie crumbles . 
  if americans do n't like the rest of the ( western ) world being obsessed with them , they should hope their country becomes politically , economically and militarily insignificant . 
  people wo n't take notice of it then . 
  you have something firmly placed up your arse as well - a pine cone , perhaps . 
  lighten up . 
  these people think merkel is a leftist , so yeah . 
  i said it made a difference , not that it was the be all and end all . 
  farage and johnson have other factors working in their favour . 
  see , i do n't necessarily disagree with what you 're saying but you 're deluding yourself if think his awkward and geeky demeanor were n't detrimental to his chances of being elected . 
  this could have contributed to him being perceived as weak as much as anything else . 
  these things definitely * do * have an impact . 
  it would be better if they did n't , but of course they do - it 's human nature . 
  if hamon went all-out against immigration there 'd be no reason to vote for le pen . 
  nah , his appearance and demeanor were significantly more important than anything else . 
  i 'd say 90 % of the electorate are totally unaware of any party 's policies . 
  what they say , or how they say it , is what counts . 
  charisma makes or breaks a candidate - and unfortunately ed milliband did n't have it . 
  otherwise , i 'm not really sure how he was a shit candidate unless you just disagreed with his policies in general ( and if you 're a tory , that stands to reason ) . 
  that 's how people vote in the uk . 
  look at how ed milliband 's appearance was berated by certain media outlets . 
  it definitely made a difference to his chances . 
  can we have one day without some bullshit on sweden ffs . 
  there are two kinds of people here : those who find this funny , and those who do n't because they 've been in that situation before . 
  people used to do this kind of thing to me in school all the time - throwing things like rubbers and bits of food at the back of my head ( and worse , but that 's neither here nor there ) .
