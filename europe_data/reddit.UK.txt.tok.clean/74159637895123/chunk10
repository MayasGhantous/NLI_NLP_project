  it 's common to see people say that the argentinian government brings up the falklands to deflect from internal problems from people who do n't seem to realise that the exact same is happening in reverse `` we showed those argies last time chortle chortle '', 
  do n't be silly , it was n't nessie . 
  we 've sent her out on sub patrol now though . 
  i always imagine that a good percentage of these great quotes with witty retorts are actually just the equivalent of thinking of a good reply two weeks later in a shower , except back then they 'd just tell people that that 's what they said . 
  sounds swedish . 
   what 's for you will not go past you . 
  basically que sera sera . 
   away and boil your head a non-sweary way of telling someone to fuck off , especially if they 're wasting your time  many a mickle macks a muckle save small amounts and you 'll soon have large amounts ( money ) more commonly used in english version would be look after the pennies and the pounds will look after themselves . 
   we 're all jock tamsons bairns we 're all god 's children / equal just a few off the top of my head , all sound better actually hearing them . 
  lol , jk , the north atlantic is filled with secret lairs just like this . 
  reorientating the iceberg in the process ?

  you can put it off as long as you want though , just keep failing to meet the criteria for joining . 
   [ there is no available explanation for the allocation of road numbers in northern ireland ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roads_in_ireland#roads_in_northern_ireland ), 
  actually it 's a reflection of the reporting . 
  in the uk & ireland when people say gypsy / gypsies they 're * usually * referring to irish travellers , not roma . 
  same rules / stereotypes apply to irish travellers as roma . 
  i do n't think so ,, 
   mostly you 'd have to find some sort of an excuse . 
  a : want to go to the cinema b : nah , ca n't be arsed a : come on !, 
  b : i said no . 
  pretty much how it goes tbh . 
  ( with people you know , with strangers you are kind of expected to be polite ), 
  that has been an artificial construction , like that map shows , it 'd possible for countries to have a broad economy rather than have it near totally reliant on a single region . 
  you 're looking at the current situation as though it 's a force of nature that has made london vastly successful and the rest the opposite when it 's a situation that has been engineered for a very very long time . 
  even those are the result of pure geographical luck ( aberdeen ) and a holdover/legacy from pre-union and immediately post-union days ( edinburgh ), 
  the uk economy is basically run off keeping london going , the economy has been long term balanced in favour of the london economy at the expense of all others . 
  so while the uk performs well as an overall picture , when you look at the detail it 's a case of it working very poorly for most of the place and very well for a small part unlike for example france which while having a more prosperous capital has n't sacrificed every other part of the country to achieve that . 
  it 's far cheaper for said country to just stop all attempts to keep people from leaving their country then . 
  seriously if that 's your idea of playing hardball , what happens when that country just full stop quits trying to control the situation ? 
  keep paying for the same people to get flown back only so they can try their luck again ? 
  eh , the word nationalism is mostly used in the uk in reference to the snp and welsh nationalists and that definition clearly does n't fit there either so that 's not the way it 's usually used in the uk . 
  it would have worked far better if the first half was what has the * eu * ever done for us then when the whole `` apart from x , y & z '' bit is done him saying well what about the echr and doing his `` we wo n't be dictated to thing '' and going from that bit . 
  i know it 's playing on life of brian but the strongest part of the sketch is the second half , i really think a lot of people would be swayed by knowing the part the uk played in formulating it . 
  switzerland - watches . 
  a surprisingly apt consideration of their neutrality stance . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ yes ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ know ^ ^ ^ ^ what ^ ^ ^ ^ it ^ ^ ^ ^ means . 
  yeah , this is shockingly very close to the truth , a lot of british people living in spain do n't * really * think of themselves as living in another country . 
  swap wales & ni , it 's closer to what polls are suggesting and would be far more dramatic since wales is n't going to kick up a fuss either way but ni has a lot riding on being in the eu . 
  it probably is just the translation but the word exploiting is n't always negative , it can just as easily be used to mean making use of without nefarious undertones and in that sentence it works fine . 
  it was sold that way by uk politicians , there was no great deception on the eu end of it . 
  far more accurate though , yours makes it sound as though the eu suddenly changed tack when the uk got on board when of course it 's the uk that got on board then demanded a change in direction . 
  what about : you join a football club , everyone at it is fully aware it 's a football club but you misread the pamphlet and thought it was a cricket club , rather than own up to the mistake and leave or stay on and see if you can play football you demand that everyone else must abandon football and play cricket or at the least pretend it 's a joint cricket/football club . 
  isis have uniforms ? 
  i 'd say send them over , makes it much clearer who the enemy is . 
  it 's also a terrible photo compared to the rest . 
  which is why i said `` get in on the ground floor '' there 's nobody up top if you 're there at the very beginning or close enough to get to know those who are . 
  you do n't appear to have read what i 'm saying or rather have read what you wanted to . 
  first , we 're talking 10 years from now , not today , just like the average wage in hungary and eastern europe in general has increased massively over the last 10 years i 'm saying it 'll do so over the next 10 . 
  second , with a more prosperous country come better funded and better quality services , again , i 'm talking 10 years from now as per the question , not tomorrow . 
   technicians can become euro millionaires solely through the merit of being the personal friend to the prime minister because they hail from the same village , but teachers and nurses have to arrange grassroot protests because their salaries are so miserable and they are so overworked - only to have their movement ridiculed and crushed from up top . 
  yes , that happens here too . 
   if you think these has less of a defining effect on how much you can enjoy your life compared to the lack of the scary mudslimes , well ... you disgusting little xenophobe , like i said , as the economies of eastern europe grow they 'll start to attract more people who 'd rather start at the bottom then build their way up rather than languish in minimum wage jobs in the west their whole lives . 
  but obviously for you it 's all about the `` mudslimes '', 
  yes and i 'd bet there 's a lot more hungarians and bulgarians living in germany etc. 
  the point is that net migration would shift from being to the west to the east . 
  what have i said wrong ? 
  i think we 'll be seeing the beginnings of intra-eu migration in the opposite directions , eastern europe will start to be seen as very up and coming , lots of positions available for those who want to get in on the ground floor and find themselves at the top in 30 years . 
  countries like romania and estonia with low populations compared to their size will have new cities being built to accommodate population growth that the existing infrastructure simply ca n't provide for . 
  i expect a strengthening of ties with china/india as their economies continue to grow and we 'll be seeing the * beginnings * of trans-eurasian trade & politics replacing trans-atlantic as the dominant one . 
  i think by 2026 the refugee crisis will be over , we 're just entering our second year of it now and public opinion on it everywhere is beginning to snap , in the coming years efforts to fix the root cause will become unavoidable , there 'll be western intervention in north africa/middle east to try and stabilise things and it 'll be with eu wide backing , many of the refugees just arriving now will have established themselves with regular incomes , while many will return , many will also stay in europe and send money back home , this will spur economic development ( similar to what happened with eastern europe over the last 10 years ) it 'll be a different world , but it 'll look pretty familiar . 
  i still do n't necessarily see what 's wrong with that though ? 
  in the uk you do n't even need a parents permission below 16 , you just need 2 doctors to agree it 's the right thing to do . 
  what 's wrong with that ? 
  yeah but they bury their treasure * at * the shore . 
  [ it would be funny if it did n't actually happen ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-32696505 ), 
  which is probably one reason why what he said is true . 
  one day an archaeologist is going to unearth the remains of one of these and conclude it was the site of a pagan ritual . 
  he said that scotland has a better relationship with it 's immigrant communities than london like london has a better relationship with it 's immigrant communities than belgium ( paraphrasing ) no mention of no religious extremism for one thing because we 've had sectarianism for a long time . 
  so to answer your question , no , he did n't say that . 
  so that when they stop you have your own industry that sells at a reasonable price rather than being beholden to other countries for a strategic resource . 
  or , this is a crazy idea so try to bear with me . 
  we let the belgians govern themselves and organise their society how they want without paternalistically discussing what should be done with the place as though it 's a holiday home in the need of renovation . 
  which is probably why you do n't meet many young people who are openly religious . 
  yes , saying `` may not '' is a definitive statement that it is not allowed , the `` may '' does n't make it optional . 
  you 've came to / r/europe to an article about donald trump advocating europe as a whole adopt us style gun ownership , i think it 's perfectly legitimate to talk about a us gun culture vs a european one in that context rather than listing all 50 states . 
  but since you asked , i had a quick google here 's a local comparison ** gun ownership : ** vermont - 42 % texas - 36 % new york - 18 % scotland - 1.39 % ** homicide by gun per 100,000 ** vermont - 1.1 % texas - 5 % new york - 4.4 % scotland - 0.06 %, 
  so he was arrested but not charged then ? 
  when the guy is saying that if we had more guns then these attacks would be stopped then it 's obviously a question to be asked , would the monumental rise in gun crime and mass shootings resulting from more lax legislation on gun control in europe be a price worth paying for the possibility that a few might be stopped by other people with guns ? 
  in my mind no , i 'd rather have fewer mass shootings but apparently some would prefer more frequent though . 
  that 's not what he 's saying but basically yes . 
  sure something needs to be done about the root cause but you 're in more danger of dying from crossing a road than from a terrorist attack . 
  the increased number of rampages as a result of freely available weapons outweighs any possible decrease in threat from there being people who may be able to stop a rampage with their guns . 
  i ca n't understand why anybody would want to import the american gun culture . 
  full scottish has square sausage , fruit pudding and tattie scones thrown on . 
  no , fruit pudding , it 's a thing and brilliant . 
  that looks like someone wearing a cloak with a massive tadger . 
  as someone else has pointed out , maybe you personally wished us well but there was a large contingent telling us pretty much everything you 're hearing now . 
  pretty much every other country sees the good of the eu from freedom of movement though , i actually ca n't think of any that do n't , even ireland because it broadened it 's horizons , in the uk it 's basically presented as an institution with no redeeming features and it sells because the biggest successes of the eu were never real hindrances for the uk . 
  maybe look at getting the rest of ireland before you go after other countries too . 
  meeting the eu aquis communautaire - easy , no effort required . 
  getting the agreement of all member states , - perfectly doable though some will toy around for concessions public acceptance that we do n't begin again from the thoroughly advantaged position we left from with all the opt outs and the rebate and the goodwill that does n't demand we conform - hell of a battle, 
  `` ya '' where did that come ? 
  it 's yes/aye/yeah, 
  happened all over the place , there 's a lot of whitewashing of history that goes on with lgb history , we 're talking the last 2 decades that breakneck speed progress in social acceptance in western europe has happened . 
  nato kept europe from war between the west and east , the eu has kept the peace within the west to the point that it 's so unthinkable that the idea that france or germany might want to fight one another is laughable . 
  that 's how successful its been , it 's made it seem like there was never any need for it , that of course western europe are natural allies . 
  well it is the red planet , what did you expect . 
  the one trying to show off is the one who replied with an edgy answer , reddit just so happens to be the place where it 's one that would be the top comment . 
  the meet in the middle of what to call him in english would be something like `` presiding officer '' which is what the speaker is called in the scottish parliament .
