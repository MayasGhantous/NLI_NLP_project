  the polling started out with a no vote a sure thing , whenever independence came up you 'd have swathes of comments saying that it would n't happen so there 's no need to discuss it , the polling is now exceptionally close from having been a clear and unchallengeable no vote . 
  as for devolution , westminster has pretty much shown it does n't want to go any further with it , labour who brand themselves as the party of devolution have already set out their proposals , they are a pittance compared to what their commission suggested and even at that they almost split the party in order to push it through . 
  i have no doubt that there will be `` more '' power but `` more '' is a nebulous word which could mean devo max ( not this century ) or minor powers designed to appease by giving the impression of devolution ( pretty much the definition of what 's happening ), 
  but church of england ministers * are * part of the legislative process through the house of lords so still in effect , yeah, 
  i do think so , i 'd argue we 're already at that stage for the majority , however i do think something is going to happen that 'll bring about a reformation of the systems that govern the eu . 
  this is really amazing , now i have an easy way to find which buses stop where without needing a degree in timetable reading !, 
  should be fixed now, 
  in my hometown paisley , there is a [ beautiful , abbey which dates back to the 13th century ] ( http://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/usfeatures/areas/images/renfrewshire-450.jpg ) , a while back there was a bit of a story to be told when one of the gargoyles that adorn it ( and many buildings of that age ) , turned out to be an alien from the movie [ alien ] ( http://www.vinyarb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/paisley-abbey-alien2.jpg ) ... 
  turned out that there was some restoration work a couple decades back and one of the masons had a bit of fun , just thought the story was sort of relevant , sad news when someone dies , but there 's an abbey in scotland where this guys design will probably last 100 years at least, 
  the reason opinion on what the conservative stance is divided , is because so are the conservatives , there is one wing of the party that is pro-eu but only for trade purposes and another that 's anti-eu . 
  that 's what the promised referendum is all about , trying to stop defections of conservatives to ukip from those that want out of europe , once the referendum is out of the way , if the vote was to stay in then that group can be placated, 
  in pr terms you might want to give your vote to a smaller party rather than a larger one due to the way it works , maybe green ? 
  it depends on where you are , you would have to give your vote to a party that is small but able to get just a touch more than ukip, 
   asked `` should shetland/orkney be independent countries , separate from scotland ? '', 
  only 8 % of islanders who participated in the poll said that they were in agreement that 's not to do with the referendum in september , that 's to do with tavish 's rambling, 
  got a source on the shetlands being anti-indy & also something about secession of shetland that does n't revolve around tavish scott, 
  i 'm extremely pro integration but if it came to the nhs ( healthcare ) , that 's where i draw the line , no way i 'd want brussels having their hands on that . 
  it goes against subsidiarity anyway , maybe for procurement of supplies but for operation no way . 
  if you were watching question time last night you 'll have noticed the importance of having it as a manifesto pledge because someone brought up that david cameron had made a `` cast iron '' promise to hold a referendum in 2009 and the guy on the panel basically just said `` it was n't in the manifesto '' that was a big thing back then too , not as big as now admittedly but it 's a promise that was reneged on despite being made often . 
  they send them out in case you move house or something , once you 're signed up you 're fine until something changes, 
  i read somewhere that the return each year norway gets from the oil fund is actually more than it gets from oil production, 
  yeah i know , but that 's the point , catalonias in a position where it ca n't win , i 'm just not seeing where they think the eu will be able to help them . 
  it 's the whole article 48 vs article 49 debate , i 'm well aware of it but ultimately if catalonia declares itself independent * without * the consent of spain then there is no way for catalonia to be accepted into the eu , spain would simply veto any application in whatever form it took, 
  not really , the eu recognises member states only , catalonia like scotland is a part of the eu , but we are parts of the eu because we are parts of a member state , it 's why despite repeated scottish government requests of the uk government there is still no legal position of the eu being delivered because the european union will * only * recognise the government of the member state . 
  well i ca n't speak to the catalan referendum but i can to the scottish one , if we vote yes in september then that is not the point of independence , independence comes when the negotiations on seceding from the uk are complete and the uk government signs off on it , that 's expected to be around march 2016 , though the date is n't set in stone , in this time eu membership and conditions one way or the other will be decided . 
  for catalonia , no such recognition will be given by the parent state , if catalonia declares independence unilaterally then it will not be legally recognised as independent and will therefore still operate ( or rather be viewed as operating ) as a part of spain and thus a part of the member of the eu that spain constitutes , i 'm not saying it wont cause problems but the eu could n't do anything but continue to treat catalonia as a region of a member state for fear of giving legitimacy to the claim to independence . 
  i 'm not getting what the eu has to do with this , can someone explain ? 
  i read the article but as the article says , unanimity between member states of the eu is required in admitting a new state , how are the eu representatives planning on getting around that key part of the function of the eu ? 
  that 's what it is , i 've only ever seen them , whenever i 've done it it was just with a stick or whatever done the job , the amount of dust that comes out is disgusting when you realise your carpet is likely 10x worse and there 's no way to fix it : l, 
  i recognise the carpet beater linked aboves shape , but the ones i 've seen are solid hardwood and very ornate , i 've never actually heard of any thing specifically for hanging a rug up to beat it , whenever i 've seen it done/done it , you just find something that 'll do the job , balconies , hand rails , whirligigs ( without the lines ) , fences . 
  it 's oddly satisfying to see all the dust and dirt come out of it though you 'll never look at what you think of as clean carpets the same way again . 
  if you have a rug it 's best to do that every now and again , hoover or not , if you beat a rug it does n't matter how much you hoover it , it 'll be filled with dust, 
  czech republic !, 
  sounds good, 
  yes , and there 's months to go , the polls are shortening and so are the betting odds ... for the first time , it 's not just a nice idea , it could actually happen . 
  it 's being discussed but really the focus of everything political is on the upcoming referendum , in that light the european elections are being looked at in that regard as the last actual electoral measure before the referendum . 
  i hope one day i 'll see myself as being european , for the moment i do n't, 
  you said it right there in your comment though , it 's the accretion disk that 's bright , the black hole itself * is * black , pitch black so the name is perfect for it . 
  hot shit is bad shit hot is good, 
  hmm cool , i 'll probably be back once the whole independence refrendums done with , that pretty much takes up my free time online atm . 
  been ages since i was on polandball , how is it these days ? 
  lots of people like me only check individual subs and will miss 99.9999 % of the things that get posted to subs they 're subscribed to , generally if i see nothing interesting on the front page when i first login then i wo n't be looking at the front page until the next day , the general rule is that karma whoring is when people post the same topic in the same sub , different subs is fine ( and encouraged ), 
  if we get a yes vote in september then between now and 2016 a new accession protocol will emerge for members coming out of existing members , however this is likely to not be of much use to catalonia or any other regions looking to declare independence unilaterally , the process will be set in regards to a country that achieves independence with the agreement of its member state , that is unlikely to be the case any time soon with catalonia, 
  i think it 's the same in most places with a welfare system , here they 're called the working poor . 
  both the usa & russia have about 8000 left each , and are ( by 2020 ) projected to have about 3500 each , 1800 are how many are operational but that number can be relatively quickly bumped up by bringing the others back online , so it 's kinda worse than you think , also the weapons have a variety of different yields but they have the capability to hit any point on the earth with a range of icbm 's and sea based weapons . 
  however the russians will only ever use their nukes if someone else does * or * it looks like they 're going to lose russia itself , so the trick is to never overwhelm them , just push them back and hold your line and they wont use nukes . 
  ( same applies to usa funny enough ), 
  i never found tbbt funny anyway but i take the point, 
  it can be annoying but if you tune it out you get to watch quality shows that you 'd otherwise be unable to, 
  do n't worry , if salami tactics are anything to go by you 'll have plenty more opportunities to post it . 
  yes prime minister , it 's a follow on from yes minister , i 'd like to share another of my favourite clips [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmovewtdycs ), 
  [ old but good , and still very relevant ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ix_d_vmkswe ), 
  also 10 % of the eu 's wave potential and pentland firth alone is a major future source of power from tidal , we are in one hell of a good position for renewables, 
  what 's dangerous about salmond ** s ** politics in your view ? 
  the last refusal of assent ( veto ) was in 1708 , one year after the union took place , for the scottish militia bill , however that 's not the full story , there is plenty to show that the royals are pretty involved in the legislation process [ link ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jan/14/secret-papers-royals-veto-bills ) , they do n't outright refuse , they suggest that the legislation should be changed to be something that they would approve of , so it 's not an outright refusal , more a `` maybe you should change that bit there '' kind of thing . 
  they do n't * need * a bargaining chip , if they 're wanting more autonomy then i ca n't think why anyone would want to oppose that . 
  power is n't something to be hoarded . 
  and they should and probably will get that autonomy but not just shetland and orkney all the areas of scotland . 
  it 's exciting , there 's a real chance that in a few years time the country could be completely reconstituted , i do n't think anyone 's voting for edinburgh to become scotland 's version of london , devolving power out to all the regions would be just one way of stopping that happening . 
  earlier in the week the president of the parliament blocked the publication of a report concerning the situation an independent scotland would face in regards to eu membership , considering that president of the commission mr barroso has already intervened in the debate , do you think the report should be published so that an informed decision can be made ? 
  so does this mean we can all start shopping around different eu countries provider prices and get sims from whatever country is the cheapest ? 
  i also think that 's probably the sort of information that the report would contain , but even if it is n't i want to know , barroso 's comments are being reiterated constantly as being legal fact , this report would 've clarified the position and it 's infuriating that the eu as an institution is trying to obfuscate the debate and is being allowed to do so under the guise of democratic ideals, 
  i 'm pretty sure that is exactly what is happening here , with no new position coming out of the eu before september aside from if barroso or someone else wants to compare scotland to kosovo again , then we will be left in the position of having no real official eu stance , just the perception of one . 
  the president of the european commission can sit on tv and give a personal opinion on the matter , using the title of president to afford his views a great deal of credibility , then an official european body produces a considered legal opinion on the matter and publication of that information is refused because they do n't want to interfere . 
  well the interference has happened , the eu has a mess to clear up on this issue one way or the other , if they did n't want to interfere they should 've kept mr barroso on a tighter leash , they did n't and now they should either confirm or deny the personal opinions of mr barroso which are now being represented in our media as an irrefutable , official position of the european union on the matter . 
  i 'm quite amazed that some borders are clearly visible in this , people have already mentioned poland , i think italy is quite close but for me the best is scotland it 's essentially the exact border, 
  i 've no problem with the reporting of it , it 's the extent to which it 's happening , the time an resources devoted to this could 've been much better used in investigating things which will actually impact viewers , and as distant as the situation in ukraine seems , that is going to have repercussions for years to come, 
  even the beeb is doing it , it 's ridiculous, 
  hell by now the reporting of ukraine is roughly on par with the oscar pistorius case ... pretty depressing when you think about it, 
  i really doubt it , noone else is the redditor type , i 'm just thinking though , i use a vpn , it 's probably something to do with that , cheers for the info, 
  hey replying to this so i likely get an answer , when i click the link to the survey all i get is an option to create my own survey , text saying ep2014 and telling me to refer to this post i ca n't see any questions , what am i doing wrongly ? 
  surely rolling the tanks out across eastern ukrained would kinda be a bigger way of doing that ? 
  in which case they 've built an artificial , hazardous border where they never intended for one to exist , nobody 's saying that the russians could n't come through eastern ukraine , we 're saying why go to the trouble of building a border when the intention is to claim what is on the other side, 
  but what ( s ) he is saying is : why make a border if you intend to capture the land on the other side of it, 
  the argument being made by russia , if ukraine could hold fresh elections tomorrow then it would kill the russian * argument * stone dead . 
  crimea would still be occupied but then even the russians would have to acknowledge the legitimacy of the ukrainian government and its refusal to allow the * legal * secession of crimea, 
  i 'm not sure about the others but ukraines contention is that under ukranian constitution crimea * cant * seceed, 
  a few hundred years ago exactly that happened , gaelic along with other symbols of scottishness were effectively banned . 
  do n't be fooled , the scottish independence referendum has n't come from nowhere , in 1885 the scotland office was established to effectively run scotland separately as per public demand , the 1924 home rule bill , the first snp mp in 1945 , but the real snp unexpected win in 1967 , then getting 1/3 of votes in 1974 the snp managed to get a devolution referendum on the agenda taking place in 1979 , it received ( 52 % -48 % ) yes to no but failed on a technicality , then in 1997 devolution came on the cards again and passed overwhelmingly in favour in 2007 the snp formed a coalition government in the scottish parliament and in 2011 they formed a majority government , something that the parliament was designed to avoid happening . 
  even then the only reason the referendum they put forward is in any way binding is because the uk government agreed to honour it , as little as 3 years ago , this referendum would only have been advisory and would n't have needed to be acted upon . 
  i get that it must be frustrating but the scottish referendum has n't come from nowhere , when people say it 's once in a lifetime , they mean it , this has all come about from people working from within a system that is institutionally hostile to their goals just as crimeans would be , so i sympathize but i stand by working within the system . 
  no , voting/deciding to leave a union is the deliberating parties decision , if we were looking to change the conditions of the union then absolutely but for scotland to decide whether or not we should continue within the union is a decision for scotland alone, 
   but we have the right to negotiate first to lay down how a new relationship would work . 
  actually ... that 's one of the things that the uk government is categorically refusing to do , much of the what ifs of independence would be answered if we had negotiations to give a fair idea of the outcome but as it stands the majority of it is guess work, 
  brb , spreading rumours about oppressed russian minorities in estonia, 
  yeah , i would agree with the person you responded to but agree with you completely on the way its being done as being wrong , if this is a decision to be made then it is one to be thoroughly debated by the people of crimea , legally recognised by ukraine and the rest of the world . 
  a slap dash annexation under the guise of democratic ideals is a mockery of self determination, 
  ** fuck ** ... who told you ? 
  they 're building a bridge apparently ... no chance russia 's giving up crimea now, 
  honestly , i do n't find it hard to believe that many of the western journalists on rt have been fine presenting the putin view of things when it 's been of no real consequence , now it 's changed , in propping up and legitimising that message they 're playing an active ( though small ) role in going against some fundamental things they probably believe in . 
  it 's different when you 're taking the occasional snipe at the west for every and any inane reason , it 's quite another being asked to stand on stage and preach to millions that the invasion of ukraine is legitimate . 
  ( genuine question ) i 've obviously been given one side of the story here but ( very basically ) , the way i was taught it was that poland being invaded was the point at which we ( british ) declared war , it took a while to get the armed forces in a condition for a proper fight ( since we were primarily a naval power that fought on land against militaries that were n't our equals ) but the nazi 's did the same thing , leading it to be called the phoney war since neither side was really fighting , just preparing . 
  bish bash bosh it 's the end of the war and the soviet union was in control of poland and others , there was a plan to repel the soviets but we 'd likely end up winning the war by losing the country and as regrettable as that was , it was felt that we 'd done what we could with what we had . 
  question : whats the other version, 
  this is n't a backfire unless it 's been exposed ( has it been i genuinely do n't know ? ), 
  edit : and by exposed i mean to those the message is really intended for , i doubt those watching rt will be getting told this, 
  you 're probably right , i got an example of the racism ( though i 'd call it more colonial posturing than anything ) with the comment on this page about the expulsion of the `` south irish '' the potential to expel the `` scotch '' and making us leaner fitter faster etc. 
  i actually just feel sorry for these kind of people now , it must be a lonely life they live : /, 
  i get the feeling that the person you ( and i ) replied to is simply trolling , however it 's a good opportunity to dispel these myths surrounding scotland so i 'm happy to do it , i doubt s/he actually holds a genuinely colonial attitude , just a crippling desire for downvotes which equal attention . 
  so it 's just like northern ireland when northern ireland is ranked as one of the lowest performing regions ?
