  thing is if he deviated from the line stating the official eu route his statement will be manipulated to suit whatever side of the press can do it best . 
  `` i think the british people should have a referendum '' would easily lead to headlines the next day of : ** european parliament president martin schulz tells britain to commit to further integration or leave the eu ** it 's a shame but politicians * cant * just state their opinions anymore because it will be twisted and turned to fit an agenda, 
  he 's saying it because it * sounds * civilised , he knows that all the homophobes in russia will hear him say this and see this as proof that they are taking the right action , basically `` we disapprove of your lifestyle , however if you do n't trouble us you will be left in peace '' then they go back to gay bashing, 
  fair enough, 
  what i * really * like about this map is that the painter is still going on the right hand side , the picture is n't complete yet but we 're working on it . 
  probably the title confused h/im/er , this is a map of eu member states , not of europe so obviously s , w , e etc. 
  will not be included . 
  reminds me of something i saw on tv ages ago ( from memory so do n't expect perfect quotes ) billy connolly was talking about a time he brought his mother over to california , they were standing looking out over the californian hills and she tutted and said something like `` terrible '' , taken aback he looked at her and asked what ? . 
  she replied that it was such a sunny day and nobody had put any washing out to dry . 
  that 's overall woodland , * native * woodland only makes up 1 % with the other 9 % being imported species, 
   as for competing for jobs , that only happens if you are in the < 20 % job range ( based on earnings ) . 
  that 's kind of the whole point though , the people at the bottom rung of society with poor earning potential and prospects are now having to compete with people who do n't demand the same working standards and pay , in exchange for more work and after a few years of * surviving * they get to got home and * live * with the money they 've saved whilst the < 20 % are left with poorer working and pay standards . 
  lets face it , there was no way that the scottish government could have been sure this would happen , * if * they had included that as a minor or even a major part of the white paper then you 'd have the independence movement dealt a serious blow should it not have occured , all that would be needed would be a statement from the treasury a week after the release saying it would agree to no such thing and that 's the economics of it dead in the water . 
  the scottish government is already receiving a great deal of flak for proposing to do things like keep the queen as head of state ( personal feelings on that aside , it 's not like she 's a british property , she is as much the scottish monarch as the rest of the uk 's ) also you have * very heavy * criticism over even proposing that the uk might enter a `` sterling zone '' with scotland ( although , upon hearing about the proposal the governor of the boe left an invite to open talks on the matter ) . 
  so if the sco gov had even suggested this as part of the economics you 'd be left with uk ministers calling them out for expecting the uk to guarantee their debts , and the treasury which is a uk owned institution ( unlike the boe ) would simply issue a statement negating the possibility in order to cripple the economic arguments . 
  tl ; dr , if the snp * had * suggested this , it would have spelled the end of independence, 
  on the outside we would appear as a united nation however the internal borders and divisions would remain . 
  it would be like wyoming having a territorial claim right around the oil fields in texas ( which i 'm not sure even exist ) point is , one state would have a territorial claim that if it did n't exist would be a massive boon to the others economy, 
  no , the idea that x country is for the x 's and y country is for the y 's does n't rule out x supporting y in their wish to keep y for the y 's ( x & y since it can apply to any ), 
  # 5m , a reputation for unreliability and customers looking elsewhere for their fix would * not * be considered as `` shit happens '', 
  its strange to contemplate that i could be saying this * but * 111 million visits per year seems kinda low, 
  yes , just like those countries we would retain her as head of state , probably until charles became king at which point i predict a swift departure from that tradition . 
  i know , just wanted to reiterate that they are republicans for being anti-monarchy , nothing else , sometimes it 's easy to have a lapse in concentration and misinterpret things, 
  no , independence does n't really ( in my experience ) correlate with views on the monarchy there are certainly people voting for independence with the belief that it will be easier in the future to remove the monarchy though there are also those who believe keeping it is best for a sense of continuity , overall the opinion is fairly split . 
  i myself am pro independence anti monarchy but i think i should point out that the monarchy and the queen are two different things , while opinion on the monarchy is divided opinion on the queen herself is n't , most people in the uk even republicans ( in the anti monarchy sense , not us political party sense ) are fond of the queen , quite a few take the opinion that i do that she should be allowed to remain queen until she dies at which point the monarchy should be abolished . 
  whatever a persons view of the monarchy as an institution most people are very sentimental when it comes to the queen , myself included , it is no doubt difficult to understand but for many she is a reassuring figure, 
  yes i think that is wrong , even if it were his mother donating it does n't matter , they will be unaffected by the changes , they may have family connections to scotland but both have their lives firmly planted elsewhere , visiting often and having family here does n't alter that , if i were to visit family staying in my old home and redecorate it how i thought it should look i think most would agree that is wrong , that is the best analogy i can think of . 
  i think nationalism is too narrow a label , i am from a town which is from a constituency which is from a country which is from a union of countries which is also from a union of countries which is on a continent which ultimately is on earth , so long as nationalism does n't advocate that any group of people are better or more deserving than any other group ( basically civic nationalism ) then i have no problem with it . 
  not even a specific person running for office , you may know that there is currently a debate on independence happening in scotland , if a 3rd party outside of the uk were to be bankrolling either the yes or hte no campaign i 'd be furious , it is not for someone without a vested interest in proceedings to influence a decision so largely, 
   the african union , unasar , and asean all pale in comparison yes , but like i said the eu came from an organisation setup with the power to control coal and steel in 6 european countries 60ish years ago , as i said the foundations are in place , they are nowhere near as far reaching , they do pale in comparison and are arguably pathetic in their reach but then again that would all have applied to the ecsc at its formation , give it time and you may well see full on integration of these regions as we have seen in europe . 
  as for the us it was n't the same but it was similar , the us expanded from the original 13 into the 50 states we see today , the sovereignty was always there but it had to be built up over the continent much like the eu has been, 
  but the point stands , you can be as passionate about an idea as you want but if the situation has no effect on you then it is for the people whom it does have an effect on to decide , there are obvious exceptions of course , where a country exists under a dictator ( i 'm thinking north korea ) and the people really have no choice , then intervention can be neccessary . 
  glad we can agree on that then , i 've seen more than a handful support it as for your friend donating that is a rather more ambiguous topic on moral terms however , i do think that the principle should still apply , it is not for those outside of your society to dictate how it should be run , what i * do * support in this instance is non participation , i believe a few years back the british based chemical firm that manufactured the lethal injection was banned from exporting that chemical , i much prefer this approach , essentially `` we think you are wrong , we will not force you to change your system because * our * people disagree with yours however we will not help you with acts we find immoral '', 
  now wait just a minute , you were n't talking about the * idea * of a monarchy you * were * talking about donating to a organisation seeking to end the monarchy in a specific country . 
  you are fully entitled to have a view on monarchies , as does every other human being and while you may have the legal right to donate i think morally it is wrong , the decision to completely reconstitute a country should come from the people , by the people and for the people ... * of that country * i myself despise the very notion of a monarchy , i wish to see it gone from my country and would hope that others would do the same but it is not my position to decide for others how they should be governed . 
  this attitude is * comparable * to the americans who funded terrorist attacks during the troubles in northern ireland , they donated their money to a distant cause for ideological reasons with no concern of the consequences . 
  tl ; dr you have the right to a * view * and legalisticly you probably have the right to donate , but morally it is questionable, 
  already are , the us is pretty much an example in itself but to go further than that there is the much thought about [ north american union ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_american_union ) , you 've got the upcoming [ eurasian union ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eurasian_union ) , the [ union of south american countries ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/union_of_south_american_nations ) , the [ african union ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/african_union ) there are plenty of large organisations seeking to unite massive areas of the earth , none are quite as far gone as the eu especially when looking at the african union , any realistic chance of proper integration on the scale we 've seen in europe is at least a century off but the fact is the foundations are in place , these organisations may not hold much power at the moment but lets not forget that 50 years ago the ecsc consisted of a few countries and regulated only coal and steel ... now look at it, 
  irish travellers have pretty much the same stereotype attached as the roma do on the continent , i think in general if you hear someone from the uk talk of gypsies they mean irish travellers, 
  small percentages of even small countries can do a lot of damage and cause a lot of tension when they all meet up in a single location to shout at each other, 
  secular is no religious upbringing , an atheist upbringing would be actively discouraging belief in religion whereas no religious upbringing is getting to make up your own mind . 
  also , like many things like this there is a [ version ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/royal_coat_of_arms_of_the_united_kingdom_%28scotland%29.svg ) to be used in scotland which depicts the unicorn / scotland as taking prominence , using the motto of the order of the thistle `` nemo me impune lacessit '' `` no one cuts me with impunity '' . 
  also a ~ ~ minor ~ ~ major nitpick ,  the middle presents ireland , which is odd given that most of ireland has n't been part of england for around a hundred years . 
  ireland has n't been a part of * the uk * for around a hundred years, 
  well lets be serious , this economic collapse was n't the first and wont be the last , putting things like this in place gets us ready for the next one, 
  food banks are opening left right and centre but we still * need * to spend billions so we can point nukes at any point on the map . 
  that chair at the security council sure seems to be worth a hell of a lot . 
  i 'd agree with that assessment , it makes sense that they 've received evidence that shows something detrimental to the yes campaign you can work out the advice they 've received from the way ( in particular ) alex salmond and nicola sturgeon are debating the issue , they have been very vocal about free travel in the british isles remaining and also about establishing a monetary union so we can rule out the euro and schengen . 
  the cfr and rebate are up in the air but to be honest i 'm personally of the opinion that we should be looking to further integrate with the eu so , cfr i 'd be happy about losing the opt-out , the rebate is getting smaller and smaller so is becoming less and less relevant ( to scotland ) but i also think we should n't be looking to claw back every penny from the eu , it needs to prosper and it 's gon na need money to do that . 
  it makes sense in a union that some members will contribute more than others do but perhaps in this union we 'd be over-contributing without be simultaneously labelled `` subsidy junkies '', 
  * this * answer along with all the other answers are talking about a compltely different set of circumstances , because the scottish government * can not * ask for itself it can not get a proper answer , this is comparing apples to oranges , if scotland voted yes then it would not immediately be outside of the uk , there would be a grace period where negotiations would take place but scotland would * not * be outside the uk and by extension not outside the eu . 
  in the event of a `` yes '' vote the uk government will start asking the questions that really should have been asked by now ( ignoring the fact that as our representatives currently they already should have but hey ho ) and asking individual governments is meaningless when it is proposed that independence would take place around march 2016 ... by which time the most recent example of spain would have had national elections so there 'd be a different government . 
  [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/k2gggua.png ) is the difference that everyone seems to be missing when it 's quite clear and has n't been disputed . 
  no , the uk maintains its status as the uk , it 's like taking a wheel off a car , the car may not be in its complete form any more but no one is going to say that the wheel is as much a car as the rest of the car is, 
  the scottish government * can not * ask about this , the only entity that can ask about this is the uk government as the uk government represents the member state . 
  we could have had an answer to this a long time ago however ... 
  the uk government despite being asked to numerous times will not ask for clarification of what can be expected to happen saying that they will not `` pre-negotiate '' which basically means uncertainty is better than clarity, 
  sounds pretty much the same as you find in the uk with regards to scotland then, 
  the uncertainty is whether or not if scotland goes independent we will be in the eu ( only people living in scotland have a vote ) the eu one is uk wide where euroscepticism is much higher, 
  the independence referendum the eu independence referendum funnily enough one of the major points in regards to scottish independence is uncertainty over eu membership ( pretty much universally people are seeing not being in the eu post independence as a negative ), 
  tat is bric a brac so enjoy your trade in, 
   irish troubles ahh , another term from the 90 's, 
  the uk as an entity is one country made up of four constituent countries, 
  in the uk we have started having people arrested for things like twitter messages that people may find offensive , not things that incite harm just plain offensive `` i do n't like what you 've said , i 'm getting you arrested for that '' there is an increasingly authoritarian aspect of the government where what they say goes and everyone disagreeing ought to change their minds . 
  i still ca n't agree with that , the idea that because you can complain about oppression must mean you are not oppressed is nonsensical . 
  dismissing anyone complaining about increasing censorship because they are from a 1st world country is ridiculous , what should we do ? 
  hold zimbabwe as the model we should n't reach and so long as we are above that we ca n't complain ? 
  the idea that because you have n't got a gun pointed at your head means you ca n't complain is ridiculous . 
  at what point in the curtailing of rights is it ok to complain ? 
  or should people wait until they no longer live in a first world democracy before they complain about the loss of their rights ?

  9 grand a year is n't what the uni 's are paid , it 's roughly 2 grand they get from the scottish government per student with some exceptions depending on the course , the money comes from the block grant that the scottish government is allocated to fund the devolved areas of policy making , they do n't say `` we want to fund free uni so can you give us more money ? '', 
  they have to make the money they do get work , funding free uni means something else has not been funded . . 
  the theory goes like this : if you are opposed to something like torture , if you view it as a barbarity which human beings should not be subjected to then you can not in good conscience extradite a person to a place that they are likely to suffer such a thing because of their being deported there . 
  personally i think after about 0:46 it becomes far too extravagant ( not that it was n't before but it just becomes a mess after that ),

  ( just commenting on the idea that he can not clap , the whole thing is ridiculous ), 
   those new countries will need about 10-20 years to stabilize and then they could apply to join europe why would a country like scotland that is currently just as compliant as the uk in regards to european law & things like that , has a parliament in place and is relatively prosperous need such a long time to become ready to * re * - join we already have the economy/politics/society , admittedly there will be an adaptation time to the new political reality but we are talking a couple of years at the max, 
  the chart is `` per 100,000 '' a country of 100,000 people with one murder would be equal on this chart to a country of 10 million people with 100 murders, 
   there is no such thing as ` free ' legal aid . 
  the law abiding tax payers pay for it , and therefore it should not be provided without close scrutiny so perhaps some sort of `` trial '' if you will , to determine whether or not the individual is law abiding ( and therefore deserving ) or not where the individual is given the full opportunity to prove their innocence , however this can be a daunting prospect to someone with little to no experience of the legal system so perhaps we should allow and provide some sort of counsel to them to ensure they are not disadvantaged in attempting to prove their innocence because of their lack of experience or you know , just go with guilty until proven innocent as for your second point i do sympathise when you talk about  clog up the court system with repeat offences and appeals . 
  but maybe something more along the lines of paying for the help you received only if a guilty verdict is returned as even habitual criminals deserve a defence should they be wrongly accused ( you might even find that they do get wrongly a lot * because of * their record ),

  i get * why * that 's the case , you do n't want it to become a thing where pleading gay is automatic acceptance , then everyone would do it whether they are or not ... but i ca n't get over the fact that this means people seeking asylum from more than a few countries are being given a 50/50 chance between being able to live their lives or being sent back home to almost certain punishment ( from long term imprisonment to death , never-mind the social exclusion after they 've been more than likely shunned by their families after being made to come out ), 
  sorry i might be misunderstanding this , are you saying that even after they are made to come out the netherlands still might not grant asylum ?
