  [ this ] ( http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2012/03/21/an-independent-scotland-would-face-little-european-opposition-to-membership-of-the-european-union/ ) article would agree with you that spain is the most likely to have a problem but also points out how unlikely that is, 
  actually that worry was more or less quashed i believe , because scotland would be leaving through means of a legally recognised process and with negotiations etc with the uk government then it can not set a precedent for a unilateral declaration of independence from spanish or other sub-state entities without the agreement of their central authorities, 
  not `` odd '' at all , perfectly normal for scotland part of the union in 1707 was that the scottish and english legal systems would remain separate , this is one example of that difference and one that led to [ gretna green ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gretna_green ) becoming a place for english couples seeking to get married without their parents permission, 
  spells hi on a num-pad, 
  how it is perceived , i do n't speak for everyone when i say this but to take my countrys example this is how i would view the structure of power holyrood - scottish government : makes the laws affecting day to day life , debates about ( for the most part ) the most important issues for the people , seems to get the job done and representation is important westminster - british government : makes the laws affecting international day to day life ( and welfare ) , also arguably the most important considering it can send us to war etc. , can be a bit of a task to get results and representation lags a bit but overall you know where you are with it brussels , strasbourg , luxembourg - european parliament , an organisation that gets countries talking but is completely shrouded in mystery , debates everything and makes laws that are more like guidelines , representation is not an issue ( in that it doesnt appear to be important that mep 's are representative ) , the idea of cooperation on this level is nice but it is n't binding in the same way the union at westminster has been just to reiterate this would be a very short general view of the balance of power , so to sum up i think the eu needs to be relevant as it is already relevant i would rephrase that to say i believe it should be seen to be relevant, 
  afaik the eu has offered consultation on this situation but will only give it if the uk government asks for it ( as the uk is the member not scotland ) which they are not doing, 
  no problem with it , it just is n't really something sold ( heh ! ),

  and the mayan calendar was just resetting not ending , just watch , the end is once again near, 
  yeah now i 've gone looking for sources i can only find `` suggestions '' that it * might * be a possibility , i coulve swore that it was seen as a given ( not that i would be expecting the promise to be fulfilled anyway . 
  more devolution has been promised anyway in the event of a `` no '' vote, 
  dont get me wrong it 's not beautiful but once the construction work is out of the way it 'll probably ending up as a `` meh '' building rather than a `` bleh ! '',

  welsh , scottish , english and northern-irish migrating within the uk are not considered immigrants because its the same country ... 
  because to build and maintain it , it took the suppression and subjugation of the indigenous people , atrocities of all manners from slaughter to rape and everything in between and whilst there is no denying that there have been benefits there are scars left that still show today, 
  [ this , apparently ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/danish_colonial_empire ), 
  i joke along and call certain countries the colonies , joke about it being time to take back the empire , all that kind of stuff but i think like the vast majority im like you in being disgusted by its actual existence in the first place whereas many on here seem to think we 've all got a bayonet stashed away , waiting for the queen to give the order and that 's us happily back out reclaiming shit, 
  as someone else has already said , please stop bringing empire into this , it is * not * a factor , pride is but it is n't pride in the empire, 
  it might be outfunded but it is so far almost unopposed , there is no major pro eu campaign that i can think of that is making serious political and social inroads in the same way as parties like ukip , i 'd say that it 'd be quite easy to get a majority pro eu if someone would present the beneifts of it but right now you hear about the eu when things are going wrong or not at all, 
  hey , im not exactly sure of how you would do it but im sure you can change the keyboard to uk by going through control panel  languages , there 'll no doubt be a guide somehwere online, 
  no true scotsman, 
  oh yeah there are problems waiting times is definetly one of them , though if you need to be seen you will be right away , but those are problems that given the right attention can be fixed , they are not an insurmountable problem , far from it . 
  i ca n't really comment on the service in england ( though operating on the same principles it is managed and run seperatley using different methods ) but i would say that most doctors i have encountered are happy to go the extra mile to give their patients the best care possible , maybe you just had a run of bad luck but either way that isnt acceptable and if you are not happy with the service provided you should complain ( i hope you did ) im happy that you had no problems without much expense but whenever i hear that argument all i can think of is the people in your country who never had that experience this year and not just the ones who didnt have insurance but the ones who did and were told that they were `` not covered '' or had to spend the time they should have been recovering worrying about medical bills whereas here a multi billionaire can expect the same treatment as someone who hasnt a penny to their name ( unless they go private where they can upgrade to first class ), 
  my view is n't representative nor fully formed yet but i quite like having a monarch , i used to view it as a horrible thing that these people were treated as special by birthright but if im honest the more i see corrupt politicians around the world and in our own country the more i like the idea that we have a head of state who by convention remains out of politics but represents the country nonetheless , noone is under any illusion that the royals are super-human or anything but they are a source of stability for the country [ this picture for example ] ( http://www.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-y_k2qk8h4ts/tvqz1jkw1wi/aaaaaaaacva/iafmetadyum/s1600/queenelizabeth2.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://woofersclub.blogspot.com/2011_03_01_archive.html&amp;h=1600&amp;w=1389&amp;sz=265&amp;tbnid=vakcorcgi3oy6m:&amp;tbnh=90&amp;tbnw=78&amp;zoom=1&amp;usg=__kuixmsfatb6fe4gw67gt7dzvsoo=&amp;docid=fao0ild5bivwdm&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=wwfzunophu-k0awq6idwca&amp;ved=0cfsq9qewbq&amp;dur=1039 ), 
  everyone pays via tax and national insurance and has full access to pretty much everything medically needed , though there are some exceptions , without paying a penny more ( either at point of use or later ) , the system is brilliant and a source of national pride and i would n't trade it for any other i 've heard of ( every other one seems to be missing something that the nhs does ) there are problems but nothing that ca n't be fixed edit : i 'd like to add two things 1 there is always the option of going private ( at cost obviously ) 2 to expand on my point whenever i have heard someone compare our system to theirs and call it similar they have talked about a small co-pay or regulated insurance or charges later things like that , i have never heard of another system that is free to all in the same way as the nhs if anyone knows any i 'd like to hear of them,

  should 've engaged your universal translator then , just fiddle with the gyrodine relays then overlap the transponder to reverse the polarity and hey presto babble be gone !, 
  defining what britain 's `` full part '' is is the tricky bit , churchill also said : `` we have our own dream and our own task . 
  we are with europe , but not of it . 
  we are linked , but not combined . 
  we are interested and associated , but not absorbed '' i agree with your point but the quotation is easy to refute . 
  probably just a play on salam alaikum, 
  i was n't aware the refferendum had taken place , heres the thing , if every proposal or request from the uk to the eu gets shouted down as trying to `` tell the eu what to do '' then we have no future within it , until recently all i ever saw on this / r / in relation to the uk was people saying we needed to be more proactive then when we are more proactive even in a small capacity like a request such as this it is the uk throwing its weight about in a union it apparently does n't want to be part of damned if you do and damned if you do n't and its a real shame because the eu is the biggest opportunity for prosperity , economical , social etc. 
  on this continent in a very long time and for a very long time, 
  how do we tell ni ? 
  spoil your ballot , this is the only way that in sufficient numbers voter disillusionment can be shown . 
  here 's how a government will play off different votes : * not voting = voter apathy * voting for a smaller unlikely to win party = just hopeful * spoiling of ballot = going out of your way to say you could easily have voted but you have no viable option, 
  3 year residency clause that applies to everyone ( eu ), 
  dangerous does n't just mean violent attacks though , i view the increasing muslim population as a dangerous threat to my personal freedoms in years to come as they seem to pose a threat to my way of life in particular that christians no longer do . 
  just to be clear what i mean , im gay and im not sure if you are aware of this or not but in the uk muslims polled on gay issues tend towards 100 % against on religious , moral and ethical grounds believing it to be `` wrong '' and that 's not just talking about gay marriage , that 's talking about the legality of homosexuality in general , when i see increasing numbers of a population of people who tend to believe religion should influence politics and that have the across the board issue of wrong being homosexuality i genuinely worry for my future , that the progress we made in these last few decades will only last a few decades because there is a significant population of people who were not a part of that learning process and think it is perfectly reasonable that i should be denied my rights , christians might not always be reasonable but to get the same kind of extremities of views you have to look at the fundamental ones rather than in this case the general consensus . 
  it might be selfish of me to bring this up but i genuinely see this as a potential threat to my freedom and eventually depending on how far this goes one day possibly even my life whereas i think most people object over incompatibility of culture etc. 
  and i 'd like to say that im actually ashamed of myself having these kinds of views , they 're everything i dislike but ultimately i recognise this as a threat and i should be able to speak out against that, 
  the thing is in europe we 've all got the historical links of having been to war together , been allied and been opposed multiple times that it kind of fades into insignificance after a while, 
  thanks but i think we spend a bit too much on `` defence '' as it is , i 'd rather see it drawn back considerably , for europe as a whole though he might have a point, 
  just to be clear you 're not forgetting to do [ this ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;newwindow=1&amp;tbo=d&amp;q=31000+pounds+to+hungarian+forint&amp;oq=31000+pounds+to+hungarian+forint&amp;gs_l=serp.3...7961.25048.0.25772.32.32.0.0.0.0.146.3072.19j13.32.0.les%3b..0.0...1c.1.zbkfld7olts ) right ? 
  no , i 'd like to see them join eventually but not at this time , there is too much of a. . . gap at the moment , culturally , politically meaning that i think trying to bridge that gap forcefully from wither side which would happen in a union would end up damaging both sides , i think in time turkey will get to a point where joining is reachable but right now is not the right time , enirely imo of course, 
  i 'd like to see turkey in the eu , it might be a stretching it a bit but we could manage , same with russia but thats not going to happen , especially with the eurasian union starting in 2015 , the thing is politically alot would need to change , turkey is not the kind of country at the moment that would add greatly imo to the eu , it has alot to catch up on and should do so if it wanted to be a part , also new security precautions would be needed considering the fact we would have a direct border with iran , iraq etc. 
  and in a schengen area this could be very dangerous russia , lots of land lots of problems , if they joined we 'd really have to name it the eurasian union anyway , who knows maybe that 's a future topic on a merging of the two ?

  i 'll do it for you , all i ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by ... oh and some of that irish gold , i 'm not running a charity here !, 
  actually i always get the sense that people do n't mind so much giving a bit extra money when it 's being used to help develop underfunded regions in the eu and such like but that their main opposition to it is a loss of sovereignty in that the laws made in the uk can be overridden by something that the public feels no connection to . 
  now that ukip is starting to gain serious ground they want to attack it from every angle possible so being a net contributor is being warped into funding of frivolous spending just to note im very much pro eu i just thought you should understand that economical reasons are far from the only reasons people here would want to leave, 
  i think the coalition breakup is exactly what he is preparing for , although they 've been all smiles they wo n't be seeking to work together again until clegg dons his tory hat . 
  basically cameron knows he does n't have a majority without the libdems so he needs to find support elsewhere , even marginal support like ukip offers would do the trick, 
  my parents were together and im doing the exact same things with no boyfriend ... its almost as though parents marital status is not the be all and end all but that cant be true :p, 
  sounds brilliant but this should n't be seen as a long term solution not depended upon , only used to supplement power , a power source that is fuelled by waste is just using man-made fossil fuels and any sort of dependence on them will prompt calls for more waste . 
  tl ; dr so long as these are only being used as a stop gap measure until waste is negligible great , should n't be a main power source and should only deal with places and countries using it as a stop gap measure not a solution, 
  people meet and get * swept away * in the romance and ultimately end up * drifting apart * , though most reconcile and its all * water under the bridge * . 
  do n't worry , i 'll see myself out, 
   different from americans and brits / liberal application of crude words depends on what part you are in but you will find that there are many places in the uk where swearing is just part of the local lexicon, 
  the same thing still happens generally with teachers past a certain age ( though not always ) waiting for `` the youtube '' to load, 
  with that kind of attitude being heavily indicative of the problem, 
  looking at my own little part of the world in scotland im surprised that the most populated part of the country seems to use the internet the least whereas the least populated seems to use it the most, 
  i think this is the problem exactly , though i fully support the idea of the eu , think that its the future for us etc. 
  i do n't really see myself as european in the way i think those from the continent do , i think its probably majorly due to the 4 countries of the uk still seeing themselves as such , there is still alot of focus internally on the union and how the country works together that the eu feels like a bigger version that affects us but should always take second place over sorting out our union to be honest i think the only way we would really get a feeling the way they have on the continent is if we were to dam the english channel and physically connect ourselves other than that we are just going to have to wait for the feeling to build ( if it hopefully does ) on its own, 
  just to be clear we do n't actually hate either of them , we just enjoy taking the piss out of them - alot, 
  i see the continent becoming fully united and eventually ( though maybe not even in 100 years ) doing away with the concept of nations within the borders , power would come from regions to central authorities , though homogenised , regions will retain their ties with each other and distinct cultures will continue to exist . 
  in the shorter term i see the eu and russia trying to find common ground to build better relations on , depending on what becomes of the [ eurasian union ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eurasian_union ) , it will either to be for an ally or for a potential member in the next 20 years i think there will be increased xenophobia to those out-with the eu/europe this will be realtivley temporary but will solidify the bond between people by use of a `` them and us '' ideology also an ever increasing focus on renewable energy and being able to survive and even thrive with no access to fossil fuels, 
  as a gay atheist i 'd like to make it clear that not all christians are out of touch in this way , there are a great many who are progressive and supportive , so please do n't do them the injustice of tarring them all with the same brush . 
  then have a nice [ cold drink ?

  is muggle a genuine insult in ni or was i just completely unaware that wizards and witches do exist ? 
  in scotland ( not sure about the rest of the uk ) hen is a way to refer to a female in some sections of society, 
  50 , according to recent research, 
  i mis-read that to mean that the bnp was a parody of hitler ... it did kinda made sense ( british national party ), 
  borg ? , sounds swedish, 
  ... that 's wholly and absolutely false , `` scottish labour '' were the face of the no campaign . 
  the de gaulle view , he was right and you are too , much as i regret it , if the uk votes to stay it will do so out of a belief that the eu can become a trade alliance only and will pursue that goal . 
   wo n't help any party that does n't move our nuclear submarines out of scotland that 's the price of * coalition * , a high price that nobody expects to be paid . 
  cooperation in a confidence and supply deal is the next thing and the price for that is devo-max , something that commands supermajority support in scotland but similarly none of the liblabcons support it . 
  under the copenhagen criteria you do have to be a european country . 
  wow !, 
  you 're hired . 
  do you have any diplomatic experience whatsoever ? 
  as of yet it looks like another referendum is a while off even being proposed unless in the eu referendum scotland votes in but the uk as a whole votes out . 
  despite what you 've probably seen in the uk-wide press the snp have been incredibly conservative in even discussing the possibility of a second referendum , it 's off the table at conference and a new party has formed because some see the snp as not chasing independence as much as they should . 
  that does n't sound weird at all , in fact that sounds pretty great . 
  every time i see this i 'm amazed how bang on the money scotland is . 
  it 's not in the room never mind on the table , the scotland bill that i think you 're referring to is seen by about 9 % of people as fulfilling promises regarding devolution but we are continually told that it 's the best thing going . 
  is it an actual fence or is it just razorwire laying on the ground ? 
  that 's very good . 
  people know what is meant when someone says asian , there 's no confusion . 
  i mean you * do * have two votes ... why not both ? 
  snp on constituency , green on list , a green vote in the constituency ballot is pretty much wasted as is an snp vote in the list ballot . 
  yeah i took the one little sentence that explained the reasoning .
