   i understand the title may sound a bit harsh but that 's the only way i could describe it no it 's not because that 's * not * what she just said . 
  `` actually my dad , he said to me : i think if they go to europe , for his kids and for better future i think you should do that and then we 'll see if we can fix his teeth . '', 
  ah , i misread what was going on then . 
  if i 'm right ( again could be comepltely wrong ) then crying after it makes perfect sense , if you 're worrying you and your family will be sent back to a place you 're saying you 'd be better off being thrown in front of a train than going back to then i can absolutely understand just breaking down crying . 
  putting the baby at risk like that is inexcusable though . 
  was that definitely what he was doing ? , i only speak english so ca n't understand anything that 's actually being said but i thought he was * basically * saying if you 're going to send us back you may as well throw us in front of a train , or something to that effect . 
  i could be completely way off the mark obviously but that 's what it seemed like to me, 
  what kind of workers ? 
  what kinds of jobs/skills required . 
  does not speaking german but willing to learn count . 
  visitation is the first thing that springs to mind , possibility of a language barrier with guards is another . 
  yes , and the only two people arrested were english people because it was actually a protest against him , not him because he was english . 
  unable to accept that he 'd not been well received he had to fall back on a persecution complex to justify himself . 
  no , it 's a different political scene even when you exclude independence , ukip are a non-entity , the tories scrape by , labour and the snp are the 2 main parties ( though that 's about to change ) . 
  advocating left-wing politics is not a risk it 's expected of you . 
  cutting out the middle man pretty much but not for defence & foreign affairs , for other things though yes . 
  fundamentally the different way that powers are divided is the basis for understanding how the two unions are seen , in the eu , the eu requests powers from the members . 
  in the uk , the members request powers from the uk . 
  so in the uk scotland can ask again and again for devo max etc but it wont come , in the eu scotland would be the one deciding what it is and is n't willing to give up and it 'd be doing so in cooperation with others . 
  pretty much the entirety of the right wing press , lookup snp anti-english and you 'll find plenty . 
  it 'll be fought on a different political ground purely because it 's a different political scene , the eu as an issue really just is n't as big a deal in scotland as it seems to be in the rest of the uk . 
  in general , in fact i 'd say in the main pro-independence generally correlates with pro-eu , further integration wise it varies , generally though you 'll find plenty happy with the idea of further integration plenty opposed . 
  it makes sense but not in the way the debate is framed down south , independence in europe has been the policy for decades and it 's pretty rare that anyone disagrees with the in europe part . 
  you realise we got called anti-english bigots for that right ? 
  i 'm actually sympathetic to eurosceptics on that front , it was n't nice when it was happening to us and i do n't like seeing the same tactics being applied again . 
  vilification is something those wanting to leave the eu are going to become very familiar with . 
  ( you aint seen nothing yet ) and while i 'm pro-eu , i wo n't be engaging in that aspect of campaigning . 
  do you realise just how much irreversible changes a government can make ? 
  i realise it does n't sound like it but when you actually think about it , a vote on a single constitutional issue , even as big as independence is nothing in comparison to electing a government that is effectively given power over every single issue . 
  it 's not quite marching with our brethren but from the way some snp politicians have responded to eu questions it looks like they 'll be arguing for a wider scope for the eu and i 'm expecting the scottish campaign to be largely what level of integration we want not whether we should have it . 
  in saying that i expect the scottish campaign will be relatively isolated from the wider campaign in the rest of the uk though . 
  not the half you can see ... 
  yes and the reason the twin status was cancelled was the intelligence aspect , nothing to do with endangered . 
  so i 'm not sure why you 're mentioning people talking about them as endangered when its nothing to do with whats being discussed . 
  the word `` endangered '' is n't mentioned once in the article , looks like you 're the one coming off as ill-informed . 
  i do n't get why you 're being downvoted , obviously it 's the greek system and it works for them but i ca n't imagine in the uk a high court judge becoming a caretaker pm even if it was just temporary until elections . 
  it just seems so , strange . 
  i 'm not a historian or anything but i think at least in wwii most probably would n't name * italy * as the worst . 
  looks like you 're right then , ca n't believe anyone could survive that !, 
  there was another crash on the isle of wight where a pilot was pulled out of the wreckage , i do n't think the pilot survived this one . 
   because he already knew that the situation is exactly the same in both countries yes , as i said that 's why you say it , sounds like you 're just looking to be outraged at everything tbh . 
  saying `` i do n't know how it is in ` x ' '' is a very common saying that is usually said because the person knows it is exactly the same in both places so yes , it should be noted . 
  s/he was n't being xenophobic in the slightest there . 
  they joined fucking isis . 
  there 's teenage idiocy then there 's wanting to be part of an organisation that is pretty open about mass killings . 
  plenty of people feel disenchanted with their lives when they 're young but most manage to find an outlet that does n't involve the mass slaughter of human beings . 
  they wanted to build a society where people like me are thrown off buildings then stoned by children , ** that 's ** the kind of thing that sold them on the idea that isis is `` a power for good '' and `` an authentic movement they can be part of '' . 
  so yeah , i 'm really not gon na get the sympathy angle , i wonder how many infidel children they thought they 'd get to slaughter when they went over before reality set in . 
  yeah that 's what it 'll have been , she 'll have heard about how everyone in the netherlands just cycles everywhere and that 'll have became her head canon for a good chunk of western europe . 
  the survey does n't look as scotland , wales or n.i. 
  so there 's no ability to compare those outcomes . 
   often used to complement a band , person or ... well ... anything saying mon means come on like that but saying mon * then * is basically an invitation to fight [ like this ] ( https://i.imgur.com/roachc0.jpg ), 
  [ i remember at the time he was gifted a new pair of shoes since the ones he was wearing were damaged ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rnaqxl7uvv8/t8d3jntahpi/aaaaaaaacx4/bx2ga6mossg/s1600/i-kicked-burning-terrorist-so-hard-in-balls.png ), 
  nobody is saying it ca n't work just that if it is n't done exactly right you can easily end up coming across as an undesirable place for tourists to visit . 
  it 's important sure but the way some treat it as the most pressing issue of our time is a little disjointed . 
  oh i did n't realise you 'd put it as a mistake that 's fine then . 
  those issues you mention are all interlinked to the eu in some way or another , the eu was an umbrella for a ton of issues . 
   i did n't say it was n't a big issue , i would say it was less important than quite a large number of other ones . 
  not really , they were all interlinked obviously but a very significant amount of the referendum debate centered around the eu and the eu in turn informed all the other arguments most importantly the economic one , it really was one of the big hitters in terms of issues . 
  adding the unsure section can be done in reverse too though , it does n't work that way , it 'd be wrong of me to say the polls show 75 % in favour of staying vs 25 % to leave . 
  eu uncertainty was a massive part of the no campaign , it ca n't be just shrugged off as not really being a big deal  i 'd also point out that polling indicates that 43 % of scots would vote yes to leaving the eu ... where are you getting that from ? 
  [ it 's more like ~ 50 stay , 25 leave , 25 do n't know ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/proposed_referendum_on_united_kingdom_membership_of_the_european_union#regional_polling ), 
   there were lots of arguments , i do n't think the eu membership aspect was actually that important ( i think the economic and monetary arguments , plus a whole host of more direct unionist positions were far more important . . ) . 
  it was n't * the * issue but it was a central issue , top 5 at least . 
  [ fond memories of wwii ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8xt1m4war4 ), 
  sorry if i was rude , it 's just when people make such incorrect statements like that , considering anti-english is the go to insult with no basis , it 's just something that has to be called out . 
  just another crazy with a very salty chip on the shoulder then . 
  really paranoid people that see the word westminster as code for england and independence as inherently anti-english would agree with you . 
  people that actually go on that sub and are n't delusional know you 're talking bullshit . 
  any chance you are that gibraltan britnat ? 
   from the stuff i remember j.k rowling receiving it seemed pretty anti-english . 
  also used to read / r/scotland [ 1 ] and it was pretty eye-opening . 
  utter bullshit on both counts though specifically your second one . 
  if you 're going to fling shit at least make it believable . 
  to some of us europeans , 400.000 = 400 or 400.00000 or 400.0 or ... you get the picture , 
  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-20164826 the eu question is still unanswered , there is only ambiguity because the uk government wanted there to be because there was always the chance they 'd confirm the scottish governments proposed process would work . 
  [ pretty standard assumption that more people live in cities than the countryside ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/estonia_population_density.png ), 
  yeah , and the area with north sea oil in the scottish sector is in scotland 's waters as decided by international convention . 
  utterly ridiculous to suggest that somehow scotland being treated the same as every other country would be selfish . 
  it 's funny how you make scotland taking its natural resources sound like a bad/selfish thing . 
  estonia wants independence and oh , ps : it wont be leaving behind the areas that have oil shale . 
  they did , the uk refused . 
  [ there was also this one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gulf_of_tonkin_incident )  the outcome of these two incidents was the passage by congress of the gulf of tonkin resolution , which granted president lyndon b. johnson the authority to assist any southeast asian country whose government was considered to be jeopardized by `` communist aggression '' . 
  ** the resolution served as johnson 's legal justification for deploying us conventional forces and the commencement of open warfare against north vietnam . 
  ** so not quite salami tactics , halfway there though . 
  it 's not a contradiction though , we only see holding hands as a sign of intimacy because it 's how we 've been raised to see it . 
  they simply do n't view it in that way in those places . 
  it is , but from what i 've heard it 's also known around the world that it 's not the norm in the west so they 'll still interpret two ( western ) men holding hands as being gay there too despite it being normal to them . 
  edit : two western men, 
  across india , africa and many middle eastern countries it 's a normal thing for men that are friends to do . 
  [ george bush & king abdullah ] ( http://www.cbsnews.com/news/abdullah-bush-stroll-strikes-nerve/ ), 
  yeah and if you look at the polling way back before the campaign even started you 're talking [ very different from the end result . ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_polling_for_the_scottish_independence_referendum,_2014#2013 ) . 
  these polls on the eu will be good for tracking public opinion over the course of the next year or two but at the moment it 's too far out to have any level of certainty which way the vote will go and that is assuming total accuracy in the polls . 
  do n't you normally get a receipt * after * you 've paid though ? 
  kinda makes walking out without paying more difficult . 
  the police conducting the raid seized $ 500,000 in cash , the police were quite shocked that the prosecutor had $ 250,000 in his office and believe that the $ 125,000 that they found has probably been gained through illicit means . 
  well that 's never going to come back to bite them ... 
  men too . 
  i do n't really get the hate for countries being called eastern european , when i hear `` eastern european '' the first thing that springs to mind is a country that 's been massively disadvantaged but is making rapid progress . 
  800 ... wow i 'm actually quite happy with how the general election went in scotland , would n't say it was common sense across the uk but it certainly was here !,
