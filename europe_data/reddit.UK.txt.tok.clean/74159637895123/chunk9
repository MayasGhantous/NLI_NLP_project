  glad you agree . 
  the funniest thing was that it seemed like everyone but shetlanders talking about it . 
  if they put it in a manifesto and won on it then who 'd stop them . 
  that sounds like a bad cough . 
  i 'm talking about in the uk though , referenda are relatively rare events here . 
  also australia mix ups . 
  that 's why you * do n't * argue for the status quo , if a referendum is happening in the first place it 's because of a not-insignificant amount of discontent with the status quo . 
  so if you want a truly successful campaign you base your campaign around finding a reasonable middle ground . 
  better together had plenty to paint they just decided not to until a week before the vote . 
  it was mainly tavish scott doing the stirring of his own accord on the o&s thing . 
  every disco he got in his heart was pumping for love . 
  no , she 's going to recognise the fact that they did so with scotlands position in the eu *** guranteed *** being a * major * part of the better together campaign , both in favour of the union and against an independent scotland . 
  and it 's not as though she did n't qualify whether or not the snp would seek to hold another referendum with precisely the scenario we are talking about , there 's no referendum on the cards unless the uk as a whole votes to leave but scotland does n't . 
  there was a very strong gust of wind . 
  what about the bigger picture , what 's to stop contradictory decisions being made by the public who vote for what they like the sound of ? 
  for example , granting tuition fees but opposing a tax increase that could pay for it ... 
  technically he never actually left, 
  the eu is generally completely ignored in the uk , when the campaign begins you 'll find a campaign centered around taking part in the eu as an active member extolling the virtues of it , that 'll be pretty much the first time that 's ever going to have happened and if we stay in then there 'll be moves to fulfill that . 
  yeah , pretty much , people say `` ah but it 's unwritten '' because they 're told that it 's an equivalent to a real constitution . 
  right , that 's why it 's called an * elective * dictatorship , we elect them then they have absolute power until the next general election , that is literally the only check that could be argued as having any semblance of permanence and even it was suspended during wwii ( for obvious reasons but the point stands ) the supreme court ca n't overrule parliament . 
  the uk is a constitutional monarchy that acts in effect as an elective dictatorship . 
  it 's commonly described as such . 
  there 's a reason the uk system of government is nicknamed an elective dictatorship , there are no limits to what a majority government can do in the uk , what checks and balances exist only exist in the sense that the government agrees to abide by them . 
  without a fundamental reconstitution of the uk political system there can never be any real checks or balances on the power of a uk government . 
  the very root of the british constitution is that no parliament can bind its successors , in effect the parliament can make or break any law it chooses to . 
  and virtually all polls showed a hung parliament as a near certainty , when people say the only polls that matters is the one on the day they 're not wrong . 
  well we 're pretty much on a sustained wave of support for the snp right now , looking at westminster results in isolation is when people assume the snp just came out of nowhere . 
  in holyrood where tactical voting is n't really a big issue they broke the electoral system in 2011 by winning a majority in the system designed to prevent them ever doing that . 
  pretty much , to stand as an snp candidate in a seat one of the first things you have to do is have a certain amount of support from the local members to do so . 
  yes the snp have stv support in their manifesto and representatives of the party have confirmed in the last few minutes they will pursue that despite it probably being detrimental to their seat share . 
   scottish nationalist party it 's the scottish ** national ** party, 
  it all depends on how the vote is distributed whether a party gets a certain amount of seats or not , in 2010 the conservatives won 36 % of the vote and 306 seats , their coalition partners the lib-dems won 23 % of the vote and 57 seats . 
  nope , spells hi on a numb pad, 
  basically you have teachers dedicated to teaching the political system . 
  more or less falls under identifying and understanding biases in political arguments , why different approaches are used , basic political history of your country and an international outlook on how other countries run themselves as well as different voting systems and political ideologies . 
  in scotland it 's a subject called modern studies , it 's a subject grouped in with history and geography as pretty much basic education in high school . 
  ( the idea of political candidates showing up to a school and handing out sweets and fags is hilarious to think of from my perspective . ), 
  `` anti-establishment '' in what sense ? 
  ukip for example styles itself as anti-establishment but from the outside looking in they 're just uber tories , so are they maybe using the label rather than being deserving of it ? 
  i 'd guess these parties stand to gain from such a system , they 're probably not overwhelmingly popular , just not as unpopular as everyone else ? 
  it exagerates large party vote shares and minimises smaller ones . 
  it rewards pluralities not majorities . 
  so in the uk the lowest anyone has won a seat with was around 25 % it creates a two party system and the people with the power to change the system are completely dependant on it for their seats . 
  [ these ] ( http://www.politicsresources.net/area/uk/percentvote.htm ) two graphs sum it up really . 
  this is fptp yeah ? 
  ridiculous system , ca n't think why anyone would argue in favour of it . 
  it 's the scottish national party , they believe scotland is best placed to govern scotland , that 's it , you ca n't just assign your own prejudices to that willy nilly , there 's nothing about hating england or the english in that and the silly and rather childish insistence of so many to keep bringing it up ( curiously without any examples ) is ridiculous . 
   the snp seems very anti-english this ... again !, 
  do n't like the party fine , but you ca n't just make up shit about them . 
  t ` was but a joke, 
  we tried that before , little place called africa , you might have heard of it . 
  did n't turn out too well for anyone involved . 
  seriously though , i think that would detract from the eu , you should be able to be in any eu country and feel like it 's different but still right at home . 
  why ? 
  yeah i support the snp , so what . 
  why would i devote any time to someone who seems to have viewed the last 6 months in a parallel universe . 
  and in that you found pursuit of a second referendum and looking to screw over the rest of the uk ? 
   however all i 've seen since from the snp are talks of yet another independence referendum and completely dodging the question when asked about questions pertaining to the rest of the uk . 
  if they 're going to use their influence to push for a referendum then it would make me much more likely to vote for them if it was one on the voting system rather than independence then you 've really not been paying attention at all then have you ? 
  i mean the second referendum issue alone is a good enough indication since it 's all * labour * is talking about . 
  what makes you think that about the snp , the first part ? 
  also roughly the same vote share as they got 4 years ago in the scottish parliament where tactical voting is unnecessary . 
  where does the fault for that lay exactly ? 
  it took well over 100 years of asking for a scottish parliament to happen , did n't just pop out of nowhere . 
   surely it would be fair if the powers devolved to scotland will also be given to individual representations of england , wales and northern ireland that 's not evel , that 's just devolution and you would n't find much opposition to that at all . 
  the opposition to evel is n't about fixing the west lothian question , you 'll find the vast majority of people agree it 's unfair and needs fixed , the problem many have is that every `` solution '' seems to be based around the idea that the situation must be reversed , not fixed . 
   after the electron things are going to be interesting . 
  yeah , they 're talking about bringing out this new proton thing , sounds fancy . 
   can someone explain the opposition of the west lothian question ? 
  i assume you mean english votes for english laws , well the opposition to that comes from the fact that what people call english laws actually have direct effects on devolved budgets , in effect those people are proposing that the scottish , welsh and northern irish budgets become english only issues and since even combined we represent such a small part of the uk , as with most constitutional issues the problems will be ignored until/unless england supports reform which will amount to decades at the least . 
  the snp are good in government , sensible in terms of policy and best of all trustworthy . 
  the only reason that they are expected to do so well though is the voting system , despite the fact that it 's now working well for them though they have included replacing it with stv in their manifesto , something that would doubtless decrease their seat share . 
  you 're not joking , just ignorant . 
  this will be the third time since wwii but the second time in as many elections . 
  it 's spelling the potential for the end of fptp . 
  o&s are one constituency for westminster , they 're only two in holyrood . 
  after this election , there 's a very very good chance it will emerge immediately as a big issue needing acted on . 
  you 're right on point . 
  except the gains are far more pronounced than that , nobody was realistically expecting anywhere near a 45 % yes vote at the outset , for the leader of the no campaign 40 % would 've been a close result at the beginning . 
  they succeeded in pushing the overton window on independence from unthinkable to acceptable , that is a massive win for them , as you say , anyone describing the snp as losers in the referendum are missing the bigger picture . 
  the last entry on the scotland section is `` about 800 other islands '', 
  macewinduadnoia is the leading one , there is a great deal of support for peppersprayadonia though . 
  milk and two sugars please . 
  yes , yes i would quite like to hear about that man, 
  greenland left the eu ... 
  greenland is an autonomous part of denmark , it left without denmark as a whole having to leave . 
  also sometimes used - brixit, 
  there 's a middle ground between a bullet point and a dissertation though . 
  that middle ground is providing a link to the story and being on hand to answer questions raised , that encourages discussion . 
  i used to like reading those threads , then people seemed to prepare for the thread with massive essays on every tiny detail of every story that happened in their country . 
  i get that those essays took a lot of effort to write but i 'm pretty sure they 're the reason that the short and sweet replies of 5 simple bullet point styled replies decreased/stopped, 
  i 'm clearly late to the party , what 'd i miss ? 
  24 is the height of summer here , 16 / 17 is where people start sunbathing . 
   i mean for instance in my country homosexuality was illegal till 1967 which really is n't that long ago when you think about it . 
  do n't forget that that was n't the point societal views changed , that all came later and really is pretty much late 1980 's onwards with rapid progress from the 00 's `` it was considered that criminal law should not penalise homosexual men , already the object of ridicule and derision . 
  the comments of roy jenkins , home secretary at the time , captured the government 's attitude : `` those who suffer from this disability carry a great weight of shame all their lives '' ( grabbed from a related wiki article ),
