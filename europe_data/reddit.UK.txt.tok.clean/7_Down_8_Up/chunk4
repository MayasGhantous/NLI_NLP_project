   we wo n't , unless those sanctions are initiated by the un . 
  ok . that was my concession to eastern europe though . 
  not something i particularly care about . 
   you could have liasons and/or observers since our relations are friendly . 
  that 's fine . 
  again , i see the csdp as a concession , not as a boon to the uk . 
  i 'll adjust my position . 
  it 'd be easier if you suggested your end of the perfect deal so we both know where we 're starting !, 
  ** uk ** ( differences to previous offer ** bolded ** ) full access to the single market . 
  limited freedom of movement ~ eu ** unskilled ** immigration to the uk limited to ~ 150,000 ( current level ~ 300,000 ) ** ~ eu skilled ( bachelors + ) immigration to the uk - unlimited ** . 
  uk-eu continue current sanctions against russia . 
  uk invited to eu discussions on said topic . 
  uk continued signatory to the csdp . 
  yo , it goes uk , eu , uk . 
  wait until someone represents the eu side before changing the position please . 
  otherwise this will just be watering down the uk position by successive uk posters . 
   make the uk hostile ? 
  your foreign minister ensured the turks he would fight for their addition in to the union after a fear champagne about the danger of turkey joining the eu . 
  boris was acting as an individual during the referendum campaign . 
  he is now a government minister and must toe the party line . 
  this is clearly an area he was willing to compromise on in order to influence policy in other areas . 
   you are hostile and the french should have listened to de gaul and never let you in in the first place . 
  without the uk croatia would n't be in the eu . 
  we 're oh so hostile to you . 
  sorry that kowtowing to germo-franco hegemony does n't appeal to us . 
   a spokesman for mr kenny said he was outlining the logic of the situation but was not advocating the position of a united ireland , and said the processes of the belfast agreement still apply . 
   the agreement says a referendum on irish unity may take place if `` it at any time '' appears likely `` that a majority of those voting would express a wish that northern ireland should cease to be part of the united kingdom and form part of a united ireland '' . 
   mr kenny has previously suggested ireland must prepare for a shift of view in the north towards irish unity by ensuring northern ireland could be absorbed into the eu like east germany was in 1990-91 rather than through a `` tortuous and long process '' of separate application . 
  he has , however , said there was ** `` no convincing evidence to suggest that a majority of the people of northern ireland would opt for a change in its constitutional status '' ** . 
  ok , sounds like a fun idea . 
  please understand as the person opening the uk position i am going to ask for more than i believe i can get . 
  edit : doyy  please do n't downvote - we need to hear all opinions . 
  you always can upvote good ideas !, 
  ** uk ** full access to the single market . 
  limited freedom of movement ~ eu immigration to the uk limited to ~ 150,000 ( current level ~ 300,000 ) . 
  uk-eu continue current sanctions against russia . 
  uk invited to eu discussions on said topic . 
  uk continued signatory to the csdp . 
  so the eu has huge tensions with russia , huge tensions are now exploding with turkey and your solution , is to make the uk hostile ? 
   to be flexible on its constitutional principles - it 's not something anyone can afford to be flexible on . 
  almost every western democracy with a constitution have ways of amending it . 
   and the funny thing is that the eu constantly was bending the rules for the uk and giving them special treatment . 
  like the cap which heavily subsidised one of britains main industries , agrigulture ... hmm that does n't sound right . 
  like the euro , which has made southern europe reliant on britain whilst fueling the british economy ... hmmmm it still does n't sound right . 
  wait , i 've got it !, 
  like the rebate , which is only given to counteract the special treatment of the french ... hmmm ... well atleast we know they always scupper plans for integration !, 
  though ... in the areas the uk supported integration germany and france opposed because it would be favourable to the uk . 
  - hypocrisy , thy name is eu . 
   we should n't judge them too harshly they had a rough time as it is . 
  i do n't actually judge them harshly because of it . 
  but i 'm going to bring it up if an irish person wants to go the ` muh selfish ' route when talking about the uk . 
   i do believe taxation should eventually become a competence of the union seeing as i 'm pro-eu and a federalist . 
  however , at this point that is simply not something possible . 
  the common tax base is a great initial step in creating a common european tax code . 
  outliers , such as you said , might hasten this process , but we should n't rush this either . 
  taxes are a very sensitive matter and therefore i think for the common tax code a new step towards empowering the ep is also needed to make the people feel they have a real direct voice . 
  i 'd agree with that . 
   taxation rates is not a competence of the union so i do n't know why you brought that up . 
  undercutting people you are supposed to be ` close ' to is a dickish move . 
  i 'd be one who argues that taxation rates should be a competence of the union so : l  ps : i think it is too soon for the eu to integrate taxation rates , the common tax base is a good initial point that would alleviate quite a few issues already . 
  too soon for full integration for sure . 
  a bit of pressure on the outliers would be good though . 
  it does n't help of course that the uk gov seems to be pretty pro tax haven . 
   is n't undercutting corporation tax the new uk policy now ? 
  seems to be . 
  but then we ar n't in the same union as you anymore . 
   quick question on it : how are they financing it ? 
  are they cutting government programs or are they increasing taxes elsewhere , or are they debt financing it in hopes the hoped growth will make up for it in the very near future ? 
  i 'm not really sure , tbh . 
  probably a mix of everything really . 
   i wa n't serious about blockade , it does n't have to be military . 
  ah , you mean embargo then ? 
   no , that would probably be the usa . 
  france is your worst friend or your best ennemy , both works . 
  no , actually the integration between the uk and french military is an order of magnitude above that of that between the uk and usa . 
  you realize we very nearly decided to share an aircraft carrier ? 
  i do n't think i need to explain how much trust there must be for that kind of decision . 
   nah we 'll let you do trade with whoever you want in the world . 
  just not the eu anymore . 
  so the eu and all of it 's members are going to leave the wto ? 
   but considering that you 're importing 25 % of your food from here , it will probably be felt by every single brit ... overnight . 
  you know the reason the eu has to subsidise its agriculture so much ? 
  because it 's not competitive on the global market . 
   nobody in the eu is going to notice the uk departure . 
  not right away anyways . 
  that explains why following the brexit referendum european markets fell further than the uks . 
  - now i 'm not saying that the eu will be as heavily affected as the uk but to think it wo n't feel it is laughable . 
  this article is retarded but so is your comment . 
   what about european blockade overnight ? 
  the only military in europe at all capable of even deploying against the uk is france . 
  our closest military ally . 
  i seriously doubt they could blockade the uk . 
   how long before people starve in the uk ? 
  so in this scenario the uk is being blockaded to stop outside food sources being brought in ? 
  i guess people would start starving about the time every major european capital became radioactive . 
   sound like a smart plan really . 
   the eu will make an example out of you so that other countries do n't try and follow . 
  i ca n't think of anything more likely to end the eu . 
  compromising a core principle of the eus foundation for petty spite ? 
  i 'm sure that wo n't rile up euroscetisim .
