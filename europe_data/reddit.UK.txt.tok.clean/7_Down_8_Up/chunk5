  that 's not even mentioning pushing the most anti-russia major military and economy in europe into a position where dealing with russia makes sense . 
  i 'm sure ee will support that sort of policy !, 
   i 'm amazed that nobody sat down at some point before the referendum and thought they should put some form of plan together . 
  not doing so was a strategy of the remain majority tory government to make brexit less appealing . 
  it blew up in their face of course because it allowed leave to promise everything , knowing they would n't be the ones to carry it out . 
  ** the tory 's were always going to be the ones to actually undertake whatever the referendum result was , it was absolutely their responsibility to detail what each vote meant . 
  ** if they did n't feel they could put a real plan forward for brexit they should never have called a referendum in the first place . 
  i find it astounding that so many people seem to think the current predicament is the result of the leave campaign and not of the remain establishments hubris , dishonesty and irresponsibility . 
   they want all the benefits of the eu without the costs . 
  like being ` neutral ' or undercutting everyone 's corporation tax ? 
  r/uk is a bigger echo chamber than srs . 
  r/ukpol has bias , though you 'd be surprised how much it fluctuates , even in threads where one ` side ' is clearly circlejerking an opposition comment can actually be posted without being buried . 
   to be fair , a completely one sided bad deal for the uk is a good thing for the eu . 
  you want to be enemies that 's cool . 
  just understand what comes with that before you support that kind of action . 
  also i know it 's bandied about a lot that one of the core principles of the eu is freedom of movement and how it ca n't be compromised . 
  you know what else is a core principle of the eu ? 
  peace in europe , what happened to not compromising on core principles ? 
   that would be malta ok apologies , second most densely populated . 
  most densely populated major country with high numbers of net immigration . 
   even after that are belgium and the netherlands before the uk . 
  very few eu migrants come to scotland , wales or ni which is why i referred to england not the uk . 
  - but again , derail and deflect from the problems . 
  that has been proven as such a great persuasive strategy . 
  working for me : wales, 
   the u.k already had far too many special exceptions and favorable advantages over other e.u members . 
  pfft . 
  we did n't have a policy that forced every other memberstate to subsidise one of our main industries . 
  almost all of our so called exceptions were protections against franco-german initiatives that would be damaging to the uk and beneficial to them . 
  where the uk wanted further integration france and germany opposed because it would benefit the uk over them . 
  this idea of special treatment is such propaganda bullshit . 
   they wanted even more than that . 
  england is the most densely populated country in the eu . 
  being flexible in the face of oncoming crises is what a good institution needs . 
  as we have seen time and time again , that is not the eu . 
   it was either appeasing the u.k and telling the other 90 % of the e.u that they were less important unless they threatened to quit every year . 
  or telling the u.k that they have it good enough as it is , take it or leave it . 
  this one policy fits all shit has really been working out in southern europe , better double down !, 
   in addition to what everyone else said , every other crisis required most or all of the 28 member states to work together and to find a common solution to politically explosive issues . 
  brexit 's all on the uk . 
  brexit is on the failure of all 28 member states to work together and find a common solution . 
  do you think camerons negotiation attempt was a prank or something ? 
  knowing what the other side truly wants is a huge part of negotiation . 
  what are you on ? 
  what happened to no negotiating before a50 is activated ? 
  from the person who 's entire argument has been :  then they are fools . 
  the only reason you ar n't being downvoted for your inane comments is because you 've got a european federalist flair . 
  it 's a macro theory of economics , so on the scale of sciences it has more the weight of a hypothesis than a theory . 
  so yes , it is an opinion , unless you can prove it unequivocally , which you ca n't . 
  either way , when i was talking about different definitions i was referring to colloquial use not academic . 
  i think it 's use in the press and in political discussion has been a gross case of over-generalization which is why i do n't think it 's a useful term . 
  again , i was n't really talking about it 's use in economics papers . 
  apologies for not articulating myself better in my previous comment . 
  yes . 
  that 's the point ... 
  it 's his comment but with opposite bias . 
   the point is that neoliberalism in its current meaning has less to do with immigration policies and open borders , and more with market deregulation , privatisation of public services , and reduced government spending . 
  i know . 
  i do n't like large generalizations or labels , which is why i do n't think they neoliberalism and neonationalism are useful . 
  though , my understanding was that americans use the word liberal differently from us ? 
   that said , the original rant you replied to does n't make much sense , either . 
  yeah , i was trying to highlight that by doing the same thing back , weak analogies , snark and all . 
  so i was a bit thrown off by being questioned on my knowledge of neoliberalism as if my previous comment was a serious attempt at describing it rather than a parody . 
  i guess some things do n't convey well over text . 
   do you think we could see farage become leader of labour ? 
  but if labour do n't get their act together and ukip actually get their act together we may see ukip becoming the main opposition party . 
  though more likely ukip become a minor party ( in the commons ) somewhat like the lib dems circa 2008 and labour remain the main opposition but mostly reduced , leaving us with a tory majority for the foreseeable future . 
   i want to see labour transform into a conservative party , mainly because it 's minority groups ( muslims and blacks ) are usually conservatives themselves . 
  the furthest right you will drag labour is centre . 
   the tories would then be able to push the `` liberal '' agenda without hindrance . 
  the only competent opposition the tories currently face is themselves and even then ... 
  it seems all the major political leaders have been wiped out and now the b teams are up against eachother . 
  i 'm not really interested in swapping opinions , if you think neoliberalism is a useful label good for you . 
  if you want to convince me that it is you 're going to have to describe what you mean by it and then show me a ) that that is the accepted description and b ) that it is a valid description of reality . 
  edit : typical / r/europe discussion . 
  european federalist accuses people of being ignorant . 
  when attempting to argue his position fails to account for a major variable . 
  tries to wriggle out of that variable by requesting it from 18 years prior . 
  when given that and finding out that it still does n't support his narrative stops replying . 
  upvoted . 
   i said adult population !, 
  you think we should only consider the present and not the future implication of policies ? 
  interesting . 
   what was the birth rate 18 years ago ??? 
  still higher than the current number of death by around 100,000 . 
  so again , ** you are wrong ** . 
  who 's the ignorant one blinded by rhetoric again ? 
   review of the registrar general on births and patterns of family building in england and wales , 1998 ; laid before parliament pursuant to section 19 registration service act 1953, 
  i 'm just mirroring his comment . 
  i do n't think neoliberalism or neonationalism are useful terms . 
  everyone and their donkey has a different definition for liberalism and i hav n't seen nationalism used as anything other than a synonym for ` bad ' . 
  edit : if your comment is meant to be some kind of rebuttal , and i 'll note i 'm not sure if it is , you might try actually contesting the points i make , instead of attempting some vague ` no u ' . 
  true but tony blair certainly has the skills needed and with such week opposition . 
  let me reemphasize i do n't think it likely but it is not an impossibility . 
   you only reveal your own ignorance with this the immigration rhetoric ... 
  ironic , considering you just tried to talk about net population changes and ** failed to account for births ** . 
  talk about post-truth politics . 
   there are 3 million eu citizens in the uk and 2 million uk citizens in the eu but there are another 4.5 million uk citizens outside the eu , in places like america and australia . 
  the uk has a net inward migration of around 350,000 . 
  let me state it in more simple fashion for you : more people come to the uk , than leave it .
