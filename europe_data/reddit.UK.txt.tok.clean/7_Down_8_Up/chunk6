   the ons figures show that the uk has an annual death rate of 525.000 so that means that since 2004 when the 800.000 poles started coming , almost 7 million brits died !, 
  first off this is probably a cultural thing but using . 
  in a number means you are going into decimals . 
  so 525.000 would be 525 . 
  i assume you mean 525,000 ? 
  now to your point : ** you 're ignoring the uk birth rate ** . 
  which is 700,000 . 
  so 7 million brits died and 8.4 million were born . 
  ** that is a net increase of 1.4 million . 
  **  immigration from the eu was only above 50 % ( 51.5 % ) in 2015 so why have n't you done something about it when it was the commonwealthers clogging up your highways ? 
  the population of the world outside the eu is : 6.5 ** billion ** . 
  the population of the eu is : 500 million . 
  that they have equal net immigration clearly shows the privileged position given to the eu . 
  to my mind a rather racist bias , to favour white europe so heavily . 
   for every 3 eu immigrants we send up , you send us 2 uk `` expats '' down !, 
  ** but you also have another 4 fly off to other places in the world !, 
  ** this is incorrect . 
  ** the uk has total immigration of around 630,000 and total emigration of around 300,000 ** . 
  https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/internationalmigration/bulletins/migrationstatisticsquarterlyreport/may2016  this may come as a shock to you but the uk 's adult population is actually in decline , that 's why yo have low unemployment . 
  by every metric the population is increasing and people are living longer , thus working longer . 
  the only uk politician with an ounce of charisma left is farage and his brand of charisma is polarizing at best . 
  i think it 's unlikely but i would n't say his chances of a comeback are impossible . 
  this `` neoliberalism '' theory is beyond idiotic ... 
  attempting to dream of open borders between countries of hugely disparate wealth when the wealthy country is the most densely populated country on the continent , is undergoing a housing crisis and it 's primary language is the most common 2nd language in the world . 
  it 's like packing millions of people onto a highway , all the benefits that the highway might have granted dissapear and you might aswell be walking through a bog . 
  these economic roads are well paved and sure to be used by every economic migrant ... who 's not a moron . 
  the only losers will be the idiots who think that doubling down whenever a crisis or difference of opinion occurs is a winning strategy . 
  put it all on red , we 'll keep on keeping on and get back to engaging and taking part in the world outside of europe . 
  after the jingoist federalists have gone down in flames maybe we can start working on bringing youth unemployment below 50 % in half of europe . 
   how will the eu 's 440m cope without the uk 's 64m ? 
  let 's be real . 
  as it 's failing to cope * with it * i can only say losing it does not look like a great move on the eu 's part . 
   losing 64m is a drop in the ocean . 
  the uk 's small fish . 
  ah yes , the 5th/6th largest economy in the world with huge global influence and 25 % of the eu 's military budget is small fish . 
  jog on . 
  the uk is n't a global super power but it leaving the eu is certainly not * small * . 
  anyone who thinks it is is deluded . 
  wales best celts ? 
   i think we ( in uk ) really need to stop thinking like this . 
  the eu 's obligation is overwhelmingly to optimising the outcome for the remaining membership of its bloc - not the uk . 
  history has shown that turning your back on those who wish to leave you is a bad move . 
  when people left the be we were very accommodating , unlike the french . 
  i expect the same from a group that seems to think they 've morally progressed past imperialism . 
  lets see if they actually have . 
   it does n't make any sense for them to obviously reward troublemakers by giving us a better arrangement than those who are fulfilling their obligations within the union . 
  i clearly stated in my comment that they should not let us walk all over them . 
   we already had a privileged position relative to other members ( rebate , veto , etc ) . 
  no , we had a fair position . 
  the rebate was a balancing of the cap which would otherwise have meant we were paying to sustain france 's agriculture industry . 
  every country has a veto , there was never a promise of rushed integration and indeed the attempts at it have been a mistake . 
   we should be prepared for a pragmatic reality where we may be made an example of . 
  in which case the eu can prepare for a pragmatic reality where we are not their allies . 
  i 'm sure the baltics and the ee will be pleased to see 25 % of the eu military budget withdrawing it 's support . 
  not to mention the economic impact . 
  the pragmatic reality is that trying to make an example of the uk will be the biggest propoganda victory for euroskeptics since merkel decided to ` invite ' the middle east to germany . 
  the only morally cohesive way forward is for the eu to deal with us with respect for their own position but with a friendly disposition and intent , we should deal with them the same way . 
   there 's a good rationale for the eu to ensure the uk is in a worse position than when it was a member , to discourage further `` special snowflake '' behaviour . 
  there really is n't . 
  not only is it morally wrong , it 's also stupid to alienate half of your competent military powers on the continent . 
  the eu should treat us as friends . 
  do n't let us walk all over you , but at the same time do n't treat us as strangers . 
  treating departing countries well is one of the best lessons to learn from the be . 
  the only thing the eu should be doing , is making sure that it is not put in a worse position . 
  it should not attempt a punitive agenda . 
   it 's not jingoism it 's realism . 
  throwing away decades of peace process to puff up your ego is realism ? 
  the eu has a nuclear deterrent in the uk and france . 
  the csdp ( treaty of lisbon ) guarantees defense of all members . 
  you want realism ? 
  if you are concerned then ask for more guarantees from the french . 
   in fact , with the declining power of the us by that you mean they spend more than the next 11 countries combined on military ? 
   all that means eu has to stop pretending eu is in some utopia and it has to start thinking on its geopolitical situation and how it can best establish itself . 
  there is a difference between gradually increasing military expenditure and throwing the world into nuclear crisis . 
   that means either we project power in our immediate surroundings and establish control there or we get overtaken by our neighbors . 
  project power is usually taken to mean acting outside your immediate sphere of influence and yes , the eu needs to work on that . 
  as i said , that is not the same as throwing decades of nuclear agreements out the window for ** no practical difference ** in nuclear capabilities . 
   european countries need their own capabilities that each should match those of the us and russia . 
  only then we can be independent . 
  what is with all these european federalists and germans agitating to take us back into the heights of the cold war . 
  a few blips in the federalist masterplan and the idea of peace in europe is abandoned for jingoistic military expansionism . 
   but they ca n't extradite him from the uk because he 's in an embassy i was talking about before sweden tried to extradite him from the uk . 
   technically not in england as far as the law is concerned that 's not true . 
   that is not what was agreed before germany declared war . 
  was any contingency plan for poland falling in 4 weeks agreed before the war ? 
  from your own link :  after lengthy talks , the british reluctantly pledged to bomb german military and installations if the germans carried out attacks of this kind in poland . 
  polish military leaders failed to obtain any more promises . 
  -  they were supposed to attack germany in the back and throw it out of war because it could not sustain a war on 2 fronts at the time . 
  the idea that an immediate attack in from france would have resulted in a quick conquest of germany is a view made in hindsight after looking at german deployment etc that the western allies had no way of knowing . 
   france and uk had more tanks than all of wermacht . 
  our armies got rolled over only slightly slower than polands . 
  from your other link :  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/western_betrayal  max hastings states that churchill urged roosevelt to continue armed conflict in europe in 1945 - but carried out against the soviet union , to prevent the ussr from extending its control west of its own borders . 
  [ 5 ] roosevelt apparently trusted stalin 's assurances , and he was unwilling to support churchill in ensuring the liberation of all of central and eastern europe west of the ussr . 
  without american backing , the united kingdom , with its strength exhausted by six years of war , was unable to take any military actions in that part of europe . 
  if he is extradited from the uk he can not be extradited from sweden without permission of the uk courts . 
  it would have been easier for the us to just extradite him from the uk instead of this supposed elaborate master plan . 
  japanese debt is mostly to japanese companies as opposed to foreign companies which makes it a very different dynamic than what the raw figure might imply . 
  as a leave voter who will never vote labour because i think they 're a bunch of incompetents . 
  the only remain campaigner who almost convinced me was corybn . 
  believe it or not some healthy skepticism and a will to look for reform is a lot closer to my position than pretending the eu shits gold .
