most ethnic russians living in baltic countries are citizens of that country . 
  some ethnic russians ( for example , people who 've moved there , from russia , to work ) are not citizens of the country they 're living in . 
  le monde had an article recently , showing the most popular names per d\u00e9partement from 1946 onwards . 
  it 's fascinating to see how certain names just explode into popularity from nowhere , while others slowly grow . 
  here 's a [ gif of girl 's names ] ( http://s1.lemde.fr/mmpub/edt/zip/20140429/111638/regions_femme.gif ) , and [ the article ] ( http://mobile.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2014/04/29/la-carte-des-prenoms-les-plus-donnes-en-france_4408677_4355770.html ) , which has a slider for boy 's names . 
  everybody complaining about dubbing , you probably do n't realise how awful voice-overs are . 
  try this [ polish voice over of mamma mia ] ( http://youtu.be/-61gnmqrnbg ) , for a perfect example . 
  the snp have made it very clear that they intend for an independent scotland to join the eu . 
  and it makes sense for the eu to admit an independent scotland as a member state , on terms similar to the ones enjoyed by scotland within the uk . 
  this is the simplest solution to a potentially messy problem , and it means that politicians in holyrood , westminster and brussels wo n't have to make any big and potentially unpopular decisions , so it 's the most likely outcome . 
  if the people of scotland vote in favour of becoming an independent country , it should n't be viewed as an opposition to the principles of union in general , just dissatisfaction with the existing union , and the way it 's constituted . 
  the fates of rome , yugoslavia and the soviet union should not be taken to mean that all large unions are destined to fail . 
  india , china , the united states and even smaller countries like france are all examples that unions can work . 
  immediately after the french revolution , only 3 million of france 's 25 million inhabitants spoke french as their first language . 
  similarly , history is littered with examples of small countries that did well , and with small countries that failed . 
  size is n't really a factor . 
  if there 's a `` yes '' vote next thursday , it 'll be because the way the united kingdom is organised is n't popular with the people of scotland . 
  the united kingdom is [ one of the most centralised nations in the oecd ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-25909238 ) . 
  an obscene amount of power lies in westminster , and westminster is often seen as distant and remote . 
  as someone else here pointed out , the danish munipalities , german l\u00e4nder and french d\u00e9partments have more powers than the scottish parliament , and the scottish parliament is * by far * the most powerful non-westminster government body in the uk . 
  whichever way this vote goes , the eu will come out of it just fine . 
  but there are lessons to be learned by people who would seek to centralise power in brussels . 
  ten years is a long time in politics , and the scottish independence debate has sparked a renewed interest in the kinds of ideas that lead to [ federal unionism ] ( http://www.federalunion.org.uk/federalism ) . 
  people are generally unhappy with the current set up , so maybe they 'd take another look at available alternatives . 
  not last year , but under the last labour government . 
  the north-east [ rejected the proposal ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_england_devolution_referendums,_2004 ) strongly , and proposed referenda elsewhere were scrapped . 
  the last labour government had this idea . 
  john prescott went as far as to have a referendum in the north-east , but it was defeated . 
  it was easy for the press to portray it as more government , and that was a difficult sell even back then , before the expenses scandal . 
  [ taken a couple of minutes ago in derbyshire , uk ] ( http://i.imgur.com/es2fc5w.jpg ) and [ one taken last night ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nvmxsus.jpg ) . 
  i did n't realise until looking at these , that the uk 's parliament is the only one in the eu where the politicians do n't get any kind of desk . 
  does anyone know if there are any other countries in the world that are similar ? 
  one of the chinese tescos even has a special counter to [ serve visiting north koreans ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/northkorea/3092303/north-koreans-visit-tesco-in-china-to-escape-starvation.html ) . 
  europe has plenty of apples , and most of them are n't from america . 
  prices will only go up if supply is limited . 
  it 's similar to how america 's ban on [ mimolette ] ( http://m.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-23195183 ) has n't affected the price of cheese in the united states , because there 's still a plentiful supply of cheese . 
  this aid takes the form of pre-fabricated caravans , housing storm victims . 
  i think even the american pro-israel lobby would struggle to link it with terrorists . 
  never followed ? 
  the nazi invasion of poland was the * direct reason * for world war 2 . 
  in [ neville chamberlain 's speech declaring war ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/ww2outbreak/7957.shtml?page=txt ) , he makes that perfectly clear within the first paragraph . 
  not really . 
  this is eu troop support for an [ existing french mission ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-26195583 ) - a french mission which is primarily there to support the au 's 6,000 peacekeepers . 
  this is still very much an african union affair , the eu mission is in response to a [ plea from the un ] ( http://www.dw.de/calls-to-prevent-ethnic-cleansing-in-central-african-republic/a-17426331 ) , and the mission 's focus is on creating a [ safe haven ] ( http://www.iol.co.za/news/africa/eu-wants-safe-haven-in-bangui-1.1646899#.uv-nmxzdw6k ) in bangui for civilians . 
  the whole thing is very far from `` policing the world '' . 
  does this view in american justice extend to cases where new evidence is found , or through new processes ? 
  in the uk , for instance , there have been a number of rape cases which have been re-opened , usually from the 70s and 80s , where the defendant was found to be not guilty at the time , but the court has been able to use new techniques ( usually in processing dna ) to prove the guilt . 
  there 's reason to believe that china is n't so fond of the kim dynasty any more . 
  kim jong-un is being portrayed as a [ brutal dictator ] ( http://www.straitstimes.com/the-big-story/asia-report/china/story/jangs-execution-bodes-ill-china-20131224 ) in newspapers that generally toe the party line . 
  for the parties and press that are drumming up all this panic , the romania/bulgaria restrictions being lifted form part of a wider anti-eu campaign . 
  other european countries do n't have anti-eu campaigns on the same scale . 
  it might have something to do with sweden mulling the idea of nato membership . 
  [ this video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cypsqsh8i4m ) from russian parody show yesterday live attacks sweden for being weak militarily . 
   why are we the same colour as the south ? 
  both [ northern ireland ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_ireland_%28european_parliament_constituency%29 ) and the irish republic use the single transferable vote in european parliament elections . 
  the rest of the uk uses the closed list system . 
  i believe the uk is the only eu member state that does n't use the same election method in all its constituencies . 
  if the uk intelligence services * are n't * gathering intelligence in the united states , then i 'll be very surprised . 
  all countries are spying on each other . 
  it 's naive to believe otherwise . 
  spying - even spying on friendly nations - is what intelligence services do . 
  but now this is becoming public knowledge , governments are politically required to act furious . 
  but in reality , none of this will be news to the german government , or to the german intelligence services . 
  in countries like serbia , pride marches can lend political weight to the gay rights movement . 
  in a similar way to the [ march on washington ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/march_on_washington_for_jobs_and_freedom ) and various [ suffrage parades ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:pre-election_suffrage_parade_nyc.jpg ) , pride events are a highly visible collection of people demanding political change . 
  a large movement is impossible for governments to ignore . 
  even in countries with better records on gay rights - where pride events are less political , and can sometimes have more of a carnival atmosphere - it 's politically beneficial to show governments that there are a lot of lgbt and lgbt-friendly people in the country . 
  in addition to the political aspect of it , pride events also have a social function . 
  large public gatherings of people with similar interests or circumstances are pretty common . 
  your original post still presents a false dichotomy - that the alternative to a `` let everyone in '' approach to immigration is the current home office one described in th article . 
  a balance between the two is possible . 
  i think we 're basically agreed here . 
  a change to immigration policy is necessary , in this ever-changing world with increasingly mobile people . 
  but the home office 's answer - making it more difficult for people to enter the united kingdom for legitimate reasons - will ultimately end up damaging the country . 
  you 're suggesting that the only two options available to us are `` let everyone in '' and the current home office approach of throwing up huge obstacles . 
  other countries - and even the pre-2013 united kingdom - manage to strike a balance between the two . 
  is this a thing especially for the new king , or do all monarchs get their own song ? 
  for instance , was there a song for queen beatrix 's enthronement/reign ? 
  simply , it 's because ivory is valuable . 
  at [ $ 900 per lb ] ( http://www.havocscope.com/price-of-raw-ivory-in-2012/ ) ( $ 1984 per kg / # 1306 per kg / $ 1549 per kg ) , this 3kg tusk is worth about the same as the average egyptian 's annual income . 
  and where there 's money to be made , people will stoop to breath-taking depths . 
  completely agreed . 
  i 'm amazed that the food industry , particularly in the uk after the bse/vcjd scandal , is still so poorly policed that it 's possible for people to eat meat that is n't even made from the same * animal * as what they expected . 
  the bse scandal became a vcjd scandal when infected cattle were slaughtered for beef , and humans started dying as a result . 
  i really hope this current scandal does n't go that way , but the fact that people have been buying beef and getting horse , or buying halal meat and getting pork , just demonstrates the lack of control that consumers , retailers and providers still have over the food we eat . 
  i did n't imagine that you were laying claim to the falkland islands . 
  the `` you '' in my comment was referring to argentina and de kirchner , and their attempts to claim the falklands/malvinas , simply because it 's close to them . 
  not really . 
  if there 's an anachronism here , it 's believing that you can claim land , against the will of the inhabitants , simply because it 's close to you . 
  will that rounding take place before or after the taxes are applied to the price ? 
  that 's a pretty difficult thing to work out at the minute . 
  as a democracy , though , the future of the eu should be determined by its citizens . 
  if eu citizens want federalism , then it should happen . 
  if they do n't , then it should n't . 
  whether or not the eu becomes more federal is something that matters hugely to the united kingdom , and i 'd rather that we were in there , influencing the decision , rather than just sitting around waiting to see what happens . 
  it is , of course , possible to be pro-eu without being pro-federal . 
  the nature of the relationships between different levels of government is something that nobody has perfected . 
  it 's a debate that 's being had in the united kingdom currently with welsh devolution , scottish independence , and so on . 
  it 's happening in the united states , with power constantly switching from those that want to see the states have more power ( republicans ) , to those who want the federal government to have more power ( democrats ) . 
  in belgium , you have those parties that favour greater regional autonomy , and those that oppose it .
