  and in europe , you have those that favour an all-powerful central european government , and those that believe more power should rest with the nation states . 
  and just as it 's not un-american to favour more state power , it 's not necessarily anti-eu to believe that nation states should have more power within the eu . 
  i 'm very much on the pro side , and i completely agree . 
  well , that 's not exactly true . 
  reform of the common fisheries policy would benefit most eu member states . 
  same with the common agricultural policy . 
  britain 's idea to not join the euro until the currency met 5 economic tests would have also benefited other eu member states . 
  the instinct of british legislators to seek out potential flaws can act as a great counterweight to some member states who are more interested in reaching pre-determined goals than in weighing up the pros and cons . 
  perhaps the problem for britain is that it has n't cherry-picked ** enough ** in the past . 
  britain has , historically , been an enthusiastic adopter of eu regulations and directives . 
  there have been occasions where the uk has argued for more power to be given to the commission to punish states for failing to obey directives . 
  as a result , we 're now left with a europe that does n't reflect the kind of europe that britain would like . 
  and because this has been the case for many years , many in britain do n't see the eu as something that the uk has helped to build , and to shape . 
  they see the eu as something that has been imposed on them . 
  that 's why a lot of ukip , bnp , edl etc literature talks about `` freedom '' from the eu . 
  the eu appears to be so far from what the uk wants , that the task of changing it seems impossible , so exit is starting to look appealing . 
  this is something that 's puzzled me for a long time . 
  britain is home to the city of london , which is arguably [ the world 's financial capital ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/04/magazine/how-london-surpassed-wall-street.html ) . 
  this should give the uk massive power in eu negotiations . 
  yet nothing seems to quite go that way . 
  there are massive problems in the way the eu is run , and in the way the eu spends money . 
  it 's in britain 's interest for these problems to be resolved , and for britain to be at the heart of a massive global power , yet britain 's relation with the rest of the eu has left other states unwilling to listen to britain 's good ideas . 
  britain was unable to reform the obviously-broken common agricultural policy in the face of opposition from france . 
  this leads me to believe that the uk is n't quite exerting its influence fully . 
  a surprising amount . 
  on this particular matter , though , the government messed up quite badly . 
  because churches have the power to legally wed people , they were concerned that they 'd be required to marry gay people , even if their religious texts defined marriage as between one man and one woman . 
  the government moved to reassure churches that they would n't be required to marry gay people if they did n't want to . 
  the church of england , however , was [ banned ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/church-of-england-banned-from-offering-samesex-marriages-but-all-other-religious-organisations-can-opt-in-for-gay-ceremonies-8405966.html ) from conducting gay marriages , even if they wanted to , which was [ not previously agreed with the churches ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/dec/13/anglican-church-protests-gay-marriage-ban ) . 
  more generally , though , the church of england retains quite a bit of power , both ceremonial and actual . 
  the head of the church of england is the same queen that gives parliament its authority . 
  church of england bishops have guaranteed seats in the house of lords also , the functioning of government is so tied up with church of england traditions that actually disestablishing the church would be a massive task , which none of the major political party wants to take up . 
  the argument that [ vityok ] ( / u/vityok ) is trying to make is better made by fox news [ here ] ( http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2010/06/10/john-lott-america-gun-ban-murders-multiple-victim-public-shootings-europe/ ) . 
  the article 's from 2010 , but it 's still relevant . 
  as an argument against gun control , it 's heavily flawed . 
  the [ 1996 dunblane massacre ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dunblane_school_massacre ) - which is cited as the second worst k-12 school shooting - was the catalyst for the [ firearms ( amendment ) acts 1997 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/firearms_%28amendment%29_act_1997 ) , which banned all handguns . 
  but it 's still worth bearing in mind that europe does suffer from public shootings . 
  the gun control proposed here , by piers morgan and others , does n't stop these tragedies from taking place . 
  while restricting access to firearms is [ undoubtedly a step in the right direction ] ( http://www.neontommy.com/sites/default/files/users/user717/gc5.png ) , it 's important that we keep in mind that it is n't `` job done '' in europe , and more steps still need to be taken towards preventing these massacres both here and in the united states . 
  in the same vein , * [ veep ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/veep_%28tv_series%29 ) * is armando ianucci 's american version of * the thick of it * . 
  not european , but i watched it recently , and really enjoyed it . 
  he reacted to your joke in the exact manner a german should react . 
  a precise , detailed deconstruction . 
  nicely put . 
  i 've seen quite a few businesses - both those based in britain and those that are investing in britain - saying that it 's in britain 's interests economically to remain in the eu . 
  but if the reason for wanting to leave is more to do with constitutionalism , those arguments might fall on deaf ears . 
   the london daily star reported . 
  ladies and gentleman of / r/europe , i present : [ the daily star ] ( http://panpa.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/daily-star.jpg ) ( nsfw ) not sure about everyone else , but i 'm going to wait until a more reliable news source comes along to confirm this . 
  plus , yyyy-mm-dd extends logically in to hh : mm : ss . 
  who , me ? 
  nah , i cant come up with something better . 
  the nature of the relationships between different levels of government is something that nobody has perfected . 
  it 's a debate that 's being had in the united kingdom currently with welsh devolution , scottish independence , and so on . 
  it 's happening in the united states , with power constantly switching from those that want to see the states have more power , to those who want the federal government to have more power . 
  in belgium , you have those parties that favour greater regional autonomy , and those that oppose it . 
  and in europe , you have those that favour an all-powerful central european government , and those that believe more power should rest with the nation states . 
  and just as it 's not un-american to favour more state power , it 's not necessarily nationalistic to believe that nation states should have more power within the eu . 
  there is room for reform in the way the eu is run , and it 's worth listening to those that criticise , in order to determine how best to improve it . 
  do n't misunderstand !, 
  despite the flag , and the links to the telegraph , i 'm very much in favour of a european union , and a european union that contains the united kingdom . 
  the point here is that euroscepticism is not some irrational viewpoint that needs to be stamped out . 
  there are reasons that people are sceptical of the european union and its institutions , and it only makes sense to listen to the concerns of these people , and address them . 
  and if people feel that their voices are not being heard in national or local governments either , then there needs to be reform at that level , too . 
  i agree that a unified europe is stronger than a divided europe . 
  but it 's worth having a debate to determine the kind of union that we want . 
  for that reason , i welcome william hague 's suggestions for improvement , even if i disagree with them . 
  euroscepticism does n't necessarily stem from nationalism . 
  it 's possible to have reservations about the european union without believing that nationalism is the cure . 
  [ william hague ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/william-hague/9627465/disillusionment-with-eu-at-record-levels-says-william-hague.html ) has , i believe , outlined [ the reasons for euroscepticism ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/23/william-hague-warning-eu-disillusion ) quite well today in berlin . 
   `` the eu would be stronger if it made more sense to people , by only acting where there was clear justification for action at the european level ''  `` people feel that in too many ways the eu is something that is done to them , not something over which they have a say '' if the european union is able to address these concerns , then euroscepticism will be lowered . 
  otherwise , the same issues will persist , regardless of where its institutions are positioned . 
  hollande intends to raise this [ to 75 % ] ( http://www.lefigaro.fr/impots/2012/09/06/05003-20120906artfig00574-une-taxe-a-75-reduite-a-minima.php ) in 2013 . 
  if one of these rich frenchmen relocates from paris to london , that 's certainly a bonus for the uk . 
  a frenchman earning $ 1m per year goes from paying $ 0 tax in the uk , to paying $ 450,000 ( 45 % ) tax in the uk . 
  and at the same time , he goes from paying $ 750,000 ( 75 % ) tax in france , to $ 0 tax in france . 
  while it 's certainly a lot more complicated than that , it shows how this could benefit all involved . 
  the rich frenchman has more , the uk has more , and if the french gain more than they lose through this tax hike , then it 's a win for them too . 
  win-win-win . 
  it did n't become a private member 's bill , so the idea 's kinda dead for the minute . 
  [ blog post from june 2012 ] ( http://www.lighterlater.org/2012/06/20/we-lobbied-our-socks-off-but/ ) . 
  the magazine in question , * charlie hebdo * , is a satirical magazine , in the same vein as [ * private eye * ] ( http://www.private-eye.co.uk/ ) and [ * the daily mash * ] ( http://www.thedailymash.co.uk ) in the united kingdom , or [ * titanic * ] ( http://www.titanic-magazin.de ) and [ * eine zeitung * ] ( http://www.eine-zeitung.net/ ) in germany . 
  these kinds of magazines frequently attack and lampoon people , organisations and beliefs of others . 
  from the queen to the pope , bush to obama , jesus to mohammed - these magazines do not respect anyone 's sacred cows . 
  and they never have . 
  whether or not they ** should ** is another conversation entirely , but the fact is that they 're going to publish these things , and it 's entirely legal to do so under french , british or german law . 
  by and large , these articles are published to pretty muted reaction . 
  some ardent monarchists , catholics or christians might write an angry letter , or organise a boycott , but that 's about it . 
  but for some reason , whenever mohammed is even depicted , a small number of people in some other country decide to turn extremely violent . 
  this is n't the fault of the magazine , or of france , or of the french . 
  it 's the fault of the people who are being violent . 
  if french publications stop publishing images of mohammed because they fear the reaction of muslims in pakistan , then they 're accepting that violence as a form of intimidation ** works ** . 
  it will encourage others to become violent if they want to be taken seriously , if they want to be listened to . 
  yeah , i 'd also be interested to hear of this european utopia that somehow handles minorities `` successfully '' . 
  * europe * may or may not be , but there 's no doubt that * europeans * are going to better off in the long run if they 're able to speak english . 
  [ an article published by eurostat in 2011 ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ity_public/3-26092011-ap/en/3-26092011-ap-en.pdf ) claims that 95 % of european pupils in upper secondary learn english as a foreign language , with only ireland , luxembourg and the united kingdom having any language more-studied . 
  when polled in 2005 , 51 % of respondents to an eu survey reported that they could speak english ( [ page 4 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_243_sum_en.pdf ) ) , while 77 % of respondents believed that children should be taught english as a foreign language ( same study , page 9 ) . 
  the only eu countries were less than 84 % of respondents said `` english '' were - again - ireland , luxembourg , and the united kingdom . 
  [ this chart ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/images/3/3a/foreign_languages_learnt_per_pupil_in_secondary_education,_2005_and_2009_%281%29_%28%25%29.png ) shows how the study of english increased drastically from 2005 to 2009 . 
  an ability to speak english will benefit future europeans greatly . 
  of course , keeping `` home '' languages is very important too .
