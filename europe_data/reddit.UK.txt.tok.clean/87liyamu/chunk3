  i 'd hate to see non-english languages just disappear altogether . 
  it 's not just about the tax rate . 
  harold wilson 's economic policies did n't have the desired effects for numerous reasons , including uk trade deficit , strikes and the devaluation of the pound . 
  the modern french economy is very different to the british economy of the late 1960s . 
  you can see [ here ] ( http://flowingdata.com/2010/04/27/tax-brackets-over-the-past-century/ ) that the tax rate in the united states was remarkably high right up until 1980 . 
  if this had [ any effect on unemployment ] ( http://www.google.co.uk/publicdata/explore?ds=z1ebjpgk2654c1_&amp;met_y=unemployment_rate&amp;idim=country:us&amp;fdim_y=seasonality:s&amp;dl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;q=us+unemployment#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=unemployment_rate&amp;fdim_y=seasonality:s&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country&amp;idim=country:us&amp;ifdim=country&amp;tstart=-694137600000&amp;tend=1335999600000&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ) at all , it does n't show . 
  i know this does n't specifically relate to the eurozone , but back in january , [ raspberry pi mentioned on their blog ] ( http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/509 ) that the uk tax regime was making it difficult to build their product in the uk . 
   simply put , if we build the raspberry pi in britain , we have to pay a lot more tax . 
  if a british company imports components , it has to pay tax on those ( and most components are not made in the uk ) . 
  if , however , a completed device is made abroad and imported into the uk -- with all of those components soldered onto it -- it does not attract any import duty at all . 
  this means that it 's really , really tax inefficient for an electronics company to do its manufacturing in britain , and it 's one of the reasons that so much of our manufacturing goes overseas . 
  i believe more can certainly be done , on a national level , to aid these companies . 
  even something as simple as a tax break for this sector would help startups get onto their feet . 
  on a european level , something like the [ sme funding programme ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/small-business/funding-partners-public/finance/index_en.htm ) specifically tailored for it businesses might work . 
  a recent european success story , spotify , was very much reliant on private investment and the founders ' own money to get itself to a good position where it could start making money . 
  it 's especially interesting that california has done so well in this field . 
  being home to silicon valley is obviously a bonus , but what makes silicon valley better at turning businesses into ideas than , say , stockholm , or dresden , or cambridge ? 
  neelie kroes , the european commissioner for digital agenda , spoke about this recently to [ the bbc 's click programme ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/click_online/9739343.stm ) , but does n't seem to have any solid plan on how to help startups and it-based smes to succeed . 
  this is probably something that we should stop doing . 
  since babbage 's time , european influence has waned while american influence has soared . 
  two centuries of this kind of attitude will do that to a country . 
  you never know , the question might be using the verb form of effect  [ to make or bring about ; to implement . 
  ] ( http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/effect#verb ) `` how has the financial crisis caused you to exist ? '', 
  same . 
  the survey was pretty focussed on social matters , so i took my cue from there . 
  [ baccalaur\u00e9at \u00e8s arts ] ( http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/baccalaur%c3%a9at_universitaire_%c3%a8s_lettres ) ( `` bachelor of arts '' in english ), 
  one can only assume that the queen regularly gives the-knife some of her werther 's originals , knits a nice warm scarf at christmastime , and is mildly racist , but not really in a mean way , just because she does n't really know it 's racist to say those things . 
  you think this merkel chart is creepy ? 
  see what they 've done to [ queen elizabeth ii ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/04/15/article-2129730-129c1b15000005dc-372_964x1306.jpg ) . 
  percentages and everything . 
  there are a few politicians who are well-known enough , across europe , to campaign . 
  tony blair , angela merkel , ~ ~ silvio berlusconi ~ ~ , nicolas sarkozy ; most europeans are probably aware of who these people are . 
  before we can even start talking about elected presidents and the like , we need something like the tenth amendment to the us constitution , that sets out which powers the european union has , and which will be retained by the member states . 
  i imagine any federal presidency in the eu would need to be significantly underpowered when compared to the us presidency . 
  if the position is too powerful we 'll face the problems you predict , with nationality and background becoming more important than the actual policies . 
  if the presidency is in some way partisan , the affiliated parties would probably take care of any electioneering , which would make the language barrier less of an issue . 
  the same thing currently happens in european parliamentary elections . 
  the epp 's choice for president would be promoted in france by the ump , in germany by the cdu , in ireland by fine gael etc. 
  the pes 's choice would similarly be promoted in the uk by the labour party , in france by the socialists and in germany by the sdp . 
  the `` non-serious '' french entries are great . 
  the artists seem to have a great time , and i can really appreciate that . 
  patricia kaas , thought undoubtedly talented , just does n't really fit in with the light-hearted , drunken fun that is eurovision . 
  you ca n't fool us , we know your country secretly loves it . 
  songs do n't spend [ 8 weeks in the top 40 ] ( http://www.austriancharts.at/showitem.asp?interpret=trackshittaz&amp;titel=woki+mit+deim+popo ) just to troll the neighbours , 
  pretty much what legolino said . 
  while britain , france , germany , spain etc do have some huge names in music , those big names are n't quite right for eurovision . 
  it would n't help anyone if adele entered the esc and was beaten by a group of russian grannies . 
  nor would it help anyone if she entered and won . 
  until recently , britain would hold x-factor style competitions to determine who would represent them , but the bbc stopped that , and now seem to be sending groups ( blue , the hump ) that are perhaps trying to revive ailing careers . 
  other countries ( eastern european ones , mostly ) are more likely to send up-and-coming artists . 
  it 's a great opportunity for these groups to get exposure on a huge , pan-european stage . 
  it does n't happen often , but entries like c\u00e9line dion , cliff richard , lordi and dima bilan have enjoyed success outside their own countries that they otherwise may not have done . 
   i hate eurovision full stop . 
  most people in my country do . 
  [ nope ] ( http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a383795/eurovision-song-contest-overpowers-england-norway-match-in-ratings.html ) . 
  i 'm sure there 's more information if you [ buy the study ] ( http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/65682/ ) , but it 's not free to access . 
  reading the abstract , though , it seems that the risk increases from 0.05 % to 0.075 % , if you drink a lot of tea . 
  so the chance does increase by 50 % , but it 's 50 % of not-a-lot . 
  something like [ this ] ( http://kill-or-cure.heroku.com/ ) , perhaps ? 
  i dunno , i 'm still pretty confident that spain is a better place to live , and will be for a while . 
  if you 're interested in learning more about uganda , here are some articles that you can start on : [ uganda trails in world 's best country survey - independent.co.ug ] ( http://www.independent.co.ug/column/comment/3564-uganda-trails-in-worlds-best-country-survey ) [ resentment toward the west bolsters uganda 's new anti-gay bill - nytimes.com ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/29/world/africa/ugandan-lawmakers-push-anti-homosexuality-bill-again.html?pagewanted=all ) [ international living quality of life index 2011 ] ( http://www1.internationalliving.com/qofl2011/ ), 
  as far as i remember , it was n't really a comparison in terms of `` oh , it 's okay , we 're not as bad as uganda '' . 
  the full message was sent to his finance minister during negotiations on spain 's bank bailout , and read `` aguanta , somos la cuarta potencia de europa , espa\u00f1a no es uganda . 
  '' , or `` hang on , we 're the fourth biggest [ economy ] in europe . 
  spain is not uganda '' . 
  the implied message is that prime minister rajoy thought spain deserved to be treated better in the negotiations , because it is n't a country which ( to his mind ) is a poor , developing one . 
  if you still want to play this game , you can always point out how iceland is [ most certainly not uganda ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lgbt_rights_in_uganda ) . 
  [ bbc news article ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-18408448 ) unemployment : spain : 24 % | uganda : 4.2 % gdp growth : spain : -0.1 % | uganda : 5.2 % of course , to think of life in uganda as being in any way better than life in spain , you have to ignore every other statistic . 
  it 's terrorism they 're using this time . 
  actual text from the foreword to [ the draft bill ( . pdf ) ] ( http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm83/8359/8359.pdf ) :  without action there is a serious and growing risk that crimes enabled by email and the internet will go undetected and unpunished , that the vulnerable will not be protected and that terrorists and criminals will not be caught and prosecuted . 
  blorg 's explained quite well how it works in the uk . 
  you might be interested to know that it works in a similar way with [ the hong kong dollar ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/banknotes_of_the_hong_kong_dollar ) . 
  it 's not really a continental thing . 
  vancouver 's probably a better place to be gay than sarajevo , while berlin 's probably better than des moines . 
  it 's something that really , really needs breaking down further . 
  from [ eurobaromoter 67 ( published in 2007 ) ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb66/eb66_en.pdf ) [ . pdf ) : http://i.imgur.com/yqd0y.png determining how gay-friendly `` europe '' is depends heavily on what you define as europe . 
  just look at the difference between various countries ; when people are asked if homosexuals should be [ allowed to adopt throughout europe ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fjuxm.png ) . 
  only the netherlands and sweden are above 50 % in agreement , with malta and poland down at 7 % . 
  the eu average is 32 % . 
  europe might be a great place to be gay in legal terms , but that does n't mean that europeans are necessarily gay-friendly , or that europe will be a great place * to live * if you 're gay . 
  i do n't think a bnp member would be advocating `` buy european '' :p, 
  yeah , you get this `` made in [ x ] '' thing everywhere . 
  it 's simply a marketing technique , which might help to increase sales . 
  some swedes will prefer to buy swedish-made things , from a '' * keeping local people employed , thereby helping the local economy * '' point of view . 
  some germans might prefer to buy german products for environmental '' * i do n't want something that 's been shipped all the way from china * '' reasons . 
  but on the flipside , there are very few people who 'll refuse to buy something purely ** because ** it 's from their own country , so it does n't harm sales to mention it . 
  the shock probably comes from treating all bbc output in the same way . 
  panorama is , by its very nature , a sensationalist programme , which aims to stir up outrage and disgust . 
  if you look at their [ previous programmes ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006t14n/episodes/player ) , you can see the kind of thing they go for . 
  it 's very different to some of their better stuff , like [ from our own correspondent ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/default.stm ) and even things like [ newsnight ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006mk25 ) , which tend to be more in-depth , and look at several sides of a story . 
  without wanting cause-and-effect too mixed up here , songs sung in english do win [ a lot more often ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_eurovision_song_contest_winners#by_language ) than those in other languages . 
  this is particularly noticeable since the ebu expanded rapidly in 1993 . 
  obviously , this might simply be because more people are singing in english , therefore more of the winners ' songs are in english . 
  but it seems that english has become a lingua franca in this song contest . 
  it could be argued that the `` art '' aspect of the eurovision song contest is sacrificed on the altar of winning , and that means singing in english , which has mass appeal . 
  i highly doubt that 18 of the 26 finalists chose english because it was the language with the best-sounding words . 
  eurovision entries are predominantly in english for the same reason that this subreddit is predominantly in english . 
  the english language - particularly the subset of words that are commonly used in eurovision songs - is fairly well understood across europe , by people in all countries . 
  the purpose of the song is to appeal to as wide a range as possible , across europe . 
  if azerbaijan sang in azerbaijani , they 'd never get votes from the likes of portugal or norway .
