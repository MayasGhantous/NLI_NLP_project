  the confusion is because of the various spellings of mohammed . 
  that crowd lumps together most variations , making the name one of the most popular names of all , while most people take the different variations differently . 
  edit : mohammed with all its various spellings combined * is * the most popular baby name in the uk . 
  http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/most-popular-baby-names-the-top-20-boys-and-girls-names-in-england-and-wales-9671635.html but if you combine them for mohammed , why not for oliver and ollie , for example ? 
  muhammed on its own is only the 15th most popular . 
  https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2014/dec/01/muhammad-not-most-popular-boys-name-in-britain i had assumed it would be similar in germany , but i guess not ? 
  and it would be dropping in germany too , at a comparable rate , were it not for huge immigration . 
  does le pen really need to fund it ? 
  surely everyone knows what she stands for . 
  how much money do french candidates usually spend in their campaigns ? 
  its especially bad when you have first past the post politics , like in the uk . 
  then its simply the least fragmented section of the political spectrum who get their way . 
  i completely agree that the marshall plan was great . 
  but it was n't better than never having been destroyed and having to rebuild , and the deal for germany was n't better than for its major competitors . 
   we handed half of europe to the soviets ? 
  yes ; whether or not we were forced by necessity , we gave the soviets eastern europe . 
  but besides , we could have delayed d-day , for example , to let the soviets and nazis grind each other to dust . 
  my point was we ca n't say we saved europe when half of it went to stalin . 
  * that * is delusional . 
  have cool allies that help you ( volkswagen was revived by a british officer for example ) its a myth that germany 's success is due to losing everything and having to rebuild with loans . 
  it seems to be a popular myth over here . 
  its a really stupid myth , actually , because germany 's industry was initially torn down by the allies , who wanted to remove heavy industry from germany , and as reparations to russia , greece , etc. 
  it was only tensions with the ussr that made western nations reverse this course of action , and allow the west germans to rebuild , and granting them loans ( initially , germany was meant to repay the loans in full , but the debt was later reduced ) . 
  besides , while there is n't really a consensus on how much the us spent on each nation under the marshall plan , germany almost certainly received less money than france and the uk . 
  i 'd just like to point out that i did n't downvote you ; your point was valid , and although perhaps a little on the pedantic side , its likely just a difference in interpretations of what i said . 
  the behaviour of this sub is very immature when it comes to downvoting , especially considering how english is a 2nd language to the majority of users . 
  i 've upvoted to compensate !, 
   i would say you are being a bit harsh . 
  for an entire year we were the only major power in europe still at war with nazi germany . 
  correct - but we did n't do an awful lot during that year to help `` save europe '' . 
   how do you think the war would have ended with no western front and the conflict descending into a germany-russia battle for total control ? 
  i think germany and russia would have beaten each other to a bloody pulp . 
  admittedly , perhaps the uk helped the soviets survive by supplying weapons , but that is still not enough to claim `` we saved europe '' . 
  this is n't how you should be using the word `` technically '' . 
  we `` saved '' europe , eh ? 
  we helped defeat napoleon , sure , but by accident really , we just wanted to look after our trade . 
  in wwii , we promised to defend poland , and then did fuck all as germany and the ussr invaded . 
  we even allied ourselves to the soviets ( we had to , really , but it is not something to be proud of ) . 
  after the war , we handed over half the continent to them , including poor old poland , the consequences of which they are still feeling today . 
  we overlooked most soviet atrocities , and gave them our blessing to many . 
  the best we can say is that we helped defeat the nazis , and kept some of europe out of stalin 's hands . 
  if you think that is saving europe , i hope you are n't a doctor or an accountant . 
  and it is still one of the highest birth rates in europe ... edit ( new map ) : http://one-europe.info/user/files/briefs/fertility_rate_europe.png, 
  sea levels are n't rising nearly fast enough for that ... 
  would it not be extremely dangerous for islamic state to give families of suicide bombers money ? 
  both because it is traceable , and the families are doubtless being watched by authorities * , risking revealing the network of islamists it is in contact with . 
  * although the way that paris attacker lived fairly openly in that slum in belgium makes me question this . 
  looks pretty nice . 
  it could certainly have been worse . 
   europe has really done a u-turn with regards to their opinions on immigration sadly . 
  its not like everyone was pro-immigration , then suddenly became anti-immigration . 
  many people have only recently begun to feel safe expressing their bigoted views . 
  my pleasure !, 
  fascism has to be one of the most fascinating ideologies , if only for its historic significance and ability to really mess up the political balance . 
  to be fair , its really hard to define fascism . 
  its certainly ** not ** synonymous with `` authoritarian right-wing '' , as many people increasingly seem to think . 
  it is not even synonymous with `` extreme racism '' . 
  at least , this is not the word 's historic meaning ; the same way that far-right has now become a term for nationalist . 
  it is important to distinguish these terms , to understand why people are drawn to fascism and nationalism , rather than thinking only extreme conservatives are drawn to it . 
  it manages to appear appealing to both the working classes , and the middle classes ; the uneducated and the educated . 
  it is not just the dregs of society who it attracts ; it attracts all sorts , and this is very dangerous . 
  fascism is fundamentally appealing to many aspects of human psychology - for example , a leader to look up to , a group to belong to , an enemy to fear , a utopia or other purpose to strive for , appeals to beauty , ... ** tl ; dr ** : fascist ideologies are extreme-nationalism or ethno-nationalism , which apply darwinian theories to nations/races . 
  it is left-wing to the in-group ( e.g. 
  its citizens , or people of a favoured race ) , and right-wing towards outsiders ( e.g. 
  foreigners , or people of other races ) . 
  i 'm no expert , so take what i say with a piece of salt , but this is something i 've compiled from / r/askhistorians , among other places , to help define fascism for us laypeople . 
  these are what appear to be fascism 's * ideological * central tenets . 
  note that in reality , fascists have taken some different forms from these , usually for pragmatic reasons . 
  ** autarky ** most fascists favour complete self-dependence of their state , and reject globalisation . 
  ** corporatism ** the idea that the economical structure of the country should be regulated like a corpus ( body ) , each section a corporative ( not a corporation ) , which is a union of workers in a corporation which operates in a free market , it is n't privetely owned . 
  fascist governments encouraged the pursuit of private profit and offered many benefits to large businesses , but they demanded in return that all economic activity should serve the national interest . 
  ** class collaboration ** instead of class struggle ; this is the reason fascism clashes with socialism , as fascism sees class struggle as a diversion from the struggle of nations . 
  fascism wishes to deconstruct the old classes - which is one of many areas where it clashes with conservatism - but then to create new classes , which collaborate to make the country ~ ~ better ~ ~ great again . 
  there would n't be the bourgeoisie and the proletariate , but the many classes of workers under each corporation . 
  ** hierarchy ** fascists believe that no two people anywhere are exactly equal , let alone any more people than that . 
  naturally , they usually favour their country or race as superior to others ; as such , fascists often acted in a socialist-like manner , but exclusively to their own citizens . 
  hence , fascism can be seen as left-wing to its own , and right-wing to others . 
  this implicitly suggests militarist imperialism . 
  fascism sees life as a continual conflict between people for limited resources . 
  to fascists , war let nations or races decide who got the planet 's resources , in a darwinian struggle for survival . 
  fascists applied biological concepts to constructs like nations and races . 
  virility , physical prowess and hierarchy were applied to these constructs , as well as notions like sickness and degeneration . 
  ideas of the `` sickness '' of a nation or race was what inspired many fascist regimes to resort to eugenics , and in some cases genocide . 
  this is another reason why war was so important to fascists ; it had a therapeutic effect on society : it destroyed the weak , and allowed the strong and healthy to thrive . 
  ** meritocracy ** the idea that power should come with merit . 
  this is where fascism abandons democracy . 
  the idea is that workers progress inside the corporative through merit , and since each corporative is a part of government , the meritocracy actually produces political leaders . 
  this leads to the rule of specialists . 
  the leaders and representatives of each corporative ( and consequently the government ) would be specialists in their areas , not politicians . 
  ** national rebirth ** a revolutionary desire to begin a rebirth of the nation , and escaping the `` destructive '' influences of capitalism and communism . 
  for example , mussolini wanted to form a `` new roman empire '' , while the nazis initially wanted germany to regain its former position in the world , as a `` great power '' . 
  ** nationalism ** fascists seek social cohesiveness , through nationalism . 
  mussolini thought nationalism should happen through culturalism , while hitler thought it should come through racialism . 
  fascists take nationalism far , essentially seeing other nations as competitors in the struggle for survival . 
  it 's worth pointing out that germany and italy did n't have the sense of `` national/ethnic identity '' that we as outsiders often ascribe to those nations today . 
  they were relatively recently formed nation-states , and a political movement that emphasized nationalism likely carried some appeal as a means of paving over existing regional and ethno-linguistic differences and tensions . 
  fascists believe that people are fundamentally irrational , and their irrationality should be harnessed into action , e.g. 
  using patriotism and leader idolisation as a means to get people thinking about the `` greater good '' , rather than their own individual interests . 
  this is the second way fascism and socialism clash . 
  fascism sees national loyalty as absolutely central , but orthodox socialism believes that loyalty to the international movement of communism should replace all other loyalties .
