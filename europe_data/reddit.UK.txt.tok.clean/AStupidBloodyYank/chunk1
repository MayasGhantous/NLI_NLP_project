lol, 
  yeh hopefully we can start holding these slimy toads in westminster accountable , perhaps more devolution and a truly federal uk ; with only foreign policy devolved to westminster . 
  that was why i voted brexit : hold these tossers to account now there is no one to blame for the arguably deplorable state of the country . 
  but lo , i dream too much . 
  ultimately , the uk leaving the eu will be good for the union in the long run . 
  what the eu has desperately needed for 5 years is political & fiscal consolidation ; now the greatest impediment to that has voluntarily removed itself . 
  all this talk of the eu `` punishing '' britain is quite frankly repugnant . 
  the eu has a great opportunity to turn itself into what it was always meant to be ... . and now us pesky brits are gone , we 're not going to stymie and fuck things up anymore . 
  win-win for everyone in my book ... except the piratical financiers in london ; to which i 'm happy they 're upset . 
  furthermore , there is no reason the uk and the eu ca n't co-operate politically and militarily going forward , in fact that would be the greatest loss for all parties . 
  i wish they would 've taught me a useful language like python or c # instead of useless french ( sorry mon ami !, 
  i agree . 
  france has all this influence and still ca n't mold an union it wants !, 
  no salt in your opinions at all ... . . none at all . 
   where people like le pen are accusing the ue of our problem you mean the organization that france setup and has a disproportionate amount of influence in ? 
  the fact she can say that - and be true - is in itself pretty indemnifying . 
  they do in mighty britannia , your budget-minded ancestors !, 
  something something apple falling from tree , not far from, 
  whats pure comedy is the eu pretending it 's a country and thinking it 's going to be around by the end of this decade !, 
  true , but then again , scotland is totally financially dependent on the ruk , while the uk itself is not financially dependent on the eu . 
  put another way , i fancy the uk 's chances outside of the eu a lot more than scotland 's outside the uk . 
   `` fuck you all i demand sovereignty , how dare i have to have paid for a ticket for this bus ! '', 
  not really . 
  the eu was n't bound to absorb more political power through integration ... but that 's whats happened . 
  so using our analogy ; it 's like we tried two times to get the bus in london ; that we were informed was going to cornwall ( but maybe blackpool depending on the weather ) - only to have the bus not let us on twice . 
  then we badgered the bus driver to go to cornwall and then when we got to somerset , the driver said `` actually no we 're going to go to blackpool '' because they had a vote on the bus on what destination we were going to - then we decided to get off the bus in taunton before turning right on the m3 . 
  blackpool of course is political integration while cornwall was a mere fta . 
   what you claim amounts to saying that someone 's being kidnapped because they 're taking a bus . 
  on the contrary , i 'm saying we have a right to get off the bus because we do n't like where its going !, 
  granted i was inferring it !, 
   the question would be `` is the eu undermining national governments ' sovereignty ? '', 
  some people like to pretend that brussels is n't , but cases like the factortame case show it is . 
  while you 're right that it is a ** voluntary ** relinquishing of sovereignty ; that still does n't negate whether its happening or not . 
   parliament freely submits to the eu 's legislative and judicial bodies by the european communities act 1972 it itself passed and which it can , at any time , revoke . 
  thank you for explaining the main reason why the european communities act 1972 will be revoked . 
  britain abided by the laws , and voluntarily gave up sovereignty for that ... so the big question is why is brexit a problem if its merely exercising a right already enshrined in eu law ? 
  one court case for you : factortame case . 
  prove to me ( without crazy mental gymnastics ) that an unquestionable ruling on eu law being supreme over national law not being more clear . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/r_ ( factortame_ltd ) _ v_secretary_of_state_for_transport  the case produced a number of significant judgments on british constitutional law , and was the first time courts held that they had the power to restrain the application of an act of parliament pending trial and ultimately to disapply that act when it was found to be contrary to eu law . 
  there is no other way to spin that . 
  eu law usurps parliamentary authority - thus undermining your ( and the governments claim ) that they did n't undermine parliamentary sovereignty . 
  edit : adding points, 
   that 's why we should join the eu of our own accord  we shall see !, 
  it all depends on the circumstances of withdrawal from the uk . 
   there 's very little they actually need to buy from the uk . 
  the data says differently . 
  if they could find things cheaper and better quality ; then why are n't they already importing that stuff instead ? 
   none of that is possible with the bank of england . 
  yeah , scotland can just have a scot as pm of the uk - which has far more power than the boe . 
  historically & proportionally , the scottish have had a far larger impact on the politics of the uk then most scot nats care to mention . 
  how many politically influential positions have scots had in the eu than the uk ? 
  look at imports - the uk is more than all of the eu combined . 
   ireland will be affected by brexit , but it does n't need to shape its future based on its relationship with the uk . 
  i never said ireland did lol . 
   at least the ecb gives its members a seat at the table . 
  illusory power is different than actual power . 
  to say that scotland could set the tone at the ecb or have actual power in any way is laughable . 
  not nearly as much to say that ireland is n't inherently tied to the fate of the uk more than the eu !, 
   http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/irl/, 
   just like it would have happened with the uk and us , but the eu is still the vastly bigger market both too and from the uk . 
  that argument does n't work when the reverse was used for leave . 
  what are you even saying here ? 
  eu market is big ? 
  yes it is !, 
  why does scotland trade more with the uk than the eu then ? 
  surely if scotland had comparative advantages it would already be trading on those in the eu ? 
   so what you 're saying is that sovereignty wo n't be affected then . 
  depends which of the 5 they choose . 
  3 of them affect sovereignty pretty drastically . 
   what should i tell them ? 
  they can leave the eurozone and eu at any point in time . 
  you said no sovereignty had been taken - it has . 
   what sovereignty have they lost again ? 
  hmmm ... how about having financial decisions forced on them . 
  i 'm not saying greece is a saint , but your whole argument of `` they had it coming ! '', 
  is total bullshit , and even you know this . 
   countries plan for the future in-case you were unaware . 
  that 's what investment is . 
  so you answer my question with a snarky retort that does n't actually answer the question ; great job there !, 
  scotland can plan for the future all it wants , but economic realities mean that if there were advantages to trading their products *** more *** with the eu than ruk , then it would 've already come about . 
  this is basic economics . 
  there are 5 different plans so far that would need unanimous agreement on which direction to go . 
  and you 've revealed why that wo n't happen ; you need 27 countries to agree from 5 options . 
  so laughable . 
   literally disproven in the uk 's own white paper . 
  tell that to greece . 
   so the potential for scottish businesses what is the reality right now ? 
  there may be potential , but surely they would 've already realized that potential when we were active members of the eu ? 
  what would make that situation change ? 
   the sovereignty argument is laughable is the eu moving towards taking more or less sovereignty from national governments ? 
  the trend has been decisively towards taking more sovereignty since the financial meltdown in 2008 . 
  furthermore , the idea that scotland would keep any of the benefits from the uk 's membership has been categorically shot down by the eu . 
   obody was predicting opec crashing the market absolute bollocks . 
  fracking clearly was n't going anywhere by 2014 . 
  furthermore , it was already well known that the us had over $ 120 trillion worth of fracking-accessible oil underneath it . 
  if you try an argue the snp did n't realize a collapse in oil prices were coming , then you 're full of shit !, 
  haha thats cute you think that . 
  have you got a breakdown of how scottish trade is actually increasing with the eu proportionally more than with ruk or the world at-large ? 
  or are you talking out your ass ? 
  what possible long term gains could there be for scotland if they 're forced to share a currency with another country ( that sets interest rates ) and is its main trading partner ?
